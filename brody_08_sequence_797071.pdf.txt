Abstract
Background: The presence of highly conserved sequences within cis-regulatory regions can serve
as a valuable starting point for elucidating the basis of enhancer function. This study focuses on
regulation of gene expression during the early events of Drosophila neural development. We
describe the use of EvoPrinter and cis-Decoder, a suite of interrelated phylogenetic footprinting and
alignment programs, to characterize highly conserved sequences that are shared among coregulating enhancers.
Results: Analysis of in vivo characterized enhancers that drive neural precursor gene expression
has revealed that they contain clusters of highly conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) made up of
shorter shared sequence elements which are present in different combinations and orientations
within the different co-regulating enhancers; these elements contain either known consensus
transcription factor binding sites or consist of novel sequences that have not been functionally
characterized. The CSBs of co-regulated enhancers share a large number of sequence elements,
suggesting that a diverse repertoire of transcription factors may interact in a highly combinatorial
fashion to coordinately regulate gene expression. We have used information gained from our
comparative analysis to discover an enhancer that directs expression of the nervy gene in neural
precursor cells of the CNS and PNS.
Conclusion: The combined use EvoPrinter and cis-Decoder has yielded important insights into the
combinatorial appearance of fundamental sequence elements required for neural enhancer
function. Each of the 30 enhancers examined conformed to a pattern of highly conserved blocks of
sequences containing shared constituent elements. These data establish a basis for further analysis
and understanding of neural enhancer function.

Background
Studies over the last two decades have revealed that cisregulatory elements, i.e. enhancers, contain multiple
DNA-binding sites for different transcription factors (TFs)

that cooperatively function to direct the tissue specific
expression of their associated genes [1]. DNA sequence
comparisons of different co-regulating enhancers suggest
that many of these enhancers rely on different combinaPage 1 of 15

tions of TFs to achieve coordinate gene regulation [2]. For
example, during early Drosophila neural development,
combinatorial interaction of proneural basic helix-loophelix (bHLH) TFs with homeodomain proteins, regulate
commitment and patterning of neural precursors [3-8].
Cross-species analysis of individual Drosophila enhancers,
using EvoPrinter or conventional alignment based phylogenetic comparative analysis [9,10] and the twelve
sequenced Drosophila genomes, representing over 160
million years of collective evolutionary divergence,
reveals that these enhancers are made up of clusters of
highly conserved sequence blocks (CSBs), separated by
less conserved sequences of variable length [11]. CSBs that
are longer than 8–10 bp are likely to be made up of adjacent or overlapping DNA-binding sites for different TFs.
For example, the Drosophila Krüppel central domain
enhancer contains overlapping highly conserved binding
sites for its known regulators [12-14,10]. Specifically,
work from the Jäckle laboratory [14] has shown that one
CSB of the central domain enhancer, 16 base pairs in
length, contains overlapping binding sites for the antagonistic Bicoid activator and the Knirps repressor TFs.
In order to initiate the functional dissection of CSBs that
make up neural precursor gene enhancers and to gain a
better understanding of their architecture in terms of the
substructure of their constituent sequence elements, we
have developed a multi-step protocol (collectively known
as cis-Decoder) that allows for the rapid identification of
short 6 to 14 bp DNA elements, termed cis-Decoder tags
(cDTs), within enhancer CSBs; these cDTs are shared
between CSBs of two or more enhancers with either
related or divergent functions [11]. To discover enhancer
type-specific elements that regulate gene expression in
neural precursor cells – including genes expressed in early
delaminating CNS neuroblasts (NBs) and the proneural
clusters and sensory organ precursors of the PNS – we
have performed cis-Decoder analysis of CSBs from in vivo
characterized enhancers. For early CNS development, we
have selected the previously described enhancers of six
genes that activate expression in early delaminating CNS
NBs: deadpan (dpn), hunchback (hb), nerfin-1, scratch (scrt;
the SA enhancer), snail (sna) and worniu (wor) (Table 1)
[15-18]. For the cis-regulatory regions that drive expression in the proneural clusters (PNCs) and sensory organ
precursors (SOPs) of the PNS we selected the in vivo characterized enhancers for bearded (brd), deadpan (dpn), rhomboid (rho), scrt and sna (Table 1) [19-24].
Our analysis of the CSBs from these characterized enhancers has identified known TF DNA-binding sites and novel
sequences of as yet unknown function. Enhancer typespecific sequence elements within CSBs appear in different combinations and contexts in enhancers of co-regu-

lated genes. The information gained from cis-Decoder
analysis of the neural precursor cell enhancer CSBs was
used to discover a novel co-regulating enhancer that
directs Drosophila nervy expression. Our studies indicate
that although specific core DNA-binding sites (such as
those for bHLH and homeodomain TFs) are enriched in
enhancers of co-regulated genes, enhancer-binding specificity is most likely conferred through sequences that flank
the consensus core docking sites. The fact that shared
sequence elements of co-regulated enhancers reside in different combinations and positional ordering within each
of the enhancers, suggests that their combined presence
but not necessarily their relative positions is required for
cis-regulatory function.

Results and discussion
Neural precursor cell enhancers share highly conserved
core sequence elements
To determine the extent to which neural precursor cell
enhancers share highly conserved sequence elements, we
performed cis-Decoder analysis of in vivo characterized
enhancers (Table 1) [15-28]. Our analysis revealed the
presence of both novel elements and sequences that contained consensus DNA-binding sites for known regulators
of early neurogenesis. Table 2 lists cDTs shared by multiple CNS or PNS neural precursor cell enhancers. None of
the elements shown were present in our collection of 819
CSBs from in vivo characterized mesodermal enhancers,
thus ensuring their enrichment in neural enhancers. Highlighted are consensus binding sites for known TFs; basic
Helix-Loop Helix (bHLH) factors and Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)], respectively acting in proneural and neurogenic pathways [7]; Antennapedia class homeodomain
proteins [29], identified by their core ATTA binding
sequence, and the ubiquitously expressed Pbx- (Pre-B Cell
Leukemia TF) class homeodomain protein Extradenticle,
a cofactor of many TFs [30], identified by the core binding
sequence of ATCA. More than half the conserved cDTs
were novel, without identified interacting proteins. Many
of the CSBs consisted of 8 or more bp, and often contained core sequences identical to binding sites for known
factors as well as other core sequences that aligned with
shorter novel cDTs, suggesting that the longer cDTs may
contain core recognition sequences for two or more TFs.

Most cDTs discovered in this analysis represent elements
that are shared pairwise, i.e., by only two of the NB
enhancers examined (see the website for a list of cDTs that
are shared by only two of the enhancers examined). The
fact that the majority of cDTs are shared two ways, with
only a small subset of sequences being shared three or
more ways, suggests that the cis-regulation of early neural
precursor genes is carried out by a large number of factors
acting combinatorially and/or that many of the identified
cDTs may in fact represent interlocking sites for multiple

Neural specific cDTs that contain bHLH TF DNA-binding
sites
During Drosophila neurogenesis, bHLH proteins function
as proneural TFs to initiate neurogenesis in both the central and peripheral nervous system. TFs encoded by the
achaete-scute complex function in both systems, while the
related Atonal bHLH protein functions exclusively in the
PNS [31]. Different proneural bHLH TFs, acting together
with the ubiquitous dimerization partner Daughterless,
bind to distinct E-boxes that contain different core
sequences [32]. In addition to the core recognition
sequence, flanking bases are important to the DNA binding specificity of bHLH factors [33].

One of the principle observations of this study was that
the core central two bases of the hexameric E-box DNAbinding site (CANNTG; core bases are bold throughout)

were conserved in all the species used to generate the EvoPrint. All of the enhancers included in this study contained one or more conserved bHLH-binding sites (Table
3), with NB and PNS enhancers averaging 3.9 and 4.1
binding sites respectively. More than a third of the core
bases in NB bHLH sites contained a core GC sequence,
and more than a third of the core bases in PNS bHLH sites
contained either a core GC or a GG sequence. The most
common E-box among the NB CSBs was CAGCTG with
14 sites in four of the six enhancers. The CAGCTG and
CAGGTG E-boxes are high-affinity sites for Achaete/Scute
bHLH proteins [22,34]. However the CAGCTG site itself
is not specific to NB enhancers, as evidenced by its presence in four of the mesodermal enhancer CSBs characterized previously [11]. The most common bHLH-binding
site among PNS enhancers was also the CAGCTG E-box
with 11 occurrences in six of the 13 enhancers. In contrast,
the most common bHLH motif in enhancers of the
E(spl)-complex [25-28] was CAAGTG (data not shown),
with 16 occurrences in 8 of the 11 enhancers. CAGGTG,

previously shown to be an Atonal DNA-binding site [32],
was also common in E(spl) enhancers, with 9 occurrences
in 8 of the 13 enhancers, but was less prevalent among NB
enhancers. The CAGGTG box was also overrepresented in
PNS and E(spl) enhancers relative to its appearance in NB
enhancers, and it was also present in four of the characterized mesodermal enhancer CSBs. The CAGATG box was
present six times among PNS enhancers but not at all
among NB enhancers. Thus there appears to be some specificity of E-boxes in the different enhancer types. The fact
that each of these E-boxes is conserved in all the species in
the analysis, suggests that there is a high degree of specificity conferred by the E-box core sequence.
Our analysis also reveals that not only are the core bases
of E-boxes shared between similarly regulated enhancers,
but bases flanking the E-box were also found to be highly
conserved and are also frequently shared by these enhancers. Among the E-boxes found in CSBs of NB enhancers
(many are illustrated in Table 2) aaCAGCTG (core bases
of E-box are bold, flanking bases lower case) is repeated
three times in nerfin-1 and once in scrt; gCACTTG is
repeated three times in scrt; CAGCTGCA is repeated twice
in wor, and CAGCTGctg is repeated twice in scrt (see Fig 1).
In the dpn CNS NB enhancer, the E-box CAGCTG is found
twice, separated by a single base (CAGCTGaCAGCTG).
None of these sequences were present in mesodermal
enhancers examined, but each is found in PNS enhancers;
CAGCTGCA is repeated multiple times among PNS
enhancers. Among the conserved PNS enhancer E-boxes
(CAAATGca, gcCAAATG, cacCAAATGg, CACATGttg,
gCACGTGtgc, ttgCACGTG, agCACGTGcc, aCAGATG,
ggCAGATGt, CAGCTGccg, CAGCTGcaattt, gCAGGTGta
and cCAGGTGa) each, including flanking bases, is found
in two or three PNS enhancers, and these are distributed
among all 13 enhancers. Of these, only agCACGTGcc,
CAGCTGccg, cCAGGTGa were found once in our sample
of neuroblast enhancers and none were found in our sample of mesodermal enhancers. The sequence aaCAAGTG is
found in 4 E(spl) complex enhancers, those for E(spl)m8,
mγ, HLHmδ and m6, and the sequence aCAGCTGc is
found twice in E(spl)m8 and once in m4 and m6; neither
sequence was found in our mesodermal enhancers. There-

shared by all three types of enhancers, NB, PNS and
E(spl), when flanking bases are taken into account there
appears to be enhancer type-specific enrichment for different E-boxes.
Neural specific cDTs that contain Antennapedia class
homeodomain DNA-binding sites
Antennapedia class homeodomain proteins play essential
roles in multiple aspects of neural development including
cell proliferation and cell identity [35]. The segmental
identity of Drosophila NBs is conferred by input from TFs
encoded by homeotic loci of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes [36-38]. For example, ectopic expression of
abd-A, which specifies the NB6-4a lineage, down-regulates
levels of the G1 cyclin, CycE [38]. Loss of Polycomb group
factors has been shown to lead to aberrant derepression of
posterior Hox gene expression in postembryonic NBs,
which causes NB death and termination of proliferation
in the mutant clones [39].

We have examined the enhancer-type specificity of
sequences flanking the Antennapedia class core DNAbinding sequence, ATTA [40]. Nearly 25% of the NB and
PNS CSBs examined in this study contain this core recognition sequence. ATTA-containing sites were found multiple times in selected NB and PNS enhancers (Figure 1).
The cis-Decoder analysis identified 18 different neural
specific ATTA containing cDTs that were exclusively
shared by two or more PNS enhancers or CNS enhancers
and 10 were found to be shared between PNS and CNS.
The most common cDT, ATTAgca, was shared by two CNS
and two PNS enhancers (Figure 1; consensus homeodomain-binding sites are bold, flanking sequence lower
case). In addition, 6 homeodomain-binding site cDTs
were found twice in wor CSBs, aATTAccg, tttgaATTA, aatcaATTA, ATTAATctt and aaacaaATTAg, but not in other
CNS or PNS enhancer CSBs. In some cases these cDTs
were found repeated in given enhancer CSBs. Only one of
these cDTs aligned with CSBs of enhancers of the E(spl)
complex. Given that 2/3 of the occurrences of HOX sites
in these promoters can be accounted for by cDTs whose
flanking sequences are shared between enhancers, it is

taken into account. Three of the Pbx binding-site containing elements also exhibit ATTA Hox sites: 1) the
dodecamer GATGATTAATCT (Pbx site is ATGA, Hox sites
in bold) shared by the PNS enhancers edl and amos (references in Table 1), contains a homeodomain ATTA site that
overlaps the Pbx site by a single base, and 2) the smaller
heptamer ATGATTA, shared by pfe and ato, likewise contains a homeodomain ATTA site (bold) that overlaps
ATGA Pbx site by a single base. Adjacent Hox and Pbx sites
have been documented to facilitate synergy between the
two factors [44]. Taken together our findings suggest that,
as with homeodomain-binding sites, the conserved bases
flanking putative Pbx sites are functionally important.
These flanking bases are likely to confer different DNAbinding affinities for Pbx factors or are required for binding of other TFs.
Neural specific cDTs that contain Suppressor of Hairless
binding sites
Also indicating a degree of biological specificity of
enhancer types is the distribution of Suppressor of Hairless Su(H) binding sites among neural enhancers. Su(H)
is the Notch pathway effector TF of Drosophila [45]. The
members of the E(spl) complex, both the multiple basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) repressor genes and the Bearded
family members, have been shown to be Su(H) dependent [23,26]. The consensus in vitro DNA binding site for
Su(H) is RTGRGAR (where R = A or G) [25]. Notch signaling via Su(H) occurs through conserved single or paired
sites [46] and the presence of conserved sites for other

In summary, the appearance of Hox sites in the context of
conserved sequences shared by functionally related
enhancers suggests that the specificity of consensus homeodomain-binding sites is conferred by adjacent bases,
either through recognition of adjacent bases by the TF
itself or in conjunction with one or more co-factors.
Neural specific cDTs that contain Pbx/Extradenticle sites
Examination of the cDTs from Drosophila NB and PNS
enhancers revealed that many contained the core Pbx/
Extradenticle docking site ATGA [41,42]. In Drosophila,
Extradenticle has been shown to have Hox-dependent and
independent functions [43]. Studies have also shown that
Pbx factors provide DNA-binding specificity for homeodomain TFs, facilitating specification of distinct structures
along the body axis [43]. In the CNS enhancers of Drosophila, most predicted Pbx/Extradenticle sites are not,
however, found adjacent to Hox sites.

Our analysis revealed that 8 of the Pbx motifs were shared
between CNS and PNS enhancer types, and 16 were
shared between similarly expressed enhancers (Figure 2),
thus indicating that there appears to be some degree of
specificity to Pbx site function when flanking bases are

transcription regulators associated with CSBs containing
Su(H) binding sites has been documented [47].

flanking sequences are important for the unique Su(H)
function at any particular site.

Within the CSBs of the six NB enhancers examined, only
two, dpn and wor, contained conserved putative Su(H)binding sites; two dpn sites matched one of the Su(H) consensus sites (GTGGGAA) and two wor sites match the
sequence ATGGGAA. Only one of the two dpn sites contained flanking bases conforming to the widely distributed CGTGGGAA site of E(spl) Su(H) binding sites and
none of the NB enhancers contained paired Su(H) sites
typical of the E(spl) enhancers [25,46]. Of the 13 PNS cisregulatory regions examined, only four enhancers contained putative Su(H)-binding sites [sna and ato
(ATGGGAA), brd (GTGGGAG)] and dpn (GTGGGAA).
dpn also contained a pair of sites that conforms to the SPS
configuration frequently found in Su(H) enhancers (CSB
sequence: AATGTGAGAAAAAAACTTTCTCACGATCACCTT, Su(H) sites in bold, Pbx site is ATCA). The lack of
Su(H) sites in PNS enhancers was noted by Reeves and
Posakony [23], who suggested that these enhancers are
directly regulated by the proneural proteins but not activated in response to Notch-mediated lateral inhibitory
signaling. Among the conserved sequences of E(spl) gene
enhancers there is an average of 3.4 consensus Su(H)
binding sites per enhancer, with most enhancers containing both types of sites, i.e., those with either A or G in the
central position (data not shown).

A second finding was the extensive conservation of bases
flanking the consensus Su(H) sequence in the E(spl) complex genes (data not shown). For example, the cDT
GTGGGAAACACACGAC [Su(H) site bold] was present in
HLHm3 and HLHm5 enhancer CSBs, and ACCGTGGGAAAC was conserved in HLHm3 and HLHmβ
enhancers. The conservation of bases flanking the consensus Su(H) binding site suggests that the Su(H) site may be
flanked by additional binding sites for co-operative or
competitive factors, or else, that Su(H) contacts additional
bases besides the consensus heptamer.

We offer three insights with respect to Su(H) binding sites.
First, although in vitro DNA-binding studies suggest there
is a flexibility in the Su(H) binding site, like the bHLH Ebox, comparative analysis shows that within any one the
Su(H) sites there is no sequence flexibility. Except for the
pair of Su(H) sites in the dpn PNS enhancer, none of the
CNS or PNS sites contained a central A; less that a quarter
of the E(spl) sites consisted of a central A, and all these
were conserved across all species examined. In light of the
high conservation in these regions the invariant core and

A third observation is that in most cases Su(H) binding
sites are imbedded in larger CSBs, suggesting that CSB
function is regulated by the integrated function of multiple TFs. For example the dpn NB enhancer Su(H) site is
imbedded in a CSB of 24 bases, and the atonal PNS
enhancer Su(H) site is imbedded in a CSB of 45 bases. In
the E(spl) complex, CSB #6 of HLHmγ, consisting of 30
bases and CSB#13 of m8, consisting of 31 bases (each
contains a GTGGGAA Su(H) site, a CACGAG element,
conforming to a Hairy N-box consensus CACNAG
[48,49], and an AGGA Tramtrack (Ttk) DNA-binding core
recognition sequence [50], but the order and context of
these three sites is different for each enhancer). Although
Su(H) binding sites were present in only a minority of NB
and PNS enhancers, the conservation of core bases, as well
as the complexity of their flanking conserved sequences
points to a diversity of Su(H) function and interaction
with other factors.
Neural specific cDTs that contain core DNA-binding sites
for other known TFs
Two of these elements, one exclusively present in NB
enhancers (CAGGATA) and a second exclusively present
in PNS enhancers (GTAGGA), contained consensus core

AGGA DNA-binding sites for Ttk [50], a BTB domain TF
that has been shown to regulate pair rule genes during segmentation and to repress neural cell fates [51-53].
Another site (CACCCCA), shared by both NB and PNS
enhancers, conforms to the consensus binding site of IA1 (ACCCCA), the vertebrate homolog of nerfin-1 [54].
Most of the cDTs of Table 2 do not contain sequences corresponding to consensus binding-sites of known regulators of NB expression. The fact that they are represented
multiple times in NB CSB sequences suggests that they
contain binding sites for unknown regulators of neurogenesis in Drosophila.
Neural-enriched cDTs
Neural enriched cDTs that are shared between multiple
NB enhancers and also exhibit a low frequency in the sample of mesodermal enhancers examined in this study serve
as a resource for understanding enhancer elements that
may not have an exclusive neural function [see Additional
file 1]. Notable here is the presence of CAGCTG bHLH
DNA binding sites (all with flanking A, CC and TC) and
Antennapedia class homeobox (Hox) core DNA binding
site ATTA [40], as well as additional Ttk and Pbx/Extradenticle sites. Present in this list are portions of sequences
conforming to Su(H) binding sites described above. Of
particular interest in this table are sequences that are also
enriched in the PNS (p); these sites may bind factors that
play similar developmental roles in different tissues. For
example, the presumptive Ttk site, AAAGGA (core
sequence in bold) is highly enriched in segmental enhancers. Thus, some of these sites can be identified as targets of
known TFs, but the identity of most are as yet unknown.
These elements shared by multiple enhancers may be use-

ful in identifying other enhancers driving expression in
NBs.
cis-Decoder analysis reveals a complex sub-structure of
enhancer CSBs
EvoPrint analysis revealed that all of the enhancer regions
examined in this study contained multiple CSBs that were
greater that 15 to 20 bases in length. The occurrence of
overlapping DNA-binding sites for different TFs is currently the best explanation for the maintenance of intact
CSB sequences across ~160 millions of years of collective
species divergence. Our analysis has revealed that the
sequence context, order and orientation of shared cDTs
can differ between co-regulating enhancers.

Two examples are given here of the complex contextual
appearance of cDTs that appear frequently in CNS and
PNS enhancers (Figure 3). Each of the eight CSBs shown
was nearly fully 'covered' by cDTs of the NB library (data
not shown), suggesting that each contains multiple overlapping binding sites for a number of TFs. First, examination of the distribution of cDT GCTGCA reveals that it
overlaps, by one and two bases, adjacent but different
consensus bHLH sites in scrt CSB#32, while in scrt CSB#23
it overlaps a third consensus bHLH sequence by two
bases. In the PNS enhancer char, in CSB#17, GCTGCA
overlaps a bHLH site, but in a different configuration
(overlapping four bases) than found in the two CNS
enhancers illustrated in Figure 3A. In amos CSB#26, GCTGCA appears adjacent to a HOX site and does not overlap
a bHLH site. Second, examination of the distribution of
the cDT GGCACG reveals that it overlaps different consensus bHLH sites in scrt CSB#32 and wor CSB#106, overlapping the bHLH site in the former by one base and in the
latter by four bases. GGCACG overlaps a CAGCTG bHLHbinding site in rho CSB#18, but in a different configuration than the overlap with CAGCTG in the wor CSB. In the
PNS enhancer scrt, GGCACG in CSB#5 overlaps a Hairy
site N-box (consensus CACNAG) [48,49]. N-boxes were
most common in E(spl) CSBs, but were also present in NB
and PNS enhancer CSBs. In these two examples, and others we have examined, there is no consistent spatial constraints to the association of known TF-binding sites (i.e.,

bHLH-binding E-box sites) with novel cDTs; a picture that
emerges is one of combinatorial complexity, in which
known or novel cDTs are associated with each other in different contexts on different CSBs.
As an initial step toward determining if different TFs interacted with one another or competed for flanking DNAbinding sites, we examined the proximity of known binding sites to one another in CSBs for bHLH, Hox, Pbx and
Su(H). The results of this analysis for NB CSBs are shown
in Table 4; data for other enhancer types is summarized
here. Most striking was the presence of multiple adjacent
Hox ATTA sites (10 instances on NB CSBs) and combinations of Hox and Pbx sites (9 instances NB CSBs). A typical
example is the association of one Pbx site, a bHLH site
and two Hox sites on a wor NB enhancer CSB (AATCATTTGTAATAATTAG; Pbx site is ATCA, Hox sites are TAAT and
ATTA, and bHLH site is bold). Associations of Hox and
Pbx sites was also apparent in PNS enhancer CSBs, and in
addition there was a high level of combined Hox and
bHLH sites (11 instances on PNS CSBs), but in E(spl)
enhancers only a higher level of the combination of Hox
and Pbx sites (8 instances) was apparent. An example of
the association of Hox and bHLH sites in a PNS enhancer
is found in an achaete-scute dorso-central enhancer CSB
(CAAAACAACACTTGCTCTATTAAC; bHLH site in bold
and Hox site is ATTA). There was also a distinctly higher
level of Pbx sites on the same CSBs as bHLH sites in NBs
CSBs (6 instances), but this combination was not apparent for PNS or E(spl) CSBs. Association of bHLH sites with
Su(H) binding sites was apparent in E(spl) enhancer
CSBs, especially when presence on adjacent CSBs (14
instances) was taken into account. Only in one of the 7
instances of paired Su(H) sites on E(spl) enhancers were
these sites on the same CSBs, while in four other instances
they were on adjacent CSBs. Although we often find sites
in close proximity, both known and functionally uncharacterized sites are, with a few exceptions, not present in
fixed uniform orientation in similarly regulated enhancers. This highlights the complex combinatorial arrangement and position flexibility of TF-binding sites within
enhancer CSBs.
The use of cis-Decoder, FlyEnhancer and EvoPrinter to
identify novel enhancers
We have used the information derived from cis-Decoder
analysis of neural precursor cell enhancers to search for
other genomic sequences with similar cis-regulatory properties. Having identified cDTs found multiple times
among NB enhancers, we used the genomic search tool
FlyEnhancer [55] to identify Drosophila melanogaster
genomic sequences that contained clusters of the following cDTs (number in parenthesis is the total number of
each cDT in our sample of six NB enhancers): GGCACG
(6), GGAATC (4), TGACAG (6), TGGGGT (4), CAGCTG

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/371

(14), TGATTT (9) CAAGTG (7), CATATTT (5), TGATCC
(7) and CTAAGC (6). As a lower limit, a minimum of
three CAGCTG bHLH sites was set for this search, because
of the prevalence of this site in nerfin-1 and deadpan NB
enhancers. Each sequence detected by this search was subjected to EvoPrinter analysis to determine the extent of its
sequence conservation. Among the cDT clusters identified, our search identified a 5' region adjacent to the nervy
gene ([] that contained three conserved CAGCTG sites as
well five other sites identical to TGACAG, GGAATC,
TGGGGT, GGCACG and CATATTT (see below). nervy,
originally identified as a target of homeotic gene regulation, is expressed in a subset of early CNS NBs, as well as
in PNS SOP cells [56]. Later studies have implicated nervy,
along with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)dependent protein kinase (PKA) in antagonizing Sema1a-PlexA-mediated axonal repulsion [57], and nervy has
been shown to promote mechanosensory organ development by enhancing Notch signaling [58].
EvoPrinter analysis revealed that the cluster of neural precursor cell enhancer cDTs positioned 90 bp upstream
from the nervy transcribed sequence contains highly conserved sequences (Figure 4A; chr2R:20,162,55620,163,290). This region contains 10 CSBs that include
six conserved E-boxes, three of which conform to the
CAGCTG sequence that was prominent in nerfin-1 and
deadpan promoters. To determine if this region functions
as a neural precursor cell enhancer, we generated transformant lines containing the nervy CSB cluster linked to a
minimal promoter/GFP reporter transgene (see methods
section). Our analysis of the reporter expression driven by
the nervy upstream fragment revealed a pattern indistinguishable from early nervy mRNA expression [56] (Figure
5). Specifically, we detected expression in a large subset of
early delaminating NBs and in SOPs and secondary precursor cells of the PNS. Significantly, the nervy enhancer,
unlike nerfin-1 and deadpan NB enhancers, activates
reporter expression in then PNS and not just in early NBs.
A new cDT-library was generated combining the nervy
enhancer CSBs and the NB and PNS enhancer CSBs used
to generate the libraries described above. The new cDTs,
along with the previously defined cDTs were aligned back
to nervy CSBs (Figure 4b). Most cDTs were found only
once in previously examined NB or PNS CSBs, but 21
cDTs appeared in our original analysis, described above,
that did not include the nervy enhancer. The addition of
this new enhancer to our analysis resulted in the discovery
of a significant number of cDTs that had not been found
previously. Three cDTs that were identified in the previous
analysis, tCAGCTGc, cagCAGCTG and aaCAGCTG, contain bHLH DNA-binding sites (central bases of E-box in
bold, flanking sequence are lower case). Aligning cDTs
that are specific to the CNS or PNS may indicate

sequences required to specifically drive expression in
either the CNS or PNS.

Conclusion
The major finding of this study is that enhancers of co-regulated genes in neural precursor cells possess complex
combinatorial arrangements of highly conserved cDT elements. Comparisons between NB and PNS enhancers
identified CNS and PNS type-specific cDTs and cDTs that
were enriched in one or another enhancer type. cisDecoder analysis also revealed that many of the conserved
sequences contain DNA-binding sites for classical regulators of neurogenesis, including bHLH, Hox, Pbx, and
Su(H) factors. Although in vitro DNA-binding studies
have shown that many of these factors have a certain
degree of flexibility in the sequences to which they bind,
defined in terms of a position weight matrix [60], our
studies show that for any given appearance these sites are
actually highly conserved across all species of the Drosophila genus. The genus invariant conservation in many
of these characterized binding sites indicates that there are
distinct constraints to that sequence in terms of its function.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/371

The high degree of conservation displayed in the enhancer
CSBs could derive from unique sequence requirements of
individual TFs, or the intertwined nature of multiple
DNA-binding sites for different TFs. Thus there is a higher
degree of biological specificity to these sites than the flexibility that is detected using in vitro DNA-binding studies.
As an example, the requirement for a specific core for the
bHLH binding site, i.e., for a CAGCTG E-box for nerfin-1,
deadpan and nervy, suggests that it is the TF itself that
demands sequence conservation; however, the requirement for conserved flanking sequences suggests that additional specific factors may be involved. Although the
inter-species conservation of core and flanking sites has
been noted by others [25], the extent of this conservation
is rather surprising. To what extent and how evolutionary
changes in enhancer function take place, given the conservation of core enhancer sequences, remains a question for
future investigation.
In addition to classic regulators of neurogenesis, cisDecoder reveals additional conserved novel elements that
are widely distributed or only detected in pairs of enhancers. Many of these novel elements flank known transcription binding motifs in one CSB, but appear independent
of known motifs in another. The appearance of novel elements in multiple contexts suggests that they may represent DNA-binding sites for additional factors that are
essential for enhancer function. Only through discovery
of the factors binding these sequences will it become clear
what role they play in enhancer function.
Preliminary functional analysis of CSBs within the nerfin1 neuroblast enhancer reveals that CSBs carry out different
regulatory roles (Alexander Kuzin, unpublished results).
Altering cDT sequences within the nerfin-1 CSBs reveals
that most are required for cell-specific activation or repression or for normal enhancer expression levels. CSB swapping studies reveals that, for the most part, the order and
arrangement of a number of tested CSBs was not important for enhancer function in reporter studies. The discovery of the nervy neural enhancer by searching the genome
with commonly occurring NB cDTs underscores the
potential use of EvoPrinter and cis-Decoder analysis for the
identification of additional neural enhancers. By starting
with known enhancers and building cDT libraries from
their CSBs, one now has the ability to search for other
genes expressed during any biological event.

Methods
Generation of EvoPrints and CSB-libraries
EvoPrinter analysis was performed as described [10,61].
This analysis used EvoPrinterHD (please see Availability &
requirements for more information) a second-generation
EvoPrinter program that uses an enhanced-BLAT algorithm
for increased resolution of conserved sequences [61].

Detailed instructions are provided at the EvoPrinter web
site.
When possible, all twelve Drosophila species were used for
the EvoPrint analysis, while species that exhibited
sequencing gaps were excluded. CSBs within enhancers
were curated from either an EvoPrint, which reveals bases
conserved in all species, or a relaxed print (also known as
an EvoDifference profile) that identifies base pairs that are
conserved in all but one of the species. The collective evolutionary divergence for all of the EvoPrints was greater
than 140 My and in most cases, when all twelve species
were included in the analysis, EvoPrints represented over
~200 My of additive divergence. With the exception of two
NB enhancers, scrt and wor, the size of each curated
sequence was less than 1800 bases (Table 1). CSBs of 6 bp
or longer were extracted from the EvoPrints using EvoPrint parser to generate CSB libraries. The number of CSBs
in each enhancer, enhancer length, and relation of the
enhancer with respect to the transcriptional start site is
shown in Table 1. Lists of CSBs for each library are given
at the cis-Decoder web site (please see Availability &
requirements for more information).
Generation of cis-Decoder Tag libraries
In order to focus the analysis on neural-specific and neural-enriched cDTs, those cDTs that were found at high frequency in non-neural (mesodermal) enhancers were
placed in a shared/common cDT-library. To identify neural specific cDT elements, the frequency of cDTs was
scored against an out-group of mesodermal CSBs [11],
and subsequently the common elements were removed.
Prior to removal of mesodermal cDTs, the number of NB
cDTs was 856, whereas after removal of shared cDTs, the
number dropped to 272, indicating that the majority of
cDTs shared by NB enhancers were also present in mesodermal enhancers.

Three cDT-libraries were generated by alignment of NB,
PNS and E(spl) CSBs and are provided at the cis-Decoder
web site (please see Availability & requirements for more
information). The number of cDTs in each library was
272, 333 and 226 respectively. Of the 272 NB cDTs, less
than half (120) aligned exclusively with NB CSBs, and did
not align with PNS or E(spl) CSB sequences. Only 21% of
the NB cDTs corresponded to PNS tags – in other words
only 21% of the NB tags aligned two times or more with
PNS CSBs.
Cytoscape analysis
We have adapted the biomolecular interaction network
software Cytoscape [62] in order to display shared cDTs
from different enhancer CSBs. The following data structure was used: node1 xx node2, where node1 is the name
of an enhancer, xx refers to any designator and node2 is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/371

the cDT sequence. This data structure facilitates the display of enhancer identity and shared sequence elements
in an interactive pattern. Cytoscape analysis requires elimination of the reverse complements of cDTs in order to
avoid duplicate representation. To eliminate duplicate
reverse-complement cDTs, we used the program cDTUncomplementer (please see Availability & requirements
for more information). After removing duplicates, cDTcataloger was used to name each node according to the
enhancer aligning with that cDT.
Identification of novel neural precursor cell enhancers
To identify novel enhancers that direct gene expression in
neural precursor cells, we curated cDTs that were shared
by multiple identified NB enhancers and submitted them
to the web-based genomic search tool FlyEnhancer [55], to
discover other genomic regions with similar densities of
cDTs. Candidate sequences that contained densities of
cDTs alignments were subject to EvoPrinterHD analysis to
determine the extent of conservation. Candidate enhancer
regions were selected for enhancer/reporter studies.
Generation and analysis of nervy enhancer/reporter
transformant lines
Genomic DNA containing the putative nervy enhancer
(734 bp) was amplified by PCR using standard methods.
Primers for the nervy upstream region including BglII and
Nhe1 sites (bold) were respectively AGATCTCTAAAGC
CCTCGATGTGCCC (5') and GCTAGCTCCGACCAGTCGTAAGTGGCG (3'). Fragments were gel purified and
cloned into the pCRII-TOPO double promoter vector.
Sequencing verified the fidelity of the PCR and cloning.
After cutting with Bgl and Nhe1, gel purification was performed and fragments were cloned into pH-Stinger [63].
Details of our procedure are available upon request. The
generation of transformant lines and embryo immunohistochemistry were carried out as described previously [64].
