With the current global focus on bioenergy, forest plantations are increasingly becoming important sources for
second generation biofuel, where the whole plant lignocellulosic biomass is to be mobilized. The lignocellulosic
biomass is mainly composed of secondary walls (SW)
possessing unique characteristics (biochemical composition and tridimensional association of polymers), which
govern the intrinsic properties of wood. They especially
contain high amounts of lignins, hydrophobic phenolic
polymers which constitute an obstacle to the optimal
utilization of plant species in paper industry and for saccharification prior to bioethanol production. Among
perennial species, Eucalyptus species grow very fast and
produce high yields of lignocellulosic biomass. They
represent the main industrial plantations in the worldand one of the most appealing lignocellulosic feedstock
for bioenergy production. Dissection of the molecular
switches controlling the coordinated lignin biosynthetic
genes is therefore of utmost importance to understand
the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue specific
deposition of lignin and be able to improve secondary
cell wall properties.
With the objective of improving Eucalyptus wood
quality to better-fit industrial applications, we are focusing our efforts towards the identification and functional
characterisation of regulatory genes controlling the biosynthesis of the cell wall polymers (mainly lignins).
We performed a precise mapping and functional characterization of the cis-regulatory elements contained in
the promoters of two genes encoding key and consecutive steps of the lignin biosynthetic pathway i.e. Cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) and Cinnamyl Alcohol

dehydrogenase (CAD) (Rahantamala et al, 2010). Our
results supported a major role for the MYB transcription factors (TF) consensus sites in the control of the
coordinated expression of these two genes. The functional analysis of two MYB factors (EgMYB1 and
EgMYB2) preferentially expressed in Eucalyptus xylem
revealed that they are able to bind specifically to these
promoters and regulate transcriptionin vivo. EgMYB1
behaves as a repressor whereas EgMYB2 is an activator
(Goicoechea et al, 2005, Legay et al, 2010) of the lignin
biosynthetic genes but also of the secondary wall biosynthesis. Indeed, both MYBs were shown recently to be
master genes regulating the entire secondary wall biosynthetic program including cellulose, xylan and lignin
genes (Zhong et al, 2010; Legay et al 2010). The presence of both positive and negative regulators in Eucalyptus xylem offers the possibility of a combinatorial
control of gene expression that could provide the necessary flexibility to ensure tight temporal and spatial regulation of lignin biosynthesis or secondary cell wall.
To address this question and get a deeper insight the
complex regulation of the SW formation in Eucalyptus,
we are now studying the regulation of these two MYBs
including fine spatial and temporal expression, identification of their direct targets genes and of their protein partners. We have constructed a yeast-two-hybrid library
from Eucalyptus xylem that will also be instrumental for
deciphering the interactants of landmark genes for the
International Eucalyptus community. Thanks to the
recent release of the E. grandis genome (Eucalyptus
grandis Genome Project 2010, http://www.phytozome.
net/eucalyptus), we have performed a genome-wide survey of the large R2R3-MYB superfamily. The phylogenetic comparison of this family with Arabidopsis, rice,
poplar and grapevine showed a marked expansion of
some clusters putatively involved in wood-related

processes. Some R2R3 MYB genes seem to be specific of
woody plants. The spatiotemporal expression patterns of
members of such clusters are currently being studied.
Although Auxin is known as a key regulator of cambium
activity and wood formation, the Auxin response mediators [Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) and Auxin
Response Factor (ARF) transcription factors] extensively
characterized in model plants, are still largely uncharacterized in tree species. We have identified 23 Aux/IAA
and 17 ARF in the E. grandis genome. Comparative phylogenetic analysis revealed that several Aux/IAA and ARF
subgroups have differentially expanded or contracted
amongst the three dicotyledonous plants studied (Arabidopsis, Populus and Eucalyptus). Expression analysis and
EST database surveys are currently underway to explore
the transcript levels of each member in the different
organs and tissues of Eucalyptus at key developmental
stages as well as in response to hormonal treatments and
to environmental stresses. Further functional genomics
studies conducted on new candidate transcription factors, their regulation under the developmental or environmental stimuli will help identifying major factors
underpinning the physicochemical properties of cell
walls, the recalcitrance of which remains a key scientific
challenge for establishing highly efficient, sustainably
produced, second-generation biofuels.
