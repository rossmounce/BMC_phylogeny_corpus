Abstract
Background: The metagenomic analysis of microbial communities holds the potential to improve
our understanding of the role of microbes in clinical conditions. Recent, dramatic improvements in
DNA sequencing throughput and cost will enable such analyses on individuals. However, such
advances in throughput generally come at the cost of shorter read-lengths, limiting the
discriminatory power of each read. In particular, classifying the microbial content of samples by
sequencing the < 1,600 bp 16S rRNA gene will be affected by such limitations.
Results: We describe a method for identifying the phylogenetic content of bacterial samples using
high-throughput Pyrosequencing targeted at the 16S rRNA gene. Our analysis is adapted to the
shorter read-lengths of such technology and uses a database of 16S rDNA to determine the most
specific phylogenetic classification for reads, resulting in a weighted phylogenetic tree characterizing
the content of the sample. We present results for six samples obtained from the human vagina
during pregnancy that corroborates previous studies using conventional techniques.
Next, we analyze the power of our method to classify reads at each level of the phylogeny using
simulation experiments. We assess the impacts of read-length and database completeness on our
method, and predict how we do as technology improves and more bacteria are sequenced. Finally,
we study the utility of targeting specific 16S variable regions and show that such an approach
considerably improves results for certain types of microbial samples. Using simulation, our method
can be used to determine the most informative variable region.
Conclusion: This study provides positive validation of the effectiveness of targeting 16S
metagenomes using short-read sequencing technology. Our methodology allows us to infer the
most specific assignment of the sequence reads within the phylogeny, and to identify the most
discriminative variable region to target. The analysis of high-throughput Pyrosequencing on human
flora samples will accelerate the study of the relationship between the microbial world and
ourselves.

Background
Metagenomics enables the genomic study of microbial
communities that are sampled directly from their environment, eliminating the need for isolating and cultivating
specific microbes [1-3]. Metagenomic analyses of human
flora samples [4] are a new type of assay with intriguing
potential applications for the diagnosis and prediction of
clinical outcomes [5]. Studies of human vaginal bacterium during pregnancy so far include the use of direct culture methods and conventional PCR studies of clinically
suspected infectious microorganisms. Although infection
and inflammation likely play a major role in the pathogenesis of preterm labor and delivery [6,7], these studies
reveal only a fraction of the potential microorganic inhabitants. A comprehensive identification and catalog of
these organisms will enable future investigators to target a
defined population of species that may be correlated with
preterm labor, premature rupture of amniotic membranes, chorioamnionitis, and other complications of
pregnancy [8-12].
Metagenomics analyses will become increasingly practical
as DNA sequencing costs fall dramatically with the advent
of new technologies [13,14] including Pyrosequencing™
[15]. One challenge common to these revolutionary
sequencing technologies is the short length of reads,
which limits the amount of unique, discriminating
sequence available within each read. Sequencing the 16S
rRNA gene (16S rDNA) using conventional Sanger
sequencing produces reads of at least 500 bp in length,
which is sufficient to identify the precise source species for
each gene [3]. In fact, though there is a danger of producing chimeras, the reads are often long enough that they
can be assembled into near-complete 16S rDNA
sequences [16]. Despite the promise of high-throughput
technologies like Pyrosequencing, current versions produce short reads, making the accurate identification of the
source of these reads a daunting task. One solution used
chip-based Pyrosequencing targeted at a small variable
region within the 16S rDNA to show that there exists a
much greater variety of rare microorganisms than previously thought [17].
We describe a methodology for phylogenetic classification based on short, 16S rRNA gene sequence reads and
apply the technique to reads obtained via high-throughput, chip-based Pyrosequencing of human vaginal flora
samples during pregnancy. The resulting phylogenetic
trees reveal the vast diversity of bacterial inhabitants seen
in other studies, and will assist in future investigations of
the link between microorganisms and pregnancy complications. Next, we examine the ability of our methodology
to classify reads at different levels in the phylogeny and
discuss limitations of our technique. Using simulations,
we study the effect of read-length on our methodology to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/108

understand the consequence of using high-throughput
Pyrosequencing instead of conventional technologies.
Finally, we explore the effectiveness of isolating specific
16S variable regions using validated universal primers.
Our methodology for analyzing short 16S rDNA sequence
reads will enable the accurate and informative study of
human flora samples using new, high-throughput
sequencing technologies.

Results and Discussion
Methodology overview
Twelve samples from vaginal epithelial tissue and discharge from pregnant women in all three trimesters were
collected. DNA extraction was performed, followed by target-specific PCR amplification of approximately 1500 bp
of the 16S rDNA using universal primers. The products
were subjected to nebulization and clonal amplification,
followed by Pyrosequencing of six samples with the
Genome Sequencer 20 system (454 Life Sciences). As a
result, 100,000 to 200,000 sequence reads of 100 bp average length were obtained for each of the six samples
(details are provided in Additional file 1).

In this paper, we independently determine for every read
the most specific classification within the bacterial phylogeny, and produce a weighted tree that expresses the
phylogenetic makeup of the sample. For each read, we use
BLAT, the BLAST-like alignment tool [18], to search for
homology against a database of bacterial 16S rDNA
sequences obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project
[19] and archaeal 16S rDNA sequence from prokMSA [20].
We score each resulting homology between the read and a
16S rDNA sequence from the database, filter out weak
homologies, and thus produce a set of possible organisms
from which the read was obtained. Finally, we assign the
read to the most specific location within the phylogeny
that includes all these potential organisms (details of this
algorithm are described in Methods). By assigning all
reads to the phylogeny with the above procedure, we construct a weighted phylogeny representing the 16S rDNA
content of the sample. This process is depicted in Figure 1.
Further analysis of bacterial samples involving the translation of read counts to organism concentrations must be
undertaken conservatively due to the following caveats.
First, there may be an amplification bias of 16S rDNA
sequence due to differences in primer annealing preference. Also, variation in 16S rDNA multiplicity in diverse
bacterial genomes, among other complications, may
result in the over- or under-representation of certain
organisms' 16S sequences [18,21].
Our ability to place reads in the phylogeny has two distinct limitations, namely short read-length and unrepresented organisms in the 16S rDNA sequence database.

Methodology overview
Methodology overview. After collecting the bacterial sample, DNA is extracted followed by amplification of 16S rDNA
using universal primers. These fragments are then sequenced with high-throughput Pyrosequencing. Each read is queried
against a database of known 16S rDNA sequence (mostly obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project) using the program
BLAT and assigned to the most specific and confident node in the phylogeny. Accumulating all the reads in this fashion yields a
weighted phylogenetic tree characterizing the bacterial content of the sample.
Short read-lengths often lead to high-fidelity matches to
multiple 16S sequences in the database. This situation
occurs whenever the region from which the read was sampled is highly similar across species of a given genus, family, or even phylum. In this case we are resolution-limited in
placing a read below a certain depth in the phylogeny. On

the other hand, because of the incomplete nature of the
16S rDNA database, a read may not match in its entire
length to any known 16S sequence. However, since we
believe a priori that all reads are derived from amplified
16S rDNA sequences, the closest partial matches of the
read to known organisms still allow us to assign the read

to the subtree that contains these organisms, although its
placement below that level is labeled unknown.
Sample analysis
Samples subjected to the above analysis demonstrated
substantial overlap with similar studies previously
reported [16], as well as significant differences between
the samples. Weighted phylogenetic trees obtained from
applying our analysis to the six samples are shown in
Additional file 2. Figure 2 presents a composite tree generated by accumulating these six trees in equal proportions.
Starting from the top, the width of the tree edges represents the proportion of reads that can be confidently
placed at that level in the phylogeny. A tree edge that fades
into white represents reads that were resolution-limited
below that level, while reads whose placement is
unknown below a particular node are represented by tree
edges that fade into black. In Figure 3 we list the top 30

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/108

genera discovered in the six samples and identify the proportions of reads belonging to these genera within each
sample. Corroborating other studies performed on vaginal bacterial flora, we identified Lactobacillus as the dominant genus and detected a significant presence of other
genera, including Psychrobacter, Magnetobacterium, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, and Veillonella [16]. Aside from the
common presence of Lactobacillus, each sample exhibited
a unique profile of other bacteria, which may be useful in
the future for diagnosing abnormal conditions such as
vaginosis [5] or predicting the onset of preterm labor [6].
Additional file 3 lists the top 30 genera identified in each
sample along with the percentage of reads classified
within the genera.
In Figure 4 we graph our ability to classify reads into a particular branch at each level of the phylogeny. For those
reads that cannot be classified we show the proportion

and results were aggregated in a single tree. Branch widths indicate the proportion of reads assigned down those branches in
the phylogeny. Branches fading into white represent reads that are resolution limited due to similarity among multiple subbranches in the phylogeny. Branches fading into black represent reads that do not have full-length homology with any known
16S sequence.

that is resolution-limited versus unknown. Figure 5 plots
these results for each sample separately. Our methodology recognizes 89 – 97% of the reads in each sample as
bacterial and fewer than 2% as archaeal; the remaining
reads are unrecognizable in our database. While we were
able to categorize the genus of 28 – 39% of the reads, only
3 – 12% could be identified with a particular species.
Under-representation of 16S rDNA sequence in the database appears to be our dominant limitation in identifying
reads at the levels of domain through genus. Fortunately,
we expect this limitation to diminish as more 16S rDNA
sequences are added to the database. Our ability to identify a particular species, however, is primarily resolutionlimited due to the overwhelming similarity between species within a genus.
Effect of read-length
To study the effect of read-length on our ability to place
reads in the phylogeny, we simulated the sampling of
reads from hypothetical profiles of bacteria for a range of
read-lengths from 30 to 800 bp. We analyzed reads sam-

pled from two distinct profiles of bacteria: a random profile
of 387 diverse bacteria selected from across the entire
known phylogenetic tree and a sample profile with concentrations of 330 bacteria derived from the analysis of our
six samples. The results of applying our methodology to
these samples are graphed Figure 6. Solid lines show the
proportion of reads that were placed within a particular
branch at each level of the phylogeny. Dotted lines with
the same color show the proportion of reads that were correctly placed at each level. As both graphs illustrate, readlengths of 30 and 60 bp are not very effective for discriminating between different bacteria, even at such a broad
level as phylum and class.
For the sample profile of bacteria our ability to identify genera improves substantially when read-lengths are
increased beyond 100 bp due to the high degree of similarity between bacteria in the actual samples we examined
(Figure 6b). At 800 bp, we are able to accurately determine
almost all of the reads at the genus level, and also correctly
determine the species for over half of the reads. As dem-

onstrated in Figure 6b, running the simulation for 100 bp
read-lengths closely reproduced the read resolution graph
obtained from our six samples, which lends confidence to
the stability of the methodology.
For the more diverse, random profile of bacteria, the 16S
rDNA sequences are sufficiently different that readlengths greater than 100 bp do not provide much additional benefit (Figure 6a). A read-length of 100 bp, which
corresponds to sample data presented here, appears to be
competitive with even the longest read-length of 800 bp.
Thus, with a very wide diversity of bacteria, it seems that
our methodology does not require much greater readlengths than 100 bp. In practice, however, the sample profile may be more relevant, and therefore longer reads are
desirable to improve the resolution of read placement.
There is evidence to suggest that the classification of species within the RDP phylogeny has errors that limit the
ability of our methodology to unambiguously classify
reads down to the lowest levels of the phylogeny. As an
example, suppose we have two species A and B that truly
belong to the same genus X, but that species B was misclassified in genus Y. Then, a read that matches both species A and B will be assigned to the family of genera X and
Y or an even broader classification. A more accurate database classification will improve the ability of our methodology to identify the genera of the reads.

Restriction to variable regions
Our reads often sampled regions in the 16S rDNA that are
indistinguishable between species, genera, and even
phyla. Restricting the sequencing to short, specific variable regions within the 16S sequence can provide more
informative reads [22]. We performed further simulations
to assess the effectiveness of such an approach for 100 bplong Pyrosequencing reads, designing primers for amplifying seven regions each containing one of the 16S rDNA
variable regions V1 – V6 and V9, and one region containing V7 and V8 [23]. We describe the construction and verification of the primers in Methods and list the eight
amplified regions in Table 1. Figure 7 graphs the read resolution and accuracy results. In both graphs, the bold,
black line shows the simulation results when we sample
the reads from across the entire 16S rDNA sequence
instead of restricting it to a particular variable region.

For the random profile of bacteria we could slightly
improve our resolving power by restricting reads to
shorter variable regions, particularly with region V1 (Figure 7a). For the more realistic sample profile, by choosing
the appropriate variable region we could improve results
dramatically and achieve a resolution similar to 150 – 200
bp reads sampled from across the entire 16S gene. When
reading from region V1 we were able to identify the genus

of 79% of the reads instead of 57% when sampling across
the entire 16S sequence and 44% of the species instead of
only 14% (Figure 7). Region V2 was best able to determine the classification for the reads at the level of order,
correctly identifying 84% of the reads compared to 70%
when sampling from across the entire 16S gene. Thus, our
study suggests that identifying the phylogenetic content of
bacterial communities with short reads will be best
achieved by targeting variable regions that are specifically
chosen for each class of bacterial environment.

Conclusion
By combining high-throughput Pyrosequencing with a
novel analysis methodology, we identified phylogenies of
bacteria present in the human vagina during pregnancy.
Previous studies of the correlation between identified bacteria and preterm labor, and attempts to treat such microorganisms have produced conflicting results [24-26]. Our
methodology for studying in-depth the ecology of human
pregnancy will assist in understanding the correlation
between vaginal microorganisms and complications in
pregnancy.
Our simulations indicate that the methodology is currently limited by two factors: short read-lengths of Pyrosequencing and the incomplete nature of 16S rDNA

databases. As more bacteria are sequenced and added to
the database, the effects of the second limitation will
decrease. Improvements in sequencing technology will
increase read-lengths and enhance our ability to distinguish between genera. In order to best identify particular
species, using our methodology we can identify and isolate the most informative 16S variable region.

Methods
Identifying 16S sequence
The first stage of our analysis matches reads against
known 16S rDNA sequences, or finds the closest matches
to known organisms. We leverage the Ribosomal Database
Project release 9 update 39 for its catalog of bacteria and
their phylogenetic relationships [19] and the prokMSA
database as a representative set of archaeal sequence [20].
For each read, we used the tool BLAT (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool) [18] to quickly identify matches between
reads and the combined bacterial/archaeal database,
using a minimum identity of 90% and a minimum
match/mismatch score of 15 bases.

To score the homology between a read and a database
sequence, we approximate the probability that the read
came from an organism with a p = 98% sequence similarity to the given read as follows:

Placing read in phylogeny
Placing read in phylogeny. Computing the most specific and confident placement of a read in the phylogenetic tree occurs
in two stages. First, for each internal node we compute a score that is equal to the maximum of the scores of its children. Second, we traverse down the tree from the root until we find a node for which the child with the second maximum score is
within a threshold T of the maximum score, or until we reach a leaf node.

Placing reads in the phylogeny
Each read that results in a known match will typically also
match with many additional organisms. For example, a
read may match with several species within the same

genus, in which case we cannot identify the exact species
of the read. However, if all the known hits at least fall
within the same genus then we are confident the read was
sampled from an organism belonging to that genus. In

Page 9 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:108

this way, for each read our goal is to determine the most
specific classification within the phylogeny that likely
contains the organism from which the read was obtained.
We analyze each read r using the following alrogithm. For
every node i in the phylogenetic tree, we assign a value
B(i) as follows. For leaf nodes, we set B(i) = P(r related to
i) defined above for organisms with a scored BLAT hit,
and B(i) = 0 otherwise. For internal nodes, we set B(i) =
maxj ∈ children (i) B(j). This process is illustrated in Figure 8a.
At the root node we will therefore have B(root) = maxi P(r
related to i).
Next, we traverse down the tree starting at the root node.
At each internal node, if the ratio of the two maximal
child nodes j and k exceeds a threshold T (i.e. B(j)/B(k) >
T), or if B(j) is the only non-zero child, then we descend
to node j and repeat the procedure. Once the procedure
terminates in an internal node or a leaf node i, we believe
with a confidence level related to T that the read came
from an organism belonging to the subtree rooted at i. An
example of this is illustrated in Figure 8b. We experimented with the choice of T over several orders of magnitude and found that the resulting analysis varied only very
slightly. For the analyses performed in this study, we used
T = 0.01.
Simulating reads
For our analysis of read-length and variable region resolving power, we simulated reads from two hypothetical collections of species. The random profile consists of 387
species of bacteria, selected by randomly traversing down
the phylogenetic tree from the root to a leaf, picking each
branch with uniform probability, resulting in very high
diversity. The sample profile constitutes 330 species of bacteria, created by sampling species from a distribution of
genera and species that was consistent with the analysis
results from our six samples.

For each simulation, a read simulator generated reads
sampled from 16S rDNA sequence selected randomly
according to either the random or the sample profile. Reads
were sampled with uniform probability from across the
rDNA sequence, with a read-length drawn from a Gaussian distribution with average read-lengths of 30, 60, 100,
150, 200, 400, or 800 bp and standard deviations of 20%.
Sequencing errors were introduced into the reads at a rate
of 1% that consisted of mutations, insertions, deletions,
and homopolymer run count errors characteristic of Pyrosequencing.
To understand the effect of read-length on the resolving
power of our methodology, we simulated reads from both
the random and sample profile with the seven read-lengths
L of 30 – 800 bp. For each of the 2 × 7 = 14 parameter sets

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/108

we produced 30 Mb of simulated read data (N reads @ L
bp = 30 · 106 bp) and applied our analysis. By annotating
the source species for each read we able to measure the
accuracy of its placement in the phylogenetic tree, as in
Figure 6.
To study the effectiveness of restricting the sequencing to
known variable regions, we first selected a set of eight
minimally-overlapping regions within the 16S rDNA
sequence: seven regions each contained one of the known
variable regions V1 – V6 and V9, and one region contained both V7 and V8 [27]. These regions are listed in
Table 1 with their E. coli 16S rDNA sequence coordinate
ranges as well as 5' and 3' broad-range amplification primers, which we validated by PCR amplifying 16 rDNA from
E. coli. For each primer pair we performed 15 cycles of
touch-down PCR, going from 94°C for 30 s, to an annealing temperature ranging from 70°C to 50°C for 30 s, and
finally extending at 72°C for 30 s. We then performed 30
additional cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 45 s, and
72°C for 45 s, and verified the resulting products via gel
electrophoresis.
Next, we again produced sets of simulated reads for both
the random and the sample profile, restricted to each region,
for a total of 2 × 8 = 16 sets. Each read data set consisted
of 300,000 reads with an average read-length of 100 bp
and a 1% error rate. We applied our analysis and measured the accuracy of read placement in the phylogeny in
Figure 7.

Authors' contributions
AS, S Batzoglou, and MR designed the analysis methodology. AS implemented the methodology and conducted
the analysis. S Bigdeli, RJ, and MR performed the sample
preparation and sequencing. MLD, SW, KMP, YYEL, and
MMT collected the samples. AS, YYES, S Batzoglou, and
MR wrote the manuscript. All authors read and approved
the final manuscript.
