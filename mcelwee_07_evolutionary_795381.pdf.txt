Abstract

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R132

information

Conclusion: These processes represent candidate, regulated mechanisms of longevity-control
that are conserved across animal species. The longevity assurance mechanisms via which IIS acts
appear to be lineage-specific at the gene level (private), but conserved at the process level (or semipublic). In the case of GSTs, and cellular detoxification generally, this suggests that the mechanisms
of aging against which longevity assurance mechanisms act are, to some extent, lineage specific.

interactions

Results: Surprisingly, there is little evolutionary conservation at the level of individual, orthologous
genes or paralogous genes under IIS regulation. However, a number of gene categories are
significantly enriched for genes whose expression changes in long-lived animals of all three species.
Down-regulated categories include protein biosynthesis-associated genes. Up-regulated categories
include sugar catabolism, energy generation, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and several other
categories linked to cellular detoxification (that is, phase 1 and phase 2 metabolism of xenobiotic
and endobiotic toxins). Protein biosynthesis and GST activity have recently been linked to aging and
longevity assurance, respectively.

refereed research

Background: To what extent are the determinants of aging in animal species universal? Insulin/
insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling (IIS) is an evolutionarily conserved (public) regulator of
longevity; yet it remains unclear whether the genes and biochemical processes through which IIS
acts on aging are public or private (that is, lineage specific). To address this, we have applied a novel,
multi-level cross-species comparative analysis to compare gene expression changes accompanying
increased longevity in mutant nematodes, fruitflies and mice with reduced IIS.

Background

Growth and development in living organisms, from bacteria
to higher animals, are genetically programmed processes
involving molecular mechanisms, many of which are evolutionarily ancient and shared across a broad range of taxa.
Consequently, it is possible to understand genes and processes controlling mammalian growth and development by
studying invertebrate model organisms such as the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. This is also true of other functions, such as cellular
metabolism and neurobiology. But what about aging?
According to evolutionary theory, aging is not a genetically
programmed process, but rather a side-effect either of mutation pressure [1] or of selection for early life traits that
enhance fitness [2]. From this, it is not clear that aging in different taxa will involve similar mechanisms [3]. Gross pathologies of aging certainly can differ greatly in different
organisms: humans can die from stroke and cancer, while
nematodes and fruit flies do not. There are at least some differences at the molecular level too: for example, accumulation of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles contribute
to aging in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [4],
and extrachromosomal mitochondrial DNA circles (senDNAs) to aging in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina
[5]; neither contribute to aging in mammals. Thus, at least
some mechanisms of aging are private (lineage-specific)
rather than public (evolutionarily conserved) [6].
However, recent studies have shown that the insulin/insulinlike growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling (IIS) pathway is a public
determinant of aging. For example, mutation of the insulin/
IGF-1 receptor daf-2 in C. elegans (GenBank: NM_065249),
the insulin/IGF-1 receptor dINR and insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) chico in Drosophila (GenBank: NM_164899),
and the IGF-1 and insulin receptors in mice can all increase
lifespan [7-12]. Additionally, mutations in mice that decrease
levels of circulating insulin and IGF-1, such as Prop-1df/df and
Ghrhrlit/lit (the Ames and Little dwarf mice), also increase
lifespan [13,14].
It has been demonstrated in C. elegans that IIS exerts effects
on longevity via regulated effector genes [15-18]. That regulation of longevity by IIS is public could imply that such effectors are also public. Alternatively, IIS could control lifespan
through mechanisms that differ between lineages. Resolving
these possibilities is important, both for understanding the
biological processes that can determine lifespan and for identifying the contexts in which the use of animal models for
studying human aging is appropriate.
To begin to address these questions, we have compared the
genes that are transcriptionally regulated during IIS-linked
lifespan extension in three animal species: C. elegans, Drosophila and the mouse, surveyed using oligonucleotide
microarray analysis (Affymetrix). To do this we used a novel
analytical approach to examine conservation of regulation in

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R132

which conservation was viewed at each of three different levels: that of gene orthologs, that of paralogous gene sets, and
that of broader gene classes (defined by InterPro or Gene
Ontology (GO) categories). We find that, in contrast to the
public role in aging of IIS itself, IIS-regulated genes are not
conserved at the level of gene orthology or of paralogous gene
groups. However, if IIS-regulated genes are compared across
species at the level of gene category (in some cases, at a process level), cross-species similarities are visible. Notably, we
see down-regulation of categories linked to protein synthesis,
consistent with recent findings that lowered protein translation increases lifespan in the yeast S. cerevisiae [19] and C.
elegans [20-22]. We also see up-regulation of broad spectrum
cellular detoxification (that is, the phase 1, phase 2 xenobiotic
or drug detoxification system), particularly the glutathione-Stransferases (GSTs). Links between this complex somatic
maintenance system and longevity assurance have previously
been seen, for example, in C. elegans [23,24]. In the case of
cellular detoxification, a conserved role in longevity only at
the process level is consistent with the fact that the genes
involved are largely the products of lineage-specific expansion, such that orthology is non-existent. This suggests some
degree of lineage specificity in the targets of detoxification,
some of which may contribute to aging.

Results
Cross-species comparison of transcript profiles in longlived mutants with reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling
To search for public, IIS-regulated determinants of longevity,
we used previously published microarray data from longlived mutant worms and mice with lowered IIS, and generated new microarray data for a long-lived IIS mutant in flies
(see Table 1 for array data overview). For each species, raw
data were analyzed using rigorous quality control procedures
and the same statistical methods to maximize data comparability (see Materials and methods) [25].
In C. elegans, the increased lifespan of daf-2 mutants
requires the downstream FOXO transcription factor DAF-16
(GenBank: NM_001026423) [9]. We reanalyzed mRNA profile data comparing long-lived daf-2 mutants and non-longlived daf-16; daf-2 double mutants, effectively a comparison
of DAF-16 ON and DAF-16 OFF [24]. This identified 953 differentially expressed genes (558 up-regulated, 395 down-regulated in daf-2, q < 0.1, here and below). Other transcript
profiles of C. elegans IIS-regulated genes are available
[15,16], which closely resemble the gene lists studied here
[24]; these lists were generated using a different microarray
platform (spotted DNA arrays), and we therefore chose not to
include them in our analysis.
For Drosophila, we compared wild-type (Dahomey) and
long-lived chico1/+ heterozygotes [8]. This identified 1,169
differentially expressed genes (893 up-regulated, 276 downregulated in chico1/+). Initially, we also examined transcript

Absence of evolutionary conservation in IIS regulation
at the gene level

The lack of conservation seen at the level of gene orthology
was unexpected. It led us to wonder whether perhaps, in some
cases, IIS-regulated functions might be performed in different species by paralogous genes rather than orthologous ones.
To this end, we looked at expression of paralogous genes in
long-lived worms, flies and mice in two ways. Firstly, we
examined all sets of paralogs where there was either n ≤ 2 or
n ≤ 3 paralogous genes present in the gene list for each individual species (see Materials and methods). We counted the
number of paralog sets (pairs, triplets or quadruplets) where

refereed research

If IIS controls aging via regulated public mechanisms, we
would expect to see similarities between transcriptional
changes in long-lived mutants in each species. We initially
reasoned that such similarities could occur on either of two
levels. Firstly, IIS could regulate a set of orthologous genes in
all species. Secondly, IIS could regulate genes contributing to
similar biological processes in different species (for example,
antioxidant defence) that result in increased longevity. This
might or might not involve orthologous genes in the three
species.

To further test whether the nine worm-fly ortholog gene pairs
might be longevity determinants, we reduced expression of
each gene in C. elegans using RNA-mediated interference
(RNAi) in the long-lived, RNAi-hypersensitive strain rrf3(pk1426); daf-2(m577) (Table 4; Additional data file 5). As a
positive control we performed RNAi using daf-16 which, as
expected, resulted in a large decrease in lifespan (57%). Of the
test genes, RNAi of only one, the pantothenate kinase pnk-1,
significantly shortened lifespan. However, pnk-1 RNAi also
did this in a normal-lived control strain (data not shown), and
it also causes sterility, larval arrest, and embryonic lethality
[29]. The reduced lifespan may therefore reflect a requirement for pnk-1 for overall viability rather than prevention of
aging. Pantothenic acid is a component of coenzyme A, the
acetylated form of which plays a key role in the citric acid
cycle. Pantothenate kinase catalyzes the first step in coenzyme A synthesis. In conclusion, the transcriptional response
to reduced IIS shows very little evolutionary conservation at
the level of gene orthology.

Finally, for the mouse, we reanalyzed data comparing gene
expression in the liver of long-lived Prop-1df/df (Ames dwarf)
and Ghrhrlit/lit (Little) mutants to normal-lived controls [26].
Both mutants fail to secrete growth hormone, and have little
circulating IGF-1. While comprehensive array datasets from
these models are currently only available for the liver, the
liver in mammals is a crucial insulin-sensitive tissue. Moreover, the comparable tissues in worms (the intestine) and flies
(the fat body) have both been shown to be specific mediators
of the longevity of IIS mutants [27,28]. In our analysis, 1,416
genes were differentially expressed in the Ames dwarf (761
up-regulated, 655 down-regulated in the mutant), and 1,042
in the Little mouse (575 up-regulated, 467 down-regulated in
the mutant).

tional data file 4). We then screened for ortholog pairs or sets
(triplets) that showed significant (q < 0.1) changes in expression in each species, and in the same direction (up- or downregulated given reduced IIS). Surprisingly, very few orthologous genes changed expression co-ordinately in different species, and the number of such genes differed little from that
expected by chance alone. For example, only nine ortholog
pairs were significantly up-regulated in the worm and fly
datasets (approximately 14 would be expected by chance).
However, four ortholog sets were up-regulated in the worm,
fly and Little mouse, significantly more (p = 0.003) than
expected by chance alone (Tables 2, 3, 4).

reports

profiles from homozygous chico1 mutants, which are slightly
longer lived than chico1/+. However, the proportion of genes
showing differential expression was so high as to make data
analysis impracticable (data not shown). This difficulty was
likely due to the fact that homozygous chico1 flies are sterile
dwarfs, with different quantities of eggs and oocytes, and
altered allometry of tissues and organs and, as a result, the
mRNAs that they contain. By contrast, chico1/+ flies are fertile and normal sized. Thus, the present analysis was only
possible thanks to the semi-dominant effect of chico1 on aging
but not on fertility and size.

related proteins. Thus three-quarters of IIS-regulated paralog
sets are linked to sugar metabolism. In summary, our analysis
of paralog sets supports the unexpected conclusion that there
is little evolutionary conservation between C. elegans, Drosophila or mouse of IIS regulation at the gene level.

The results of this analysis are shown in additional Table 1 in
Additional data file 3. As before, at the level of orthology,
there was no conservation of IIS regulation. When this analysis was loosened to include small and then large paralog
groups, for most comparisons, there was still no significant
conservation of IIS regulation. However, one triplet comparison showed an over-representation of IIS-regulated genes in
all paralog comparisons: there were up-regulated genes in
worms, flies and Little mice in four paralog sets (p = 0.01)
(additional Table 1 in Additional data file 3). Data for the individual four genes in each of the four models examined are

paralog sets identified two proteins that we previously identified as IIS regulated in worms and flies: pantothenate kinase
and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The two other par-

at least one gene was differentially expressed in each species,
and in the same direction. Secondly, we examined all paralog
sets, whatever their size, and counted the number of paralog
sets where a substantial number of genes showed differential
expression in the same direction (we used the arbitrary cutoff of >50%). In addition, we counted again the number of
orthologs with altered expression in more than one species,
using the same statistics (see Materials and methods). For
each of these four levels of conservation (ortholog set, paralog
sets of size n ≤ 2, n ≤ 3 or any size), we asked whether the
number of ortholog or paralog sets identified were more than
expected by chance alone. To this end we performed bootstrap analysis on paralogous groups, comparing the observed
number of differentially expressed paralogous groups with
the numbers obtained by drawing the lists of differentially
expressed groups at random (see Materials and methods).

This table shows the nine worm-fly orthologous genes that show increased expression in response to reduced IIS (fold change in expression in daf-2
relative to daf-16; daf-2 shown). In bold: genes also differentially expressed in the Little mouse; a paralog of pnk-1 is also up-regulated in the Little
mouse (additional Table 2 in Additional data file 3). For simplicity, only the gene name for the worm ortholog of the gene pair is shown. Only
ortholog pairs (or triplets) that showed the same direction of change were considered, and at the level of significance used (q < 0.1), only upregulated ortholog pairs were identified. To test for a possible role in longevity, expression of each individual gene was knocked down in C. elegans
using RNAi; lifespans were compared to those of animals treated with control vector RNAi and calculated as a percentage of vector control (full
lifespan data are available in Additional data file 5). The p value is the result of the log rank test comparing experimental lifespans to vector control.
RNAi of R13H8.1/daf-16 was used as a positive control, but is not a differentially expressed orthologous gene.

Down-regulated Interpro categories
IPR000980 SH2 motif

This table shows the functional categories that are significantly up- or down-regulated in response to reduced IIS in the worm, fly, and mouse (Ames
and/or Little) microarray datasets. For brevity, the full hierarchy of the significant GO categories has not been shown. GO categories that fall directly
under another significant category within the hierarchy are shown indented under the relevant category. Categories that fall into more than one
hierarchy are only shown in one representative hierarchy. NS (non-significant; p > 0.05); *p < 0.05; **p < 0.005; ***p < 5.0e-04.

Most of the Interpro domain gene families showing conserved
up-regulation in IIS mutants are linked to cellular detoxification (that is, drug or xenobiotic metabolism) (Table 5; Figure
3). These correspond mainly to CYP, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR; note that glucose-ribitol dehydrogenases are a type of SDR), and GST enzymes. Our analysis

An expected outcome of this analysis was that the two microarray datasets from the mouse would share more over-represented gene categories with one another than with the two

The majority of the common up-regulated GO categories are
involved in sugar catabolism and energy generation (Table 5),
implying that these processes are activated in IIS mutant animals. This is likely to reflect insulin-like control of sugar
homeostasis by IIS in the three organisms. It is also consistent with a recent study of genes linked to energy metabolism
in the worm dataset, which implies increased conversion of
fat to carbohydrate and conservation of ATP stocks [32].
Among the shared down-regulated GO categories are many
linked to protein biosynthesis and translation (Table 5),
implying down-regulation of these processes in long lived
milieus. Interestingly, it was recently discovered that lifespan
in C. elegans is increased by loss of function of several genes
promoting protein translation, including translation initiation factors and ribosomal proteins [20-22]. Thus, our results
suggest that reduced protein translation may be a public
mechanism of longevity assurance regulated by IIS (Figure
2).

deposited research

Next we tested whether the number of shared gene categories
enriched for differentially regulated genes was more than predicted by chance alone. To do this, we performed bootstrap
analysis of gene categories, drawing categories at random and
computing p values from the number of common categories
between the various combinations of gene lists (see Materials
and methods). According to this analysis, for most comparisons the number of shared categories is more than predicted
by chance alone, particularly where genes are up-regulated in
the long-lived mutants (Additional data file 7). However, it
should be borne in mind that the statistical test used assumes
that the various categories are independent of one another,
and in some cases this may not be the case. For example, cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and GSTs can be subject to
coordinate regulation [31]; moreover, given that the GO
annotation is not a strict hierarchy, different GO categories
may be non-independent. Thus, while the conclusion that no
more gene classes are seen than expected by chance alone
may be relied upon, the opposite conclusion cannot be. Nonetheless, the categories represented in Table 5 do potentially
correspond to conserved IIS-regulated processes. These may
include public determinants of aging that are not dependent
on parallel transcriptional changes in orthologous genes.

invertebrate datasets. In terms of the individual genes showing altered expression, there are strong overlaps between the
Prop-1df/df and Ghrhrlit/lit datasets [26]. However, the number
of shared categories is surprisingly low (Figure 1). To some
degree, this may reflect the fact that the Prop-1df/df mutation
is more pleiotropic, blocking production of thyroid stimulating hormone and prolactin in addition to growth hormone. It
may also reflect the larger size of the lists of differentially
expressed genes from the dwarf mouse studies, which can
reduce the sensitivity of the test for overlapping gene categories. More positively, it suggests that comparing datasets
from the two mouse strains has acted as a strong filter to
exclude numerous gene categories unlinked to the increased
lifespan phenotype.

by IIS. To this end we screened each dataset for biologically
related genes or structurally related gene families showing coordinately increased or decreased expression in response to
reduced IIS. Using biological annotation available through
GO and Interpro, each dataset was analyzed using Catmap
[30]. This software program assigns significance to gene categories based on their relative statistical ranking or representation within the dataset. This generated a list of gene
categories showing significantly altered expression in each
species; of these, a subset showed similar and significant
changes in all three species (Figure 1; Table 5; Additional data

public mechanism of longevity assurance, protecting against
the stochastic molecular damage that underlies the aging
process.

Random distribution of IIS-regulated genes among
lineage-specific expansions of detoxification genes
The association of increased expression of gene classes linked
to cellular detoxification with longevity in three species, coupled with the lack of gene-level orthology, prompted us to
examine the evolutionary relationships of these gene families
in more detail. To do this, we constructed phylogenetic trees
for each of three families in worms, flies, and mice, and then
examined the distribution of IIS-regulated gene expression.
Figure 4 shows a phylogenetic tree of worm, fly and mouse
GSTs, marked to show differentially expressed genes (see also
Additional data file 2). We also examined the phylogenetic
tree of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), a major class
of phase 2 enzymes, which are over-represented in genes upregulated in C. elegans daf-2 mutants and long-lived dauer
larvae [24]. In each case, the phylogenetic distribution of IISregulated genes is apparently random (Additional data file 2).
Significantly, comparing worms, flies and mice, there are no
orthologs for most genes in these families. In each of these
large gene families, individual genes are, in most cases, the
products of lineage-specific expansions [33]. This is typical of
proteins whose function entails recognizing diverse chemical

include chemoreceptors and antigen recognition proteins of

Enrichment of FOXO1-binding sites among
differentially regulated genes in long-lived mutants in
three species
Finally, we explored whether IIS transcriptional responses
are regulated by conserved DNA binding factors. Using the
program Clover (Cis-eLement OvEr-Representation) [35], we
examined the upstream regions of the differentially expressed
genes in each species for over-representation of known DNAbinding motifs (Additional data file 8). Many motifs were
identified when examining each individual dataset. Of these,
none was over-represented among genes regulated in the
same direction in all three species. The FOXO1-binding site
was over-represented among genes up-regulated in longlived worms and mice; by contrast, this motif was over-represented among genes down-regulated in long-lived flies (Additional data file 8). Overexpression of FOXO increases lifespan
in both worms and flies [27]. These findings could imply that
down-regulation of FOXO-regulated genes influences
lifespan in flies (perhaps lowering damage-generating processes), while up-regulation is more important in worms and
mice (perhaps increasing damage-protective processes). Furthermore, an analysis using the EASE program of gene classes
over-represented in genes with putative FOXO-binding sites
in worms and mice revealed little similarity between these

If significant numbers of orthologous genes were robustly IIS
regulated in similar ways in multiple tissues, then it is likely
that the analytical approaches that we have employed would
have detected this. However, it remains possible that
orthologous genes regulated similarly by IIS eluded our analysis, for several reasons. Firstly, microarray analysis may
have failed to detect small but functionally significant
changes in transcript levels, for example, genes showing IISregulated expression in only a small proportion of cells in C.

deposited research

The absence of detectable regulation by IIS of orthologous
genes in the three animal models tested was unexpected, for
several reasons. Firstly, even if the same IIS-regulated genes
did not regulate aging in worms, flies and mice, one would
expect that some of the genes mediating the effects of IIS on
growth and sugar metabolism would be conserved at the level
of orthology. Secondly, an earlier study examined putative
direct transcriptional targets of FOXO in C. elegans and Drosophila, focusing on 17 C. elegans-Drosophila ortholog gene
pairs with predicted DAF-16 binding sites in their promoter
regions [36]. There, a third of C. elegans orthologs showed IIS
regulation, suggesting possible evolutionary conservation of
IIS-regulated genes at the level of orthology. However, no
data on IIS regulation of Drosophila orthologs were reported
in that study. Our findings point to the opposite conclusion:
that the set of genes regulated by IIS is largely lineage specific.

In contrast to our studies of orthologous or paralogous genes,
our comparative analysis at the gene class level identified a
number of candidate gene classes and processes showing an
evolutionarily conserved pattern of regulation in long-lived
mutants with reduced IIS (Table 5). We performed this
analysis with the aim of identifying candidate evolutionarily
conserved processes that mediate the effects of IIS on aging.
However, IIS is also a major regulator of growth and metabolism (including sugar homeostasis), so the presence of any of
the gene categories in Table 5 may reflect a role in these other
processes, rather than in aging. For example and as expected,
many categories associated with sugar catabolism are up-regulated in the long-lived mutants in all three species, consistent with lowered insulin signaling. This demonstrates that
methods used here are sensitive enough to identify known
insulin-regulated gene categories.

reports

The role of IIS as a regulator of aging shows evolutionary conservation. The effects of IIS on lifespan reflect the action of
IIS-regulated genes and biochemistries of aging and longevity. In this study, we have asked the question: are these genes
and processes public (evolutionarily conserved) or private
(lineage specific)? We have done this by means of a cross-species comparison of transcript changes seen in long-lived nematodes, insects and mammals with lowered IIS when
compared to normal-lived controls. To be able to do this we
developed a novel, multi-level cross-species comparative
method, comparing gene expression at the levels of genetic
orthology, paralogy (in small and large paralog sets), and
gene classes. We detected little evolutionary conservation of
IIS regulation at the orthologous or paralogous gene levels.
However, at the genes class or process level some evolutionary conservation was observed, including several processes
previously associated with aging.

lation is different in different tissues in the invertebrate models, this could prevent detection of IIS regulation. Thirdly, it
may be that in extra-hepatic tissues, transcript profile
changes resulting from Prop-1df/df and Ghrhrlit/lit are more
similar to those in C. elegans and Drosophila IIS mutants.
The liver consists mainly of dividing cells whereas, in the
invertebrate models, adult somatic tissues consist largely of
post-mitotic cells. Recent mouse studies suggest that agerelated changes in gene expression may differ between
mitotic and post-mitotic tissues [37]. Fourthly, gene regulation by IIS might differ between sexes (we compared data
from hermaphrodite worms, females flies and male mice).
Finally, although young adults of each organism were used, it
is possible that the slight differences in their relative age constituted a confounding variable. More generally, the value of
transcript profile studies is limited by the fact that changes in
mRNA levels may not correspond to changes in levels of protein products of mRNA translation. Further studies are warranted to establish with greater certainty the extent of
evolutionary conservation of regulation of genes by IIS. For
example, there may be differences in the degree of evolutionary conservation of IIS regulation by direct targets of FOXO
versus genes further downstream in a FOXO-regulated cascade. It would be useful to identify direct targets of FOXO, for
example, using chromatin immunoprecipitation [38] and to
perform cross-species comparisons of their IIS regulation.

the level of orthology.

respectively, in long-lived mutant worms, flies and mice.
Potentially, this contributes to longevity (Figure 2).

Decreased protein biosynthesis: a candidate longevity
assurance process in multiple animal species
Several recent studies imply that increased protein biosynthesis accelerates aging. Lowered expression of a number of
genes involved in mRNA translation, ribosomal proteins,
translation initiation factors and ribosomal protein S6 kinase
results in reduced rates of protein biosynthesis and increased
lifespan in C. elegans [20-22]. Similarly, deletion of ribosomal protein genes can increase replicative lifespan in the
budding yeast S. cerevisiae [19]. Over-representation of
genes associated with protein biosynthesis among those
down-regulated in long-lived C. elegans, Drosophila and
mice implicates this process as a public, IIS-regulated mechanism controlling aging. However, it should be noted that the
individual genes involved in protein biosynthesis whose
expression was shown to affect C. elegans aging were not
themselves IIS regulated [21]. How lowered protein synthesis
might increase lifespan is unknown, although in C. elegans
these perturbations increase heat stress resistance, suggesting that lowered protein synthesis leads to induction of
somatic maintenance functions [21].

GST activity: a candidate longevity assurance process
in multiple animal species
GSTs detoxify a wide range of electrophilic (that is, oxidizing)
and often toxic compounds by conjugation with glutathione
(GSH) [39]. Such electrophiles can otherwise react with
nucleophilic centers, for example, in proteins, causing molecular damage. Within biogerontology, there is a growing consensus that the primary cause of biological aging is
accumulation of damage at the molecular level. Studies to
date broadly support the view that longevity-assurance processes prevent accumulation of damage by promoting somatic
maintenance processes [40-42]. The mechanisms involved
include reduction or removal of the causes of molecular damage, and repair or turnover of damaged molecules. Thus, a
role of GSTs in protection against aging is easy to rationalize.
More importantly, there is some direct experimental evidence
for a role of GSTs in longevity assurance. The C. elegans genes
gst-5 and gst-10 encode GSTs that detoxify 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), which is a major product of peroxidation of
membrane lipids and a mediator of the pathophysiological
effects of oxidative stress [43]. RNAi knockdown of either of
these genes reduces both HNE-conjugating activity and
lifespan [23,44]. Overexpression of GST-10 or of murine
mGSTA4-4 (also active against HNE) increases HNE-conjugating activity and, significantly, lifespan [23]. The over-representation of GST genes among genes up-regulated in longlived mutant C. elegans, Drosophila and mice with reduced
IIS suggests that GST activity may represent a public, IIS-regulated mechanism of longevity assurance.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R132

The possible broader implications of the observed association
between GST gene expression and extended lifespan (Table 5)
may be considered in three overlapping biochemical contexts:
defence against reactive oxygen species (ROS), the biology of
GSH, and broad spectrum detoxification (that is, drug metabolism). GSTs play a major role in detoxifying a broad range of
oxidized breakdown products of macromolecules that form
during periods of oxidative stress [39]. These pro-oxidant
products include α,β-unsaturated carbonyls such as HNE,
hydroperoxides and epoxides. ROS such as superoxide and
hydrogen peroxide have long been viewed as potential major
contributors to the molecular damage that underlies aging
[45]. Thus, elevated GST levels could reflect a broader up-regulation of antioxidant defenses in these three long-lived models. However, looking at transcript levels for genes encoding
superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges superoxide,
we see that while several sod genes are up-regulated in C. elegans, this is not the case in Drosophila or the mouse (Table
6). Consistent with this, increased SOD has been observed in
daf-2 C. elegans [46], but not chico1/+ Drosophila [8]. In
terms of hydrogen peroxide scavengers, there is some evidence of increased catalase mRNA levels in long-lived C. elegans and Drosophila, but not in the mouse. In C. elegans,
there is a tandem array of three very similar genes encoding
catalase, ctl-1, ctl-2 and ctl-3 [47]. Our microarray analysis
shows strongly increased expression of ctl-3 in daf-2 animals
(q < 0.003); however, for the purposes of analysis in this
study, ctl-3 data were excluded due to predicted promiscuity
in probe binding between clt-3 and ctl-1. In Drosophila there
is a possible increase in catalase mRNA levels (log2 fold
change 0.3, q = 0.045). The absence of increased transcript
levels of catalase and Mn SOD genes in Prop-1df/df mouse liver
was unexpected, since increased catalase levels have been
reported in this tissue [48]. Overall, our transcript profile
comparison provides little support for the view that direct
defense against superoxide and hydrogen peroxide is a regulated public mechanism of longevity assurance.
A second perspective on possible GST function in aging is
within the context of a broader, GSH-associated biochemistry. Besides its role in detoxification by GSTs, GSH itself acts
as an antioxidant [39], and the ratio of reduced to oxidized
GSH is a determinant of cellular redox status. GSH-mediated
processes can clearly influence aging. For example, in Drosophila overexpression of glutamate cysteine ligase (γglutamylcysteine synthetase), the major rate-limiting enzyme
in GSH biosynthesis, extends lifespan [49]. Moreover, overexpression of methionine sulfoxide reductase, an enzyme that
uses GSH to restore oxidized methionine in proteins by
reducing methionine sulfoxide, also increases Drosophila
lifespan [50].
Hepatic metabolism in Prop-1df/df (Ames dwarf) mice appears
to be geared up for increased GSH production and usage [5155]. Both GSH levels and GSH/GSSG ratios are increased
[53], and there is increased activity of the trans-sulfuration

Our results suggest that protein translation, GST activity and
possibly the broader cellular detoxification system may represent 'semi-public' mechanisms of longevity determination:
the processes show evolutionary conservation while the individual genes do not. In the case of GSTs, this could imply that
different toxins are being cleared in different evolutionary
lineages, that is, that the cause of aging, the diverse harmful
molecular species that this system targets, may differ between
species. Thus, although damage-causing toxins appear implicated as a cause of aging-related damage in all three species,
the specific toxins involved may include some that are evolutionarily conserved and others that are lineage-specific.

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R132

In principle, toxins contributing to aging that are lineage-specific could contribute to the lineage specificity of agingrelated pathologies. According to this view, aging involves

interactions

The lack of gene orthology between DMEs might seem to suggest that damage-causing toxins are private. However, in at
least one case this is not the case. Up-regulation of GSTs that
detoxify HNE occurs both in C. elegans daf-2 mutants (gst-10
[17]) and liver of Prop1df/df and Ghrhrlit/lit mice (GSTA4 in
both cases [26]), although these genes are not orthologous
(Figure 1b in Additional data file 2). Moreover, expression of
murine GSTA4 in C. elegans lowers HNE levels and increases
lifespan [23]. This demonstrates that convergent evolution
can lead to similar substrate specificities in non-orthologous
DMEs. Significantly, a major source of HNE is oxidative damage to lipid, consistent with reactive oxygen species acting as
a public mechanism of aging [6].

refereed research

Interestingly, CYPs and SDRs are also over-represented
among genes up-regulated in long-lived C. elegans, Drosophila and mice (Table 5) (though UGTs and sulfotransferases are not). This suggests that the cellular detoxification
more broadly might play a role in longevity assurance. Genes
encoding CYPs, SDRs and UGTs are also over-represented
among genes whose expression is increased in long-lived C.
elegans dauer larvae relative to larvae that have exited the
dauer stage [24,56]. In mice, caloric restriction and Prop1df/df
have additive effects on longevity. Phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification genes are up-regulated in both contexts and, in some
cases, show additive increases in expression in Prop1df/df mice
subjected to caloric restriction [57]. In summary, a growing
number of studies show correlations between cellular (phase
1, 2) detoxification and longevity.

An overview of evolutionary conservation of biological
mechanisms controlling aging

deposited research

Beyond the biology of GSH, GSTs may be viewed as part of a
wider system of cellular detoxification involving two phases:
phase 1 (functionalization reactions), and phase 2 (conjugative reactions) [31] (Figure 3). CYPs and short-chain
dehydrogenase reductases (SDRs) are major effectors of
phase 1 metabolism, which through oxidative (CYP) or reductive (SDR) chemistry can bioactivate toxic molecules. Activated metabolites from phase 1 are substrates for effectors of
phase 2 metabolism, such as the GSTs, UDP-glucuronosyl/
UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) and sulfotransferases.
Phase 2 reactions can both detoxify and increase solubility of
toxic moieties, aiding excretion. In mammals, this system
acts in a coordinate fashion to dispose of a very broad range
of xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds, including toxins,
drugs, carcinogens and damaged cellular constituents [31].

Studies in C. elegans imply that IIS exerts its effects most
strongly during the reproductive period in the first few days
of adulthood [58]. This could imply that damaging aspects of
protein synthesis and generation of toxins that drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) protect against are elevated during
this period, perhaps due to reproduction.

pathway, implying increased flux of thiols from methionine to
cysteine and GSH [51,55]. Possibly increased GSH production
retards aging by supporting a range of mechanisms that protect against an age-related increase in levels of toxic
electrophiles.

Our results suggest that public regulators of lifespan regulate semi-public
mechanisms of longevity assurance, which may in turn act on a
combination of private and public mechanisms of aging. The semi-public
character of longevity assurance processes is reflected by the IIS-regulated
gene classes. Several are linked to detoxification (such as the GSTs), and
are the results of copious lineage-specific expansions.

stochastic mechanisms that are partially public and partially
private. A summary overview of this interpretation is shown
in Figure 5. Here, public regulators of lifespan (for example,
IIS) regulate semi-public mechanisms of longevity assurance
(for example, cellular detoxification), which act on both private and public types of damage generation (for example, toxins). In the specific example discussed above, IIS regulates a
semi-public mechanism of longevity assurance (GSTs with
HNE-conjugating activity) acting against a public mechanism
of aging (HNE toxicity).

Conclusion

We have compared changes in transcript profiles occurring in
long-lived mutants with reduced IIS in C. elegans, Drosophila and the mouse. Our aim was to identify genes and
processes regulated by IIS that might correspond to evolutionarily conserved (public), proximal determinants of aging.
While our analysis suggests that IIS regulation of genes shows
relatively little evolutionary conservation at the level of individual orthologous or paralogous genes, we identified two
processes that are both IIS regulated in all three animal
models, and linked to aging. In each long-lived mutant, there
is evidence of lowered protein biosynthesis and increased
cellular detoxification (most significantly, by GSTs). This evolutionary conservation suggests that these processes might
play a role in the control of other animal lineages, for example, primates. More research is therefore needed on the
impact of these two processes on aging.

Materials and methods
Microarray analyses
All microarray datasets analyzed in this study are publicly
available. The C. elegans datasets are available from the Gene
Expression Omnibus [59], accession number GSE1762. The
D. melanogaster datasets are available from ArrayExpress

D. melanogaster used for microarray analysis were generated
as follows: chico1/+ heterozygotes were selected from the
progeny of a Dahomey wild type × Dahomey chico1/CyO
cross. Wild-type Dahomey control flies were age-matched as
previously described, and all flies were raised under standard
culture conditions [61]. The chico1 stock [8,62] has been
maintained with continuous outcrossing to the wild-type
(Dahomey) stock, where the latter was maintained in large
populations to avoid inbreeding. Flies used for microarray
analysis were sampled and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen at 3
pm on day 7 of adult life (from eclosion). For each array, RNA
from 20 to 30 whole flies was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified with RNeasy columns
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's
instructions. The quality and concentration of RNA was confirmed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and further procedures followed
the standard Affymetrix protocol. All samples were hybridized to the Drosophila Genome 2.0 Genechip. In total, five
biological replicates of each genotype (wild type and chico1/+)
were performed.
Information regarding the C. elegans and M. musculus
(Prop1df/df and Ghrhrlit/lit) strains, growth conditions, sample
preparation and microarray hybridization protocols used to
generate the raw Affymetrix data (cel files) analyzed in this
study are previously described [24,26]. For our analysis of the
Ames and Little mice, we used the three-month time point,
which is the most similar physiologically aged time point to
those used for the worm and fly microarray analyses. The sex
of the animals from which mRNA was taken was as follows: C.
elegans, hermaphrodite; D. melanogaster, female; M.
musculus, male.

Ortholog analysis
To assign gene orthologs between the three species, the
Ensembl Biomart tool (Ensembl version 37) was used to
download lists of orthologous genes between each species
[63]. These orthologous gene-pairs generally represent the
unique best reciprocal BLAST hit for the two species. For a
full description of the methodology used for ortholog prediction, see the Ensembl help pages at [64]. To identify orthologous genes across all three species, we identified fly genes that
had both a mouse and worm ortholog. All ortholog lists are
available in Additional data file 4.
To examine the statistical significance of the number of differentially expressed orthologs that were observed when
comparing the microarray datasets, we performed a simulation to determine the number of expected differentially
expressed orthologs given the total population sizes (the total

We used the following statistical and computational tools in
the analysis of our microarray datasets: The R computer program (version 2.0.1) [75], Goldenspike [25], Catmap [30] and
Clover [35]. For all four datasets (worm, fly, and mouse Ames
and Little), raw data (cel files) were normalized, fold-changes

The potential role of conserved orthologous genes in aging
was examined using an RNAi feeding protocol [65]. Bacteria
expressing double-stranded RNAi for each target gene were
obtained from the Ahringer RNAi feeding library [66]. One
gene (Y105C5B.28) was not represented in the library, so an
RNAi feeding clone was made. PCR was used to amplify a portion of Y105C5B.28 using primers JJM154 (ccagCCACCAACTACCGCC) and JJM143 (CTATCCGAACTCTAATGCTTGG).
A single band of predicted size was generated, and was sub-

Protein sequences for the genes in each of the detoxification
gene families were obtained from WormBase (WS130) [70]
and Ensembl (ENSEMBL 30). For genes with multiple splice
forms, only one representative isoform was used for analysis,
which might slightly affect the topology of the phylogenetic
trees produced. For each gene family, protein alignments
were computed with ClustalX using BLOSUM matrices and
otherwise default settings [71,72]. During the protein alignment phase, a small number of proteins aligned dubiously
with other family members, likely due to poor gene models or
annotation. Such genes were removed from further analysis,
or in the case of C. elegans were corrected by hand based on
family homology [34]. Phylogenetic trees were generated
from the multiple alignment using the PHYLIP package (J
Felsenstein, Phylogeny Inference Package, version 3.6a2; distributed by the author, Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, USA), using either protdist
(Poisson-corrected distances) and neighbor-joining [73], or
by proml using the maximum-likelihood method with one
rate class. Each tree was rooted either by fungal outgroup, or
center rooted. Trees were displayed and colored with Bonsai
1.2 [74]. Phylogenetic trees for each of the four detoxification
gene families (CYP, GST, SDR, UGT) are available in Additional data file 2.

We first obtained three sets of orthology and paralogy relationships from ENSEMBL release 40, for the fly, the mouse
and the worm. For each species, we created groups of in-paralogs. Genes without in-paralogs were also assigned to
groups, each of which contained a single member. Orthology
relationships were built initially for the three pairs of species
comparisons (fly-worm, fly-mouse and worm-mouse): two
groups were called orthologous when any gene from the first
groups had any orthologous or paralogous relationships with
any other gene from the second group (similar to single linkage clustering). For the three species comparison, three
groups were called orthologous if at least one group was
orthologous to the groups in both other species. A group was
considered differentially expressed when at least one of its
members was differentially expressed (for the analysis limited to groups of maximum size 2 or 3), or when at least half
of the groups present on the chip were differentially
expressed (for the analysis of all orthologous groups). The
probabilities reported in additional Table 1 in Additional data
file 3 were computed by drawing at random 10,000 'differentially expressed' gene lists for each (fly, worm, Ames and Little), and then computing the proportion of times that the
number of common groups obtained from these random gene
lists were greater or equal to the actual number of common
orthologous groups.

For the lifespan assays, the RNAi-hypersensitive strain
GA303 (rrf-3(pk1426); daf-2(m577)) was used to examine
the effect of RNAi on the increased lifespan of daf-2. Eggs
from gravid adult animals maintained at 20°C were isolated
by hypochlorite treatment [68] and allowed to develop on
RNAi plates at 20°C. L4 larvae were transferred to new plates
at 25°C, and this time point was treated as day 0. Lifespan
assays were then performed at 25°C as described [69], using
RNAi plates throughout the experiment. The log rank test was
performed using the statistical package JMP IN (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA, version 5.1) to compare the lifespan
curve of each RNAi experiment to the empty L4440 vector
control. Full lifespan data are available in Additional data file
5.

cloned using the TopoTA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). This was then subcloned into the L4440 RNAi
feeding vector using compatible restriction sites and transformed into the HT115(DE3) RNAi feeding bacterial strain
[67]. Bacteria expressing RNAi constructs were induced overnight on NG agar plates containing 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as described.

reviews

Distributions of common, differentially expressed orthologs
were obtained by simulation, generating 106 random draws of
genes. For each random draw, we drew random samples of
size n1 and n2 (and n3 for the three species comparison) from
the populations of N1 and N2, respectively (and N3 when necessary). Now both use subscript numerals but no italics For
example, for the fly-worm up-regulation comparison, the
pool of genes contained N1 = 10,395 fly and N2 = 12,414 worm
genes, while the sample sizes were n1 = 893 and n2 = 558 upregulated genes in fly and worm, respectively (Tables 2 and
3). The p value is the proportion of draws where the number
of common orthologs found in the random draw was greater
or equal to the number of orthologs actually observed.

performed, using a slightly modified version of the recently
described 'Goldenspike' methodology implemented in R.
Briefly, this procedure performs eight different normalization
routines, which are then used to produce an average foldchange difference and false-discovery rate (q-value) between
different genotypes that takes into consideration the variance
of probe set intensity across the different normalizations. The
Goldenspike methodology has been shown to out-perform
most commonly used normalization methods [25]. The Goldenspike protocol was altered slightly to exclude absent probe
sets (those probe sets called 'Absent' in all hybridizations by
MAS5) prior to the final probe set-level Loess normalization.
This alteration was found to reduce the number of false-positives associated with the absent probe sets. The output from
Goldenspike for each of the datasets is available in Additional
data file 9.

We estimated the probability of finding by chance alone Nobs
common gene categories among the n1 (or n2, n3 and n4) categories significantly differentially expressed in the various
gene lists. To do this we performed 10,000 random draws of
n1 (or n2, n3 and n4 when required) gene categories from the
set of N1 (or N2, N3, and N4) gene categories annotating the
genes in the first (or second, third and fourth) list. The probability is defined as the proportion of the 10,000 random
draws where the number of common categories is greater or
equal to Nobs. It should be pointed out that this procedure will
underestimate the true probability of finding a large number
of common categories because it neglects the correlations
between gene categories (see Results). A further drawback
with this methodology is that drawing genes at random and
performing the Catmap analysis on random ordering of genes
is costly in terms of computer time and resources.

Prior to further analysis, we performed a quality control procedure on all three Affymetrix microarrays used in this study
to ensure the specificity of each individual probe set. All individual probes have been mapped against all known and predicted transcripts of the corresponding genome using recent
genome releases (C. elegans genome release WS140, D. melanogaster genome release version 4.2.1, and M. musculus
genome release NCBIm34) [63,76,77]. This mapping allowed
for up to one alignment error for either perfect match or mismatch of each individual probe, and a composite score was
calculated for each probe set. This allowed each probe set to
be assigned a qualitative category: perfect (all probes match a
single target gene with no mismatches), promiscuous (some
or all probes within a probe set map to more than one gene in
the genome), weak (the probe set maps to a single gene, but
some probes may have mismatches or may not map to the
gene), or orphan (no probes in the probe set map to any
known or predicted gene in the genome). Both promiscuous
and orphan probe sets were excluded from further analysis.

The Clover program [35] was used to identify over-representation of putative functional motifs in the 1,000 base-pairs
upstream of the transcriptional start site, as defined by
Ensembl [63]. Motifs in the TRANSFAC database (version
8.4) [80] were tested for statistical over-representation
within the upstream region of significantly (q < 0.1) up- or
down-regulated genes compared to the upstream sequences
of all known genes. The output from Clover for each dataset is
available in Additional data file 8. RepeatMasker [81] was
used to mask all DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and
low complexity DNA sequences.

To identify significant differential expression of functionally
related categories of genes, we used the program Catmap
[30]. We first populated this program with functional annotations for the genomes of the three species examined. To facilitate direct comparisons between the species, we used only
GO and Interpro annotations, which use universal vocabularies [78,79].
For Catmap analysis, a ranked gene list based on the Bayes t
statistic from the Goldenspike analysis was used as input. The
Wilcoxon rank sum was used to generate a score based on the
sum of the rankings of all genes with a particular functional
annotation, and the significance of that score (the p value)
was calculated analytically based on a random gene-rank distribution. Gene categories were considered significantly differentially regulated at a Catmap p value < 0.05. Full output
from Catmap for each of the comparisons (up- and down-regulated genes analyzed separately) is available in Additional
data file 6.

To identify motifs that occur in the promoters of differentially
expressed genes in all three species, we examined the output
of Clover for motifs that were significantly over-represented
(p value ≤ 0.05, raw score cut-off >5) in the up- or down-regulated genes in each dataset.
