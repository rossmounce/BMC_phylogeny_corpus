Abstract
Background: Related species, such as humans and chimpanzees, often experience the same disease with varying degrees of
pathology, as seen in the cases of Alzheimer's disease, or differing symptomatology as in AIDS. Furthermore, certain diseases
such as schizophrenia, epithelial cancers and autoimmune disorders are far more frequent in humans than in other species for
reasons not associated with lifestyle. Genes that have undergone positive selection during species evolution are indicative of
functional adaptations that drive species differences. Thus we investigate whether biomedical disease differences between
species can be attributed to positively selected genes.
Results: We identified genes that putatively underwent positive selection during the evolution of humans and four mammals
which are often used to model human diseases (mouse, rat, chimpanzee and dog). We show that genes predicted to have been
subject to positive selection pressure during human evolution are implicated in diseases such as epithelial cancers, schizophrenia,
autoimmune diseases and Alzheimer's disease, all of which differ in prevalence and symptomatology between humans and their
mammalian relatives.
In agreement with previous studies, the chimpanzee lineage was found to have more genes under positive selection than any of
the other lineages. In addition, we found new evidence to support the hypothesis that genes that have undergone positive
selection tend to interact with each other. This is the first such evidence to be detected widely among mammalian genes and
may be important in identifying molecular pathways causative of species differences.
Conclusion: Our dataset of genes predicted to have been subject to positive selection in five species serves as an informative
resource that can be consulted prior to selecting appropriate animal models during drug target validation. We conclude that
studying the evolution of functional and biomedical disease differences between species is an important way to gain insight into
their molecular causes and may provide a method to predict when animal models do not mirror human biology.

Background
Much scientific and medical progress has depended on
experimental findings in model organisms being extrapolated to humans. However, even closely related species
such as humans and chimpanzees, often experience the
same medical condition with varying symptomatology, as
seen in cases of Alzheimer's disease or AIDS, or with varying prevalence, for example, autoimmune diseases, epithelial cancers and schizophrenia [1,2].
Comparison of disease prevalence and symptomatology
across species is complicated by the fact that modern
human lifestyles, very far from the conditions of early
human evolution, may reveal susceptibilities to disease
that were not evident in the early history of the human
species [3]. However, there are observed biomedical differences between humans and other animals that cannot
be wholly explained by lifestyle [1,2].
Genetic disease can occur as a by-product of an adaptation
which confers a large selective advantage [4]. For instance,
the seemingly human-specific disease of schizophrenia
[5] and the greater human susceptibility to Alzheimer's
disease compared with primates [6] may be a by-product
of the human specialisation for higher cognitive function
[7]. Besides Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, many
other diseases also differ in frequency and symptomatology between humans and other mammals. Olsen and
Varki [1] and Varki and Altheide [2] list some of these diseases with the emphasis on non-human primates, indicating that for these diseases chimpanzees are not good
models despite their close evolutionary relationship with
humans. Genes that have been subject to adaptive evolution since the divergence of humans and other primates
may be involved in this variation of phenotype and be key
to understanding the disease state. Thus, comparative evolutionary genomics can offer insights into these disease
mechanisms by correlating molecular differences that
arose during species evolution with phenotypic differences in diseases between species; hence elucidating disease-causative genes and pathways.
Direct comparisons of human genomic and transcriptomic information to that of other species reveals three
major types of molecular genetic changes which have contributed to species differences. The most obvious mode is
the presence or absence of genes in different species,
including gene duplication and gene inactivation. Much
attention has been paid to genes that are unique to
humans or lost in the human lineage [1,2,8,9]. However
these probably represent the 'tip of the iceberg' of human
genomic differences compared to other species. The second class of molecular genetic changes constitutes of
nucleotide substitutions that may cause functional
changes in both protein coding and non-coding RNAs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/273

The third category of molecular changes consists of variation in the levels of gene expression between species and
in the mechanisms regulating gene expression [8,10].
In this study we investigate the second type of molecular
differences, and focus on coding changes in protein-coding orthologous genes. An estimated 70% to 80% of
orthologous protein sequences are distinct between
humans and chimpanzees [8,9,11]. However, a substantial proportion of differences may have no functional
impact on human-specific diseases. Positive selection
analyses can determine which nucleotide changes contribute to biological differences between species. This follows
from the premise that the action of positive selection pressure in orthologous genes during evolution is often associated with sub- or neofunctionalisation of genes [12].
Determining such genes on the human lineage is thus a
rational and promising way to reveal the molecular
changes implicated in human-specific disease.
In contrast to previous studies [13-17] which focused on
human evolution, the objective of this study was to determine genes which have undergone adaptive evolution in
both humans and animal models. We have analyzed
alignments of 3079 orthologous genes from human,
chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog to detect signals of positive selection. These species were chosen as they are common models of human disease in medical research and
high-quality genomic sequences were available.
Our initial dataset was aggressively filtered to eliminate
paralogous alignments, spurious annotations, pseudogenes in one or more species, and poor exon prediction.
Hence only quintets for which we could assign orthology
with high confidence were used in our analysis for positive selection. Due to this strict screening it must be noted
that our orthologue dataset may contain a bias towards
orthologues of high levels of conservation, thereby underestimating the number of positively selected genes and
underestimating the average levels of divergence. The
direction and strength of selection is measured by ω, the
nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio
(dN/dS = ω), with ω <1, = 1, and > 1 indicating purifying
selection, neutral evolution, and positive selection,
respectively. The branch-site model, which tests for positive selection that affects a small number of sites along
pre-specified lineages [18-20] was used to test all extant
and ancestral lineages for evidence of positive selection.
The branch-site model has been shown to be more powerful and more conservative than methods that test positive selection on a given lineage or on a subset of sites
[19]. We identified genes predicted to have changed function during mammalian evolution and relate our findings
to the diseases known to show biomedical differences
between humans and model organisms. These genes may

be causative of the phenotypic disease differences
between species and are promising targets for therapeutic
intervention. This approach is of interest to drug development as detection of positive selection in a drug target or
members of a disease pathway may cause animal models
to be non-predictive of human biology and explain some
observed biomedical differences between species [21].
We found the chimpanzee lineage had many more genes
under positive selection than any of the other lineages and
three times more than the number of genes in the human
lineage. We present evidence to argue against the possibility that this result is due to artefacts introduced by genome
sequence coverage, gene sample selection or algorithmic
sensitivity to errors in sequence data or alignments.
Instead, we conclude that the elevated number of chimpanzee positively selected genes is a true reflection of evolutionary history and is most likely due to positive
selection being more effective in the large population
sizes chimpanzees have had in the past or possibly
remarkable adaptation in the chimpanzee lineage.
As demonstrated in the yeast protein interaction network,
evolutionary rate is thought to be correlated with protein
connectivity [22-24]. Hence, genes under positive selection are generally believed to be less promiscuous, that is,
they interact with fewer genes compared to genes under
neutral evolution or negative selection. This may be
because promiscuous genes are subject to functional constraints due to their pivotal or multiple roles in biological
pathways. However, others analyzing the same data claim
that the results are inconclusive [25,26]. We investigate
whether genes under adaptive evolution interact with
fewer genes compared to genes not under positive selection but did not see a significant difference. However, we
also investigated the hypothesis that a gene under adaptive evolution would drive complementary divergence of
genes encoding interacting proteins. The most common
examples of this co-evolution of interacting genes are
receptor-ligand couples that co-evolve to maintain or
improve binding affinity and/or specificity. Examples of
such genes include the prolactin (PRL) gene and its receptor (prolactin receptor, PRLR) in mammals [27], primate
killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) that coevolved with MHC class I molecules [28] and red and
green visual pigment genes [29]. Here we present evidence
that positively selected genes are significantly more likely
to interact with other positively selected genes than genes
evolving under neutral evolution or purifying selection.

Results
Detection of genes under positive selection
Following multiple hypothesis testing correction (see
Methods), a total of 511 Positively Selected Genes (PSGs)
were detected. All lineages tested showed significant (p <
0.05) evidence of genes evolving under positive selection
varying from 54 genes along the human lineage to 162

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/273

along the chimpanzee lineage (Table 1). A complete list of
PSGs that were detected in each lineage is available in
Additional File 1.
To obtain an overall perspective of the evolutionary rates
of the genes in our dataset, the free-ratio model in the
codeml program was run on each alignment (see Methods). The median ω values for each lineage range from
0.14 in mouse and rat, to 0.17 in human and 0.20 in
chimpanzee (Figure 1). Our values for human are comparable to the ω values published by the Chimpanzee
Sequencing and Analysis Consortium [9] (mouse 0.142,
rat 0.137, human 0.208, chimp 0.194) but are more similar to those from Rhesus Macaque Genome Sequencing
and Analysis Consortium [30] (human 0.169, chimpanzee 0.175, mouse 0.104), which suggests the strict criteria
used to select our input gene set has not introduced a bias
for genes with high ω values in humans and chimpanzees.
The higher median values observed in human and chimpanzee suggest a reduction in purifying selection in hominids.
There were several genes that showed signatures of selection in multiple lineages. We found 17 PSGs along both
human and chimpanzee lineages, 8 PSGs along both
mouse and rat lineages and 8 PSGs along the hominid
and murid lineages. These numbers are significantly
greater than we would expect by chance (e.g. there were
more genes positively selected in both the human and
chimpanzee lineage than would be expected by chance; p
< 6.864e-10, Fisher's test; see Additional File 2, Table 1).
Detailed analyses of the genes that overlap between lineages can be found in Additional File 2, 'Genes under selection in adjacent lineages' and Additional File 3.
Elevated numbers of positively selected genes were
detected on the chimpanzee lineage
We found 162 PSGs along the chimpanzee lineage which
was three times more than the 54 PSGs detected on the
human lineage. This finding was in agreement with other

reports of high number of genes that underwent positive
selection during chimpanzee evolution [16,31]. Bakewell
et al. [16] (using a wholly different methodology to this
study) identified 21 positive chimpanzee genes and 2 positive human genes from an initial data set of 13,888 genes.
Elevated numbers of PSGs along the chimpanzee lineage
were also found by Arbiza et al. [31] a more similar
approach who identified 1.12% of genes under positive
selection in the human genome and 5.96% in the chimpanzee genome, which is in close accordance with 1.75%
(human) and 5.26% (chimpanzee) obtained here.
Functional processes affected by positive selection
A one-sided binomial test was used to test if the PSGs from
each lineage were over-represented among the Biological
Process (BP) class of the PANTHER ontology database [32].
The terms that showed the most enrichment were then
grouped into BP families (Figure 2) as defined by the PANTHER classification system [33]. Thirty-two BP ontology
terms which belong to fourteen BP families were enriched
for PSGs (p < 0.05, binomial test). After multiple correction,
four BP terms were significant at p < 0.05. The ontologies that
had the most representation by PSGs from the primate lineages were nucleic acid metabolism, neuronal activities, and
immunity and defence. Primate PSGs also showed enrichment in functional categories such as development processes
or signal transduction, which can be associated with species
differences. PSGs from the murid lineages showed over-representation mostly in the functional categories immunity
and defence and signal transduction. A significantly high
proportion of the chimpanzee PSGs had undefined or
unknown biological function (see Additional File 2 'Functional Classification of Chimpanzee PSGs').
OMIM is enriched for positively selected genes
In order to determine if our dataset of PSGs was significantly enhanced for disease genes, we examined genes

that were associated with human diseases as defined by
the OMIM, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database [34]. Of the 3079 genes used in our analysis, 469
genes (15.2 %) were associated with a disease term in
OMIM. Of the 511 PSGs from all seven lineages, 99 genes
(19.4 %) were associated with a disease term in OMIM
(Table 1). A test based on the binomial distribution
showed that there is a significant link between PSGs and
disease (p = 0.0067). While PSGs along the murid lineage
were significantly over-represented in OMIM (p =
0.0087), PSGs along the human, chimp or hominid lineages did not display any over-representation (significance
cut-off p = 0.05).
No correlation of PSGs and recent selection in human
populations
We did not see any evidence of a relationship between a
gene being positively selected within human populations
and in our mammalian species. In fact, there seems to be
a trend that suggests that genes are less likely to have been
subject to positive selection along the hominid branch if
they were under selection in recent human history. The
number of human PSGs was compared with genes shown
to be under positive selection pressure within human
populations [35]. This is evident in the lower proportion
of genes that were both under recent positive selection
and positively selected along the human branch (0.03%)
compared to the proportion of genes under positive selection along the hominid branch alone (1.8%).
PSGs on all lineages show evidence of co-evolution
To test if PSGs or proteins encoded by PSGs interact with
fewer genes or proteins compared to genes that are not
under positive selection, we queried a meta-database of
biological interactions (see Methods, [36]) with the list of
all PSGs. For the 511 PSGs along all lineages, 155 (30%)
did not have any annotated interactions with any other
proteins and the median number of interactions was 5.
For the 2568 genes in the test set with no evidence of positive selection, 783 (31%) did not have any interactors
and the median number of interactors was also 5. Therefore PSGs do not have a lower median number of interactors than genes not under positive selection in the test set
(p = 0.815; two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test), which
suggests that number of interactors is not a determinant
for PSGs.

To determine if any of the PSGs interact with each other
and form smaller clusters of adaptive sub-networks, we
queried the same database with the lists of PSGs from
each lineage. PSGs from all lineages except the human lineage formed clusters. For example, among the 162 chimpanzee PSGs, 9 clusters were found, consisting of 2
clusters of 3 genes and 7 clusters of 2 genes. We applied a
permutation test to determine whether the number and
size of the clusters formed is more than would be expected

by chance. For PSGs in both the chimpanzee and hominid
lineages, the size of the smallest two clusters (chimpanzee
clusters 8 (PEX12, PEX19) and 9 (NRP1, MSI1) and hominid clusters 3 (DRD2, TH) and 4 (ITGAV, AZGP1))
exceeded what would be expected by chance (p < 0.05)
(Table 2) and in the dog lineage the third cluster (contain-

ing genes SNTA1, DAG1 and MUSK) was significant,
therefore there is some evidence that PSGs are likely to
interact and form adaptive sub networks.
We also tested each cluster to determine whether the size
of the cluster is more than would be expected by chance

given the number of interactors for each individual gene
in the cluster. All 28 clusters were found to be significant
(p < 0.05 by permutation test) (Table 2), therefore there is
a significant phenomenon of PSGs interacting with other
PSGs. To confirm this observation, a further analysis was
performed on the genes that interact with the beta 2
integrin gene (ITGB2) which showed evidence of positive
selection along the rat (p < 0.001) and murid (p < 0.05)
lineages. Three of its four known interacting alpha subunits [37] also showed positive selection either on the
murid branch (ITGAL, p < 0.01; ITGAX, p < 0.05) or on the
mouse branch (ITGAD, p < 0.001).

Discussion
The functional categories enriched for PSGs in this study
were found to closely correlate with those detected in previous genome scans [38]. The consensus is compelling

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/273

given the different techniques used in each study and the
risk of false positives inherent in large-scale studies. It is
interesting to note that among the five species analyzed,
protein families with distinct functions could be identified as evolving under positive selection for each species.
Molecular changes in these genes are potentially responsible for driving the species-specific differences.
Hypotheses to explain the high number of PSGs on the
chimpanzee lineage
The high number of PSGs along the chimpanzee lineage
cannot be explained by the incorrect calling of orthologues or alignment quality, as we employed conservative
filters during the orthologue calling procedure and manually checked all the PSG alignments. We also checked the
underlying genomic quality values for the chimpanzee
PSGs and only 1 sequence had quality values less than

Q20 (error rate of 0.01) among the sites predicted to be
under positive selection and hence the high number of
PSGs is not due to poor genomic sequence quality. However, we acknowledge that the chimpanzee genome
sequence is unfinished and will contain errors and rare
polymorphisms, as exemplified by its occasional mismatches to mRNA and gene prediction sequences (such as
those provided by RefSeq). In this study, we have tried to
minimise the effect of sequence error by preferentially
using validated gene sequences when available and high
quality genome sequence when not. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude sequence error as a factor in our results. Therefore, we also checked that taxon sampling did not affect
the number of PSGs on other lineages and hence ensured
that quality issues from one species did not affect the signals for positive selection on other lineages (see Additional File 2 'Taxon sampling does not affect detection of
positive selection' and Additional File 4). Additionally,
comparison of 11 of the extremely divergent chimpanzee
sequences to their orthologues in other primates (marmoset, macaque and orang-utan) (see Additional File 2
'Chimpanzee PSGs are lineage-specific') showed that the
amino acid differences observed in the 11 chimpanzee
sequences are specific to the chimpanzee, with the other
primate sequences having the same state as the human
sequence.
One likely explanation for the high number of PSGs in the
chimpanzee lineage could be the reported high polymorphism in the individual chimpanzee sequenced (heterozygosity rate of 9.5 × 10-4 [9]). This rate is slightly higher
than what was seen among West African chimpanzees
(8.0 × 10-4 [9]) which have similar diversity levels to that
seen in human populations [39]. Population size is
another possible explanation as positive selection may
have had a reduced efficacy in humans than in chimpanzees due to the larger long-term population size of chimpanzees compared to humans indicated by reduced
nucleotide diversity and elevated polymorphism among
chimpanzee sequences [40].
PSGs implicated in diseases with biomedical differences
between mammals
Overall, we observed that PSGs were over-represented
among genes found in OMIM. Yet in contrast to the findings of Clark et al. [14], PSGs along the human lineage
were not seen to display any over-representation in
OMIM. Our findings, however, were consistent with other
recent studies that found no significant associations [9] or
only marginal associations [16] between human PSGs
and human diseases. The OMIM database is the most
complete freely available source of disease associated

non-pathological conditions such as hair colour; hence

during statistical tests. Tests for enrichment of PSGs
within more precise collections of disease genes may yield
different results.
Examination of individual PSGs along the human and
hominid lineages, revealed genes implicated in diseases
that show biomedical differences between mammals.
Below we illustrate how some of the human and hominid
PSGs identified in our study are linked to medical conditions described as being more prevalent or having increasing severity in humans compared to apes [1,2].
Epithelial cancers
Human epithelial cancers are thought to be the cause of
over 20% of deaths in modern human populations
whereas among non-human primates, the rates are as low
as 2–4% [41]. Although this may be partly attributed to
carcinogenic factors in the lifestyles of modern humans
and differences in life expectancy, there are many intriguing lines of evidence to suggest that another overwhelming factor is the presence of susceptibility genes in human
[8,42-47].

Among the human lineage PSGs detected here a number
of genes have been implicated in the development of epithelial cancers:
• MC1R (melanocortin-1 receptor) modulates the quantity and type of melanin synthesised in melanocytes.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with melanomas [48]. An allele of this gene associated with pale skin
colour and red hair, was recently located in the Neanderthal sequence [49] which suggests that this gene was also
under recent selection in human evolution. Functional
changes in the human MC1R gene which causes a change
in skin colour could lead to an increased susceptibility to
ultra-violet radiation and hence higher levels of
melanoma in humans.
• The G-protein coupled receptor EDNRB (endothelin
type-B receptor) and its physiological ligand, endothelin
3, are thought to play key roles in the development of
melanocytes and other neural crest lineages [50]. EDNRB
promotes early expansion and migration of melanocyte
precursors and delays their differentiation. EDNRB is
greatly enhanced during the transformation of normal
melanocytes to melanoma cells where it is thought to play
a role in the associated loss of differentiation seen in
melanoma cells [51].
• The presence of the ALPPL2 gene product, an alkaline
phosphatase isoenzyme, has been shown to increase the
potential of premeiotic male germ cells to malignant
transformation. Increased promoter activity of this gene
was seen in the process of tumour progression. ALPPL2

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:273

has now been confirmed as a marker for testicular germ
cell tumours [52].
• GIPC2 mRNAs are expressed in cells derived from a diffuse-type of gastric cancer, and also shows increased
expression in several cases of primary gastric cancer [53].
The PDZ domain of the GIPC2 protein interacts with several genes that are involved in modulation of growth factor signalling and cell adhesion (e.g. FZD3, IGF-1 and
NTRK1). Thus GIPC2 may play key roles in carcinogenesis
and embryogenesis.
In the hominid lineage, several PSGs have also been
implicated in epithelial cancer development suggesting
differences in cancer disease processes between hominids
and other mammals:
• MSH2 is a DNA mismatch-repair gene that was identified as a common locus in which germline mutations
cause hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)
[54]. As deficiencies in any DNA repair gene would potentially increase cancer risk, this group of genes is of interest
in investigation of species differences in cancer prevalence. We found that genes which are involved in DNA
repair and nucleotide metabolism were over-represented
for PSGs along the chimpanzee and human lineages
respectively (Figure 2). Enrichment of PSGs within the
nucleotide metabolism category has also been reported
previously [38].
• The ABCC11 [ABC-binding cassette, subfamily C, member 11] gene product is highly expressed in breast cancer
compared to normal tissue. ABCC11 is regulated by ERα,
which mediates the tumour promoting effects of estrogens in breast cancer [55].
Ataxia and Migraine
The calcium channel gene, CACNA1A, was found to be
under positive selection along the human lineage. In
humans, mutations in CACNA1A are associated with
channelopathies, such as spinocerebellar ataxia 6 and episodic ataxia type 2 [56] as well as with more prevalent
conditions such as familial hemiplegic migraine, dystonia, epilepsy, myasthenia and even intermittent coma
[57]. It is possible that the trafficking or signal modulation of CACNA1A differs between humans and other
mammals as a result of adaptation of the central nervous
system, which could result in humans being more prone
to these neurological disorders. The benefits of enhanced
CNS excitability may outweigh the risk of severe headache
and disability, the symptoms of migraines [58]. It could
also be an artefact of design constraints in the brain resulting from imperfect interconnections between older and
more recently evolved brain structures [4].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/273

Alzheimer's disease
A gene implicated in Alzheimer's disease [59,60], APOE,
was under positive selection along the hominid lineage.
Selection for functional changes of the APOE gene in the
hominid lineage could be related to either its role in neurological development or in lipid metabolism. Of the
eight amino acids found to be under positive selection in
this study, four are present in the lipid-binding carboxyl
terminus.

The suggestion that there are species differences in Alzheimer's disease between humans and other mammalian
species comes from the lack of pathological lesions
including the neurofibrillary tangles associated with
human Alzheimer's disease being observed in the brains
of elderly chimpanzees [6,61] or elephants [62]. Also,
transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that presented β-amyloid neuropathology do not exhibit the cognitive decline at the first appearance of amyloid plaques
seen in humans [63]. Finally and intriguingly, mammals
other than humans seem to have just one allelic form of
APOE, the E4 allele [60,64], the same form in humans
predisposes carriers to a much higher risk of Alzheimer's
disease [65].
We hypothesise that the positive selection pressure acting
on APOE during hominid evolution changed the role of
APOE in neurological development, presumably in concert with the expansion of cognitive ability. However,
alternative studies have suggested that the major evolutionary events associated with cognition have occurred
much earlier [66]. A consequence of increased cognitive
ability maybe increased susceptibility to dementing diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [67] but as the onset of
these diseases is past reproductive age, these diseases
would be overlooked by natural selection. The other possibility is that dietary pressures influenced the evolution
of APOE in mammals, with species adapting to diets with
differential levels of lipids and so favouring different
forms of APOE [68].
Schizophrenia
Neurological studies have shown that brain areas differentially dysregulated in schizophrenia are also subject to the
most evolutionary change in the human lineage [69]. A
number of PSGs along the human lineage are associated
with schizophrenia:

• SNPs in the gene PIK3C2G [phosphoinositide-3-kinase]
have been shown to be associated with schizophrenia
recently [70]. This gene is related to the phosphoinositide
pathway, and thus is a probable candidate for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [71].

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:273

• Another candidate for chronic schizophrenia is the
Q399 allele of the XRCC1 protein, which plays a role in
base excision repair [72]. The pathophysiology of schizophrenia is associated with an increased susceptibility to
apoptosis. Mutations in XRCC1 may cause DNA damage
which if detected cause apoptosis regulators to arrest cell
cycle progression.
Other cognitive disorders
Also subject to positive selection along the human lineage
was the gene GFRA3, a receptor for artemin and a member
of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
family of ligands. This gene acts as a signalling factor regulating the development and maintenance of many sympathetic neuronal populations [73]. In particular, along
with other GDNF family members, artemin plays a role in
synaptic plasticity, a mechanism thought to be central to
memory [74]. Deficiencies in GFRA3 would be expected
to cause cognitive impairment making it a candidate gene
for cognitive disorders.
Autoimmune diseases
Autoimmune diseases are rare in non-human primates
whereas they are relatively common in humans [41].
CENP-B is one of three centromere DNA binding proteins
that are present in centromere heterochromatin throughout the cell cycle. Autoantibodies to these proteins are
often seen in patients with autoimmune diseases, such as
limited systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
and rheumatoid arthritis [75]. The positive selection pressure acting on this gene during human evolution is consistent with experimental results that antigenic specificity
in the C-terminus of CENP-B is species-specific [76].
Positive selection of regulatory genes
Selection events on coding sequences may also have
effects on gene expression regulation. One transcription
factor that showed signs of positive selection along the
human lineage was HIVEP3 (immunodeficiency virus
type I enhancer binding protein 3). This gene belongs to a
family of zinc-finger proteins whose functions include
activating HIV gene expression by binding to the NF-kappaB motif of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat [77]. It is
commonly known that HIV infection in chimpanzees
does not progress to the level of medical complexity that
is seen in human AIDS [41]. In chimpanzees the virus
lives in a benign relationship within the immune system
whereas in humans it infects and destroys helper T-cells.
Functional changes in transcription factors such as
HIVEP3 between humans and chimpanzees could explain
the observed differences in HIV disease progression.

Regulatory elements of gene expression also showed evidence of positive selection along the human lineage. One
is the MOV10 gene (Moloney leukaemia virus 10,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/273

homolog), an RNA helicase contained in a multiprotein
complex along with proteins of the 60S ribosome subunit.
MOV10 is associated with human RISC (RNA-induced
silencing complex) [78]. RNA silencing or interference
(RNAi) has been recently described as an important therapeutic application for modulating gene expression at the
transcript level or for silencing disease-causing genes
[79,80]. Any functional changes in the MOV10 gene due
to selection may affect transcriptional control of multiple
genes and would therefore prompt widespread differences
among species.

Conclusion
We conclude that comparative evolutionary genomics has
an important contribution to make to the study of mammalian disease, enabling identification of candidate genes
for further in vivo investigation. Researchers traditionally
see the biomedical differences between humans and
model organisms as an obstacle to progress. However, we
propose these differences also provide an opportunity to
dissect the molecular causes of disease. To take advantage
of this opportunity, we need powerful computational evolutionary algorithms (such as used in this study) and a
robust approach to utilise the ever-expanding genomic
sequence data. Two major challenges inherent to this
approach are: firstly, sequence errors are likely to increase
the false positive rates in identifying cases of positive
selection pressure and secondly, to fully utilize this information requires detailed accounts of the physiological differences in disease occurrence and symptomatology
between species which are currently sparse.
Understanding the evolutionary history of disease genes
can also significantly impact the choice of pre-clinical animal models in the drug discovery process [81]. The success rates in pharmaceutical pipelines remains low, one
reason being the difficulty in successfully translating
safety and efficacy studies from animal models to
humans. Pre-clinical studies assume that drug targets in
the experimental species and in humans are functionally
equivalent, which is not always the case [38]. In particular, animal models of neurodegenerative diseases have
been shown to lack predictive validity in humans [82].
Studies of selection pressure during gene evolution can
provide valuable information for the choice of animal
models for drug target validation. Our results of PSGs in
the five mammalian species serve as an informative
resource that can be consulted prior to selecting appropriate animal models during drug target validation in the
pharmaceutical industry.
Positive selection pressure would be expected to act not
just on one gene at a time but on pathways of genes. We
found that genes that were subject to positive selection
along the same lineage were significantly more likely to

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:273

interact with each other than with genes not under positive selection, the first evidence for co-evolution of genes
as a widespread phenomenon in mammals. We suggest
that the high level of connectivity between PSGs is caused
by compensatory change of a protein's interaction partners when a protein undergoes change in response to
selection.
We observe many chimpanzee genes which have been
subject to positive selection during the evolution of their
anthropoid ancestor. Since medical research and the vast
majority of biological research have been focussed on discovering more about human biology, we know a lot less
about chimpanzee-specific characteristics. The number of
PSGs on the chimpanzee lineage would suggest that these
chimpanzee adaptations are at least as striking as our
much-vaunted human-specificities.

Methods
Sequence data
We analysed all Entrez human genes (accessed in September 2006) that were annotated as protein coding and had
a confirmed mRNA sequence. The longest open reading
frame associated with each gene was included in the starting set. Curated mRNA sequences from the RefSeq NCBI
database and genomic sequences for the four model
organisms (chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog) and chicken
(outgroup) were extracted from GenBank (accessed in
September 2006).
Orthologue calls
The orthologue detection pipeline used reciprocal tBlastX
searches [83] between the human and model organism
sequence databases. If the highest scoring non-human
species sequence was genomic, indicating an mRNA
sequence was not available for this gene in this species, it
was processed via GeneWise [84] to identify a predicted
gene structure and remove introns, using the human peptide as template. The resulting cDNA sequence was then
used as a query in the reciprocal tBlastX search against the
human database. Highest scoring mRNA sequences were
submitted to the reciprocal tBlastX search without modification.

Reciprocal best hits between the human gene and the
model organism gene were marked as the orthologue pair
for that human transcript query on the condition that the
log of the p value from the best hit of the human mRNA
sequence against the model organism database was higher
than 95% of the log of the p value of the best hit from the
reciprocal step.
Incomplete genome sequencing will also contribute to
error in orthologue calling. Reciprocal blasting is invalidated as a method for calling orthologues in these circum-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/273

stances as the absence of the true orthologue would cause
a more divergent paralogue to be the top hit. To address
this problem we added a cut-off, which required the p
value of the putative orthologue for that species to be less
than that of the chicken orthologue for that gene. The
chicken was chosen because it was the closest relative to
mammals for which a complete draft genome sequence
was available at sufficient coverage [85]. For the 262
human genes with no chicken orthologue, those predicted
by reciprocal BLAST alone were analysed but these genes
were flagged as potential problems.
Detecting genes affected by positive selection
The resulting sets of 5 orthologous sequences were translated and aligned using Muscle [86], then converted to
corresponding nucleotide alignments. All alignments
were then corrected for frameshifts in the sequences from
the model organisms relative to human. Unrooted tree
files for each alignment were created using a standard
mammalian species tree [87] ((human, chimpanzee),
(mouse, rat), dog) (Figure 1). Initially, data sets were analyzed using the M0 (one-ratio) model implemented in the
codeml program from the PAML package [88]. The M0
model assumes constant ω ratio for all branches in the
tree and among all codon sites in the gene [89]. Two runs
of the M0 model were performed on each alignment to
check that values for log-likelihood, κ and branch lengths
were consistent between the two runs. Runs that were not
consistent were rerun until the values converged. In the
subsequent analyses using the branch-site model, the
branch lengths and the transition/transversion rate ratio κ
were fixed to their estimates under the M0 model. This
strategy reduces the computation time as the number of
parameters to be estimated is reduced.

To infer the lineage specific evolution of genes, the
branch-site model [18,19] was used to test for positive
selection. We tested each of the seven branches on the species phylogeny, treating each in turn as the foreground
branch. Results prior to multiple hypothesis correction
should not be used for subsequent analysis as the familywise error rate is unacceptably high [90]. Here we report
results following a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing which is known to be conservative and hence, prediction of positive selection is particularly robust. The
corollary of such a strict approach is the potential generation of false negatives. The alternative branch-site model
has four codon site categories, the first two for sites evolving under purifying selection and neutral selection on all
the lineages and the additional two for sites under positive
selection on the foreground branch. The null model
restricts sites on the foreground lineage to be undergoing
neutral evolution. Each branch-site model was run at least
three times to ensure convergence of log-likelihood values
at or within 0.001. Runs that did not converge with addi-

tional runs indicated problems with the data and reported
as such.
Data Curation
When the data from the automated procedures was examined closely, it was noted that some alignments had areas
of ambiguous alignment or areas where sequences did not
appear orthologous. Areas of non-orthology could result
from incomplete gene predictions due to gaps in the
genomic sequence or absent or variant exons. Therefore
the data were subjected to further manual corrections
detailed below:

1. To correct for regions of low similarity, all alignments
were scanned to mask out parts of a sequence where > 3
consecutive codons were different to the other sequences
in the alignment and where these codons were flanked by
gaps on one or both sides. Sequences that also contained
frameshifts relative to the human sequence were corrected.
2. After re-running PAML on the entire dataset, we manually examined the alignments of all significant results (p <
0.05). The result was discarded if the gene sequence
belonging to the lineage that was identified as being
under positive selection had a frameshift or was ambiguously aligned.
Analysis of interaction data
A network consisting of protein-protein interactions such
as binding and phosphorylation, transcriptional control
and post-translational modification was used to search if
genes under positive selection interact together. Interaction data in the network was licensed from several commercial vendors including Ingenuity [91], Jubilant [92],
GeneGO [93], NetPro [94] and HPRD [95]. All of the
information from these databases is based on manual
curation of literature. In addition, high-quality, automatically extracted interactions licensed from the PRIME database [96] were also included in the network. Interactions
associated with transcriptional regulation were obtained
from experimental validation protein-DNA binding relationships licensed from the TransFac [97] and TRRD [98]
databases. No distinction is made between DNA, RNA
and protein for a particular gene, and all three are represented as a single node in the network. Searches of gene
lists that resulted in a biological sub-network were conducted and scored as in [36].
