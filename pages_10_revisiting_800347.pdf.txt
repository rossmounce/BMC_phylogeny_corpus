Abstract
Background: Rodents are recognized as hosts for at least 60 zoonotic diseases and may represent a serious threat for
human health. In the context of global environmental changes and increasing mobility of humans and animals,
contacts between pathogens and potential animal hosts and vectors are modified, amplifying the risk of disease
emergence. An accurate identification of each rodent at a specific level is needed in order to understand their
implications in the transmission of diseases. Among the Muridae, the Rattini tribe encompasses 167 species inhabiting
South East Asia, a hotspot of both biodiversity and emerging and re-emerging diseases. The region faces growing
economical development that affects habitats, biodiversity and health. Rat species have been demonstrated as
significant hosts of pathogens but are still difficult to recognize at a specific level using morphological criteria. DNAbarcoding methods appear as accurate tools for rat species identification but their use is hampered by the need of
reliable identification of reference specimens. In this study, we explore and highlight the limits of the current taxonomy
of the Rattini tribe.
Results: We used the DNA sequence information itself as the primary information source to establish group
membership and estimate putative species boundaries. We sequenced two mitochondrial and one nuclear genes
from 122 rat samples to perform phylogenetic reconstructions. The method of Pons and colleagues (2006) that
determines, with no prior expectations, the locations of ancestral nodes defining putative species was then applied to
our dataset. To give an appropriate name to each cluster recognized as a putative species, we reviewed information
from the literature and obtained sequences from a museum holotype specimen following the ancient DNA criteria.
Conclusions: Using a recently developed methodology, this study succeeds in refining the taxonomy of one of the
most difficult groups of mammals. Most of the species expected within the area were retrieved but new putative
species limits were also indicated, in particular within Berylmys and Rattus genera, where future taxonomic studies
should be directed. Our study lays the foundations to better investigate rodent-born diseases in South East Asia and
illustrates the relevance of evolutionary studies for health and medical sciences.
Background
Among mammals, rodents are recognized as major hosts
and vectors of parasites and pathogens, some of them
causing important zoonoses and representing a serious
threat for human health [1-5]. Most epidemiological
studies have focused on the most common rodents with
emphasis on commensal species such as the laboratory

rat, Rattus norvegicus. A common assumption is that the
rodent species responsible for disease transmission are
those living close to humans, but since wild species distant from human settlements have been proven to play a
key role in maintaining, spreading and transmitting
pathogens and parasites (e.g. [4]), this point of view is
being questionned. Specific diversity within the host
community has also been shown to play an important
function in the maintenance of a disease and in the probability of its transmission to humans [6,7]. Consequently,

researchers are now focusing not on a single particular
host species but on the whole host community and are
endeavouring to understand the role of each rodent species in the context of the entire host-pathogen community.
Today this knowledge is more urgent than ever since
biodiversity in many areas is being altered rapidly by the
ongoing global change. Because of anthropogenic disturbances, the host-pathogen interactions are being dramatically modified leading to new and unexpected disease
risks and the emergence and/or re-emergence of infectious diseases [6-10]. To be able to predict and to anticipate some of these risks, one should be able in the case of
rodent host communities, to identify first and foremost
each rodent at a specific level, a real challenge when considering that rodents represent 40% of mammalian species [11] including many cryptic species, and that new
genera and species are yearly described (e.g. Laonastes
aenigmamus, [12]; Saxatilomys paulinae, [13]; Mayermys
germani, [14]; Tonkinomys daovantieni, [15]).
Among Muridae rodents, the Rattini tribe encompasses
35 genera corresponding to 167 rat species [16] following
the tribal arrangement of the Murinae proposed by
Lecompte et al. [17]. Nearly all representatives of this
tribe inhabit South East Asia, a major hotspot of biodiversity [18] faced with a runaway economic growth damaging habitats, biodiversity and health but also a hotspot
of emerging and re-emerging diseases [19,20]. If the partition of the tribe among five divisions (i.e. Crunomys,
Dacnomys, Maxomys, Micromys and Rattus divisions)
[16,17] is widely accepted, its taxonomy remains however
largely untested phylogenetically and its delimitations are
not yet secured. Chiropodomys, Vandeleuria, Hapalomys,
Haeromys and Vernaya genera were included in the
Micromys division by Musser and Carleton [16]. As the
Eurasian harvest mouse, Micromys was proven to belong
to the Rattini tribe ([17,21]), the whole Micromys division
should belong to the Rattini tribe if Musser and Carleton's assumption is right. However, some of these genera
(i.e. Chiropodomys and Vandeleuria) were recently shown
to be unaffiliated to Micromys according to molecular
evidences [21], while putative representatives of the Rattini tribe (i.e. Tonkinomys daovantieni, Saxatilomys paulinae, Srilankamys sp., Hapalomys sp., Haeromys sp.,
Vernaya sp.) have not been investigated using molecular
data and are currently considered as Murinae incertae
sedis [17]. Numerous rat species have been demonstrated
or postulated as major hosts of pathogens (e.g. Hantaviruses described from bandicoot rat, Bandicota indica in
Thailand, [22,23]; Bandicota indica, B. savilei, Berylmys
berdmorei, Niviventer sp., and Rattus sp. serologically
tested positive for Rickettsia tsutsugamushi, the agent
responsible for scrub typhus [24]; etc.). Although easily
identified at a generic level by an expert, Asian rats are

often difficult to discriminate at a specific level using
morphological or cytological criteria. The wide range of
intra-specific morphological variation makes morphological criteria unsuitable for accurate rat species identification and has led to an over-description of species and to a
confusing taxonomy, hampered by an overabundance of
synonyms. It is particularly true concerning the Rattus
genus (e.g. 41 synonyms for R. norvegicus, 83 for R. rattus,
etc. [16] and see also [25]) that consists of a heterogeneous accumulation of species and of several monophyletic clusters that may or may not prove to be grouped in a
single genus [16]. This polyphyletic pattern is highlighted
by the six species groups proposed by Musser and Carleton [16] (i.e. the Rattus rattus, Rattus exulans, Rattus
norvegicus, Rattus fuscipes, Rattus leucopus and Rattus
xanthurus species groups) and a seventh assemblage containing unaffiliated species (i.e. the Rattus species group
unresolved) for which phylogenetic affinities are uncertain; some representatives will eventually be removed
from the genus. Even karyotypic criteria, which previously claimed to be species diagnostic tools, were
recently revealed to be unsuitable to discriminate
between Asian rat species [26]. DNA-based methods,
however, appear to be promising tools for easy and accurate rat species-specific identifications [26].
Robins et al. [25] were the first to attempt to identify
Rattus species using mitochondrial DNA sequences
mostly obtained from museum tissue samples. Nevertheless, their conclusions based on DNA-barcoding and tree
based methods were limited because these methods need
reliably identified specimens as reference. Specimens and
tissues offered by museums to scientists are collected by
many different people and it seems likely, given the extent
of some misidentifications, that rat species identification
is not an easy task even for mammal specialists. Moreover, the taxonomy of the tribe Rattini is complex and
changing and often different to that in use when samples
were first described and listed in museums [25].
Level of variation in cytochrome b sequences was also
proposed as a reference point in making decisions concerning species-level distinctions [27]. Based on the analysis of 4 genera of rodents, Bradley and Baker [27]
suggested that genetic distance values lesser than 2%
were indicative of intraspecific variation and values
higher than 11% of species recognition. But how to conclude between 2 and 11% ? The DNA-based species
delimitation approach proposed by Pons et al. [28] relies
on DNA sequence information itself as the primary information source for establishing group membership and
defining putative species and does not require defining
entities as priors. This method was shown to be useful for
identifying meaningful entities among groups whose current taxonomy is incomplete (e.g. tiger beetles of the
genus Rivacindela, [28]) or uncertain (e.g. aphids of the

Pagès et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:184

genus Brachycaudus) and has already been successfully
applied when species are difficult to conceptualize (e.g.
bacteria [29] or for asexual animals, [30,31]). Using a likelihood framework, this new procedure detects the point
of transition in the rate of lineage branching of a tree
from interspecific long branches to intraspecific short
burgeoning branching and identifies clusters of specimens corresponding to putative species.
In our study, we used molecular data to test the limits
of the current taxonomy of the Rattini tribe. We aimed at
identifying where species boundaries are unclear and
where further investigations need to be carried out to
provide a more rigorous systematic framework for epidemiological surveys. As molecular data are useful to detect
and distinguish morphologically similar species, this
study investigated the existence of putative cryptic species among the Rattini tribe (i.e. two or more species that
are classified as a single nominal species because they are
at least superficially morphologically indistinguishable
[32]). To these aims, we first sequenced two mitochondrial and one nuclear genes from rat specimens coming
from Southeast Asia (Thailand, Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic) to perform phylogenetic
reconstructions. Then, as morphological characters are
often misleading, we applied the method developed by
Pons et al. [28] that determines, with no prior expectations, the locations of ancestral nodes to define putative
species. Finally, we endeavoured to give a name to each
cluster recognized as a putative species using information
from the literature and also sequences obtained from a
museum holotype specimen following all the ancient
DNA guidelines.

Methods
1. Sampling

116 specimens of Rattini were selected among the 3,000
trapped by our team in the fields mostly in Thailand and
punctually in Cambodia and in Lao PDR. Specimens
selected were chosen in order to maximise the number of
species and geographic locations analysed. Field specimen identifications and locality information are listed in
Table 1 and indicated in Figure 1. Field identifications
were made based on morphological criteria according to
[11,33-35]. Based on morphological and cytological evidences, no specimen was identified by us as a representative of the cosmopolitan Rattus rattus species.
Considering their preponderant place in epidemiological
surveys, 4 worldwide black rat specimens (identified in
[36]) were added to the sample set. To provide an appropriate outgroup, we included specimens of the Eurasian
harvest mouse, Micromys belonging to the Rattini tribe
and previously recognized as the sister lineage to the Rattus group sensu lato of Verneau et al., [37,38,17,21]. In
total, our taxa sampling consisted of 122 rats.

For nomenclatural prospects, a small piece of skin from
the holotype specimen of Leopoldamys neilli was also
analysed in this study. The type specimen is the male
n°54-4330 from the Centre for Thai National Reference
collections, collected by W.A. Neill in 1973 at Wat Tham
Prapothisat, in the Saraburi Province (Kaengkhoi District, Thailand, 14°35'N X 101°8'E) (see [33] for further
details).
2. Sequence acquisition

Three genes proven valuable for rodent systematics were
considered for the phylogenetic analyses [39,40,25,17].
We targeted two mitochondrial markers, the cytochrome
b (cytb) and the cytochrome c oxydase I (COI) genes and
the first exon of the nuclear gene encoding the interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP).
To avoid contamination, pre-amplification procedures
and post-amplification analyses were performed in independent rooms in the laboratory. DNA was extracted
from tissue with DNEasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Primer sets
used to amplify the cytb, COI and IRBP genes are listed in
Table 2. All amplifications were carried out in 25 μL reactions containing about 30 ng of extracted DNA, 0.2 mg/
mL BSA (Roche, 1 mg/mL), 300 μM of each dNTP, 0.2
μM of each primer, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Qiagen), 2.5
μL of 10X buffer, 0.5 mM of extra MgCl2. Cycling conditions were as follows: one activation step at 94°C for 4
min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s,
annealing at 48°C-58°C depending on the primers (Table
2) for 30 s, elongation at 72°C for 45 s-1'30 min depending on the length of the target (1 minute per kb), and a
final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were
sequenced by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea).
3. Phylogenetic analyses

Sequences were aligned by eye using SEAVIEW [41] and
translated into peptide sequences using the Transeq
EMBOSS tool [42] to exclude putative NUMt copies and
to ensure sequence orthology. As the risk of homoplasy
by convergence and reversal is reduced by considering a
large number of characters [43], we combined the three
genes into a single dataset using the DAMBE software
[44]. Thus, a total of 3,068 bp were considered in the subsequent phylogenetic analyses.
Base composition bias was evaluated using PAUP*
v4.0b10 [45], and a chi-square test was performed to
check for taxa with deviations of nucleotide composition.
Substitutional saturation was assessed via saturation
plots. Using DAMBE [44], the absolute number of transitions was plotted against MLComposite TN93 (TamuraNei Model) distance for all pairwise comparisons of taxa.
For the three genes, the curve did not reach a plateau
when subtracting the third codon position, but did reach

and without RY-coding). Taking into account that PhyML
does not allow data-partitioning, partitioned ML analysis
was also performed using RAxML 7.0.4 [49]. As the
model choice is limited in RAxML, the general timereversible (GTR) + Γ model (option -m GTRGAMMA)
was selected for the three partitions (option -q multipleModelFileName), and individual α-shape parameters,
GTR-rates and base frequencies were estimated and optimized for each partition. Robustness of the tree was
assessed using the rapid bootstrap procedure (option -f a)
with 100 replications (option -# numberOfRuns) [50].
Bayesian analyses were performed using MrBayes v3.1
[51]. Four independent runs of 5,000,000 generations
each were performed applying appropriate independent
models of evolution to each gene. A burn-in period of
1,000,000 generations was determined graphically using
Tracer1.2 [52]. For each dataset, all runs gave similar tree
topologies and posterior probability (pp) values.
Alternative topologies were finally tested for significance using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH test) [53]
(RELL option, 1000 Bp replicates) in PAUP* v4.0b10 [45].

a plateau when considering the entire sequences (data not
shown). To discard fast evolving transitions and improve
inferences without drastically compromising the resolution, we decided to recode the third codon position
nucleotides to two state categories, R (purine) and Y
(pyrimidine), (RY-coding strategy; [46]).
Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using two probabilistic approaches: maximum likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian inferences (BI). The appropriate model of evolution was first determined for each gene and for the concatenated dataset (with and without RY-coding) using
corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) and
MrAIC [47]. The HKY+I+Γ model was selected for both
the cytb and COI genes while the GTR+ Γ was selected
for the IRBP gene and the combined dataset (with and
without RY-coding). ML analyses were performed with
PhyML-v2.4.4 [48]. For each analysis, the transition/
transversion ratio, the proportion of invariable sites as
well as the gamma distribution parameter (if necessary)
were estimated and the starting tree was determined by
BioNJ analysis of the dataset (default settings). Using
optimization options, 500 bootstrap (Bp) replicates were
performed. PhyML analyses were first run independently
on each locus and then on the combined dataset (with

We used the DNA-based approach proposed by Pons et
al. [28]. Using a likelihood framework, this new procedure detects the switch in the rate of lineage branching of
a tree from interspecific long branches to intraspecific
short budding branching and identifies clusters of specimens corresponding to putative species. Two models are
implemented to account for the branching process of the
entire tree. Under the null model, the whole sample
derives from a single population obeying a coalescent
process. The alternative model, called general mixed Yule
coalescent (GMYC) model combines equations that separately describe branching within populations (coalescent
process) and branching between species (a Yule model
including speciation and extinction rates). Under the
GMYC model, a threshold (T) is optimized such that
nodes before the threshold are considered as species
diversification events, whereas branches crossing the
threshold define clusters following a coalescent process.
A standard likelihood ratio test (LRT) is used to assess
whether the alternative model provides a better fit than
the null model. If the GMYC model is favoured over the
null model, the T parameter of the maximum likelihood
solution allows the number of species to be estimated.
This test was achieved using the R code provided by T. G.
Barraclough. This latest version outputs the estimates of
the number of species, of the threshold time and their
95% confidence limits (i.e. solutions with 2-log likelihood
units of the maximum).
Because a pre-requisite of the method is an ultrametric
tree, we used the relaxed Bayesian dating method imple-

mented in Multidivtime [54] to convert our optimal phylogram tree (estimated from the Bayesian analysis of the
combined dataset) in a rooted additive tree with terminal
nodes equally distant to the root. In this aim, we followed
the documentation files written by Rutschmann [55] and
the procedure detailed in [29]. The settings for the
Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses were slightly modified (200,000 cycles in which the Markov chain was sampled 20,000 times every 10th cycle following a burnin
period of 100,000 cycles). No fossil is described to calibrate our Rattini phylogeny. As our aim was simply to
obtain an ultrametric tree, prior ages to lineages were
arbitrarily assigned to 1 (rttm = 1; rttmsd = 0). The mean
of the prior distribution for the rate of molecular evolution at the ingroup root node (rtrate) was computed as
the mean of the median of the amount of evolution for
the different tips of the three independent gene trees
(rtrate = 0.735; rtratesd = 0.367).
5. Species identification
5.1. Within the Rattus genus

Rattus cytb (663 bp) and COI (655 bp) sequences
obtained by Robins et al. [25] were extracted from GenBank and added to our mitochondrial (mt) dataset (see
Table 3). As our study focuses on rodents from the Indochinese region, sequences of species belonging to the
Rattus fuscipes species group (i.e. native Australian species) and to the Rattus leucopus species group (i.e. species

indigenous to New Guinea and adjacent archipelagos)
were not incorporated in this dataset. Two other unpublished cytb sequences of R. argentiventer and R. sikkimensis (synonym of R. andamanensis) provided by O.
Verneau and F. Catzeflis were also included in the subsequent analysis. Sequences of a single representative of
Berylmys, Niviventer, Leopoldamys, Maxomys and Micromys were used to root our mitochondrial phylogeny.
Therefore, the mt dataset included 129 sequences corresponding to 1,318 bp of mt DNA. Partitioned ML analysis
was performed using RAxML 7.0.4 [49] and the same
options as before.
5.2. Ancient DNA analysis of a holotype specimen

For species assignment, we tested the relevance of DNA
sequences obtained from a holotype specimen. As
museum samples contain tiny amounts of poorly preserved DNA, we selected a 85 bp fragment of the cytb
gene, corresponding to positions from 666 to 750 of the
gene sequence of Rattus norvegicus (NCBI accession
number [GenBank NC_001665]). This fragment was chosen for the following reasons: i) it corresponds to an
highly variable region of the gene that allows the discrimination of most vertebrate species including the closest
related ones [56] ii) its short length is suited for the PCR
amplification of degraded DNA [56] and iii) it has proved
valuable for species assignment based on degraded DNA
extracted from archaeological samples [57].

"Nominal species" stands for the identification given to the specimen by the curator or the collector ([25] and F. Catzeflis, pers. comm.).
"Phylogenetic species" relies on the DNA-based species delimitation method (see also Figure 3).
(1) Rattus rattus diardi: Robins et al [25] reports that the specimens ABTC64906-64910 are identified by the South Australian Museum as the
subspecies Rattus rattus diardi (not diardii) as listed by Ellerman [71] on the basis on R. r. diardi after Jentink [72]. As already mentioned by Robins
et al., [25], R. diardii (after Jentink 1880) is however considered as a synonym for R. tanezumi by Musser and Carleton [16] but there is no 1880
reference in their bibliography.
(2) R. kandianus is listed as a synonym of R. rattus [16], (3) R. flavipectus of R. tanezumi [16], (4) R. sikkimensis of R. andamanensis [16].
** indicates that specimens are no more available in the mammal tissue collection housed at the Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de
Montpellier [73].
Mismatches between nominal species and phylogenetic species are highlighted in bold.

To check if it provides adequate discrimination for rat
species, the whole cytb sequences of the 122 specimens
were reduced to the 85 bp fragment following the groups
evidenced by the DNA-based species delimitation
method. Based on our sampling, rat species could be easily discriminated with this small sequence (except the two
entities hereafter named Be2a and Be2b but see discussion) (see the 85 bp alignment in additional file 1). So, we
decided to target this DNA barcode from the holotype of
Leopoldamys neilli.
As we used a museum specimen, the difficulties associated with ancient DNA studies are relevant to this analy-

sis. Hence, ancient DNA work was performed at the
PALGENE national platform (CNRS, ENS Lyon, France)
dedicated to ancient DNA analysis, following the standard procedures and using specific equipment and personal protections [58,59].
DNA was extracted from the holotype of Leopoldamys
neilli following the protocol detailed by Rohland and
Hofreiter [60]. Primer sets declined from Télétchéa et al.,
[56] were used for PCR attempts (Table 2). At least two
independent PCR amplifications were performed in 25
μL reaction volumes containing 2.5 units of Perkin Elmer
Gold Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 1 mg/mL

Pagès et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:184
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/184

BSA (Roche, 20 mg/mL), 2 mM MgCl2, 250 μM of each
dNTP, 0.5 μM of primers. For each independent PCR
attempt, a range of dilutions was performed to find the
best compromise between inhibitor's concentration and
targeted DNA molecule concentration. DNA was amplified with a 5 min activation step at 95°C followed by 55
cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 s), annealing (48°C, 30 s)
and elongation (72°C, 45 s). Amplification products were
systematically cloned using Topo TA Cloning for
sequencing kit (Invitrogen). 16 clones of independent
amplifications were sequenced to determine the consensus sequence (Macrogen, Seoul, South Korea).
The CAOS software, a two step character-based DNA
barcoding method [61] was then used to determine if the
Leopoldamys neilli holotype consensus sequence could
be assigned to one of the clusters recognized as a putative
species by the method of Pons et al., [28]. First, a diagnostic rules generator, P-Gnome, was used to search DNA
changes through the 85 bp cytb matrix (122 sequences)
and to establish diagnostic rule sets for each of the previously described entities (outputs of the DNA-based species delimitation method). Then, the P-Elf program was
run to classify as a query the holotype sequence according to the rules generated by P-Gnome.

Results
1. Sequence analyses and phylogenetic reconstructions

Cytb, IRBP and COI sequences were generated for 122,
120 and 116 rat specimens respectively. All sequences
were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers
HM217360 to HM217717 (Table 1). No significant difference in nucleotide composition among taxa was detected
which indicated that no artificial grouping could occur
due to a misleading compositional signal in the dataset.
PhyML analyses were first carried out on each locus independently (data not shown). Each gene considered separately does not result in a robust Rattini phylogeny:
mitochondrial markers help to resolve terminal nodes,
while IRBP lends support to deepest ones. But, since the
3 genes yielded consistent, compatible topologies,
sequences were concatenated and phylogenetic analyses
were then carried out using the combined dataset.
Identical topologies were obtained with and without a
RY-coding of the 3rd codon position (data not shown).
However, better resolution and stronger topological supports (Bp and pp) were reached without an RY recoding
strategy. It seems that our dataset was not informative
enough for a RY recoding strategy resulting in this case in
an over-depletion of the phylogenetic signal.
BI, partitioned and unpartitioned ML analyses (without
RY recoding strategy) yielded the identical topology given
in Figure 2. Most relationships among the Rattini tribe
were well resolved (supports 61-100 for Bp, 0.82-1.00 for
pp). Monophyletic groups corresponding to the Rattini

Page 13 of 27

divisions proposed by Musser and Carleton [16] are sustained with the highest values of Bp or pp. The Maxomys
division clearly appears as the first division to diverge followed by the Dacnomys division, here represented by
Leopoldamys and Niviventer genera, and the Rattus division. Berylmys appears with maximum support values as
the earliest lineage to diverge among the Rattus division.
A sister grouping is indicated between the genera Bandicota and Rattus, but this association is weakly supported.
In fact, the monophyly of the Rattus genus received moderate pp (0.82) to weak Bp supports (61 for unpartitioned,
63 for partitioned ML analyses). To test the reliability of
these findings, we considered an alternative hypothesis
concerning the position of Bandicota within the Rattus
division (i.e. Bandicota was placed inside the Rattus sp.
cluster). SH-test failed to find significant differences
between these hypotheses and the alternative branching
orders of Bandicota inside the Rattus division could not
be excluded (P > 0.05). Inside the Rattus sp. clade, the 3
Rattus species groups proposed by Musser and Carleton
[16] could be distinguished. The R. exulans monotypic
group (Re, Figure 2) clustered with the R. rattus species
group (Rr, Figure 2) with high branch supports (Bp = 94/
96 for the unpartitioned/partitioned ML analyses; pp = 1)
and the R. norvegicus species group (Rn, Figure 2) is
placed as sister taxa to the R. exulans species group/R.
rattus species group cluster.
At this point in the analysis, 23 lineages (labelled R1 to
M2 in the Figure 2) are identified within our taxon sampling. As their specific status are still questioned, intrageneric relationships are problematic to describe and will
not be discussed in this section.
2. Species delimitation

The existence of distinct phylogenetic lineages was corroborated by the analysis of the branching rate pattern. A
lineage-through-time plot based on the Multidivtime
ultrametric tree evidenced a sudden increase in branching rate towards the present, likely corresponding to the
switch from interspecies to intraspecies branching events
(see additional file 2). To fit the position of the switch, the
method of Pons et al. [28] was applied to the time calibrated tree (Figure 3). The GMYC model was preferred
over the null model of uniform branching rates (logL =
700.133, compared to null model logL = 687.218; 2ΔL=
25.83, χ2 test, d.f. = 3, p < 0.0001). The model fitted the
switch in the branching pattern occurring at -0.07084 (i.e.
T of the ML solution/it is worth reminding that the time
separating the ingroup root from the present was arbitrarily assigned to 1), leading to an estimate of 24 putative
species, 4 of which containing a single individual (labelled
R5, Be2b, N2 and N3 respectively in Figure 3). Two Maxomys (M1 and M2), 4 Niviventer (N1 to N4), 3 Leopoldamys (L1 to L3), 2 Bandicota (B1 and B2), 3 Berylmys

Pagès et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:184
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/184

(Be1, Be2a, Be2b) and 10 Rattus species (R1 to R10) could
be numbered as indicated in Figure 3. It is worth noting
that the Berylmys lineage (labelled Be2 in Figure 2) actually seems to correspond to two putative species following Pons et al's approach (therefore labelled Be2a and
Be2b in Figure 3). Confidence interval for the threshold
ranged from -0.09439 to -0.04189 and the estimated
number of species ranged from 22 to 32 (i.e. estimates
falling within 2 log-likelihood units of the ML solution).
3. Species identification
3.1. Within the Rattus genus

The partitioned ML analysis of the mt dataset including
64 new Rattus sequences (this study) plus 61 from previous studies [25] gave the highly resolved and robust tree
represented in Figure 4. This has allowed us to name
some clusters identified as putative species by the DNAbased species delimitation method. Because the monophyly of each cluster embracing the supplementary published sequences is supported with the highest Bp value,
the level of confidence of these identifications could be
considered as maximal if the voucher identification
beforehand is correct.
Robins' sequences identified as Rattus rattus cluster
with 100% Bp support with sequences assigned to R. rattus specimens in [36]. Specific identification of group R1
as Rattus rattus is thus convincingly confirmed. According to the mt tree, none of our samples from Thailand,
Cambodia or Lao PDR could be assigned to this species.
Following the same approach, R2 seems to correspond to
Rattus tanezumi, R5 to Rattus tiomanicus, R8 to Rattus
exulans and R9 to Rattus norvegicus. Sequences provided
by O. Verneau and F. Catzeflis allow us identifying R6 as
R. argentiventer and R7 as R. andamanensis. As expected,
since its distribution is restricted to Sulawesi, sequences
of Rattus hoffmanni group with none of our specimens.
R. hoffmanni whose phylogenetic affinities among the
Rattus rattus group need to be elucidated [16] appears as
the sister taxa to R. argentiventer with strong support (88
Bp). The situation appears more complex for the species
R3. This group corresponds to a mix of specimens identified as R. rattus diardi in [25], Rattus kandianus (considered as a synonym of R. rattus, [16]) in [25], R. tanezumi
from Indonesia [25] and R. tanezumi, R. andamanensis or
R. argentiventer according to the field names we assigned
during our sampling. Consequently, no nominal species
could be reliably assigned to R3.
According to morphological criteria and because its
sistership with Rattus norvegicus [16] (see Table 4 in discussion), R10 could be convincingly assigned to Rattus
nitidus.
3.2 Ancient DNA analysis of a holotype specimen

Sequences obtained from holotype specimen We successfully obtained 85 bp cytb sequences from the Leopol-

Page 14 of 27

damys neilli holotype. At least two independent PCR
runs were performed, positive PCR products were cloned
and consensus sequences were determined using clone
sequences of independent PCR amplifications. Analysis
of the differences observed between the clone sequences
and consensus sequence shows that 75% of the degradation was due to deamination of cytosines, as expected
from ancient DNA substrates [62,63].
Holotype sequence authentication The
consensus
sequence was identified as a rat cytochrome b sequence
using a BLAST program (no Leopoldamys neilli cytochrome b sequence was available in databanks such as
EMBL or GenBank before this study). This sequence is a
genuine holotype sequence for the following reasons: (i)
Rattini samples were never introduced in the ancient
DNA facilities before the analysis of this specimen was
performed; (ii) all the 16 clones analysed were identified
as rat; (iii) the errors induced by DNA damage are perfectly consistent with the pattern generally observed for
ancient DNA sequences (strong bias toward type 2 transitions caused by deamination of cytosine [62,63]); (iv) for
each amplification, all three PCR blanks remained negative [58]; (v) independent PCRs were performed and furnished the same conclusions. All in all, these points
satisfy criteria of authentication for the ancient DNA
work [59].
Assignment of the holotype sequence to a cluster The
genuine holotype sequence was deposited in GenBank
under the accession number HM235947. It was assigned
using the CAOS software to the monophyletic cluster
corresponding to the Leopoldamys species, L2, in our tree
(Figures 2 and 3). Consequently, this monophyletic cluster recognized as a putative species by the method of
Pons et al. [28] could be without ambiguity named as Leopoldamys neilli.

Discussion
1. Phylogenetic relationships within the Rattini tribe
1.1. Division-level relationships

Our phylogenetic analyses of Indochinese Rattini based
on the combination of cytb, COI and the first exon of the
IRBP genes is compatible with the revised taxonomy of
Rattini divisions proposed by Musser and Carleton [16].
The Maxomys division, the Dacnomys division (here consisting of Leopoldamys and Niviventer as sister taxa) and
the Rattus division (here including the genera Rattus,
Bandicota and Berylmys) are sustained with the highest
support values (Figure 2). These results are congruent
with the Murinae phylogeny obtained by Lecompte et al.
[17] based on the analysis of the combined cytb, IRBP and
GHR genes. In this latter analysis, the 3 divisions are well
supported and the Maxomys division is also the first to
diverge followed by the Dacnomys one and the Rattus
group sensu stricto of Verneau [64].

1.2. Relationships among the Rattus division: is the genus
Rattus paraphyletic?

In our analyses, the position of Bandicota still remains
uncertain. The monophyly of the genus Rattus is in reality weakly supported (0.82 for pp and 61/63 for Bp) and
SH-test failed to reject the hypothesis of a paraphyletic
Rattus genus (i.e. Bandicota is placed within Rattus).
Verneau and collaborators [64,37] attempted to determine the evolutionary relationships in Rattus sensu lato
using LINE-1 (L1) amplification events. In their study
[37], two LINE subfamilies were identified in the Bandicota and the other Rattus species except in Rattus fuscipes. Since L1 subfamily absence from a particular taxa
reflects an ancestral state rather than a derived state [64],
these findings excluded Rattus fuscipes from a Bandicota/Rattus clade and placed Bandicota inside the genus
Rattus leading to its paraphyly. Our study is in agreement
with the multi-locus phylogeny of Lecompte et al., [17]
which shows Bandicota and the genus Diplothrix diverging together prior to the Rattus clade. In the Lecompte's
study, the monophyly of the genus Rattus is highly supported (98 Bp, 1 pp) but, as in our study, no specimen of
the Rattus fuscipes species group was included. To draw
conclusions about paraphyly in Rattus genus, it would be
judicious to complete the taxa sampling among the genus
Rattus and to include representatives of each Rattus species group defined by Musser and Carleton [16] particularly representatives of the Rattus fuscipes species group.
1.3. Relationships within the genus Rattus

The genus Rattus, with a total of 66 species currently recognised [16] "is not only the single largest mammalian
genus of all, but also arguably among the most complex
and least understood" [65].
Within this genus, 7 species groups have been defined
by Musser and Carleton [16], of which 3 inhabit the Indochinese region and are relevant to this study (Rr, Re and
Rn in Figures 2 and 3). The Rattus rattus species group as
described by Musser and Carleton [16] comprises 21 species of which 5 may be found in Thailand, Cambodia and
Lao PDR. In our phylogenetic analysis, this cluster
appears unambiguously to be monophyletic (1.00 for pp;
93/97 for Bp) and was placed undoubtedly as the sister
group of the monotypic exulans species group (pp = 1.00;
Bp = 94/96). This association was also found in recent
molecular studies [25,17] but encompassing fewer representatives of the Rattus rattus species group. According
to Musser and Carleton [16], the R. norvegicus species
group includes 3 species (Rattus norvegicus, R. nitidus
and R. pyctoris) of which only 2 may occur in the Indochinese region (Rattus norvegicus and R. nitidus). This
group appears in our study as the sister taxa to the "R.
exulans species group/R. rattus species group" cluster as
found in [25] and [17].

Robins and colleagues [25] focusing on rats inhabiting
islands in Southeast Asia, included in their sampling
specimens from Australia (i.e. belonging to the Rattus
fuscipes species group as defined by [16]) and from New
Guinea and adjacent archipelagos (i.e. belonging to the
Rattus leucopus group). Based on the analysis of nearly 2
kb of mt DNA, they recovered 5 of the 7 groups proposed
by Musser and Carleton [16]. Our study, even if focusing
on a different region of South East Asia, is perfectly congruent with Robins' study, and both studies are compatible with the revised taxonomy of the Rattus genus
recently proposed by Musser and Carleton [16]. The sixth
group defined by the authors [16] corresponds to the
xanthurus species group encompassing species native to
Sulawesi and adjacent islands. According to preliminary
phylogenetic analyses of cytb sequences cited in [16], this
assemblage could be placed as the sister-group to the R.
leucopus and R. fuscipes groups. The last group defined
by Musser and Carleton [16] does not correspond to a
natural cluster but was formed for practical reasons since
it includes species whose phylogenetic affinities have to
be clarified; some may need to be excised from Rattus.
2. Toward a deep taxonomic revision of the Rattini tribe

At a specific level, we realized that phylogenetic relationships were difficult to discuss. Species misidentifications
are indeed plentiful and recurrent both in our sampling
(see Table 1) and in the literature. Mt sequences from
Robins et al. [25] or provided by O. Verneau and F. Catzeflis were included in our dataset but questions about the
reliability of the identification of vouchers were rapidly
raised. To cite a few examples, the Rattus tanezumi sample occurring in the tiomanicus cluster in [25] (see Figure
4) was proposed by the authors to represent a misidentification. Similarly, the R. rattus cf. moluccarius specimen in
[64] and [37] was, according to Musser and Carleton [16],
an example of R. nitidus whereas their specimen assigned
to Niviventer niviventer was probably improperly identified since N. niviventer has never been described in the
locality where the specimen was caught [64]. We
observed that the situation was worse regarding the Niviventer genus. When including sequences available in the
databanks (i.e. cytochrome b sequences from [66]),
numerous species appeared to be paraphyletic (data not
shown). These results are presumably the consequence of
species misidentifications and this explains why we
decided to exclude these sequences from our analyses. All
in all, these reports ([25,64] and this study) stressed the
necessity of a sound taxonomic revision of the Rattini
tribe. Consequently one must first determine valid species boundaries and then assign an appropriate name in
accordance with the rules of the International Code of the
Nomenclature.

2.1. How many rat species in the Indochinese area we
investigated?

According to Musser and Carleton [16], 9 genera corresponding to the following 27 species of Rattini may occur
in our sampling area (Figure 1): Hapalomys delacouri (see
Background for justification of its inclusion into the Rattini tribe), Sundamys muelleri, Chiromyscus chiropus, 3
Maxomys species (rajah, surifer, whiteheadi), 6 Niviventer
species (fulvescens, hinpoon, langbianis, tenaster, cremoriventer, confucianus), 3 Leopoldamys species (neilli,
edwardsi, sabanus), 2 Bandicota species (indica and
savilei), 2 Berylmys species (bowersi and berdmorei) and 8
Rattus species (andamanensis, argentiventer, exulans,
tanezumi, losea, tiomanicus, norvegicus, nitidus). According to our phylogeny (Figure 2), 23 lineages exist within
our sampling and 24 putative species were suggested by
the method of Pons et al. [28]. Confidence interval for the
estimated number of species ranged from 22 to 32 (i.e.
estimates falling within 2 log-likelihood units of the ML
solution). An inadequate population sampling is one of
the potential limitations of the branch length method as
identified by Pons et al. [28]. However, the GMYC model
was preferred over the null model of uniform branching
rates indicated that the intraspecific sampling effort is
satisfactory in our dataset (failure to reject the null model
over the GMYC model could be an incomplete sampling
per species; [28]). Moreover, among the 24 estimated species, 4 species (labelled R5, Be2b, N2 and N3 respectively
in Figure 3) contain a single individual. In accordance
with Pons et al, it seems that the GMYC method correctly
deals with the inclusion of some rare species represented
by only one single individual [28].
The estimated number of species fit well with the number of species described in the literature for this area,
although there are some exceptions, in particular within
the Berylmys and the Rattus genera. Our study suggests 3
putative species of Berylmys in our sampling whereas
only 2 are mentioned in the literature within the geographic area sampled (Berylmys bowersi and B. berdmorei) (see Table 4). This outcome was supported by all
the solutions included in the 95% confidence interval of
the estimate of the number of species (Figure 3). This
finding may be an artefact of the species delimitation
method which could have difficulty in dealing with high
level of population differentiation and strong phylogeographic patterns. As acknowledged by Pons et al., [28], a
limitation of this method is that populations with partial
gene flow risk being recognized as separate entities. A
marked phylogeographic structuring within Berylmys
bowersi could explain the distinction of Be2a and Be2b as
two putative species by the branch-length method. Be2b
specimen came from the Kanchanaburi locality (Table 1,
Figure 1), North to the Isthmus of Kra corresponding to
the limit of the peninsular Thailand whereas the speci-

Page 17 of 27

mens of the Be2b group came from the Northern Thailand (Loei and Nan provinces, Figure 1) and Northern
Lao PDR (Luang Prabang province, Figure 1). Populations
of Berylmys bowersi in peninsular Thailand were reported
to be geographically isolated and to differ in some ways
from other populations [67]. Our findings are congruent
with this report. Further investigations are needed to
determine if Be2a and Be2b are two phylogenetic lineages
of a same species exhibiting a strong phylogeographical
pattern or if they have two be considered as two closely
related but separate species.
In a similar way, five species belonging to the Rattus
rattus species group have been described in this area (i.e.
R. andamanensis, argentiventer, tanezumi, losea, and tiomanicus). Marshall [33] reported also the presence of R.
rattus in all provinces of Thailand and considered the
roof rat as the most abundant mammal in the country.
Interestingly, since 1998, no specimen among the 3,000
caught during our successive field surveys in rural or
urban areas of Thailand, Lao PDR and Cambodia could
be identified as a representative of R. rattus, according to
morphological, cytological and molecular evidences. Our
findings offer no support for the presence of R. rattus in
the area and are in conflict with previous claims of R. rattus in the Indochinese region [33]. However, this inconsistancy is probably due to a difference in the usage of
"Rattus rattus" in place of "Rattus tanezumi" rather than a
problem of identification or occurrence.
Finally, our analysis corroborates the presence of an
additional Rattus species (labelled R3 in Figure 3) already
identified as the diardii clade in the mitochondrial phylogeny of Robins et al. [25]. R3 could be a cryptic species.
This statement yet needs further investigation using
independent data (morphology, nuclear genes). Then, if
this hypothesis proved to be correct, the R3 species
would have to be carefully named (R. diardii is indeed
considered at present as a synonym of R. tanezumi [16]).
In agreement with our result, Aplin in his preliminary
study of the cytb [65] observed that the taxonomy of the
Rattus rattus species group might be rather thornier than
suggested by previous studies mostly based on karyotypic
or electrophoretic evidences. Indeed, his ongoing study
reports two distinct phylogenetic clades in the Asian
region. The first one would correspond to an endemic
Southeast Asian taxon (recorded in Vietnam, Cambodia
and Southern Laos) and might correspond to our R3
according to geographical evidence. Our study and Robins' work reveal that the distribution of this Southeast
group spreads far into the South as it occurs in Thailand
and in Sri Lanka and also in Malaysia, in Indonesia and
Northern Sulawesi (Figures 4 and 5). The second clade
proposed by Aplin [65] would be a northern and South
Asian taxon (found in Japan, Hong Kong, northern Vietnam, northern Laos, and Bangladesh) and might corre-

spond to R2 (here also found in Thailand and Indonesia,
Figure 4, Table 3/see also Table 4 for species name).
Indeed when including Robins' sequences, R2 includes
specimens from Japan and Hong Kong (Figures 4 and 5).
As mentioned by Aplin [65], the latter group (R2) is more
closely related to Rattus rattus rather than the former
group (R3). In our trees (Figures 2 and 4), R2 is clearly
placed as the sister taxa of R. rattus (R1). Our study reinforces Aplin's assumption [65] that the two Asian clades
(i.e. R2 and R3) are sympatric in some part of their distribution by increasing greatly the area where the two taxa
co-occur in continental Southeast Asia. Both are found in
Northern and Central Thailand (Phrae, Nakhon Pathom
and Ratchaburi provinces; this study). Since some specimens of both taxa were trapped in exactly the same location and time, at least in Phrae, they probably also share
similar habitats and are likely syntopic.
2.2. How to give a name?

By integrating phylogenetic, morphological and geographical evidence, we proposed to attribute the names
summarized in Table 4 to the 24 species highlighted

herein. Our propositions are not definitive but are revisable ones. Indeed, once species boundaries are delimitated, assigning the appropriate name to each species is
not an easy task particularly for the Rattini species whose
taxonomy is complicated by a large number of synonym
names. Even for a rodent specialist, morphological characters are sometimes misleading (see aforementioned
misidentification examples) and intraspecific morphological polymorphism makes the problem more difficult. To
alleviate this last difficulty, morphological studies have to
consider a large number of specimens, a process that may
be difficult and time-consuming to perform.
These inconveniences highlighted the great interest in
obtaining molecular data from a holotype. Indeed, the
holotype is by definition the element to which the name
of a taxon is permanently attached. Consequently, including holotype specimens in molecular phylogenies would
be very suitable to name each cluster recognized as a
valid species providing that a rigorous and sound taxonomy is already set up. Indeed, holotype specimens may
correspond to problematic taxa (e.g. problems of synon-

R1

Rattus rattus

R1 specimens identified in [36] cluster
unambiguously with R. rattus specimens
identified by Robins et al. [25] (see Figure 4). It
is worth noting that, during this study, this
species was never sampled in the fields in
Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.

R2

Rattus tanezumi

R2 specimens cluster unambiguously with R.
tanezumi specimens identified in [25] (see
Figure 4).

Medium-sized rat; fur light brown to
reddish brown above, white below; dark
tail, equal or longer than head and body
length; caught in a large range of habitats,
from houses, gardens, crops and rice fields
to the edge of secondary forests.

R3

Rattus sp.(to be
named)

R3 includes specimens identified as Rattus
diardii in the study of Robins et al., [25] and rats
referred to Malaysian house rat (i.e. Rattus
diardii) by local populations in Indonesia
(Andru, J., pers. comm.). Today, Rattus diardii
has been placed as a synonym of Rattus
tanezumi according to morphological criteria.

Urban rat or rat living near human
habitations. Misidentified by us as Rattus
tanezumi, R argentiventer and R.
andamanensis in the Rattus rattus species
group.

R4

Rattus losea or
"losea-like"

R5

Rattus
tiomanicus

R5 specimens cluster unambiguously with
R. tiomanicus specimens identified in [25] (see
Figure 4).

Medium-sized rat; fur brown above, white
below; dark tail, slightly longer than head
and body length; arboreal; caught in palm
plantations. Morphologically very similar
to Rattus tanezumi but with shorter guard
hairs.

R6

Rattus
argentiventer

R6 sequences cluster unambiguously with
R. argentiventer sequences provided by O.
Verneau and F. Catzeflis (see Figure 4)/
identification of Verneau's specimen
confirmed by G. Musser [64].

Medium-sized rat; fur yellowish brown
above, grey-white below, with developed
guard hair on the back, distinct orange
fringe of fur just forward of the ear; dark
tail, shorter than head and body length;
caught in rice fields and plantations.

Medium-sized rat; shaggy fur brownish
grey above, white to geyish below; dark
tail, shorter than head and body length;
caught mostly in rice fields and sometimes
in dry agricultural fields. According to
Aplin [35] two distinct forms of R. losea
may exist. True R. losea (described from
Taiwan) would be distributed from
Southern China to central Vietnam. The
second form "losea-like" would inhabit the
Mekong Delta region from Southern
Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, to the North
of Vientiane Province in Laos. Since our
analyses did not include samples from the
two putative groups, it was not possible to
determine if they are genetically distinct.
Until this taxonomic issue is resolved, we
prefer to name R4 "losea-like".

R7 sequences cluster unambiguously with
R. sikkimensis sequences provided by O.
Verneau and F. Catzeflis (see Figure 4).

Medium-sized rat; fur orange brown

evergreen forests.

R8

Rattus exulans

R8 specimens cluster unambiguously with
R. exulans specimens identified in [25] (see
Figure 4).

Small-sized rat; fur grey-brown above, pale
grey below; dark tail, longer than head and
body length; domestic species found in
houses.

R9

Rattus
norvegicus

R9 specimens cluster unambiguously with
R. norvegicus specimens identified in [25] (see
Figure 4).

Large-sized rat; fur dark-grey above, pale
grey below; tail shorter than head and
body length, dark above and paler
beneath but not clearly separated; occurs
in major ports and neighbouring cities.

R10

Rattus nitidus

Sister relationship with Rattus norvegicus
evidenced by molecular data (see Figure 2) .

Medium-size rat with a soft woolly fur,
dorsally brown and grey-based cream on
belly. Pearly white feet. A nitidus/
norvegicus sistership was proposed by
morphologists. According to Musser and
Carleton [11], both have "dense and soft
fur, six pairs of teats, and an upper M1 in
which the anterolabial cusp on the
anterior lamina is missing or undetectable
due to its coalesence with the adjacent
central cusp".

B1

Bandicota
indica

Only two Bandicota species have been
described in the Indochinese region. Usually,
B. indica specimens are unambiguously larger
than B. savilei. Adult B. savilei and juvenile or
immature B. indica may be confounded. A
molecular test based on PCR amplifications
with specific primers allowing discriminating
between the 2 species (Chaval et al., in prep.)
was used in such cases (data not shown).

Large-sized rat; fur dark above, grey
below; tail shorter than head and body;
aggressive and stocky; inhabits
agricultural fields. The ratio of pes length
to head+body length is used to
distinguish B.indica from B.savilei [74].

B2

Bandicota
savilei

Medium-sized rat; fur dark above, grey
below; tail shorter than head and body;
inhabits dry lands, grasslands, clearings in
forest.

Be1

Berylmys
berdmorei

Medium-sized rat; fur grey above, white
below; tail shorter than head and body;
inhabits secondary forests and fields close
to forests.

Be2a

Berylmys
bowersi

Large-sized rat; fur grey above, white
below; tail slightly longer than head and
body; inhabits secondary forests and fields
close to forests.

Be2b

Berylmys sp.

Berylmys mackensiei has been described in
the Indochinese region by Marshall [33].
However the skull of B. mackenziei he
studied was identified by Musser and
Newcomb [75] as B. bowersi. Populations
of Berylmys bowersi in peninsular Thailand
were reported to be geographically
isolated and to differ in some ways from
those elsewhere (here speculated as to be
Be2,a) [67]. Be2b specimen came from the
Kanchanaburi locality, North to the
isthmus of Kra and could consequently
belong to this former particular
population. Because of the lack of
additional information about this
specimen, no species name could be
convincingly assigned to Be2b.

L1

Leopoldamys
edwardsi

Large-sized rat; fur red-brown above,
white-cream below; very long tail, longer
than head and body; inhabits secondary
forests.

L2

Leopoldamys
neilli

L3

Leopoldamys
sabanus

Large-sized rat; fur red-brown above,
white-cream below; very long tail, longer
than head and body; inhabits secondary
forests. Caught in secondary forests. Often
misidentified as Leopoldamys edwardsi.
The two species of Leopoldamys sabanus
and Leopoldamys edwardsi are indeed
morphologically very similar. The species
name we proposed for L3 is based on
geographical evidences from Marshall
(1977). Based on his work, the only
Leopoldamys species that has been
described in Kanchanaburi province is
Leopoldamys sabanus. The L3 specimens
were caught in this province.

N1

Niviventer
fulvescens

Medium-sized rat; spiny fur red-brown
above, white-cream below; tail longer
than head and body, sharply bicoloured
from base to tip; absence of terminal
pencil and smallest length of bulla make
us exclude Niviventer confucianus as
species name.

Genuine sequence obtained from the
holotype specimen of L. neilli was assigned to
L2 without ambiguities.

Large-sized rat (but the smallest
Leopoldamys species); fur greyish -brown
above, white-cream below; tail longer
than head and body. Until now, the
species has been recorded from a few
locations in limestone areas of northern
and South western Thailand, North of the
peninsular region [76]. Our specimens
were also trapped on tower karst in
northern and northeastern Thailand
(Phrae and Loei provinces).

N2

Niviventer sp. 1

Marshall [67], Musser [77] and Corbet [34]
documented the occurrence of Niviventer
bukit in Kanchanaburi, where
representatives of N2 and N3 species were
caught. One of the two could be N. bukit.
However, bukit is today considered as
conspecific with Niviventer fulvescens [16].
Consequently, we prefer to refrain from
giving a species name to these 2 species.

N4

Niviventer
langbianis or
Chiromyscus
chiropus

M1

Maxomys sp.

Identified by us as Maxomys surifer in the
field. Could be assigned to Maxomys rajah
but this species has never been reported in
this area. This result could be to a bias of
the branching-length method that could
have some difficulties to deal with strong
phylogeographic pattern. The
phylogeography of Maxomys surifer was
investigated using mt DNA but focusing
on the large Sunda shelf area [78]. A
structuration between the North-eastern
Vietnam and the Southern Vietnam seems
to exist but this finding is based on only
four sampled (for which sequences are not
available in databanks). As a greater
sampling and more additional data are
needed to assess the phylogeographic
pattern of this species, we prefer to refrain
from giving a species name to this cluster.

M2

Maxomys
surifer.

Medium-sized rat; spiny fur red-brown
above, white-cream below; tail slightly
longer but nearly equal to head and body
length, sharply bicoloured with a white tip.
This is the only Maxomys species described
in this area

N4 is placed at the base of the Niviventer
group. It could thus belong to the genus
Niviventer or to a sister genus to Niviventer.
According to Musser and Carleton [16],
Chiromyscus is presumed to be one of the
closest phylogenetic relatives of Niviventer.
Based on morphological criteria, this
specimen could be a Chiromyscus chiropus
representative. However, Chiromyscus
chiropus is morphologically very closed to N.
langbianis. Thus, N4 could be one of these two
species. At the end of this work, we have just
received N. langbianis samples from the
AMCC. Our preliminary work based on
mitochondrial DNA suggests that N4 may be
N. langbianis rather than C. chiropus.

Identified in the field as Nu-deng because
of its reddish fur (in Lao, "red rat"). Further
considerations of pictures of one of the
two specimens included in this study show
that legs, feet and head are buffy orange
as described by Musser [77] regarding
Chiromyscus chiropus. However, the wide
dark brown rings around the eyes are not
visible and the tail is not bicoloured as
expected for Chiromyscus. Chiromyscus is
morphologically very close to Niviventer
langbianis [77] and easily confused with it.
Other criteria to discriminate between the
two species such as the presence of a nail
on each hallux instead of a claw for
Chiromyscus are not obvious on our
pictures. Morphological identification is
thus questionable. However, molecular
data are tipping the balance for N.
langbianis assignation.

The congruence between geographical, morphological and phylogenetic data allows us proposing species names. Waiting for a complete
taxonomic revision of the Rattini tribe, these propositions are not definitive but are revisable ones.

ymy not yet revealed), and the use of type specimens
could be misleading in such context. Including holotype
specimens in molecular phylogenies is however totally
infeasible for the two following reasons. Firstly, holotype
specimens are unique and are difficult to obtain for
genetic research purposes. Sampling authorisations are
very scarce and destructive sampling is generally not possible. To achieve our study, no more than 24 holotypes
would be damaged if our assumptions are correct. Faced
with the understandable reluctance of museum curators,
non-destructive extraction procedure [68] would be an
elegant suggestion. Secondly, ancient materials contain
tiny amounts of poorly preserved and highly fragmented
DNA. As required for this study, getting 3 kb corresponding to 3 different genes (including one nuclear one) for
more than 24 holotype specimens, and following the
ancient DNA guidelines would be too expensive and
much too time-consuming. To circumvent this problem it
is fortunately possible to target small DNA fragments as
barcodes. Our study proved that this strategy is a power-

ful one. Following all the ancient DNA requirements, we
succeeded in amplifying a genuine small cytb fragment
from the Leopoldamys neilli holotype. This barcode was
used to assign a name without ambiguity to one of the
clusters (i.e. L2) recognized as a valid species in our analyses. Even if more holotype specimens have to be investigated to achieve a steady revision of the Rattini tribe, our
work illustrates the huge opportunities ancient DNA
analysis may offer to taxonomists.

Conclusions
This study represents the first step of a long-term project
aiming at a deep taxonomic revision of the Rattini. Putative species delimitations have been determined here
without prior assumptions and we propose a suitable
methodology using molecular data from holotypes to
assign the right name to each delineated species. Ancient
DNA analysis of holotypes should be considered by taxonomists as a promising tool opening up new realms of
possibilities (e.g. testing synonymy of names of unclear

Pagès et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:184
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/184

taxonomies such as the synonymy of R. tanezumi and R.
diardii; see Table 4). Although DNA data alone are not a
panacea for species description and delimitation, we are
confident that future investigations combined with other
types of information will clarify the taxonomy of this confusing group. Indeed, integrative approaches merging
independent data such as morphology, karyology, mitochondrial and nuclear markers are the only means to
understand the diversification among, and interactions
between, evolutionary lineages. Our molecular study
revealed that at least 7 putative different species, including a cryptic one (R3), could exist among the Rattus rattus species group (among which six were sampled within
the area we investigated). As each of these species is
expected to have specific ecological traits and to carry its
own set of diseases, the recognition of cryptic species
within Rattini could have serious implications for human
health in Southeast Asia. However, this result has to be
carefully considered. Indeed, it is worth noticing that the
terminal nodes of our multilocus phylogeny are mostly
supported by mitochondrial data (cytb and COI genes)
while the deepest nodes are sustained by nuclear data
(IRPB). Other kinds of markers have thus to be checked
for congruence. Such clarifications for the Rattini tribe
are today urgently required to achieve meaningful epidemiological research in South East Asia.

Additional file 1 Rat 85 pb cytb alignment. The whole cytb sequences
obtained from the 122 specimens selected in this study were reduced to
the 85 bp DNA marker already used to discriminate closely related species
from degraded DNA [56,57]. Small sequences were sorted following the
results of the DNA-based species delimitation method. Dots indicate identical positions as those of the reference sequence of Rattus rattus R12. Sites
allowing discrimination between species are those shared by all the specimens of a same entitie but different for all the specimens of another one.
Each rat species could be distinguished from each other based on this fragment except the two Berylmys species Be2a and Be2b (but see discussion).
We tried to maximize the geographic diversity of the specimens, however,
our sampling was achieved without prior expectation and some entities
determined by the DNA-based species delimitation method encompass
few specimens coming from the same locality (e.g. R5, R6, R7, Be2b, L3, etc.).
In this case, intra-polymorphism is not taken into account and substitutions
allowing discriminatation between species are thus overestimated. However, closely related rat species (such as R1 and R2 or R3 and R4, see phylogeny in Figure 2) could be easily discriminated. We thus considered that this
fragment is reliable for an adequate discrimination for rat species.
