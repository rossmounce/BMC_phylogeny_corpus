Abstract
Background: The marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii (Polychaeta, Nereididae) has been
recognized as a slow-evolving lophotrochozoan that attracts increasing attention as a valuable
model for evolutionary and developmental research. Here, we analyzed its immune-related
transcriptome. For targeted identification of immune-induced genes we injected bacterial
lipopolysaccharide, a commonly used elicitor of innate immune responses, and applied the
suppression subtractive hybridization technique that selectively amplifies cDNAs of differentially
expressed genes.
Results: Sequence analysis of 288 cDNAs revealed induced expression of numerous genes whose
potential homologues from other animals mediate recognition of infection (e.g. complement
receptor CD35), signaling (e.g. myc and SOCS), or act as effector molecules like ferritins and the
bactericidal permeability-increasing protein. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses implicate that
immune-related genes identified in P. dumerilii are more related to counterparts from
Deuterostomia than are those from Ecdysozoa, similarly as recently described for opsin and intronrich genes.
Conclusion: Obtained results may allow for a better understanding of Platynereis immunity and
support the view that P. dumerilii represents a suitable model for analyzing immune responses of
Lophotrochozoa.

Background
Comparative immunology has become an integrative discipline in zoology and has gained wide acceptance in biological sciences [1]. Research on molecular aspects of
innate immunity was mainly performed on Ecdysozoa
(Drosophila [2] and Caenorhabditis [3]) or Deuterostomia
(fish and murine models), whereas information about
immune responses from Lophotrochozoa is rather fragmentary and needs further elucidation. Identification of
immune-related genes from lophotrochozoan species was

performed by differential display RT-PCR in the leech
Theromyzon tessulatum (Annelida, Hirudinea) [4] and by
subtractive suppression hybridization, the same method
as used in this study, in the oysters Crassostrea virginica and
C. gigas (Mollusca, Bivalvia) [5] and the snail Biomphalaria
glabrata (Mollusca, Gastropoda) [6,7]. Here, we used the
marine polychaete Platynereis dumerilii for targeted screening of the immune-related genes because this annelid has
been emerged as an ideal model organism for evolutionary analyses of a slow-evolving Bilateria [8,9].

Since genomic data become available from an increasing
number of invertebrates such as the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [10], comparative immunology
attracted renewed attention. But screening for immunerelated genes in genomic or EST databases has one major
disadvantage. It allows only the identification of genes
that share sequence similarities with known immunerelated proteins from other organisms. Here, we used an
experimental approach for targeted screening of immunerelated genes in P. dumerlii that allows selective amplification of genes with enhanced expression rates in response
to septic injury. For this purpose, we injected crude bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent and widely used
elicitor of innate immune responses, into the coelom of
adult Platynereis, isolated their RNA 8 hours post challenge, and analyzed immune-related transcripts by a subtractive suppression hybridization approach. This PCRbased method selectively amplifies cDNAs of differentially expressed genes and simultaneously suppresses
amplification of common cDNAs. This technique has
been proven as a suitable tool for identification of
immune-related genes in a variety of animals including
the apterygote insect Thermobia domestica [11], the mosquito Anopheles gambiae [12], the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans [13], the lepidopterans Galleria mellonella and
Manduca sexta [14,15], the oysters C. virginica and C. gigas
[5], the snail B. glabrata [6,7], and the zebrafish Danio rerio
[16]. Here, we describe the identification of immunerelated genes from P. dumerlii which may provide novel
insights into polychaete innate immunity.

Results and Discussion
Subtracted cDNA library of immune challenged P.
dumerilii
A subtracted cDNA library enriched in immune-inducible
genes was constructed using purified RNA from eight
adult P. dumerilii injected with bacterial LPS and eight
untreated animals. To induce strong and broad immune
responses we injected a commercially available purified
LPS preparation that is known to contain impurities like
nucleic acids, proteins, and peptidoglycans and that is
commonly used as elicitor in vertebrate and invertebrate
research. In order to confirm that the subtraction process
has been performed efficiently, we analyzed the abundance of transcripts of the house-keeping genes 18 S rRNA
and α-tubulin and for two genes, the bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and suppressor of cytokine
signaling (SOCS). The latter ones were found to be
induced in response to immune challenge in Platynereis.
Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that transcripts of 18 S rRNA and α-tubulin were reduced 2 to 3
fold, whereas transcripts of BPI and SOCS were enriched
for 1.3 and 5.1 fold, respectively (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with values from the protocols of the manufacturer
and indicates successful subtraction of the cDNA library.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/18

A total of 288 clones from this library were randomly
picked and subjected to colony PCR. Plasmids of 140 colonies that were positively screened in blot hybridization
indicating immune-induced expression of corresponding
genes were isolated and sequenced. Obtained sequences
were deposited at EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute, compared to databases of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information using BLASTX program, and
summarized in table 1. InterProScan at the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute was used for an integrated
search in PROSITE, Pfam, and PRINTS databases to predict conserved motifs, signal sequences, and transmembrane regions.
Here, we describe the identification of P. dumerilii proteins that are potentially involved in recognition of infection, immune-related signaling, and effector mechanisms
based on sequence similarities with known proteins from
other organisms.
Recognition of infection
The complement system is an important component of
innate immunity in vertebrates [17]. Because no complement genes were found in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis it
has previously been suggested that the complement system is solely established in deuterostomes [18]. However,
recently C3 was identified in the horseshoe crab (Arthropoda) and in corals (Cnidaria) implicating a much more
ancient origin [18]. In this study we identified Platynereis
transcripts encoding a protein that shares sequence similarities with human complement receptor type 1 (C3b/
C4b receptor, CD35 antigen) (Fig. 2). In addition, we
found cDNAs encoding a protein sharing highest
sequence similarities with mouse C-C chemokine receptor
type 1 (Macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha receptor, CD191 antigen) which is a G-protein coupled receptor for C-C type chemokines [19]. However, the
similarities of obtained sequences to the potential counterparts are to short and to prevalent in similar receptors
to construct a useful phylogenetic analysis; therefore, the
given assignments should be taken with care.
Signaling
The engagement of immune-related signaling pathways
result in the massive production of cytokines and effector
molecules that are necessary for pathogen elimination but
that can also cause self-damage. Consequently, the regulation of exuberant immune responses is of great importance for the organism. In agreement, we found numerous
genes in P. dumerilii that encode homologues known as
negative regulators of immune responses. We identified
the induced expression of a protein with highest sequence
similarity to SOCS. SOCS proteins are negative feedback
loop regulators of the evolutionary well-conserved JAK/
STAT (Janus Kinase/Signal Transduction and Activator of

sequence similarities to alpha-actinin-3 and alphaactinin-associated proteins, respectively. Arrestins were
originally characterized as structural adaptor proteins that
modulate the desensitization and trafficking of sevenmembrane-spanning G protein coupled receptors and
that have also been implicated in endocytosis of receptors
and in crosstalk with other signaling pathways [23].
Alpha-actinin is a F-actin cross-linking protein that
anchors actin to a variety of intracellular structures and is
present in focal adhesion complexes [24]. Through these
complexes integrins are able to transduce bi-directional
signals between the extracellular matrix and intracellular
signaling pathways essentially involved in cell shape
change and motility of e.g. immune cells.

CD35 from Platynereis (AM697681), was aligned with the

NP_000642). Red color indicates 80% consensus and blue
color 50% consensus.

Interestingly, we further determined the induced expression of a protein with sequence similarities to the protooncogene myc (Fig. 3A) which is an important regulator
of apoptosis in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
that the Platynereis myc exhibits a higher relation to the
human c-myc than to other analyzed myc homologues
(Fig. 3B). The determined c-myc expression in activated
human macrophages [25] reflects the need of a finely
tuned balance between cell proliferation, cell division
arrest, and apoptosis in the vertebrate immune cells [26].
Consistently with the importance of apoptosis regulation,
we found immune-induction of potential homologues of
caspase-2 and of the adenine nucleotide (ADP/ATP) translocator: (i) Caspase-2 is a member of a family of evolutionarily conserved cysteinyl proteases that mediate both
apoptosis and inflammation through aspartate-specific
cleavage of cellular substrates [27,28]; (ii) (ADP/ATP)
translocator is an element of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This protein complex induces a sudden increase in permeability of the mitochondrial
membrane resulting in cytochrome C release which is a
key element in cell death [29].
Effector molecules
We identified several transcripts of factors essentially
involved in cell proliferation and in protein biosynthesis
including the alpha-DNA polymerase, ribonucleoside
reductase and several ribosomal proteins. This is plausible
since production of effector molecules depends on the
activation of cellular proliferation and translation and is
commonly found in comparative analysis of innate
immune responses [4-7,11,12,15].

In addition, the immune-induced expression of following
effector molecules were documented in P. dumerilii: (I) αamylases are able to hydrolyze 1,4-alpha-D-glucosidic
linkages in oligo- and polysaccharides and belong to a
multigene family [30]. Confirming their potential antimicrobial activity human salivary α-amylase has been
reported as an effective inhibitor of Neisseria gonorrhoeae

in vitro [31]. (II) One deduced protein exhibits sequence
similarities to the serine protease inhibitors of the migratory locust Locusta migratoria [32]. Many serine proteinase
inhibitors have evolved in vertebrates and invertebrates to
regulate vital serine proteinase cascades including melanisation [33,34], hemostasis, or complement system
[35,36]. (III) We identified one protein sharing sequence
similarities to a family of immune-induced proteins from
insects with not yet elucidated function [15,37]. These
proteins contain a reeler domain that is also present in
human reelin and stromal cell derived factor receptor 2
homologue. (IV) Ferritin serves as an evolutionarily conserved molecule for the iron-withholding strategy in
innate immunity [38] and is strongly induced after
immune-challenge in vertebrates and invertebrates
[39,40]. Accordingly, we identified transcripts encoding
two related ferritin subunits from Platynereis. Alignment
and phylogenetic analysis of the ferritin isoforms revealed
that P. dumerilii ferritin 1 groups near to known ferritins
from the sponge Suberites domuncula and from the sea
urchin S. purpuratus whereas the second isoform groups
near to the ferritins from Hydra and Drosophila (Fig. 4).
The obtained phylogenetic tree needs careful interpretation, but implicates at least that the identified P. dumerillii
ferritins represent orthologous genes that arose during
early animal evolution whereas ferritins from Caenorhabditis, Drosophila and human are obviously encoded by paralogous genes, and ferritin gene duplications occurred
independently in different lineage bifurcations. Interestingly, Drosophila ferritins are secreted proteins [38] that
exhibit highest deviation in sequence when compared
with other analyzed ferritins. In contrast, vertebrate ferritins are localized in the cytoplasm and in mitochondria
whereas the plant ferritin is localized in chloroplasts. (V)
We found a protein sharing highest sequence similarities
with bactericidal permeability-increasing proteins (BPI)
from other organisms (Fig. 5). BPI has been recognized to
play an important role in innate immunity against Gramnegative bacteria by direct microbicidal and by endotoxinneutralizing action [41,42]. In humans, several isoforms
of BPI are present and form a protein family to which
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), cholesteryl
ester transfer protein (CETP), and phospholipid transfer
protein (PLTP) also belong [43]. A phylogentic analysis of
the Platynereis BPI sequence with counterparts from other
animals determined highest similarity to BPI from C. elegans. (VI) Several identified transcripts encode hypothetical proteins with no significant blastX match, but two of
them exhibit features of antimicrobial peptides [44]. For
example, a cationic and a hydrophobic peptide with predicted α-helical structures were identified. The latter has
cysteine residues that may form disulfide bridges (Fig. 6).

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/18

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses
In order to precisely quantify gene expression of selected
genes, we used real-time RT-PCR and total RNA from LPSinjected and untreated animals (Fig. 7). In Platynereis, we
found that the transcriptional rates of myc were induced
about 1.6 fold, of SOCS about 8 fold, and of BPI over 16
fold in response to immune challenge. In contrast, the
expression of the house-keeping gene 18 S rRNA was not
influenced by the treatment.

Conclusion
In order to elucidate immune responses from a lophotrochozoan model organism that has been recognized as a
slow-evolving Bilateria, we analyzed the immune-related
transcriptome of the marine annelid P. dumerilii. Using
the suppression subtractive hybridization method we
identified 35 genes encoding proteins potentially
involved in Platynereis immunity. Comparison with the
EST database of P. dumerilii [45] revealed that 70% of the
clusters represent novel genes, although 21,762 EST
clones with an average length of 1,277 base pairs were
available. This confirms the suitability of the used method
and increases the number of identified genes from this
polychaete.
The immune-induced expression of myc, SOCS, and BPI
was confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses.
In addition, phylogenetic analyses implicate that Platynereis immunity-related genes are more related to counterparts from Deuterostomia than are those from Ecdysozoa
(e.g. Drosophila and Caenorhabditis). Furthermore, in the
case of BPI no protein with sequence similarities is present
in the fully sequenced genome from D. melanogaster,
whereas proteins from humans, sea urchin, and
Caenorhabditis exhibit significant sequence similarities to
the identified homologue from Platynereis. Taken
together, these findings are in line with recent reports that
validate that P. dumerilii and human genes are evolutionarily more primary in structure and sequence than are
those of fast-evolving animals where these initially complex genes have been secondarily simplified in some cases
[8,9]. In conclusion, our results regarding the immuneinduced genes from Platynereis will be a valuable resource
for subsequent polychaete specific immune studies in particular and comparative lophotrochozoan/bilaterian
immune studies in general.

GACACTATAG-3' (purchased from Thermo electron,
Waltham, MA, USA) using a Biometra PCR cycler and the
Red Taq PCR system (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany).
Used PCR conditions were: denaturation at 95°C for 3
min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15
s, annealing at 43°C for 15 s, and extension at 72°C for
60 s. A final 7-min 72°C step was added to allow complete extension of the products. 1 µl of resulting PCR
products were identically spotted onto two sheets of positively charged nylon membranes (Roche, Lewes, United
Kingdom). Membranes were dried and UV cross-linked
using a BioRad UV cross-linker (BioRad, München, Germany), according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Digoxigenin labeled probes for hybridization were generated using secondary PCR products of subtracted and
non-subtracted cDNAs and the Dig-High Prime Labelling
kit (Roche, Lewes, United Kingdom). Hybridization,
washing, and detection of digoxigenin labeled DNA was
performed in accordance to the user guide instructions of
the Dig Easy Hyb Granules, Dig-Wash and Block Buffer
Set, Anti-Digoxigenin-AP and NBT/BCIP ready-to-use tablets (Roche, Lewes, United Kingdom).
Sequencing and computer analysis of cDNA sequence data
Plasmid isolation of 140 positively screened colonies was
performed with the Fast MiniPrep kit (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and purified plasmids were custom
sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South-Korea).
Sequences were used to identify similar sequences of
SWISS-PROT protein sequence database (available at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information) using
BLASTX program (BLASTX 2.2.13) [47]. InterProScan [48]
was used for an integrated search in PROSITE, Pfam, and
PRINTS databases at EMBL-European Bioinformatics
Institute and to predict signal sequences and transmembrane regions.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of transcriptional levels of selected Platynereis genes in response
to immune challenge. The mRNA levels of selected genes
in immune challenged animals (black bars) were determined
and are shown relative to their expression levels in untreated
animals (white bars). The transcription rates of myc, SOCS,
and BPI genes were found to be increased over 1.6, 8, and 16
fold, respectively, in response to LPS injection. In contrast,
the amount of 18 S rRNA transcripts were not significantly
influenced. Results represent mean values of three independent determinations ± S.D.

Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses
Sequence alignments were computed using the blosum62
algorithm [49,50]. For phylogenetic reconstruction, we
used the software package MrBayes 3.1.2 [51], which combines Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo
convergence acceleration techniques known as Metropolis coupling. The best fixed-rate model of amino acid evolution was determined by model jumping among nine
possible models. The model with the overall highest posterior probability was Jones model [52] for the myc protein after 5 × 106 generations and blosum62 model [53]
for BPI after 106 generations and also for ferritins after 106
generations. We used convergence diagnostic (i.e., the
standard deviation of split frequencies) to determine
whether the run length is sufficient. The average standard
deviation of split frequencies was 0.0021 for BPI, 0.0049
for the ferritins, and 0.00024 for the myc, respectively.
This indicated that the two chains that were run converged
on similar results in all cases. The 50% majority rule tree
presented here was constructed from all sampled trees
with the first 25% of all trees ignored as burn in. Trees
were visualized with TREEVIEW 1.6.6 [54]. Posterior
probabilities plotted at the nodes can be interpreted as the
probability that the tree or clade is correct [55].

Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative PCR was performed with the real-time PCR
system Mx3000P (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, USA)
using the FullVelocity SYBR® Green QRT-PCR Master Mix
(Stratagene), according to the protocols of the manufacturer. In order to confirm the subtraction efficiency of
constructed cDNA library 1 ng of unsubtracted and subtracted cDNA, respectively, was used to amplify 18S rRNA,
α-tubulin, BPI, and SOCS. Used primers were: 18S rRNAforward: 5'-ATGGTTGCAAAGCTGAAACT-3', 18 S rRNAreverse: 5'-TCCCGTGTTGAGTCAAATTA-3', the universal
primers α-tubulin-forward: 5'-GCCAACCAGATGGTCAA3' and α-tubulin-reverse: 5'-GCTTGGTCTTGATGGTG-3',
