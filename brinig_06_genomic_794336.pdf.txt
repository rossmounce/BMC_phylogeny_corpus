Genomic features of Bordetella and ovine <it>Bordetella parapertussis </it>strains reveals differences distinguishing the host-restricted

Conclusion: Several factors may play a role in determining host range of B. parapertussis. Humanand ovine-associated strains have differences in content and sequence of genes encoding proteins
that mediate host-pathogen contact, such as lipopolysaccharide and fimbriae, as well as variation in
regulation of toxins, type III secretion genes, and other virulence-associated genes.

Bordetella pertussis was isolated from whooping cough
patients in 1906, and the pathogenesis of this disease has
been the subject of extensive study. In the 1930s Eldering and

Results: We found 40 previously unknown genomic regions in an ovine strain of B. parapertussis
using subtractive hybridization, including unique lipopolysaccharide genes. A microarray survey of
the gene contents of 71 human and ovine strains revealed further differences, with 47 regions of
difference distinguishing the host-restricted subgroups. In addition, sheep and human strains
displayed distinct whole-genome transcript abundance profiles. We developed an animal model in
which sheep were inoculated with a sheep strain, human strain, or mixture of the two. We found
that the ovine strain persisted in the nasal cavity for 12 to 14 days, while the human strain colonized
at lower levels and was no longer detected by 7 days post-inoculation. The ovine strain induced
less granulocyte infiltration of the nasal mucosa.

refereed research

Background: The respiratory pathogen Bordetella parapertussis is a valuable model in which to
study the complex phenotype of host specificity because of its unique two-species host range. One
subset of strains, including the sequenced representative, causes whooping cough in humans, while
other strains infect only sheep. The disease process in sheep is not well understood, nor are the
genetic and transcriptional differences that might provide the basis for host specificity among ovine
and human strains.

Genomic features of Bordetella parapertussis clades with distinct
host species specificity

R81.2 Genome Biology 2006,

Volume 7, Issue 9, Article R81

Brinig et al.

Kedrick noticed different colony morphology of some strains,
which they used as the basis for proposing a new species, B.
parapertussis [2]. Later estimates of the percentage of Bordetella-associated cases of cough caused by B. parapertussis
range from about 5% to 30% [3-6], depending on case definition and vaccination coverage. This species was considered an
obligate human pathogen until 1987, when B. parapertussislike organisms were found in normal and pneumonic lamb
lungs [7,8]. B. parapertussis strains from humans appear to
be genetically distinct from ovine strains, and while human
strains are highly clonal, ovine strains appear more heterogeneous by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [9], insertion element typing [10], and PCR-based random amplified
polymorphic DNA profiles [11]. This species has not been isolated from any other source and is now thought to be composed of two subgroups, one of which infects only humans
and the other of which infects only sheep.
The unique host specificity of B. parapertussis contrasts with
both the obligate human pathogen lifestyle of B. pertussis as
well as the broad mammalian host range of the third member
of this close family of respiratory pathogens, B. bronchiseptica. Despite considerable genetic similarity among the three
species (or subspecies, as some have proposed), together they
illustrate a spectrum of host restriction, and may provide
insights into the evolution and maintenance of this important
phenotype. B. parapertussis affords one of the least-confounded models of host specificity in the bacterial world,
because its two subgroups are found in only two hosts, and
are known to be very closely related.
While one human-associated strain of B. parapertussis has
been sequenced completely [12], much less is known about
ovine strains, so we undertook a comprehensive investigation
of a large collection of such strains, utilizing subtractive
hybridization, microarray-based comparative genomic
hybridization, and transcript abundance profiling. In addition, we developed an experimental sheep infection model to
explore the colonization patterns and resulting pathology
caused by an ovine strain of B. parapertussis, compared to a
human strain. We found that ovine strains contain a large
amount of genetic material not found in human strains,
including a unique lipopolysaccharide (LPS) locus and an
additional gene encoding a fimbrial subunit, and that the two
groups of strains have many differences with respect to
genome content and transcript abundance profile. Of particular interest were differences in transcript abundances for
several virulence-associated genes and operons, including
tracheal colonization factor, dermonecrotic toxin, adenylate
cyclase, and the bsc type III secretion system. Inoculation of
sheep with either the natural ovine pathogen or a human
strain revealed that the ovine strain elicited a less intense
granulocyte infiltrate and colonized the nasal turbinate more
efficiently and for a longer period of time.

Results and discussion
Detection of novel sequences and a large island of
foreign DNA in ovine B. parapertussis
Nearly all previously available genomic information about B.
parapertussis has been based on data from the sequenced
human strain. In order to discover as yet unrecognized genes
and sequences that might be unique to ovine strains, we
searched for novel sequences in an ovine strain of B. parapertussis (Bpp5) using suppression subtractive hybridization
against a pool of the three sequenced Bordetella genomes
(including the sequenced human strain of B. parapertussis).
Of the 40 contigs discovered in Bpp5 (GenBank:DQ518927DQ518966), four (comprising 26 of the 100 fragments originally sequenced) had closest BLASTn hits (Additional data
file 1) to genes from the anaerobic bacterium Desulfovibrio
vulgaris (DVU2019, 2022, 2025, and 2026). To explore the
B. parapertussis chromosomal region carrying these
sequences, we constructed a fosmid library from Bpp5 DNA
and probed it for the D. vulgaris-like sequences. Complete
sequencing of a 34 kb fosmid insert (from pBpp5fos495) that
hybridized to these probes revealed a large region of foreign
DNA immediately downstream of the locus encoding the glycine tRNA (data not shown; GenBank:DQ515909). The foreign DNA shared homology to sequences from several
unrelated species, suggesting the presence of an island of
mobile horizontally transferred DNA. Partial sequencing of
an overlapping fosmid insert (from pBpp5fos353) indicated
that this island extended for at least 50 kb in the Bpp5
genome (see Additional data file 2 for a schematic of this
region). This discovery is striking given the extremely low
rates of gene acquisition in other Bordetella species [12,13],
and may indicate that ovine B. parapertussis strains have
access to a source of new genetic material to offset the ongoing genome degradation that marks the process of host specificity in this genus.
We designed microarray elements for the 40 novel contigs
obtained from Bpp5 by subtractive hybridization (see Additional data file 1 for sequences) and added them to our Bordetella microarray to screen other human and ovine strains for
these sequences. Of these, 38 array elements yielded data
passing the quality filters, and only one of these sequences
was detected in any of the 28 human strains. Sixteen array
elements were variably detected among the forty-three ovine
B. parapertussis strains, while the rest were detected in all
ovine strains. All the new array elements were detected in
Bpp5, from which the novel sequences were originally identified, as well as in two other strains from sheep in New Zealand
(Bpp3 and Bpp4), all three of which cluster tightly based on
these data and their total gene contents (see Additional data
file 3 for a maximum parsimony tree of all strains).
Among the 40 ovine strain-specific contigs were 5 LPS genes
that differed from all of the previously sequenced Bordetella
LPS genes. Microarray elements for these genes were
detected in all 43 ovine strains. Complete sequencing of a

There were a total of 57 regions of difference (RDs) among the
71 B. parapertussis strains, which consisted of 654 array elements (11.7% of the superset of array elements detected in any
strain). An additional 52 array elements were designated 'single gene variants', as they were not part of a block of contiguous variable genes. Three of the RDs (RDs 47, 55, and 57)
contained phage genes that had variable hybridization

refereed research

A maximum parsimony analysis of the data from CGH of 28
human B. parapertussis strains and 43 ovine strains revealed
a complete separation between human and ovine strains, and
two distinct subgroups within the ovine strains (Figure 1 and
maximum parsimony tree in Additional data file 3). In addition, three B. bronchiseptica strains representing the major
clades identified previously by CGH-based phylogenetic analysis [13] were included in the maximum parsimony analysis.
In agreement with our earlier CGH-based phylogeny [13], the
two host-restricted groups of B. parapertussis appear to be
sister clades descended from an unidentified common ancestor of unknown host range. These results differ from the evolutionary relationships deduced using data from multilocus
enzyme electrophoresis [17] or multilocus sequence typing
[14], which indicated that human and ovine strains of B. parapertussis evolved independently from separate B. bronchiseptica-like ancestors. The CGH-based phylogeny, which
supports the distinction of a monophyletic B. parapertussis
clade from B. bronchiseptica, is based on the largest number
of variable genomic features, and includes significantly more
B. parapertussis strains of both human and ovine origin than
previous analyses. However, several assumptions have been
made in this analysis that may influence the inferred phylogeny. In addition to the caveats accompanying the evolutionary model of unidirectional gene loss (discussed in [13]), it is
also possible that the gene complements of human and ovine
strains of B. parapertussis have been subjected to similar
selective pressures for gene loss or retention that have
resulted in the two clades appearing more closely related by
CGH-based analysis than they would in a phylogeny based on
features that are more neutral with respect to fitness, such as
silent nucleotide substitution.

Sequencing of this region from ovine B. parapertussis strain
Bpp4 revealed a fim2 gene that has only 69% nucleotide identity and 60% amino acid identity to the fim2 gene in the
sequenced human B. parapertussis strain 12822, but has
89% nucleotide identity and 88% amino acid identity to the
gene from B. pertussis (with greater divergence at the 5' end).

reports

In addition to the novel sequences found by subtractive
hybridization, previous comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) results indicated the presence of a novel fim2 gene in
three ovine strains of B. parapertussis, as well as 16 of 22 B.
bronchiseptica strains [13]. This gene encodes the major subunit of serotype 2 fimbriae, which are antigens and adhesins
in Bordetella, so we hypothesized that this fim2 allele might
play a role in host specificity. In previously published work,
two ovine B. parapertussis strains showed a greater level of
adherence to ovine tracheal rings than did two human strains
[15], and a B. pertussis fim2 mutant had decreased adherence
to human laryngeal cells [16]. We found that DNA from B.
bronchiseptica and ovine B. parapertussis strains containing
the novel fim2 gene showed some cross-hybridization to the
probe for the B. pertussis fim2 gene, which we then used to
identify the corresponding chromosomal fragment from an
ovine B. parapertussis strain (Bpp4).

gene, between two other fimbrial genes (fimN and BPP1684).
When a probe specific for the novel fim2 gene was added to
the microarray, we detected the sequence in all but one of the
other ovine strains and none of the human strains. It appears
that at some point after the divergence of human and ovine B.
parapertussis strains, either the ovine strains acquired the
additional fim2 gene through a gene duplication event, or the
human strains lost the second fim2 gene. Since most B. bronchiseptica strains also have the second gene, we favor the latter hypothesis. This fim2 allele may have been unnecessary
for colonization of the human respiratory tract or may have
been a liability for these strains due to the antigenicity of its
protein product.

reviews

LPS is an antigenic structure that usually causes bacterial
pathogens to induce a strong host immune response. A variant LPS structure in ovine B. parapertussis strains might
reflect a distinct type of host relationship with, or reactivity
for, these strains. We previously reported highly variable LPS
gene content in a collection of B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis strains [13]. Further examination of 39 B. bronchiseptica strains revealed four genetic profiles and multiple
LPS structures distinguishable by electrophoresis [14]. Our
observation that all 43 ovine B. parapertussis strains hybridized to the microarray elements for the unique LPS sequences
isolated from Bpp5 may indicate that the ovine B. parapertussis group has less variation at this locus than B. bronchiseptica strains.

comment

fosmid carrying this region from Bpp5 (from bplE to wbmU;
pBpp5fos64 (GenBank:DQ519081)) revealed that the Bpp5
LPS locus is colinear with the corresponding locus from B.
parapertussis 12822 (see Additional data file 4 for alignment), with one deleted gene (wbmE), a truncated gene
(wbmD), and a gene with a frameshift (wbmI). The genes at
either end of the Bpp5 locus are very similar to those from
12822 (average sequence identity of 98.7% for bplE-L,
wbmA-C, wbmF-H, and wbmQ-U), while the internal genes
(wbmI-P) are significantly different (65.0% average sequence
identity), and the Bpp5 open reading frame located in the
position of wbmK appears to be completely different, with the
highest BLASTn hit to a probable methyl transferase from
Wolinella succinogenes (WS2195) (Additional data file 4).

intensities in many strains, and seven RDs were not detected
in some strains from each host (RDs 4, 12, 23, 27, 29, 38, 56).
Of the remainder, 13 RDs included genes detected in the
majority of the ovine strains but not human strains, and 34
RDs contained genes that were detected in most of the human
but not ovine strains. This difference in number may reflect
the bias in the design of the original microarray, which was
based on the three sequenced Bordetella strains, one of which
was a human B. parapertussis strain. When 38 array elements representing novel sequences found in an ovine strain
were added, none were detected in any human strain (see
above). The human B. parapertussis strains showed very little variation in gene content, with no RDs detected within the
group, despite being collected from patients in nine countries
over several decades. This similarity in gene content is in
agreement with our previous study on a more limited strain
collection [13], and with other typing methods [9-11].
Several functional categories of genes were under-represented among the RDs, including ribosome constituents,
macromolecule synthesis/modification, biosynthesis of
cofactors and carriers, energy metabolism, and cell envelope.
Over-represented categories included degradation of small
molecules and chemotaxis/motility genes; the latter comprised chemotaxis protein genes cheB and cheX-Z, the flagella
genes flhA, B, F and flgB-M (RD21; Figure 1), and the B. bron-

chiseptica pilT gene (not found in the sequenced strain of B.
parapertussis), which shares approximately 70% amino acid
similarity with twitching motility proteins in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Xanthomonas axonopodis. No B. parapertussis strains have been found to be consistently motile in
vitro, so the significance of these genes is not known,
although it is possible that motility is restricted to settings
within the host. In addition, laterally acquired elements
(phage genes) and proteins with no known homologs were
over-represented in the RDs.
Within the 43 ovine strains, two subgroups of strains were
distinguished by 9 RDs (108 array elements). These
subgroups consisted of 15 and 28 strains, and did not appear
to be correlated with country of isolation, growth on tyrosine
agar, or citrate utilization (data not shown). Only a single
small RD (RD38) varied among the ovine isolates within
these subgroups. This relatively small amount of gene content
variation between ovine B. parapertussis strains was unexpectedly low, since this strain collection was significantly
larger than other collections that were reported to include
more variation, as assessed by different methods. It is possible that each ovine strain carries large unique regions of DNA
that are not represented on our microarray, but we find this
unlikely because all the ovine strains surveyed shared the
novel genes detected by subtractive hybridization of a single

Upon sacrifice of the animals at day 7 or 14 post-inoculation,
we observed a higher degree of granulocytic infiltrate in the
nasal turbinates of the group infected with the human strain

interactions

Previous experimental inoculations with B. parapertussis
have been conducted in mice [22,23], and in lambs using
intratracheal inoculation [24,25]. To simulate the dynamics
of natural infection more accurately, we inoculated adult
ewes intranasally with a large dose of either the sequenced
human strain of B. parapertussis (12822), an ovine strain
(Bpp5), or media alone. In addition, we inoculated sheep with
a 200:1 mixture of the human and ovine strains to observe the
effects of a competitive infection. Nasal persistence (monitored by nasal swabbing three times per week) of the ovine
strain group showed a steady decline over the 14 days of the
experiment, while the human strain was not detected at as
high a level by 2 days post-inoculation, and was cleared from
all animals by 7 days post-inoculation (Figure 3). Remarkably, almost all the colonies recovered from the co-inoculated
animals throughout the experiment were identified as the
ovine strain (337 of 346 colonies, 97%), despite an inoculation ratio of 200:1 in favor of the human strain, indicating
that the ovine strain was able to outcompete the human strain
during the initial stages of infection and achieve a similar
level of colonization as when the ovine strain was inoculated
alone. This suggests that the human strain did not block
access to components in the host required for the ovine strain
to persist and multiply.

refereed research

Differential transcript abundance was also detected at the bsc
locus (Figure 2), which encodes a type III secretion system
that is important for long-term tracheal colonization by B.
bronchiseptica in rodent models of infection [18,19].
Although in vivo studies of type III secretion have not been
conducted using B. parapertussis, the type III secretionassociated phenotypes were observed in ovine but not human
strains in vitro [20]. Interestingly, we detected lower transcript levels for several putative components of the secretion
apparatus (bscO-W and bscC) in ovine strains, but higher levels of the transcript for the secreted protein Bsp22 (as well as
transcripts for secreted proteins BopB, D, and N, to lesser
degrees) in these strains (Figure 2). These data support the
hypothesis that type III secretion is regulated differently
between host-restricted members of the Bordetella genus,

deposited research

Transcript abundance patterns for two human strains and
two ovine strains grown under standard laboratory conditions showed significant differences between the hostrestricted groups, even after excluding genes known to be
missing from the strains. Of the 155 transcripts whose relative
abundance was found to vary significantly between human
and ovine strains (represented by 171 microarray elements;
false discovery rate = 0.96%), 135 had lower abundance in the
ovine strains. Among these were transcripts for the LPS genes
wbmF and wbmH. Ovine strains also had lower levels of transcripts for the virulence-associated genes encoding tracheal
colonization factor (tcfA), dermonecrotic toxin (dnt), and
outer membrane porin protein Q (ompQ), as well as several
transcripts for genes in the cya locus, which encodes adenylate cyclase toxin and its secretion apparatus. Although
these data cannot be presumed to describe in vivo gene
expression, they indicate that several important toxins and
other virulence factors may be regulated differently in human
and ovine B. parapertussis.

reports

Transcriptional profiling reveals significant differences
between human and ovine strains

possibly at a post-transcriptional level. Type III secretion
underlies one of the most intimate interactions between host
and pathogen, and may reflect co-evolution of the two partners. Precise adaptation of these secretion systems to the specific host species may be essential for proper pathogen control
of host responses. Indeed, the B. bronchiseptica type III
secretion system appears to interact with both the innate and
adaptive immune systems, modulating a delicate balance and
facilitating persistent infection [21].

(Kruskall-Wallis test, p = 0.15 for both days combined; statistical power was limited due to small sample sizes) compared
to the other groups (Figure 4). We also observed a lower level
of lymphocyte infiltrate in the ovine strain group (p < 0.04).
The stronger immune response elicited by the human strain
may have led to its earlier clearance, although other factors,
such as lesser ability to adhere to host cells, may be involved
as well. A previous study reported only a mild neutrophil infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken one day after
intratracheal inoculation of lambs with ovine B. parapertussis, but this infiltrate had largely disappeared by day 3 [24]. In
addition to neutrophils, we also observed a greater degree of
eosinophil infiltrate in nasal turbinates from the animals
inoculated with the human strain of B. parapertussis (Figure
4). Although eosinophils typically are associated with parasitic infections, their migration appears to be mediated by
LPS [26]. The different LPS gene content between human and
ovine B. parapertussis might reflect LPS structures that vary
in their ability to stimulate eosinophil migration into the
sheep respiratory tract.
No B. parapertussis was detected by culture in the nasal turbinate, trachea, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, lungs, or
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of most animals after sacrifice,
although a small number of colonies were isolated from the
turbinates of one ewe inoculated with the ovine strain and one
with the mixed strains (at day 7 and 12, respectively), the lung
of one ewe inoculated with the human strain (at day 7), and

histopathological effects. This mild pathology is consistent
with previous experimental inoculations of lambs with ovine
B. parapertussis [24,25].

Conclusion

Overall, the results described here suggest that host specificity of B. parapertussis results from a process of host-pathogen co-evolution, characterized by the adaptation of

Supplementation of Bordetella microarray with Bpp5
sequences
Microarray elements were designed for the 40 unique, nonoverlapping subtractive hybridization products from the ovine
strain Bpp5 (sequences available in Additional data file 1).
PCR products for the new array elements were added to the
DNA reference at equimolar concentration to the three
sequenced Bordetella genomes.

information

Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed using
the PCR-Select Bacterial Genome Subtraction kit (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA, USA), with modifications as previously
described [13]. The tester DNA was from Bpp5, an ovine B.
parapertussis strain isolated in New Zealand. The driver
DNA was a pool of equimolar amounts of genomic DNA from

interactions

Subtractive hybridization

Genomic DNA was prepared and labeled as previously
described [33]. DNA from each strain was cohybridized with
a reference pool to Bordetella microarrays and microarray
data were analyzed as described [33]. The threshold for calling an array element 'not detected' was determined individually for each array based on its distribution of log ratios, as
previously described [13], except that histograms were created with a bin size of 0.14, and the first bin to the left of the
main peak that had fewer than 0.65% of the total measurements was used as the cutoff. When this method was applied
to the CGH data for the sequenced strain 12822, the detection
sensitivity was 96.8% and specificity was 99.4%, calculated as
previously described [13]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed essentially as described previously [13]. The dataset
was recoded in binary representation (array element not
detected = 0, detected = 1), and maximum-parsimony analysis was performed using PAUP 4.0 (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA, USA), with evolutionary assumptions as
described. The analysis used a heuristic search with 100 replicates of random sequence addition, and 100 bootstrap replicates were performed, each with 100 iterations of random
sequence addition. RDs were defined as two or more adjacent
array elements (separated by a maximum gap of one probe)
not detected in at least four (of 71) strains. Single gene

refereed research

Bordetella strains used in this study are listed in Additional
data file 5. Strains individually discussed in this report are: B.
pertussis Tohama I, isolated in Japan in the 1950s; B. parapertussis 12822, isolated from a human in the United States in
the 1940s; and B. bronchiseptica RB50, isolated from a rabbit
in the United States in the 1990s. These strains were
sequenced at the Sanger Centre [12]. B. parapertussis strains
Bpp4 and Bpp5 were both isolated from sheep in New Zealand, and Bpp212 from a sheep in Scotland. Bpp174 was isolated from a human in Sweden. Strains were grown in a liquid
suspension using modified Stainer-Scholte media (SSM) at
37°C with shaking. Sheep nasal swabs and tissue homogenates were plated on Moredun Bordetella medium (MBM)
plates, which are selective for B. parapertussis [32], and
incubated at 37°C for 4 to 5 days.

deposited research

Materials and methods

A fosmid library of Bpp5 DNA was constructed using the CopyControl fosmid library production kit (Epicentre, Madison,
WI, USA). Clones with approximately 40 kb inserts were
screened by PCR using primers for sequences of interest and
sequenced either partially, using primers flanking the insert,
or completely, by shotgun sequencing.

reports

The relatively large extent of transcriptional differences
between human and ovine strains of B. parapertussis, in
comparison to the extent of gene content differences detected
by comparative genomic hybridization, may shed light on
adaptation in other species with limited genetic diversity. For
example, in both Mycobacterium and Brucella, species with
different host preferences appear to have similar gene content
and chromosomal organization [29-31], and transcriptional
profiling might produce further insights into host-species
adaptation of these genera.

the sequenced strains B. pertussis Tohama I, B. parapertussis 12822, and B. bronchiseptica RB50. Four hundred and
eighty fragments were recovered, cloned, re-amplified, and
printed on microarrays. The microarrays were cohybridized
with DNA from the tester strain and the driver pool, and the
100 spots with the highest ratios of signal from tester versus
driver were chosen for sequencing. Sequence from 94 SSH
products was of sufficient quality to analyze, and 71 of these
were found to overlap with at least one other product. Assembly of the sequences produced a total of 40 nonoverlapping
contigs composed of one or more SSH products (GenBank:DQ518927-DQ518966). In a previous control
experiment, approximately 70% of sequences unique to the
tester pool were recovered using this technique [33].

reviews

LPS may be a common factor in host-species adaptation of
bacterial pathogens. LPS variation appears to play a role in
the host adaptation of Salmonella, in which competitive
exclusion of strains with the same O-antigen is hypothesized
to contribute to the establishment of a single dominant serotype in each host population [27]. The significance of LPS variation among Bordetella species is not fully understood, but
O-antigen mutants of B. bronchiseptica and human B. parapertussis were found to be defective in colonization in mice
compared to wild type, and the magnitude of the defects differed between the species [28].

structures and systems at the host-pathogen interface, such
as LPS, fimbriae, and type III secretion, as well as alterations
in regulation of toxins and other virulence-associated genes.
These kinds of changes may account for our finding that a
host species-adapted strain produced a less dramatic host
immune response and was less effectively cleared by the host.

variants were defined as one array element not detected in at
least 10 strains. Array elements in RDs were analyzed by functional category ([34], as classified by [12]) using binomial distribution with Bonferroni correction (results reported are
significant at p < 0.05). Primary data have been deposited
(ArrayExpress:E-TABM-94, E-MEXP-399) [35], and files
with RDs marked and binary recoding of data in pre-clustering (PCL) format [39] are available in Additional data files 6
and 7.

Analysis of transcript abundance profiles
Mid-log phase cultures were diluted in fresh SSM to a calculated absorbance of 0.05 at 600 nm. Each strain was grown in
duplicate. When cultures reached mid-log phase (OD600 1.0 to
2.0), cells were collected and RNA was isolated, labeled, and
hybridized to microarrays as described [33]. Data have been
deposited (ArrayExpress:E-TABM-95) [35]. All microarray
elements from CGH RDs that were not detected in any of the
strains used for transcript abundance profiling were excluded
from the analysis, duplicate cultures were averaged, and significance analysis of microarrays [36] was performed using
all spots with data in all strains.

Isolation and sequencing of novel fim2 gene
A Southern blot of NotI-digested Bpp4 genomic DNA was
probed with the B. pertussis strain Tohama I fim2 microarray
probe sequence. Fragments of the appropriate size were
extracted and cloned, and colonies screened by colony blots to
identify a clone carrying the fim2 sequence. The insert
sequence was derived by primer walking (GenBank:DQ499949). A microarray probe specific for the new
fim2 sequence was added to the arrays.

Sheep inoculation with B. parapertussis
Liquid cultures to be used for inocula were diluted to approximately equivalent optical densities and delivered as 5 ml/
nostril (10 ml/sheep). Twenty-four healthy adult female
sheep (Suffolk and Suffolk-cross) were divided into four
groups of six; each group was housed in a separate room.
Group 1 was inoculated intranasally with 1.1 × 1011 cfu ovine
B. parapertussis (Bpp4), group 2 with 2.2 × 1011 cfu human B.
parapertussis (strain 12822), group 3 with an approximately
200:1 mixture of human and ovine B. parapertussis (2.2 ×
1011 cfu human strain and 1.1 × 109 cfu ovine strain), and
group 4 with media alone. Nasal swabbing was performed one
week before the inoculations, and three times a week thereafter. Calcium alginate fiber tipped aluminum applicator swabs
(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) were inserted as far
into the nasal cavity as possible and rotated, then streaked
heavily onto MBM plates and rinsed vigorously in 200 µl
physiological salts solution (100 mM potassium acetate, 20
mM HEPES, 2.5 mM magnesium acetate). The swab rinses
were boiled for 15 minutes and 1 µl of the lysate was used as
template for PCR to detect IS1001, which is unique to B. parapertussis, using primers BPPA and BPPZ [37]. The same
PCR was used to confirm the identity of colonies that grew on

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/9/R81

MBM plates. The PCR mix contained 1 × PCR Buffer II
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.6 mM dNTPs, 20 pmol each primer, and 1.25 U AmpliTaq
DNA polymerase. The cycling conditions were 96°C for 10
minutes; 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 45
s; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. PCR products
were run on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium
bromide staining. Sensitivity of detection was determined to
be <100 cfu, using dilutions of known quantities of Bpp4. To
distinguish between the human and ovine strain in colonies
recovered from the co-inoculated animals, multiplex PCR was
performed on randomly selected colonies from each sample
(total of 346) with the B. parapertussis primers BPPA and
BPPZ as well as primers specific for the fim2 gene found in
Bpp4 but not 12822 (GTCCTCGCCTGGCACATT and
GGTCGCCAACGTTCTTCAA), using the PCR conditions and
cycles described above.
Half of the animals in each inoculation group were sacrificed
on day 7 post-inoculation, and the other half on day 14. Samples were taken of the nasal turbinate, mid-trachea (approximately 18 cm above bifurcation), tracheobronchial lymph
node, and lungs (combined right and left caudal and cranial
lobes). Each tissue was weighed and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 100 µl of four serial dilutions (5- to 5000-fold) were plated in duplicate on MBM
plates. In addition, the accessory lobe of each sheep was filled
with 25 ml PBS and aspirated, and 100 µl of the recovered
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was plated undiluted.
Sections of tissues were scored subjectively from 0 to 4 on
predetermined scales for degree of leukocyte infiltration,
necrosis, and cilia loss. Leukocyte infiltration for intraluminal
exudates (subdivided into granulocytes, macrophages, and
lymphocytes) was scored as: 0 = no infiltration (no remarkable lesions); 1 = detectable infiltration (minimal); 2 = infiltration involving <30% of the section (mild); 3 = dense
infiltration involving 30% to 60% of the section (moderate); 4
= dense infiltration involving >60% of the section (marked/
severe). Extent of erosion/ulceration of respiratory epithelia
was scored as: 0 = no erosion; 1 = one region; 2 = two regions;
3 = multifocal (more than three regions); 4 = greater than
90% of respiratory epithelia. Cilia loss was scored as: 0 = no
loss; 1 = one focal region; 2 = two regions; 3 = multifocal
(more than three regions); 4 = diffuse loss.
