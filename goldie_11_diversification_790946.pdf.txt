Diversification and the rate of molecular
evolution: no evidence of a link in mammals
Xavier Goldie*, Robert Lanfear and Lindell Bromham

Abstract
Background: Recent research has indicated a positive association between rates of molecular evolution and
diversification in a number of taxa. However debate continues concerning the universality and cause of this
relationship. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of this relationship within the mammals. We use
phylogenetically independent sister-pair comparisons to test for a relationship between substitution rates and clade
size at a number of taxonomic levels. Total, non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated
from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences.
Results: We found no evidence for an association between clade size and substitution rates in mammals, for either
the nuclear or the mitochondrial sequences. We found significant associations between body size and substitution
rates, as previously reported.
Conclusions: Our results present a contrast to previous research, which has reported significant positive
associations between substitution rates and diversification for birds, angiosperms and reptiles. There are three
possible reasons for the differences between the observed results in mammals versus other clades. First, there may
be no link between substitution rates and diversification in mammals. Second, this link may exist, but may be
much weaker in mammals than in other clades. Third, the link between substitution rates and diversification may
exist in mammals, but may be confounded by other variables.

Background
Diversification is the net outcome of speciation and
extinction. Clade size, the current species richness of a
lineage, is a measure of net diversification because it is
the result of the addition of species through speciation
and the removal by extinction. A number of recent studies have shown positive relationships between rates of
molecular evolution and net diversification. A positive
relationship between substitution rates and species richness has been reported in angiosperms [1,2], carnivorous
plants [3], and birds and reptiles [4,5]. Additionally, a
relationship between the molecular path lengths of
lineages and the number of nodes through which those
lineages pass in molecular phylogenies has been interpreted as evidence of a connection between net diversification and rates of molecular evolution in a large range
of taxa [6-8].

There are a number of possible causes of a relationship between rates of molecular evolution and net diversification. It has been suggested that elevated
substitution rates in diverging populations are the result
of changes to the selective and demographic landscape
that accompany speciation [6,7]. Changed selective
regimes at speciation could lead to elevated substitution
rates at a number of loci as species adapt to new niches
[9,10]. Strong reinforcing selection at hybrid contact
zones, in particular, can lead to elevated substitution
rates in genes associated with reproductive isolation
[11-15]. Neutral loci linked to positively selected genes
may also experience increased substitution rates at speciation events [16-18].
However, the majority of studies that report a link
between net diversification and substitution rates focus
on genes that are not obviously associated with traits
under strong positive selection during speciation events.
Rather, they tend to be based on “house-keeping” genes,
such as metabolic genes (e.g. CYTB, COIII, ND2,
ALDOB) and genes associated with transcription and

translation (e.g. 16S rRNA, EEF2, MYC) [4,5]. The
observation that substitution rates at these loci are positively correlated to species richness suggests that genome-wide substitution rates are associated with net
diversification.
It has been suggested that the process of speciation
may cause increases in genome-wide substitution rates
[7]. For instance, if small, fragmented and genetically
isolated founder populations characterise most speciation events, slightly deleterious mutations may be fixed
at an elevated rate due to reductions in the effective
population size (Ne) [19].
It is also possible the link between net diversification
and rates of molecular evolution could be caused by differences in mutation rates between lineages. For
instance, higher mutation rates, and subsequently elevated substitution rates, may lead to a more rapid acquisition of hybrid incompatibilities in diverging
populations [20-22]. Given that hybrid incompatibilities
accrue faster than linearly with the number of substitutions between diverging populations [23], even small differences in the underlying mutation rate could lead to
relatively large differences in the number of incompatibilities between taxa, potentially resulting in more rapid
reproductive isolation. In addition, elevated mutation
rates may lead to higher levels of standing variation
[24,25] available for divergent selection to act on during
speciation, leading to the more rapid acquisition of local
adaptations [11]. Elevated mutation rates could potentially influence net diversification by lowering extinction
rates, for example by generating standing variation on
which selection for adaptation to environmental change
can act [26].
Finally, there may be no direct causal link between
rates of molecular evolution and net diversification.
Instead, the association between may be caused indirectly by co-variation between molecular evolutionary
rates, diversification and other traits and processes.
Shorter generation time, higher fecundity and shorter
life-spans have all been linked to substitution rates in
mammals [24,27-29]. If these processes independently
influence the process of diversification, this may lead to
a non-causal association between substitution rates and
net diversification. For instance, it has been suggested
that larger bodied mammals have a higher extinction
risk due to the effect of reduced reproductive rates and
low population densities [30,31]. Consequently, if extinction rates determine clade size, larger bodied animals
may characterise smaller clades. This could lead to an
indirect positive association between clade size and substitution rates.
Methodological artifacts could also cause an association between rates of molecular evolution and diversification. For example, it has been suggested that the node

Page 2 of 12

density effect, where molecular branch-lengths which
pass through more nodes tend to be longer, could be
responsible for the association between rates of molecular evolution and diversification in some studies [32].
However an association between rates and diversification has also been noted in studies that controlled for
the node density effect [5].
Mammals provide an ideal opportunity to investigate
the generality and potential direction of causality of the
relationship between net diversification and rates of
molecular evolution. A considerable amount of research
has been conducted investigating the relationship
between substitution rate variation and life history in
mammals [27,28,33,34]. In particular, body size, generation time and longevity have been shown to be associated with substitution rates [27,28,34]. The availability
of a large amount of life history data for mammals permits their inclusion in this study as a potentially confounding factor [35]. Additionally, phylogenetic
relationships are well studied in mammals [36-42],
allowing independent sister-clades to be chosen with
some confidence.
In this study, we use phylogenetically independent
comparisons of sister clades to test for an association
between substitution rate and clade size in mammals.
Using protein-coding genes from both nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes, we test for a relationship
between clade size and total substitution rates (T),
synonymous substitution rates (dS), non-synonymous
substitution rates (dN), and the ratio of dN to dS (ω).
These measures provide a way in which to examine
the different processes that may cause rates of molecular
evolution to co-vary with clade size. Synonymous mutations do not change the encoded amino acid sequences,
and while not necessarily neutral [43,44], are expected
to have sufficiently small selection co-efficients [25,43],
for differences in dS between species to closely reflect
underlying differences in mutation rates [45]. Nonsynonymous mutations, by contrast, change the encoded
amino acid sequences. These changes are more likely to
be affected by the interaction between selection and
effective population size (Ne), that is, slightly deleterious
non-synonymous substitutions are expected to be fixed
in populations of smaller Ne at a greater rate than in larger populations [45]. As a result, dN is expected to be
influenced by Ne, selection and mutation rates. Consequently, higher values of ω may reflect reduced Ne or
increased positive selection.
If positive selection or reductions in Ne at speciation
events were responsible for the link between net diversification and substitution rates, then we would expect to
observe a positive relationship between ω and clade size.
This is because both positive selection and reductions in
Ne should increase the fixation rate of non-synonymous

Goldie et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:286
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/286

mutations, but are unlikely to greatly influence the rate
of fixation of synonymous mutations. By contrast, if
higher net diversification was an outcome of elevated
mutation rates causing more rapid reproductive isolation
and divergence, then we would expect to observe positive relationships between all measures of substitution
rate and clade size, but not necessarily a relationship
between ω and clade size [5].

Methods
Sister-Pairs

We used phylogenetically independent [46] sister-pairs
of clades to investigate the relationship between substitution rates and clade size, using both nuclear and mitochondrial sequences. Each of the two clades in a sisterpair has had, by definition, the same amount of time
since their most recent common ancestor to accumulate
both species and genetic change. Thus, any difference in
species numbers between the sister-pair reflects a difference in net diversification since their last common
ancestor. Similarly, difference in the average substitution
rate since their most recent common ancestor should be
reflected as a difference in molecular branch length
between a sister-pair [1]. Each sister-pair is independent
of other such pairs, and therefore fulfills the requirement of independence for subsequent statistical analyses
[46,47].
We used published phylogenies to select our phylogenetically independent sister-pairs and their nearest
available out-groups. We excluded any potential sisterpairs for which a reciprocally monophyletic relationship
between the two clades was not well supported in the
literature. References in support of each sister-pair in
our analyses are included in Additional File 1.
Mitochondrial Sister-Pairs and Sequence Data

For our mitochondrial analyses we investigated the relationship between clade size and substitution rates using
28 sister-pairs of clades, corresponding approximately to
family level contrasts. Our mitochondrial dataset also
provided the additional opportunity to perform analyses
on deeper (n = 9 pairs) and shallower (n = 27) sisterpairs of clades, to test whether the relationship between
clade size and substitution rate differed with the taxonomic level of the clades [48]. Details of these sisterpairs are included in Additional File 1.
For mitochondrial analyses, we used all protein coding
genes from the heavy strand of whole mitochondrial
genomes available from GenBank (ND1, ND2, ND3,
ND4, ND4L, ND5, COI, COII, COIII, ATP6, ATP8 and
CYTB). We removed regions of coding overlap shared
by mitochondrial genes (ATP8-ATP6, ATP6-COIII,
ND4L-ND4).

To avoid the node density effect in maximum likelihood substitution rate estimates [32,49], we used a single mitochondrial genome sequence to represent each
clade. A single sequence can be used to estimate representative substitution rates for a clade because a number
of the substitutions from that sequence will occur on
internal (shared) branches (Figure 1). Although some
potential data are excluded using this method, it reduces
the likelihood that substitution rate estimates are biased
by the node density effect [5].
Where more than one mitochondrial genome
sequence was available on GenBank for a given clade,
we selected the sequences based on the number of
internal nodes in the published molecular phylogenies
used to select the sister clades. In the more speciose
clade, we chose the sequence with the greatest number
of internal nodes. In the less speciose clade, we selected
the sequence with the fewest number of internal nodes
(shown in Figure 1). We did this in order to maximize
the potential difference in number of cladogenetic
events, and thus to increase the power to detect any difference in branch length due to lineages undergoing cladogenesis [6,8], without reconstructing those nodes in
the estimation of rates, which may lead to node density
effect [32].
Nuclear Sister-Pairs and Sequence Data

For our nuclear data, we investigated the relationship
between substitution rate and clade size using 31 sisterpairs of clades, corresponding to approximately familylevel contrasts. We also tested for relationships between
clade size and substitution rate within specific groups of
mammals, as it has been shown that patterns of substitution rate variation and patterns of diversification can
differ between these groups [27,28]. Consequently, we
tested for a relationship between clade size and substitution rate independently for the Eutheria (n = 22 pairs)
and the Metatheria (n = 7). Details of these sister-pairs
are included in Additional File 1.
For our nuclear analyses, we used nuclear genes
obtained from GenBank. There was a substantial
trade-off between taxonomic and genetic coverage for
nuclear gene sequences. In order to optimise both of
these (and thus optimise power in subsequent regression analyses), different sets of nuclear genes were chosen for different groups. Our whole mammalian
analysis (n = 31) included BRCA1, RAG1 and VWF
(2850 bp); our eutherian analysis (n = 22) included
ADORA3, ATP7A, BDNF, BRCA1, RAG1, RAG2 and
VWF (4302 bp); and our metatherian analysis (n = 7)
included APOB, BRCA1, IRBP, RAG1 and VWF (4255
bp). These genes were the most widely sampled
nuclear protein coding sequences available on

those for which sequence data is available. Using our methods, Taxon D is selected for analysis, because its root-to-tip branch is separated from
the basal node by 6 nodes, compared to 3 for Taxon L. By contrast Taxon A is selected for analysis using our methods because its root-to-tip
branch is separated from the basal node by two internal nodes, compared to one for Taxon C. In both cases, a large component of the
sequences are shared by other members of the respective clades over the whole molecular branch length, relative to the sister clade.

GenBank. Accession numbers for nuclear gene
sequences are contained in Additional File 1.
As with our mitochondrial analysis, to reduce the
impact of the node density effect in maximum likelihood substitution rate estimates we used a single representative nuclear gene sequence for each clade. We used
the same selection criteria for selecting our sequences
where more than one sequence was available for a gene
within a given clade. In some instances, we were unable
to obtain all nuclear gene sequences from a single species to represent a given clade. In these instances, we
constructed chimeric sequences, where gene sequences
were sourced from different species within a single
clade. In doing so, we selected species that were as closely related as possible.

Substitution Rate Estimates

We used HyPhy v1.0b [50] to estimate total (T), synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) branch lengths
on the sister pairs shown in Additional File 2. We used
the Muse and Gaut [51] model of codon substitution
(MG94), coupled with a general time reversible model
of sequence evolution, with codon frequencies estimated
from the data in a 3 × 4 matrix (that is, frequencies of
bases were estimated for each codon position). This
model is denoted the MG94xREV_3 × 4_DualRV model
in HyPhy notation. The dual rate variation models in
HyPhy explicitly accounts for variation in dS across both
lineages and sites, potentially allowing for more accurate
estimates of both dS and ω than other methods [52,53].
We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to

Goldie et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:286
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/286

determine whether our datasets should be partitioned
[54]. For the nuclear sequences, the best AIC score was
obtained with separate MG94xREV_3 × 4_DualRV
codon substitution models, equilibrium frequencies, and
rate parameters estimated for each gene. For the mitochondrial sequences, the best AIC score was obtained
with a single MG94xREV_3 × 4_DualRV codon substitution model estimated for all genes combined. Estimates of T, dN and dS, were calculated for each branch
of the phylogeny; the latter two were used to calculate
ω. However, only the substitution rate and ω estimates
for terminal branches were retained for use in subsequent analyses [55].
Clade Size

We used extant clade size as a measure of net diversification for our analyses. Previous research investigating these
relationships have used varied metrics to represent diversification, including extant clade size [1,5], node number
[6,8] and diversification rate [4]. Differences in extant clade
size between sister clades - which are by definition the
same age - are measures of differences in the net diversification rates of those clades. We calculated extant species
numbers for each clade in each sister-pair from Wilson
and Reeder’s Mammal Species of the World [56], ensuring
also that species numbers reflected any changes to taxonomy within more recent systematics literature. Species
numbers for each clade are given in Additional File 1.
Body size

Substitution rates in mammals are known to be influenced by a number of life history variables, including
generation time [29], fecundity [27], and longevity [57].
These life history variables, which are correlated with
body size [58,59], have also been suggested as candidate
variables influencing net diversification in mammals
[60-63]. It is possible that an association between substitution rates and clade size may be the result of both net
diversification and substitution rates co-varying independently with these life-history variables. We tested for
these indirect associations between clade size and substitution rate by including body size in our analyses.
We calculated body mass contrasts for each sister pair
used in our analyses. We obtained body mass values for
most species in each clade from the panTHERIA database [35]. For eight species for which a value was not
available in panTHERIA, we sourced body mass estimates from the literature. Where more than one estimate for a species was available in the primary
literature, we took the arithmetic mean for all available
estimates for the species, weighted by the sample sizes
of the estimates, and excluding extreme minimal and
maximal values. These data, together with references,
are available in Additional File 3.

Page 5 of 12

We used the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of
Welch and Waxman [55] to calculate body mass contrasts for each sister pair. The MLE uses suitably transformed (in this case, log transformed [64]) body size
values with the phylogeny of the sub-tree defined by the
most recent common ancestor of the two clades to calculate time-averaged differences in body mass between
clades. We used a number of source phylogenies for
these estimates [39,41,61,65,66]. This maximum likelihood estimation method has advantages over simple
averages of body sizes (tip measurements) across a
clade, in that it is less prone to the effect of extreme
values; provides robust estimates where data may be
missing (i.e. unmeasured tips); and takes into account
the evolution of the trait over a clade’s evolutionary
history.
Statistical Tests
Testing for Substitution Rate Variation

We tested whether our alignments contained significant
variation in substitution rates between terminal lineages.
We compared the likelihoods of two models: an equalrate model, where terminal branches within a pair are
constrained to have equal substitution rates, but substitution rates are allowed to vary between pairs; and a
free-rate model, where a separate substitution rate is
estimated for each terminal branch. We calculated the
likelihood of each of these models using the phylogenies
shown in Additional File 2. We used Akaike information
criterion scores (AIC) to compare the likelihoods of the
two models [54]. We took a difference in AIC (ΔAIC)
scores of 10 units as our threshold for significance,
where ΔAIC < 10 failed to reject the null hypothesis of
no difference in substitution rates. Details of this analysis are included in Additional File 4.
Linear regressions

We tested for associations between differences in clade
size, body size and substitution rates, using linear
regressions forced through the origin [47,67]. Differences in the variables for each sister pair were calculated
as ln(VA)-ln(VB), where ln(Vi) represents the log-transformed variable for Clade i. Log transformation of the
variables was necessary to meet the assumptions of
parametric regressions. Diagnostic tests recommended
by Freckleton [68] indicated that these transformations
were appropriate.
More distantly diverged sister-pairs are associated with
more evolutionary change, and thus tend to generate
contrasts of larger magnitude; this can lead to unequal
variance between data points [47,67], which violates the
assumptions of parametric statistical tests. To account
for this, we standardised differences in all variables by
weighting each contrast by a measure of the pair’s
genetic divergence. We determined that the square root

Goldie et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:286
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/286

of the sum of the pair’s total substitution branch length
values was suitable as a measure of standardisation: (TA +
TB)0.5. We used the diagnostic methods recommended by
Garland [67] to confirm that these standardisations were
appropriate for the data to meet assumptions of linear
regression. Contrasts were excluded from the analysis
where diagnostic tests indicated that the differences in
substitution rates could not be reliably estimated from the
molecular branch lengths, either because the contrasts
were too shallow, or their substitution rates too slow
[27,55], or their substitution rates saturated (i.e. > 1 substitutions per site for T; > 1 substitutions per codon for dN
and dS). Details of which data points were removed for
each analysis are indicated in Additional File 1.
To verify that our results were not dependent on the
transformations or standardisations used, all statistics
were also performed on non-transformed and non-standardised data, and the results did not differ. All statistics
and diagnostic tests were performed in R [69].
Correction for multiple tests

Our analysis resulted in a number of tests of three hypotheses: dN, dS, T and ω are associated with clade size; dN, dS,
T and ω are associated with body size; and clade size is
associated with body size. Weighted Z tests were used to
address the issue of multiple testing [70]. A weighted Z test
combines tests of the same hypothesis to assess the support
for that hypothesis across different datasets. To combine
tests of the same hypothesis performed on different datasets, the P values from the individual regressions are first
converted to one-tailed P values. In this instance, we converted P values from regressions (two-tailed) to one-tailed
values by assuming that substitution rate would be positively associated with clade size (as observed by [1,4-6,70])
and negatively associated with body mass (as observed by
[27]). Values were then converted to individual Z-scores.
We then calculated an overall weighted Z-score, weighting
each individual Z-score by the degrees of freedom in each
test,[70]. Weighted Z-scores were then used to calculate
overall P values for the combined test for each hypothesis.
In combining our tests of hypotheses of clade size
against measures of rates of molecular evolution, T, dN,
dS and ω were treated separately, given that we were
testing for the effect of each independently on clade size
in our analyses. For example, we combined the P values
for tests of dN against clade size, from both nuclear and
mitochondrial datasets. For tests of body size against
measures of rates of molecular evolution, dN, dS and T
and were also treated separately. Details of the Z-tests
are included in Additional File 5.

Results
Evidence of Substitution Rate Variation

A free-rate model, where a separate substitution rate
was estimated for each branch, had significantly better

Page 6 of 12

fit to the data for 4 of our 6 alignments, over an equalrate mode where terminal branches within a pair had
equal substitution rates. Free-rate models for dN, dS
and T all had a significantly better fit to the data for
these alignments; only results for T are shown. For two
of our alignments (mitochondrial shallow, nuclear
metatherian), an equal-rate model had significantly better fit to the data over a free-rate model. Equal-rate
models for dN, dS and T were all significantly preferred
for these alignments; only results for T are shown.
Details of this analysis are included in Additional File 4.
Mitochondrial Data

There were no significant associations between T or dN
or dS and clade size for our 28 approximately family
level mitochondrial contrasts of mammals (Table 1), nor
for deeper (n = 9, Table 2) or shallower (n = 27, Table
3) contrasts. Mitochondrial dS estimates were saturated
for the majority of taxa (Family: 27/28; Deep: 9/9; Shallow: 24/27), making tests of their association with clade
size and body size unreliable. We attempted to address
this issue by measuring rates of synonymous transversion at RY coded four-fold degenerate sites. However,
we were not able to detect the expected relationship
between synonymous transversion rates and body size
[27]. As such we did not consider that these measures
of substitution rate had sufficient power, and we do not
address them further.
In case synonymous substitution rates were overestimated by the particular model in HyPhy, we re-estimated our mitochondrial rates in PAML v4.4 [71] using
a codon-based substitution model of Goldman and Yang
[72]. Both the synonymous and non-synonymous codon
substitution rates were allowed to take branch-specific
values. We subsequently obtained fewer saturated
synonymous substitution rates for the approximately
family level (11/28) and shallower contrasts (3/28); all of
our deeper contrasts remained saturated. We did not
find a significant relationship between clade size and dS,

or ω for these re-estimated data (Tables 1, 2 and 3).
However, we also did not detect the expected positive
relationship between dS and body size [27], indicating
our data most likely did not have sufficient power.
Therefore, as a post hoc analysis, we used mitochondrial dS, dN, and ω estimates for mammalian sister
clades from Welch et al. [27] to test for a clade size
effect, in order to maximise our power to detect these
relationships. This dataset contains mammalian sister
pairs from varying taxonomic depths (1.4 MYA - 74.1
MYA), covering ~9,500 bp of mitochondrial protein
coding sequences. Branch specific codon substitution
rates were estimated by the authors in PAML [71].
From that dataset, we excluded pairs that did not have
support in the literature as reciprocally monophyletic
sister clades to the exclusion of all the other pairs, or
where we were unable to determine clade sizes. We also
excluded pairs excluded by the original authors due to
their failure to meet the assumptions required for linear
regressions. We then calculated species numbers for
each member of each sister-pair and standardised them
according to Welch et al.’s [27] methods (Details in
Additional File 1). We calculated MLE body mass contrasts for each sister pair of clades. We excluded dS
Table 3 Mitochondrial Shallow Level Contrasts

Nuclear Data

We did not find any association between clade size and
any of the measures of substitution rate (T, dN, dS) estimated from our nuclear gene data set for 32 mammalian sister pairs (Table 5). We found a significant
positive association between total substitution rate (T)
and clade size in the Eutheria-only data set (R 2 =
0.1857, P = 0.0453: Table 6). However, this relationship
was not detected in analyses of clade size against dN or
dS for the Eutheria-only data, and is not significant
when corrected for multiple tests (see below). Our
Metatheria-only analysis did not produce any significant
association between substitution rate and clade size
(Table 7). We did not find any association between ω

We did not detect a significant relationship between
body size and our estimates of T or dN substitution

However, we could detect the previously reported relationship between body size and dS estimates from the

between ω and body size in any of the nuclear data sets.
Body size was not significantly associated with clade size
in any of the nuclear data sets.
The MLE method of body mass contrast estimation
assumes homogeneity of variance in body size between
both clades in a sister pair. We found that this assumption was not valid for a minority of contrasts (Additional
File 1). Consequently, we also calculated body mass contrasts based on the logarithm of geometric means of sister clades - an approach which does assume that sister
clades have homogeneous variance in body size. We
tested whether the MLE contrasts and geometric mean
contrasts for each sister pair were significantly different
using a paired t-test. None of the datasets had significant differences between the MLE contrasts or geometric mean contrasts (Additional File 1). Furthermore,
results of all regressions were qualitatively identical
using contrasts calculated with either approach.
Correction for multiple tests

Weighted Z tests indicate there is no association
between clade size and ω, T, dN or dS across all datasets (Table 8), identifying the association between
Eutheria-only total substitution rate (T) and clade size
as a likely false positive. By contrast, weighted Z tests
indicate that there is a negative association between
body mass and substitution rate estimates, except for

Tables 5, 6 and 7 - Regressions between rates, clade size and body size for
nuclear sequence data.

P = 0.2297, dS: P = 5.20 × 10-5, T: P = 7.3 × 10-4; Table
4). However, previous studies have indicated that mitochondrial dN rates are not associated with body mass
[27]. When these dN results are separated into mitochondrial and nuclear data sets, weighted Z tests show a
significant negative association between body mass and
nuclear dN (P = 0.0017; Table 4), but not mitochondrial
(P = 0.7873), consistent with these previous results.
There was no significant relationship between ω and
body mass across all datasets (P = 0.1026; Table 4).

Discussion
We have found no evidence for a link between net
diversification and substitution rate in mammals. We
did not find a significant relationship between clade size

and total substitution rate (T), non-synonymous substitution rates (dN), or synonymous substitution rates (dS)
for any of our mitochondrial or nuclear datasets. These
results are in contrast to results of similar studies on
other taxa, which have shown a positive relationship
between rates of molecular evolution and clade size in
angiosperms [1], birds [4,5], and reptiles [4], and a positive relationship between molecular branch lengths and
the number of nodes through which those branches
pass in a large range of taxa [6,8].
There are a number of explanations for our failure to
detect a relationship between substitution rates and
clade size in mammals: (1) the relationship exists but
our analyses do not have the power to detect it; (2) the
relationship exists, but is confounded by other processes
in mammals; and (3) the relationship between clade size
and substitution rates is not universal and does not exist
in mammals.
We cannot rule out a lack of power producing the
results we report here, but we do not consider this the
most likely explanation for our results. We were able to
detect a significant relationship between body size and
substitution rates in both our nuclear data and the mitochondrial data from Welch et al [27], indicating that the
data used here have the power to detect associations
between substitution rate and life history variables.
Given the previously reported strength of the association
between clade size and substitution rates in other
groups (angiosperms, 89 comparisons, ~5 kbp [1]; reptiles, 16 comparisons ~10 kbp DNA [4]; and birds, 12
comparisons and ~10 kbp for mtDNA [4], 32 comparisons and ~17 kbp for nuclear DNA [5]), the lack of a
significant relationship between substitution rate and
clade size in our data (42 comparisons and ~10 kbp for
mtDNA, 31 comparisons and ~3 kbp for nuclear DNA)
suggests that this relationship is either weak or absent
in mammals.
It is possible that there is an association between substitution rates and clade size in mammals, but that this
relationship is masked by interactions with other variables. For instance, it has been suggested that abundance (measured as group size or population density) is
positively linked to diversification rate in mammals [62].
If abundance is also correlated to effective population
size, then more abundant mammal species could have
reduced rates of non-synonymous substitution, since
slightly deleterious mutations have lower fixation probabilities in larger populations [45,73]. So it is possible
that more abundant mammal species have both higher
net diversification and lower substitution rate, and that
these relationships could confound our ability to observe
a positive link between net diversification and the substitution rate. However, if the link between diversification and molecular evolution is confounded by effective

Page 9 of 12

population size, we might expect to detect an association between ω and clade size, which we have not seen
in this study.
Perhaps a more likely explanation for the lack of an
association between substitution rates and clade size in
mammals is that the relationship does not exist for this
group. Previous explanations of the association between
rates of molecular evolution and clade size have focused
on three possible causes: (i) speciation causes increases
in substitution rates; (ii) mutation rates drive diversification; and (iii) both diversification and substitution rate
are linked to another factor.
Some previous studies have explained a positive association between net diversification and substitution rate
as the result of the demographic and selective processes
characterising speciation [7]. Specifically, more frequent
speciation events could be expected to lead to reductions of the long term N e in more rapidly speciating
clades [6,8]. Reductions in long term N e would be
expected to increase the fixation rate of nearly neutral
mutations (i.e. those with selection co-efficients
approaching 1/N e ) [73], and thus increase the nonsynonymous substitution rate. If this is the cause of the
previously noted link between diversification and rates
of molecular evolution then it is possible that the connection between speciation events and substitution rate
is for some reason not as strong in mammals. For example, it is possible that frequent population size fluctuations in mammals overwhelm any signal of population
size reduction associated with speciation events.
A recent study indicated that the correlation between
substitution rate and clade size in birds might be driven
by the effect of mutation rates on the process of diversification [5]. Hybrid fitness in birds has been shown to
be inversely proportional to genetic distances between
parents [74-77], possibly supporting a significant role for
the accumulation of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities in speciation in birds [20,21]. If this is the case,
then the rate of formation of species through post-zygotic hybrid incompatibility might be influenced by the
mutation rate [22,23]. It has been suggested that hybrid
incompatibilities in mammals develop at a much faster
rate than in birds [78], possibly due to higher rates of
regulatory evolution [78,79]. If reproductive isolation in
mammals is determined to a greater degree by adaptive
divergence at regulatory and developmental loci (such as
those loci associated with placentation, genomic
imprinting or mediating viviparity driven conflicts
[80-82]), then the molecular change accompanying speciation may be predominantly in a few key loci, rather
than due to the accumulation of genome-wide
incompatibilities.
It is also possible that the positive association between
rates of molecular evolution and clade size observed in

Goldie et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:286
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/286

some taxa is not due to a direct effect of speciation on
molecular evolution, or vice versa, but the result of
another variable driving both processes independently of
each other, leading to an indirect correlation between
the two.
Many life-history correlates of substitution rate in
mammals have been identified [27,29,57], however, few
of these life history traits have been shown to consistently scale with mammalian clade size. The life-history
traits that scale with substitution rates in mammals
(generation time, fecundity, and longevity) also correlate
tightly with body size [57-59]. Because of this, body size
is significantly negatively associated with substitution
rates, as demonstrated both here and in other studies
[24,27,29,53,59]. If extinction rates increase with body
size, it could reduce the clade size of larger-bodied taxa
potentially leading to an indirect positive relationship
between substitution rates and clade size. However, a
consistent relationship between body size and clade size
in mammals has not been established - we find no evidence for such a relationship in this study, and the
results of other studies are equivocal and inconsistent
across different clades of mammals [60,62,63,83]. Taken
together these results suggest that it is unlikely in mammals that body size, or life history traits that correlate
with size, drives both substitution rates and diversification (via extinction or speciation) rates, as may be the
case in other taxa [5,83].

Conclusions
Contrary to patterns observed in other taxa, we have not
detected a relationship between clade size in mammals
and substitution rate, measured from total, synonymous
and non-synonymous substitution rates in both nuclear
or mitochondrial genes. Given that our study is likely to
have comparable power to other similar studies, these
results suggest that any association between net diversification and substitution rate is either absent or very
weak in mammals.
