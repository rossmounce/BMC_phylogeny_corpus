Abstract
Background: Campylobacter is the most commonly reported bacterial cause of enteritis in
humans in the EU Member States and other industrialized countries. One significant source of
infection is broilers and consumption of undercooked broiler meat. Campylobacter jejuni is the
Campylobacter sp. predominantly found in infected humans and colonized broilers. Sequence
analysis of the 16S rRNA gene is very useful for identification of bacteria to genus and species level.
The objectives in this study were to determine the degree of intraspecific variation in the 16S rRNA
genes of C. jejuni and C. coli and to determine whether the 16S rRNA sequence types correlated
with genotypes generated by PFGE analysis of SmaI restricted genomic DNA of the strains.
Methods: The 16S rRNA genes of 45 strains of C. jejuni and two C. coli strains isolated from
broilers were sequenced and compared with 16S rRNA sequences retrieved from the Ribosomal
Database Project or GenBank. The strains were also genotyped by PFGE after digestion with SmaI.
Results: Sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA genes revealed nine sequence types of the
Campylobacter strains and the similarities between the different sequence types were in the range
99.6–99.9%. The number of nucleotide substitutions varied between one and six among the nine
16S rRNA sequence types. One of the nine 16S rRNA sequence profiles was common to 12 of the
strains from our study and two of these were identified as Campylobacter coli by PCR/REA. The
other 10 strains were identified as Campylobacter jejuni. Five of the nine sequence types were also
found among the Campylobacter sequences deposited in GenBank. The three 16S rRNA genes in
the analysed strains were identical within each individual strain for all 47 strains.
Conclusion: C. jejuni and C. coli seem to lack polymorphisms in their 16S rRNA gene, but
phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences was not always sufficient for differentiation
between C. jejuni and C. coli. The strains were grouped in two major clusters according to 16S
rRNA, one cluster with only C. jejuni and the other with both C. jejuni and C. coli. Genotyping of the
47 strains by PFGE after digestion with SmaI resulted in 22 subtypes. A potential correlation was
found between the SmaI profiles and the 16S rRNA sequences, as a certain SmaI type only appeared
in one of the two major phylogenetic groups.

Background
Campylobacter spp., principally Campylobacter jejuni
subsp.jejuni, are important food- and water-borne pathogens for man [1-3]. In the present paper Campylobacter
jejuni subsp. jejuni is referred to as C. jejuni and Campylobacter jejuni subsp. doylei as C. doylei. Campylobacter jejuni
is frequently found in the intestinal tract in a wide variety
of wild and domesticated animals, especially poultry
[1,4]. The genus Campylobacter was introduced by Sebald
and Verón [5] and its taxonomic structure has been
revised a number of times [6-8]. At present the genus
Campylobacter contains 17 species, four of which have
been further divided into eight subspecies [9]http://
www.bacterio.cict.fr/. The use of molecular methods in
bacteriology has resulted in increased knowledge about
biodiversity within the genus Campylobacter. Sequence
analysis of the 16S rRNA gene has proved extremely useful
for evolutionary studies of prokaryotes [10] and constitutes the basis for the revised taxonomy of bacteria [11].
This method has also been successfully used for identification of Campylobacter spp. [12]. Taxonomy has become
a flexible and constantly evolving science and further
progress in methodologies will probably result in additional adjustments in the classification of members of the
genus Campylobacter. Furthermore, several PCR assays
have successfully been applied for detection of Campylobacter with improved accuracy in identification of Campylobacter spp. from various sources.
Isolates from different bacteria can be identified to genus
and often also to species level by sequence analysis of the
16S rRNA gene. Most species within the genus Campylobacter can be successfully differentiated by sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. However, C. jejuni, C. coli and
C. lari have been more difficult to differentiate by such
sequence analysis [12]. Bacterial genomes can harbour up
to 15 rRNA operons and the sequences of the corresponding genes are not always identical, which can make it difficult to interpret sequence data [13]. The nucleotide
substitutions between different genes within a gene family
are referred to as polymorphisms. Sequence differences
can also occur between homologous genes from different
strains of a certain bacterial species. All these nucleotide
substitutions are collectively referred to as intraspecific
variation. It has previously been reported that C. jejuni has
three copies of the 16S rRNA gene in the genome [14,15].
One aim of our study was to establish if sequence differences exist between the three genes in a certain Campylobacter jejuni strain, because if intraspecific variation exists
in these genes it may be possible to use the method for
subtyping [16,17]. In a previous study of Campylobacter
spp. from broilers in Sweden, 390 isolates were analysed
by PFGE [18]. After digestion with SmaI, almost 80 different banding patterns (SmaI types) were obtained, including isolates that could not be digested with SmaI. Some of

http://www.actavetscand.com/content/50/1/10

the subtypes were isolated more frequently than others.
Another aim of the present study was to determine the
sequence variation in the 16S rRNA genes of different
Campylobacter jejuni strains and to determine whether the
16S rRNA sequence types correlated to the SmaI types.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
All bacterial strains were isolated from cloacal samples
collected at slaughter within the Swedish Campylobacter
programmes. The origins of the 47 strains (producer and
slaughterhouse) are given in Table 1. The strains were isolated from different flocks delivered by 21 broiler producers to 6 different slaughterhouses during two periods,
1995–1997 and 2002–2004. First, two strains from each
of the 10 most common SmaI types reported within the
Campylobacter program in Sweden 2002–2004 were
selected. Then eight new strains found at least four times
in a previous Swedish study [18] were also selected for
analysis. The selection was based on the SmaI profiles, and
the profiles of these strains were similar to those of the 10
most common SmaI types. The 19 strains from 1995–
1997 (Table 1) were chosen from the same producers as
those from 2002–2004, which are known to frequently
deliver Campylobacter-positive broilers [19]. The SmaI profiles are numbered according to previous studies in Sweden [18].

Procedures for sampling, transport and laboratory analyses have been described previously [19]. Identification of
Campylobacter spp. was based on colony morphology,
microscopic appearance and the following phenotypic
characteristics: motility, production of cytochrome C oxidase and catalase, and the hippurate hydrolysis reaction
[20]. One colony from each positive sample was stored in
glycerol broth (15% glycerol and 85% serum broth) at 70°C before further use.
Genotyping of selected strains by PCR/REA and PFGE
Species identification of C. jejuni was initially based on a
positive hippurate hydrolysis reaction. Isolates that gave a
weak or negative hippurate reaction were speciated by the
polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction
enzyme analysis (PCR/REA) by which C. jejuni, C. coli, C.
lari, and C. upsaliensis can be identified and differentiated
[21]. In addition, some strains were tested by PCR for the
hippuricase gene [22].

Genetic subtyping of C. jejuni isolates was performed by
pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in accordance with
the standardised Campynet procedure [23]. Genomic
DNA was digested with SmaI and the fragments were separated by PFGE in a CHEF-DRII apparatus (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The PFGE banding patterns

were analysed by computer-assisted identification with
GelCompar II (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium).

Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes
DNA was prepared from the bacteria by lysis of 1–3 colonies in 100 µl of water at 100°C for 10 min. The lysate was
used as a template for in vitro amplification of the 16S
rRNA genes by PCR. The PCR products were used for cycle

sequencing with fluorescently labelled terminators (Big
Dye; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA) as
described by the manufacturer and with a set of sequencing primers developed for members of the phylum Proteobacteria [24]. The sequencing products were analysed by
capillary electrophoresis on an ABI Prism 3100 genetic
analyser (Applied Biosystems). Contiguous sequences
(contigs) were generated by using the program Contig
Express included in the Vector NTI Suite (InforMax,
Bethesda, Md., USA). The contigs were checked and edited
manually if necessary before phylogenetic analysis and
deposition in GenBank. The accession numbers for the
sequences in GenBank are given in Table 1.
Phylogenetic analysis
The 16S rRNA sequences determined in this work were
aligned manually with prealigned sequences retrieved
from the Ribosomal Database Project II [25] and by using
the Genetic Data Environment software [26]. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbour-joining [27]
from a distance matrix that was corrected for multiple substitutions at single locations by the two-parameter
method [28]. The distance matrix comprised 1417 nucleotide positions corresponding to positions 36 to 1472 in
the 16S rRNA sequence of Escherichia coli.

http://www.actavetscand.com/content/50/1/10

The sequence similarities among C. jejuni strains and
among C. coli strains were in the range 99.5–99.9% and
98.2–99.9%, respectively. Whole genome sequences are
available for four of the C. jejuni strains (accession numbers, CP000025, AL111168, CP000814 and CP000538).
Whole genome sequence data show that the genomes of
Campylobacter jejuni strains harbour three rRNA operons
and we found that the sequences of the three 16S rRNA
genes were identical within each individual strain for all
47 strains. Furthermore, the three 16S rRNA genes of C.
doylei (CP000768) are also identical. The nine profiles
occurred with varying frequencies among the 47 strains
analysed here. Three 16S rRNA sequence types (b, e and h)
dominated and constituted 79% (37 of 47 strains). The
number of nucleotide substitutions varied between one
and six among the nine 16S rRNA sequence types. The
largest difference was found between the 16S rRNA
sequence types f and i (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, five of the
sequence types (b, d, e, h and i) had identical 16S rRNA
sequence profiles to strains retrieved from GenBank.
Sequence type (e) was shared between 12 of the strains in
our study and two of these were identified as C. coli by
PCR/REA. These strains had an identical 16S rRNA profile
to C. jejuni (CP000025), for which the whole genome
sequence is available, and also to one strain of C. coli
(AF550623).

Results
Identification of the isolates
Forty-five of the 47 strains included in this study were
identified as Campylobacter jejuni by a positive hippurate
hydrolysis reaction or by PCR/REA or by the presence of
the hippuricase gene as judged from PCR. Two strains
were identified as C. coli (8693/04 and 11318/04) by the
same methods. All isolates were identified as representing
either C. jejuni or C. coli by 16S rRNA sequence analysis.
Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA genes
The length of the 16S rRNA gene fragments of the
sequenced Campylobacter isolates was 1417 nucleotides.
Ambiguities were not found in any of the sequences,
which showed that there were no sequence polymorphisms in the three 16S rRNA genes. However, nucleotide
substitutions were found in eight positions of the strains
sequenced in the present study, which resulted in nine different 16S rRNA sequence types, referred to as a-i in Tables
1, 2 and 3. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA
genes of the 47 strains were determined and compared
with 16S rRNA sequences of 21 strains of C. jejuni, 2
strains of C. doylei, one strain each of C. lari and C. upsaliensis and 16 strains of C. coli retrieved from RDP-II (Table
2). Nine additional positions that were variable were
identified in the sequences deposited by other authors
(Table 3). The Swedish strains were not variable in these
positions. The sequence similarities between the nine different sequence types (a-i) were in the range 99.6–99.9%.

Phylogenetic analysis
The strains in the present study were grouped into two
major clusters in the radial tree (Fig. 1). The first cluster
comprised sequence types a, b, c, d, g and i and contained
sequence types of C. jejuni retrieved from GenBank (Fig.
2). The sequence types a, b, c, g and i had the nucleotides
A, A and T in the positions 814, 986 and 995, respectively,
whereas sequence type d had a G in the first of these positions (Table 3). The SmaI types in this group were 2, 3, 4,
10, 15, 36, 42 and 56. The second cluster comprised
sequence types e, f and h and contained both C. coli and
C. jejuni. These strains are characterised by having G, T,
and A in nucleotide positions 814, 986 and 995, respectively (Table 3). The corresponding SmaI types in this
group were 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 20, 26, 57, 67, 70, 101 and
102.

Phylogenetic relationships of the nine 16S rRNA sequence
types obtained in the present study and certain strains of
C. jejuni, C. coli, C. doylei, C. lari and C. upsaliensis reported
by other authors are shown in Fig. 2. The taxa in this tree
form four clusters (1–4) and one single species line (C.
coli, DQ174137). However, due to the high-sequence similarity, the nodes are not very stable and sequencing errors
in some of the older sequences may well affect the topology of the tree. Cluster 1 contains only C. jejuni and C. doylei strains. Cluster 2 contains both C. jejuni and C. coli
strains, while clusters 3 and 4 contain only C. coli strains.

The 47 strains were subtyped into 22 different SmaI types,
including the strains refractory to SmaI digestion (designated SmaI type 10). Of the 22 SmaI types, 11 were found
only once, and the remaining 11 subtypes were found at

least twice (Fig. 3). The subtype that was most often
observed was SmaI type 2 (11 isolates) and this was also a
subtype that was widely spread among producers, slaughterhouses and years. No correlation could be found
between the different 16S rRNA sequences or SmaI types
and the year, slaughterhouse or farm from which the
Campylobacter strain had been isolated. Strains with the
same SmaI type but of different sequence types appeared
only in one the two phylogenetic clusters (Fig 1).

*Positions where some of the C. jejuni 16S rRNA sequences deposited in GenBank by other authors differed from the sequences determined in
this study
The nucleotide positions were numbered according to one of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168, for which the whole
genome sequence is available from GenBank. However, the 16S rRNA sequence was retrieved from RDP-II [29].

Discussion
Genomes of C. jejuni and C. coli only harbour three copies
of the 16S rRNA genes, whereas E. coli has seven rRNA
genomic loci [14,29,30]. The three 16S rRNA gene
sequences of the respective 47 strains included in the
study were identical as judged from the sequence raw
data, which would have revealed any polymorphism. This
finding was surprising because bacteria with more than
one rRNA operon often have at least a few polymorphisms in their 16S rRNA genes. The observation that C.
jejuni seem to lack polymorphisms in their 16S rRNA
genes is also supported by genome sequencing data,
because three of the strains (CP000025, CP000814 and
AL111168) have identical 16S rRNA genes. The third
strain (CP000538) has two deletions in one of the three
genes, but except for that, the three genes are also identical. We did not find sequence length polymorphisms and
in this respect C. jejuni is very stable. Reparation mechanisms for concerted evolution of rRNA genes seem to be
very efficient. Furthermore, the whole genome sequence
of Campylobacter doylei (CP000768) also contains three
identical 16S rRNA sequences.
It was possible to identify eight signature nucleotide positions by which the studied strains of C. jejuni could be differentiated into nine groups according to their 16S rRNA
sequences. The observed nucleotide substitutions at different positions in the 16S rRNA genes of Campylobacter
spp. were compared with the positions of the nucleotide
substitutions that appear as mutations in E. coli [31].
However, none of the nucleotide substitutions was found
at the homologous positions. Restriction analysis by SmaI
digestion and PFGE was, however, a more discriminatory
typing method, detecting 22 subtypes as compared with
nine different 16S rRNA sequence types. The discrimina-

tory power of PFGE for genotyping of Campylobacter spp.
has been reported previously [32,33]. One sequence type
(e) had identical 16S rRNA sequence as one of the whole
genome sequenced C. jejuni strains (RM1221) and C. coli
strain (Lio8), (Table 2, Fig 2). Furthermore, sequence type
e differed in only two nucleotide positions from C. coli
(L19738). Two of the isolates (8693/04 and 11318/04)
belonging to16S rRNA type e were also identified as C. coli
by PCR/REA. This observation shows that phylogenetic
analysis based on 16S rRNA cannot always be used to differentiate between C. jejuni and C. coli, although in cluster
3 (Fig. 2), three of the C. coli sequences are significantly
different from the C. jejuni sequences. However, the
results must be interpreted with care, because sequences
of many mistyped bacterial strains have been deposited in
GenBank. The results in the present study confirm the limitations of the 16S rRNA gene for resolving close, relationships.
The common SmaI types identified in Swedish broilers in
2002–2004 were also found among isolates from 1995–
1997, a fact that indicates that these common types are
also stable over time. Furthermore, the whole genome
sequenced C. jejuni (CP000025) with an identical profile
to sequence type e originates from chickens in the USA
[34]. This raises the question whether certain clones are
more common than others and whether those clones have
a higher ability to survive in the environment around the
broilers or within animals around the broiler houses over
a very long time. Bacteria with relatively small genomes,
such as C. jejuni, may undergo genetic variation to
increase their potential to adapt to new environments
[14]. Such genotypic variation could result in phenotypic
changes. These variations are probably important in the

transmission route from broiler to man, where Campylobacter spp. must survive several hostile environments.

Conclusion
Bacterial genomes could harbour up to fifteen 16S rRNA
operons. Polymorphisms in the 16S rRNA gene are common in bacteria with more than one 16S rRNA operon.
Genomes of Campylobacter spp. harbour three copies of
the 16S rRNA genes. Polymorphisms were not found in
the 16S rRNA genes from any of the 47 Campylobacter spp.
strains sequenced. The three rRNA operons in the analysed Campylobacter jejuni strains were identical within
each individual strain for all 47 strains, which indicates
that C. jejuni and C. coli are very stable in this respect.

Genotyping of 47 strains by 16S rRNA gene sequencing
resulted in nine sequence types, whereas PFGE after digestion with SmaI resulted in 22 subtypes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences is not always sufficient
for differentiation between C. jejuni and C. coli. A potential correlation was found between the SmaI profiles and
the 16S rRNA sequences, as a certain SmaI type only
appeared in one of the two major phylogenetic groups.
