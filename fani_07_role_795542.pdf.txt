Abstract
Background: Histidine biosynthesis is one of the best characterized anabolic pathways. There is
a large body of genetic and biochemical information available, including operon structure, gene
expression, and increasingly larger sequence databases. For over forty years this pathway has been
the subject of extensive studies, mainly in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, in both of which
details of histidine biosynthesis appear to be identical. In these two enterobacteria the pathway is
unbranched, includes a number of unusual reactions, and consists of nine intermediates; his genes
are arranged in a compact operon (hisGDC [NB]HAF [IE]), with three of them (hisNB, hisD and hisIE)
coding for bifunctional enzymes. We performed a detailed analysis of his gene fusions in available
genomes to understand the role of gene fusions in shaping this pathway.
Results: The analysis of HisA structures revealed that several gene elongation events are at the
root of this protein family: internal duplication have been identified by structural superposition of
the modules composing the TIM-barrel protein.
Several his gene fusions happened in distinct taxonomic lineages; hisNB originated within γproteobacteria and after its appearance it was transferred to Campylobacter species (εproteobacteria) and to some Bacteria belonging to the CFB group. The transfer involved the entire
his operon. The hisIE gene fusion was found in several taxonomic lineages and our results suggest
that it probably happened several times in distinct lineages.
Gene fusions involving hisIE and hisD genes (HIS4) and hisH and hisF genes (HIS7) took place in the
Eukarya domain; the latter has been transferred to some δ-proteobacteria.
Conclusion: Gene duplication is the most widely known mechanism responsible for the origin and
evolution of metabolic pathways; however, several other mechanisms might concur in the process
of pathway assembly and gene fusion appeared to be one of the most important and common.

Background
Histidine biosynthesis is one of the best characterized
anabolic pathways. There is a large body of genetic and
biochemical information available, mainly for Escherichia
coli and Salmonella enterica, including operon structure,
gene expression, and growing sequence data [1]. In these
two enterobacteria, the pathway is the same, unbranched,
includes a number of unusual reactions, and consists of
nine intermediates; his genes are arranged in a compact
operon (hisGDC [NB]HAF [IE]), with three of them
(hisNB, hisD and hisIE) coding for bifunctional enzymes
(Figure 1) [2,3].
Histidine biosynthesis is a metabolic cross-road and plays
an important role in cellular metabolism being interconnected to both the de novo synthesis of purines and to
nitrogen metabolism. The connection to purine biosynthesis results from an enzymatic step catalyzed by imidazole glycerol phosphate (IGP) synthase, a heterodimeric

protein composed by one subunit each of the hisH and
hisF products [2]. This heterodimeric enzyme catalyzes the
transformation of N'-(5'-phosphoribosyl)-formimino-5aminoimidazol-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (PRFAR)
into 5'-(5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide) ribonucleotide (AICAR), which is recycled into the de novo purine
biosynthetic pathway, and IGP, which leads to histidine.
The important connection to nitrogen metabolism is due
to a glutamine molecule, the source of the final nitrogen
atom of the imidazole ring of IGP. Chemical and biological evidences suggest that histidine was formed during the
long period of chemical abiotic synthesis of organic compounds and the monophyly of the three cell domains in
phylogenetic trees of concatenated His proteins, suggests
that this biosynthetic route is ancient. The chemical syntheses of histidine [4], prebiotic analogues of histidine
[5], and of histidyl-histidine under primitive conditions
has been reported [6], as well as the role of the latter in the
enhancement of some possible prebiotic oligomerization

reactions involving amino acids [7] and nucleotides [8]. It
is therefore reasonable to assume that His-containing
small peptides could have been involved in the prebiotic
formation of other peptides and nucleic acid molecules,
once these monomers accumulated in primitive tidal
lagoons or ponds. If primitive catalysts required histidine,
then the eventual exhaustion of the prebiotic supply of
histidine and histidine-containing peptides [4,6,8]
imposed a selective pressure favoring those organisms
capable of synthesizing histidine. Hence this metabolic
pathway might have been assembled long before the
appearance of the Last Universal Common Ancestor
(LUCA) and the wet-lab and bioinformatics work carried
out by our group in the last 15 years strongly supported
this thesis [2,9-14]. A wide variety of clustering strategies
of his genes have been documented [10]; moreover, an
impressive series of well characterized duplication, elongation, and fusion events has shaped this pathway. Therefore, the histidine biosynthetic pathway represents a very
good model for understanding the molecular mechanisms driving the assembly and refining of metabolic
routes.
It is worth noting that at least seven genes, namely hisD,
hisB, hisN, hisI, hisE, hisF, and hisH underwent fusion
events in different phylogenetic lineages [11-13,15]. Gene
fusions provide a mechanism for the physical association
of different protein domains that might be catalytic or regulatory [16]. Moreover, fusions frequently involve genes
coding for proteins that function in a concerted manner,
such as enzymes catalyzing sequential steps within a metabolic pathway [17]. Fusion of such catalytic centers likely
facilitates the channeling of intermediates [16]; the high
fitness of gene fusions can also rely on the tight regulation
of the expression of the fused domains.
Besides, a special case of gene fusion has played a key role
in the evolution of ancestral genes: several proteins have
been shown to be the outcome of coupled "duplication
and fusion" events (gene elongation). The outcome of
such an event is a gene with two paralogous moieties
(modules) that might undergo further duplication events,
leading to a gene with several internal repetitions. Gene
elongation events allow improving a protein's function by
increasing the number of active sites and/or the acquisition of an additional function by modifying a redundant
segment. The most documented example pertains two his
genes, hisA and hisF, encoding two (β/α)8 barrel (TIM-barrel) proteins [18].
The aim of this work is to evaluate the overall role that
gene fusion(s) might have had in the context of the assembly and evolution of histidine biosynthetic route, and to
understand the biological significance of each fusion. For
this purpose, the structure and organization of all the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S4

available his genes that underwent fusion event(s) were
analyzed using statistical and bioinformatics methods.

Results and discussion
A cascade of gene elongations and duplications: hisA and
hisF
The two genes hisA and hisF code for a [N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)
formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
ribonucleotide (ProFAR) isomerase and a cyclase, respectively, which catalyze two central and sequential reactions
(the fourth and fifth ones) of the pathway (Figure 1) and
belong to the TIM-barrel family of proteins. The comparative analysis of the HisA and HisF proteins from different
archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic (micro)organisms
revealed that they are paralogous and share a similar internal organization into two paralogous modules half the
size of the entire sequence [18]. Comparison of these
modules led to the suggestion that hisA and hisF are the
result of two ancient successive duplications, the first one
involving an ancestral module half the size of the presentday hisA gene and leading (by a gene elongation event) to
the ancestral hisA gene, which in turn underwent a duplication that gave rise to the ancestor of hisF [18].

The barrel structure is composed by eight concatenated
(β-strand)-loop-(α-helix) units. The β-strands are located
in the interior of the protein, forming the staves of a barrel, whereas the α-helices pack around them facing the
exterior. According to the model proposed [18,19] the
ancestral half-barrel gave a functional enzyme by homodimerization. The elongation event leading to the ancestor of hisA/hisF genes resulted in the covalent fusion of
two half-barrels producing a protein whose function was
refined and optimized by mutational changes; once
assembled, the "whole-barrel gene" underwent gene
duplication, leading to the ancestor of hisA and hisF
[18,19].
The structural symmetry of the TIM barrel has prompted
us to investigate the possibility of an even older gene elongation event involving (β/α)-mers smaller than the (β/α)4
units of the ancestral "half-barrel" precursor. To this purpose an extensive analysis of all the available HisA and
HisF sequences was carried out. This analysis was performed by splitting each HisA sequence into four modules
(HisA1-HisA4) following secondary structures succession
in the corresponding protein from Thermotoga maritima,
whose three-dimensional structure is available (we will
refer to these four regions as the "quarters"). The alignments concerning Methanocaldococcus jannaschii are
shown in Figure 2 (identity and similarity values are in
Table 1). The degree of sequence similarity is not very high
but it might be used to support an evolutionary model
suggesting that the present day situation could have been
reached after two gene elongation events, each one dou-

bling the length of the ancestral gene and the number of
(β/α)-modules in the product. Thus the HisA TIM-barrel
would be the result of a cascade of two consecutive gene
elongations (Figure 3). This model is supported by the
structures shown in Figure 3 (upper left panel). We used
the T. maritima HisA structure (1Q02) to obtain the coordinates of each atom composing the "quarters" of barrel
and then performed a structural superposition using swiss
PDB viewer. Lang et al., [19] compared the structure of the
two HisA half-barrels and obtained a root-mean-square

deviation (rms) ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 Å using all main
chain, non hydrogen atoms. Our results concerning
"quarters" structural superpositions showed for the first
and the second quarters an average rms of 1.21 Å using all
alpha carbons, strongly supporting the model proposed.
We showed examples from these two organism, because
M. jannaschii with several other Archaea showed the best
overall degree of conservation of internal repetitions,
while the choice of T. maritima followed the availability of
HisA tridimensional structure [19].

Identity (upper diagonal) and similarity percentages calculated for the alignments shown in Figure 2.

The symmetry of the TIM-barrel structure suggests to test
a further ancestral duplication in which the original gene
coded for a single (β/α)-module, capable of forming a
homo-octamer to form a complete barrel. Although the
alignments constructed from the eight single (β/α)-modules are very short, they still contain a non negligible
amount of sequence and secondary structure similarities
not expected from random distribution of amino acids
and by visual comparison of their structure is in agreement with this hypothesis (Figure 3, lower left panel).

Thereby, the ancestral forms of life might have expanded
their coding abilities and their genomes by duplicating a
small number of mini-genes, i.e. the "starter types". We
are completely aware that the evidence of the ancient
duplications involving an ancestral mini-gene encoding
the "quarter" of barrel and the single (β/α)-module is
based on very limited amount of sequence and structural
similarities; in spite of this, in our opinion, the hypothesis
mentioned above remains valid. Moreover, further studies
are needed to clarify the presence of these additional gene

elongation events and to integrate them into a more general picture of the evolution of the very diversified TIMbarrel family of proteins.
The hisNB fusion
The eighth and sixth steps of histidine biosynthesis are
catalyzed by histidinol-phosphate phosphatase (EC
3.1.3.15) (HOL-Pase) and IGP dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.19),
respectively [1]. Distinct HOL-Pases have been characterized in different organisms, whereas IGP dehydratase is
the same in all known histidine synthesizing organisms.
In E. coli the two activities are coded for by a single gene,
referred to as hisNB [11]: the N-terminal domain (HisN)
is a phosphatase belonging to the DDDD family [11] and
the C-terminal domain is responsible for IGP dehydratase
activity. The evolutionary history of the hisNB gene has
been recently reported by [11] who showed that hisNB
gene fusions are present in most γ-proteobacteria and in

the ε-proteobacterium Campylobacter jejuni; phylogenetic
analysis allowed to trace the fusion event in an ancestor of
the γ-subdivision and its later horizontal transfer to C.
jejuni. Moreover, hisN is paralogous to gmhB (E. coli
nomenclature), catalyzing the dephosphorylation of D-αD-heptose 1,7-PP for surface Lipopolysaccharide production [20,21].
Since the former hisNB evolutionary model was based on
a limited number of genomes, we update it including all
available genomes (April, 1: 41 Archaea, 759 Bacteria and
135 Eukarya).
By combining results obtained with several queries, we
retrieved 131 orthologous bifunctional HisNB sequences:
104 come from γ-proteobacteria, 9 from ε-proteobacteria,
1 to a α-proteobacterium and 17 from the CFB group
(Table 2 and Additional file 1). No archaeal and eukaryo-

Organisms (groups) in red are bacteria not belonging to γproteobacteria and harboring the HisNB fusion.

tic bifunctional sequence was retrieved although they possess genes encoding DDDD-type phosphatases, or, more
generally HAD hydrolases [11]. These data confirmed the
narrow phylogenetic distribution of the hisNB fusion,
which is mostly present in γ-proteobacteria. However, the
occurrence of a fused hisNB gene in other lineages
enlarged its distribution raising the question of the origin
of this fusion in these phyla, i.e. if it is either the outcome
of convergent evolution or a horizontal gene transfer
event (HGT). To discern between these two different scenarios, a phylogenetic analysis of HisNB sequences was
carried out. A phylogenetic tree obtained using a representative set of HisNB sequences is reported in Figure 4,
which shows that HisNB sequences from α- and ε-proteobacteria, and CFB bacteria are intermixed with γ-proteobacterial sequences and do not reflect the 16S rDNA
phylogeny. This result strongly suggests that the hisNB
gene has been horizontally transferred from some γ-proteobacteria to the other microorganisms. It is also quite
possible that the transfer event might have involved the
entire his operon or part thereof, as evidenced by phylogenetic trees of other his genes (e.g. Additional File 2). This
statement relies on the analysis of the organization of his
genes in the 131 genomes harboring the hisNB fusion,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S4

which revealed (Additional file 3) that all of them are
localized within more or less compact operons.
The hisIE fusion
The hisI and hisE genes code for a phosphoribosyl-ATP
phosphohydrolase and a phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase that are responsible for the third and second steps
in histidine biosynthesis, respectively. In E. coli and S.
enterica the two genes are fused to form the last gene of the
his operon (Figure 1).

The phylogenetic distribution of hisIE genes was obtained
by retrieving homologous sequences using the E. coli
HisIE amino acid sequence as a query to probe genome
database. The data are reported in Table 2 and can be summarized as follows (see also Additional file 4):
1. The hisIE fusion is not universally distributed;
2. Bifunctional hisIE genes were found in all eukaryotes
(see section regarding HIS4);
3. Most of the archaeal genomes harbor monofunctional
hisI and hisE genes; the occurrence of hisIE in Thermococci
and Thermoplasmata is very likely the outcome of a HGT
event from a bacterium donor [15]. Moreover, when the
hisI and hisE genes are not fused in Archaea, they do not
belong to operons and are separated on the chromosome.
The only exceptions are represented by Sulfolobus species,
where the two genes are in a compact operon but separated by the hisH gene;
4. The hisIE gene fusion is present in 100% of the histidine
producing organisms belonging to Aquificae, Deinococci,
Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Thermotogae. Moreover, a bifunctional hisIE gene was found in all γ-proteobacteria that branched off after the separation of
Pseudomonadales from the main branch. The presence of
the fusion in ε-proteobacteria can be explained by means
of a HGT of the entire operon [13] from γ-proteobacteria;
the same appears to be true for Bacteria belonging to the
CFB group and possessing the hisNB gene fusion (see the
corresponding paragraph). In spite of the high number of
genomes sequenced (39), no hisIE fusion was found in βproteobacteria, which represent the key-point for the
compacting of his genes during the construction of proteobacterial his operon [13].
5. Firmicutes show a complex scenario: we have found
fused and stand-alone genes in very closely related species
of Bacillus (i.e. Bacillus subtilis possesses the gene fusion
while B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis do not; in these cases
hisI and hisE are contiguous and very close on the chromosome); the same is true for Clostridia. The presence of the
fusion in model organisms such as Bacillus subtilis but not

in some of the recently sequenced genomes of the same
genus suggests that sequencing artifacts, probably favored
by the gene organization of these two genes, might
explain this situation.
6. Actinobacteria lack this gene fusion.
7. Apparently there is no correlation between the occurrence of hisIE fusion and his genes organization. However,
it is interesting that during Proteobacteria evolution, we
witness a progressive approaching of two initially far hisI
and hisE cistrons, starting from δ- and ε-proteobacteria.
The distance between them decreases in bacteria belonging to the α-branch; then, they partially overlap in β-proteobacteria, a molecular event which is coincident with
the formation of a complete his operon, which very often
includes genes apparently not involved in histidine biosynthesis. Finally, the two genes fused in the ancestor of γproteobacteria, where the compactness of his operon is
very high [13].
Despite of the proposed HGTs, the current phylogenetic
distribution of the HisIE bifunctional enzyme evokes a
scenario of convergent evolution and independent gene
fusions/splitting of the two cistrons in different lineages.
However, phylogenetic analyses are not of great help to
confirm this view (data not shown) because these proteins are very short (less than 100 residues each) and the
informative sites in a multialignment of sequences coming from complete genomes are extremely reduced bringing to unreliable trees (i.e. very low bootstrap support, star
topologies, data not shown). On a different perspective,
the analysis of the linker region connecting the two
domains might help in understanding the evolutionary
history of these fusions, but we have found that they are
very short, giving no information on this issue (data not
shown). If the idea on convergent evolution of these gene
fusions will hold future works, it might turn out that there
is a strong selective pressure favoring their appearance in
different lineages. Lastly, the finding that the gene order in
all the bifunctional genes is always hisI, hisE, suggests that
a different arrangement of the two domains should be disadvantageous for the enzymatic activity and that structural and/or functional constraints might be responsible
for the extant arrangement.
From metabolons to multifunctional enzymes: the
eukaryotic HIS7 and HIS4 fusions
Two fusions involving his genes were disclosed in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae: HIS7, corresponding to the bacterial hisH and hisF genes [12], and HIS4. The latter gene
codes for a tetrafunctional enzyme consisting of about
800 residues and containing three regions homologous to
the prokaryotic hisI, hisE and hisD genes, arranged in this
order in the yeast gene, whose products perform the sec-

ond, the third and the last two steps of histidine biosynthesis, respectively.
The IGP synthase coding gene: HIS7
The bifunctional enzyme IGP synthase catalyzes the fifth
step of histidine biosynthesis, generating the imidazole
ring of the histidine precursor, IGP. The overall reaction is
the conversion of PRFAR to IGP and AICAR [2] via a
glutamine molecule, and with no free intermediate (Figure 1). This represents the central step of the pathway,
which connects histidine biosynthesis to nitrogen metabolism and the de novo synthesis of purines, through
AICAR. The active form of the E. coli IGP synthase is a heterodimer of the hisH and hisF products i.e. a glutamine
amidotransferase (GAT) and a cyclase, respectively [22].
The requirement for a direct interaction between GAT and
the cyclase was confirmed by the discovery of the structure
of the S. cerevisiae HIS7 gene coding for IGP synthase [23];
the analysis of the encoded enzyme demonstrated that it
is constituted by two domains, an N-terminal and a C-terminal one, sharing a high degree of sequence similarity
with known HisH and HisF, respectively. Previous works
suggested that the eukaryotic HIS7 gene is the outcome of
a fusion event involving two monofunctional, bacteriallike genes [12]. According to the model proposed, the
eukaryotic lineage inherited two monofunctional genes,
hisH and hisF, that underwent gene fusion. The alternative
scenario, that is the possibility of a HGT event from a
prokaryote harboring a fused hisHF gene to eukaryotes
was excluded on the basis of the absence of the HisHF
fusion in prokaryotes. However, the increasing number of
sequence in databases opens the possibility to modify this
model. To this purpose the S. cerevisiae HIS7 aminoacid
sequence was used in a BLASTP search [24], allowing to
retrieve 21 bifunctional sequences. Whilst most (18)
come from Eukarya, three of them belonged to two δ-proteobacteria, raising the possibility that the bacterial and
the eukaryotic HisHF sequences share a common ancestry, even though a phenomenon of convergent evolution
could not be ruled out. Thus, all the available HisHF
bifunctional sequences and a set of bacterial and archaeal
concatenated HisH and HisF sequences were aligned
using the program ClustalW [25]. The multialignment
(partially shown in Figure 5) allowed to detect several
conserved insertions that distinguish bifunctional proteins. This speaks towards a common origin of the eukaryotic and bacterial hisHF genes rather than a phenomenon
of convergent evolution. The phylogenetic tree obtained
using the above mentioned multialignment showed in
Figure 6 supports this view: it can be splitted into two
main clusters, one containing all the monofunctional
sequences including the one coming from the δ-proteobacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens, the second one comprising all the bifunctional eukaryotic and bacterial
sequences; the three bifunctional bacterial sequences clus-

the eukaryotic sequences listed in Table 3 and revealed
that the two sequences used as queries retrieved two identical sequences, with the exception of Aspergillus nidulans
(where an additional protein with a putative HisD function was retrieved), Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Plants,
where genes corresponding to the prokaryotic hisIE and
hisD counterparts were detected.
A multialignment of all the retrieved sequences with a representative set of archaeal and bacterial HisIE and HisD
sequences (Additional file 5) revealed that the HIS4-like
genes can be subdivided into four portions (Figure 7): i)
an N-terminal region of variable length, followed by ii)
the hisIE moiety, which in turn precedes iii) a linker
region of variable sequence and length connecting the
hisIE region to the last domain, iv) the hisD region. Plants
sequences have an N-terminal region which is unrelated
to any histidine biosynthetic enzymes and that might represent a signal sequence for chloroplast localization, an
idea which is in agreement with a (at least partial) compartmentalization of histidine biosynthesis into these
organelles, as previously suggested [28]. A similar search
performed on prokaryotic databases did not allow retrieving any HIS4-like protein.

A tetrafunctional gene: HIS4
The S. cerevisiae HIS4 gene codes for a tetrafunctional
enzyme and consists of three regions sharing a high
degree of sequence similarity with prokaryotic HisI, HisE,
and HisD, thus the activities performed by the HIS4
enzyme are, from the N-terminal end, a phosphoribosylATP pyrophosphohydrolase, a phosphoribosyl-AMP
cyclohydrolase and the two-step histidinol dehydrogenase. The first one (HisI) uses N'-5'-phosphoribosyl-ATP
(PR-ATP) to produce N'-5'-phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP), whose purine ring is subsequently opened by the
second (HisE) to give 5'-ProFAR. This compound, in turn,
undergoes seven additional enzymatic reactions leading
to histidine, the last two of which are catalyzed by histidinol-dehydrogenase (HisD) (Figure 1) i.e. the double oxidation of histidinol to histidine, through the intermediate
histidinal, concomitant to the reduction of two NAD+
molecules, with a Bi-Uni-Uni-Bi kinetic mechanism
[26,27].

Analysis of the HIS4 N-terminal region
The fungal HIS4 sequences have an N-terminal domain
(whose length ranges from 160 to 220 residues) that is
much longer than that found in HisIE from Plants; moreover, we detected no significant homology neither with
the signal sequence found in Plants nor with any other
signal sequence of Fungi or other organisms (data not
shown). This sequence has no known conserved domains,
as appeared by the absence of hits in the Conserved
Domain Database (data not shown). Moreover, a psi-blast
search did not permit to obtain any statistically significant
hit, if we exclude other HIS4 proteins (data not shown).
However, both the presence of the corresponding
sequence in mRNAs (see GenBank entry NM_212387.1
from Ashbya gossypii) and the molecular weight of the isolated S. cerevisiae HIS4 enzyme (95000 ± 500 Da) [29]
speak toward the presence of this N-terminal sequence in
the "final polypeptide". A structural rather than a catalytic
role of this region can be suggested on the basis of alignment of the isolated N-terminal regions of the fungal
HIS4 enzymes, which revealed that the degree of sequence
similarity between them is quite low and significantly less
than that shared by catalytic domains (Additional file 6
and 7).

Sequence retrieval and hisI, hisE and hisD gene structure in Eukarya
The eukaryotic complete genomes database of protein
sequences was probed using the HisIE and HisD domains
of the S. cerevisiae HIS4 enzyme (residues 134–329 and
351–795, respectively). The BLASTP [24] search returned

Phylogenetic analyses
A phylogenetic analysis was performed to check whether
HisIE and HisD proteins/domains listed in Table 3 experienced the same evolutionary history and whether the
phylogenetic trees were congruent with the phylogeny of

tered with Plants sequences. This body of data suggests
that a bifunctional hisHF gene might have been transferred from Plants to some δ-proteobacteria.

and the phylogenetic trees reported in Figures 7 suggest a
HIS4 gene fission event rather than its primary absence.
Moreover, the fission yeast belongs to the Ascomycota, all
of which possess the canonical S. cerevisiae-like HIS4
enzyme, and the same (Table 3) is true for species which
branch off earlier from the fungal lineage (as the Basidiomycota Cryptococcus neoformans and other).

Eukarya based on other molecular markers, such as 18S
rDNA. According to the eukaryotic phylogeny based on
18S rDNA [30] Viridiplantae branched off from the major
eukaryotic line earlier than Fungi, that represent a sister
group of Metazoa. Moreover, within Fungi, Basidiomycota appear to branch off earlier than Ascomycota; the latter are rooted by Archiascomycotina, including
Schizosaccharomycetes. However, discordant phylogenies
have been obtained using different sequences and this
might be mainly due to HGTs or to the transfer of organellar genes to the nucleus [31,32]. The analysis of the HisD
phylogenetic tree obtained using all the available eukaryotic sequences with their prokaryotic counterparts
revealed that it is consistent with the eukaryotic species
phylogeny and supported by very high bootstrap values
(Figure 8a), suggesting a vertical inheritance for hisD in
Fungi and Plants. The phylogenetic analyses also revealed
that the second Aspergillus nidulans hisD gene has been
acquired from a prokaryote, probably a Cyanobacterium.
The interpretation of the phylogenetic tree obtained using
the HisIE sequences is quite different (Figure 8b): two distinct clusters can be recognized, the first one comprising
sequences from Fungi, and the second one including
prokaryotic and Plants sequences. HisIE from Fungi now
is separated from Plants, and Eukarya are not monophyletic. A possible explanation is that hisIE genes of
Fungi and Plants have not been vertically inherited from a
common ancestor; however HisIE proteins often gave rise
to 'strange' phylogenetic trees for their short length.
Concerning the splitting of the two moieties (HisIE and
HisD) in S. pombe, the presence of the N-terminal
unknown sequence in the hisIE gene product (Table 3)

An evolutionary model for the origin and evolution of HIS4 gene
A possible evolutionary model for the origin and evolution of HIS4 predicts that (at least) one copy of hisD was
donated from prokaryotes to the ancestor of Eukarya and
this sequence was vertically inherited by Fungi and Plants.
Concerning hisIE, it is quite possible that the ancestor of
eukaryotes received a bifunctional hisIE gene from
prokaryotes rather than two monofunctional genes that
then underwent a gene fusion. These ideas are consistent
with both the structure of hisIE genes in known Eukarya
and with the phylogenetic trees shown in Figure 8. However, the ancestor of Fungi and Plants might have received
the HisIE gene from different prokaryotes, as shown by
the HisIE phylogenetic tree (Additional file 8). After the
divergence of Fungi from Plants the fusion between the
two bifunctional genes (hisIE and hisD) occurred in Fungi
leading to the extant HIS4 tetrafunctional gene, which was
maintained during the evolution with the exception of S.
pombe, where it was split.

Conclusion
In this paper we have analyzed the fusions involving histidine biosynthetic genes. At least eight out of ten his
genes, i.e., hisA, B, D, E, F, H, I, and N underwent different
fusion events strongly supporting a major role of this
mechanism in both the assembly and evolution of histidine biosynthesis. Each of the five his fusions detected so
far, i.e. hisA/hisF, hisIE, hisHF (HIS7), hisNB, and hisIED
(HIS4) has been analyzed for: i) gene structure, ii) phylogenetic distribution, iii) timing of appearance, iv) horizontal gene transfer, v) correlation with gene
organization, and vi) biological significance. Our results
might be summarized as follows:
1. The only "universal" gene fusion concerns hisA and hisF
genes, which are the outcome of a cascade of (at least) two
gene elongation events followed by a paralogous gene
duplication. The structure of hisA and hisF, that is the presence of two paralogous modules half the size of the entire
gene, is the same in all histidine-synthesizing organisms
and no correlation with his genes organization exists, in
the sense that the two genes maintain the same structure
independently from his gene organization (complete or
partial clustering or scattering). It is also interesting that
the traces of the two elongation events are detectable at
the primary sequence level in only a few species, mainly
Archaea.

HisD and HisIE phylogenetic analysis
HisD and HisIE phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic tree obtained using a multialignment of HisD (a) and HisIE (b) proteins
and domains from HIS4 proteins and MrBayes program. Values above nodes are posterior probabilities*100 (for details on phylogenetic tree construction see Methods). See text for details.

This suggests that the two elongation events are very
ancient i.e. they date before LUCA. The analysis of the
sequence and structure of HisA and HisF depicts a likely
scenario for divergent evolution of (at least) some of the
proteins belonging to the TIM-barrel family; interestingly
HisA is the only one maintaining an almost perfect subdivision in two modules half the size of the entire gene and
sharing a high degree of sequence similarity. In other TIMbarrels, such as HisF and TrpF, the common origin of the
two halves has been obscured by point mutations and/or
larger rearrangements due to functional and/or structural
constraints. Therefore it is possible that HisA might
resembles the ancestral TIM-barrel enzyme. By structural
comparisons of fragments of the T. maritima HisA protein
we obtained indications on the paralogy between quarters
of the barrel (each correspondingto a (β/α)2 module).
2. No fusion involving his genes has been disclosed in
Archaea, with the exception of hisIE in some Euryarchae-

ota. However, the hisIE bifunctional genes are very likely
not native of those Archaea, but are the outcome of a HGT
event involving an entire bacterial his operon [15].
3. The fusion between hisI and hisE occurred more than
once in Bacteria, speaking towards a phenomenon of convergent evolution; in many cases it has been preceded by
the progressive approaching and overlapping of the genes
(e.g. in proteobacteria). Sometimes, the fusion was concomitant with the formation of compact operons. Moreover, this gene might have been horizontally transferred.
4. The hisNB fusion is a relatively recent evolutionary
event that happened in the ε-branch of proteobacteria.
This fusion was parallel to the introgression of hisN into
an already formed and more or less compact his operon.
Once occurred, the fusion was fixed and transferred to
other proteobacteria and/or CFB group along with the
entire operon or part thereof.

5. The fusions involving hisH and hisF, hisIE and hisD
occurred in the eukaryotic lineage. Whilst the fusion leading to the tetrafunctional gene HIS4 is peculiar of eukaryotes, a hisHF fusion was found also in two bacteria,
probably as a result of a HGT from an eukaryote.
The more or less narrow phylogenetic distribution of
these fusions raises the question of the structure of his
genes in the LUCA. On the basis of the available data, we
suggest (Figure 9) that LUCA possessed all monofunctional histidine biosynthetic genes.
1

The whole body of data reported above suggests that the
fusion(s) of histidine biosynthetic genes has been driven
by different selective pressures. In the case of the elongation events leading to the extant hisA and hisF, a structural/functional significance can be invoked. Indeed, the
elongation events were very likely positively selected in
order to optimize the structure and the function of the
ancestral TIM-barrel.
The fusion of HOL-P phosphatase and IGP dehydratase
might have been selected to ensure a fixed ratio of gene
products that function in the same biochemical pathway.
Concerning the hisHF (HIS7) fusion, its biological significance is clear; whilst in prokaryotes the two proteins
encoded by hisH and hisF must interact in a 1:1 ratio to
give the active form of IGP synthase, in the eukaryotic
bifunctional protein, the two entities are fused allowing
their immediate interaction and the substrate tunnelling.
A similar "substrate channeling" and/or "fixed ratio of
gene products" might be invoked for the fusion involving
the prokaryotic hisIE genes, which code for enzymes performing consecutive steps of histidine biosynthesis.
Independently from their case-by-case biological significance, such associations might be responsible for a more
specific commitment of intermediates in a given pathway
by means of the spatial co-localization of enzymes. Operons might allow Bacteria to reach the same target: the
translation of polycistronic mRNAs favors protein-protein
interactions or the spatial segregation of a pathway.
Indeed, genes coding for interacting proteins are often
organized in operons [33]; in this context, it has been suggested that the bacterial IGP synthase might be part of a
complex metabolon whose entities are encoded by the
four genes hisBHAF, constituting the so-called "core" of
histidine biosynthesis [9,12]. Data presented here might
suggest that the polypeptides coded for by hisI, hisE, and
hisD are part of another metabolon.
This scenario can clarify the biological significance and
the evolutionary advantages of the fusion leading to the
HIS7 and HIS4 proteins and their prokaryotic counter-

parts. Indeed, the cytoplasm of a prokaryotic or eukaryotic
cell represents an extremely complex and crowded environment, where al lot of macromolecular structures might
represent an important barrier to the free diffusion of
(even small) polypeptides; it is plausible that the stochastic movement of proteins that have to interact in the bacterial cytoplasm is a rate-limiting step for a pathway. It has
been observed that the diffusion coefficient of many molecules in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is less than in
water [34]. Accordingly, the intracellular concentration of
proteins in E. coli cells has been measured to range
between 300 and 400 mg/ml ([35] and references therein)
revealing the bacterial cell interior to be a very crowded
environment. The greater the volume and complexity of
the cell the greater is the obstacle to the free diffusion of
intermediates or signal molecules inside the cell. The
problems related to the crowding of the intracellular
milieu have been proposed to be greater for eukaryotic
cells, not only for the distances an intermediate have to
override to reach a given catalytic site, but especially for
the presence of a number of physical obstacles, as the
cytoskeleton, multi-enzymatic complexes and organelles.
One of the major effects of the crowding is the reduced
mobility of molecules, an effect directly related to the
properties and the translational ray of a molecule. Moreover many of the intermediates of metabolic pathways can
be sequestered by aspecific binding to intracellular structures or be consumed by unwanted catalytic activities,
reducing the overall rate of production of the end-product
and augmenting its average energetic cost. If a similar view
is correct, and the diffusion problem is rate limiting for at
least some of the metabolic pathways performed by the
cell, then the substrate channeling can permit to bypass
the problem and the loss of intermediates by collateral
pathways, which might result in a waste of energy. In
eukaryotic cells, where the operons are absent and whose
inside is more complex than that of prokaryotes, this
obstacle might be bypassed by the fusion of functional
domains that permits an immediately active product after
the translation of a single mRNA.

Methods
Sequence retrieval
Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were obtained from
the NCBI complete genomes database. The BLASTp
option of the BLAST program [24] was used to retrieve His
proteins used in this work.
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
The ClustalW program [25] with standard parameters was
used for pairwise and multiple amino acid sequences
alignments, followed by careful visual inspection. Phylogenetic trees were obtained by using the software Mega3,
the Neighbor-Joining method [39] with 1000 bootstrap
replicates and the JTT [38] evolutionary model. We

obtained different topologies for the tree corresponding
to HIS4 domains and we compared them with those
obtained with bayesian inference, i.e. MrBayes [36]. We
defined the following parameters (not cited if default settings were used): evolutionary models of amino acid
sequences were the WAG [37] and JTT [38] with character
frequencies estimated from dataset (-F); topologies
obtained were identical for the two model; we report the
shortest trees (in both cases corresponding to the one
obtained with WAG); we used heterogeneous rates among
sites, distributed as a Gamma distribution with shape
parameter free of variate from 0 to 50 (average obtained
for these datasets 0.85); MCMC settings were as follows:
2,500,000 and 1,500,000 generations, respectively for
HisIE and HisD domains, and five chains. No starting
trees were used, with the idea in mind that convergence to
very similar values of the five chains would have been
more significant than starting each chain from the same
tree. Trees were sampled every 250 generations, for a total
set of 10,000 and 6,000 trees. Burnin was used to exclude
from following analysis those trees which were sampled
before convergence of the chains; this was assessed caseby-case by calculating average, standard deviation and
variance. Convergence was reached after about 50,000
generations (200 trees discarded). The resulting datasets
were used to obtain the shown trees with the allcompat
option.
