Abstract
Background: In animals, the biogenesis of some lipoprotein classes requires members of the
ancient large lipid transfer protein (LLTP) superfamily, including the cytosolic large subunit of
microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), vertebrate apolipoprotein B (apoB), vitellogenin
(Vtg), and insect apolipophorin II/I precursor (apoLp-II/I). In most oviparous species, Vtg, a large
glycolipoprotein, is the main egg yolk precursor protein.
Results: This report clarifies the phylogenetic relationships of LLTP superfamily members and
classifies them into three families and their related subfamilies. This means that the generic term
Vtg is no longer a functional term, but is rather based on phylogenetic/structural criteria. In
addition, we determined that the main egg yolk precursor protein of decapod crustaceans show an
overall greater sequence similarity with apoLp-II/I than other LLTP, including Vtgs. This close
association is supported by the phylogenetic analysis, i.e. neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood and
Bayesian inference methods, of conserved sequence motifs and the presence of three common
conserved domains: an N-terminal large lipid transfer module marker for LLTP, a DUF1081 domain
of unknown function in their central region exclusively shared with apoLp-II/I and apoB, and a von
Willebrand-factor type D domain at their C-terminal end. Additionally, they share a conserved
functional subtilisin-like endoprotease cleavage site with apoLp-II/I, in a similar location.
Conclusion: The structural and phylogenetic data presented indicate that the major egg yolk
precursor protein of decapod crustaceans is surprisingly closely related to insect apoLp-II/I and
vertebrate apoB and should be known as apolipocrustacein (apoCr) rather than Vtg. These LLTP
may arise from an ancient duplication event leading to paralogs of Vtg sequences. The presence of
LLTP homologs in one genome may facilitate redundancy, e.g. involvement in lipid metabolism and
as egg yolk precursor protein, and neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, e.g. involvement
in clotting cascade and immune response, of extracellular LLTP members. These protein-coding
nuclear genes may be used to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the major arthropod
groups, especially the Pancrustacea-major splits.

Background
In 1967, Wallace et al. [1] characterized a high-density
lipoprotein from decapod crustaceans ovaries with similar
biochemical properties to lipoproteins isolated from vertebrate eggs, and proposed the generic term "lipovitellin"
for this abundant lipoprotein. Two years later, Kerr [2]
identified a blood-borne protein present only in female
blue crabs Callinectes sapidus with developing oocytes.
This lipoprotein turned out to be serologically identical to
oocyte lipovitellin. The term "vitellogenin" (Vtg) was proposed over thirty-five years ago [3] to describe female-specific insect hemolymph protein precursors of egg yolk,
regardless of their amino acid sequences or structures.
This term, based on a functional criterion, was later
adopted in other egg-laying animals, including crustaceans [4], and is widely used in the scientific community
and sequence databases. Molecular characterization of Vtg
in numerous oviparous species has revealed that this high
molecular weight glycolipoprotein is conserved among
species, suggesting derivation from a common ancestor
[5-8]. However, molecular data obtained in some species
has revealed that the main egg yolk precursor proteins are
unrelated to the Vtg protein family. For example, major
egg yolk precursor protein is related to transferrin in sea
urchins [9,10] and lipase in higher Diptera [11]. Multiple
alignments of vertebrate and non-vertebrate Vtg
sequences revealed five relatively well-conserved regions
[6,12]. Regions I to III, located in the N-terminal part, correspond to the lipovitellin 1 subunit of vertebrate Vtg,
while regions IV and V, located in the C-terminal part, correspond to the lipovitellin 2 subunit. Sequence and
deduced structural homologies indicated an evolutionary
relationship of Vtg with three mammalian proteins, apolipoprotein B100 (apoB), the large subunit of microsomal
triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), and the von Willebrand factor [13,14]. The identification of conserved
amino acid sequence motifs and ancestral exon boundaries in apoB, MTP, non-vertebrate and vertebrate Vtg, and
insect apolipophorin II/I (apoLp-II/I) indicated that large
lipid transfer proteins (LLTP) are members of the same
multigene superfamily and have emerged from a common
ancestral molecule designed to play a pivotal role in the
intracellular and extracellular transfer of lipids and liposoluble substances [15,16].
Knowledge of molecular structure and expression of Vtg
in oviparous animals has increased impressively over the
past two decades [6,17]. Recent molecular characterization and expression studies of the main egg yolk precursor
protein, referred to as Vtg, in over ten decapod crustacean
species suggests that this precursor protein is atypical in
regard to Vtg from other oviparous animals [18-29]. In
addition, it has been shown that the crustacean clotting
protein (CP), a very high density lipoprotein (VHDL)
responsible for hemolymph clot formation, is also a Vtg-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/3

related protein [30,31]. The aim of this study was therefore to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of these crustacean Vtg-related proteins with other LLTP superfamily
members. The results presented here led us to call apolipocrustacein (apoCr) rather than Vtg the major decapod
crustacean egg yolk precursor protein.

Results and discussion
Crustacean apoCr sequences
Full-length apoCr cDNA sequences, annotated as Vtg in
the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank (see the Methods section),
are currently available for eleven decapod species: Penaeus
semisulcatus, Penaeus monodon, Metapenaeus ensis, Marsupenaeus japonicus, Litopenaeus vannamei, Feneropenaeus merguiensis,
Cherax
quadricarinatus,
Machrobrachium
rosenbergii, Charybdis feriatus, Pandalus hypsinotus. and Portunus trituberculatus. In Penaeus semisulcatus and Marsupenaeus japonicus, the same apoCr cDNA was isolated from
ovary and hepatopancreas tissues [23,32]. In Metapenaeus
ensis, two apoCr cDNAs, apoCr1 and apoCr2, were isolated from these two tissues [24,25]. They shared 56%
sequence identity and showed a tissue-specific expression
pattern. These two apoCr may result from a gene duplication event in the Metapenaeus lineage. A recent phylogeny
of penaeid shrimps, performed on two mitochondrial
genes, indicated that Metapenaeus may be representative of
the ancient Penaeus genus but distant from the other
penaeid species [33]. Alignment of the deduced amino
acid sequence of Penaeus semisulcatus revealed a sequence
identity ranging from 92% with Feneropenaeus merguiensis
to 34% with Charybdis feriatus [see Additional file 1]. The
phylogenetic analysis resulting from this alignment (data
not shown) indicated that these deduced precursor proteins may be confidently grouped according to the species
tree; i.e. the penaeid shrimps of Dendrobranchiata suborder were grouped together and the Pleocyemata suborder
species, crab (Charybdis feriatus), crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) and prawn (Machrobrachium rosenbergii, and
Pandalus hypsinotus) were outside this monophyletic
group. It is interesting to note that phylogenetic results
correlated with the expression pattern of apoCr transcripts. Dendrobranchiata suborder species express apoCr
transcripts in both ovaries and hepatopancreas
[18,19,23,24,28,29], while the expression of paralogous
apoCr2 from Metapenaeus ensis [24,25] and apoCr of Pleocyemata suborder species is apparently restricted to the
hepatopancreas [20,21,26,27].
Global sequence alignment of crustacean apoCr with
other LLTP
A BLASTP [34] search of the nonredundant GenBank™
database using Penaeus semisulcatus apoCr as a target
sequence revealed high BLAST scores and expected (E) values with other decapod apoCr, from the full-length
sequence of Feneropenaeus merguiensis (score 4530, E value

0.0) to Charybdis feriatus (score 1134, E value 0.0). There
were also similarities with other extracellular LLTP: insect
apoLp-II/I, from Locusta migratoria (score 296, E value 7e78) to Anopheles gambiae (score 173, E value 9e-41), and
vertebrate apoB, from Gallus gallus (score 115, E value 3e23) to Danio rerio (score 105, E value 4e-20), including
Homo sapiens apoB-100 precursor protein (score 105, E
value 2e-20). Lower scores and E values were retrieved
with Vtg of oviparous animals, ranging from Crassostrea
gigas mollusks (score 100, E value 1e-18) to Samia cynthia
ricini insects (score 40, E value 1.2). BLAST scores and E
values of intracellular MTP family members overlapped
with Vtg family members, as shown with Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus echinoderms (score 48.9, E value 0.003) or
Homo sapiens (score 38.9, E value 3.4). Even if BLAST analysis represents an over simplification of reality, the results
obtained by this method, i.e. so-called crustacean Vtg are
more closely-related to insect apoLp-II/I than to insect
Vtg, as indicated by BLAST scores, was not seriously taken
into account, as the term Vtg was already used for these
sequences.
Crustacean apoCr (~2,600 amino acids) is of intermediate
length between insect, nematode, mollusk, and vertebrate
Vtg, which are generally shorter (~1,600–1,800 amino
acids), and insect apoLp-II/I, which are larger (~3,300
amino acids). Consistent with BLAST scores, crustacean
apoCrs confidently align with insect apoLp-II/Is [see
Additional file 1]. ApoLp-II/I is the high molecular weight
apolipophorin of lipophorin found at high concentrations in insect hemolymph [35-37]. The best local alignments between these sequences occurred along the first
1,000 amino acid residues and in their C-terminal parts
[see Additional file 1].
Domain architecture, conserved sequence motifs, and
consensus cleavage site of crustacean apoCr
A CD-Search [38] revealed that the amino acid sequence
of Penaeus semisulcatus and other crustacean apoCr
include three conserved structural domains (Figure 1). A
lipoprotein N-terminal domain (LPD-N, SMART accession number SM00638), also known as vitellogenin_N
(Pfam accession number PF01347) and enclosed in the
large lipid transfer (LLT) module [15] was identified in the
N-terminal part of apoCr. A DUF1081 domain (Pfam
accession number PF06448) of unknown function was
identified in the central region, and a von Willebrand-factor type-D domain (VWD) (Pfam accession number
PF00094) at the C-terminal end. While the VWD domain,
initially identified in the human von Willebrand factor
(vWF), is distributed over a wide range of proteins, the
LLT module/LPD-N domain, part of the lipovitellin 1 subunit of vertebrate Vtg [6-12], contains twenty-two N-terminal conserved amino acid sequence motifs (N1 to N22)
as a common denominator of LLTP [15]. The alignment

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/3

of these conserved sequence motifs, including those
retrieved from apoCr is published as supporting information [see Additional file 2]. Similarly to apoLp-II/I, crustacean apoCr lacks polyserine tracks that correspond to the
phosvitin domain in the Vtg of vertebrates and some nonvertebrate species.
In insects, the apoLp-II/I is cleaved before its secretion
into apoLp-II and apoLp-I (the subunits were indicated
from the N-terminal to the C-terminal ends of the precursor protein) at a consensus cleavage site, RX(R/K)R, for
dibasic endoprotease processing [35,37], and this cleavage is mediated by furin [39]. Likewise, crustacean apoCr
is also cleaved at a similar dibasic site for subtilisin-like
endoprotease processing [18,21,23,24]. This consensus
site occurs at amino acid position 725/728 in Penaeus semisulcatus (RTRR), between conserved motifs N19 and N20,
and aligns very well between crustacean apoCrs and insect
apoLp-II/Is [see Additional file 1]. The N-terminal apoCr
~74-kDa subunit in Penaeus semisulcatus [23] and other
decapod species, apoCr-II, displays high amino acid
sequence similarities with the ~80-kDa apoLp-II [35,37].
For example, the Penaeus semisulcatus 74-kDa apoCr-II
subunit displays 22%–43% identity-similarity with
Locusta migratoria apoLp-II, while Locusta migratoria
apoLp-II displays no more than 33%–55% and 28%–47%
identity-similarity with Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster apoLp-II, respectively. A similar consensus cleavage site is present in most insect Vtgs, but at a different
location, in the extended region between motifs N6 and
N7 [15]. However, a potential subtilisin-like convertase
site is present between motifs N19 and N20 of nematode
and Crassostrea gigas Vtgs.
Phylogenetic analysis and correlation with LLTP domain
architecture and protein function
The evolutionary relationship of genes in the LLTP superfamily was evaluated after aligning the twenty-two conserved N-terminal sequence motifs of the LLT module of
selected LLTP sequences [see Additional file 2] and the
phylogenetic analyses were conducted by using the neighbor-joining (NJ) and the maximum likelihood (ML) (Figure 2) or the Bayesian inference (BI) (Figure 3) methods.
The phylogenetic tree separated extracellular (apoCr,
apoLp-II/I, apoB, Vtg, and CP) from intracellular (MTP
family) LLTP sequences with confidence into separate
clusters, suggesting that these extracellular proteins arose
from a common ancestor (hereafter, support bootstrap
confidence level values of NJ: 96 and ML: 88, and posterior probability of BI: 0.80). Significant internal branches
defined two sequence groups. The first group, named the
APO family, suggested that apoCr, apoLp-II/I, and apoB
formed a monophyletic branch (NJ: 81; ML: 78; BI: 1.00),
with two subclusters defined by highly significant internal
branches, corresponding to crustacean decapod apoCr

Figure architecture of large lipid transfer protein (LLTP) superfamily members
Domain 1
Domain architecture of large lipid transfer protein (LLTP) superfamily members. Large lipid transfer (LLT) module
[15] also referred to as Vitellogenin_N and LPD-N domain, DUF1081, and VWD domains are indicated from the N-terminal
to the C-terminal ends of the proteins. LLTP families are 1) APO family including vertebrate apolipoprotein B (apoB), decapod
crustacean apolipocrustacein (apoCr), and insect apolipophorin II/I (apoLp-II/I) subfamilies, 2) Vtg/CP family including vitellogenin (Vtg) and crustacean clotting protein (CP) subfamilies, and the large subunit of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein
(MTP) family.

and insect apoLp-II/I subfamilies (NJ: 87; ML: 80; BI:
1.00) on one side and to vertebrate apoB subfamily (NJ:
100; ML: 100; BI: 1.00) on the other side. Internal subbranching of the apoCr/apoLp-II/I subcluster was consistent with the species tree, i.e. crustacean and insect
sequences were separated in two groups, each one with
high support values (NJ: 100; ML: 100; BI: 0.98 and NJ:
100; ML: 100; BI: 1.00, respectively). Duplicated Metapenaeus ensis apoCr sequences were clustered together and
therefore both belonged to the apoCr subfamily. The second group of sequences named the Vtg/CP family supported by a BI posterior probability of 0.82 grouped with
confidence in separate clusters: vertebrate, mollusk, nematode, and insect Vtg, and crustacean CP (NJ: ≥ 99; ML:
100; BI: ≥ 96).
With regard to other crustacean sequences, one point
must be highlighted. Vtg from Daphnia magna, a species
belonging to the class of Branchiopoda, and CP from decapod crustaceans, belonging to the class of Malacostraca,
tend to be grouped with insect Vtg (NJ: 85; ML: 55; BI:
1.00). It should be noted that Daphnia magna Vtg is fused
with a superoxide dismutase module at the N-terminal
end [40]. Therefore, these crustacean proteins are more
closely related to Arthropoda Vtg than decapod apoCr. Vtg,
CP, apoCr, and apoLp-II/I members contain a VWD
domain at their C-terminal end (Figure 1) that may be
implicated in the clotting cascade and multimerization, as
demonstrated with human vWF [41,42]. The functional

significance of the VWD domain in Vtg requires additional elucidation. Recent data demonstrated that teleost
fish Vtg exhibits an agglutinin activity and may be
involved in defense reactions [43,44], and also that insect
apoLp-II/I is involved in the immune response [45,46],
suggesting a new meaning for the conservation of this
domain during evolution. The fact that the phylogenies
presented in Figures 2 and 3 were performed using
sequences of the LLT module/LPD-N domain reinforces
the hypothetical dual-functional nature of crustacean CP.
This constitutes the only protein fraction of crustacean
VHDL, and its involvement in lipid transport was suggested in earlier studies [31,47,48]. It should be noted
that, in crustaceans, the most prominent lipoprotein in
the hemolymph, LP1 or BGBP, is not a member of the
LLTP superfamily but is also associated with defense reactions [49], supporting a link between lipid transport and
immune systems in these animals.
It has been demonstrated that the LPD-N domain found
in LLTP forms a "lipid pocket", enabling lipid loading of
Vtg [50-53]. By comparative analysis, it was suggested
that, in apoB, this domain may similarly form a lipovitellin-like "proteolipid" intermediate containing a lipid
pocket that requires MTP for assembly [54]. The presence
of apoCr and CP, the latter structurally related to Vtg, in
the same shrimp species (Penaeus monodon), and of both
apoLp-II/I and Vtg in honey bees (Apis mellifera), from
separate clusters according to our phylogenetic analysis

algorithm. Numerals at each node show local bootstrap confidence levels estimated by bootstrap pseudoreplicates in NJ and
ML, respectively. Numbers are indicated when at least one bootstrap confidence level value at each node is ≥75. The ML inference yielded a similar topology as the NJ tree at the level of significance used. However (-) indicates that this cluster was not
formed in the ML analysis. Crustacean sequences are shaded in gray. Penaeus monodon apoCr and CP and Apis melliphera apoLpII/I and Vtg are framed as an indication of the presence in one species of homologous extracellular proteins from two different

(Figures 2 and 3), strongly suggest that these sequences
diverged after an ancient duplication event leading to the
separation of an APO paralogous group from Vtg/CP
sequences. Through their LLT module/LPD-N domain,
these homologous sequences retained the capacity to bind
and transport lipids, a function shared with MTP family
members that is probably the ancestral function of LLTP
[15,55]. The use of truncated forms of apoB in cell cultures showed that the percentage of lipid associated with
apoB-100 truncated near the C-terminal end of the LPDN domain, approached zero. Furthermore, there appeared
to be a threshold in apoB size, between 1050 and 1250
amino acids from the N-terminal end, below which the
polypeptide may not form a lipoprotein particle

[reviewed in ref. [56]]. However, apoB needs to reach a
minimum critical length of 884 amino acids for lipoprotein assembly, an MTP-dependent process relying on a
portion of apoB located between amino acids 834 and
1134 [57]. Interestingly, apoCr, apoLp-II/I and apoB
sequences were found to have a common DUF1081
domain, of unknown function (Figure 1). Protein database screening revealed that this domain was specifically
associated with APO sequences (data not shown), and
spanned amino acids 957–1072 of human apoB. Drosophila MTP promotes the assembly and secretion of
human apoB-41 [58], and human MTP enhances the
secretion of Xenopus laevis Vtg [55], which lacks the
DUF1081 domain. A mutant form of human MTP was

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:3

still able to promote Xenopus Vtg synthesis, whereas secretion of human apoB was abolished, suggesting that
requirement of apoB for interacting with MTP is more
stringent than that of Vtg. This may be related to the presence of the DUF1081 domain in apoB. This domain may
be acquired in the APO ancestor through domain accretion and neofunctionalization potentially resulting in better biogenesis of neutral lipid-rich lipoproteins.
Gene duplication facilitates functional divergence but
functional constraints enable the retention of genes with
overlapping or redundant functions. In addition to their
role in plasma and hemolymph lipid transport between
somatic tissues, extracellular LLTP, mainly Vtg and apoCr,
facilitate the massive deposition of yolk reserves inside the
oocytes of most oviparous species. ApoB, apoLp-II/I, and
possibly apoCr containing lipoproteins are involved in
neutral lipid deposition in the oocyte after receptor-mediated endocytosis on the same or similar oocyte-specific
receptor used by Vtg, which belongs to the LDL receptor
superfamily [59-61]. Ovarian lipolysis of these circulating
lipoproteins may also be a main source of lipids for the
growing oocyte [reviewed in ref. [62]]. The low lipid load
of crustacean CP and its abundance in shrimp hemolymph cannot fully account for the amount of lipid accumulated within the oocytes [63] and may explain a major
role of apoCr in this process in conjunction with the
BGBP/LP1.
Relations among the Arthropoda subphyla and the major
groups of crustaceans are still a matter for debate. Crustacea exhibit extensive variability in body plans, compared
to other arthropod groups and monophyly of crustaceans
and relationships among the constituent lineages are controversial [64]. While mitochondrial genomes suggest that
hexapods and crustaceans are mutually paraphyletic [65],
molecular analyses on rRNA and protein-coding nuclear
gene sequences indicate that crustaceans and hexapods
form a clade (Pancrustacea or Tetraconata) and that the
sister group of Hexapoda is Branchiopoda (fairy shrimps,
tadpole shrimps, etc.), rather than Malacostraca (lobsters,
crabs, true shrimps, isopods, etc.) [66,67], thereby making
hexapods terrestrial crustaceans and the traditionally
defined Crustacea, paraphyletic. Additional Branchiopoda and non Decapoda apoCr and Vtg/CP sequences,
together with their role as a main egg yolk precursor protein, may help to clarify the Pancrustacea-major splits, e.g.
provide support for the branchiopods being closest to
hexapods and reject the alternative, e.g. malacostracanhexapod association. Additional data will also clarify the
relationships among the many malacostracan subgroups
[68].

Conclusion
Observation of modular architecture and phylogenetic
analyses demonstrated that the main egg yolk precursor
protein of decapod crustaceans is a member of the LLTP
superfamily, is homologous to insect apoLp-II/I and vertebrate apoB, and would be more appropriately called
apolipocrustacein (apoCr) rather than Vtg. The presence
of apoCr and a clotting protein structurally related to Vtg
from the same shrimp species (e.g. Penaeus monodon) and
both apoLp-II/I and Vtg from insect species (e.g. Apis mellifera), suggest that, in addition to their involvement in the
lipid metabolism, extracellular LLTP may have acquired
other functions during metazoan evolution, e.g. involvement in clotting cascade and immune response. The findings of this study may be also a starting point for using
LLTP phylogeny and their functional role to clarify the
controversial relationships among Pancrustacean constituent lineages.

available in databases clustered with high confidence in a
group separated from other Vtg sequences, including
those of crustaceans apoCr. Vtg sequences representative
of five insect orders (Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera,
Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera) were therefore selected for
analysis and were: UniProt:Q27309 for silkworm (Bombyx

UniProt:U02548 for yellow fever mosquito (Aedes

nipponica).
Sequence analyses
The deduced amino acid sequence of Penaeus semisulcatus
[23] was subjected to a BLASTP search using the Blosum
62 matrix [70]. Amino acid sequences corresponding to
the best hits were then aligned using Clustal X software,
version 1.8 [71]. Sequence alignments were edited and
manually corrected with GeneDoc software [72]. The
twenty-two N-terminal conserved amino acid sequence
motifs (N1 to N22) of the LLT module were extracted
from selected LLTP and aligned as previously described
[15] resulting in a concatenated sequence 351 amino acid
long. Domain architecture of LLTP was examined and
compared using CDART [73].

The phylogenetic tree and branch support values were
estimated using three different methodologies of phylogenetic reconstruction: 1) NJ, 2) ML and 3) BI. NJ algorithm
was based on the number of amino acid substitutions per
site with the Poisson-correction distance method and
pairwise-deletion option for gap sites, and bootstrap support values were obtained with 5,000 pseudoreplicates.
The distance analysis was carried out with MEGA 3.1 [74].
ML analyses was carried out with PHYML v2.4.4 [75] starting from the BIONJ tree, and the gamma distribution for
rate heterogeneity across sites (Γ) was modeled with a
four-category Γ distribution and a shape parameter equal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/3

to 2. The WAG substitution model [76] was selected by
ProtTest v1.3 [77], following the Akaike information criterion, as best-fitting model among the models tested that
could be used in PHYML. Bootstrap values were based on
500 pseudoreplicates to estimate support for the nodes of
the ML tree. A graphical representation of the ML phylogeny was generated with MEGA 3.1 tree explorer. In the
non-parametric-bootstrap trees, bootstrap confidence
level values ≥75 were accepted as significant. BI was performed using MrBayes v3.1.2 [78] with the WAG model of
amino acid substitution provided in the package. Two
simultaneous runs each with four simultaneous Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains run initially for
1,000,000 generations, after which the average standard
deviation of split frequencies was 0.004614, saving the
current tree to file every 100 generations for a total of
10,000 trees in the initial sample. Default cold and heated
chain parameters were used. MCMC runs were summarized and further investigated for convergence of all
parameters, using the sump and sumt commands in
MrBayes and the computer program Tracer version 3.1
[79]. Stationarity was determined to have occurred by the
100,000th generation. Accordingly, the first 1000 trees
prior to log likelihood stabilization were discarded (as
burn-in), and the following 9,000 tree samples were used
to estimate topology and tree parameters. The percentage
of times a node occurred within those 9,000 trees was
interpreted as the posterior probability of the node. A
graphical representation of the majority rule consensus
tree was generated with TreeView v1.6.6 program [80]. In
the Bayesian tree, clades were accepted as significant at
≥0.80 posterior probability.
