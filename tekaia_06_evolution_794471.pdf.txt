Abstract
Background: The evolutionary characterization of species and lifestyles at global levels is
nowadays a subject of considerable interest, particularly with the availability of many complete
genomes. Are there specific properties associated with lifestyles and phylogenies? What are the
underlying evolutionary trends? One of the simplest analyses to address such questions concerns
characterization of proteomes at the amino acids composition level.
Results: In this work, amino acid compositions of a large set of 208 proteomes, with significant
number of representatives from the three phylogenetic domains and different lifestyles are
analyzed, resorting to an appropriate multidimensional method: Correspondence analysis. The
analysis reveals striking discrimination between eukaryotes, prokaryotic mesophiles and
hyperthemophiles-themophiles, following amino acid usage. In sharp contrast, no similar
discrimination is observed for psychrophiles. The observed distributional properties are compared
with various inferred chronologies for the recruitment of amino acids into the genetic code. Such
comparisons reveal correlations between the observed segregations of species following amino
acid usage, and the separation of amino acids following early or late recruitment.
Conclusion: A simple description of proteomes according to amino acid compositions reveals
striking signatures, with sharp segregations or on the contrary non-discriminations following
phylogenies and lifestyles. The distribution of species, following amino acid usage, exhibits a
discrimination between [high GC]-[high optimal growth temperatures] and [low GC]-[moderate
temperatures] characteristics. This discrimination appears to coincide closely with the separation
of amino acids following their inferred early or late recruitment into the genetic code. Taken
together the various results provide a consistent picture for the evolution of proteomes, in terms
of amino acid usage.

Background
Mining the unprecedented wealth of information contained in complete genomes may help understand the
evolutionary history of species. Available genomes from

the three phylogenetic domains, covering a wide spectrum
of lifestyles, provide through global comparative analyses,
new opportunities to decipher genomic characteristics
related to the adaptive evolution of organisms, notably for

extreme conditions such as high [1] or low [2] temperatures. At the DNA level the simplest analyses concern the
GC compositions and, similarly, at the proteomes level
the simplest analyses concern the amino acid compositions. Yet, even such simple comparative descriptions can
reveal important evolutionary properties for the genomes.
For example, at local levels, significant variations in GC
(or dinucleotide) compositions were associated with horizontal transfers or pathogenicity islands in bacteria (see
for example [3]). At more global levels, GC compositions
revealed complex isochore organisations in various
eukaryotes (see for example [4]). For proteomes, compositional description is more elaborate, because of the
number of amino acids as compared to the number of
bases. Also, in comparison to the simple one-dimensional
linearity associated with DNA, the analysis of compositional properties in proteomes makes it necessary to resort
to appropriate multi-dimensional representations for the
data. Such analyses have been performed from different
perspectives, trying for example to identify signatures
associated with different lifestyles. In such background, it
was shown that amino acid usage is under the influence of
GC content, reflecting adaptations to specific environmental conditions [5]. Also, analyses of amino acid compositions in a limited number of proteomes (as available
at the time [1,6-8]) revealed a discrimination of hypethermophiles.
In this work, we consider an extensive analysis of amino
acid usage in 208 proteomes, taking advantage of the
recent significant number of available complete genomes
with the notable increased representation for eukaryotes,
psychrophiles and hyperthermophiles. The work here
extends our previous study concerning 54 genomes [7].
Resorting to Correspondence analysis, we derive the distribution of species following amino acid usage, characterizing the associated fundamental discriminant
signatures and the underlying evolutionary trends.
The analysis here fully confirms the previous observation
for the discrimination between hyperthermophiles and
mesophiles, with, in addition, a striking clearcut segregation of eukaryotes from all other species. In sharp contrast, it appears that psychrophilic lifestyle is not
associated with specific profiles as the corresponding species are not distinguished from mesophilic prokaryotes, at
the level of amino acid compositional analyses. We analyze statistically the segregated groups (eukaryotes,
prokaryotic mesophiles and hyperthermophiles-thermophiles), highlighting the associated discriminant signatures. Finally we attempt to characterize the
evolutionary trends underlying the observed segregations.
We observe that the distribution of species, acccording to
amino acid usage, can be associated essentially with a separation of amino acids following their early or late recruit-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/307

ment into the genetic code, as inferred in a series of
recently published works [9,10]. This separation, from
early to late, can be associated with a directionality from
high GC contents and high optimal growth temperatures
towards lower GC contents and moderate temperatures.
The evolutionary implications for the various observations, in terms of segregation and time directionality in
relation to amino acid recruitment into the genetic code,
are discussed. The results could also be relevant to practical grounds for protein comparison methods, with the
perspective of refined amino acid substitution scores.

Results
We used Correspondence analysis (see Methods) to compare amino acid compositions of 208 predicted proteomes with large representations of the three
phylogenetic domains as well as various lifestyles (20
hyperthermophiles, 7 thermophiles, 8 psychrophiles and
173 mesophiles including 53 eukaryotes; detailed list is in
Additional file 1). Figure 1 shows the resulting distribution of species and amino acids as projected on the first
factorial plane, representing 77% of the total information
in the original data table. We analyze first the distribution
of species, in terms of global properties and discriminated
groups. We then focus on more detailed statistical characterizations of the various groups, with their associated
amino acid signatures. Finally we explore potential evolutionary trends associated with the various observations.
Distribution of species and segregations
Global description
Confirming and refining the results of previous analyses
[6,7] the global distribution of species is first following
GC content, as corresponding to F1 factorial axis (contribution of order 63%), increasing from left to right (23%
in Mycoplasma mycoides to 72.1% in Streptomyces coelicolor), and secondly following optimal growth temperatures, as corresponding to F2 factorial axis (contribution
of order 14%), increasing upward from moderate to high
temperatures. It is important to stress that GC content and
optimal growth temperatures are not included in the set of
analysed parameters, but correspond rather to observations underlying the distributions of species as obtained
from their amino acid compositions.
Species segregation and discrimination following lifestyles and
phylogenies
Based on phylogenetic and lifestyle classifications (as
identified by colour codes in Figure 1 and Figure 1A), we
observe a striking segregation for eukaryotes, prokaryotic
mesophiles and hyperthermophiles, with sharply defined
non-overlapping associated strips. With respect to this
segregation, the only 'discrepancy' concerns the eukaryotic E. cuniculi, in the territory of mesophilic prokaryotes.

for the distribution of species following amino acid compositions. Species names are reported whenever possible (for full list
see Additional file 1). Amino acids (one letter) are represented in green. Coding colours for hyperthemophiles, thermophiles,
prokaryotic mesophiles, psychrophiles and eukaryotes are following legend in Figure 1A. Three main groups, corresponding to
hyperthermophiles-thermophiles; prokaryotic mesophiles-psychrophiles and eukaryotes are roughly delimited by horizontal
dashed grey lines. A: Legend for colour coding symbols. Species and barycenters symbols for the various groups that are
reported in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 with the same colour coding conventions.

The thermophilic species are essentially at the border
between hyperthermophiles and prokaryotic mesophiles
(with the exception of T. elongatus). In contrast with such
clearcut segregation, we observe that psychrophiles are in
the strip associated with prokaryotic mesophiles.
Concerning this general stratified structure in the distribution of species, we observe (Figure 1) that the barycenters
of the various categories considered above (hyperthermophiles (HTH), thermophiles (TH), prokaryotic mesophiles (PMES), psychrophiles (PSYC) and eukaryotes
(EUK)) are roughly aligned along the second factorial
axis. This structure shows that species are rather homogeneously distributed within each category around the barycenters axis (with a mean value of about 40%) according
to their GC content. With this respect, based on the 8
available species, it appears that the scattering of psychrophiles around the corresponding barycenter is of limited extent as compared to the other categories.

Statistical characterization of segregated groups and
associated signatures
Statistical characterization of segregated groups
For detailed characterization of the species distribution
observed in Figure 1 we compared for the various groups
(HTH, TH, PMES, PSYC and EUK) the mean amino acid
compositions, along with pooled means associated with
physico-chemical characteristics (polar, charged and
hydrophobic). We used one way analysis of variance, followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test for
pairwise differences. For robustness and consistency reasons we choose a high probability limit of significance, set
at the probability p < 0.001. Such comparisons revealed
significant signatures (with steady variations of mean values, either increasing or decreasing) between the three following groups: a merged group associated with
hyperthermophiles and thermophiles (HTH-TH); a
merged group associated with prokaryotic mesophiles
and psychrophiles (PMES-PSYC) and finally eukaryotes

(EUK). The corresponding signatures and characteristic
trends are detailed below.

other groups (HTH-TH and PMES-PSYC; the mean values
for these two groups being not significantly different at p
< 0.001).

Physico-chemical signatures
The pools of polar, charged and hydrophobic amino acids
are represented on the factorial plane in Figure 2. The
pools associated respectively with polar and the difference
[polar – charged] amino-acids are characteristic of each
one of the three segregated groups (HTH-TH, PMES-PSYC
and EUK), all three mean value pairs being significantly
different at p < 0.001. The abundance of the polar and
[polar – charged] pools increase steadily from HTH-TH to
PMES-PSYC, from HTH-TH to EUK and from PMES-PSYC
to EUK (see Additional file 4). As for the hydrophobic
pool, we observe a decrease from HTH-TH to EUK and
from PMES-PSYC to EUK. The relative abundance in the
hydrophobic pool thus appears as a characteristic signature for eukaryotes (EUK), since the corresponding mean
value is significantly different from that of each of the two

Amino acid signatures
Based on the discrimination of the three segregated classes
HTH-TH, PMES-PSYC and EUK we classify (with the significance level at p < 0.001) amino acids following three
groups (Figure 3 and Additional file 3):

a) Amino acids whose relative abundance is characteristic
of each one of the three groups (with steady variation either increase or decrease – from HTH-TH to PMES-PSYC
and from PMES-PSYC to EUK): VAL (decrease), His and
Ser (increase).
b) Amino acids characterizing HTH-TH or EUK: for EUK,
Cys is high and Leu, Gly and Ile are low; whereas for HTHTH, Tyr and Glu are high, Asp, Thr and Gln are low.

Figure 3
Species distribution and characteristic amino-acid compositional signatures
Species distribution and characteristic amino-acid compositional signatures. Factorial plane representation and species colour coding are as in Figure 1. Amino acids (three letters) are discriminated according to statistically significant mean
compositional differences (at the probability level of p < 0.001, see text and Additional file 3) between the three segregated
groups (hyperthermophiles-thermophiles, HTH-TH; prokaryotic mesophiles-psychrophiles, PMES-PSYC; eukaryotes, EUK):
amino acids in pale blue (Val, His, Ser) are characteristic for each of the three groups; amino acids in orange (Tyr, Glu, Asp,
Thr, Gln) are characteristic for HTH-TH; amino acids in dark blue (Gly, Ile, Leu, Cys) are characteristic for EUK; amino acids in
black (Lys, Asn, Phe, Met, Trp, Arg) show no significant differences between the three groups (Ala and Pro show only partial
significant differences: between EUK and PMES-PSYC); for a given class, underlined amino acids correspond to high values
steadily decreasing in the three groups downward (HTH-TH to PMES-PSYC and to EUK) whereas non-underlined amino acids
correspond to low values steadily increasing in the same direction.

c) Amino acids with no discriminative characteristics (no
significant differences between the three groups): all others (with the exception of Ala and Pro, with partial discriminative properties).

Overall trends and amino acid chronologies
We investigate overall trends which could underly the segregation of species, following amino acid territories as
shown in Figure 1.

In summary, the characterizations above (at the probability significance level of p < 0.001) are represented in Figure 3 in correspondence with the segregation following
the three main groups (HTH-TH, PMES-PSYC and EUK),
with the non-discriminative amino acids essentially concentrated in a median horizontal strip in the factorial
plane. The description would of course vary according to
the threshold (for example, with a probability threshold
of 0.05 Cys is found to increase from HTH-TH to PMESPSYC). More detailed amino acid comparison results are
reported in Additional file 2, file 3 and file 4.

Protein conservation
For the three phylogenetic domains of life (Achaea (A),
Bacteria (B) and Eukarya (E)), based on systematic comparisons of proteomes, the subsets of proteins conserved
exclusively in one or in combinations of domains (E, A, B,
EA, EB, AB and EAB) were determined, along with the subset of species specific proteins (SPEC, i.e. with no detectable similarities outside their own proteomes). The
comparative data were from results in a recent study [11],
concerning 100 species (amongst the 208 considered
here). The amino acid compositions for the different sub-

sets were determined and used as dummy observations
(see methods) in the factorial analysis distribution shown
in Figure 2. Following this analysis, the trend from the
core set EAB (which can be associated with ancient proteins [12,7] to the specific set SPEC of proteins is essentially following the factorial axis F2, and pointing towards
eukaryotic territory.

1) Model of Jordan et al.:
Following the model of Jordan et al. [9] amino acids are
classified as "gainers" (either strong or weak) or "losers"
(either strong or weak), with "gainers" corresponding to
amino acids supposed to be recruited late into the genetic
code. In this model the "strong gainers" are His, Ser and
Cys (corresponding to the discriminant signatures for the
three main segregated classes above) along with Phe and
Met. Conversely, in this model, the "strong losers" (presumed to include the most ancient amino acids) are Pro,
Ala, Glu and Gly. This separation between "strong losers"
and "gainers" is recovered rather faithfully in our factorial
analysis if we separate the factorial plane into two regions
T1 and T2 (as represented in Figure 4) corresponding

Amino acid chronologies
In this section we consider the distributions observed
above in the light of inferred chronologies for amino acids
recruitment into the genetic code, following models and
data from Jordan et al. [9], Trifonov [10], Miller [13,14]
and Cronin and Pizzarello[15].

Figure 4
Amino acids distribution and chronological models for the recruitment into the genetic code
Amino acids distribution and chronological models for the recruitment into the genetic code. Factorial plane representation and species colour coding symbols are as in Figure 1. Dashed diagonal line in grey separates roughly the territory
T1 ([high optimal growth temperature]-[high GC content]) from the territory T2 ([moderate optimal growth temperature][low GC content]), with arrow pointing from T1 to T2. Colour coding for amino-acids is following the model of Jordan et al.
[9]: "strong losers" are orange (Glu, Gly, Ala, Pro); "weak loser" Lys is orange with a black outline; "strong gainers" are filled
black (Cys, Ser, His, Phe, Met); "weak gainers" have black outlines (Asn, Ile, Thr, Val); all other amino acids are green. Amino
acids found in Miller's experiments [14] or in the Murchison meteorite [15] are labelled with black, respectively red, crosses
(the number of crosses, in each colour, follows the reported abundances for the corresponding amino acids; see Additional
Table 3 in Jordan et al. [9]). Numbering of amino acids in blue is following the chronology compiled by Trifonov (Figure 1 in
[10]; with possible different codon chronologies associated with a given amino acid, such as for Ser ranking 6 or 11 following
the codon).

Page 6 of 11

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:307

respectively to [high_temperature]-[high_GC] and
[moderate_temperature]-[low_GC] characteristics, with a
roughly defined border. With such a separation of the factorial plane we observe that the "strong gainers" His, Ser
and Cys are in T2, with Phe and Met at the border. In addition, the "weak gainers" in this model (Asn, Thr and Ile;
but not Val, in T1) also lie within the T2 space. Conversely, all "strong losers" lie within T1, while the "weak
loser" Lys is situated in T2.
2) Model of Trifonov:
With the factorial plane separation above, we observe that
the amino acids in T1 correspond largely to the first
amino acids recruited into the genetic code according to
the chronology suggested by Trifonov [10] (Gly, Ala, Asp,
Val, Pro, Ser, Glu, Leu, Thr, Arg; see the order reported on
the amino acids in Figure 4). In this list, the first discrepancy according to the separation in Figure 4 concerns the
amino acid Ser in position 6 (with the 5 first amino acids
in the list all situated in T1). It is nevertheless interesting
to note that in the analysis of Trifonov it appears that Ser
was also the first amino acid in the chronological classification for which two distinct positions were considered,
following the associated codons (either UCX or AGY; with
the associated ranks 6 and 11; see Figure 1 in [10]). As for
Thr (ranked 9 in the chronology by Trifonov) its position
in Figure 4 is at the border between T1 and T2. The two
discrepancies between the chronology by Trifonov and
the separation T1/T2 concern Ser and Thr and appear to
correspond to contradictions between the models by Trifonov and by Jordan et al. (with Ser and Thr reported as
"strong" and "weak gainers", respectively, in the model of
Jordan et al. [9]).
3) Miller's experiments and data from the Murchison
meteorite:
The ancient amino acids, as derived from Miller's experiments [13,14] and analysis of Murchison meteorite [15]
(both informations being included in the criteria used for
establishing the chronology in [10]), are essentially clustered in T1. It is striking to observe that the most abundant
amino acids in these experiments [14,15] (Gly and Ala)
are deep situated in T1, whereas those reported to be less
abundant tend to cluster at the boundary between T1 and
T2. It is also not surprising to observe that the possible
"discrepancies" between the spark data (Miller's experiment) and the T1/T2 scheme concern again the amino
acids Ser and Thr. However, interestingly, these amino
acids do also correspond to the observed discrepancies
between the spark data and the Murchinson meteorite
data (Ser and Thr are not reported in the meteorite data;
see representations in Figure 4) as well as to discrepancies
between the two models above, as already mentioned.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/307

Finally, the overall decreasing gradient from T1 to T2 (Figure 4) in terms of ancient amino acid abundance is further
enhanced with the chronology following the "yields of
amino acids in imitated primordial conditions" as compiled by Trifonov [10] (criterion N3'; including 3 experimental conditions in addition to that of Miller's).
The various schemes above, relevant to the analysis of
chronologies in correspondence with the recruitment of
amino acids into the genetic code, let us suggest a timedirectionality, the arrow from T1 to T2 in Figure 4. Overall, the direction of this arrow points in the same direction
than the one associated with proteins conservation: from
the most conserved ancestral common "core" of proteins
to the set of species-specific proteins.

Discussion
Based on amino acid compositions of proteomes, Correspondence analysis revealed a clearcut segregation of species following three lifestyle-phylogenetic classes:
eukaryotes, prokaryotic mesophiles-psychrophiles and
hyperthermophiles-thermophiles. Detailed statistical
analyses confirmed the separation of the three classes,
with associated signatures in terms of amino acids usage.
Notably, the three classes are discriminated by the relative
abundances in His, Ser and Val, and in the pools associated with polar and [polar – charged] amino acids. With
respect to such signatures, it is interesting to note that the
[polar – charged] criterion is not exclusive to the hyperthermophiles-thermophiles class [8], but is a distinctive
feature of each one of the three classes.
The evidence for sharply defined non-overlapping territories for species based on amino acids usage raises many
questions relevant to the evolution of lifestyles and to
phylogenies: for example are the segregations following
general trends and what underlies such observed segregations?
Concerning the overall trends, a separation of the factorial
plane into two regions (T1: [high_temperature][high_GC] and T2: [moderate_temperature]-[low_GC],
respectively) revealed striking correspondences between
the distribution of the amino acids in the respective
regions and various classifications relative to chronologies
for the recruitment of amino acids into the genetic code.
In such correspondences, through convergent criteria, it
appears that amino acids found in T1 are essentially those
supposed to be the earliest in the genetic code, and, conversely, that amino acids found in T2 are essentially those
supposed to be most recent. An interesting feature in the
convergent picture is the emergence of a possible basic
consensus between the various considered schemes relative to amino acid chronologies (no matter possible limitations inherent to each one of them; with this respect see

for example the recent discussion of the work of Jordan et
al. [9] in [16-18]). In this direction, it may well be that the
analysis here, based on completely independent criteria
(observed amino acid compositions), could provide an
efficient 'filtering' scheme for capturing genuine convergences between the various models. For example, following all models and data, it is clear that the core of inferred
most ancient amino acids are in T1. Such a core could correspond to the list [Gly, Ala, Val, Pro, Glu], in which the
only notable discrepancy is for Val following the Jordan et
al. [9] model (reported as a "weak gainer"). The other way
round, the amino acid Ser, which is next in the chronology by Trifonov, is situated deep in T2, in agreement with
the model of Jordan et al. [9] (as a "strong gainer"). This
contradictory assignment could be further resolved in
favour of Ser not early in the list by noting that even
though present in the spark experiment (in little amount)
this amino acid was absent in the meteorite composition.
And finally, in the Trifonov chronology itself, Ser was the
first amino acid for which a dual rank was considered, following codon usage.

Conclusion
In conclusion, an overall trend could be suggested for the
observed segregation of species with amino acids usage,
corresponding to an underlying time arrow from T1 to T2.
This trend would be consistent with the following global
evolutionary model: early steps of life were associated
with high GCs and high temperatures [19], and, with the
further recruitment of amino acids into the genetic code,
the overall evolutionary trend was towards lower GCs,
reduced temperatures and the appearance of new lifestyles, including mesophily and psychrophily, as well as
the eukaryotic phylogenetic domain.
This study allowed to gain new insights into how amino
acid usage has changed over evolutionary time. Such
results could also help to better understand proteins evolution, notably in terms of physico-chemical and structural properties in adaptation to various conditions. With
this respect, a discriminative feature associated with psychrophiles, despite their non-segregation, appears to be
the limited extent of their spreading on the factorial plane
around mean values. If further confirmed, this observation concerning the 8 available genomes, could reveal
complex characterizations for psychrophilic proteins with
constrained mutual dependences in amino acid compositions.
Finally, on application grounds, the results here could
lead to enhanced amino acid substitutional models, taking into account amino acid frequencies reflecting the
topology of species segregations as demonstrated here.

Methods
The predicted proteomes for 208 species (Additional file
1) were mainly downloaded from the ncbi web server
[20]. Lifestyles and optimal growth temperature are as
reported on this server. The classification of species
according to optimal growth temperatures was as follows:
hyperthermophiles for temperatures higher than 60°C;
thermophiles for temperatures between 60°C and 50°C;
mesophiles for temperatures between 50°C and 15°C
and psychrophiles for temperatures lower than 15°C.
The amino acid compositions of the 208 species were calculated, leading to a data table (208 rows versus 20 columns). The data table was analyzed using
Correspondence analysis [21-23].
Correspondence analysis
Correspondence analysis [21-23] is a powerful method
for the multivariate exploration of large-scale data. This
method has been applied in various research areas,
including genomic analyses (for example [24-26]). For
the extraction of relevant informations from the raw data,
Correspondence analysis relies on the projection of highdimensional informations on low-dimensional spaces.
Such projections, into a plane, allow direct visual inspection of significant trends, which are often difficult to grasp
in the high-dimensional spaces. The dimensions of the
considered spaces are relevant to the number of variables
and observations involved in the study (such as, here, the
variables associated with the different amino-acids, and
the observations associated with the different species). In
this multivariate method -as applied to positive numerical
data matrices – we can construct an orthogonal system
called factorial axes, corresponding to the low-order projections on planes called factorial planes. An important
virtue of this construction is that the characteristic properties of the observations and the variables are displayed
simultaneously on the factorial planes. A transition formula allows the calculation of the coordinates of a given
observation (respectively variable) as a function of the
variables (respectively observation) coordinates. The
method is called after the 'correspondence' between the
analysis of observations and that of variables. In this analysis, each factorial axis represents a fraction of the whole
information in the analysed table. The statistical significance of this fraction determines the relative confidence
attached to the displayed observations and/or variables,
on the corresponding axis. The orthogonality of the factorial axes permits the summation of their corresponding
information fractions. For example, the fraction of total
information included in the first factorial plane is
obtained by summing the fractions corresponding to the
first (F1) and to the second (F2) factorial axes. Positions on
the factorial space are directly linked to the similarities
between species, amino acids and relationships between

these two sets. Species with similar global amino acid
compositions are displayed close to each other. Species
with high compositions in some amino acids are plotted
in the same direction with regard to the origin. Such representation reveals associations between subsets of species
and/or amino acids. Correspondence analysis also allows
to consider dummy or 'illustrative variables' (respectively
'illustrative observations'), as additional variables (respectively observations) which do not contribute to the construction of the factorial space, but can be displayed on
this factorial space. With such a representation it is possible to determine to which observations and variables the
illustrative variables and observations are close to. It is
worth to mention that in classification studies, Correspondence analysis can be used as preliminary step to represent the observations in an orthologonal system, so that
euclidean distances can be calculated to construct clusters
of observations (as for example in [11,25]).
Illustrative variables and observations
Following the Correspondence analysis method, we considered "illustrative variables" (respectively "illustrative
observations"), as additional variables (respectively
observations), which can be displayed on the factorial
space. Accordingly the following positions on the factorial
plane were determined: barycenters for hyperthermophiles (HTH), thermophiles (TH), psychrophiles
(PSYC), prokaryotic mesophiles (PMES) and eukaryotes
(EUK). The positions for polar (POL), charged (CHAR)
and hydrophobic (HYD) amino acids were also determined.

Three illustrative variables have been considered: 'CHAR'
for charged amino acids (Asp (D), Glu (E), Lys (K), Arg
(R) and His (H)), 'POL' for polar/uncharged amino acids
(Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Asn (N), Gln (Q), Tyr (Y) and
Cys (C)) and 'HYD' for hydrophobic amino-acids (Leu
(L), Met (M), Ile (I), Val (V), Trp (W), Pro (P), Ala (A) and
Phe (F)). The amino-acid composition values attributed
to the supplementary variables were obtained by summing the respective contributions of the corresponding
amino acids, in the various species (for example, for the
variable CHAR, the contributions of the amino acids Asp,
Glu, Lys, Arg and His, are summed).
Six illustrative observations were considered:
Amino acid compositions in hyperthermophilic species
(HTH), thermophiles (TH), psychrophiles (PSYC),
prokaryotic mesophiles (PMES) and eukaryotes (EUK).
Eight other illustrative observations corresponding to
amino acids compositions in subsets of proteins were
determined from available 100 species comparisons
(among the 208) as obtained in a recent work [11]:

1) proteins specific to each species (SPEC: proteins with
no matches outside their own genomes),
2) proteins conserved exclusively in one domain of life [E:
in eukaryal species, A: in archaeal species and B: in bacterial species],
3) proteins exclusively conserved in a combination of 2
domains [EA: eukaryal and archaeal, EB: eukaryal and
bacterial and AB: archaeal and bacterial], or in the intersection of the three domains [EAB: eukaryal, archaeal and
bacterial].
The final data table submitted to Correspondence analysis
is composed of 222 lines versus 23 columns, including 14
illustrative observations and 3 illustrative variables.
Statistical tests
One way analysis of variance was used to compare mean
amino-acid compositions between the considered groups
(HTH-TH, PMES-PSYC, EUK). When a significant difference was observed, Newman-Keuls (NK) multiple comparison test was performed to determine pairs with
significant mean differences. For robustness and consistency we only considered in this work significant differences at the probability level of p < 0.001. Detailed results
are reported in Additional file 2, file 3 and file 4.
