Abstract
Background: WRKY proteins belong to the WRKY-GCM1 superfamily of zinc finger
transcription factors that have been subject to a large plant-specific diversification. For the cereal
crop barley (Hordeum vulgare), three different WRKY proteins have been characterized so far as
regulators in sucrose signaling, pathogen defense, and in response to cold and drought. However,
their phylogenetic relationship remained unresolved.
Results: In this study, we used available sequence information to identify a minimum number of 45
barley WRKY transcription factor (HvWRKY) genes. According to their structural features, the
HvWRKY factors were classified into the previously defined polyphyletic WRKY subgroups 1 to 3.
Furthermore, we could assign putative orthologs of the HvWRKY proteins in Arabidopsis and rice.
While in most cases clades of orthologous proteins were formed within each group or subgroup,
other clades were composed of paralogous proteins for the grasses and Arabidopsis only, which is
indicative of specific gene radiation events. To gain insight into their putative functions, we
examined expression profiles of WRKY genes from publicly available microarray data resources and
found group specific expression patterns. While putative orthologs of the HvWRKY transcription
factors have been inferred from phylogenetic sequence analysis, we performed a comparative
expression analysis of WRKY genes in Arabidopsis and barley. Indeed, highly correlative expression
profiles were found between some of the putative orthologs.
Conclusion: HvWRKY genes have not only undergone radiation in monocot or dicot species, but
exhibit evolutionary traits specific to grasses. HvWRKY proteins exhibited not only sequence
similarities between orthologs with Arabidopsis, but also relatedness in their expression patterns.
This correlative expression is indicative for a putative conserved function of related WRKY
proteins in monocot and dicot species.

Background
In plants, WRKY proteins constitute a large family of transcription factors. Since their first identification in sweet
potato and wild oats [1,2] the WRKY proteins have been
described as transcriptional regulators in multiple plant
species and in various processes such as pathogen defense
[3-9], trichome [10] and seed development [11], as well as
leaf senescence [12,13]. The common feature of WRKY
proteins is the existence of either one or two WRKY
domains. The WRKY domain is an approximately 60
amino acids long spanning DNA binding domain, which
contains a highly conserved amino acid motif, WRKYGQK, at its N-terminus and a metal chelating zinc finger
signature at the C-terminus. The crystal structure of one
WRKY domain has been resolved recently [14] and provides an insight into how the conserved residues of the
WRKY domain facilitate the binding to their cognate
DNA-element, the W-box. While most of the functional
studies of WRKY proteins indicate a binding to the conserved nucleotide consensus sequence TGAC(C/T) of the
W-box, the binding to another cis-element called SURE
has also been described [15].
Based on the number of WRKY domains present and on
the type of zinc finger WRKY proteins have been classified
into groups 1, 2a to 2e and 3 [16]. WRKY transcription factors seem to have their evolutionary origin in ancient
eukaryotes with the most basal WRKY genes identified in
the unicellular eukaryote Giardia lamblia and the slime
mold Dictyostelium discoideum [17,18]. While the WRKYGCM1 superfamily has been found in all organism kingdoms, the conserved WRKY-type signatures of these genes
have not yet been detected in the lineage of true fungi and
animals [19]. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis revealed
that the WRKY transcription factor family has expanded to
great extent in higher plants [20]. For example, the WRKY
gene family consists of 72 members in Arabidopsis [16]
and at least 81 members in rice [6,18,21,22].
The cereal crop barley is of high importance for food, feed
and brewing. After maize, rice and wheat, barley ranked as
number four in cereal production in 2005 [23,24]. Due to
its wide ecological potential and adaptability, it is cultivated worldwide and under diverse environmental conditions. For example, barley is grown on soils and in
altitudes that are unsuitable for wheat and oats [23,24].
The genome of barley is estimated to be of approximately
5000 Mb in size and has not been fully sequenced yet.
However, the GenBank EST dataset for barley contains
almost 440,000 ESTs and provides a valuable resource for
bioinformatics analyses [25]. In addition, the Affymetrix
22 K Barley1 GeneChip microarray, representing probe
sets for roughly 22,000 genes [26] was released in 2004.
Nowadays, a number of barley microarray experiments
are accessible via different public sources such as Barley-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/194

Base [27,28] or GEO [29,30] and allow for in silico expression analyses of barley genes.
Several studies have shown an interest in barley WRKY
proteins (HvWRKY) and their function. HvWRKY1, also
named HvWRKY38, has been reported to be involved in
several regulatory processes, such as the response to cold
and drought [31] and the repression of the alpha-amylase
gene Amy32b during seed germination [32]. Recently, the
same WRKY protein and its paralog HvWRKY2 have been
described as repressors of the PAMP-triggered basal
defense upon infection with Blumeria graminis [8]. Apart
from HvWRKY proteins functioning in response to biotic
and abiotic stresses, the group 1 WRKY protein SUSIBA2
has been shown to mediate sucrose signaling in barley
cells during regulation of starch synthesis [15,33].
In this study we identified 45 members of the WRKY gene
family in barley based on publicly available sequence
information. We describe their phylogenetic relationship
and try to assign putative orthologs from barley, Arabidopsis and rice. Expression analysis using microarray data
suggests the involvement of some of the HvWRKY proteins in response to powdery mildew and in plant development. Moreover, correlated expression of orthologous
barley and Arabidopsis WRKY genes imply that their function is retained in monocot and dicot species.

Results
Identification of 45 WRKY protein coding sequences in
barley
To estimate the minimum number of WRKY genes in barley, publicly available sequence data was searched with
the BLAST program. The protein sequence of WRKY
domains from representative members for all subgroups
from Arabidopsis (AtWRKY1, -18, -6, -8, -7, -14 and -30)
were used as input. The primary search resulted in 142
non-redundant hits, of which 20 were removed as they
did not contain the conserved WRKY domain signature.
The remaining 122 sequences were screened for partial
overlaps by pairwise comparison; this analysis identified
45 WRKY open reading frames (ORFs) unique for barley.
A keyword search on NCBI returned eight previously
annotated HvWRKY protein sequences. As indicated by
corresponding EST sequences, all eight ORFs were
expressed. In order to create a uniform nomenclature with
consecutive numbering, we renamed sequences annotated as putative WRKY2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to HvWRKY2, 3, 4,
5 and 6, respectively. Sequences of HvWRKY3 and 4 could
be extended based on available EST information. The
sequence of putative WRKY1 protein, CAD60651, is identical with the sequence AAS48544 which has been published as HvWRKY-38 [31]. We designated both
sequences as HvWRKY1 and did not annotate any
sequence as HvWRKY38 to prevent confusion. SUSIBA2

received the formal name HvWRKY46. The remaining
sequences were annotated accordingly as HvWRKY7 to
HvWRKY37 and HvWRKY39 to HvWRKY45 (Table 1).
Seven of the HvWRKY sequences included start and stop
codons and, as judged by protein sequence alignments
with WRKY proteins from rice (data not shown), constitute complete coding sequences. The remaining 39
HvWRKY sequences represented partial coding sequences.
To confirm that we were identifying clade members cor-

rectly, we extended sequence information by PCR
HvWRKY6 and HvWRKY9, a putative group 1 WRKY and
group 2d WRKY, respectively. This approach revealed a
second WRKY domain in the sequence of HvWRKY6, confirming that HvWRKY6 is indeed a class 1 member. In case
of HvWRKY9, a characteristic domain with the highly conserved amino acid sequence HARF [34] could be detected
at the beginning of the coding sequence confirming that it
too, was correctly assigned by our analysis.

While Eulgem et al. [16] defined WRKY proteins by the
conserved heptapeptide WRKYGQK, slight variations of
this sequence have been described for a number of rice
WRKY proteins [20,21]. Similarly, a number of HvWRKY
sequences have amino acid sequence substitutions in the
conserved WRKY signature. In HvWRKY18, 19 and 20 the
WRKY domain displays the sequence WRKYGKK, in
HvWRKY33 and 34 WRKYGEK, in HvWRKY36 WRKYGQN and in the C-terminal domain of HvWRKY24
WSKYGQM (Figure 1). Moreover, a unique zinc-finger
motif (C-X4–5-C-X22–23-H-X-H) was described as a second
characteristic feature of WRKY proteins[16]. In group 3
WRKY proteins, this motif is slightly altered to C-X7-CX23-H-X-C. In barley, three of the so far characterized
group 3 WRKY proteins, namely HvWRKY33 and 34,
showed an extension of the zinc finger motif (C-X7-C-X24H-X-C) compared to the patterns described by Eulgem et
al. [16] (Figure 1). Again, similar modifications of the
zinc-finger patterns were detected for rice WRKY proteins
and have been discussed to be a monocot-specific feature
[18,20,21].
Phylogenetic analysis of barley WRKY proteins
While the phylogenetic analysis showed that WRKY proteins are of monophyletic nature [19], the assignment to
defined groups is polyphyletic and either based on the
number of WRKY domains or on the type of zinc finger
motif. To study the phylogenetic relationship of the 45
HvWRKY proteins we performed a multiple sequence
alignment of the about 60 amino acids spanning the
WRKY domain of all HvWRKYs. To obtain a better separation of the different groups and subgroups, WRKY
domains from members of different Arabidopsis and rice
WRKY proteins were included in the analysis. For each of
the groups 1, 2a to 2e and 3 one representative was chosen
randomly. These were: AtWRKY20, -40, -72, -50, -74, -65,
-54 for Arabidopsis and OsWRKY82, -71, -27, -25, -68, -2,
-46 for rice (classified according to Xie et al. [21]). Both Cterminal and N-terminal WRKY domains of group 1
WRKY proteins have been treated as independent
sequences, so that a total number of 51 barley, 8 Arabidopsis and 8 rice WRKY domains were analyzed.

As shown in Figure 2 for all subgroups of WRKY proteins,
we could identify at least one representative in the barley
genome. For example, five HvWRKY sequences code for
proteins with two WRKY domains and clearly group with
the group 1 members AtWRKY2 and OsWRKY82. The single WRKY domain identified for HvWRKY43 clusters
within the C-terminal group 1 domains, indicating that a
second N-terminal domain remains likely to be identified.
Interestingly, the 24 identified group 2 WRKY members of
barley are distributed very unevenly among the five subgroups. Whereas 11 HvWRKYs form a distinct subclade
with the characteristic members of subgroup 2c, only a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/194

single barley WRKY, HvWRKY37, belongs to group 2b.
Group 3 is represented by 13 single-WRKY domain barley
proteins yet, both WRKY domains of HvWRKY24 cluster
with these proteins. Again, this phenomenon has been
observed for at least four rice WRKY proteins: OsWRKY41,
-61, -63 and -81 [21].
The total number of barley WRKY genes will remain
unknown until the sequencing of the barley genome is
completed. However, we constructed an alignment and a
phylogenetic tree of 72 Arabidopsis, 45 barley and 81 rice
WRKY proteins to estimate this number (Additional Files
1 and 2). As described earlier by Zhang and Wang [20],
group 2 and 3 domains were closer related to the C-terminal domains of group 1 whereas the N-terminal WRKY
domains of group 1 members form a separate monophyletic cluster. On the other hand, separate subclades of
the WRKY domains of subgroup 2c underline the paraphyletic nature of these subgroups (Additional File 2).
The grouping of HvWRKY36, HvWRKY6 and OsWRKY82
based solely on the phylogenetic analysis of their WRKY
domain sequences can not be performed unambiguously.
However, the presence of two WRKY domains in
HvWRKY6 and OsWRKY82 is indicative for group 1 members. Both C-terminal and N-terminal WRKY domains of
HvWRKY6 and OsWRKY82 support basal monophyletic
subclades of group 1 WRKY proteins (Figure 1 and Additional File 2), which might be specific for grasses [21].
The number of WRKY proteins within each species
assigned to the different paraphyletic subgroups 1 to 3
was calculated and is summarized in Table 2. A simple
comparison of the total number of Arabidopsis and rice
WRKY genes with the number of HvWRKYs indicates that
approximately 50% of the barley WRKY genes have been
identified. Also, the distribution of WRKY proteins
showed that HvWRKYs are underestimated in several subgroups. Nevertheless, similar numbers of barley and rice
WRKY proteins in subgroups 2a and 2d may indicate that
all HvWRKY proteins of this subgroup have been identified.
Monocot-specific radiation and identification of
orthologous WRKY genes
Based on the WRKY domains of all proteins from barley,
Arabidopsis and rice, we calculated a comprehensive phylogenetic tree to gain a closer insight into the evolutionary
relationships between WRKY proteins (Additional File 2)
and assign putative WRKY orthologs between these
sequences. Additionally, nine WRKY domains of the moss
Physcomitrella patens, two each from Giardia lamblia and
Dictyostelium discoideum, as well as additional zinc finger
domains of other WRKY-GCM1-like proteins were
included as outgroups.

Clades exist for almost all WRKY subgroups which consist
solely of rice WRKY domains or a combination of rice and
Arabidopsis WRKY domains; these clades might be comprised of orthologs of yet unidentified barley WRKY proteins. In contrast, rice and barley WRKY domains form a
number of monocot-specific clades inside group 2c and
group 3. These clades reveal clusters of orthologous WRKY
proteins for rice and barley. For example in subgroup 2c,
AtWRKY50 forms a basal accession to five barley and six
rice WRKY domains. Similarly, in a subgroup of group 3,
ten barley and nine rice WRKY proteins constitute putative monocotyledonous orthologs that diverge from a
group of three paralogous Arabidopsis WRKY proteins
(Additional File 2). Thus, the barley and rice WRKY proteins that form paralogous or orthologous groups would
indicate monocot-specific diversification of WRKY genes.

This assumption was further supported by BLAST searches
in dbEST [25], which did not return orthologous WRKY
domains of any other dicotyledonous species for the
monocot-specific subclades (data not shown). Thus, our
results support the idea of radiation events in groups 2c
and 3 WRKY proteins that are specific for monocot species. This diversification has most likely occurred after the
ancestral divergence of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants.
The assignment of orthologs is crucial for transferring the
knowledge of WRKY protein functions from the model
plants rice and Arabidopsis to barley. Therefore, based on
the presented phylogenetic tree (Additional File 2), we
assigned orthologs for most of the WRKY genes described
(Table 1). In a few cases orthologs could not be defined
unambiguously. However, as gene orthology implies similar gene function, the assignment presented provided a
solid base for functional analyses.
Powdery mildew infection affects expression of HvWRKY
genes
The analysis of temporal and spatial expression patterns is
an initial step towards the functional characterization of
genes. The expression of numerous WRKY genes from various plant species is affected by biotic and abiotic stresses
([6] and references therein) and implies the regulatory
role of WRKY proteins in stress responses. In order to
investigate if this is also true for HvWRKY genes, we
mined publicly available microarray data of barley leaves
infected with powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis). A total
of 23 probesets on the Barley1 GeneChip could be

assigned to 20 different HvWRKY genes (Table 3). Datasets of two experiments named BB4 and BB7 were
retrieved from BarleyBase [27,28,35] and analyzed. Figure
3 shows the expression profiles of 20 HvWRKY genes are
displayed for two genotypes (Mlo and mlo5) under infection and non-infection conditions (BB7) as well as during
a time course experiment using the host genotype Mla1
and the Bgh isolate 5874 (BB4, see publication for
details). Even though the setup of the BB7 and BB4 experiments differ, some general trends can be seen in both
experiments. Roughly 50% of all HvWRKY genes show
altered expression levels upon infection with Blumeria
graminis. HvWRKY1 and HvWRKY2 have been previously
shown to be involved in the regulation of defense mechanisms [8]. HvWRKY1 expression appears to be drastically
increased under one experimental condition (BB7) and
lower in the second (BB4), while HvWRKY2 shows
increased expression levels in both experiments. In addition to these two WRKY genes, a number of other
HvWRKY genes mediating pathogen responses could be
assigned based on their expression profiles. For example,
the gene for HvWRKY3, which is closely related to the
well-studied pathogen response regulators AtWRKY18, 40 and -60, shows an increase in expression after 20 h of
pathogen treatment. Also, putative pathogen response
regulators could be found in subgroups 2c and 3. Interestingly, these are WRKY groups that have undergone monocot-specific radiation events, which might thus have been
related to an increased biotic stress during evolution. In
addition to upregulated genes, there are HvWRKY genes
with decreased transcript levels, such as most of the
HvWRKY genes in group 1. However, expression of several

HvWRKY genes was not affected upon powdery mildew
infection and, therefore, might function in regulatory
processes other than pathogen response such as abiotic
stress or development.
Orthologous barley and Arabidopsis WRKY genes exhibit
correlative expression signatures during plant
development
A number of WRKY proteins have been reported to be
involved in plant developmental processes [10-12]. To
investigate if HvWRKY transcript levels vary during plant
development, we used public microarray data of different
developmental stages from barley [36] and investigated
whether phylogenetically related WRKY genes of barley
and Arabidopsis exhibited similarities in their expression

patterns. As not all WRKY genes of both barley and Arabidopsis are represented on their respective microarrays, we
were restricted to the expression patterns of 16 HvWRKY
genes and their putative Arabidopsis orthologs. We
extracted expression data from the total microarray dataset for ten organs in barley at different developmental
stages:coleoptile, mesocotyl, radicule, leaf, root, inflorescence, anthers, and caryopsis 5, 10 and 16 days post
anthesis (d.p.a.) [36].
The expression profiles reveal spatial and temporal variations in expression of HvWRKY genes in different barley
organs (Additional File 3). Some genes, like HvWRKY2, 4 and -46, have similar expression levels in all investigated
tissues. In contrast, genes such as HvWRKY5, -6, -9, -39

and -41 reveal more than 3-fold difference in expression
levels in different organs. Furthermore, the transcript levels of barley WRKY genes in the same organ show temporal variations. For example, HvWRKY32 is expressed in
young caryopses at 5 d.p.a. but is clearly reduced in later
stages of caryopsis development (Figure 4). Similarly, the
expression levels of HvWRKY6 are low in radicules but significantly higher in older roots. In addition, paralogous
barley WRKY genes such as HvWRKY5 and -20 reveal similar expression patterns, implying redundant function.

0.49 to +0.91 (Table 4). The average correlation of all the
putative orthologous WRKY genes was +0.24 and differed
significantly (p-value 0.009) from the average expression
correlation of a control dataset composed of 101 randomly chosen gene pairs (+0.01; Additional File 3). Selection of only the best correlated pairs of HvWRKY and
AtWRKY orthologs even increased the average correlation
coefficient to +0.37. This high correlation can be easily
seen by the overall expression pattern of the compared
WRKY genes (Figure 4). For example, the expression levels
of the orthologous pair in group 1, AtWRKY20 and
HvWRKY46, hardly differ in any of the ten organs and are
clearly correlated. In contrast, the expression profiles of
HvWRKY9 and AtWRKY7 are observably anti-correlated.
Genes for the group 2e WRKY protein HvWRKY39 and
their closely related Arabidopsis orthologs AtWRKY65
and -69 show a consistent increase in mRNA level in radicules and roots with low expression levels in leaves.
According to our phylogenetic analysis, HvWRKY6 has

two potential orthologs in Arabidopsis, namely AtWRKY1
and AtWRKY32. The HvWRKY6 expression profile resembles that of AtWRKY1 (+0.41) in vegetative tissues but is
more similar to the profile of AtWRKY32 (+0.45) in reproductive organs such as the inflorescence and the anthers.
This might indicate that the Arabidopsis WRKY genes
have undergone functional changes after a duplication
event.

Next, we performed RT-PCR experiments on cDNA from
three different organs (roots, leaves and infructescences)
and to extend our studies we also included samples from
rice, Oryza sativa japonica, for the analysis. The signal
intensities of the PCR products were quantified and normalized to the Actin controls to calculate normalized fold
intensities for each organ and organism (Additional File
4). First of all, the expression trajectories of all tested barley and Arabidopsis genes generally reproduced those
observed in the microarrays experiments (Figure 5). Transcripts of the three orthologs HvWRKY46, OsWRKY78 and
AtWRKY20 were the most abundant and expressed to the
same amount in all organs. Although HvWRKY39 and
OsWRKY13 constitute close relatives, their normalized
intensities differ especially in leaves where no HvWRKY39
transcript could be detected (Figure 5).
Intriguingly, the expression of the closely related group 2c
WRKYs HvWRKY13, OsWRKY23, AtWRKY43 and
AtWRKY56 was highly correlated and strongly increased
in seed stages compared to leaves (Figure 4 and 5). From
this we can conclude that these four WRKY genes are of
high general importance in all of the three plants for seed
development as the comparative organs, siliques and caryopses or infructescences, differ greatly in their structure
and composition.

Discussion
In this study we present the annotation of 45 members of
the WRKY gene family in barley and classify them according to the WRKY groups 1 to 3 (Figures 1 and 2, Table 1).
Comparison to the total number of WRKYs in Arabidopsis
and rice (Table 2) allowed us to identify about 50% of all
barley WRKY genes. This is in accordance with a study by
Ryu and colleagues [6] who found EST sequences for 44%
of all OsWRKY genes.
In order to transfer the knowledge of WRKY function in
Arabidopsis and rice to barley, we created a phylogenetic
tree including the WRKY protein sequences of all three
species. For example, AtWRKY7 (group 2d) has been
shown to bind to calmodulin in a Ca2+- dependent manner by a calmodulin-binding domain (CaMBD), which
has been found in all other group 2d WRKY proteins of
Arabidopsis [34]. Following our phyogenetic analysis,
HvWRKY9 is the ortholog of AtWRKY7 (Additional File 2)
and might therefore have similar calmodulin-binding
capacity. Even though the current sequence of HvWRKY9
does not span the CaMBD, we could identify such a
CaMBD for HvWRKY7 and HvWRKY10 which are members of the same subclade. Also, a sequence alignment of

Figure 5 of selected barley WRKY genes (HvWRKY) and their designate orthologs in Arabidopsis (AtWRKY) or rice (OsWRKY)
Expression
Expression of selected barley WRKY genes (HvWRKY) and their designate orthologs in Arabidopsis (AtWRKY)
or rice (OsWRKY). The normalized fold difference (upper diagram) of the signal intensities of each amplicon has been calculated from the RT-PCR experiments (lower diagram) to estimate the expression trajectories of WRKY genes relative to its
Actin controls over three different organs in three plant species. RT-PCR analysis (lower panels) with mRNA of barley, Arabidopsis and rice isolated from homologous organs (roots, left; leaves, middle; infructescence, right).

ingly, although most identified WRKY clades have at least
one member involved in pathogen stress, none of the
group 2d HvWRKY genes displayed significant changes in
expression levels upon powdery mildew infection (Figure
3). This underlines the uniformity of group 2d HvWRKY
proteins, and also leads to the speculation whether these
HvWRKY proteins are impaired in the regulation of pathogen response in a calmodulin-binding dependent manner.
For rice and Arabidopsis members of WRKY group 2a an
involvement in the response to fungal pathogens has been
demonstrated [6,38]. Recently, HvWRKY1 and HvWRKY2
have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the response to the fungal pathogen Blumeria

graminis [8]. Our alignment tree indicates the existence of
two further group 2a WRKY proteins in barley, HvWRKY3
and HvWRKY23, which therefore are also potential regulators of pathogen response. In fact, the expression levels
of all group 2a HvWRKY genes alter upon powdery mildew infection (Figure 3). Interestingly, three out of six rice
members of the monocot-specific subclade of group 2c
having AtWRKY50 as a basal member show increased
expression levels upon infection with the fungus Magnaporthe grisea [6]. The same is true for at least two other
2c barley members, namely HvWRKY5 and HvWRKY20,
which show changes in expression levels in Blumeria
graminis challenged leaves (Figure 3). This could indicate
that the diversification of this particular subclade of
WRKY transcription factors might have occurred in

response to pathogen stress. As all identified pathogenresponsive OsWRKYs (OsWRKY7, -10, -67) so far have
corresponding orthologs in barley, these proteins are also
potential regulators of pathogen response.
Xie and co-workers [39] showed synergistic interactions of
OsWRKY71 (group 2a) and OsWRKY51 (group 2d) in regulation of Amy32b gene expression in rice aleurone cells
and parts of their work was used for a comparative analysis in barley, where HvWRKY1 (HvWRKY38) was shown
to be involved in regulating Amy32b expression [32]. In
fact, based on our alignment, OsWRKY71 and HvWRKY1
were shown to be putative orthologs. However, an interaction partner of HvWRKY1 with functional similarities to
OsWRKY51 has not been described so far [32], although
one may postulate that the ortholog to OsWRKY51,
HvWRKY10, constitutes a good candidate as an interaction partner to HvWRKY1. In summary, the sequence
comparison of WRKY proteins of different species aids in
assigning functions to different WRKY proteins and allows
for target-oriented hypothesis testing.
Microarray-based studies have become a highly valuable
source for functional genomics [40] and huge publicly
available datasets allow scientists to monitor the expression of their genes of interest. In this study, we performed
a cross-species expression analysis using the microarray
data of developmental studies in barley and Arabidopsis
[36,37]. We considered similarities in expression profiles
as an indicator for conserved functional similarities of
orthologous genes. Our study was limited by the fact that
only 20 of the HvWRKY genes and 61 of the AtWRKY
genes are represented by probesets on the respective
microarrays. Also, there was an obvious risk of not comparing true orthologs as only about 50% of all HvWRKY
genes could be identified (Table 2). Although cultivation
of barley and Arabidopsis plants differed, the homologous organs we considered are known to harbor plant lineage-specific functions (see [36,37]); we observed an
average positive Pearson correlation of +0.24 in the gene
expression of putative WRKY orthologs between these two
species (Table 4, Figure 4). This is consistent with the
results of genome-wide expression comparisons of five
developmental stages of Arabidopsis and rice, which
returned correlation coefficients in the same range [41].
Similarly, a comparative study of the expression of members of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors in
Arabidopsis and rice indicates conserved expression patterns of orthologs in four corresponding plant organs
[42], further indicating that protein function is likely conserved between homologous organs. When only considering the best pairing WRKY orthologs, the average Pearson
correlation for gene expression increased to +0.37. This is
mostly due to a reduction in the number of putatively
orthologous gene-pairs exhibiting no correlation (Addi-

tional File 5). Several reasons can be suggested which
might explain why some of these putative orthologs of
barley and Arabidopsis show random or negatively correlated expression profiles. First, the function of the orthologous WRKY genes might have changed during evolution,
mirrored by changes in expression patterns. Moreover, the
expression of these WRKY genes might not be related to
any developmental processes and instead are only activated upon abiotic and biotic stresses. Since the limitation
of identifying orthologs between barley and Arabidopsis
was based on the available barley EST data, it is possible
that a better HvWRKY ortholog may exist for each
AtWRKY in our current assignment. It is possible, therefore, that poor correlations observed in this study could
be improved once more EST or genomic sequence is available. Nevertheless, the current phylogenetic assignments
cover and establish a solid orthology for future studies.
In this study we have shown the potential value of comparative expression analysis between sequenced model
species and non-sequenced species of high economic
impact. Nowadays, microarrays for several nonsequenced crop species are commercially available. Thus,
the reported combination of phylogenetic and expressional analysis may offer a valuable tool for future studies
and may contribute to the understanding of gene functions in these crops.

Conclusion
The basis for deriving orthology between related proteins
of different plant species is their degree in similarity. Here,
we could provide that this orthology is not restricted to
sequence similarities alone but reaches out to orthology
in expression patterns. We speculate that this observation
is not restricted to the WRKY proteins based on observations made in studies of other gene families. Nonetheless,
the combination of phylogenetic characterization of
HvWRKY genes and the subsequent comparative expression analysis of orthologous genes in Arabidopsis provides a solid basis for further comparative functional
genomics studies of this gene family in the cereal crop barley.

Methods
Database search and sequence annotation
To find ESTs coding for WRKY proteins in barley (Hordeum vulgare) we performed a tBLASTn search [43,44] on
the NCBI dbEST dataset for barley [25]. The WRKY
domain sequences of seven Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) WRKY family members (AtWRKY1,18, 6, 8, 7 14 and
30) each representing one of the WRKY subgroups
described by Eulgem et al. [16] were used as query
sequences. Blast default settings were used except the low
complexity filter was deselected. The 142 best hits were
processed further. To confirm that the obtained cDNA

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:194

sequences encoded WRKY proteins, the nucleotide
sequences were translated into amino acid sequences,
which were then examined for the existence of the heptapeptide WRKYGEK and its variations [20] 20 sequences
were removed as they did not contain any WRKY
sequence. The remaining ESTs were aligned using ClustalW [45,46] and manually screened for redundant
sequences, finally resulting in 45 unique WRKY protein
coding sequences. The 45 sequences were used as query
sequences in a BLASTn search against PlantGDB's EST
assemblies (called PUT), in order to obtain maximum
sequence length each cDNA from overlapping ESTs
[47,48].
A keyword search on NCBI returned 7 mRNA and one
genomic sequence of the species Hordeum vulgare [GenBank:AJ536667, GenBank:AJ853838 GenBank:AJ853839,
GenBank:AJ853840, GenBank:AJ853841, GenBank:
AJ853842, GenBank:AY323206, GenBank:AY541586].
Multiple sequence alignment revealed that we had identified an EST representing all of them. To create a uniform
nomenclature with constitutive numbering, the
sequences annotated as "Hordeum vulgare mRNA for
putative WRKY protein" 2 [GenBank:AJ853838] and 5
[GenBank:AJ853841] were named HvWRKY2 and 5,
respectively. The GenBank sequence AY541586 ("Hordeum vulgare WRKY transcription factor (wrky38) gene")
was published as HvWRKY-38 [31] and is identical with
the "Hordeum vulgare mRNA for putative WRKY1 protein" [GenBank:AJ536667]. We named both sequences
HvWRKY1 and did not annotate any sequence as
"HvWRKY38" to prevent confusion. Sequences "Hordeum vulgare partial mRNA for putative WRKY3 protein"
[GenBank:AJ853839] and "Hordeum vulgare partial
mRNA
for
putative
WRKY4
protein"
[GenBank:AJ853840] showed 100% nucleotide sequence similarity to longer EST sequences which were consequently
annotated as HvWRKY3 [GenBank:EF488104] and
HvWRKY4 [GenBank:EF488105]. The sequence "Hordeum vulgare partial mRNA for putative WRKY6 protein"
[GenBank:AJ853842] had been annotated with a single Cterminal WRKY domain. We extended the sequence to the
N-terminal WRKY domain by sequencing and annotated
the sequence as HvWRKY6 [GenBank:EF488106]. The
sequence "Hordeum vulgare SUSIBA2 (susiba2) mRNA"
[GenBank:AY323206] [15] was named HvWRKY46. All
remaining identified barley WRKY sequences were annotated on NCBI as HvWRKY7 to -37 and HvWRKY39 to -45
(see Table 1 for accession numbers).
Phylogenetic analysis
To gain insights into the evolutionary relationships of barley WRKY proteins and WRKY proteins of Arabidopsis and
rice (Oryza sativa) we performed multiple alignments of
the species WRKY proteins. Pairwise alignment using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/194

NCBI blastP [47] was used for paraphyletic grouping of
HvWRKY36, HvWRKY6 and OsWRKY82 into their respective WRKY groups. Sequence information for 72 Arabidopsis WRKY proteins (AtWRKY) and 81 rice WRKY
proteins (OsWRKY [21]) was retrieved from NCBI. WRKY
proteins of Physcomitrella patens [GenBank:AAL78681,
GenBank:ABI64128 GenBank: ABI64129, GenBank:
ABI64130, GenBank: ABI64131, GenBank: ABI64132,
GenBank: ABI64133, GenBank: ABI64134, GenBank:
ABI64135, GenBank: ABI64136], Giardia lamblia [GenBank: XM_765980] and Dictyostelium discoideum [GenBank: XM_638694] as well as zinc-finger domains of three
additional members of the WRKY- GCM1superfamily,
namely Arabidopsis Mutator-like transposase [GenBank:
AAC97215], Homo sapiens CRA a FLYWCH-type zinc finger 1 [GenBank: EAW85450] and Mus musculus FLYWCHtype zinc finger 1 [GenBank: AAH38031] were included to
form basal outgroups. The 60 amino acid spanning WRKY
core domain [16] of all proteins was used to create multiple protein sequence alignments using ClustalW [45,46].
Default settings were applied for the alignment in Figure
1. For Additional Figure 1, default settings were used
except for using a PAM matrix, a gap opening penalty of 2
and a gap extension penalty of 0.05. The phylogenetic
trees in Figure 2 and Additional File 2 were strict consensus trees of up to 200 000 trees calculated with three different programs, ClustalW [46], Phylip [49] and PAUP
[50], which all resulted in identical tree topologies. Bootstrap values have been calculated from 1000 iterations
using Phylip [49]. Phylogenetic trees were drawn using
TreeView software version 1.6.6 [51]. The tree in Additional Figure 2 was rooted with the zinc finger domain of
Arabidopsis mutator-like transposase (AtMutTrans) [GenBank:AAC97215] as outgroup.
Microarray based expression analysis
For expression analysis, publicly available microarray data
of the Affymetrix Barley1 GeneChip were used. The annotations of the Barley1 GeneChip were updated by the HarvEST database [52]. In order to identify probe sets for the
barley WRKY genes described in this study, BLAST
searches against the Barley1 GeneChip assemblies were
performed on the Affymetrix Netaffx website [53]. For 20
of the characterized WRKY genes, probesets could be
assigned unambiguously. HvWRKY2 and HvWRKY46 are
represented by three and two probesets, respectively, so
that a total number of 23 probesets was used to examine
the expression of barley WRKY genes. Additional
probesets which – according to the HarvEST annotations
– have rice or Arabidopsis WRKY genes as best matches
were not considered further as they could not be specifically related to any barley EST. The Affymetrix CEL files of
powdery mildew treatment experiments (accession numbers BB4 and BB7) as well as the developmental baseline

(accession number BB3 [36]) were downloaded from BarleyBase [27,28].

DNA-free kit (Ambion). RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Fisher Scientific).

Affymetrix CEL files of the developmental baseline of Arabidopsis [37] were retrieved from TAIR accession number
ME00319 [54]. Analysis of microarray data was performed using GeneSpring software version 7 [55].

RT-PCR
A two-step semi-quantitative RT-PCR method was used to
measure gene expression. First strand cDNA synthesis was
performed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen) on 2 – 5 µg total mRNA and oligo dT primers
(Invitrogen). The relative amount of gene expression for
different WRKY genes was determined within linear
amplification ranges. One or two microliters cDNA template (equivalent to 50 and 100 ng RNA) were used for
each PCR. Number of cycles used and primer sequences
for WRKY gene and Actin controls are listed in Additional
File 6.

A per-Chip normalization to the median was applied to
obtain comparability. The arrays were adjusted for background optical noise using sequence dependent robust
multi-array averaging (GC-RMA) software [56] and normalized using quantile normalization. From the resulting
signal intensities, fold change values were calculated.
Expression data were extracted for homologous plant
organs (1 – 10) for barley and Arabidopsis, respectively: 1
(coleoptile/cotyledon), 2 (mesocotyl/hypocotyl), 3 (radicule/seedling roots), 4 (leaf/leaf), 5 (root/root), 6 (inflorescence/inflorescence), 7 (anthers/stamen), 8 (caryopsis
5dpa/seed stage 6), 9 (caryopsis 10dpa/seed stage 8) and
10 (caryopsis 15dpa/seed stage 10).
The correlation for gene expression levels between corresponding organs from barley and Arabidopsis were analyzed by calculating the Pearson correlation of the
normalized signal intensities with the Microsoft Excel statistical analysis tools. As a control, the signal intensities of
100 randomly chosen probesets of the Barley1 GeneChip
were compared to 100 randomly chosen Arabidopsis
genes represented by the ATH1 GeneChip. For both comparisons, the average correlation was calculated. Student's
t-test was used to obtain the statistical significance of the
difference in correlation of the two datasets.
Plant material
Barley and Arabidopsis (Catania-0) plants were grown in
10 cm pots in soil in the green house (long day; ~24°C;
40% rel. humidity). Rice, Oryza sativa japonica cv. Nipponbare, was grown in 60 cm pots in water logged soil in the
green house (long day; ~27°C; ~70% rel humidity)
RNA extraction
Leaf and root plant material from four week old barley
and rice plants was harvested at the middle of the day.
Infructescences were harvested at the age of eleven days
post anthesis. Tissues of Arabidopsis were harvested from
three-week-old Catania-0 plants. Plant material was
pooled from several plants. Total RNA was isolated
according to the RNAqueous system (Ambion; barley) or
Trizol (Invitrogen; Arabidopsis and rice) following the
manufacturers' recommendations. Plant RNA isolation
Aid solution (Ambion) was added to all samples. After
extraction, the samples were DNase treated using the

Signal intensities of each of the RT-PCR amplicons have
been quantified using KODAK Molecular Imaging Systems and Software. Normalized signal intensities have
been calculated by dividing the intensity for each WRKY
gene by the intensity of its respective Actin control signal.
Normalized fold intensities were calculated for reasons of
comparison from the normalized signal intensities
divided by the average of the normalized signal intensities
of the three organs (mean expression intensity).
Sequencing Barley WRKY genes
Multiple sequence alignments indicated, that EST
sequences BU990739 and BM370186 might possibly represent parts of the C-terminal and the N-terminal WRKY
domains of HvWRKY6. To obtain the interjacent
sequence, a PCR was performed with HvWRKY6 forward
primer 5'-GCATATTCAGAAGGGCTGCCGAG-3' and
HvWRKY6
reverse
primer
5'-CTGCCCATACTTACGCCATCTG-3'.

Sequence information of the WRKY domain for
HvWRKY9 was available (CB879962) and multiple alignments indicated that HvWRKY9 belonged to the subgroup
of HARF-domain containing WRKY proteins (for HARF
sequence information, see [16]). To extend the sequence
further to the N-terminus towards the HARF domain, a
PCR was performed with HvWRKY9 forward primer: 5'AATGGCAGACAAGGCCATGCTAGG-3' and HvWRKY9
reverse primer 5'- ATACTTCCGCCACGAGAATTCA-3'. In
a sequencing approach, DNA of barley leaves was isolated
using a protocol by Edwards et al. [57,58] and treated with
RNase H. PCR was performed with Phusion-Polymerase
according to the manufacturer's recommendations
(Finnzymes). The PCR products were gel-purified and
cloned into a pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for
sequencing at 4BaseLab (Reutlingen/Germany).
