Abstract
Background: The current versions of the COG and arCOG databases, both excellent
frameworks for studies in comparative and functional genomics, do not contain the nucleotide
sequences corresponding to their protein or protein domain entries.
Results: Using sequence information obtained from GenBank flat files covering the completely
sequenced genomes of the COG and arCOG databases, we constructed NUCOCOG (nucleotide
sequences containing COG databases) as an extended version including all nucleotide sequences
and in addition the amino acid sequences originally utilized to construct the current COG and
arCOG databases. We make available three comprehensive single XML files containing the
complete databases including all sequence information. In addition, we provide a web interface as
a utility suitable to browse the NUCOCOG database for sequence retrieval. The database is
accessible at http://www.uni-wh.de/nucocog.
Conclusion: NUCOCOG offers the possibility to analyze any sequence related property in the
context of the COG and arCOG framework simply by using script languages such as PERL applied
to a large but single XML document.

Background
The concept originally introduced by Tatusov et al. in
1997 [1] to assign protein sequences based on sequence
similarities to COGs led to the establishment of the COG
database which was updated repeatedly when more and
more completely sequenced genomes became available
[2-4]. During the last decade, the COG database became a
distinguished tool in comparative and functional genomics [5]. The recently published Archaeal Clusters of
Orthologous Genes (arCOG) are a refinement and update
of archaeal sequences using a new sophisticated computational pipeline [6]. However, although the original protein sequences used to construct the databases are

available via FTP [7,8], there are no direct assignments of
protein or protein domain sequences to entries within the
databases, and nucleotide sequences are completely
absent. Since the COG and arCOG databases are excellent
frameworks to study sequence specific aspects such as
amino acid composition, GC content, codon usage or the
like in both a functional and a phylogenetic context, versions including sequence information directly linked to
every protein or protein domain were a desirable
improvement. Here we present the latest update of the
COG database, the arCOG database, and a combination
of them as XML files (nucocog.xml, arnucocog.xml, and
nucocog_2.xml, respectively) (Figs 1 and 2) that include

Construction and content
Construction of the NUCOCOG database
The NUCOCOG database (nucocog.xml) was constructed
by repeatedly running a set of different PERL scripts to
read, create and manipulate files containing ASCII data.
All files containing the information required to create the
NUCOCOG database were obtained via FTP from the
NCBI. Three files related to the COG-database (whog,
myva, myva=gb) were taken from [7] and 159 GBK files
containing the genome information of the 66 organisms
currently present in the COG database were taken from
[9]. To obtain a maximum quality of nucleotide
sequences we used current GBK files rather than the outdated ones corresponding to the original protein

sequences. In principle, this may lead to errors due to the
methods described below. However, those errors are very
improbable and, if occurring at all, are negligible compared to all the ambiguous amino acids and nucleotides
present even in current GBK versions (see table 1). The
NUCOCOG database was built up by the following five
main procedures: (i) The complete COG database as
assembled in whog, was converted to an XML file which
served as the scaffold that was subsequently stepwise
extended to eventually represent the final NUCOCOG
database. (ii) The amino acid sequences were extracted
from myva by searching for their respective protein names
as the unambiguous search keys. (iii) In the same manner,
GI-numbers for all complete protein sequences were
obtained from myva=gb. However, no protein fragments
(domains) at all could be detected because their names
are extended by an underscore followed by a consecutive
number in whog which is not the case in myva=gb. We

derived GI-numbers for those entries during a second run
after the extensions of their names were truncated. (iv)
Nucleotide sequences were then included separately for
each of the 66 organisms by exclusively searching for
organism specific sequences only in GBK files associated
with the respective query organism. The amino acid
sequences as annotated in myva were used as search keys
to locate their corresponding nucleotide sequences in the
GBK files. To detect all sequences, it was necessary to
apply four different search approaches. The vast majority
(98.4 %) of all nucleotide sequences were extracted by
searching for matching amino acid sequences as annotated in the GBK files. Because some of the GBK files used
in this work have been updated since the latest release of
the COG database not every sequence could be detected
by this method. We discovered additional sequences (1.4
%) by searching for matches with conceptual translated
nucleotide sequences. Those sequences were located and
their reading frames were determined according to the
CDS information in the respective GBK file. In addition,
the nucleotide sequences were extended by 300 adjacent
nucleotides derived from the genome sequence in both
directions prior to translation. Further sequences (0.1 %)
could be found by searching for matching amino acid
sequences in translations of whole genomes in all six reading frames. The residual 121 missing nucleotide
sequences were included by manually editing the first
qualifiers of the CDS feature key in the respective GBG file
followed by a further search in conceptually translated
nucleotide sequences. To inspect and edit GBK files, the
genome annotation tool ARTEMIS [10,11] was used in
combination with the pairwise sequence alignment soft-

ware JAligner [12]. Mainly, we deleted annotated
frameshifts, included new frameshifts and in some cases
replaced mismatching amino acids by using coding information of the nearest matching amino acid sequence
within the same reading frame. For each nucleotide
sequence the respective mapping method was included to
the XML-files i. e."original CDS", "extension of original
CDS", "conceptual translation of whole genome", or "created or edited CDS manually". (v) After this first version
of the complete NUCOGOG database had been finished,
some PERL scripts were run for verification and validation
purposes with the main focus on translating the nucleotide sequences and comparing the translations to their
respective annotations. For four entries (MK0324,
MK0315, MK0689, MK0809) even the manual search for
more information e. g. by BLAST [13] assigned no GInumber and we adopted the entry "gi?" from myva=gb.
Construction of the arNUCOCOG database
The arNUCOCOG database (arnucocog.xml) was essentially constructed as described above using the information from ar40.fa and arCOG.csv [8] to build the initial
XML-file. The current version of arCOGs includes the
genome of Thermoproteus tenax which has not been published at the time of its release and by request of the
sequencing consortium those proteins were removed
from the ar40.fa file and are also not contained in the
arNUCOCOG database. In addition, 34 sequences listed
in arCOG.csv could not be located in ar40.fa. These proteins for various reasons were not translated and the
authors detected them by tBLASTn, using an orthologous
sequence from a close relative as a query (Kira Makarova,
personal communication). We included those sequences
manually by reproducing her work. Searching for matching amino acid sequences in the GBK files resulted in
including 99.8 % of all nucleotide sequences. The remaining sequences were detected by the alternative methods
described above and only three sequences needed to be
searched manually. Many of the arCOGs are new and consequently not assigned to a classical COG-number. In all
those cases, we included "NO_COG" between the respective tags. Because arCOG.csv contains protein gi-numbers
as the domain-ids, no unique domain-ids are assigned to
all split sequences. We improved this situation by adding
consecutively numbered suffixes to those gi-numbers separated by an underscore e.g. <DOMAINNAME>11843083
9_1</DOMAINNAME>.
Combining NUCOCOG with arNUCOCOG
(NUCOCOG_2)
We also combined NUCOCOG and arNUCOCOG resulting in nucocog_2.xml. For that purpose, we removed all
sequences from the 13 archaeal genomes from NUCOCOG and included all data from arNUCOCOG instead. In
addition, we added those sequences from ar40.fa that

according to the information from arCOG.csv are
assigned to classical COGs but are not part of any arCOG.
Finally, for those amino acid sequences their corresponding nucleotide sequences were included as described
above and "NO_COG" was written between the arCOGtags.
Content of the NUCOCOG database
The content of the three database files is summarized in
table 1. As can be seen, some nucleotide sequences contain stop codons within coding regions and there are both
ambiguous amino acids (a. a. a.) and ambiguous nucleotides (a. n.). Consequently, in those cases a distinct
translation of a codon to an amino acid is impossible. For
that reason, although resulting in larger database files
containing redundancies, we did not delete the amino
acid sequences from our files after the databases had been
constructed.

Utility
Most of the users will probably use the set of databases
according to the aim we primarily constructed it for:i. e. by
downloading the XML files and analyzing them with
respect to their own research questions and their individually developed software tools. Nevertheless, we also provide a web based utility to browse the databases for
sequence retrieval by COG-number, arCOG-number, protein name, and GI-number. For that purpose, we used the
Apache HTTP Server and an SQL backend. The XML files
were converted to tables of an SQL database, one for all
COG data and the other ones for the nucleotide and
amino acid sequences, respectively. The names of the protein or protein domains were used as unique keys. Queries
can be made by using the frontend written in PHP providing the option to select certain entries for displaying their
corresponding amino acid and nucleotide sequences.

Discussion
The COG and arCOG databases represent excellent collections of proteins (or protein domains). The version presented here including amino acid and nucleotide
sequences allows answering all sequence related questions with respect to orthologous proteins i. e. proteins
that are assumed to exhibit identical functions. For
instance, one may ask whether enzymes involved in a certain metabolic pathway have constraints in their amino
acid composition. This is described for enzymes involved
in tryptophan biosynthesis since the 5 protein chains of
the E. coli trp operon contain only 5 tryptophan residues
[14]. Indeed, the "cognate bias hypothesis" stating that
early in evolutionary history the biosynthetic enzymes for
amino acid Ã gradually lost residues of Ã [15] could elegantly be tested using the NUCOCOG files presented
here. Questions related to deviations of nucleotide
sequence compositions such as codon usage or GC-con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/479

tent in dependence on the functions of the respective proteins could also be answered by exploring the XML files
provided here. Furthermore, the COG framework had
proved to be a powerful tool in conjunction with phylogenetic protein sequence distributions [16,17]. The possibility to examine clade specific features of nucleotide or
amino acid sequences within the COG context could also
uncover more precise data than those made available by
simply comparing the sequences of whole genomes. For
example, there are several studies dealing with differences
in sequence specific properties between (hyper)thermophiles and mesophiles by comparing the sequence
data of their complete genomes [18-20]. Those surveys do
not account for possible differences in sequence signatures that depend solely on the function of the respective
protein rather than the phylogenetic relationship of the
organisms under investigation. To refine such studies,
only proteins derived from different organisms but exhibiting identical biochemical functions should be compared
on a large scale rather than just comparing complete
genomes. With that intention we constructed NUCOCOG
and our future work will exactly deal with the refinement
described here of detecting thermophile-specific sequence
signatures considering possible distortions due to comparing functionally different proteins.

Conclusion
NUCOCOG is a version of the current COG and arCOG
databases assembled in single XML files containing both
amino acid and nucleotide sequences associated to their
respective entries. In depth analysis of this XML files
makes it possible to investigate any sequence specific
property in the COG context, taking into account functional and phylogenetic relationships.
