Abstract
Background: Inteins are self-splicing protein elements. They are translated as inserts within host
proteins that excise themselves and ligate the flanking portions of the host protein (exteins) with
a peptide bond. They are encoded as in-frame insertions within the genes for the host proteins.
Inteins are found in all three domains of life and in viruses, but have a very sporadic distribution.
Only a small number of intein coding sequences have been identified in eukaryotic nuclear genes,
and all of these are from ascomycete or basidiomycete fungi.
Results: We identified seven intein coding sequences within nuclear genes coding for the second
largest subunits of RNA polymerase. These sequences were found in diverse eukaryotes: one is in
the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase I (RPA2) from the ascomycete fungus Phaeosphaeria
nodorum, one is in the RNA polymerase III (RPC2) of the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum and
four intein coding sequences are in RNA polymerase II genes (RPB2), one each from the green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the zygomycete fungus Spiromyces aspiralis and the chytrid fungi
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Coelomomyces stegomyiae. The remaining intein coding sequence
is in a viral relic embedded within the genome of the oomycete Phytophthora ramorum. The
Chlamydomonas and Dictyostelium inteins are the first nuclear-encoded inteins found outside of the
fungi.
These new inteins represent a unique dataset: they are found in homologous proteins that form a
paralogous group. Although these paralogues diverged early in eukaryotic evolution, their
sequences can be aligned over most of their length. The inteins are inserted at multiple distinct
sites, each of which corresponds to a highly conserved region of RNA polymerase. This dataset
supports earlier work suggesting that inteins preferentially occur in highly conserved regions of
their host proteins.
Conclusion: The identification of these new inteins increases the known host range of intein
sequences in eukaryotes, and provides fresh insights into their origins and evolution. We conclude
that inteins are ancient eukaryote elements once found widely among microbial eukaryotes. They
persist as rarities in the genomes of a sporadic array of microorganisms, occupying highly conserved
sites in diverse proteins.

Background
An intein (internal protein) is a protein sequence that is
translated as an insertion within a host protein. The intein
is then post-translationally excised, simultaneous with the
ligation of the two flanking segments of the host protein
[1-7]. The result of intein excision is two proteins derived
from a single initial translation product: (i) the free intein
sequence, and (ii) the mature form of the host protein,
with the two halves (the N-terminal and C-terminal external proteins, or exteins) ligated by a peptide bond. The
reactions in which the intein is excised from the precursor
protein and the flanking exteins are joined are mediated
primarily by the intein itself, although the first residue of
the C-extein also has an important role. The term intein
strictly refers to a protein molecule, but the gene segment
encoding the intein is also often referred to as an intein.
In addition to containing sequences necessary for their
excision and the splicing of their flanking exteins, many
inteins have a homing endonuclease domain. Inteins carrying such domains are often referred to as full-length
inteins. Some inteins lack a homing endonuclease
domain, containing only those sequences necessary for
their excision and extein splicing. These are known as
mini-inteins. Most of the homing endonuclease domains
found in full-length inteins belong to the LAGLIDADG
family [5]. Homing endonucleases are believed to promote the spread of an intein through the gene pool of the
host species via a recombination process (homing). In a
diploid cell heterozygous for the intein, cleavage of the
empty allele by the homing endonuclease will be followed by DNA repair performed by the host repair
machinery, using the occupied allele as a template [8].
This will result in the cell becoming homozygous for the
intein. In this way, the intein gene is duplicated and can
spread throughout a population. Most inteins have no
known function, and thus are considered to be selfish or
parasitic elements [9]. However, inteins are efficiently
removed from the host protein [10-14], so their effect on
the host phenotype is minimal.
The homing pathway is dependent on the homing endonuclease recognition of the target site and on the allelic
homology of the surrounding sequences. If an intein
homing endonuclease were to cut an ectopic site, this
would not precipitate homologous recombination (gene
conversion) of the intein sequence because of the lack of
flanking homology. For this reason, it is apparently very
difficult for inteins to move to (or colonise) a new site,
and such ectopic movement is likely to be a very rare
event. This belief is supported by the finding that allelic
inteins (i.e. inteins inserted at corresponding sites in
homologous genes), even in distantly related species, are
usually more closely related to each other than they are to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/38

non-allelic inteins, including those from the same species
[5,9,15].
Inteins are rarities, and have a puzzling distribution
among genes and species: the majority of species do not
carry any known inteins, while some species have many;
for example, the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii has 19
distinct inteins. The species that carry inteins do not cluster together on evolutionary trees, but are phylogenetically dispersed, and closely related species do not
necessarily have similar sets of inteins. Inteins have only
been found in microorganisms. The vast majority of genes
have no known inteins, but some genes contain multiple
inteins. For instance, replication factor C of M. jannaschii
contains three distinct inteins [16] and a ribonucleotide
reductase of Trichodesmium erythraeum contains four [13].
Of the more than 80 distinct (non-allelic) inteins
described, most (>75%) are found in genes involved in
replication or transcription, such as DNA polymerases
and helicases, or in related processes such as the metabolism of nucleotides (together these genes could be said to
have information-processing functions).
The reasons behind the unusual distribution of inteins are
currently unknown. One possible explanation for their
phylogenetic distribution is that inteins were formerly
much more widespread than they are now, but over time
they have been randomly lost on many independent occasions in different lineages, resulting in their current sporadic appearances [9]. It is also possible that their
distribution is partly a result of horizontal transfer (that is,
movement between species that might be only distantly
related). The predominance of inteins in informationprocessing genes may reflect the horizontal transfer of
inteins via virus infection [17]. The genomes of phage and
viruses consist predominantly of genes involved in information processing. It is possible that the pattern of multiple coincident insertions is also a reflection of the inteins
occurring predominantly in the subset of genes that are
common to cellular organisms and their infecting viruses.
Three of the allelic intein groups have members that are
genomic and viral. For example, RIR1-l allelic inteins are
found in eubacteria, eubacterial phages and the eukaryote
iridescent viruses, DnaB-b allelic inteins are present in
eubacteria and their phages, while Pol-c allelic inteins are
found in archaea and in eukaryote viruses (mimivirus and
the Heterosigma akashiwo virus (HaV)).
In total, five distinct inteins have been found in eukaryotic
nuclear genes. These appear in the VMA1 gene that
encodes a subunit of a vacuolar membrane adenosine triphosphatase [10,18]; PRP8, encoding an essential component of the spliceosome [19]; GLT1, glutamate synthase
[20]; CHS2, chitin synthase 2 [20]; and ThrRS, threonyl
tRNA synthetase (submitted by S. Pietrokovski to InBase

[6]). All of these nuclear-encoded inteins have been found
exclusively in fungi. VMA inteins have been found in a
variety of hemiascomycete yeasts, including Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida tropicalis. The
PRP8 intein was first found in the basidiomycete fungus
Cryptococcus neoformans [19]. Since then, PRP8 inteins
have been found in some additional Cryptococcus species
(C. gattii and C. laurentii) [21] and in a variety of ascomycete fungi, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Histoplasma capsulatum and Botrytis cinerea [14,22] and in three species of
Penicillium [23]. GLT1 inteins have been identified in a
small number of ascomycetes (Debaryomyces hansenii,
Pichia guilliermondii, Podospora anserina and Phaeosphaeria
nodorum). The CHS2 intein has been found in only one
species, P. anserina, despite a large number of fungal
CHS2 gene sequences being available in GenBank.
Finally, the fifth eukaryotic nuclear full-length intein
gene, ThrRS, was very recently identified in the ascomycete yeast C. tropicalis (Pietrokovski, InBase [6]). An allelic
mini-intein is also found in the closely related yeast Candida parapsilosis. In addition to these nuclear intein genes,
three intein genes have been found in chloroplast
genomes: there are allelic inteins in the DnaB helicase
genes of the chloroplasts of the cryptophyte alga Guillardia
theta [24] and the red alga Porphyra purpurea [25], and a
distinct intein in the ClpP protease gene of the chloroplasts of the green alga Chlamydomonas eugametos [26,27].
Furthermore, inteins have been identified in viruses of
eukaryotes: allelic inteins have been found in the DNA
polymerase B genes of Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus
[28] and HaV01 [17]. A distinct full-length intein appears
in the RIR1 gene of Chilo iridescent virus [29,30], with two
other insect iridoviruses (Costelytra zealandica iridescent
virus and Wiseana iridescent virus) containing allelic
mini-inteins (Pietrokovski, InBase [6]). We have detected
an intein in a helicase of PBCV (Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus; PBCV) NY2A that is not present in the homologous sites of other PBCV strains (authors' unpublished
data and InBase [6]).
DNA-dependent RNA polymerases are complex proteins
consisting of several polypeptides including two large and
several smaller subunits [31]. Eukaryote nuclei generally
encode three RNA polymerases: RNA polymerase I synthesizes a pre-rRNA, 45S, which matures into 28S, 18S and
5.8S rRNAs that will form the major RNA sections of the
ribosome. RNA polymerase II synthesizes precursors of
messenger RNAs and most small nuclear RNAs. RNA
polymerase III synthesizes transfer RNAs, 5S ribosomal
RNAs and other small RNAs found in the nucleus and
cytoplasm. Some of the various subunits of the different
RNA polymerases (including the two largest subunits) are
encoded by genes that are homologous (paralogous)
throughout cellular life. Some viruses also contain homologous genes encoding their own RNA polymerase.

Here we report the identification and characterisation of
seven previously undetected intein-coding sequences
from eukaryotic nuclear genomes. These were all identified in genes encoding the second largest subunits of RNA
polymerase. They are inserted at six distinct (non-allelic)
sites. Four were found in fungi (an ascomycete, a zygomycete and two chytrids), one was found in the slime
mould Dictyostelium discoideum, and one in the green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The last was an intein identified in a viral remnant embedded in the nuclear genome
of the oomycete Phytophthora ramorum. Partial sequences
of inteins allelic to this latter intein were also identified in
the RNA polymerase of a strain of the Emiliania huxleyi
virus and in a sequence generated by the Sargasso Sea
Metagenomics Project. Analysis of these intein sequences
leads to insights into the origins and evolution of inteins
in eukaryotes.

Results
Identification of new nuclear intein genes
To identify new eukaryotic intein genes, we used the
sequences of a wide variety of previously identified inteins
(of eukaryotic, prokaryotic and viral origins) to perform
BLAST searches of the publicly available eukaryotic
sequence databases (including GenBank, and genome
sequencing centre databases containing data not yet
released to GenBank; see Methods section). High-quality
matches identified in the BLAST searches, putatively representing new inteins, were then examined in detail for
features characteristic of inteins [15]. For example, most
inteins begin with a Cys or a Ser residue, end with the
dipeptide His-Asn, and are followed by a Cys, Ser or Thr
residue as the first amino acid of the C-extein. Inteins contain a number of conserved motifs associated with splicing, and most inteins contain a homing LAGLIDADG
endonuclease domain. Inteins also appear as specific
inserts within other proteins, and often appear at highly
conserved sites within highly conserved proteins. Another
important indicator of the presence of an intein encoding
sequence is that the sequence is present in some homologues of the host gene, but is absent in most. Table 1
summarises the novel inteins described in this report.
An RNA polymerase I intein in Phaeosphaeria nodorum
P. (Stagonospora) nodorum is a filamentous ascomycete
belonging to the class Dothideomycetes. It is a major
pathogen of wheat crops. Strain SN15 has been sequenced
by the whole genome shotgun method to >10-fold coverage at the Broad Institute [32]. The assembled sequence
has been made publicly available in GenBank. Using the
sequence of the C. eugametos chloroplast Ceu ClpP intein
as a query in a TBLASTN search of the whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequence division of the GenBank database
we detected a high quality match in P. nodorum sequence
AAGI01000064 (E = 3 Ã 10-6; bases 49105â50471). This

sequence can also be found on supercontig 1.4 (from base
pair 1094221 to 1095587) at the Broad Institute website
[32]. The matching region appears as an insert within a
gene encoding the second largest subunit of RNA
polymerase (Figure 1). Sequence comparisons (Figure 1)
and phylogenetic analyses (Figure 2, additional file 1)
indicate that the gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase I. The insert has numerous features indicating that it
encodes an intein. It appears as an insertion within the
RNA polymerase gene and consists of an uninterrupted
open-reading frame (ORF) encoding 455 amino acids, in
phase with the RNA polymerase ORF. The insert begins
with a Cys residue and is followed by a Cys residue. The
N- and C-terminal regions of the insert contain sequences
corresponding to the conserved splicing domains of
inteins (alignments of conserved intein domains can be
viewed at the InBase website [6]). The central region contains the characteristic motifs of an LAGLIDADG homing
endonuclease domain, although this appears to be degenerate and is unlikely to be still active. An unusual feature
of this new intein is that it ends with the dipeptide GlyAsn rather than the more common His-Asn. Gly-Asn termini have, however, been identified previously in inteins,
for instance, in Ceu ClpP and in the ThrRS inteins of C.
tropicalis and C. parapsilosis. This new intein has been
named Pno RPA2, following intein naming conventions.
It is the first intein to be identified in a gene encoding the
second largest subunit of an RNA polymerase. The only
previously identified RNA polymerase inteins (the
archaeal inteins Mja rPol A' and Mja rPol A" from M.
janaschii and Nph rPol A" from Natronomonas pharaonis)
all appear in archaeal homologues of the gene encoding
the largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase.
Note that the sequence AAGI01000064 has a frameshift in
the region corresponding to the intein. Comparisons (not

shown) with the P. nodorum sequences in the GenBank
trace archives, however, suggest that this is a sequencing
error resulting from the insertion of a G residue at position 50225 and a C at 50260. These were removed to generate the full sequence of the RNA polymerase gene with
an uninterrupted ORF.
An RNA polymerase II intein in Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii
C. reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga. An intein in this
species was first detected in several C. reinhardtii expressed
sequence tag (EST) sequences using a TBLASTN search of
the GenBank EST databases with the Ctr ThrRS intein
sequence as a query. A full-length sequence of the intein
was then retrieved from version 2 of the C. reinhardtii
genome sequence assembly, available from the Joint
Genome Institute [33]. The intein lies on scaffold 5, contig 26 (bases 289701â290993 on the minus strand). The
intein, Cre RPB2, appears as an uninterrupted ORF encoding 431 amino acids inserted within the coding region of
the C. reinhardtii gene for the second largest subunit of
RNA polymerase II (Figures 1, 2). Like many other inteins,
it begins with a Cys residue, is followed by a Cys residue
in the C-extein, and contains the conserved splicing
domains and an LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease
domain (see InBase for alignments [6]). Like the Pno RPA
intein, Cre RPB2 ends with a Gly-Asn dipeptide rather
than the more common His-Asn. This is the first intein
encoded in a nuclear genome to be found outside of the
fungi.
Further RNA polymerase II inteins
Three further inteins have been found in genes encoding
the second-largest subunits of RNA polymerase II. The
sequences of these genes were generated as part of the
Assembling the Fungal Tree of Life (AFTOL) project [34],

which is using, among other things, RNA polymerase II
sequences to assist in determining the relationships
among a wide variety of fungi. Inteins appear in RPB2
sequences from Spiromyces aspiralis (DQ302790), a zygomycete fungus, and Coelomomyces stegomyiae (DQ302766)
and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (DQ302769), both
members of the Chytridiomycota. These inteins again
have the conserved splicing and endonuclease domains
characteristic of inteins (see InBase [6]). They also appear
as inserts within the RNA polymerase sequences. The C.
stegomyiae intein, Cst RPB2, and the S. aspiralis intein, Sas
RPB2, are inserted at homologous sites and are therefore
allelic inteins. The B. dendrobatidis intein is inserted at a
different site. Both of these sites are distinct from the
insertion site of the C. reinhardtii RNA polymerase II
intein, Cre RPB2. To distinguish the three intein insertion
sites in RNA polymerase II genes they have been denoted
"a", "b" and "c", according to the order in which they were
identified: Cre RPB2 is in the "a" site, Cst RPB2 and Sas
RPB2 are in the "b" site, and Bde RPB2 is in the "c" site.
The allelic RPB2-b inteins are present in two very distantly
related species, a zygomycete and a chytrid.
An RNA polymerase III intein in Dictyostelium
discoideum
D. discoideum is a slime mould classified within the Mycetozoa. The whole genome sequence has been determined
and described [35]. An intein in D. discoideum was
detected as an insertion of 464 amino acid residues within
the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase III (Figures
1, 2; GenBank protein ID no. EAL63250). The intein, Ddi
RPC2, appears as a specific insert within the RNA
polymerase subunit relative to homologues from other
species, and it is inserted at a different site from the P.
nodorum RNA polymerase I intein and from any of the
RNA polymerase II inteins. The Dictyostelium intein begins
with a Cys residue, ends with a standard His-Asn dipeptide and is followed by a Cys residue. The N- and C-terminal parts contain the conserved splicing domains
characteristic of inteins [6], while the central region contains a possibly degenerate LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease. Ddi RPC2 contains several low-complexity regions
or short runs of the same amino acid. For instance, it contains a region of 13 amino acid residues, of which 11 are
Asn residues. It also contains a region with seven consecutive Asn residues and two regions with seven consecutive
Gln residues. Such low-complexity regions appear to be
common features in D. discoideum proteins [35]. In the D.
discoideum RNA polymerase III protein, they are restricted
to the segment corresponding to the endonuclease
domain of the intein, i.e. they are not found in the intein
splicing domains or in the RNA polymerase sequence.

An RNA polymerase intein in a viral remnant within the
Phytophthora ramorum genome
P. ramorum is a member of the oomycetes, belonging to
the kingdom Stramenopiles, which also includes diatoms,
golden-brown algae and brown algae [36]. The genome
sequence has been determined by the Joint Genome Institute [33,37]. Using the Ceu ClpP intein as a query in a
TBLASTN search, we detected a high quality match (E =
3.0 Ã 10-15) in the P. ramorum genome (scaffold 19, bases
14734â15744 on the minus strand). This sequence has
numerous features suggesting that it is an intein. For
instance, it begins with a Cys residue and contains
sequences similar to the splicing domains of other inteins
(not shown). These are separated by a region containing
an LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease domain similar to
that of previously identified inteins. Immediately
upstream of this putative intein is a long ORF encoding a
putative protein homologous to the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase. The site at which the putative
intein interrupts the RNA polymerase ORF is highly conserved, although it is distinct from the insertion sites of
the previously identified RNA polymerase inteins (Figure
1).

In addition to having these similarities to other inteins,
this putative intein has unusual features. Firstly, instead of
being an uninterrupted ORF, the region encoding the
intein-like sequence contains two frameshift mutations,
which result in the appearance of stop codons within the
coding reading frame. Secondly, although it contains
most of the conserved motifs associated with intein splicing, it lacks the conserved residues (usually a His-Asn
dipeptide) corresponding to the extreme C-terminal ends
of inteins; instead, the corresponding sequence consists of
a stop codon and an Arg codon (see additional file 2).
These features suggest that the sequence no longer represents a functional intein (comparisons with sequences in
the trace archives suggest that most of these are genuine
mutations, although one of the frameshifts within the
intein is likely to be a sequencing error; data not shown).
Likewise, the RNA polymerase gene, in which the putative
intein gene is inserted, has some unusual features. Firstly,
it also appears to be non-functional; about 780 bp
upstream of the intein insertion site, the RNA polymerase
coding sequence contains a frameshift mutation and there
is a nonsense mutation six codons upstream of the putative intein. Secondly, the section of the RNA polymerase
gene expected to lie downstream of the intein gene (i.e.
the coding sequence for the C-extein) is missing (additional file 2). Comparisons with the trace archives suggest
that these are all genuine mutations. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that this degenerate RNA polymerase gene is
not closely related to eukaryotic RNA polymerase I, II or
III genes (Figure 2). Instead, it is most closely related
(100% bootstrap support) to an RNA polymerase from

African swine fever virus (ASFV), a large double-stranded
DNA virus that is a member of the nuclear-cytoplasmic
large dsDNA virus (NCLDV) group [38]. In addition,
three intact genes encoding the second largest subunits of
RNA polymerases I, II and III can be found in the P. ramorum genome (Figure 2). Close relatives (not shown) of
these three genes also appear in the genome sequence of
the related species Phytophthora sojae (also sequenced by
the JGI), but no close relative of the degenerate ASFV-like
RNA polymerase gene is present in the P. sojae genome.
Further analyses of the sequences surrounding this RNA
polymerase gene reveal a likely explanation for its unusual
features; when the predicted products of the ORFs in the
regions close to the RNA polymerase gene are used in
BLASTP searches against the protein sequences in GenBank, the strongest hits are (as with the RNA polymerase
itself) often proteins encoded by ASFV (additional files 3
and 4). Most of these proteins do not have close relatives
in the P. sojae genome. The ORFs further away from the
degenerate RNA polymerase gene, however, do have close
matches in P. sojae, and are not closely related to genes
found in ASFV. It is therefore likely that a previously unidentified virus related to ASFV has integrated into the P.
ramorum genome. This integration would have occurred
after the divergence of the lineages leading to P. ramorum
and P. sojae, as no trace of the putative viral relic appears
in P. sojae. After its integration into the P. ramorum
genome, the viral sequence has started to degenerate.
An intein in an RNA polymerase sequence isolated from
the Sargasso Sea
A putative intein was also identified in a sequence from an
unclassified species (IBEA_CTG_SVAEH23TF) found in
the environmental samples division of GenBank (accession no. AACY01369547). The sequence was generated as
part of the shotgun sequencing of samples from the Sargasso Sea [39]. The complementary strand of this
sequence encodes the N-terminal part of an intein, which
includes the conserved splicing motifs and the first motif
of a homing endonuclease domain, and is preceded by
part of an RNA polymerase. The intein in this sequence is
inserted at the same site as that in the putative viral relic
in P. ramorum, i.e. they are allelic inteins. Similarity
searches at InBase indicate that the most closely similar
annotated intein to this Sargasso Sea sequence is Ceu
ClpP, the intein from the chloroplast of C. eugametos (E =
2 Ã 10-13). BLAST2 comparisons suggest a closer sequence
similarity between the Ceu ClpP intein and the Sargasso
Sea sequence (E = 1 Ã 10-17) than between the Sargasso Sea
sequence and the P. ramorum virus intein fragment (E = 4
Ã 10-5).

Phylogenetic analyses (not shown) indicate that the RNA
polymerase from which this sequence is derived is most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/38

closely related to eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, although
it is not highly similar to any sequence of known origin.
E-values derived from TBLASTN searches at NCBI [40]
indicate that the 59-residue fragment of this RNA
polymerase is most similar (52â56% amino acid identity)
to RNA polymerases (RPB2) from fungi (Table 2). It is less
likely that the sequence is from a marine virus such as one
of the large double-stranded DNA viruses from the
NCLDV group that infect eukaryotes (40â46% amino acid
identity). These large viruses, some of which infect marine
organisms, encode RNA polymerase II-like proteins.
An intein in an RNA polymerase sequence found in an
isolate of the Emiliania huxleyi virus
A partial intein sequence was identified in a short
sequence cloned from E. huxleyi virus 163 (GenBank
accession DQ127798). The allelic site in E. huxleyi virus
86 (accession CAI65861, containing sequence annotated
as encoding a RPB2 homologue) does not contain an
intein. E. huxleyi is a marine calcifying haptophyte alga,
and the virus is a member of the NCLDV group [41]. The
intein-like sequence represents only ~50 residues of the Cterminal end of an intein similar to SasRPB2-b and
CstRPB2-b (it ends in TGN). The sequence downstream
(the C-extein) from the intein-like sequence in E. huxleyi
virus 163 encodes residues almost identical to the corresponding region in E. huxleyi virus 86 (Figure 1). This
region is immediately adjacent the region corresponding
to the insertion site of the P. ramorum virus partial intein
and the partial intein from the Sargasso Sea isolate â that
is, these three partial inteins are allelic inteins (Figure 1).
RNA polymerase inteins insert at highly conserved sites
Previous analyses have suggested that inteins usually
appear at highly conserved sites within their host proteins
[5]. One possible reason for this preference is that inteins
inserted at such sites are less likely to be removed. Highly
conserved sites in proteins usually have important and
sequence-specific functions, and, therefore, any deletion
that removes the intein sequence would have to be very
precise or it would result in a non-functional host gene. In
contrast, inteins inserted at poorly conserved sites might
be successfully removed by a wide range of imprecise deletions. A second possibility is that inteins inserted at highly
conserved sites may be more likely than inteins inserted at
poorly conserved sites to spread successfully throughout
the gene pool of a species or to undergo a successful horizontal transmission to a new species, as the homing endonuclease recognition site is more likely to be conserved.
With six distinct insertion sites within homologous genes,
these new RNA polymerase inteins provide a good opportunity to examine this phenomenon in detail in a eukaryote system. We therefore created an alignment of
eukaryotic RNA polymerases, plotted the level of conservation in 10 amino-acid windows across the alignment,

were conducted at NCBI using as a query the 59 residues from the Sargasso Sea sequence (Accession AACY01369547) that formed

restricted to one of the six groups outlined below.

and mapped the intein insertion sites onto the plot (Figure 3). As can be seen, the intein insertion sites each correspond to one of the peaks in the sequence conservation
plot, indicating that each is inserted into one of the most
highly conserved sites within these genes. Not all highly

contain appropriate flanking residues (for example the Cextein Cys or Ser).

inserted at highly conserved positions, but others are

polymerase introns do not preferentially appear at highly
conserved sites.

sites occurred in the three-dimensional protein, including
which structural domains correspond to the intein insertion sites. It is of interest to plot these sites because inteins
at some positions might be more easily processed during
protein folding. Because the RNA polymerase subunits
RPA2, RPB2 and RPC2 are similar in structure, we used as
our common template the structure of RPB2 from S. cerevisiae [42,43]. It is possible to map onto the protein structure the position of the RPA2, RPB2, RPC2 and viral RPO
II intein insertion sites, as if they were all inserted into the
homologous RPB2 protein. Using data from the Protein
Data Bank [44] (entry 1I3Q) and the MacPyMOL molecular visualisation system [45], we highlighted six residues
immediately adjacent to each intein insertion site. Figure

4 illustrates the assembly of RPB2 and RPB1 into the core
heterodimer. Using the terminology of Cramer et al [42],
both the Ddi RPC2 and Bde RPB2 insertion sites are in the
'fork' domain, the Pno RPA2, Cst RPB2, Sas RPB2 and the
viral RPO intein found in P. ramorum are all inserted
within the 'hybrid binding' domain, and the Cre RPB2
intein insertion site is in the anchor domain. All of these
sites are close to the active site of RPB2. None of the insertion sites are found on the external surface of the protein;
all are on the surface of the 'cleft' formed by the RPB1/
RPB2 heterodimer or are on the interface between these
subunits (Figure 4). It is highly probable, therefore, that
inteins inserted into these sites in any of the homologues
will need to be accurately spliced out before the protein

subunits can assume their correct folds and the active RNA
polymerase complex can be assembled. In contrast, if
inteins were present on the surface of the heterodimer,
they could undergo inactivation and progressive deletion
without necessarily impairing the assembly and function
of the RNA polymerase.
Relationships among inteins
Previous work with eukaryotic inteins has shown that
allelic inteins are usually each other's closest relatives. For
instance, the wide variety of PRP8 inteins identified in
ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi form a monophyletic group, relative to all other known inteins. Similarly, the yeast VMA1 inteins also appear as a
monophyletic group. There is some evidence to suggest
that many of the previously identified eukaryotic nuclear
inteins (i.e., VMA1, PRP8, GLT1 and CHS2) may be more
closely related to each other than they are to most inteins
encoded by non-nuclear genes [20]. There is no evidence
suggesting that the nuclear-encoded inteins are closely
related to eukaryotic inteins encoded by chloroplast
genes, or inteins encoded by eukaryotic viruses. Indeed,
some of these latter inteins are alleles of, and closely
related to, inteins found in prokaryotes. For instance, the
DNA polymerase B inteins of the A. polyphaga mimivirus
and HaV01 are most closely related to allelic DNA
polymerase inteins from various archaea [17].

RPB2 (red and blue regions) can be seen. The lowest image is
of RPB2 only, but with the intein insertion sites labelled with
the names of inteins inserted at these positions in some
homologues.

To study the relationships among the new RNA polymerase inteins and previously identified inteins, we constructed phylogenies based on alignments of conserved
intein splicing domains. Homing endonuclease domains
were not included in this analysis because they are absent
from mini-inteins and because, even in full-length inteins,
they are often degenerate and therefore might produce
misleading results. The sequences to be aligned were
edited so as to remove all of the intein residues between
the end of the N-terminal splicing domain and the beginning of the C-terminal splicing domain. These domains
were determined by comparison with other intein
sequences available at InBase [6]. The resulting alignment
has 102 positions and is available as supplementary data
(additional data file 5). An example of a tree containing
all the new RNA polymerase inteins and a wide variety of
previously identified inteins, including most of the
known eukaryotic inteins and representatives of many of
the allele groups of prokaryotic inteins, is shown in Figure
5. Most of the relationships observed on this tree are consistent with results obtained previously. For instance, the
PRP8 inteins all group together, as do the VMA1 inteins.
The new eukaryotic RNA polymerase inteins do not generally appear to be closely related to each other, despite
being present in homologous (in some cases paralogous)
genes. This is not perhaps unexpected, however, as most

Phylogenetic tree of intein splicing domains
Phylogenetic tree of intein splicing domains. This unrooted distance tree was constructed by the neighbour-joining
method using PAUP*4b10 [52] with the default settings. Numbers on the branches indicate the percentages of bootstrap support derived from a heuristic search with 100 random addition replicates; this search included a tree-bisection-reconnection
branch-swapping algorithm. All bootstrap values > 50 have been reported except in cases where allelic inteins fall within a wellsupported (95â100% bootstrap) group, when some values >50 have been omitted for reasons of space. Inteins encoded by
nuclear genes are highlighted with an asterisk. The alignment used is available as supplementary data (additional file 5).

are inserted at different sites in these genes and therefore
are not allelic inteins. The C. reinhardtii RNA polymerase
II intein appears to be most closely related to the threonyl
transfer RNA synthetase inteins from C. tropicalis and C.
parapsilosis. This grouping receives a high level of bootstrap support (100%). This is unusual as these inteins are
not alleles and are found in different kingdoms. The P.
nodorum RNA polymerase I intein is not closely related to
any other known intein, although it does fall within a
moderately supported (68%) group that also includes the
C. eugametos chloroplast Ceu ClpP intein, Sas RPB2, Cst
RPB2, the putative viral intein embedded within the P.
ramorum genome, and a variety of prokaryotic inteins. All
these inteins (including Cre RPB2, Cpa ThrRS and Ctr
ThrRS, Pno RPA2, Sas RPB2 and Cst RPB2, and Ceu ClpP),
together with a set of prokaryotic inteins, form a well-supported (99%) cluster distinct from all other inteins. The B.
dendrobatidis RNA polymerase II intein (Bde RPB2) and
the D. discoideum RNA polymerase III intein (Ddi RPC2)
lie outside of this cluster. Although on this tree, they
appear as each other's closest known relative, this grouping does not receive high levels of support (60%) and the
two inteins are not particularly similar in sequence (~20%
identity), so the significance of the grouping is uncertain.
The topology of the distance trees generated from the
alignment data is generally very similar if different treebuilding algorithms such as quartet puzzling or parsimony analyses are used. The bootstrap values generated
follow a similar pattern also, with one exception; the node
that joins the PRP8 allelic inteins with the VMA allelic
inteins can attract values ranging from 56% to 96%. The
bootstrap value of the node that groups many of the
newly described RNA polymerase inteins into a cluster
distinct from all other inteins ranges from 70% (fast heuristic search, no branch-swapping) to 99% (heuristic
search with branch-swapping).

Discussion
We have identified coding sequences for seven new
inteins within nuclear genes. These are all present within
homologous genes encoding the second largest subunits
of RNA polymerase. One is present in an RNA polymerase
I subunit, four (including two allelic inteins) in a RNA
polymerase II subunit, one in RNA polymerase III, and the
last is found in a viral RNA polymerase in a degenerate
provirus. In addition, we identified a sequence from an
unknown organism from the Sargasso Sea that contains a
partial sequence of an intein allelic to that of the provirus,
and a partial sequence of a further allelic intein from E.
huxleyi virus 163. These new inteins raise the number of
distinct (non-allelic) nuclear-encoded inteins identified
to 11 (or 10 if the proviral intein is excluded).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/38

The new inteins from C. reinhardtii, a green alga, and from
D. discoideum, a cellular slime mould (Amoebozoa), are
the first nuclear-encoded inteins to be found outside of
the fungi. These findings indicate that there is no particular barrier to the functioning of inteins in non-fungal
eukaryote nuclei. They also have implications for our
understanding of the origins and evolution of nuclear
inteins. For instance, they suggest either that inteins have
a much longer history in nuclear genomes than was previously evident, or perhaps that they have invaded nuclear
genomes on multiple occasions or are capable of widespread horizontal transmission. They also suggest that
inteins will be identified in further diverse eukaryotes as
more genome sequences are determined.
Inteins have now been found in many kingdoms of
eukaryotes. They are present in Opisthokonts (in many
fungal species and in the viruses of insects), in Amoebozoa (Dictyostelium RPC2 and the mimivirus intein, APMV
PolB, in Acanthamoeba), in green plants (C. reinhardtii
RPB2 and the C. eugametos plastid ClpP protease), in the
red alga (the plastid DnaB helicase of P. purpurea) and a
cryptophyte (the plastid DnaB helicase of G. theta).
Inteins are found in the viruses of haptophyte algae (E.
huxleyi virus intein, EhV163_RPO) and viruses of Stramenopiles, both photosynthetic golden-brown algae
(Heterosigma virus intein, HaV01 PolB), and the non-photosynthetic oomycete (P. ramorum, PrV_RPO).
The intein from the viral relic embedded in P. ramorum is
the first example of an intein in a eukaryotic provirus. This
intein is of particular interest in the context of the possibility of horizontal transmission of inteins, as it has been
suggested that viruses might mediate the movement of
inteins between species [17]. For instance, an intein
present in a particular gene in a cellular genome might be
able to home to a homologous gene in an infecting virus.
If this virus were then to infect a second species, the intein
could potentially undergo a second homing reaction and
become inserted into the homologous gene in the new
species. This idea is supported by the presence of allelic
inteins in bacteriophage and bacterial genomes [6]. For
example, allelic DnaB-b inteins are found in ~17 species
of eubacteria and in a giant phage found in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Allelic inteins in the RIR1-i insertion site of
ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase are present in
prophages from two strains of Bacillus subtilis, in three
eukaryote viruses and in a cyanobacterium [6]. Although
no nuclear inteins that are alleles of the P. ramorum proviral intein have yet been identified, the finding supports
the possibility that such a horizontal transmission might
take place in eukaryotes. The Sargasso Sea intein fragment
may represent such a nuclear-encoded homologue of the
P. ramorum proviral intein; alternatively it may be derived
from a eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus

Page 13 of 17

BMC Biology 2006, 4:38

(NCLDV). An intein fragment is present in the allelic site
of one isolate of the E. huxleyi virus, a member of the
NCLDV group. However, the P. ramorum proviral intein is
intriguing, because the chances of a successful intein
transmission from virus to host would be increased by the
integration of the viral DNA into the host genome, as then
the viral DNA would be a stable part of the host genome
and would be available to act as a template for DNA repair
(an essential part of the homing process) for much longer
than in a transient infection.
The six sites where the inteins are inserted are among the
most highly conserved regions of the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase. This is consistent with previous
findings that inteins are usually found at highly conserved
sites. It is not clear why RNA polymerase has so many
inteins, however, when no other nuclear gene has more
than one known intein. It is possible that it is related to
the presence of RNA polymerase genes in a variety of
viruses. This may increase the likelihood of an intein
being horizontally transferred, which, according to the
proposed lifecycle of inteins, may increase the likelihood
of it surviving for long periods of time. Multiple alleles
were detected at two of the new intein sites; the other four
sites were represented by single inteins. This emphasises
the extremely sporadic distribution of inteins. Many
examples of RNA polymerase genes have been sequenced,
because of their usefulness in phylogenetic studies, but
inteins have been found in few.
The non-allelic RNA polymerase inteins are not highly
similar to each other, or to any previously identified
inteins. Five of the inteins, Pno RPA2, Cre RPB2, Cbe
RPB2, Sas RPB2 and the intein from the provirus in P.
ramorum, however, form part of a well-supported but
diverse group of inteins that also includes the Candida
ThrRS inteins, Ceu ClpP and several prokaryotic inteins.
Within this group, the Cre RPB2 intein appears to be most
closely related to the ThrRS inteins (100% bootstrap support), which is unusual as these are not allelic inteins.
Similarly, Cst RPB2 and Sas RPB2 form a well-supported
group with the non-allelic Ceu ClpP intein. These findings
raise the possibility that, in each of these cases, one of the
alleles is derived from the other via the ectopic movement
of an ancestral intein. There is, however, no obvious similarity among the nucleotide sequences that flank these
non-allelic inteins. Such similarity might have suggested
that a homing endonuclease had cleaved a degenerate site
and promoted an ectopic conversion, but it is unlikely to
be detected; even the allelic inteins CstRPB2 and SasRPB2
show <80% sequence identity in this region (all but two
of the changes are third codon substitutions).
The finding that clades representing nuclear-encoded
inteins are dispersed throughout the intein phylogeny,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/38

intermingled with clades representing eubacterial,
archaeal and viral inteins (Figure 5), suggests that inteins
have a very long history in eukaryotes, dating back to
eukaryotic origins, and/or that horizontal intein transmission between eukaryotes and prokaryotes has occurred at
multiple points. Given the lack of compelling evidence for
the occurrence of horizontal transmission of eukaryotic
inteins (i.e. there are no examples of highly similar inteins
in distantly related host species), together with the general
high degree of diversity in the intein sequences, we favour
the former possibility that inteins were present in the very
earliest eukaryotes. Their present-day sporadic distribution is likely to be primarily the result of multiple, independent losses in different lineages.

Conclusion
Seven complete new nuclear-encoded inteins were identified and characterised. These inteins were all found in
genes encoding the second-largest subunits of RNA
polymerase. The inteins were found at six distinct (nonallelic) sites, i.e., only two of them are allelic. Four of the
inteins are from fungi (one from an ascomycete, one from
a zygomycete and two from chytrids). One intein was
found in the green alga C. reinhardtii and one in the slime
mould D. discoideum. These are the first nuclear-encoded
inteins from outside of the fungi. The seventh new intein
is from a provirus embedded within the genome of an
oomycete (the kingdom Stramenopiles). These new
inteins substantially increase the number of described
nuclear-encoded inteins and also widen the diversity of
species known to harbour such inteins. The data suggest
that inteins have a long history in eukaryotes, probably
dating back to their earliest origins.
