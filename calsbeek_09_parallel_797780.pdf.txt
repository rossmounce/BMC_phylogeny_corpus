Abstract
Background: Natural selection is a potent evolutionary force that shapes phenotypic variation to
match ecological conditions. However, we know little about the year-to-year consistency of
selection, or how inter-annual variation in ecology shapes adaptive landscapes and ultimately
adaptive radiations. Here we combine remote sensing data, field experiments, and a four-year study
of natural selection to show that changes in vegetation structure associated with a severe drought
altered both habitat use and natural selection in the brown anole, Anolis sagrei.
Results: In natural populations, lizards increased their use of vegetation in wet years and this was
correlated with selection on limb length but not body size. By contrast, a die-back of vegetation
caused by drought was followed by reduced arboreality, selection on body size, and relaxed
selection on limb length. With the return of the rains and recovery of vegetation, selection reverted
back to pre-drought pattern of selection acting on limb length but not body size. To test for the
impact of vegetation loss on natural selection during the drought, we experimentally removed
vegetation on a separate study island in a naturally wet year. The experiment revealed similar interannual changes in selection on body size but not limb length.
Conclusion: Our results illustrate the dynamic nature of ecology driving natural selection on Anolis
morphology and emphasize the importance of inter-annual environmental variation in shaping
adaptive variation. In addition, results illustrate the utility of using remote sensing data to examine
ecology's role in driving natural selection.

Background
A central goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the
origins of adaptive variation that are linked to ecology.
However, the ecological forces that drive natural selection
and ultimately shape adaptation are dynamic, and may
change across years [1-3]. Consequently, there is growing
appreciation that an in depth understanding of adaptation in natural populations requires long-term studies of
selection [1,3].

A long-standing assertion is that variation in limb length
and body size of Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles arose
via natural selection in response to differences in ecology
[4,5]. Long limbs increase sprinting speed on broad
perching surfaces such as tree-trunks, whereas shorter
limbs enhance agility on narrow twigs and branches [6,7].
Previous studies [6,8] have suggested that traits such as
running performance in different habitats may be important for predator avoidance and foraging efficiency, and

body size variation may be a decisive factor in the strength
of competitive interactions [9]. Decades of study have
repeatedly demonstrated the functional relationships
between morphology and habitat use, particularly how
suites of traits are favoured under varying ecological conditions [6,8,10]. Though phylogenetic studies of anoles
[11] propose that these ecological mechanisms of diversification are conserved through time, we still lack a test of
this hypothesis.
The hypothesis depends on consistency of selection pressures such that diversification occurring at the population
level would ultimately translate into species level diversity
[12,13]. Long-term work on Darwin's finches [1], another
adaptive radiation, suggests that environmental fluctuations may make consistency of selection pressures
unlikely. However, experimental examinations of environmental variation and its effect on selection have yet to
be performed. Indeed, experimental studies of natural
selection on combinations of morphological traits over
multiple years remain very rare. Fluctuating selection pressures through time make point estimates of selection difficult to interpret, and consequently, a long-term
perspective on selection becomes that much more important. Here we provide data from a four-year study to test
the hypothesis that changing environmental conditions
alter the nature of natural selection on Anolis lizards in the
wild. We measured selection on natural and experimental
populations, and used remote sensing and field-based
measures of precipitation and vegetation changes to link
our selection data to ecological change.

Methods
We studied viability selection (i.e., survival to the end of
the breeding season) acting on wild populations of male
A. sagrei (N = 133, 98, 111, and 148 lizards during 2003–
2006 respectively) on Kidd cay, a small island (~1600 m2)
near Georgetown Exuma, Bahamas, and on an offshore
cay (Nightmare cay; ~500 m2, N = 98 and 92 during 2005
and 2006 respectively). We studied the natural resident
population on Kidd cay during 2003, 2005 and 2006, but
during 2004, as part of a different study [14], we experimentally replaced all resident male A. sagrei with males
from an immediately adjacent site on Great Exuma.
Nearly all lizards (ca. 85%) in our study population
mature and die in a single year [7,9], so each year we studied selection on a different cohort of lizards (the few surviving individuals were excluded from subsequent year's
analyses). Though the agent of selection acting on these
lizards is difficult to document unambiguously, previous
studies suggest that the bulk of mortality arises through
predation [15] and competition over territories [9], both
of which may depend on variation in locomotor performance in vegetated habitat [7,16].

Climate and habitat data
During 2004, we measured lizard perching locations by
exhaustively sampling the diameters of vegetation in 59
randomly sampled quadrats (1 m2) across the entire study
island. Though these measures provided a general description of the vegetation that was available to lizards on the
island, they failed to adequately describe the habitat actually used by study animals. In subsequent years, we
recorded characteristics of the habitat used by lizards,
based on the location (vegetative habitat versus not) of
perches used by lizards at first capture [17,18]. Anolis
sagrei are sedentary and very consistent in their use of habitat, and field observations indicate infrequent movement
between alternative habitat types [19]. Thus, these measures are likely to better represent the actual range of habitat use exhibited by individuals during our study.
Perching data were recorded for all individuals and for
each year (N = 969 individual habitat measurements,
including measures from four individuals not used in
selection analyses owing to missing morphological data)
and are reported here as estimates of inter-annual variation in habitat availability and use by lizards. We supplemented these data by measuring changes in the
normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; a measure
of vegetation "greenness").

Rainfall data were collected both on the ground (using a
rain gauge; monthly totals) and from remote sensing data.
We obtained satellite precipitation-data from the microwave sensors onboard the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission (TRMM) [20]. The TRMM products were obtained
from the global rainfall algorithm (3B43), combining
estimates from the sensors with globally gridded raingauge data from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center and
the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC). The
TRMM products provide estimates of rainfall at 25 km
spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution, covering the years 1998 to 2006. To compute a time series, we
extracted rainfall data from the pixel with center coordinate closest to our study region, and aggregated the
monthly values to seasonal totals of rainfall estimates.
To compute a time series of vegetation activity for our
study region, we obtained normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from the satellite MODIS sensor
which were produced by the Global Landcover Facility
[21]. The NDVI data set has a spatial resolution of 250 m
and a temporal resolution of 16 d and spans the years
2001 to 2006. The NDVI is computed as the difference
between near-infrared and red reflectance of the land surface, normalized by the sum of the reflectances, and is
indicative of photosynthetic activity.
Considerable residual cloud effects were present in the
NDVI data. To improve quality, we first cut the NDVI data

for a 5 km2 area with center coordinate W75.555 and
N23.500 close to the vicinity of our study region. We then
aggregated the 250 m resolution data to 500 m by taking
the maximum NDVI within the 2 × 2 subpixel array for
each 16 d period. Thereafter, we computed monthly NDVI
composites by taking the maximum NDVI within two
consecutive 16 d periods. In the subsequent spatial averaging within the study region for each month, we only
included 500 m pixels if their NDVI values were above a
threshold (NDVI > 0.5) for at least 9 months in a given
year. Since NDVI stays high over land throughout the year
due to predominant evergreen forest type, the last step
ensured that spatial averaging involved almost exclusively
land areas within our study region, and excluded small
off-shore islands that could not be resolved entirely with
the resolution of the MODIS data. In the resulting
monthly NDVI time series, spurious effects of cloud cover
were still present, and we computed seasonal means by
extracting the maximum NDVI from the 3 consecutive
months.
Natural selection, non-manipulated island
Initial lizard captures took place each spring from late
May to early June. Each year we attempted to capture all
male lizards on our natural study site. Lizards were sexed
(males have enlarged post-anal scales), weighed (nearest
0.1 g) and measured snout-vent-length (SVL; nearest 0.5
mm) using a small metal ruler. We recorded habitat use,
including whether lizards were first sighted on the ground
or in vegetated habitat, as well as the diameter of the perch
[9]. Hind and forelimb lengths were measured with dial
callipers from the point of insertion into the abdomen to
the femoral-tibial and humero-radio-ulnar joints. All
measurements were made in the afternoon by a single
observer (RC). Lizards were injected with unique combinations of coloured elastomer dye in the ventral side of
the hind and forelimbs [22]. Tags serve as permanent
identification in the wild, allowing us to track the fate of
every individual over the course of the study. Lizards captured at our natural site were released within four hours to
their original point of capture. Each year, we attempted to
track the fate of every individual over the four-month
period that spans the breeding season (June-September).
Experimental reduction of vegetation
To simulate the effects of drought on vegetation structure
during a naturally wet year (2005), we removed approximately 30 percent of the under-story vegetation and 10
percent of the canopy cover from a small off-shore cay
adjacent to our natural study island. We used hedge-clippers and machetes to trim green vegetation from the
island, and this vegetation was taken away by boat. NDVI
has a functional relationship to the fraction of absorbed
photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and can sometimes be used to calculate changes in net primary produc-

tivity [23]. However, the mixture of overstory and
understory vegetation at our study site made it difficult to
quantify the gains and losses of green biomass due to
drought from remotely-sensed data, and we therefore estimated these values qualitatively for our experimental
islands. We then introduced a population of 98 individually-marked juvenile male lizards to the experimental
island from a site immediately adjacent to our natural
study site (for details, see [9]), and measured viability
selection over the same four-month period as on Kidd cay.
During 2005 and 2006, lizards used in our experimental
vegetation manipulation were captured from a site on
Great Exuma, 1000 m from our natural study site, and
were introduced to Nightmare cay, a small offshore cay
currently being used as part of a long-term study of natural selection [9]. The experimental population was introduced at a natural density (~0.3 lizards/m2) [24], and the
offshore cay was similar in most aspects to our natural
site. The lizards on the two islands are also exposed to
similar avian predators, (particularly mockingbirds,
Mimus polyglottos, and herons, Butorides striatus) though
our natural site also supports a terrestrial lizard that may
occasional eat A. sagrei (the whiptail lizard Ameiva) and
which is not present on the offshore cay. We had previously cleared this cay of all naturally occurring lizards to
prevent introduced lizards in our study from interacting
with native residents. Naturally occurring females on the
off-shore cay were not manipulated.
After four months, we estimated the strength and form of
natural selection by exhaustively recapturing nearly all
surviving lizards on the islands (recapture rates of 97–
99% of survivors; we failed to catch at least two male lizards during 2005 and at least one male evaded recapture
during the other years). Fall censuses can be considered
reliable estimates of survival since emigration from
islands is likely to be rare, except during major storms
[25], none of which occurred during this study. Census
efficiency on islands was determined by regressing the
number of lizards captured each day (log transformed)
against the cumulative days of capture effort. We then estimated the number of lizards that would have been caught
with one more day of the census. This number was less
than three lizards per island in all years of study.
Selection analyses
We used general linear models to extract selection gradients [26,27] for linear (β) and non-linear (γ1,1 and γ1,2)
forms of selection. Linear and non-linear terms were calculated in separate models [27], and linear terms were
included in the models used to calculate quadratic gradients. Because the assumptions of parametric statistics may
be violated in the case of survival data (live/die), which
tend to have non-normally distributed errors, we computed significance values for selection gradients using

logistic regression on the same models [28]. Though past
studies linking morphology with habitat use have primarily focused on the importance of hind limb length alone
(e.g., [8]), the action of natural selection is inherently
multivariate [27,29], and studies should attempt to measure selection acting on biologically relevant trait combinations [7,30]. Our previous work on anoles has shown a
strong influence of correlational selection on traits such as
immune function, population density, limb length, and
perch diameter [7,31] and work on other lizards demonstrates similar forms of selection on life history traits [32].
Based on previous studies [5,15], and on the ecology of
Anolis ecomorphs [4], we predicted that hind and forelimb lengths should be selected in concert. We therefore
report here the magnitude of correlational selection gradients (γ1,2) on size-corrected limb lengths. We regressed
limb lengths on SVL (both log transformed) and used the
residuals about the regression line as an estimate of size
corrected limb lengths in all models. All trait distributions
were standardized to have a mean of zero and unit variance, except survival, which was standardized by the population mean prior to analysis (Tables 1 and 2). We
computed fitness surfaces using the non-parametric cubic
spline approach of Schluter and Nychka [33]. We first
searched a range of possible smoothing parameters (λ) to
find the value of λ that minimized the generalized cross
validation (GCV) score. We then used this λ to plot the
best-fit cubic spline to survival data. Finally, because each
year represents selection on a new cohort of lizards, and
because of significant year effects (see Results) we treat
individual years as independent estimates of selection and
do not use post-hoc correction methods on significance
levels.

Results
We began our study of natural selection during 2003. The
following year we experimentally replaced male lizards on
Kidd cay, our principal study site, with individuals from
an adjacent site on Great Exuma [14]. Coincidentally, that
same year the Bahamas experienced a severe drought that
we quantified using both satellite remote sensing and
ground-based rainfall data (Figs. 1, 2A). Satellite data of
the entire study area corroborated the rainfall data collected at one specific point on the ground. Thus, we can be
reasonably certain that our measures on the ground are
representative of adjacent study sites (e.g., Nightmare
cay). During 2004, under-story vegetation and canopy
foliage on the island were greatly reduced, and this fine
scale variation was reflected in a reduction in NDVI (see
below).
Changes in vegetative cover over the course of the fouryear study impacted habitat use by lizards. Lizards
perched more frequently on the ground during the
drought relative to wet years when they perched more fre-

quently in the vegetation (χ2 = 14.96, df = 3, P < 0.0001;
Fig. 2B, C). Drought conditions ended in 2005 with an
increase in rainfall (Fig. 1, 2A), which led to increased
growth of under-story vegetation and shifts in habitat use
by lizards (Fig. 2B, C). Use of vegetated habitat increased
significantly from 2004 to 2006 though it remained
below pre-drought values. Similarly, the frequency of leafuse for perching and for cover increased during 2005 and
2006 as lizards moved off of narrow plant stems and onto
new vegetative growth (χ2 = 13.37, df = 3, P = 0.0003; Fig
2C).
Impacts of the drought on vegetation structure and habitat use by lizards coincided with shifts in natural selection
on limb length and body size (snout-vent-length, SVL).
During the three wet years of our study, correlational
selection gradients acting on size corrected limb lengths
(residuals from the regression of limb length against SVL)
ranged from significant and positive to significant and
negative (Fig. 3; 2003: γ1,2= 0.29 ± 0.16; 2005: γ1,2= -0.13
± 0.18; 2006: γ1,2 = -0.21 ± 0.09). This indicates a change
in the shape of the fitness surface from saddle shaped to
dome shaped [34,35]. An alternative to focusing on the
shape of the correlational selection surface (i.e., the sign
of the gradients) is to ask simply whether or not selection
acted on limb lengths in wet versus dry years. A plot of the

absolute values of correlational selection gradients
through time (Fig. 2D) shows that correlational selection
gradients were significantly different from zero only during wet years. By contrast, selection operated on body size
and not on limb lengths during the drought year and
immediately following the drought (Fig. 2E and Table 1).
During the drought selection on body size was significant
and disruptive (γ = 0.60 ± 0.22). Following the drought,
natural selection favoured smaller male body sizes (β = 0.23 ± 0.11). In the two years following the drought (Fig.
2A), the island's vegetation gradually recovered (e.g., Fig.
4 increases in NDVI,) and we observed a return to selection on limb length as lizards moved back onto the vegetation (Fig. 2E). The differences in selection on body size
and limb traits was significant among years (hindlimb ×
forelimb × SVL × wet/dry F1,464 = 4.69, P = 0.03). In sum,
we observed selection on limb length only in wet years,
selection on body size alone during the drought, and
selection for smaller body size the year immediately after
the drought. Thus variation in selection was intimately
related to variation in ecology.
To test whether changes in habitat structure were sufficient to explain the dynamic patterns of selection
observed in our natural study population, we measured

manipulated during the wet year of 2005. Similar to patterns observed during the actual drought, selection acted
significantly on body size (β = 0.55 ± 0.23; Fig. 5) but not
on limb morphology (γ1,2= -0.57 ± 0.42) following our
experimental vegetation removal.
In 2006, observations in the field suggested re-growth of
the under-story and substantial increases in new stem

growth in the canopy on the island that we had manipulated the previous year. We again estimated selection on a
new cohort of experimentally introduced males (92 juvenile male lizards from the same source-population as used
the previous year, all other males were removed from the
island) and similar to results from the natural site, in the
year after our experimental manipulation of the vegetation, selection on body size was relaxed and non-significant (β = 0.06 ± 0.19; Fig. 5; Table 2). We did not detect

limb length, a comparison of slopes revealed significant
differences between natural populations and those in
which we manipulated vegetation (body size P < 0.001
and limb length P < 0.002).

Discussion and conclusion
Together, these results provide strong evidence that ecology can have dramatic impacts on the selective landscape
through time [36]. We have demonstrated that natural
selection operated on different traits in wet and dry years
and that this change was associated with changes in habitat use. During wet years, when abundant vegetative hab-

The top panel shows seasonal variation in the TRMM (precipitation) data for each season from 2001–2006 illustrating the drought that occurred during 2004 (grey). Precipitation data were standardized by subtracting mean values
and dividing by the standard deviation of all seasonal values. Horizontal lines at ± 1 SD highlight the magnitude of the drought.
The lower panel shows corresponding changes in the untransformed "normalized difference vegetation index" (NDVI). Seasonal abbreviations reference three-month averages corresponding to winter (Dec, Jan, Feb), spring (Mar, Apr, May), summer
(Jun, Jul, Aug) and fall (Sep, Oct, Nov). The grey bar highlights the drought year and is congruent with the figures from the main

An experimental manipulation to simulate drought effects (grey columns) on vegetation structure revealed
changes in selection acting on body size that were similar to those between naturally wet and dry years (EX
and N refer to experimental vegetation removal and natural years respectively). Following experimental removal
of vegetation, natural selection became strong and directional, favoring larger male body size (** indicates the significant selection gradient). We detected no significant selection on limb length. However, comparison of slopes revealed significant differences between vegetation removed and natural years (indicated by *).

itat was available to lizards for perching, selection
pressures were variable among years but operated primarily on limb traits. By contrast, during the drought, when
vegetation died off and less habitat was available for
perching, natural selection operated primarily on body
size. This difference is likely explained by the fact that
limb length is linked to variation in locomotor performance on broad versus narrow perches [7,8], whereas body
size may be more important in mediating competitive
interactions [37] and surviving periods of physiological
stress [38,39].

lizards more visible to avian predators). Similarly,
changes in precipitation could alter rates of parasitemia as
lizards in our study populations are affected by malaria
and other blood borne pathogens (Bonneaud et al., in
prep). Thus, an additional caveat to consider is that our
manipulations of the habitat simulated some of the
effects of drought on vegetation, but could not account for
potential changes in diet, disease, or predation regime.
Consequently, our experimental results may underestimate differences in selection on limb length between wet
and dry years.

Though demonstrations of natural selection in the wild
have become more common in recent years, studies that
convincingly illustrate the ecological basis for alternative
adaptive optima are rare [3,40,41] and experimental studies such as this one, all the more so. Anolis lizards provide
an ideal opportunity to experimentally bridge ecological
changes with changes in the adaptive landscape, because
the correlations between morphology, performance, and
habitat use have been so thoroughly documented in this
group [15]. Long hind and forelimb lengths increase
sprinting speed on broad perching surfaces, but may compromise agility on narrow surfaces, or in complex habitats
[6,8]. Body size is likely important in competitive interactions [9,42,43], and this may be especially true when
reduced habitat availability places a premium on territoriality [9]. Large body size may also be important for surviving periods of physiological stress brought on by lack of
food or water.

Making associations between intra- and inter-specific variation has been a central theme of studies attempting to
understand the mechanisms giving rise to the adaptive
radiation of Anolis lizards. Implicit in this approach is the
assumption that processes that gave rise to patterns of species diversity can be revealed by studying processes at the
population level [12]. Phylogenetic studies of Anolis lizards have suggested that the same ecomorph may evolve
repeatedly in response to similar environmental conditions, despite having independent evolutionary histories
[11]. Our results suggest an important caveat to these findings by demonstrating that natural selection may favour
different traits across years depending on environmental
conditions. Sustained environmental change, such as that
predicted by global climate models, could potentially
drive selection pressures to act on different suites of traits
[44], thereby fundamentally altering adaptive landscapes
[36,44]. Under these circumstances future processes at the
population level might bear little resemblance to the processes that gave rise to present interspecific variation.

A limitation of our study, reflecting one of the many constraints of working in natural systems, is that the drought
during 2004 coincided with our experimental replacement of male A. sagrei at our main study site [14]. It is
therefore impossible to conclude with certainty that the
observed changes in selection during 2004 arose solely
due to drought, rather than our manipulation of the male
lizard population. Only a second or third estimate of
selection in un-manipulated populations would have
allowed us to examine this. However, several lines of evidence suggest that our results are due to natural processes
rather than our manipulation. First, we have previously
shown that the introduction of novel male A. sagrei did
not have a direct impact on selection dynamics [14]. Second, behavioral, climatological, and habitat data all support a dramatic effect of the drought. Finally, our
experimental manipulation of the habitat during a naturally wet year provides corroborative evidence that habitat
use may drive selection.
In addition to having less available habitat, lizards may
have spent less time in vegetation during the drought
because of changes in prey availability or predation intensity [15] (e.g., a reduction in foliage may have rendered
