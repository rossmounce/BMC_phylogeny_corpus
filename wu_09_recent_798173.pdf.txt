Abstract
Background: Dermatophytes are fungi that cause superficial infections of the skin, hair, and nails.
They are the most common agents of fungal infections worldwide. Dermatophytic fungi constitute
three genera, Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum, and the evolutionary relationships
between these genera are epidemiologically important. Mitochondria are considered to be of
monophyletic origin and mitochondrial sequences offer many advantages for phylogenetic studies.
However, only one complete dermatophyte mitochondrial genome (E. floccosum) has previously
been determined.
Results: The complete mitochondrial DNA sequences of five dermatophyte species, T. rubrum
(26,985 bp), T. mentagrophytes (24,297 bp), T. ajelloi (28,530 bp), M. canis (23,943 bp) and M. nanum
(24,105 bp) were determined. These were compared to the E. floccosum sequence. Mitochondrial
genomes of all 6 species were found to harbor the same set of genes arranged identical order
indicating that these dermatophytes are closely related. Genome size differences were largely due
to variable lengths of non-coding intergenic regions and the presence/absence of introns.
Phylogenetic analyses based on complete mitochondrial genomes reveals that the divergence of the
dermatophyte clade was later than of other groups of pathogenic fungi.
Conclusion: This is the first systematic comparative genomic study on dermatophytes, a highly
conserved and recently-diverged lineage of ascomycota fungi. The data reported here provide a
basis for further exploration of interrelationships between dermatophytes and will contribute to
the study of mitochondrial evolution in higher fungi.

Background
Dermatophytes are parasitic fungi that infect skin, hair
and nails of both humans and animals. They are the primary causative agents of dermatophytosis, a major public
health concern in some geographic regions[1-3]. While

not fatal, dermatophyte infections cause significant morbidity and are of significant cost to society because of their
chronic nature and resistance to therapy. Dermatophytes
encompass 3 genera, Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and
Microsporum. T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes and M. canis are

the most common species in hospital isolates (72–
95%)[4,5]. Morbidity is less commonly associated with
M. nanum while T. ajelloi is a geophilic fungus that only
rarely infects human.
Mitochondria are generally accepted as descendants of
endosymbiotic alpha-proteobacteria[6,7] and are considered to be of monophyletic origin[8-10]. As vital physiological processes and basic adaptive strategies do not
always correlate with trees derived from ribosomal
sequences[11,12], mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
sequences have become a popular tool for phylogenetic
studies. Individual gene sequences often contain a limited
number of informative sites and can lead to incongruent
phylogenetic trees. In contrast, entire mitochondrial
genomes tend to produce reliable phylogenetic trees[1113]. Despite the emergence of new technologies for rapid
DNA sequence determination, sequencing of complete
mtDNAs is still more feasible and economical than
whole-genome sequencing. Furthermore, complete
mtDNA sequences reveal gene content, order and position, and provide further information regarding introns
and intergenic regions [10].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/238

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=4751&opt=organelle).
Nevertheless,
only one sequence is derived from a dermatophyte, i.e. E.
floccosum [12]. Indeed, the dearth of publicly available
genomic data is a major barrier to biomedical research on
dermatophytes [23].
We report here complete mtDNA sequences for 5 dermatophytes including 3 species of Trichophyton (T. rubrum, T.
mentagrophytes and T. ajelloi) and 2 species of Microsporum
(M. canis and M. nanum). These sequences, with the previously reported E. floccosum mtDNA sequence [12], have
permitted systematic comparative analysis of dermatophytes. The mitochondrial genomes of dermatophytes are
highly conserved, indicating that these superficial fungi
are closely related. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis
based on complete mitochondrial genomes has revealed
that dermatophytes arose very late among the ascomycota
fungi. This is the first comparative genomic study on dermatophytes and will provide valuable insights into the
genomics and phylogeny of this important group of fungal pathogens.

Results and discussion
The number of mitochondrial genomes sequenced has
increased greatly over the past decade, notably through
the interdisciplinary collaboration of the Organelle
Genome
Megasequencing
Program
http://
megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/ogmp. Some thousands of
complete mtDNA sequences are already available from
taxonomically diverse organisms including fungi, plants
and animals. This resource provides an unprecedented
insights into the origin and evolution of the mitochondrial genome [13]. In comparison to the genomes of freeliving alpha-proteobacteria, the number of genes contained within the modern mitochondrial genome has
been greatly reduced. It is inferred that many previously
functional genes have been transferred to the nucleus;
others appear to have been replaced by pre-existing
nuclear genes of similar function [14]. Moreover, recent
studies have suggested that positive selection plays a role
in mitochondrial evolution [15-17] while mtDNA polymorphisms are thought to be maintained within populations via selection on the joint mitochondrial-nuclear
genotype [15].
The fungal mitochondrial genome typically contains 14
conserved protein-coding genes, 22–26 tRNA genes, and 2
rRNA genes[9,18-20]. mtDNA divergence between different fungal species is predominantly associated with variation in intergenic regions, intronic sequences, and gene
order[13,21]. The Fungal Mitochondrial Genome Project
was launched over a decade ago [22] and more than 50
complete mitochondrial genomes of fungi have been
determined to date (available from GenBank website

General features
The mitochondrial sequences of T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. ajelloi, M. canis and M. nanum are circular DNAs
of 26,985 bp, 24,297 bp, 28,530 bp, 23,943 bp and
24,105 bp, respectively (Fig. 1). The mitochondrial
genome of M. canis is the smallest of known dermatophytes, while the previously determined E. floccosum is the
largest and exceeds 30 kb [12]. The size differences
between mitochondrial genome sizes are primarily due to
interspecific variation in intergenic regions and introns
(see below).

With the exception of T. rubrum and E. floccosum that carry
several additional hypothetical genes, each genome
encodes 15 conserved protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes
(rnl and rns), and 25 tRNA genes (Table 1, Fig. 1). The dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes are highly compact:
structural genes account for >70% of each genome (Table
1). All genes are encoded on the same DNA strand. Moreover, all the mitochondrial genomes retain colinearity at
the nucleotide level without detectable DNA rearrangement (Fig. 2). The high conservation of genome structure
indicates that these dermatophytes are closely related.
The overall G+C content of the 5 genomes is ~24% (Table
1) consistent with the characteristic AT-rich nature of fungal mitochondrial genomes. The G+C content of genomic
regions encoding RNA genes is usually higher than the
genome average (Table 1) while the majority of proteincoding genes, with exception of cox1, have a lower G+C
content (Fig. 1). The unusual G+C content of cox1 may

reflect its unusual location sandwiched between 2 tRNA
gene clusters.
Protein-coding genes and rRNAs
The five mitochondrial genomes share 15 protein-coding
genes. These include ATP-synthase subunits 6, 8, and 9
(atp6, atp8, and atp9), cytochrome oxidase subunits I, II,
and III (cox1, cox2, and cox3), apocytochrome b (cob), a
ribosomal protein (rps5), and NADH dehydrogenase subunits (nad1, nad2, nad3, nad4, nad4L, nad5, and nad6). T.
rubrum carries 2 additional hypothetical genes (orf1 and
orf2) located between tRNA-Val and tRNA-Met (Fig. 1).
Both genes have homologs of >90% nucleotide similarity
in the previously determined E. floccosum mitochondrial
genome (GenBank: AY916130). The function of these
putative genes is not yet known; further studies will be
required to determine whether they play a role in mitochondrial function.

Synonymous base substitutions (dS) are considered to be
selectively neutral while substitutions causing amino acid
substitution, or non-synonymous substitutions (dN), are
almost always adaptive mutations. The dN/dS ratio therefore affords an index of selective pressures operating on
protein-coding genes. Because selection for adaptive
amino acid substitutions increases dN, a dN/dS ratio of >1
is found in genes subject to selection for change (positive
selection). In contrast, a dN/dS ratio of <1 indicates conservation of essential amino acid sequences (negative
selection). We calculated the dN/dS ratio for each of the
15 dermatophyte protein-coding gene. This revealed that
all genes are subject to strong negative selection; no statistically significant sites of positive selection were found
(see Additional file 1).
The genomic organization of the 15 conserved proteincoding genes in mtDNA is surprisingly identical across all

the known dermatophytes (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the same
gene order is also largely conserved in other pathogenic
filamentous fungi such as Penicillium marneffei and
Aspergillus niger that cause invasive infections [12]. However, the order of these conserved genes is markedly rearranged in the mtDNA of the opportunistic pathogen
Candida albicans [24] (Fig. 3). The similarity of mtDNA
gene order between different fungal species was found to
correlate with their evolutionary relationships inferred
from phylogenetic analysis (see below).
The large (rnl) and small (rns) ribosomal RNA genes are
present in all dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes at
the same relative locations. The rps5 gene encodes a ribosomal protein that may play a role in maintaining the
integrity of the mitochondrial genome [25]; this gene is
present within the intron of rnl as expected. The intronic
location of this ribosomal protein is therefore maintained
in all known dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes.
The previously described nad4L-nad5 consecutive gene
unit was observed in all 5 mitochondrial genomes. This
gene pair is believed to be present in all ascomycota as
well as the basidiomycota and zygomycota, but is interrupted by one or more genes in chytridiomycota. This
may reflect early phylogenetic divergence of these fungi
from the ascomycota [26]. Interestingly, the additional
continuous gene unit, nad4L-nad5-nad2, characterized by
one base overlap and no interruption in gene junctions, is
shared by all dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes with
the exception of the 2 earlier divergent species, M. canis
and T. ajelloi (see phylogenetic section below). The
arrangement of such uninterrupted blocks may reflect
strong conservation during evolution from a common
ancestor [27]; more dermatophytes may be expected to
carry the consecutive nad4L-nad5-nad2 gene unit.
tRNAs and codon usage
All 5 mitochondrial genomes encode the same set of 25
tRNA species with the potential to deliver all 20 amino
acids. Multiple tRNA isoacceptors exist for only leucine,
serine, arginine and methionine. Interestingly, the organization of the 25 tRNA genes is conserved between all the
mitochondrial genomes. The majority of tRNAs (23 of 25)
are grouped into 3 clusters flanked by the atp8-rnl-cox1atp9 gene cluster and containing 8, 3 and 12 tRNAs,
respectively (Fig. 1). The exceptions are T. rubrum and E.
floccosum where the largest tRNA cluster between rnl and
cox1 is interrupted and subdivided into two sub-clusters
by a ~2.5 kb DNA fragment containing additional hypothetical genes (Fig. 2).

tRNA genes have been proposed to play a role in gene
shuffling as they are located between protein-coding
genes and can act as mobile elements [28]. Homology
between isolated tRNA genes may permit genetic recom-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/238

bination, and therefore genetic rearrangement, while gene
shuffling is less likely to take place via recombination
between conserved clusters of tRNA genes[29,30]. The
low number of isolated tRNA genes (2 of 25) may therefore contribute to the high conservation of dermatophyte
mtDNA.
All mitochondrial protein-coding genes commence with a
classical methionine codon (ATG) and terminate with
TAA, the preferred fungal mitochondrial termination
codon [31]. The only exception is atp9 where TGA is the
translation stop codon. Table 2 summarizes codon usages
for all protein-coding genes in the 5 mitochondrial
genomes. The most frequently used codons are TTA (Leu),
ATA (Ile), and TTT (Phe), accounting for about one third
of all codons, and indicating a clear preference for amino
acids with nonpolar side chains. This is likely to reflect the
fact that the majority of the encoded polypeptides are
integral membrane proteins. As expected from the AT-rich
nature of dermatophyte mtDNA, the third position of the
most frequently used codons is strongly biased towards A
or T (Table 2). Furthermore, the most rarely-used codons,
appearing no more than 5 times in all genomes (TGC,
TGG, GGC, CTG, CTC, AGG, CGA, CCG, CCC and ACC),
or absent (CGC, CGG, and ACG), all contain 2 or more G/
C nucleotides in each codon.
Intergenic regions and introns
The dermatophyte genomes are highly compact with
short intergenic regions. In M. canis there is no intergenic
region >1 kb, while only one intergenic region exceeds 1
kb in the other genomes. Because protein-coding genes
and RNAs are highly conserved between species, the differences in mitochondrial genome sizes between the different dermatophytes are largely explained by length
variation in intergenic regions. The longest intergenic
region in M. canis is only 919 nt while all other intergenic
regions in this species are under 500 nt. In contrast, T. ajelloi mtDNA contains 4 long intergenic regions (>500 bp)
and the longest (located at the nad2-cob gene junction)
spans >2.5 kb (Fig. 1). This divergence in intergenic
regions explains the >4 kb difference in the genome sizes
of T. ajelloi and M. canis.

mtDNA intergenic regions diverge not only in size but
also in sequence. Indeed, multiple pairwise alignment of
the different genomes indicates that colinearities are interrupted almost exclusively in intergenic regions (Fig. 2).
However, many intergenic regions were found to be conserved between T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, consistent with the close evolutionary relationship of these 2
species as revealed by phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4).
Remarkably, the longest intergenic region in all genomes
is located between cob and nad3 (with the exception of T.
ajelloi; see above), but pairwise alignment revealed little
similarity between the cob-nad3 intergenic sequences of
Page 5 of 14

nad1 and atp9, respectively [33]. Moreover, the E. floccosum mitochondrial genome carries 4 additional introns
located within in cox1, nad5 (2 introns) and cob [12]. The
number of introns is therefore strain-specific and also
contributes to variation in mitochondrial genome size.
Phylogenetic analysis
Broad phylogenetic trees of fungi were previously constructed based on rDNA [34-36] or nuclear protein-coding
genes [37,38] but these studies did not permit the elucidation of higher-order relationships. A combination of 6
gene regions was recently employed to construct a fungal
phylogenetic tree comprising ~200 species [39]. Unfortunately, no dermatophytes were included in this study. We
therefore performed phylogenetic analysis based on the
complete mitochondrial genomes of 35 species of ascomycota, including 6 dermatophytes, 12 other filamentous
fungi, and 17 yeasts (Fig. 4). The high bootstrap values of
most nodes indicate the robustness of the tree computed.
Fungal species of ascomycota are clustered into 3 distinct
groups corresponding to subphyla Pezizomycotina (filamentous fungi), Saccharomycotina (budding yeast) and
Taphrinomycotina (fission yeast) respectively (Fig. 4). This
confirmed the reliability of mtDNA sequences in fungal
phylogenetic analysis.

Interestingly, the tree reported here divides the clade of filamentous fungi into 2 subgroups (Fig. 4). With only a few
exceptions, the dermatophytes cluster together with invasive pathogenic fungi of humans and animals, while the
other filamentous fungi, mostly pathogens of plants or
insects, form a parallel branch (Fig. 4). This suggests that
host adaptation has driven the evolution of filamentous
fungi. Indeed, previous phylogenetic studies revealed separation between anthropophilic and geophilic species of
Trichophyton [40] suggesting that ecology is a particularly
strong driver of dermatophyte evolution [41].

the different species as indicated by the blank space in the
linear comparison view (Fig. 2). Such divergent intergenic
regions may serve as potential genetic markers for species/
strain identification of dermatophytes.
Many fungal mitochondrial genomes are intron-rich [32].
In contrast, all the dermatophyte mtDNA gene sequences
harbor a single intron (within the rnl gene), with the
exception of T. ajelloi that carries an additional group I
intron (801 bp) within nad1 (Fig. 1). However, previous
mtDNA sequence studies revealed that another strain of T.
rubrum (IP1817.89) harbors 2 additional introns within

In the tree established here all the dermatophytes species
clustered into a single branch, confirming the monophyletic origin of the dermatophyte lineage. Aspergillus
[42] and P. marneffei [43] comprise a separate branch that
shares an immediate ancestor with the dermatophyte
group (Fig. 4). However, the 2 sister branches of human
pathogenic fungi (causing superficial and invasive infections respectively) are represented by distinct patterns in
the phylogenetic tree. The dermatophytes as a group show
far less divergence but longer ancestral branch than the
Aspergillus-Penicillium clade (Fig. 4). This indicates the
divergence from the latest common ancestor of dermatophytes was later than the Aspergillus-Penicillium group.
Fossil evidence has allowed dating of the emergence of the
ascomycota [44]. Based on this calibration, the dermatophyte lineage may be estimated to have diverged from
other fungi at about 32 million years ago (Ma). This result

is consistent with a previous rough estimate (~50 Ma)
based on nucleotide substitution rates in the small ribosomal subunit RNA [45]. However, the timing of the radiation of the dermatophytes is much later than the
divergence of Candida and Saccharomyces at 723 Ma as previously estimated using 20–188 protein sequences [46].
The high conservation of the dermatophyte mitochondrial genome also suggests that the different dermatophytes diverged only recently.
Conventional phenotypic taxonomy has divided the dermatophytes into 3 genera: Trichophyton, Microsporum and
Epidermophyton [47]. Though only a limited number of
dermatophyte species were included in the present study,
the phylogenetic tree established here does not follow this
genus demarcation (Fig. 4). Indeed, recent molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that both Trichophyton and
Microsporum are paraphyletic [48], prompting reevaluation of the phylogenetic relationships between different
dermatophytes [41]. Remarkably, the divergence of T. ajelloi from the inferred common ancestor was much earlier
than of the other dermatophyte species (Fig. 4). This is
consistent with the geophilic features of T. ajelloi: the soil
environment may have afforded an early ecological niche
for all dermatophyte species prior to more recent adaptation to specialized hosts including animals and humans.
An earlier study based on 25S rRNA sequences reported
that T. ajelloi and T. terrestre (not included in the present
study) are separated from the 'true dermatophyte' [49]
and further support the suggestion that Microsporum, as
well as the zoophilic and anthropophilic Trichophyton species, evolved from a geophilic member of Trichophyton
[48].

Conclusion
Previous studies into the evolutionary relationships
between dermatophyte species have been based on
nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers
(ITS)[40,50,51], large ribosomal RNA subunits (LSU)
[49], chitin synthase (CHS) [52-54]and DNA topoisomerase II genes [55], as well as on PCR fingerprinting [56] and
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) [57]
analysis of mitochondrial DNA. The dermatophytes were
found to constitute a homogeneous group of species with
low genetic diversity contrasting with high phenotypic
heterogeneity[41,58]. We now report comparative analysis of 6 complete mitochondrial genomes from all 3 dermatophyte genera (Trichophyton, Microsporum and
Epidermophyton). The composition and organization of
genes within the mtDNAs of all dermatophytes analyzed
was found to be substantially identical, reinforcing the
view that dermatophytes are closely related and constitute
a highly conserved lineage of filamentous fungi.
Comparative genomics provides a powerful tool for
uncovering similarities and differences between species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/238

The present study represents the first application of systematic comparative genomics to dermatophyte phylogeny. The common features shared by all (or the majority)
of dermatophyte mitochondrial genomes are as follows.
1. Retention of genome colinearity with high nucleotide
sequence similarity (>90%) in coding regions; differences
between species are largely restricted to introns and intergenic regions. 2. Strict conservation of the nad4L-nad5
gene unit; the consecutive nad4L-nad5-nad2 gene unit is
also probably present in most dermatophytes. 3. The presence of 3 tRNA gene clusters of identical composition
with 2 isolated tRNA genes at identical locations in all dermatophyte mtDNAs. 4. A characteristic rarity of intronic
sequences compared to other fungal species.
Phylogenetic analysis has confirmed the monophyletic
origin of dermatophytic fungi; these form a distinct clade
among filamentous fungi. Compared with other pathogenic fungi such as those causing invasive infections, dermatophytes comprise a closely-related and recentlydiverged lineage of ascomycota fungi. The genomic data
presented here will allow further exploration of the relationships between different dermatophyte species and
will be of general utility in the study of mitochondrial
evolution in higher fungi.

Methods
Strains and DNA preparation
Type strains of T. ajelloi (ATCC 28454),M. canis (ATCC
36299), and M. nanum (ATCC 42129) and clinical strains
of T. rubrum (BMU01672) and T. mentagrophytes
(BMU03104) were kindly provided by Ruoyu Li (Research
Center for Medical Mycology, Peking University, Beijing,
China). All strains were confirmed by ribosomal ITS
sequencing and comparison with the NCBI nucleotide
database.

Culture conditions and harvesting of mycelia were as
described previously [59]. Mycelia were ground to powder
in liquid nitrogen and samples were transferred to liquid
nitrogen-cooled 15 ml falcon tubes. Two volumes of lysis
buffer 1 (0.35 M sucrose, 50 mM Na2EDTA, 20 μg/ml proteinase K, 10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4) were added and the
mixture were vortexed vigorously for 10 min at 4°C. The
lysate was held on ice for 15 min and debris was removed
by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C).
Organelles were collected by centrifugation (30,000 rpm,
1 h, 4°C) and resuspended into buffer 2 (150 mM NaCl,
50 mM Na2EDTA, 20 μg/ml proteinase K, 10 mM Tris.HCl
pH 7.4). Total DNA was isolated using DNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (QAIGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
DNA sequencing, assembly and annotation
Three mtDNA sequences of T. rubrum strain IP1817.89

X88896 and Y98476) already covered >80% of the mitochondrial genome[60-62]. Four pairs of primers for longdistance and accurate polymerase chain reaction (LAPCR) were designed according to the known T. rubrum
sequences and their locations to the complete mitochondrial genome of E. floccosum to create a mtDNA sequence
scaffold for T. rubrum strain BMU016721 (data not
shown). The LA-PCR system contained 0.5 μl LATaq
polymerase, 5 μl 10 × LA PCR buffer, 8 μl dNTP mixture,
1 μl template DNA, 1 μl primer 1, 1 μl primer 2, and 33.5
μl dH2O to give a final volume of 50 μl. LA-PCR conditions were 94°C, 1 min; 98°C, 10 sec; 46.8°C, 15 min;
72°C, 10 min. Steps 2 and 3 were repeated for 30 cycles.
All regents were from Takara. LA-PCR products were
cloned into the PCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen).
Recombinant plasmids were analyzed by restriction analysis to confirm the presence of the insert DNA. Primerwalking methods were then used to obtain the complete
mtDNA sequence of T. rubrum.
The complete T. rubrum mitochondrial sequence revealed
that the genomes were colinear and the overall nucleotide
sequence similarity between mtDNAs of T. rubrum and E.
floccosum was >94%, indicating that the mitochondrial
genomes of these 2 species are highly conserved. Based on
this observation an optimized PCR strategy was devised
for mtDNA sequence determination for the other dermatophytes. A selected set of 41 primer pairs used for T.
rubrum mtDNA sequencing was applied to the sequencing of mtDNAs from the other dermatophyte species. In
about half of cases the expected specific amplicons were
generated (see Additional file 2). Products of length <2 kb
were sequenced after purification with QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (QAIGEN); larger amplicons were cloned
into the PCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) prior to
sequencing. Further species-specific primers were
designed as required for each genome in order to cover
remaining sequence gaps; the complete genomes were
completed by primer walking.
To confirm the authenticity of the sequences obtained, all
5 genomic sequences were confirmed by overlap PCR covering the complete mtDNA genome with direct sequencing in both directions. All sequencing was performed
using an ABI3730 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were assembled using the Phred/Phrap/
Consed package http://www.phrap.org/[63,64] with
Phred scores set at >20 corresponding to an error rate
<1%. The overall sequence quality of each genome was
further improved by applying the following 2 criteria to
each nucleotide sequenced: coverage by at least 2 independent high-quality (Phred scores >20) reads and a final
consensus quality score (Phrap) of >40.
Potential open reading frames (ORFs) were identified

program

www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/orfig.cgi based on genetic
code 4. Functional annotation employed BLASTP [64]
comparison of translations with the GenBank non-redundant protein database and manual curation. Ribosomal
RNA genes were identified by comparison with the published rRNA sequences of E. floccosum (GenBank accession: AY916130). Transfer RNA genes were identified
using the tRNAscan-SE program [65].
Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis
Genomic comparisons of dermatophyte mtDNAs
employed GenomeComp [66]. Orthologs between the
mitochondrial genomes of T. rubrum and C. albicans were
identified by bidirectional BLASTP comparisons. Fourteen
of the 15 conserved proteins (excluding Rps5) were used
for whole mitochondrial genome-based phylogenetic
analysis of 18 filamentous fungi (including 6 dermatophytes) and 17 yeasts. The sequences of the selected proteins were extracted from the fungal mitochondrial
genomes in the GenBank database. Protein sequence
alignment was carried out for each individual protein
using ClustalW [67]. Multi-alignments were then manually checked and trimmed with BioEdit (version 6.0, by
Tom Hall, Department of Microbiology, North Carolina
State University, Raleigh). The Datamonkey server was
used to calculate the mean dN/dS values of protein-coding genes for dermatophytes [68].

The dataset, a concatenation of 14 proteins comprising
4,298 amino acids, was analyzed by TREE-PUZZLE software [69] to construct the maximum likelihood (ML) tree.
Before tree construction, the ProTest software [70] was
used to test and determine optimal model-fitting of the
sequence data. The WAG model was adopted as optimal
selection. The heterogeneity rate was estimated by gamma
distribution with 8 rate categories and the α-parameter
was estimated from the dataset. Reliability of the dataset
was assessed by bootstrap. One hundred permutation
datasets were generated using the SEQBOOT program
from the PHYLIP package (version 3.68, by Joe Felsenstein, Department of Genome Sciences, University of
Washington, Seattle). For each of the 100 datasets a ML
tree was constructed using the same parameters as
described above. TREE-PUZZLE was then used with the
'consensus of user-defined trees' option to generate a consensus tree. Using the 400 Ma ascomycota fossil [44] as a
primary calibration point the dating of dermatophyte
divergence was estimated using MEGA 4.0 software [71].
