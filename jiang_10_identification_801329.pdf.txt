Abstract
Background: Fumarase catalyzes the reversible hydration of fumarate to L-malate and is a key enzyme in the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and in amino acid metabolism. Fumarase is also used for the industrial production of
L-malate from the substrate fumarate. Thermostable and high-activity fumarases from organisms that inhabit
extreme environments may have great potential in industry, biotechnology, and basic research. The marine
environment is highly complex and considered one of the main reservoirs of microbial diversity on the planet.
However, most of the microorganisms are inaccessible in nature and are not easily cultivated in the laboratory.
Metagenomic approaches provide a powerful tool to isolate and identify enzymes with novel biocatalytic activities
for various biotechnological applications.
Results: A plasmid metagenomic library was constructed from uncultivated marine microorganisms within marine water
samples. Through sequence-based screening of the DNA library, a gene encoding a novel fumarase (named FumF) was
isolated. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the FumF protein shared the greatest homology with Class II
fumarate hydratases from Bacteroides sp. 2_1_33B and Parabacteroides distasonis ATCC 8503 (26% identical and 43%
similar). The putative fumarase gene was subcloned into pETBlue-2 vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The
recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity. Functional characterization by high performance liquid
chromatography confirmed that the recombinant FumF protein catalyzed the hydration of fumarate to form L-malate. The
maximum activity for FumF protein occurred at pH 8.5 and 55°C in 5 mM Mg2+. The enzyme showed higher affinity and
catalytic efficiency under optimal reaction conditions: Km= 0.48 mM, Vmax = 827 μM/min/mg, and kcat/Km = 1900 mM/s.
Conclusions: We isolated a novel fumarase gene, fumF, from a sequence-based screen of a plasmid metagenomic
library from uncultivated marine microorganisms. The properties of FumF protein may be ideal for the industrial
production of L-malate under higher temperature conditions. The identification of FumF underscores the potential
of marine metagenome screening for novel biomolecules.

Background
Fumarase, or fumarate hydratase, (EC 4.2.1.2) is a critical enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, where
it catalyzes the reversible hydration of fumarate to
L-malate [1]. Currently, fumarases from some mesophilic

microorganisms, such as Lactobacillus brevis and Corynebacterium glutamicum, have been exploited for the
industrial production of L-malate using fumarate as a
substrate [2]. In the L-malate production process,
fumarases are often inactivated at higher temperatures
(40-60°C) and by metal ions, requiring constant replenishment of the biocatalyst [3]. Mining for thermostable
and high-activity fumarases from extreme environments
could improve industrial L-malate production.
There are two distinct classes of fumarases, classified
according to subunit composition, thermal stability, and
metal requirements [4]. The Class I fumarases, encoded

by the fumA and fumB genes, are thermolabile homodimers containing an Fe-S cluster that may catalyze the
reduction of L-malate by providing fumarate as the
anaerobic electron acceptor [5]. The FumA protein is
stable, whereas FumB protein is unstable under aerobic
conditions and functions only under anaerobic conditions [6,7]. The Class II fumarases, encoded by the
fumC gene, are thermostable homotetramers with no
requirement for cofactors and catalyze the interconversion of fumarate to L-malate [2]. FumC proteins are
widely distributed in nature, from prokaryotes like Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sulfolobus solfataricus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to mammals [3,8].
A large number of studies have focused on fumarases
from specific species of plants, mammals, and microorganisms, but very few have studied this enzyme in
uncultivated marine microorganisms. It is widely
accepted that the marine environment possesses unique
microbial diversity, and so are a vast resource for
mining novel genes and biocatalysts [9]. Ninety-nine
percent of marine microorganisms are not readily cultivated using currently available laboratory techniques
and so are not accessible to the biotechnology industry
or to basic researchers [10]. The collective genomes of
all microorganisms present in a given habitat, the socalled metagenome [11,12], has been screened for biocatalysts and other biomolecules for new biotechnological
applications or simply to understand the microbial ecology and physiology of the marine environment. The
most important advantage of the metagenomic library is
that it contains genomes from many species of microorganisms; thus, it provides a more comprehensive collection of global microbiological information [13].
Currently, various industrial enzymes, including
esterases or lipases, proteases, amylases, nitrilases, and
lyases, have been identified through the metagenomic
approach [14,15].
In this study, a plasmid metagenomic library was constructed from marine water samples. Through sequencebased screening of the DNA library, a gene encoding a
novel fumarase (named FumF) was isolated. The
deduced amino acid sequence exhibited moderate similarity to a family of Class II fumarase proteins. Biochemical analysis of the expressed recombinant protein
revealed that FumF catalyzed the hydration of fumaric
acid to form L-malate. To our knowledge, this is the
first report on a fumarase isolated from a marine
metagenome.

Results and Discussion
Construction of marine microbial metagenomic library

Metagenomic DNA was directly extracted from marine
water samples. The constructed library should contain
genes from all the microorganisms in the sample,

Page 2 of 9

including species that have not been classified or that
cannot be cultivated. Approximately 50-80 μg of crude
DNA extract was obtained from 100 L of sea water.
Most of the DNA molecules were about 23 kb as
revealed by a strong band on agarose gels (data not
shown). A similar DNA yield with approximately the
same dominant band (≈23 kb) was reported following
marine water DNA isolation in the previous study [16].
The crude extract was separated on a low-melting agarose gel to further purify the DNA. The DNA collected
from the agarose gel was partially digested with EcoRI
and ligated with the EcoRI-cleaved pGEM-3Zf(+) vector.
The final plasmid metagenomic library was constructed
from 10 μg of purified sea water DNA and contained
approximately 50,000 clones. Restriction analysis of randomly chosen recombinant plasmids revealed a high
level of diversity of foreign DNA fragments in pGEM3Zf(+). When EcoRI-digested plasmids from 11
randomly picked clones were analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis, the sizes of the inserts ranged from
1-15 kb, with an average of about 4.0 kb (see Additional
file 1). These results indicated that the marine library
covered ≈200 Mb and that screening the metagenome
DNA library could yield novel functional genes [17,18].
Bioinformatics analysis and cloning of a fumarase gene

The metagenome plasmid library was grown on microplates. Bacterial cultures were amplified, pelleted, and
lysed. Randomly chosen recombinant plasmids were
sequenced and analyzed. The DNA sequence analysis
and database search revealed that three out of the 15
open reading frames (ORFs) of predicted genes exhibited over 80% similarity to known genes, while the other
12 recombinant plasmids did not match any known
sequence in the database (detailed data not shown).
This result confirmed that the marine metagenomic
library contained DNA molecules from uncharacterized
genomes, and demonstrated that the marine metagenome of naturally occurring bacteria contained an
immense pool of genes, most of which are not represented in pure or enriched cultures established under
selective conditions [19].
Using a sequence-based strategy, we screened the
metagenomic library and identified an interesting recombinant clone, pGXAM3566, that may encode a fumarase
enzyme. The insert DNA had a length of 2011 bp, and
showed no good matches at the DNA level with known
genes in the database. However, pGXAM3566 showed
moderate homology to some fumarate hydratases at the
amino acid level. Based on the database comparison, we
considered the cloned gene pGXAM3566 novel and
named it fumF. The gene had a long ORF of 1371 bp (G
+ C content of 57.8%) that encoded a 457 amino acid
protein. The predicted Mr was approximately 49.2 kDa

Jiang et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:91
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/9/1/91

with an isoelectric point of 4.8, similar to the 48-50 kDa
Mr of most FumC proteins [7]. When the deduced
amino acid sequence of FumF was searched against the
NCBI and Expasy databases, FumF protein was found to
share partial homology with the Class II fumarate hydratases from Bacteroides sp. 2_1_33B and Parabacteroides
distasonis ATCC 8503 (26% identical and 43% similar).
Other Class II fumarate hydratases with partial homology
were fumarate hydratases from Parabacteroides sp. D13
(GenBank accession no. ZP_05544942; 25% identical and
42% similar), Bacteroides sp. 3_1_19 (GenBank accession
no. ZP_06985098; 25% identical and 42% similar), and
Bacteroides sp. 2_1_7 (GenBank accession no.
ZP_05287561; 25% identical and 42% similar).
Multiple alignments with the most homologous
fumarases proteins (NCBI database) are presented in
Figure 1. The FumF protein showed greater homology
with bacterial fumarases than with eukaryotic homologues. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that
the deduced FumF peptide shared the conserved active
site residues of other Class II fumarases. In contrast, an
amino acid N-terminal extension was present only in
the bacteria fumarases (Figure 1). Based on amino acid

numbers. Sequence similarity searches were performed with the
BLAST 2.0 program. Amino acid sequence alignment of the target
putative protein with homologous proteins was performed with the
Align × program, a component of the Vector NTI suite (Informax,
North Bethesda, MD, USA), using the blosum62mt2 scoring matrix.

sequence homology, FumF may be a new member of
the Class II fumarate hydratases [7].
A phylogenetic tree based on the neighbor-joining
method place FumF protein in a distinct clade from
the Class II fumarases found in other microorganisms
(Figure 2). Such a placement suggests a relatively high
level of divergence for the Class II fumarases. The FumF
protein was also not grouped with eukaryotic homologues, reflecting considerable dissimilarities between
the eukaryotes and prokaryotes furmarases. Sequence
comparison between FumF protein and others FumCs
revealed many differences clustered at the 5’ end of the
coding sequence.
Expression and purification of recombinant FumF protein

To investigate the biochemical properties of FumF, the
gene was subcloned in frame with a six-histidine tag
sequence into the expression vector pETBlue-2 and
expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The initial analysis
of the crude cell lysate revealed that the bacteria containing recombinant plasmid pETBlue-2-fumF produced
a substantial amount of the expected recombinant protein, while FumF was not detectable in bacteria containing the parent vector pETBlue-2. Protein extracts were
subjected to SDS-PAGE. Increased expression of a ≈ 55
kDa protein was observed in cell extracts of

Figure 2 Phylogenetic relationship of FumF protein with other
fumarases. Sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW
version 1.81, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the
neighbor-joining method using MEGA version 4.0 [30]. Bootstrapping values were used to estimate the reliability of
phylogenetic reconstructions (1,000 replicates). The numbers
associated with the branches refer to bootstrap values (confidence
limits) representing the substitution frequencies per amino acid
residue. Fumarases are identified by their GenBank accession
numbers.

recombinant FumF. The molecular weight of the protein
was similar to recombinant FumF, indicating that FumF
was probably expressed intracellularly without extensive
modifications. The recombinant FumF protein was then
purified by Ni-NTA Magnetic Agarose Chromatography
(Figure 3). The separated proteins produced a single
band on SDS-PAGE gels, and the molecular weight concurred with that deduced from the amino acid sequence
of the recombinant protein.
Functional characterization and physicochemical
characterization of recombinant FumF protein

We confirmed that the purified recombinant FumF protein exhibited fumarase activity by HPLC analysis of the
reaction product (see Additional file 2). The retention
time of the enzymatic product was 7.369 min, matching
that of an L-malate standard (7.4 min), and different
with the substrate fumarate peak.
The functional characterization of FumF may provide
new insights into the relationship between sequence,
structure, and activity of Class II fumarases [20].
Furthermore, functional characterization could reveal

novel uses for FumF. Elucidating the catalyzing mechanism through studies of the 3 D structures of FumF protein with X-ray diffraction methods is also an interesting
direction for future research.
The enzymatic activity of the purified FumF protein was
measured at various pHs from 6.5-9.5 to determine the
optimal pH for fumarase activity. Activity of the recombinant enzyme was highest at pH 8.5 and dramatically
suppressed below pH 7.0 and above pH 9.0 (Figure 4).
The observed pH range of the recombinant enzyme was
consistent with the reported properties of a thermostable
Class II fumarase from Thermus thermophilus [21]. To
determine the optimal temperature for the enzymatic
reaction catalyzed by FumF, activity was measured at pH
8.5 over the temperature range 25-65°C. The enzyme
demonstrated only 70% of its maximum activity below
40°C, but exhibited >70% of its maximum activity between
40-60°C, and maximal activity at approximately 55°C
(Figure 5). This optimal temperature was about 5°C higher
than that reported for stFumC protein from Streptomyces
thermovulgaris [22]. To determine the thermostability of
FumF, we incubated the purified putative fumarase in a
water bath at temperatures between 15-70°C for up to
30 min and measured the residual activity with added substrate at pH 8.5 and 55°C. The activity of FumF was stable
with increasing temperature below 58°C in the absence of
any stabilizer (Figure 6). When the temperature was higher
than 60°C, FumF protein lost almost 50% of its activity.
This result suggests that FumF protein was derived from a
thermophilic microorganism and is relatively stable below
60°C. Furthermore, the thermal properties of FumF protein suggest potential applications in biotechnology.
Class II fumarase activity is frequently influenced by
divalent metal ions and non-ionic surfactants, so the
effects of metal ions, EDTA, and SDS on the hydration
activity of FumF were determined. Enzyme activity

recombinant FumF protein. The buffers used were 50 mM citric
acid/100 mM Na2HPO4 buffer (black regular triangle) (pH 3.0-8.0)
and 100 mM glycine/NaOH buffer (black square) (pH 8.0-9.5).
Relative activities represent enzyme activities at each pH divided by
maximal activity.

thermovulgaris [22]. These results also indicated that the
active catalytic domain of FumF protein does not contain
a potential metal ion binding site.
Enzyme kinetics of recombinant FumF protein

recombinant FumF protein. Relative activities are the raw enzyme
activities at each temperature divided by the maximal activity.

without added metal ions was taken as the baseline
(100%). The presence of 5 mM MgCl2 stimulated enzyme
activity to a maximum value of 110% of baseline, whereas
NH4Cl, FeCl2, FeCl3, and ZnCl2 dramatically reduced the
enzymatic activity to 77%, 63%, 52.6%, and 45%, respectively. By contrast, neither CaCl2 nor the calcium chelator EDTA (≤ 2 mM) altered enzymatic activity. When the
concentration of EDTA was higher than 2.5 mM, enzyme
activity was reduced by more than 20%. Enzyme activity
was suppressed by 37% in CuCl2, while the anionic surfactant SDS reduced activity by 50% in the absence of metal
ions. These results suggest that FumF is a Mg2+-dependent
enzyme with optimal activity at 5 mM Mg2+ and different
with a fumarase from Arabidopsis thaliana [23]. The
enzyme activity reached 726 U/mg protein using fumarate
as the substrate under the optimal reaction conditions.
The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme was
higher than a fumarase from Corynebacterium glutamicum [2] and a stFumC protein from Streptomyces

The kinetic parameters of the recombinant FumF enzyme
were determined using different fumarate concentrations.
The initial rate of the enzyme reaction was measured
under optimal reaction conditions. The reaction kinetic
parameters of the purified enzyme were determined from
double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. The putative
fumarase had an apparent Km value of 0.48 mM, a Vmax
value of 827 μM/min/mg, and a kcat/Km value of 1900/
mM/s with fumarate as the substrate. Table 1 compares
the properties of various fumarases from a number of different sources. FumF protein had a comparable kcat/Km
value to most [7,24]. In comparison, the K m values of
purified fumarases from other sources ranged from 0.251.0 mM (Table 1). The Km value for FumF protein was
similar to that of the MmcBC fumarase from Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum strain SI (DSM 13744) [7].
A more complete analysis of the optimal reaction conditions and properties of FumF protein could enable better
industrial production of L-malate under higher temperature conditions [25]. Furthermore, elucidating the catalytic mechanism through studies of the 3 D structures of
FumF protein by X-ray diffraction could define protein
regions that determine catalytic rates.

Conclusions
We constructed a plasmid library from marine water
samples and cloned a novel fumarase gene (fumF) by a
sequence-based screening strategy. Sequence analysis
suggested that the identified gene product was related to
prokaryotic Class II fumarases. A detailed biochemical
characterization was also performed that encompassed
the amino acid sequence, specific activity, pH-activity
profile, and metal ion-activity profile. Identification of a
new fumarase from marine microorganisms highlights
the advantages of metagenomic libraries for cloning
novel genes through sequence-based screening [26].
A similar approach can also be employed to find other
biomolecules with applications in biotechnology.
Methods
DNA manipulation and protein analysis

Figure 6 The thermostability of recombinant FumF protein. The
enzyme was pre-incubated at temperature ranging from 15 to 70°C
at optimum pH. Subsequently, the residual activity was determined
with fumarate as the substrate at 55°C in 100 mM glycine/NaOH
buffer (pH 8.5).

All recombinant DNA techniques, including cloning and
subcloning, transformation of E. coli cells, and PCR,
were performed as described [27] or by following the
manufacturer’s instructions (unless otherwise indicated).
Protein preparation and analysis, including protein
extraction from E. coli, protein quantification, and SDSPAGE, were performed as described in standard protocols [28].

DNA extraction from marine sediment samples and
construction of metagenomic library

Approximately 1000 L of surface seawater was collected
from the South China Sea (21° 28’ N, 109° 07’ E) on 28
March 2007. The pH was 8.2, the temperature 15°C, and
salinity 3.2%. Bacterial cells were collected by filtration on
a membrane of 0.45 μm pore size (GE Whatman), recovered by washing the membrane with 1 × STE buffer, and
concentrated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min.
High molecular weight DNA from the sea samples was
extracted based on a method described previously [29],
with minor modifications. Briefly, the microbial DNA was
washed twice with 75% (v/v) ethanol, air dried, and dissolved in 1 × TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1
mM Na 2 EDTA). To remove contaminants, the DNA
extract was further purified on a 0.6% (w/v) low-melting
agarose gel run at 60 V for 3 h. The DNA fragments (≈ 23
kb) were recovered from the gel. The purified DNA was
partially digested with EcoRI, followed by size fractionation
with low-melting agarose gel as described [16]. Fractions
containing DNA fragments of 1.0-15 kb were ligated into
EcoRI-cleaved and dephosphorylated pGEM-3Zf (+) vector, and the ligation products were used to transfect competent E. coli DH5a. After overnight growth on LB agar
plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, white colonies harboring plasmids bearing inserts were collected and used to
construct the metagenomic library. This library was stored
at -80°C until screening.
DNA sequence analysis, database search, and gene
structure characterization

Sequence analysis was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit on an ABI Prism 3700 DNA
analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Protein translation
was carried out with the Web-based translation tool at
the Expasy homepage http://www.expasy.org/tools/dna.
html. Sequence predictions were retrieved from the protein and nucleotide databases of the National Center for

Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez page http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/. Sequence similarity
searches were performed with BLAST 2.0. Amino acid
sequence alignment of Undec1A with homologous proteins was conducted with Align X, a component of the
Vector NTI suite (Informax, North Bethesda, MD, USA),
using the blosum62mt2 scoring matrix. Based on comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence, a gene
(fumF) encoding a putative novel fumarase was identified
and further characterized. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method with Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis 3.1 (MEGA,
Version 4.0) [30]. A boot-strapping value was used to
estimate the reliability of phylogenetic reconstructions
(1000 replicates).
Expression and purification of the recombinant
fumarase protein

The fumF nucleotide sequence was amplified from the
plasmid (pGXAM3566) isolated from a clone with fumarase activity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried
out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 mM MgCl2,
10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 0.2 mM of each dNTP,
0.4 μM of each primer, 1.0 unit Vent DNA polymerase
(NEB, USA), and 10 ng plasmid template. Restriction
enzyme sites (underlined) for BamHI and HindIII were
designed in the forward primer and reverse primers:
(5’-TTATGGATCCGATGGATGTTGAAGCTG -3’/5’GGCAAGCTTTAGGGCGAATTCCGG -3’). The PCR
cycle consisted of an initial denaturation step of 96°C for 2
min, then 30 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 57°C for 30 s, and
72°C for 2 min, followed by a final extension step at 72°C
for 10 min. After amplification, the PCR product mixture
was digested with BamHI and HindIII, and ligated directly
into pETBlue-2 (Novagen) expression vector cleaved with
the same enzymes. The resultant recombinant plasmids
were transferred into NovaBlue (Novagen) competent cells
and plated onto LB selection plates. After overnight

Jiang et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:91
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/9/1/91

incubation at 37°C, positive white colonies were picked for
isolation of the recombinant expression plasmid, which
was subsequently introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS
(Novagen) to express the target protein.
The transformed bacterial cells were cultured in LB
medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 100 μg/
ml chloramphenicol at 37°C, and protein expression was
induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside when the optical density at 660 nm
reached 0.6. After incubation for an additional 6 h, the
cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS (pH 7.6),
and lysed by sonication in 10 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0. The lysate was centrifuged twice at 30,000 ×g
for 20 min at 4°C, and 1 ml of the supernatant was
diluted with 5 ml of column buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl) and applied
onto an equilibrated nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (NiNTA) column containing 1 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose
(Novagen). The His-tagged FumF protein was expressed
and purified using Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The protein concentration was determined
by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The protein purified with Ni-NTA
column and gel filtration was used for enzyme activity
assays.

50 mM L-malate or fumarate adjusted to pH 7.3 with
NaOH. The increase in absorbance at 250 nm was measured as a function of time. One unit of enzyme activity
was defined as the amount of the enzyme that converts 1
μmol substrate per min under standard assay conditions.
The profiles of activity versus pH and activity versus
temperature were determined using the standard assay
method. All experiments were performed in triplicate. To
measure the effect of pH on the activity of the recombinant FumF protein, the enzyme activity was assayed over
the pH range 3.0-8.0 in 50 mM citric acid/100 mM
Na2HPO4 buffer, while over pH 8.0-9.5, the activity was
assayed in 100 mM glycine/NaOH buffer. To assess the
effect of temperature on FumF activity, the enzyme was
assayed at various temperatures (25 to 60°C) in 100 mM
glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 8.5). Thermostability was determined by pre-incubating the purified enzyme for up to 30
min at temperatures ranging from 15 to 70°C in 100 mM
glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 8.5) and analyzing the residual
activity with fumarate as the substrate [34,35]. Various
metal compounds (NH4Cl, MgCl2, CuCl2, CaCl2, MnCl2,
ZnCl2, FeCl2, FeCl3, AlCl3), a chelating agent (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, EDTA), and surfactant (sodium
dodecyl sulfate, SDS) were added to optimal reaction systems to investigate their effects on enzyme activity. Unless
otherwise specified, the concentrations were 0.5-10 mM
metal ions, 2 mM EDTA, and 1% (v/v) SDS.

Identification of the hydration product

The hydration product of the putative FumF was identified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Sodium fumarate (Sigma) was used as the substrate for
characterization of the fumarase. The standard incubation mixture for fumarase activity consisted of 50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 10 mM sodium fumarate, and approximately 20 μl fumarase in 1 ml buffer.
The final enzyme concentration was adjusted to approximately 1.5 μg/μl. The reaction was conducted in a total
volume of 1.5 ml at 37°C for 15 min. Upon termination
of the reaction, the residual protein was removed by centrifugation through a protein binding membrane (Vivaspin 500, Vivascience, Littleton, MA, USA). The filtered
reaction sample was separated on a reverse phase C18
column (125 × 4 mm, Waters, USA) and UV detector at
210 nm [31]. The mobile phase was water of pH 2.10 to
2.15 (adjusted with perchloric acid) at a flow rate of 0.7
ml/min. The analysis was performed at 30°C.
Partial physicochemical characterization of the
recombinant fumarase protein

Unless otherwise specified, fumarase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the conversion of L-malate to fumarate or fumarate to L-malate at
250 nm and 37°C as described [32,33] with a few modifications. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.5 ml

Enzyme kinetic assays

Enzyme kinetic parameters of FumF protein were determined by measuring the rate of fumarase hydration at various concentrations (0.1-5.0 mM) and dehydration of Lmalate at various concentrations (0.07-5.5 mM) at 55°C in
100 mM glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 8.5). The final enzyme
concentration was adjusted to approximately 15 μM. The
enzyme kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were determined
from Lineweaver-Burk plots using the Enzyme Kinetics
computer program [36].
Nucleotide sequence accession number

The fumF nucleotide sequence has been deposited in
the GenBank under accession number GQ353347.
