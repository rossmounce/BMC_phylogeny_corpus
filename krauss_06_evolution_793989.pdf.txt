Abstract
Background: In eukaryotes, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is a common mechanism
involved in gene silencing and the establishment of heterochromatin. The loci of the major
heterochromatic H3K9 methyltransferase Su(var)3-9 and the functionally unrelated γ subunit of the
translation initiation factor eIF2 are fused in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we examined the
phylogenetic distribution of this unusual gene fusion and the molecular evolution of the H3K9
HMTase Su(var)3-9.
Results: We show that the gene fusion had taken place in the ancestral line of winged insects and
silverfishs (Dicondylia) about 400 million years ago. We cloned Su(var)3-9 genes from a collembolan
and a spider where both genes ancestrally exist as independent transcription units. In contrast, we
found a Su(var)3-9-specific exon inside the conserved intron position 81-1 of the eIF2γ gene
structure in species of eight different insect orders. Intriguinly, in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum,
we detected only sequence remains of this Su(var)3-9 exon in the eIF2γ intron, along with an eIF2γindependent Su(var)3-9 gene. This reveals an evolutionary re-fission of both genes in aphids.
Su(var)3-9 chromo domains are similar to HP1 chromo domains, which points to a potential
binding activity to methylated K9 of histone H3. SET domain comparisons suggest a weaker
methyltransferase activity of Su(var)3-9 in comparison to other H3K9 HMTases. Astonishingly, 11
of 19 previously described, deleterious amino acid substitutions found in Drosophila Su(var)3-9 are
seemingly compensable through accompanying substitutions during evolution.
Conclusion: Examination of the Su(var)3-9 evolution revealed strong evidence for the
establishment of the Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ gene fusion in an ancestor of dicondylic insects and a re-fission
of this fusion during the evolution of aphids. Our comparison of 65 selected chromo domains and
93 selected SET domains from Su(var)3-9 and related proteins offers functional predictions
concerning both domains in Su(var)3-9 proteins.

Background
Heterochromatin typically represents a large differenti-

ated chromatin compartment within eukaryotic nuclei
(reviewed in [1]). While the mechanisms involved in

The Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ gene fusion as it was previously found in several holometabolic insects [10]. In this schematic drawing, a Su(var)3-9-specific exon is shown inside the conserved eIF2γ intron 81-1, which is situated after the first
nucleotide of the D. melanogaster-codon 81 of eIF2γ. This gene structure expresses two mRNA variants, which encode two
functionally unrelated proteins, through 3'alternative splicing from a common promoter and was detected in several species of
flies, butterflies and beetles.

molecular definition of facultative heterochromatin seem
diverse [2,3], the central role of histone H3 lysine 9 diand trimethylation (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) for the
establishment of constitutive heterochromatin and heterochromatic gene silencing has been shown for Drosophila, Schizosaccharomyces and Arabidopsis [4-7]. The
majority of this heterochromatic H3K9 methylation is
mediated by histone methyltransferases (HMTases) of the
Su(var)3-9 family (for review see [8]). While the phylogenetic distribution of the Su(var)3-9-linked silencing pathway seems fairly broad, we note that so far all examined
organisms have pericentromeric heterochromatin, which
covers the main chromosomal distribution of the
Su(var)3-9 protein in Drosophila [4].
The Su(var)3-9 encoding gene of Drosophila melanogaster,
originally isolated as dominant suppressor of positioneffect variegation (PEV), expresses two distinct mRNA
classes of 2.0 and 2.4 kb [9]. These mRNA variants emerge
via 3' alternative splicing and have the first 80 amino acid
residues of their open reading frames in common (Fig. 1).
The molecular analysis of mutants showed that the PEV
suppressor function is exclusively connected with the 2.4
kb mRNA which encodes Su(var)3-9 [9]. In contrast, the
2.0 kb mRNA codes for the γ subunit of the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2γ) [10].
In known non-insect genomes, both Su(var)3-9 and eIF2γ
are independent genes. Su(var)3-9 proteins bind to chromosomes in the nucleus, whereas eIF2γ proteins are cytoplasmic and interact temporary with ribosomes. Su(var)39 orthologues are histone H3K9-specific methyltransferases. In contrast, eIF2γ is a subunit of a G protein that
delivers the methionyl initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit and releases it upon GTP hydrolysis following the recognition of the initiation codon (for review see
[11]). Despite their disparity in function and evolution,

the Drosophila Genome Database [12] classified the two
proteins as derived from a single gene.
Here we studied Su(var)3-9 orthologues, mainly of
arthropods, to understand the following issues of interest:
(1) How far is the Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ gene fusion distributed phylogenetically? (2) How stable is this gene
arrangement in evolution? (3) Do Su(var)3-9 HMTases
also exist in species with holocentric chromosomes (for
e.g. earwigs, hemipterids, butterflies), which do not contain pericentromeric heterochromatin? (4) How do the
amino acid substitutions of Drosophila Su(var)3-9
mutant proteins lead to deleterious phenotypes?
Here we show that the natural gene fusion of Su(var)3-9
and eIF2γ had taken place in the ancestral line of winged
insects and silverfishs about 400 million years ago. We
cloned Su(var)3-9 from a collembolan and a spider where
both genes ancestrally exist as independent transcription
units. In contrast, we found a Su(var)3-9-specific exon
inside the conserved intron position 81-1 of the eIF2γ
gene structure in more than a dozen insect species which
are members of eight different orders. However, the aphid
Aphis sambuci does not contain a Su(var)3-9-specific exon
at any position of the otherwise conserved eIF2γ gene
structure. In the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, we identified non-functional remains of this Su(var)3-9 exon in the
eIF2γ intron, along with a novel, eIF2γ-independent
Su(var)3-9 gene copy. These pieces of evidence demonstrate an evolutionary re-fission of Su(var)3-9 from eIF2γ
in aphids. Furthermore, we explored the phylogenetic distribution of Su(var)3-9-orthologous proteins by bioinformatic means and used the identified Su(var)3-9 protein
sequences for phylogenetic analysis to uncover times of
Suv39h duplications occurred during the evolution of vertebrates. Su(var)3-9 chromo and SET domains were compared to exploit evolutionary and mutant substitutions

Alignment of selected Su(var)3-9 proteins
Alignment of selected Su(var)3-9 proteins. Arthropod proteins with and without N-terminal eIF2γ fusion are represented by Drosophila melanogaster (Dme) [9], Cercopis vulnerata (Cvu, cicada), Acyrthosiphon pisum (Api, aphid), Enallagma cyathigerum (Ecy, damselfly), Lepisma saccharina (Lsa, silverfish) and Araneus diadematus (Adi, spider). Additionally, human SUVH1 is
shown (Hsa) [13]. Identical amino acid residues are underlaid dark gray, whereas similar residues are marked light gray. The
domains of Su(var)3-9 are marked below the alignment. Binding sites of used degenerate oligonucleotide primers are shown
above the sequences.

regions.

Results
Su(var)3-9 gene identification, alignment and
phylogenetic analysis
We cloned Su(var)3-9 cDNAs from ten distantly related
arthropod species, which are Araneus diadematus (spider),
Allacma fusca (springtail), Lepisma saccharina (silverfish),
Enallagma cyathigerum (damselfly), Forficula auricularia
(earwig), Acyrthosiphon pisum (aphid), Cercopis vulnerata
(cicada), Apis mellifera (honey bee), Bombyx mori (silk
worm) and Drosophila nasutoides [see Additional file 1].

Additionally, Su(var)3-9 sequences of 18 metazoan species, including 9 further arthropods, were retrieved by
database mining. Eight other Su(var)3-9 orthologues have
been described previously [9,10,13,14]. With the exception of Takifugu, Tetraodon, Oryzias (all fishes), Tribolium (red flour beetle) and most Drosophila species, all
Su(var)3-9 genes are proved to be transcribed (Tab. 1). By
analysis of recent genome projects we found that the
Su(var)3-9 gene is a single copy gene, except in most vertebrates and some nematodes. All nematode sequences
were excluded from the sequence set, because the corresponding Su(var)3-9-like ORFs showed highly divergent
sequences. We also excluded all mammalian sequences

Residual Su(var)3-9 ORF in the eIF2γ intron 81-1 of pea aphids. This reading frame is located between nucleotide 2138

38 Su(var)3-9 proteins in the corresponding region SET-C. Positions are given according to D. melanogaster Su(var)3-9. Identical and similar amino acids are marked. Residues found identically in the majority of Su(var)3-9 proteins are boxed grey.

other than Homo and Mus, because protein identity
between these species is exceedingly high. In total, this led
to the selection of 40 complete sequences in 36 species
(Tab. 1).
An alignment of these Su(var)3-9 proteins was obtained.
During this step, the sequences from Dictyostelium discoideum and Hydra magnipapillata were excluded because
these proteins do not contain a chromo domain. In
Hydra, this is proven by a translation stop signal in frame
with and upstream of a putative start AUG which is identically contained in three different ESTs. In the remaining
alignment, positional identity was impossible to establish
in areas located N-terminal of the chromo domain (Fig.
2). Therefore, these residues were truncated, leaving 545
alignment positions for analysis. The final Su(var)3-9 protein alignment [see Additional file 2] indicates that 21%
of the included Su(var)3-9 amino acid residues are identical in 90% of the metazoan species studied. Moreover,
235 residues (43%) are identical in more than 50% of the
proteins.
Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using this alignment
including all Su(var)3-9 protein parts except the common
region with eIF2γ and the region 2 (Fig. 2) [see Additional
file 2] and implementing BI, ML, MP and weighbor methods (see Materials and Methods). The weighbor tree,
which provides additional branching information from
the other trees, is presented (Fig. 3). Monophyletic groups
of Vertebrata, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Culicidae and
Drosophila were strongly supported within all analyses.
The groupings of Diptera and Mecopteroidea (Diptera+Lepidoptera) also gained remarkable support. However, other arthropod taxa (for e.g. Pterygota, Hexapoda
and Arthropoda itself) were not consistently supported.
Suv39h of the chordate Ciona branches as sister group of
Vertebrata in BI and MP analyses only (data not shown).
In spite of this, the tree dates the Suv39h gene duplication
previously found in man and mouse [13] as occurred in
the last common ancestor of tetrapodes. An independent
duplication exists in Danio rerio (zebra fish), designated
Suv39h1a and Suv39h1b by us, which cannot be found in
other teleosts as Oryzias, Tetraodon and Takifugu. Topol-

ogy and branch lengths reveal a slightly relaxed purifying
evolution during the early divergence of the paralogous
genes Suv39h2 and Suv39h1b.
Phylogenetic mapping of the Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ gene fusion
Next, we undertook a mapping of major evolutionary
transitions of Su(var)3-9 genes and proteins using commonly accepted phylogenetic relationships (Fig. 4).
Accordingly, Su(var)3-9-like H3K9 methyltransferases
might have gained the chromo domain in the common
ancestor of fungi and animals, because the Schizosaccharomyces Su(var)3-9 ortholog Clr4p also contains this
domain. If this is correctly inferred, the chromo domain
of Su(var)3-9-like proteins got lost at least two times independently during the evolution of ascomycetes (dim-5
proteins of Neurospora and five other species of Euascomycetes) and of cnidarians (Hydra). Alternatively, both
bilaterian animals and an ancestor of fission yeast
acquired chromo domains independently. Interestingly,
plant SUVH H3K9 HMTases had gained a YDG domain
instead of a chromo domain [15]. Like classical chromo
domains [16], the YDG domain displays a strong interaction with the N-terminal tail of histone H3 [17] and
might, thus, be convergent to Su(var)3-9 chromo
domains.

In bilaterian animals, the chromo domain appears obligatory for Su(var)3-9 proteins. However, there is a great
variability in length and sequence of the protein region Nterminal to the chromo domain. We found that, in true
insects (Ectognatha), this protein region generally contains the N-terminus of the functionally unrelated γ subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor2 (eIF2γ).
Moreover, we detected that in twelve genera of insects,
belonging to the eight different orders Zygentoma, Odonata, Dermaptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera,
Lepidoptera and Diptera, Su(var)3-9 and eIF2γ mRNAs
have identical 5'ends, encoding a common N-terminus of
both proteins that is between 79 to 84 amino acid residues long (Fig. 2, 4). In 20 out of 22 examined species of
true insects, we gained evidence by genomic and/or cDNA
sequence analysis that a Su(var)3-9-specific exon is
located inside the intron 81-1 of eIF2γ . In each case, the

Page 6 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:18

expression of both gene products is regulated by alternative splicing. The common N-terminus of both proteins
takes part in important functions inside eIF2γ proteins
(for e.g. GTP binding) but does not constitute a closed
globular domain [18]. In Drosophila Su(var)3-9, this
common N-terminus might be involved in completely
unrelated functions (see below). The totally different role
of the common N-terminus in both proteins led us to conclude that the fusion of the Su(var)3-9 and the eIF2γ gene
was a non-selected, accidental evolutionary event. Therefore, it should have occurred only once.
On the other hand, we cloned non-fused, complete
Su(var)3-9 cDNAs and gene structures from Araneus diadematus (spider, Chelicerata) and Allacma fusca (springtail,
Collembola). We noted further that the eIF2γ intron 81-1,
containing the Su(var)3-9-specific exon under fused conditions, was found in all examined Hexapoda (including
Allacma fusca, where it does not contain a Su(var)3-9
exon) and in Oniscus asellus (woodlouse, Crustacea) but
not outside the Pancrustacea [19]. Thus, the Su(var)3-9/
eIF2γ gene fusion has occurred in the common ancestor of
winged insects and silverfishs after the branching of collembolans and may be a synapomorphy of the Dicondylia
or the Ectognatha (Dicondylia+Archaeognatha).
Concomitantly, we got evidence that this gene fusion has
become evolutionarily reverted at least once during the
evolution of hemipterid insects. The complete Su(var)3-9
cDNA and gene structure from the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon
pisum (Fig. 2, 4) was cloned. No similarities to eIF2γ
sequences were found in this Su(var)3-9 gene, and the 811 introns of the eIF2γ genes of Acyrthosiphon pisum and
Aphis sambuci do not contain a Su(var)3-9-specific exon.
Most interestingly, whereas the Aphis intron does not
show significant similarities to other Genbank sequences,
the Acyrthosiphon intron reveals a residual similarity to
Su(var)3-9 SET domain sequences (Fig. 5). In RT-PCR
experiments, we did not detect any expression of this
genomic region. We conclude that the fusion of Su(var)39 and eIF2γ established in true insects was re-fissioned in
a common ancestor of Acyrthosiphon and Aphis.
Alternatively, the Acyrthosiphon Su(var)3-9 gene might
represent an unfused paralog, which exists beside of the
Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ gene fusion in all true insects. Three
arguments render this hypothesis highly improbable. (1)
We have cloned Su(var)3-9 independently of eIF2γ from
five genera of insects (Lepisma, Enallagma, Cercopis, Clytus and Scoliopteryx) and identified the connection with
eIF2γ in each case later. (2) We were unable to detect an
additional, non-fused Su(var)3-9 gene in complete or
almost complete sequenced genomes of six insect genera
(Apis, Tribolium, Bombyx, Aedes, Anopheles and Drosophila). (3) Both introns found in the non-fused

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/18

Acyrthosiphon Su(var)3-9 gene are novel, because all
introns identified in other metazoan Su(var)3-9 genes
including the collembolan Allacma fusca are located in
non-homologous positions of the ORF (data not shown).
Thus, it is supposed that the aphid gene has acquired these
introns after the fission of Su(var)3-9 from an eIF2γ gene.
Therefore, we summarize that Su(var)3-9 represents a
gene which was fused with and re-fissioned from a functionally unrelated gene during the evolution of insects.
Molecular evolution and functional aspects of Su(var)3-9
protein domains
The conservation of the chromo, preSET, SET and postSET
regions shows that the corresponding domains has been
subjected to strong purifying selection. In contrast, the
regions 2, 4 and 7 of the Su(var)3-9 alignment (Fig. 2)
reveal much less sequence conservation. Whereas region 4
and 7 do not associate with any known function, region 2
serves, possibly together with the common region of eIF2γ
and Su(var)3-9, as dimerization domain in Drosophila
and is involved in interaction with HP1 and Su(var)3-7
[4,20]. Thus, the D. melanogaster N-terminus is essential
for full enzymatic activity, which is obtained through
Su(var)3-9 dimerization, and correct nuclear localization,
which is dependent on interactions with HP1 and
Su(var)3-7 [4,21]. At least the HP1 interaction seems to be
conserved in the N-terminus of the mammal Suv39h1
proteins [13], however, there cannot be found conserved
amino acid residues N-terminal of the chromo domain
between insect and vertebrate proteins (Fig. 2 and data
not shown). A significant conservation of region 2 was
identified only between Su(var)3-9 proteins found in species of the same insect order. The Predict Protein server
[22] predicts highly diverse, loop-rich secondary structures in this region, and a SEG analysis [23] detected
repetitive sequence elements in region 2 of 11 out of 16
arthropod genera. Thus, we argue that region 2 is only
weakly evolutionarily constrained in insects. Moreover,
Schizosaccharomyces Clr4p and Acyrthosiphon Su(var)39 contain only six or eight amino acid residues N-terminal
to the chromo domain, respectively. Together, these
pieces of evidence constrict the functional conservation
between arthropod and chordate Su(var)3-9 proteins to
chromo, preSET, SET and postSET regions, which does not
exclude a random co-localization of functions in other
regions of Su(var)3-9 orthologues.

Chromo domains were detected in all bilaterian Su(var)39 proteins and in Clr4p of fission yeast (Fig. 2, 4). Functional analyses of diverse chromo domains revealed an
unexpected diversity of interactions, including those with
histone H3 tails, DNA and RNA (for review see [16]).
Although the chromo domain is important for heterochromatic binding of Su(var)3-9 proteins in Schizosaccharomyces, mammals and Drosophila [4,24,25], the

Chromo6domain comparison between selected Su(var)3-9, HP1 and Polycomb proteins
Chromo domain comparison between selected Su(var)3-9, HP1 and Polycomb proteins. A. Alignment of consensus sequences. Absolute identical residues are black boxed, 75–99%-identical ones are dark grey boxed and 74–50% identical
amino acid positions are light grey boxed for each class of orthologues. Functionally important residues are marked by a filled
triangle (methyl lysine recognition), a filled quad (histone H3K9/K27 side chain or backbone recognition) or a filled circle (recognition of the lysine 2 of the H3 peptide) according to Nielsen et al. [26]. An arginine (position 43 of the alignment, marked
with an empty circle), which is specifically conserved in Polycomb proteins, is important for preference of H3K27me against
H3K9me [27]. Determined secondary structures of HP1 [26] and Clr4p [52] are given beneath the alignment. B. Numbers of
identical consensus residues between Su(var)3-9, HP1 and Polycomb chromo domains. C. Unrooted neighbour joining tree of
selected Su(var)3-9, HP1 and Polycomb chromo domains from vertebrates and insects. Only species which have orthologues
of all three proteins are included. Abbreviations: Aga, Anopheles gambiae; Ame, Apis mellifera; Dme, Drosophila melanogaster;

exact target molecule of the Su(var)3-9 chromo domain is
unknown. Su(var)3-9 proteins contain a classical chromo
domain [16], which is especially similar to HP1 and Polycomb chromo domains. Therefore, we have compared
chromo domains of 34 Su(var)3-9, 21 HP1 and 10 Polycomb proteins (Fig. 6). We found that in three out of four
conserved amino acid residues, which are essential for the
specifity of HP1 binding to histone H3K9me [26],
Su(var)3-9 proteins show the same conservation as HP1
proteins as well as a conserved difference to Polycomb
proteins (Fig. 6A, filled circles). In contrast, an arginine at
position 43 of the chromo domain alignment, which is
necessary for interaction with histone H3K27me [27], is
conserved only in Polycomb proteins (Fig. 6A, empty circle). Both results argue for a histone H3K9me preference

of Su(var)3-9 chromo domains. Concomitantly, both
alignment and tree branch lengths (Fig. 6A, C) infer a
stronger chromo domain sequence conservation in HP1
than in Su(var)3-9 proteins. This might reflect a lesser
affinity to histone H3 tails or a lesser discrimination
between differently modificated H3K9 moieties, as compared to HP1 proteins. The latter opportunity was supported by pull-down assays using human SUV39H1 [28].
Thus, Su(var)3-9 proteins generally may be able to interact with histone H3 tails by chromo domains to facilitate
and/or to locally restrict histone methylation. However,
an interaction of the Su(var)3-9 chromo domain with heterochromatin-specific RNA cannot be excluded.

Figure 7 of histone H3K9 methyltransferase consensus sequences that includes preSET, SET and postSET regions
Alignment
Alignment of histone H3K9 methyltransferase consensus sequences that includes preSET, SET and postSET
regions. Alignment positions are given according to D. melanogaster Su(var)3-9. Specific consensus sequences were computed
from 38 Su(var)3-9, 8 dim-5, 12 G9a/GLP, 15 SETDB/EuHMTase and 19 plant SUVH proteins. 90–100%-identical residues are
black boxed and 50–89%-identical ones are grey boxed for each class of orthologues. Above the proteins, amino acid substitutions found in mutant D. melanogaster Su(var)3-9 proteins [6, 34] are black shadowed. Persistently conserved consensus differences found in Su(var)3-9 proteins in comparison to other H3K9 methyltransferases are marked with an empty circle.

The identification and characterization of point mutations in Su(var)3-9 of Drosophila melanogaster which lead
to differential HMTase activities [6] demonstrated that the
functional potential of Su(var)3-9 proteins is mainly
determined by the kinetic properties of the HMTase reaction which is in turn dependent of SET- and SET-associated regions. We compared the structural conservation of
these regions between Su(var)3-9 and other HMTases
(dim-5, G9a/GLP, SETDB and SUVH proteins) which are
proved to be histone H3K9 methylases [7,29-31].
Su(var)3-9 proteins contain only four persistent conserved sequence differences to these paralogous proteins:
G450 (Fig. 7, position 450 according to D. melanogaster
Su(var)3-9) in preSET, G487 in SET-N, YddqGrT (positions 524 to 530) in SET-I, and H557 in SET-C. We suggest
that at least two of these conserved sequence deviations
have interesting functional consequences.
First, whereas 36 out of 39 Su(var)3-9 orthologues contain a H557 in SET-C, 47 out of 54 examined nonSu(var)3-9 H3K9 HMTases contain an arginine at this
position. The homologous R328 of Neurospora dim-5 is
essential to permit trimethylation of histone H3K9 with-

out intermediate release of H3K9-dim-5 binding, i.e. a
processive type of reaction [32]. In dim-5, an arginine to
histidine substitution at this position decreases the
HMTase activity below 0.6 percent [33]. On the other
hand, the activity of human SUV39H1 can be increased by
a reciprocal exchange of histidine to arginine to more than
2000 percent [34]. It appears, therefore, that Su(var)3-9
proteins, in contrast to other H3K9 methyltransferases,
are generally non-processive enzymes, as proved for D.
melanogaster Su(var)3-9 [20]. In addition, Ebert et al. [6]
identified the critical amino acid substitution (R529S) of
the Drosophila gain-of-function mutant Su(var)3-9ptn
within the above mentioned YDdqGrT motif. This gainof-function mutant possesses a significantly increased
HMTase activity that overcompensates amorphic mutations in Drosophila heterozygotes. In summary, two
Su(var)3-9-diagnostic conservations of amino acids in the
SET domain seem to suppress the HMTase activity of
Su(var)3-9 proteins in comparison to other H3K9 methyltransferases. Furthermore, we found a conserved phenylalanine (Fig. 7, position 600), which supports that all
Su(var)3-9 HMTases may be able to tri-methylate H3K9
[35].

Next, we analyzed 19 deleterious amino acid substitutions
described for D. melanogaster Su(var)3-9 [6,36] using the
H3K9 HMTase alignment (Fig. 7). We recognized that
these substitutions fall into three classes (Tab. 2). Class I
contains seven mutations exclusively found in totally conserved residues of preSET and SET-N regions of all H3K9
methylases. These substitutions typically show a null phenotype. The molecular functions of the corresponding residues can easily be drawn from structural analysis of
Neurospora dim-5 or Schizosaccharomyces Clr4p [33,37]
(Tab. 2). In contrast, class II contains three substitutions
at positions which are conserved only in Drosophila, six
other substitutions that were detected in some wild type
Su(var)3-9 proteins of other species, one (C505Y) that
was found similarly substituted (C505L) in the Su(var)39 protein of Araneus diadematus, and one (S562F) that was
identified similarly substituted (S562L) in some G9a proteins. Class II substitution positions, thus, show only a
partial conservation and became probably compensated
through nearby substitutions which have been determined (see Materials and Methods, Tab. 2). The molecular function of these residues was commonly not revealed
by comparison with structural analyses of homologous
proteins. Class II substitutions were found in all SET
domain-related regions and show hypomorphic or null
phenotypes. Su(var)3-9ptn constitutes a third, hypermorphic class of mutants. Notably, we found an identical
R529S substitution in several wild type Su(var)3-9 proteins of other species, but it seems that there does not exist
a local compensatory amino acid substitution (Tab. 2).
The R529S substitution may cause a higher HMTase activity of Su(var)3-9 proteins in those species, or become
compensated by remote intramolecular changes.
Finally, we were specifically interested in the Su(var)3-9
sequence of Drosophila nasutoides. The D. nasutoides
genome comprises 61,7% (female) or 67,4% (male) heterochromatin and represents by far the heterochromatinrichest genome of Drosophila [1]. However, we did not
find any peculiarities in the D. nasutoides protein compared with other Su(var)3-9 sequences.

Discussion
To our knowledge, fusions of two ancestrally independent
genes with completely different functions similar to
Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ have never been described so far. Other
known gene fusions are supposed to be positively selected
because the resulting gene products are fused players of
the same cellular pathway, fused molecular interactors or
perform at least one novel function using an acquired protein domain. How, then, was it possible that two proteins
as different as Su(var)3-9 and eIF2γ in respect to sequence,
structure, function, cellular localization and interactions
were evolved to be derived from a single gene structure?
Northern blots in Drosophila [9] revealed that the eIF2γ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/18

mRNA is expressed strongly in each developmental stage,
whereas the Su(var)3-9 mRNA is expressed weakly during
the first nine hours of embryonal development and
almost undetectable during later stages. Therefore, we
hypothesize that the Su(var)3-9-specific splice variant of
the Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ gene "parasitize" on the strong
expression of the eIF2γ splice variant. The developmental
changes of the Su(var)3-9 share in the Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ
primary transcript are unable to influence the eIF2γ
expression significantly because of the generally weak
expression rate of Su(var)3-9. Under these conditions, it
was possible that a Su(var)3-9 retrotransposition into the
81-1 exon of an ancient eIF2γ gene has taken place and
that this event has immediately resulted in a functional,
alternative spliced gene. The only additional prerequisite
is an activation of a cryptic splice site at the 5'end of the
Su(var)3-9-specific exon, which has to be sufficient weak
to not disturb significantly the eIF2γ expression.
To determine age and distribution of the Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ
gene fusion, we have cloned orthologues of both genes or
of the gene fusion, respectively, in 19 selected genera of
arthropods ([10,19], this study). We found that the fusion
is restricted to Ectognatha (Insecta) and, possibly, to
Dicondylia (Pterygota + Zygentoma) (Fig. 4). According
to palaeontological evidence with respect to the first true
insect [38], the age of this unusual genomic assemblage
can be estimated to about 400 million years. Irrespective
of its long history, the gene fusion seems to impose a functional burden on the encoded gene products. In beetles
and butterflies obvious splice artefacts, containing all
exons of the fusion, are detectable [10]. The coding potential of these artefacts comprises all eIF2γ exons under
inclusion of the Su(var)3-9-specific exon, which renders
the encoded protein functionally inactive, at least with
regard to eIF2γ. Notably, the Su(var)3-9-specific part of
the gene fusion consists in all analyzed 21 species of only
one large exon (>1450 bp). Initially, this may have been
caused by retrotransposition of Su(var)3-9 sequences into
the eIF2γ gene. Afterwards, the establishment of internal
Su(var)3-9 introns might have been suppressed by selection against abundant functionless or antimorphic splice
artefacts, which would concomitantly decrease the expression of functional eIF2γ mRNAs. At the same time, the
eIF2γ part of the gene fusion has acquired at least four
novel introns [19], and the newly emerged Acyrthosiphon
Su(var)3-9 gene has gained two novel introns.
During this study, we found evidence for a reversion of the
Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ gene fusion in aphids. The remnants of a
Su(var)3-9-coding region in the eIF2γ intron 81-1 of
Acyrthosiphon pisum reveal that these aphids descend from
ancestors which harbored the gene fusion. Because the
cicada Cercopis vulnerata possesses the fused gene, the fission of both gene parts has to be occurred during the evo-

lution of the hemipterid group Sternorrhyncha (psyllids,
whiteflies, aphids and coccids). It remains open whether
a genomic duplication has happened, or a renewed retrotransposition of the Su(var)3-9 mRNA.
The central role of the Su(var)3-9 histone H3K9 methyltransferase for the establishment of pericentromeric heterochromatin has been shown for mammals, Drosophila
and Schizosaccharomyces [4-6,28]. Our observation of
Su(var)3-9 orthologues in holocentric species of insects
(butterflies, hemipterans, earwigs) argues for an impor-

tant role of the protein also outside of the pericentromeric
heterochromatin, possibly in euchromatic gene silencing
[24,39], at telomeres [40] and/or in chromosome segregation [41]. Whether Su(var)3-9 proteins are involved in the
establishment of heterochromatic regions in aphid chromosomes, which are mostly limited to telomeres and X
chromosomes ([42], and references therein), remains to
be seen. Additionally, it would be interesting to evaluate
function and nuclear distribution of a Su(var)3-9
ortholog in the coccid model system Planococcus citri,

where H3K9 methylation is found exclusively in the paternally imprinted chromosome set [2].

Conclusion

Our examination of the evolution of the Su(var)3-9/eIF2γ
gene fusion revealed strong evidence for the establishment of this fusion in a common ancestor of dicondylic
insects. Because of the unrelatedness of Su(var)3-9 and
eIF2γ and the demonstrated broad phylogenetic distribution of the fusion, this gene structure is a reliable synapomorphy, but appears not to invoke novel functions of the
gene products. Therefore, we interpret this gene fusion as
an event of constructive neutral evolution as proposed by
Stoltzfus [43]. The identified re-fission of this fusion during the evolution of aphids shows the vulnerability of this
structure to evolutionary decay, probably due to duplication and partial degeneration.
Our comparison of chromo domains and SET domains
from Su(var)3-9 and related proteins offers functional
predictions concerning both domains in Su(var)3-9 proteins. Su(var)3-9 chromo domains are similar to HP1
chromo domains, which points to a potential binding
activity to methylated K9 of histone H3. SET domain comparisons suggest less enzymatic activity of Su(var)3-9 proteins in comparison to other H3K9 HMTases. Su(var)3-9
proteins combine two motifs in one molecule, which are
typical for structural (chromo domain) or enzymatic components (SET domain) of chromatin. This raises an interesting question: Are evolutionary attenuations of the
chromo domain histone H3 binding affinity and of the
SET domain histone H3 methyltransferase activity necessary conditions to make Su(var)3-9 compatible to animal
chromatin? Domain swapping experiments may give an
answer.

Methods
Sources of arthropods utilized
Species trapped in the vicinity of Leipzig (Sachsen, Germany) were Araneus diadematus (spider), Lepisma saccharina (silverfish), Enallagma cyathigerum (damselfly),
Forficula auricularia (earwig), Acyrthosiphon pisum (aphid)
and Apis mellifera (honey bee). Cercopis vulnerata (cicada)
was captured around Ruhla (Thüringen, Germany).
Allacma fusca (springtail) was trapped near Ilsenburg
(Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany). Bombyx mori (silk worm) was
used from commercial stock. DNA from Drosophila nasutoides was delivered by Dr. H. Zacharias (Kiel, Germany)
as a courtesy.
Isolation of Su(var)3-9 genes using PCR
DNA was isolated by standard protocols. Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA. cDNA was synthesized using Hminus-M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas) and a polyT primer. Degenerate primers based on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/18

the amino acid sequences of already known Su(var)3-9
proteins were designed to partially amplify the Su(var)3-9
gene from genomic DNA and/or cDNA of arthropod species. Used degenerated oligonucleotide primers were 39deg5 (5'-GCCHGGXRBXSCVATMTWYGARTGCAA-3')
and 3-9deg6 (5'-GGATCRCAMGARTGRTTRATRAARTG3'). Primer positions within Su(var)3-9 are shown in figure 2. PCR amplifications were done in a Gradient Cycler
(Eppendorf) at annealing temperatures between 37°C
and 62°C. The initial PCR product was purified using
Spin PCRapid Kit (Macherey&Nagel) and sequenced. Species-specific primers were designed based on the received
sequence to obtain 5'ends and 3'ends of Su(var)3-9 transcripts by 5'RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA ends)
and 3'RACE, respectively (GeneRacerKit, Invitrogen).
Alternatively, we used Su(var)3-9 ESTs found in databases
and already known sequences from the supposedly fused
eIF2γ gene [19] for RACE experiments. Additionally,
inverse PCR products from digested and ligated genomic
DNA preparations were purified, cloned and sequenced.
The specific sequencing strategy used for each of the analyzed species is given [see Additional file 1]. Species-specific primer sequences are listed [see Additional file 3].
Sequences were determined either by direct sequencing of
the PCR fragment or by sequencing of two or three independent clones from different PCR reactions. PCR fragments were subcloned using pGEM-T PCR cloning kit
(Promega). Sequencing was performed on ABI3100
equipment (ABI) using BigDye Sequencing Chemistry
(ABI). For sequence analyses, MacVector 7.2 (Accelrys)
was used.
Sequence sampling and annotation
Su(var)3-9-orthologous DNA sequences from genome
sequencing projects of metazoans were sampled from
databases using BLAST. In particular, we used tBLASTn
[44], based on seven already known Su(var)3-9 sequences
[10], to retrieve Su(var)3-9-like genomic sequences from
finished and unfinished genome projects deposited at the
NCBI database. Additionally, single trace sequences were
screened using discontiguous MEGABLAST and were
assembled manually. Intron positions at the corresponding nucleotide sequences were deduced by co-occurrence
of splice consensus sites and gaps in similarity. This exonintron structure was confirmed by cDNA or EST sequences
if available. The orthology of these candidate sequences
was verified by reciprocal BLASTp analysis. We used only
complete sequences which are orthologous to Drosophila
melanogaster Su(var)3-9. A list of sequences and its
sources is provided in table 1.
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
The sampled Su(var)3-9 proteins were aligned using the
ClustalW option of MacVector 7.2 (Accelrys). The pro-

Analysis of amino acid substitutions in mutants

used to infer homologous residues to amino acid substitutions found in D. melanogaster Su(var)3-9 mutants.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:18

According to Kondrashov et al. [50], we identified compensated pathogenic deviations (CPD) in other HMTases.
CPDs are amino acid substitutions that, at this site, would
show a mutant phenotype in D. melanogaster. To identify
CPDs, both D. melanogaster wild type and mutant
Su(var)3-9 proteins were modelled according to known
H3K9 HMTase crystal structures using the Swiss Model
server [51]. We determined all amino acid residues that
directly interact with a CPD residue, requiring that the distance between their closest atoms does not exceed 4 Å in
wild type or mutant. We used multiple alignment to check
whether an amino acid that is deleterious in flies can cooccur with D. melanogaster amino acids at this interacting
sites. If the co-occurrence was never observed, and if all
wild type proteins that carry the CPD also carry such a particular amino acid at the second site, we hypothesized that
this second-site substitution is compensatory.
