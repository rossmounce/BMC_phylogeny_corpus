Models of RNA virus evolution and their roles in
vaccine design
Samuel Ojosnegros1,2, Niko Beerenwinkel1*

Abstract
Viruses are fast evolving pathogens that continuously adapt to the highly variable environments they live and
reproduce in. Strategies devoted to inhibit virus replication and to control their spread among hosts need to cope
with these extremely heterogeneous populations and with their potential to avoid medical interventions. Computational techniques such as phylogenetic methods have broadened our picture of viral evolution both in time and
space, and mathematical modeling has contributed substantially to our progress in unraveling the dynamics of
virus replication, fitness, and virulence. Integration of multiple computational and mathematical approaches with
experimental data can help to predict the behavior of viral pathogens and to anticipate their escape dynamics.
This piece of information plays a critical role in some aspects of vaccine development, such as viral strain selection
for vaccinations or rational attenuation of viruses. Here we review several aspects of viral evolution that can be
addressed quantitatively, and we discuss computational methods that have the potential to improve vaccine
design.
Review
Viruses are intracellular parasites that need the cellular
machinery of the host to reproduce [1]. They have the
potential to generate huge population sizes in short generation times. Viruses in general, and RNA viruses in particular, exist in genetically heterogeneous populations
because of their error-prone replication [2]. These features make the evolution of viruses a phenomenon observable on short time scales of weeks to months. The
consequences of the extreme viral evolutionary dynamics
are of tremendous importance for disease control and
prevention. For example, influenza vaccines need to be
updated every year, viral variants develop resistance to
antiviral drugs, and mild viral strains turn into virulent
ones spontaneously. These global health care issues and
others arise from the rapid evolution of viruses.
Molecular profiling techniques, including DNA
sequencing, have produced an enormous amount of
data on viral spread, genetic diversity, and infection
dynamics. The integration and analysis of these data can
provide valuable information on the evolution of viral
pathogens. Mathematical, statistical, and computational

methods are necessary to deal with those large data sets
and to predict phenotypes form genetic data that ultimately can be used in vaccine development. In this
review, we summarize some computational and mathematical techniques that play a critical role in understanding viral evolution and vaccine design. Specifically,
we discuss phylogenetic methods for vaccine strain
selection, statistical models of evolutionary escape from
selective immune pressure, and virus dynamics models
for therapeutic vaccines and attenuation strategies. Our
major examples are Influenza, human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV).
They are all RNA viruses of great medical or veterinary
importance and have been studied extensively.
We also discuss current, approved experimental methodologies employed to the development of antiviral vaccines. Vaccine development deals with the four most
important traits of viral evolution: virulence, fitness,
diversity, and dynamics. Each one of these concepts has
been subjected to intense studies but is still difficult to
predict, probably because of the complexity of each trait
and the intrinsic stochasticity of the evolutionary process. Progress in understanding the interplay of these
factors will depend on quantitative descriptions and predictive models. Thus, mathematical evolutionary modeling is likely to play an increasingly important role in the

development of new vaccines and the control of viral
disease.
Viral evolution

A quantitative description of viral evolution is necessary
for monitoring the spread of viral pandemics and for
developing effective therapies and vaccines [3]. Viruses
are not only a threat to human health, but they also
provide attractive model systems for evolutionary studies
due to their short genomes, large population sizes, and
high genetic diversity [4]. The extreme replication
dynamics of RNA viruses, for example, allow for observing significant evolutionary changes over time. Hypotheses and theories about evolutionary mechanisms can
often be tested directly with these measurably evolving
viruses [5].
The mutation rate of RNA viruses is about a million
times larger than the human mutation rate [6]. Thus,
RNA viruses display a huge genetic diversity and this
feature is critical for survival of the virus [7,8]. Virus
populations are exposed to fluctuating environments
when migrating through different organs and tissues of
the host organism and when exposed to immune
responses mounted by the host. Transmission to a new
host is typically associated with both traversing various
tissues and facing new immune responses, and therefore
it represents a major bottleneck for the virus population.
The genetic diversity of RNA viruses makes it likely that
adapted variants preexist in the population even before
the selective pressure has changed [9,10].
Because the diversity of the virus population can determine its evolutionary fate, selection seems to operate on
the population level rather than at the level of individual
viruses [11]. This idea was originally developed for selfreplicating RNA molecules and termed quasispecies theory [12], and then applied to RNA viruses [13,14]. One
prediction of quasispecies theory is the existence of an
upper bound on the mutation rate beyond which the
population cannot maintain its essential genetic information. Many RNA viruses appear to have mutation rates
close to this error threshold [9,15,16].
The evolutionary dynamics of viral infectious diseases
can be analyzed at considerable detail today owing to
advancements in high-throughput DNA sequencing
technologies and statistical and computational modeling
of these data [17]. Viral evolution occurs on different
temporal and spatial scales and is shaped by different
ecological processes within and between hosts. Integrated modeling efforts across these scales that make
use of phylogenetic, population genetics, virus dynamics,
and epidemiological methods are termed phylodynamics
approaches [18]. Application of these techniques
enabled the reconstruction of the molecular origin of
the HIV pandemic [19,20] and the explanation of

influenza A epidemics by the interplay of natural selection and migration [21,22]. Comparing viral DNA
sequences is at the heart of the phylodynamics
approach.
In general, the study of correlated evolution among
genotypic and phenotypic traits or between traits and
the environment across species is known as the comparative method [23]. It has been extremely successful
in analyzing DNA sequence data and it is the basis for
predicting phenotypes, such as protein structure or
function, from genotypes. In the case of RNA viruses,
which display a large genetic diversity between hosts,
the different viral quasispecies take the role of the different species in the traditional application of the comparative method. Viral phenotypes of interest include
immunological escape and drug resistance.
Vaccine development strategies

Vaccine development can be considered one of the biggest achievements of modern medicine. While some
bacterial families share common biochemical features,
such as surface lipopolysacharide and therefore can be
treated with common drugs or antibiotics [24], viruses
are typically different enough between families or even
inside families, making the development of broadly
applicable antiviral drugs challenging [2,25]. For example, the base analogue ribavirin alone or in combination
with interferon, has been proven to act as an antiviral
compound of broad activity in the clinical treatment of
infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus
(HBV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [26-31].
Overall, only few antiviral drugs targeting viral proteins
are currently approved for use in humans [32]. Viruses
that can be fought with chemical compounds include
HIV, influenza virus, RSV, HCV, HBV, and the herpes
viruses, including herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster
virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus.
However, currently the vast majority of viruses cannot
be controlled today with any approved compound and
frequently not even all subgroups inside the same viral
species are drug sensitive. For example, the 2009 seasonal influenza A virus (H1N1) presents a natural resistance to oseltamivir [33]. The efficiency of antiviral
compounds is usually hampered by the generation of
drug resistant viruses. Moreover, some compounds may
help control infection, but only rarely can the virus be
completely cleared from the host organism. By contrast,
vaccines can boost the immune system response and, in
principle, achieve complete clearance of a virus from an
infected host. Therefore, vaccines are considered the
best weapon to fight viruses.
The general idea of vaccination is to resemble a viral
infection but avoiding the associated pathology. There
are several strategies to address this goal with varying

efficacies. Currently approved viral vaccines for use in
humans are listed in Table 1. They have resulted from
one out of three main types of vaccine design strategies
referred to as (i) live attenuated vaccines, (ii) inactivated
vaccines, and (iii) recombinant vaccines and peptidederived vaccines.
Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs). Immunization with
LAV has been proved to be the most efficient vaccination strategy to date [34,35]. LAV preparations include
viruses with reduced virulence, which means that they
do not produce the disease when infecting the host, or
they produce a mild version of the disease. Viruses
become attenuated for the original host after serial
infections (passages) in cell culture of different organism. This is the case of the polio vaccine preparation in
monkey cells [36]. Infection of embryonated hen eggs is
the standard protocol to obtain attenuated yellow fever
or measles viruses suitable for vaccine preparation [37].
The rationale for this attenuation strategy is that due to
the high error rates during replication of viruses, especially of RNA viruses [2], the virus accumulates mutations in the genome that optimize their replication in
the new host or new cell type, at the expense of replication efficiency in the original host [1,34,38].
The attenuated virus is still competent for replication and it retains the ability to infect host cells. For
this reason, LAVs can elicit different effector mechanisms of the immune system. The intracellular replication of the virus can stimulate cytotoxic CD8 + cells
because they can be presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Particles
released outside the cell can also be presented by class
II MHC molecules [39]. After immunization with the

LAV, the immune system is exposed to multiple antigens of the virus in its native conformation. Once the
infection with the LAV is cleared from the organism,
the virus-specific immune cells remain as memory
cells in the host. A future challenge with the wild type
virus will trigger the correct response, i.e., predominantly cellular response or predominantly humoral
response. LAVs are considered the most successful
vaccines because the efficient and multiple stimulation
of the immune system typically induces a potent and
durable response [38].
Inactivated vaccines (IVs). Viral stocks are susceptible
to inactivation by some chemical and physical treatments. IVs consist of a concentrated viral stock that has
been treated with a chemical reagent, such as binary
ethylenimine or formaldehyde, which completely abolish
virus replication [40]. Some viruses are difficult to
attenuate because they may change their antigenic properties or they remain virulent after few passages in cell
culture [41]. The latter is the case for FMDV, an animal
virus from the picornavirus family. When a virus cannot
be attenuated with sufficient reliability, inactivation has
been proven to be a successful vaccination strategy, as
documented for FMDV, influenza, or hepatitis A vaccines [41-44]. Some security issues may arise however, if
the chemical compound does not reach all virus particles, for example because some viral particles tend to
form compact aggregates, and the preparation still contains a portion of live viruses. Inactivated viruses are
usually not efficiently presented by MHC class I molecules, which stimulate the cellular immune response. IV
preparations include adjuvants which are chemical compounds that act on antigen-presenting cells enhancing

Ojosnegros and Beerenwinkel Immunome Research 2010, 6(Suppl 2):S5
http://www.immunome-research.com/content/6/S2/S5

the immunogenicity of the vaccine [45,46]. However, the
strength and duration of the protection induced by IVs
is usually lower than that obtained with LAVs.
Recombinant and peptide-based vaccines. A great
variety of vaccine strategies can be catalogued inside
this category, most of them experimental. Recombinant
vaccines are produced by the expression of a genetic
construct that codifies viral peptides [47,48], subunits of
the virus [49], or whole viruses with genetic modifications including deletions of key proteins [50,51]. Other
strategies include live viral vectors that carry multiple
copies of heterologous proteins of interest [52,53]. Many
of these strategies have failed, mainly because of the low
immunogenic capacity of peptides or subunits, compared with the whole live or inactivated particle. The
HBV vaccine is a yeast-derived recombinant vaccine. It
contains the hepatitis B surface antigen which is one of
the viral envelope proteins. HBV vaccine is the only
recombinant vaccine currently approved and in use for
humans [49].
DNA vaccination is a strategy based on injecting a
DNA construct directly into the host [54,55]. Such DNA
constructs, which code for the immunizing protein or
other parts of interest of the virus, can be transcribed
and translated into the cell. Therefore, expressed gene
products can elicit an immune response by presentation
of peptides by MHC class I and II molecules.
Phylogenetic methods in influenza vaccine design

Influenza A virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus that
infects about one fifth of the worldwide human population each year [56]. The viral genome consists of eight
segments and is categorized by the serology and genetics
of its two surface glycoproteins neuraminidase (NA) and
hemagglutinin (HA). Several subtypes of both genes
have been isolated from mammalian and avian hosts,
including the two most recent pandemic strains H3N2
and H1N1 currently circulating in the human population and responsible for the 1968â1969 Hong Kong Flu
and the 2009 Swine Flu, respectively.
Influenza infects large portions of its host population
every season and immunized hosts are resistant to infection with the subtype they have been exposed to for several years. Therefore, selective pressure exists for the
virus to diversify and to generate immunological escape
variants. Indeed, the HA gene has been shown to be
under strong selective pressure through immune surveillance [57]. Positive (diversifying) Darwinian selection
acts at the antigen-determining sites of HA1, the most
immunogenic part of HA. At these loci, significantly
more non-synonymous than synonymous nucleotide
substitutions are observed, and the rate of evolution is
accelerated considerably as compared to other sites of
the genome [58,59].

Not only selection, but also neutral genetic drift seems
to play an important role in the evolution of influenza
virus. Both evolutionary forces, termed antigenic drift and
antigenic shift, have been observed in human hosts over
the last century. Antigenic drift refers to neutral evolutionary changes accumulating over time, whereas antigenic
shift involves a change in genetic and serological properties of the virus due to new HA or NA subtypes.
The evolutionary dynamics of H3N2 epidemics have
been studied in detail by allowing for different genetic
and antigenic properties of the HA gene [60]. Variations
of this influenza subtype emerge and replace each other
every 2 to 8 years. The mapping of HA genotypes to
antigenic phenotypes is based on a neutral network
model, i.e., mutants are organized in connected, phenotypically identical clusters. The model explains the
observed pattern of viral evolution, with periods of antigenic stasis and with episodic cluster transitions. During
antigenic stasis the population drifts through the neutral
network and its diversity increases. If it hits the boundary of the neutral network, the antigenic phenotype
changes and the population continues to evolve in the
new network. The cluster transition presents a population bottleneck and gives rise to a selective sweep which
reduces the genetic diversity of the population [61].
The influenza vaccine needs to be redesigned regularly
to account for genetic changes in the virus population.
Normally, the changes are made in response to the antigenic drift of the virus. For example, between 1968 and
2001 the H3N2 component of the influenza vaccine was
changed a total of 17 times [62]. The selection of viral
strains to be included in the vaccine for the coming season is based on the antigenic properties of recent isolates, on epidemiological data, and on post-vaccination
serological studies in humans.
The evolutionary dynamics of influenza drive its
immune escape and give rise to a new dominant strain
every season. Therefore, vaccine design is not only supported by immunoinformatics methods for epitope prediction [63-65], but also by statistical genetics and
phylogenetic methods for analyzing genetic diversity and
predicting evolutionary changes. To predict the evolution of the influenza HA gene, phylogenetic trees were
constructed based on DNA sequences derived from
viruses during the years 1983 through 1997 [22]. Eighteen codons were identified to be under positive selective pressure and the genetic diversity at these loci was
significantly higher than at the other loci of the HA
gene [59]. The rationale for predicting the next dominant virus is that extant strains with additional mutations at the 18 loci will be better adapted to evade the
host immune response and thus have a selective advantage in the coming season. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the viral lineages with the greatest number

Ojosnegros and Beerenwinkel Immunome Research 2010, 6(Suppl 2):S5
http://www.immunome-research.com/content/6/S2/S5

of mutations in the positively selected codons were the
ancestors of future H3 lineages in 9 out of 11 influenza
seasons [22].
This approach to predicting the evolution of influenza
relies on solving two classical evolutionary biology problems: the detection of genetic loci under selective pressure and the reconstruction of the evolutionary history
of a set of individuals. Quantifying the relative contributions of selection versus random genetic drift is a longstanding task rooted in Kimuraâs theory of neutral
evolution which predicts that most mutations are selectively neutral [66,67]. Selection is typically identified by
testing for departure from neutrality, although such
deviations can also have different causes. The statistical
tests are either based on the allelic distribution or on
comparing variability in different classes of mutations
[68]. Tajimaâs D is the prototype test of the first kind
[69]. It detects differences in two distinct estimates of
genetic diversity. The null distribution of the test statistic D is obtained from sampling genealogies according
to the coalescent, a stochastic process describing the
sampling variation [70,71]. Similarly, the EwensâWatterson test compares the observed to the expected homozygosity based on the Ewens sampling formula for the
infinite-alleles model [72,73]. In the second category of
tests fall the McDonaldâKreitman test [74] and likelihood ratio tests based on the allelic distribution in nonsynonymous versus synonymous sites [58,75]. Codon
usage in influenza sequences has also been analyzed
based on codon volatility, which measures the degree to
which a random nucleotide mutation is expected to
change the corresponding amino acid [76].
Phylogenetic methods play an important role in the
analysis of viral sequence data. They are used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between different
viral strains. Three main approaches exist to phylogenetic tree reconstruction: distance-based methods, parsimony, and probabilistic methods based on maximum
likelihood or Bayesian statistics [77-80]. Distance-based
methods start by defining an evolutionary distance
between sequences and then apply hierarchical clustering algorithms to obtain a phylogenetic tree.
Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean
(UPGMA) [81], an average linkage clustering method,
and Neighbor Joining [82] are two prominent examples
of this approach. Distance-based methods are computationally efficient, but the reduction of the observed data
to a distance matrix presents a loss of information. Both
UPGMA and Neighbor Joining can reconstruct the correct tree only under strong assumptions about the
metric defined by the distance matrix and they are sensitive to violations of these assumptions.
Unlike distance-based methods, character-based methods follow character substitutions in the sequence

explicitly. Maximum Parsimony is based on the minimum evolution principle and tries to find the tree that
explains the data by the minimum number of mutations
[83]. The method has been applied successfully to the
analysis of influenza virus sequence data [84]. It is also
computationally efficient, but lacks an explicit evolutionary model (other than minimum evolution), and it is not
statistically consistent. On the other hand, probabilistic
phylogenetic models have these desirable properties, but
they come at a computational cost usually rendering
exact maximum likelihood estimation impossible. However, approximate likelihood methods, such as DNAML
[59] or QuartetPuzzling [85], and methods making use
of Bayesian inference, such as MrBayes [86] are applied
in practice. For both distance-based methods and probabilistic phylogenetic methods, the choice of an appropriate model of nucleotide substitution is critical.
The application of statistical genetics and phylogenetics methods to influenza sequence data has not only
improved our understanding of the evolutionary
dynamics and the epidemiology of the virus, but it has
also become an integral part of the yearly vaccine design
cycle. However, the successful case of influenza does not
seem to provide a practical model for HIV. One reason
for this discrepancy might be the evolutionary dynamics
of HIV which are strikingly different from those of
influenza. Rather than the drift-and-shift pattern of
influenza evolution which generates only a small
amount of genetic diversity around the successful trunk
lineage, HIV tends to spread out from an ancestor in a
radial fashion and to generate much more variation. The
worldwide diversity of influenza sequences in any given
year appears to be comparable to the diversity of HIV
sequences found within a single infected individual at
one time point [62]. Thus, an HIV vaccine must stimulate a very broad reactive immune response against a
large set of diverse viral strains and the genetic makeup
of these sequences is much more difficult to predict
from the currently circulating strains as compared to
influenza. It is for these and possibly other reasons that
the same bioinformatics-assisted vaccine design
approach that is established for influenza, has not been
equally successful for HIV to date. In the following sections, we will discuss extensions of the models discussed
above as well as complementary mathematical and computational approaches that might be of help in search
for an HIV vaccine in the future.
Evolutionary escape of HIV from selective immune
pressure

HIV populations display a high genetic diversity due to
the quasispecies nature of RNA virus replication
[2,87,88]. HIV occurs in three main groups, the principal of which, group M, is composed of nine subtypes.

Ojosnegros and Beerenwinkel Immunome Research 2010, 6(Suppl 2):S5
http://www.immunome-research.com/content/6/S2/S5

Moreover, HIV has a great capacity for recombination
among subtypes, and as a consequence, new circulating
recombinant forms are constantly arising [89,90]. Each
subtype itself represents a great genetic diversity as well
and even during infection of a single patient, HIV exists
as an ensemble of different sequences [88]. The high
genetic diversity of HIV populations hampers the development of a vaccine of broad applicability. Vaccine candidates need to elicit responses against multiple epitopes
in order to counteract the immune evasion by virus
mutation [91,92].
With one exception, the few attempts to bring HIV
vaccines to the last phases of clinical trials have been
quite disappointing so far. One of the first and most
prominent vaccine candidates, the VAXGEN vaccine,
was intended to immunize subjects with a recombinant
envelope protein of HIV (rgp120) [93,94]. The envelope
protein is located on the surface of HIV and is responsible for the attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptor [95]. Antibodies targeted against this
protein could block HIV infection and subsequently
block virus entry into cells. During VAXGEN trials, the
immunization induced the production of antibodies in
vaccinated individuals, but they were unable to control
infection or viremia.
The STEP vaccine trials were designed to test the efficiency of a T cell vaccine in reducing viremia and enhancing the cellular immune response [96]. This vaccine
candidate is a therapeutic vaccine (see below), because it
was intended to enhance the immune response against
HIV even if sterilizing immunity would not be achieved.
The STEP vaccine formulation was based in an adenovirus serotype 5 vector (Ad5). The vaccine included three
independent Ad5 vectors, each one carrying one of the
three HIV proteins Gag, Pol, and Nef. Although in early
phases of the clinical trials, the vaccine was proven to elicit specific anti-HIV T cell responses, no significant protection was conferred to people receiving the vaccine in
phase IIb trials. Indeed, individuals having immune memory against the Ad5 vector were more susceptible to
infection by HIV [97]. This unexpected result was probably due to an adding-fuel-to-the-fire effect, in which the
Ad5 vector activated T cells creating a suitable environment for HIV replication [98].
Recently, a combined vaccine of recombinant canarypox vector vaccine [99] plus a recombinant glycoprotein
120 subunit vaccine has been tested in phase III clinical
trials in Thailand involving more than 16.000 subjects.
The results showed a slight trend of protection in the
vaccinated group when compared to the control group.
Although these numbers are still debated [100] and vaccination did not affect the degree of viremia or CD4+
T cell count in HIV infected subjects, the results offer
insight for future research.

In order to address the challenge of HIV sequence
diversity, several new vaccine design strategies are
explored based on combining different epitopes. These
methods include the construction of pseudo-protein
strings of T cell epitopes [101] and the synthetic
scrambled antigen vaccine, which combines consensus
overlapping peptide sets from HIV-1 proteins [102].
Both approaches select codons, peptides, or sequences
according to codon usage, covered diversity, and predicted HLA affinity, and randomize sequence fragments.
Vaccine design strategies based on whole viral protein
sequences make extensive use of phylogenetics. In addition to the basic methods discussed above, HIV-specific
probabilistic models of protein evolution have been constructed which allow for improved phylogenetic inference using likelihood or Bayesian methods [103]. The
reconstructed phylogenetic tree can guide the selection
of viral genomes to be included in the vaccine. Different
selection strategies have been proposed to stimulate a
broad immune response and to minimize the amount of
sequence divergence between the antigen and contemporaneously circulating viruses. Natural strains that
represent the total observed sequence space or derived
consensus sequences have been selected as vaccine
strains [104-106]. Probabilistic phylogenetic models also
allow for inferring the DNA sequences at internal nodes
of the tree which represent extinct common ancestors.
The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a given
set of viruses is the root of the phylogenetic tree for
these sequences [107]. It has been proposed as a vaccine
strain stimulating cross-reactive immune responses
against all of its descendants [104,108]. However, in
asymmetric phylogenies, both the consensus sequence
and the MRCA can perform poorly at minimizing the
distance to contemporary strains [109]. To address this
limitation, the center of tree node has been proposed. It
is calculated as the node minimizing the least squares
distance to all leaves of the phylogenetic tree [110].
The usefulness of phylogenetic trees is limited in the
presence of reticulate evolutionary events, such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, or recombination,
which cannot be represented by a tree. For this situation, phylogenetic network models have been developed
[111]. They generalize phylogenetic tree models and
include reticulate networks and split networks [112]. In
most RNA viruses, homologous recombination can
occur when a cell is coinfected with two different
strains. In HIV, multiple infections are common [113]
and the recombination rate is on the order of 2 to 3
times per genome per replication cycle [114]. Several
epidemiological circulating recombinant forms provide
evidence for recombination in HIV. Intra-host evolutionary dynamics are also shaped by recombination
affecting the generation of multidrug-resistant strains in

Ojosnegros and Beerenwinkel Immunome Research 2010, 6(Suppl 2):S5
http://www.immunome-research.com/content/6/S2/S5

treated patients [115,116] and the development of
immune escape variants. Efficient parsimony algorithms
have been developed for computing recombination networks [117,118].
Immune responses to HIV infection vary depending
on the genetic constellation of the human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) locus. Antigen-specific T cell immunity
is HLA-restricted and therefore mutations in HIV epitopes that allow escape from host immune responses
are HLA allele-specific [119,120]. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations have been shown to be
stable under vertical transmission of the virus [121].
Thus, CTL escape presents an important driving force
in shaping HIV evolutionary patterns. Differential HLArestricted viral evolution has been observed in several
HIV-1 genes [122]. From a vaccine design point of view,
it is pivotal to characterize CTL escape quantitatively in
order to address limitations of immune stimulations and
to minimize the risk of viral evolutionary escape. This
task involves identification of HLA-specific escape mutations and prediction of mutational escape pathways.
HIV polymorphisms associated with CTL escape leave
HLA-specific footprints at the population level and
hence detection of escape mutations is based on the
comparative method. However, there are at least three
confounding factors in this approach. First, viral
sequences obtained from different hosts cannot be
regarded as independent observations of the same stochastic process. Rather, these sequences share a common evolutionary history. Second, structural and
functional limitations, such as the biophysics of threedimensional protein structures, impose constraints on
codon covariation and give rise to linkage disequilibrium
(LD) in the HIV genome. Third, the hostâs HLA genes
are also in LD because of their close physical distance
on human chromosome 6.
Phylogenetic dependency networks (PDNs) are a class
of probabilistic graphical models that account for these
confounding factors [123]. PDNs explicitly represent
selection pressure from multiple sources and model the
dependency structure among escape mutations conditioned on a phylogenetic tree of the observed viruses
and on the HLA types of their hosts. By analyzing 1000
individuals from a multicenter cohort, the statistical
model identified a dense network of interactions
between HLA alleles and HIV codons, as well as among
HIV codons, reflecting the complexity but also the consistency of HIV adaptation to immune response [123].
HIV mutational pathways have also been modeled in
the context of evolutionary escape from the selective
pressure of antiretroviral therapy. Several probabilistic
models have been developed for describing the accumulation of amino acid changes in response to specific
drugs or drug combinations, including Markov chains

[126-128], and conjunctive Bayesian networks (CBNs)
[129]. CBNs are a class of probabilistic graphical models
that describe the order in which mutations occur. In
this model, the partial order of mutations that maximizes the likelihood of the data can be learned efficiently from observed mutational patterns. CBNs allow
for several escape paths with different probabilities and
the partial order restricts the viral genotype space to the
subset of those mutational patterns compatible with the
partial order constraints (Figure 1). The rationale for
this approach is that many combinations of mutations
are never observed, for example, because they result in
inviable viruses, or because they are too far away in
sequence space from current strains to be reached on
the relevant time scale. CBNs can explicitly represent
the timeline of mutations occurring along escape pathways [130] and they have been extended to account for
noisy observations [131].
Computational models of viral escape dynamics have
been applied successfully in the design of optimal combination therapies [132,133]. Because the development
of drug resistance is a major factor for treatment failure,
not only the current resistance profile, but also the likelihood of evolving resistant viruses is a strong predictor
of therapeutic outcome. The difficulty for the virus to
escape from the applied selective drug pressure is
known as the genetic barrier and it can be computed
based on probabilistic models of accumulating mutations [127]. Retrospective analyses of large observational
clinical databases have demonstrated that estimates of
the genetic barrier based on viral progression models

691 samples for ritonavir and indinavir, respectively.

are independent predictors of treatment outcome. The
genetic barrier improves therapy outcome predictions
and the resulting models outperform standard-of-care
expert rule-based treatment recommendations [134,135].
Therefore, computational models of viral escape
dynamics might also be useful for vaccine design. A successful HIV vaccine should not only minimize the distance to currently circulating strains, but also anticipate
possible immune escape pathways of the virus. Although
it is unlikely that the complete picture of escape pathways can be learned from data, improvements in terms
of hindered and delayed escape might be possible, especially in the context of therapeutic vaccines where selective immune and drug pressure together may constrain
virus evolution significantly and result in control of
infection.
Besides genetic heterogeneity, the development of an
efficient vaccine against HIV remains elusive because of
the difficulties of inducing an efficient immune response
[98,136]. Individuals who control infection display a
strong cellular response [137-139]. Many experimental
vaccines have failed in directing the effector response to
a more cellular profile [140]. Furthermore, HIV infection
induces a low titer of neutralizing antibodies [141,142].
Gp120 and gp41 are the HIV proteins exposed at the
surface of the virion. These proteins are responsible for
the attachment of HIV to the cell surface and the virus
has developed several strategies to avoid recognition and
blocking by antibodies. The region of the protein that
interacts with the CD4 cellular receptor is a hypervariable loop. A great number of antibody-escape mutants
are mapped to this region of the HIV genome. The loop
however, is highly glycosylated and it is only exposed at
the surface of the protein in the precise moment of the
interaction with the cellular receptor [143]. These two
combined features complicate the fitting of potentially
neutralizing antibodies [142].
HIV is a member of the retrovirus family with the
ability to integrate its genome into the host cell genome
[95]. Genome integration is another challenge to
develop an effective vaccine because latently infected
cells cannot be recognized by the immune system until
the integrated provirus is activated [136].
After several attempts to obtain a protective vaccine
against HIV, current efforts have shifted toward developing therapeutic vaccines which help to control infection. A vaccine that elicits an incomplete response may
be sufficient to keep viral load in controllable levels.
The vaccine would not prevent infection by HIV, but it
would delay or prevent the progression to AIDS, the
final stage of the disease [137]. The reduction in viral
load would also reduce the number of secondary transmissions of the infection, because the efficiency of transmission depends on viral load levels.

Virus dynamics and therapeutic vaccines

A viral infection is a complex molecular process, but it
can be approximated by a few major steps (Figure 2).
Initially, the virus needs to find a susceptible cell and
enter into it. Once inside the cell, virus replication starts
and viral offspring is released. Infected cells will eventually die. Released virus particles are either inactivated
or they hit a new susceptible cell, in which case the
infection cycle is closed and a chain reaction of sequential infections is triggered [144-146]. The dynamics of
the viral replication cycle can be expressed in mathematical terms as follows:
ï¦
x = ï¬ â dx â ï¢ xv
ï¦
y = ï¢ xv â ay â pyz
ï¦
v = ky â uv
ï¦
z = c â bz

This ordinary differential equation (ODE) system
describes uninfected cells, x, being infected with efficiency b, infected cells, y, dying and releasing viral offspring at rate a, and free virus, v, being produced at rate
k and inactivated at rate u. In the absence of viral infection, cells reproduce at rate l and die at rate d. Oversimplifying the role of the immune system, the immune
cells, z, grow and die with rates c and b, respectively.
They remove infected cells from the system with efficiency p. Each specific viral family may give rise to modifications of this model due to variations in its life cycle.
But the ODE system is the core of a family of

Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the basic model of virus
dynamics. When a susceptible cell and a virus meet, the cell
becomes infected. The infected cell releases to the extracellular
medium the progeny of the initial infecting virus. The new progeny
will in turn infect additional susceptible cells. At this point a chain
reaction is started which is the basis of the cellular and viral
dynamics during an infection (adapted from [144]).

Ojosnegros and Beerenwinkel Immunome Research 2010, 6(Suppl 2):S5

mathematical models that describe the turnover of
viruses and cells during an infection.
Virus dynamics models have been successfully
employed to the study of simian immunodeficiency
viruses (SIV), HIV, and HBV, among others
[144,146-150]. The dynamics of this model are shown in
Figure 3. The model is an epidemiological SIR model
[151], in which infection is treated as a microepidemic
and host cells play the role of infected or susceptible
individuals. Whether the virus infection can spread in
the cell pool or not depends on a condition very similar
to the spread of an epidemic in a population of individuals. The parameters of the model must satisfy the
inequality R 0 > 1, where R 0 is the basic reproductive
number, defined as the number of newly infected cells
that arise from any one infected cell when almost all
cells are uninfected [144,151]. For aâ = cp/b, this number is given by
R0 =

ï¢ï¬ k

( a + a â) du

For generic parameters, if R 0 > 1 uninfected cells
become infected and produce progeny viruses exponentially. Activation of the immune system (aâ > 1) reduces
the value of R0 and slows down the spread of the infection. At the beginning of the infection, before the
immune response is mounted (aâ â 0), and after the
initial peak of viral load, viruses and infected and uninfected cells reach a stable equilibrium termed viral set

Page 9 of 14

point (Figure 3). While monitoring viral load of SIV in
infected macaques, a correlation between the viral load
at initial stages of the infection and the viral set point
was observed [152,153]. One can demonstrate that the
equilibrium abundance of viruses, v*, and the logarithm
of the virus load during the exponential growth phase,
follow the linear relationship
v* =

d
â¡ln v ( t ) â ln v0 â¤
â¦
ï¢ at â£

This result is important in HIV research, because several studies indicate that there is a positive correlation
between viral load and disease progression. Individuals
who display a lower viral load during the first stage of
the infection have higher chances to survive and control
the infection [154].
From the virus dynamics point of view, a successful
vaccine is one that boosts the immune response, i.e.,
increases the parameter aâ, such that R 0 is reduced
below the critical value of 1. Under such conditions, the
infection will initially grow, but then viral load will
rapidly decline and the infection will eventually be
cleared from the organism. However, even if the vaccine
induces an immune response that is not strong enough
to reduce R0 to a value below 1, it may still be beneficial. As described above, slowing down the initial exponential increase of the viral load has a negative effect on
the viral set point. This type of imperfect vaccine is also
called a therapeutic vaccine. In the case of HIV, it could
help infected patients to control disease progression in
two ways. First, it may reduce viral load during the
chronic phase of the infection, and second it may reduce
viremia below the threshold of inter-host virus transmission (Figure 3) [137,144,155-157].
On the epidemiological level, mathematical models of
inter-host transmission of a given viral pathogen can
predict the portion of individuals within a population
that needs to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd
immunity (HI). HI occurs if partial vaccination provides
protection also to unvaccinated individuals and the
population is protected against invasion of the pathogen.
The critical proportion of immune individuals above
which the disease cannot persist is the HI threshold
HI = 1 â

Figure 3 Dynamics of viral load and susceptible cells before
onset of the immune response. Initially, viral load grows
exponentially to eventually achieve an equilibrium termed viral set
point. Therapeutic vaccines might slow down the initial exponential
increase of viral load, which consequently implies a reduction in the
viral load during the set point phase of the infection. The plot
represents a typical chronic infection such us the one produced by
HIV.

Here R 0 is the basic reproductive number of the
pathogen in the host population, rather than in the cell
population of a single host as discussed above. The
higher the reproductive ratio of the disease, the more
individuals need to be effectively protected by vaccination. The HI threshold varies not only with the virulence

Ojosnegros and Beerenwinkel Immunome Research 2010, 6(Suppl 2):S5

of the disease, but also with the efficacy of the vaccine
and the contact dynamics of the host population.
Attenuation strategies and the evolution of virulence in
RNA viruses

Individual viruses inside the quasispecies can display
very different degrees of virulence. This trait is measured as the cell killing capacity, when considering cell
culture experiments, and as the host morbidity or mortality, when focusing on whole-organism pathology
[158,159]. Replicative fitness is also highly variable
among viruses of the same quasispecies, and in general,
not directly correlated to virulence [158]. Understanding
the evolution of these two viral traits is fundamental to
understanding and controlling the spread of viral diseases and to the design of LAVs.
Since attenuated viruses may elicit a potent immune
response without causing harm to the host, several strategies are being explored to obtain candidate viruses for
LAVs, i.e., viruses displaying a reduced cell killing or
replicative ability. Serial cytolytic transfers in cell culture
tend to select viruses attenuated in the original host
[160]. This is the case for FMDV or yellow fever virus
among other viruses, and is currently an approved technique for several LAV preparations. Viruses selected
after severe bottlenecks, such as serial plaque-to-plaque
transfers, present a reduced fitness due to the accumulation of mutations associated with the MÃ¼llerâs ratchet
effect [161,162]. A new promising strategy for the
attenuation of viruses is the rational design and synthesis of viral genomes with a strong codon bias. This
approach has been implemented for Poliovirus and
influenza virus [163,164]. The viral genome synthesized
encodes the same amino acid sequence as the wild type
virus but encoded by infrequent codons in their host
cells. Viruses harboring fidelity mutations in the replicase genes tend to produce a quasispecies of lower
diversity and to be attenuated in vivo. This feature has
also been employed to the rational design of a Poliovirus
LAV [165]. Other strategies conceived to limit viral
replication include the design of specific microRNAs or
zinc finger nucleases targeting the viral genome [166].
Many mathematical models have been developed to
describe the evolution of virulence in diverse viral populations. One conclusion of these theoretical studies is
that virulence can increase in the population under a
variety of conditions [167]. The basic model of virus
dynamics, however, states that less cytopathic variants
are more productive in the long term of the infection,
because the abundance of both viruses and infected cells
is inversely correlated with the cytopathogenicity, a, of
the viral variants [144]. For R0 > 1,

Recently, a FMDV population has been reported to
diversify into two genetically distinct subpopulations
that also differ in virulence. The viral variants have been
characterized phenotypically in considerable detail and
their coevolutionary dynamics, when competing for the
same cell pool in vitro, have been analyzed. The competition experiment has been described by an extension of
the basic model of virus dynamics introduced above.
The experimental and theoretical results indicate that
less virulent strains are more efficient in outcompeting
the virulent ones in coinfected cells. Therefore, the fitness of variants of different virulence is density-dependent [168]. The cell competition model offers an
explanation of several previous observations of suppression of high fitness mutants in dissimilar viral systems
[169-172]. This density-dependent selection due to varying efficiency of viral replication alone or in coinfection
is reminiscent of the concept of a competition-colonization trade-off in ecology [173]. Here, virulent viral variants play the role of colonizers and viruses efficient
within coinfected cells are competitors. The attenuating
effect of competitor-colonizer competition appears even
more pronounced if many viruses from a broad spectrum of virulence are considered.

Conclusions
Viral evolution and the genetic diversity it produces are
fundamental factors for the success of vaccine candidates, because immune responses need to be stimulated
against a potentially very broad spectrum of existing
viruses and new viral immune escape variants are likely
to be generated. Mathematical modeling of viral evolutionary dynamics will therefore play an increasingly
important role in vaccine design. It can identify genomic
regions that are under selective pressure, support the
selection or construction of vaccine strains, predict evolutionary escape from immune pressure, guide vaccination campaigns, estimate the effect of therapeutic
vaccines, and support the design of new attenuation
strategies. Most of our discussion has been in the context of RNA viruses and many issues are most pronounced for this class of viruses. Nevertheless, we
expect most statistical models and computational methods to be applicable to other viruses and different
pathogens, too. On the other hand, the distinct evolutionary dynamics of influenza A and HIV-1, two of the
most widely studied RNA viruses, have highlighted the
need for careful analysis of viral infection dynamics
within and among individuals.
