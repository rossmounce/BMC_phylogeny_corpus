Abstract
Background: Selenium (Se) is a trace element that occurs in proteins in the form of
selenocysteine (Sec) and in tRNAs in the form of selenouridine (SeU). Selenophosphate synthetase
(SelD) is required for both utilization traits. However, previous research also revealed SelDs in two
organisms lacking Sec and SeU, suggesting a possible additional use of Se that is dependent on SelD.
Results: In this study, we conducted comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses to
characterize genes involved in Se utilization. Candidate genes identified included SelA/SelB and
YbbB that define Sec and SeU pathways, respectively, and NADH oxidoreductase that is predicted
to generate a SelD substrate. In addition, among 227 organisms containing SelD, 10 prokaryotes
were identified that lacked SelA/SelB and YbbB. Investigation of selD neighboring genes in these
organisms revealed a SirA-like protein and two hypothetical proteins HP1 and HP2 that were
strongly linked to a novel Se utilization. With these new signature proteins, 32 bacteria and archaea
were found that utilized these proteins, likely as part of the new Se utilization trait. Metabolic
labeling of one organism containing an orphan SelD, Enterococcus faecalis, with 75Se revealed a
protein containing labile Se species that could be released by treatment with reducing agents,
suggesting non-Sec utilization of Se in this organism.
Conclusion: These studies suggest the occurrence of a third Se utilization trait in bacteria and
archaea.

Background
Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for many
organisms in the three domains of life. The best known
biological functions of Se are exerted by selenocysteine
(Sec) residues [1-3]. Sec, known as the 21st amino acid, is
co-translationally inserted into proteins by recoding an
opal (UGA) codon from stop to Sec function [4-6]. These
UGA codons are recognized by a complex molecular

machinery that has common core components, but also
differences among the three domains of life [3,4,7-10].
The mechanism of Sec insertion into protein in response
to UGA has been most thoroughly elucidated in
Escherichia coli [3,4,11-13]. Bacterial selenoprotein
mRNAs carry a Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element
immediately downstream of Sec-encoding UGA codons

[4,5]. The SECIS element binds a Sec-specific elongation
factor, SelB, and forms a complex with tRNASec (SelC),
whose UCA anticodon matches the UGA codon. tRNASec
is initially acylated with serine by seryl-tRNA synthetase
and is then converted to Sec-tRNASec by Sec synthase
(SelA). SelA utilizes selenophosphate as the selenium
donor, which in turn is synthesized by selenophosphate
synthetase (SelD).
In some prokaryotes, Se (also in the form of selenophosphate) is used for the biosynthesis of a modified tRNA
nucleotide,
5-methylaminomethyl-2-selenouridine
(mnm5Se2U, or SeU), which is located in the wobble position of the anticodons of tRNALys, tRNAGlu, and tRNAGln
[14-16]. The proposed function of SeU involves codonanticodon interactions that help base pair discrimination
at the wobble position and/or translation efficiency
[16,17]. A 2-selenouridine synthase (YbbB) is necessary to
replace a sulfur atom in 2-thiouridine in these tRNAs with
Se [18].
In addition to Sec and SeU, Se can be utilized in the form
of a cofactor in certain molybdenum (Mo)-containing
hydroxylases [19-23]. Nicotinic acid hydroxylase and xanthine dehydrogenase are the best known representatives
of this protein class. In these enzymes, Se is covalently
bound to Mo in the active site, but the specific structure of
the Se cofactor is not known. In nicotinic acid hydroxylase, Se is lost during protein storage and during simple
SDS-PAGE procedures [20]. These properties made it difficult to characterize this class of proteins and determine
the mechanism of Se cofactor structure and biosynthesis.
Recently, we analyzed evolutionary dynamics of Sec and
SeU utilization traits (i.e., analyzed genes involved in the
corresponding biosynthetic pathways) in prokaryotes and
reported the occurrence of orphan SelD proteins in two
organisms lacking known components of Sec and SeU
traits or genes encoding selenoproteins [24]. These organisms included a bacterium, Enterococcus faecalis, and an
archaeon, Haloarcula marismortui. The SelD sequences in
the two organisms are typical SelDs containing a conserved Cys residue in the predicted active site and clustering with other SelD sequences [24]. These proteins could
be distinguished from thiamine-monophosphate kinase,
the hydrogenase maturation factor HypE, and other proteins that, like SelDs, have an aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (AIRS) domain. The curious presence of
orphan SelD in these prokaryotes suggested an additional,
unknown use of Se that is dependent on SelD.
In this study, we carried out searches in completely
sequenced prokaryotic genomes for machinery involved
in Se utilization. Known components, i.e., SelA, SelB and
YbbB, could be easily identified by comparative genom-

ics, and the analyses also have generated evidence for
additional proteins involved. Since neighboring genes of
selD may provide potential information regarding Se utilization, we further employed comparative genomics
tools to identify candidate genes involved in the third,
SelD-based trait, in prokaryotes. Finally, we identified
many organisms containing this new trait and carried out
experimental analyses in one such organism. Overall,
these data provide evidence for an additional use of Se in
nature.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of SelD-dependent pathways of Se
utilization
Since SelD (COG0709) has been shown to be a key factor
for Se utilization by generating a Se donor compound
(and therefore discriminating Se from sulfur for further
use), identification of functional linkages involving SelD
may help characterize the pathways of Se utilization. We
initially used STRING [[25], the interactor was set to
COG-mode] to examine such functional linkages based
on neighborhood, gene fusion and co-occurrence analyses. The protein with the best score was YbbB, a SeU synthase (COG2603). This gene was often located in the
same operon with selD and the two proteins also showed
similar patterns of occurrence [24]. The next SelD link was
SelB (COG3276), which was also identified by gene
neighborhood and co-occurrence, but the linkage was
independent of YbbB (because selD formed operons with
either ybbB or selB but rarely with both). As expected, SelB
was most closely linked with Sec synthase SelA
(COG1921), which also showed a strong association with
SelD.

The following SelD link was NADH oxidoreductase
homolog (COG1252), which was fused with SelD in
cyanobacteria and several other organisms [24]. This association suggests that NADH oxidoreductase may be the
reductant for a Se compound and that the reduced form of
this compound may be utilized by SelD for biosynthesis
of selenophosphate. Like YbbB and SelA/SelB, NADH oxidoreductase function likely corresponds to the known use
of Se. Excluding spurious predictions due to protein misannotation, the following hit was a SirA-like protein that
belonged to COG0425 (predicted redox protein, regulator
of disulfide bond formation). This protein was associated
with SelD through gene neighborhood (i.e., location of
genes next to each other, or in close vicinity, in the
genome) predictions of STRING. Thus, STRING-based
analysis identified known proteins involved in two pathways of Se utilization (e.g., SelA/SelB in the Sec pathway,
and YbbB in the SeU pathway) and suggested the role of
NADH dehydrogenase in generating a SelD substrate and
of SirA-like protein in an unknown SelD-linked process.

orphan SelDs, C. phytofermentans, E. faecalis and H. marismortui have been completely sequenced, and most other
genomes are characterized by high sequence coverage
(e.g., 9.8× for A. caccae, 8.53× for C. butyricum 8.7× for R.
gnavus, 8.9× for R. obeum and 11.6× for R. torques). In
addition, selD typically clusters with Sec and/or SeU biosynthesis/insertion genes, whereas in these organisms,
other genes cluster with selD. Thus, the possibility that all
genes involved in Sec or SeU utilization have not been
sequenced or annotated in the genomes containing
orphan SelD is extremely low. The genomic context of
selD in the three complete orphan SelD-containing
genomes is shown in Fig. 1. Genomic context of the other
7 organisms is shown in Fig. S1 [see Additional file 2].

Organisms with orphan SelDs
Next, we examined SelD-linked processes in more detail,
and in particular identities of SelD-linked genes that
showed no association with the Sec and SeU pathways.
Among 589 sequenced prokaryotic genomes, we identified 227 SelD-containing organisms (219 bacteria and 8
archaea). Details are shown in Table S1 [see Additional
file 1]. Of these, 140 bacteria and 7 archaea possessed the
Sec pathway, whereas 148 bacteria and 6 archaea utilized
SeU (the two traits partially overlapped). In addition, 10
SelD-containing organisms were found that had orphan
SelD (i.e., they had SelD but lacked both SelABC and
YbbB), including previously described E. faecalis and H.
marismortui. Additional such organisms included Anaerostipes caccae, Clostridium butyricum, C. phytofermentans, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus gnavus, R. obeum, R.
torques and Vibrio shilonii. It should be noted that except
for E. faecalis, H. marismortui and V. shilonii, all other species belonged to Firmicutes/Clostridia where many species
possess Sec and/or SeU utilization traits. However, previous studies have shown a highly dynamic evolution of
both traits, which often results in the loss of these traits in
bacterial phyla [24]. Moreover, of the 10 organisms with

A third pathway of Se utilization
To investigate a possible new SelD-associated pathway, 10
genes upstream and downstream of selD in the genomes
with orphan SelDs were examined in detail. First, we
found that the sirA-like gene (EF2566, SirA-like domain is
located in the N-terminal of the protein, the C-terminal
domain is a distant homolog of DsrE family) is located
next to selD in several organisms in different bacterial

phyla, suggesting that the SirA-like protein may be
involved in Se metabolism. This observation is consistent
with the STRING analysis. The specific function of SirAlike is not clear.
Next, we found that two additional proteins, hypothetical
proteins HP1 (EF2563) and HP2 (EF2564), co-occurred
in SelD-containing organisms, including all orphan SelDcontaining organisms, although homologs of each protein could also be found in organisms lacking SelD. Phylogenetic analyses of these two proteins are shown in Fig.
2. A total of 32 organisms (14% of all SelD-containing
organisms, most are Firmicutes/Clostridia) containing
both HP1 and HP2 proteins as well as SelD were identified. We noticed that all HP1 sequences in organisms having SelD and HP2 were clustered in one subfamily,
suggesting that these sequences might be functionally
linked to SelD. Orthologs of HP1 were also found in additional SelD-containing organisms (e.g., Burkholderia vietnamiensis and Azorhizobium caulinodans) which did not
have HP2. Although significant similarity was observed
between sequences in this putative subfamily and other
homologs (e.g., e-value is 8e-13 and identity is over 33%

between E. faecalis and B. vietnamiensis), multiple alignment of HP1 sequences suggested several specific residues
which are only present in the SelD-linked subfamily (Fig.
3). Therefore, it appears that these HP1 proteins form a
separate subfamily which is involved in the third Se utilization trait, perhaps distinguished by some of these conserved residues. In addition, most HP2 sequences were
found in organisms containing both SelD and HP1,
except for 5 organisms which lacked HP1 (4 SelD-lacking
and 1 SelD-containing). Previously, we observed that
homologs of SelA, a key factor in Sec biosynthesis in bacteria, are also found in organisms that lack the Sec-decoding trait, suggesting that SelA (or its close homologs)
might have acquired a new function in these organisms
[24]. Similarly, HP1 or HP2 homologs may also have
additional functions in organisms lacking SelD. Co-occurrence of SelD, HP1 and HP2 might provide an initial
screen for identifying organisms with additional utilization of Se. Although two thirds of these organisms also
possess either Sec or SeU utilization traits, the fact that 10
out of 32 organisms belonging to three different phyla
(Firmicutes/Clostridia, Firmicutes/Lactobacillales and
Proteobacteria/gamma/Vibrionaceae) possess orphan

Figure alignment of hypothetical protein HP1
Multiple3
Multiple alignment of hypothetical protein HP1. Representative sequences were divided into two groups: SelD-related
subgroup and other homologs. Residues which are strictly conserved in the SelD-related subgroup are shown in red background. Other residues shown in white on black or grey are conserved in homologs. Organisms containing orphan SelD are
highlighted in pink font.

SelDs argues against the possibility that these organisms
are simultaneously in the process of acquiring the Sec or
SeU traits or of losing such traits.
Other candidate genes in the vicinity of selD in E. faecalis
genome, e.g., EF2565 (Hypothetical protein), EF2568
(COG0520, CsdB) and EF2572 (ModE), showed wider
distribution than SelD itself. However, some members of
these families were selD neighbors in several organisms,
and some were even fused with HP1 or HP2. These
included EF2569 (a MobA-related protein), EF2570 (this
protein is annotated as aldehyde oxidoreductase which
belongs to xanthine oxidase family, and contains both
[2Fe-2S]-binding and molybdopterin-binding domains)
and EF2571 (COG1975, XdhC, Xanthine and CO dehydrogenases maturation factor, XdhC/CoxF family). These
observations suggest functional links among these pro-

teins. Table 1 shows the genomic location of all candidate
genes (including selD and sirA-like) in the 32 organisms
defined by HP1, HP2 and SelD proteins. Although selD
was found to be in vicinity of HP1 and HP2 genes only in
5 organisms, all of them were orphan SelD-containing
prokaryotes.
The SirA-like protein was also found in all 32 organisms
possessing HP1 and HP2 proteins although some of these
organisms contained its slightly more distant homologs
(e.g., H. marismortui and E. coli). As discussed above, selD
is often clustered with sirA-like, and this situation was
found in 12 out of 32 organisms. Close homologs of SirAlike protein were also detected in several organisms lacking HP1 and HP2, such as Methanococcus maripaludis (Secutilizing archaea), Clostridium perfringens and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (Sec-utilizing bacteria) and Por-

phyromonas gingivalis (SeU-utilizing bacteria). Considering
that proteins containing SirA domain belong to a large
superfamily and may have different functions, phylogenetic analysis was used to identify a SirA subfamily most
closely linked to HP1 and/or HP2 (Fig. 4). However, no
such branch was found. Moreover, multiple alignment of
SirA-like sequences did not show conserved residues
which are only present in organisms containing HP1 and
HP2 (Fig. 5).
To further examine functional linkages among SelD, SirAlike, HP1 and HP2 proteins, we, again, used STRING
(neighborhood and co-occurrence tools) and searched for
functional associations involving SirA-like, HP1 and HP2.
Since no known COG is associated with HP1 or HP2, and
SirA-like belongs to a large family of SirA proteins defined
by a single COG, we selected a "search by protein
sequence" option and set the interactor tool to a protein
mode. Such configuration can provide maximum sensitivity although it has a slightly lower coverage compared
with the COG mode [25]. Top candidates are shown in
Table 2, and SelD was among these candidates for each
examined protein. In addition, SelD was the top functional link for SirA-like. Although both SirA-like and HP1/
HP2 seem to be functionally linked to SelD, there are
important differences among these proteins and which of
these proteins best define the putative third Se utilization
trait is not clear. It is possible that SirA-like protein is
involved in Se metabolism in all three utilization traits
whereas HP1 and HP2 are only specific for the third Se utilization trait.
Several other detected selD neighboring genes were often
located in the same operon. One exception was that we
could not detect homologs of MobA-related protein
(COG2068) in Shigella dysenteriae. However, this genome
is not yet complete. Previous studies showed that some of
these genes are involved in the formation and utilization
of molybdopterin (MPT), which coordinated Mo thereby
generating the Mo cofactor in Mo-dependent enzymes
[26-28]. For example, XdhC is present in various Mo-utilizing organisms and is involved in Mo cofactor binding
and insertion into xanthine dehydrogenase [29]. It is possible that Se (in the form of selenophosphate) is used as
an additional cofactor that supports Mo utilization in certain organisms. The predicted aldehyde oxidoreductase in
E. faecalis, which belongs to Mo-dependent xanthine oxidase family [27,28,30] and is often found to be clustered
with HP1 and/or HP2 (see Table 1), might be a potential
user which utilizes both Se and Mo. However, phylogenetic analysis of aldehyde oxidoreductase (both large and
small subunit) did not yield a subfamily formed by organisms containing the new Se utilization trait (instead, they
are scattered in different branches, data not shown).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/251

Metabolically labeled Se-binding protein in E. faecalis
To directly analyze the use of Se in E. faecalis, we metabolically labeled this organism with 75Se under aerobic and
anaerobic conditions, and in parallel we labeled E. coli
strain Nova Blue cells as a control. In both conditions, a
30 kDa 75Se-labeled band was observed in E. faecalis
extracts (SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents),
whereas as expected, E. coli showed bands in the 80–110
kDa region and the labeling pattern was different in aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig. 6A). After treatment
with DTT (with or without heating), the band disappeared
(Fig. 6B). 2-Mercatoethanol was also effective in releasing
Se, whereas these treatments had no influence on the 75Se
bands in E. coli extracts as these corresponded to Sec-containing proteins (data not shown). The observations suggest that E. faecalis does utilize Se, that this element occurs
in a protein of ~30 kDa and that this Se species is labile
and is not Sec. Therefore, it is possible that this 30 kDa
protein may be involved in the third SelD-related, Se utilization trait. It should be noted, however, that an additional utilization of Se in E. faecalis unrelated to SelD
function could not be excluded. Independent of its
nature, both computational and experimental data
exclude a possibility of Sec and SeU use and suggest a
novel use of Se in this organism.

The large subunits of proteins in the xanthine oxidase
family (COG1529, CoxL), whose molecular weights are
over 80 kDa, bind MPT (27, 31, 32). The detected 30 kDa
protein in E. faecalis is inconsistent with the aldehyde oxidoreductase large subunit. Similarly, the aldehyde oxidoreductase small subunit (CoxS), which binds 2Fe-2S,
was also excluded because it is fused with the large subunit in E. faecalis. Thus, the 30 kDa Se-binding protein is
unlikely to be a member of the Mo-dependent hydroxylase family. It is interesting, however, that both HP1 and
HP2 have similar predicted molecular weights (28.5 kDa
and 28.4 kDa, respectively). Thus, one of them might be
the detected protein.
We carried out a number of chromatographic steps to
purify the 30 kDa Se-binding protein. It was binding both
DEAE-Sepharose and Phenyl-Sepharose and could be
enriched on these columns. However, lability and consistent loss of Se precluded its identification. We also
attempted two-dimensional PAGE analysis of the Se-binding protein (under non-reducing conditions), but no 75Se
radioactive spot was found following this procedure, suggesting that two-dimensional PAGE conditions also led to
the release of Se from the Se-binding protein. Further
studies will be needed to determine the identity of the 30
kDa Se-binding protein. Our current studies, however,
suggested the presence of a novel utilization of Se in an
orphan SelD-containing organism, E. faecalis, which

Figure 6 labeling of E. faecalis with 75Se and analysis of Se-binding proteins
Metabolic
Metabolic labeling of E. faecalis with 75Se and analysis of Se-binding proteins. (A) E. faecalis and E. coli were metabolically labeled under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. 30 μg of total protein from each organism were resolved by SDS-PAGE
gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. 75Se patterns were visualized with a PhosphorImager. Molecular masses of protein
standards (in kilodaltons) are shown on the right. (B) Se-containing proteins were heated or treated with DTT. 30 μg of total
protein from each organism were resolved by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. 75Se patterns were visualized with a PhosphorImager. Molecular masses of protein standards (in kilodaltons) are shown on the right.

appears to be the third trait of Se utilization in prokaryotes.

Conclusion
In this study, we carried out comparative genomics and
phylogenetic analyses to identify new genes linked to Se
utilization in prokaryotes. We identified several organisms with orphan SelD that we predict to possess the third
Se utilization trait, which is not limited to these species.
SelD, HP1, HP2 as well as SirA-like were identified as the
best candidate signature genes for this trait. We further
directly demonstrated the use of Se in E. faecalis by detecting a 30 kDa protein containing a non-Sec, non-SeU labile
Se species. It cannot be excluded that Se is used as a co-factor for certain Mo hydroxylases (known to contain a labile
Se cofactor), but current evidence does not provide strong
support for this possibility. Further studies are required to
determine whether the 30 kDa Se-binding protein or
other proteins in organisms with orphan SelDs represent
the use of Se in this organism, or it is an intermediate state
for further delivery to other proteins, such as Mo-dependent hydroxylases.

Methods
Databases, genomes and sequences
Sequenced prokaryotic genomes from current Entrez
Microbial Genome Project were used in this study (541
bacterial and 48 archaeal genomes; Feb 1, 2008). Due to
the large number of sequenced strains for some bacterial
species, we utilized only one strain from each species (e.g.,
Escherichia coli K12 represented all Escherichia coli).

We used E. coli SelA, SelB, SelD, and YbbB sequences as
queries to search for components of Sec-decoding and
SeU traits based on previously used criteria [24]. In addition, we selected 10 genes upstream and downstream of
selD in the genomes with orphan SelDs. A list of selDflanking genes in E. faecalis is shown in Table 3. For each
of these proteins (including SelD), TBLASTN [33] was initially used to identify genes coding for homologs with a
cutoff of E-value ≤ 0.01. Orthologous proteins were
defined as bidirectional best hits [34]. When necessary,
orthologs were also confirmed by genomic location analysis or building phylogenetic trees for the corresponding
protein families.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

iable (gap-rich) regions were excluded. The resulting multiple alignments were then checked for conservation of
functional residues and manually edited. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed using PHYLIP programs [36].
Pairwise distance matrices were calculated by PROTDIST
to estimate the expected amino acid replacements per
position. Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were obtained with
NEIGHBOR and the most parsimonious trees were determined with PROTPARS. Robustness of these trees was
evaluated by maximum likelihood (ML) analysis with
PHYML [37] and Bayesian estimation of phylogeny with
MrBayes [38].
Metabolic labeling of E. faecalis with 75Se and purification
of Se-binding proteins
To examine for the occurrence of Se-binding proteins in E.
faecalis, 50 ml of E. faecalis strain 29212 (ATCC) in BHI
media (Gibco) and E. coli strain Nova Blue (Novagen) in
LB media (MP Bio) were metabolically labeled with 50
μCi of 75Se ([75Se]selenious acid (specific activity, 1,000
Ci/mmol) Research Reactor Facility, University of Missouri (Columbia, Mo.)) for 24 h. Bacterial cultures were
grown at 37°C in the dark with extensive agitation (250
rpm) to provide sufficient aeration. For anaerobic growth
(preferred for E. faecalis), the cultures were cultivated in
fully filled, parafilm-sealed tubes without shaking. Cells
were collected, resuspended in PBS buffer and sonicated.
30 μg of total soluble protein from each organism were

resolved by 10% native or SDS-PAGE under non-reducing
conditions and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). 75Se-labeled proteins were visualized with a
PhosphorImager. To enrich for Se-binding proteins, 50 ml
of E. faecalis cells were labeled with 75Se for 24 h at 37°C
without shaking in low oxygen conditions and the labeled
cells were mixed with 5 g of unlabeled cells that were cultured separately using the same procedure. Cells were
washed twice in cold PBS, resuspended in PBS containing
EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), and Sebinding proteins were fractionated under non-reducing
conditions on DEAE-Sepharose and Phenyl-Sepharose
(GE Healthcare) columns following 75Se radioactivity in
protein fractions. Fractions containing 75Se were collected
and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Analysis of E. faecalis Se-binding proteins
Chromatographically enriched Se-binding proteins from
E. faecalis were subjected heat and reducing agent treatments. Protein samples (~30 μg of total protein) were
treated by heating (90°C for 10 min) in SDS sample
buffer (Invitrogen) with or without 10 mM DTT or 2-mercaptoethanol, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE.

Notes
During the review of this manuscript, another study was
published (Haft DH and Self WT. Biol Direct. 2008. 3: 4)

the identification of selenium-dependent molybdenum
hydroxylases [39]. These data are consistent with the idea
that a new SelD-associated Se utilization pathway is
present in certain organisms such as E. faecalis.
