The origin of Eastern European Jews revealed by
autosomal, sex chromosomal and mtDNA
polymorphisms
Avshalom Zoossmann-Diskin1,2,3

Abstract
Background: This study aims to establish the likely origin of EEJ (Eastern European Jews) by genetic distance
analysis of autosomal markers and haplogroups on the X and Y chromosomes and mtDNA.
Results: According to the autosomal polymorphisms the investigated Jewish populations do not share a common
origin, and EEJ are closer to Italians in particular and to Europeans in general than to the other Jewish populations.
The similarity of EEJ to Italians and Europeans is also supported by the X chromosomal haplogroups. In contrast
according to the Y-chromosomal haplogroups EEJ are closest to the non-Jewish populations of the Eastern
Mediterranean. MtDNA shows a mixed pattern, but overall EEJ are more distant from most populations and hold a
marginal rather than a central position. The autosomal genetic distance matrix has a very high correlation (0.789)
with geography, whereas the X-chromosomal, Y-chromosomal and mtDNA matrices have a lower correlation
(0.540, 0.395 and 0.641 respectively).
Conclusions: The close genetic resemblance to Italians accords with the historical presumption that Ashkenazi
Jews started their migrations across Europe in Italy and with historical evidence that conversion to Judaism was
common in ancient Rome. The reasons for the discrepancy between the biparental markers and the uniparental
markers are discussed.

Background
The genetic affinities of the Jewish populations have
been studied since the early days of genetics, yet the origin of these populations is still obscure. Some of the
studies, trying to establish the origins of the Jewish
populations with autosomal markers, claimed that the
Jewish populations have a common origin, but others
concluded that the Jews are a very diverse group. This
corpus of studies has already been critically reviewed [1].
The origin of Eastern European Jews, (EEJ) by far the
largest and most important Ashkenazi population, and
their affinities to other Jewish and European populations
are still not resolved. Studies that compared them by
genetic distance analysis of autosomal markers to

European Mediterranean populations revealed that they
are closer to Europeans than to other Jewish populations
[1-3].
EEJ are the largest and most investigated Jewish community, yet their history as Franco-German Jewry is
known to us only since their appearance in the 9th century, and their subsequent migration a few hundred
years later to Eastern Europe [4,5]. Where did these
Jews come from? It seems that they came to Germany
and France from Italy [5-8]. It is also possible that some
Jews migrated northward from the Italian colonies on
the northern shore of the Black Sea [9]. All these Jews
are likely the descendents of proselytes. Conversion to
Judaism was common in Rome in the first centuries BC
and AD. Judaism gained many followers among all
ranks of Roman Society [10-13].
The aim of this study is to establish the likely origin of
this major Jewish population by using a larger dataset of

autosomal markers, and compare the results to analyses
based on the available data for the X and Y chromosomes and for mtDNA.

Methods
Six Jewish populations: EEJ, Moroccan Jews, Iraqi Jews.
Iranian Jews, Yemenite Jews and Ethiopian Jews, which
have been studied for all the autosomal markers used in
this study, are included in the analysis. EEJ are defined
on the basis of history as those Jews originating from
the areas of the Polish-Lithuanian Kingdom and their
descendants in bordering regions, encompassing the territories of Russia, Poland, the Baltic States, Belarus, Moldavia, Moldova (the north-eastern part of Romania) and
the Ukraine. The Data on the non-autosomal markers
were also available for other Jewish populations: Bulgarian Jews (X, mtDNA), Turkish Jews (X, mtDNA), Tunisian Jews (mtDNA), Libyan Jews (Y, mtDNA) and
Djerban Jews (Y).
The seventeen autosomal markers are: AK, ADA,
PGM1, PGD, ACP, ESD, GPT, HP, GC, J311 MspI &
MetH TaqI (both on chromosome 7 near the CF locus),
FV G1691A, FII G20210A, MTHFR C677T, CBS
844ins68, ACE ID and PAH XmnI. All the markers are
unique-event-polymorphisms, and apart from two insertions (CBS 844ins68, ACE ID) are all SNPs. The first
nine markers are polymorphisms of red cell enzymes
and serum proteins, and were typed mostly by protein
electrophoresis, but the variation at the protein level is
directly related in a 1:1 manner to the SNP variation at
the DNA level. Indeed, some of the results for the Jewish populations were obtained by PCR methods [1,14].
The polymorphism of the remaining eight markers can
only be detected at the DNA level. J311 MspI and MetH
TaqI were typed in all the populations including the
Israeli populations (unpublished results) by Southern
blotting and hybridization [15,16]. The other 6 markers
were typed in the Israeli populations by PCR methods.
The data on FV G1691A, FII G20210A, MTHFR C677T
and CBS 844ins68 have already been published [3,17].
The data on ACE ID and PAH XmnI are still unpublished. These polymorphisms were typed according to
the methods of Rigat et al. [18] and Goltsov et al. [19]
respectively. Allele frequencies for all the populations
are given in Additional file 1: tables S1-4. Table S2
(Additional file 1) presents four markers on both sides
of the CF locus. Because of the linkage between them, I
chose to use only the two most distal markers, which
are separated by a few centimorgans. Haplogroup frequencies of the non-recombining Y chromosome (NRY),
the X chromosome (dystrophin locus, dys44, on Xp21.3)
and mtDNA are given in Additional file 1: tables S5, S6
and S7 respectively.

Gower (cited in [20]) recommends, that for microevolutionary studies, when sample sizes are quite variable
and gene frequencies do not differ greatly, Sanghvi’s G2
[21] would be the most appropriate, and this is the measure I used. Distances were also calculated with Nei’s
[22] formula and the results were very similar (r =
0.990, genetic distance matrix not shown). The neighbor
joining tree was computed by PHYLIP 3.66. Since it
does not calculate Sanghvi’s G2, I used Reynolds et al.
distance [23], which is also based on the assumption
that gene frequencies change by genetic drift alone,
solely for the calculation of the tree (genetic distance
matrix not shown). The significance of nodes in the tree
and the standard errors of the genetic distances were
computed by bootstrapping 10,000 times. Multidimensional scaling plots and Mantel tests for correlation
between genetic distance matrices and between them
and matrices of geographic distances were computed by
NTSYS 1.70. Geographic distances were calculated as
great circle distances between the capitals of the countries of origin of the populations (Warsaw was chosen
for EEJ). Mantel test significance was assessed by 10,000
permutations.

Results
The autosomal genetic distances (table 1) do not show
any particular resemblance between the Jewish populations. EEJ are closer to Italians in particular and to Europeans in general than to the other Jewish populations.
All of the distances, apart from one, differ from zero by
more than twice their standard error. A difference
between two distances can be considered meaningful, if
it is more than twice their largest standard error. The
differences between the distance of EEJ from Italians
and their distances from the other Jewish populations
are meaningful according to this criterion, and the same
is also true for all the Non-Jewish populations except
for Greeks and Russians. In fact the distance between
EEJ and Italians is the smallest distance in the matrix. A
multidimensional scaling plot of the genetic distance
matrix (figure 1) captures the proximity of EEJ to Italians and other European populations. The same is also
true for the neighbor joining tree (figure 2). It should be
noted that multidimensional scaling plots are a way to
present graphically the intricate relationships of genetic
distance matrices. As such they are necessarily less accurate than the matrices on which they are based. In order
to understand the genetic affinities of a particular population, one must examine its distances in the matrix
itself, not in the plot. The same also applies to the
neighbor joining tree. The bootstrap values indicate the
robustness of the clustering, but not the significance of
individual genetic distances.

equally close to Moroccan Jews, Palestinians, Italians
and Bulgarian Jews, but overall are more distant from
most populations and hold a marginal position in the
MDS plot, rather than a central one like in the other
plots (table 4, figure 5).
Correlations between genetic distance and geography
and between genetic distance matrices based on different markers (excluding the non-Caucasoid populations
Ethiopians and Ethiopian Jews) are shown in table 5.
The autosomal polymorphisms have a very high correlation (0.789) with geography in contrast to the more
moderate correlations of the X-chromosomal, Y-chromosomal and mtDNA polymorphisms (0.540, 0.395 and
0.641 respectively). In order to compare two competing
theories regarding the origin of EEJ, their geographic
distances were computed as if they originated from Italy
or Israel, i.e. the great circle distances for EEJ were calculated not between Warsaw and other capitals, but
between Rome or Jerusalem and other capitals. The correlation between the autosomal genetic distance matrix
and geography was slightly higher, 0.804, for Rome but
dropped to 0.694 for Jerusalem. Autosomal distances are
much better correlated with mtDNA distances (0.826)
and with X-chromosomal distances (0.732) than with Ychromosomal distances (0.437). The correlations
between the mtDNA and X-chromosomal matrices and
the Y-chromosomal matrix are rather poor (0.206 and
0.241 respectively) and insignificant. When the correlations with geography were only calculated for the
genetic distances of EEJ and not for the entire matrix
(table 6), the same trends emerge with the autosomal
correlation from Rome reaching a high of 0.926. The
correlations from Jerusalem are negative for the autosomes, the X chromosome and mtDNA. The reverse is
true for the Y chromosome.

polymorphisms. A number next to a node indicates the majority

X-chromosomal haplogroups demonstrate the same
relatedness of EEJ to Italians and other Europeans (table
2, figure 3). In contrast, according to the Y-chromosomal haplogroups EEJ are closest to the non-Jewish
populations of the Eastern Mediterranean (table 3, figure
4). MtDNA shows a mixed pattern where EEJ are about

Discussion
The autosomal genetic distance analysis presented here
clearly demonstrates that the investigated Jewish populations do not share a common origin. The resemblance
of EEJ to Italians and other European populations portrays them as an autochthonous European population. A
study conducted in a New York college in the 1920s
point to the same Ashkenazi - Italian similarity on basis
of physical characteristics. Freshmen were asked before
they knew one another to indicate the origin of their fellow students. Forty percent of the Italians were taken to
be Ashkenazi Jews, and the same percentage of Ashkenazi Jews was adjudged Italians [24]. EEJ seem to be
mainly Italian (Roman) in origin, which is easily understood, considering the historical evidence presented
above.

distances and geography and the reduced correlation

when EEJ are taken to originate from the Land of Israel
reinforce the European origin of EEJ. In fact the correlation of the autosomal markers with geography is higher
than previously described for 49 classical markers
(0.503) or ~300,000 autosomal SNPs (0.661) in Europe
[25]. If for comparison, only non-Jewish European populations are included, the correlation is lower, 0.689, but
still higher than the above mentioned correlations. It is
also interesting to note how using the three geographic
alternatives for EEJ, changes the correlation, when only
European populations are included. The correlation
remains almost the same, 0.679, for Rome but drops to
0.490 and 0.571 for Warsaw and Jerusalem respectively;
further emphasizing the correct geographic origin of EEJ
within Europe.
Biparental versus uniparental markers

At first sight it seems that there is more than one explanation for the differing results produced by the analysis
of the NRY haplogroups. It thus seems possible that EEJ
founder population in Rome was composed of exiled
Israelite males and local Roman females. In its simple
form this clearly contradicts the facts, because both the
autosomal and X-chromosomal polymorphisms demonstrate that EEJ do not occupy an intermediate position
between European and Middle Eastern populations, but
rather a strict European one. From table 1 it is clear
that Italians are as close or closer to the other Jewish
populations and Palestinians as EEJ. It is possible that
once the founder population was established no other
males but many females joined it, thus creating a

791

population that is almost entirely European in all
genetic aspects apart from its Y chromosomes. Such
phenomenon was described for the population of Antioquia, Columbia, where the autosomes point to 79% of
European ancestry and only 16% of Amerindian ancestry, whereas according to mtDNA the ancestry is 90%
Amerindian and only 2% European (there is also a small
African component). Historical records demonstrate
that local Amerindian females joined the population
only at its beginning, whereas European males joined it
also in later periods [26]. The suggestion that the proselyte ancestors of EEJ were almost entirely females does
not however accord with what we know about conversion to Judaism [10,12,27-29].
The inference that the NRY points to a Middle Eastern
origin of EEJ is erroneous not only because the Y chromosomal analysis contradicts the analyses based on the
other chromosomes, and because the NRY is a single uniparental marker that does not represent the whole history of the population, but also because its smaller
effective population size makes it much more vulnerable
to severe genetic drift caused by demographic bottlenecks. The demographic histories of three Jewish populations exemplify how different demographic patterns
make the uniparental markers more reliable for Iraqi
(Babylonian) Jews and Yemenite Jews and less reliable for
EEJ. Both Yemenite Jews and Iraqi Jews resemble populations from their regions of origin according to autosomal
markers [1,3,30-32]. Yemenite Jews, who are usually considered a small isolate, were numerous enough to have
an independent kingdom in the first centuries AD [33].

They numbered a few hundred thousand in the 12th century AD, and gradually declined; reaching only about 3040,000 in the beginning of the 20th century [34]. Babylonian Jews numbered more than a million in the first century AD [35], and constituted the majority of the
population in the area between the Euphrates and the
Tigris in the 2nd-3rd centuries AD [36]. Gilbert [37] estimates that by 600 AD there were 806,000 Jews in Mesopotamia, and according to Sassoon [38] it was inhabited
by about a million Jews in the 7 th century. In the 14 th
century the estimates for Baghdad alone range from
70,000 to hundreds thousands [38]. By 1939, 11 years
before their emigration, there were 91,000 Jews in Iraq
[35]. In contrast, the Jewish population of the PolishLithuanian Kingdom (EEJ) went through the opposite
process. Their history is one of founder effects, migrations, demographic bottlenecks and finally a rapid expansion. We know nothing about their number in the first
millennium, but after their emigration from Italy to Western Europe it is estimated that they numbered 4,000 in
1000 and 20,000 a hundred years later [8]. In 1500
already in Eastern Europe they numbered 10,000-30,000,

Page 6 of 18

in 1648 230,000-450,000 and in 1764 750,000 [39-41]. In
the 19th century because of the partitions of the PolishLithuanian Kingdom and the immigrations of Jews to
Central and Western Europe and America, the estimation of the number of EEJ becomes more difficult, but
there is no doubt that the increase in numbers was
impressive, as the number of EEJ under Russian rule
alone was 5,200,000 in 1897 [41].
The existence of severe demographic bottlenecks in
the history of EEJ has also been suggested by genetic
studies of disease-causing-mutations and mtDNA
[42-46]. The comparison based on this second uniparental marker, mtDNA, may help to resolve from within
genetics itself the problem of the Y chromosome reliability for inferring the origin of the male ancestors of
EEJ. If the European and Middle Eastern contributions
to the gene pool of EEJ were female and male respectively, then comparisons based on mtDNA must place
EEJ among other European populations, distant from
Middle Eastern populations. The mtDNA analysis presented in this study does not place EEJ among other
European populations rather their position is more
intermediate and marginal, as can be seen in figure 5
and in figure 6, where autosomal distances are correlated with mtDNA distances. This lends further support
to the notion that because of the unique demographic
history of EEJ, their uniparental markers were subjected
to stronger genetic drift than the biparental markers and
thus should not be used to trace their origin.
The data on the Y chromosome itself also support the
unreliability of the uniparental markers for discovering
the origin of EEJ. Nebel et al. [47] studied haplogroup
R-M17, whose frequency is ~12% in Ashkenazi Jews. By
comparing the structure of the STRs network among
the various Ashkenazi populations and among the various European non-Jewish populations they reached the
conclusion that a single male founder introduced this
haplogroup into Ashkenazi Jews in the first millennium.
Behar et al. [48] write “It is striking that whereas Ashkenazi populations are genetically more diverse at both
the SNP and STR level compared with their European
non-Jewish counterparts, they have greatly reduced
within-haplogroup STR variability ... This contrasting
pattern of diversity in Ashkenazi populations is evidence
for a reduction in male effective population size, possibly resulting from a series of founder events and high
rates of endogamy within Europe. This reduced effective
population size may explain the high incidence of founder disease mutations despite overall high levels of NRY
diversity”. It is unlikely that EEJ are the descendants of a
single population. Admixture coupled with small effective
population size and bottlenecks can create the puzzling
situation we encounter in the uniparental markers. Thus
smaller contributions from several populations, including

Figure 4 A multidimensional scaling plot of the Ychromosomal genetic distance matrix. Stress = 0.133. Populations
names are: EEJ - Eastern European Jews, IqJ - Iraqi Jews, InJ - Iranian
Jews, MJ - Moroccan Jews, LJ - Libyan Jews, DJ - Djerban Jews, YJ
- Yemenite Jews, EJ - Ethiopian Jews, Pa - Palestinians, It - Italians, Fr
- French, Br - British, Ge - Germans, Ru - Russians, Po - Poles, SC

Amhara. Squares represent Jews and circles non-Jews. Colour
indicates geographic region: red - Europe, green - Eastern
Mediterranean, blue - Iran-Iraq, purpule - Arabian peninsula, yellow North-Africa, brown - Ethiopia.

possibly the original Middle Eastern Jewish population,
and a major contribution from Italy combined with the
unique demography of EEJ can create the current genetic
picture without the need to invoke a major contribution
from the Middle East, which contradicts the autosomal
and X-chromosomal data.
Comments on previous studies

Some previous studies based on classical autosomal
markers concluded that EEJ are a Middle Eastern population with genetic affinities to other Jewish populations.
The problems with these studies have been previously
discussed in detail [1]. These studies used fewer markers
(mostly the less reliable antigenic markers) and failed to
include European Mediterranean populations, apart
from the discriminant analysis of Carmelli and CavalliSforza [49], which used only four markers and contradicts the results of the later more elaborate discriminant

analysis [1], and the genetic distance analysis of Livshits
et al. [32], which includes a single European Mediterranean population, Spain. Despite this when a genetic distance analysis was performed, the greater similarity of
EEJ to Russians and to a lesser extent to Germans more
than to Non-European Jews was evident [32]. In fact
Russians were more similar to EEJ than to any Non-Jewish European population in that analysis.
Recently, Cochran et al. [50] used 251 autosomal loci
to calculate genetic distances and concluded that “from
the perspective of a large collection of largely neutral
genetic variation Ashkenazim are essentially European,
not Middle Eastern”. More recently, thousands of SNPs
were used by Need et al. [51] to infer the relationships
between Ashkenazi Jews and non-Jewish Europeans and
Middle Easterners. They concluded that Ashkenazi Jews
lie approximately midway between Europeans and the
Middle Easterners, implying that Ashkenazi Jews may
contain mixed ancestry from these two regions, and that
they are close to the Adygei population from the Caucasus. However these conclusions are ill-founded, because,
they used a highly selected set of SNPs, which were
selected specifically for the purpose of distinguishing
between Ashkenazi Jews and other populations and they
inferred the origin of Ashkenazi Jews from principal
components analysis (PCA), but as Tian et al. [52] show
“PCA results are highly dependent on which population
groups are included in the analysis. Thus, there should
be some caution in interpreting these results and other
results from similar analytic methods with respect to
ascribing origins of particular ethnic groups’” Tian et al.
[52] also published a table of paired Fst distances based
on 10,500 random SNPs, which demonstrates that Ashkenazi Jews are not at all close to the Adygei population,
and similarly to what is seen in table 1, their smallest
distance is to Italians and then to Greeks. Unlike the
assertion of Need et al. [51] on the midway position,
and again similarly to what is seen in table 1, Italians
and Greeks are closer to the Middle Eastern populations
than Ashkenazi Jews.
The same phenomenon is seen in the table of Fst distances of Atzmon et al. [53]. North Italians (Bergamo
and Tuscany) are a little closer to the Jewish and Middle
Eastern populations than Ashkenazi Jews. The Italians
from Tuscany (surprisingly the sample from Bergamo
was not used) in Behar et al. [54] are also closer to the
Jewish and Middle Eastern populations than Ashkenazi
Jews. The Italians from Tuscany are in fact the closest
population to Ashkenazi Jews in Behar et al. [54]. There
is one sample that is apparently a little closer, what they
call Sephardic Jews. Unfortunately this sample is composed of two populations, Turkish Jews and Bulgarian
Jews, which should have been studied separately like all
other Jewish populations. Bulgarian Jews have been

Figure 6 Correlation of autosomal (X axis) and mtDNA (Y axis)
distances. Red circles denote EEJ. Most of the mtDNA distances of
EEJ are too high relative to their autosomal distances, in contrast to
most other distances (r = 0.826), attesting the greater genetic drift,
to which the uniparental markers of EEJ were subjected.

Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula at
the end of the 15th century) component in their gene
pool. It is not possible at this stage to say what is the
source of this resemblance, since we don’t know what is
the origin of Sephardic Jews, but considering all the
genetic affinities of both groups it likely stems from
Sephardic Jews being the descendants of converts in the
Mediterranean basin rather than from a common Jewish
origin in the Land of Israel. When one compares the
autosomal distances of EEJ (current study) or Ashkenazi
Jews (in Atzmon et al. [53] and Behar et al. [54]) from
the Jewish populations that were investigated in the current study, Iraqi, Iranian, Moroccan, Yemenite and
Ethiopian Jews, one finds perfect agreement. EEJ or
Ashkenazi Jews are much closer to non-Jewish Europeans than to these Jewish populations in all three
studies.
The studies of Atzmon et al. [53] and Behar et al. [54]
are based on 164,894 and 226,839 SNPs respectively.
While this impressive number reduces the errors of the
distances that stem from the number of markers, the
errors that stem from sampling only a small number of
individuals are much larger in these studies, where sample sizes can be as small as 2-4 individuals. The effect of

Page 11 of 18

these errors can be seen in table 7. Despite the small
number of markers the current matrix has the highest
correlation with geography. Moreover it has a higher
correlation with each of the two other matrices than the
two of them have with each other. The high correlations
between the current matrix and the other two attest for
the robustness of the autosomal genetic distances in this
study. The lower correlation between the two matrices,
which are based on more than 150,000 SNPs, is surprising and even more so, if we remember that the four
non-Jewish populations are represented by exactly the
same individuals taken from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP). It is likely then that sampling more
individuals, which represent more of the variation of the
investigated populations, is far more important than typing many markers. It is also possible that the typing
error rates of genome-wide microarray studies are much
higher, as demonstrated by the genotyping errors that
were discovered in 7 out of 29 (24%) reexamined SNPs
[55]. It seems therefore, that good characterization of
the genetic relationships between populations can be
achieved by a small number of good unique-eventpolymorphisms.

Conclusions
EEJ are Europeans probably of Roman descent who converted to Judaism at times, when Judaism was the first
monotheistic religion that spread in the ancient world.
Any other theory about their origin is not supported by
the genetic data. Future studies will have to address
their genetic affinities to various Italian populations and
examine the possibility of other components both European and Non-European in their gene pool.

Information Research Institute, Mountain View, California USA).
The author compiled and reanalyzed the data on autosomal and sex chromosomes polymorphisms collected
by different laboratories on different Jewish and WestEurasiatic populations. His analysis indicates much
greater European component of Eastern European Jews,
EEJ (essentially Ashkenazim) than of other Jewish
groups. Moreover the analysis points to Italians as the
closest population to EEJ.
The question is how to interpret this evidence. Imperial Rome was a very cosmopolitan city culturally and
genetically diverse. To what extent a sample of contemporary Italians preserves the genetic link to its population? It can simply reflect a mixture of historical
influences from different centers around the Mediterranean Sea. We should thus keep in mind that the Italian
connection may simply indicate Southern European and
Mediterranean links with the latter including Middle
Eastern roots.
Interestingly, this analysis that is based on a limited
number of markers provided results that are very similar
to a paper of Atzmon and colleagues, published five
days ago in the American Journal of Human Genetics,
and based on the microarray-based genotyping genome
of wide distributed markers. I would like the author to
comment on this paper in the context of his findings
and his thoughts and reflections on the origin of Jewish
Diasporas. Should we go back to the single locus analyses, as in the case of uniparentally transmitted markers, but targeting one by one different individual
segments of the nuclear genome? Perhaps, in this way
we could partition and identify genetic ancestries of different populations, which due to their history of relative
isolation, are considered as genetically homogenous.
The author refers to Sangvi’s G2 as the most appropriate distance metrics. Could you make it more clear
when this metric was used and when that of Reynolds
(only to produce a tree?).
Author’s response

The historical sources listed above show that conversion
to Judaism was common in ancient Rome among all
ranks of the Roman society including the imperial
families. It is thus unlikely that the original Roman
population did not constitute a significant portion of the
proselytes. What else can explain the resemblance of
EEJ to a general sample of Italians in this study and to
more local samples in the two array studies [53,54]? In
all three studies the genetic affinities of the Ashkenazim
are very similar to the affinities of the Italians, with the
Ashkenazim usually being a bit more distant from the
other populations, as can be expected from a population
that underwent a stronger genetic drift. It is thus unlikely that the Ashkenazim are a mixture of people from

Page 12 of 18

different places in the Mediterranean basin, unless current-day Italians themselves not only have absorbed foreign genetic contributions, but actually constitute such a
mixture, and this seems unlikely as well. The very high
correlation (0.926) between the genetic distances of EEJ
and geographic distances, when the latter are calculated
from Rome, also supports the origin of EEJ from Italy or
its vicinity and not merely from the Mediterranean
basin. The similarity to Italians was also evident when
several Italian populations from different provinces were
included in a comparison based on classical autosomal
markers. Most Italian populations were closer to EEJ
than all other populations (data not shown).
My comments on the papers by Atzmon et al. [53]
and Behar et al. [54] are in the discussion. Studying
autosomal haplotypes will indeed contribute to revealing
the ancestries of populations, but in order to gain meaningful insights one ought to study at least several loci
and ensure that sample sizes are adequate, this may
entail more effort than studying single SNPs, and I am
not sure that the affinities between the populations are
going to be depicted more accurately. I changed the
phrasing in Methods to make it clearer that the formula
of Reynolds et al. was only used for the calculation of
the tree.
Reviewer’s report 2

Kateryna Makova, Department of Biology, Penn State
University, Pennsylvania USA.
This is an interesting manuscript that presents intriguing results. I have only a few comments:
1. The introduction is very short, while the discussion is lengthy. I suggest moving parts of the Discussion to the Introduction.
2. Some of the statements in the Discussion are too
strong. I disagree with statements about “erroneous
Y chromosomal genetic distances”, “both uniparental
markers should not be used to trace their origin”,
“uniparental markers being unreliable”. The author
should modify them.
Author’s response

I moved the paragraph on the history of EEJ to the
Introduction. The current revised version of the paper
includes a new comparison based on mtDNA. I maintain that it adds more weight to my assertion that the
uniparental markers should not be used to trace the
origin of EEJ. In no way did I mean that the uniparental markers are always unreliable; to clarify it I modified the relevant sentence in the discussion. Indeed
from the demographic examples that I give in the Discussion, it seems that the uniparental markers can be
used to study the origins of Iraqi Jews and Yemenite
Jews.

Reviewer’s report 3

Qasim Ayub, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK (nominated by Dan Graur, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, USA).
The paper by Zoossmann-Diskin entitled ‘The origin
of Eastern European Jews revealed by autosomal and sex
chromosomal polymorphisms’ explores autosomal and
sex chromosomal polymorphisms in six Jewish populations using previously published and additional unpublished data. The author concludes that the Jewish
populations examined do not share a common origin
and that Eastern European Jews are closer to the Italian
population.
My major concern is the choice of markers and populations used in this study. The author has analyzed 17
autosomal loci, including 9 polymorphic protein electrophoretic variants in which the genotype was assumed.
Although phenotypes often do correlate with genotypes
assuming that they do can lead to erroneous results. Of
the remaining 8 it is unclear whether the same samples
were genotyped as the sample numbers for each locus
vary widely (Supplementary Tables 2-4).
The author also uses Y hapologroup frequencies and
shows a multidimensional scaling plot of Y chromosomal genetic distance matrix. However, the supplementary data (Supplementary Table 5) lists an outdated
nomenclature for Y haplogroups as the M78 marker is
no longer considered part of haplogroup E3b1. It
would be more appropriate to list which markers are
used to designate the haplogroups to ensure that they
are comparable. In addition, the haplogroups that are
selected for these analyses do not provide phylogenetic
resolution to reliably detect male genetic sub-structure
within the Middle East. The omission of recent
mtDNA studies (Behar et al., 2008, PLoS One 3:e2062)
is surprising as is the use of a single X chromosomal
locus (DYS44) to make broad conclusions about
genetic relatedness.
Current evidence, supported more recently by two
major studies carried out on Jewish populations (Atzmon et al., Am J H Genetics 86:850-859; Behar et al.,
Nature doi:10.1038) using a much larger dataset clearly
demonstrate a common genetic thread linking the
diverse Mizrahi, Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jewish populations with the populations from the Levant and Middle East. The Ashkenazi show a European component
but this is shared with many Eastern and Southern
Europeans populations. These studies contradict the
author’s conclusion and demonstrate the power of
using unbiased markers and host populations in corresponding geographic regions to address issues such as
genetic relatedness among Jewish and non-Jewish
populations

Page 13 of 18

Author’s response

I am not sure what Dr Ayub means by “assumed”, but I
suspect that he means something like the relationships
between phenotype and genotype in certain blood
groups, in which one (or more) allele is dominant over
the other and the gene frequencies of the alleles have to
be inferred from the phenotypes assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In such cases there may indeed be
errors in the gene frequencies. Protein electrophoretic
markers are completely different. Nothing is inferred! As
mentioned in Methods all the protein electrophoretic
markers in this study represent a SNP at the DNA level.
This SNP causes an amino acid change that can be
detected at the protein level. Both alleles are directly
viewed on the gel in the same way as both alleles of an
RFLP are directly viewed on the gel. Gene frequencies
are determined in both cases by simple gene counting
and the error rate in protein electrophoresis is no
greater than in DNA studies. There is no need to type
the same samples for all the polymorphisms, because
the unit of study is the population, not the individual.
One can use polymorphisms typed by different researchers using different samples and combine them to create
a genetic profile of each population. Typing all the polymorphisms on the same sample does not add more
credibility to the study. Indeed the renowned works that
employed classical autosomal markers to portray the
genetic affinities of human populations were based on
many different samples typed by many different
researchers [56,57].
The nomenclature in the Y chromosome supplementary table has been updated. Following the publication
of the study by Behar et al. [54] it was possible to add
more Jewish populations to the Y chromosome analysis
and increase the number of chromosomes for the Jewish
populations. This increase has come however at the
expense of resolution, because Behar et al. [54] used
fewer haplogroups in their analysis. Consequently the
number of haplogroups was reduced from 15 in the original version to 14 in this revised version. I would have
been happier if the available data on the Jewish populations had enabled greater resolution to reliably detect
male genetic sub-structure within the Middle East, but
since this work deals with the genetic affinities of EEJ,
the current level is sufficient. The work of Behar et al.
from 2008 was instrumental in creating the mtDNA
matrix as can be seen in table 7 in Additional file 1.
There was no need to cite it previously, as it did not
contain any genetic distance analysis that could further
clarify the origin of EEJ. I am surprised at Dr Ayub’s
surprise at the use of a single X chromosomal locus. It
would have been better to use many X chromosomal
loci, but even the use of single loci is advantageous, as I
am sure even Dr Ayub would agree regarding the two

Zoossmann-Diskin Biology Direct 2010, 5:57
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/57

other single loci that I use, the non-recombining Y
chromosome (NRY) and mtDNA.
As written in the Discussion the genetic distance
matrices of Atzmon et al. [53] and Behar et al. [54] do
not contradict my results, but reinforce them. I completely reject Dr Ayub’s claim that the markers or populations I used are biased in anyway, and I let the reader
judge, where exactly the bias lies.
