Abstract
Background: Despite a large agreement between ribosomal RNA and concatenated protein
phylogenies, the phylogenetic tree of the bacterial domain remains uncertain in its deepest nodes.
For instance, the position of the hyperthermophilic Aquificales is debated, as their commonly
observed position close to Thermotogales may proceed from horizontal gene transfers, long
branch attraction or compositional biases, and may not represent vertical descent. Indeed, another
view, based on the analysis of rare genomic changes, places Aquificales close to epsilonProteobacteria.
Results: To get a whole genome view of Aquifex relationships, all trees containing sequences from
Aquifex in the HOGENOM database were surveyed. This study revealed that Aquifex is most often
found as a neighbour to Thermotogales. Moreover, informational genes, which appeared to be less
often transferred to the Aquifex lineage than non-informational genes, most often placed Aquificales
close to Thermotogales. To ensure these results did not come from long branch attraction or
compositional artefacts, a subset of carefully chosen proteins from a wide range of bacterial species
was selected for further scrutiny. Among these genes, two phylogenetic hypotheses were found to
be significantly more likely than the others: the most likely hypothesis placed Aquificales as a
neighbour to Thermotogales, and the second one with epsilon-Proteobacteria. We characterized
the genes that supported each of these two hypotheses, and found that differences in rates of
evolution or in amino-acid compositions could not explain the presence of two incongruent
phylogenetic signals in the alignment. Instead, evidence for a large Horizontal Gene Transfer
between Aquificales and epsilon-Proteobacteria was found.
Conclusion: Methods based on concatenated informational proteins and methods based on
character cladistics led to different conclusions regarding the position of Aquificales because this
lineage has undergone many horizontal gene transfers. However, if a tree of vertical descent can
be reconstructed for Bacteria, our results suggest Aquificales should be placed close to
Thermotogales.

Background
In the study of evolution, as in any scientific endeavour,
progress relies on the comparison of hypotheses with
respect to how well these succeed in accounting for a
range of observed data. In phylogenetics, a given tree, a
hypothesis, is confronted with trees inferred using other
data; resulting incongruences are then explained by a
methodological artefact, or the inability of a single tree to
properly depict the evolution of the biological entities
under consideration. The large agreement between the
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bacterial phylogeny and phylogenies built from a concatenated set of protein sequences
was therefore a strong piece of evidence that the tree of life
could be solved [1]. For instance, protein phylogenies
confirmed the monophyly of most rRNA-defined bacterial phyla. Similarly, Aquificales are found close to Thermotogales both in trees built from rRNA and from
concatenated proteins. However, the position of the
Aquificales clade within the phylogeny of Bacteria has
often been questioned on the ground of single gene phylogenies, phylogenies built from gene or domain content
[2], and supposedly rare genomic changes such as insertions-deletions [3-8]. Strikingly, many of these analyses
are congruent with each other and suggest that Aquificales
might be more closely related to Proteobacteria than to
Thermotogales. This new view has been adopted in recent
scenarios that explain the whole evolution of life on earth
[9], so it is important to our understanding of bacterial
evolution that the puzzling phylogenetic problem of the
position of Aquificales within the bacterial phylogeny gets
solved.
Species phylogenies built from the comparison of gene
sequences suffer from two major limitations: on one side
the true gene trees may differ from the species trees, and
on the other side, the signal contained in the gene
sequences might be too weak or too complex to be correctly interpreted by bioinformatics methods. Gene trees
will differ from species trees in cases of hidden paralogy,
closely spaced cladogenesis events or horizontal gene
transfers (HGT). This last phenomenon is particularly relevant to the present study, as gene transfers are frequent
among prokaryotes. Phylogeneticists therefore often only
consider informational genes, involved in the processes of
transcription, translation and replication, which appear to
be less prone to HGTs over broad distances than other
genes, named operational [10]. The second limitation,
that of a phylogenetic signal so blurred or buried that tree
reconstruction methods fail to recover the true tree, may
come from a saturated history of mutations (long branch
attraction, [11,12]) or compositional biases [13,14]. Both
pitfalls are likely to affect genes used to reconstruct the
bacterial phylogeny, because Bacteria possibly date as far
back as 3.5 billion years ago [15], and because they display a great diversity in their genomic characteristics as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/272

well as in their ecological niches. More specifically, Aquificales may be placed close to Thermotogales not because
they last diverged from them, but because they share a
common ecological niche, i.e. they are both hyperthermophilic, which led both their rRNA [16] and their protein sequences [17] to adapt to high temperatures.
Sequence similarities between these two clades would
therefore be the result of convergences due to identical
selective pressures, not the result of common descent.
Consequently, recovering the bacterial species tree and
clarifying the relations between hyperthermophilic organisms from comparison of gene sequences is a difficult task,
and has led several authors to search for more reliable
informative characters.
Such characters are cell-structural features, or of a genomic
nature: "rare genomic changes" [18], such as gene fusion/
fission or insertion-deletions (indels), and gene or
domain presence/absence. The main assumption concerning all these characters is that they are nearly immune
to convergence: to be informative, a given character, morphological or genetic, should only arise once. To our
knowledge, this assumption has never been thoroughly
tested. The genomic characters further depend on the
identification of orthologous genes in different genomes,
and consequently are subject to the pitfall of horizontal
gene transfers. Here again, this weakness is of particular
interest to our study, since both Aquificales and Thermotogales seem to be particularly prone to exchanging genes
with other bacterial species [19,20].
Therefore it appears that both approaches – sequence phylogenies and character cladistics – are potentially hindered by defaults whose magnitude is sufficient to
question their conclusions. As in the case of the phylogenetic position of Aquificales their conclusions diverge, a
detailed study might clarify which approach has suffered
most from its drawbacks.
In this report, we used the HOGENOM [21] database to
survey the phylogenetic neighbourhood of Aquifex. This
database contains families of homologous genes from
complete genome sequences with associated sequence
alignments and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees.
The automatic survey of all trees containing sequences
from Aquifex in the HOGENOM database reveals that
Aquifex is most often found as a neighbour to Thermotogales. When genes are separated into informational and
non-informational genes we find that genes from the
former category seem to be less transferred than noninformational ones. To this end, neighbour clades for
each gene from Aquifex were counted, separately for informational genes and for operational genes, yielding two
distributions. Then for each of the two distributions,
Shannon's index of diversity was computed [22]. This

Page 2 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:272

index measures whether the genes are evenly distributed
among all possible neighbourhoods or whether a specific
vicinity dominates. We find that the index value is significantly different between the two distributions: among
informational genes, one neighbourhood, between
Aquificales and Thermotogales, tends to dominate the
distribution much more than in operational genes. This
shows that there is one dominating phylogenetic signal
among informational genes, and much less among operational genes, which is consistent with the idea that operational genes experience more frequent HGT events than
informational genes.
To study the impact of saturation and compositional heterogeneity on the position of Aquificales, we concatenated a large dataset of putatively orthologous proteins
from a wide range of bacterial species (Additional file 1).
A phylogenetic tree was built, and then taken as a reference to test for the position of Aquificales: Aquificales
were first removed from the tree, and then re-introduced
in the topology in all possible positions. Site likelihoods
were computed for all these positions, which allowed for
the identification of sites favouring a given topology. Two
phylogenetic hypotheses were found to be significantly
more likely than the others: the most likely hypothesis
placed Aquificales as a neighbour to Thermotogales, and
the second one placed Aquificales with epsilon-Proteobacteria. We characterized the genes that supported each
hypothesis, and found that differences in rates of evolution or in amino-acid compositions could not explain the
presence of two dominating phylogenetic signals in the
alignment. However, evidence for a large Horizontal Gene
Transfer between Aquificales and epsilon-Proteobacteria
was found. These findings suffice to explain why methods
based on concatenated informational proteins and methods based on character cladistics led to different conclusions, and suggest that the vertical signal in the genomes
of Aquificales, i.e. the portion of the genome most likely
to have been inherited through descent and not through
HGT, relates them to Thermotogales.

Results and discussion
A whole genome view of Aquifex relationships
For each gene tree containing sequences from Aquifex
aeolicus in the HOGENOM database, the identity of the
group of sequences neighbouring Aquifex was recorded.
This gave counts of Aquifex genes found close to Thermotogales, Firmicutes, epsilon-Proteobacteria, among others. Cases where Aquifex genes were found close to a nonmonophyletic group of species were discarded, which left
578 gene trees. Among these, Thermotoga is found as
Aquifex's closest neighbour 98 times, epsilon-Proteobacteria are found 44 times, delta-Proteobacteria 84 times, Firmicutes 71, Thermus-Deinococcus 39, Euryarchaeota 74
(see Fig. 1). In view of such a distribution, it is difficult to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/272

argue in favour of any particular relationship: Horizontal
Gene Transfers appear so pervasive that no signal emerges
as clearly dominant. However, HGTs may not affect all
types of genes with similar frequencies. It has been proposed that genes that are related to the universal processes
of transcription, translation and replication and known as
"informational genes" may be less transferred than "operational genes", involved in metabolism for instance [10].
We therefore separated HOGENOM protein families into
informational and non-informational gene families. Fig.
1a shows that among informational genes, the genes placing Aquifex close to Thermotoga (32 genes) are twice more
numerous than the genes favouring the second best alternative hypothesis, i.e. the vicinity of Firmicutes (15
genes). On the contrary, among operational genes (Fig.
1b), differences between various hypotheses are much
narrower: Thermotoga is Aquifex's neighbour in only two
more cases than delta-Proteobacteria, 11 more cases than
Firmicutes, and 13 more cases than Euryarchaeota. To
quantify this comparison, Shannon's index of diversity
was measured for both sets of genes. This index measures
how evenly distributed observations are among categories
[22]: the higher the index, the more even the distribution;
conversely, the lower the index, the more a few categories
dominate. Shannon index values were 2.07 for informational genes, and 2.49 for operational genes (significantly
different according to a t-test, p-value < 0.001; a Pearson
χ2 test between the two distributions is also significant, pvalue < 10-20), which means that operational genes are significantly more evenly distributed among the various
neighbour groups than informational genes. The distributions depicted in Figs 1a and 1b result from a mixture of
lack of phylogenetic resolution at the single-gene level
and of HGT events. But the difference between them
strongly suggests that operational genes have been horizontally transferred more often than informational genes,
which is consistent with the fact that Euryarchaeota are
almost never found as neighbour to Aquifex in informational genes (2%), but often found in operational genes
(11%). Interestingly, for both sets of genes, epsilon-Proteobacteria are not one of the most frequent Aquifex
neighbours, as they are less frequent than Thermotoga, Firmicutes, and delta-Proteobacteria. For operational genes,
they are even less frequent than Euryarchaeota. These
results thus do not support the hypothesis that Aquificales
are epsilon-Proteobacteria [4]. However, if all Proteobacteria are to be counted as a single clade, the vicinity of
Aquifex with Proteobacteria becomes a high-scoring
hypothesis: Aquifex is most closely related to a Proteobacterium with 18 informational genes and 76 non-informational genes. According to operational genes, if anything,
Aquifex would be a Proteobacterium, as almost twice more
genes place it with Proteobacteria than with Thermotoga
(76 for Proteobacteria against 41 for Thermotoga); accord-

ing to informational genes, Aquifex is close to Thermotoga,
as almost twice more genes place it with Thermotoga than
with Proteobacteria (18 for Proteobacteria against 32 for
Thermotoga). However, considering all Proteobacteria as a
single clade artificially groups a variety of different histories under the same hypothesis. It is thus more likely that
the high frequency of close relationships between Aquifex
and Thermotoga among informational genes reflects vertical descent, and that the scattered distribution of Aquifex
closest homologs among operational genes results from
frequent horizontal transfers to or from the Aquifex lineage.

Furthermore, this whole genome analysis may suffer from
compositional biases or long branch attraction. Consequently, a subset of carefully chosen genes was concatenated and used to assess the importance of potential
artefacts: first a tree of the Bacteria was built, and then,
using this tree as a scaffold, the influence of saturation and
compositional biases on the position of Aquificales was
estimated.
Bacterial phylogeny obtained from a concatenated set of
putatively orthologous genes
Fifty-six genes that were nearly universal in Bacteria and
present as single copy in most genomes were concatenated (see Methods). Genes that showed a transfer
between Bacteria and Archaea had previously been discarded because a gene showing evidence of a transfer
between very distantly related organisms might be especially prone to be transferred among species of the same
domain. Some of the 56 remaining genes may still have
undergone a transfer, and concatenating them may lead to
spurious results. Usually, transferred genes are discarded
before gene concatenation [23,24]. Here, we first checked
for possible tree building biases resulting from composition or evolutionary rate effects before proceeding to an
analysis designed to specifically identify genes that may
have been transferred between Aquificales and other species. PhyML was used to build a starting phylogeny based
on the concatenated protein alignments, using the JTT
model and a gamma law discretized in four classes to
account for variation in the evolutionary rates. The discretized gamma law [25] is widely used because of its mathematical convenience, not as a precise model of the
evolutionary rates of protein sequences. Therefore it is
expected that some sites are not properly modelled when
this approximation is made. To estimate how sites were
modelled by the discretized gamma law, we plotted the
distribution of expected relative evolutionary rates across
sites (Fig. 2) as found by BppML. This distribution shows
four peaks, each corresponding to the rate of a particular
class. The two largest peaks are at the limits of the distribution: they comprise both sites whose rate is properly
approximated by one of the two extreme evolutionary

rates, but also sites whose rate would be smaller or larger,
if the discretized gamma law was able to provide a convenient rate. For instance, the leftmost peak contains sites
properly modelled by a relative rate of ~0.2, but also sites
evolving more slowly, such as constant sites. Per se,
improperly modelling constant sites probably does not
lead to biased phylogenetic estimations; however underestimating the evolutionary rate of some fast-evolving
sites (and this may be a by-product of improper modelling of constant sites) will lead to an underestimation of
the convergence probability. Such misspecified modelling
is therefore a potential cause for long branch attraction, as
underlined in another context [26]. We consequently
decided to conservatively discard sites whose evolutionary
rate was above the arbitrary threshold of 2.2 (red line,
Fig.2), in the hope of reducing risks of reconstruction artefacts. The resulting alignment contains 10,000 sites, and
has been submitted to an additional reconstruction
through PhyML, with a bootstrap analysis based upon
200 replicates.
Our tree comprises 94 bacterial species, spanning as
exhaustively as currently possible the diversity of Bacteria
(Fig. 3). The resulting topology is in good agreement with
rRNA trees [27], recently published concatenated-protein
phylogenies [28,29], as well as supertree phylogenies
[30]. In particular, we do recover the clade named "Terrabacteria" by Battistuzzi and co-workers, as well as the
clade named Gracilicutes by Cavalier-Smith [7], separated
with a high bootstrap support (BS 94%). It is interesting
to note that these three recent bacterial phylogenies all

Unrooted phylogenetic tree of Bacteria
Unrooted phylogenetic tree of Bacteria. This tree was obtained after discarding all sites with evolutionary rate predicted
to be above 2.2. Stars indicate branches with 100% bootstrap support (200 replicates). Bootstrap supports between 80% and
100% are shown, bootstraps below 80% have been removed for clarity. Aquificales are represented in bright red. Names of
major groups are according to the NCBI taxonomy. Gracilicutes and Terrabacteria, two recently proposed superclades, are
shown as dashed frames, and their names are between quotation marks to mark their unconsensual status.

recover these two clades, which suggests that the global
picture of bacterial evolution might be slowly unveiling.
The "PVC supergroup" (Planctomyces-Verrucomicrobia-

Chlamydiales, [31]) seems to find a confirmation in our
phylogeny where Planctomycetes and Chlamydiales are
grouped with 100% BS. Many similarities are also found

Page 6 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:272

with the phylogeny proposed by Ciccarelli and co-workers
[32], or the supertree obtained by Beiko, Harlow and
Ragan [33], such as the monophyly of Proteobacteria, and
the grouping of Aquificales with Thermotogales.
However, many deep nodes do not obtain high bootstrap
supports. Two avenues might help fully resolve the bacterial phylogeny: further increase the number of phylogenetic markers, and improve the interpretation of the
phylogenetic signal through the development of new
models of evolution. Such models would ideally be able
to deal with compositional heterogeneity, and would
safely handle saturation. As there is no efficient program
with these properties, we have chosen to filter out saturated sites to try and diminish compositional heterogeneity.
We have already attempted to remove the most saturated
sites. To assess the impact of compositional heterogeneity,
we performed Bowker's tests for symmetry in the evolutionary process on the whole alignment [34,35]. Bowker's
test relies on the comparison of two sequences against
each other, therefore 94*93/2 = 4371 tests can be done on
our alignment. Among these 4371 tests, 3826 reject symmetry at the 5% level: though we have made no effort to
alleviate the multiple tests problem, compositional heterogeneity might be an important issue for the reconstruction of bacterial phylogeny. Species that show the most
biased amino-acid usage, i.e. that fail the highest numbers
of Bowker's tests, include first AT-rich species (Buchnera
aphidicola, Borrelia burgdorferi), then GC-rich species (Thermus Thermophilus) and finally hyperthermophilic species
(data not shown). This is in agreement with results based
on a multivariate analysis of proteome composition [36],
where the GC content of the genome was found to be the
major factor influencing amino-acid composition, before
thermophily.
To try and limit the influence of compositional bias, we
recoded the concatenated protein alignment in 4 states
based on the physico-chemical properties of the aminoacids [37]. Such a recoding is expected to reduce the risk
of long branch attraction artefact as well as compositional
bias by decreasing the number of homoplasies. Accordingly, after the recoding, 2818 tests reject symmetry: the
recoding seems to have diminished compositional bias at
least in 1008 cases, but clearly has not permitted to fully
erase heterogeneity. The tree we obtain on the recoded
alignment (Fig. 4) is very similar to the previous tree (Fig.
3), with Gracilicutes separated from Terrabacteria (BS
76%). Interestingly, Aquificales are still found as a sister
group of Thermotogales with a high bootstrap support
(96%), and Thermus-Deinococcus also clusters with these
hyperthermophilic organisms, although the bootstrap
support is negligible (36%). The grouping of the photo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/272

synthetic lineages Chloroflexi and Cyanobacteria gains
support through the recoding, with a BS of 85% on the
recoded alignment against 77% on the original alignment. So does the clustering of these two photosynthetic
lineages with another lineage that contains photosynthetic organisms, the Firmicutes: from 63% on the original alignment, the BS increases to 73% with the recoded
alignment. The grouping of these three photosynthetic
lineages appears as an appealing hypothesis, but certainly
requires further inquiry, especially since horizontal gene
transfers are thought to have been part of the evolution of
photosynthesis [38]. Strikingly, Spirochaetes were found
to group with Chlamydiales, Planctomycetes and Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi with a high bootstrap support (83%) on
the original alignment, but grouped with epsilon-Proteobacteria on the recoded alignment (bootstrap support:
18%), which shows that recoding can impact tree reconstruction. Overall, the average bootstrap support is 87.1%,
not significantly lower than the average support for the
original alignment (90.3%, p-value = 0.065 with a Student paired t-test, p-value = 0.154 with a Wilcoxon signed
rank test). This supports the conclusion of Susko and
Roger [39] that recoding does not lead to a substantial loss
of information.
As the trees obtained on the recoded and original alignments are in strong agreement, we conclude that we
obtain a fairly robust Bacterial tree, and that the clustering
of Aquificales and Thermotogales does not seem due to
saturation or compositional artefacts. However, since
more than 50% of Bowker's tests reject symmetry on the
recoded alignment, considerable compositional heterogeneity has escaped the 4-state recoding, and this analysis
cannot entirely rule out the hypothesis that Aquificales
and Thermotogales are attracted by compositional biases.
Nonetheless, the addition to the concatenated alignment
of sequences from two free-living epsilon-Proteobacteria,
Sulfurovum NBC37-1 and thermophilic Nitratiruptor
SB155-2 [40], does not affect this grouping either (see
additional file 2). Thus the Aquificales-Thermotogales
grouping does not seem to result from compositional
biases.
Does the Thermotogales-Aquificales cluster come from a
reconstruction artefact?
The topology that is found without Aquificales using
PhyML with the same parameters is perfectly congruent
with the tree obtained with Aquificales. Taking therefore
as reference the tree without Aquificales, we tested all possible positions for this group in the bacterial tree. The
most likely position was as found by the tree search heuristics, with Thermotogales. The second most likely position was very close, at the base of a clade comprising both
Thermotogales and Fusobacterium, and the third most

placement not rejected at the 5% level according to an AU
test [41] as implemented in Consel [42] (p-value = 0.062).
Because the AU test is based on a multiscale RELL bootstrap procedure, the fact that the second most likely
hypothesis is rejected by the AU test at 5% while the third
is not suggests that sites of high likelihood scores are the
same in the two first hypotheses, but are different from
the sites of high likelihood scores in the third hypothesis.
Consequently two contrasting signals can be found in the
data, coming from different sites in the alignment, that
support the two currently prevailing phylogenetic hypotheses for Aquificales, one based on rRNA trees, and the
other heralded by Cavalier-Smith [4]. We decided to further analyse the nature of the signal that favoured each of
these two placements, through a gene-wise analysis.

= 0.61), there is no evidence that the T signal is coming
from compositional artefacts.

We built phylogenetic trees for each of our 56 genes with
PhyML. Among these 56 trees, 11 place Aquificales close
to Thermotogales (T genes), and only two place Aquificales close to epsilon-Proteobacteria (E genes). We compared these two sets of genes, with respect to rates of
evolution and amino-acid composition, to see whether
one signal is the result of a long branch attraction or of a
compositional bias.

Detection of Horizontal Gene Transfers in the
concatenate
We used the 181 possible Aquificales positions whose
likelihoods had been computed earlier to search for evidence of HGTs affecting Aquificales genes. Because the
taxonomic sampling was as exhaustive as currently possible, and because all possible positions for Aquificales
among Bacteria have been tried, it is expected that few
HGTs affecting Aquificales might escape this screening.

First, we computed the sum of the branch lengths for each
tree in our two datasets, and computed an average branch
length for each dataset. The average branch length was
0.163 for T genes, and 0.131 for E genes, which is not significantly different according to an unpaired t-test (pvalue: 0.145). The discrepancy between the two datasets
does not seem to be explainable by a long branch attraction artefact.
Second, the position close to Thermotogales might be
favoured because of convergences instead of common
descent: as written above, both Thermotogales and Aquificales are hyperthermophilic organisms, so their sequences
are subject to partly similar selective pressures. Through
the analysis of many completely sequenced genomes, Zeldovich and co-workers [17] have found a positive correlation between the proteome content in amino acids
IVYWREL and the organism optimal growth temperature.
As hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea are not monophyletic, this suggests that there exists a selective pressure
to increase the IVYWREL content in organisms that thrive
best at high temperatures. If we find a higher proportion
of the amino-acids IVYWREL in the Aquificales sequences
for T genes than for E genes, this would imply that composition biases could be at the origin of the signal favouring the Thermotogales placement. We find that T genes in
Aquifex aeolicus and Sulfurihydrogenibium azorense contain
45,4% of IVYWREL amino-acids, against 44.4% for E
genes. As the difference is not significant (χ2 test, p-value

Consequently it appears that neither the signal favouring
a close relationship between Aquificales and epsilon-Proteobacteria nor the signal favouring a close relationship
between Aquificales and Thermotogales seem induced by
a reconstruction artefact, namely long branch attraction or
compositional convergence. Similarly, this suggests that
the trees placing Aquificales close to Thermotogales in the
whole genome study may not come from long branch
attraction or compositional artefacts. Therefore, incongruences found between the T and E groups of genes probably unveil different gene histories: at least one of these two
prevailing signals comes from HGTs.

Naturally, some genes from other Bacteria present in the
dataset also underwent transfers that will not be detected
using our approach. But neglecting such transfers should
not affect our results, since the focus of this study is the
position of Aquificales,.
The top curve of Fig. 5 shows the cumulative sum of the
log-likelihood differences between the tree in which
Aquificales are close to epsilon-Proteobacteria and the
tree in which Aquificales are close to Thermotogales. If
asked to divide this curve, one would probably cut it in
two parts, the first one decreasing, and the second one
increasing. This would plead for two signals, first one in
favour of the Thermotogales position, and then one in
favour of the epsilon-Proteobacterial position. However,
this division would be based on the comparison of only
two trees, whereas 181 different positions should be compared.
We used the Maximum Predictive Partitioning (MPP)
algorithm to find what are the two prevailing signals in
the alignment among all 181 compared positions [43].
This algorithm identifies the best way of dividing the data
in two parts and assigning each to a specific tree position.
The results are displayed in the bottom panel of Fig. 5. The
MPP algorithm divides the alignment very close to the site
in which the curve changes from descending to ascending
trends. The most likely positions affected to each of the
two parts, among all 181 possible positions, are first the

Comparison between site likelihoods when Aquificales are placed close to Epsilon-proteobacteria and when
they are placed with Thermotogales. Upper panel: summed differences between site log-likelihoods obtained when
Aquificales are placed with epsilon-Proteobacteria and when they are placed with Thermotogales. A descending trend means
that a consecutive series of sites favours the Thermotogales position (T signal), whereas an ascending trend means that a series
of sites favours the epsilon-proteobacterial position (E signal). Genes have been ordered according to their position along the
Aquifex genome. Dashed blue lines represent gene boundaries. The red interval represents the genes which appear to contain
most of the E signal. The green interval represents gene infB, in which the curve first decreases and then increases. Lower

tree in which Aquificales are close to Thermotogales, and
second the tree in which Aquificales are close to epsilonProteobacteria. Therefore, the two dominant signals in the
alignment are T and E signals. Furthermore, the sequence
concatenate was built following the gene order in the
Aquifex aeolicus genome. Consequently, the fact that series
of consecutive sites support the same phylogenetic position for Aquifex means that whole genes plead for each
hypothesis.
The issue now is to decide which of these two dominant
signals is most likely HGT, and which has the highest
chance of coming from vertical inheritance. One can rely
on the Aquifex aeolicus genomic map to find the solution:
if a hypothesis is favoured by an isolated island that concentrates a few genes, it is likely to be the signature of a
large horizontal transfer affecting a unique region of the
genome. Contrary to the T signal, the signal that favours a
close relationship between Aquificales and epsilon-Proteobacteria is limited to a few clustered genes, mainly consisting of the rplL-rpoB-rpoC operon (characterized in E.

coli, [44,45]), which seems conserved in most bacterial
genomes. This clustering strongly suggests that the epsilon-proteobacterial signal comes from horizontally transferred genes, through a single transfer of the whole rplLrpoB-rpoC operon, from epsilon-Proteobacteria to Aquificales. Indeed, if only these three genes are concatenated
and submitted to phylogenetic analysis, Aquificales are
found clustered with epsilon-Proteobacteria with a fairly
high bootstrap support (79%, Fig. 6). As these transferred
genes are large, they contribute a substantial amount of
signal in the complete concatenate. This large transfer
appears unexpected, since it concerns informational
genes, involved in translation (rplL) and transcription
(rpoB-rpoC), but it has already been suggested by Iyer,
Koonin and Aravind [46]; the alternative hypothesis of
the E signal being the real phylogenetic signal would
require repeated HGTs of 11 genes between Thermotogales and Aquificales along all the Aquifex genome (Table
1), or a very large HGT of 11 genes, subsequently scattered
along the Aquifex genome. Both explanations seem more
unlikely. Consequently, we favour the hypothesis of a sinPage 10 of 18

Such a hypothesis is relevant to the relative dating of
Aquificales and epsilon-Proteobacteria: a transfer from an
ancestor of epsilon-Proteobacteria to an ancestor of
Aquifex aeolicus and Sulfurihydrogenibium azorense implies
that these ancestors are contemporary. Although in trees
of life obtained from rRNAs or concatenated proteins and
rooted between Bacteria and Archaea-Eukaryota Aquificales are found very close to the root of Bacteria, the divergence between Aquifex and Sulfurihydrogenibium should

A gene-by-gene analysis adds support to the hypothesis
that the dominating signal places Aquificales whith Thermotogales. Table 1 shows that, among the 39 gene phylogenies that can be unambiguously interpreted, 11 place
Aquificales with Thermotogales while only 2 (RpoB and
RpoC) place Aquificales with epsilon-Proteobacteria. The
phylogeny of rplL is difficult to interpret, with Aquificales
placed close to Delta-proteobacteria and epsilon-Proteobacteria, which might be due to the short length of this

gene (139 sites). Strikingly, 13 genes place Aquificales
with Gracilicutes, either close to Planctomycetes, to Spirochaetes, to Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi or to Proteobacteria. A
single dominant pattern does not emerge from these gene
trees: therefore they do not argue in favour of a specific
relationship between Aquificales and a particular group of
Gracilicutes. These results rather suggest either uncertainties in phylogenetic reconstruction or repeated horizontal
gene transfers between Aquificales and various Gracilicute
donors.
In conclusion, the epsilon-proteobacterial signal in the
concatenated carefully chosen proteins probably derives
from horizontally transferred informational genes, and
the Thermotogal signal might be the signal of vertical
descent. This conclusion is perfectly congruent with the
results from the whole genome analysis. However, the
epsilon-Proteobacterial vicinity hypothesis was originally
based upon rare genomic changes. How can this hypothesis be reconciled with our conclusions?
The impact of horizontal gene transfers on rare genomic
changes
The prevailing cladistic study arguing that Aquificales
should be placed as a neighbour to Proteobacteria was
performed by Griffiths and Gupta [6], where inserts in 4
genes were found to support this hypothesis. These 4
genes are rpoB, rpoC, alanyl-tRNA synthetase and inorganic pyrophosphatase.

Interestingly, two of these four genes, rpoB and rpoC, are
included in our concatenated alignment. Because they are
clustered in the Aquifex aeolicus genome and display the
same non-mainstream phylogenetic signal, we have diagnosed them as resulting from HGT from epsilon-Proteobacteria. Therefore, the two large inserts that Griffiths and
Gupta found are no proof of a particular relatedness but
rather of a HGT.
The alanyl-tRNA synthetase has not been included in our
concatenate because tRNA synthetase genes are known to
be extremely prone to HGT [47]. The analysis of the alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene family of the HOGENOM database (family HBG008973), confirms that this gene might
not be a good phylogenetic marker. In the tree built from
this family with PhyML, Aquifex aeolicus is found close to
the spirochaete Leptospira, together close to Clostridiales,
the Planctomycete Rhodopirellula baltica is found as a
neighbour to Deinococcales (data not shown), among
other oddities. All these relations are inconsistent with the
tree built from the concatenate and inconsistent with current ideas about bacterial taxonomy. Therefore, using the
alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene family to resolve bacterial
phylogeny appears inadequate.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/272

Finally, the inorganic pyrophosphatase tree as retrieved
from HOGENOM (family HBG000457) shows Aquifex
aeolicus inside Proteobacteria, close to Alpha-proteobacteria, which are not monophyletic. It appears that this gene
family has undergone a duplication (Cyanobacteria are
represented twice in the tree in widely separated positions) as well as horizontal gene transfers (Archaea are
clustered in two groups widely separated in the tree, as
well as Chlamydiales). Overall, the history of inorganic
pyrophosphatase is probably too complex to be used as a
marker of species relationships.
Consequently, the rare genomic changes that were used to
argue for a specific relatedness between Aquificales and
Proteobacteria most likely come from HGT between these
two clades, as already observed in the above analyses (Fig.
1 for instance).
The fact that the outer membrane of Aquifex closely resembles the outer membrane of other Proteobacteria was also
used [4] to argue that Aquificales are more closely related
to Proteobacteria than to Thermotogales. It is unclear why
this character would be particularly immune to HGT; the
outer membrane most likely possesses a strong adaptive
value, so that the transfer of the operational genes coding
for such a structure could be positively selected and rise to
fixation in a species. Given the very high rate of HGT seen
in Aquifex genome, it is not unreasonable to assume that
the proteobacterial type of outer membrane might have
been transferred to Aquificales. Similarly, the close relationship found between epsilon-Proteobacteria and
Aquificales in trees based on cytochromes b and c might
also come from a HGT of a whole operon, as concluded
by Schutz et al. [48]. On the contrary, our counting analysis confirms that informational genes are less prone to
HGT than operational genes, and their signal clusters
Aquificales and Thermotogales.
Further difficulties to resolve the tree of Bacteria
A possible approach to uncover a putative species tree of
Bacteria, or at least a tree for a core set of bacterial genes,
would be to remove transferred genes from a dataset, concatenate all genes that have not been detected as having
been transferred, and use them to build a phylogenetic
tree. Such an approach would be expected to yield better
trees, with higher bootstrap supports. However, the phylogeny obtained on the concatenate in the same conditions as before (without recoding) but after removal of the
rplL-rpoB-rpoC genes does not show a significantly better
support for most of its nodes than the phylogeny shown
in Fig. 3 (average bootstrap support for the tree without
the three genes, 90.9, and for the tree with all genes, 90.3;
p-value = 0.17 with a Student paired t-test, p-value = 0.288
with a Wilcoxon signed rank test). This is probably due to
the fact that bootstrap supports increase with the number

Page 13 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:272

of characters; the length parameter therefore counters the
expected positive effect associated with the removal of discordant signal. Topologically, both trees are highly congruent, with the main noticeable difference being the
placement of Fusobacterium nucleatum, which leaves its
position as sister-group to Thermotogales and Aquificales
in Fig. 3 to nest inside the Firmicutes as a sister group to
Mycoplasma. This placement might stem from a long
branch attraction, as both Mycoplasma and Fusobacterium
have long terminal branches, or alternatively might reveal
the true history of Fusobacterium nucleatum, as suggested
by Mira and co-workers [49]. Certainly this organism
deserves further study, possibly with techniques such as
those that were used in this article.
It is interesting to note that the removal of genes thought
to have been transferred has not improved the phylogeny.
A most promising avenue for further research in deep phylogenies would probably involve the development of
models explicitly taking into account HGT, as proposed
by Suchard [50] or, in other contexts, by Edwards, Liu and
Pearl [51,52] and Ané et al. [53]. HGTs should be modelled as a genuine biological phenomenon on equal footing with vertical descent to represent the evolution of
bacterial genomes. The resulting species tree would correspond to the history of those genome parts that have been
vertically inherited at any time during evolution. The vertically inherited portions of a genome at a given time need
not be vertically inherited at all time, so that a species tree
could be inferred as long as, at any time, some vertical signal could be recovered.
Another additional difficulty might be that the gene is not
necessarily the atomic unit of transfer: transfers may affect
only parts of a gene, through recombination. In this
respect, the analysis of Figure 5 reveals a striking pattern
in the Initiation Factor 2 gene (infB, green line). In this
large gene (the Aquifex aeolicus protein is 805 amino-acids
long), the curve of the difference in log-likelihoods
between the epsilon-proteobacterial and the thermotogal
positions of Aquificales first decreases for about half its
length, and then increases. This pattern is suggestive of a
recombination event inside the gene.
To test for recombination, we divided the infB alignment
in two at the point where this curve changes trend and
built phylogenetic trees for both partial alignments (Fig.
7). In the first resulting tree, Aquificales plus Fusobacterium
nucleatum make together a sister group to Thermotogales
plus Deinococcus/Thermus. In the second tree, Aquificales
are a sister group to a subclade of Firmicutes. These two
branchings are consistent with the slope of the curve of
Fig. 5, first descending, as Aquificales are close to Thermotogales, and then ascending, as Aquificales are far from
Thermotogales. To assess whether the differences in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/272

topologies were significant, Consel was used [42] on these
last two trees. The first part of the alignment strongly
rejected the tree obtained for the second part (AU test pvalue: 4.10-36; SH and KH p-value: 0), and vice versa (AU
test p-value: 1.10-06; SH and KH p-value: 0). Therefore a
strong signal for recombination within the gene infB is
found, possibly between Firmicutes and Aquificales.
This indicates that the unit of transfer between Bacteria is
not necessarily the gene, but can also be parts of a gene.
Models aiming at resolving the bacterial tree may need to
take this additional complexity into account.

Conclusion
Overall, the signal in favour of a close relationship
between Aquificales and epsilon-Proteobacteria has been
shown to be coming from a lateral transfer and not vertically inherited, both in protein phylogenies and in cladistic analyses. A large HGT involving three consecutive
genes encoding two RNA polymerase subunits and a
ribosomal protein has been detected. This large gene
transfer between epsilon-Proteobacteria and Aquificales
can be understood in terms of a shared ecological niche:
some epsilon-Proteobacteria are indeed found in hyperthermophilic environments [54].
The present single-gene analyses suggested that gene
transfers may have frequently occurred between Aquificales and various Gracilicutes and Proteobacteria in particular, which explains why cladistic analyses of rare
genomic changes or of domain contents often place
Aquifex inside Gracilicutes.
Bacterial phylogeny is crucial to understand the evolution
of the biosphere, as it provides a backbone permitting to
integrate the evolution of life as revealed from molecular
phylogenies with the history of the earth, as dug up by
geology. There is no doubt that HGT has played a major
role in the evolution of Prokaryotes, to the point that
there might be no gene that has never undergone HGT;
however a few gene families may have seldom been transferred, and they might bear sufficient signal to unveil the
vertical history of the genome, provided powerful computational methods modelling both gene transfers and intragenic recombination are developed.
Nonetheless, because Aquificales are often found grouped
with Thermotogales, and because this phylogenetic signal
does not seem to result from known artefacts such as long
branch attraction or compositional bias, if there is a species tree in Bacteria, Aquificales are to be considered as a
sister group to Thermotogales. This clarification does not
dramatically affect the scenario for the evolution of life
proposed by Cavalier-Smith [9], except that Aquificales
diverged earlier than proposed. However the present

results question the methodology used to build this scenario because the rare genomic changes method requires
that HGT does not affect used marker genes. In the case of
the Aquificales, we have shown that this requirement is
not fulfilled.

Methods
Whole phylome analysis
In order to get a whole genome view of Aquificales phylogenetic relationships, we queried the HOGENOM database (release 03, October 2005) using the TreePattern
program in FamFetch [55]. HOGENOM is a database that
clusters sequences from whole genomes into homologous
gene families, and builds trees based on these families
with PhyML using a gamma law with 4 classes of substitution rates, with estimated alpha parameter and proportion
of invariable sites. Trees corresponding to all 892 families
in which there was a sequence from Aquifex aeolicus were
automatically analysed, and each sequence from Aquifex

was classified according to what group of species appeared
as its closest neighbour, not taking into account branch
support or branch length. This gave counts of Aquifex
genes found close to Thermotogales, Firmicutes, epsilonProteobacteria, etc... Cases where Aquifex genes were
found close to a non-monophyletic group of species were
discarded, which left 578 gene trees. These counts were
further classified into two functional categories, "informational genes" and "non-informational genes", through
TIGRFAM annotations [56]. A functional category could
be determined for 351 families. "Informational genes"
were genes classified in TIGRFAMs whose function was
part of "Transcription", "DNA metabolism", "Protein synthesis"; "non-informational genes" were those whose role
was part of other major functional classes.
Concatenate assembly
Nearly universal gene families which had only one copy
per genome were used to minimize problems of ill-

defined orthology. Consequently, gene families from the
HOGENOM database of families of homologous genes
(release 03, October 2005) that displayed a wide species
coverage with no or very low redundancy in all species
were selected. This provided 70 gene families. Sequences
from representative genomes from Archaea were retrieved
from these families, and sequences from genomes not
present in the release 03 of HOGENOM but whose phylogenetic position was interesting were included in the
families. These studied genomes are listed in Additional
files 1, 2 and 3 and were downloaded from the Joint
Genome Institute [57], The Institute for Genomic
Research [58] or the National Center for Biotechnology
Information [59], and were searched for homologous
genes using BLAST [60]; only the best hit was retrieved.
The gene families were subsequently aligned using MUSCLE v3.52 [61] and submitted to a phylogenetic analysis
using the NJ algorithm [62] with Poisson distances as
implemented in Phylo_Win [63]. During this step, families in which there seemed to be a gene transfer between a
bacterial species and Archaea were discarded, as well as
amino-acid synthetases, which are known to be prone to
HGT [47]. In the rare families where there were two
sequences from the same species, the sequence showing
the largest terminal branch length or whose position was
most at odds with the NCBI classification was discarded.
This whole process provided 56 gene families and 94 bacterial species. Only bacterial sequences were used in the
rest of the study, because our focus is on the bacterial phylogeny itself. The 56 families were submitted to Gblocks
[64] to discard parts of the alignments that were unreliable, but using a non-stringent site selection, because the
subsequent analyses should permit to sort biased from
genuine signal. Consequently, the following Gblocks
parameters were used: the minimum numbers of
sequences used to define a conserved or a flanking position were set at 50% of the total number of sequences, the
minimum length of a block was set at 2 sites, and all positions could be kept by the algorithm, even if they contained gaps. The resulting alignments were then
concatenated using ScaFos [65], following the order of
genes along the Aquifex aeolicus genome. The amount of
missing data was low, reaching 21% at its maximum in
Thermotoga petrophila.
Phylogenetic analyses
A phylogenetic tree was built from the concatenate under
the Maximum Likelihood criterion using PhyML v.2.4.4
[66] with the JTT model [67], and a discretized gamma
law with 4 categories to model evolutionary rate variation.
This first tree was used to compute site-specific evolutionary rates using BppML from the Bio++ package [68],
which allowed for the removal of saturated sites. A new
tree was built using this refined alignment, with the same
parameters plus an estimated proportion of invariant sites

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/272

and with a non-parametric bootstrap analysis (200 replicates), and was used as a reference for the rest of the work.
An estimated proportion of invariant sites was not used in
the previous analysis because it had not been implemented in the used version of Bio++. Noticeably, the
topology was found to be unchanged when Aquificales
were removed from the alignment and the tree re-computed. Similarly, the topology was nearly identical when
two free-living espsilon-Proteobacteria (Sulfurovum
NBC37-1 and thermophilic Nitratiruptor SB155-2 [40],)
were added, and the tree recomputed with PhyML v3.0;
for this tree, the minimum of SH-like and chi2-based support was computed instead of bootstrap support [69]. An
additional test was performed to assess the impact of compositional heterogeneity as well as saturation: the alignment without saturated sites was recoded in 4 categories
[70,37]. In this recoding, aromatic (FWY) and hydrophobic (MILV) amino-acids were grouped in a single state,
basic amino-acids (HKR) in another, acidic (DENQ)
amino acids in one more state, and the fourth state contained all other amino acids (AGPST) to the exception of
cysteine which was coded as missing data. The recoded
alignment was subjected to a phylogenetic analysis with
the GTR model [71], an estimated proportion of invariant
sites, a gamma law discretized in 8 categories with its
alpha parameter estimated, and 200 bootstrap replicates.
The tree without the Aquificales was used as a scaffold
upon which all possible Aquificales positions were tried
in turn. The likelihoods for each of these positions were
computed using BppML from the Bio++ package. Evolutionary rates per site as well as likelihoods per site were
simultaneously inferred. Site evolutionary rates were
obtained by computing the average of the gamma law rate
categories weighted by their posterior probabilities.
The tree containing only the rplL-rpoB-rpoC genes was
obtained with PhyML as described above and with a nonparametric bootstrap analysis based upon 500 replicates.
Individual gene trees were built using PhyML with the
same parameters as above except that the gamma law was
discretized in 8 categories.
Concatenate segmentation and HGT identification
We wanted to know which was the most likely segmentation in two segments of the alignment according to site
likelihoods for all topologies. It was computed using Sarment [72] with the Maximum Predictive Partitioning
algorithm [43]. This algorithm was input a matrix containing the site log-likelihoods for all 181 topologies
tested (obtained by placing the Aquificales in all possible
positions in the backbone bacterial phylogeny) and for
the whole alignment. The best log-likelihood of a given
segmentation is the sum of the best log-likelihoods of its

Page 16 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:272

segments, that are computed as follows: on a segment, for
each of the 181 topologies tested, the log-likelihood of a
topology is the sum of all site log-likelihoods on the alignment. This procedure produces 181 log-likelihoods, the
maximum of which is the best log-likelihood of this segment. Once this maximum is found, it clearly associates a
most likely topology to each segment of the alignment. All
statistical analyses were done with the seqinR package
[73] in R [74].
