Chromosomal evolution in the plant family
Solanaceae
Feinan Wu1, Steven D Tanksley1,2*

Abstract
Background: Over the past decades, extensive comparative mapping research has been performed in the plant
family Solanaceae. The recent identification of a large set of single-copy conserved orthologous (COSII) markers has
greatly accelerated comparative mapping studies among major solanaceous species including tomato, potato,
eggplant, pepper and diploid Nicotiana species (as well as tetraploid tobacco). The large amount of comparative
data now available for these species provides the opportunity to describe the overall patterns of chromosomal
evolution in this important plant family. The results of this investigation are described herein.
Results: We combined data from multiple COSII studies, and other comparative mapping studies performed in
tomato, potato, eggplant, pepper and diploid Nicotiana species, to deduce the features and outcomes of
chromosomal evolution in the Solanaceae over the past 30 million years. This includes estimating the rates and
timing of chromosomal changes (inversions and translocations) as well as deducing the age of ancestral progenitor
species and predicting their genome configurations.
Conclusions: The Solanaceae has experienced chromosomal changes at a modest rate compared with other
families and the rates are likely conserved across different lineages of the family. Chromosomal inversions occur at
a consistently higher rate than do translocations. Further, we find evidences for non-random positioning of the
chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints. This finding is consistent with the similar finding in mammals, where hot
spots for chromosomal breakages have apparently played a significant role in shaping genome evolution. Finally,
by utilizing multiple genome comparisons we were able to reconstruct the most likely genome configuration for a
number of now-extinct progenitor species that gave rise to the extant solanaceous species used in this research.
The results from this study provide the first broad overview of chromosomal evolution in the family Solanaceae,
and one of the most detailed thus far for any family of plants.

Background
The Solanaceae is a large plant family comprised of over
3000 species including many important crops such as
tomato, potato, eggplant, and pepper. It represents a
group of dicotyledonous plants in the Euasterid clade,
which is divergent from the model plant Arabidopsis
[1,2]. It is the third economically important plant family
and ranks the first in terms of vegetable crops. The
related family Rubiaceae contains coffee: one of the
most valuable agricultural commodities in the international trade. Unlike some other plant families (e.g. Poaceae and Brassicaceae), the Solanaceae and the
Rubiaceae have evolved largely in the absence of

polyploidization [3]. For instance, tomato, eggplant and
pepper have the same basic chromosome number (2n =
24) and share similar chromosome architecture with
pericentric heterochromatin and more distal euchromatic arms. Cultivated potato and tobacco are tetraploid
but the events occurred relatively recently and many
diploid species can still be found in the wild. Coffee also
has a similar chromosome architecture and DNA content, and has a chromosome number of 2n = 22. As a
result, the Solanaceae and related taxa present a unique
opportunity to study genome/gene evolution in the
absence of recent polyploidization events.
In the past two decades, extensive pairwise comparative mapping studies have been performed for several
major solanaceous crops relative to tomato [4-8]. However, no comparisons of multiple species have been

conducted to decipher the overall patterns of chromosomal evolution in this family. Recently, Wu et al [3]
developed a set of 2869 single-copy conserved ortholog
set (COSII) markers of which 877 have been mapped in
the tomato genome http://sgn.cornell.edu/cview/map.pl?
map_id=9&show_offsets=1&show_ruler=1. Subsequently,
COSII genetic maps have been constructed for eggplant,
pepper and two diploid Nicotiana species, and pairwise
comparisons have been reported between each species
and tomato [9-11]. Potato, a close taxonomic relative of
tomato, was also included in this series of comparisons
[8,12]. These previous comparative mapping studies
have established the syntenic relationships between the
12 tomato chromosomes (T1-12) and those of potato
(Pt1-12), eggplant (E1-12), pepper (P1-12) and Nicotiana
(N1-12). The Nicotiana map used in this work is a
deduced map for the diploid ancestor of N. tomentosiformis and N. acuminata (referred to Nicotiana hereafter) based on comparisons of these two species and
tomato [11]. The deduced map of the ancestral Nicotiana species excludes inversions that occurred subsequent to the divergence of N. tomentosiformis and N.
acuminata.
Previous comparative mapping studies across solanaceous species have revealed that inversions have been the
most common cause of genome rearrangements–with
translocations occurring at a lower frequency. Tomato
and potato differ by 6 inversions [8,12]. Tomato and
eggplant differ by 24 inversions and 5 translocations
[10]. Tomato and pepper differ by 19 inversions and 6
translocations [9]. Tomato and Nicotiana differ by a
minimum of 10 inversions and 11 translocations,
although the number of inversions is likely underestimated due to the large evolutionary distance between
tomato and Nicotiana [11]. In the current study we performed multiple-species comparisons in order to estimate the timing of these chromosomal rearrangement
events, deduce the genome arrangement of the most
recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of these species,
and compare the rates of chromosomal evolution across
different lineages. We also compared these results for
the Solanaceae with similar studies in other plant and
animal families.

Methods
Estimating divergence time for species in the family
Solanaceae

Wu et al [3] published a phylogenetic tree of solanaceous species with strong statistical support (>97%
bootstrap values for all branches) based on concatenated exons of 10 COSII markers. Using the same
dataset and the same method, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree rooted with coffee (The previous root
Arabidopsis was removed because of its large

Page 2 of 11

phylogenetic distance to the other species). Subsequently, we ran the program r8s [13] to estimate the
age of internal nodes by the non-parametric rate
smoothing (NPRS) method, which does not rely on the
assumption of a molecular clock [14]. The calibration
point was tomato-coffee split at 83 ~ 89 million years
ago (MYA), and 86MYA was used for calculation [15].
Additional File 1 presents the complete result from
this analysis and Figure 1 only includes the species
used for the current study.
Comparing the maps of multiple solanaceous species

As a starting point, we utilized previously published
comparisons of tomato and each of the other solanaceous species included in this current study–potato
[8,12], eggplant [10], pepper [9] and Nicotiana [11]. The
tomato genetic map has the largest number of markers,
including all the orthologous markers employed in these
pairwise comparisons [3]; however, different subsets
(although they may share a relatively small number of
common markers) were mapped in each of the other
species being compared–making it difficult to perform
direct comparisons between non-tomato species (potato,
eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana). Using the principle of
parsimony, we applied the following rules to overcome
these difficulties. For any genomic region being compared, if a pair of non-tomato species was determined
to have the same gene order as tomato, we considered
that the pair of non-tomato species also shared the
same gene order with respect to each other in this particular region (Figure 2a). If on the other hand, each of
the non-tomato species differed from tomato by an
inversion corresponding to the same region of the
tomato genome, we considered that the pair of nontomato species had the same gene order and the inversion was derived along the tomato lineage (Figure 2b).
However, in the situation shown in Figure 2c, we considered that species 1 and 2 each had an independent
inversion relative to tomato even though the two
inverted regions overlapped with each other. Lower
breakpoint of the inversion between species 1 and
tomato was located between markers “g” and “h” on the
tomato map while that between species 2 and tomato
was between markers “e” and “g”, in other words, the
two breakpoints were different and therefore they must
have been resulted from two independent events. For
translocations (Figure 2b), if the breakpoint region of
the translocation between species 1 and tomato
(between markers “g” and “i”) overlapped with that
between species 2 and tomato (between markers “h” and
“i”), we considered that the two species possibly shared
the same breakpoint and presumably the breakpoint
region could be narrowed down to the overlapping
region.

Deducing the genome arrangement of ancestral species

We employed the principle of parsimony to deduce the
genome arrangement of three ancestral species–ATPt,
ATE and ATP (see Figure 1 for definition). If tomato
and potato shared the same genome arrangement, they
both likely preserved the arrangement of ATPt. If
tomato and potato differed from each other, the species,
which shared the same arrangement with any of the
more distant species–eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana,
would be considered to preserve the arrangement of
ATPt while the other one had the derived condition.
Using the same method, we compared ATPt and eggplant (together with the more distant species pepper
and Nicotiana) to decide which one or both preserved
the arrangement of ATE, and again we compared ATE
and pepper (together with the more distant species
Nicotiana) to decide which one or both preserved the
arrangement of ATP.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships of the studied solanaceous
species and the estimated age of their most recent
common ancestors (MRCAs)

The phylogenetic relationships of species in the family
Solanaceae have been studied using both plastid and
nuclear sequences [3,16-18]. Among the solanaceous
species included in the current study, tomato, potato
and eggplant belong to the genus Solanum, with tomato
and potato closer to each other than to eggplant. Pepper
is a member of the genus Capsicum. Nicotiana is the
most distant and basal to the other two genera (Figure
1). Molecular dating (Figure 1; see Methods) suggested
7.3MYA for the age of the MRCA of tomato and potato
(referred to as ATPt hereafter), 15.5MYA for that of the
MRCA of tomato, potato and eggplant (ATE), 19.6MYA
for that of the MRCA of tomato, potato, eggplant and
pepper (ATP), and 23.7MYA for that of the MRCA of
tomato, potato, eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana (ATN).
These estimates are similar to those reported from
recent studies [15,19,20].
Inferring the arrangement of MRCA genomes

The tomato genetic map was used as standard in this
work since it shared the most orthologous markers with
the maps of potato, eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana.
After these species diverged from their common ancestors with tomato, numerous translocations have
reshuffled the ancestral 12 chromosomes so that there is
not always a 1:1 correspondence for the orthologous
chromosomes among these species (the only exception
is that the tomato and potato genomes do not differ by
any translocations). To facilitate the following analyses,
we divided the 12 chromosomes in eggplant, pepper and
Nicotiana into segments according to their

Page 4 of 11

translocations relative to tomato (Additional File 2). For
example, eggplant E4 combined segments from tomato
T10 and T4 respectively and thus was divided into segments E4a and E4b (Figure 3).
The first step in the multiple-species comparisons was
to depict the translocations and inversions in potato, eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana with respect to tomato (Figure 4 and Additional File 3). Based on the phylogenetic
relationships among these species and the principle of
parsimony, in most cases it was feasible to determine
along which lineage a rearrangement event occurred and
to deduce the putative genome arrangement of the ancestral genomes (ATPt, ATE and ATP). The genome
arrangement of ATN requires a more distant species (e.g.
coffee in Rubiaceae [21]) to determine and thus will not
be included in the follow-up analyses. Chromosomes of
the ancestral genomes were named 1-12 according to the
tomato orthologs. In the following paragraphs, we will
describe these rearrangements chromosome by chromosome (Figure 4 and Additional File 3).
T1 and its orthologs

T1 and Pt1 share the same gene order and gene content
so that they both represent the ancestral arrangement in
ATPt1. E1 differs from ATPt1 by one inversion, which
is not seen in pepper and Nicotiana, therefore ATE1
has a similar arrangement to ATPt1 and the inversion is
derived in E1. The pepper ortholog is P1b, part of a
large chromosome P1 (P1a is orthologous to T8; also
see “T8 and its orthologs”), which indicates a translocation between pepper and ATE genomes. P1b is further
differentiated from ATE1 by at least two paracentric
and two pericentric inversions. Nonetheless, genome
arrangement of the ancestral ATP1 can only be partly
determined with the more distant Nicotiana. On one
hand, the translocation combining P1b and P1a does
not exist in the Nicotiana genome, suggesting that
translocation is specific to the pepper genome. On the
other hand, the two translocations differentiating Nicotiana from ATP, which produced N11c, N9b and N1a,
has made it difficult to identify whether ATE1 or P1b
shares the same gene order with Nicotiana and thus the
four inversions could have occurred along the lineage of
either ATE or pepper.
T2 and its orthologs

This chromosome is the only one that has not experienced translocations along any of the five lineages. Pt2
and E2 share an inversion relative to T2, therefore Pt2
represents the ancestral arrangement in ATPt2. E2 differs from ATPt2 by two inversions, which are not seen
in P2, therefore ATE2 resembles ATPt2. P2 and ATE2
are differentiated by two inversions. N2 appears to share
the same gene order with T2; however, some inversions
between Nicotiana and tomato may have not been identified because multiple sequential rearrangements after

Figure 3 An example of chromosomal rearrangements between the genomes of eggplant and tomato. The eggplant chromosome E4
combines two segments (E4a and E4b) orthologous to tomato T4 and T10 respectively, indicating a translocation between the two genomes.
The breakpoint is located between markers TG386 and T677 (highlighted in red), and the region is indicated by a black bar beside E4.
Orthologous marker pairs are connected by lines. A dash line indicates a marker of low mapping confidence on either or both maps that is not
used for deduction of inversions. Vertical arrows beside E4 depict inversions in E4 with respect to T10.

their divergence may have greatly shuffled the marker
order. As a result, we cannot ascertain whether ATE2 or
P2 or neither has preserved the ancestral condition.
Therefore in this work we used Nicotiana to time the
translocations but not inversions. Exceptions will be
described case by case.
T3 and its orthologs

T3 agrees with Pt3 in both gene order and gene content
and thus both have preserved the ancestral arrangement
in ATPt3. E3 is differentiated from ATPt3 by at least

two inversions and one translocation that inserted a T5
segment (E3b) between E3a and E3c. These arrangements are not seen in either pepper or Nicotiana, therefore ATE3 likely has a similar structure to ATPt3.
Pepper (P4a and P3c) differs from ATE3 by two inversions and one translocation. Again, the two inversions
cannot be timed with Nicotiana due to the reason
described earlier. The Nicotiana orthologous counterparts are N9c and N3b–a different karyotype (or more

Figure 4 Comparative maps of several solanaceous species and the deduced genome arrangement of MRCAs. T1-12, Pt1-12, E1-12, P112 and N1-12 represent 12 chromosomes of tomato, potato, eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana genomes respectively. Designation of chromosome
segments (a-c) is detailed in Additional File 2. ATPt1-12, ATE1-12 and ATP1-12 represent 12 chromosomes of ATPt, ATE and ATP genomes. White
dots indicate the approximate centromere location of the tomato chromosomes. Maps of the other species are depicted in a comparative way
to the tomato map as follows. A black arrow indicates an inversion relative to tomato (a grey arrow for an uncertain inversion). A black bar
indicates the breakpoint region of a translocation relative to tomato (a grey bar for an uncertain translocation). Two black bars connected by a
curve indicate that the segment in between is excised in a translocation while the remained parts stay together, e.g. E10a is embedded in E3b.
“1+” (or “2+”) on a single arrow indicates that the region has experienced at least one (or two) inversions but the exact number remains to be
determined. Position and length of arrows and bars are approximate. See the close-up figure in Additional File 3.

translocations) from both pepper and ATE3, therefore
Nicotiana is not helpful in timing this translocation
between pepper and ATE3. Nonetheless, the breakpoint
regions in pepper and Nicotiana overlap with each
other, suggesting they may share the same breakpoint.
In other words, the breakpoint may have been reused in
different lineages and at different points in time.

and ATE8 have been well preserved. As described in the
previous section “T1 and its orthologs“, pepper differs
from the above three species by one translocation which
is not seen in Nicotiana, therefore this translocation is
likely derived in the pepper genome and ATP8 resembles ATE8.

T4 and its orthologs

One inversion differentiates T9 from Pt9, E9 and P9a,
suggesting ATPt9 and ATE9 resemble Pt9/E9 and the
gene order in ATP9 is likely the same as that in Pt9/E9.
Pepper (P9a and P3a) has a translocation relative to
ATE9, with the breakpoint likely shared by Nicotiana
(between N7b and N1b), but timing of the translocation
and karyotype of the ATP genome remain to be
determined.

T4 and Pt4 share the same gene order and gene content
and thus both may represent the ancestral arrangement
in ATPt4. E11b has three derived inversions. Pepper
(P5a, P12b and P4b) likely experienced a translocation
that separated P5a from the rest of the chromosome
since the same translocation was not found in Nicotiana.
P5a also differs from ATE4 by an inversion but the timing is unknown. However, distinct karyotypes among
ATPt, eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana make it impossible
to determine which lineage (ATPt, eggplant or pepper)
or none of them has preserved the ancestral karyotype in
ATE and ATP, although the gene order in these chromosome segments may largely be consistent with that of
ATPt4 and the breakpoint may have been reused
(between E11b and E4b and between P12b and P4b).
T5 and its orthologs

Pt5, E3b and P11a share one inversion relative to T5, so
that Pt5 has preserved the arrangement in ATPt5 and
the inversion is derived in T5. Eggplant experienced a
translocation and multiple inversions that resulted in
E3b and E10a; therefore ATE5 has a similar gene order
to ATPt5. Both pepper and Nicotiana differ from ATE5
by one inversion, so that pepper may have preserved the
ancestral gene order in the ATP genome. Eggplant
(between E3b and E5a), pepper (P11a and P5b) and
Nicotiana (N10b and N5a) possibly share the breakpoint
of one translocation relative to ATPt5, but karyotype of
the ATE and ATP genomes cannot be determined.
T6 and its orthologs

Both T6 and Pt6 have preserved the ancestral arrangement in ATPt6. E6 and P6 share one inversion relative
to ATPt6 near top of the chromosome, and E6 and N6b
share another inversion relative to ATPt6 near bottom
of the chromosome. Therefore both ATE6 and ATP6
resemble E6 while two inversions occurred to ATPt6
and one to P6.
T7 and its orthologs

This chromosome is quite conserved. E7 has a derived
inversion, otherwise T7, Pt7, E7 and P7 share the same
gene order and gene content. Therefore, the genome
arrangement in ATPt7, ATE7 and ATP7 resemble that
in T7/Pt7/P7.
T8 and its orthologs

This chromosome is also fairly conserved. T8, Pt8 and
E8 agree with each other in both gene order and gene
content, therefore the genome arrangement in ATPt8

T9 and its orthologs

T10 and its orthologs

This chromosome is conserved among T10, Pt10 and
P10 except for a derived inversion in T10. Therefore
ATPt10, ATE10 and ATP10 have a similar arrangement
to Pt10/P10. Eggplant has a quite different situation in
that it experienced multiple rearrangements including
one translocation and five inversions.
T11 and its orthologs

Pt11 is differentiated from T11 by one inversion, which
is not seen in the other species, so ATPt11 resembles
T11. Eggplant (E11a and E12b) and pepper (P12a and
P11b) share two inversions relative to ATPt11, therefore
the inversions are derived in ATPt11. Pepper has one
additional inversion but its timing cannot be determined. Eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana share the breakpoint of a translocation relative to tomato, but again the
timing of this translocation is unknown.
T12 and its orthologs

T12 has an inversion relative to Pt12 but shares the
same gene order with the pepper orthologous counterparts, therefore T12 has preserved the genome arrangement of ATPt12. Eggplant (E10b, E12a and E5b) and
pepper (P9b, P3b and P12c) each have experienced two
translocations and one inversion relative to ATPt12,
although these rearrangements are independent of each
other. The translocation that produced E12a and the
inversion on E10b are derived in eggplant, so ATE12
has a similar gene order to ATPt12. The translocation
that separated P9b and P3b is derived on pepper. The
inversion between P12c and T12 has an unknown timing. The other two translocations, which separated E10b
and E5b as well as P3b and P12c, share a common
breakpoint with Nicotiana (between N6b and N12b) but
their timing cannot be determined.
Rates of inversion and translocation events across the
Solanaceae

Comparing the genetic maps of tomato, potato, eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana has permitted us, in many

instances, to deduce the genome arrangement of their
MRCAs and to determine in which lineage chromosomal rearrangements occurred. As a result, we present
actual genetic maps of the extant species and deduced
genetic maps of their MRCAs according to their phylogenetic relationships, and depict the possible inversion
and translocation events that occurred leading to each
genome (Figure 5). In summary, since these species
diverged from their last MRCA, four inversions have
occurred along the tomato lineage, two inversions along
the potato lineage, four inversions along the ATPt

lineage, 16 inversions along the eggplant lineage, and at
least one inversion along each of ATE and pepper
lineages as well as 11 undetermined inversions between
these two lineages. The situation for translocations is
more complicated. Since eggplant diverged from ATE, a
T5 segment was inserted into E3, a T12 segment was
inserted into E10, and markers from T10 was translocated to E4 and E10 respectively. Since pepper diverged
from ATP, a non-reciprocal translocation resulted in P1
and P8, a small T4 segment was inserted into P12, and
a small T12 segment was inserted into P3. In addition

Figure 5 Chromosomal evolution in the family Solanaceae. The actual karyotype (chromosome 1-12) of tomato, potato, eggplant, pepper
and Nicotiana, and the deduced karyotype of their MRCAs are presented. Each tomato chromosome is assigned a different color, and the
orthologous counterparts in the other species are painted with the corresponding color, which therefore depicts the translocations
differentiating these species. Black arrows on chromosomes represent the inversions that these species have experienced subsequent to
divergence from their MRCA, i.e. inversions in tomato and potato relative to ATPt, inversions in eggplant and ATPt relative to ATE, and inversions
in ATE and pepper relative to ATP. Position and length of the arrows are approximate (see Additional Files 2 for details). Grey arrows on the
pepper chromosomes represent inversions between pepper and ATE but it remains to be determined along which lineage these inversions
occurred. White dots indicate approximate centromere location of the tomato chromosomes [30] and putative centromere location of the
eggplant and pepper chromosomes based on their synteny with tomato [9,10]. Broken chromosomes in the ATE and ATP genomes represent
unknown karyotypes, in other words, organization of these chromosome segments remains to be determined.

to these events with known timing, chromosomes 4, 5,
11 and 12 have been rearranged by translocations in the
ATPt and/or eggplant genomes after they diverged from
the ATE genome, and chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 9, 11 and
12 have been rearranged by translocations in the ATE
and/or pepper genomes after they diverged from the
ATP genome.
Using the divergence time estimated earlier, we calculated the absolute rates of inversions and translocations
respectively across different lineages (Figure 5). After
divergence from ATPt, the lineages leading to tomato
and potato experienced 0.5 and 0.3 inversions/million
years respectively. After divergence from ATE, the lineage leading to eggplant experienced 1 inversion/million
years and 0.2 ~ 0.4 translocations/million years. After
divergence from ATP, the lineage leading to pepper
experienced 0.1 ~ 0.6 inversions/million years and 0.2 ~
0.4 translocations/million years. These results suggested
a fairly consistent rate of chromosomal rearrangements
across these solanaceous species. One exception is that
the eggplant lineage appears to have experienced a
higher number of inversions. One possible explanation
for this observation is that some inversions between
ATPt and eggplant/pepper cannot be deciphered
between ATPt and pepper due to larger evolutionary
distance and thus the inversions were assigned into the
eggplant lineage. This same factor may also lead to an
underestimate of the inversion number between ATE
and pepper. Nonetheless, these results provide the first
general outline of the chromosomal evolution in the
Solanaceae.

Discussion
Evaluation of the parsimony analyses

Given the phylogenetic relationships of the solanaceous
species included in this study (Figure 1), we performed
parsimony analyses to determine the timing of rearrangement events that differentiate these species. The
results from this study can be used to highlight a number of points. First, multiple distant species are necessary for timing inversions between a pair of sister
species. For example, regarding the inversion between
T5 and Pt5 (Figure 4 and Additional File 3), eggplant
experienced a translocation in this region which moved
some markers to E10 so that it was hard to determine
with either tomato or potato eggplant shared the same
gene order. Nonetheless, pepper showed clear agreement
with potato, thus supporting potato preserved the ancestral condition. Secondly, species with large phylogenetic
distance may not be good for timing inversions. Nicotiana is the most distant from the other species but
appears to differ from tomato by 10 inversions only,
possibly because multiple sequential rearrangements
shuffled the marker order to the extent that individual

Page 9 of 11

inversions can no longer be deciphered [11]. Among
these 10 inversions, only three were shared by the other
species and thus were useful for determining the time of
these events. As a result, we left 11 of the inversions
between ATE and pepper as events with unknown timing. Pepper, in some cases, may also be too distant to
time the inversions between ATPt and eggplant, thus a
higher inversion rate was estimated along the eggplant
lineage, although some of the inversions may actually
have occurred along the ATPt lineage or more anciently
before the divergence of ATPt and eggplant. Thirdly,
more species are in need to decipher the timing of
translocation events. In more than half of the identified
translocations (Figure 5), the species being compared
each have a different karyotype (or organization of chromosome segments after translocations) and thus we
could not assign these events into a specific lineage or
deduce the ancestral chromosome arrangement. One
possible solution is to construct genetic maps and comparative maps of more solanaceous species within the
phylogenetic distance between tomato and Nicotiana.
Possible reuse of chromosomal breakpoints for
independent translocation events

Among all the identified translocations differentiating
the solanaceous species studied, we found that some
events have overlapping breakpoint regions, e.g. the two
independent translocations relative to T3, which produced P4a and P3c for pepper and N9c and N3b for
Nicotiana respectively (Figure 4 and Additional File 3).
However, since resolution of the breakpoint regions is
limited by the density of synteny markers, we cannot
ascertain whether the breakpoints are in the exact same
position. Similar cases were found for the translocation
events relative to T3, T4, T5, T9, T11 and T12 (Figure
4 and Additional File 3). Such phenomenon–reuse of
breakpoints, has been reported as a common phenomenon in mammals [22-25]. Pevzner and Tesler [25]
described mammalian genomes as mosaics of rearrangement hotspots and conserved segments, and proposed a
fragile breakage model which was opposed to the widely
accepted random breakage theory by Nadeau and Taylor
[26]. It was reported that ~20% of breakpoint regions
were reused during mammalian evolution and the sites
were enriched for centromeres [24]. Interestingly and
consistently, five out of the six cases in our finding
(except for the one on T3) also had breakpoints near
the predicted position of the tomato centromere (Figure
4 and Additional File 3).
Comparing rates of chromosomal evolution between
Solanaceae and other plant and animal taxa

Comparing the maps of tomato, potato, eggplant and
pepper genomes provided an opportunity to estimate

Wu and Tanksley BMC Genomics 2010, 11:182
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/182

rates of chromosomal evolution in the Solanaceae,
resulting in an estimate of 0.1 ~ 1 inversions per million
years and 0.2 ~ 0.4 translocations per million years
across different species, in other words, 0.03 ~ 0.12 rearrangements per chromosome per million years. It was
hard to make precise comparisons of this rate and those
from other families due to differences in mapping techniques, map resolutions, criteria to identify rearrangements and methods of estimating divergence time.
Nonetheless, this rate in the Solanaceae is comparable
with that in the plant families Poaceae, Malvaceae and
Brassicaceae as well as many mammals [24,27,28],
although the rate is lower than that reported for some
fast evolving taxa such as the genus Arabidopsis [27,29].
Given the largely constant chromosome number in the
Solanaceae and similar rates of chromosomal evolution
across the solanaceous species studied in this work, we
consider that the Solanaceae has a modest rate of chromosomal evolution and the rate is likely shared by many
solanaceous species.

Conclusions
Comparative genome studies have been performed
widely for solanaceous crops, mostly between pairs of
species. Recently, a large set of single-copy conserved
orthologous (COSII) markers has provided an opportunity to combine data from multiple species and to
describe the overall patterns of chromosomal evolution
for the whole family. In the research described herein, we
have taken advantage of COSII studies in tomato, potato,
eggplant, pepper and diploid Nicotiana species, to deduce
the broad features and outcomes of chromosomal evolution in the Solanaceae over the past 30 million years. The
results reveal a modest and consistent rate (0.03 ~ 0.12
rearrangements per chromosome per million years) of
chromosomal changes across the family, with a higher
frequency of inversions than translocations. We have also
identified hot spots of chromosomal breakages, supporting the notion that chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints are not randomly distributed. Finally we have
reconstructed the most likely genome configuration for
the ancestors of these solanaceous species. This study
thus provides the first broad overview of chromosomal
evolution in the family Solanaceae, and one of the most
detailed thus far for plant families.

[15].

genomes of eggplant, pepper and Nicotiana with respect to the
tomato genome. Genetic maps are modified from published work
[91011] with kind permission from Springer Science+Business Media. E112 represents the 12 eggplant chromosomes, P1-12 for pepper, and N112 for the MRCA of N. tomentosiformis and N. acuminata. Each tomato
chromosome is assigned a different color (see color codes in the figure)
and the orthologous chromosome segment(s) in eggplant, pepper and
Nicotiana are painted with the same color. Putative centromere positions
of eggplant and pepper chromosomes are based on their synteny with
tomato and indicated by a white dot. It was not possible to determine
the centromere positions for the Nicotiana chromosomes due to
complex syntenic relationships with tomato. An arrow beside a
chromosome indicates an inversion relative to tomato. A black bar
indicates the breakpoint region of a translocation, and the chromosome
is divided into segments (a-c) accordingly to facilitate comparisons of
multiple species. The marker pair used to define the breakpoint region (i.
e. the two adjacent markers mapped to different tomato chromosomes)
or to define the borders of an inversion is highlighted in red. The map
of the MRCA of N. tomentosiformis and N. acuminata is deduced based
on the comparative maps of N. tomentosiformis, N. acuminata and
tomato, and is not presented directly. The actual N. tomentosiformis map
is presented, and the four inversions relative to its MRCA are indicated
by dash arrows and the border markers are underlined.

solanaceous species and the deduced genome arrangement of
MRCAs (close-up of Figure 4). Designation of chromosome and

2. Nomenclature of MRCAs (ATPt, ATE and ATP) follows Figure 1. Maps of
non-tomato species are depicted in a comparative way to the tomato
map as follows. A black arrow depicts an inversion relative to tomato (a
grey arrow for an uncertain inversion). A black bar depicts the breakpoint
region of a translocation relative to tomato (a grey bar for an uncertain
translocation). Two black bars connected by a curve indicate that the
segment in between is excised in a translocation while the remained
parts stay together, e.g. E10a is embedded in E3b. “1+” (or “2+”) on a
single arrow indicates that the region has experienced at least one (or
two) inversions but the exact number remains to be determined. Markers
displayed on the tomato map were used to define breakpoint regions of
translocations and borders of inversions. The prefix (in parentheses) of a
marker name specifies at which non-tomato maps the marker locates (E
= eggplant, P = pepper, N = Nicotiana). Due to a different tomato map
used for tomato-potato comparison, location and length of inversions on
the potato map are approximate [38]. White dots indicate the
approximate centromere location of the tomato chromosomes.
