Abstract
Background: SINEs (Short INterspersed Elements) are homoplasy-free and co-dominant genetic
markers which are considered to represent useful tools for population genetic studies, and could
help clarifying the speciation processes ongoing within the major malaria vector in Africa, Anopheles
gambiae s.s. Here, we report the results of the analysis of the insertion polymorphism of a nearly
200 bp-long SINE (SINE200) within genome areas of high differentiation (i.e. "speciation islands")
of M and S A. gambiae molecular forms.
Methods: A SINE-PCR approach was carried out on thirteen SINE200 insertions in M and S
females collected along the whole range of distribution of A. gambiae s.s. in sub-Saharan Africa. Ten
specimens each for Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles melas, Anopheles quadriannulatus A and 15 M/S
hybrids from laboratory crosses were also analysed.
Results: Eight loci were successfully amplified and were found to be specific for A. gambiae s.s.: 5
on 2L chromosome and one on X chromosome resulted monomorphic, while two loci positioned
respectively on 2R (i.e. S200 2R12D) and X (i.e. S200 X6.1) chromosomes were found to be
polymorphic. S200 2R12D was homozygote for the insertion in most S-form samples, while
intermediate levels of polymorphism were shown in M-form, resulting in an overall high degree of
genetic differentiation between molecular forms (Fst = 0.46 p < 0.001) and within M-form (Fst =
0.46 p < 0.001). The insertion of S200 X6.1 was found to be fixed in all M- and absent in all Sspecimens. This led to develop a novel easy-to-use PCR approach to straightforwardly identify A.
gambiae molecular forms. This novel approach allows to overcome the constraints associated with
markers on the rDNA region commonly used for M and S identification. In fact, it is based on a
single copy and irreversible SINE200 insertion and, thus, is not subjected to peculiar evolutionary
patterns affecting rDNA markers, e.g. incomplete homogenization of the arrays through concerted
evolution and/or mixtures of M and S IGS-sequences among the arrays of single chromatids.
Conclusion: The approach utilized allowed to develop new easy-to-use co-dominant markers for
the analysis of genetic differentiation between M and S-forms and opens new perspectives in the
study of the speciation process ongoing within A. gambiae.

Background
Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) is the most important
vector of human malaria in Africa, causing 90% of the
fatalcases worldwide [1]. It is believed that the differentiation of this very synanthropic and anthropophilic species
within the A. gambiae complex is very recent, having taken
place a few thousand years ago, as a result of expansion of
human activities, which provided mosquitoes with new
opportunities for breeding, eventually creating a worsening in malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa [2].
Chromosomal and molecular evidence from West Africa
suggests that A. gambiae s.s. is currently undergoing incipient speciation leading to a segregation by reproductive
isolation of (at least) two "molecular forms" provisionally
named M and S [3-6]. These forms have a largely overlapping range west of the Great Rift Valley, although their relative frequencies are very different on a micro-geographic
scale, probably due to adaptation to differentiated larval
habitats [7-10]. Due to common background of shared
ancestral polymorphisms and to the still ongoing
(although limited) gene flow, M and S forms are characterized by an overall very low degree of genetic differentiation, which has been shown to be mostly restricted to
three unlinked regions of their genome. Two are adjacent
to the centromere of 2L and X chromosomes and the other
is in a small portion of the 2R chromosome ("genomic
islands of speciation" [11,12]). Although the overall picture suggests that we are observing speciation at its very
early stages, the taxonomic status of A. gambiae s.s. molecular forms has not yet been established, nor has consensus
been reached on whether or not they should be considered as entities on independent evolutionary trajectories,
i.e. either as polymorphic components of a single species,
or as emerging species. This issue is of great interest not
only from an evolutionary point of view, but also because
it has important implications both for malaria epidemiology and for the optimization of vector-based control strategies.

Recently, the analysis of the insertion patterns of transposable elements (TEs) (i.e. mobile genetic units capable of
replicating and spreading in the host genome) has been
successfully applied to support genetic differentiation
between A. gambiae molecular forms [5,20-22]. Among
TEs, Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) have been
extensively used as phylogenetic and population genetic
markers in primate taxa [23] and, preliminary, in A. gambiae [5,20]. SINEs are 100–500 bp long non-autonomous
retrotransposons occurring in large copy numbers in
eukaryotic genomes [24-27], that need to recruit enzymes
encoded by Long INterspersed Elements (LINEs) to mobilize after transcription via RNA polymerase III [28,29].
They present unique features absent in most other TEs,
which make them particularly useful for phylogenetic and
population genetic studies: i) they can be considered
'homoplasy-free characters' because the chance of independent insertions/excisions into/from the same site is
remote; therefore, the ancestral state is represented by the
absence of the element at a locus and shared insertions at
that locus are identical by descent [23,30]; ii) since they
are short, they can be amplified even from low-quality
genomic DNA and insertion polymorphisms at individual
genomic locations can be easily and rapidly assayed by
PCR [31]; iii) polymorphic SINEs are believed to be
recently inserted and, thus, can help illuminate recent
evolutionary events and resolve complexities in the population genetics structure [30-34].
SINE200 is a ~200 bp element that is highly repetitive
(>3,000 copies) and widespread in the A. gambiae s.s.
genome [35]. Here we report the structure of this element
and the results of a large scale analysis aimed to highlight
different patterns of SINE200 insertion polymorphism
between A. gambiae molecular forms at loci inside the speciation islands and propose the exploitation of these elements as novel molecular markers for the identification
and/or population genetic analysis of M and S forms.

Materials and methods
One major constraint to progress toward a solution of this
debate is represented by difficulties in finding molecular
markers with different/contrasting evolutionary dynamics, which would allow to get a better understanding of
the strength of the reproductive barrier between molecular forms. In fact, so far, M and S forms are characterized
by form-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
in the spacer regions of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) [13-15]
and their population genetics has been analysed mostly
by microsatellite approach, which present important
intrinsic (e.g. low differentiation between M and S and
homoplasy) and technical (e.g. need of sequencing facilities) drawbacks, which have limited their exploitation
[16-19].

Anopheles gambiae samples
The study was carried out on A. gambiae s.s. M- and S-form
adults collected between 1998 and 2006 in 11 African
Countries (Figure 1, Table 1). Ten specimens of other species of A. gambiae complex, i.e. A. arabiensis from Senegal
and Zimbabwe [5,36], A. melas from Angola [10] and A.
quadriannulatus A from Zimbabwe [36] were also analysed.

A cross between females of the GA-CAM (a M-form colony
originated from field gravid females collected in Cameroon) and males of the GA-BF-5.7 colonies (a S-form colony originated from a single field gravid female collected
in Burkina Faso) was performed and parental individuals
and F1 hybrid females were analysed.

Sampling sites, number of specimens of A. gambiae molecular form analysed (N), heterozygosity (H) and allele frequency (AF). Sampling sites are
listed from west to east and numbered as in Figure 1 (for information on the samples and sampling sites see della Torre et al [5]).

Construction of SINE200 consensus sequence and copy
number determination
SINE200 was first reported as part of the A. gambiae
genome annotation [35]. Ninety-two SINE200 copies,
which are 150 bp or longer, were randomly selected from
the PEST genome (version P3, http://www.vector
base.org). Alignment was performed using ClustalX with
gap open penalty = 10, gap extension penalty = 0.05 [37].
The alignment was used as input for the program Consensus http://coot.embl.de/Alignment//consensus.html and
a SINE200 consensus sequence was created using majority
rule. At three positions, where there was no simple majority base, manual inspection allowed us to assign ambiguous bases (e.g., W for A or T). The A. gambiae genome
database was then searched by BLAST using the above
mentioned consensus as a query and the e-value cutoff
was set at e-10. BLAST hits shorter than 150 bp were not
counted.
Analysis of SINE200 insertion polymorphisms
Genomic DNA was extracted with various standard procedures, and specimens were identified to species and
molecular forms by PCR-RFLP [38,39]. SINE200 elements
were located in silico by BLASTN searches on the genome
sequence of the A. gambiae PEST genome using the
obtained SINE200 consensus sequence as a query. Thirteen SINE200 insertions lying within the A. gambiae
molecular form speciation islands (sensu Turner [11]) on
X, 2L and 2R chromosomes, and characterized by the presence of 500 bp flanking regions showing a single hit in the
genome, were selected. Primers were designed to amplify
across the element using Primer 3 software [40]. The

selected loci were named 'S200' followed by the abbreviation of the chromosomal arm (2L, 2R, X), by a number/
letter corresponding to the chromosomal location on the
cytogenetic map [4] and by an additional number aimed
to distinguish primer sets positioned on the same chromosome division. Genes annotated within a 20 Kb
genome sequence including SINE200 insertions for each
locus were retrieved from the PEST genome ver. Agam P3
Feb. 2006 (Table 2).
PCR reactions were carried out in a 25 μl reaction which
contained 1 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 U Taq polymerase, and 0.5 μl of template DNA extracted from a single mosquito. Thermocycler conditions were 94°C for 10 min followed by thirtyfive cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1
min., with a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min, and a
4°C hold. The resulting products were analysed on 1.5%
agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide, with low and
high molecular weight bands corresponding to fragments
containing or lacking the targeted SINE200, respectively.
PCR products representing 'filled' and 'empty' sites of
S200 X6.1 locus on X chromosome were sequenced on
both strands using ABI Big Dye Terminator v.2 chemistry
and an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyser. Multiple alignments were performed using ClustalX [37]. All sequences
were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers
EU881868–EU881887.

which is a small sample of all SINE200 copies (Figure 2).
Analysis of the consensus sequence suggests that SINE200
has a typical structure, with a tRNA-related sequence at its
5' end, a conserved tRNA-unrelated sequence, and a simple repeat at its 3' end. Approximately 70 bp of the 5' end
of the SINE200 consensus is 94% identical to the 5' end of
a tRNA-Pseudo gene (AGAP000459). Sequences similar
to the conserved A and B motifs for the polymerase III promoter were also found. Using the consensus sequence as
a query, we showed that there are approximately 3,200
ubiquitous copies of SINE200 that are 150 bp or longer,
and their density along the five chromosome arms ranges
from 9.9 copies per Mbp (2R) to 12.9 copies per Mbp (X)
(y3).
Analysis of SINE200 insertion polymorphism
The approach utilized was to design specific primers pair
in the flanking regions of SINE200 insertions within M
and S A. gambiae speciation islands, where a higher degree
of form-specific genetic differentiation was expected.
Although SINE200 are present in several copies also in the
target regions, the selection of the loci has been more

complicated than expected, mainly due to abundance of
repetitive sequences in heterochromatic regions in centromeric areas of A. gambiae genome [35]. Eventually, 13
primer pairs were initially designed. Among these, 5 did
not successfully amplified the targeted SINE insertions, as
they did not yield bands or provided aspecific PCR products, and the analysis was therefore focused on the
remaining 8 loci. Table 2 reports chromosomal location
and annotated genes retrieved in the neighbouring
genome areas of the 8 successfully amplified SINE loci.
Each of these loci was initially scored for SINE200 insertion polymorphism by PCR-amplifying 15 M-form and
15 S-form specimens from either Burkina Faso and Cameroon and 15 S-form from Mali. SINE200 element insertions were found fixed in both forms in all five loci on the
2L speciation island, polymorphic in two loci positioned
on 2R (i.e. S200 2R12D) and X (i.e. S200 X6.1) chromosomes, respectively, whereas a second SINE200 on centromeric area of X chromosome (S200 X6.2) was absent in all
individuals analysed. SINE200 insertions were absent in
all eight loci in the other analysed species of the A. gam-

biae complex (i.e. A. arabiensis, A. melas and A. quadriannulatus A).
The two polymorphic loci positioned on X and 2R chromosomes, were further studied by analysing additional
111 M-form and 200 S-form specimens (Table 1). In the
case of S200 2R12D locus, all S-form specimens resulted
homozygotes for the insertion, except for few individuals
from Mali (allele frequency [AF] = 0.97) and Senegal (AF
= 0.98), while intermediate levels of polymorphisms were
shown in M-form (AF = 0.38–0.53), resulting in an overall
high degree of genetic differentiation between molecular
forms (Fst = 0.46 P < 0.001). Moreover, preliminary
results show intra-form differentiation between west (i.e.
Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Benin) and west-central (i.e.
Cameroon and Angola) M-subsamples (Fst = 0.46 P <
0.001), while no significant variation was found within
each subsample. On the other hand, no intra-form differentiation at the same locus was recorded in the S-form
sample within the same range of distribution.
Remarkable differences among molecular forms were
found at locus S200 X6.1 (Table 1): in all samples the
insertion was fixed in M-form individuals, from which a
single PCR product of 479 bp was amplified, and absent
in S-form specimens, from which a 249 bp product was
obtained (Figure 3). As expected, laboratory-reared specimens of both molecular forms analysed (N = 60) showed
the same pattern of insertion at S200 X6.1 locus. Moreover, the analysis of M/S hybrids resulting from laboratory
crosses produced consistent results, yielding both PCRbands from all hybrid M/S specimens analysed (N = 15)
(Figure 3). The absence of SINE200 at this locus was confirmed in all the other A. gambiae s.l. member species ana-

lysed. Interestingly, the PCR product obtained from A.
arabiensis was represented by a 223 bp band, due to a 26
bp deletion in the S200 X6.1 flanking region. In addition,
the alignment of S200 X6.1 flanking regions sequences
showed (Figure 4): i) fixed mutations at 3 positions in the
alignment (positions 16, 74, 359) differentiating both A.
gambiae s.s. molecular forms from A. arabiensis, A. melas
and A. quadriannulatus; ii) mutations in two positions
(pos. 17, 69) differentiating the M-form from all the other
taxa analysed; iii) a very high conservation in the

Sequence alignment of S200 X6.1 and flanking regions in the Anopheles gambiae s.l
Sequence alignment of S200 X6.1 and flanking regions in the Anopheles gambiae s.l. Nucleotide substitutions at
each position are indicated with the appropriate nucleotide. Deletions are denoted by dashes (-). The nucleotide deletion of 26
bp in the flanking region of S200 X6.1 for A. arabiensis corresponds to positions 82–107. Deletion at positions 124–353 corresponds to the absence of the S200 X6.1 element in A. gambiae S form, A. quadriannulatus A, A. arabiensis and A. melas. Target
site duplications (TSDs) are underlined.

sequence of the element was found in all M individuals
analysed.

Discussion
The analysis of the consensus sequence of SINE200 indicates that it is a typical tRNA-related SINE element. In fact,
it has a tRNA-related region at the 5' end with the A and B
boxes found in polymerase III promoters. It also has a variable number of the AAG tandem repeat at the 3' end,
which is also typical for tRNA-related SINEs [42]. The
middle of SINE200 is a conserved sequence that is not
related to tRNA sequences, as already described for other
eukaryotic SINE elements [43].

Eight SINE200 loci within A. gambiae s.s. speciation
islands were analysed, as follows: i) two on the X-chromosome, one of which (i.e. S200 X6.2) was absent in all specimens tested, while the other (i.e. S200 X6.1) was fixed in
the M-form and absent in the S-form samples; ii) one on
2R (i.e. S200 2R12D), which was found polymorphic in
both molecular forms; and iii) five on 2L, which were all
fixed in both forms. The observed high frequency of fixation of the insertions in centromeric areas probably
reflects a common behaviour of transposable elements,
which tend to accumulate in regions of reduced recombination [44], as also suggested for other retrotrasposon
classes in the A. gambiae genome [21].

The observed differences in the allelic frequencies at S200
2R12D locus highlight a significant reduction of geneflow between the two molecular forms. This represents an
additional evidence in support of the relevance of this
small chromosomal region in the speciation process
ongoing within A. gambiae s.s., as proposed by Turner et al
[11]. Interestingly, S200 2R12D lies in close proximity
(about 20 Kb) to an odour receptor gene (i.e. GPR-OR38),
which has been suggested to be likely related to reproductive isolation between molecular forms [12]. Moreover, a
similar level of differentiation was observed within Mform, suggesting a subdivision between western and western-central M-populations (Figure 1). This sub-structuring
observed within the M-form is consistent with recent evidence from a wide microsatellite analysis carried out on
the same M-form populations [45] and with previous
observations by Slotman et al [6], who suggests that M
populations from Mali and Cameroon may no longer be
considered a "single entity". It should be noted, however,
that S200 2R12D locus lies within 2Rb chromosomal
inversion, which is shared by M and S forms and shows
different frequencies in various eco-geographic areas
[4,5]. It is thus possible that the spread of this element in
natural populations is affected by 2Rb inversion polymorphism, although preliminary data show that S200 2R12D
insertion is not exclusive of one of the two alternative
chromosomal arrangements (i.e. 2R+b and 2Rb). Further
studies on larger karyotyped samples are ongoing to evaluate a possible association between the 2Rb inversion and
the element insertion.
As it is recognized that SINEs do not excide from a
genome after their insertion [23,30] and since all SINE200
loci analysed were found to be specific of A. gambiae s.s.,
the analysed insertions likely occurred after divergence of
this species from the other members of the A. gambiae
complex. Moreover, S200 X6.1 was found to be exclusive
of and highly conserved in the M-form and, therefore,
probably recently integrated in its genome after divergence of molecular forms within the chromosome-X speciation island. This locus lies in proximity of CYP4G16, a
gene of the cytochrome P450 family which has been indicated as a candidate gene in the incipient speciation process ongoing within A. gambiae s.s. [11].
In addition to the above cited indications in favour of a
possible fruitful exploitation of SINE200 in the study of
the sub-structuring of A. gambiae, the exclusive presence of
S200 X6.1 in the M-form allows to propose a novel
straightforward approach to distinguish A. gambiae s.s.
molecular forms. In fact, all methods developed so far for
their identification are based on point mutations in IGS
region of rDNA, which is formed by several tandem arrays
known to be subjected to concerted evolution. Thus, possible diagnostic problems, in particular in the interpreta-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/1/163

tion of hybrid M/S patterns, may arise from incomplete
homogenization of the arrays through concerted evolution and/or mixtures of M and S IGS-sequences among the
arrays of single chromatids, due to recombination
between copies on the X and Y chromosomes [15]. The
S200 X6.1 locus, on the other hand, although located only
about 1 Mb from IGS-region, does not show these constraints, being present in a single copy on the X-chromosome. Moreover, it is important to highlight that PCRRFLP [38,39], and IMP-PCR [13,46] methods currently
used for M and S identification are based on the recognition of single/few mutation(s), and thus subjected to
homoplasy. On the other hand, the PCR diagnostic
approach here proposed is based on the specific and irreversible insertion of a 230 bp element in the M-form (and
its absence in S-form), thus allowing an unambiguous,
simple and straightforward recognition of M and S forms
(Figure 3). It is also interesting to note that, although the
S-form amplicon is identical to those of A. melas and A.
quadriannulatus, the 26 bp deletion reported for A. arabiensis allows to propose the use of the novel approach to
discriminate A. gambiae from A. arabiensis specimens without preliminary species identification in large areas of
sub-saharan Africa where A. gambiae molecular forms and
A. arabiensis are the only species of the complex present.

Conclusion
The approach utilized opens new perspectives in the studies of A. gambiae molecular forms. Further analyses on
SINE200 loci mapping in different areas of A. gambiae
genome are ongoing based on preliminary selection by a
genome-wide TE-display approach of form-specific or
polymorphic loci, to eventually provide additional, new
efficient co-dominant markers for the analysis of genetic
differentiation between M and S-forms.
