Abstract
Background: The hemibiotrophic fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa is the causal agent of Witches'
broom, a disease of Theobroma cacao. The pathogen life cycle ends with the production of
basidiocarps in dead tissues of the infected host. This structure generates millions of basidiospores
that reinfect young tissues of the same or other plants. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the sexual phase of this fungus may help develop chemical, biological or genetic
strategies to control the disease.
Results: Mycelium was morphologically analyzed prior to emergence of basidiomata by
stereomicroscopy, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The morphological changes
in the mycelium before fructification show a pattern similar to other members of the order
Agaricales. Changes and appearance of hyphae forming a surface layer by fusion were correlated
with primordia emergence. The stages of hyphal nodules, aggregation, initial primordium and
differentiated primordium were detected. The morphological analysis also allowed conclusions on
morphogenetic aspects. To analyze the genes involved in basidiomata development, the expression
of some selected EST genes from a non-normalized cDNA library, representative of the fruiting
stage of M. perniciosa, was evaluated. A macroarray analysis was performed with 192 selected clones
and hybridized with two distinct RNA pools extracted from mycelium in different phases of
basidiomata formation. This analysis showed two groups of up and down-regulated genes in
primordial phases of mycelia. Hydrophobin coding, glucose transporter, Rho-GEF, Rheb, extensin
precursor and cytochrome p450 monooxygenase genes were grouped among the up-regulated. In
the down-regulated group relevant genes clustered coding calmodulin, lanosterol 14 alpha
demethylase and PIM1. In addition, 12 genes with more detailed expression profiles were analyzed

by RT-qPCR. One aegerolysin gene had a peak of expression in mycelium with primordia and a
second in basidiomata, confirming their distinctiveness. The number of transcripts of the gene for
plerototolysin B increased in reddish-pink mycelium and indicated an activation of the initial
basidiomata production even at this culturing stage. Expression of the glucose transporter gene
increased in mycelium after the stress, coinciding with a decrease of adenylate cyclase gene
transcription. This indicated that nutrient uptake can be an important signal to trigger fruiting in
this fungus.
Conclusion: The identification of genes with increased expression in this phase of the life cycle of
M. perniciosa opens up new possibilities of controlling fungus spread as well as of genetic studies of
biological processes that lead to basidiomycete fruiting. This is the first comparative morphologic
study of the early development both in vivo and in vitro of M. perniciosa basidiomata and the first
description of genes expressed at this stage of the fungal life cycle.

Background
Moniliophthora perniciosa (Stahel) Aime and Phillip-Mora
(2005) [1] is a hemibiotrophic basidiomycete that causes
Witches' Broom Disease (WBD) in cocoa (Theobroma
cacao L). Currently, WBD occurs in South and Central
America and can cause crop losses of up to 90% [2]. In
Bahia (Brazil), M. perniciosa was identified in 1989 [3]
and, as a consequence of its spreading, the annual production of cocoa beans dropped from 450,000 to 90,000 tons
within 12 years, reducing export values from an all-time
high of about US$ 1 billion to 110 million. During this
period nearly 200,000 rural workers lost their jobs, resulting in an intensive migration from farms to urban areas
[4].
The fungus infects young meristematic tissues inducing
hypertrophy and hyperplasia, loss of apical dominance,
and proliferation of axillary shoots. The hypertrophic
growth of the infected vegetative meristems (green
broom) is the most characteristic symptom of WBD [5].
Basidiomata, in which basidiospores are produced,
develop on dead but attached dry brooms of cacao trees in
the field, after dry and wet periods. Basidiospores are
spread by wind and depend on sufficient moisture for survival. They can only germinate on and infect susceptible
cacao tissues (i.e. buds, young leaves, flower cushions, or
young pods) if relative humidity levels are near 100%.
Shortly after infection the pathogen establishes a biotrophic relationship with the host during which the fungus has an intercellular, biotrophic, monokaryotic growth
phase, without clamp connections. Four to six weeks later,
the hyphae become dikaryotic, develop clamp connections and the fungus grows saprophytically [5]. A wellcharacterized concerted series of cell death events [6]
causes the green broom to become necrotic, and basidiomata are formed in a favorable environment after 6
weeks or more [7].
Information about morphological development and environment that affect basidiomata and basidiospore pro-

duction of M. perniciosa are important to improve the in
vitro culture of the pathogen and to study its life cycle.
Environmental conditions for basidiomata production
have been described by Suarez [8], Rocha [9] and Rocha
and Wheeler [10,11]. An artificial production of basidiomata has been studied by several authors, but an ideal
production mode has not yet been achieved. Stahel [12]
observed basidiomata development on mycelial mats in
agar cultures. Purdy et al. [13] and Purdy and Dickstein
[14] modified Stahel's methods to produce basidiomata
on mycelial mats. Griffith and Hedger [7] improved
basidiomata production by using bran-vermiculite
medium, a method currently used to produce M. perniciosa basidiospores. Later, Niella et al. [15] modified
medium formulation and Macagnan et al. [16] removed
vermiculite and the extra layer of cacao powder and
CaSO4 originally used to cover the medium and to reduce
the time to fruiting. The difficulty of obtaining axenic cultures and the long cultivation time has hindered more
detailed studies on the morphology and early development of M. perniciosa basidiomata.
Several studies of basidiomata development in other
basidiomycetes, e.g., Agaricus bisporus, Flammulina velutipes, Boletus edulis [17] as well as mycorrhizal fungi such
as Laccaria sp. [18] have already been published, complementing research on Coprinopsis cinerea and Schizophyllum
commune, which are models for developmental studies in
macroscopic basidiomycota [19]. Basidiomata of M. perniciosa produced either in nature [20-22] or under laboratory conditions [13,7,14] have been studied and their
morphology was originally described by Stahel [12].
Later, Delgado and Cook [23] showed that the hyphae
found in basidiomata are dikaryotic whereas basidia are
monokaryotic (i.e. diploid, following karyogamy).
Although the microscopic characteristics and growth patterns of both monokaryotic and dikaryotic mycelia have
been described elsewhere [24-26], there is no microscopic
characterization of the pattern of basidiomata developPage 2 of 18

ment. We provide the first description of primordium
development of M. perniciosa basidiomata. Based on our
observations the development was divided in four stages,
similar to those described for A. bisporus (17). Together
with the sequencing and annotation of the M. perniciosa
genome [27], detailed morphologic information is
important for future research into M. perniciosa mutants,
complementing genetic studies. Here we describe and histologically compare the development of both in vivo and
in vitro-grown M. perniciosa basidiomata and analyze the
expression of 192 selected ESTs by macroarray and of 12
ESTs by RT-qPCR.

Results and discussion
Morphological observations
Observations of dead brooms kept in humid chambers or
collected directly from the field showed the presence of a
thin mat of saprophytic mycelium on the surface of the
brooms. It was possible to notice color changes and the
morphology that preceded basidiomata formation on this
mat. The aerial mycelium formed a thick layer with notable color modifications: it was initially white (Figure 1A),
then yellow (Figure 1B) and later, reddish pink (Figure
1C). At a later stage, dark-brown to reddish spots
appeared until onset of primordium growth (Figure 1E
and 1F). The same characteristics were observed in artificial cultivation (Figure 1D), which allowed a monitoring
of the morphogenetic stages of M. perniciosa basidiomata.

Currently two media are used to produce basidiomata of
M. perniciosa. The "Griffith medium" [7] contains pieces
of bran/vermiculite covered with a casing layer of peat/
gypsum, while the "Macagnan medium" [16] contains dry
broom material. When plugs of dikaryotic mycelia are
transferred from agar culture to either of these two solid
media and incubated at 25°C in Petri dishes, a network of
hyphae initiates growth within and on the surface of the
solid particles. Once the medium is well-colonized (similar to spawn-running in mushroom cultivation), basidiomata production is induced by opening the dishes,
suspending the block of substrate (Figure 1D), and subjecting it to a regime of intermittent watering and a daily
photoperiod of 10–12 h light.
When cultured in the "Griffith medium", mycelial mats of
M. perniciosa isolate CP03 (see Methods) turned light-yellow four days after exposure to air and water, changing to
reddish-pink after a further ten days, finally becoming
dark-reddish pink until the onset of basidiomata development, some two to eight weeks later. These color changes
were not uniform among parts of mycelial mats, varying
according to irrigation intensity. The whitish aerial mycelium remained visible until the end of cultivation on
some parts of the mycelial mats. Color changes also
occurred in long-term stored mycelia at 25°C, however,

mented cells (Figure 2A, pink arrow). After exposure to
water and air in the wetting/drying chamber, there
appeared to be further agglomeration of hyphae into
thicker structures, often covered with a layer of amorphous material (Figure 2B) and some raised areas with
curved hyphae were also observed (Figure 2C). These
changes were concurrent with the formation of yellow,
reddish pink and dark-reddish pink pigmentation on the
mat surfaces. In contrast, the mycelium on dry brooms
already formed a dense layer at the white stage, probably
due to the fact that this layer is formed in response to regular irrigation to which the brooms were subjected from
the beginning of the experiment (Figure 1A and 1C).

basidiomata formation was never observed. Since mycelium color change was a pre-requisite for primordium
formation, we standardized the collections according to
their color.
In an examination of the mycelial mats during the 32-day
incubation period in Petri dishes, prior to incubation in
the wetting/drying chambers, branched and agglomerated
hyphae (mycelial cords) were observed fanning out on the
surface of the substrate, appearing as long strands (Figure
2A, yellow arrow), with probable hyphal fusion along
part of their length (Figure 2A, white arrow). At some
points, hyphae were covered in a thin amorphous layer,
apparently composed of plant cell wall material (Figure
2A, red arrow), as well as irregularly swollen and orna-

Curved hyphae, leading to a possible hyphal fusion, were
observed at this moment and in all distinct stages of the
superficial mycelium, a pattern also observed in Laccaria
spp [18]. Side-by-side hyphal branches evolved to larger
plate-like structures in reddish pink mycelium (Figure 2B)
and in mycelium forming the primordia apex (Figure 2D).
These plate structures were not always continuous and
some mycelial strands appeared empty or dry (not
shown). A microscopic tissue section of reddish-pink
mycelium in air contact revealed a distinctive mycelium
layer with a mean thickness of 60 μm (Figure 2E, arrow),
as well as internal net patterns of hyphae.
Similar patterns of hyphal growth were reported by Heckman et al. [28] in A. bisporus before basidiomata formation [28]. These authors recognized four morphological
stages of mycelium and observed side-by-side hyphal
fusions and the formation of hyphal wall ornamentation,
which occurred in the first mycelial growth phase [28]. In
the second stage, hyphal fusion led to the formation of
structures called strands. Microscopic primordia were
formed in the third stage in more compact masses, in
areas of dense mycelial growth. At the fourth stage, primordia were visible to the unaided eye. Fused and ornamented hyphae as well as strands appeared in M.
perniciosa before primordium development. Therefore, the
process of primordium development of M. perniciosa was
similar to that observed for A. bisporus, exept for the formation of an impermeable surface layer in hyphae and
the type of hyphal ornamentation only observable in M.
perniciosa.
The chemical composition of the impermeable surface
layer was investigated. No reduced sugars, lipids and phenols were detected (data not shown). If these layers consisted of empty fused hyphae, chitinases were possibly
active in this event. Lopes [29] observed an increased
expression of chitinases in M. perniciosa in the reddish
pink mycelium prior to basidiomata formation. It may
also be possible that these areas are rich in hydrophobins,
a protein required in basidiomata formation in several

other fungi that form a thin outer layer on hyphae
exposed to the air [30]. These proteins form an amphipathic layer between hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces,
which protects the hyphae-inducing aerial mycelia [31].
An increased expression of hydrophobin-encoding genes
was observed during mycelial mat growth of M. perniciosa
[32].
Changes in pigmentation of the superficial mycelium of
M. perniciosa were described by Purdy et al. [13] and by
Griffith and Hedger [7]. In our experiments, changes in
pigmentation were observed in mycelial mats washed in
chambers until basidiomata emergence, indicating a correlation with basidiomata formation. The same color of
the surface mycelium persists in the primordia, especially
in the apices. The appearance of hyphal nodules coincided with the change in pigmentation from yellow to
pink of the surface mycelium as described before (Figure
2F), and the primordia emerged after this color had darkened. Stronger pigmentation was observed on the primordia apex exactly at points of densely aggregated hyphae,
which leads us to believe that pigmentation is correlated
with hyphal aggregation. The term "hyphal nodules" has
been used to describe the initial phases of basidiomata
development [19] as well as for the nodules in the regions
of the "initials" and in the morphogenesis-directing primordia [33].

Mycena stylobates [34] and Laccaria spp. [18]. Differentiation in Agaricus occurred at the initial stage to produce a
bipolar fruiting body primordium [17,19]. This process
appears to be conserved among Agaricales with slight differences between species. It was rather difficult to microscopically observe the hyphal nodule of the mycelial mats
grown on "Griffith medium" due to the density of the
hyphal layer. However, the primary hyphal nodule stages
of M. perniciosa basidiomata were inferred from the presence of areas of intense localized ramifying hyphal aggregates in small nodules (Figure 2F). These nodules
progressed to a globose aggregate, surrounded by a dense
layer of amorphous material, an irregular arrangement of
interwoven hyphae on the internal tissue of dry brooms
stained green (Figure 3A), which can be considered the
initial stage of hyphal aggregation. This hyphal agglomerate is distinguished by acid fuchsin which stains only living tissues [35]. Aggregates found in dark reddish-pink
mycelium (Figure 2F) indicated a competent mycelium
from which primordia may originate, similar to the aggregates in Laccaria sp., which would give rise to basidiomata
[18].

Primordia of M. perniciosa appeared when the dense mycelial mat showed reddish-pink pigmentation. The first signal of primordial development was probably the
appearance of primary hyphal nodules as well as internal
local aggregations on dark pink-reddish mycelium (Figure
2F). Thereafter, hyphal interaction led to the formation of
compact aggregates that can be considered an undifferentiated stage called initial primordium or secondary hyphal
nodule [19] (Figure 3A). Hyphae belonging to such aggregates were short, large and strongly stainable with fuchsin
acid, a substance present in Pianeze III solution, used to
distinguish fungal from plant tissues (Figure 3A). The primordium emerged from within the surface mycelial layer
(Figure 1E) as a well-defined protuberance (Figure 1F)
with hyphae similar to those found in the aggregates (Figure 4A). The primordium initial (Figure 1F and Figure 3C)
then underwent differentiation to form stipe, pileus (Figure 4B) and lamellae (Figure 4C). Hyphae of the primordium apex were cylindrical, with round apices and
parallel growth, bending at the end distal to the pileus
(Figure 4D, detail). Stipe hyphae were more compact, flat,
growing vertically (Figure 4E). Amorphous material and
clamped hyphae were also present on the apical primordium surface (Figure 2D and Figure 4F, respectively).

Globose aggregates appeared on the surface with a protective layer covering a hyphal bulb (Figure 1E, *). Walther et
al. [34] described a similar phenomenon in the initial
development of M. stylobates. The initial formation of this
layer can be observed in M. perniciosa (Figure 3A, arrow)
that later covered the surface of the protuberant area (Figure 1E, *). Then, an initial emerged (Figure 1F and Figure
3C) and differentiated into a primordium, here referred to
as the third stage (Figure 3E). It is likely that enzymatic
digestion by chitinases [36] occurred in the hyphae of the
outer layer, thereby allowing the "initial" to emerge as a
dense layer, with amorphous material in the center of the
protuberance. Differentiation continued leading to the
formation of the lamellae (Figure 3E, arrow and Figure
4C) and later the pileus (Figure 4B). The apical region of
initials formed the pileus and the basal region formed the
stipe (Figure 4B). At the end of this stage the immature
pileus and stipe (Figure 4G) could be seen with lamellae
already established (not shown). Lamellae expanded after
two to three days (Figure 4H), depending on sufficiently
high moisture levels, as already observed for other basidiomycetes [17]. The hymenium was enclosed by incurved
margins of the pileus, only being exposed when the basidiomata maturated (Figure 4G and 4H). Finally the stipe
elongated and the pileus expanded to expose the
hymenium for basidiospore liberation (Figure 4I). Basidiomata maturation was regulated by humidity and not all
initial primordia progressed to form basidiomata (not
shown).

The various developmental stages of M. perniciosa basidiomata formation were very similar to those previously
described in detail for Agaricus sp. [17], C. cinerea [19],

Primordia emerged from 75 d after the exposure of substrate-grown mycelia to water and light in the humid
chamber (Figure 1G). The first basidiomata were observed

about 10 d after the first primordium was visible, but
undifferentiated primordia were still present on the mat
surface when basidiomata appeared. Density of primordia
was high, their size not uniform and their production discontinuous, suggesting a programmed induction, as in
plant inflorescences. The morphogenesis observed in the
initials (Figure 3) resembled that of other Basidiomycota.
Hyphae aggregated towards the surface and assumed a
vertical position concurrent with an increase in diameter
and compartment length (distance between septa) (Figure
3A and Figure 4A, arrow). These hyphae differentiated to
form an agglomerate (Figure 3A) where they converged in
an apical group (Figure 3B, #) and two lateral groups,
growing in towards the bottom (Figure 3B, black square).
A parallel bundle of hyphae with an inclination in direction to the center of the agglomerate was also observed
(Figure 3B, *). This bundle diminished in length when the
central aggregates increased in size; later, a lateral appendix to the primordium was observed (Figure 3D, arrows
and *). Lateral groups (Figure 3D, #) increased in prominence during development, and the convergent hyphae at
the agglomerate apex became vertically prominent (Figure
3D, black squares).
The lateral groups tended to bend downwards away from
the apex (Figure 3C, *). A group of basal hyphae, however, bent upwards, supporting the hyphal extremity that
bent downwards (Figure 3C, arrow and 3D, arrow). As the
lateral hyphae expanded, the overlapping of these hyphae
diminished (Figure 3E, * and 3F, arrows), increasing the
space between these hyphal groups (Figure 3E, arrow). A
micrograph of an emerged primordium (Figure 4C)
shows a difference in opacity between hyphae, suggesting
that a partial digestion led to the spaces between the
lamellae. Another freehand section shows the lateral
bending of hyphae and the differentiation of the stipe
(Figure 4B). This primordium already possessed a differentiated hymenium (not shown).
Studies in Agaricus sp. and other edible fungi revealed a
hemi-angiocarpous standard developmental stage
[17,19], with a veil covering the primordium. In these
fungi, a cluster of parallel and oriented hyphae emerges
and forms the stipe and the pileus develops from the apical region. Laccaria sp. has a plectenchymal tissue from
which the stipe originates, whilst the pileus arises from an
apical prosenchymal tissue, as in Agaricus [18]. Similar
structures were observed in M. perniciosa (Figure 3B).
However, the development was pseudo-angiocarpous
since the hymenium was protected by the immature
pileus, and no inner veil was present (Figure 4B) [37]. The
morphogenetic mechanism was classified as concentrated, based on the description of Reijnders [38] since
defined globose primordia with a complex anatomy (Figure 3A) were formed. This is compatible with pileostiptocarpic development because stipe and pileus-originated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/158

elements were already present in the primordia at an early
stage (Figure 4B).
Genes related to the early development of M. perniciosa
basidiomata
The molecular basis of cell differentiation that precedes
basidiomata formation was recently investigated
[17,19,39]. Developmentally regulated genes have been
identified for some basidiomycetes such as A. bisporus
[40], C. cinerea [19], Pleurotus ostreatus [41], among others.
Moreover, the rapid increase of fully or partially
sequenced genomes and ESTs from fungi already available
in databanks allow the in silico identification of genes possibly involved in these processes [42,43]. However, the
understanding of the direct association between these
identified genes and their function in the initial development of basidiomata is still incipient. For example, the
study of the ESTs of P. ostreatus led to the identification of
pleurotolysins expressed specifically in the primordial
stage. The function of these proteins is being studied, but
their role in primordia formation is not yet elucidated
[44].

Since the studies in M. perniciosa are also in an early stage,
the identification of genes related to basidiomata development was a first step to establish a possible correlation
between the developmental stages and their expression.
The description of morphological changes in mycelium
prior to the development of reproductive structures is a
key step for subsequent morphogenetic studies and, at
this point, helped in the search for genes related to these
processes. So far, our contribution has been the analysis of
the abundance of transcripts for some selected genes in
specific moments during induction of fungal fruiting. Two
independent but related tests were carried out. Using 192
genes from a library derived from mycelium in the fructification stage, a reverse Northern analysis, also known as
macro array was performed, contrasting the early culturing with the final stage, when the first basidiomata
appear. Additionally, a RT-qPCR was performed for 12
genes, analyzing their expression in each of the stages
described in the above-described morphological studies.
The development of basidiomycetes such as C. cinerea,
one of the best-studied to date [19], served as guideline
underlying the choice of the genes. In the case of these
fungi, fructification seems to occur in genetically pre-conditioned mycelium and in response to nutrient deficiency,
as well as to stimuli such as alternating light/dark, humidity and CO2 concentration [19]. Based on these studies,
genes were selected and identified in the available library.

The macroarray analyses give us an overview of gene activity during fruiting in M. perniciosa. We discriminated 192
genes in two expression patterns: group I, containing upregulated genes in the white mycelium phase and group II,
containing up-regulated genes in the primordia mycelium
phase (Figure 5). Some genes are noteworthy because previous descriptions report their participation in the fruiting
process of other fungi. In this trial, hydrophobins were
represented by four clones and three of them showed
increased expression during the primordial stage.

differences in their expression profile between mycelia in
white and primordial phases, which would allow their
identification as induced or repressed at these two contrasting developmental stages (Figure 5). ESTs were
obtained from a full-length cDNA library, previously constructed from mycelia, primordia and mature basidiomata collected during fructification (Pires et al.,
unpublished data) and selected based on their similarity
with known conserved genes. The complete list of the
selected genes is shown in Table S1 [see Additional file 1]
as well as the fold change values obtained by comparing
the results of each spot in the 'white' and ' primordia '
stages. A classification based on the likely functions of
these gene products was performed as described by
Gesteira et al. [45], to deepen the understanding of the
participation of these genes in the fructification process of
M. perniciosa. The Table S1 [see Additional file 1] shows
also some genes for which the increase of transcripts in the
primordial stage compared to the white phase was significant by the Student's t test of means.

Hydrophobins are cysteine-rich proteins specific for filamentous fungi, capable of generating amphipathic films
on the surface of an object [31]. They are related to a
broad range of growth and development processes,
among them the formation of aerial structures [46]. At
least five M. perniciosa hydrophobin-encoding genes have
been identified [27]. The differences in expression in mycelial mat cultures for basidiomata production were considerable. Unlike four other genes for hydrophobin, one
gene was shown to have increased expression in the presence of primordia [32] and two were identified in a compatible M. perniciosa-T. cacao cDNA library derived from
green brooms [45].
Studies in other fungi show that hemolysin expression is
specifically increased in the presence of primordia [47],
but in this experiment there was no significant increase in
the expression of the genes that encode for aegerolysins.
Only one gene for pleurotolysin A decreased significantly.
On the other hand, genes encoding cytochrome P450
mono-oxygenase and a heat shock protein had increased
expression in the primordial stage, which may indicate
the induction of fruiting in response to stress [17]. Cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases ('P450s') are a superfamily of haem-thiolate proteins that are involved in the
metabolism of a wide variety of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds [48]. In C. cinerea, the cytochrome P450
similar to CYP64 is most expressed in pilei and seems to
be involved in the synthesis route of aflatoxins that seem
to be important for fruiting in Aspergillus spp. [17].
The appearance of primordia coincided with the decrease
of transcripts for calmodulin and increased expression for
genes coding for signaling proteins such as RHO1 guanine
nucleotide exchange factor (RHO-GEF), RHO GDP-dissociation inhibitor, GTP-binding protein RHEB homolog
precursor, indicating that signaling is most likely mediated by fruiting-associated proteins of the Ras family.
Additionally, the genes for cellular transport of glucose
and gluconate were clearly more significantly transcribed
at the primordial stage [see additional file 1], while a
probable transcription factor GAL4 decreased. This indicates that glucose depletion of the medium, which occurs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/158

throughout the culture, must be important for fructification and must be related to cAMP signaling [49]. Gene
gti1, encoding an inducer of gluconate transport in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, controls glucose catabolism, increasing the low-affinity transport system of glucose [50]. The
glucose transporter present in this test is rather similar to
the high-affinity glucose transporter SNF3, although this
has not been confirmed experimentally [51]. Glucose
metabolism can be related to fructification [17].
The increase of gene transcripts for vacuolar ATP synthase,
phospholipid-transporting ATPase and reductase levodione also indicates that nutrient uptake during the primordial stage serves to form nutrient reserves prior to
basidiomata elongation [17]. This is confirmed by the
increase of transcripts for several genes of primary and secondary metabolism that may be related to the synthesis of
glycerol and lipids. In C. cinerea reserves are remobilized
and glycogen accumulated in the primordial stage [19].
The expression of three genes related to cell division was
significantly higher, two for a 123 kD protein of cell division (Cdc123) and one encoding a suppressor of kinetochore, and one PIM1 gene was significantly less expressed
in the primordial stage. Cdc123 proteins are regulators of
eIF2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are regulated by nutrient availability [52]. This simultaneous increase indicates
the predominance of phase G1 of cell division. As the formation of spores occurs in already differentiated primordia, it is likely that the collected phase contains a larger
number of non-differentiated primordia.
There was also a significant increase of six genes of
unknown function, one of them showing no similarity
with any sequence in the available public data banks.
Expression analyses of genes involved in basidiomata
development by RT-qPCR
The gene expression profile obtained by the macroarray in
two distinct phases suggested physiological changes in
mycelia prior to basidiomata production. However, more
detailed analyses should be performed to monitor the
expression of key genes (previously described in the literature as involved in basidiomata development). Quantitative PCR is an accurate technique to analyze gene
expression. It is 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive
than RNase protection assays and 1,000 times more sensitive than dot blot hybridization [53]. Therefore, a more
detailed RT-qPCR analysis was performed with 12 ESTs in
order to observe a possible relationship between transcript levels of all samples collected (Figure 6). RNA was
obtained from mycelium samples of all seven developmental stages: white, yellow and reddish pink phases,
before and after stress, and during basidiomata formation.

The hypothesis that nutrient depletion might act as a signal for fructification was confirmed since some genes
related to primary metabolism and to nutrient uptake
were down-regulated when primordia emerged. Conversely, gene expression related to nutrient recycling and
stress response increased during this phase, as did the
expression of genes directly involved in cell development
(Figure 3). The relative expression of the 12 genes in stages

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:158

that precede fructification helped elucidate the correlation
between nutrient depletion and fructification (Figure 6)
since the genes MpRHEB, MpRHO1-GEF, MpADE,
MpMBF, and MpRAB putatively involved in signaling are
associated with internal perception of the signals triggered
by nutrient depletion and other stresses, which was
noticeable before the primordia appeared. The putative
gene MpRHEB is associated with growth regulation probably during nitrogen depletion [54]. Its expression in M.
perniciosa increased in reddish pink mycelium, immediately before stress and continued at a high level until the
beginning of the primordial and basidiomata phases (Figure 6D). The expression of the high-affinity transporter
MpGLU [51] peaked in this mycelium before stress (Figure 6E), strongly indicating a nutritional deficit, namely
low external glucose concentration. Moreover, expression
of MpCPR and MpCYP was low during this period (Figure
6G and 6K), indicating a lower basal metabolism [48].
The expression of MpRAB (Figure 6J) may indicate nutrient remobilization, since it is involved in intracellular
traffic [55,56].
During the water stress applied to trigger in vitro fructification expression of some genes peaked. Transcripts of putative MpMBF (multi-protein-bridging factor), a coactivator related to tolerance to abiotic stresses in plants
[57], increased 2.4-fold (Figure 6I). Other genes with
increased expression during this stress period were
MpRHO1-GEF (Figure 6H), involved in signaling for the
regulation of polarized growth [58] and MpRPL18 (Figure
6L) involved in protein synthesis. Involvement of signalization, probably cAMP-mediated, is likely due the expression of adenylate cyclase that decreased in the yellow and
reddish-pink mycelial phases, to return to the original levels observed on white mycelium just after the stress period
(Figure 6F). As adenylate cyclase is subject to post-translational regulation, studies of enzymatic activity would be
necessary to confirm this hypothesis. The gene p-rho/gef is,
therefore, possibly correlated with cAMP pathways.
Repression of the glucose transporter coincided with the
repression of the adenylate cyclase gene, which also indicates cAMP signaling. In S. pombe the glucose levels are
regulated by adenylate cyclase [59] and in Sclerotinia sclerotiorus the development of reproductive structures is negatively regulated by cAMP [60]
Putative aegerolysins and pleurotolysin B of M. perniciosa
are differentially expressed during fructification
As described for other fungi, probable hemolysins are
highly expressed at the fructification stages [47,61]. We
identified three putative genes involved in fructification,
two more closely related to the identified AA-Pri1 or PriAs
of Agrocybe aerogerita and P. ostreatus, respectively, and one
more closely related to pleurotolysin B, also identified in
P. ostreatus. Their different expression profiles suggested

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/158

that they are different genes (Figure 6A to 6C). The expression of MpPRIA1encoding a putative aegerolysin,
decreased in the yellow- and reddish pink-mycelium
phases, and also before stress, but increased 4.3-fold in
mycelia with primordia, and about 90-fold in the basidiomata, compared to the white mycelium stage (Figure
6A). The expression of the putative hemolysin-encoding
gene MpPRIA1 increased 17-fold at the reddish pink mycelium stage, but decreased 11-fold before stress, 4-fold in
stressed mycelia, and 47.4-fold in mycelia with primordia.
The transcripts of MpPRIA2 increased 23-fold in basidiomata, but were lower in mycelia with primordia (Figure
6B). The transcripts of gene MpPLYB, corresponding to a
pleurotolysin B, increased 1.4-fold in the yellow mycelium stage, 15.2-fold in reddish pink mycelia, and
remained at high levels in the mycelia before stress (11.7fold), when stressed (11.2-fold) and in mycelia with primordia (10.1-fold), but decreased in basidiomata, where
it was only 1.6 times higher than in white mycelia (Figure
6C).
Hemolysins, already identified in some bacteria and
fungi, comprise a cytolytic protein family, whose members appear abundantly during primordia and basidiomata formation [47,58,61,62]. MpPRIA1 and MpPRIA2
have homologous regions but seem to correspond to two
individual genes whose expression coincides with the
morphological differentiation of primary hyphal nodules
from primordia. These hemolysins may contribute to the
process of hyphal aggregation [61] as their expression
occurred, although at low levels, before the appearance of
primordia, when hyphae became globose for the formation of the "initials". This stage coincides with the reddish
pink mycelium stage, where hyphal nodules are detectable. The exact function of these proteins remains unclear,
but their involvement in programmed cell death (PCD),
as proposed by Kues and Liu [17], seems rather unlikely
because ostreolysins have lytic function, acting in cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-containing membranes [63] at
a pH between 7 and 8 [64], which is not usually found in
fungal cells.
The known fungal hemolysins have some variations in
amino acid sequences, but all share the conserved domain
aegerolysin (code PF06355 by Pfam database [65]).
Aegerolysin Aa-Pri1 from A. aegerita has the same molecular weight as the 16 kDa ostreolysin of P. ostreatus and is
mainly expressed in the initial stage of primordium formation. PriA (or pleurotolysin or PlyA) of P. ostreatus
forms a subfamily with the aegerolysin superfamily,
which includes the Asp-hemolysins of Aspergillus fumigatus, and some hypothetical proteins of Clostridium bifermentans, P. aeruginosa and Neurospora crassa. P. ostreatus
hemolysin consists of multiple components with isoforms A and B that assemble to a protein complex that

Conclusion
Our analysis of gene expression is an initial approach to
correlate gene expression with distinct developmental
stages of M. perniciosa basidiomata. Gene expression pro-

files in mycelia before basidiomata induction indicate
that the observed morphological changes correlate with
induction of genes known to be involved in the development of new macroscopic structures in other fungi. An
involvement of a glucose depletion-dependent cell signaling is suggested by the regulation of adenylate cyclase and
glucose transporter genes. However, other up-regulated
genes may be responsible for the formation of hyphal
nodules, redirecting cytoskeleton modeling, hyphal thickness or nutrient uptake, and most of them may be essential for the maintenance of basidiomata. Our data provide
new information about the development of basidiomata
in M. perniciosa and identify a set of genes probably
involved in this process. This information may be useful
for further studies towards a more complete understanding of the cell processes and genetic, physiological and
environmental controls leading to basidiomata initiation.
Once the key genes that determine growth and development of M. perniciosa are known, strategies can be provided for an enhanced control of this phytopathogen and

for a successful monitoring of witches' broom disease in
T. cacao.

Methods
Fungal strains and growth conditions
A considerable number of observations of the early primordia development were made in infected brooms collected from cocoa plantations in Itajuípe (14° 40' 43" S,
39° 22'31" W), Bahia, Brazil. The brooms were kept in a
moist chamber and basidiomata formation was induced.
Briefly, they were soaked for 1 h in 1% benomyl solution
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, USA), to kill the ascomycete fungi present on the broom surfaces, hung in a chamber (12:12 h light:dark) and sprayed with de-ionized
water for 1 min/h for each 24 h period. M. perniciosa strain
CEPEC 1108 (designated CP03) of the C biotype of M.
perniciosa was also used for morphological studies. Mycelial starter cultures from the culture collection of the
Cocoa Research Center (CEPEC, Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil)
were grown on PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) for three
weeks in the dark, at room temperature. Basidiomata were
obtained from mycelial mats, as described by Griffith and
Hedger [7] with the modifications introduced by Niella et
al. [15]. A solid bran-based medium was prepared (50 g
wheat flour; 40 g vermiculite; 6 g CaSO4 × 2H2O, 3 g
CaCO3 and 120 mL distilled water; moisture content 65–
70%, pH 7.0–7.5). The mixture was placed in Petri dishes,
covered with aluminum foil and autoclaved twice for 90
min (121°C). The cooled medium was inoculated with
two 5-mm disc plugs from 1 to 3-week-old mycelium,
grown on 2% PDA medium. Cultures were incubated at
25°C in the dark. After mycelia had completely colonized
the surface of the bran medium (usually 3–4 weeks), cultures were covered with a 5-mm thick layer (5–10 g per
culture), composed of 200 g coarse peat, 50 g CaCO3, 50
g vermiculite and 125 mL distilled water (moisture content 70–75%, pH 7.0–7.5). These cultures were incubated
for 3 to 4 weeks at 25°C in the dark and then hung vertically in a broom chamber [14], and maintained at 23°C ±
2°C for 75 d. Irrigation consisted of spraying de-ionized
water daily for 7 h with a 12 h period of fluorescent warm
white light (65–80 W). After 30 d in the chambers, the irrigation was suspended for 7 d, a procedure routinely used
to induce fructification.
Microscopic analyses
The preparation of mycelial mat samples for light microscopy was conducted according to standard histological
methods [66]. For histological studies of basidiomata
development at various stages, samples were fixed after
collection by dehydration in a gradient of ethanol/tertiary
butyl alcohol series (50 to 100%) for 2 h each, and thermally embedded in paraffin (melting point 56.5°C; Paraplast plus; Fisher Sci. Co., Pittsburgh, USA). The
embedded tissues were radially cut (5 to 14 μm thick)
with a rotary microtome. Serial sections were thermally

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/158

mounted on microscope slides coated with Haupt's adhesive and 4% formalin [67]. The sections were immersed/
rinsed three times in 100% xylene and passed through a
series of xylene and absolute ethyl alcohol (EtOH) 1:1,
absolute ETOH, and 70% ETOH. Some sections were
stained with Pianeze III-B stain [68,69]. This procedure
specifically stained soluble and insoluble proteins red
with acid fuchsin and non-living material, i.e. polysaccharides and phenol, green to dark green [35]. Other sections
were stained for 1 h with 1% astra blue and then for 1 h
with 1% safranin. Macroscopic and tissue analysis was
performed in a stereomicroscope (Olympus magnifying
glass model SZ2-LGB) and an optical microscope (Olympus model CX41RF), both connected to digital cameras
(Olympus model NOC 7070). For histochemical tests,
sections of mycelial mats were checked by Fehling' Test
[70] to detect reduced sugars, by Sudan III solution [71] to
detect lipids and by Floroglucinol Acid solution [66] to
detect phenolic compounds.
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), samples were
fixed in FAA (5% formaldehyde; 5% acetic acid; 63% ethanol), and dehydrated in increasing acetone solutions (30
to 100%), for 15 min at each concentration. Sections were
dried to the critical point, mounted in stubs, and covered
with gold before SEM analysis (Model LEO 54× (Zeiss), at
the State University of Feira de Santana (Feira de Santana,
Bahia, Brazil).
Fungal strains, sampling, growth conditions for molecular
analysis and RNA isolation
M. perniciosa strain FA553 (Cp02), sequenced by the WBD
Genome Project [27] was used for macroarray and RTqPCR analyses. Growth conditions were described as
above except for some details: the chamber was a glass box
(40 × 30 × 30 cm) with hooks on the lid underside. Units
of mycelial mats were suspended on these hooks and
washed aseptically. Temperature and light were as mentioned above. Samples were collected in the different pigmentation phases: white, yellow, reddish-pink, reddishpink before stress and reddish-pink mycelium after stress
(10 d without irrigation); mycelium containing primordia, and basidiomata (Figure 1G). Individual samples of
CP02 were processed using the RNAeasy Plant Midi Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, USA). The RNA samples were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by denaturing formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis and optical density
was determined [72]. Aliquots of each sample were stored
at -80°C until analysis. Figure 1G summarizes sampling
for RNA extractions.
cDNA library construction and analysis of differential gene
expression by macroarray
The macroarray membrane was spotted with 192 cDNA
clones in duplicate, which were selected from a cDNA

opment in other fungi and their involvement in nutrient
depletion and cell signaling. For the cDNA library construction, the M. perniciosa strain CEPEC 1108 (CP03) was
cultured as previously described and mycelium samples in
white, yellow, reddish-pink, dark reddish pink and primordium stages, as well as from basidiomata were used to
construct a full-length, non-normalized cDNA library.
Total RNA was extracted from samples using RNAs in RNA
Plant Midi Kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen)
and after quantification, 1 μg was used to construct the
library using DB SMART Creator cDNA library as
described by the manufacturer (Clontech). cDNA strands
longer than 400 bp were cloned directionally into the
pDNR-LIB plasmid. ElectroMAX™ DH10BTM cells (Invitrogen) were transformed and colonies selected and grown
in 96-well microtiter plates in LB, 40% glycerol medium
containing 30 μg/L chloramphenicol and stored at -80°C.
A total of 2,759 clones were sequenced using a capillary
sequencer (Mega Bace 1000, GE Healthcare). After the filtering, trimming, and clustering processes the 1,533
obtained ESTs were evaluated based on functional annotation. The cDNA fragments used to spot the macroarray
membrane were amplified by PCR using M13 primers
[forward 5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3' and reverse 5'GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3'] that annealed to the vector
pDNR-LIB (Clontech), transferred in duplicate to membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) [72] and
fixed using a UV crosslinker (Spectronics Corporation).
For macroarray hybridization, two distinct RNA pools
were used: one cDNA mixture of three distinct biological
samples from the initial cultivation phases on artificial
media (white phase), and another cDNA mixture of three
distinct biological samples from the primordial stage. The
membrane was hybridized twice with each cDNA pool.
Labeling (400 ng of each cDNA pool), pre-hybridization
(4 h), hybridization (2.5 h) and signal detection were performed as recommended by the manufacturer of the Alkaphos kit (GE Healthcare). The membranes were exposed
to X-Omat (Kodak) film for 2.5 h and the images captured
using the Scanner Power Look 1120 UDS (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with BZ Scan [73]. The presence or
absence of the signal, as well as the intensity, was registered for each individual spot. Global normalization and
clustering of the generated intensities, using software
Cluster version 3.0 [74]. The default Cluster for normalization was performed eight times, with genes centralized
by average. A total clustering of genes was made by the
uncentered method (Pearson correlation). This value used
in hierarquical clustering represents the average intensity
of each gene. Student's t-test, was used after global standardization and before clustering to establish a comparison
between means. The values significant at 5% probability
and the genes accession numbers are shown in Table S1
[see Additional file 1] together with the fold change values

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/158

based on the means generated after normalization by
Cluster 3.0 software.
Quantitative analyses of reversed transcripts (RT-qPCR)
During the growth period in artificial medium, 12
selected genes were analyzed based on their expression
pattern derived from the macroarray. The following genes
were selected from the EST data base http://
www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/vassoura encoding the proteins:
three putative hemolysins (CP03-EB-001-020-G09-UE.F;
CP03-EB-001-008-C10-UE.F;
CP03-EB-001-024-G03UE.F), a putative 60S ribosomal L18 protein (CP03-EB001-001-E05-UE.F), a putative Rho1/GEF (CP03-EB-001012-F03-UE.F), a putative Rab (Ras family) (CP03-EB001-020-F11-UE.F), a putative multi-protein-bridging factor (CP03-EB-001-025-E06-UE.F), a putative Ras-GTPbinding protein Rhb1 (CP03-EB-001-005-E11-UE.F), a
putative glucose transporter (CP03-EB-001-015-G10UE.F), a putative cytochrome P450 (CP03-EB-001-025D09-UE.F), a putative adenylate cyclase (CP03-EB-001025-C05-UE.F), and a putative NADPH-cytochrome P450
reductase (CP03-EB-001-001-B10-UE.F). A putative polyubiquitin (CP03-EB-001-020-H08-UE.F) was used as reference gene. All PCR primers (MWG, Imprint Genetics
Corp) were designed using the GeneScript online RealTime Primer Design tool https://www.genscript.com/sslbin/app/primer [see Additional file 2]. One microgram of
total RNA treated with RQ1 DNAse I (Invitrogen) was
reverse-transcribed using Power Script (Invitrogen) at a
final volume of 20 μL. The primer Tm was set at 59°C to
61°C and the amplicon sizes ranging from 100 to 105 bp.
Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBRGreen® (Invitrogen) for the detection of fluorescence during amplification, and assays were performed on an ABI PRISM 7500
Sequence Detection System (SDS) coupled to the ABI
PRISM 7500 SDS software (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, USA), using standard settings. A 20 μL RT-PCR reaction consisted of 2 μL SYBRGreen 1× (Applied Biosciences), 1× PCR buffer, 200 mM dNTPs, 3 mM MgCl2,
1/2 50× Rox, 200 nM each primer and 10 μL singlestranded cDNA. The thermal cycling conditions were
50°C for 2 min, then 94°C for 10 min, followed by 40
cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 57°C for 35 s for annealing, and
72°C for 35 s. A dissociation analysis was conducted after
all amplifications to investigate the formation of primer
dimers and hairpins. Melting temperatures of the fragments were determined according to the manufacturer's
protocol. No-template reactions were included as negative
controls in every plate. Sequence Detection Software
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) results were
imported into Microsoft Excel for further analysis. Raw
expression levels were calculated from the average of the
triplicate ddCT (RQ) values using the standard curve
obtained for each primer pair (ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence

Detection System User Bulletin #2). A non-parametric t
test was performed in order to compare the expression values obtained for each gene between the samples.
Molecular analyses of aegerolysin genes
The two putative aegerolysin genes (MpPRIA1 and
MpPRIA2) and one putative pleurotolysin B (MpPLYB),
were analyzed by aligning ESTs and genomic sequences
using Clustal W (EBI) [75]. The contigs were screened for
conserved domains and for introns using ORFINDER software (NCBI-http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf).
The amino acid sequences generated from the most likely
ORFs were aligned against four sequences available at the
UNIPROT database [76] using Multalign [77]. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining
method [78]. The evolutionary distances were calculated
following the Poisson correction method [79] and
expressed in units of number of amino acid substitutions
per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data
were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion
option). There were a total of 116 positions in the final
dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4
[80]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in
less than 50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. The
percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa
clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is
shown next to the branches [81].
