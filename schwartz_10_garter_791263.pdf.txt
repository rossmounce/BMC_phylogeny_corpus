Abstract
Background: The reptiles, characterized by both diversity and unique evolutionary adaptations, provide a
comprehensive system for comparative studies of metabolism, physiology, and development. However, molecular
resources for ectothermic reptiles are severely limited, hampering our ability to study the genetic basis for many
evolutionarily important traits such as metabolic plasticity, extreme longevity, limblessness, venom, and freeze
tolerance. Here we use massively parallel sequencing (454 GS-FLX Titanium) to generate a transcriptome of the
western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) with two goals in mind. First, we develop a molecular
resource for an ectothermic reptile; and second, we use these sex-specific transcriptomes to identify differences in
the presence of expressed transcripts and potential genes of evolutionary interest.
Results: Using sex-specific pools of RNA (one pool for females, one pool for males) representing 7 tissue types and
35 diverse individuals, we produced 1.24 million sequence reads, which averaged 366 bp in length after cleaning.
Assembly of the cleaned reads from both sexes with NEWBLER and MIRA resulted in 96,379 contigs containing
87% of the cleaned reads. Over 34% of these contigs and 13% of the singletons were annotated based on
homology to previously identified proteins. From these homology assignments, additional clustering, and ORF
predictions, we estimate that this transcriptome contains ~13,000 unique genes that were previously identified in
other species and over 66,000 transcripts from unidentified protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we use a graphclustering method to identify contigs linked by NEWBLER-split reads that represent divergent alleles, gene
duplications, and alternatively spliced transcripts. Beyond gene identification, we identified 95,295 SNPs and 31,651
INDELs. From these sex-specific transcriptomes, we identified 190 genes that were only present in the mRNA
sequenced from one of the sexes (84 female-specific, 106 male-specific), and many highly variable genes of
evolutionary interest.
Conclusions: This is the first large-scale, multi-organ transcriptome for an ectothermic reptile. This resource
provides the most comprehensive set of EST sequences available for an individual ectothermic reptile species,
increasing the number of snake ESTs 50-fold. We have identified genes that appear to be under evolutionary
selection and those that are sex-specific. This resource will assist studies on gene expression and comparative
genomics, and will facilitate the study of evolutionarily important traits at the molecular level.

metabolism, physiology, development and aging [2].
Ectothermic reptiles (e.g. turtles, crocodilians, tuatara,
lizards, and snakes) exhibit extreme plasticity in their
ability to modulate their metabolism in response to
external stresses such as thermal and food stress [2-5].
Furthermore, they show extraordinary diversity in body
structure (e.g. turtle shells, squamate limblessness), sex
determining systems (e.g. temperature-dependent vs.

genotypic), and sexual dimorphism. Snakes, in particular, have evolved dramatic evolutionary adaptations (e.g.
venom, limblessness) and have been useful models for
evolution and ecology [6], but the pursuit to understand
these evolutionarily important traits at the molecular
level has been limited by the molecular resources
available. The heightened interest to utilize reptiles in
molecular genetic studies is signified by the first two
on-going ectothermic reptile genome projects (Anolis
lizard and painted turtle) conducted by NIH [7,8], and
the additional five ectothermic reptile genomes selected
to be sequenced by BGI [9]. As well, the recent publications of viper venom gland transcriptomes [10], and the
first ectothermic reptile linkage map (crocodile) [11]
emphasize that developing genomic resources for this
interesting group is of utmost importance. First glimpses
into the evolution of reptile genomes (endothermic and
ectothermic) have revealed unique genomic attributes
such as microchromosomes, the evolution of gene structure and gene synteny [12-14], as well as dramatic evolutionary changes in functionally important genes [15].
Ultimately we are interested in understanding how
reptiles use their genomes in sex-specific ways to
respond to environmental and evolutionary pressures,
and how these responses affect reproduction and aging.
A necessary first step is to develop and characterize
molecular resources for a species of interest. The main
focus of this paper is to develop a garter snake transcriptome so it can be used as a reference for future studies. The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis
elegans) is an emerging model for understanding the
molecular basis for the evolution of life-history tradeoffs between cellular maintenance and longevity versus
growth and reproduction [16]. Closely related populations of this species, found in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, harbor two ecotypes that contrast in physical
appearance, physiological and behavioural stress
response, natural lifespan, and reproductive traits. These
two ecotypes can be contrasted as either “fast-living” or
“slow-living” based on the overall life-history [17-20].
These ecotypes derive from both genetic and environmental differences [17], and selection acts strongly on
divergent traits despite low levels of gene flow among
these populations [21,22]. Additionally, males and
females have different costs associated with reproduction, which is expected to cause sexual conflict at the
genomic level. This conflict may be resolved through
differential regulation of how these sexually antagonistic
genes are utilized in each sex [23].
The paucity of molecular resources available for the
garter snake and other ectothermic reptile species has
limited our ability to identify the genetic basis for evolutionarily important traits, thus providing the inspiration
behind this project. The application of new sequencing

technologies, such as pyrosequencing, to traditional ecological models expands the horizon for ecological genomic studies [24-29]. Indeed, we are on the verge of
elucidating the genetic basis of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant traits in natural populations. Here we
apply this technology to develop a large scale, multi-tissue, multi-individual transcriptome using massively parallel sequencing with two goals in mind. Our first goal
is to develop a molecular resource for the garter snake
and make it available to the scientific community. This
resource is a generalized transcriptome (i.e., RNA was
pooled across ecotypes, populations, individuals, and tissues) for use as a reference for future studies. Our second goal is to identify sex-specific differences in the
presence/absence of expressed transcripts by identifying
transcripts that were present in the normalized library
of one of the sexes but not the other. These data are
accessible through the Garter Snake Transcriptome
Browser at Indiana University CGB https://lims.cgb.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/telegans_bronikowski_2/, the
Bronikowski Lab Data Server http://eco.bcb.iastate.edu/,
and through NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA010134).

Results and Discussion
Sampling and 454 GS-FLX Titanium Sequencing

Our goal in sampling was to maximize the identification
of unique transcripts, while capturing the diversity of
expressed transcripts across tissues, individuals, populations, and stress conditions. Therefore, keeping male
and female samples separate, we pooled RNA from 35
garter snakes (T. elegans) of varying sizes/ages (at least
1 year old) into two sex-specific RNA samples (sampling
details in Additional file 1). The snakes were both
laboratory-born and field-caught from seven focal populations of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California.
These sex-specific pools of RNA were used to develop
normalized cDNA libraries that were sequenced on
separate halves of a GS-FLX Titanium (Roche/454 Life
Sciences) PicoTitre plate. We also obtained an extra
quarter plate of male library reads for quality control
assessment. This resulted in 446 Mbp of sequence data,
1.24 million reads (i.e. expressed sequence tags) averaging 366 bp in length after cleaning (Table 1; see Additional file 2 for size distribution of reads). The cleaned
reads have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read
Archive (SRA010134).
Assembly and Annotation

The male and female reads were pooled for assembly,
but the sex-of-origin for each read was tracked, which
allowed contigs to be categorized as containing reads
from both sexes, from males only, or from females only
(Figure 1). Relative to the garter snake, the sequenced
(draft) genome closest in evolutionary relationship is the

Reads were discarded either due to redundancy (3461) or for quality control
by NEWBLER or MIRA during the assembly process (67,455 and 10
respectively).

Anolis lizard (Anolis carolinensis), which shared its most
recent common ancestor with snakes ~215 million years
ago [30]. The next evolutionarily closest species with a
sequenced genome is the chicken (Gallus gallus), which
shared its most recent common ancestor with snakes
~285 million years ago [31]. We used 454 gsMapper 2.3
to map the garter snake reads to the draft Anolis lizard
and the chicken genomes. Of cleaned reads, 773,997
(62%) and 536,900 (43%), respectively, were mapped,
even with the minimum percent identity of 80%. Those
mapped reads were assembled to 255,211 and 175,279
contigs for the lizard and chicken genomes, respectively.
For de novo assembly, reads were assembled using GS
de novo Assembler (NEWBLER v2.0.00.22; Roche)
resulting in 82,134 contigs - with 84% of the reads being
placed - with an average depth of 7.6× coverage (Table
1). We then used the program MIRA [32] for additional
assembly of the remaining singletons. This resulted in
33,338 singletons (25%) being assembled into an additional 14,245 contigs. The remaining singletons were
mapped to contigs in order to remove sequence

redundancy. Overall, 86.8% of reads were assembled
into 96,379 contigs with 7.5% of the reads remaining as
singletons, and 5.7% of reads being discarded (Table 1).
Because many more of the reads were place with the de
novo assembly, we use the de novo assembly for all subsequent analyses.
The percentage of reads assembled de novo is similar
to other studies that have applied pyrosequencing to
non-model organisms [25,27,33]. The large number of
contigs is likely due to the extensive diversity in the
initial RNA samples - pooled across individuals and
populations - in the form of sequence variants and alternative splicing. Different organs, different sexes, and different environmental/stress conditions are known to
produce extensive alternative spliced transcripts in vertebrates [34]. This variation causes misalignments
between reads arising from the same genomic region,
preventing correct assembly by most algorithms. For
this reason, NEWBLER was used for assembly because
it splits reads at the boundaries of variation in order to
build contigs reflecting both static and variable regions
[35] (see Additional file 3 for graphical representation of
Newbler-split reads and assembly).
The NEWBLER contigs, the MIRA contigs, and the
singletons were compared to three reference databases
for annotation using BlastX: NCBI non-redundant protein database (NR); NCBI HomoloGene; and UniGene
(Chicken). The sequences were also compared to the
18,031 Ensemble annotated genes (17,672 coding and
359 pseudogenes) from the Anolis lizard draft genome
(AnoCar1.0; http://uswest.ensembl.org/Anolis_carolinensis/) using tBLASTx. Over 24% of all sequences (contigs
and singletons) identified a homologue in at least one of
these reference databases at e-value 1e-5 (Figure 2: annotated data can be downloaded from http://eco.bcb.iastate.edu/). As expected with longer sequences, a higher
proportion of the contigs found an identity (34%) relative to the singletons (13%). Most of the contigs that
found an identity in one database were identified in all
four of the reference databases (Figure 2). This subset of
contigs likely contains the more conserved genes that
are well characterized and thus found in all of these
databases. The number of contigs matching a homologue is similar or higher to other sequencing studies on
non-model organisms [28,33].
The number of unique homologous genes identified in
each database ranged from 26,232 in NCBI-NR to
12,953 in UniGene (Chicken) (Table 2). The BlastX
results against the HomoloGene database and the Anolis
lizard Ensemble annotation likely give the most realistic
estimate of the number of unique genes in our dataset
for which we could assign a homology ID, approximately 13,000. Naturally, the more quickly evolving
genes and the snake-specific genes would be unlikely to

Figure 1 Flow diagram of the assembly procedure. Female and male normalized pools of cDNA were sequenced separately using Roche 454
GS-FLX Titanium chemistries. NEWBLER was initially used to assemble the cleaned reads into contigs that could be classified into three
categories based on the sex-of-origin of the reads: Female Contigs (FC, contigs made only from female reads); Male Contigs (MC, made only
from male reads); Both Contigs (BC, contigs made from both male and female reads). The remaining male and female singletons went through
additional assembly using MIRA. After each assembly process an attempt was made to map the remaining singletons to the contigs using Blast.
The contigs and singletons were clustered based on homology in the HomoloGene database or to the Ensemble annotated gene models from
the Anolis lizard draft genome (AnoCar1.0). The NEWBLER contigs were put into graph-clusters based how reads were split and assigned to
different contigs during the NEWBLER assembly process (see Additional file 3 for full description). In the graph-clusters the contigs (nodes) are
linked by reads (edges) that were split between the contigs.

find homologues in any of these databases. Thus,
undoubtedly, there are uncharacterized genes yet to be
discovered in the other 76% of the sequences for which
we could not assign an ID based on these reference
databases. ORF predictions indicate that an additional
97% of the non-annotated sequences had a predicted
open reading frame of at least 30 bp, which suggests
that these were transcribed from protein-coding genes.
The majority of the GO annotations assigned to the
snake sequences were for the biological processes of
metabolism and regulation, although there were also a
smaller number of sequences assigned to reproduction,
behaviour, and stress response (see Additional file 4 for
GO pie graphs).
Using tBlastX, 55,715 snake transcripts (contigs and

RNAs, these matches to the Anolis genome were compared to the matches to the AnoCar1.0 Ensemble annotation of coding (18,031) and non-coding (2939) RNA.
We identified 2322 snake transcripts that contained
5’UTR (286 matched to 5’UTR only, the rest matched
5’UTR along with protein coding sequence and/or intergenic sequence), and 3680 that contained 3’UTR (1018
matched to 3’UTR only, the rest matched 3’UTR along
with protein coding sequence and/or intergenic
sequence). Furthermore, 2,534 of our snake transcripts
matched the Anolis non-coding RNAs, and 36,188
matched other intergenic regions of the Anolis genome
and therefore may also be non-coding RNAs (see Additional file 5 to access these transcripts). A Snake Transcriptome Browser (GBrowse) of the snake transcripts
mapped against the Anolis draft genome (AnoCar1.0)
has been set up to visualize the data, and to access the
assembled and annotated data files https://lims.cgb.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/telegans_bronikowski_2/.
To check for additional non-coding RNAs, we used
RNAmmer 1.2 [36] and tRNAscan-SE 1.23 [37]. One
contig was predicted to be 8 S rRNA, although this was
not supported by the homology search through NCBI
non-redundant protein sequences. Thus, it is likely a
false prediction. Five singletons were identified as
tRNAs: two sequences for tRNAAsp , one for tRNAHis,
one for tRNALys, and one sequence for tRNASer. Additionally, pseudogenes were predicted from 5 contigs and
11 singletons.
Phylogenetic assessment of BLAST results

We use the phylogenetic distribution of the Blast hits to
identify off-target sequences and as a qualitative assessment of the assembly. Because we indiscriminately used
all RNA isolated from six tissue types and blood, which
would contain disease and commensal organisms, we
expected our dataset to contain off-target species
sequences that did not originate from the garter snake
genome. To identify these off-target sequences we used
the metagenomics program MEGAN [38]. MEGAN
assigns a sequence to the lowest common ancestor of
all its Blast assignments at a particular cut-off e-value.
Thus sequences placed at the deeper nodes of the phylogeny represent more conserved genes relative to the
genes on the leaves the tree that are more specific to
that species. We used the output from BlastX (e-value
= 1e-5) against the NCBI-NR for the contigs and singletons (categorized based on sex-of-origin) to map the
hits on the NCBI taxonomic tree (Figure 3). We identified 979 sequences (0.5% of the dataset) that were likely
from off-target species including 51 that assigned to
bacteria, 135 that assigned to viruses, and 11 that
assigned to fungi. Interestingly, there was a bias towards
bacterial sequences originating from the male reads

suggesting the possibility that one or more of the males
in our sample may have had a high bacterial infection
load.
Equal proportions of sex-specific contigs and singletons were assigned to the nodes of the taxonomic tree,
which implies that our ability to map to NCBI was not
biased towards one or the other sex (Figure 3). Overall,
88% of the assigned sequences were assigned to chordates or a lineage within chordates; and 62% were
assigned to tetrapods or a lineage within tetrapods
(Figure 3). The placement of sequences at a particular
node is highly dependent upon the relative abundance
(or presence) of sequences available in NCBI-NR from
each taxonomic group. Although there are far fewer
protein sequences from reptiles (Sauropsida) in NCBINR compared to mammals (Mammalia), both lineages
had roughly equal number of genes assigned within
them. The species with the most number of genes
matched was Gallus gallus (chicken), which is the evolutionarily closest species with a completed genome in the
NCBI-NR protein database.
As an additional evaluation of the quality of our
assembly and sequencing, we identified potential chimeric sequences that are made-up of two unique

sequences that have been concatenated such that the
sequence had two highly significant (< 1e-20) NCBI-NR
hits to different genes, which aligned to different ends
of the contig or singleton. We identified 24 contigs and
2 singletons that had such signatures (i.e., representing
< 0.025%). Of these, two of the contigs were adjacent
mitochondrial genes representing a correct assembly as
the mitochondrial genome is known to be transcribed in
large multi-gene segments [39]. The other 22 contigs
and 2 singletons seemed to be true chimeras based on
visual inspection of the BlastX hits. These chimeric
sequences could be due to misassembly, chimerization
during the library construction, true biological gene
fusion events, or errors in GenBank. Overall, the phylogenetic distribution of the BlastX hits and the low percentage of chimera sequences provide qualitative
support for our assembly.
Additional clustering

Complex vertebrate transcriptomes are characterized by
numerous alternatively spliced transcripts and transcripts from duplicated genes [34,40] making de novo
assembly difficult. We used two methods for additional
clustering of the contigs and singletons into reference

Schwartz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:694
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/694

gene sets: clustering based on homology, and clustering
based on contig-graphs (Figure 1). Homology clustering
uses BlastX against reference databases to group contigs
and singletons into clusters that are likely to have originated from the same gene. Homology clustering of contigs and singletons based on the HomoloGene database
produced 8771 - 13,346 homology clusters, depending
on the e-value cut-off used (Table 2). At e-value 1e-20,
each of these homology clusters contained 1 to 93 contigs with an average of two contigs (see Additional file 6
Panels A and B for distributions of contigs and clusters).
Additionally, ~2000 of the contigs assigned to two or
more homology clusters (HomoloGene accession); these
contigs likely belong to gene families or are contigs with
a strong domain found in multiple HomoloGenes. For
example, contig00258 assigned to four HomoloGene
clusters, each of which contains an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 catalytic domain (UBCc). Homology

genome had a smaller range of minimal gene sets
(Table 2). These homology clusters contain contigs and
singletons that represent alternative alleles, alternatively
spliced transcripts, and non-overlapping contigs from
the same gene and possibly closely related genes in the
same family (particularly at the lower e-value).
Output clusters from the contig-graphing approach
were used to group NEWBLER-generated contigs based
on read-assembly information (see methods and Additional file 3 for a complete description). For alternatively
spliced transcripts, highly diverged alleles and repeat
regions of duplicated genes, NEWBLER (454 GS Assembler) splits reads into separate contigs. During assembly,
split reads are tracked and that information can be used
to reconstruct how contigs may be related. This can be
illustrated graphically using networks (i.e. graph-clusters) such that nodes in the graphs represent contigs
and an edge between two nodes represents a read split
between two contigs. This clustering is independent of
the contigs’ homology to other databases, and allows for
further identification of divergent alleles, alternatively
spliced transcripts, and gene families based on the structure of the network and nucleotide similarity of the contigs in the network (see Additional file 3 for more
details of this method). We constructed 6,860 graph
contig clusters containing 27,860 NEWBLER contigs.
The graph-clusters contained on average four contigs
(range 2-95) (see Additional file 6 panel C for distribution of contigs in graph-clusters). This clustering
method can be used to further merge variable alleles of
the same gene, construct alternatively spliced
transcripts, and identify gene families. Within these
graph-clusters, we identified 554 components that are
predicted to represent highly divergent alleles of the
same gene that can then be merged, 1,293 components

that are predicted to represent alternative splicing events,
and 158 components (pairs of duplicated contigs) that
are predicted to represent duplicated genes (Figure 4).
Evaluating the BlastX NCBI-NR results of the contigs
within each graph-cluster component revealed differences among the classes of components. As you would
expect from alleles of the same gene, all the contigs
from merged components (highly variable alleles of the
same gene) were more likely to match the same gene in
NCBI-NR than were contigs from alternatively spliced
or duplicated gene components. Likewise, contigs in the
158 duplicated gene components were more likely to
match different genes in NCBI-NR than either the
merged components or the alternative spliced components (Figure 4).
As an example of the usefulness of this graph-clustering method, we highlight graph-cluster05625 (Figure 5)
that consists of 27 contigs, of which nine contigs have
identical hits in NCIB-NR, three contigs have different
hits in NCBI-NR, and 15 contigs have no hits in NCBINR. Ten of these NCBI-NR matches are to the hypervariable immunological gene MHC class I, which is well
documented as being under diversifying selection in
other species [41]. This clustering method allowed us to
identify additional contigs (not identified by our homology searches) that represent multiple alleles, alternatively
spliced transcripts and a potential gene duplication
event for a highly important immunological gene
complex.
Sequence variants

One of our goals for including diverse individuals from
multiple populations was to identify sequence variants
(SNPs and INDELS) that would be useful in future studies. At a Bayesian probability of 90% we identified
126,946 variants: 95,295 SNPs and 31,651 INDELs in
either single contigs (23,615) or across contigs that had
been merged into graph-clusters (549). Over 110,000 of
these variants had >99% probability of being a true variant rather than a sequencing error. Of the single contigs that had variants, the average number of variants
per contig is 5.16 (SNPs = 3.84, INDELs = 1.32); with
an average rate of one variant per 200 bp window (see
Additional file 7 for details on variants). The number of
variants (SNPs and INDELs) per contig had a weak but
significant correlation with contig length (F = 1980, DF
= 23,615, R2 = 0.07, p-value < 0.01: Figure 6 panel A),
with the scatter suggesting that some contigs represented highly conserved genes with low variation and
some contigs with high levels of variation for contig
length.
The degree and type of variability within a contig can
indicate selection acting on the gene. As expected, large
contigs with few variants tended to be from highly

conserved genes including, MACF1 (microtubule-actin
cross-linking factor 1), and myosin. We identified 236
contigs that were highly variable (in the 99th percentile
for highest ratio of variants per contig length) and, as
expected of quickly evolving genes, few of these (19%)
had homology hits in the BlastX searches, but 98% of
them had predicted open reading frames (ORF) larger
than 30 bp. This size criterion suggests that the ORFs
were within true protein coding sequences. Of the 45
contigs that were highly variable and had a BlastX hit in
NCBI-NR, at least 8 were from off-target sequences and
11 were associated with transposable elements, but
there were also many sequences of interest that are
known to be hypervariable and/or quickly evolving in

vertebrate taxa. These included three immunological
genes (MHC class I, complement factor-H related protein, interferon regulatory factor 7), a snake venom gene
(venom factor 1), and a predicted pheromone receptor
(see Additional file 8 for full annotation data on these
genes of interest). Interestingly, there were also two
highly variable genes involved in lipid metabolism or
lipid oxidation: peroxisomal long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase, and fatty acid desaturase 1. These genes may be
particularly relevant for future studies on the evolution
of metabolism and stress response in these garter snake
populations.
Mutations to a nucleotide of a similar structure (i.e.,
TS: transitions - mutations from a purine to a purine,

or from a pyrimadine to a pyrimidine) occur more often
then transversions (TV: mutation from a purine to a
pyrimadine or vice-versa). Thus, a TS/TV ratio <1 may
reveal sequences subjected to diversifying selection [42].
We found 73, 836 TSs and 21, 459 TVs in this dataset.
We identified 2, 165 contigs with a TS/TV <1. For SNPs
within predicted coding regions, we determined whether
they were non-synonymous polymorphisms (Ka) that
changed the amino acid, or were synonymous polymorphisms (Ks). Overall, 29, 883 of the SNPs found in a
coding region were non-synonymous and 23, 252 were
synonymous. We found 8, 417 contigs (8.7% of all contigs) with a Ka/Ks ratio >1. This indicates that mutation
(s) have changed the amino acid sequence more than
would be expected under a neutral model, and that
these genes may be under diversifying selection within
or among these snake populations. The distributions of
TS/TV and Ka/Ks are in Figure 6A. Of most interest are
the 16 contigs at the intersection of Ka/Ks >1, TS/TV
<1, and the 99th percentile of highly variable contigs.
Only three of these could be assigned a putative identification based on homology: the immune complement
factor-H related protein, fatty acid desaturase 1, and a
KRAB transcription factor. Revisiting the MHC class I
graph-cluster05625 (Figure 5) that consists of 27 contigs,
of the 20 contigs had variants 10 had Ka/Ks > 1. As predicted above, this further supports diversifying selection
across this complex. Additional highly variable genes
with high Ka/Ks ratios are likely to be targets of

diversifying selection, potentially diversifying across the
populations (or ecotypes) of the garter snakes.
Comparison between female and male

When the male and female reads were pooled and
assembled into contigs, each read was tracked by the
sex from which it was generated. Thus, the contigs and
singletons could be classified on the origin of its reads.
Focusing only on the sequences for which we could
assign an ID based on homology, NCBI-NR BlastX hits
(1e-50) were summarized based on whether they were
unique to females (i.e., found only in female contigs
and/or female singletons), were unique to males, or
were composed of reads from both sexes. In this way
we identified 190 genes (195 contigs) that were only
present in the mRNA sequenced from one of the sexes
(see Additional file 8 for full annotation data on these
genes of interest). Of these 190 genes, 84 were expressed
only in females and 106 were expressed only in males.
While this is a relatively low number of genes that are
sex-specific, recall that our sex-specific pools of RNA
included seven tissue types and were normalized in
order to maximize the number of unique transcripts.
Therefore, these data are not quantitative differences in
expression in a particular tissue type, but are presence/
absence data across all seven tissues. Most other studies
that look at sex-specific differences use microarrays (or
RNA-seq) on non-normalized libraries from a particular
tissue and thus have quantitative data to show difference

Schwartz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:694
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/694

in the levels of expression between the sexes. Indeed it
is at the quantitative level that most genes are biased in
their expression between the sexes [43]. Additionally,
most genes that are biased in their expression between
sexes are specific to a particular tissue. For example, a
microarray study on chicken brain, gonad, and heart,
identified ~13, 000 genes that had quantitative differences in one particular tissue, but only four genes were
significantly different in all three tissues [44]. As well,
sex-specific genes are typically quickly evolving; thus,
homologues may not be present in the available databases [43].
The female-specific sequences were enriched for GO
terms for “biosynthetic processes” relative to the malespecific sequences (FDR < 0.006, p-value < 0.0002: see
Additional file 9 for distribution of GO terms by sex).
Although many of these sex-specific genes were uncharacterized or classified as “predicted coding genes”, some
met our expectations for being sex-specific. For example, two of the male-specific genes are known to be
involved in spermatogenesis (SPATA18, SPATA22) and
two in sperm motility (CATSPERG, CATSPER2). Additionally, two female-specific genes are known to be
involved in hormonal signalling and regulation (GnRH
receptor and Irg1) [45-47]. Five of these 190 sex-specific
genes also had a TS/TV ratio ≤ 1, male-specific:
BTBD16, CATSPERG, CATSPER2; and female-specific:
RAG1 and CDX4. Additionally, 13 of the sex-specific
genes had a Ka/Ks ratio > 1, three of these overlapped
with those that had a low TS/TV: male-specific CATSPERG, female specific CDX4 (also on the human X
chromosome), and female specific RAG1.
These analyses suggest the CATSPER genes maybe
under strong selective pressure. The CATSPER genes
(1-4) produce proteins that form an ion channel that is
specific to the sperm flagellum, and are required for
hyperactivated motility during the fertilization process
[48-50]. Mutations in the CATSPER genes cause infertility in mice and humans [49-51]. The CATSPERG
gene encodes an additional protein that is associated
with the CATSPER ion channel [52]. As with many
reptiles, garter snakes mate multiply and have multiple
paternity litters [53], which could lead to sperm competition and selective pressure on sperm function and
motility. Further studies are needed to test the role of
diversity in the CATSPER genes in reproductive fitness
and sperm competition in this snake system. Although
we hypothesize that these male-specific genes associated with sperm production and fertilization are
being expressed in the gonads, we cannot address the
question of tissue-of-origin with these data at this
time. However, we are currently looking at geneexpression differences in individual-based and tissuespecific libraries.

Both snakes and birds have ZW/ZZ sex chromosomes,
in which the female is the heterogametic sex. The
chicken and snake are separated by ~285 million years
and it has been well documented that reptile sex chromosomes have undergone drastic rearrangements over
that time [54]. Therefore, whether any snake sequences
aligned to the chicken sex chromosomes would be a
very interesting result. Indeed, the snake sequences
aligned to 15 genes on the chicken Z chromosome.
Interestingly, four of these had female-specific expression and two had male-specific expression (see Additional file 8 for full annotation data of these genes of
interest). It remains to be determined whether these
genes reside on the garter snake Z (or W) chromosome.
Equally interesting is that one gene known to be on the
human X chromosome, CDX4, had female specific
expression, had a TS/TV < 1, and a Ka/Ks > 1 suggesting it may be a sex-conflict gene that is quickly evolving
in these snake populations.
Because the cDNA libraries used for sequencing were
normalized, the identification of sex-specifically
expressed genes is based on presence/absence rather
than quantitative measures. Some of the genes identified
here as sex-specific genes are likely under sex-biased
expression, potentially the result of sex conflict resolved
at the level of gene expression. Additionally, some of
these sex-specific genes may reside on the garter snake
sex chromosomes. Additional large-scale studies at the
quantitative level will verify the sex-specific expression
of these genes.

Conclusions
We have successfully sequenced the first large-scale,
multi-organ transcriptome for an ectothermic vertebrate
using pyrosequencing and de novo assembly. In the process, we use a method for graphically clustering contigs
after NEWBLER assembly that allowed us to identify
divergent alleles, alternatively spliced transcripts and
gene families. We have identified a number of interesting genes that are sex-specifically expressed and/or that
are predicted to be quickly evolving that beg for additional investigation. These are the starting points for
genetic studies on evolution of metabolic and immune
function, sexual conflict resolution, as well as the evolution of sex chromosomes.
This transcriptome is the most comprehensive set of
published EST sequences available for an individual
ectothermic reptile species. It has increased the number
of nucleotide ESTs available for ectothermic reptiles 5×,
and for snakes 50×. Additionally, we have identified
over 100, 000 high confidence variants (SNPs and
INDELs) that can be used for population genetic studies,
and quantitative trait mapping in this and related
species.

Schwartz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:694

These sequence data are a tool for future gene expression experiments, and comparative transcriptomic,
genomic, and metabolomic studies. They can assist
interested researchers to address evolutionary- and ecological-genomic questions in this and other reptile species. Ongoing and future studies can use this
generalized transcriptome as a reference for mapping
quantitative expression and sequence data from experiments that use, for example, short-read sequencing
technologies. By combining these new sequencing technologies our labs hope to gain insight into how these
snake life-history ecotypes have evolved, as well as how
sex-conflict genes evolve. Overall, this is a valuable
resource for the study of evolutionary important traits
at the molecular level.

Methods
Sampling

A total of 35 western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) individuals of varying sizes/ages (at least 1
year old) were included in this transcriptome (17
females and 18 males: see Additional file 1 for details on
sampling). The snakes were either laboratory-born and
raised or field-caught from seven populations at the
northern end of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Lassen
County, California, which included the two life-history
ecotypes as has been previously described [2,18,55].
Adult field-caught snakes were shipped live to Iowa
State University. The laboratory snakes were 2-year old
animals that had been used in a thermal experiment.
Within 10 minutes of euthanizing, all organs and blood
were either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-80°C, or put in RNA-later and kept at room temperature for 24 hours and then stored at -20°C. Organs
included brain, gonads (from sexually mature individuals), heart, kidney, liver, spleen and blood (ISU
IACUC 3-2-5125-J).
RNA isolation

Individual snake samples were pooled by tissue type and
by sex for total RNA isolation using TriReagent and
cleaned-up using Qiagen RNAeasy columns. The TriReagent manufacture’s protocol was followed, but instead
of precipitating the RNA, the supernatant from the
chloroform step was added (0.75:1) to the RLT/BME
buffer from the Qiagen RNAeasy kit. From this point on
the Qiagen protocol was followed. Quality of the RNA
was verified with a Bioanalyzer nanochip (Agilent).
Total RNA quantity was determined by both the Bioanalyzer nanochip and a Nanodrop. RNA from each tissue type was pooled in equal amounts into their
respective Male and Female samples, and concentrations
determined by fluorometry using Quant-iT OliGreen
(Invitrogen).

Library preparation and sequencing

Library preparations for GS FLX Titanium (Roche/454
Life Sciences) sequencing were developed in the Center
for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Indiana University
based partially on methods for use in GS FLX standard
sequencing described in Meyer et al. [25], with modifications (K. Mockaitis, unpublished). Briefly, cDNA was
synthesized from 630 ng of each total RNA pool (male,
female) in a manner similar to Clontech™SMART protocols, using primers optimized for the 454 sequencing
process, and amplified by PCR to generate dsDNA. For
partial normalization to reduce sequence coverage of
high copy number transcripts, amplified cDNA was subjected to controlled in-solution hybridization and double-stranded nuclease (DSN) digestion using the
Trimmer Direct kit (Evrogen) after reaction optimization. Normalized DNA was then fragmented by sonication, and ends enzymatically blunted and ligated to
customized 454 adaptors. Amplification of ligation products exploited adaptor-mediated PCR suppression [25].
This method induces homo-adapted fragment hairpins,
thereby severely limiting amplification of mis-ligated
products. All amplification steps utilized high-fidelity
polymerases. Final libraries were size selected by excision of the 500-800 bp fraction from agarose gels.
Emulsion PCR reactions were performed according to
the manufacturer (Roche/454 Life Sciences). To optimize pyrosequencing throughput, prior to sequencing
final libraries were titrated by emulsion PCR bead
enrichment. Sequencing of male and female libraries
was performed in parallel on a picotitre plate according
to the manufacturer, and yielded 259 Mb (male) and
219 Mb (female) of sequence data in 1, 291869 reads
with an average of 386 nts in length.
Sequencing adapters (A and B) were automatically
removed from the reads using the signal processing software (Roche/454 Life Sciences). The reads were further
cleaned and the adaptors removed by a program developed in-house at CGB, Indiana University http://sourceforge.net/projects/estclean/. After cleaning, sequences
≤30 bp were removed from the dataset. Thus the final
cleaned dataset before assembly contained 1, 238, 280
reads with an average length of 366 nts (Table 1).
Assembly and annotation

The pooled reads were mapped to the lizard and
chicken genomes using the GS mapper v2.3 with 80%
identity. For de novo assembly, the reads were assembled
into contigs using the GS de novo assembler (NEWBLER v2.0.00.22, Roche/454 Life Sciences) with the
default parameters (40 bp overlap; 90% identity), resulting in 82, 134 contigs and 134, 971 singletons (Table 1).
We found that some singletons could be aligned to the
contigs with 95% percent identity through the entire

Schwartz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:694
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/694

region except less than 10 bp from both 5’ and 3’ ends.
We used Blast to map 5407 singletons to 2471 NEWBLER contigs. An additional attempt was made to
assemble the remaining singletons using MIRA [32].
The recommended parameters for 454 reads were used,
resulting in additional 14, 245 contigs and 93, 000 singletons remaining. Of these singletons, 339 reads were
mapped to 380 contigs. Therefore, the final number of
singletons is 92, 561 (Table 1).
For gene identification, contigs were compared to
NCBI-NR protein database, HomoloGene, UniGene
(Chicken) [56] databases using BlastX and tBlastX with
cut-off e-values of 1e-5, 1e-10, 1e-20 and 1e-50. Databases
accessed in January 2010 were used for these analyses.
Additionally the contigs were mapped to the draft Anolis lizard genome (AnoCar1.0) [8] and Ensemble annotated gene models using tBLATx and BlastX. Open
reading frames (ORFs) were predicted using OrfPredictor [57] with the NR BLAST hits and NCBI’s ORF Finder. Databases accessed in August 2010 were used for
these analyses.
The NCBI-NR BlastX hits (e-value = 1e -5 ) for the
NEWBLER contigs, MIRA contigs, and singletons were
used with the program MEGAN [38] to map the
sequences to the NCBI taxonomy (databases accessed
on January 2010 for BlastX and February 2010 for taxonomy). Sequences that were assigned to the very tips
of the branches outside of Chordata were considered to
have originated from off-target species (i.e., not from T.
elegans). MEGAN was used to evaluate the GO annotation (GO Slim) assigned to each term (as of February
2010).
Additional clustering

We used two methods for additional clustering: homology clustering, and a newly developed method we refer
to as graph-clustering or contig-graphs (Figure 1).
Homology clustering is the grouping of singletons and
contigs based on their BlastX hits in HomoloGene, and
the draft lizard gene models (AnoCar1.0). The homology
clustering was based on four different cut-off e-values:
1e-5, 1e-10, 1e-20 and 1e-50
The graph-clusters were assembled independent of
any comparisons to other databases, but rather solely
dependent on the information derived from the original reads. The GS de novo (NEWBLER, Roche/454 Life
Sciences) assembly program is set up to allow for
improved contig alignments when there is abundant
alternatively spliced transcripts and gene duplication
events by allowing reads to be split into two and each
portion assigned to a different contig. We have developed a clustering method based on graph theory that
uses this ‘historical’ information on how the reads
were split and assigned into contigs (see Additional file

Page 14 of 17

3 for full description). The underlying algorithm clusters contigs into network graphs where the contigs
represent the nodes and the split reads are the edges.
These graph-clusters can contain components that
represent 1) a single gene with divergent alleles, 2) a
single gene with alternatively spliced transcripts, 3)
closely related genes within a gene family (gene duplications), or 4) any combination of the three (Additional file 3). In the case of alternatively-spliced
transcripts, the nodes indicate exons, and the edges
indicate the combinations of how these exons connect
in the different transcripts (transcriptional paths).
These exons could not be merged further based on
similarity to each other. In the case of duplicated
genes, parts of the transcripts were highly similar and
merged into the same contig, but reads covering the
regions of the duplicated genes that have diverged
were split into different contigs (nodes). These nodes
representing the diverged regions of the duplicated
genes were still quite similar (assuming >80% but <
95% sequence identity). This similarity is used to distinguish if a contig-graph represents an alternativelyspliced gene or duplicated genes. Contig-graphs representing divergent alleles from the same gene are distinguished from duplicated genes by assuming that the
alleles have > 95% sequence identity (see Additional
file 3 for more details on the graph-clustering method).
For each component within a graph-cluster, the BlastX
results for its contigs were summarized in order to classify the component into one of five categories. 1) None
of the contigs had a homology hit; 2) some of the contigs had a homology hit, but to different files in NCBI;
3) some of the contigs had a homology hit, and they
were to the identical file in NCBI; 4) all of the contigs
had a homology hit, but to different files in NCBI; 5) all
of the contigs had a homology hit, and they were all to
the identical file in NCBI. These were summarized for
each type of component.
Sequence variants

Sequence variants (SNPs and INDELs) were identified
and their probability of being a ‘true’ variant based on
Bayesian analysis using the program GIGABAYES
[58,59]. Since NEWBLER aligns reads allowing gaps
instead of substitutions, sequence variant callers cannot
identify SNPs and INDELs accurately. MOSAIK [60]
was used to realign reads against contigs. Because
homopolymer errors are more prevalent with 454
sequences than ABI sequences, this has to be taken into
account when calculating probabilities. INDELs called
by GIGABAYES were filtered out if they were in homopolymer regions. For high confident sequence variants,
we filtered out SNPs and INDELs with read coverage
< 5 or > 100 and the probability < 0.9.

The relationship between the number of variants per
length of the contig was tested using a regression analysis in R. Contigs in the 99th percentile of number of variants/contig length were considered highly variable. The
ratio between transitions and transversions ((TS + 1)/
(TV+ 1)) was calculated for each contigs containing
SNPs. The one is added to allow the ratio to be calculated for contigs that had a zero for either TS or TV
values. For each contig-containing SNP, for which we
had a predicted ORF, we calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) polymorphisms
((Ka + 1)/(Ks+ 1)). (python script available at http://eco.

Comparisons between female and male

The sex-of-origin of each read was tracked through the
assembly so that the contigs could be classified as being a
“female” contig (only containing female reads), a “male”
contig (only containing male reads), or a “both” contig
(containing both male and female reads) (Figure 1). To
identify genes that are expressed by only one of the sexes,
we compared the BlastX for each contigs and singleton.
For example, if a BlastX hit was found in only female
contigs and/or female singletons, and had no homology
to male contigs or male singletons at e-values down to
1e-50, then it was classified as female-specific. The same
process was used to identify male-specific genes. These
190 genes were compared to RefSeq for all vertebrates.
Their GO slim assignments for Biological Processes were
statistically compared in Blast2Go to test for enrichment
of particular GO terms using Fisher’s Exact Test.

Additional file 1: Table containing details of the samples used for
the sex-specific RNA pools. Tissue samples of the same type were
pooled across individuals (either laboratory or field born animals) for
total RNA extraction. Extracted pools of RNA were quantified and the
quality checked on the Bioanalyzer. Equal amounts of RNA from each
tissue type were pooled by sex.
