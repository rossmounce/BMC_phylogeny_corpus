Abstract
Background: There is accumulating evidence that polymorphism in Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes might
be associated with disease resistance or susceptibility traits in livestock. Polymorphic sites affecting TLR
function should exhibit signatures of positive selection, identified as a high ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous nucleotide substitutions (ω). Phylogeny based models of codon substitution based on
estimates of ω for each amino acid position can therefore offer a valuable tool to predict sites of functional
relevance. We have used this approach to identify such polymorphic sites within the bovine TLR2 genes
from ten Bos indicus and Bos taurus cattle breeds. By analysing TLR2 gene phylogeny in a set of mammalian
species and a subset of ruminant species we have estimated the selective pressure on individual sites and
domains and identified polymorphisms at sites of putative functional importance.
Results: The ω were highest in the mammalian TLR2 domains thought to be responsible for ligand binding
and lowest in regions responsible for heterodimerisation with other TLR-related molecules. Several
positively-selected sites were detected in or around ligand-binding domains. However a comparison of the
ruminant subset of TLR2 sequences with the whole mammalian set of sequences revealed that there has
been less selective pressure among ruminants than in mammals as a whole. This suggests that there have
been functional changes during ruminant evolution. Twenty newly-discovered non-synonymous
polymorphic sites were identified in cattle. Three of them were localised at positions shaped by positive
selection in the ruminant dataset (Leu227Phe, His305Pro, His326Gln) and in domains involved in the
recognition of ligands. His326Gln is of particular interest as it consists of an exchange of differentiallycharged amino acids at a position which has previously been shown to be crucial for ligand binding in
human TLR2.
Conclusion: Within bovine TLR2, polymorphisms at amino acid positions 227, 305 and 326 map to
functionally important sites of TLR2 and should be considered as candidate SNPs for immune related traits
in cattle. A final proof of their functional relevance requires further studies to determine their functional
effect on the immune response after stimulation with relevant ligands and/or their association with
immune related traits in animals.

Background
The innate immune system is the first line of host defence
against pathogens and is activated by host recognition of
conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs). These engage families of pattern-recognition
receptors (PRRs) that include the Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) [1]. The TLRs form an ancient gene group which is
found in invertebrates and vertebrates and there are
related genes in plants [2]. In vertebrates, six TLR families
of common ancestry and similar recognition patterns
have been identified. The TLR1 family consists of TLR1, 2,
6 and 10 and is involved in the recognition of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [3]. TLR1 and 6 form heterodimers with TLR2, a crucial process for identification
of several PAMPs [4,5]. TLR2 recognises both tri- and diacylated lipopeptides whereas TLR1 and TLR6 recognise
tri- and di-acylated lipopeptides, respectively [4,6,7]. In
mammals at least ten of these TLR genes have been
described, each binding different PAMPs representing a
wide range of pathogens.
The TLRs consist of a large extracellular domain responsible for PAMP binding, a transmembrane domain and an
intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain
which binds signalling molecules and initiates innate cellular immune responses [8].
The extracellular domains are composed of approximately
20 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), motifs of 20–30 amino
acids (AA) in length, forming a solenoid shape and potentially binding the TLR specific patterns. TLR2 binds its ligands either on its concave or convex surfaces [9].
The concave surface is formed by a highly conserved segment (HCS) consisting of 11 or 12 AA, normally following a pattern LxxLxLxxNxL or LxxLxLxxCxxL. The convex
side is shaped by α-helical elements from the AAs of the
variable segment (VS) [10,11]. The TIR domain interacts
with adapter proteins that direct the intracellular signalling cascade after TLR-PAMP engagement. Substitutions
within the TIR domain, particularly in the BB loop have
been shown to impact on receptor signalling [12], while
mutagenesis of the DD loop identified residues essential
for TLR1/2 dimerisation [13].
Due to their central role in host defence, polymorphisms
within TLR genes are associated with predisposition to a
range of diseases in humans and mice. Accumulating evidence suggests that polymorphism in TLR genes is also
associated with variations in disease resistance traits in
livestock [14,15]. An Arg753Gln polymorphism in TLR2
has been associated with a predisposition to staphylococcal infection [16], tuberculosis [17], rheumatic fever [18]
and urinary tract infection in children [19]. TLRs are
under strong selection for both maintenance and adapta-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/288

tion of function [3]. The intracellular TIR domain is highly
conserved with functional similarity among species and
TLR genes, as it is involved in engaging signalling pathways within cells [20]. However, the extracellular TLR
domains exhibit significantly-higher divergence reflecting
their involvement in PAMP recognition from multiple
microbial sources. Amino acid changes are concentrated
in the region between LRR10 and LRR15, that is important for PAMP ligand binding [21]. TLR1 and TLR6 phylogeny is also driven by co-evolution caused by gene
conversion which could also affect their heterodimerisation [22].
Protein evolution is shaped by divergent selection pressures on sites of different functional relevance. This process can be reproduced by phylogeny-based models of
codon substitution which are based on a site-by-site analysis of the non-synonymous (dN)/synonymous (dS) substitution ratio (ω) between sequences [23,24]. In many
cases protein function is maintained against occurring disadvantageous mutations by purifying selection resulting
in high conservation of such sites or domains (ω < 1). In
contrast, the adaptive evolution of protein function can be
driven by positive selection of advantageous mutations at
functionally-important sites (ω > 1). This has been
observed in genes involved in immune responses to pathogens, not just particularly the MHC complex [25], but
also in Toll-like receptor genes [26].
Such phylogeny-based models can offer a valuable tool to
predict sites of putative functional relevance [27-29].
However, it is also possible that sites with high ω might
reflect ancient adaptive selection and the functional relevance of certain sites could have changed with the adaptation process [30].
In this study, we take advantage of a phylogeny based
approach to identify bovine TLR2 polymorphisms
revealed by analysing the gene in ten predominant Bos
indicus and Bos taurus cattle breeds. Through the analysis
of the TLR2 phylogeny in a set of mammalian species we
will estimate the selective pressure on individual bovine
TLR2 sites and domains. To detect variations in selective
constraint during evolution caused by possible functional
changes we will compare our results with a subset of TLR2
sequences from ruminants only.

Results
TLR2 sequences and domain structure
The length of the predicted TLR2 proteins in all species
analysed ranged between 784 – 786 AAs. In all species,
TLR2 shared a common domain architecture: an extra-cellular domain containing 20 Leucine Rich Repeats between
AA54 and AA584, a transmembrane domain at AA585–
AA607 and an intracellular TIR domain at AA633–AA783.

Selective constraint and sequence conservation
In some domains of TLR2 sequence variation (corrected
entropy, see additional file 1: Comparative plot of the
average corrected entropy of a 50 AA sliding window
along the protein sequence) was high, particularly in the
region between AA200 and AA310, comprising LRR 7–10.
Most of the other domains were more conserved, particularly LRR 12 and LRR 13 (AA340–AA390) and the TIR
domain (AA610-end).

To interpret these results with respect to domain and AAspecific selective constraint, the sequences were subjected
to Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood
(PAML). The average ω over the whole TLR2 protein using
data from all the mammalian sequences was 0.45. The
model assigned all AA sites into three classes of 461, 206
and 120 sites with an average ω of: 0.05 (class1: low ω,
purifying selection), 0.61 (class 2: intermediate ω, nearly

neutral), 1.70 (class 3: high ω, potentially positive selection) and average probabilities for the class allocation of
0.96, 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. Amino acid sites in the
latter class are likely to be under positive selection if their
ω is > 1 with high probability. This is true for 69 out of the
120 AA sites in this class with at least 95% probability
(Table 1).
The ω in the extracellular domain were mostly higher than
those in the intracellular domains (Figure 1). The most
divergent regions were between AA11–AA17 (signal peptide), AA241–AA255 (VS of LRR8), AA268–AA277 (VS of
LRR9) and AA294–AA313 (VS of LRR10) with average ω
of the surrounding 20 AA of > 0.8. In the region between
AA296–AA306 (LRR10) nine of the 10 AA are significantly under positive selection (P > 0.95) with ω over 1.8
for all of them.

Figure dN/dS ratio of a 20 AA sliding window along the protein sequence
Average1
Average dN/dS ratio of a 20 AA sliding window along the protein sequence. The analysis is based on the complete
dataset of 22 mammalian sequences. The predicted domain structure, position of polymorphic and positively selected (P >
0.95) sites is indicated. Sites displayed as "functional" refer to positions which were found to be crucial for ligand binding or
heterodimerisation in human (additional file 7: Functional relevant TLR2 sites identified in former studies in human or mouse).
The highest conserved regions of the extracellular domain
were at AA348–AA374 (VS of LRR12 and HCS of LRR13),
AA482–AA494 (HCS of LRR18) and AA534–AA543 (HCS
of LRR20) with average ω of the surrounding 20 AA
smaller than 0.3. In these regions there were also several
interspersed sites that were likely to evolve under positive
selection with P > 0.95 (Table 1).
The TLR2 intracellular domains were generally much
more conserved through strong purifying selection, reaching maximum conservation in the TIR domain with ω <
0.1 for the vast majority of sites. Nevertheless, interspersed within this highly conserved domain several AA
sites were assigned to class 3 with high probabilities (P >
0.95) suggesting that they are under positive selection
(Positions 639, 650, 760). A list of class assignment and

probabilities for all AA sites is provided in the additional
file 2: Class assignment of AA sites.
Taxon-specific selected sites
Ruminant-specific ω (average 0.446) were very similar to
those estimated in the dataset that included all mammalian species analysed (0.450). Nevertheless, selective constraint appears to have acted differently on some AAs and
domains. Forty-four AA sites in ruminants were assigned
to class 3 (high ω), 740 to class 2 and none to class 1, with
only 10 positively-selected AA sites as significant (P >
0.95). From the 44 class 3 AA sites in ruminants, 27 were
assigned to class 3 in all mammals. Only 215 sites were
assigned to the same class of selective constraint in ruminants as well as in all mammals. 475 AA sites differed by
one class (e.g. negatively selected versus neutral or posi-

tively selected versus neutral) and one site differed by two
classes (positive selection versus purifying selection) in
ruminants versus all mammals (227).
Selective pressure has acted differentially on several
domains of the ruminant TLR2 than in mammals in general (additional file 3: Comparative plot of the average ω
of a 20 AA sliding window along the protein sequence).
Eight LRR domains, LRR2 (ω difference (diff): -0.42),
LRR5 (diff: -0.18), LRR7 (diff: -0.17), LRR8 (diff: -0.32),
LRR9 (diff: -0.43), LRR10 (diff: -0.17), LRR11 (diff: -0.14)
and LRR19 (diff: -0.16), were more conserved within
ruminants than within all mammalian species studied.
This contrasted with LRR12 (diff: 0.23), 13 (diff: 0.14)
and TIR (diff: 0.23), which were more diverse within
ruminants when compared to the complete mammalian
species dataset (additional file 2: Class assignment of AA
sites).
Phylogenetic trees of TLR2 in mammals
All constructed trees reflect, in general, the putative evolution of the analysed species. However, two exceptions to
this generalisation were observed: a closer relationship
between Capra ibex and Ovis aries than between Capra ibex
and Capra hircus and a closer relationship between Boselaphus tragocamelus and Bos taurus than between Bubalus
bubalis and Bos taurus.

Trees based on synonymous exchanges clustered equally
to those based on non-synonymous exchanges (additional file 4: Unrooted radial phylogenetic trees of the
analysed TLR2 sequences). Nevertheless, they differed in
relative branch lengths indicating branch specific rates of
evolutionary change of the TLR2 protein sequence. This
was reflected in different ω along branches (additional file
5: ω along tree branches). Specifically, along most (28 out
of 42) branches the TLR2 sequence evolved under similar
selective pressure and with ω between 0.2–0.6. In four
branches however, low ω (0–0.16) indicated low evolutionary change (conserved branches), while in 10
branches high ω (0.86-infinity) were generated by relatively very high numbers of non-synonymous exchanges.
Branches evolving under positive selection
Seven of the 10 branches with high ω were short with less
than 0.01 exchanges per codon (additional file 4:
Unrooted radial phylogenetic trees of the analysed TLR2
sequences). Their evolutionary rate is consequently difficult to assess and could have been caused by chance.
These branches are therefore not further considered here.
Three further branches with high ω were much longer and
suggested an accelerated evolutionary rate caused by positive selection on certain domains.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/288

A first branch had a ω of 0.86 and represented the evolution of the common ancestor of Ungulata to the common
ancestor of Artiodactyla (node 30–29, Figure 2, additional
file 5: ω along tree branches). This ratio was based on 34
non-synonymous exchanges between both ancestral
sequences of which 28 are within LRR, three within the
transmembrane domain and one within the TIR domain
(additional file 6: AA substitutions along discussed
branches). Twenty-five of these AA sites displayed high ω
and were assigned to AA site class 3 (potentially positive
selected) in the complete dataset, but only five were
assigned to site class 3 in the ruminant set of sequences.
All remaining 20 AA sites assigned to class 3 in all mammals studied were assigned to class 2 in the ruminants.
A further branch separated bovine ruminants (Bovinae,
node 26) from small ruminants, Giraffa camelopardalis
and all non-ruminants (node 27). It had a ω of 1.22 and
was based on ten exchanges affecting AAs, of which seven
were located within LRRs, one in the transmembrane
domain, and one in the TIR domain (additional file 6: AA
substitutions along discussed branches). Five of these 10
affected sites were classified as class 3 (potentially positively-selected) in the complete dataset. Using the ruminant dataset, eight were classified as class 3 AA sites, of
which four had intermediate ω (class 2) in the complete
dataset. Only one AA site was assigned to class 3 in the
complete dataset, but to class 2 in the ruminant dataset. In
contrast to all other branches, this bovine branch was
based on exchanges affecting AA sites which were specifically under positive selection in ruminants, but not in the
complete mammalian dataset.
The third branch, separating Ovis aries and Capra ibex
(node 43) from the other ruminants (node 41) had a ω of
0.95 and affected six AAs, all of which were located within
the first 326 AAs of the extracellular domain (additional
file 6: AA substitutions along discussed branches). Four of
these AA sites were assigned to AA site class 3 in the complete dataset and three in the set of sequences limited to
ruminants. One AA site assigned to class 3 overall was
assigned to class 2 in the ruminant dataset.
Branches based on abundant or unevenly distributed
exchanges
A further three branches had average ω, but displayed a
noteworthy number of substitutions or a remarkable bias
of distribution of the exchanges over the protein sequence
(additional file 6: AA substitutions along discussed
branches).

The first of these branches connected the common ancestor of Artiodactyla (node 29) with the common ancestor of
the ruminants (node 28). It had a ω of 0.562 and consisted of 80 exchanges, of which 49 were assigned to class

3 in the complete dataset, but only eight to class 3 in the
ruminant set of sequences. Forty-one AA sites assigned to
class 3 in the complete dataset were assigned to class 2 in
the ruminant dataset.

present only in the German Black Pied (AA156). Three
mutations at positions 326, 417 and 665 were specific to
Bos indicus with all taurine breeds fixed for the wildtype.

Discussion
The second branch separated the common ancestor of
ruminants (node 28) from the Bovidae (node 27). It had a
ω of 0.248 and contained seven exchanges, of which five
were assigned to class 3 in the complete dataset and four
to class 3 in the ruminant dataset. One changed from class
3 in the complete dataset to class 2 in the ruminant dataset. All these exchanges were located in the N-terminal
half of the protein between AA101–AA453.
The third branch separating the common ancestor of the
Bovidae (27) from small ruminants (node 40) had a ratio
of 0.511 based on 11 exchanges. In contrast to most of the
TLR2 AA sites in ruminants, most of these exchanges were
classified as probably positively-selected (class 3) in both
sequence sets, even those located in the normally highly
conserved TIR domain. Three AA sites changed from a
class 3 assignment in the complete dataset to a class 2
assignment in ruminants and one from a class 2 assignment in the complete dataset to a class 3 assignment in the
ruminant dataset. All of these exchanges were located in
the C-terminal half of the protein between AA508–
AA773, with more than half of them located in the highlyconserved TIR domain.
Polymorphism in bovine TLR2 and detection of
polymorphic AA sites under positive selection
Sequencing of DNA pools containing amplified TLR2 coding regions of 10 cattle breeds revealed 29 polymorphic
sites in the nucleotide sequence. One of these has been
reported
previously
(silent
exchange
RefSNP#
RS41830058 at nt 1707). They result in 20 yet unreported
polymorphic AA sites in the bovine TLR2 (Table 2). Sixteen of them were located in LRR domains, one in the
transmembrane domain and three in the TIR domain. Ten
involved exchanges between AAs which occurred rarely on
a genome scale with a Blosum62 score of 0 or lower, indicating that these exchanges were likely to have functional
effects. Nine of the non-synonymous SNPs were assigned
to the site class likely to be positively-selected when comparing the sequences of all analysed mammals. Only six of
these fitted this category when comparing sequences
within ruminants. All these six exchanges in ruminants
have a Blosum62 score of 0 or lower, again indicating a
higher likelihood of functional effects.

Four of the 20 non-synonymous substitutions were fixed
in all breeds analysed, two of them (AA305 and AA405)
with Sahiwal breed-specific AAs, one with a fixed
exchange which was present only in the Spanish Fighting
Bull (AA330) and a fourth one with a fixed exchange

Patterns of selective constraint on TLR2 ligand binding,
dimerisation & AAs involved in signalling
The evolution of the mammalian TLR2 gene has been
shaped by positive and purifying selection (Figure 1).
Sequence variation at AA sites responsible for pattern recognition (PAMP ligands) will have enabled a faster adaptation to new pathogens as they are encountered in
different geographical locations or as they newly emerge
in a habitat. This has clear selective advantages. Such
advantageous substitutions have spread faster in the populations analysed than random substitutions. They appear
concentrated in the extracellular region of TLR2, particularly in the LRRs 8–10 in which residues responsible for
ligand binding have recently been reported [9]. In contrast
AAs responsible for functions like heterodimerisation or
signalling were more conserved, presumably because the
interacting molecules require conserved AA binding sites.
Amino acids essential for TLR2 dimerisation with TLR1 in
human and mouse have been identified in the LRRs 11,
12, 13, 14 and the TIR domain [9,12,13] (additional file
7: Functional relevant TLR2 sites identified in former studies in human or mouse). Our results show that, with the
exception of LRR11, all these regions were under strong
purifying selection whereas LRR12 and 13 were amongst
the most conserved regions of the extracellular domain.
The TIR domain was the most conserved domain of the
protein, which is known to be conserved even among TLR
paralogs [12]. In human and mouse TLR2, Jin et al. [9]
identified both ligand binding and TLR1 heterodimerisation sites within LRR11 (additional file 7: Functional relevant TLR2 sites identified in former studies in human or
mouse). According to our assumptions, this would lead to
opposed selective pressures on different AA sites within
the same domain. This was in fact observed and resulted
in an overall average ω for this LRR in bovine TLR2.

We have assumed in this study that many of the TLR
domains have similar functions in all species and that the
data from human and mouse TLRs regarding dimerisation
and ligand binding sites can in most cases be extrapolated
to other mammalian species. Having said this, we are
aware that functional changes can occur during evolution
that could lead to taxon-specific selective pressures.
Taxon-specific signatures of selection
Traces of selection detected in large, diverse mammalian
sequence sets alone do not necessarily reflect substitutions
which are of current functional relevance for any one species. Such patterns could also be the result of ancient selection events which triggered functional changes which

afterwards became fixed or gradually lost their importance. Therefore we analysed in addition a separate set of
ruminant sequences. Differences between the complete
mammalian dataset and the ruminant dataset should
reflect functional changes during evolution and could
help to highlight those AA sites which may be of current
functional importance in cattle (additional file 3: Comparative plot of the average ω of a 20 AA sliding window
along the protein sequence).
During the emergence of the Artiodactyla there was a
strong positive selection on the TLR2 gene. However, in
the subsequent period of ruminant evolution, the majority of potentially-positive selected class 3 AA sites seen in
mammals seem to have returned to a nearly neutral evolution within ruminants. One reason for this is that the
branches within ruminants are much shorter than in the
extended species phylogenetic tree. The power of site classification has therefore limitations and has resulted in
much less class 1 and 3 assignments. However, the absolute number of ω in ruminants nearly always pointed to
less selective constraint in either direction. This has
resulted in a lower variance of ω in ruminants than in
mammals generally (additional file 3: Comparative plot
of the average ω of a 20 AA sliding window along the protein sequence, F-test, P = 0.03).
Many TLR2 LRR motifs which contain sites known to be
responsible for ligand binding in human or mouse and
display high ω in the entire mammalian dataset were considerably less positively-selected in ruminants (e.g. LRR9,
10, 11). In a remarkable contrast, most of those domains
which are crucial for dimerisation and under strong purifying selection in the complete mammalian dataset are less
conserved in ruminants (LRR12, 13 and TIR).
Therefore we speculate that this might reflect functional
changes of these sites during evolution, releasing these
AAs from strong selective pressure in ruminants. Differences between species in ligand recognition are known for
several TLRs [30,31] and can result in species-specific
immune responses to certain pathogens.
Exchanges along branches
The above speculation is also supported by the exchanges
along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. During the
emergence of the Artiodactyla there was a strong positive
selection on the TLR2 gene, whereas in the subsequent
period involving the spread of ruminants the majority of
initially positive selected class 3 sites on TLR2 return to a
nearly neutral evolution characterized by average ω along
the branches (additional file 5: ω along tree branches).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/288

large ruminants and the evolution of ovine TLR2 in ibex
and sheep. The TLR2 of the common ancestor of Bovidae
(node 27) separated into two branches corresponding to
small (node 40) and large (node 26) ruminants. The first
branch (nodes 27, 40) is based on an extraordinary concentration of AA exchanges in the TIR domain on AA sites
which were driven by positive selection (additional file 6:
AA substitutions along discussed branches) and occurred
at positions near to AA sites which were reported to be
responsible for heterodimerisation with TLR1 in human
and mouse [9]. Gene conversion events between TLR1
and 6 [22] could trigger such positive selection on AA sites
which are normally under strong purifying selection,
resulting in high ω for such AA sites in the otherwise
highly conserved domain. Similarly, most exchanges of
the second branch (nodes 27, 26) leading to large bovine
ruminants (Bovinae) were under positive selection in both
the general mammalian and ruminant datasets (additional file 6: AA substitutions along discussed branches).
In fact this was the only branch in which more altered sites
were under positive selection in ruminants than in mammals, including four AA sites which were classified as class
2 in mammals, but as class 3 in ruminants. It is possible
that these exchanges were caused by adaptive selection
and resulted in bovine specific functional changes.
Contrary to the generally observed phylogeny of TLR2 in
the different species, the TLR2 of Capra ibex and Ovis aries
cluster closely together but relatively distant from Capra
hircus. The branch separating both species from the other
small ruminants (nodes 41–43) is formed by exchanges
which are all concentrated in a region within the first 326
AA of the protein, affecting LRR domains which are
thought to be responsible for ligand binding. One of the
exchanges (AA326) affected a position known to be crucial for lipopeptide detection in human TLR2 (and that is
polymorphic in cattle – see below), and two further substitutions were located near these sites [9]. High ω were
probably the product of adaptation to specific pathogens
which is known to trigger diversifying selection [25]. The
sequences might reflect specific adaptation to certain
microbial/pathogen environments. In this case, a high
variation within species would be expected in line with
the different environments in which these species evolve.
This would predict polymorphisms in common in several
closely related species and possibly appear fixed in certain
environments. The Capra hircus sequence originated from
an Indian sample, while the Ovis aries and Capra ibex individuals were both from Europe. The different clustering
might therefore reflect the geographic origin rather than
the differences between species.

However, there are two exceptions to this general pattern
for ruminants as a whole: the separation of small and

Determination of polymorphic sites likely to have
functional effects
The relative genetic disparity between Bos indicus and Bos
taurus is well established [32] and this genetic distance
would explain some of the TLR2 polymorphisms
observed between these two subspecies. However, the difference would not just be defined by random events over
the time they diverged, but also by different microbial
environments that the animals evolve within. The Bos
indicus breeds analysed herein originated in tropical or
subtropical climates where the pathogen population is
generally different to that encountered by the Bos taurus
breeds sampled which all inhabited Europe. Consequently, there will be different selective pressures acting
on the TLR and other immune related genes in these subspecies, which would result in sites being differentially
fixed in their TLR genes.

Functionally-important AAs in the ligand-binding
domains of the TLRs would be shaped by selection. Conserved AA sites are protected by purifying selection and
therefore normally fixed. Sporadic mutations at such sites
are likely to disappear very quickly from any of the population they have occurred in. This is probably the case for
the substitutions found at positions 309, 486, 654 and
717 (Table 2). All four exchanges were polymorphic
within a single breed and it can be assumed that these are
random mutations, possibly with no functional effect and
low frequency. Neutral mutations (class 2) are expected to
have no functional relevance. They might have appeared
randomly and spread or disappeared driven by genetic
drift rather than by selection. In our dataset, such
exchanges (positions 152, 330, 417, 665) appeared
mostly in only one breed and at low frequency. In such
circumstances functional relevance is unlikely. In contrast, AA sites that are shaped by positive selection are
expected to spread quickly in populations in which their
occurrence has positive functional effects.
Sites which are shaped by positive selection in the complete mammalian dataset, but not in the ruminant dataset
might have lost their functional significance during evolution. Five polymorphic sites fell into this category (AA63,
AA211, AA337, AA502, AA605) and all but position 605
had a relatively common AA substitution (Blosum62 > 0),
which indicates that functional effects in cattle are not
very likely.
In contrast, AA sites which are positively selected in ruminants, but not in the complete dataset are candidates for
ruminant-specific TLR2 functions (156, 227). This is
likely particularly if such sites are differentially fixed in
breeds originating from or evolving in different geographical (hence microbial) environments (Table 2). The substitution Leu227Phe was fixed for Phe in all Bos taurus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/288

breeds analysed whereas the wildtype Leu occured only in
Bos indicus. This substitution had a low Blosum62 score
which suggests that the establishment of a Leu-Phe
replacement in any given population is a scarce event and
therefore is more likely to affect function. This pattern
could be explained by a selective advantage of Phe in a
temperate environment in which the sampled Bos taurus
breed originated and thus this polymorphism is of interest for future functional study.
Functional effects are also possible from polymorphisms
at AA sites which are positively selected in both ruminants
and mammals generally (68, 305, 326, 563). These AA
sites are most likely to be of functional importance if they
are differentially fixed in breeds evolving in different
microbial environments. For example, at positions 326
and 563 of TLR2 the mutations were fixed in Bos indicus
breeds sharing common environments (Table 2).
Functional consequences seem likely for His305Pro with
a P-value for class 3 assignment of 1 and a seldom AA
exchange (Blosum62 score of -2). This AA was subject to a
frequent change during evolution (additional file 6: AA
substitutions along discussed branches). In all other ruminants only His and Tyr occurred at this site. Pro appears to
be a new mutation which possibly occurred recently in Bos
indicus and was only observed in the Sahiwal sample. A
higher number of Sahiwal individuals is needed to estimate the frequency of occurrence of this allele and
whether a positive functional effect is predicted.
The His326Gln exchange in TLR2 takes place within the
ligand-binding region of TLR2 [9], but where the human
TLR2 positional homologue is a Tyr. Tyr and Gln are
uncharged, in contrast to His which is positively charged.
During the phylogeny of TLR2 this position has changed
several times, including back mutations (branch 41–43)
which suggest adaptive positive selection (additional file
6: AA substitutions along discussed branches). The fixation of the wildtype in Bos taurus and of the mutant in two
of three Bos indicus breeds indicates that possible adaptive
selection might depend on the environment the animals
are held in. This exchange is therefore likely to have functional consequences for the ligand binding ability of
bovine TLR2.
Similarly, the occurrence of Arg563His in different breeds
could be explained by adaptive selection. However, the
site appears to be unchanged in nearly all ruminants
(Arg), while all non-ruminants are fixed with Leu at this
position, pointing to a ruminant specificity with a high
level of conservation. The P-values for the class 3 assignments for this are not robust and raise the issue that this
could be a neutrally evolving polymorphism which
spreads due to genetic drift.

Conclusion
Within bovine TLR2, we have identified that selective constraint has acted differentially on sites associated with
domains with distinct functions. Amino acids responsible
for TLR-PAMP ligand binding have been shaped for the
most part by positive selection, while sites linked to TLR
heterodimerisation are conserved. This suggests that adaptive selection shapes ligand binding sites to improve the
recognition of different relevant pathogens and that AA at
such sites reflect microbial environments. Polymorphism
affecting these AAs is therefore likely to result in functional consequences.
However, sites can lose or gain functional importance
during evolution. This seems to be of particular importance in ruminants as reflected in a change of selective
constraint on certain AAs. This could have implications
for the way the ruminant innate immune system works
and should be further investigated using comparative
functional studies.
Polymorphism in bovine TLR2 occurs mainly between
breeds and is probably associated with different geographic and therefore microbial environments. This could
be investigated further by population genetic studies
which would link the occurrence of certain variants with
certain pathogen environments.
Polymorphic sites likely to be functionally relevant in
bovine TLR2 were predicted by analysis of: selective constraint, molecular evolution, extrapolating information
about TLR domain functions from human and mouse to
cattle and estimating the effect of the AA exchanges
observed. Such sites have been identified at positions 227,

305 and 326 of the TLR2 predicted polypeptide and affect
AAs or domains known to be involved in the recognition
of PAMP ligands by TLR2.
A final proof of their functional relevance requires further
studies to determine their effect on the immune response
after stimulation with relevant ligands and/or their association with immune related traits in animals. This would
facilitate the identification of particular disease susceptibility/resistance in cattle and will provide a valuable tool
for the breeding industry to improve genetic resistance
against a range of pathogens.

Methods
Sample collection
DNA from 90 individuals belonging to 7 Bos taurus and 3
Bos indicus breeds of different geographic origin were collected. In addition DNA and tissue samples of 7 ruminant
species were sampled and DNA extracted using standard
procedures (Qiagen kit) (Table 3).
Primer design
Bovine primers were designed using the bovine sequence
assembly Btau_3.1 (NW_929136.1) using Primer3 software [33]. One amplification primer pair was designed to
cover the complete coding sequence in one fragment of
2467 bp. Twelve sequencing primers were designed on
both strands with an average distance of 500 bp, whereas
the most outlying primers were designed as nested primers to avoid sequencing background of unspecific PCR
products (Table 4). Ruminant species were first amplified
and sequenced using bovine primers. Gaps in the
sequences due to failed sequencing reactions were covered

used: Mus musculus (NM_011905.2), Pan troglodytes
(XM_001155304.1), Rattus norvegicus (NM_198769.2),
Boselaphus tragocamelus (DQ286731.1), Bubalus bubalis
(DQ288130.1),
Oryctolagus
cuniculus
(NM_001082781.1), Macaca fascicularis (AY045573.1),
Macaca mulatta (XM_001087830.1), Homo sapiens
(NM_003264.3), Equus caballus (AY429602.1), Cricetulus
griseus (AF113614.1), Capra hircus (DQ872435.1), Canis
familiaris (NM_001005264.1), Sus scrofa (AB208696.2),
Monodelphis domestica (ENSMODG00000024954).
Sequence analysis
Sequences were processed, analysed and assembled using
the programs pregap and gap of the Staden sequence analysis package [34]. Consensus sequences were created and
all inconsistencies and polymorphisms examined by eye.
Created sequences were uploaded to the NCBI GenBank,
accession numbers are indicated in Table 3.

Sequences were aligned using ClustalW and translated.
The domain structure of the extra-cellular domains was
deducted from the TLR2 LRR structure published by Matsushima et al. [11]. The transmembrane and intracellular
domains were predicted using information provided in
Xu et al. [12] and retrieved from the SMART online database at [35] (domain structure embedded in additional
file 2: Class assignment of AA sites).
Entropy plots
Sequence conservation along alignments was visualized
using an entropy plot as implemented into Bioedit [36]. It
is a measure of the lack of predictability for an alignment
position. A score of 0 stands for complete conservation
(completely predictable), high values for high diversity
between sequences. For a comparison between groups values were corrected for branch-depth (overall conservation) by normalizing the values to an identical average in
all alignments. The resulting frequencies were used to calculate a sliding average value for a 50 AA window, which
was plotted in a chart (see additional file 1: Comparative
plot of the average corrected entropy of a 50 AA sliding
window along the protein sequence).

Evaluation of AA exchanges
The probablility of functional consequences of non-synonymous substitutions depends on the AAs involved. To
evaluate the significance of substitutions we used the
Blosum62 matrix [37]. This attributes a score based on the
observed frequencies of such occurences in alignments of
related proteins. Frequently observed substitutions are
likely to be functional neutral and receive positive scores,
while seldom observed substitutions are seen to be more
likely to cause functional disturbance and are given negative scores.

AA sites found to be polymorphic in cattle were compared
to the consensus of ruminant species. The consensus AA
was assumed to be the bovine wildtype.
Phylogenetic Analysis using Maximum Likelihood
An analysis of functional constraint and molecular evolution of the TLR2 gene was conducted using Maximum
Likelihood based algorithms included into PAML [38].

Along sites: ratios between synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions (ω) along AA sites were estimated
with the program codeml of the PAML package, using
Model M3, with K = 3 AA site classes as in Yang et al. [24].
The algorithm estimates for each AA site an assignment
probability to three possible site classes with low ω (purifying selection), intermediate ω (neutral) or high ω (positively selected) and allocates the site to the class with
highest probability.
Ratios along sites were estimated assuming only one ω
over branches (model = 0). Selective constraint on the different protein domains was visualized by an Excel chart
with a sliding window displaying the average ω of the surrounding 20 AAs (Figure 1).
Group specific ω along AA sites: in addition ω were estimated along AA sites as described above, but with a dataset limited to ruminant sequences. Class allocations were
compared between the ruminant and the complete dataset for each AA. Sites allocated to opposite classes (purifying versus positive selection) in ruminants were evaluated
as shaped by a taxon specific selective pressure.

sites was assumed (M0). Using this model also ancestral
sequences were reconstructed.
Phylogenetic trees
Phylogenetic trees from an alignment of DNA sequences
were constructed by calculating a distance matrix using
the F84 model in DNAdist version 3.5 c, tree files were calculated using NEIGHBOR [39]. Generated tree files were
then used as input file for PAML. Phylogenetic trees based
only on synonymous or non-synonymous exchanges were
generated by PAML. Trees were visualized by treeview
[40].

Variance of ω was estimated and tested using an F-test as
established in Excel. The hypothesis 1 that the variation of
ω among sites is identical between ruminants and all species is tested against the hypothesis that ω differs between
both groups.
Along branches: nevertheless ω along branches were estimated using the free-ratio model, allowing a different
ratio along each branch. In this model the same ω along
