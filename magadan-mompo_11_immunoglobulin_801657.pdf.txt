Immunoglobulin heavy chains in medaka
(Oryzias latipes)
Susana Magadán-Mompó1, Christian Sánchez-Espinel2 and Francisco Gambón-Deza3*

Abstract
Background: Bony fish present an immunological system, which evolved independently from those of animals
that migrated to land 400 million years ago. The publication of whole genome sequences and the availability of
several cDNA libraries for medaka (Oryzias latipes) permitted us to perform a thorough analysis of immunoglobulin
heavy chains present in this teleost.
Results: We identified IgM and IgD coding ESTs, mainly in spleen, kidney and gills using published cDNA libraries
but we did not find any sequence that coded for IgT or other heavy chain isotypes described in fish. The IgM ESTs corresponded with the secreted and membrane forms and surprisingly, the latter form only presented two
constant heavy chain domains. This is the first time that this short form of membrane IgM is described in a teleost.
It is different from that identified in Notothenioid teleost because it does not present the typical splicing pattern of
membrane IgM. The identified IgD-ESTs only present membrane transcripts, with Cμ1 and five Cδ exons.
Furthermore, there are ESTs with sequences that do not have any VH which disrupt open reading frames.
A scan of the medaka genome using transcripts and genomic short reads resulted in five zones within a region on
chromosome 8 with Cμ and Cδ exons. Some of these exons do not form part of antibodies and were at times
interspersed, suggesting a recombination process between zones. An analysis of the ESTs confirmed that no
antibodies are expressed from zone 3.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the IGH locus duplication is very common among teleosts, wherein the
existence of a recombination process explains the sequence homology between them.

Background
Genome information of vertebrates is rapidly becoming
available thanks to several full vertebrate genome projects. Such information is very useful for comparative
and evolutionary biologists. Comparative genomic studies are helping to discover evolutionary mechanisms
that underlie diversification of organisms [1,2]. Therefore, information obtained from genomes is of great use
for understanding the genetic basis of antibody diversity
and the evolutionary divergences of the immunoglobulin
locus in vertebrates [3]. Immunoglobulin loci are organised into two main types called: “cluster” and “translocon”. Cluster type organization is found in both light
and heavy chain loci of cartilaginous fish [4,5] There are
many independent variable (VH), diversity (D), joining

(JH) and constant (CH) segments sets [VH(D)JHCH]
along wide areas of the genome. Therefore, diversity in
these molecules is generated through synthesis of antibodies from each of these VH-D-JH-CH regions [6,7].
In tetrapods and bony fish, the IGH locus configuration
is translocon and it presents some specific characteristics. There are genomic segments for the variable
regions of antibody heavy chains (VH) and these are followed by segments that code for: diversity (D), joining
(JH), and segments that encode the heavy chain domains
(CH). A rearranged VHDJH region spliced to CH segment is needed to generate an antibody [8,9].
It is well established that all fishes have IGHM and
other constant chain region genes in the 3’ region. Dooley and Flajnik described genes that encoded the IgW
(omega immunoglobulin isotype) and IgNAR (New
Antigen Receptor) antibodies in the 3’ region, for cartilaginous fish [10-12]. Most bony fish belong to the
infraclass teleost, where we can find IgM, IgD [13-15]

and IgT/IgZ [16]. However, the IgT/IgZ have not been
found in catfish [14]. Teleost IgD is an antibody which
generally has seven domains and some of these have
experienced recent duplications [17]. The IGHZ (of zebrafish) and IGHT (of rainbow trout) correspond to
genes that code for antibodies (IgZ and IgT) with four
immunoglobulin domains located upstream from the D
and JH segments of IGHM. Furthermore, the exons that
code for the constant region present their own D and
JH segments, and resemble the organization of T cell
receptor alpha and delta (TCR a and δ) loci [18]. Other
genes for antibodies found at the same location were
described later, and may correspond to different forms
of the same antibody [17,19].
Another surprising feature found in some teleost IGH
loci, such as in stickleback, catfish [14,17] and medaka, is
the presence of core block [VH(D)JHCH] duplications in
the germline. Such presence is perhaps not widespread in
teleosts because they were not found in zebrafish genome
[16]. The duplications present a high homology suggesting that they happened recently or perhaps there is a biological mechanism that maintains them.
This article presents a description of the antibodies in
medaka, wherein antibody structure was deduced based
on genomic and EST data. Five zones or regions that
code for constant chain immunoglobulin domains have
been found in genome, and each of these regions has
exons for IgM and IgD. Medaka (Oryzias latipes), catfish
(Ictalurus punctatus), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) represent a group of teleosts that have been widely used as animal models in
various fields such as biology, medicine, environmental
science and fisheries [20,21]. There is ample information
on zebrafish, catfish and stickleback immunoglobulin
loci but this is the first time that work on medaka
immunoglobulins is published.

Methods
Fish and sampling

Adult medaka (Oryzias latipes, strain HdrR belongs to
the Southern Japanese population) specimens were
kindly supplied by J. Cerdá (Institute of Marine Sciences
of Barcelona, CSIC, and Aquaculture Centre). Fish were
killed by overexposure to MS222 (Sigma Chemicals).
Head kidney and spleen were removed aseptically and
RNA was extracted immediately using the QIAmp RNA
kit (QIAGEN) following manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA preparation, PCR and DNA sequencing

About 5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcripted into
cDNA by using QIAGEN One Step RT-PCR kit and
priming with 0.5 μM of Cδ6-antisense primer (5’GGACTGTTGGAGGATTCATGTCTCACA-3’) in a
total volume of 50 μl.

Page 2 of 13

Amplification of the IgD constant region was performed in a two-step PCR reaction. 5 μl of cDNA reaction mixture was amplified by thermal cycling in a total
volume of 25 μl using Cμ1-sense (5’-CATTGACTTT
CTCATGGACTCAGGGC-3’) combined with Cδ6- antisense primer. Amplification was performed for 30 cycles
at 95°C 30s, 65°C for 30s and 72°C for 90s, with a final
elongation step at 72°C for 10 min. Due to a very low
amplification product obtained from the first PCR, a
second round was performed for 20 more cycles using
the same primers and conditions. The amplified products were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3130
Genetic Analyzer. The Gepard (GEnome PAir -Rapid
Dotter) program [22] was used to search for homologues with the genomic sequences and identify the IgD
domains.
Medaka immunoglobulin expression using ESTs
databases

Previously identified immunoglobulin constant heavy
chain exons from stickleback [17] were used to search
homologue sequences in the medaka ESTs database
(http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka). A total of 11
cDNA libraries generated from different tissues of HdrRmedaka were scanned (Additional file 1). ESTs encoding
for IgM and/or IgD were retrieved. The medaka immunoglobulin ESTs can be found grouped into three clusters: a) CLSTF16513, with the 5’ sequences encoding
IgM and IgD, b) CLSTR12908 with 3’ sequences for IgM
and c) CLSTR18886 with 3’ IgD sequences.
In order to identify the genomic zone or region that
corresponds to each EST, an alignment was performed
using the Lastz program available at the Galaxy website
(http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/) [23,24]. To confirm results
we performed the same analysis using recently released
next generation RNA sequences (SRA023697) deposited
in the Sequence Read Archive database of the NCBI
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). These alignments
were visualized using the Tablet - Next Generation
Sequence Assembly Visualization software (http://bioinf.
scri.ac.uk/tablet/) [25].
Identification of the IGH locus

The complete genome of Oryzias latipes (assembly:
HdrR, October 2005; version 56.1i) built in NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Ensembl database platforms
(http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) was examined to
locate antibody genes. Previously published sequences
from other IGHM teleost fish were used to identify genomic scaffolds and chromosomes that contained immunoglobulin genes. These sequences (scaffolds 146, 409 and
501, chromosome 8) were retrieved and analysed in detail
using the Vector-NTI (Invitrogen). Two scaffolds were
not assigned to any chromosome (scaffold 3172 and

Magadán-Mompó et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:165

1447) but were identified as harboring IGH gene segments and these scaffolds were observed to overlap on
400 nucleotides suggesting that they are contiguous
(Additional File 2).
Identification of exons coding for CH domains was
performed by aligning genomic sequences with previously published immunoglobulin mRNAs. Limits of
unpublished antibodies were deduced following instructions in the software FGNESH (http://www.softberry.
com) and Augustus (http://augustus.gobics.de/submission) [26]. Messenger RNA predicted from the gene
sequence was compared with O. latipes EST sequences
from NCBI and http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka, in
order to confirm exon ends and analyse gene expression.
The heavy chain variable segments (VH) of medaka
were located on the same scaffolds and chromosome.
Several criteria were used to identify VH segments,
including: a) the presence of recombination signal
sequences (RSS) including the canonical “tattattgt” nonamer sequences (allowing 1 or 2 nucleotide mismatches)
and corresponding heptamer sequences, b) the presence
of AG and and GT splice sides flanking open reading
frames, and c) pattern searches for identifying RSS with
23 bp spacers flanking the 3’end of the VH regions. We
verified whether the read sequences corresponded to the
VH regions [27].
D segments were identified by the presence of RSS 5’
and RSS 3’ [24]. They were compared with O. latipes
EST database in order to confirm their expression. The
heavy chain joining (JH) segments were located by
homology to published JH sequences. This was carried
out by comparing a dot plot between published JH
sequences and the 5’ region of the IGHM (implementing
a window of 30 nt and a match of 60%). RSS was used
to detect the beginning of the JH exon while the presence of “GTA” was used to determine the end [27].
The immunoglobulin gene nomenclature used to
describe the identified genes followed the guidelines of
the international ImMunoGeneTics Information System
(http://imgt.org) [28].
In order to resolve occasional mistakes and complete the
gaps, all scaffolds retrieved (scaffolds 146, 409 and 501,
chromosome 8) were aligned with the recently released
genomic new generation sequences (DRA000220), deposited in the Sequence Read Archive database of the NCBI
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). The in silico analysis
was carried out using the available tools at the Galaxy
website (http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/) and visualized with
Tablet - Next Generation Sequence Assembly Visualization software (http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/).

perform BLOSSUM alignments. The neighbour-joining
and minimum evolution methods were then used to
plot the phylogenetic trees (pair-wise deletion, JonesTaylor-Thornton matrix and enter range activated sites
(gamma-number 2.5). The veracity of these trees was
studied using the above-mentioned method and by
executing 1000 replicate bootstrappings.

Results
Immunoglobulins in medaka

A bioinformatic search of ESTs in the NBRP medaka
database (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/) was carried out in order to determine the kind of antibodies
expressed by the teleost medaka. Previously published
Cμ, Cδ, Cζ, sequences from G. aculeatus [17] were used
as queries to identify the ESTs.
A total of 94 EST sequences of IgM and 19 of IgD
were identified but we did not find any EST homologues
to IgT/Z. Only ESTs with data from both ends (considered full length) were analysed further and are summarized according to their tissue distribution (Table 1). As
already reported in other teleosts, IgM and IgD genes
are mainly expressed in kidney, gills and spleen. And
only a few IgM ESTs were detected in liver, ovarian tissue and brain.
As shown below, approximately 15% of these ESTs
present atypical rearrangement and stop codons in all
reading frames. Three immunoglobulin heavy chain
forms were found among the viable ESTs. Two of these
corresponded to the IgM: transmembrane and secreted
forms, and one to transmembrane IgD (Figure 1). Surprisingly, the IgM transmembrane form presented only
two CH domains (Cμ1 and Cμ2), TM1 and TM2. The
deduced amino acid sequence of medaka IgM showed a
cysteine residue in the CH1 domain which is involved
in the formation of disulphide bonds with the light
chain. We did not find any cysteine in CH1 and CH2 to

Figure 1 Immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domains. The protein structure was deduced from the mRNA coding for transmembrane
IgM (IgM-TM), secreted IgM (IgM-S) and transmembrane IgD (IgD-TM) forms. The putative cysteines that establish bonds with light chains (L)
and heavy chains (H) to form multimers (J) are shown. Potential glycosylation sites are indicated with Gly.

join the heavy chains; however there were two cysteines
in TM1 that may be responsible for covalent heavy
chain binding.
The secreted IgM form appears to be similar to those
described in other teleostei [14], with four CH domains
and a secretory tail. This IgM presents three cysteines
for interchain bonds, one in the CH1 domain to establish a disulfide bond with the light chain, another in the
CH3 domain to join heavy chains and finally, in the
secretory tail, probably to form multimers (Additional
File 4).
The study of IgD ESTs permitted us to deduce its
structure. This is similar to those described in other teleostei, in which the first constant domain is Cμ1 followed by Cδ1. The Cδ6, Cδ7, TM1 and TM2 domains
were present in the ESTs in all cases. All IgD domains
expressed could not be described because the forward
and reverse ESTs sequences did not overlap. Thus, we
decided to perform a RT-PCR of head kidney and spleen
mRNA with primers designed for the Cμ1 and Cδ6. A
PCR product of approximately 1600 bp was obtained
and its sequencing confirmed the presence of Cδ1, Cδ2,
Cδ3, Cδ4 and Cδ6 domains (Additional File 5). There
was no Cδ5 equivalent in all IgD transcripts sequenced.
Medaka IGH Genomic organization

Four different sequences of IgM in ESTs were found,
suggesting several isotypes or allotypes. These were used
to scan the medaka genome and map immunoglobulin
heavy chain genes. Several sequences were found on
chromosome eight (scaffolds 146, 409 and 501) that
cover approximately 450 kb (Figure 2). We also identified two scaffolds that were not assigned to any chromosome (scaffolds 3172 and 1447, with 400 nucleotides
overlapped suggesting that they are contiguous) in

which several immunoglobulin heavy chain coding
exons were annotated.
We were able to elucidate the IGH genomic organization, despite finding several gaps, mainly between scaffolds and contigs, which prevent us from creating a
complete contiguous annotation. Furthermore, we were
able to complete some gaps and solve several contradictions found between ESTs and genomic sequences,
using recently deposited next generation sequence data
(DRA000220 and SRA026397) in the Sequence Read
Archive Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).
In order to identify the immunoglobulin heavy chain
genes, the genomic scaffolds were divided into 30 Kb
segments and analysed using the FGNESH and Augustus software packages [23]. The obtained results were
verified through a dot plot and Est2genome (EMBOSS)
with available medaka ESTs that had been identified as
immunoglobulins. As shown in Figure 2 and 3, the IGH
genomic organization is complex, with five specific
zones where Cμ and Cδ exons are identified (In Additional File 6 you can find the nucleotide sequences of all
zones in GenBank format, we have included a file with
VH annotation). It is worthy to note that not all exons
are expected to produce an immunoglobulin heavy
chain in most zones. Therefore, in order to avoid confusion, instead of naming exons according to their numerical order of appearance in the genomic sequence, we
decided to number them according to their orthologous
exons defined in other species. The Additional file 7
shows a tree constructed using the aligned medaka CH
amino acid sequences and CHs deduced from sequences
of the bony fish stickleback (G. aculeatus) which supports this criterion for classification.
Overall, Cμ and Cδ exons, D and JH segments (Figure
3) were identified in each of the five genomic zones. No

Zone 5

Figure 2 The IGH locus of O. latipes. The image displays the location of scaffolds that encode immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in
chromosome 8. Five specific zones can be deduced in which Cμ and Cδ exons are identified. Contigs that cover the IGH locus are represented
at the bottom in dark and light blue. The white segments show gaps in the genomic sequence.

Cδ exons were found and this is consistent with data
obtained from ESTs analysis. As indicated in Figure 3
some exons were identified or corrected based on the
analysis of ESTs and the next generation sequence data
(SRA026397 and DRA000220). VH regions were found
between zones (see Additional File 6 and 8).
Another important feature is the sequence homology
between different zones as shown in Figure 4. A dot
plot of zone 1 versus zone 4 genomic sequences elucidated duplications of large and small segments, suggesting a recombination process. The similarity between the
sequences of homologous domains and the flanking
introns indicates that this process must have taken place
recently.
The genomic region designated as zone 1 encodes
seven JH segments followed by Cμ1, Cμ2, Cμ3 and Cμ4,
and harbors exons that code for a transmembrane and
cytoplasm domain. In this zone there are only four Cδ
exons (Cδ1, Cδ2, Cδ6 and Cδ7) located 3 kb downstream of the nearest Cμ and are followed by transmembrane and cytoplasm exons. There is a gap between Cδ2
and Cδ6, where there is a high probability of finding the
presence of Cδ exons in this first zone.
The remaining zones give us an idea of asymmetric
duplications, that is, the presence of Cμ and Cδ exons
with a changed configuration. In zone 2, just like in zone
1, the exons Cμ1, Cμ2, Cμ3 (also deduced from EST
sequences) and Cμ4 appear after seven D segments and
seven JH segments (Figure 3). Exons for transmembrane

and cytoplasm domains are also present. At 3’ of these
exons, we find one Cδ2 exon without any other sequence
coding for IgD antibody. Interestingly, about 5 kb downstream, we find D and JH segments followed by Cμ1 and
Cδ1- Cδ2- Cδ3- Cδ4- Cδ6 exons again. Therefore, we can
differentiate two genomic regions in this zone, namely;
zone 2a at 5’, and zone 2b at 3’. Both of them have exons
to IgM and IgD.
The zone designated as zone 3 seems to be quite disorganized when compared with other zones. As shown
in Figure 3, there are very few exons and this suggests
that this zone may not generate functional antibodies.
Conversely, zone 4 appears to be well structured and
presents the highest number of exons. At the 5’ region
there are four Cμ exons, including Cμ2 with their transmembrane and cytoplasm coding exons (Figure 3). Surprisingly, domain Cμ4 and the transmembrane and
cytoplasm exons are found to be duplicated. At the 3’
region, there are 10 exons for IgD domains, some of
which are repeated (Cδ2, Cδ3, Cδ4 and Cδ6). Between
the last Cδ6 and the Cδ7 there are exons that code for
IgM (Cμ2 and Cμ4) and finally, we find sequences for
transmembrane and cytoplasm IgD domains.
At present, zone 5 is the least resolved genomic
region. This is due to the presence of a gap of about 30
kb between scaffold 501 and the 146 junction. The identified sequences, D segments and Cδ exons, are found to
be inverted. The IGHM might be missing due to the
presence of the gap however; it is very probable that

Figure 3 Detailed representation of five genomic zones identified in O. latipes IGH locus. It shows the D, JH segments, constant (C) and
(TM) exons as rectangles or arrowheads. The demarcation of exons was performed by using the computer software (FGNESH and Augustus) and
alignment was done with ESTs. The exons and sequences in red were identified or corrected based on the analysis of ESTs and the next
generation sequence data (SRA026397 and DRA000220). In zone 5/x the question mark sign (?) indicates the presence of a gap and the
possibility that zone x is integrated in zone 5. Zone x presents Cμ sequences belonging to scaffolds 3172 and 1447 and they are not assigned to
any chromosome (For more information see Additional file 2).

scaffolds 3172 and 1447 belong to the gap because they
are not assigned to any chromosome and present
sequences for IgM domains (See Figure 3). The above
will be taken into account and from now on we will be
referred to as zone5/x.

Correlation between ESTs and genomic sequences

The structure of this multiple locus with a high number
of repetitions and with exons situated out of normal
locations made us verify this annotation. To do this we
aligned the ESTs and DNA short reads (DRA000220)

with the different zones of the immunoglobulin locus.
For example, Figure 5 shows the alignment of the ESTs
with the exon Cμ1 belongs to zone 2. We identified
ESTs with specific differences that correspond to each
of the Cμ1 sequences found in the different zones,
except in zone 3 revealing that it is possible to assign
ESTs to concordant gene segments (Figure 5). When
aligned with the DNA short reads we found the same
results but in this case we were able to detect short
reads belonging to zone 3 (Additional file 9).
In addition, the tissue distribution of ESTs from lymphoid tissues (kidney, spleen and gills) was correlated
with genomic zones. ESTs were found to be expressed
from 1, 2, 4 and 5/x zones (Table 2).
On the subject of ESTs coding for IgM, we identified a
total of 34 ESTs expressed from zone 1, where 21 corresponded to the secreted form and 13 to the membrane

form (Table 2). Thirty-two ESTs were assigned to zone 2,
with membrane (6 ESTs) and secreted (26 ESTs) forms.
Eleven IgM membrane and five IgM secreted coding
ESTs belonged to zone 4. Only 8 IgM ESTs (4 membrane
and 4 secreted) were found to be expressed from zone 4
and, as expected due to its disorganized genomic structure, no EST from zone 3 was detected.
It is worthy to note that approximately 15% of these
ESTs (for example the 6 ESTs assigned to zone 4) do
not show the classical rearrangement (VH-D-JH-CH)
and are expressed without VH segment. Joining in most
of these rearrangements takes place between an exon
situated at 3’ of JH segments and Cμ1. This 3’-JH exon
(named Exon 0) has 100 bp and presents stop codons in
the 3 ORF (Figure 6). This exon is in zone 1, 2 and 3
and not in 4 and 5/x. Not all mRNAs without VH have
this exon 0, for example, 6 ESTs assigned to zone 4.

Figure 5 Confirmation of different genomic zones through ESTs alignment. The top part of the figure shows the result obtained after
aligning medaka immunoglobulin coding ESTs with the region of zone 2 that presents JH segments and the IGHM gene. A higher number of
ESTs matches with Cμ1 and Cμ2 is due to their presence in transmembrane and secreted IgM. The bottom part shows details of ESTs alignment
with the Cμ1. It includes the specific nucleotide sequence to each zone. Identical nucleotides are shown in the same colour (A: green, C: brown,
G: lilac, T: blue) and differences are in red and underlined.

Just like in other fishes, we identified 19 ESTs coding
for the membrane IgD form. However, we were unable
to unequivocally establish the distribution of these ESTs
in each genomic zone because the different Cδ genomic
sequences were very similar. Moreover, only four ESTs
corresponded to the typical chimeric transcripts
observed in teleosts, (utilizing exon Cμ1) and presented
the typical VH-D-JH rearrangement. Other IgD transcripts found presented an atypical rearrangement with
Cδ domains and diversity in the 5’ region, some examples are shown in (Figure 7) where olsp26e01 presents

olsp22p22 includes genomic sequences adjacent to Cδ1.

Discussion
The analysis of cDNA libraries obtained from different
tissues permitted the identification of Ig exons expressed
in medaka (Oryzias latipes). ESTs coding for IgM and
IgD were identified but no expression or genomic data
was found for other isotypes in medaka.
In mammals, the production of secreted and membrane IgM forms involves alternative splicing. The transmembrane form is originated through a cryptic splice
site located within Cμ4 that have the acceptor site at 3’
of the TM1 exon [30]. This pattern is manifested in
Xenopus and cartilaginous fish too [31-33]. However, in
teleosts the transmembrane IgM is comprised of the
first three exons (Cμ1, Cμ2 and Cμ3) plus the transmembrane and cytoplasm exons [34,35]. The splicing
pattern of IgM appears consistent with exceptions only

in a few species, for example, membrane IgM chains
with different number of Cμ domains have been
described in ancient fishes [30,36], in which we observe
the general rule followed in teleost fishes, Cμ3 - TM, as
well as the mammalian pathway, Cμ4 - TM. However,
in Siberian Sturgeon, the splicing pattern can result in a
transmembrane immunoglobulin with four, two and
half, or only one Cμ domain [37]. Notothenioid teleosts
membrane IgM transcripts likewise lack the Cμ3, and
the Cμ2 is spliced to two short exons (RA and RB)
creating an elongated extracellular membrane-proximal
domain [38]. Nevertheless, the splicing observed in
medaka occurs between the end Cμ2 and TM1 and produces a membrane antigen receptor of only two constant immunoglobulin domains. This is the first time
that in a typical teleost is described to have a short

transmembrane IgM and indicates that other teleosts
may have evolved to exhibit considerable diversity in
IgM splicing. Such diversity may be due to a selection
process or due to “genomic configurations” that led to
the modification of the splicing machinery.
The medaka IgD transcripts studied correspond to the
membrane form and, just as in other teleosts, are chimeric, with the inclusion of Cμ1 and six Cδ exons. The
Cμ1 exon permits covalent association with light chains,
this kind of splicing (Cμ1 to Cδ exon) is not only
restricted to teleosts as it has recently been described in
porcine IgD transcripts. One interesting feature is that
medaka transcripts lack the canonical Cδ5 exon and this
finding is confirmed in the genomic sequence, where
IGHD loci seem to have been subjected to dramatic
recombination events leading to loss of the Cδ5 exon. A
high diversity in IGHD genes has been described in teleosts [39,40]. Seven Cδ domains comprise the backbone
of many bony fish delta chains, wherein a wide range of
domain organization within fish lineages is observed. In
the Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) [41] and
stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) [17], the IGHD
locus consists of the Cδ1-Cδ2-Cδ3-Cδ4-Cδ5-Cδ6-Cδ7TM1-TM2 exons, in which the homology of domains
CH2-CH5, CH3-CH6 and CH4-CH7 suggests that Cδ2Cδ3-Cδ4 duplicated to generate Cδ5-Cδ6-Cδ7 [17,39].
However, in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), grass carp
(Ctenopharyngodon idella) and catfish (Ictallurus punctatus) a duplication of Cδ2-Cδ3-Cδ4 has been described
[15,34,42]. In Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) the IGHD
locus has undergone rearrangement events leading to
the loss of Cδ3, Cδ4, Cδ5 and Cδ6 exons with a tandem
duplication of the Cδ1-Cδ2 region. It appears that diversification of IgD may be due to germline changes that
are species specific rather than due to different splicing
pattern as described in IgM. Therefore, only in sharks
partly of IgD, like W heavy chain, is diversified through
alternative splicing. Further studies are needed to understand the reason for this phenomenon and the biological/evolutive meaning of both mechanisms to generate
antibody diversity.
Analysis of ESTs showed that there were atypical IgM
and IgD transcripts (approx. 15%), which had stop
codons interrupting the reading frames. Most of them
lacked the VH region and contained a genomic
sequence, named exon 0, at the 5’ location, which is
spliced directly to the constant exons. It is common to
find sterile transcripts from light chain loci in teleosts,
and these may be associated to the high frequency of
enhancers in the IgL loci of bony fishes [43,44].
Recently, unusual IgD transcripts have also been
described in Salmo salar [45], wherein the VH and JH
sequences are not obvious and include genomic
sequences. In catfish [13], in which the Cδ1 is directly

Magadán-Mompó et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:165
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/165

spliced to leader exon, which was shown to be functional and capable of mediating secretion of IgD from
catfish B cells. The authors suggest the possibility that
this secreted IgD functions as a pattern-recognition
molecule. These results observed in the several teleost
species suggest an evolutive and functional role for nontraditional VHDJH rearrangement and needs to be studied in the future. In medaka, the splicing between exon
0 and the rest of the exons indicate that all components
of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, except the VH
region, are needed for a specific process in the teleosts.
The ESTs encoding medaka IgM present differences in
their Cμ nucleotide sequences, suggesting a duplicated
IGH locus in medaka. Therefore, when we scanned the
medaka genome with these ESTs we found a very complex locus, with five tandem duplicated Cμ. and Cδ
genes separated by VH, D and JH segments. In other
fishes we can find duplicated IGH loci, like in I. punctatus, G. aculeatus, S.salar [17,19,40,45] or, like in zebrafish (Danio rerio), only one IGH copy [46]. Duplicated
segments in medaka showed a high DNA level homology for exons and introns. The most probable explanation is such duplications occurred recently and take
place frequently. In the future, it would be of interest to
identify the mechanism responsible for this genetic
exchange. Preliminary data indicates the presence of
short repeated sequences (SRS)s at the beginning of
duplications suggesting their involvement in such
exchange processes (data not shown).
The current medaka whole genome sequence draft
presents a number of gaps that do not permit exact delineation of gene configuration. Just like in the case of
other vertebrates, the IGH locus has regions that are
quite difficult to sequence, due to the frequent presence
of SRS. Additionally, the analysis of the medaka germline IGH locus gave rise to uncertainties which on the
one hand suggested the lack of Cμ3 and on the other
identified Cδ7 as a pseudogene. The database of ESTs
and the recently released next generation sequence data
from Illumina enabled us to confirm the presence of
Cμ3 and Cδ7 as functional exons. However, the high
sequence homology between the duplicated segments
prevented us from providing a gap-free IGH locus annotation using this additional information.
Despite the medaka IGH locus having many genes, no
genes for IgT/Z have been so far identified as has been
the case in catfish [14]. Furthermore, we found exons
and even entire zones (Ex. zone 3) that were not
expressed. It is difficult to explain the evolutive significance of the presence of exons, which are predicted to
be functional (without stop codon or any other alteration in their sequences) but are not going to be
expressed. Perhaps the screening and sequencing of EST
libraries was not sensitive enough to detect mRNA in

Page 10 of 13

low concentrations. However, it seems improbable that
zone 3 could generate a functional antibody. A possible
explanation for sequence maintenance would be its relationship with the genetic locus structure itself. The high
number of recombinations may determine that the predicted functional exons cannot generate antibodies in
the medaka strain studied, even though antibodies were
expressed by non-homologue recombination in other
medaka fish. In order to verify this hypothesis, the
sequencing of these loci in other fish strains of the same
species should give us different haplotypes.
IGH locus duplications appear to be common in teleost fishes and should be favoured by natural selection.
These observations indicate that these duplications may
have arisen in a common ancestor teleost or are due to
independent gene duplications that occurred in each
specie through their specific phylogenetic history. The
fact that many teleosts appear to harbor duplications
may support the first hypothesis, however there are also
data that suggest an independent evolution in different
lineages. The high homology between different zones of
the IGH locus (as exons as introns) indicates recent
duplications processes. However, if they took place a
long time ago, then recombinations events would be
required to explain sequence maintenance. In medaka,
such duplications and recombinations could explain the
presence of immunoglobulin constant exons in germline
IGH locus, which are apparently functional but are not
expressed. The same reasoning can be applied in the
case of VH segments, to explain high homology between
members of the same family. Thus, all chromosome segments that contain the IGH locus would be subjected to
such duplication and recombination processes.
Duplicated genes have been identified in many teleostean fishes and it has been suggested that species diversity might be related to large-scale independent gene
duplications or to whole genome duplication in an
ancient teleost [47,48]. In the case of IGH locus several
particular issues remain to be explored. The mechanism
known as allelic exclusion prevents the production of
more than one specificity in a single lymphoid cell, only
one rearrangement product of immunoglobulin is transcribed and translates [49]. Studies of the allelic exclusion of immunoglobulin genes have been performed in
species in which a single IGH locus undergoes somatic
rearrangement through the lymphocyte development.
However, the mechanisms by which teleosts such as
medaka, stickleback, catfish, salmo with several IGH
locus duplications can exhibit allelic exclusion remains
unknown. In medaka, there are at least four IGH duplications that are functional. This means that one cell has
the possibility to produce four heavy chains at the same
time and therefore could deviate substantially from the
clonal selection theory. Eason et al. [50], identified

Magadán-Mompó et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:165
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/165

different productive gene transcripts in isolated single
peripheral blood lymphocytes from cartilaginous fish
(Raja eglanteria), indicating the possibility of simultaneous immunoglobulin heavy chains expression from
multiple different IGH loci in fishes. In cartilaginous
fishes, the IGH locus is arranged in multiple independent clusters, thus indicating that the regulation of
immunoglobulin expression could be very different from
teleost fishes in which the IGH locus is typically in
translocon configuration. The fundamental question
regarding the establishment and maintenance of haplotype exclusion in a complex multi-cluster- translocon
system such as found in medaka IGH locus remains
unanswered today.
Further studies are required to a) understand whether
IGH locus duplications involve additional biological
mechanisms in the immune system and b) to gauge the
potential evolutive advantages of such configurations to
the generation of immunoglobulin diversity in these
species.

Conclusions
The present study shows the genomic organization of
the IGH locus in medaka that has genes for IgM and
IgD however, no Cτ genes have been identified upstream
of the Cμ region. This IGH locus is very complex, with
five duplications that present high homology, being four
of them functional. Our results suggest that the IGH
locus duplication is very common among teleosts,
wherein the existence of a recombination process
explains the sequence homology between them.
