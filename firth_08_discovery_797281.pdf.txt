Abstract
Background: The genus Alphavirus includes several potentially lethal human viruses. Additionally,
species such as Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus are important vectors for gene therapy,
vaccination and cancer research, and important models for virion assembly and structural analyses.
The genome encodes nine known proteins, including the small '6K' protein. 6K appears to be
involved in envelope protein processing, membrane permeabilization, virion assembly and virus
budding. In protein gels, 6K migrates as a doublet – a result that, to date, has been attributed to
differing degrees of acylation. Nonetheless, despite many years of research, its role is still relatively
poorly understood.
Results: We report that ribosomal -1 frameshifting, with an estimated efficiency of ~10–18%,
occurs at a conserved UUUUUUA motif within the sequence encoding 6K, resulting in the
synthesis of an additional protein, termed TF (TransFrame protein; ~8 kDa), in which the Cterminal amino acids are encoded by the -1 frame. The presence of TF in the Semliki Forest virion
was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The expression patterns of TF and 6K were studied by pulsechase labelling, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, using both wild-type virus and a TF
knockout mutant. We show that it is predominantly TF that is incorporated into the virion, not 6K
as previously believed. Investigation of the 3' stimulatory signals responsible for efficient
frameshifting at the UUUUUUA motif revealed a remarkable diversity of signals between different
alphavirus species.
Conclusion: Our results provide a surprising new explanation for the 6K doublet, demand a
fundamental reinterpretation of existing data on the alphavirus 6K protein, and open the way for
future progress in the further characterization of the 6K and TF proteins. The results have
implications for alphavirus biology, virion structure, viroporins, ribosomal frameshifting, and
bioinformatic identification of novel frameshift-expressed genes, both in viruses and in cellular
organisms.

Background

The Alphavirus genus (reviewed in [1,2]) includes ≥29 species, many of which infect humans and livestock. Species
include Sindbis virus (SINV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV),
Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis
viruses (EEEV, WEEV, VEEV), Chikungunya virus, Ross
River virus (RRV), Middelburg virus (MIDV), Seal louse
virus (SESV) and Sleeping disease virus (SDV). Alphavirus
symptoms include infectious arthritis, rashes, fever and
potentially fatal encephalitis. Transmission is generally
via insects such as mosquitoes, with birds, rodents and
other mammals acting as reservoirs for many species. The
distribution of certain species has been expanding in
recent years [3] – a phenomenon that can only be
expected to continue as changing climate allows the insect
vectors to expand their ranges.
The single-stranded genomic RNA is positive sense and
about 11–12 kb long. It contains two long open reading
frames (ORFs) separated by a short non-coding sequence
(Figure 1). The 5'-proximal ORF codes for non-structural
proteins and often contains an internal stop codon readthrough site. The 3'-proximal ORF codes for an ~140 kDa
structural polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) that is translated
from a subgenomic RNA (26S sgRNA) and cleaved autocatalytically (to generate the capsid protein C) and by cellular proteases (to yield the envelope glycoproteins E1, E2
and E3). The virion has icosahedral symmetry with T = 4,
and comprises an inner nucleocapsid (240 copies of the
capsid protein enclosing the genomic RNA) and a tight
outer envelope composed of 240 copies of the envelope
proteins (arranged as 80 E1-E2 heterodimer trimeric
spikes) embedded in a lipid bilayer derived from the host
cell membrane [1]. E3 is present in the virion of some (e.g.
SFV) but not all (e.g. SINV) alphaviruses.
The 6K protein is a small, hydrophobic, cysteine-rich,
acylated protein, involved in envelope protein processing,
membrane permeabilization, virus budding and virus
assembly – though only small amounts of 6K are actually
incorporated into virions [1,4-14]. Mutations in 6K are
associated with greatly decreased virion production and/
or deformed multicored virions though, interestingly, 6K
deletion mutants are still viable [15-23]. Although 6K was

In this paper, we describe bioinformatic analyses that
allowed us to identify a frameshift site within the 6K coding sequence, and we provide experimental evidence that
verifies expression of the predicted transframe protein, TF.
Further characterization of the function(s) of TF is beyond
the scope of this paper and will be addressed in future
work. The results have implications for (i) alphavirus biology, (ii) virion structure, (iii) research into viroporins, (iv)
ribosomal frameshifting, and (v) bioinformatic identification of novel frameshift-expressed genes, both in viruses
and in cellular organisms (especially where the out-offrame ORF is short).

Results
A bioinformatic search identifies a likely frameshift site
Many viruses harbour sequences that induce a portion of
ribosomes to shift -1 nt and continue translating in the
new reading frame [24]. The -1 frameshift site typically
consists of a slippery heptanucleotide fitting the consensus motif X XXY YYZ, where X is any nucleotide, Y is A or
U, and Z is not G. This is followed by a 'spacer' region of
5–9 nt, and then a highly structured region – often a pseudoknot or hairpin. We first identified the potential -1
frameshift site in the alphavirus 6K coding sequence during a systematic search of virus genome alignments for
phylogenetically conserved frameshifting motifs (Firth,
unpublished). The slippery site U UUU UUA (spaces separate the polyprotein or zero-frame codons) – conforming
to the X XXY YYZ consensus – is conserved in 353 of the
357 alphavirus sequences in GenBank that contain the 6K
coding sequence (see methods for accession numbers of
all 357 sequences). This alone is highly significant since
amino acid conservation in the polyprotein frame only
requires conservation of three of these nucleotides. Interestingly, the same U UUU UUA motif is used at the GagPol -1 frameshift site in all Human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) groups, besides other primate lentiviruses.

previously observed to migrate as a doublet [7,15,16,21],
the potential for a ribosomal frameshift leading to two
different proteins appears to have been overlooked, perhaps in part because of the one-to-one stoichiometry of
the C, E3, E2 and E1 proteins in the virion. Instead the
doublet was explained as a result of differing degrees of
acylation [7,15].

Of the 328 sequences that contain ≥90 nt 3' of U UUU
UUA, potential 3' RNA secondary structures (Figures 2, 3,
4) were found in all except, possibly, Aura virus and the SF
complex. In some species the structure is exceptionally
stable – e.g. in VEEV there is a hairpin stem comprising
nine consecutive GC-pairs, while the salmonid alphaviruses have a predicted stem of 13 nt. The predicted hairpin
stem in the WEE complex is additionally supported by

Potential stimulatory RNA secondary structures for -1 frameshifting in representative alphavirus species.
Stems marked as 'potential' were not supported by dual luciferase mutational analyses (B Chung et al, in preparation), though it
is possible that they may still be important in the context of the full 26S sgRNA in virus-infected cells. Viruses: Seal louse (SESV)
– [GenBank:AF315122]; Middelburg (MIDV) – [GenBank:AF339486]; Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV) – [GenBank:NC_001449]; Ndumu (NDUV) – [GenBank:AF339487]; Sindbis (SINV) – [GenBank:NC_001547]; Barmah Forest (BFV) –
[GenBank:NC_001786]; Sleeping disease (SDV) – [GenBank:NC_003433]; Eastern equine encephalitis (EEEV) – [GenBank:NC_003899].

compensatory mutations (paired mutations that preserve
the base-pairings) – e.g. one position in the stem is occupied by an A:U, G:C or G:U pair depending on the species
and strain (Figure 3). Other species – such as MIDV, SESV
and Ndumu virus – have potential pseudoknots.
The downstream -1 frame ORF is short (generally 26–31
codons, though as short as 8 codons in Aura virus, and

reaching 50 codons in Ndumu virus) resulting, after presumed cleavage at the N-terminus of 6K, in the alternative
protein TF (Figure 5). The N-terminal end of TF retains
~71–83% of 6K – including the hydrophobic transmembrane region [12] – but has an altered and generally elongated C-terminal end (typically ~8 kDa product), often
with even more Cys residues than 6K (Figure 5). This
region of the genome shows unusually high nucleotide

Figure 3 (see previous page)
Potential downstream RNA secondary structures in all sequences analysed
Potential downstream RNA secondary structures in all sequences analysed. (Continued in Figure 4.) As of 20
April 2008, there were 357 alphavirus sequences in GenBank with coverage of the U UUU UUA motif in the 6K cistron. The
100 nt region starting from the U UUU UUA motif, and including the first 93 nt of 3'-adjacent sequence, was extracted from all
357 sequences (although in 26 sequences a shorter region had to be used due to incomplete sequence data). Shown here are
the 108 unique ≤100-nt sequences, plus an additional seven duplicate sequences also included since they have different species/
strain annotations. The total number of duplicate sequences represented by each sequence shown is given in column 1, while
column 2 gives an example GenBank accession number for the sequence, and column 3 gives the virus name abbreviation.
Potential RNA secondary structures were identified using a combination of RNAfold and alidot [36], pknots [37], and manual
inspection. Bases within potential stems are indicated either in colour or with underlines (if overlapping other potential stems)
and potential base-pairings are indicated with brackets – '()', '[]' or '<>'. '<>' signify more dubious base-pairings, including stems
that were experimentally shown not to affect frameshifting efficiency (dual luciferase assays with inserts comprising the U UUU
UUA motif and 3'-adjacent sequence; B Chung et al, in preparation). Base variations that maintain base-pairings are marked in
bold. Note that not all sequences in GenBank represent functional (infectious) viruses and it is possible that certain sequences
whose shift site and/or predicted RNA structure do not conform with the majority of isolates for the same species may represent defective viruses – for example the non-standard slippery heptanucleotide in the SPDV sequence AJ012631 is due to a 36codon deletion in 6K relative to other SPDV sequences.

conservation (Figure 6) – as expected for sequence that is
coding in two overlapping reading frames, besides containing the frameshift stimulatory signals and the 6K-E1
cleavage site.
Of the four sequences (out of 357) that do not contain the
U UUU UUA motif, two are identical defective Salmon
pancreas disease virus sequences with C UUU UUA as a
direct consequence of a 36-codon deletion (between the
'C' and first 'U') within 6K [25] (11 other salmonid
alphavirus sequences all have U UUU UUA). Another – an
EEEV sequence with U UUU UUG – may also represent a
defective sequence since there are 59 other EEEV
sequences all with U UUU UUA. The fourth sequence –
the only 6K sequence for Bebaru virus – appears to completely lack the U UUU UUA motif. However, Bebaru
virus does contain a 47-codon -1 frame ORF (5' terminus
determined by alignment to the frameshift site in other
alphavirus species), or up to 94 codons (if frameshifting
occurs at a different location), suggesting that TF is also
present in Bebaru virus.
Amino acid sequencing confirms expression of the
predicted transframe protein TF
Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/
MS/MS) of in-gel trypsin and chymotrypsin digests of low
molecular mass products from purified SFV virions demonstrated the presence of a number of tryptic peptides that
derive from the C-terminal (frameshifted) region of TF
and that are not present in the non-frameshifted 6K protein or in any other SFV protein (Table 1; Additional file
1; MASCOT scores ≥ 20; mass errors < 3 ppm). These peptides include SLSFLSATEPR and TFDSNAER (Figure 7B).
Presence of the peptide SLSFLSATEPR, whose coding
sequence spans the frameshift site U UUU UUA, indicates
that tandem slippage occurs (i.e. A-site tRNALeu pairs to

UUA and then slips to UUU, while P-site tRNAPhe slips on
the tetranucleotide U UUU). The slippage site-encoded
peptides SLSFL and SLSFLV were also detected. Interestingly the latter, due to the C-terminal 'V', could only originate from the non-frameshift 6K protein, though relative
amounts could not be established from this data. Additionally, various subsequences of the peptides MLEDNVDRPGYYDLLQAALTCR and ENNAEATLR – which
derive from the E3 protein – were also detected. The mass
spectrometry data also supported assignment of the transslippage site peptide SLSFF (Table 1; Additional file 1;
MASCOT score = 15). This indicates the presence of some
P-site slippage – i.e. P-site tRNAPhe slips on the tetranucleotide U UUU with no tRNA in the A-site, and then a new
tRNAPhe pairs to UUU in the A-site.
No purely N-terminal 6K/TF peptides were detected. The
predicted tryptic cleavage products for this region are
ASVAETMAYLWDQNQALFWLEFAAPVACILIITYCLR and
NVLCCCK, both of which contain potential palmitoylation sites (Cys residues; [15,16]). Although the various
possibilities for palmitoylation were taken into account in
the peptide database search, poor ionization of peptides
with palmitoyl derivatives could explain why there were
no detections. Furthermore, large peptides such as the 37mer are unlikely to trigger the MS/MS scan.
Phenotype of a TF knockout/truncation mutant (TF-)
To investigate the phenotype of a TF knockout mutant, we
introduced a point mutation into an infectious clone of
SFV. The mutant, TF-, differs from wild-type (WT) SFV by
just a single point mutation, CUG → CUU, 9 nt 3' of U
UUU UUA (polyprotein-frame codons shown). The
mutation is synonymous with respect to the polyprotein
frame, but introduces a premature termination codon
(UAG) into TF (Figure 7A). Phenotypes were assessed by

Figure sequences for the 6K and TF proteins for representative alphavirus sequences
Peptide 5
Peptide sequences for the 6K and TF proteins for representative alphavirus sequences. The frameshift site (amino
acids 'FL', except in BEBV) is shown in bold. For BEBV, which lacks the U UUU UUA motif, the approximate location of the
presumed frameshift was determined by alignment to the other sequences. '|'s represent the E2-6K and 6K-E1 cleavage sites
and '*'s represent the TF protein termination codon.

plaque assays in BHK cells. The TF- mutant showed only
an ~56% reduction in growth (7.5 ± 0.4 × 108 PFU/ml)
relative to WT (1.7 ± 0.1 × 109 PFU/ml). RT-PCR and
sequencing of RNA extracted from the infected cells used
to propagate virions for the plaque assays, as well as a portion of the virions, confirmed the presence of the appropriate virus (WT or TF-; data not shown). Note that codon
usage may be a factor in the reduced-growth phenotype of
TF-, since the CUU codon is used ~5× less frequently in the

SFV genome than the CUG codon (20 and 102 occurrences, respectively).
Location and abundance of TF
SFV-infected cells were labelled with [35S]Met/Cys, and
proteins from cell lysate and from purified virions were
subjected to SDS-PAGE. Consistent with previous results
(e.g. [7]; SINV), a virus-specific 6K doublet was observed
(Figure 8), where the more slowly migrating band (con-

Figure 6 (see previous page)
Phylogenetic nucleotide conservation plots for selected alphavirus within-species full-genome sequence alignments
Phylogenetic nucleotide conservation plots for selected alphavirus within-species full-genome sequence alignments. The nucleotide conservation in a 51-nt sliding window is expressed as a p-value plot, giving the probability that the
conservation in the window would be as great or greater than that observed, if a given null model (CDS annotation) was true.
Here the null model was set to 'non-coding' in order to give a straightforward nucleotide conservation plot. Plots are given for
alignments of (1a) 7 Sindbis virus (SINV) sequences, (2a) 9 Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) sequences, (3a) 22 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) sequences, and (4a) 19 Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) sequences. Panels (1-4b) show the
phylogenetically summed sequence divergence (mean number of base variations per nucleotide column) for the sequences that
contribute to the statistics at each position in the alignment. In any particular column, some sequences may be omitted from
the statistical calculations due to alignment gaps. Statistics in regions with lower summed divergence (i.e. partially gapped
regions) have a lower signal-to-noise ratio and/or may be omitted from the plot. Panels (1-4c) show the location of the nonstructural (CDS1; green) and structural (CDS2; green) CDSs, the non-coding regions (black), and the location of the overlapping -1 frame ORF (red), in the GenBank RefSeqs NC_001547 (SINV), NC_003899 (EEEV), NC_001449 (VEEV) and
NC_004162 (CHIKV). The location of the U UUU UUA motif coincides with the 5' end of this ORF. Plots were produced with
the CDS-plotcon webserver (Firth, unpublished).

sistent with the predicted size of TF, ~8.3 kDa) was much
fainter than the other band (consistent with the predicted
size of 6K, ~6.6 kDa) for cell lysate (Figure 9, lanes 1, 3),
but was the predominant band for the virion sample (Figure 9, lanes 5, 7). Correspondence of the more slowly
migrating band to TF was verified by comparing migration
patterns for WT SFV and the TF- mutant on the same SDSPAGE. In the TF- lysate, the more slowly migrating band
disappeared, while the intensity of the other band
remained essentially unchanged (Figure 9, lanes 2, 4),
thus conclusively demonstrating that the more slowly
migrating band corresponds to TF. Interestingly, there may
be a very small amount of TF in the TF- virion sample (Figure 9, lane 8), indicating some reversion from TF- to WT.
A fainter band migrating just behind the TF band (e.g. Figure 9, lanes 7, 8) may represent some unglycosylated E3
(glycosylated E3 migrates at ~13 kDa; the predicted size of
unmodified E3 is ~7.4 kDa).
Although comparison of the WT and TF- SDS-PAGE migration patterns conclusively identifies the TF band, further

(A)

confirmation for both the 6K and TF bands was obtained
via immunoprecipitation using separate Abs raised
against two 14 amino acid peptides (Figure 7B) – Ab6KTF-N (SFV 6K/TF amino acids 2–15; N-term) and AbTF-C (SFV TF amino acids 52–65; C-term). A third Ab, Ab6K-C, raised against SFV 6K amino acids 49–60 (6K Cterm) was also produced, but proved ineffective due to the
poor antigenicity of this peptide. In fact, the very small
size and overall poor antigenicity of the 6K protein proved
very restrictive, so that the Ab-6KTF-N antigen was also
predicted to be quite poor. In lysate from SFV-infected
cells, Ab-TF-C preferentially immunoprecipitated TF (Figure 10, lanes 7, 9). A small amount of 6K also visible in
lane 7 is presumably a result of imperfect purification in
the immunoprecipitation – indeed, this occurred to some
extent in all lanes for the higher mass, higher Met/Cyscontent, virus proteins (data not shown). Nonetheless,
given that TF is much less abundant than 6K in the nonimmunoprecipitated cell lysate (Figure 9, lane 1), the
affinity of Ab-TF-C for TF is clear. Ab-TF-C also immunoprecipitated TF from purified SFV virions (Figure 10, lane

Lanes 1–3: total lysate from SFV-infected (WT; 1 hr and

purified from the media (WT) and mock purified virions from
non-infected cells (-). Equal amounts of transfecting RNA and
cells were used for each sample. All lanes are from the same
gel – exposed on x-ray film for 2 weeks to enhance the faint
bands corresponding to any low molecular mass products.

Although Ab-6KTF-N was expected to also immunoprecipitate TF, this was not observed (except for a very faint
band in the virion sample; Figure 10, lane 5) – perhaps
partly due to the much lower abundance of TF relative to
6K in cell lysate, but another possibility is that the high
degree of palmitoylation inferred for TF, but not 6K (see

Appendix 1), interferes with Ab binding. As expected, in
lysate from cells infected with the TF- mutant, Ab-6KTF-N
immunoprecipitated 6K (Figure 10, lanes 2, 4), but Ab-TFC failed to immunoprecipitate TF (Figure 10, lanes 8, 10).
Similarly, Ab-TF-C failed to immunoprecipitate TF from
TF- virions (Figure 10, lane 12).
In SFV, both 6K and TF have one Met and five Cys residues, so the 6K:TF molar ratio is proportional to the ratio
of the 6K and TF band intensities. In cell lysate, the molar
amount of TF relative to 6K, as determined by densitometry, was ~18% (Figure 9, lane 1), implying a frameshift
efficiency, TF/(6K+TF), of ~15%. The molar ratio of 6K+TF
to the capsid protein (8 Met, 4 Cys) was close to the
expected value of unity. In contrast, in protein prepared
from purified virions, the molar ratio of TF may have been

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/108

as high as ~15% relative to the capsid protein, but only
very small amounts of 6K (< 25% the amount of TF) were
detected (Figure 9, lane 7). Interestingly, when TF was
knocked out, the amount of 6K in the virion sample
seemed to increase (Figure 9, lane 8); though an alternative explanation is that this band now represents palmitoylated C-terminally truncated TF (cf. discussion).
Immunofluorescence imaging of both permeabilized and
non-permeabilized SFV-infected cells resulted in strong
fluorescence when using Ab-TF-C, indicating that TF is
present both intracellularly and at the cell surface (Figure
11, Additional file 2A). No significant fluorescence was
detected, when using Ab-TF-C, for non-infected cells or,
importantly, for cells infected with the TF- mutant (confirming the specificity of Ab-TF-C). In images produced
using Ab-6KTF-N, fluorescence was generally weaker (presumably reflecting the poorer antigenicity of the N-terminal peptide) and there was some background fluorescence
for non-infected cells. Nonetheless there was clear abovebackground fluorescence for both WT- and TF--infected
cells, showing that 6K is also present both intracellularly
and at the cell surface (Figure 11, Additional file 2B). A
general anti-SFV Ab showed strong fluorescence for both
WT- and TF--infected cells, but no significant fluorescence
for non-infected cells (Figure 11, Additional file 2C).
Analysis of 3' elements that stimulate frameshifting
The frameshift efficiencies of the slippery heptanucleotide
U UUU UUA and 3'-adjacent sequence from SFV, SINV,
EEEV, VEEV, MIDV, SDV and SESV were compared in cell
culture by means of dual luciferase reporter assays [26]. A

complete description of this work is presented in a separate manuscript (B Chung et al, in preparation) but certain
results are summarized here as they are pertinent to the
discussion that follows. Frameshift efficiencies ranging
from 5% to 40% (depending on species) were measured
for WT sequence, with results for SFV and SINV ranging
from 10% to 17% (depending on insert length). The close
agreement with our measurement of ~15% for SFVinfected cells (see above), and the range of 10–18% that
may be derived from data presented in refs. [7,15] for
SINV-infected cells (see Appendix 1), lends credence to
the supposition that these values are not unrepresentative
of the frameshift efficiencies in the context of the full 26S
sgRNA in virus-infected cells. In any case, it is clear that
the U UUU UUA motif and 3'-adjacent sequence are capable of stimulating high levels of frameshifting. In contrast,
a SINV insert in which the slippery heptanucleotide U
UUU UUA was mutated to U UUC UUA had <0.5%
frameshifting. Additional constructs in which groups of
nucleotides were mutated to disrupt predicted 3' stimulatory structures and/or to maintain predicted structures but
with reversed base-pairings, supported the predicted hairpin stem in SINV and a pseudoknot in MIDV (Figures 2,
3, 4; B Chung et al, in preparation). Comparison of deletion series of inserts indicated that only a single stem was
important in SINV, EEEV, VEEV and SDV but, in SESV, a
predicted pseudoknot was supported. Interestingly, we
were unable to find a compact 3' RNA secondary structure
in the SF complex (with the possible exception of Mayaro
virus), though the dual luciferase assays did show that the
3' sequence – in particular the first 14 nt after the U UUU
UUA motif – is important for efficient frameshifting.

Discussion
Previous analyses of the 6K doublet
In light of the results presented here, it is vitally important
to revisit and reinterpret many earlier results regarding the
6K doublet. The fact that '6K' is present in two forms was
first demonstrated and investigated by Gaedigk-Nitschko
& Schlesinger [7]. The authors concluded that one form,
which they labelled '4K', was a partially acylated form of
the other, which they labelled '6K'. We now propose that
'4K' equates to 6K and '6K' is in fact TF, both of which may
be acylated to varying degrees. A full reanalysis of the
diverse results presented in refs. [7,15,16] is given in
Appendix 1. Key observations include: (i) a number of
anomalies in the old data that were inconsistent with the
old explanation for the 6K doublet, are perfectly consistent with the new frameshifting explanation; (ii) after
adjusting for the SINV TF:6K Cys ratio being 9:5, the
frameshifting efficiency in SINV-infected cells may be calculated from the old data, and ranges from 10–18%; (iii)
TF appears to be much more heavily palmitoylated than
6K (~1 fatty acid on 6K and ~5–7 on TF for SINV; fewer

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/108

fatty acids on TF for SFV); and (iv) in SINV and SFV, TF but
not 6K is present in the virion.
Involvement of 6K and TF in virus budding
Previous studies of 6K mutants have demonstrated a
number of roles for the 6K region. There is, at some level,
a dichotomy of phenotypes. For 6K deletion mutants,
Δ6K, (which produce neither 6K nor TF), virus yield tends
to be greatly reduced, but those virions that are produced
appear to have normal morphology and infectivity
[17,19] (SFV). In this case, the C-term of E2 replaces the
C-term of 6K as the signal peptide for E1 so that the envelope proteins E1 and E2 are processed more-or-less normally [6,8,17]. Other mutants which appear to knock out
6K/TF function via partial deletions [21] (SINV), insertions [18] (SINV), or a SINV-RRV 6K chimera that disrupts
the 3' end of the TF sequence [10], have a similar phenotype, although envelope protein processing may also be
defective. On the other hand, when just one or a few
amino acids within 6K/TF are mutated to different amino
acids, the yield is reduced but often the virion morphology is also affected, with many virions appearing distorted
and multicored (i.e. comprising several nucleocapsids
within one membrane structure) [15,16,20,27]. Nonetheless, virions produced by such mutants are often still
infectious. Thus it has been proposed that a major role of
6K lies in late stage virus assembly or budding, though it
is now unclear whether this role is played by 6K or TF or
both.

The 6K protein itself has been shown to possess properties
typical of a viroporin (i.e. small viral proteins that, among
other functions, increase membrane permeability and create conditions that favour virus budding; reviewed in
[13]). Besides its hydrophobic transmembrane region,
individual expression of 6K increases membrane permeability in E. coli [28] (SFV), mammalian cells [12] (SINV),
and Xenopus oocytes [14] (SINV). (Note, however, that
some of these results are now confounded, since there may
be co-expression of low levels of a C-terminally truncated
[6K-sized] TF product, whose phenotypic effects may be
mixed with those of 6K.) RRV and Barmah Forest virus 6K
proteins have been shown to form ion channels in planar
lipid bilayers [11]. Furthermore, most or all of 6K appears
to associate with p62-E1 (p62 is the precursor of E3 and
E2) heterodimers soon after synthesis, with which it is
transported to the cell surface [9] (SFV). Thus it appears
likely that 6K, at least, is involved in budding.
It is interesting however that, while 6K and TF both share
the transmembrane region, in TF but not in 6K this tends
(depending on species) to be followed by a region rich in
basic residues – a characteristic of HIV-1 Vpu and several
other viroporins [13]. Indeed SINV 6K partial deletion
mutants have been shown to be partially complemented

by Vpu [22] – a result which could reflect functions of
either 6K or TF. Thus TF may also play an important role
in budding. Frameshifting may be necessary to provide TF
with a hydrophilic C-term while maintaining a hydrophobic C-term in 6K to act as the signal peptide sequence for
E1. The heavy palmitoylation inferred for TF (see Appendix 1) suggests an association with lipid bilayers, particularly the plasma membrane. (It remains to be determined
what directs the much heavier palmitoylation inferred for
TF than for 6K – for example, whether it is related to the
differing C-terminal sequences, or to the fact that 6K, but
not TF, is synthesized C-terminally joined to E1. In any
case, the difference is likely to have important consequences for the differential sorting, function and stability
of the two proteins [29].) Finally, our immunofluorescence data also suggest that TF plays a role at the cell surface.
Mutation of three potential Cys palmitoylation sites (all 5'
of the frameshift site) in SINV 6K/TF resulted, as expected,
in reduced palmitoylation of '6K' (i.e. TF), and a phenotype comprising virions that were infectious but often distorted and multicored, slower budding, and yield reduced
to 10–30% of WT [15]. A similar phenotype was observed
for a mutant in which four Cys residues were replaced
[16]. Since it appears to be TF that is heavily palmitoylated, rather than 6K, these phenotypes may relate
more to the function of TF than 6K (although impairment
of a 6K function due simply to the altered 6K peptide
sequence, and/or removal of the low amount of 6K palmitoylation, can not be ruled out). In other words, the effects
on virion morphology and/or budding usually associated
with 6K, may in fact be largely due to TF. This is also consistent with the phenotype of the SINV-RRV chimera of
ref. [10] – instead of reduced budding being due to the
replacement of SINV 6K with RRV 6K, it could be due to
the absence of both SINV and RRV WT TF.
Further evidence comes from complementation studies
using a SINV mutant in which amino acids 24–45 of 6K
had been deleted [21]. The deletion removes the
frameshift site so that no TF can be produced. The mutant
was defective in the processing and transport of envelope
proteins (as expected since the C-term of 6K contains the
signal peptide for E1) and in plaque phenotype. A revertant virus, containing a point mutation in the deleted 6K
gene (which increased hydrophobicity), corrected the
defects of envelope protein processing and transport (presumably by partially restoring the signal peptide for E1),
but it still remained attenuated compared to WT, exhibiting defects in virus budding. Neither mutant nor revertant
viruses were complemented by the co-expression in trans
of a WT 6K gene. That the mutant was not complemented
in trans is not surprising, since the E1 signal peptide clearly
can not operate in trans. However, the fact that the rever-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/108

tant also retained defects in virus budding when 6K was
co-expressed in trans, is strong evidence that TF plays an
important role in budding (in SINV, the TF coding
sequence extends ~15 codons 3' of the 6K coding
sequence and, therefore, TF will not be present in its
native form when 6K is expressed in trans).
On the other hand, our own SFV TF knockout mutant, TF, only exhibited an ~56% reduction in growth compared
to WT. While statistically significant, and consistent with
a role for TF in virus yield, the reduction is nonetheless
modest and does not account for the full reduction in
growth seen for the Δ6K mutant (50–98%; [17,19]),
unless the difference is due to reversion of TF- to WT. Thus
we propose that probably both 6K and TF play roles in
virus budding. Alternatively, perhaps it is simply the
absence of the C-term of 6K, and/or the fact that TF is not
synthesized C-terminally joined to E1, that is important
for TF function. These properties are preserved in the truncated TF protein produced by the TF- mutant, and this may
explain the fairly modest effect on virus growth. A full
characterization of the newly discovered TF protein is
beyond the scope of this paper, and will be addressed in
future work.
A possible role for TF in the virion
Our SDS-PAGE results show that it is predominantly TF
rather than 6K that is incorporated into the SFV virion.
These results are supported by our reinterpretion of the
SINV data in refs. [7,15] (see Appendix 1). The abundance
of '6K' (i.e. TF) in the virion has been previously determined as ranging from 7–30 copies [1], cf. 240 copies
each for the capsid and envelope proteins. However previous estimates now need to be adjusted in cases where the
number of Met or Cys residues (as appropriate) in the TF
sequence differs from the number in the assumed 6K
sequence. Table 1 of ref. [7] shows, after multiplying by 5/
9 (for the re-evaluated number of Cys residues), that the
molar ratio of TF in the SINV virion is ~4.4% relative to
the other virion components. Elsewhere in ref. [7], corrected estimates range from 4.4% to 6.7%. Similarly, the
ranges 25–30 [18] and 24–30 [20] for SINV translate to a
range of 5.6% to 6.9%. The value of ~3% derived in ref.
[9] for the SFV virion using [35S]Met remains unchanged
(here both TF and 6K have one Met residue). Intriguingly,
the TF band in our SDS-PAGE results appeared darker
than expected for a molar ratio of 3–7%, and densitometry indicated that the molar ratio may have been as high
as ~15%.

As numerous authors have previously noted with regards
to 6K [15,18,19,23,27], it is unclear whether it is the presence of TF within the virion – as a structural component –
that is responsible for the virion defects seen in 6K/TF
mutants, or whether 6K/TF play their role solely at the

budding and assembly stage – i.e. 6K/TF are required to
achieve proper budding resulting in a 'stable' virion but
the fact that TF is incorporated into the virion is accidental, and possibly restricted only to defective virions.
Given that the discrepancy between the molar ratio of TF
in the virion (~3–15%) and the molar ratio of TF at translation (~10–18%) is considerably less than previously
supposed (i.e. for 6K), the argument for '6K' (i.e. TF)
being merely an accidental inclusion in the virion is now
perhaps weakened. Apparently, when WT TF or no TF is
incorporated into the virion, virion morphology is moreor-less normal [17-19,21], but when mutant TF is incorporated into the virion, virions may be distorted [15,20].
This could be a direct effect of TF as a structural component of the virion (though an alternative model, proposed
by ref. [18], is that when 6K/TF are absent, a low rate of
budding of normal virions takes place at regions where
the cell membranes naturally have high curvature and
thus does not require the membrane-altering properties of
6K/TF). The observation that the aberrant virion morphology of some SINV 6K/TF mutants is restored to WT by certain mutations in E2 [20,27] may also support a structural
role for TF. If TF is indeed a symmetrically-arranged structural component of the virion, then the fact that the location of '6K' in the virion has not yet been determined by
cryo-electron microscopy [30] may partly be a consequence of attempting to fit 6K instead of TF into the cryoEM maps. Since Δ6K virions appear to have normal morphology and infectivity, if TF does play a role in the virion,
then it is presumably a relatively minor role and/or only
important under certain conditions. Nonetheless, compared to WT, SFV Δ6K virions have been shown to exhibit
reduced stability, as manifested by a greater sensitivity to
inactivation by heat [19] and low pH [23], besides
decreased fusion capability [23].
The frameshift efficiency may be tuned to help control the
stoichiometry of TF in the virion, although the fact that
the level of frameshifting is apparently substantially
higher than the ~5% virion molar ratio generally found
for TF, and potentially varies between species (B Chung et
al, in preparation), hints that varying amounts of TF may
be 'diverted' en route to the developing virion and/or that
TF also plays other roles in infected cells, such as in budding and membrane permeabilization, as discussed
above. Implicitly, production of E1 is predicted to be
reduced by the level of frameshifting (i.e. ~10–18% for
SFV and SINV), thus leaving a surplus of C, E3 and E2.

porated into the virion. We suggest that TF plays a
stabilizing role in the virion structure, 6K plays a role in
envelope protein processing, and probably both TF and
6K play a role in virus budding. The functional importance of frameshifting – as reflected by its wide conservation – may be to provide TF with a hydrophilic C-term
while maintaining a hydrophobic C-term in 6K, and/or to
help control the stoichiometry of TF in the virion.
Evidence presented here includes: (i) the nearly ubiquitous presence of a U UUU UUA motif in the 6K coding
sequence throughout the Alphavirus genus; (ii) the presence of stable hairpin or pseudoknot RNA structures just
3' of the U UUU UUA motif in most alphavirus complexes; (iii) mass spectrometry of 6–8 kDa products isolated from purified SFV virions clearly shows the presence
of the predicted transframe peptide sequences; (iv) a TF
knockout mutant, that differed from WT SFV by a single
point mutation synonymous in the polyprotein frame,
showed an ~56% reduction in growth; (v) an SDS-PAGE
of purified SFV virions and lysate from SFV-infected cells
showed virus-specific bands at ~8.3 kDa (the predicted
size of TF) and at ~6.6 kDa (the predicted size of 6K), with
the ~8.3 kDa band being much fainter than the ~6.6 kDa
band for cell lysate, but with the ~8.3 kDa band being
much stronger than the ~6.6 kDa band for the virion; and
(vi) identification of the ~6.6 kDa and ~8.3 kDa bands as
corresponding to 6K and TF, respectively, was confirmed
both by comparison of SDS-PAGE migration patterns for
WT and TF- mutant viruses and by immunoprecipitation.
Furthermore, dual luciferase assays confirmed that the
slippery heptanucleotide U UUU UUA and 3' sequence in
SFV, SINV, EEEV, VEEV, MIDV, SDV and SESV were sufficient to induce high levels of ribosomal frameshifting in
cell culture (B Chung et al, in preparation), while reinterpretation of diverse previous publications provides extensive additional evidence.

Conclusion

This discovery sheds new light on the enigmatic 6K protein. Previous investigations into the role of 6K were no
doubt hampered by the false assumption that 6K and TF
were one and the same protein and, consequently, the
assumed amino acid sequence of TF was incorrect. As a
virion component, knowledge of TF may be important for
structural studies, and may have relevance to understanding virion stability, tropism, fusion and antigenicity, and
hence the use of alphaviruses as gene therapy and vaccination vectors. The new results presented here have opened
the way to a radical reinterpretation of existing data on the
alphavirus 6K (and TF) proteins, and may allow more
rapid future progress in their further characterization.

We have demonstrated the existence of a ribosomal -1
frameshift site in the alphavirus structural polyprotein,
that gives rise to the transframe protein TF, and demonstrated that it is primarily TF, rather than 6K, that is incor-

While the majority of known ribosomal frameshift sites
provide access to a long out-of-frame ORF, here the outof-frame ORF is unusual in that it has only 8–50 codons.

Frameshifting involving such short ORFs is easy to overlook; indeed the only well-characterized cellular example
– namely the eubacterial gene dnaX (reviewed in [31]) –
was discovered fortuitously. Widespread use of ribosomal
frameshifting into short out-of-frame ORFs has been proposed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (and, by implication,
other organisms) as a regulatory mechanism (e.g. by
inducing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) [32]. However, to what extent such sites are phylogenetically conserved remains to be addressed. The identification of a
new phylogenetically conserved frameshift site in a genus
as well-studied as the alphaviruses highlights the possibility that many such sites may remain undetected, not only
in other viruses, but also in cellular genes.
From a bioinformatic point of view, the keys to efficiently
locating such sites are (i) to search for phylogenetically
conserved frameshift signals in order to find sites were the
out-of-frame ORF is too short to detect with gene-finding
software, and (ii) to search for short overlapping genes
with sensitive gene-finding software in order to find sites
where the frameshift signals do not conform to known
patterns. We recently demonstrated (ii) by locating a short
overlapping gene in the Potyviridae family, translated as a
transframe fusion product by an as yet unidentified mechanism [33]. In this paper, we have demonstrated the efficacy of (i). Besides viral genomes, both methods are
readily applicable to, for example, alignments of mammalian or vertebrate mRNAs.

Methods
Bioinformatics
As of 20 April 2008, GenBank contained whole-genome
RefSeqs for 14 alphavirus species and 1643 alphavirus
sequences in total (i.e. including partial sequences).
Among these 1643 sequences, those with 6K coverage
were identified by applying tblastn [34] using the 6K peptide sequences derived from the 14 RefSeqs as query
sequences, resulting in 357 sequences.

SFV infectious clone
The plasmid pSP6-SFV4, transcription from which produces infectious SFV4, has been previously described [17].
Antibodies
The following rabbit Abs (Genscript) were used: Ab-6KTFN – raised against peptide sequence SVAETMAYLWDQNQC (SFV 6K and TF amino acids 2–15 + 'C'), and
Ab-TF-C – raised against peptide sequence TEPRGNRQSLRTFDC (SFV TF amino acids 52–65 + 'C'). A rabbit
anti-SFV polyclonal Ab, described in ref. [35], was also
used for immunofluorescence.
Mass spectrometry
BHK-21 cells (ATCC) were maintained and transfected by
electroporation with in vitro transcribed RNA as described
previously [17]. At 24 hr post-electroporation, SFV4 virions were concentrated from the medium by ultracentrifugation. Briefly, the medium was filtered through a 0.22
μm filter before being subjected to centrifugation through
a 20% sucrose cushion (20% sucrose in TNE; Tris-HCL pH
7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05 mM EDTA) in a Beckman SW28
rotor (25 krpm, 2 hr, 4°C). The virus pellet was then
resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and the SFV4 virion
proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (16% Tricine gels;
InVitrogen), and stained with Coomassie Blue to verify
purity of the sample. Gel slices containing low molecular
mass products were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion.
A portion of the trypsin digest was subsequently also subjected to a mild (~20 mins) chymotrypsin digest.

LC/MS/MS data were acquired using a LTQ-FT hybrid
mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Corp). Peptide
molecular masses were measured by Fourier transformion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR). Peptide sequencing
was performed by collision-induced dissociation (CID) in
the linear ion trap of the LTQ-FT instrument. Digest samples were introduced by nanoLC (Eksigent, Inc.) with
nano-electrospray ionization (ThermoElectron Corp).
NanoLC was performed using a homemade C18
nanobore column (75 μm i.d. × 10 cm; Atlantis C18
[Waters Corp.]; 3 μm particle size). Peptides were eluted
from a 50-min linear gradient run from 4% acetonitrile
(with 0.1% formic acid) to 70% acetonitrile (with 0.1%
formic acid).
Peptides were identified using the MASCOT search engine
using a custom database including the SFV4 6K, TF and E3

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/108

sequences. The possibility of palmitoyl modifications on
Cys, Lys, Ser or Thr residues was also included. Decoy
searches were performed using the entire Mass Spectrometry Data Base (MSDB; i.e. all taxonomies). Such searches
identified a number of other proteins (mostly contaminating keratins). However, no non-alphavirus proteins
were clearly identified with peptides matching SLSFLSATEPR, TFDSNAER, SLSFLV or SLSFF (i.e. with the
same molecular ions and MS/MS sequence information).
There were some putative hits for the peptide molecular
ions but, in each case, no other peptides were also found
for the same protein – thus the probability of such assignments being real is very low.
TF knockout mutant, TFMethylated (NEB) pSP6-SFV4 was used as template for
PCR using KOD polymerase (Novagen) and primers 41TF
(GCCTTTCTTTTTTAGTGCTACTTAGCCTCGGGGC) and
41TR (GCCCCGAGGCTAAGTAGCACTAAAAAAGAAAG
GC). PCR product was then transformed into DH5αT1
cells (InVitrogen) and plated on Ampicillin-LB plates.
Propagated plasmids were sequenced with primers 6KF
(ATATCGATCTTCGCGTCG) and 6KR (ACCGTCTTGTACTCACAG) prior to in vitro transcription.
Plaque assays
BHK-21 cells were transfected by electroporation with
SFV4 or TF- RNA in triplicate and incubated for 24 hr.
Virus release into the supernatant was quantified by
plaque assay. BHK cells were infected with 10-fold dilutions of each supernatant for 1 hr. The virus innoculum
was then removed and cells were overlayed with 1.8%
agarose containing medium. After 48 hr incubation, cells
were fixed with 4% formalin and plaques were visualized
with crystal violet.
Pulse chase
Metabollic labelling of BHK-21 cells transfected with SFV4
or TF- was done essentially as described previously [8].
Cells were pulsed with [35S]Met/Cys (Perkin Elmer) for 30
min, 8 hr post-electroporation. Cells were then incubated
in growth medium containing 10-fold excess of unlabelled methionine and cysteine for 1 or 15 hr. The supernatents were then collected and the cells were lysed with a
Triton X-100 containing buffer. The presence of 6K and TF
in lysates was determined by immunoprecipitation with
Ab-6KTF-N or Ab-TF-C, followed by SDS-PAGE (10–20%
Tricine gradient gels; InVitrogen).

Radiolabelled virions in the supernatants were concentrated by ultracentrifugation as described above (Beckman
SW40 rotor, 30 krpm, 2 hr, 4°C). Concentrated virions
were then either directly solubilized in SDS-sample buffer
and analyzed by SDS-PAGE or the Triton X-100 containing lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoprecipation as

above. Radiolabelled 6K and TF proteins were quantified
using a Storm Phospho-Imager and ImageJ 1.40f software.

sites than 6K. In SFV, both 6K (6.6 kDa) and TF (8.3 kDa)
have five Cys residues.

Immunofluorescence
Cells transfected with SFV4 or TF- were grown on glass
coverslips and fixed with acetone or 4% paraformaldehyde 15 hr post-electroporation. Cells were blocked in 5%
mouse serum prior to incubation with rabbit polyclonal
anti-SFV Ab, Ab-6KTF-N or Ab-TF-C overnight at 4°C.
After washing, cells were then incubated with biotinylated
mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 2 hr followed by incubation with Streptavadin-FITC (DAKO). Cells on coverslips were then mounted in a DAPI containing mounting
medium (Vector Labs) and analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy.

In studies with SINV, ref. [7] showed that '4K' and '6K'
have the same N-term (using Abs to a 16 amino acid Nterm peptide and, in addition, by using radiolabelling of
Phe at amino acid 3 and Met at amino acid 7). They also
showed that both '4K' and '6K' have a Lys residue near the
C-term and in fact, in SINV, both 6K and TF do (Figure 5).
Additionally, with reference to excluded data, they
showed that both '4K' and '6K' lack any His residues (in
order to demonstrate that '6K' was not an extension into
E1, which contains an N-term proximal His). This, however, is in disagreement with our findings, since TF contains a His residue (Figure 5).

List of abbreviations

At such low molecular masses, migration can depend
strongly on the exact amino acid sequence and/or posttranslational modifications. Thus the masses '4K' and '6K'
may be unreliable. Indeed, in Figure 4A and 4C of ref. [7],
the molecular mass of '6K' appears closer to 10–12 kDa
on the marker scale, which may be more in keeping with
an (acylated) TF than 6K. In Figure 4C (lane 2) of ref. [7],
if the only difference between '6K' and '4K' is the degree of
acylation, then the deacylated '6K' and '4K' should
migrate together (as lane 1 of Figure 4B appears to show
that deacylation is complete), which they do not. If, however, the comparison is between acylated 6K and TF and
deacylated 6K and TF, then the migration patterns seen in
this figure make sense. A similar interpretation explains
the migration patterns seen in Figure 2 of ref. [16], in
which WT SINV (lane 1) is compared to a mutant virus
(lane 5) in which four of the Cys residues in 6K have been
replaced with other amino acids.

Appendix 1
In light of the results presented in this manuscript, it is
important to revisit and reinterpret many earlier results
regarding the 6K doublet. The fact that '6K' is present in
two forms was first demonstrated and investigated by
Gaedigk-Nitschko & Schlesinger [7]. The authors concluded that one form, which they labelled '4K', was a partially acylated form of the other, which they labelled '6K'.
We have proposed instead that '4K' equates to 6K and '6K'
is in fact TF, both of which may be acylated to varying
degrees. In the following, '6K' and '4K' refer to the labels
in ref. [7], while TF and 6K refer to the proteins as defined
in this paper. Note that, in SINV, 6K (6.2 kDa) has five Cys
residues while TF (8.0 kDa) has nine Cys residues, thus
providing TF with even more potential palmitoylation

Figure 4A of ref. [7], as well as Figure 2A and 2B of ref.
[15], show that only '6K' (i.e. TF) is in the virion. Table 1
of ref. [7] shows that ~2.5× as many '4K' as '6K' are present
in SINV-infected cells. This calculation is based on
[35S]Cys labelling and assumes that both '4K' and '6K'
contain 5 Cys residues. If in fact '6K' is TF, then it contains
9 Cys residues, so the inferred '6K' abundance must be
multiplied by 5/9. Hence we propose that there are in fact
4.5× as many '4K' as '6K' in SINV-infected cells, which
implies a frameshift efficiency of ~18% (in ref. [16], however, the '6K':'4K' ratio is given as 0.2, which translates to
a frameshift efficiency of ~10%). These figures are similar
to our own findings (10–17% with dual luciferase assay
for WT SINV and SFV inserts, and ~15% for [35S]Met/Cyslabelled SFV-infected cell lysate), and other literature,
where the more slowly migrating band of the 6K doublet
is always much fainter than the more quickly migrating
band [7,15,16,21]. In particular, in Figure 2 of ref. [16],
for a mutant virus (lane 5) in which four of the Cys residues in 6K have been replaced with other amino acids, the

bands for TF (5 remaining Cys) and 6K (1 remaining Cys)
assume similar intensities when labelled with [35S]Cys, as
expected for a frameshift efficiency of ~18%.

Mass spectrometry traces. LC/MS/MS data for selected tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of low molecular mass products isolated from purified SFV
virions. Data are presented for the following peptides: SLSFLSATEPR,
TFDSNAER, SLSFL, SLSFLV and SLSFF. A. Primary FTMS mass spectra. B. Output from MASCOT software showing MS/MS fragmentation
spectra and matched peptide sequences. Peptide assignments were based
on a combination of the following criteria: (i) The mass error should be
less than 3 ppm. (ii) A check of the primary FTMS data should confirm
that the charge state of the molecular ion determined by the THERMO
software is correct and consistent with the actual charge state of the ion
that was searched by MASCOT. (iii) The MS/MS data (i.e. peptide
sequence data) should be of good quality and show good signal-to-noise.
The MASCOT-assigned ions should be prominent and generally the main
ions accounted for in the MS/MS spectrum (not noise peaks). Mass errors
for the ions in the MS/MS data should mostly be within 0.3 Da. Assigned
ions in the MS/MS ion-trap data are frequently relatively minor peaks, but
they should still have a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio, such as 5:1. (iv)
The MASCOT score should usually be ≥ 20. However, the score for a given
peptide is proportional to the number of fragment ions observed and
assigned in the MS/MS data. Thus, for small peptides, such as SLSFL and
SLSFF, the MASCOT score may be less than 20, provided the quality of
the MS/MS data is still relatively good. (v) The 'expect' value should generally be ≤ 0.0001. However, once again, for small peptides expect values
≤ 0.01 may be acceptable, since the expect values also depend on peptide
length.

Figure 4A and Figure 3A of ref. [7] show that both '4K' and
'6K' are acylated. The relative intensities of the 6K and TF
bands when labelled with [3H]palmitic acid and when
labelled with [35S]Cys (lanes 1 and 2 of Figure 4A) indicate that TF is much more heavily palmitoylated than 6K.
Indeed the authors estimated that SINV '6K' carries 3–4
fatty acids (which may translate to 5–7 for TF) and that
'4K' (i.e. 6K) carries just one fatty acid. The difference in
the relative intensities of the [3H]palmitic acid-labelled 6K
and TF bands between SINV and SFV in Figure 3C (lanes
1 and 2) of ref. [7] is consistent with the TF:6K Cys ratio
being 9:5 in SINV but just 5:5 in SFV (i.e. SINV TF may be
more heavily palmitoylated than SFV TF). Similarly, the
fact that the SINV TF band migrates behind the SFV TF
band Figure 3C (lanes 1 and 2) of ref. [7], despite the
unmodified SINV TF peptide sequence having a slightly
lower molecular mass than the unmodified SFV TF peptide sequence, is consistent with SINV TF bearing more
fatty acids than SFV TF. Furthermore, Figure 4C (lane 2) of
ref. [7] shows that the molecular mass of TF is significantly
reduced upon deacylation with hydroxylamine, but any
change in the molecular mass of 6K upon deacylation
appears to be much less pronounced – again consistent
with 6K being much less palmitoylated than TF. Similar
effects are seen in Figure 2 of ref. [16] for the mutant virus
(lane 5) in which four of the Cys residues in 6K have been
replaced with other amino acids.

in acetone are permeabilized, allowing intracellular Ab staining. Cells
fixed in 4% PFA are not permeabilized, thus only allowing Abs to bind to
peptides at the cell surface. Cells are infected with WT SFV4 virus (WT),
the TF knockout mutant (TF-), or are non-infected controls. TF- also serves
as an additional control for Ab-TF-C.
