Abstract
Background: The neuropeptide somatostatin is one of the major regulatory peptides in the
central nervous system and the digestive tract. Our recent work has delineated an association
between fibrosis and low levels of endogenous somatostatin plasma levels in Schistosoma mansoni
infected subjects. Based on these results this paper explores the therapeutic potential of
somatostatin in a mouse model of hepatic fibrosis associated with S. mansoni infections.
Methods: Groups of outbred Swiss mice were infected with 100 S. mansoni cercariae, infection
maintained till weeks 10 or 14, and then somatostatin therapy delivered in two regimens – Either
a one or a two-day treatment. All animals were sacrificed one week after therapy and controlled
for liver, spleen and total body weight. Circulating somatostatin levels in mice plasma were
measured at the time of sacrifice by means of a radio-immuno assay. GraphPad Prism® was used
for statistical calculations.
Results: Somatostatin administration showed little toxicity, probably due to its short half-life.
Total liver and spleen weights of S. mansoni infected animals increased over time, with no changes
observed due to somatostatin therapy. Total body weights were decreased after infection but were
not affected by somatostatin therapy. Snap frozen liver sections were stained with haematoxylineosin or Masson's trichrome to study parasite count, hepatocyte status, granuloma size and
cellularity. After somatostatin treatment mean egg counts per liver section (43.76 ± 3.56) were
significantly reduced as compared to the egg counts in untreated mice after 10 weeks of infection
(56.01 ± 3.34) (P = 0.03). Similar significant reduction in parasite egg counts were also observed
after somatostatin treatment at 14 weeks of infection (56.62 ± 3.02) as compared to untreated
animals (69.82 ± 2.77)(P = 0.006). Fibrosis was assessed from the spectrophotometric
determination of tissue hydroxyproline. Infection with S. mansoni caused increased hydroxyproline
levels (9.37 ± 0.63 µmol at wk10; 9.65 ± 0.96 µmol at wk14) as compared to uninfected animals
(1.06 ± 0.10 µmol). This significant increase in collagen content (P = 0.01; 0.007 respectively) marks
the fibrosis observed at these time points. Treatment with somatostatin resulted in a significant
decrease in hydroxyproline levels both at wk10 (4.76 ± 0.58 µmol) and at wk14 (5.8 ± 1.13 µmol)
(P = 0.01; 0.03 respectively). Endogenous somatostatin levels were increased at wk10 (297 ± 37.24

pg/ml) and wk14 (206 ± 13.30 pg/ml) of infection as compared to uninfected mice (119 ± 11.99 pg/
ml) (P = 0.01; 0.008 respectively). Circulating somatostatin levels in infected animals were not
significantly affected by somatostatin treatment. Hepatocyte status remained unaltered and
granulomas were not remarkably changed in size or cellularity.
Conclusion: Our experiments reveal an antifibrotic effect of somatostatin in schistosomiasis. We
have previously shown that the somatostatin receptors SSTR2 and SSTR3 are present on the
parasite egg and worms. We therefore hypothesize that somatostatin reduces either the number
of parasite eggs or the secretion of fibrosis inducing-mediators. Our data suggest somatostatin may
have therapeutic potential in S. mansoni mediated liver pathology.

Background
Somatostatin (SOM) or somatostatin-14, a 14 amino acid
peptide hormone was originally isolated from the hypothalamus. It was soon after reported in the central nervous
system (CNS), the stomach, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and
pancreas. By 1980, the gene coding for prosomatostatin
had been identified and two molecular forms (SOM-14 &
SOM-28) were reported. As the five specific receptors for
somatostatin (SSTR1-SSTR5) belonging to the G proteincoupled receptor family were identified, it became clear
that the different molecular forms and various receptors
are part of a complicated control system that regulate a
variety of body functions. Somatostatin exerts profound
inhibitory functions not only on growth hormone secretion but also on many GI functions. These different
aspects form the basis for the therapeutic potential of
somatostatin in various diseases [1].
Somatostatin alone or in combination with endotherapy
has been successfully used in the management of bleeding
esophageal varices (BOV) [2]. Following an acute bleeding episode somatostatin is administered over a period of
5 days and acts by reducing the splanchnic blood flow.
Somatostatin is useful in reducing peptide ulcer bleeding
and the lack of recurrence [3]. More recently, somatostatin
has also shown proven benefits in the management of
pancreatic disorders, such as pancreatic fistulae, acute
pancreatitis and the prevention of complications following pancreatic surgery [4-6]. Somatostatin is well tolerated, with very few side effects.
Complications resulting from hepatic fibrosis are the
principal cause of death in Schistosoma mansoni infected
patients [7]. In such patients portal hypertension leads to
the formation of gastro-esophageal collaterals (varices).
Fatal bleeding of these esophageal varices can occur
depending on the severity of fibrosis. We have previously
shown an association between severe hepatic fibrosis and
low levels of endogenous somatostatin [1]. Taking these
reports into consideration, our present study was aimed to
test the therapeutic capacity of exogenously administered
somatostatin on S. mansoni caused liver pathology.

In schistosomiasis the principal inflammatory response is
directed against the parasite eggs some of which enter the
portal circulation, become lodged in hepatic portal
venules initiating a granulomatous response. During periovular granuloma formation fibronectin produced by
macrophages is deposited around the inflammatory cells
[8,9] composing a large part of the extracellular matrix.
This is followed by the deposition of the proteoglycans
dermatan sulphate, to a lesser extent heparan sulphate
[10], and the interstitial collagen types I & III that all
together form the fibrotic tissue.
Collagen is composed of three chains, wound together in
a tight triple helix (Fig. 1.). A repeated sequence of three
amino acids forms this sturdy structure. Every third amino
acid is glycine, a small amino acid that fits perfectly inside
the helix. Many of the remaining positions in the chain
are filled by two unexpected amino acids: proline and a
modified version of proline, hydroxyproline. The glycine
forms a tiny elbow packed inside the helix, and the proline and hydroxyproline smoothly bend the chain back
around the helix.
Our recent studies have elucidated the presence of somatostatin receptors (SSTR2A, mostly associated with
inflammatory cells, and receptor SSTR3 expressed in the
liver) on S. mansoni egg and worm stages (manuscript submitted). Soluble egg antigen (SEA) secreted by the egg
stage parasite in the liver triggers inflammation and fibrosis [11]. Circulating host somatostatin levels might inhibit
SEA production via interaction with the SSTR receptors on
the parasite surface, thereby regulating the level of liver
fibrosis and as a result portal hypertension, variceal bleeding and fatality due to this disease. In related studies the
group of Reynaert [12] have shown that the presence of
SSTRs 1, 2 and 3 on hepatic stellate cells could be used as
therapeutic targets for reducing fibrosis in chronic liver
disease because treatment with somatostatin decreased
collagen I and III and alpha-SMA synthesis.
Based on these reports we presented the hypothesis that
exogenous administration of somatostatin could alleviate
the pathology caused by schistosomiasis. To prove this we

EDTA (1 mg/ml) and Aprotinin (500 KIU/ml blood). The
collected blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 0°C. The plasma was immediately frozen at -80°C
freezer. Untreated naïve mice were also bled to ascertain
background levels of somatostatin.
Schistosoma mansoni infection
The maintenance of the S. mansoni life cycle and the transcutaneous infection of mice with S. mansoni have been
previously described [14]. Male Swiss mice (age 7 weeks)
were anaesthetized with Nembutal® (60 mg/kg) and the
abdomen was shaved. A metal ring was placed on the
abdomen and then filled with treated water containing
infectious cercariae of a Puerto Rican strain of S. mansoni.
The cercariae were allowed to penetrate during 20 minutes
after which the water was removed and checked for
remaining cercariae.
Experimental setup
Groups of Swiss mice were infected with 100 S. mansoni
cercariae each as mentioned above. Age matched mice
were maintained as uninfected control animals. Groups of
10 mice composed Group 1 that were maintained till 10
weeks following infection, other 10 mice composed
Group 2 that were maintained till 14 weeks of infection.

tested the effect of somatostatin treatment on collagen
deposition in the liver of Schistosoma mansoni infected
Swiss mice as compared to control uninfected or
untreated mice. We have on several occasions stressed the
therapeutic potential of somatostatin on S. mansoni
caused liver fibrosis [13]. Our results may indicate an
endogenous function of the somatostatin receptors on the
parasite surface and point to their role in host-parasite
interactions.

At such times animals of Groups 1 and 2 were treated with
somatostatin (Somatostatine-ucb®), that was kindly gifted
by UCB Pharma, Brussels. Somatostatin was administered
in two regimens – a one-day treatment or a two-day treatment. One day treatment consisted of 3 doses of 30 µg
somatostatin each, two day treatment was the double of
this dose, that is 6 doses of 30 µg somatostatin to each animal. Somatostatin was administered intravenously via the
caudal vein in the tail and intraperitoneally at regular
intervals during the day. One week after the last somatostatin administration, mice were killed, the weight of the
animal, liver and spleen were noted, plasma was extracted
and stored as mentioned above, and the liver frozen
immediately in liquid nitrogen and then at -80°C. The
overall planning is depicted in Table 1. Untreated animals
of the acute and chronic stage were also sacrificed at the
respective times together with their treated counterparts.
Research protocols involving rodents received ethical
clearance by the University of Antwerp ethical committee.

Methods
Pharmacokinetic profile of somatostatin
Separate groups of male Swiss mice were injected with 25
µg of somatostatin (somatostatin-ucb®, UCB Pharma,
Brussels) intraperitoneally (in the abdomen) or intravenously (in the caudal vein in the tail). At defined
moments after injection (10, 20, 40, 60 minutes) the animals were anaesthetized with Nembutal® (60 mg/kg). The
thoracic cavity was cut open and blood collected from the

worms were recovered from the hepatic portal system and
the liver by perfusion with citrate saline (0.85% sodium
chloride; 1.5% sodium citrate). The livers were cut out
and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. For cyosectioning,

liver fragments were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound, 4 µm thick transverse sections were cut on a cryostat, mounted on slides coated with 0.1% ploy-L-lysine
and stored at -20°C until use. To study parasite egg count,
hepatocyte status, granuloma size and cellularity, series of
sections were stained with Haematoxylin-eosin stain.
Hydroxyproline determination
The collagen concentration was determined by assessing
hydroxyproline amount. Herein is described the protocol

of Technique B for the biochemical assessment of fibrosis
used by Bergman and Loxley [15]. Just as was done by
Cheever [16] we neutralized our samples for the color

Hydrolysis of liver
For the measurement of the hydroxyproline content in the
liver, about 200 mg of liver was treated with 5 ml of 6N
HCl for 18 hours at 110°C. This acidic hydrolysis breaks
down the collagen to individual amino acids. Remaining

wise till the color changed to purple red. Return titration
was done with 5 µl drops of a 3N HCl solution, till all red
color was lost. The total volume was next restored to 4 ml
with distilled water and the solution kept stable at 4°C.
Color reaction
Starting from this step we used a series of standard
hydroxyproline concentrations made from 0-25-50-75100 µmol/l. (200 µl/test tube). From the test sample
above 200 µl was placed in a separate test tube. After vortexing 200 µl test sample/200 µl standard mixed together
with 400 µl of isopropanol, 200 µl of solution A (chloramine T/citrate-acetate buffer) was added that provided
an optimal binding between color and tissue. This reaction needed at least 4 minutes to work after which 2.5 ml
of solution B was added and the contents well mixed. The
tubes were covered with aluminum foil and incubated for
25 minutes in a warm water bath maintained at 60°C. To

stop the reaction the test tubes were cooled in cold water
for 3 minutes.
Measurement
Within 30 minutes, the absorbance for each sample was
measured in an Ultrospec 3000 UV/Visible Spectrofotometer at a wavelength of 558 nm.
Measurement of somatostatin levels in plasma
The measurement of somatostatin concentrations in the
Swiss mice plasma was carried out in the laboratory of
Gastro-intestinal Hormones, at Gasthuisberg, K.U. Leuven, by means of a radio-immuno assay (RIA). The RIA
was performed by incubating the samples with 1.7 pM 3[125I] iodotyrosyl11 somatostatin-14 (specific activity 2000

two days at 4°C. At the end of the incubation period the
SOM bound to the antibody was separated from the free
SOM by adding 500 µl dextran-charcoal followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 3000 rpm. Both fractions were
counted in a gamma counter and the results were read
from a standard curve (0–250 pg/ml) included in the RIA.
The minimal detectable dose was 2.5 pg/ml.

Results
Toxicity
Somatostatin is a highly purified compound reflected by
the fact that it has very little toxicity. Studies in mice have
shown that the LD50 is comparable to 10,000 times the
acute therapeutic dose used in humans. The favorable
metabolic profile of somatostatin is further supported by
the fact that this compound has a very short half-life, and
thus any undesirable effects may be rapidly reversed. In
our experiment we have used 90 µg/24 hours in the Swiss
mice that weighs about 40 g. In humans the therapeutic
dose is 3.5 µg/kg/hour or 6 mg/24 h for a 75 kg man. A
comparison of these values tells us that we are working

with about 100 times higher values in mice as compared
to that used in humans.
Pharmacokinetic profile of somatostatin in outbred mice
Following an intravenous infusion of a therapeutic dose
of somatostatin (250 µg/hour or 6 mg/24 hours) to
healthy volunteers, the plasma profile demonstrated that
the drug reaches a plateau of 300–3000 pg/ml within 15
minutes. Somatostatin has a very short half-life of 1–3
minutes in man. In animal studies the same profile has
been observed in dogs, whereas in rats somatostatin is
stable for up to 30 minutes in whole blood, indicating
that it is broken down in tissues [17]. To determine the
pharmacokinetic profile in outbred Swiss mice, 25 µg of
somatostatin was administered per mouse via the intraperitoneal or intravenous route. To assess the break down
in these mice, plasma was collected at regular time intervals and circulating somatostatin levels assayed (Figure 2).
At 10 minutes post injection somatostatin levels fall to
30233 pg/ml (IP) and 17413 pg/ml (IV). After intravenous injection thus somatostatin appears to be more

however after one hour of injection using either means
the levels of circulating somatostatin in blood reaches
baseline control levels. Thus in our experimental set up of
somatostatin treatment in S. mansoni infected mice the
schedule of 3 treatments per day (morning, noon and
evening), assured that for at least 3 hours per day there
were significantly high levels of circulating somatostatin
in vivo.

somatostatin treatment showed no significant change in
their liver weights (p = 0.19; 0.90 respectively).

Parasite egg count after somatostatin treatment,
hepatocyte, granuloma and fibrosis status
S. mansoni egg stage parasites were counted in liver sections before and after somatostatin treatment. A series of
10 slides were examined from each sub group, the sections obtained at intervals of at least 40 µm so as to avoid
counting repetitive eggs. Two days of somatostatin treatment in acute infected animals significantly reduced the
mean parasite egg counts form 56.01 ± 3.34 to 43.76 ±
3.56 (p = 0.03). At the chronic stage of infection, mean
egg counts were only significantly (p = 0.006) reduced
after 1 day of somatostatin treatment from69.82 ± 2.77 to
56.62 ± 3.02 (Fig. 6.).

Haematoxylin-eosin staining of liver sections displayed
the evolution of granuloma formation in infected animals
as compared to treated animals. After treatment with
somatostatin hepatocyte status remained unaltered,
granulomas were not remarkably changed in size or cellularity (results not shown).
Hydroxyproline determination
Hepatic fibrosis is the process of excessive deposition of
collagen in the liver. Collagen generation involves 3
polypeptide chains, each chain composed of 19 amino
acids consisting of glycine (30%), proline (12%) and two

bridges. Normal hydroxylated collagen is equivalent to
10% hydroxyproline in weight. Thus 1 µmol hydroxyproline (MW = 131.13) is equivalent to 1.3113 mg collagen.
Hydroxyproline concentrations in the livers (controls versus acute, chronic, treated and untreated) of the Swiss
mice are depicted in Table 2 and figure 7. The differences
in hydroxyproline concentrations between uninfected
and infected mice with or without treatment are
illustrated by non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U) or parametric (unpaired Student's t) test as shown in Table 2.
At 10 weeks post infection with 100 S. mansoni cercariae,
levels of hydroxyproline were significantly higher as
compared to that assayed in uninfected animals (p = 0.01)
(Fig. 7.). After treatment with somatostatin for 2 days,
circulating levels of this collagen at one-week post treatment time were significantly lower as compared to
infected animals that were not treated (p = 0.01).
Progression of the infection from week 10 to week 14 did
not result in a significant rise in hydroxyproline levels.
Treatment of chronically infected animals with a two-day
regimen of exogenous somatostatin resulted in a drop in
hydroxyproline levels at one-week post treatment. This
fall was significant (p = 0.03) as compared to chronic
untreated animals.
Somatostatin levels
Somatostatin concentrations in the plasma (controls versus acute, chronic, treated and untreated) of the Swiss
mice are depicted in Table 3 and figure 8. The differences

in somatostatin concentrations between uninfected and
infected mice with or without treatment were illustrated
by a non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U) test as shown in
Table 3. The distribution of somatostatin levels in all
groups is depicted in Figure 8. At 10 weeks post infection
with 100 S. mansoni cercariae, levels of circulating
somatostatin were significantly higher as compared to
that assayed in uninfected animals (p = 0.01). After treatment with somatostatin for 1 or 2 days, circulating levels
of this neuropeptide at one week post treatment time were
not significantly different as compared to infected animals
that were not treated.
Progression of the infection from acute (week 10) to
chronic (week 14) stages resulted in a drop in the somatostatin levels. Comparison of somatostatin levels between
these two time points depicted borderline significant differences (p = 0.06). Treatment of chronically but not of
acute infected animals with a two-day regimen of exogenous somatostatin resulted in an elevated level of
circulating hormone at one-week post treatment. This rise
in circulating somatostatin level was borderline significant (p = 0.06) as compared to chronic untreated animals.

Discussion and conclusions
The neuropeptide somatostatin is one of the major regulatory hormones in the central nervous system and the
digestive tract. Improved knowledge of the patho-physiological processes of schistosomiasis can be obtained by
studying the regulatory mechanisms of somatostatin in
the human body. The activity of somatostatin is mediated

via binding to specific cell surface receptors. To understand the expression, regulation, true role and distribution of these receptors, animal models come in helpful in
defining the physiological and pathological conditions set
up by schistosomiasis. Somatostatin, produced by neuroendocrine, inflammatory and immune cells inhibits
various cellular functions including secretions, motility,
and proliferation [18,13]. Preprosomatostatin (pp-SOM),
a precursor of somatostatin is synthesized in the pancreas,
the gastrointestinal network, and the brain. Two products
of this pp-SOM are somatostatin-14, a 14 amino acid peptide, and somatostatin-28 (SS-28) that contain the SS-14
but is prolonged at the N-terminus. Its action is mediated
by five specific somatostatin receptors (SSTR1 – SSTR5),
which belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family.
The last years we have been studying the potential of
somatostatin in modulating the pathology caused by
schistosomiasis, in particular hepatic fibrosis. The trematode, Schistosoma mansoni is phylogenetically the oldest
class of invertebrate in which we have identified
immunopositivity to the somatostatin receptors SSTR2
and SSTR3 (manuscript submitted). The presence of these
receptors on the parasite stages indicate that circulating
somatostatin levels might interact with the pathogenic
parasitic stages and hence influence hepatic fibrosis
caused by this parasite.
The helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni and its related
species cause the fibrotic hepatic disease, schistosomiasis.
Fibrosis is the process of excessive deposition of collagen

in a tissue together with other extracellular matrix (ECM)
components like fibronectin, proteoglycans, laminin and
elastin. To some extent ECM deposition is necessary for
wound healing since it provides strength and temporary
structure to damaged tissues. However, if not limited this
process is pathogenic. Liver fibrosis can be particularly
detrimental leading to portal hypertension and its
attendant sequelae that include splenomegaly and rupture-prone gastroesophageal varices.
The collagen peptide-synthesis in the liver of infected
mice attains a peak activity at 8 weeks post infection. The
triple polypeptide chains, assembled to form procollagen,
once leaving the cell come together to form polymeric
collagen fibers. The hydroxyproline residues take care of
the stability of the three dimensional helix via the
formation of hydroxyl bridges between the polypeptide
chains. The important points in collagen biosynthesis are
thus the positioning of the hydroxylproline residues in
the triple backbone structure, the knipping off of the
propeptides from procollagen to form collagen as it leaves
the cell and finally the cross-linking to form fibers. The
deposition of fibronectin and heparansulphate round the
egg rises rapidly till week 11 post infection after which levels plateau off. All these extracellular matrix components
interact with different cells and modulate various cellular
activities like migration, proliferation, differentiation,
chemotaxis etc. [19].

biological processes in the body, might add another feature to its ubiquitous nature – that of reducing fibrosis in
Schistosoma mansoni infections.
We have quantified fibrosis (amount of collagen) generated by S. mansoni infections and the reductions after
somatostatin treatments by measuring the levels of
hydroxyproline at each time point.
In acute and chronic infected animals that were untreated,
the increased collagen levels were associated with
increased somatostatin levels respectively. Two days
treatment of acute and chronic infected animals with
somatostatin significantly reduced hydroxyproline levels.

Endogenous somatostatin levels were not affected during
the acute phase after somatostatin treatment although in
chronic infected mice endogenous somatostatin levels
tended to increase. However, at both time points, a
significant reduction in parasite egg counts was observed,
suggesting that therapeutic doses of somatostatin might,
by binding to somatostatin receptors on the parasite surface, inhibit the production of the parasite stage that
induces the inflammatory granulomatous response that
can lead to fibrosis.
Reports by Reynaert et al. [12] have identified the somatostatin receptors SSTR1, 2 and 3 on the hepatic stellate cells
that are responsible for collagen synthesis. In our

experiments exogenous somatostatin might also have
bound to these receptors thereby inhibiting collagen
synthesis.
Taken together we have elucidated the therapeutic capacity of somatostatin in reducing hepatic fibrosis. This
report in fact confirms a previous report by Mansy [20],
where using a somatostatin synthetic analog octreotide in
S. mansoni infected animals, a reduction in hepatic fibrosis was noted. Since octreotide is limited in binding to
somatostatin receptors, our results with natural somatostatin that binds to all 5 somatostatin receptors equally
well assures us of the anti fibrotic capacities of this neuropeptide hormone, and points to its potential use in
human conditions.
