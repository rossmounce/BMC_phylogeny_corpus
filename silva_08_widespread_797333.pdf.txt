Abstract
Background: Cotton blue disease (CBD), an important global cotton crop pathology responsible
for major economic losses, is prevalent in the major cotton-producing states of Brazil. Typical CBD
symptoms include stunting due to internodal shortening, leaf rolling, intense green foliage, and
yellowing veins. Atypical CBD symptoms, including reddish and withered leaves, were also
observed in Brazilian cotton fields in 2007. Recently, a Polerovirus named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus
(CLRDV) was shown to be associated with CBD.
Results: To understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed 23
CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties originating from five of the six most
important cotton-growing states, from 2004–2007. Here, we report on CLRDV diversity in plants
with typical or atypical CBD symptoms by comparing viral coat protein, RNA polymerase (RdRp),
and intergenic region genomic sequences.
Conclusion: The virus had a widespread distribution with a low genetic diversity; however, three
divergent isolates were associated with atypical CBD symptoms. These divergent isolates had a
CLRDV-related coat protein but a distinct RdRp sequence, and probably arose from recombination
events. Based on the taxonomic rules for the family Luteoviridae, we propose that these three
isolates represent isolates of a new species in the genus Polerovirus.

Background
Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is one of the most economically
important crops in the world. Among its biotic pathologies, cotton blue disease (CBD) plays an important role
due to its worldwide distribution and the high-magnitude
of its associated productivity losses. Cotton blue disease
was first described in the Central African Republic in
1949. It is transmitted by the aphid Aphis gossypii and its

symptoms include leaf rolling, intense green foliage, vein
yellowing, and a severe to moderate stunting caused by
internodal shortening. Similar symptoms have also been
observed in cotton crops of several regions of Africa, Asia
and the Americas [1]. In Brazil, CBD is a serious crop
problem capable of reducing the productivity of susceptible varieties by up to 80%, if intensive insecticidal control
is not properly performed during the growing season.

Losses of up to 1,500 kg·ha-1 of cotton seed have been
reported in some states [2].
The viral origin of CBD was only recently identified [3]. In
Brazil, the disease is associated with a virus from the family Luteoviridae, genus Polerovirus, named Cotton leafroll
dwarf virus (CLRDV) [3]. Viruses from the family Luteoviridae are icosahedral and have a positive-sense RNA
genome of ~6 Kb. These viruses are transmitted by aphids
in a circulative and persistent manner [4], and are
restricted to the phloem cells of their hosts. The Luteoviridae family is comprised of three genera, Luteovirus, Polerovirus, and Enamovirus, that are divided based on
differences in their RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase
(RdRp) and structural proteins.
Polerovirus genomes consist of six open reading frames
(ORFs), typically designated ORFs 0 to 6 [5]. Non-structural genes are located in the 5' portion of the genome.
ORF0 encodes a silencing suppressor protein, P0 [6], and
ORFs1 and 2 encode proteins related to viral replication,
including the viral RNA polymerase [5]. Between the nonstructural and structural protein sequences exists an intergenic region (IR) involved in subgenomic RNA synthesis
[5,7,8]. The major coat protein (CP) is encoded by ORF3
at the 3' portion of the genome. The viral movement protein is encoded by ORF4, which lies within the CP gene
sequence but in another reading frame [9]. ORF5 is
expressed by occasional suppression of the CP termination codon [10] and encodes the read-through domain
(RTD) required for efficient aphid transmission [11,12]
The genetic variability of plant viral populations is an
important aspect of their evolution and epidemiology
[13]. Variation among isolates may affect virulence, infectivity, transmission, and symptom severity, and therefore
is important to consider when developing strategies for
disease control [14]. To better understand the distribution
and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed
CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties obtained from five of the six most important cottongrowing states of the country. This work represents the
first time that isolates of CBD-associated viruses have
been analyzed at the molecular level.

RNA extraction and amplification
The total RNA was extracted from leaf samples using the
RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) in combination with a
borate extraction buffer, following a previously described
procedure [15]. Approximately 2.5 μg of total RNA from
each isolate were used to synthesize first-strand cDNA
using the CLRDV-specific primer O5R2 (5'-GCAACCTTTTATAGTCTCTCCAAT-3'), which anneals in the middle of
CLRDV ORF5. Two independent nested PCRs were carried
out for each viral isolate, one to amplify the CP gene and
the other to amplify part of the RdRp gene plus the complete IR.

To amplify the CP gene, an initial reaction with the primers PL2F [3] and O5R2 was performed. The obtained
amplicon was used as a template for a second amplification with the nested primers CPF and CPR [3], generating
a 650-nt fragment. To amplify the partial RdRp sequence
plus the IR, the previously described degenerated primers
PLF and PLR [3] were used in the first reaction. Following
this, the internal primers PL2F and PL2R [3] were used in
the second reaction, generating a 468-nt fragment. Reactions were carried out with a denaturation step of 5 min at
95°C followed by 40 cycles (for the pairs PLF, PLR and
PL2F, PL2R) or 35 cycles (for the primers PL2F, O5R2 and
CPF, CPR) at 95°C for 1 min, 52°C (for PL2F, O5R2),
65°C (for CPF, CPR and PLF, PLR), or 50°C (for PL2F,
PL2R) for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. To amplify the full-length
fragment corresponding to the partial RdRp, IR, and CP
regions in a single PCR product, PL2F and CPR were used
with an annealing temperature of 52°C for 40 cycles. RTPCR products were purified using the Wizard® SV Gel and
PCR Clean-UP System (Promega) following the instructions provided.
Sequencing and sequence analysis
Three amplicons of each viral fragment, derived from
independent RT-PCR reactions, were purified and then
directly sequenced in both directions in automated ABI
sequencers (models 310 or 377) using dye terminator
cycle sequencing for all isolates. The resulting sequences
were compared with the GenBank database. Consensus
sequences of the CP, partial RdRp, and IR were obtained
through the Multalin program [16].

Materials and methods
Plant material
Twenty one cotton plants belonging to five susceptible
cultivars of Gossypium hirsutum and two plants of G. barbadense were collected from cotton fields in the states of
Mato Grosso, Goiás, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Paraná, and
Federal District from 2004 to 2007 (Table 1 and Figure 1).

Multiple sequence alignments of nucleotide or deduced
amino acid sequences were submitted to the GeneDoc
program http://www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc for computational analysis of the identities between the
sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed
using the MEGA 4 software [17]. Trees were constructed
by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [18]. The pair-wise
deletion option, excluding gaps from the sequence alignment, and p-distance matrix were adopted. Data sets were

sion 2.0 (RDP2) [21]. To further analyze recombination
events, sequences obtained from individual PCRs were
concatenated in silico and used in the above-described
software. For Simplot analysis, the two previously
described sequences of CLRDV (AY758560 and
AY758561) were used as queries against the reference
sequences of the isolates PL3, CV2, and PO1 and a cluster
of sequences composed of all other sampled CLRDV isolates. The identities were calculated in a sliding window of
120 bp, which was moved across the alignment in 10 bp
steps. The parameters used in the GARD program for
checking alignments of CLRDV and the divergent isolates
were the multiple break points options and general discrete rate variation. A manual bootscan was implemented
by RDP3 Beta 24, with window and step size parameters
of 100 and 10 bp, respectively. A 70% bootstrap support
was considered to be definitive.

Results
To analyze the ubiquity and diversity of CBD in Brazil,
cotton plants showing typical symptoms were harvested
from commercial and experimental fields in four of the six
major cotton-producing states of Brazil, Mato Grosso
(MT), Goiás (GO), São Paulo (SP), Paraná (PR), and at
Federal District (DF), between 2004 and 2007 (Figure 1).
Three plants with atypical CBD symptoms were also harvested in the states of Minas Gerais (MG) and MT. Plants

with atypical symptoms had all of the typical CBD symptoms along with withered and reddish middle and basal
leaves.
Using nested RT-PCR, we tested for the presence of
CLRDV-related sequences in all 23 sampled plants. The
CP sequence, part of RdRp, and the full IR were amplified
in all the isolates tested (Table 1). All amplicons showed
the expected size for CLRDV and were sequenced. At least
three independent PCR reactions for each fragment from
each sample were sequenced. The obtained sequences
were aligned and a consensus nucleotide sequence for
each isolate was made for the three viral fragments.
The CP sequences of all isolates were similar to the CP
sequence from CLRDV deposited in the GenBank database (accession number AY758560). In addition, most of
the RdRp sequences analyzed were also closely related to
that of the previously reported isolate (accession number
AY758561). However, three isolates (designated PL3,
CV2, and PO1) showed best hit results with TVDV, an
unclassified member of the family Luteoviridae, but not
with CLRDV. This suggests that these three isolates may
have resulted from recombination events. Interestingly,
these three divergent viruses were found in plants with
atypical CBD symptoms.

When we compared CP sequence identities from all the
isolates, we observed a high degree of nucleotide identity
(97–100%). However, when the partial RdRp sequences
were analyzed, the sequence identities were lower (65–
100%). Most of this diversity resulted from a high
sequence divergence in the three isolates found in plants
with atypical CBD symptoms. Isolates PL3, CV2, and PO1
shared identities of 68%, 68%, and 67%, respectively,
with the original CLRDV RdRp sequence. The identities
among PL3, CV2, and PO1, however, ranged from 93% to
95%. Excluding the divergent isolates from the analysis,
identities ranging from 95 to 100% for the RdRp sequence
were observed among the 20 newly-identified CLRDV isolates. Similar results were also obtained for the IR, where
the identities ranged from 94% to 100% among the 20
CLRDV isolates. The three divergent isolates shared identities of 66% with the original CLRDV IR sequence.

plants harvested in Cascavel, PR and in DF during the
2004 and 2005 harvests, and in those obtained from Primavera do Leste, MT in 2007 (Figure 2A).

Phylogenetic relationships among isolates
Phylogenetic relationships among the CLRDV isolates
were determined using the NJ method. Since dendograms
constructed from nucleotide or amino acid sequences produced similar results, only those derived from nucleotide
sequences are shown (Figure 2). In general, CLRDV displayed a widespread distribution in Brazil. Two groups of
CP phylogeny were found: a small cluster formed by isolates CV2 and PO1 (bootstrap of 96%) and a large cluster
containing almost all of the other sampled isolates (bootstrap of 86%). PL3 appeared to be the most divergent isolate, since its CP sequence was not grouped with the
others. Within the major cluster were clusters of viruses
from the same locality. This was particularly observed in

The three divergent isolates were clearly separated from
the other 20 CLDRV isolates found. Although these three
isolates were very close to the other isolates, the CP phylogenetic tree placed them in an independent cluster. Significant differences were found between RdRp sequences
from the divergent isolates and those from viruses associated with typical CBD symptoms, suggesting the possibility of recombination events between the viral populations
in the field.

The trees constructed from partial RdRp (Figure 2B) and
IR (data not shown) sequences were congruent and
revealed a clear segregation of the isolates into two monophyletic clusters. This dichotomy was supported by 100%
bootstraps in trees constructed either on nucleotide- or
amino acid-based alignments (data not shown). The first
cluster contained the three divergent isolates, PL3, CV2,
and PO1, while the second was comprised of all the
remaining isolates. Again, there were clusters of isolates
obtained from the same geographical region in the same
harvest. The isolates from Cascavel that were harvested in
2005 grouped together, as did those from DF (2005) and
Primavera do Leste (2007) (Figure 2B).

Characterization of the divergent isolates
To characterize the divergent isolates, we first checked
whether the sequences of two different viruses were misamplified in a co-infection context. Using a primer com-

bination capable of amplifying a fragment comprised of
the 3' end of RdRp plus the IR and CP sequences, we
obtained a single PCR product with the expected size for
each divergent isolate (PL3, CV2, and PO1) (Figure 3A).
The amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced, and
the new sequences confirmed that each isolate corresponded to the amplification of a single viral genome.
The sequences obtained were aligned with the sequences
of CLRDV and nine other randomly chosen isolates. All
the viruses had almost identical CP sequences. Similarities
were also observed in the 3' end of the IR. However, the 5'
end of the IR and the 3' portion of the RdRp sequence
showed consistent differences (Figure 3B).
To better understand the taxonomic and evolutionary
positions of isolates PL3, CV2, and PO1 within the family
Luteoviridae, sequences of the three viruses were compared
to well-characterized Luteoviridae members. When the
deduced amino acid sequence of the CP gene was analyzed, identities of 97%, 79%, 78%, and 77% were
observed with CLRDV, TYV, BMYV, BChV, and BWYV,
respectively. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the three
divergent isolates with CLRDV in the Polerovirus branch of
the tree, together with other definitive members of this
group (Figure 4A).
The partial RdRp sequence analyzed in this work encodes
the 92 C-terminal residues of the viral protein. Although
the RdRp sequences of the three recombinant isolates
shared an almost 70% sequence identity with CLRDV, significant identities were also found with Polerovirus members, including TYV (68%) and BMYV (66%), and with
TVDV (66%), an unclassified Luteoviridae that has a Polerovirus-like RdRp. Identities with other known Luteoviridae
viruses indicated that PL3, CV2, and PO1 are more related
to members of the genus Polerovirus than to those of Luteovirus (data not shown). Phylogeny obtained from the
partial RdRp amino acid alignment confirmed this result
by grouping the three isolates with CLRDV in the Polerovirus branch (Figure 4B).
Together, the above results indicate that PL3, CV2, and
PO1 should be regarded as definitive members of the family Luteoviridae, genus Polerovirus. Considering the high
degree of sequence divergence in the RdRp region, these
three isolates may also represent isolates of a new species
in Luteoviridae and of a second CBD-associated virus in
Brazil.
Recombination analysis
To identify recombination events that could explain the
emergence of the PL3, CV2, and PO1 isolates, the RdRp,
IR, and CP sequences from each of the 23 isolates were
analyzed using Simplot. For the 20 CLRDV isolates, the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/123

analyses were carried out by in silico concatenation of the
individual sequences obtained by PCR. Similar to the
above results, a comparison of the RdRp sequences
revealed that these three isolates had low sequence similarities to CLRDV and to the other 20 isolates (Figure 5).
However, a pronounced increase in the similarities
between PL3, CV2, and PO1 and the other CLRDV isolates
was observed from the middle of the IR to the end of the
CP sequence (Figure 5).
The hypothesis that the divergent isolates resulted from
recombination events was reinforced by results obtained
using GARD. A discordant phylogenetic signal in the
alignment of PL3, CV2, PO1, the 20 other concatenated
CLRDV isolates, and TYV nucleotide sequences indicated
a clear breaking point at nucleotide (nt) 443 (Figure 6A).
The proposed breakpoint-delimited phylogenetic tree
revealed that the cluster formed by PL3, CV2, and PO1
was more divergent to CLRDV isolates than to those of the
TYV out-group, when the 5' portion of the alignment was
considered (Figure 6B). However, for a segment downstream of the breakpoint, the phylogeny showed a grouping of the clusters formed by the divergent and CLRDV
isolates.
Nucleotide 443 is located within the IR, a well-known site
of both intra- and inter-species recombination in the family Luteoviridae. To identify possible parental lines for the
divergent isolates, a bootscan analysis was performed.
Luteoviridae sequences corresponding to the partial RdRp,
IR, and capsid gene were used to scan for homologue segments in PL3, CV2, and PO1. For the RdRp and IR
sequences of PO1, the bootstrap values were low until ~nt
435 and did not support their clustering with CLRDV (Figure 7). However, no significant bootstrap values were
reached to support the clustering of the divergent
sequences with any other luteovirus. For CP and nearby
sequences, the bootstrap values supported the grouping of
the divergent isolates with CLRDV (Figure 7), as expected.
Similar plots were obtained for isolates CV2 and PL3 (data
not shown).

Discussion
Analyzing CLRDV distribution in cotton Brazilian fields
we were able to shown that it has a widespread distribution and high sequence conservation. These conclusions
arise from nucleotide sequence comparing part of the
polymerase, the coat protein and the intergenic region of
23 new isolates and CLRDV isolate identified in 2005 in
Primavera do Leste. Interestingly, we also found that three
of them have enough divergence in their polymerase
sequences to be considered as a new species.

throughout the world; however, due to the recent charac-

Simplot analysis of the three divergent isolates (PO1, PL3, and CV2) and CLRDV isolates. Full-length sequences,
comprising the partial RdRp, IR, and CP regions, were analyzed. The horizontal axis represents the nucleotide distance of the
midpoint of the window from the 5' end of the query sequence (1074 nt in CLRDV). The vertical axis represents the percentage of similarity (within a window covering 120 bp). The window was moved through the alignment with a step length of 10 bp.

terization of its causal agent at the molecular level, its viral
population and/or isolate diversity have not previously
been reported. We previously described a virus associated
with CBD in Brazil [3]. This virus, CLRDV, was present in
CBD-symptomatic plants from a crop field in Primavera
do Leste, MT. Here we map for the first time the genetic
diversity of CLRDV in Brazilian cotton fields covering the
most important producer regions. Analyzing 23 new viral
isolates, we observed a low diversity in the CP CLRDV
gene. However, phylogenetic analysis of this sequence
revealed a small genetic distance between CV2, PO1, and
PL3 and the other CLRDV isolates, clustering them in different groups. These results may suggest a co-adaptation
phenomenon, resulting from selection pressure, among

the divergent and the other CLRDV isolates, giving rise
very similar CP sequences. Indeed, evolutionary studies
concerning the CP of Luteoviridae members show that this
protein is subjected to various selection pressures [22].
The CP is directly associated with the success of infection,
as it is involved in viral transmission, particle packaging,
and viral accumulation within the plant [23,24]. Thus, a
high degree of conservation in the CP protein sequence is
expected.
Luteoviridae members have varying degrees of sequence
conservation along their RNA genome. A model has been
proposed where the CP and RTD sequences are the most
conserved, while the IR is the least. Accordingly, our

results showed that the partial RdRp CLRDV gene displayed a greater diversity than CLRDV CP. Our analysis of
the IR, however, contradicted this model, and showed a
low diversity in this region comparable to that of the
RdRp sequence. The IR is a noncoding sequence, and
should be more prone to sequence variation than other
parts of the genome. However, its role as a promoter in the

generation of the subgenomic RNAs could result in
sequence conservation due to structural constraints [7,8].
Interestingly, the isolates amplified from plants displaying typical CBD symptoms were very similar with one
another, but those associated with atypical symptoms
(PL3, CV2, and PO1) displayed highly divergent RdRp

sequences compared to the previously published CLRDV
sequence. A phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp
region revealed a clear segregation between PL3, CV2, and
PO1 and the other CLRDV isolates identified in this study,
forming two monophyletic clusters. This segregation was
partially observed in the phylogeny of the CP gene,
although the dendograms for this sequence revealed a
stronger relationship among the divergents and the other
CLRDV isolates.

members, which are ~100 nt long. Taken together, these
data suggest that the three divergent isolates could result
from recombination events between CLRDV ancestors
and another member of the genus Polerovirus. Evidence of
recombination was found using three different methods
(Simplot, GARD, and Bootscan). However, we were unable to detect a parental sequence for PL3, CV2, or PO1.
Thus, the Polerovirus member involved in recombination
with CLRDV remains unknown.

Taxonomic characterization of the divergent isolates using
phylogenetic analyses indicated that PL3, CV2, and PO1
have a Polerovirus-like RdRp and a CLRDV-like CP. Moreover, the IR between the RdRp and CP sequences from
divergent isolates have 187 nt, the same as that in CLRDV
[3]. Thus, their IRs resemble those of Polerovirus members,
which are ~200 nt long, and differ from those of Luteovirus

Recombination events may play an important role in generating genome diversity. Inter-species recombination has
frequently occurred in the evolution of Luteoviridae. RNA
recombination event(s) probably created the divergence
observed between the genera Luteovirus and Polerovirus
[25]. Subsequent recombination events between polerovirus-polerovirus [26] and luteovirus-polerovirus [27,28]

have occurred since the birth of these genera [5,25].
Recombination sites in the family appear to coincide with
the starting points for subgenomic RNA synthesis in the IR
[7]. Comparisons among the IR sequences of BWYV,
PLRV, and BYDV RNAs revealed two spots that are apparently conserved in all viruses. These regions contain a
repeated UnA signature that is usually associated with the
formation of subgenomic RNAs [7,8]. Our data suggest
that the recombination event found in the three divergent
isolates occurred downstream of the second recombination spot of the IR (Figure 3B). Consistent with this, crossover events at the same region have already been
described for a bovine coronavirus [29].

References
Amino acid sequence comparisons between the three
recombinant viruses isolated from plants with atypical
CBD symptoms and the 20 analyzed CLRDV isolates
revealed that they share identities of ~70% in the partial
RdRp sequence and of ~97% in the CP region. The molecular criterion used for species discrimination [30] in the
family Luteoviridae states that amino acid sequences from
any viral gene product exceeding 10% divergence should
be regarded as a new species. Furthermore, symptomatology differences are also an important criterion for species
discrimination. Therefore, our results suggest that PL3,
CV2, and PO1 should be considered isolates of a new species in the genus Polerovirus. Further studies on CBD are
necessary to understand the taxonomic and epidemiological relationships between the viruses associated with this
important disease.

Conclusion
Our data suggests a CLRDV low genetic diversity and
widespread distribution in Brazilian states. Between the
23 samples analyzed, however, we identified three divergent isolates associated with atypical CBD symptoms. The
analyses revealed that these isolates have a CLRDV-related
coat protein but distinct RdRp sequences and probably
arose from recombination events between CLRDV and an
unidentified luteovirus. In agreement with molecular taxonomic criterions for the Luteoviridae, we can consider
that these isolates represent a new specie in the genus
Polerovirus.
