Abstract
Background: Betanodaviruses, members of the family Nodaviridae, have bipartite, positive-sense RNA genomes and
are the causal agents of viral nervous necrosis in many marine fish species. Recently, the viruses were shown to infect a
few freshwater fish species including a model fish medaka (Oryzias latipes). Although virological study using cultured
medaka cells would provide a lot of insight into virus-fish interactions in molecular aspects, no such cells have yet been
tested for virus susceptibility.
Results: We tested ten medaka cell lines for susceptibilities to redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV).
Although the viral coat protein was detected in all the cell lines inoculated, the levels of cytopathic effect development
and viral propagation were quite different among the cell lines. Those levels were especially high in OLHNI-1 and
OLHNI-2 cells, but were extremely low in OLME-104 cells. Some cell lines entered into antiviral state after RGNNV
infections probably because of inducing an antiviral system. This is the first report to examine the susceptibilities of
cultured medaka cells against a virus.
Conclusion: OLHNI-1 and OLHNI-2 cells are candidates of new standard cells for betanodavirus study because of their
high susceptibilities to the virus and their several advantages as model fish cells.
Background
Betanodaviruses, members of the family Nodaviridae, are
small non-enveloped viruses with a genome composed of
a bipartite single-stranded, positive-sense RNA [1,2]. The
larger genomic segment, RNA1 (3.1 kb), encodes the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the smaller
genomic segment, RNA2 (1.4 kb), encodes the coat protein (CP) [2]. During viral RNA replication, a subgenomic
RNA3 is produced, which encodes the RNA interference
inhibitor protein B2 [3-5]. Betanodaviruses are classified
basically into four genotypes based on the phylogenetic
analysis of their genomic RNA2 sequences [6-8]. These
genotypes are striped jack nervous necrosis virus
(SJNNV), barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus
(BFNNV), tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV)
and redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus
(RGNNV). Recently, a betanodavirus isolate from turbot
(Scophthalmus maximus) was suggested to belong to a
fifth genotype [9].

Betanodaviruses are the causative agents of a highly
destructive disease of marine fish designated viral nervous necrosis. The viruses have been isolated from a large
number of marine fish species [10,11]. Betanodaviruses
propagate in various established cell lines derived from
not only fish [2,12] but also mammals [13]. Recently, it
was revealed that larvae of freshwater fish guppy (Poicelia
reticulata) [14] and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) [15]
were affected naturally by RGNNV. Some freshwater fish
including medaka (Oryzias latipes) [16,17] and zebrafish
(Danio rerio) [18] are lethally susceptible to betanodaviruses under experimental conditions. Medaka has several
experimental advantages as a model fish compared to
other fish and higher vertebrates. For example, medaka is
small, cost-effective, easy to breed in large numbers, and
has a short life cycle. Furthermore, whole medaka
genomic sequences are available and many experimental
techniques for gene function analysis can be applied to
medaka [19,20]. However, one obstacle to study betanodavirus-medaka interactions in molecular aspects is the
lack of cultured medaka cells which are susceptible to a
betanodavirus. Therefore, in this study, we examined the

susceptibilities of ten medaka cell lines derived from different strains and organs to RGNNV.

Results
Virus infection and cytopathic effect (CPE) development

We firstly examined the infectivity of RGNNV against the
medaka cell lines (Table 1) by detecting CP-expressing
cells at 1 day post-inoculation (dpi). When the cells were
inoculated with RGNNV having the 50% tissue culture
infectious dose (TCID50) of 106, most of the inoculated
cells expressed the CP in OLHNI-1, OLHNI-2, and OLKaga-e1 cells (Figure 1). In contrast, quite a small number
of cells expressed the CP in OLF-136 and OLME-104
cells (Figure 1). The typical CPE, represented as rounded
cells which were finally detached from the dish, was
detected only in OLHNI-1 and OLHNI-2 cells at 1 dpi of
105 or 106 TCID50 of RGNNV (data not shown). To examine further whether the eight cell lines other than
OLHNI-1 and OLHNI-2 cells exhibit CPE by RGNNVinoculations, inoculated cells were incubated for up to 7
days and observed under a microscope (Figure 2).
OLHNI-2 cells showed the apparent CPE at 2 dpi when
the cells were exposed to 103 TCID50 of RGNNV and
almost detached from the dish at 3 dpi (Figure 2).
OLHNI-1, OLHE-131, OLKaga-e1, and OLHdrR-e3 cells
also showed apparent CPE in 4-5 days after inoculated
with 103 TCID50 of virus (data not shown). In contrast, no
apparent CPE was observed in OLCAB-e31, OLME-104,
OLCAB-e21, or OLF-136 cells (Figure 2, data not shown
for the latter two) within 7 days even though the cells
were exposed to 106 TCID50 of virus. These results indicate that OLHNI-1 and OLHNI-2 cells are highly susceptible to RGNNV compared with the other cell lines.
Furthermore, RGNNV production and/or spread seem to
be restricted in some of the medaka cell lines though the

virus can multiply in all of the cell lines to a varying
degree.
Virus spread

To examine whether RGNNV spread occur in the
medaka cell lines which lacked clear appearance of CPE
(Figure 2), we examined CP-expressing cells in those cell
lines inoculated with RGNNV. In OLCAB-e21 and
OLCAB-e31 cells, the numbers of CP-expressing cells
were decreased dramatically with time (Figure 3) compared with those at 1 dpi (Figure 1). In OLF-136 cells, the
number of CP-expressing cells was increased transiently
at 3 dpi (Figure 3) compared to that at 1 dpi (Figure 1) but
then decreased gradually. No virus spread was observed
in OLME-104 cells throughout the experimental period
(Figures 1 and 3). These results indicate that the viral
spread was tightly limited in the four cell lines, which
resulted in the defect of apparent CPE development as
shown in Figure 2.

Production of progeny virus

In DBT cells which are derived from murine astrocytoma, RGNNV propagated efficiently without substantial
increases in the number of virus-infected cells and CPEexhibiting cells [13]. These data suggest that a great
amount of RGNNV production is not necessarily concerned with the number of virus-infected cells and
appearance of CPE. To quantify progeny virus from inoculated medaka cells, we calculated the viral titers in the
culture supernatant by the TCID50 method (Table 2). The
viral titers of the culture supernatant from infected
OLHNI-1 and OLHNI-2 cells increased sequentially and
reached more than 109 TCID50/ml at 5 dpi. Similarly, the
maximum viral titers were approximately: 108 TCID50/ml
in OLHE-131, OLKaga-e1, and OLHdrR-e3 cells; 107
TCID50/ml in OLCAB-e3, OLCAB-e31, and OLF-136
cells; 106 TCID50/ml in OLCAB-e21 cells. The viral titers
of the supernatant from inoculated OLME-104 cells did

not increase during the whole experimental period, suggesting that RGNNV was unable to propagate in this cell.
Interestingly, in E-11 cells, the maximum viral titer was
108.1 TCID50/ml, which was approximately 10-fold lower
than those of OLHNI-1 and OLHNI-2 cells. These results
indicated that RGNNV multiplies in various medaka cell
lines, especially in OLHNI-1 and OLHNI-2 cells, but
hardly in OLME-104 cells. Furthermore, OLHNI-1 and
OLHNI-2 cells are candidates of new standard cells for
betanodavirus study because of their high susceptibilities
to the virus and their several advantages as model fish
cells.

Discussion
We have demonstrated the susceptibilities of established
medaka cells to the betanodavirus (RGNNV), the levels
of which varied irrespective of the originated tissues.
Medaka cell lines could be classified into three categories
in terms of the infectivity and/or the productivity of
RGNNV in the cells as follows: (1) cells are efficiently
infected by virus, and give CPE and a high titer of progeny virus as is the cases for OLHNI-1, OLHNI-2, OLHE131, OLKaga-e1, and OLHdrR-e3 cells, (2) cells are
infected by virus though CPE and viral spread are tightly
limited, which resulted in production of a low amount of
progeny virus as is the cases for OLCAB-e3, OLCAB-e21,
OLCAB-e31 and OLF-136 cells, (3) cells are hardly
infected by virus as is the cases for OLME-104 cells.
There would be two possible processes which determined

the levels of the susceptibilities to RGNNV. One is the
presence or absence of cellular factors required for
RGNNV infection, such as cell-specific receptors. The
other is the presence or absence of cellular factors which
repress RGNNV infection. With regard to the former
possibility, fibronectin 2 of zebrafish (Danio rerio) is the
only cellular factor which has so far been identified for
fish viruses. Zebrafish fibronectin 2 mediates infectious
hematopoietic necrosis virus attachment and cell entry
[21]. Cell-surface sialic acid is involved in binding of
RGNNV to SSN-1 cells and other cellular molecules are
required along with sialic acid for RGNNV penetration
into some human cell lines [22,23]. However, such a cellular molecule essential for betanodavirus infection has not
yet been identified. OLME-104 cells were severely less
susceptible to RGNNV (Figure 1), suggesting the lacks of
specific cellular factors for RGNNV. Meanwhile, OLHNI1 and OLHNI-2 cells were highly susceptible to RGNNV
(Figure 1), suggesting that these cell lines possess a positive cellular factor for betanodavirus infection. With
respect to the latter possible mechanism, the culture
supernatant of OLME-104 cells included an antiviral substance that protected some of the medaka cell lines from
RGNNV-infection (authors' unpublished data). These
results indicate that OLME-104 cells produce an interferon-like signal molecule irrespective of viral infection,
which brings themselves into antiviral state. Furthermore, these data also indicate that some medaka cells

Adachi et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:150
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/150

used in this study are sensitive to such a defense signal
molecule.
The OLCAB-e21, OLCAB-e31, and OLF-136 cells
infected by RGNNV produced sufficient amounts of
infectious virus particles in the culture supernatant
(Table 2) though the levels of CPE and viral spread were
tightly limited (Figures 2 and 3). These characteristics
suggest that the cells entered into antiviral states after
viral infections. Similar to mammalian Mx proteins, fish
Mx proteins also possess type I interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo [24-27]. Grouper
(Epinephelus coioides) Mx proteins inhibited the propagation of RGNNV in the grouper brain cells [28]. In addition, the BB cell line derived from the brain of
barramundi (Lates calcarifer) was infected persistently
with RGNNV and this viral persistence in BB cells was
well correlated with the expression of Mx gene [29,30].
Thus, an IFN-like substance might be produced in the
culture supernatant of the RGNNV-infected OLCABe21, OLCAB-e31, and OLF-136 cells, which induces the
cells into antiviral states. However, Mx gene expression
was detected by RT-PCR in OLCAB-e31 cells inoculated
with RGNNV, not in inoculated OLCAB-e21 or OLF-136
cells (authors' unpublished data). These results suggest
that a defense machinery other than the IFN system
works in OLCAB-e21 and OLF-136 cells. Taken together,
a few kinds of defense systems could function to protect
the medaka cells from RGNNV infection.
E-11 cells [12] cloned from SSN-1 cells are infected
latently with snakehead retrovirus (SnRV) [31]. SnRV
regulates positively [32] or negatively [33] the infections
of fish cells with betanodaviruses. In our experiments,
SnRV was detected by RT-PCR in all of the medaka cells
inoculated with RGNNV prepared from infected E-11
cells. However, there was no correlation between susceptibilities of medaka cells to RGNNV and the levels of RTPCR signals for SnRV (authors' unpublished data).

Conclusions
In this report, we examined the susceptibility of various
medaka cell lines to RGNNV, and found that RGNNV can
infect and propagate in many kinds of established
medaka cells. Studies on host-betanodavirus interactions
using these medaka cell lines would lead to the identification of host factors essential for betanodavirus infections.
Especially, OLHNI-1 and OLHNI-2 cells would be suitable for such studies in molecular aspects.
Methods
Cells and viruses

The three medaka cell lines, OLHE-131, OLF-136, and
OLME-104 (Table 1), were purchased from RIKEN BRC
Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). The other seven medaka cell

Page 6 of 7

lines (Table 1) [34] were provided from H. Mitani. All the
medaka cells were cultured at 30°C in Leibovitz's L-15
medium (L-15) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS). E-11 cells [12] were
cultured in L-15 medium supplemented with 5% FBS.
The betanodavirus used in this study was RGNNV
(SGWak97 strain) [35]. Virus was prepared from the
inoculated E-11 cells when more than 90% of the inoculated cells showed CPE. Viral titers were determined
based on TCID50 [36] using E-11 cells.
Viral inoculation and multiplication assay

Medaka cells were seeded in 24-well plates and were
inoculated with RGNNV at 30°C for 1 h. For each cell
line, 1.0-1.5 × 105 cells were inoculated with 103, 105, or
106 TCID50 of virus. The cells were washed to remove
unbound viral particles and were further cultured at the
same temperature. The culture supernatant was recovered periodically and its viral titer was determined by the
TCID50 assay as described above.
Immunofluorescence microscopy

Indirect immunofluorescence assay was performed using
inoculated medaka cells as described previously [22].
Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% NP-40 in PBS. The
cells then were treated with a 1:1000 dilution of antiRGNNV CP antiserum, followed by the treatment with a
1:2000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Invitrogen), and were observed under the fluorescence
microscope (ORCA-1394 and AQUA-Lite version 1.10
systems; Hamamatsu photonics K. K., Hamamatsu,
Japan).
