Abstract
Background: Cyanidiales are unicellular extremophilic red algae that inhabit acidic and high
temperature sites around hot springs and have also adapted to life in endolithic and interlithic
habitats. Comparative genomic analysis of Cyanidioschyzon merolae and Galdieria sulphuraria predicts
that the latter may be more broadly distributed in extreme environments because its genome
contains membrane transporters involved in the uptake of reduced carbon compounds that are
absent from C. merolae. Analysis of an endolithic site in the Phlegrean Fields near Naples, Italy is
consistent with this prediction showing this population to be comprised solely of the newly
described lineage Galdieria-B and C. merolae to be limited to humid habitats. Here, we conducted
an environmental PCR survey of another extreme environment in Tuscany, Italy and contrasted
Cyanidiales population structure at endolithic and interlithic habitats in Naples and Tuscany.
Results: We find a second Galdieria lineage (Galdieria-A) in endolithic and interlithic habitats in
Tuscany but surprisingly Cyanidium was also present at these sites. The photoautotrophic Cyanidium
apparently survives below the rock surface where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis. C.
merolae is absent from all endolithic and interlithic sites in Tuscany. Population genetic analyses of
a partial calmodulin gene fragment suggest a recent establishment or recurrent gene flow between
populations in Tuscany, whereas the highly structured Galdieria-B population in Naples likely
originated from 2–3 founder events. We find evidence of several recombination events across the
calmodulin gene, potentially indicating the presence of sexual reproduction in the Tuscany
populations.
Conclusion: Our study provides important data regarding population structure in extreme
endolithic environments and insights into how Cyanidiales may be established in and adapt to these
hostile environments.

Background
The endolithic environment affords microorganisms protection from desiccation, rapid temperature variation, and
UV radiation flux [1-3]. This microhabitat may, however,
be extremely challenging, in particular for photosynthetic
organisms because of limiting light (e.g., 1% of daylight)
and nutrient conditions [1]. The Cyanidiales are unicellular red algae that thrive in endolithic habitats (see Fig. 1A,
1B) [1,4].
As eukaryotic extremophiles, Cyanidiales grow at high
temperature (50° – 55°C) and in extremely acidic (pH 0.5
– 3.0) habitats around hot springs and/or acidic sulfur
fumes [5-8]. Because of their simple morphology, only
three genera (Cyanidium, Cyanidioschyzon, and Galdieria)
and six species of Cyanidiales have historically been recognized [5,9-12]. However, we recently discovered a high
biodiversity of Cyanidiales at sites in Pisciarelli in the
Phlegrean Fields near Napoli, Italy that included three
putative new genus/order-level lineages. The results of this
study suggested the one of the new lineages, provisionally
named Galdieria-B, was adapted to and dominated the
endolithic habitat [6].
Among previously described Cyanidiales, members of the
genus Galdieria are distributed among inter- and endolithic habitats in addition to diverse microhabitats including non-thermophilic sites [1,5,6,12-14]. This genus is
heterotrophic and mixotrophic, can grow on more than
50 carbon sources, and tolerates a broad range of pH (0.5
– 6.0) and salinity (4 – 10%) [5,12]. The metabolic flexibility of Galdieria may explain why this genus can thrive in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/78

diverse environments in contrast to Cyanidioschyzon merolae which appears to be limited to humid habitats [6]. A
recent comparative genomic analysis of these two species
supports this view showing the presence of a large number
of membrane transporters involved in the uptake of
reduced carbon compounds in the Galdieria sulphuraria
genome that are absent from C. merolae [15]. However
there is no direct evidence from physiological studies in C.
merolae to support these predictions based on genome
analyses.
Here a culture-independent, environmental PCR survey
approach was used to examine Cyanidiales species composition in nature. This method is a very efficient
approach to facilitate the discovery of uncultivated cryptic
species, particularly for unicellular microbes that may lack
distinguishing morphological characters [6,16]. We conducted an environmental PCR survey from five inter- or
endolithic populations in two geothermal areas at Larderello, a geologically active area in southern Tuscany,
Italy (Fig. 1A). Using the ribulose 6-phosphate carboxylase oxygenase (rbcL) coding region as a marker, we determined species composition at these sites and compared
these data to a typical endolithic population that was previously described from Pisciarelli (PBen site, Fig. 1B) [6].
In addition, we determined a partial sequence of the calmodulin (CaM) gene that includes 2 or 3 spliceosomal
introns from multiple individuals to address Cyanidiales
population structure. Phylogenetic analyses of rbcL
sequences from the environmental samples revealed a
clear pattern of genetic differentiation among the studied

Results
rbcL phylogeny and species distribution of Cyanidiales
The ML trees of rbcL sequences were inferred from three
data sets of 1215 nt (all three codon positions, ML-all),
810 nt (excluding 3rd codon positions, ML-1st + 2nd) and

405 aa (ML-protein) from 9 new environmental samples
of Cyanidiales that included 90 representatives. The trees
inferred from the latter two analyses share a very similar
topology with the ML-all tree (Fig. 2), except for the
monophyletic clade composed of Cyanidioschyzon merolae
and Galdieria maxima that is positioned with the GaldieriaA + -B lineage in the ML-protein tree. However this clade
was poorly supported in the bootstrap analyses (i.e., <

50%). The rbcL phylogeny is similar to a 3-gene tree found
in our previous study [6]. The ML-all tree shows strong
support for the monophyly of the Cyanidiales, with these
taxa forming a sister group to the rest of the red algae (MLall bootstrap = 95%, ML-1 + 2nd = 95%, ML-protein =
92%, and BPP = 1.0, Fig. 2). The internal topology of the
Cyanidiales indicates a division into four lineages [6]; 1)
Galdieria spp. (Galdiera-A and -B lineages, excluding Galdieria maxima), 2) Cyanidium caldarium, 3) mesophilic Cyanidium sp., and 4) Cyanidioschyzon merolae and Galdieria
maxima. Each of these lineages was strongly supported in
the bootstrap analysis, however their interrelationships
are poorly resolved (Fig. 2). As apparent in the tree G.
maxima is clearly separated from the other Galdieria species (e.g., G. sulphuraria, G. daedala, and G. partita) and
shows a close relationship to C. merolae. This result is congruent with our previous study [6] and suggests that a taxonomic revision is required for the genus Galdieria.
We sequenced a total of 90 rbcL-encoding clones from five
sites. All of these clones were positioned in the GaldieriaA and Cyanidium lineages. Members of the Galdieria-A lineage were found at Monte Rotondo-4 (MR4in) (13/17
clones), Monte Rotondo-5 (MR5en) (6/15 clones), Monte
Rotondo-6 (MR6en) (15/18 clones), Sasso Pissano-1
(SP1in) (4/22 clones), and Sasso Pissano-3 (SP3en) (18/
18 clones). All clones from the SP3 site were however
restricted to the Galdieria-A type. We did not find any representatives of the Galdieria-B lineage from the Larderello
populations. This is in contrast to Pisciarelli which
included an endolithic habitat (i.e., PBen, 19/19 of Galdieria-B) [6]. It is noteworthy that members of Cyanidium
were found in many Larderello populations (MR4in, 4/
17; MR5en, 9/15; MR6en, 3/18; and SP1in, 18/22) but
were absent from the PBen site [6].
Population structure inferred from calmodulin intron
sequences
The 18 rbcL sequences of Galdieria-A from the SP3en site
were virtually identical except for 1–2 non-informative
substitutions per insert among the ca. 700 bp that were
sampled. Similar to the SP3en site, the Pisciarelli-B (PBen)
clones also consisted of virtually identical rbcL sequences
of Galdieria-B [6]. To address the population structure at
these sites, we chose to sample a more rapidly evolving
nuclear sequence. Therefore, we determined a partial
sequence of the CaM gene from DNA clones isolated from
the SP3en and PBen sites. Twenty sequences from SP3en
and 15 sequences from Pisciarelli-B were determined.
Because SP3en showed a relatively high divergence rate
within the CaM spliceosomal introns, we determined
more sequences from MR4in (2 seq.), MR5en (14 seq.),
and MR6en (15 seq.) to address this finding at the Larderello sites. In addition, a homologous region of the
CaM gene from Galdieria sulphuraria DBV-009 and UTEX

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/78

2393 strains was also determined as reference. Cyanidioschyzon merolae, which lacks introns in the CaM gene
(CMK219C from the Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome
Project), was used to determine the sites of intron insertion.
The partial CaM coding region (nucleotides 58 – 283rd
position in C. merolae) showed size variation (338 – 342
nt in length) in the SP-3 population (Galdieria-A). Two
introns were found following the 95th and 178th nucleotide positions in the alignment and were of size 58 – 62
nt and 54 nt, respectively (Fig 3A). There were guanine
and thymine (GT) repeats in the first intron (4x – GT, 8
clones; 5x – GT, 5 clones; 6x – GT, 7 clones) that gave rise
to the size variation. In contrast, the MR populations
(MR4in, MR5en, and MR6en) showed a 4 – 9x GT repeat
and the G. sulphuraria UTEX 2393 gene contained 3xrepeats in the first intron. There was no size variation (385
nt) in the CaM gene from the PBen site (Galdieria-B). The
second intron (52 nt) was found in addition to the first
(51 nt) and the third following site 178th (56 nt) in the
PBen population. Although two single-species populations share intron sites (95th and 178th), the intron
sequences are too divergent between the two populations
to be aligned. Therefore, we analyzed the PBen data separately using the CaM gene plus the intron sequences.
Although these data showed much less variation most of
the polymorphic sites are likely to be real changes rather
than due to Taq polymerase mis-incorporation or
sequencing errors due to the distribution of many as
shared or silent changes. Analysis of the distribution of
polymorphic sites showed that of 37 columns with
changes in the alignment, 18, or 49% were comprised of
changes that were shared among different clones (i.e.,
individuals), 19% were in third codon positions, and of
the other 12 unique changes, 9 were in the relatively divergent intron regions.
The ME tree using the CaM sequences shows a highly
diverse branching pattern for the SP3en population which
is comprised of a single species (Galdieria-A). Most nodes
are weakly supported. When we included the three Larderello populations (MR4in, MR5en, and MR6en), the
representatives of these sites were intermixed with the
SP3en taxa, however without strong bootstrap support
(Fig. 3B). In the ME analysis of the PBen population
(Galdieria-B) that is shown in Figure 3C there is a clear
separation of the sequences into two (possibly three) lineages. Six clones of the CaM gene form a well-supported
monophyletic group (PB-CaM Group A) with G. sulphuraria DBV-009 (ME = 100%, MP = 100%, BPP = 1.0).
Two representatives (PB6, PB7; tentatively PB-CaM Group
C) of PB-CaM Group B are relatively distantly related from
the rest of this clade (ME = 94%, MP = 95%, BPP = 1.0).

Population differentiation
Congruent with the phylogenetic studies, there is no fixed
nucleotide difference between sequences from the SP3en
and MRs (collective term for MR4in, MR5en, MR6en)

populations. Out of the 38 observed mutations in the
SP3en/MRs populations, 11 are shared between populations (mutations segregating within both populations)
and 27 are present in only one population. To investigate
whether the SP3en and MRs sites constitute genetically
differentiated populations, we applied population differentiation tests that take into account the frequency of

mutations within and between populations (Table 1). The
results reveal detectable differentiation between the
SP3en and MRs populations and hence, and despite the
similarity, we can rule out a single panmictic population
constituted by the SP3en and MRs sites.
This weak, albeit detectable, differentiation may indicate
extensive gene flow between SP3en and MRs or a very
recent establishment of two isolated populations, where
shared mutations would represent ancestral polymorphism. Both scenarios predict that shared mutations
should be at similar frequencies in both populations.
Indeed, this pattern is observed between SP3en and MRs
populations (r2 = 0.35, P = 0.0001), with an average difference in the frequency of only 0.095. The amount of
gene flow required to completely eliminate fixed differences between two long-term isolated populations and
cause mutations to segregate at similar frequencies is very
high (Nm > 1, where N is the average effective population
size and m is the migration rate; see Fig. 4). On the other
hand, extensive gene flow is unlikely to be associated with
~71% (27 out of 38) of mutations being present in only
one population, tentatively suggesting that a recent establishment of two isolated populations is the most likely
scenario.

Discussions and conclusions
The Cyanidiales provide an untapped resource for understanding adaptations at the genomic level to life in
extreme environments with one complete genome
sequence already available (Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D)
[15,17] and another that is nearly finished (Galdieria sulphuraria 074G) [18]. The Cyanidiales are unique in their
ability as eukaryotes to thrive under extreme conditions at
hot springs (temperatures between 50° – 55°C, pH

between 0.5 – 3.0) [5-8,19]. These single-celled, photosynthetic red algae also have the ability to grow under low
light conditions in endolithic habitats (see Fig. 1) [1,4,6].
It is rare for eukaryotes to live beneath the rock surface,
although endolithic prokaryotic communities have often
been found in extreme conditions (e.g., deserts, hot
spring, and arctic regions) [3,4]. Endolithic Cyanidiales
were first reported from Pisciarelli and La Solfatara near
Naples, Italy [1]. These authors assumed, based on gross
morphology (i.e., cell size from SEM images, see Fig. 3 in
Gross et al. [1]) that the endolithic Cyandiales were species of Cyanidium and Galdieria. However, traditional taxonomic characters are not very useful in identifying
morphologically simple, coccoid Cyanidiales cells [5,6].
We recently surveyed environmental samples from Pisciarelli and found a new lineage termed Galderia-B that
dominates the endolithic habitat [6]. It was postulated
that Galdieria-B had adapted to this relatively dry environment. Here we tested whether Galdieria-B also dominates
the endolithic habitat at another site (Larderello, Tuscany,
Italy) and contrasted the population structure in Pisciarelli and Larderello.
Galdieria-A and Cyanidum exist in endolithic habitats
The rbcL tree (Fig. 2) clearly resolves the species composition at five interlithic (MR4in and SP1in) and endolithic
(MR5en, MR6en, and SP3en) sites. Four sites (except
SP3en) were composed of two species, Galdieria-A and
Cyanidium caldarium. The SP3en site consisted of a single
species (Galdieria-A). Individuals of Galdieria-A were more
abundant in the endolithic populations (100% SP3en,
83% MR6en), however this species was also abundant at
an interlithic site (76% at MR4in). C. caldarium was distributed in interlithic (82% SP1in, 24% MR4in) and
endolithic (60% MR5en, 17% MR6en) habitats. It is sur-

Figure 4
Expected influence of gene flow on genetic differentiation between two populations
Expected influence of gene flow on genetic differentiation between two populations. Gene flow is measured as Nm (the product between the effective population size, N, and the migration rate, m) and genetic differentiation is investigated by means of
the frequency of fixed mutations between the populations (f-fix), the frequency of polymorphisms present in a single population
(f-pa), and the difference in frequency between mutations shared between both populations (d-f). The results are based on coalescent simulations under different conditions of gene flow and conditional to the number of observed mutations and the
number of chromosomes. In our analyses comparing SP3en and MRs sites, f-fix is zero, the observed f-pa is 0.71, and the
observed d-f is 0.095, suggesting Nm > 1.

prising, despite our low sample size, that we did not identify other Cyanidiales species (i.e., Cyanidioschyzon
merolae, Galdieria-B, and G. maxima) at the Larderello
sites. Galdieria-B was of particular interest because it was
rich in endolithic (100% PBen) and interlithic (40% P-C)
sites at Pisciarelli [6]. These data suggest that several genetically divergent Cyanidiales taxa have likely adapted to
flourish in the endolithic environment.
In contrast to sites around fumaroles or in hot acid
springs, the endolithic environment appears to offer a relatively stable habitat. There is an absence of rapid temperature variation resulting from hot sulphur fumes, UV
radiation flux, and desiccation (i.e., the rock provides
moisture and protection from desiccation [1-3]. However,
endolithic sites are limiting with respect to light – less
then 1% of daylight is available for photosynthesis [1]. It
may, therefore, be surprising that the Cyanidiales are able
to thrive in endolithic environments. Galdieria has however been reported to be heterotrophic and mixotrophic

and able to grow on more than 50 carbon sources
[5,12,20]. Galdieria takes up a broad range of sugars and
sugar alcohols using a variety of membrane transporters
[20] that have been identified in the G. sulphuraria
genome [15]. Gross et al. [1] demonstrated heterotrophic
growth of G. sulphuraria using as nutrients an acid extract
of autotrophically grown Galdieria cells. Therefore, it is
possible that Galdieria grows photoautotrophically at the
top of the biomat directly beneath the rock surface,
whereas these cells grow heterotrophically in deeper
regions of the algal layer, surviving on organic materials
provided by dead cells [1].
Because of the apparent inability of Cyanidium caldarium
to grow heterotrophically, it has not previously been
regarded as an endolithic species [6,15]. However, our
study provides evidence that C. caldarium can also thrive
in endolithic sites. It is still unknown whether C. caldarium encodes the membrane transporters identified in the
Galdieria genome, although this species has characters

such as a cell wall, a central vacuole, and the osmolyte
floridoside (as in Galdieria) [12,15] that are critical for
heterotrophic growth. It is also possible that C. caldarium
thrives without heterotrophy just below the rock surface
where adequate light is available for photosynthesis
[1,15]. These hypotheses need to be tested using controlled environmental conditions to assess their relevance.
Recently, another endolithic population was reported
from Norris Geyser basin of Yellowstone National Park,
USA [4]. These authors found four ribosomal (r) RNA
sequences that were "closely related Cyanidium species"
without providing species identifications. We included
these sequences in phylogenetic trees (results not shown)
and identified them as originating from G. suphularia
(Galdieria-A; AY911434, AY911459), G. maxima
(AY911496), and C. merolae (AY911454). The most
intriguing observation is of C. merolae from an endolithic
site, which contrasts to the finding of our study at Pisciarelli and Tuscany. It is generally thought C. merolae
would not survive in the endolithic environment because
it lacks a cell wall and a vacuole which are crucial for
maintaining and regulating turgor pressure and the
osmotic potential [5,12,15]. In addition, the genome of
this alga does not contain many membrane transporter
genes which appear to be critical for heterotrophic
growth; i.e., it encodes only one monosaccharide transporter [15,17]. However, the genome of C. merolae does
encode all the metabolic enzymes required for heterotrophic growth (i.e., GlcMan and Gal; for details see reference [15]). These genomic features are generally
consistent with (but do not prove) the idea that the ecophysiological characters of C. merolae make it an obligatory photoautotroph that is limited to humid
microhabitats such as in Pisciarelli, Naples, Italy [6]. Consistent with the predicted dominance of C. merolae in
humid environments, Ferris et al [16], in a 18S rDNAbased environmental survey in Nymph Creek were able to
recover only this taxon out of 162 clones that were isolated from this acidic stream. Nymph Creek is near Norris
Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park. Despite these
promising data, it is clear that understanding the true lim-

its to the distribution of C. merolae in nature will require
future sampling of many other sites.
Establishment of endolithic Cyanidiales populations
How Cyanidiales colonize an endolithic habitat remains
unknown. Gross et al. [1] suggested two possible mechanisms: 1) inoculation through cracks in the upper silica
layer, and 2) the formation of the upper rock layer after
Cyanidiales had colonized the rock surface, although it is
unknown under which time scale the latter process may
occur. If the endolithic sites were colonized by a single or
a few cells via inoculation, these regions would potentially show low sequence diversity reflecting the chance
entry of the founder cells. If the populations originated via
covering of the rock surface, the sequence diversity would
potentially be higher such as at non-endolithic (i.e., interlithic) sites. Selection for desiccation tolerance could however cause a selective sweep that would result in a strong
reduction of genetic diversity after the origin of a covering
rock layer. Upcoming multi-locus studies will allow us to
discriminate between these two scenarios based on the
fact that strongly advantageous mutations will influence
polymorphism at particular genomic regions or chromosomes whereas recent colonization is expected to have
genome-wide effects on polymorphism.

Because the CaM intron regions from Galdieria at the Larderello (Galdieria-A; SP3en, MR4in, MR5en, MR6en) and
Pisciarelli (Galdieria-B; PBen) endolithic sites could not be
reliably aligned these data sets were analyzed separately.
The tree of the Larderello sequences shown in Figure 3B
shows a paraphyletic radiation of Galdieria-A into the four
sites. However, most nodes in this tree are weakly supported and there appears to be poor resolution of
sequence interrelationships. This may indicate recurrent
gene flow between the SP3en, MR4in, MR5en, and MR6en
sites or extensive ancestral polymorphisms reflecting
recent population establishment. Interestingly, CaM
sequence diversity of the endolithic cells at the SP3en,
MR5en and MR6en sites was similar to that of the interlithic MR4in site. In contrast, the CaM sequences from the
endolithic Pisciarelli PBen site formed 2 distinct clades

suggesting that two (or potentially three) independent
inoculations of Galdieria-B occurred here. The significant
differences between the topologies shown in Figures 3B
and 3C are noteworthy and may provide important
insights into how these endolithic populations were
established.
A potential explanation for the difference in CaM gene
diversity in Larderello versus Pisciarelli is that cells at the
former site originated through the addition of a rock layer
over an existing genetically diverse population. Gross et al.
[1] provided preliminary support for this colonization
method based on their finding that after the application
of an artificial silica layer on Galdieria cells, these algae
maintain a dark-green color for 4 weeks, even when the
silica layer becomes 1 mm thick [1]. In contrast, the PBen
population was likely colonized by inoculation of 2 – 3
founder cells. One of the founder cells at the PBen site is
closely related to the DBV009 strain at the University of
Naples culture collection that was isolated from a single
colony.
Recombination at intragenic level
The study of CaM sequences from the SP3en and MRs sites
reveals an unexpected nucleotide pattern, with a minimum of 6 recombination events across the CaM region
based on the conservative approach of investigating the
presence of four gametic types [21] (see Methods for
details). This observation is not compatible with a genetic
system with the complete absence of genetic recombination (P < 0.0001). The study of the SP3en and MRs sites
separately generates equivalent results, with a minimum
of 4 and 5 recombination events, respectively (P < 0.0001
in both cases). These results are intriguing because they
hint at the existence (present or in the recent past) of sexual reproduction in the Cyanidiales, a process that has
never been observed in these algae either in culture or in
the wild. Future population analyses across the genome
will allow us better understand the evolutionary causes of
this pattern.

Methods
Description of sampling sites
The geothermal sites for our collection in the Larderello
region of Tuscany were Sasso Pisano and Monte Rotondo.
Sasso Pisano contains several fumaroles and ''putizze''
which are vapours emanating from rocks, giving them a
deep yellow hue. Pools are absent from this area and the
surrounding soil is rubbly and hot with temperatures
ranging from 25 – 45°C. Monte Rotondo has boraciferous
fumaroles that flow from underneath the soil at a temperature ranging from 100 – 160°C. The biomats of Cyanidiales occur as thin layers on the rocks, between the
crushed stones, and inside the rock layer (Fig. 1A).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/78

To survey the endolithic Cyanidiales populations, we collected cells from the biomat at five different endolithic (or
interlithic) sites (three in Monte Rotondo and two in
Sasso Pissano). The Sasso Pisano-1 (SP1in) material was
collected in a ravine of a crumbly wall between the detritus (this was an interlithic population). The temperature
was ca. 29 – 31°C with a low pH (0.5 – 1.0). In the second
sample (SP3en), the Cyanidiales biomat formed a thin
layer inside a stone with the side containing the cells in
contact with soil and never exposed to the sunlight. The
pH at this site was low (1.0) and the temperature was ca.
30°C (this was an endolithic population). The Monte
Rotondo-4 (MR4in) site had a population of Cyanidiales
growing among trachytic and detritic rocks, on the hot soil
(50°C, interlithic population). The Monte Rotondo-5
(MR5en) and Monte Rotondo-6 (MR6en) sites were
endolithic in which the biomat grew inside the thin rock
layers which were 0.5 cm in thickness at a depth of 0.3 cm.
To collect Cyanidiales samples, we removed the surface
rock using a hammer, and the cells were collected by
scraping the thin algal layer into 50 mL Falcon tubes.
It is important to note that the endolithic condition at
Sasso Pisano and Monte Rotondo was quite different from
that of Pisciarelli [6]. The rock walls of the endolithic sites
at Pisciarelli are strongly leached and appear hard, solid,
and white due to the presence of alunite. The gases and
vapors come from the surrounding fumaroles and pools
with minor flow, and the temperature is always low (18 –
20°C). In contrast, at the Larderello geothermal endolithic sites, the rocks are more friable and crumbly, but
neither opal nor alunite is present. Vapour arising from
fissures heats these rocks.
Environmental PCR
Genomic DNA was extracted from the environmental
samples using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Santa
Clarita, CA, USA). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were
done using the Cyanidiales-specific primers for the rbcL
gene, which recognize conserved complementary
sequences from members of all the different Cyanidiales
lineages [6]. We are confident that there is no primer-bias
or PCR-bias in our environmental PCR survey because we
tested the efficacy of PCR-amplification using not only
environmental materials but also DNA isolated from different cultured Cyanidales (for details, see [6]). The PCR
products were purified (QIAquick PCR Purification kit,
Qiagen) and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). A
total of 90 clones were picked (up to 20 per site) and the
inserts were sequenced using the BigDye™ Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Kit (PE-Applied Biosystems, Norwalk,
CT, USA), and an ABI-3100 at the Roy J. Carver Center for
Comparative Genomics at the University of Iowa. One of
the PCR primers (i.e., rbcL-90F) was used to provide preliminary sequence to identify the species of Cyanidiales

from the 90 clones derived from the five separate environmental sites (sequence reads were approximately 700 nt
in length). Thereafter, we completed the rbcL sequence
(1215 nt) using additional sequencing primers. One colony was selected to represent each species found in the
five environmental sites. These complete sequences were
used for the phylogenetic analysis.
We chose two populations that consist of single species to
address in detail their population structure (i.e., SP3en,
this study; Pisciarelli-B, [6]). A partial fragment of the calmodulin gene (CaM) that occurs in single copy and contains 2–3 introns was used for this purpose. Four novel
degenerate primers were designed to amplify the CaM
gene based on available data from the Cyanidioschyzon
merolae Genome Project [22] and the Galdieria sulphuraria
Genome Project [23] (with the aid of A. Weber, Michigan
State University): Calmo140F; 5'-GAA KCR GAR TTR
MGA GAR ATG AT-3', Calmo160F; 5'-GAR ATG ATH GCV
GAR GTW GA-3', Calmo510R; 5'-CTT CMT CBG TAA GYT
TTT CTC C-3'; Calmo580R; 5'-ATC YGC TTC RCG AAT
CAT TTC-3'. After amplification, the CaM fragment was
cloned and sequenced as described above. We also
included the CaM sequences from the Galdieria sulphuraria
DBV-009 and UTEX 2393 strains as the positive control in
these analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses
All sequences were manually aligned using SeqPup [24]
and are available upon request from D. B. For the rbcL
gene, we included 24 representatives of the Cyanidiales
that consist of 9 new sequences from Larderello (Tuscany), representing 90 individuals and 15 sequences from
a previous study [6]. We used non-Cyanidiales red algae as
the outgroup in this analysis. We prepared three data sets
for the rbcL analysis to assess, and when necessary, to
ameliorate the possible misleading effects of mutational
saturation in the DNA sequences [5]. The first data set
included all three codon positions (1215 nt), whereas the
second excluded third codon positions (810 nt), and the
third consisted of the translated to amino acid sequences
(405 aa).

The maximum likelihood (ML) method was used to infer
the phylogeny using the rbcL data. We used the site-specific, general time reversible model (ssGTR) [25] with estimations of nucleotide frequencies, the shape parameter of
the gamma distribution with separate model parameter
estimates for the 3 data partitions (i.e., 1st, and 2nd, and 3rd
codon positions) with the PAUP* computer program
[26]. Ten heuristic searches with random-additionsequence starting trees and tree bisection-reconnection
(TBR) branch rearrangements were used to find the optimal ML tree.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/78

To test the stability of monophyletic groups in the ML
analyses, 1000 bootstrap replicates [27] were analyzed
using the GTR + Γ + I model with the phyML program
[28]. In the Bayesian inference of the DNA data (MrBayes
V3.0b4) [29], we used the site-specific GTR + Γ (ssGTR)
model. Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMCMC) from a random starting tree was initiated in
the Bayesian inference and run for 1,000,000 generations.
Trees were sampled each 200 cycles. Four chains were run
simultaneously of which 3 were heated and one was cold,
with the initial 400,000 cycles (2000 trees) being discarded as the "burn-in". A consensus tree was made with
the remaining 3,000 phylogenies to determine the posterior probabilities (BPP) at the different nodes. For the
analysis of data set of 1st and 2nd codon position, the same
settings were implemented in the ML and Bayesian inference as described above except for the use of a 2-partition
evolutionary model (i.e., 1st, and 2nd codon positions).
For the protein rbcL data, a ML tree was inferred using
"proml" (PHYLIP V3.6) [30] and the JTT + Γ evolutionary
model with 10 random-sequence additions and global
rearrangements. Bootstrap analysis was done with these
data using the WAG + Γ + I model (1000 replicates) using
phyML as described above. Bayesian inference of the protein data was done using the WAG + Γ + I model. For the
CaM data set (340 bp), we used the minimum evolution
(ME) method with HKY85 distances. Bootstrap analysis
(1000 replicates) was conducted with ME and MP methods. The GTR + Γ + I model was used in the Bayesian inference of the CaM data.
Population genetic analyses
To investigate population differentiation, we estimated
several population statistics (Kst, Kst*, Zn, Zn*, and Snn)
[31,32]. These statistics take into account, to a different
degree, mutations that fully differentiate populations (i.e.,
fixed mutations), the possible difference in frequency of
mutations that are shared between populations (i.e.,
shared polymorphisms), and the presence of segregating
mutations in only one population (i.e., particular polyTable 3: Genetic Differentiation Statistics Based on Population

morphisms). The application of population genetic models, with different degrees of isolation and migration, to
evaluate the most likely scenario is not appropriate in this
case because both SP3en and MRs populations exhibit a
strong departure from equilibrium predictions, with an
excess of low-frequency variants (data not shown). The
probability of observing population differentiation was
obtained based on a permutation test with 1000 replicates.
To investigate the presence of intragenic recombination
along the CaM sequence, we estimated the minimum
number of recombination events (Rm) following Hudson
and Kaplan [21]. Rm is based on the presence of four
gametic combinations and underestimates the actual
number of recombination events across a given sequence.
Note also that Rm is not a population parameter for the
rate of recombination hence it is independent of population genetics assumptions. A possible caveat to the use of
Rm as a conservative measure for the presence of recombination would be a high incidence of recurrent mutations at a single site (i.e., sites with more than 2 variants)
that could generate pairs of sites with four gametic combinations in the absence of recombination. We can, however, rule out this possibility because our SP3en/MRsCaM data reveal that there is no site with more than 2 variants. The probability of observing Rm under conditions
with no recombination was obtained using 10,000 coalescent simulations of the neutral process (a conservative
approach when there is an excess of low-frequency variants), conditional to the observed number of polymorphisms and number of chromosomes under study [33].
