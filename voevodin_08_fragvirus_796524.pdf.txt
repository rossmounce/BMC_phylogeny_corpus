The wide availability of PCR-based methods for the
amplification of nucleic acids homologous to known viral
genomes plus automated DNA sequencing have led to
explosive growth of a new field, 'proxy' virus isolation.
Typically, genomic fragments are amplified and subjected
to phylogenetic analysis showing that they are related to,
but distinct from, known 'bona fide' viruses. These "new
viruses" are now commonly reported in the virological literature and are too numerous to cite here, two studies are
given as typical examples [1,2]. Although unintentional,
these reports may, mislead the readership of scientific
journals and the general press. Having no distinction
between preliminary genome-based evidence and conclusive proof by biological isolation and characterization of
a replication-competent virus blurs the meaning of new
virus.
To distinguish presumptive viruses known primarily
through genomic sequence fragments from bona fide
viruses we propose the term 'frag-virus'.
The 'frag-virus status' may be intermediary between 'full'
recognition as a new virus, as occurred, for example, with
hepatitis C virus and Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus [3-6].
Frag-virus designation may also be a category for such
virus that likely exists, but there is neither sufficient motivation nor resources to pursue its elevation from frag-virus
limbo to bona fide virus status. At the same time the fragvirus status will be a 'career end-point' for sequences
belonging to non-infectious 'pseudo-viruses' or those having their origins in artifact.

Whatever the 'fate' of frag-viruses, this simple term is
highly informative and may prove useful in preventing
misconceptions about new viruses.
