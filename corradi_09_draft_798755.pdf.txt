lution of a large bayeri genome of Octosporea
<p>The draft genome sequence genome</p> bayeri, a microsporidian pathogen of Daphnia, provides insights into the content and evoThe Octosporea microsporidian sequence

Abstract
Background: The highly compacted 2.9-Mb genome of Encephalitozoon cuniculi placed the
microsporidia in the spotlight, encoding a mere 2,000 proteins and a highly reduced suite of
biochemical pathways. This extreme level of reduction is not universal across the microsporidia,
with genomes known to vary up to sixfold in size, suggesting that some genomes may harbor a gene
content that is not as reduced as that of Enc. cuniculi. In this study, we present an in-depth survey
of the large genome of Octosporea bayeri, a pathogen of Daphnia magna, with an estimated genome
size of 24 Mb, in order to shed light on the organization and content of a large microsporidian
genome.
Results: Using Illumina sequencing, 898 Mb of O. bayeri genome sequence was generated, resulting
in 13.3 Mb of unique sequence. We annotated a total of 2,174 genes, of which 893 encodes proteins
with assigned function. The gene density of the O. bayeri genome is very low on average, but also
highly uneven, so gene-dense regions also occur. The data presented here suggest that the O. bayeri
proteome is well represented in this analysis and is more complex that that of Enc. cuniculi.
Functional annotation of O. bayeri proteins suggests that this species might be less biochemically
dependent on its host for its metabolism than its more reduced relatives.
Conclusions: The combination of the data presented here, together with the imminent annotated
genome of Daphnia magna, will provide a wealth of genetic and genomic tools to study host-parasite
interactions in an interesting model for pathogenesis.

Background

Microsporidia are extremely successful, highly adapted obligate intracellular parasites known to infect a wide range of
animals, such as arthropods, fish, and mammals, including
humans [1,2]. These parasites are characterized by the presence of a highly specialized host invasion apparatus called the
polar tube (or polar filament), which is used to penetrate and
infect new host cells. Microsporidian cells significantly differ
from other eukaryotes, as they lack conventional mitochondria and Golgi apparatus and harbor 70S instead of 80S
ribosomes [3-5]. These features were once taken to suggest
that microsporidia represent a very ancient eukaryotic lineage [6-11], but recent advances in cell biology, genome
sequencing, and phylogenetic reconstruction have all shown
that all these apparently primitive features instead reflect an
extreme state of reduction, perhaps a result of their obligate
intracellular parasitic lifestyle. Instead, it is now widely
acknowledged that microsporidia are, in fact, related to fungi,
and have relict mitochondria (called mitosomes) [12], degenerated eukaryote-like ribosomal RNA subunits [13], and
reduced genes and genomes [14-24].
The extremely reduced nature of microsporidian genomes
has attracted attention since they were first noted at the end
of the 1990s [13], culminating in 2001 with the completion of
the first microsporidian genome from the mammalian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi [25]. The Enc. cuniculi genome
is extremely small, at only 2.9 Mb, and the 2,000 genes it
encodes provided the first compelling evidence for a strong
correlation between obligate intracellular parasitism and the
loss of metabolically important genes in eukaryotes. Metabolic capabilities are indeed significantly reduced in Enc.
cuniculi, and genes required for de novo biosynthesis of
purine and pyrimidine nucleotides or those involved in the
tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid beta-oxidation, respiratory
electron-transport chain and the F0F1-ATPase complex are
completely absent from its genome. The reduction of several
metabolic pathways in Enc. cuniculi implied that these parasites might be extremely dependent on their host for obtaining most of their metabolites and energy. For example, it has
been indeed recently demonstrated that this parasite and its
mitosomes both import ATP from its host via specific transporters [26,27].
In addition to a significant reduction in its metabolic capabilities, the genome of Enc. cuniculi is also very compact. Its
genes are reduced in size and separated by remarkably short
intergenic regions. This extreme compaction has impacted
the process of transcription so that in the microsporidia Enc.
cuniculi and Antonospora locustae a significant part of their
mRNA transcripts has been found to overlap between adjacent genes [28-30]. Genome reduction has also apparently
affected the rate of gene rearrangement, as conservation of
gene order is strikingly high among microsporidia compared
to what has been reported for other eukaryotes [31,32].

Volume 10, Issue 10, Article R106

Corradi et al. R106.2

Since the completion of the Enc. cuniculi genome, new
genomic data from other microsporidian parasites have been
limited to two in-depth genome surveys from Enterocytozoon
bieneusi and Nosema ceranae [33,34], a smaller survey from
A. locustae [32] and some very small surveys from various
other species [35-38]. The deeper-sampled genomes of Ent.
bieneusi and A. locustae show many similarities with that of
Enc. cuniculi - all three genomes are compact and contain
roughly the same number of genes and pathways - but this is
perhaps not surprising because all three genomes are also relatively small (ranging from 2.9 to 6 Mb) and might not, therefore, represent all microsporidian genomes adequately.
So how do larger microsporidian genomes compare with
smaller ones? Does their large size reflect the presence of
more genes and pathways or do they harbor the same genes
but separated by much larger intergenic regions? These questions have been partly addressed with genome surveys from
Spraguea lophii [35], Vittaforma cornea [36], Edhazardia
aedis, and Brachiola algerae [37,38], but because of their
very low sequence coverage no conclusion can be drawn
about their overall gene content and evolution. In the present
study, we provide a 37× sequence coverage of the large
genome of the microsporidian Octosporea bayeri. O. bayeri
is a parasite of the freshwater planktonic crusteacean Daphnia magna [39]. Other Daphnia species have never been
found to be infected. The parasite is both horizontally and
vertically transmitted [40]. Vertical transmission occurs with
100% efficiency to the asexual (parthenogenetic) eggs of the
host and with somewhat reduced efficiency to the sexual eggs.
Horizontal transmission occurs after the host cadaver decomposes and environmental spores are released. Infection follows ingestion of spores by the filter feeding host. The
parasite reduces host survival and fecundity. Its geographic
distribution is limited to rock pool D. magna populations
along the baltic Sea in Finland and Sweden [39] and a single
report from the Czech Republic.
From our sequence survey, over 13 Mb of unique O. bayeri
sequence data have been assembled and 2,174 ORFs have
been identified, providing an excellent framework to characterize the overall gene content and structure of a large microsporidian genome, to compare it with its more reduced
relatives and to increase the availability of genetic markers
from this latter species. Consistent with small surveys from
microsporidia with large genomes, the gene density of the O.
bayeri genome is generally low but also highly variable. Most
of the genes known in the Enc. cuniculi genome are also found
in O. bayeri, but a number of other genes are also found that
are apparently absent in other microsporidia. The functional
distribution of the proteins significantly differed between O.
bayeri and its more reduced relatives, suggesting the metabolic capacity and host dependency within the group is also
variable. The wealth of genomic data from this parasite coupled with the annotation of the Daphnia genome should fur-

ther increase the interest for this model of host-parasite
interactions [41].

Results
Gene content of the O. bayeri genome
Approximately 898 Mb of DNA sequence was obtained from
shotgun and paired-end 35-bp reads with the Illumina
Genome Analyzer™, resulting in an estimated 34.2 to 37.2×
coverage of the O. bayeri genome, which has been estimated
to 24 Mb based on total number of bases sequenced divided
by the average coverage. This calculation does not take into
account the fact that some assembled contigs might represent
several identical regions in the reference genome, and that
unassembled reads might represent DNA sequences from
other sources (that is, contaminants). Reads were assembled
into 41,804 contigs representing a total of 13.3 Mb of
sequence data (26% G+C), with only 20 contigs displaying
evidence of contamination. The length of contigs averaged
320 bp (100 bp to a maximum of 8 kb). The small size of most
contigs resulted in the incompleteness of most ORFs identified in this study and, on average, incomplete ORFs were
found to encode 60% of the amino acids of their respective
eukaryotic homologs. This explains why the complete (or
almost complete) O. bayeri proteome has been identified

Corradi et al. R106.3

within an assembly that is almost half the size of the estimated genome.
A total of four rRNA genes, 37 tRNAs and 2,174 predicted protein-coding ORFs were identified (Table 1). Of the O. bayeri
ORFs, 1,405 were found to have homologs in the Enc. cuniculi
genome, representing about 70% of its annotated genes [25]
(Additional data file 1). Over 93% of Enc. cuniculi proteins
with assigned functions and 53% of its hypothetical proteins
had clear homologs in the O. bayeri genome [25,33]. Over
25% of Enc. cuniculi homologs identified are full length, while
others were slightly truncated in the carboxy-terminal or
amino-terminal regions, or both. Another 80 ORFs were
identified that were found to have homologs in other organisms, but not Enc. cuniculi, 72 of which could be assigned to a
functional category (Additional data file 2), the majority of
which have highest similarities with fungal homologs, suggesting that they are ancestral within the lineage and not
recently introduced into the O. bayeri genome. The remaining 689 O. bayeri putative ORFs (of at least 200 amino acids)
returned no significant hits in BLAST homology searches
against the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) non-redundant database. However, 25 of these
showed significant similarities with hypothetical proteins
from the A. locustae database, indicating that O. bayeri and
A. locustae share a number of hypothetical proteins that are

absent in Enc. cuniculi and Ent. bieneusi. It is also important
to note that a large proportion of microsporidian hypothetical
proteins have been found to be smaller than 200 amino acids
[25,31-33], so the actual number of ORFs could be over 25%
higher than what we report here, perhaps in the range of, or
higher than, what has been recently reported for N. ceranae
[34].

Functional categories represented in O. bayeri
All identified O. bayeri ORFs were assigned to the 11 functional categories listed in [25,33] (Figure 1; Additional data
file 3). Such comparison is currently unavailable for N. ceranae [34]. O. bayeri ORFs are well distributed among the functional categories, yet display differences when compared to
Enc. cuniculi and Ent. bieneusi. Specifically, five categories
(metabolism, energy production, cell growth and DNA synthesis, transcription and protein destination) are more represented in O. bayeri than in Enc. cuniculi and Ent. bieneusi,
whereas four other categories (transport facilitation, intracellular transport, cellular organization - biogenesis, and cell
rescue) are reduced in number in O. bayeri. Within each
functional category, several pathways stood out as being particularly different among the three species. For instance,
genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism and glycosylation were better represented in O. bayeri (37 and 12 proteins, respectively) than either Enc. cuniculi (29 and 7
proteins) or Ent. bieneusi (8 and 5 proteins), while proteins
involved in the translocation of various substrates across
membranes are underrepresented in O. bayeri (Figure 2).

Volume 10, Issue 10, Article R106

Corradi et al. R106.4

Finally, in contrast to what has been reported for other species with smaller genomes [33,34], no evidence for gene or
segmental genome duplication events has been identified in
the present survey.

Phylogeny of O. bayeri and evolution of the ATP
transporters in the microsporidia
O. bayeri was put into a phylogenetic context by comparing
the amino acid sequences from its newly identified alpha- and
beta-tubulins with those of other microsporidia (Figure 3a).
Our tree is consistent with the most recently reported using
the same amino acid sequences [42]. Specifically, Nosema
and Encephalitozoon are sisters to one another, as are Antonospora and Brachiola. The remaining species all branch more
deeply, and O. bayeri is in this tree basal to all other microsporidian species from which large genome sequence data are
presently available. Only a single ATP transporter protein was
identified in O. bayeri, and phylogenetic analyses of all presently known microsporidian members of this family show the
O. bayeri protein clustering with strong support at the base of
a clade including Antonospora and Brachiola homologues,
all of which are sister to the Encephalitozoon/Enterocytozoon/Nosema clade (Figure 3b). This is not consistent with
the rRNA tree, and might represent a mis-rooting of either
tree, or ancient paralogy of the ATP transporters.

O. bayeri introns
Only 13 introns have been annotated in the Enc. cuniculi
genome at present, and we identified a total of 6 introns in the

present survey, all of which are homologous to introns
reported in Enc. cuniculi ribosomal protein genes (L19, L27a,
L37a, L37, L39, S26) [25]. All the O. bayeri introns identified
here are located within or close to the start codon, which is
consistent with the introns in Enc. cuniculi [25], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [43] and cryptomonad nucleomorphs [44].
The retention of the majority of these introns leads to frameshifts and termination codons, while their removal leads to a
complete ORF that is highly conserved with homologs from
other eukaryotes. The intron sequences are available with the
online version of this paper (Additional data file 4).

O. bayeri-specific large amino acid insertions
A number of large insertions ranging from 15 to 57 amino
acids were identified in 14 conserved proteins in O. bayeri (Osialoglycoprotein endopeptidase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase,  -trehalase
precursor, choline phosphate cytidyltranferase, transcription
factor of the E2F/DP family, tubulin -chain, kinesin-like protein, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit , replication factor C, T complex protein 1  subunit, threonyl tRNA
synthetase, and translation elongation factor 2). These insertions are all in-frame and in most cases are surrounded by
highly conserved amino acid motifs, although they are not
generally located within functionally important domains
(Additional data file 5). RT-PCR confirmed that none of these
inserts are removed from mRNA and so do not represent spli-

The majority of O. bayeri proteins were found to be larger
than homologs from Enc. cuniculi (69%) and Ent. bieneusi
(65%) (Figure 4). However, the opposite trend was identified
when O. bayeri genes were compared with other fungal lineages, in which case the majority of O. bayeri proteins (75% on
average) were found to be smaller than homologs from the
other fungal lineages, even when the fungal species compared
had a smaller genome than O. bayeri. The difference in the
number of amino acids was found to be significantly larger
between O. bayeri and other fungal lineages (14% smaller on
average) than between O. bayeri and other microsporidia (3%
larger on average) (Figure 4).

Gene density and synteny
Gene density and synteny in O. bayeri were examined by
annotating all ORFs of at least 100 amino acids on the 200
largest contigs (average length of 2,795 bp). In more than half
of these contigs, no putative ORF could be identified. One
contig was found to harbor three putative ORFs, whereas 72
and 22 contigs harbored one or two recognizable ORFs,
respectively. No correlation between the length of the contigs
and the number of ORFs could be identified (Figure 5a).
Based on these contigs, gene density was calculated to be 1
gene every 4,593 bases. However, when two or more ORFs
were identified on the same contig the average intergenic
region was calculated to be only 429 bp, suggesting the gene
density is highly variable across the genome. Conservation in
gene order could be identified in only two cases, representing
8% of all the gene pairs identified (Figure 5b).

Repeated elements
The large amount of small, non-coding DNA sequences identified in this study could reflect the presence of highly
repeated sequences in the O. bayeri genome. This possibility
was investigated by measuring the sequence coverage of each
contig and identifying a possible correlation with their length.
As suspected, the contigs with highest coverage are also the
smallest. Specifically, all contigs with a coverage over 200×
are smaller than 300 bp, suggesting these are highly repetitive (Additional data file 6).
The presence of repeated elements was also investigated
among all contigs. A total of 74 O. bayeri contigs harbor DNA
segments homologous to known fungal repeated elements
(Additional data file 7). The Mariner, Gypsy and Copia classes
of repeated elements are the most frequently observed in O.
bayeri. The O. bayeri contigs also display DNA strings that
are repeated in tandem, with strings repeated at least twice
identified in 1,345 contigs (data not shown). However, these
tandem repeats are usually short and rarely exceed ten consecutive repeated strings. Putative stem-loop structures with

Discussion
Architecture of a large microsporidian genome
The currently available microsporidian genomes best represent the lower limits in the spectrum of genome sizes, not only
for Eukaryotes as a whole, but also microsporidia. The single
exception to this is N. ceranea, whose genome is more inter-

mediate in size, but our knowledge of microsporidian
genomes is still strongly biased, which might hinder the elucidation of the evolution of this poorly understood group. Our
present survey of the O. bayeri genome is the first deep survey of a larger microsporidian genome, and estimates from
sequence coverage suggest it may even be the largest known
microsporidian genome (at 24 MB). What accounts for this
variation in genome size and which features of microsporidian genomes have to be reconsidered after adding a genome
from the other end of the genome size spectrum? There are
several answers to these questions.

Genomes might be larger due to the presence of more genes,
which could be due to whole or partial genome duplications,
repetitive sequences, expansion of gene families, or the retention of a greater diversity of genes in general. They might also
have about the same complement of genes but have larger
intergenic regions, more or larger introns, more transposable
elements, and so on. Previous small-scale surveys of microsporidia with larger genomes have demonstrated a higher
proportion of non-coding DNA, but reveal nothing about the
overall organization of the genome because the fragments
sampled were small and only a tiny fraction of the genome
was characterized in any one case [35,36,38]. The data presented here provide additional evidence that large microsporidian genomes have a very low gene density, in this case
up to a fivefold decrease compared to species with smaller
genomes, but also provide information on the organization
and structure of a large genome in this group. [25,32-34].
First, gene density is not homogeneous across the genome,
but is instead a sum of long stretches (5.5 kb) of non-coding
sequences, as well as regions where genes are separated by

only 45 bp, which is even shorter than most intergenic regions
found in Enc. cuniculi, Ent. bieneusi and A. locustae. Second,
it now seems obvious that gene density alone accounts for
most of the variation in genome size between different microsporidian species, although we did find numerous genes in O.
bayeri that are absent in Enc. cuniculi (see below).
Smaller microsporidian genomes have also been noted as
sharing a high conservation of gene order across distantly
related species, which has been attributed to compaction
[31,32,34]. Despite the overall low gene density, we found 8%
of all annotated gene pairs (equating to 2 out of 24 gene pairs)
were conserved in order between O. bayeri and Enc. cuniculi.
This is not very different to what is found in other microsporidia [31,32], and close to the expectation for closely
related fungi [47]. It is interesting that both cases described
here involve pairs of genes that are unusually close to one
another (423 and 15 bp apart). This may reflect the role of
compaction in conservation of gene order, but it might also be
a sampling bias since closely spaced genes are more likely to

be found on the same contig in our survey, which is based on
contigs, rather than a complete genome.
The large size of the O. bayeri genome does not reflect extensive and segmental gene duplication. However, numerous
non-coding and small genomic repetitions could have played
a role in its expansion. The origin of these repetitive regions
is difficult to assess without a better genome assembly.
Because these do not encode known functional proteins, nor
harbor potential ORFs, however, it is possible that these represent telomeric and sub-telomeric regions of the O. bayeri
genome. If this is the case, genome size variation in microsporidia could also be a consequence of variation in the size of
telomeres. This prediction is supported by the recent acquisition in our laboratory of genome data from other, much
smaller genomes, showing that the vast majority of unassembled Illumina™ reads belong indeed to telomeric regions
(NC, JFP and PJK, unpublished).

Length of microsporidian genes and size of the protein
network
Microsporidian proteins are known to be shorter in general
than orthologs in other organisms, a characteristic that has
been attributed to the reduction in gene content and, by
extension, protein networks in these cells [25,48]. In keeping
with this, the majority of the O. bayeri proteins are shorter
than orthologs from S. cerevisiae (approximately 5,570
genes, size 12 Mb), Ustilago maydis (approximately 6,500
genes, 20 Mb genome), Batrachytridium dendrobatidis
(approximately 8,700 genes, 24 Mb genome) and Rhizopus
oryzae (approximately 17,459 genes, 35 Mb genome). Interestingly, however, O. bayeri proteins are also larger than
orthologues found in Enc. cuniculi and Ent. bieneusi. Consequently, the O. bayeri genome provides additional evidence
that microsporidian proteins are shorter than their homologs
from other fungal phyla, but also that their size correlates better with the coding capacity rather than the size of the genome
in which they are found.

Evidence for the progressive loss of ancestral genes
throughout the evolution of the microsporidian lineage
Prior to this study, the vast majority of genes with predicted
functions found in diverse microsporidia were also found in
Enc. cuniculi [32-36,38]. Three exceptions were found in A.
locustae [49-51] and a single one was found in Ent. bieneusi
[33]. This suggested that all members of this group share a
common core set of genes that have been retained after massive gene losses occurred in their ancestor, resulting in only a
small degree of variability in gene content. This prediction
was based, however, on a very low coverage for two large
microsporidian genomes [38]. The O. bayeri genome and its
evolutionary position within the group suggest that perhaps
early microsporidians possessed many more genes with predicted functions than previously thought. It now seems likely
that there was a large reduction in the ancestral proteome following the origin of microsporidia, but this was also followed

Volume 10, Issue 10, Article R106

Corradi et al. R106.8

by lineage-specific reductions and expansions in some
branches of the microsporidian tree. The total number of
ORFs identified in O. bayeri also suggests an overall coding
capacity that is at least 10% larger than that of Enc. cuniculi.
This is a conservative estimate based on the annotation of O.
bayeri hypothetical proteins of at least 200 amino acids.
Since it is known that Enc. cuniculi proteins shorter than 200
amino acids make up over a quarter of its total coding capacity [25], the overall coding capacity of O. bayeri is almost certainly greater still. It has been suggested that both N. ceranae
and Enc. bieneusi genomes contain genes that are absent in
Enc. cuniculi; however, the novel sequences in these genomes
are apparently all hypothetical ORFs or transposable-like elements, and not genes with predicted functions. In these cases
we cannot rule out that these are rapidly evolving genes with
unrecognized homologues in other microsporidian genomes,
or in some cases are not functional genes at all. In contrast,
the genome of O. bayeri contains at least 80 genes with predicted functions and recognizable homologues in other
organisms, but which are absent in Enc. cuniculi. This confirms that the proteome complexity of the ancestral microsporidian was greater than that seen in Enc. cuniculi (and
other current taxa for which genome level surveys have been
conducted to date), and suggests that further genome
sequencing, especially of putatively deep-branching taxa,
should reveal still more genes previously unseen in microsporidia. It is also formally possible that many genes were
acquired relatively recently in the lineage leading to O. bayeri
by lateral gene transfer, which has indeed been observed in
other microsporidia [49]. However, this does not seem likely
for all these genes given the rarity of transferred genes in
other microsporidia, and especially given that the most highly
conserved cases are all notably similar to homologs in fungi,
suggesting they are more likely ancestral to the microsporidia. This implies that much more proteome diversity
awaits discovery as more microsporidian genomes are characterized.

Functional importance of O. bayeri proteins absent in
other microsporidia
Perhaps the most intriguing finding of the present study is the
identification of 80 O. bayeri proteins sharing homology with
eukaryotes but not with Enc. cuniculi. Not surprisingly, these
include eight transposable elements, some of which showed a
high similarity to those reported from Nosema bombycis
[52]. Transposable elements are absent in the most reduced
microsporidian genomes [25,33], but are commonly reported
in the ones that are larger and less compact [34,37,38,52], so
in this case our study simply corroborates previous findings.
The remainder of these eukaryotic proteins stood out for
being involved in important functional processes. In total, 14
are involved in transcriptional processes, including RNA
polymerases or proteins involved in the transcription of
tRNAs, while 19 are part of different metabolic pathways such
as the metabolism of fatty acids and lipids and nucleotide

metabolism. A whole set of proteins involved in the modification of proteins and three cation transporters are also present
in O. bayeri but absent in Enc. cuniculi. The identification of
these eukaryotic proteins is important as it shows that the O.
bayeri proteome is more complex than that of Enc. cuniculi
or Ent. bieneusi. Moreover, most of these proteins have highest similarities with homolgs from fungal lineages, suggesting
they arose through common descent rather than by their
recent incorporation into the genome by lateral gene transfer.

sporidia, then the ancestral genome of microsporidia was
almost certainly large, complex, and encoded few transporters. Certainly, genome surveys of other basal representatives
of the group such as Glugea plecoglossi or Trachipleistophora hominis would provide decisive evidence in support or
against the evolution of reduced microsporidian genomes
from larger and complex relatives. This certainly warrants
further need for investigating the genomics of these highly
adapted and successful parasites.

Do O. bayeri protein categories reflect a lesser host
dependency?

Conclusions

Aside from the set of O. bayeri proteins that are absent in
Enc. cuniculi, the overall number of proteins with assigned
functions is generally similar in the two genomes. This does
not imply that both species encode the same set of identifiable
eukaryotic homologs and, indeed, we observed several differences in the functional distribution of their proteins. For
instance, genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism
are at least 25% more common in O. bayeri than in Enc.
cuniculi or Ent. bieneusi. Similarly, O. bayeri harbors two
additional genes involved in energy production compared to
Enc. cuniculi, a trehalose synthase and an alternative oxidase.O. bayeri also harbors almost twice the number of proteins involved in glycosylation compared to Enc. cuniculi,
suggesting a greater capacity to modify proteins, and perhaps
the presence of a less simplified endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi apparatus compared to other microsporidia [3].
The presence of a larger number of genes for metabolic and
energy generating proteins in O. bayeri does not by itself necessarily mean that this species is less dependent on its host for
energy than are other microsporidia; however, we also
observed a marked underrepresentation of proteins involved
in stealing metabolites from the host. At the extreme, only
one-quarter of the ATP transporters present in other microsporidia and around half of the Enc. cuniculi homologs of
amino acid and sugar transporters were found in O. bayeri.
Octosporea also appears to harbor a reduced set of ABC
transporters compared to both Enc. cuniculi and Ent.
bieneusi. Taken together, this implies that O. bayeri has a
broader metabolic repertoire than other microsporidia while
at the same time a reduced capability to derive metabolic
products and energy from its host, both of which suggest it is
less host-dependent than other microsporidia with smaller
genomes.
The phylogenetic placement of O. bayeri is also consistent
with the idea that host dependency evolved hand in hand with
reduction in genome size and hyper-adaptation for intracellular parasitism. Indeed, O. bayeri clusters at a basal position in
the microsporidian phylogeny, in the proximity of other species characterized by large genomes, and the only ATP transporter identified from this species was also found to be a basal
representative of the gene family. If both phylogenies depict
the correct evolutionary relationships within the micro-

Not all microsporida are characterized by small and highly
reduced genomes. Here we demonstrate that the proteome
complexity can vary greatly across the different species of the
group, and that a larger genome size could be a good predictor
of increased genomic complexity and reduced host dependency in microsporidia.
Since a microsporidian genome has now been surveyed with
454™ (N. ceranae [34]) and Illumina™ sequencing technology (this study), it might be interesting to compare the
results. The 454™ de novo genome assembly of N. ceranae
[34] resulted in lower overall sequence coverage, but an
assembly of larger contigs, on average, due to the longer
sequence reads. However, the Illumina™ methodology used
to survey O. bayeri required substantially less high molecular
weight DNA - in our case only 100 ng of sheared DNA. The
downside of very short reads (35 bp) was mostly offset by the
deep sequence coverage, allowing a detailed analysis of the
coding capacity of the O. bayeri genome, but not of its structure (for example, conservation of gene order). Moreover, the
small quantity of DNA required opens the door to genomic
analyses from a broad range of uncultivatable organisms
from which only a handful of contaminant-free DNA can be
extracted.
Finally, an important goal of the present study was to gather
a large amount of genome sequence information from O. bayeri so that it may complement the soon-to-be annotated
genome of its exclusive host, the crustacean D. magna. These
two species represent an excellent and well-recognized model
to study host-parasite interactions [41]. The complementary
nature of both genomic datasets will therefore form a great
study system and provide a unique opportunity to further
expand this specific field of evolutionary ecology into the
post-genomic era

Materials and methods
DNA and RNA extraction and DNA sequencing
Total RNA and genomic DNA from O. bayeri (isolate OER 33 from the Island Oeren in the Tvärminne archipelago, southwestern Finland) were obtained from purified spores isolated
from a laboratory culture of infected D. magna hosts (University of Basel, Switzerland). A total of 100 ng of genomic DNA

was sequenced with single and paired-end 35-bp reads on the
Illumina™ Genome Analyzer from Solexa (San Diego, CA,
USA) by FASTERIS SA (Geneva, Switzerland). Reads were
assembled using EDENA version 2.1.1, Velvet version 0.6.03
and ELAND version GAPipeline-1.0rc4 programs. This whole
genome shotgun project has been deposited at GenBank
under project accession [GenBank:ACSZ00000000]. The
version described in this paper is the first version [Genbank:ACSZ01000000].

Identification of O. bayeri homologs present in the Enc.
cuniculi genome
The O. bayeri homologs that are present in the Enc. cuniculi
genome were identified by BLAST homology searches [53]
against the complete Enc. cuniculi genome using the NCBI
BLASTALL suite. First, TBLASTX searches were performed
under a cutoff E-value (E  1E-10) against our local Enc.
cuniculi database, then the Enc. cuniculi genes that were not
found in O. bayeri were searched for using TBLASTX against
the O. bayeri contigs. The O. bayeri tRNAs and tRNA introns
identified using tRNAscan-SE and default parameters [54]
were searched for in the Enc. cuniculi genome manually.

Identification of O. bayeri eukaryotic homologs that are
absent in Enc. cuniculi
The contigs sharing no similarities in TBLASTX searches (E >
1E-3) with the Enc. cuniculi genome have been annotated for
potential ORFs using the program GETORF from the
EMBOSS package [55]. Eukaryotic homologs were identified
by BLASTP searches (E  1E-10) against a local copy of the
NCBI non-redundant database using the NCBI BLASTALL
suite. Following the BLASTP procedure, TBLASTX searches
on contigs harboring ORFs that retrieved significant BLASTP
hits were performed for further validation. The resulting
ORFs were assigned to functional categories using the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [56], Pfam [57],
and UniProt [58] databases (Additional data file 2).

Identification of putative O. bayeri-specific hypothetical
proteins
ORFs of at least 200 amino acids that did not retrieve significant homology in BLAST searches against the Enc. cuniculi
genome or the NCBI non-redundant database were queried
against the genome survey of A. locustae [59] using TBLASTP
searches (E  1E-10) to identify potential hypothetical proteins of microsporidian origin. Potential functions for these
ORFs were also searched for using the KEGG [56], Pfam [57],
and UniProt [58] databases. ORFs of at least 200 amino acids
that showed no homology in any of these searches were considered O. bayeri-specific putative proteins.

Phylogenetic reconstruction
A total of 13 - and -tubulin amino acid sequences have been
identified from a range of microsporidian species and used to
reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships, as they represent the most conserved and widely sampled proteins within

Volume 10, Issue 10, Article R106

Corradi et al. R106.10

the group and have been successfully used in the past for similar purposes [42]. Ent. bieneusi tubulins have been discarded
from the present phylogeny because of their extreme amino
acid divergence, resulting in its unsupported positioning
within the tree and in an overall reduction in the statistical
support for all other phylogenetic clades. Two zygomycetes
have been used as outgroups as this phylum has been proposed to represent the most recent fungal common ancestor
of microsporidia [20,22]. The - and -tubulin amino acid
sequences were aligned using Muscle v3.7 [60] and the most
conserved regions selected using Gblocks 0.91b [61]. The
microsporidia phylogeny was reconstructed using concatenated - and -tubulin amino acid sequences and MrBayes v
3.1.2 [62] with six General Time Reversible (GTR) types of
substitutions, Dayoff acid substitution model and invariable
plus gamma rate variations across sites. The Markov chain
Monte Carlo search was run for 10,000 generations, sampling
the Markov chain every 10 generations, and 250 were discarded as 'burn-in'. The relationships among microsporidia
ATP transporters were studied in parallel using amino acid
sequences retrieved from public databases and the parameters explained above.

Introns, gene density, and gene length
The O. bayeri ORFs with assigned functions were screened
for potential frameshit mutations caused by the potential
presence of introns, with introns previously reported in Enc.
cuniculi [25] searched for manually. Gene density in the O.
bayeri genome was determined by annotating ORFs of at
least 100 amino acids along the 200 largest contigs used in
this study. A number of complete O. bayeri proteins have
been compared against orthologs from Enc. cuniculi, Ent.
bieneusi, S. cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, U. maydis, B.
dendrobatidis and R. oryzae to identify the presence of significant differences in gene length. O. bayeri-specific inserts
in otherwise highly conserved proteins were screened for by
visual inspection of BLAST search results, compared with
orthologs using MEGA 4 [63], and their presence in mRNAs
confirmed by RT-PCR. Locations of the O. bayeri-specific
inserts on the corresponding protein three-dimensional
structures were determined using SwissPDB-viewer and
QuickPDB from the RSCB Protein Data Bank for available
structures.

Repeated elements
DNA regions in the O. bayeri contigs showing homology with
fungal repeated elements were identified with CENSOR [64]
from the Genetic Information Research Institute webserver.
Repeated elements arrayed in tandem in the O. bayeri contigs
were determined with Tandem Repeat Finder 4.03 [65] using
a match/mismatch/indel ratio of 2/7/7 and a minimum score
of 50. Putative stem-loop structures in the O. bayeri contigs
were screened for with PALINDROME from the EMBOSS
package using a minimum stem length of 10 and a maximum
loop length of 4.
