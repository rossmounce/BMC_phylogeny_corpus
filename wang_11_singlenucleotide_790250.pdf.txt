Single-nucleotide resolution analysis of the
transcriptome structure of Clostridium beijerinckii
NCIMB 8052 using RNA-Seq
Yi Wang1,2, Xiangzhen Li3, Yuejian Mao3 and Hans P Blaschek2,4,5*

Abstract
Background: Clostridium beijerinckii is an important solvent producing microorganism. The genome of C. beijerinckii
NCIMB 8052 has recently been sequenced. Although transcriptome structure is important in order to reveal the
functional and regulatory architecture of the genome, the physical structure of transcriptome for this strain, such as
the operon linkages and transcript boundaries are not well understood.
Results: In this study, we conducted a single-nucleotide resolution analysis of the C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052
transcriptome using high-throughput RNA-Seq technology. We identified the transcription start sites and operon
structure throughout the genome. We confirmed the structure of important gene operons involved in metabolic
pathways for acid and solvent production in C. beijerinckii 8052, including pta-ack, ptb-buk, hbd-etfA-etfB-crt (bcs)
and ald-ctfA-ctfB-adc (sol) operons; we also defined important operons related to chemotaxis/motility,
transcriptional regulation, stress response and fatty acids biosynthesis along with others. We discovered 20
previously non-annotated regions with significant transcriptional activities and 15 genes whose translation start
codons were likely mis-annotated. As a consequence, the accuracy of existing genome annotation was significantly
enhanced. Furthermore, we identified 78 putative silent genes and 177 putative housekeeping genes based on
normalized transcription measurement with the sequence data. We also observed that more than 30% of
pseudogenes had significant transcriptional activities during the fermentation process. Strong correlations exist
between the expression values derived from RNA-Seq analysis and microarray data or qRT-PCR results.
Conclusions: Transcriptome structural profiling in this research provided important supplemental information on
the accuracy of genome annotation, and revealed additional gene functions and regulation in C. beijerinckii.

Background
Solvents such as acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE) produced through microbial fermentation represent important
potential renewable fuels and chemicals [1]. Clostridium
acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii are among the prominent solvent-producing species. Although C. beijerinckii is
phenotypically similar to C. acetobutylicum, the saccharolytic strains are phylogenetically distant from the amylolytic
C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 type strain [2]. C. beijerinckii
exhibits a broader substrate range and optimum pH for
growth and solvent production [3]; thus it may have

greater potential for biosolvent production than
C. acetobutylicum.
The genome of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 was
sequenced by the DOE Joint Genome Institute in 2007
(JGI project ID 3634512). The genome size is 6.0 Mb,
which is 50% larger than that of C. acetobutylicum ATCC
824. The C. beijerinckii 8052 solvent-producing genes are
all located on the chromosome, as opposed to the location
of these genes on a mega-plasmid in C. acetobutylicum
824. Although transcriptome structural organization is
important in order to reveal the functional and regulatory
architecture of the genome, such annotation for the C. beijerinckii 8052 genome is far from complete. Current genome annotation was made by computational analysis
based on gene prediction algorithms. Although this allows
for the determination of the complete set of gene loci and

intergenic regions of the genome, it does not provide sufficient information concerning the transcriptional organization on a genome-wide level. For example, transcriptome
structures such as operon linkages and transcript boundaries, etc. are not well understood and lack confirmation
with experimental approaches. Next-generation highthroughput sequencing technology enabled us to obtain
millions of cDNA reads simultaneously. In RNA-Seq analysis, these reads can be assembled against the genome
sequence, and expression values calculated based on the
reads mapped to genes. Deep sequencing of cDNA pool
allowed us to study the bacterial transcriptome structure
and gene expression at an unprecedented resolution and
depth [4-8]. In this study, we used RNA-Seq technology to
investigate C. beijerinckii 8052 transcriptome structure at
a single-nucleotide resolution. We identified the transcription start sites and operon structure throughout the
genome. We confirmed the structure of important gene
operons involved in metabolic pathways for acid and
solvent production in C. beijerinckii 8052. We defined
important operons related to chemotaxis/motility, transcriptional regulation, stress response and fatty acids biosynthesis. We discovered 20 previously non-annotated
regions with significant transcriptional activities and 15
genes whose translation start codons were likely misannotated. The results from this study significantly
enhanced the accuracy of current genome annotation, and
provided an essential reference point for other researchers
working in related fields.

Results and discussion
Growth kinetics and ABE fermentation

C. beijerinckii 8052 grew rapidly with a very short lag
phase in the batch fermentation with P2 medium supplemented with yeast extract and glucose (Figure 1A). The
fermentation experienced a shift from acidogenesis to
solventogenesis at approximately 4.5-8 h. Formation of
solvents was detected at between 4.5-6.5 h after the start
of fermentation, which corresponded to the late exponential growth phase. Butanol continued to increase
throughout the stationary phase (Figure 1B). Samples for
RNA isolation were collected at time points during acidogenesis (2 and 4.5 h) and solventogenesis (after 6.5 h)
(Figure 1A). The combined information from these samples collected at different growth phases is representative
for transcriptome structural analysis.
Transcriptome definition and structure

The 75-nt cDNA reads were mapped to the C. beijerinckii
8052 genome. Only those reads that mapped unambiguously to the genome were used for further analyses
(Table 1). Collectively, around 75.5% of the C. beijerinckii
8052 genome was transcribed in at least one sample, even
though the fraction in each single sample was much less.

The sequence coverage per base was plotted and visualized using the genome browser Artemis and DNAPlotter
[5,9,10] (Additional file 1 Figure S1). The sequence coverage of the genes (based on number of mapped reads) for
different samples was observed to be different in the overall sequence coverage profiles, which might be a reflection
of the physiological states as the cell transited from one
growth phase to another. For example, sample 2 represented a time period that was at the beginning of the transition from acidogenesis to solventogenesis. In this sample,
genes encoding butyrate kinase (buk, 233080-234147 nt;
Gene ID is listed in Additional file 2 Table S1, similarly
hereinafter), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (thl,499121500302 nt), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(gap, 710763-711764 nt), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
(fba, 2199060-2199926 nt), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ald,
4399026-4400432 nt), acetoacetate decarboxylase (adc,
4401916-4402656 nt) were all actively expressed (high
peaks in Additional file 1 Figure S1). These genes are
involved in acid and butyryl-CoA formation, solventogenesis and glycolysis. The time frame of sample 4 was consistent with the transition to non-active growth and
clostridial spores formation. In this sample, genes encoding stage V sporulation protein T (spoVT, 115288-115836
nt), spore coat protein cotJC (cotJC, 2411617-2412183 nt),

spore coat peptide assembly protein cotJB (cotJB, 24121902412453 nt), small acid-soluble spore protein, sspA (sspA,
3596975-3597184 nt), small acid-soluble spore protein,
sspC2 (sspC2, 3814296-3814505 nt) were actively
expressed among others (Additional file 1 Figure S1).
These genes are involved in the regulation of spore coat
assembly and other sporulation-related processes [11,12].
These results were in good agreement with our previous
observation using a 500-gene set DNA microarray [13]. A
more detailed genome-wide transcriptional analysis of
C. beijerinckii 8052 during the shift from acidogenesis to
solventogenesis is currently underway in our lab.
The distinct transcript boundaries and multigene
operon structure in a genome are essential for elucidating a genome’s regulatory mechanisms. Through transcriptome profiling analysis, the transcript boundaries
and operon structures were identified across the entire
C. beijerinckii 8052 genome (Additional file 3 Table S2).
Of all the > 5000 genes, 2151 genes (42.2%) were determined as being parts of multi-gene operon structures.
The largest number of genes in a single operon was 32
(ribosomal proteins operon, Cbei_0150-0181, 192128207934 nt). A refined genome annotation file (in GenBank format) was generated (Additional file 4) based on
the findings from this work and the current C. beijerinckii 8052 genome annotation in NCBI. The GenBank
file can also be downloaded from https://netfiles.uiuc.
edu/blaschek/www/Wang-BMC2011.
In addition, 5’-untranslated regions (5’-UTRs) were
determined at the same time. Similar to other bacteria
[4,14], most of the identified 5’-UTRs were very short.
Among all the 1605 5’-UTRs that were estimated with
high confidence (that is, valid 5’-UTRs identified in the 6
samples with a ≤ 50 nt window), 1262 were ≤ 50 nt, and
only 65 were ≥ 100 nt (Additional file 5 Table S3). RibEx
[15] was used to test for the putative regulatory elements
among the 5’-UTRs over 100 bp. Three Predicted Riboswitch-like Elements (do not belong to any Rfam [16]; yet
present very significant associations with either a COG
or a KEGG pathway) were found in the 5’-UTRs of

Cbei_0465, Cbei_1518 and Cbei_3542, respectively. In
addition, a Known Riboswitch-like Element (flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch) was found in the 5’-UTR
of Cbei_1224. More details about the identified putative
riboswitches were described in Additional file 6 Table S4.
Previously, an operon containing genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap), phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) and triosephosphate isomerase
(tpi) was revealed by transcriptional analyses for C. acetobutylicum, while the gene encoding phosphoglycerate
mutase (pgm) was identified as not a member of this
operon [17]. In this study, employing the single-nucleotide resolution sequence data, a similar gap-pgk-tpi
operon was observed, upstream and apart from pgm for
C. beijerinckii 8052. In addition, it is very interesting
that the upstream gene Cbei_0596 was also found to be
linked with this operon (Figure 2A), which was validated
by end-point RT-PCR as discussed below (Additional
file 7 Figure S2 and Additional file 8 Table S5). The
upstream gene (CA_C0708) of gap in C. acetobutylicum
824 genome is conjectured to be the counterpart of
Cbei_0596 in C. beijerinckii 8052, since they both
encode putative transcriptional regulator proteins and
share 64% sequence identity. However, the intergenic
distance between CA_C0708 and CA_C0709 in C. acetobutylicum 824 genome is 146 nt, while that between
Cbei_0596 and Cbei_0597 in C. beijerinckii 8052 genome is only 71 nt. Although Cbei_0596-0599 are organized in the same operon, the sequence coverage depth
downstream of gap was unexpectedly lower than that of
the anterior (Figure 2A). An intrinsic terminator was
predicted adjacent and downstream of gap (711818711852 nt) using the bacterial genome transcription
terminator prediction software TransTerm [18]. The terminator may have played a key role in attenuating the
transcription of the downstream genes in this operon.
Further experiments need to be carried out to confirm
the activity and function of this element.

dehydrogenase (hbd), crotonase (crt), and butyryl-CoA
dehydrogenase (bcd) were identified as a bcs (butyrylCoA synthesis) operon in the order of crt-bcd-etfB
(encoding electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta)etfA (encoding electron transfer flavoprotein subunit
alpha)-hbd [19,20]. A homologous operon structure
was observed for C. beijerinckii 8052 (Cbei_0321-0325)
transcribed in the same order but the opposite direction (Additional file 3 Table S2). In addition, based on
the sequencing data, similar pfk (phosphofructokinase)pyk (pyruvate kinase), pta (phosphotransacetylase)-ack
(acetate kinase), ptb (phosphate butyryltransferase)-buk
gene operons were identified in C. beijerinckii 8052 as
those described in C. acetobutylicum 824 [21-23]
(Additional file 3 Table S2). Among them, ptb-buk
operon was also verified by end-point RT-PCR experiment as discussed below (Additional file 7 Figure S2
and Additional file 8 Table S5).
Nearly all the genes encoding solventogenic enzymes
have been cloned and characterized in C. acetobutylicum

Page 4 of 10

[24]. In C. acetobutylicum 824, the genes adhE (acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase), ctfA (acetoacetylCoA: acetate/butyrate-CoA transferase subunit A) and
ctfB (acetoacetyl-CoA: acetate/butyrate-CoA transferase
subunit B) are located in the sol (solvent formation)
operon on the mega-plasmid pSOL1 whose loss leads to
the degeneration of the strain [25], while adc (acetoacetate decarboxylase) is organized in a monocistronic
operon in the opposite direction [26,27]. In this study, a
sol operon organized in the order of ald-ctfA-ctfB-adc
was observed (Figure 2B and Additional file 3 Table S2).
Previously, Chen and Blaschek (1999) speculated that
the ald, ctfA, ctfB and adc genes were located in an
operon following a Northern hybridization analysis of
C. beijerinckii 8052 total RNA [28]. With direct sequencing data, this study successfully confirmed the above
hypothesis, and identified the transcriptional start sites
(TSS) upstream of ald gene. This solventogenic gene
arrangement in C. beijerinckii 8052 is consistent with
that observed in C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 and C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 [29,30].
A flagellar/chemotaxis gene operon (CA_C2225-C2215)
was previously defined in C. acetobutylicum [31]; a counterpart organized in exactly the same order (Cbei_43124302) in C. beijerinckii 8052 was observed in this study
(Additional file 3 Table S2). Similarly to C. acetobutylicum
824, the transcriptional regulator sigF operon was also
confirmed in C. beijerinckii 8052 with the sequencing data
that includes the forespore-specific sigma factor gene sigF,
the anti-sigF factor gene spoIIAB, and the anti-anti-sigF
factor gene spoIIAA (Additional file 3 Table S2). In Bacillus subtilis and C. acetobutylicum, the class I heat shock
genes are organized in dnaKJ (organized in the order of
hrcA-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ in C. acetobutylicum 824) and
groESL (groES-groEL) operons [32,33]. The similar organization of dnaKJ and groESL operons for C. beijerinckii
8052 was also observed in this study (Additional file 3
Table S2). The fatty acid biosynthesis genes are organized
in a single fab operon in C. acetobutylicum (CA_C3568C3580) [34], while in this study, the fab genes (Cbei_10671077) in C. beijerinckii 8052 were observed to be
organized in four operons, which is similar to those of
B. subtilis [35] (Additional file 3 Table S2).
While the current C. beijerinckii 8052 genome was
annotated based on bioinformatical predictions, the RNASeq sequencing approach provides additional experimental
evidence for genome annotation. By comparing the
sequence coverage data to the genome annotation, 20
non-annotated regions were found to have significant
transcriptional activities (Figure 3A, see also the supplemental texts in Additional file 9). These regions may
represent potential new genes or regulatory RNAs. Twelve
potential new genes were predicted in these regions using
GeneMark [36]. Additional details about this test and the

more during the course of a batch fermentation. Besides,
several genes encoding the subunits (such as soborsespecific subunits, lactose/cellobiose-specific subunits) of
phosphotransferase system (PTS) related to the transport of sugars other than glucose were also among the
list of silent genes. Since glucose was the only carbohydrate used in this study, these enzymes were not
induced during the fermentation process.
Putative housekeeping genes (HKGs)

the genome allows the test of current C. beijerinckii 8052
genome annotation. (A) Sequence coverage in the Cbei_42064207 region, showing transcription activity across a region not

predicted genes were summarized in Additional file 10
Table S6.
In addition, 15 transcripts were identified with TSS
that are downstream of the current annotated translation start sites (Figure 3B, see also the supplemental
texts in Additional file 9). For these regions, re-annotation is needed since the current start codons may have
been mis-annotated.
Putative silent genes

Based on RNA-Seq sequence data, 78 protein-encoding
genes demonstrated no transcripts over all six sampling
time points, and these genes are likely silent (Additional
file 11 Table S7). Thirty-one out of them were genes
encoding hypothetical proteins. In addition, half of the
genes encoding transposases (14 out of the total 29 in
the genome) were silent. Although transposases may
have played important roles during the evolution of
C. beijerinckii, most of them are not as functional any

Some genes have little variation in expression level
through the entire fermentation process, and they are
regarded as putative housekeeping genes (HKGs). For
accurate gene expression quantification, normalization of
gene expression against HKGs (endogenous control or
reference gene) is generally required. In this study, 177
protein-coding genes were identified as putative HKGs
with the lowest coefficient of variation (CV) in RPKM
(see Methods section) values among all the sampling
points (CV = standard deviation/mean; < 30% for listed
genes in Additional file 12 Table S8) [37]. A COG functional group analysis by Fisher’s exact test found that
COG functional category D (Cell cycle control, mitosis
and meiosis, 10.3%), L (Replication, recombination and
repair, 9.2%) and E (Amino acid transport and metabolism, 6.6%) were overrepresented in this list [37,38]. This
list of putative HKGs was generated based on the transcription data obtained from the six samples under the
certain batch fermentation conditions employed in this
study. This list can be considered as a starting point for
identifying HKGs for C. beijerinckii. However, whether
these genes are stably expressed under different experimental conditions requires further study.
A prediction of the promoters for primary sigma factors for all the putative HKGs was carried out using
BPROM (http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml). In
total, 88 promoters along with their corresponding -10
box and -35 box sequences were predicted (Additional
file 12 Table S8).
Pseudogenes

Pseudogenes in bacteria genomes are non-functional
copies of gene fragments usually created by random
mutations and chance events [39,40]. Although pseudogenes are usually non-functional, it has been reported
that quite a few of them can still go through the transcription process [41-43]. In this study, 26 out of the 82
pseudogenes in C. beijerinckii 8052 genome were found
to have significant transcriptional activities over the
course of fermentation (Additional file 13 Table S9).
However, although globally the 82 pseudogenes comprise
about 0.6% of the predicted CDS of the genome, only <
0.1% of all the RNA-Seq reads mapped to these genes,

Wang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:479
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/479

indicating a significantly lower transcriptional activity
when compared to the regular protein coding genes.
In addition, six pseudogenes were found to be completely
silent throughout the fermentation process (Additional
file 13 Table S9). This is overrepresented among the
silent genes when compared to the protein-coding genes
based on a Fisher’s exact test (p = 0.0015).
When pseudogenes share high sequence identity with
other functional genes in the genome, it is usually on
one hand very difficult to design probes to detect the
transcription of pseudogenes with traditional methods,
and on the other pseudogenes can lead to amplification
bias during genetic studies of the functional genes with
high sequence identity to pseudogenes [42]. Apparently
such problems can be avoided with RNA-Seq method,
which is one of the unprecedented advantages of RNASeq technique.
For summarization and easy reference to the readers, a
table (Additional file 14 Table S10) summarizing the various supplementary information provided by RNA-Seq
study to the current genome annotation was listed in the
supplemental materials.
End-point RT-PCR

End-point RT-PCR was used to validate the operon structure results obtained from RNA-Seq analysis [4]. One
gene pair that is highly likely to be co-operonic with an
intergenic distance of 7 bp was chosen as a positive control (Cbei_0341-0342). Ten other gene pairs with long
intergenic distances (71-440 bp) where there were high
transcription levels were chosen. All the operon structures
determined by sequence data in the chosen gene pairs
were confirmed by end-point RT-PCR results, indicating
that RNA-Seq is a valid approach for operon structure
identification (Additional file 7 Figure S2 and Additional
file 8 Table S5). Among them, the ptb-buk operon and the
linkage between Cbei_0596 and Cbei_0597 (gap) as discussed above were also confirmed.
Correlations of RNA-Seq data with microarray and qRTPCR data

The RNA-Seq data obtained in this study were compared
to the results obtained previously using a 500-gene set
DNA microarray [13]. A small number of genes that did
not allow for unambiguous mapping in RNA-Seq analysis
were not included in the comparison. A good correlation
was observed between the normalized coverage depth for
sample 2 (collected at 4.5 h) and the raw microarray fluorescence intensities for an equivalent sample (collected at
5 h under the same growth condition) (Figure 4A). Specifically, the gene expression patterns of glycolytic genes
Cbei_0597-0600 and sporulation genes Cbei_2069-2071
from samples 2 (4.5 h) and 4 (14 h) measured by

sequencing data were compared. Similar differential
expression patterns by microarray data from equivalent
samples (5 h vs. 13 h) were observed (Figure 5). Although
only a limited number of genes were compared, the good
correlation between two methods further demonstrated
the effectiveness of RNA-Seq approach. An additional
advantage of RNA-Seq is that the sequence data can measure expression levels for every gene without bias caused
by sequence-specific differences in hybridization efficiency
in microarray-based methods [4,44], and sequence data
allow one to measure gene expression more accurately
with a much higher dynamic range as indicated in this
study (Table 1) and other references [4,8,44,45].
The expression measurement with RNA-Seq data was
further validated using real time quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Twenty-five genes were
selected for the test (Additional file 13 Table S9). A
high degree of correlation (R = 0.959) between the
threshold value (Ct) and the log 2 -tranformation of
RPKM was observed (Figure 4B).

Methods
Bacterial culture and fermentation experiment

Figure 5 Comparison of transcriptional profiles for sample 2 (4.5
h, black line) and sample 4 (14 h, red line), normalized to the
gene length and genome-wide total number of unambiguously
mapped reads for that sample. Shown are an ~5.4 kb segment
surrounding the gap-pgk-tpi glycolytic gene operon (Cbei_0597-0600)
and an ~1.2 kb segment surrounding the cotJC-cotJB (Cbei_2069-2071)
sporulation gene operon. Specific genes are indicated with arrows,
whose colors indicate the COG functional class of genes as defined in
Additional file 1 Figure S1. Below each gene is the expression level fold
change that was measured by microarray data for equivalent samples
(5 h vs. 13 h in Shi and Blaschek [13]; microarray data for Cbei_2071
are not available).

Conclusions
A single-nucleotide resolution analysis of the C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 transcriptome structure was conducted using high-throughput RNA-Seq technology.
The transcription start sites and operon structures were
identified throughout the genome. The structure of
operons involved in metabolic pathways for acid and
solvent production in C. beijerinckii 8052 were confirmed. Important operons related to chemotaxis/motility, transcriptional regulation, stress response and fatty
acids biosynthesis along with others were defined.
Twenty previously non-annotated regions were discovered with significant transcriptional activities and 15
genes were identified whose translation start codons
were likely mis-annotated. As a consequence, the accuracy of existing genome annotation was significantly
enhanced. Moreover, 78 silent genes and 177 putative
housekeeping genes were identified based on normalized
transcription measurement with the sequence data.
More than 30% of the pseudogenes were observed to
have significant transcriptional activities during the fermentation process. Strong correlations exist between the
expression values derived from RNA-Seq analysis and
microarray data or qRT-PCR results. Transcriptome
structural profiling in this study provided important
supplemental information on the accuracy of annotation
of the C. beijerinckii genome.

Laboratory stocks of C. beijerinckii 8052 spores were
stored in sterile H 2 O at 4°C [46]. Spores were heatshocked at 80°C for 10 min, followed by cooling on ice
for 5 min. The heat-shocked spores were inoculated
into tryptone-glucose-yeast extract (TGY) medium containing 30 g L -1 tryptone, 20 g L -1 glucose, 10 g L -1
yeast extract and 1 g L-1 L-cysteine at a 1% inoculum
level. The TGY culture was incubated at 35 ± 1°C for
12-14 h in an anaerobic chamber under N 2 :CO 2 :H 2
(volume ratio of 85:10:5) atmosphere. Subsequently,
actively growing culture was inoculated into a model
solution containing 60 g L -1 glucose, 1 g L -1 yeast
extract, and filter-sterilized P2 medium [47,48] in a Sixfors bioreactor system (Infors AG, Bottmingen, Switzerland). Throughout the experiment, oxygen-free nitrogen
was flushed through the broth to maintain anaerobiosis.
Temperature was controlled at 35 ± 1°C. A stirring at
50 rpm was employed for mixing. During the course of
fermentation, samples were collected for cell density
and product concentration measurements. For sequencing purpose, RNA samples were taken over the early
exponential, late exponential and stationary phases
(sample 1-6 at 2, 4.5, 10, 14, 17 and 26.5 h respectively
as shown in Figure 1A).
Culture growth and fermentation products analysis

Culture growth was measured by following optical density
(OD) in the fermentation broth at A600 using a BioMate 5
UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Waltham, MA). ABE, acetic acid, and butyric acid concentrations were quantified using gas chromatography (GC)
system as previously described [49].
RNA isolation, library construction and sequencing

In preparation for RNA isolation, 10 ml cultures were harvested at six time points, and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for
10 min at 4°C. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellet using Trizol reagent based on manufacture’s protocol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and further purified using
RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA was
removed using a DNA-free™ kit (Ambion Inc., Austin,
TX). RNA quality was assessed using a nanochip on a
model 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA). RNA concentration was determined with a
nanodrop (Biotek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Bacterial
16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs were removed with a
MICROBExpress™ kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The
enriched mRNA was converted to a RNA-Seq library
using the mRNA-Seq library construction kit (Illumina
Inc., San Diego, CA) following manufacturer’s protocols.
For samples 1 to 6, two samples were pooled and

Wang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:479
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/479

sequenced on one single lane of an eight-lane flow cell
with the Genome Analyzer IIx system (Illumina Inc., San
Diego, CA). However, sample 6 yielded a poor read quality
following the first sequencing. In order to obtain enough
sequencing depth, sample 6 was sequenced again using
one single lane under otherwise identical conditions. The
derived sequence reads were 75 nt long. The overall error
rate of the control DNA was < 0.6%. The total number
of reads generated from each library is summarized in
Table 1.
Sequence mapping and visualization

The generated 75-nt reads were mapped to the C. beijerinckii 8052 genome using MAQ, and those that did not
align uniquely to the genome were discarded [5,50]. The
quality parameter (-q) used in MAQ pileup was set to 30.
Each base was assigned a value based on the number of
mapped sequence coverage. The coverage plot files were
read into Artemis and visualized as sequence coverage
profiles over the entire genome [5,9]. Transcription start
sites (TSS) were manually identified as described in Passalacqua et al. [4]. The region between determined TSS
and the annotated translation start site was defined as
the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR).
Measurement of gene expression

The quantitative gene expression value, RPKM (reads/Kb/
Million), was calculated using custom Perl scripts by normalizing the sequence coverage over the gene length and
total unambiguously mapped reads in each library [7,37].
End-point RT-PCR for operon structure assessment

End-point RT-PCR was performed as described in Passalacqua et al. [4]. For each selected co-operonic gene pair,
four primers 1F, 1R, 2F and 2R were designed. Primers 1F
and 1R amplify a region within gene 1, while 2F and 2R
amplify a region within gene 2. When a continuous transcript exists, 1F and 2R amplify across the intergenic
region between genes 1 and 2. Therefore, the size of the
end-point RT-PCR product will be the same using either
cDNA or genomic DNA as templates. The reaction products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels stained with
ethidium bromide.
