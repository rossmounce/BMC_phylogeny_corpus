Abstract
Background: Phosphorylation of eIF2α provides a key mechanism for down-regulating protein
synthesis in response to nutrient starvation or stresses in mammalian and yeast cells. However, this
process has not been well characterized in plants
Results: We show here that in response to amino acid and purine starvations, UV, cold shock and
wounding, the Arabidopsis GCN2 kinase (AtGCN2) is activated and phosphorylates eIF2α. We
show that AtGCN2 is essential for plant growth in stress situations and that its activity results in a
strong reduction in global protein synthesis.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that a general amino acid control response is conserved between
yeast and plants but that the plant enzyme evolved to fulfill a more general function as an upstream
sensor and regulator of diverse stress-response pathways. The activation of AtGCN2 following
wounding or exposure to methyl jasmonate, the ethylene precursor 1-Aminocyclopropane-1carboxylic acid (ACC) and salicylic acid, further suggests that this enzyme could play a role in plant
defense against insect herbivores.

Background

Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) provides a key mechanism
for down-regulating protein synthesis in response to
nutrient starvation or stresses [1,2]. Vertebrates use four
different eIF2α-kinases (PKR, PERK, HRI and GCN2) to
respond to various stresses, and typically one kinase has a

predominant role in response to a specific cellular stress
condition. For example, in mammals, GCN2 is the primary eIF2α-kinase in response to nutrient limitation [3],
PERK modulates gene expression in response to protein
misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [4], PKR
participates in an antiviral pathway mediated by interferon [5], and HRI couples protein synthesis (predomi-

nantly globin) to the availability of heme in the erythroid
cell lineage [6]. However, this specialization of function is
not complete and, for example, GCN2 is a secondary
eIF2α-kinase in response to ER stress in mouse [7].
Arthropods make a more or less specialized use of eIF2αkinases. The mosquito Anopheles gambiae has three distinct
enzymes (HRI, PERK and GCN2) while Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have only two (PERK
and GCN2) [8]. The situation is similar for fungi since
Schizosaccharomyces pombe has three enzymes (two distinct
HRI and a GCN2) while Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa have a single eIF2α-kinase (GCN2) [8].

a key but yet uncharacterized player linking biotic and
abiotic stresses.

Results and discussions

In plants, the lower dissociation constant of eIF2 for GDP
compared to yeast or mammals have led several years ago
to the assumption that plants do not use phosphorylation
of eIF2α as a mean to regulate translation [9]. Furthermore, the observation that starvation for aromatic or
branched amino acids did not initiate a general response
have also led to the suggestion that, in contrast to yeast,
such general amino acid response may not exist in plants
[10]. Therefore the physiological significance of eIF2α
phosphorylation in plants is largely unknown. More
recently, a GCN2-like enzyme (AtGCN2) has been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and was shown to restore the
growth of a yeast gcn2 mutant in the presence of an inhibitor of amino acids biosynthesis [11]. AtGCN2 was also
shown to be activated in plants by amino acid deprivation
conditions [12].

Arabidopsis and rice have a single eIF2α kinase
In addition to the presence of a GCN2 enzyme, higher
plants have been proposed to contain a double-stranded
RNA-dependent protein kinase with biochemical properties of the mammalian PKR [13-15]. Using the protein
kinase domain of the yeast and Arabidopsis GCN2 and of
the human PKR, PERK and HRI enzymes, we searched the
Arabidopsis genome for the presence of additional eIF2α
kinases. GCN2, PRK, PERK and HRI protein kinase
domains were used in a BLASTP analysis against the TAIR
8.0 Arabidopsis proteins http://www.arabidopsis.org and,
in each case, fifty proteins with the highest E value were
collected. Using this approach, we produced a list of 138
non-redundant kinases (out of the more than 1000 Arabidopsis kinases) that most closely resemble eIF2α kinases
(Additional file 1). Using a phylogenetic approach, we
compared these 138 kinase domains to yeast, human and
mouse eIF2α kinase domains. Two Arabidopsis kinases
were found to form a statistically significant cluster with
known eIF2α kinases (Additional file 1): one is AtGCN2
(AT3G59410) while the other is annotated as a Wee1-like
kinase (AT1G02970) [16]. To evaluate the capacity of the
Wee1-like protein to bind to eIF2α, we analyzed in more
detail the alignment of this enzyme to the other eIF2α
kinases (Additional file 2). We observed that three essential structural characteristics of eIF2α kinases are not
present in the Wee1-like kinase: a large insert (more than
30 amino acids) between the conserved kinase domains
IV and V [17], a threonine in a putative autophosphorylation site (position 446 for the human PKR) [18] and a
threonine at the end of domain IX (position 487 for the
human PKR) that is critical for the substrate specificity
[18]. Therefore, although the Arabidopsis Wee1-like
enzyme possess a high degree of homology to eIF2α
kinases, as previously noted for the human Wee1 [19], it
is unlikely to bind to eIF2α. We conclude that Arabidopsis
likely possesses a single eIF2α kinase of the GCN2 type.
The same conclusion was obtained using this approach to
analyze the rice genome (data not shown) suggesting that
higher plants only contain a GCN2-like eIF2α kinase.

In this work, we show that in response to several stresses,
including amino acid and purine starvations, UV, cold
shock and wounding, Arabidopsis GCN2 kinase is activated and phosphorylates eIF2α. We show that GCN2 is
essential for plant growth in stress situations and that this
activity is linked to a strong reduction in global protein
synthesis. The activation of GCN2 following wounding or
exposure to methyl jasmonate, ACC and salicylic acid, further suggests that this enzyme could play a role in plant
defense responses to insect herbivores and may represent

Arabidopsis thaliana GCN2 can phosphorylate eIF2α and
is essential in amino acid deprivation conditions
To investigate the role of AtGCN2, we first decided to confirm whether amino acid depletion, a stress known to activate yeast GCN2, is actually inducing eIF2α
phosphorylation in Arabidopsis. Similarly to the results
recently reported by Zhang et al. [12], we observed that
aromatic or branched amino acid deprivation (a situation
generated by exposing plants to glyphosate or chlorsulfuron respectively [20]) both induce eIF2α phosphoryla-

In amino acid starved S. cerevisiae cells, GCN2-dependent
eIF2α phosphorylation leads to a general down regulation
of protein synthesis and to the increased translation of the
GCN4 mRNA [2]. Following translation, the GCN4 transcriptional activator can induce the transcription of more
than 500 genes, including the majority involved in amino
acid synthesis. Uncharged tRNAs that accumulate during
amino acid starvation activate GCN2 by binding to a histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related domain located C-terminal
to the kinase domain [2]. S. cerevisiae GCN2 is activated
not only by nutrient limitation including amino acid,
purine and glucose deprivation, but also by high concentration of sodium and by the immunosuppressant
rapamycin [2].

tion, an induction that is completely suppressed by
adding the appropriate amino acids to the growth
medium (data not shown). eIF2α phosphorylation occurs
only 4 hours after disrupting the branched amino acid
synthesis pathway and peaks after 6 hours of treatment
(Figure 1A). eIF2α phosphorylation is completely
dependent on the presence of GCN2. Indeed, no phosphorylation was detected in a GCN2 null mutant line after
branched and aromatic amino acid deprivation (Figure 2
and not shown ; see Additional file 3 for a description of
the gcn2 mutant line).
In a classical rich medium, gcn2 mutant plants do not
have a particular phenotype compared to wild-type
plants. However, we observed that gcn2 plants are much
more sensitive to chlorsulfuron herbicide treatment than
wild-type plants (data not shown). Following 6 days of
chlorsulfuron-induced amino acid starvation gcn2 seedlings appeared smaller and more chlorotic than wild-type
seedlings, a result that concurs with that of Zhang et al.
[12]. The introduction of an intact copy of AtGCN2 in the
gcn2 mutant line allows the plants to grow identically to
wild-type seedlings during amino acid deprivation (data
not shown), confirming that AtGCN2 is essential for plant
growth in this stress situation. As expected, rescue of eIF2α
phosphorylation in response to amino acid deprivation
was also observed in the complemented gcn2:GCN2
plants (Figure 2). These results confirm that AtGCN2 is
the only Arabidopsis kinase involved in eIF2α phosphorylation in amino acid starvation conditions.
Characterization of other stresses leading to eIF2α
phosphorylation in Arabidopsis
Purine deprivation is known to activate yeast GCN2 [2].
We observed that purine deprivation (a situation gener-

ated by exposing plants to 8-azaadenine (azA) [21]) is
also inducing eIF2α phosphorylation in Arabidopsis (Figure 1B). Interestingly, this phosphorylation appears
within 2 hours after purine limitation (Figure 1C) and
likely results of a reduction in tRNA aminoacylation efficiency leading to the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs
[2]. eIF2α is also quickly phosphorylated after UV irradiation (Figure 1B). This response begins only 20 minutes
after irradiation, with a maximum of phosphorylation
after 1 hour and a return to basal levels after 6 hours (Figure 1D). Again, both phosphorylation events are completely dependent on the presence of GCN2 as no eIF2α
phosphorylation could be detected in the mutant gcn2
line in stress condition (Figure 1B). Although oxidative
and osmotic stresses are known to activate yeast GCN2
[2,22], we were not able to activate AtGCN2 using NaCl or
H2O2 (see Figure 3B). Also, heat shock did not lead to
eIF2α phosphorylation in Arabidopsis (data not shown)
confirming previous results obtained in wheat [23]. In
contrast, cold shock, plant wounding, methyl jasmonate,
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and salicylic acids were efficient, plant-specific inducer of GCN2dependent eIF2α phosphorylation (Figure 3 and Additional file 4). Jasmonate acid (JA) and related signaling
compounds such as methyl jasmonate are ubiquitous signals for tissue injury and for the subsequent activation of
defense response to insect herbivores [24]. ACC is a precursor of ethylene, which also affects the expression of
defensive proteins and secondary metabolites in response
to insect herbivores [24]. Both ACC and JA accumulate
simultaneously in response to insect herbivores and form
a conjugate (JA-ACC) that was proposed to coordinately
regulate the plant defense response [24]. Finally, salicylic

to lepidopteran insects [24]. The common capacity of

silenced and overexpressing lines (Figure 4) suggesting
that, in contrast to the yeast situation, no cross-talk exists
between the TOR and GCN2 pathways in Arabidopsis.

The AtGCN2 activity is not regulated by the TOR pathway
TOR (target of rapamycin) protein kinase is a central regulator of cell growth in response to nutrient and growth
factors [21]. A TOR homolog has been identified in Arabidopsis (AtTOR) and has been implicated in embryo development, meristem-driven cell growth, osmotic stress
inhibition and the stimulation of mRNA translation [25].
In yeast, phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 is responsible for about 50% of the inhibition of translation initiation following the use of the TOR inhibitor rapamycin,
suggesting that an important cross-talk exist between TOR
and GCN2 pathways [21]. In Arabidopsis, the RNAi inhibition of the TOR pathway also results in a strong inhibition
of translation initiation while TOR overexpressing lines
present an increase in translation initiation efficiency
[25]. To evaluate the implication of AtGCN2 in this regulation, we analyzed the level of eIF2α phosphorylation in
AtTOR RNAi-silenced (35-7, 65-1) and overexpressing
(G548, G166) lines in normal and amino acid deprivation conditions (Figure 4). The partly silenced 35-7 and
65-1 lines show a significant decrease in the accumulation
of AtTOR mRNA and a severe reduction in shoot and root
growth while the two overexpressing G548 and G166
lines have opposite features (increase accumulation of
AtTOR mRNA and a strong increase in shoot and root
growth) [25]. No increase in eIF2α phosphorylation was
detected in unstressed TOR-silenced lines and a similar
pattern of phosphorylation was observed in stressed TOR-

GCN2 activity induces a strong reduction in global protein
synthesis
The impact of eIF2α phosphorylation on the efficiency of
mRNA translation was next evaluated. We observed a
reduction in the abundance of high-molecular weight
polysomes compared to monosomes in amino acids (Figure 5A) or purine (Additional file 5) deprived wild type
plants. This variation in the polysomes to monosomes
ratio is diagnostic of a reduction in translation elongation
rate and translation initiation efficiency caused by these
stress conditions. In contrast, we found that amino acids
(Figure 5A) or purine (Additional file 5) deprived gcn2
mutant overaccumulates high molecular weight polysomes compared to monosomes. This suggests that, in
these stress conditions, gcn2 mutant can no longer prevent
translation initiation in a context where translation elongation is slowed down. In support to this conclusion, we
observed a marked decrease in the amount of neo-synthesized proteins by wild type plant during purine deprivation (Figure 5B), a decrease that is much weaker in gcn2
mutant plants (Figure 5B). Globally, these results suggest
that the GCN2-dependent increase in eIF2α phosphorylation under amino acids or purine deprivation conditions,
results in a strong reduction of protein synthesis.

Conclusion
Our data indicate that AtGCN2 is important for plant
growth in stress situations, likely through the general

down regulation of mRNA translation. For the moment, it
is not known if eIF2α phosphorylation by AtGCN2 can
lead to the selective stimulation of specific mRNA translation like this is the case for the yeast GCN4 [2] or mammalian ATF4 mRNAs [1]. The strong activation of
AtGCN2 following wounding and exposure to key hormones suggests that this enzyme evolved to play a role in
plant defense responses to insect pathogens and may represent a key but yet uncharacterized player linking biotic
and abiotic stresses. Therefore, while mammalians use
four different eIF2α kinases to respond to a large variety of
biotic and abiotic stresses, plants apparently achieve a
similar result with a single, GCN2-like enzyme.

Methods
Plant material, growth condition and stress treatments
Wild-type and gcn2 mutated Arabidopsis thaliana plants are
from the Landsberg (ler-0) ecotype. The gcn2 insertion

line was obtained from RIKEN Genomic Science Center
http://www.riken.jp/engn. Sterile seeds were germinated
on solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing
1% sucrose (w/v) and cultured in a 16-h-light/8-h-dark
cycle for 10 days at 23°C. When appropriate, Chlorsulfuron, glyphosate, 8-azaadenine, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, ACC and branched amino-acid were added to
the medium at a final concentration of 0.6 μM, 1.5 mM,
50 μg/ml, 25 μM, 0.6 mM, 50 μM and 5 mM respectively.
For the UV stress, seedlings were irradiated with UV light
at 50 mJ/m2 by using a UV cross-linker (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Plant wounding was performed by crushing
the leaf across the midrib with a haemostat. For the cold
shock treatment, seedlings were transferred at 4°C during
2 h followed by 2 h back in the growth chamber at 23°C.
Heat shock were performed at 42°C during 2 h followed
by 2 h back in the growth chamber at 23°C. For osmotic
and oxidative stresses, the seedlings were placed in solu-

tions containing 250 mM NaCl or 1 mM H2O2 during the
time indicated.
Immunoblot analysis of eIF2α phosphorylation
Western blots were probed using a phosphospecific antieIF2α rabbit monoclonal antibody (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA; 1/1,000 dilution). After incubation with a
horseradish peroxydase-coupled anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Sigma 1/5,000 dilution) immunoblots were
developed by using the ECL Plus Western Blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Chemiluminescence was visualized with a VersaDoc Imaging System
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Equal loading of protein
were confirmed by reprobing the membranes with a
mouse monoclonal anti-alpha-tubulin (Sigma 1/5,000

Polysome preparation and detection of neo-synthesized
proteins in normal and stress situation
For polysome preparation, seeds were sown in liquid
medium, incubated 48 h at 4°C, and grown under constant light during 10 days at 23°C. Chlorsulfuron was
added, and after 2 or 4 hours, the ribosomal pellet fraction was prepared from wild-type (WT) or gcn2 mutant
seedlings as described in [25]. Polysome profiles were displayed on sucrose gradients and profiles recorded at 260
nm. For the detection of neo-synthesized proteins, the 10
days-old seedlings were treated for 2 to 4 hours with 8azaadenine and then transferred for 2 hours into 1 ml of
MS medium containing 50 μCi of 35S-labelled methionine and 8-azaadenine. Untreated controls were incubated for 2 hours into the same labelling medium, but in
the absence of 8-azaadenine. After two washes with MS
medium, total proteins were extracted as described below
and 35 μg of protein were separated on SDS-PAGE. Gels
were stained with Coomassie blue or dried and autoradiographied using a PhosphoImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Inc.).
Preparation of total protein extracts
Following exposure to stress, total protein extracts were
prepared as following. For each treatment, three seedlings
were ground in Laemmli buffer containing both Complete protease and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and incubated at
95°C for 5 min. After centrifugation, samples were fractioned by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose.
