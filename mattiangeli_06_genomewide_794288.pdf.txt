Background: In this study we present a single population test (Ewens-Waterson) applied in a
genomic context to investigate the presence of recent positive selection in the Irish population. The
Irish population is an interesting focus for the investigation of recent selection since several lines
of evidence suggest that it may have a relatively undisturbed genetic heritage.

Background

[3,4]; the ABO blood group and the rhesus blood factor [5];

with haemochromatosis [7]; and PKU, associated with
phenyketonuria [8].

information

Ireland is an island on the western edge of Europe and genetic
evidence suggests that its population history may have been
relatively (but not absolutely) undisturbed by secondary
migrations [1,2]. This genetic heritage could mean that population genetic signals, such as signatures of recent selection,
are more readily detectable in the Irish than in other European populations. Furthermore, Ireland has world frequency

interactions

Conclusion: The cystic fibrosis gene, a disease that has a world maximum frequency in Ireland,
was among the genes showing evidence of selection. In addition to the demonstrated utility in
detecting a signature of natural selection, this approach has the particular advantage of speed. It
also illustrates concordance between results drawn from alternative methods implemented in
different populations.

Results: We first identified outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from previously
published genome-wide data, with high FST branch specification in a European-American population.
Eight of these were chosen for further analysis. Evidence for selective history was assessed using
the Ewens-Watterson's statistic calculated using Irish genotypes of microsatellites flanking the eight
outlier SNPs. Evidence suggestive of selection was detected in three of these by comparison with
a population-specific genome-wide empirical distribution of the Ewens-Watterson's statistic.

Mattiangeli et al.

The human genome sequence has provided a resource with
enormous medical potential. However, we are as yet ignorant
of the majority of genes that are medically important, especially with reference to common diseases, and the variations
within those genes that matter. Knowledge of past selection
may inform on these key points.

Inference of selection from population genetics
One way to infer evidence of past selection is to compare variation in allele frequency at different loci among different
populations. This assumes that geographically variable selective forces favor different variants in different regions. Hence,
between-population allele frequency differences may be more
extreme in genome portions harboring such variants. An
established approach to detecting such genome regions is that
of comparing FST values among loci; FST provides an estimate
of how much genetic variability partitions between, rather
than within, populations.
A particularly promising approach is that of population
genomics. Here, the testing of large numbers of loci enables
the compiling of an empirical distribution for a summary statistic, such as FST, from which outlying values may be identified as biologically interesting [9,10]. An empirical approach
may confer an additional level of rigor as model-based statistical tests may be sensitive to demographic effects that can
produce allele frequency patterns similar to those seen under
the presence of selection [11-16]. Importantly, general population demographic history will affect the whole genome but
selection will only act on specific loci and these will show unusual deviation from genomic patterns. Human populationspecific skews in these distributions have been previously
demonstrated. For example, Tajima's D values in humans
tend to be skewed towards negative values and this can be
attributed to population expansion that occurred to humans
post migration from Africa [17].
In an early genome-level analysis, analyzed 26,530 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 'The SNP Consortium' (TSC) allele frequency project in three populations
(African-American, East Asian and European-American).
From this three-way comparison, they identified 174 genes
associated with SNPs whose extreme deviations in FST values
suggested histories of selection. Interestingly, two of these
had been implicated in previous studies but another 18 were
putative bioinformatically predicted candidate genes. The
markers used in this work had been initially discovered by
assaying a small number of chromosomes, leading to possible
bias toward more common polymorphisms. It should also be
noted that these and other results from genome scans are
subject to problems arising from multiple testing and the
'winners curse' phenomenon [9]. Therefore, there is a clear
and acknowledged need for follow-up analyses to verify the
preliminary signatures of selection within this first generation selection map of the human genome.

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/8/R74

Here we select, using an analysis of locus-specific branch
lengths generated from the data of Akey and colleagues [12],
eight SNPs that are good candidates to have undergone selection within European populations. We identify microsatellite
markers flanking these loci, and genotype these in an Irish
population sample that has previously been genotyped at 372
micrsosatellites throughout the whole genome. This allows a
comparison between our test markers and an empirical distribution of the Ewans-Watterson statistic, a summary of
within-population allele frequency spectra that is a test for
selection. This demonstrates that seven of the SNPs are in the
proximity of microsatellite markers with extreme frequency
spectra, allowing stronger inference of selective history in
north-western Europe at three biologically interesting genes.

Results
Locus specific branch length analysis
In the present study, we first selected SNPs with extreme FST
values from Akey and colleagues' [12] original data set of
26,530 (among all populations; FST > 0.45; 812 SNPs selected
from the upper 3% tail). The diversity at each SNP may be
summarized in more detail by a simple three-branch phylogeny constructed from pairwise FST distances. We focused on
the locus-specific branch length (LSBL) from the European
sample node to the central node in the network; an indication
of differentiation that may be peculiar to Europe (Figure 1).
This is an approach that has also been used by Shriver and
colleagues [18] on a separate but similar data set. Values from
the high tail of this statistic are considered in Figure 2, where
the locus-specific European branch length (the absolute
value) is plotted versus this statistic scaled by dividing it by
the total locus-specific branch length. From this, 23 outlying
SNPs showing a locus-specific branch length > 0.8 for the
European population were examined. Among these, six were
in known genes, six were in genes of unknown function and 11
were not in coding sequences. However, three of the latter
were in proximity (within 50 kb) to a gene. A subset of eight
SNPs (from the above 23), all the six SNPs in known genes,
one in proximity to a gene and one not in coding sequences,
were further investigated.

Microsatellite diversity at proximal markers
Loci within a genomic region containing a selected variant
may share the population genetic effects of its selection
because of genetic hitchhiking. Thus, in an effort to verify the
evidence for European-centerd selection we identified and
investigated the population genetics of microsatellite markers
flanking the eight SNPs described above. We genotyped these
in an Irish test population and compared their diversity to
that of 372 microsatellite markers for which there is genotype
data from the same subjects. Fourteen microsatellites markers were developed during this project while two were taken
from previously published literature (IVS8CA [19]; IVS17bTA
[20]) (Table 1).

We also examined the possibility that the tendency of the microsatellite test markers' DH/sd values to occur in the negative
tail of the empirical distribution could be a consequence of
bias due to their proximity to coding sequences and, thus, the
effects of purifying selection. We constructed a sub-distribution of the empirical null by selecting only those markers that
were within genes (introns or exons, n = 174) (Figure 3b).
Clearly, a subset of the test markers remain in the tail of this
more conservative distribution. A further indication of the
neutrality of the gene-associated marker scores from the
empirical distribution was that DH/sd values for these micro-

Two microsatellites proved impossible to genotype due to
poor amplification and/or high levels of stuttering. All but
one of the microsatellites genotyped did not deviate significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations (1 result of p =
0.04 in 15 tests; Table 1), indicating a population in equilibrium and supporting genotyping accuracy [21].

The effects of proximity to coding sequences

In the present analysis putative signatures of selection were
assessed in two different ways. Firstly, all the genotypes from
the microsatellites flanking the eight outlier SNPs were used
for a single population statistical test based on simulated values; a development of the Ewens-Watterson test
implemented using the program BOTTLENECK. [22]. Secondly, divergences from the heterozygosity values expected
under Ewens-Watterson were assessed against an empirical
distribution of the same statistic calculated from 372 microsatellites, spread through the entire genome, genotyped on the
same panel of individuals.

All microsatellites flanking the same SNP (Table 1) were
tested for linkage disequilibrium. With the exception of microsatellites TPSG-1 versus TPSG-2, IVS8CA versus IVS17bTA
and IVS17bTA versus CFTR-3, all the other linked markers
showed significant values (CFTR-3 versus IVS8CA, p < 0.001;
TOX-1 versus TOX-2, p = 0.0017; ng-1 versus ng-2, p = 0.045;
SYT9-1 versus SYT9-2, p = 0.015; PRKCH-1 versus PRKCH2, p < 0.001)

Nine of the fourteen markers genotyped gave significant deviation from expected heterozygosity as assessed using the simulation test (Table 1). When the values (DH/sd) from the
Ewens-Watterson test were compared against the genomewide empirical distribution (Figure 3), all the microsatellites
that had a significant DH/sd from simulation (PS, Table 1)
were found in the tails (8%) of the distribution. Eight were in
the negative and one in the positive tail; perhaps indicating
different modes of selection. Only four microsatellites in the
positive tail and one in the negative one had a significant DH/
sd when more stringent significance values were calculated
from the empirical distribution (PE, Table 1). The negative tail
could indicate that the deviation between observed gene
diversity and expected Ewens-Watterson heterozygosity is
due to positive selection. This is because a selective sweep will
lead to a high frequency of the selected allele, a reduction of
variability and an excess of rare variants [10]. Therefore, a
lower number of heterozygotes than expected are observed.
On the other hand, the positive tail could indicate the presence of balancing selection where two or more alleles are
maintained at higher frequency, leading to a higher number
of observed heterozygotes. Furthermore, the Irish genomewide empirical distribution is skewed towards negative values
(Figure 3), a result consistent with the distribution across
5,257 microsatellites in individuals of European ancestry
[13].

comment

According to Ewens [23], under neutrality an expected configuration of allele counts can be calculated from the sample
size and the observed number of alleles. Subsequently, a test
(Ewens-Watterson) that compares the observed and expected
allele configuration to determine departure from neutrality
was developed [24]. Changes in allele proportions can be an
indication of selection pressure. The differences in allele frequency spectra between that expected under neutrality and
that observed can be quantified by the difference between
observed gene diversity (equivalent to the Hardy-Weinberg
expected heterozygosity) and expected Ewens-Watterson
heterozygosity (a DH value) [22]. Each DH value is divided by
the standard deviation (sd) of the gene diversity to standardize differences between microsatellite loci (DH/sd) and a significance value is assigned to DH/sd using simulations [22].

former and the latter, respectively, 3/19 and 5/19 of the top
5% outliers coincided for the two approaches.

Correlation between divergence and allele frequency
spectra
Many methods of assessing non-neutrality using population
genetic data are known to be related and thus largely redundant. However, the two employed here belong to two separate
approaches: locus-specific FST branch length (LBSL) is based
on divergence between populations and DH/sd is an assessment of allele frequency spectra within a single group. To
empirically assess the potential complementarity of these
approaches, we took a data set composed of 377 microsatellite
markers typed in French, Han Chinese and Nigerian Yoruba
samples [25]. We calculated two statistics analagous to those
we used above: DH/sd in each sample plus the LSBL terminating with the same group. In the European (French) sample
the two were negatively correlated (Spearman's Rank correlation: rs = -0.233; p < 0.001). However, LSBL proves a poor
predictor of DH/sd; for example, when one examines the top
5% of LSBL score outliers, only 1/19 is also a 5% outlier for
DH/sd. Analysis of the rank correlation between LBSL and
DH/sd in the Yoruba sample gave a weaker correlation result
(rs = -0.155; p < 0.003) and in the Han sample a somewhat

Discussion

We have found population genetic evidence suggestive of a
signature of selection at several markers associated with
genes in an Irish sample. Specifically, one microsatellite
showed an allele frequency spectrum indicative of balancing
selection and eight gave spectra that may support a legacy of
positive selection. The use of an empirical distribution of the
Ewens-Watterson test (DH/sd) to strengthen the assertion of
selection and to distinguish its effects from genome-wide
imprints of demographic processes confirms that, in this
case, the result has not been confounded by demographic
processes in the Irish population. In addition to the demonstrated utility in detecting a signature of natural selection,
this approach has the particular advantage of speed. While its
relative statistical power to detect selective effects, in comparison to standard tests, has yet to be elucidated, it requires
considerably less laboratory effort to perform on a genomic
scale, especially when compared with tests that require extensive population re-sequence data.

Correlation, although limited, between LSBL and the EwensWatterson based statistic used here suggests that there is not
complete independence between the two approaches, despite
their examining different aspects of allele diversity. However,
the TPSG1 outlying result is at the opposite tail to that
expected under the correlation, giving stronger inference of
underlying adaptive biology. Outlying results at the other tail

Two microsatellites, PRKCH-1 and PRKCH-2 (Table 1 and
Figure 3), within the gene PKCη (protein kinase C, eta, MIM
*605437), show the most extreme negative DH/sd values.
Each of these markers has one predominant allele with frequencies of 50% and 70%, respectively (Additional data file
2), consistent with an allelic configuration expected under
positive selection. The majority of the other alleles have a frequency of < 10%. This shared signal was despite a distance
between the markers of 79 kb (Table 1 and Figure 3); they
were also in significant linkage disequilibrium (p < 0.001).
PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein
targets, are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling
pathways [28] and the protein transcribed by PKCη is
involved in processes associated with several medical conditions [29-32]. Interestingly, this protein is highly expressed in
the epidermis and inhibits UV-induced apoptosis of keratino-

interactions

On the positive tail of the distribution, suggesting a history of
balancing selection, there is 1 of 2 microsatellites (TPSG-1;
Table 1 and Figure 3) within the TPSG1 (tryptase gamma 1;
MIM:*609341) gene with four common alleles ranging in frequency from 27% to 23% (Additional data file 2). Tryptases
have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of
asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders [26].
The suggestion of balancing selection in this gene is consistent with the expression of multiple tryptase isoforms, some of
which are allelic variants; a common feature in genes involved
in the immune response, for example, as seen in the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) of vertebrates [27].

retain a measure of complementarity given that: the correlation is weak and gives a poor empirical correspondence for
outliers; the approaches draw on different aspects of population biology; and the results come from a fresh test population. We discuss two such results below.

Genotypes at each microsatellite locus were tested for HardyWeinberg proportions using GENEPOP [47]. Departure from
the expected allele frequency distribution, a potential signature of selection, was tested using the Ewens-Watterson test.
The program BOTTLENECK [22] was used to calculate at
each microsatellite locus the expected heterozygosity under
neutrality, according to the allelic configuration calculated
with Ewens formula [23]. The program also assigned a significance value to DH/sd by completing numerous replicate simulations (PS, Table 1) under a specified mutation model (in

Conclusion

deposited research

The remaining microsatellites (LRRC, ABCD3-1, SYT9-1),
which have significant but less extreme values in the EwensWatterson test (PS, Table 1 and Figure 3), are associated with
poorly characterized genes. However, they each appear to
encode trans-membrane proteins [39-41].

reports

The next outlying marker in the negative tail of the distribution in a known gene is IVS8CA (Figure 3). This marker is
associated with the gene CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; MIM:*602421), which has
been well studied as mutations in it cause the autosomal
recessive disorder cystic fibrosis (CF). The CFTR gene product functions as a chloride channel and controls the regulation of other transport pathways. It is also a receptor for
bacterial pathogens [35,36]. There have been several hypotheses as to why CF is present at such a high level in Europe,
including that of heterozygote advantage, where a single copy
of the main western European disease-causing mutation
(ΔF508) increases resistance to typhoid [36]. In this study,
only one microsatellite, from the three examined in the gene,
showed a significant deviation in the Ewens-Watterson test.
Interestingly, this was also the closest to the gene region that
encodes the receptor for bacterial pathogens (residues 108 to
117) [36]. The results from our study might be from selection
acting on this region with an immune response function, but
are unlikely to be associated with CF. The frequency of the
disease in Ireland is 1/1,461 [37]. Thus, our 72 Irish samples
should have about four carriers, a number too low to profoundly influence the test statistic. Interestingly, a recent
analysis has stated evidence of recent selection associated
with a variation (V470) that is in linkage disequilibrium with
haplotypes that are not associated with the disease [38].

theory for nine microsatellite markers in the Irish population.
Seven of these are associated with six genes, strengthening
the likelihood that the elevated FST values shown by some of
the SNPs analyzed by previous studies [12] represent signatures of selection. The CFTR gene is a particularly interesting
result given previous discussion of selective history and the
global maximum found for the disease allele frequency within
Ireland. The simple assay described here provides a means to
further validate the presence of recent selection in outlier loci
identified in recently published more extensive genome-wide
surveys [42,43].

keratinocytes, cells that are involved in defending the skin
from chemical stimulation and UV exposure [33]. A variant in
this gene may have featured as part of the selected transition
to light skin in the populations ancestral to Europe, although
corroborating evidence would be required to assert this.
Selective histories at genes related to human pigmentation
have been inferred previously [34].

Empirical distribution of Ewens-Waterson's statistic
Empirical distribution of Ewens-Waterson's statistic. (a) Genome-wide distribution of Ewens-Watterson's analysis statistic (DH/sd) generated from 372
dinuclotide microsatellites, distributed through the whole genome (ABI PRISM Linkage mapping Set-MD10). (b) Genome-wide distribution of EwensWatterson's statistic generated from microsatellites located within genes. The number of loci is indicated by the Y-axis. The arrows show the EwensWatterson score for each microsatellite associated with the genes included in the preliminary test. The microsatellites in bold have significant divergence
(PE, Table 1) between observed gene diversity and expected heterozygosity according to the Ewens-Watterson test.

also calculated directly from the empirical distribution for
each screened microsatellite locus DH/sd value.
Linkage disequilibrium was calculated between linked microsatellite markers using the program ARLEQUIN [48].

A background genome-wide distribution of DH/sd values for
the Irish population was calculated from 372 autosomal microsatellites (ABI-Prism MD-10; the markers on the sex chromosomes were excluded [13]) typed in the 72 individuals also
used in the present study (Figure 3a). The location of each
microsatellite from the genome-wide distribution, whether
within a gene or not, was determined and consequently a second distribution was generated (Figure 3b). DH/sd values
from the microsatellites flanking the outlier SNPs were also
interpreted against this second distribution (Figure 3b) to
guard against any potential confounding influences, such as
the effect of purifying selection for microsatellites within
genes. Pearson and Spearman correlations were performed
between the distance of microsatellites in base pairs from the
closest gene and their DH/sd values.
