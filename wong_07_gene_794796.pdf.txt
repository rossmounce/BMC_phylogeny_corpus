information

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that brain development, especially oligodendrocyte maturation,
is delayed in Nfia-/- mice during the early postnatal period, which at least partly accounts for their
phenotype. The identification of potential NFI-A target genes in our study should help to elucidate
NFI-A dependent transcriptional pathways and contribute to enhanced understanding of this
period of brain formation, especially with regard to the function of NFI-A.

interactions

Results: To identify potential NFI-A target genes involved in the observed tissue malformations,
we analyzed gene expression in brains from Nfia-/- and Nfia+/+ littermate mice at the mRNA level
using oligonucleotide microarrays. In young postnatal animals (postnatal day 16), 356 genes were
identified as being differentially regulated, whereas at the late embryonic stage (embryonic day 18)
only five dysregulated genes were found. An in silico analysis identified phylogenetically conserved
NFI binding sites in at least 70 of the differentially regulated genes. Moreover, assignment of gene
function showed that marker genes for immature neural cells and neural precursors were
expressed at elevated levels in young postnatal Nfia-/- mice. In contrast, marker genes for
differentiated neural cells were downregulated at this stage. In particular, genes relevant for
oligodendrocyte differentiation were affected.

refereed research

Background: Nuclear factor I-A (NFI-A), a phylogenetically conserved transcription/replication
protein, plays a crucial role in mouse brain development. Previous studies have shown that
disruption of the Nfia gene in mice leads to perinatal lethality, corpus callosum agenesis, and
hydrocephalus.

Abstract

R72.2 Genome Biology 2007,

Volume 8, Issue 5, Article R72

Wong et al.

Background

The nuclear factor I (NFI) family of sequence-specific DNA
binding proteins has four members [1,2] (for review, see
Gronostajski [3]), namely NFI-A, NFI-B, NFI-C, and NFI-X.
They recognize the nucleotide consensus sequence
TTGGC(N)5GCCAA. NFI proteins were first identified as
nuclear proteins that bind to the replication origin of adenoviruses and initiate DNA replication in vitro [4,5]. Their consensus binding sequence was subsequently identified [6-8].
The promoters of several genes were shown to be activated by
NFI proteins. These 'positive target genes' include the gene
encoding α-globin [9], human hepatitis B virus S gene [10],
Mbp (myelin basic protein) [11,12], B-Fabp (brain fatty acidbinding protein; also called Blbp [brain lipid-binding protein]) [13], and Gabra6 (α6 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric
acid [GABA] type A receptor) [14]. On the other hand, there
are also genes that are negatively regulated by NFI, such as
the gene that encodes adenine nucleotide translocase 2 [15].
Unpublished data from our laboratory also suggest that NFIA negatively regulates transcription of the mouse L1 gene. L1
is a cell adhesion molecule that is involved in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity [16]. The complexity of regulation by NFI family members is further
increased by alternative splicing, yielding as many as nine different proteins from one gene [17,18]. For instance, a brainspecific isoform of NFI-A [3], which was first isolated in 1990
by Inoue and coworkers [19], activates the transcription of
mouse myelin basic protein.
Nfia-/- mice exhibit severe neurologic defects, including communicating hydrocephalus, corpus callosum agenesis, and
disrupted development of midline glia [20,21], similar to L1deficient mice [22,23]. These findings indicate that NFI-A
plays an important role in regulating gene transcription during brain development. Moreover, NFI-A mRNA is expressed
in adult mouse brain [24], which suggests that the respective
protein participates in the control of gene expression in the
mature central nervous system. To understand how NFI-A
could influence brain development and function, it is important to obtain a comprehensive overview of NFI-A responsive
genes in the brain. Oligonucleotide microarrays [25] offer an
attractive experimental approach for such global gene expression analyses. We therefore performed a microarray analysis
of brain cDNA from embryonic (embryonic day 18 [E18]) and
early postnatal (postnatal day 16 [P16]) Nfia-/- mice in comparison with respective wild-type littermate controls.
Using this method, we identified a large number of genes that
are dysregulated at the mRNA level in postnatal NFI-A
knockout (Nfia-/-) mouse brains. Moreover, by in silico promoter analysis, we showed that, among this group, at least 70
genes possess phylogenetically conserved NFI binding sites in
their promoter region, suggesting that they might be direct
NFI-A targets. Database analyses of gene function revealed
that the changes in gene expression observed in our study
probably reflect a delay in neural, particularly oligodendro-

cyte, differentiation, which appears to be a consequence of
loss of NFI-A.

Results
Microarray analysis
High-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis was carried
out for total RNA from brains of Nfia-/- mice and agematched, wild-type littermate controls. Analyses were performed with independent samples from three Nfia-/- and
three wild-type (Nfia+/+) animals each for E18 and P16. All
animals were F1 hybrids of C57BL/6 and 129S6 mice, ensuring a survival rate of 38.5% until P16. A total of 356 genes
were identified as being differentially expressed in the Nfia-/animals at P16 (197 upregulated and 159 downregulated), taking a cutoff of a 1.2-fold change and a significance of P < 0.05
in expression relative to the wild-type control (see Additional
data file 1). Among these, 53 genes were found to exhibit a
greater than 1.5-fold change in expression (39 downregulated
[74%] and 14 upregulated [26%]; Table 1).
Within this latter group of strongly dysregulated genes, a total
of 11 genes exhibit greater than twofold dysregulation, with
nine genes downregulated and two upregulated. The downregulated genes include those encoding the following: angiotensinogen (Agt); aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1,
subfamily A1 (Aldh1a1); folate hydrolase (Folh1); GABA-A
receptor, subunit α6 (Gabra6); gap junction membrane
channel protein β6 (Gjb6); lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (Lcat); myelin and lymphocyte protein (Mal); myelinassociated oligodendrocytic basic protein (Mobp); and
neurotensin receptor 2 (Ntsr2). The upregulated genes
encode fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) and the transcription factor SRY-like HMG-box containing 11 (Sox11).
At the late embryonic stage (E18), fewer genes were significantly dysregulated in the Nfia-/- mutant relative to the wildtype animals when compared with the postnatal stage (P16).
A total of five genes was identified as being significantly dysregulated with changes of more than 1.2-fold (Table 2). One of
the three downregulated genes encodes a yet uncharacterized
protein, whereas the two others encode phosphatidylinositol4-phosphate 5-kinase, type II, γ (Pip5k2c) and synaptotagmin
binding, cytoplasmic RNA interacting protein (Syncrip).
mRNAs for synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) and pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 1 (Plagl1) were expressed at elevated levels in
the Nfia-/- animals. At E18, no gene was differentially regulated more than 1.5-fold in the Nfia-/- mutants relative to the
wild-type controls. Pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 1
(Plagl1) is the only gene that exhibits a 1.2-fold up-regulation
in Nfia-/- mice at both developmental stages.
In P16 Nfia-/- mice, a total of 356 individual genes, represented by 395 probe sets, were dysregulated in comparison
with the wild-type control group. Among these, 35 genes were
represented by more than one probe set on the microarray

(Additional data file 1, blue labels). In all cases, probe sets
representing the same gene showed the same direction of dysregulation when comparing Nfia+/+ with Nfia-/- mice. For
instance, all of the four probe sets for Mobp identified a
weaker signal in Nfia-/- mice than in Nfia+/+ mice. Moreover,
it is likely that at least four probe sets represent more than
one transcript (Additional data file 1, red labels). Therefore,
the number of dysregulated genes in Nfia-/- mice could even
be higher than 356.
To investigate overall gene expression profiles, microarray
data were analyzed using the robust multi-array average algorithm [26]. Correlations between the expression profiles of
individual samples were calculated with all samples, using
one Nfia+/+ E18 mouse brain ('E18WT1') as a reference for

this search (Figure 1). As expected, the greatest similarity in
mRNA levels was found between E18WT1 and the two other
Nfia+/+ mice at E18, namely E18WT2 and E18WT3. Broadly
speaking, similarity in the gene expression profile relative to
E18WT1 increased in the following order: P16 Nfia+/+ < P16
Nfia-/- < E18 Nfia-/- < E18 Nfia+/+.
Figure 2a shows the overall gene expression pattern in both
E18 Nfia+/+ and Nfia-/- mice. The expression patterns are
much more similar between Nfia+/+ and Nfia-/- mice than
those seen at P16, and very few genes were changed significantly between Nfia+/+ and Nfia-/- in the E18 animals. In contrast, at P16 many changes in gene expression levels are
observed (Figure 2a) between Nfia+/+ and Nfia-/- animals.
Most genes that are expressed at a higher level in E18 become

Interestingly, a number of genes encoding myelin-related
proteins exhibited significantly reduced expression in brains

Moreover, agenesis of the corpus callosum in animals lacking
NFI-A suggests that this transcription factor plays a role in
regulating axonal growth. It is tempting to assume that NFIA could do so by influencing the expression of genes that
encode growth promoting or growth repelling proteins. For
this reason, we also attempted to identify molecules that have
already been shown to stimulate or inhibit neurite growth
among those differentially expressed in Nfia-/- mouse brains.
For 22 genes that were either upregulated or downregulated
in the NFI-A mutant animals, reports from the literature indicate that the respective gene product is involved in regulating
neurite growth (Table 4). Among these genes, 12 encode
proteins whose expression is favorable for neurite growth (for
instance acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), melanoma

A total of 356 genes that were dysregulated in P16 Nfia-/- mice
were assigned to biologic functions based on Gene Ontology
(GO) Biological Process categories (Additional data file 2 provides a list of assignments). Among the 197 upregulated
genes, a large percentage (34.6%) of the candidate genes is
involved in transcriptional and translational regulation.
These groups include genes that encode RNA binding proteins, transcription factors and ribosomal proteins, and comprise only 10.4% of probe sets on the microarray. Figures 3
and 4 show the distribution of gene functions in the upregulated and downregulated groups, respectively. Within the
group of upregulated genes, 33 probe sets (16.8%) were in the
category of 'protein biosynthesis', as compared with 1.5% of
probe sets on the complete microarray. Twenty probe sets
(10.2%) could be assigned to 'regulation of transcription,
DNA dependent' (8.2% on the complete microarray), and 15
gene products (7.6%) are involved in mRNA processing (0.7%
on the complete microarray). Among the 159 downregulated
genes, a significant effect on ion transport related genes can
be observed; 14 genes (9.0% of downregulated genes in Nfia/- mice) fall into this category, which is an 'over-representation' compared with the complete array, in which ion transport related genes account for only 1.6% of probe sets.

of Nfia-/- mice at P16 (Figure 4). Because central nervous system myelin is formed by oligodendrocytes, we suspected that
NFI-A could influence oligodendrocyte differentiation. We
therefore interrogated our list of dysregulated genes for
markers of either mature oligodendrocytes or immature oligodendrocyte precursor cells. We found that five genes typically expressed in oligodendrocyte precursors exhibited a
higher expression level in Nfia-/- mice than in Nfia+/+ animals, whereas eight genes that are markers of mature oligodendrocytes exhibited decreased expression in Nfia-/mouse brains (Table 3). As shown in Figure 5, the
oligodendrocyte precursor markers Sox2, Sox4, and Sox11 are
expressed in both Nfia+/+ and Nfia-/- animals at E18. However, the decrease in gene expression between E18 and P16 is
less pronounced in Nfia-/- animals than in Nfia+/+ animals,
causing an apparent mRNA overexpression of these genes at
P16.

less strongly expressed in P16 mice and vice versa, both in
Nfia+/+ and Nfia-/- mice. However, comparison of P16 Nfia-/with P16 Nfia+/+ animals revealed many significant changes
in gene expression (Figure 2b).

proteins that influence neurite growth in a cell type or presentation dependent manner, including tenascin-C and CD24.

Quantitative real-time PCR validation of microarray
results
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
was performed on 15 genes, selected according to their biologic relevance from the dysregulated genes in P16 Nfia-/mice (Figure 6). On the one hand we chose oligodendrocyte
precursor genes such as Sox2 and Sox11, but we also selected
markers of mature oligodendrocytes, such as Car2 (carbonic
anhydrase 2) and Mobp (myelin oligodendrocyte basic protein). In addition to genes relevant to oligodendroglial
differentiation, we also chose further markers of immature
(Dcx [doublecortin]) or mature (Gfap [glial fibrilliary acidic
protein] and Gabra6) neural cells. All PCR analyses were
performed in triplicate, using eight independent Nfia-/- and
six independent Nfia+/+ brain samples, and confirmed differential expression of all the genes selected for qRT-PCR validation, indicating the significance of our microarray analysis
findings (Figure 6). Importantly, both genes exhibiting a
strongly differential expression pattern on the microarrays
(for instance, Dcx, which exhibited 1.87-fold upregulation)
and genes with a much lower fold change (such as Sox2,
which was 1.28-fold upregulated) were confirmed to be differentially expressed.
To investigate whether the differential gene expression
observed at P16 is maintained at a later age, we also analyzed
RNA from postnatal day 43 (P43) Nfia-/- and Nfia+/+ brains
for expression of the selected genes mentioned above. As
shown in Figure 7, differences in gene expression between
Nfia-/- and Nfia+/+ animals generally decrease from P16 to
P43. However, certain genes such as Gabra6 and Gfap exhibit
pronounced downregulation at both ages.

In silico promoter analysis
NFI-A is a nuclear, DNA-binding protein. It plays a role in
adenovirus DNA replication and in transcription of viral and
cellular genes. Therefore, we assumed that at least some of
the dysregulated genes found in our study might be direct
transcriptional targets of NFI-A. In order to identify such
potential targets, we conducted a promoter analysis of all
genes exhibiting a significant decrease or increase in transcript level in Nfia-/- relative to Nfia+/+ mice. This in silico
analysis aimed to detect potential NFI-A binding sites within
2 kilobases (kb) upstream of the respective gene's
transcription start site. The palindromic nucleotide sequence
TTGGC(N)5GCCAA has been demonstrated to be the optimal
binding motif for members of the NFI family. However, most
of the NFI binding sites experimentally identified thus far do
not contain the complete motif, and even half sites can be

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R72

physiologically relevant [3]. This reflects the fact that transcription factors have a certain degree of freedom in their
sequence recognition. For this reason, matrices are used that
give the different nucleotides various weightings depending
on their importance for transcription factor binding [27]. In
addition to the use of such a matrix for NFI binding motifs, we
also considered the phylogenetic conservation of these binding sites by comparing the mouse, rat, and human orthologs
of the respective genes. We supposed that motifs with a high
degree of interspecies conservation are those that are most
likely to have physiologic relevance.
Using these criteria, we were able to identify more than 70
genes among our microarray candidate molecules bearing a
conserved NFI recognition site in their promoter region
(Table 5 and Additional data file 3). This group of genes
includes Gfap and Gabra6, whose promoter activity can be
regulated by NFI proteins, according to previous studies
[14,28,29]. Interestingly, according to our analysis, Ncam,
Vcam1, Mcam and Mag, four genes that encode adhesion
molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, also possess
conserved NFI motifs in their promoter sequences.

Discussion

Mice with a targeted ablation of the site-specific transcription
factor NFI-A exhibit severe brain malformations, including
hydrocephalus and agenesis of the corpus callosum, as was
also seen in L1-deficient mice and humans bearing mutations
in their L1 gene [30]. Most probably, lack of NFI-A causes
changes in brain gene expression. Altered expression of genes
that encode proteins relevant to brain development might
then lead to the observed defects. Therefore, large-scale analysis of mRNA levels in Nfia-/- mice could help not only to
identify new target genes of NFI-A but also to clarify
mechanisms by which this transcription factor influences
brain development. For this reason, we used oligonucleotide
microarrays to gain gene expression profiles of Nfia-/- mouse
brains and of corresponding wild-type samples. Relatively
early and late changes in gene expression were measured by
quantifying transcript levels in Nfia-/- and Nfia+/+ mice at E18
(before gross hydrocephalus) and at P16 when all animals are
clearly hydrocephalic. At P16 stage, we observed that 356
genes were dysregulated in Nfia-/- mice relative to Nfia+/+
mice. By contrast, only five genes exhibited altered expression
in E18 Nfia-/- animals in comparison with Nfia+/+ mice. Overall, P16 Nfia-/- gene expression profiles were more similar to
the E18 Nfia+/+ than to the P16 Nfia+/+ profiles. Hence, one
can conclude that Nfia-/- mice exhibit a delay in early postnatal brain development relative to wild-type control animals.
This idea gains further support when one looks at the function
of the dysregulated genes.

(P)16 Nfia-/- relative to P16 Nfia+/+ samples. Each curve represents one probe set, and each intercept on the x-axis represents one chip. Two normalization
steps were performed. First, normalization across the whole array was carried out in order to correct for variations of average signal intensity. Second,
the mean signal intensity of each individual probe set on all 12 chips was set to 1. Taking the rightmost chip on the x-axis ('P16WT3') as a reference (blue
line), colors were assigned to the curves representing probe sets. The higher the signal intensity is on this reference chip, the more red the color; similarly,
and the lower the signal intensity, the more green is the curve's color (following the spectrum given on the right). KO, knockout (Nfia-/-); WT, wild-type

genes in Nfia-/- mice fell into the functional groups of transcriptional and translational activities. This is a significantly
higher percentage compared with the representation of these
groups on the complete microarray (10.4%). In particular,
many transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins exhibit elevated levels in these mutants. This upregulation of messages
encoding ribosomal proteins suggests increased translational
activity in Nfia-/- brains.
Interestingly, the expression of several genes associated with
immature stages of the nervous system is upregulated in postnatal Nfia-/- mice. In particular, elevated mRNA levels of Dcx
(which encodes doublecortin) and Nnat (encoding neuronatin) were observed. Doublecortin is expressed primarily in
migrating and differentiating neurons during embryonic
development [31]. It is essential for cortical layer formation,
most probably because of its role in neuronal migration [32].
Neuronatin is strongly expressed in late fetal and early postnatal brain, but it disappears at later developmental stages
[33]. Remarkably, Plagl1, the only gene expressed at elevated
levels both at E18 and P16 in Nfia-/- mice, encodes a
transcription factor synthesized preferentially by neural precursor cells [34]. On the contrary, mRNAs for Gabra6 and
Gfap, genes associated with terminal differentiation of neural
cells, are found at lower levels in NFI-A deficient mice at P16.
The α6 subunit of the GABA-A receptor (encoded by Gabra6)

is expressed by differentiated neurons in the cerebellum [14].
Like Gabra6, Gfap (which encodes the glial fibrillary acidic
protein, expressed by differentiated astrocytes in the central
nervous system) has been identified as a direct target of NFIA [29] and is downregulated in Nfia-/- mice.
The observed pattern of changes in gene expression suggests
a delay in brain development in NFI-A mutants. In the
absence of NFI-A, genes that are normally expressed during
embryonic development and around birth remain at high levels of expression, leading to an overexpression at P16. By contrast, genes whose expression usually increases during the
course of terminal differentiation after birth appear not to be
activated adequately in Nfia-/- mice, leading to their reduced
mRNA level in the P16 mutants. Investigation of Nfia-/- and
Nfia+/+ animals at P43 showed that, for most of the selected
genes, dysregulation decreased in comparison with P16 or
even disappeared. This observation further supports the idea
of a delayed expression program in Nfia-/- mice.

Oligodendrocyte differentiation
To identify cell types that are probably affected by the expression delay suggested above, we examined further the function
of dysregulated genes. A significant number of myelin-related
proteins exhibited decreased expression in Nfia-/- mouse
brains, prompting us to analyze our results with regard to oli-

godendrocyte differentiation. Oligodendrocytes produce
central nervous system myelin, thereby facilitating rapid
impulse conduction [35]. Myelinating oligodendrocytes
mainly accumulate after birth in rodents, whereas their progenitors are already apparent in the ventricular zone at
around embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) [36]. Thus, in E18 brains
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are predominant, whereas at
P16 mature oligodendrocytes have developed. In Nfia-/brains at P16, we observed that several genes expressed by
mature oligodendrocytes, namely MAG, Mal, Mobp, Mog,
Ugt8, Cldn11, Plp1, and Car2, exhibited reduced transcript
levels compared to Nfia+/+ animals. In contrast, mRNAs
encoding Sox2, Sox4, Sox11, tenascin-C and Hmgb2, which
are typically expressed by precursor cells rather than by
mature oligodendrocytes, are upregulated in Nfia-/- brains
relative to Nfia+/+ brains at this stage. Moreover, Dio2 exhibits reduced expression levels in P16 Nfia-/- brains. Dio2
encodes the iodothyronine deiodinase II, which catalyzes the
conversion of the hormone thyroxine to tri-iodothyronine
[37]. Tri-iodothyronine is known to trigger terminal
oligodendrocyte differentiation [38], and so a reduction in
Dio2 levels could delay oligodendrocyte maturation indirectly
via reduced tri-iodothyronine levels. Furthermore, we
detected slightly increased transcript levels of Myef2 in Nfia/- mice. My-EF2, the corresponding protein, represses expression of myelin basic protein [39], a major component of myelin [36,40]. Higher My-EF2 levels could therefore slow down

differentiation of oligodendroglia. Moreover, the tremor
exhibited by rare NFI-A deficient mice surviving until adulthood [20] would be in accordance with a myelin compromised phenotype. Interestingly, L1 has also been implicated
in myelination [41]. Although we did not observe a dysregulation of L1 in our microarray analysis, one cannot exclude an
induction in glial cells being obscured by the high expression
level of L1 in neurons. In contrast to the peripheral nervous
system, glial cells of the central nervous system do not express
L1 at any age investigated.
To summarize, our data suggest a role for NFI-A in regulating
terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes, both by repressing expression of progenitor specific gene products and by
enhancing expression of genes that are relevant to mature oligodendrocyte function (Figure 8). It is noteworthy that the
time window between E18 and P16, during which these
changes in expression pattern emerge, fits nicely to the main
period of oligodendrocyte differentiation. In agreement with
the observations presented here, a crucial role for NFI-A in
spinal cord gliogenesis was recently shown [42], which lends

further support to the idea that NFI-A mediates oligodendrocyte differentiation.

Axonal growth and guidance
The absence of the corpus callosum in Nfia-/- mice suggests
that NFI-A could participate in controlling expression of molecules relevant for axonal growth and guidance. For this reason, we analyzed whether dysregulated genes detected in our
microarray study had been reported to be involved in these
processes. For at least 22 of the genes differentially expressed
in Nfia-/- brains, previous studies indicated a participation of
their gene products in growth and guidance of neuronal processes. This is quite a large number, which strengthens the
view that NFI-A could contribute to brain wiring during the
early postnatal period by regulating the transcription of genes
that encode neurite growth promoting or inhibiting proteins.
A more detailed look at the dysregulated genes reveals that
growth-promoting molecules, such as clusterin, aFGF, and
Ndrg2, are expressed at a rather lower level in Nfia-/- mice,
whereas an upregulation of the repulsive guidance cues such
as ephrin B2 and CRMP1 can be observed. However, there are

Because NFI-A is a transcription factor, we assumed that it
regulates the transcription of at least some of the differentially expressed genes found in our study. In order to identify
such potential targets, we performed an in silico analysis of
potential, phylogenetically conserved NFI-A binding sites
within 2 kb upstream of the respective genes' transcription
start sites. We could identify more than 70 genes among our
microarray candidate molecules bearing a conserved NFI recognition site in their promoter. Because of their high identity
to the NFI consensus sequence combined with phylogenetic

First, NFI-A might alter the expression levels of other transcription factors that affect target gene expression (indirect
influence). For example, expression of the transcription factor NeuroD1, which is downregulated 1.68-fold in Nfia-/mice, can be increased by GABAergic excitation [43]. This
effect is mediated via GABA-A receptors, and Gabra6, the
gene encoding the α6 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, is a
direct target of NFI-A [14], which is in accordance with the
results of our promoter analysis. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the reduced expression of this GABA-A receptor
subunit in NFI-A deficient mouse brains could contribute to
the observed reduction in NeuroD1 expression.

two established direct target genes of NFI-A, Gfap [29] and
Gabra6 [14], were among the candidates detected in our promoter analysis. Two possible reasons for why only about 70
genes carrying conserved NFI motifs were identified from
more than 300 genes dysregulated in total are as follows.

both upregulated growth promoting and downregulated
growth inhibiting molecules. Moreover, some molecules can
either favor or inhibit growth, depending on their interaction
partners or on the way in which they are presented by neurons and glial cells. Therefore, it will be necessary to study
NFI-A dependent expression of these proteins at the cellular
level in order to shed more light on the role played by NFI-A
in axonal growth and guidance.

Second, our promoter analysis probably does not yield a complete list of direct NFI-A targets within the group of dysregulated genes investigated. The limitation to the 2 kb region
upstream of the transcription start excludes all potential NFI
sites that might be located either further upstream or within
the first intron, and even NFI half sites, which are not considered by our stringent screening method, can mediate NFI
protein binding under certain conditions. Therefore, the
number of direct NFI-A targets among the differentially
expressed genes might be even higher than 70.
Most importantly, however, this promoter screen provides a
molecular basis for the role of NFI-A in regulating brain maturation; several genes associated with maturation of neurons
or glial cells are not only dysregulated in postnatal Nfia-/mice, but also possess NFI binding sites in their promoter,
enabling direct transcriptional regulation by NFI-A. Among
them, there are both markers of oligodendrocyte precursors
(Sox11 and Tenascin-C) and genes expressed by mature
oligodendrocytes (Car2 and Mag). Therefore, it is likely that
NFI-A exerts its influence on postnatal brain development at
least partly by directly regulating the transcription of the
genes identified in our promoter analysis.

Conclusion

In the present study, we investigated the effects of NFI-A
ablation on brain mRNA expression patterns in mice, aiming
to discover potential NFI-A targets that are important for
perinatal and early postnatal brain development. Using
microarray analysis, only five genes appear to be dysregulated
at the transcript level in late embryonic Nfia-/- mice, whereas
a much higher number, specifically 356, of dysregulated
genes was observed at postnatal day 16. We confirmed the
changes in expression of 15 genes by qRT-PCR in both the
original RNA samples used on the microarrays and in independent samples. Upregulation of immature neural cell
markers and downregulation of mature neural cell markers in
16-day-old Nfia-/- brains suggest that removal of NFI-A
causes a delay in early postnatal brain development. In particular, genes relevant to oligodendrocyte maturation are
affected at the crucial time window for this process. An in silico promoter analysis revealed that more than 70 dysregulated genes possess a phylogenetically conserved NFI binding
site within 2 kb upstream of their transcription start point,
including several genes that are implicated in differentiation
of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Therefore, our
results suggest that NFI-A plays an important role in early

Nfia-/- mice were bred and maintained as described previously [20]. Animals were killed by exposing them to CO2 at
embryonic stage E18.5 (E18), postnatal day 16 (P16), or postnatal day 43 (P43). Brains were dissected and snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen. The respective Nfia-/- and Nfia+/+ animals
used for analysis at E18, P16, or P43 were littermates. All of
the animals were F1 hybrids of C57BL/6 and 129S6 animals.
In the initial studies of the Nfia- allele in a mixed 129S6C57BL/6-Black Swiss background, we found that about 80%
of Nfia-/- mice died at P0 and about 10% survived to P16. In
contrast, 0% of Nfia-/- mice survive past P0 in an inbred
C57BL/6 background, precluding studies of postnatal animals. In the inbred 129S6 background about 30% of Nfia-/mice survive to P16, whereas in F1 hybrids of C57/BL6 males

and 129S6 females about 60% of Nfia-/- mice survive to P16.
Many of these animals die after weaning from their mothers
at P24 and the remainder are severely runted (Gronostajski
RM, unpublished observations). Thus, we chose P16 129S6C57BL/6 F1 hybrid animals for analysis because they could be
obtained in sufficient numbers, and the Nfia-/- mice were
genetically identical to their Nfia+/+ littermates. Within these
matings, males had a B6 and females had a 129S6 background. In a large scale test, 38.5% of the offspring survive
until P30 using this type of mating. All animal use was performed under the approved protocol BCH05082N (RMG) of

and 280 nm wavelength. To check RNA integrity, total RNA
was separated in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde,
and the intensity ratio of 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA bands
was assessed after ethidium bromide staining.

Microarray hybridization and signal detection
Procedures for cDNA synthesis, labeling, and hybridization
were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). All experiments
were performed using Affymetrix mouse genome Genechip
U74A version 2. Briefly, 15 μg total RNA was used for firststrand cDNA synthesis with a high-performance liquid chromatography purified T7-(dT)24 primer. Synthesis of biotinlabeled cRNA was carried out using the ENZO RNA transcript
labeling kit (Affymetrix). For hybridization, 15 μg fragmented
cRNA were incubated with the chip in 200 μl hybridization
solution in Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) at 45°C for
16 hours. Genechips were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin using the microfluidic workstation™
(Affymetrix) and scanned with a laser scanner (Agilent Technologies, Böblingen, Germany).

Nfia-/- with Nfia+/+ (control) samples were removed in order
to reduce the number of genes undergoing statistical analysis.
Second, genes were then tested statistically for significant
changes in all three wild-type or NFI-A deficient samples,
using Student's t-test and multiple corrections with a false
discovery rate of 5%. Finally, genes were grouped based on
their biologic function using Affymetrix NetAffx and the
National Center for Biotechnology Information's Locuslink.

Microarray quantification and statistical analysis
Quality controls were performed using Affymetrix Microarray
Suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0) software. Data and statistical analysis
and data visualization were performed with GeneSpring™
(Agilent Technologies). Expression values were extracted
from the CEL file, and imported to GeneSpring using robust
multi-array average for further analysis [26]. Two criteria
were used to select for significant changes in gene expression.
First, probe sets with less than 1.2-fold change on comparing

The reverse transcription was performed using Superscript II
(Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol.
Briefly, 5 μg total RNA was reverse transcribed with random
hexamers. First-strand reverse transcribed cDNA was then
diluted 1:10 in water before use for real-time PCR. Primers
(Metabion, Martinsried, Germany), as listed in Table 6, were
used together with the qPCR Core Kit (Eurogentec, Köln,
Germany) in an ABI 7900 HT system (Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt, Germany), in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions. Real-time PCR data analysis was performed
using the comparative CT method (Applied Biosystems), with
hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt) as
an endogenous reference. Statistical significance of
expression differences detected by qRT-PCR was examined
using a two-tailed, two-sample equal variance t-test.

[44]. Promoter sequences were then downloaded from
Ensembl (release 34, October 2005). One species was defined
as reference species (Mus musculus), and orthologous genes
from Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus were extracted.
For each gene, a sequence corresponding to 2 kb upstream of
the known transcription start site of each transcript was
taken. In case of genes yielding more than one transcript, the
window was enlarged to give a stretch of sequence ranging
from 2 kb upstream the most 5' starting transcript to the 5'
end of the most downstream starting transcript. No repeat
masking was involved. Each set of orthologous sequences was
screened for the presence of NFI motifs given a threshold for
the score of 80%. The NFI motif is represented by a positional
weight matrix. All possible permutations of detected sites
from all species under study were aligned using ClustalW.
The 'percentage identity' value, as calculated by ClustalW,
was taken as motif conservation. Sets with a conservation better than 80% were reported.
