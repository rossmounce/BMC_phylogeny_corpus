Abstract
Background: Pseudogenes reveal ancestral gene functions. Some obligate intracellular bacteria,
such as Mycobacterium leprae and Rickettsia spp., carry substantial fractions of pseudogenes. Until
recently, horizontal gene transfers were considered to be rare events in obligate host-associated
bacteria.
Results: We present a visualization tool that displays the relationships and positions of degraded
and partially overlapping gene sequences in multiple genomes. With this tool we explore the origin
and deterioration patterns of the Rickettsia pseudogenes and find that variably present genes and
pseudogenes tend to have been acquired more recently, are more divergent in sequence, and
exhibit a different functional profile compared with genes conserved across all species. Overall, the
origin of only one-quarter of the variable genes and pseudogenes can be traced back to the
common ancestor of Rickettsia and the outgroup genera Orientia and Wolbachia. These sequences
contain only a few disruptive mutations and show a broad functional distribution profile, much like
the core genes. The remaining genes and pseudogenes are extensively degraded or solely present
in a single species. Their functional profile was heavily biased toward the mobile gene pool and
genes for components of the cell wall and the lipopolysaccharide.
Conclusion: Reductive evolution of the vertically inherited genomic core accounts for 25% of the
predicted genes in the variable segments of the Rickettsia genomes, whereas 75% stems from the
flux of the mobile gene pool along with genes for cell surface structures. Thus, most of the variably
present genes and pseudogenes in Rickettsia have arisen from recent acquisitions.

Background

Pseudogenes represent a heterogeneous collection of
sequences, ranging from genes with an internal stop codon or

frameshift mutation to extensively degraded genes. Pseudogenes and noncoding DNA were originally considered to be
rare in bacteria. However, a recent genomic survey identified

7,000 pseudogenes in 64 bacterial genomes, a large fraction
of which had arisen from 'failed' horizontal gene transfers [1].
Recently evolved pathogens in particular have many pseudogenes [2], and the genomes of intracellular bacteria such as
Rickettsia and Mycobacteria have exceptionally high fractions of noncoding DNA and pseudogenes (>25%) [3,4]. This
has been accounted for by reductive genome evolution and
small effective population sizes [5,6]. Also, increased exploitation of host metabolites and reduced selective pressure for
rapid growth in the nutritionally rich eukaryotic cytoplasm
may allow mutations to accumulate in essential bacterial
genes. Furthermore, it was suggested that the reduced threat
of genetic parasites in the protected intracellular environment has lowered the genomic deletion rate, making pseudogene elimination a slower process [7]. However, this model
was based on the assumption that horizontal gene transfers
are rare in intracellular bacterial populations.

ted fever group (SFG: Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia sibirica,
and Rickettsia rickettsii), the transitional group (Rickettsia
akari and Rickettsia felis), and the typhus group (TG: Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi). Rickettsia bellii is the
earliest diverging lineage in the genus and is a member of the
ancestral group Rickettsia.

As more and more genomes are sequenced, it is becoming
increasingly clear that obligate host-associated bacteria are
not immune to the spread of genetic parasites. All kinds of
mobile elements, plasmids, integrated conjugative elements,
prophages and transposons have been identified in one or
another species of intracellular bacteria [6,8]. In fact, the
most highly repeated bacterial genome identified to date is
that of an obligate intracellular pathogen, namely Orientia
tsutsugamushi [9]. This genome contains about 37% repetitive sequences (>200 bp), most of which represent clusters of
deteriorating genes for conjugative transfer systems and
eukaryotic-like proteins putatively involved in host cell adaptation processes [9]. The intracellular arena hypothesis posits
that the transfer of mobile genetic elements occurs in these
populations but is restricted to intracellular bacterial communities that infect the same hosts [8]. One expectation from
this hypothesis is that the circulating pool of mobile elements
may be different for free-living and intracellular bacterial
populations. Another prediction is that the recent evolutionary history of mobile elements in intracellular bacteria follows host specialization patterns rather than the phylogeny of
the bacterial core genes.
With the growing realization that mobile genetic elements are
circulating among obligate host-associated bacteria, it is time
to revisit the source of the many pseudogenes in these bacterial populations. The genus Rickettsia represents an excellent
model system for such studies; genome sizes are small while
pseudogene contents are high. Furthermore, the availability
of genomic data from multiple Rickettsia spp. [4,10-13], now
also including the closely related outgroup species O. tsutsugamushi [9], and the more distantly related outgroup Wolbachia pipientis from Drosophila melanogaster [14] and
Brugia malayi [15], provides all of the raw material needed
for such a study. Because we wished to study the deterioration
process over time, we placed the analyses within a phylogenetic context, with the underlying species tree essentially as
outlined previously [16,17] with three main groups: the spot-

Previous studies of pseudogenes have either traced the degradation pathway of a few individual genes [18-21] or identified
pseudogenes en masse, ignoring the various stages of the degradation process [1]. With the aid of our recently developed
software for visualization and comparison of closely related
genomes, we have performed a large-scale analysis of the
deterioration process, in order to investigate the source and
the ancestral function of the variable segments in Rickettsia.
This study was implemented to provide a general model for
the evolution of host-adapted bacterial genomes, including
lineage-specific expansion and deterioration of host-interaction genes. We also sought to understand better the connection between the load of pseudogenes and the spread of
selfish genetic elements.
The results suggest that the variability among Rickettsia
genomes is due to a slow and steady accumulation of mutations in essential genes, as well as to a more rapid degradation
of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer at the base of
the Rickettsia lineage. In addition, the circulation of genetic
parasites across the modern species continues to generate
variability.

Results
Identification of positional orthologs
We developed GenComp for the visualization of gene order
structures and pseudogene relationships across multiple
closely related genomes. The program was applied to a comparative analysis of eight Rickettsia genomes and a closely
related outgroup, O. tsutsugamushi, plus the more distantly
related outgroup W. pipientis. We first predicted open reading frames (ORFs) with the aid of Glimmer [22] using similar
settings for all genomes. Homolog identification across the
seven most closely related Rickettsia genomes (excluding R.
bellii) was accomplished by basic local alignment search tool
(BLAST) searches [23] followed by clustering with the aid of
Tribe-MCL [24]. A total of 9,450 Glimmer-predicted ORFs
were clustered into 2,940 homologous gene families when
applying the length ratio criteria 0.80 for homologous
groups, with up to 59 genes in each family, including 359 single-gene families.
Information about gene location was considered with the aid
of the visualization component of GenComp to identify the
final set of positional homologs. This resolved many of the
clusters with large numbers of homologs into groups of true
orthologs that are conserved in two to six species or, in the full
set, seven species. The conserved orthologs were fused into

86 metaclusters (segments with conserved gene order structures). These represent from 84% (R. felis) to 93% (R. prowazekii) of the Rickettsia genomes. Present in the metaclusters
were 665 gene families with a cluster size of seven, representing single-copy genes that are conserved in sequence across
all seven taxa, using 80% as the length cut-off value. We refer
to the positional orthologs present in all seven species as the
'R7 core genes'. In total, this set comprises 688 genes, which
accounts for 62% of the TG genomes and 47% to 56% of the
SFG genomes. The mean size of the R7 core genes in Rickettsia was 1,006 to 1,010 bp (median size 850 to 860 bp) per species (typical of bacterial genes; Table 1).

Identification of Rickettsia variable segments
We identified a combined total of 658 Rickettsia intergenic
segments, defined as sequences flanked by orthologs in the
R7 core gene set. These segments represent from 30% of the
TG genomes to 38% of the R. felis genome. Glimmer-predicted ORFs located inside Rickettsia variable segments
(RVSs) and present in one to six species, or present in all
seven species but differing by more than 20% in size, are here
referred to as the 'strain-variable ORFs', irrespectively of
their origin, size, and functional status. An ORF-cluster was
defined as a set of positional homologs conserved across two
or more species. Paralogs located in different genomic
regions were manually sorted into separate ORF-clusters. In
total, 1,160 ORF-clusters were predicted in 304 of the 658
RVSs; these were used as the starting point for all subsequent
analyses, as schematically outlined in Figure 1.
The ORF-containing segments ranged in size from a mean of
510 bp to 854 bp per species (median sizes: 143 bp to 186 bp)
and contained on average 3.82 ORF-clusters per RVS over the
seven species. The longest RVS (reg_id 546) was 19,665 kilobases and contained 29 ORF-clusters in R. felis. The sizes of
the strain-variable ORFs were found to be roughly proportional to the prevalence of the ORF across the various species.
Thus, strain-variable ORFs identified in six members exhibited a mean gene size of 976 bp (median 744 bp), whereas the
mean size of strain-variable ORFs solely present in two species was only 332 bp (median 219 bp), which is only 30% of
the R7 core gene size (Table 1).

Rapid sequence evolution of strain-variable ORFs
The nonsynonymous substitution frequency (dN) ranged
from 0.5 to 6.3 × 10-2 substitutions per site for the R7 core
genes (Figure 2a). The synonymous substitution frequency
(dS) values were more than tenfold higher than the dN values
in all pair-wise comparisons, which is indicative of purifying
selection. In comparison, the dN values for the strain-variable
ORFs were much more variable, ranging from 0.5 to 18 × 102 nonsynymous substitutions per site (Figure 2a). Median dN
values were inversely related to the prevalence of the ORF
across the seven species and approached the dS values in
some pair-wise comparisons that included only two or three
species. A difference between the R7 core genes and the
strain-variable ORFs in the seven-ortholog clusters was
observed even if only ORFs that are more than 1 kilobase in
size were included (Figure 2b). The smaller size and higher
substitution frequency suggests that many strain-variable
ORFs, particularly those present in a limited set of species,
have evolved as pseudogenes.

Graphical display of the gene fragmentation process
With the aid of the visualization component of GenComp, we
produced graphical images of the positions and relative sizes
of all strain-variable ORFs in the 304 ORF-containing RVSs
(Figure 3; see Additional date file 1 for graphical images of all
RVSs). Note that many of the individual strain-variable ORFs
represent fragments of the same pseudogene, broken up by
indels and stop codons into multiple short ORFs. To follow
the gene deterioration process in detail, we implemented a
digital code to track sequence similarity across the strain-variable ORFs, with the first digits being identical for homologs
within and across genomes and the latter two numbers representing a size index such that ORFs that are more than 80%
similar in length are given the same number. A total of 482 of
the 1,160 ORF-clusters produced significant hits (E < e-10) to
genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) database other than of the seven Rickettsia genomes
used to identify the variable segments. We selected all Rickettsia ORFs for which multiple gene alignments with
homologs in other species could be created for an in-depth
analysis; this amounted to 469 of the 482 strain-variable
ORF-clusters and 681 of the 688 R7 core genes.

ters included strain-variable ORFs that are present in members of the SFG but not in the TG (Figure 3c). This was the
largest set, including 215 ORF-clusters, 76 of which have
homologs in all members of the SFG. Another 28 strain-variable ORFs were solely present in R. felis and R. akari, and 26
ORFs only in R. conori, R. sibirica, and R. rickettsii. Visual
inspection of the erosion patterns in this set provides many
examples of how a long ORF in one species, typically R. felis,
has been disrupted into numerous short sequence fragments
in the other species. The final set included 148 strain-variable
ORFs identified in only a single Rickettsia sp., 115 of which
were solely present in R. felis; many of these encoded transposons and other mobile elements (Figure 3d).

Substitution frequency at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites plotted
by genes present in different numbers of species. The nonsynonymous
substitution frequency (dN) values were plotted against the synonymous
substitution frequency (dS) values for (a) R7 core genes and strainvariable open reading frames (ORFs) present in two to seven species and
(b) core genes and strain-variable ORFs present in seven species that are
longer than one kilobase in size.

To illustrate the fragmentation patterns, we sorted the strainvariable ORFs into four sets depending on the different species distribution profiles (Table 2). One set of 75 ORF-clusters
contained homologs across all seven species, as exemplified
in Figure 3a. Many strain-variable ORFs in this set were only
weakly mutated (slightly shorter with only a few indels or
internal termination codons compared with their full-length
homologs in other species), suggesting that they may encode
functional or semifunctional gene products in some species.
Another set encompassed 31 strain-variable ORFs in 18 segments (Figure 3b), including 27 ORF-clusters present in the
TG plus some but not all members of the SFG, as well as four
ORF-clusters uniquely present in the TG. A third set of clus-

The strain-variable ORFs were then mapped onto the species
phylogenetic tree to estimate the node at which it had been
vertically inherited (Figure 4). To this end, core genes and
strain-variable ORFs were separately grouped into different
phylogroups. The R7 class contained ORFs without homologs
in R. bellii, O. tsutsugamushi, or W. pipientis; the R8 class
had homologs in R. bellii only; the RO class also in O. tsutsugamushi; and the ROW* class in O. tsutsugamushi and/or W.
pipientis (E < e-10; see Additional data file 2). The results of
this categorization revealed a dramatic difference between
strain-variable ORFs and core genes, as summarized in Figure 4. Thus, 72% of the strain-variable ORFs were placed in
the R7 and R8 classes, 9% in the RO class, and only 19%
belonged to the ROW* class. The converse pattern was
observed for the core genes; only 21% belonged to the R7 and
R8 classes, and 62% traced back to the ROW* ancestor.

Strain-variable ORFs in the R7 and R8 phylogroups are
present in fewer Rickettsia spp. and are more degraded
than strain-variable ORFs in the ROW* phylogroup
The extent of degradation was different for strain-variable
ORFs placed at different nodes in the tree (Table 2). In brief,
strain-variable ORFs in the ROW* class were often weakly
mutated and normally present in all or most Rickettsia spp.,
whereas strain-variable ORFs in the R7 and R8 classes tended
to be heavily degraded or only present in a single Rickettsia
sp. For example, 32% of the 89 strain-variable ORFs in the
ROW* class were present in all seven Rickettsia spp., whereas
only one strain-variable ORF in the R7 phylogroup had
homologs in all species. The RO class also contained a high
proportion, 34%, of strain-variable ORFs with homologs in all
Rickettsia spp., whereas strain-variable ORFs placed in the
R8 phylogroup exhibited a more scattered species distribution pattern. Taken together, 71% of the strain-variable ORFs
solely present in the SFG belonged to the R8 class, although
they represent no more than 46% of the ORFs overall. The R7
class was even more biased in that 52% of the 48 strain-variable ORFs in the R7 phylogroup were members of a single
species and another 40% were present solely in the SFG.

Figure 3 (see variable segments using the GenComp visualization tool
Visualization ofprevious page)
Visualization of variable segments using the GenComp visualization tool. Segments are shown that contain variable open reading frames (ORFs) that are
present in (a) all seven species, (b) in most but not all species, (c) in members of the spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia, and (d) in a single species. The
visualization tool displays (in blue) the location of positional orthologs that are conserved across all seven Rickettsia spp. and differ by less than 20% in size.
Interspersed among these are segments with strain-variable ORFs shown (in green) that differ in sizes and are normally present in only a subset of the
Rickettsia spp. Vertical lines show positional orthologs and horizontal lines indicate the six frames (+1, +2, +3, -1, -2, and -3, in that order). Each set of six
lines represents a species, with R. prowazekii (Rp), R. typhi (Rt), R. felis (Rf), R. akari (Ra), R. conorii (Rc), R. sibirica (Rs), and R. rickettsii (Rr) shown from the
top to the bottom, in accordance with their phylogenetic relationships. Numbers inside boxes show ORF numbers, and designations above boxes show
gene annotations. The first digits in the numbers below the boxes indicate homologous strain-variable ORFs that are members of the same ORF-cluster,
and the last two digits indicate ORFs in the ORF-clusters that differ by less than 80% in size. Arrows illustrate the fragmentation process for sequences
that are similar across species.

Strain-variable ORFs in the R7 and R8 phylogroups are
associated with different functional categories than
strain-variable ORFs in the ROW* phylogroup
With the aid of a classification scheme based on clusters of
orthologous groups of proteins (COGs)-based classification
scheme, we analyzed the distribution of functional categories
for genes and pseudogenes belonging to different phylogroups (Tables 3 and 4). The 89 strain-variable ORFs in the
ROW* class exhibited a broad functional distribution profile
according to COG classification (Table 3), much like the core
genes inherited from the ROW* ancestor (Table 4). Both
strain-variable ORFs and core genes in the ROW* phylogroup
exhibited a relatively high abundance of genes in categories
such as translation, replication, and energy production, as
observed previously [17].
The R7 and R8 phylogroups showed strong functional bias.
Interestingly, the large majority of the strain-variable ORFs
(69%) and the core genes (54%) in the R8 phylogroup represented unknown or poorly characterized genes. Although
these hypothetical ORFs may include gene prediction errors,
a similar fraction of unknowns was observed in the core
genes, suggesting that they represent current or ancestral
genes of unknown function. Three functional categories - 'cell
wall biosynthesis', 'replication', and 'defense mechanisms' dominated among the rest of ORFs in these phylogroups. For
example, 32 of the 146 core genes in the R8 class represent
components of the cell wall that were possibly shed from Orientia and Wolbachia [17]. A total of 20 strain-variable ORFs
belonged to this category, ten of which were placed in the R8
and three in the R7 phylogroup. These include genes for
lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, which may have been
acquired at the base of the Rickettsia lineage.

Strain-variable ORFs in the R7 and R8 phylogroups
contain an over-representation of mobile genetic
elements
The large majority of strain-variable ORFs in the R7 and R8
classes represents mobile genetic elements and their associated genes, many of which were classified into the COG categories 'replication and repair' or 'defence mechanisms'.
Altogether, these two categories contained 44 strain-variable
ORFs, which account for 30% to 50% of strain-variable ORFs
with a COG-based functional assignment in the R7 and R8

classes, respectively. These genes include transposases,
phage genes, plasmid genes and genes for DNA helicases,
RNA helicases, and different types of DNA restriction-modification enzymes. Many more mobile genes were identified in
the Rickettsia genomes, but were either unclassified or represented poorly characterized genes, or were categorized in the
RO or ROW* classes because of the presence of distant
homologs in O. tsutsugamushi and W. pipientis. The latter
include numerous strain-variable ORFs for ankyrin repeat
and TPR repeat proteins that are normally associated with
conjugative transfer elements in O. tsutsugamushi [8] and
phage genes in W. pipientis [14].
To search systematically for remnants of mobile genetic elements, we extracted already identified phage and conjugative
transfer genes in the individual genomes and BLASTed these
against all of the other genomes. Genes for conjugative transfer encoded by the tra operon have been identified on the R.
felis plasmid as well as on the chromosomes of R. felis, R.
bellii, and O. tsutsugamushi. Using the tra operon as the
query, we analyzed each genome for remnants of such genes.
No evidence of conjugative transfer genes or remnants of
such genes was observed in any of the other Rickettsia
genomes nor in W. pipientis. The explanation may be that the
tra gene cluster has been horizontally transmitted into or
across R. felis, R. belli, and O. tsutsugamushi. Indeed, a phylogenetic analysis of the tra genes present in R. bellii, R. felis,
and O. tsutsugamushi showed that the order of divergence
was different from the species divergence pattern (data not
shown), as was also observed in a recent survey of the Rickettsia massiliae genome [25].
We also observed phage-related genes of the HK97 family in
a few RVS with multiple strain-variable ORFs. For example,
flanking a gene encoding a HK97 phage portal protein in
RVS-308 were five duplicated genes putatively encoding cell
surface antigens in R. felis. In RVS-552 we identified a long
stretch of 13 ORFs in R. felis, all of which have homologs in R.
bellii and six of which (including a copy of the gene for the
HK97 phage major capsid protein) have homologs also in O.
tsutsugamushi and W. pipientis. Interestingly, not only the
sequence but also the order of genes was preserved. None of
these six genes, or remnants thereof, was present in any of the
other Rickettsia spp. Although no intact prophage was found,

the identification of phage genes in the variable Rickettsia
segments suggests that bacteriophages are circulating in the
Rickettsia population.
Finally, we examined in greater detail the 48 strain-variable
ORFs identified in the R7 class, which represents putative
horizontal gene transfers into individual Rickettsia spp. and
clades, although it cannot be excluded that they were
acquired at the base of the Rickettsia lineage followed by species-specific losses. These include a long stretch of genes in
RVS-422 that were solely identified in R. prowazekii and
encode resolvase-like proteins, transposases, and ankyrinrepeat proteins. Also present in the TG were multiple genes
encoding proteins with glycosyltransferase domains in RVS626, one of which represents the 5' half of a longer gene with
two such domains in the other Rickettsia spp. None of these
have a close homolog in the Rickettsiales, but were related to
glycosyltransferases in distantly related species such as Geobacter spp. and Vibrio cholerae. The genes RP336/RT0325
and RP337/RT0326 have adjacent homologs in V. cholerae.
The SFG and transitional group clades shared gene remnants
for aminoglucoside phosphotransferase and acyltransferases.
In addition, these clades had unique strain-variable ORFs
associated with mobile elements, which encoded products
such as lyase, DNA-damage inducible proteins, type I restriction-modification enzyme, transposase, and plasmid
stabilization proteins. Twenty strain-variable ORFs in the R7
group were only present in R. felis; these included an exochitinase, a biotin synthase gene bioB, and mobile elements such
as a mutator-type transposase (similarity to Psychrobacter),
which was located in six different RVS fragments. The only
strain-variable ORF with remnants in all species was the
metK gene, which encodes S-adenosylmethionine synthetase.

Number of R7 core genes and strain-variable ORFs placed at different

(open boxes) and strain-variable open reading frames (ORFs; black boxes)
are indicated at each node of the tree. Arrows show the nodes that
contain the majority of core genes (ROW*) and strain-variable ORFs (R8).
Species abbreviations are as in Figure 3, plus Ot (O. tsutsugamushi), wMel
(W. pipientis [Drosophila melanogaster]), and wBm (W. pipientis [Brugia
malayia]). The underlying phylogenetic tree was constructed using the
maximum likelihood method from a concatenated alignment of adenylate
kinase, SecY, and ribosomal proteins S3, S8, S10, S11, S13, S14, S19 and
L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L14, L16, L18, L22, L23, L24 and L29.

Strain-variable ORFs and core genes in the R7 and R8
phylogroups have different proportions of closest
proteobacterial relatives
To investigate how the differences in functionality relate to
the putative source of the sequences in the R7 and R8 phylogroups, we inferred the closest relatives from the taxonomic
classification of the most similar sequences, excluding Rickettsia, Orientia, and Wolbachia (Table 5). The R7 class was
dominated by proteobacteria-like sequences, with 17 out of 35
owing similarity to γ-proteobacteria. Overall, the proteobacteria-like sequences accounted for 73% of strain-variable
ORFs in the R7 class, and 11% to 12% of strain-variable ORFs
and core genes in the R8 phylogroups. The lower proportion
of proteobacteria-like sequences in the R8 classes is due to
the high numbers of strain-variable ORFs (60%) and core
genes (38%) that are specific to Rickettsia with no identifiable
homolog outside the genus. A total of 80 strain-variable ORFs
and 80 core genes in the R8 class exhibited sequence similar-

To study the pattern of gene degradation, we developed a program for the identification and visualization of positional
pseudogenes in multiple, related species. Previously developed software for the identification of strain-variable regions
such as tRNAcc [26] and Islander [27] are based on highthroughput systematic interrogation of tRNA and transfer
mRNA genes, which act as hotspots for insertions of temperate phages and pathogenicity islands [28]. The tRNAcc
approach identified 49 genomic islands in the vicinity of 18
tRNA genes in Escherichia coli and Shigella, representing as
much as 1.7 megabases of these genomes [26]. Islander was
applied to the analysis of 106 bacterial genomes of different
phylogenetic affiliation, with 95% of the islands identified in
Firmicutes, and α- and γ-proteobacteria [27]. However,
Islander failed to identify strain-variable regions in about half
of the genomes examined, including all obligate pathogens
and endosymbionts.
Yet another program for the identification of variable segments is IslandPath, which searches for horizontally acquired
DNA by profiling GC contents and dinucleotide composition
patterns of individual genes and clusters of genes [29]. However, because variability may not only be caused by gene
acquisitions, but also by species-specific gene degradation
processes, strain-variable segments will go unrecognized if
nucleotide and codon usage statistics of the gene remnants
temporarily appear normal. Thus, programs such as tRNAcc
[26], Islander [27], and IslandPath [29] are not useful for the
analysis of the genomes of intracellular bacteria in which the
deteriorating ORFs are neither flanked by integrases or
tRNAs nor exhibit atypical GC-content statistics.
The application of our program, GenComp, to a visualization
study of eight complete genome sequences of Rickettsia has
unveiled a mosaic of conserved core genes for basic cellular
functions interspersed with segments containing complete
and deteriorating genes that are variably present across species. The novelty of the findings reported here is that as much
as 75% of the variable genes and pseudogenes in Rickettsia
have no homologs in either O. tsutsugamushi or W. pipientis.
Many of these are extensively degraded or represent mobile
genetic elements and their associated genes. Although some
genes such as those for cell wall biosynthesis may have been
lost from the outgroup species, we believe that a majority of
the variably present and deteriorating genes entered at the
base of the Rickettsia lineage. A smaller subset seems to be
circulating across some of the modern Rickettsia spp. in a
manner that is inconsistent with vertical inheritance. Collectively, the results suggest that a substantial fraction of the var-

The phylogroup ROW* is a summary of ROW, RW, W and OW. ORF, open reading frame

iability in gene content and extent of deterioration is
accounted for by horizontal gene transfers into the genus
Rickettsia.
In total, we identified 688 R7 core genes and 1,160 ORF-clusters, with 469 of the ORF-clusters containing easily recognizable homologs in species outside the R7-class. Although the
aim of this analysis was not to quantify the total number of
ancestral genes in Rickettsia, our minimal and maximum
estimates of 1,157 and 1,848 ORF-clusters in the rickettsial
ancestor, respectively, are consistent with previous inferences of 1,252 to 1,650 ancestral genes [30]. Our visualization
analysis has shown that the fragmentation process often
involves segments with multiple pseudogenes, in accordance
with the suggestion that lost genes are clustered more frequently than expected by chance [30]. With only a few exceptions, we found no tendency for genes with similar functions

to be clustered in the same segment. Rather, the deletions
appear to cover blocks of genes in some species whereas in
others they are best explained by independent small deletions
in neighbouring genes, putatively acquired by horizontal gene
transfer.
Another observation is that the rate of evolution is related to
the species distribution patterns such that genes present in
fewer Rickettsia spp. tend to accumulate more substitutions
than those present in more species. One explanation for a
faster rate of evolution for horizontally transferred genes is
positive selection and adaptation [31]. However, because we
observed a correlation between limited species distribution
patterns, high substitution frequencies, and small ORF sizes,
we believe that most of the enhancement in the rate of evolution is due to degenerative processes.

The phylogroup ROW* is a summary of ROW, RW, W and OW.

For many of the heavily deteriorating genes, remnants were
identified in the SFG Rickettsia but not in the TG Rickettsia.
The presence of homologs in R. bellii suggests that these
genes were acquired at the base of the Rickettsia, with subsequent loss in the TG Rickettsia. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that some of the gene acquisitions at the early stage of
rickettsial evolution conferred functions that facilitated invasion and spread into novel arthropod hosts, or into multiple
tissues of an already infected host. Upon subsequent host
switches and/or niche adaptation, this early set of acquired
genes may have become superfluous, leading to gene degradation and elimination. This is consistent with the observation that species with a restricted host range, such as R.
prowazekii, exhibit extensive gene loss. Among the few genes
present in the variable segments of the TG but not the SFG

Rickettsia are duplicated genes for glucosyltransferases and
enzymes involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
Some of the variably present genes, mostly mobile elements
such as transposons, conjugative transfer elements, and their
associated genes, may represent recent gene transfers into
individual lineages. The insertion of these at unique locations
in the genome with no indications of remnants in any of the
other species supports a recent integration rather than acquisition at the base of the lineage and loss in all other species.
The bias for loss of recently gained genes in Rickettsia is consistent with computational inferences of insertion/deletion
rates based on gene presence/absence data in other bacterial
species [32,33]. For example, a study of 13 completely
sequenced genomes from Bacillus showed that there are

Gene acquisition depends on the availability of mobile elements that can mediate the transfers, whereas the probability
for retention is determined by the mutation bias along with
selection and drift. Therefore, the transfer-deterioration
process is expected be particularly high in bacterial species
that contain plasmids or are exposed to bacteriophages.
Recent gene acquisitions in Rickettsia appear to have been
mediated by plasmids, discovered in R. felis, R. monocensis
[34], and several additional Rickettsia spp. isolated from
ticks [35]. Species that lack plasmids (for example, R. prowazekii) exhibit a much lower incidence of recent gene acquisitions than the plasmid-bearing species R. felis.

Previous studies of the R. felis plasmid genes revealed that 38
of the 68 pRF plasmid genes have no chromosomal homologs
and are not present in the SFG Rickettsia, although 18 of
these show homology to other bacterial proteins [16]. Plasmid
genes with chromosomal homologs show mostly an evolutionary relationship with earlier diverging species, such as R.
bellii, although the chromosomal homolog may support the
expected relationships with other Rickettsia spp. [16]. Our
phylogenetic analysis of the tra genes is fully consistent with
this pattern, by showing that the conjugative system on the R.
felis plasmid diverged earlier than the chromosomally
encoded tra genes in R. bellii and O. tsutsugamushi. This was
also observed in a recent phylogenetic analysis of the tra cluster genes [25]. Traces of the tra genes could not be identified
in the other five Rickettsia spp. And neither in W. pipientis.

more genes coming in and going out at the tips of the phylogeny than at the deeper nodes, suggesting that most of the laterally transferred genes are lost shortly after their insertion
[33]. In our study, genes of unknown or general function prediction was found to be lost more frequently than expected by
chance alone. A trivial explanation for the apparent high turnover rate of genes of unknown function at the tips of the tree
may be false gene predictions. This is almost certainly one
aspect of the problem; the visualization profiles of the Rickettsia genomes confirm that many short ORFs located in
immediate proximity to each other (previously annotated as
different genes) represent short fragments of one and the
same gene. For example, the annotated R. conorii genes
RC0215, RC0216, RC0217, and RC0218 are short fragments
of the longer positional homolog RP174 in R. prowazekii (see
Additional data file 1; Reg_id 5). However, false gene predictions cannot be the sole explanation because a more rapid
deterioration of genes acquired at the base of the Rickettsia
lineage was observed even if counting ORF-clusters with
homologs to species outside the R7 class instead of individual
ORFs. Thus, our results from Rickettsia suggest a low residence time for horizontally transferred genes of yet unknown
function.

Although some species of Wolbachia and Rickettsia infect the
same arthropod host, these two genera do not share the same
mobile gene pool; plasmids are the vehicle of choice in Rickettsia whereas bacteriophages dominate in Wolbachia. Thus,
in contrast to free-living micro-organisms such as
Escherichia coli [36], species-specific ORFs are not derived
from bacteriophages. However, the co-transferred genes
encode proteins in the same broad families, such as for example ankyrin and TPR repeat proteins. The taxonomic distribution of species containing the most similar sequences outside
the Rickettsiales was different for core genes and strain-variable ORFs, with a higher fraction of non-α-proteobacterial
relatives for strain-variable ORFs. However, the phylogenetic
analyses indicated fairly distant evolutionary relationship
(data not shown), which might suggest transfers via yet unsequenced bacteria and their plasmids.
Taken together, the findings of our analysis suggest that the
likelihood for a rickettsial gene that does not have homologs
in Wolbachia or Orientia to be degraded is at least three times
as high as that for a gene that has been vertically inherited
since the divergence of the three genera. Our estimate of deteriorating horizontal transfers in Rickettsia corresponds well
with a global 'failed horizontal transfer index' of 2.3, which
means that 'pseudogenes' are 2.3 times more likely to arise
from horizontal transfer than vertically inherited core genes
[1]. However, at the detailed level there are large inconsisten-

cies between the two studies. Whereas we identified hundreds
of pseudogenes and gene fragments in the R. conorii genome
using GenComp, only nine were detected by the prokaryotic
pseudogene pipeline, none of which was inferred to have been
acquired by horizontal gene transfer [1]. The discrepancy in
gene numbers and origin of acquisition suggests that comparative genomics methods are superior for the identification
and analyses of pseudogenes and gene fragments.

specific genes and pseudogenes will increase with every
genome added, perhaps even exponentially for populations
with open pan-genome structures. Understanding their origin, function, and survival rate is an important task for future
research. This creates a need for better ways to compare and
visualize the genomic data from closely related species. We
are convinced that the GenComp software and other similar
programs will demonstrate their utility in future pangenomic surveys.

The analysis presented here also explains the puzzling observation that the median size of R. conorii proteins is only 173
amino acids, thereby the shortest of bacterial proteins, as
compared with a median size of 267 amino acids estimated
from 191,541 bacterial proteins [37]. We have estimated the
median size of the R7 core proteins in R. conorii to be 284
amino acids, which is equal to the median size of R. prowazekii proteins and slightly higher than the global bacterial
protein size estimate [37]. Thus, the previously estimated
short size of the R. conorii proteins is that it was markedly
influenced by the short sizes of the many pseudogenes
present in this genome. The overall variability in protein size
among bacterial species has been attributed to different adaptations to stress, temperature, protection, and other environmental factors [37]. A simpler explanation is different
proportions of pseudogenes and gene fragments (of different
sizes) in the genome annotation lists. Because 2,300 of an
estimated 6,895 candidate pseudogenes in prokaryotic
genomes overlap with more than 2,600 annotated hypothetical ORFs [1], attempts to determine mean and median
bacterial protein sizes from genome sequence data are likely
to yield underestimates, unless the annotated gene lists have
first been decontaminated for pseudogenes.

Conclusion

We have presented a visualization tool for the comparison of
pseudogenes in multiple closely related species. The tool
assigns a number to each individual ORF to indicate its relative size and the ORF-cluster to which it belongs. The
application of this tool to the analyses of the variably present
genes and pseudogenes in Rickettsia has implications for our
understanding of genome reduction in intracellular bacteria.
Variably present ORFs account for 30% to 40% of the rickettsial genomes and a majority of these represents mobile
genetic elements and associated genes acquired by horizontal
gene transfers. This explains the paradox of the high pseudogene content despite the small sizes of the Rickettsia
genomes.
Our visualization of the rickettsial pseudogenes has highlighted one of the major hurdles in gene prediction, namely
how to automate pseudogene identification and distinguish
genes from spurious ORFs [38-43]. Over the next ten years,
thousands of bacterial pathogens will have their genome
sequenced and hundreds or thousands of isolates from these
species will routinely be examined. The number of species-

Materials and methods
Genome sequence data
Genome sequence data were downloaded from NCBI, including genome data for R. prowazekii [4], R. typhi [10], R.
conorii [11], R. felis [12], R. belli [13], R. sibirica (AC =
NZ_AABW00000000), R. akari (AC = NC_00981), and R.
rickettsii (AC = NC_00982).

Positional matching of genes and strain-variable ORFs
Gene prediction of the Rickettsia genomes was accomplished
using Glimmer2 [22]. The ORF sequences were extracted,
translated, and BLASTed against each other in all possible
combinations using BLASTP [23]. The resulting BLAST file
output, which contains true orthologs, paralogs and false hits,
was fed into Tribe-MCL to cluster all homologs into gene families [24]. These were resolved semi-automatically into
orthologous gene clusters by a series of steps, as outlined
below.
We first applied a simple ratio-rating test to the Tribe-MCL
gene families, in which ORFs were partitioned by size. The
ORF length ratio was set to 80% in pair-wise genome comparisons. In analyses that included multiple genomes, we measured the length ratios in all-against-all comparisons within
ORF families and produced a ratio-rating matrix. The gene
families were sorted into subgroups by partitioning the
matrix recursively according to length ratio similarities. Next,
the neighbor-joining method was applied to the dataset to
resolve the gene families further. It is important to recall that
both operations retain the same total number of ORFs, but
that these are resolved into an increasing number of gene
families, each of which contains ORFs of increasingly similar
gene sizes and sequences. Finally, we manually inspected the
obtained gene order information using the graphical viewer
(see below) to distinguish true orthologs from in-paralogs.
The gene sequences in the metaclusters as well as the
sequences in the intervening segments were automatically
extracted for analysis of substitution frequencies and other
statistics.

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Pair-wise sequence alignments of positional orthologs and
positional pseudogenes were done using ClustalW [44] from
protein sequences that were reconverted to in-frame DNA
alignments. Substitution frequency estimates were obtained

by the method of Yang and Nielsen in PAML [45]. The
sequences of the intervening segments, including strain-variable ORFs, were searched for sequence similarity using
tblastx, version 2.2.8 [23] against a nonredundant bacterial
genome database (March 2005) downloaded from the NCBI
bacterial genome ftp site [46]. The best hit (BeTs; E < 10-10)
was recorded for each segment and in segments with multiple
ORFs for each ORF individually. A reference set of sequences
that yielded top hits to species other than the α-proteobacteria were aligned with all of their homologous genes (E < 10-10)
using ClustalW [44] (gap-opening penalty: 10; gap extension
penality: 0.05) and protein distance estimates were recorded.
Phylogenetic trees were computed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in PHYML [47].

visualize the data are available from the GenComp website
[48].

Implementation
The GenComp software was crafted to enable systematic comparisons of multiple genomes on a genome scale from an evolutionary point of view. The software was based on a MySQL
database server and the main scripting language was Python
and Perl with biopython and bioperl libraries. The interface
was implemented in Tkinter, which uses Python as a gluing
language to Tkinter and to the database. The main virtue of
having all information in a DBMS (database management
system) is the ease of access to all data and the ability for
crosstalk across various sources of data. Annotated genomes
in the form of sequences and annotations from NCBI or in
multifasta format were stored in the database and used for
reference to other scripts for computing. GenComp uses a
number of different scripts and common programs such as
Glimmer, BLAST, Tribe-MCL, ClustalW, PAML YN00,
PHYLIP, and scripts developed in-house to process the data.
The entire genomes under study are fed into the system and
then semi-automatically processed, guided by the user. Data
and tables are redrawn from the system by scripts written in
SQL and Python, sometimes interchangeably to call the database guided by previous analysis and result. The final result of
an analysis session is a table exported to Excel for further
processing or graphing. Sometimes external graphing software is used, such as Origin Pro or Gnuplot.

Graphical viewer
We developed a graphical viewer to visualize the order, sizes,
and relationships of ORFs in the intervening segments. Positional orthologs were indicated with lines that span across all
ORFs in each orthologous cluster. The gene names for orthologous clusters and for ORFs in the intervening segments were
shown in the graphical viewer if annotations were available in
the annotation file from NCBI. ORFs in the intervening segments were indexed to indicate gene family according to
Tribe-MCL in cases in which ORFs were located at the homologous position but varied in size as expected, for example
positional pseudogenes. The index is split into two parts, in
which the first part indicates gene family and the second part
length ratio. The scripts developed in-house to process and
