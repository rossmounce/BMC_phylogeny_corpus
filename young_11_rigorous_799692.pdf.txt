Rigorous and thorough bioinformatic analyses of
olfactory receptor promoters confirm enrichment
of O/E and homeodomain binding sites but
reveal no new common motifs
Janet M Young1*, Ralf M Luche1,2 and Barbara J Trask1

Abstract
Background: Mammalian olfactory receptors (ORs) are subject to a remarkable but poorly understood regime of
transcriptional regulation, whereby individual olfactory neurons each express only one allele of a single member of
the large OR gene family.
Results: We performed a rigorous search for enriched sequence motifs in the largest dataset of OR promoter
regions analyzed to date. We combined measures of cross-species conservation with databases of known
transcription factor binding sites and ab initio motif-finding algorithms. We found strong enrichment of binding
sites for the O/E family of transcription factors and for homeodomain factors, both already known to be involved
in the transcriptional control of ORs, but did not identify any novel enriched sequences. We also found that TATAboxes are present in at least a subset of OR promoters.
Conclusions: Our rigorous approach provides a template for the analysis of the regulation of large gene families
and demonstrates some of the difficulties and pitfalls of such analyses. Although currently available bioinformatics
methods cannot detect all transcriptional regulatory elements, our thorough analysis of OR promoters shows that
in the case of this gene family, experimental approaches have probably already identified all the binding factors
common to large fractions of OR promoters.

Background
Mammals can detect and discriminate many thousands of
odorous molecules in our environments using millions of
neurons in the olfactory epithelium. These neurons
express members of one of the largest gene families in the
mammalian genome, the olfactory receptors (ORs) [1]. In
mouse, this gene family comprises ~1150 apparently functional genes and ~300 pseudogenes [2,3] (Additional File
1). As a result of the gene family’s ongoing expansion by
tandem duplication, most mouse ORs are found in the
genome in clusters of up to ~300 genes with ORFs spaced

~21 kb apart on average [2]. Although some clear one-toone orthologs can be identified across species, extensive
post-speciation duplication has resulted in many ORs having one-to-many or many-to-many orthologous relationships. Phylogenetic trees show that ORs can be divided
into two major classes, class I and class II ORs [4] (with
~130 and ~1020 intact ORs in mouse, respectively). While
the ligands recognized by most mouse ORs remain
unknown, available odorant-response profiles suggest that
class I ORs recognize odorants that are more hydrophilic
than those recognized by class II [5].
Each neuron in the olfactory epithelium expresses only
one member of the OR gene family; furthermore, only
one of the two parental alleles of the selected OR is
expressed in each cell [6-8]. Individual OR genes are

therefore expressed in only a small subset of the neurons
of the olfactory epithelium. This “singular” mode of
expression ensures that different neurons respond to different odorants and that a distinct pattern of neuronal
activation is generated for each odorant, thereby allowing
for perceptual discrimination. Neurons expressing a
given OR tend to be confined to one of five regions of
the olfactory epithelium (four originally described
“zones” and the “OR37 patch”) [9-11], although recent
studies suggest that these zones are less clearly defined
than previously thought and can partially overlap [12].
Each cell’s choice among the set of “zone-appropriate”
ORs appears to be stochastic [6,9]. However, some ORs
are expressed in many more cells and/or at higher percell levels than others [8,9,13], implying that some ORs
may have “stronger” promoters than others.
Transgene studies have shown that a small region of a
few hundred base pairs upstream of the OR transcription
start site (TSS) can act as a minimal promoter to drive
transcription of a reporter construct in a pattern that
seems mostly faithful to that of the endogenous gene,
although occasional differences are observed in zonal
restriction of transgenes [14-16]. It therefore seems reasonable to expect that regions close to the TSS will contain functional sequence motifs involved in transcriptional
activation of OR genes. One might expect the existence of
transcription factors common to all ORs and/or transcription factors specific for different subsets of ORs, perhaps
those expressed in certain zones of the olfactory epithelium, or certain phylogenetic subfamilies such as class I or
class II ORs.
Two classes of transcription factors have been identified
that appear important in OR activation: the O/E family
and homeodomain proteins. Binding sites for O/E and
homeodomain proteins have been identified in many OR
promoter regions, both experimentally and using bioinformatic methods [14,16-21]. The O/E family comprises four
helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors that are
expressed throughout the olfactory epithelium: O/E-1
(also known as Olf-1, Ebf1), O/E-2, O/E-3 and O/E-4
[22,23]. The four family members appear to have similar
DNA recognition specificities and may form heterodimers
with one another. The pattern of expression in non-olfactorytissues differs between the four O/E family members,
as does their strength of transcriptional activation [22,23].
Mice lacking O/E-1, O/E-2 or O/E-3 die prematurely; their
olfactory epithelia appear normal on a gross level, but the
projection of olfactory neurons to the brain appears disrupted, perhaps implying subtle shifts in the expression
pattern of O/E target genes, including ORs [24,25]. The
O/E family members exhibit at least partial redundancy
with one another [22]. A zinc-finger protein, Roaz, might
interact with O/E family members, perhaps preventing
them from acting as transcriptional activators [26].

Two homeodomain proteins are known to be involved
in OR regulation: Lhx2 and Emx2. The LIM-homeodomain protein Lhx2 was first identified as an olfactory transcription factor by virtue of its binding to the promoter
region of one OR, M71 [27]. Studies of mice mutant for
Lhx2 show that it is important for transcription of all class
II ORs but not most class I ORs [28,29]. Notably, the two
class I ORs that were tested whose expression is affected
in Lhx2 knockout mice are normally expressed in a dorsal
region of the olfactory epithelium along with class II ORs,
whereas the unaffected class I genes are normally
expressed in a more ventral region [28]. Lhx2 itself is
expressed throughout the olfactory epithelium, most
strongly in neuronal precursor cells [27]. A second homeodomain protein, Emx2, has also been implicated in OR
transcriptional control. It also binds the M71 promoter
and is expressed throughout the olfactory epithelium [27].
Most OR genes show dramatically reduced transcript
levels in Emx2 knockout mice [30]. A third homeodomain
protein, Dlx5, is important for proper olfactory neuron
axon targeting [31]; one possible explanation is that it is
involved in OR regulation, although OR expression has
not been examined in Dlx5 mutant mice.
Although candidate activation signals common to most
or all ORs have been identified, the singular mode of
expression has not yet been fully explained despite extensive efforts. An enhancer-like element, the “H region” is
required for transcription of its neighboring ORs and
might act as a locus control region (LCR) to select a single
gene for expression from the nearby OR cluster [32]. The
H region also shows nuclear co-localization with promoters of actively transcribed ORs on other chromosomes
[33], leading to the hypothesis that the H region could
also act as an enhancer/LCR in trans for ORs throughout
the genome [33]. However, experiments in mice in which
the H region is deleted show that, while it is essential for
transcription of nearby ORs, it appears dispensable for the
transcription of more distant ORs and ORs on other chromosomes [34,35]. A negative-feedback mechanism might
partially explain the singular mode of expression; once an
OR is chosen for expression (perhaps stochastically), negative feedback seems to operate to prevent transcription
from other OR loci, a mechanism that might involve the
OR protein-coding region to send and/or receive repressive [32,36-38]. Another attractive hypothesis that had
been proposed to explain singular expression is somatic
recombination into an active locus, analogous to the role
of recombination in generating lymphocyte diversity and
singular expression of T-cell receptors and immunoglobulins. However, elegant nuclear transfer experiments show
that recombination is very unlikely to play a role in OR
gene choice [39,40]. Recently published work has shown
that epigenetic marks may play a key role in the mechanism of OR silencing and expression [41].

The goal of the present study is to perform rigorous statistical and bioinformatics analyses on OR promoter
regions in an attempt to identify additional common DNA
sequence motifs that might function in positive or negative
transcriptional control of the gene family. Experimental
studies of OR regulation are inherently difficult, because
cells expressing each OR are rare (~1/1000 neurons) and
dispersed throughout a relatively small tissue. Bioinformatic studies could therefore be a useful complementary
tool. A previous study [20] used ab initio motif-identification tools on 198 mouse OR promoters to show that
motifs similar to O/E and homeodomain sites are enriched
in OR promoters. Our study greatly extends this earlier
work, adding large-scale examination of databases of
known transcription factor binding sites and the powerful
tool of comparative genomics, as well as using a larger
dataset of more than 300 OR promoter sequences.
The identification of functionally important sequences
in a set of promoter regions of interest using bioinformatic
methods is a difficult task, largely due to issues of poor signal-to-noise ratio. Transcription factors tend to recognize
short and often degenerate sequences, making it difficult
to identify over-represented candidate binding sites using
so-called ab initio motif-finding methods. This degeneracy
also makes it difficult to scan a genomic sequence using
known motifs and computationally distinguish true binding sites from false positives. An increasing number of
studies (e.g., [42,43]) have harnessed the power of comparative genomics to help sift signal from noise. Sequences
that are functionally important are often conserved during
evolution, acquiring mutations at a slower rate than nonfunctional sequences, and can thus be recognized in
multi-species alignments as regions with fewer sequence
changes than expected given the phylogenetic relationship
between the species studied [44,45]. Until now, comparative sequence analysis has not been applied in a systematic
way to a large collection of OR promoters.
Together, the approaches we describe here provide a rigorous and thorough examination of enriched and conserved sequences in promoters of the OR gene family. We
found strong evidence supporting the importance of the
O/E family of transcription factors, homeodomain factors
and TATA boxes but found no additional enriched common sequence motifs, indicating that experimental
approaches are more likely to yield the next breakthrough
in the field of OR transcriptional regulation.

Results
General characteristics of OR promoter regions

In order to detect signals in nucleotide sequences that
might be important in controlling OR transcription, we
needed a dataset of well-defined OR transcription start
sites (TSSs). ORs typically have intronless protein-coding
regions, but their 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) usually

Page 3 of 22

contain introns [1,13]. The genomic locations of the 5’
exons, introns and TSSs cannot easily be predicted computationally nor derived from high-throughput EST or
CAGE experiments, which have overlooked OR transcripts due to issues of tissue availability and transcript
abundance. Targeted approaches have therefore been
necessary to yield locations of upstream exons, TSSs and
promoters for the OR genes and have been performed
almost exclusively using mouse tissues.
Michaloski et al. performed 5’-RACE for 198 mouse
ORs; sequences obtained from these RACE products can
be mapped to the mouse genome assembly to yield putative locations for the corresponding TSSs and promoters
[20]. We also collected 5’-RACE data from various other
studies of smaller numbers of ORs (Additional File 2). In
addition, we previously performed a hybridization-based
cDNA library screen to identify putative TSSs for more
than 300 ORs [13]. A potential concern of using cDNAdefined TSSs is that some cDNAs in the library may not
be full-length. Examination of the 90 ORs for which both
RACE-defined and cDNA-defined TSSs are available
shows that EST completeness is not a major concern; in
57/90 (63%) cases the EST- and RACE-defined TSSs map
within 50 bp of one another. In the remaining 33 cases the
RACE sequence(s) RACE data imply a TSS further
upstream than the EST sequence in 21 of those 33 ORs,
but for the other 12, EST sequences extend further
upstream. For an OR gene where different methods or
cDNA clones imply different TSS locations, it is quite possible that several alternate start sites truly exist, as has
been observed for many genes [46]; however, it is also possible that some of the sequenced clones are not full-length.
We have therefore taken the conservative approach of
analyzing only the most upstream TSS predicted for each
gene. Combining all the data sources mentioned above, we
can define putative TSS locations for 432 intact ORs (see
Methods), which represents more than one-third of the
1151 intact OR genes we find in the July 2007 version of
the mouse genome assembly (Additional File 1). Only 26
of these 432 genes are class I ORs (partly due to bias of
the degenerate primers used in both large-scale studies
towards class II ORs [13,20]), whereas 406 are class II
ORs. This primer bias means that the statistical tests we
describe below will be more powerful for class II ORs than
for class I ORs and make comparisons between those two
groups difficult.
Some OR genes are the products of relatively recent
genomic duplications involving a stretch of genomic DNA
that can include the promoter region [47]. It is important
for the statistical validity of many of the analyses we
describe below to include only one member of any group
of recent gene/promoter duplicates, so that (for example) a
transcription factor binding site observed in similar locations in multiple promoter sequences is likely to be

Young et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:561

regionally over-represented due to functional considerations, rather than because those promoters share much of
their sequence due to recent duplication (i.e., we wanted to
ensure independence in our statistical tests). Therefore, we
applied an additional filtering step to the promoter dataset
to ensure that it contained no pairs of recently duplicated
ORs (see Methods). After such filtering, our promoter
dataset contained 314 putative OR TSSs, comprising 24
class I ORs and 290 class II ORs. Although these TSS locations might include a minority that are defined imprecisely
or perhaps even wrongly, in order to keep the following
text as clear as possible, we have omitted the words “putative”, “candidate”, etc., each time we refer to the TSSs we
have analyzed. We performed our analyses on two alternative datasets of regions: (a) the 200-bp region immediately
preceding these TSSs, because many of the functional elements important for transcription should be found close to
the TSS [14,16] and motif searches should be more powerful with smaller sequence sets; and (b) a larger 500-bp
region immediately preceding the TSSs, because it is possible that the biologically active promoter region might be
larger than 200bp for some fraction of the ORs. We refer
to these 200-bp or 500-bp regions below as “promoters”
for simplicity, although this is surely a very rough approximation to the true promoter regions.
These 314 TSSs are 4.2 kb away from their corresponding translational start sites on average (range 200 bp - 24
kb, standard deviation 3.2 kb). Figure 1A shows that repeat
content drops dramatically approaching the predicted
TSSs; fewer than 2% of bases in the last 200 bp before
these TSSs are recognized by RepeatMasker as repetitive
elements. In contrast, cross-species conservation scores
rise approaching the TSS (Figure 1A). These patterns of
repeat content and conservation scores indicate that the
majority of the candidate TSSs are indeed likely to be real.
Considering the 4 kb centered at the TSS, the GC content
of the OR promoter regions averages 36.4%, much lower
than the genome-wide average for mouse of ~42% [48].
The rise and dip in GC content very close to the TSS (Figure 1A) is partly, but not entirely, due to the high frequency of GC-rich O/E sites and AT-rich TATA boxes in
those regions (see below, Figure 1B, 1C). No predicted
CpG islands lie within 2 kb of any of these 314 TSSs. If we
analyze class I and class II ORs separately, these patterns
of GC content, repeat content, conservation score and O/
E and TATA-box enrichment hold for both classes (data
not shown); unfortunately not enough TSSs are defined
for class I genes to rigorously test for differences in the
enrichment levels between classes.
O/E sites and TATA boxes are enriched in OR promoters

We scanned the promoter sequences using a collection of
position weight matrices (PWMs) representing known
transcription factor binding sites. Several such databases

Page 4 of 22

and search algorithms exist; we chose to use the MatBase
database and the corresponding MatInspector search
program [49] (Genomatix Software GmbH, Munich, Germany). As discussed above, most transcription factor
binding sites recognize short, degenerate sequence
motifs, and methods for scanning genomic sequences for
PWM matches suffer from signal-to-noise problems.
Most search algorithms score every position of a genomic
sequence for its similarity to the PWM, and then take
matches exceeding a certain score threshold as candidate
transcription factor binding sites. MatInspector’s default
parameters use an optimized score threshold for each
PWM that is designed to minimize false positives (calibrated by minimizing the number of matches in non-promoter regions) in order to maximize the proportion of
predicted sites that represent true positive calls. Although
this approach is appropriate in some studies (e.g., prior to
time-consuming experimental tests of individual site predictions), minimizing false positives inevitably also results
in a high false-negative rate. In other situations, it might
be more important to minimize false negatives, such that
a less stringent threshold might be appropriate. Our
study is one such situation: the veracity of individual sites
is less important, because statistical methods will be used
to select motifs that are enriched across multiple promoters. We therefore scanned the promoter sequences using
MatInspector’s less stringent score threshold (“opt-0.1”,
see Methods) as well as its optimized score threshold
(referred to below as “opt”). For some matrices, like those
representing O/E (Figure 1B), the reduced stringency
results appear useful, as many more sites are detected
close to the TSS without a high level of background
noise further from the promoter sequence. However, for
other matrices, like those representing the TATA-box,
the background level is prohibitively high when the score
threshold is reduced (Figure 1C).
The MatBase database groups related PWMs into
families to simplify interpretation of results (see Methods).
For every PWM family, we plotted the spatial distribution
of predicted binding sets near TSSs in our dataset. We
first examined the distribution of matches to MatBase’s V
$NOLF family, which comprises two similar matrices
representing binding sites for the O/E family of transcription factors [50], both of which are fairly long (21 and 18
bp) and quite specific. As expected [20], we find a clear
peak of enrichment of O/E sites close to the predicted
TSSs (Figure 1B). Cross-species conservation analysis indicates that most O/E sites predicted even using MatInspector’s less stringent parameters are conserved (Additional
File 3). Thus, for this matrix family, the opt-0.1 predictions
yield a better true-positive rate than the default opt predictions and still do not suffer from a high false-positive rate.
In order to estimate the number of real O/E sites, we used
cross-species conservation to filter MatInspector’s opt-0.1

conservation scores in a 2-kb region surrounding the putative TSSs of 314 ORs. GC content is calculated in 50-bp windows across each
sequence (with a 10-bp slide), then averaged across all sequences in the dataset, plotting values at the center of each window. Interspersed
repeat content was determined by RepeatMasker and the proportion of promoters containing a repeat element at each base position relative to
the TSS was calculated (averaged over 20-bp windows, sliding along promoters 1 bp at a time). An orthologous conservation score was
calculated using SCONE [45]: the value plotted is 1 - P-value (SCONE output, see Methods) and is averaged over 20-bp windows, sliding along
promoters 1 bp at a time. The vertical dashed gray line represents the predicted TSS. Panel B: Distribution of predicted O/E binding sites using

O/E predictions (Additional File 3, Methods). We find that
246 of the 314 200-bp promoters examined (78%) contain
a conserved O/E site in the 200 bp closest to the TSS;
many promoters contain more than one such site (range
0-4 O/E sites per 200-bp promoter; mean 1.38 sites).
We also noticed a clear peak of enrichment of O
$VTBP-family matrix matches very close to the predicted
transcription start sites (Figure 1C). O$VTBP matrices
represent the vertebrate TATA box and are short and
quite degenerate. This degeneracy results in a large number of background matches, making the number of truly
functional sites difficult to estimate. Considering just the
-60 to -10 region (the region represented by this peak of
enrichment), MatInspector calls an “opt” O$VTBP site
for 39% of the promoters in our set; however, there is a
non-trivial rate of finding these sites in other parts of the
promoter region. Although we cannot determine what
proportion of OR promoters contain a functional TATAbox, such sequences are clearly enriched near OR TSSs.
Previous studies have classified OR promoters as being
mostly TATA-less [20,51,52], but the enrichment we
observe indicates that TATA boxes are likely used in at
least a subset of OR promoters.
Statistical tests reveal a number of transcription factors
whose binding sites are enriched in OR promoters

We examined similar plots of spatial distributions for predicted binding sites of all other PWM families in the MatBase database. Some show enrichment close to the TSS,
but to a lower level than was observed for O/E. In order to
assess the statistical significance of enrichment for each
matrix family, we performed two statistical tests comparing the number of predicted sites observed in the 200 bp
preceding the TSS with the number of sites found in two
types of “negative-control” sequences (Figure 2, Additional
File 4; Methods). Our first test looks for enrichment compared to a nearby region; we used a binomial test to compare the number of predicted sites in the 200 bp upstream
of the TSS with the number in the preceding 200-bp
region (i.e., -200 bp to -400 bp relative to the TSS). For
example, for V$NOLF at the “opt-0.1” stringency, we find
653 matches in the 200 bp preceding the TSSs of the 314
non-redundant ORs, but only 198 matches in the preceding 200 bp, representing ~3.3-fold enrichment. A onetailed binomial test tells us that the likelihood of observing
such extreme skew by chance is < 10-57 (Table 1).
In the second test, we shuffled each 200-bp promoter
sequence, maintaining its mono- and di-nucleotide composition (Methods). We performed MatInspector scans
on the 314 shuffled sequences and compared the number
of matches found for each PWM family in the true promoters with the number found in their shuffled counterparts. We repeated this process with 10,000 datasets of
shuffled sequences. The proportion of shuffled sets in

Page 6 of 22

which we saw an equal or higher number of predicted
transcription factor (TF) binding sites as seen in the real
data provides an estimate of how likely the observed
number of matrix matches would be seen by chance in
sequence of similar nucleotide composition. Comparison
of the number of predicted sites in real sequences with
the mean number of predicted sites in the shuffled sets
gives an estimate of the enrichment level. For example,
there are 653 matches to V$NOLF family matrices (“opt0.1”) in the 200 bp upstream of the TSS in the real
promoter set; in 10,000 shuffled versions of the same
dataset, there are on average 239.6 V$NOLF sites (range
184-312). This method therefore estimates ~2.7-fold
enrichment (Table 1). Because none of the 10,000
shuffled datasets contained as many predicted V$NOLF
sites as the real promoters, we estimate the chance of
seeing 167 matches by chance as being < 1/10,000 (<
0.0001) (using a conservative Bonferroni correction, our
threshold for choosing significant motifs is p = 0.000282).
Although the O/E motif is significantly enriched
according to both tests, the observed TATA-box enrichment (Figure 1C) is significant only when compared to
shuffled sequences (p < 0.0001) and not by the binomial
test comparing the 200-bp promoters to the preceding
200-bp regions (Table 1). In fact, there are fewer sites in
the 200 bp upstream of the TSSs (391 sites) than in the
preceding 200 bp (494 sites). This observation illustrates
two limitations of our tests: (a) comparing a region as
large as 200 bp may be insensitive when true enrichment peaks are more narrowly localized, and (b) the
fluctuation in GC-content approaching the OR-TSSs
can affect background levels of some motifs, especially
short, degenerate AT-rich (or GC-rich) motifs. In the
TATA-box case, enrichment at ~-60bp to ~-10bp is
balanced by slight depletion in other parts of the 200-bp
region due to raised GC-content.
Both tests initially highlighted some potentially interesting candidate transcription factors as being statistically significantly enriched even after a conservative Bonferroni
correction for multiple testing (Figures 2A, 2B, 3, Table 1).
One example is the V$IKRS matrix family representing
binding sites for the Ikaros family (Table 1); these sites
have been previously noted in some OR promoters [52].
However, upon closer examination, we find that the binding matrices for Ikaros are rather similar to those for O/E.
Although it is possible that additional factors like Ikaros
do bind O/E sites, perhaps even in a competitive manner
with O/E factors, it seems likely that the apparent enrichment of Ikaros binding sites is merely a consequence of
the presence of many true O/E motifs and the sequence
similarity between these motifs. In order to search for
matrices that are enriched independently of O/E and
TATA sites, we masked those predicted motifs from the
promoter sequences and repeated our analyses, applying

C. O/E and VTBP sites masked

Figure 2 Number of predicted TF binding sites within 200-bp of the TSS compared to background sequences. Each log-scale plot shows
the total number of predicted binding sites in the set of 314 200-bp promoter regions on the y-axis. The x-axis represents the number of sites
found in the preceding 200-bp regions (upper panels, A and C) or the average number of sites predicted in 10,000 shuffled sequence datasets
(lower panels, B and D). Each data point represents a family of transcription factor matrices in the MatBase database; MatInspector analysis was
performed using the default parameters (see Additional File 4 for analysis using less stringent parameters, and Table 1 and Additional Files 5 and
6 for full results and matrix family names). Panels A and B (left) show results before masking O/E sites and TATA boxes, and panels C and D
(right) show analysis after masking those sites. Data points for which one of the two values is 0 are not plotted (none shows statistically
significant enrichment). Solid black symbols represent matrix families showing statistically significant enrichment; solid gray symbols represent
matrix families showing statistically significant depletion; the blue square symbol highlights the V$NOLF family of matrices representing the O/E
binding site (as expected, no O/E sites were predicted after applying the mask, so O/E does not appear in panels C and D); the red diamond
symbol highlights the O$VTBP family of matrices representing TATA boxes.

similar masks to the control sets used for our statistical
tests in order to ensure that the same amount of sequence
was scanned in real and control sets (see Methods).
After masking O/E sites and TATA boxes, 20 matrix
families appear significantly enriched by one or both of the
tests we describe above, even after applying a conservative

Bonferroni correction (Figures 2C, 2D and 3, Table 1,
Additional Files 5 and 6). None is enriched to as high a
level as O/E sites, but these 20 matrix families are nonetheless found in OR promoters significantly more frequently
than expected. We would not necessarily expect more dramatic levels of enrichment than those observed, given that

Figure 3 Overlap between three tests for motif importance. The Venn diagrams depict the number of matrix families that are significant in
each of our three statistical tests after Bonferroni correction, and after masking O/E sites and TATA boxes. Panel A shows results of MatInspector
scans using default parameters, and panel B shows results using less stringent MatInspector predictions.

many matrix families are quite degenerate and yield high
background levels of false-positive predictions as well as
true positives. Below we discuss the candidate transcription
factors revealed by our enrichment analysis, but first we
describe parallel analyses of evolutionary conservation in
the OR promoters.
We also performed all the tests described above on larger promoter regions of 500 bp (for the binomial test, our
“control” regions comprised the -500 to -1000 region). We
obtained very similar results as we did for the 200-bp promoter regions (Additional Files 7, 8 and 9; e.g. compare
Additional File 7 with Table 1).
Some transcription factor binding sites show orthologous
conservation

Functionally important DNA sequences are often evolutionarily conserved, and therefore analysis of aligned orthologous sequences can help identify such regions [42,43]. OR
promoters are no exception: sequences near OR TSSs
show increased conservation compared to their surroundings (Figure 1A). We sought to dissect the OR promoter
regions further to determine whether binding sites for any
specific transcription factors accounted for this increased
conservation.
We did so by examining conservation scores at the basepair level to determine whether predicted binding sites for
each transcription factor are more conserved than surrounding sequences. This analysis would be difficult for
small numbers of promoter sequences, but the size of our

promoter dataset gives us the statistical power to perform
such analyses. For each of the OR promoter regions, we
obtained multiz/TBA sequence alignments of candidate
orthologous sequences from up to 20 placental mammals
via the UCSC Genome Browser. We then used the
SCONE algorithm [45] to estimate the strength of evolutionary conservation at each position of the multiplesequence alignment. For each PWM family, we examined
whether or not conservation within predicted binding sites
is higher than that outside the sites (but still within the
200-bp promoter region) (see Methods). We find that O/E
sites (predicted using MatInspector’s less stringent parameters) show statistically significantly higher conservation
than the remaining bases (Table 1, Bonferroni-corrected p
< 10-63 considering the whole site, or p < 10-129 considering just the core nucleotides that are most important for
binding; one-tailed Wilcoxon tests).
Applying the same statistical test to each of the other
matrix families in MatBase, we again initially see significant results for Ikaros and other matrices that share similarity with O/E sites. After masking out O/E sites and
VTBP sites and re-applying the statistical tests, we find
that 21 matrix families have significantly higher conservation scores (after Bonferroni correction) in cores and/or
full sites than surrounding nucleotides, considering
MatInspector’s default predictions (Table 1, Additional
Files 5 and 6). Again, analyzing 500-bp promoter regions
instead of 200-bp regions yields very similar set of significant factors.

Table 1 Summary of statistical tests for 200-bp putative promoter region (Continued)

+XX

Page 10 of 22

Results of our statistical tests for enrichment and conservation are provided for selected matrix families before and after masking O/E sites and TATA boxes. Before masking, we provide results only for selected
matrix families that we discuss in the text. After masking, we provide results for any matrix family that appeared statistically significant in all three tests before applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.
Additional Files 5, 6, 10 and 11 give results for all matrix families, as well as for all individual matrices. Additional Files 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 give results of analogous tests for 500-bp putative promoter regions. P-values
provided here are not corrected for multiple testing, but in selecting matrices for further discussion we used the conservative Bonferroni correction. For each matrix family, we provide the description from MatBase,
using the abbreviation TF for transcription factor. We also provide the consensus sequence (using IUPAC degeneracy codes) of an arbitrarily chosen matrix from each family.
The “significance level” column summarizes the results of the three statistical tests in the following order: (a) enrichment versus previous 200-bp region (b) enrichment versus shuffled sequences (c) conservation
scores versus surrounding nucleotides, counting whichever of the sites test or the cores test proved more significant (see Methods). The “.” symbol indicates not significant; the “+” symbol indicates significance level
of p < = 0.05 before applying Bonferroni correction; and the “X” symbol indicates that the p-value remains significant after applying the Bonferroni correction.

Young et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:561
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/561

Although predicted TATA boxes show a clear peak of
enrichment close to the TSS, they are not more conserved
than surrounding nucleotides. This finding might be due
to the short, degenerate nature of this motif (such short
sites are easy to recreate at nearby sites during evolution)
and/or might reveal some limitations of this test: if the collection of predicted sites being tested contains a large
number of false-positive sites (where no conservation
would be expected) as well as truly functional sites, the
higher conservation scores of real sites would be diluted
out by the lower scores of the false-positive sites. The statistical test also has lower power on shorter sites like the
TATA box (fewer scores to test) than on longer sites, and
conservation will be less impressive for factors that can
bind a variety of related sequences (i.e., have degenerate
PWMs) than those that require a more exact match.
Therefore we used another method to show that OR
promoters in other species also appear enriched for TATA
boxes. We used cross-species whole-genome alignments
to obtain datasets of candidate orthologous OR promoter
regions from other mammalian species via UCSC’s liftOver utility, which translates coordinates in one genome
assembly (in our case the mouse assembly) to orthologous
coordinates in other assemblies (see Methods for details,
and for an explanation of why we used liftOver rather
than the multiple sequence alignments used above). We
examined various characteristics of these “lifted Over” promoter regions in several other species and see, in each species examined, similar characteristic patterns of repeat
content dips and GC content fluctuations near the predicted TSS as seen for the mouse OR promoters, indicating that at least a majority of the lifted-over promoters are
likely to be functional promoters (Figure 4). Upon running
MatInspector on the orthologous promoter sets, we also
observe enrichment of predicted O/E binding sites and
TATA boxes. This analysis demonstrates that TATA
boxes are frequently found close to orthologous TSSs,
even though they might not conserved in exactly the same
location in other species.
All three statistical tests show the importance of O/E and
homeodomain sites

As described above, O/E sites are statistically significantly
enriched in OR promoters compared to two sets of background sequences and show statistically significant evolutionary conservation compared to other nucleotides in
the OR promoter. After masking O/E sites and TATA
boxes, fifteen PWM families show significant results in
all three tests when default MatInspector parameters are
used. Impressively, eight PWM families are significant in
all three tests even after applying the conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (Figure 3, Table 1).
All eight of those PWM families represent homeobox
transcription factors (Table 1); their enrichment and

Page 11 of 22

conservation likely reflect the importance of binding sites
for homeodomain proteins Lhx2 and Emx2 (represented
by matrices in the V$LHXF and V$HBOX families,
respectively) in OR promoters [28-30]. Many of the other
homeobox matrices showing significant enrichment have
similar consensus sequences to the matrices for Lhx2
and Emx2. As discussed above for Ikaros and the O/E
factors, bioinformatic analyses cannot distinguish
whether homeobox factors in addition to Lhx2 and Emx2
are involved in OR transcriptional activation, or whether
the observed enrichment of additional homeobox
matrices is simply due to the high similarity between
matrices.
We were curious about the non-homeodomain factors
shown by our analyses to be both enriched and evolutionarily conserved. In order to determine which individual
factors might be important, we extended our analysis in
two ways: (a) we examined enrichment/conservation for
individual position weight matrices (Additional Files 10,
11, 12 and 13) rather than for matrix families (Additional
Files 5, 6, 7 and 8), and (b) we examined genome-wide
expression datasets to determine which of the enriched/
conserved factors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium. In more detail, we performed similar analyses to
those described above, but using MatInspector’s option to
report results for individual position weight matrices. As
expected, for each family that was significant in our original analyses (Table 1), one or more individual matrices
also show significant enrichment and/or conservation. In
many cases, a majority of matrices in the family show significant results in one or more tests; this is expected given
the similarity of the matrices. Where possible, we determined gene symbols for the corresponding transcription
factor for any individual matrix showing significant enrichment and conservation. We then used those gene symbols
to look up expression levels according to RNA-seq data
generated from mature olfactory neurons and a mix of
their progenitors and immature neurons [41], considering
factors expressed at high levels in either cell type to be of
preliminary interest.
Lhx2, Emx2 and the four O/E factors all stand out
clearly when we combine expression data with our enrichment and conservation analyses (Additional Files 10, 11,
12 and 13). In addition to these known factors, the most
tantalizing candidate is Nhlh1 (nescient helix loop helix 1,
also known as Hen1, Nscl-1 and Tal2). Nhlh1 is represented by a matrix in the V$HAND family that shows
modest yet statistically significant enrichment and conservation (Table 1). One of the two individual matrices for
Nhlh1 (V$HEN1.01) also shows significant enrichment
and conservation when tested alone (Additional File 11).
RNA-seq data show that Nhlh1 is expressed at high levels
in the immature neuron/progenitor cell population (a per
gene sum of ~310 reads/exon/kb gene sequence/million

Figure 4 O/E sites and TATA-boxes are enriched near rat, human, dog and cow OR TSSs. In all panels, the black lines represent data for
the 314 mouse OR promoters (i.e., the same data as shown in Figure 1). Colored lines represent putative orthologous promoter regions
(determined using UCSC’s liftOver utility) from rat (gray), human (red), dog (dark blue) and cow (green). In panels B and C, solid lines represent
matrix matches exceeding MatInspector’s default score threshold ("opt”), and dotted lines represent matches found using a less stringent score
threshold ("opt-0.1”). Panel A shows that orthologous promoters from all four placental mammals examined exhibit the same reduction in repeat

promoters in placental mammals, and panel C shows that TATA-boxes are enriched upstream of orthologous TSSs. As in Figure 1, coverage is
calculated as the proportion of promoter sequences containing a predicted O/E (or VTBP) binding site at each base-pair, averaged over 20-bp
windows, sliding along promoters 1 bp at a time.

reads generated, or fpkm), but only very modestly in
mature olfactory neurons (~2 fpkm). We also investigated
publically available microarray expression data using the
BioGPS interface [53,54]; these data indicate even higher
levels of Nhlh1 in the vomeronasal organ (VNO) than in
the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and show that
Nhlh1 is expressed at higher levels in MOE and VNO
than in a wide range of other tissues surveyed. Previous
studies have implicated Nhlh1 in the genesis of GnRH-1
neurons [55], which are born in the olfactory placode and
migrate to the brain. Extensive further experimental studies would be needed to determine whether Nhlh1 has a
role in OR regulation as our bioinformatic tests could suggest, or whether the expression data simply reflect the presence of GnRH-1 precursors among the cells assayed.

As a complementary approach, we performed ab initio
motif detection on the OR promoter sequences. Many
algorithms exist for this difficult task, and none achieves it
perfectly. Tompa et al. [56] discuss the challenges of motif
detection and compare the performance of various algorithms. No program tested found all of the motif instances
planted in the sequences (i.e., all methods had poor sitelevel accuracy); motif-level accuracy is likely better but
was not reported. No algorithm was a clear winner, and
those tested appear to have different and sometimes complementary strengths and weaknesses. We decided to use
three of the algorithms, MEME [57], Weeder [58] and
MotifSampler [59] to search for novel motifs in OR promoters (see Methods). Although we have not tested every
possible algorithm on our sequences, the use of three different tools should provide a reasonable chance of detection. However, short, degenerate and/or relatively rare
motifs are unlikely to be detectable by any ab initio motif
detection algorithm, so a truly comprehensive analysis
may never be possible.
On the 200-bp promoter sequences, Weeder identifies
several O/E-like motifs and several homeodomain-like
motifs. MEME identifies a very common motif similar to
O/E binding sites, as well as some other marginally significant motifs, including some with weaker similarity to the
O/E matrices (data not shown); however, MEME does not
report homeodomain-like motif enrichment. MotifSampler
yields a similar set of enriched O/E-like motifs but no
homeodomain motifs.
On the 500-bp promoter sequences, Weeder identifies
only homeodomain-like motifs but not the striking O/Elike motif, whereas MEME and MotifSampler find an
enriched O/E-like motif but no enrichment of homeodomain-like sequences.
We repeated the motif searches after masking O/E
and VTBP sites as we did for our enrichment analyses

above (see Methods); Weeder continues to find homeodomain-like motifs; MotifSampler now identifies homeodomain-like motifs, showing that thorough masking of
the most common motif can assist in the identification
of secondary motifs. However, MEME reports no
remaining statistically significant motifs.
We investigated why MEME and MotifSampler were
less effective than Weeder at identifying homeodomainlike motifs on the unmasked promoters. We explored various parameter choices for MEME and MotifSampler and
found that the choice of “background model” is influential.
When we use a background model derived from 1-kb promoter regions from all known TSSs in the mouse genome
(GC content 50.1%; Methods), MEME recovers homeodomain-like motifs (not shown) in addition to O/E-like
motifs. When we use a background model supplied by the
authors of MotifSampler that was generated from mouse
intergenic sequences, we find homeodomain but not O/Elike motifs. However, using our first choice of what seems
like a statistically more appropriate choice of background
model given the unusual GC content of OR promoters (a
model derived from the 4-kb regions surrounding OR
TSSs), we found no homeodomain-like motifs. In other
words, AT-rich motifs are statistically not very surprising
in AT-rich sequences, but are surprising in sequences of
genome-wide average GC content. We note that Weeder
uses a background model derived from all 1-kb promoter
regions (Weeder documentation, version 1.2, 2005). This
discrepancy highlights the difficulty of choosing appropriate parameters for motif identification algorithms.
We also used a smaller dataset consisting of evolutionarily conserved promoter subregions as input to MEME,
because ab initio motif-identification algorithms like
MEME should do better on input datasets that are more
enriched in true functional elements. We used PhastCons
elements [44] present in our OR promoter dataset to
define such conserved subregions. The PhastCons program uses a Hidden Markov Model to classify regions of
multiple sequence alignments into two states: conserved
or neutrally evolving. Considering the 200 bp before the
TSS, 68 of the 314 non-redundant OR promoters contain
a total of 94 placental mammal PhastCons elements, comprising 3.9% of the basepairs of the promoter regions
tested. We eliminated three very short conserved elements
(< 8 bp, the minimum size required by MEME), and used
the remaining 91 sequences (total length ~2.4 kbp) as
input to the MEME algorithm. The only statistically significant motif found is again similar to O/E motifs. MEME
reports 74 instances of this motif in 53 of the subsequences, totaling 592 bp, or an impressive 25% of the
basepairs of the PhastCons elements used as input.
We also performed MEME analysis on various functionally and phylogenetically defined subsets of the OR
promoters, reasoning that some subsets of ORs might

Young et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:561
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/561

share sequence motifs that are not common to the
entire OR family, and that analysis of these subsets
might reveal motifs that would otherwise be diluted out
in the larger, more heterogeneous dataset. The functionally defined subsets we tested include ORs expressed in
the same zone of the olfactory epithelium as one
another, ORs expressed in the septal organ, ORs whose
promoter regions have been shown to interact with the
H-region, and ORs for which there is evidence of
expression in the vomeronasal epithelium. We also
selected phylogenetically defined subsets using either the
MOR family categorization [3] or HORDE family assignments [60] or only class I ORs. Upon running MEME
on these subsets, we find O/E-like motifs in almost all
cases, demonstrating that MEME has the power to find
enriched motifs even with very small promoter datasets
(as few as 6 sequences). However, after masking O/E
motifs, we find almost no significant motifs using
MEME in any of the sequence subsets, similar to our
findings for the larger sequence dataset (data not
shown). The very few statistically significant motifs we
do find were rather long and very degenerate, and thus
difficult to interpret whether they have any biological
significance. Similar analyses using Weeder yielded
enriched homeodomain-like motifs in many of the subsets searched, but we did not pick out any common
novel enriched motifs among those reported by Weeder.
The motifs detected by MotifSampler on these smaller
datasets were all rather degenerate and thus it is difficult
to interpret whether they are biologically significant.

Discussion
We have performed rigorous analyses of a large dataset
of mouse olfactory receptor promoter regions looking for
enriched sequence motifs that might be involved in transcriptional control of this gene family. Our approach
combines three statistical tests that deal with issues of
signal-to-noise levels that are often problematic when
searching promoters with collections of known PWMs.
These three tests determine whether or not motifs (a) are
enriched in candidate promoter regions relative to the
immediately preceding region, (b) are enriched in OR
promoters compared to shuffled sequences, and (c) are
more evolutionarily conserved than neighboring
sequences. We found strong statistical evidence that O/E
and homeodomain factors are important in OR transcriptional regulation, agreeing with previous experimental
results and with a previous, more limited, bioinformatics
search [20]. These results demonstrate that our approach
is well designed and effective. However, our analysis
revealed no convincing novel candidate transcription factors, suggesting that experimental approaches might have
already been successful in uncovering all factors common
to the majority of the OR family.

Page 14 of 22

Our analysis focused on either the 200-bp or 500-bp
regions immediately upstream of the transcription start
site; a 200-bp region appears sufficient to direct appropriate transcription of transgene reporter constructs for the
very limited number of OR promoters tested [14,16].
However, it is also possible that some ORs might contain
functionally important motifs in other regions, perhaps
further upstream of the TSS, in the first intron, 5’ UTR,
ORF, and/or in the 3’ UTR. It is intriguing that olfactory
tissues express over 100 microRNAs and that some
appear to be necessary as precursor cells differentiate
into mature olfactory neurons [61]. Although outside the
scope of this study, our statistical approach could also be
applied to search for enriched microRNA target sites. A
search for DNA- or RNA-based signals residing in the
ORF region would also be interesting, but would require
different analysis methods that account for the fact that
ORFs are constrained by the need to encode functional
proteins (and for organismal codon bias) and for variation in conservation levels in different regions of the
protein.
Our careful approach highlights some potential pitfalls
of the bioinformatic analysis of gene regulation, especially
in gene families that include recent duplicates. To ensure
independence in statistical tests, we realized it was
important to include only one representative of any pair
of recently duplicated promoter sequences in any analysis, as false-positive matrix matches would be highly correlated among duplicates and could give false signs of
enrichment. We also note that it is difficult to distinguish
between transcription factors with similar binding sites
(e.g. O/E and Ikaros) and that sequential rounds of analysis can be helpful, masking out sites for the top hit before
repeating statistical tests.
Despite our efforts to perform a thorough computational analysis, a bioinformatic approach naturally has
many limitations. One of the main issues is that PWMs
defining TF binding sites are usually short and quite
degenerate, meaning that the matrix will match at many
“false positive” locations in addition to true binding sites.
Furthermore, PWMs for different TFs have different
levels of signal-to-noise, meaning that no single score
threshold or filtering strategy is appropriate for all
PWMs. Very degenerate binding sites are particularly difficult to detect as enriched: comparison between our
observations for O/E and TATA boxes demonstrates this
issue clearly. Atypical motifs (e.g., dyads with variable
spacers) are also difficult to identify. In vivo, local chromatin structure, epigenetic modifications, DNA accessibility, indirect regulation via protein-protein interactions,
and perhaps even sub-nuclear localization are likely to be
crucial in allowing a transcription factor to act only at
the “correct” sites, even if it would be able to bind most
predicted sites on isolated DNA in vitro.

Young et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:561
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/561

We note that our use of the Bonferroni correction and
the requirement that a factor be recognized by all three
tests is a conservative approach - additional PWMs that
do not meet formal significance criteria might also be
truly enriched and functionally important. Indeed, some
motifs (as we have seen for TATA-boxes) might show
enrichment in orthologous promoter sets when analyzed
independently but fail to show higher conservation scores
in multiple sequence alignments because the exact location of the binding site can shift during evolution [62].
Our three statistical tests used a database of transcription
factors whose binding sites are known; such databases are
almost certainly incomplete. However, our complementary
analysis using the ab initio motif-identification algorithm
MEME revealed a very similar set of enriched motifs as we
found using the MatBase database as a starting point. This
observation argues that totally novel factors are unlikely to
regulate OR promoters unless they recognize very degenerate sequences, which no current bioinformatic approach
can detect.
Finally, some members of the OR gene family are
expressed outside of the olfactory epithelium as well as in
the nose, for example in mouse muscle cells or human
testis [63,64], leaving open the interesting possibility that
some ORs have been co-opted during evolution to perform new functions. Careful bioinformatic and experimental analysis of promoters of ORs expressed in other
tissues could reveal recently arisen transcription factor
binding sites that allow novel regulatory control in nonolfactory tissues.

Conclusions
Our analyses confirm the functional relevance of O/E
and homeodomain binding sites across the OR family
and suggest that there are no other well-conserved
sequence motifs that are important for a majority of the
OR family. The mystery of OR transcriptional control
remains and will need to be addressed by experimental
approaches, perhaps in combination with sequence analyses similar to those we describe here. The recent finding that epigenetic marks may be important in OR
regulation [41] opens a promising new line of inquiry.
Methods
General bioinformatics resources

Our analyses were performed using custom scripts written in R [65] and PERL, utilizing several Bioconductor
packages [66] (principally IRanges) and BioPerl modules
[67]. We obtained several genome-wide datasets (including the CpG-island and PhastCons element tracks) via
the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics site [68,69] and the
Table Browser tool [70]. We also utilized the RepeatMasker program [71] to recognize and mask interspersed
repeat sequences from OR promoter regions.

Relative expression levels were derived from RNA-seq
data as previously described and provided as a supplement by Magklara et al. [41].
Mouse OR gene dataset

We determined the locations of the 1151 intact OR genes
and 287 OR pseudogenes in the most recent version of
the mouse genome assembly (July 2007/NCBI37/mm9)
using a previously described method [2]. Coordinates of
those 1438 OR gene family members are provided in
Additional File 1. We determined officially approved
gene names (where available) by comparing genomic
coordinates of our set with genomic coordinates of existing named ORs according to MGD [72]. Due to changes
in genome assemblies, not all ORs in the current assembly have an official gene name. Many OR publications
use alternative gene names; these names are included in
Additional File 1 when their corresponding sequences
match a sequence in our set with 100% nucleotide identity over their full length. Polymorphisms and/or
sequence errors might mean that some previously named
ORs do not appear in this table.
We defined family and subfamily membership for each
mouse OR according to two classification systems:
HORDE, determined using human olfactory receptor
sequences [4] and MOR, determined using mouse olfactory receptor sequences [3]. For MOR family assignments,
we performed a blastn search of each mouse OR we found
in the most recent mouse genome assembly against
nucleotide sequences of a set of mouse ORs named
according to a different classification system [73]. We
assigned each mouse OR membership in the same MOR
family as its best match in that blastn search. For HORDE
family/subfamily assignments, the reference human
sequence set is more diverged from our mouse query
sequences than is the MOR reference set, making a blastp
search more appropriate. Therefore, we used translated
mouse OR ORF sequences to search a local file containing
predicted human OR protein sequences from the HORDE
database (version 41) [4,74]. If the closest-matching
human gene in that blastp search showed at least 40%
amino acid similarity with the mouse OR query, we gave
that mouse gene the same HORDE family assignment as
its human target; if the match exceeded 60% similarity, we
also assigned the same subfamily as the human target.
Defining TSS locations

We previously reported end-sequences of 1264 OR
cDNAs from adult and embryonic olfactory epithelial
cDNA libraries [13] among a larger set of 1738 sequences
[Genbank: CB172832 - CB174569]. We excluded some
cDNAs that showed unusual splice patterns [13] and a
small number of sequences derived from the 3’ ends of
the clones. We also analyzed 434 5’-RACE sequences

Young et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:561
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/561

reported by Michaloski et al. [20] [Genbank: DR065530 DR065963].
In order to assign each EST or RACE sequence to the
corresponding OR gene, we first defined a genomic
“domain” for each OR, whereby any cDNA mapping to
that domain on the correct strand would be assigned as
being transcribed from the corresponding gene. We
defined the upstream edge of the domain as being 1 kb
closer than the nearest edge of the next OR ORF upstream
(or 100 kb upstream of the ORF’s start if no other OR was
found within that distance); we defined the downstream
edge of the domain as being 1 kb downstream of the end
of the gene’s ORF.
We used cDNA or RACE product sequence accession
numbers as queries in UCSC’s Table Browser to look up
their map positions in the mouse genome assembly (July
2007). We then used Bioconductor’s IRanges package to
compare those cDNA positions to the set of OR gene
domains as defined above. cDNAs whose position overlapped more than one OR domain were excluded from
further analysis. For each gene domain, we assigned basepair positions present in any cDNA/RACE sequence and/
or in the ORF of the gene domain as part of the transcript.
Because UCSC’s cDNA-genome mapping algorithm
reports separate alignment blocks whenever an indel
occurs, we merged any transcribed segments that were
separated by < 10 bp, as these gaps are very unlikely to
represent true introns. After this merge, we removed from
further analysis 49 OR genes for which only a single transcribed exon appeared to be present, as these might represent cDNAs that are only partial transcripts or genomic
contaminants of the cDNA library. We also removed 11
apparent transcribed pseudogenes (these transcripts might
truly originate from a pseudogene, or the OR might be
intact in the mouse in which transcripts were observed,
with a single nucleotide polymorphism or sequence error
causing it to appear as a pseudogene in the genome
assembly). We removed 2 additional ORs for which the
cDNA/RACE sequences implied an unusual gene structure (an intron downstream of the ORF), leaving 432
intact ORs for which we assigned the furthest upstream
base of the transcript as the TSS.
In order to ensure that our final dataset did not contain
any close duplicates, we grouped the 1151 intact ORs by
sequence similarity. We determined pairwise synonymous
nucleotide divergence of the 1151 intact OR coding
regions using an in-frame nucleotide alignment as input to
PAML’s codeml algorithm (version 4.3) [75], run in pairwise mode, and identified any pairs of ORs showing divergence of < 0.3 substitutions per synonymous site as
“similar”. We also used blastn to cross-compare 2 kb of
sequence around each of the 432 TSSs (removing any
ORF sequence, if the TSS was closer than 1 kb to the ORF
start). We assigned as “similar” any pair of 2-kb sequences

Page 16 of 22

that blastn was able to align for at least 200 bp with at
least 70% nucleotide identity. We used those two lists of
“similar” OR pairs as input for a Perl script that performs
single linkage clustering and then arbitrarily chose only
one OR from each group for further analysis. The resulting dataset of 312 ORs should therefore contain no pairs
of recently duplicated ORs.
MatInspector analysis

In order to search for candidate binding sites for transcription factors with known sequence specificity, we purchased a license to use the MatBase database and
MatInspector search algorithm [49] (Genomatix Software
GmbH, Munich, Germany). We used a local installation of
the Matrix Family Library (Version 8.02, January 2010)
and software (Version 8.20 Professional, February 2010)
and searched genomic sequences near OR TSSs with all
PWMs in the “vertebrate” and “general core promoter elements” categories of the library. MatBase groups PWMs
that represent the same or functionally similar transcription factors into families: the version of MatBase that we
searched contains 727 vertebrate PWMs in 170 families
and 16 general core promoter element PWMs grouped
into 10 matrix families. The total number of matrix
families considered in our search was 177 (we ignored
three matrix families in the general category that on closer
inspection were found to be fly-, plant- or yeast-specific).
Unsurprisingly, similar matrices often recognize overlapping or identical regions of a query promoter sequence;
MatInspector helps reduce an overwhelming number of
predicted sites by reporting only the highest-scoring
matrix match per family in any overlapping region of the
query sequence. We therefore performed most of our statistical analyses at the level of MatBase families rather
than on individual PWMs.
We ran MatInspector twice with different parameters;
once using the default score threshold (called the “optimized” threshold, referred to in the manuscript as “opt”),
and again using a threshold 0.1 units lower than the optimized threshold ("opt-0.1”), which results in about ten
times as many matches as does “opt”. We used the OUTFILES = 2 option to obtain tab-delimited text output,
which we then parsed and analyzed in R. Many transcription factor binding sites are at least partially palindromic,
so that MatInspector often predicts overlapping sites for
the same matrix on opposite strands.
Enrichment statistics

Transcription factor binding sites are represented by
short and degenerate position weight matrices (PWMs).
This degeneracy means that when genomic sequence is
searched with a PWM, there is often a non-trivial level of
false-positive site predictions. We wanted to determine
whether the number of predicted sites in the 200-bp

Young et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:561
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/561

regions nearest our set of predicted TSSs was more than
would be expected in “background” non-promoter
sequences. We also performed all the tests described
below on 500-bp regions upstream of the TSS: for simplicity, below we describe analysis of only the 200-bp
regions. As described in the main text, we performed two
statistical tests to address this question, using two different sets of background sequences. In the first test, we
compared the number of predicted sites in the 200 bp
nearest to the predicted TSS with the number predicted
in the preceding 200-bp region. It is possible that some
sites in that previous 200-bp region do indeed represent
real TF binding sites, reducing the ability of our test to
detect truly functional sequence motifs in the TSS-proximal region, but given the unusual GC-content of our
promoters, we decided that it was best to use neighboring
regions as controls rather than anything yet farther from
the predicted TSSs. We used a one-tailed binomial test
to assess whether the number of sites in our regions of
interest was statistically significantly greater than that in
the background region, with a null hypothesis that transcription factor binding sites are equally likely to be
found in each of the 200-bp regions. Because we performed each test on 177 PWM families, we conservatively required a p-value of < 0.05/177 (< 0.000282) in
order to declare statistical significance (the Bonferroni
correction).
In our second test, we randomized the DNA sequence of
each 200-bp promoter region, using the shuffle program
from the SQUID package (version 1.9g, S. Eddy) [76], supplying a random seed and maintaining mononucleotide
and dinucleotide composition by specifying the “-d” flag.
We repeated the shuffling process 10,000 times, supplying
a different random seed each time, in order to obtain
10,000 datasets of “negative control” sequences with the
same nucleotide composition as our real 200-bp promoter
regions. We ran MatInspector on these shuffled datasets
in the same way as we had with the real sets and tabulated
for each dataset the number of predicted sites found for
each matrix family. We then counted how many of the
10,000 shuffled sets contained a number of matrix
matches that exceeded that found in the real promoters,
taking that proportion as a “shuffled P-value”, again using
a conservative Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p <
0.000282 to declare statistical significance. We also calculated the mean number of matrix matches found across
the 10,000 sets; comparison with the number found in the
real dataset gives an estimate of enrichment level. An
explanatory example is given in the main text.
We investigated the use of an alternative type of negative control sequence: GC-matched promoters from nonOR genes, as one would not expect many of them to
share the same enriched motifs as OR promoters. However, it proved impossible to assemble a truly appropriate

Page 17 of 22

non-OR promoter control set. First, OR promoters have
such extremely low GC content that we struggled to
obtain a matched set; only ~280 promoters in the mouse
genome had similarly low GC content. Those GCmatched non-OR promoters still had much higher conservation scores than our OR-promoter set (data not
shown) - it was thus not possible to match promoters on
GC content and conservation levels. This difference in
conservation levels is difficult to interpret given the fact
that the OR family has experienced many recent duplications and deletions disrupting orthology, and given that
OR coding regions appear to be evolving under much
lower selective constraints in some species (e.g. primates)
than others (e.g. rodents), so that it seems likely their
promoter regions are also under lower selective constraint. The sequences we analyzed that immediately precede the OR promoter sequences are only very slightly
different in GC content and conservation level to the
promoter dataset (Figure 1), and are better matched for
these parameters than any non-OR promoter dataset we
could have assembled.
Analysis of conservation scores

We used UCSC’s Table Browser to obtain multiple-species
alignments of the 200-bp promoter regions. These are
portions of whole-genome alignments that were generated
by a sophisticated computational pipeline based on the
multiz and TBA programs [77]. One caveat of multiz/TBA
alignments is that they may contain a minority of spuriously aligned regions [78]. In a study assessing the accuracy of various whole-genome alignment methods [78],
another program, PECAN [79] was found to produce
more accurate alignments. However, we found that in the
olfactory receptor promoter regions, PECAN aligned very
little sequence at all (data not shown), perhaps due to a
very conservative approach in regions that have experienced post-speciation duplication. We reasoned that even
if the multiz/TBA alignments contain a minority of misaligned regions, and might have aligned a subset of
sequences from other species to more than one mouse
location, they would likely still provide some power in
looking for conserved subregions of OR promoters. We
chose to use aligned sequences from only placental mammals, because our examination of OR region alignments in
the UCSC Genome Browser revealed that placental mammal alignments are usually part of longer chained alignments, whereas apparently aligned sequences from other
species are often fragmentary and confined to interspersed
repeat elements.
Several algorithms exist that estimate the evolutionary
selective pressure acting on each nucleotide of a set of
aligned sequences, given a phylogenetic tree defining the
evolutionary relationships between the sequences. We
chose to use the SCONE algorithm [45], subtracting

Young et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:561
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/561

SCONE’s “Pval” score (represents the probability that a
site is evolving neutrally) from 1 to obtain a score that is
higher for more conserved residues. We ran SCONE on
each of the multiple-sequence alignments, using a species
tree obtained from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics
site [80] that we manually pruned so that it contained
only placental mammals. We parsed SCONE output
using Perl and R/Bioconductor. For each family of transcription factor matrices in MatBase, we used a onetailed Wilcoxon test to determine whether or not
SCONE scores of alignment positions inside predicted
binding sites are higher than SCONE scores outside of
sites. We performed two versions of the test: (a) we
examined all bases of the predicted TF binding sites, and
(b) we examined just the four most essential “core” positions of the binding region, as defined in MatBase. One
might expect higher conservation in the core residues
and thus a greater distinction between site and non-site
scores; however, many fewer alignment positions exist in
the cores than the whole sites, and in some cases the
increased statistical power gained by considering the
whole site meant that we obtained a significant result
using the whole sites but not the cores. We therefore
recorded as significant any matrix family that appeared
interesting in either the whole site or the core test
(although both tests showed significance in most cases),
after applying the same conservative Bonferroni correction described above.
OR promoters in other species

In order to examine OR promoters in other species, we
used UCSC’s liftOver utility to obtain orthologous TSS
coordinates in the rat, human, dog and cow genomes. For
a given base-pair range in a reference genome assembly,
liftOver provides the coordinates of the aligned region
from another species, using the same whole-genome alignments we discuss above. We considered an alternative
approach of using the orthologous sequences present in
the multiple sequence alignments discussed above, but in
many cases the alignments contained < 1 kb of orthologous sequence concentrated around the TSS, and in some
cases aligned sequences comprised several non-contiguous
pieces of the orthologous genome. We wished to examine
a more extended, continuous stretch of sequence centered
around the orthologous promoter, rather than only those
regions that were found to align using whole-genome
alignment procedures. As input to liftOver, we used 21-bp
regions centered around the predicted TSSs (smaller
regions often failed to “liftOver” due to frequent small
insertions/deletions in the alignments). After obtaining
orthologous coordinates for those 21-bp regions, we took
the center position as the predicted orthologous TSS, and
extended 2 kb each side of that TSS to create 4-kb regions.
The resulting dataset of 4-kb regions contained some

Page 18 of 22

redundancy (e.g., in some cases, several mouse promoters
pointed to the same or overlapping orthologous human
promoters, indicating a likely duplication in the mouse
genome since divergence from human, or a deletion of
one paralog in human). We removed such redundancy by
merging overlapping 4-kb regions, and taking the most
upstream 4 kb of each merged region (again, effectively
using the most upstream of possible alternate promoters
in our analysis). Almost all of the predicted orthologous
promoter regions are near OR genes in the corresponding
genomes.
Conservation of O/E sites predicted at less stringent
MatInspector parameters

In order to determine the proportion of O/E sites predicted using MatInspector’s less stringent parameters that
appear evolutionarily conserved, we performed the following analysis, which utilizes the mammalian species tree
and multiple sequence alignments of OR promoter regions
described above. We used ungapped versions of each
sequence in the multiple sequence alignments as input to
MatInspector (again using the less stringent parameters).
We used a custom Bioconductor script to convert the
position of all predicted O/E sites in ungapped sequences
to positions relative to the multiple sequence alignment,
and therefore relative to the reference mouse sequence.
For each mouse O/E site, we could then determine the list
of species that had overlapping O/E site predictions. We
used that species list to extract a subtree from the full
species tree and determined the length of that subtree:
subtree length thus provides a measure of how evolutionarily conserved each site is. We then filtered mouse O/E
sites according to various minimum tree length thresholds
(Additional File 3, panel A). Full details on tree construction and units of branch length are given by UCSC [81].
To give the reader some sense of how tree length translates to which of the species possess a site, some examples
of subtrees and their total branch lengths are given here:
mouse-rat = 0.161; mouse-human = 0.453; mouse-rathuman = 0.537; mouse-rabbit-guinea pig = 0.723; mousechimpanzee-cat = 0.760; mouse-rat-guinea pig-hedgehogtenrec = 1.24.
Recent work has shown that transcription factor binding sites sometimes show turnover, that is they are found
in orthologous promoter sequences but not at exactly
orthologous locations [62]. To explore this idea in OR
promoters, we repeated the above analysis, but instead of
requiring sites to overlap in the multiple species alignment we allowed various amounts of “slide”: e.g., if there
was a human O/E site at a location that aligned within
50bp of a mouse O/E site, we scored that mouse O/E site
as being conserved in human (Additional File 3, panel B).
This approach is very successful at selecting O/E sites
that are likely to be functional (Additional File 3). In the

Young et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:561
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/561

text, we discuss “conserved” O/E sites: we selected sites
conserved with a tree length of at least 0.17 (i.e., conserved in at least one additional mammal, other than rat),
allowing 50bp slide (green line, Additional File 3, panel
B). For other matrix families, different thresholds/slide
amounts appeared more successful, and for some matrix
families (e.g. O$VTBP, representing TATA boxes), no
combination of slide amount/tree length appeared able
to select likely functional sites making it difficult to systematically implement such an evolutionary filtering
approach. This topic is discussed at more length by Kheradpour et al. [82].
Masking O/E sites and TATA-boxes from promoter
sequences

As explained in the main text, we masked O/E sites and
candidate TATA-boxes from the promoter regions and
repeated our analyses to determine whether any matrix
families show enrichment or conservation independently
of O/E and TATA-boxes. For the purpose of masking, we
decided to be fairly loose in our definition of O/E sites
because any sites left in the dataset could still yield apparent enrichment of O/E-like sequences that is not truly
independent of O/E enrichment. We therefore masked
out the entire extent of any O/E site predicted by MatInspector at our lower stringency setting (“opt-0.1”). We also
masked all predicted TATA boxes (“opt”) between position -61 and -10 relative to the TSS. We recognize that
this approach is very conservative (masks more sequence
than necessary) because there is a relatively high falsepositive prediction rate for TATA boxes; we preferred to
mask too much sequence than to identify enrichment of
transcription factors with TATA-box-like matrices.
As well as masking those regions from the real promoter set, we recorded the positions of the masked sites
and also masked the equivalent regions from (a) each of
the 10,000 shuffled datasets, (b) the dataset of preceding
200-bp regions, and (c) the lists of conservation scores.
We then repeated MatInspector runs and the three statistical analyses using masked sequences and scores.
This strategy ensured that an equivalent amount of
sequence was being analyzed in the real and control
datasets.

each sequence of the input set (-mod anr), searching for
up to N*3 motif instances in the dataset, where N is the
number of input sequences (-maxsites N*3). We used
the MEME suite’s fasta-get-markov program with option
-m 2 to construct a second-order Markov model of single nucleotide, dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies as the background model of nucleotide frequencies
(MEME parameter: -bfile). Input sequences for fastaget-markov were RepeatMasked 2-kb regions centered
around our set of 314 candidate TSSs. We also tested
MEME’s performance using a different background frequency model derived from all 1-kb promoters in the
mouse genome (more GC-rich than our promoter set;
50.1% versus 37.0% GC for the equivalent 1kb region in
OR promoters). This promoter set contains 23271
sequences and was obtained (July 16th, 2010) from the
Genome Bioinformatics site [64].
We ran Weeder [58] locally using the “weederlauncher.
out” helper script provided by the authors, which searches
for motifs of length 6, 8, 10 and 12bp (allowing 1, 2, 3 or 4
mutations, respectively). By default, Weeder assumes the
motif is present one or more times in at least half of the
input sequences. We specified the “S” option to search
both strands of the input sequences and the “MM” species
option so that a background sequence model derived from
mouse genomic sequences would be used. It is not possible to specify a custom background model for promoters
of unusual GC-content. The program finds the best 10
motifs of each length, and then compares all motifs identified, reporting groups of similar motifs as “redundant”
motifs. Weeder gives no p-value or confidence estimate
for whether reported motifs are truly enriched.
For MotifSampler [59], we first created a second-order
background model from our set of 2kb promoter regions
using the CreateBackgroundModel algorithm from MotifSuite [83]. We then ran MotifSampler using this background distribution and the -n 4 parameter (so that the
best four motifs would be found). By default, MotifSampler performs its analysis 100 times using different starting
points each time. We processed MotifSampler’s results
using the MotifRanking algorithm which combines similar
motifs found in the different “replicate” runs; as the
authors advise, we only retained motifs that were found in
at least 30/100 of those analyses.

Identification of novel sequence motifs

We used three programs (MEME, Weeder and MotifSampler) to identify novel sequence motifs using various sets
of RepeatMasked promoter region sequences as input.
First, we used MEME [57] to search both strands of
the input sequence set (parameter: -revcomp) for the
ten best motifs (parameter: -nmotifs 10) of size 4-10 bp
(parameters: -minw 4 -maxw 10). We also tried searching for motifs of size 4-25 bp: results were very similar.
We allowed motifs to occur any number of times in

(so there are multiple rows for some genes in this table). The “Best TSS?”
column indicates whether each defined TSS is the most upstream one
for that gene ("Best”), or lies downstream of another TSS for the same
gene ("NotBest”). The most upstream TSS for each gene is included in
Additional File 1 and was used in our promoter analyses. * Gene names
are given where the TSS location was derived from RACE experiments
(excluding the high-throughput RACE experiments of Michaloski et al.).
Additional file 3: Figure showing that most O/E sites predicted
using MatInspector’s less stringent parameters are evolutionarily
conserved. The solid gray line shows all mouse O/E sites predicted
using MatInspector’s less stringent parameters. For reference we include
a dotted gray line showing all mouse O/E sites predicted using
MatInspector’s default parameters. As in Figure 1, coverage is calculated
as the proportion of promoter sequences containing a predicted O/E
binding site at each base-pair, averaged over 20-bp windows, sliding
along promoters 1 bp at a time. In panel A, the colored lines show
predicted mouse O/E sites that remain after we apply an evolutionary
“filter” to MatInspector predictions on a multiple sequence alignment
(see Methods). For example, the red line shows mouse O/E sites that
have overlapping O/E sites in a set of mammals with tree length of at
least 1.5. Note that the conservation filter removes many of the O/E sites
far away from the TSS and selects for likely functional sites near the TSS.
In panel B, we explore the effect of allowing various amounts of “slide”
(see Methods), where sites in other species are no longer required to
overlap but could be various distances away, accounting for evolutionary
“turnover” [62].

Note: while our manuscript was under review, Clowney et al. [84] published
a manuscript that used RACE and microarrays to identify ~700 additional OR
promoter regions. Their bioinformatic analysis also showed enrichment of O/
E and homeodomain sites, but failed to detect TATA-box enrichment. Our
manuscript remains the only publication to use the powerful tool of
comparative genomics for OR promoter analysis and the only one to show
TATA-box enrichment.
