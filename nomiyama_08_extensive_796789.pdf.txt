Abstract
Background: The chemokine family plays important roles in cell migration and activation. In
humans, at least 44 members are known. Based on the arrangement of the four conserved cysteine
residues, chemokines are now classified into four subfamilies, CXC, CC, XC and CX3C. Given that
zebrafish is an important experimental model and teleost fishes constitute an evolutionarily diverse
group that forms half the vertebrate species, it would be useful to compare the zebrafish
chemokine system with those of mammals. Prior to this study, however, only incomplete lists of
the zebrafish chemokine genes were reported.
Results: We systematically searched chemokine genes in the zebrafish genome and EST databases,
and identified more than 100 chemokine genes. These genes were CXC, CC and XC subfamily
members, while no CX3C gene was identified. We also searched chemokine genes in pufferfish
fugu and Tetraodon, and found only 18 chemokine genes in each species. The majority of the
identified chemokine genes are unique to zebrafish or teleost fishes. However, several groups of
chemokines are moderately similar to human chemokines, and some chemokines are orthologous
to human homeostatic chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL14. Zebrafish also possesses a novel
species-specific subfamily consisting of five members, which we term the CX subfamily. The CX
chemokines lack one of the two N-terminus conserved cysteine residues but retain the third and
the fourth ones. (Note that the XC subfamily only retains the second and fourth of the signature

cysteines residues.) Phylogenetic analysis and genome organization of the chemokine genes showed
that successive tandem duplication events generated the CX genes from the CC subfamily.
Recombinant CXL-chr24a, one of the CX subfamily members on chromosome 24, showed marked
chemotactic activity for carp leukocytes. The mRNA was expressed mainly during a certain period
of the embryogenesis, suggesting its role in the zebrafish development.
Conclusion: The phylogenic and genomic organization analyses suggest that a substantial number
of chemokine genes in zebrafish were generated by zebrafish-specific tandem duplication events.
During such duplications, a novel chemokine subfamily termed CX was generated in zebrafish. Only
two human chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL14 have the orthologous chemokines in zebrafish. The
diversification observed in the numbers and sequences of chemokines in the fish may reflect the
adaptation of the individual species to their respective biological environment.

Background
Chemokines are a family of chemotactic cytokines that
regulate migration and tissue compartmentalization of
various kinds of cells in the body [1-4]. Chemokine genes
have been found only in vertebrates including jawless fish
lamprey, the most primitive vertebrate [5]. Based on the
arrangement of the four conserved cysteine residues,
chemokines are now classified into four subfamilies, CXC,
CC, XC and CX3C. One or three amino acid residues separate the first and second cysteine residues in the CXC and
CX3C chemokines, respectively. In the CC subfamily, the
two N-terminus cysteines are juxtaposed. The XC subfamily (often called as C subfamily) lacks the first and
third conserved cysteine residues. There are at least 44
chemokine genes (24 CC, 17 CXC, one CX3C, and two XC
genes) in humans. In addition, there are four CC chemokine genes (CCL3L1, CCL3L3, CCL4L1, and CCL4L2),
which are highly similar to CCL3 or CCL4 genes but their
gene copy numbers are variable between individuals. In
mice, there are 38 genes (21 CC, 15 CXCL, one CX3C, and
one XC genes) in addition to several CC genes similar to
Ccl19, Ccl21, and Ccl27 with variable copy numbers
between strains. Besides gene number differences, there
exist lineage-specific chemokine genes as well as genes
ambiguous in the orthologous relationship even between
human and mouse. On the other hand, only 18 functionally signaling chemokine receptors are identified in both
human and mouse. Hence, multiple chemokines can bind
to the same receptor.
Chemokine genes can be divided into two groups based
on the genomic organization [3]. The genes of one group
are located in large clusters at particular chromosome
locations (the major-cluster chemokines). In humans and
mice, there are two major gene clusters consisting of CC
genes and CXC genes, respectively. Another group of
chemokines are located separately in unique chromosomal locations, singly or in mini-clusters. The majorcluster chemokines usually bind to multiple receptors and
often do not correspond well between species. They were
probably generated by multiple gene duplication events

occurred relatively recently in the evolutionary terms. In
contrast, mini-cluster or non-cluster chemokine genes are
well conserved between the species and tend to act on a
single receptor.
In addition to the protein or genome structure-based classifications, the chemokines can also be functionally classified into two major groups based on their mode of
expression and function, the inflammatory and homeostatic chemokines [6]. Inflammatory chemokines are
expressed by leukocytes or related cells only upon activation and mediate emigration of leukocytes, while homeostatic chemokines are constitutively expressed in tissues
such as lymphoid tissues and are involved in relocation of
lymphocytes or other types of cells. Some chemokines are
known to have both properties and are called dual-function chemokines. Notably, most homeostatic and dualfunction chemokines belong to the mini- or non-cluster
chemokines, while most inflammatory chemokines to the
major cluster chemokines.
Teleost fishes constitute an evolutionarily diverse group
and form half of the vertebrate species. The availability of
genomic resources in the form of genome sequences and
ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags)/cDNAs for fishes that
belong to different orders now allows an evolutionary
analysis of the chemokine gene family in the fish. The
draft genome sequences are available for several teleosts,
and we chose zebrafish (Danio rerio) and two pufferfish
species, Fugu rubripes (or Takifugu rubripes) [7] and Tetraodon nigroviridis [8], for this study. The genome size of
zebrafish is 1,700 Mb, about half of the size of human
genome, and those of the two pufferfish species are only
390 Mb. The divergence between the lineages leading to
zebrafish and pufferfish was estimated to be about 150
million years (Myr) ago from the fossil data [9,10] or
about 324 Myr ago from the molecular data [11]. The two
pufferfish species belong to the order Tetraodontiformes
and diverged from a common ancestor approximately 32
Myr ago from the fossil data [10] or 85 Myr ago from the
molecular data [11]. The genome sequences of these

fishes are nearly complete, and 85% (zebrafish) and 90%
(the two pufferfish species) of the genomes are represented in the draft sequences.
Zebrafish is a useful experimental model to study various
biological processes in vivo, particularly the developmental processes [12-14]. Previously, by using zebrafish, Doitsidou et al. [15] and Knaut et al. [16] have demonstrated
that the CXC chemokine cxcl12a (sdf-1a) and its receptor
cxcr4 are critical for proper migration of the primordial
germ cells, the progenitors of the gametes. Furthermore,
also by using zebrafish, the cxcl12-cxcr4 signaling has also
been shown to be important for the migration of sensory
cells known as the migrating primordium of the posterior
lateral line as well as the guidance of retinal ganglion cell
axons [17,18]. These finding have clearly demonstrated
the usefulness of this model organism for studying the
chemokine functions in the embryogenesis.
Recently, Peatman and Liu [19] reported identification of
46 CC chemokine genes in the zebrafish genome. They
compared them with the 26 catfish CC chemokines that
they previously identified, and showed evidence of extensive, species-specific intrachromosomal duplications.
They also showed such gene duplications are widespread
among the teleost fishes by analyzing CC chemokine
genes of various species [19]. DeVries et al. [20] also identified 127 vertebrate chemokine genes including 63
zebrafish genes and showed that the tandem and en bloc
duplications have been used as means for selective expansion of the chemokine superfamily members. However,
the zebrafish genome project is still ongoing, and the
genome sequence that these two groups have used was the
previous version. In the present study, we systematically
searched for the chemokine genes in the latest zebrafish
genome and EST databases. We have identified more than
100 chemokine genes in the zebrafish genome including
a novel chemokine subfamily termed CX. Phylogenic and
syntenic analyses with other fish and mammal chemokines have demonstrated that extensive and highly speciesspecific duplication events were involved in the evolution
of the zebrafish chemokine system. We have further demonstrated that several chemokines including one of the
CX subfamily show developmentally regulated expression
patterns, suggesting their potential roles in the embryonic
development of zebrafish.

Results
Chemokine gene prediction and isolation of chemokine
cDNAs
Using various chemokine sequences as queries, we
searched for chemokine genes in the zebrafish draft
genome and EST databases and identified a total of 101
possible chemokine gene sequences (Table 1) in addition
to the four chemokine genes reported previously by other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/222

groups, ccl1 (GenBank accession number NM_131062),
cxcl12a and cxcl12b [15], and scyba [21]. To determine
whether the genes predicted from the genome sequence
are expressed and also to confirm the exon-intron junctions, a mixture of cDNAs prepared from various developmental stages of zebrafish was used as a template for RTPCR using primers located outside the coding sequences
(Table 2). A total of 34 cDNAs were isolated. The 5'
sequence of one clone (CCL-chrUi) was obtained by
RACE reaction. Six of them were isolated incidentally due
to their close similarity to the original cDNA sequences.
Therefore, a total of 107 chemokine genes were newly
identified, of which 71 genes have corresponding cDNAs
or ESTs (Table 1). Considering the zebrafish draft
sequence covers approximately 85% of the genome, these
results suggest that there would possibly exist more than
the currently identified 111 (4+107) chemokine genes in
the zebrafish genome, far exceeding the number of the
mammalian chemokine genes. Indeed, there are a
number of chemokine-like exons located near or within
the intact chemokine genes (not shown). Although most
of them may be pseudogenes, the others might turn out to
be intact genes if the gaps in the draft sequence are filled
by the ongoing sequencing project.
The 111 chemokine genes found in zebrafish represents a
dramatic increase when compared to the total number of
chemokine genes in human or mouse [3]. To determine
whether such an expansion of the chemokine genes
occurred in other teleosts, we also searched chemokine
genes in the genomes of two other teleost fishes, fugu
(Fugu rubripes) and its close relative Tetraodon (Tetraodon
nigroviridis). Both fugu and Tetraodon have a compact
genome of 390- and 350-Mb, respectively, and 90% of
each genome is covered by assembled sequences. Contrary to zebrafish, each pufferfish contains only 18 chemokine genes (see Additional file 1). Of them, 15 genes are
apparently the orthologous genes between the two pufferfishes.
The zebrafish chemokine genes identified in this study
were compared with those recently identified by two other
groups, DeVries et al. [20] and Peatman and Liu [19]
(Additional file 2). Fugu chemokines reported by DeVries
et al. [20] were similarly compared (Additional file 2). The
lists of the zebrafish chemokine genes made by these two
groups also included partial genes. We felt it necessary to
exclude most of the partial chemokine genes for the following analyses to avoid pseudogenes except when the
missing first or last exons of the partial genes are apparently present in the unsequenced gapped regions. Therefore, some chemokine genes reported by the two groups
are not listed in the additional file. Furthermore, genes
with different exonintron splicing junctions or genes that

are similar but not identical to the ones identified in the
present study are shown in parentheses in the file.
Nomenclature
Since no clear orthology to the mammalian chemokines
could be established for most of the fish chemokines (see
below), genes identified in this study were named as follows. Zebrafish chemokine genes were designated according to their subfamily + L standing for ligand (CCL, CXCL,
XCL, or CXL), followed by the chromosome number prefixed with chr and by alphabets to distinguish individual
genes on a given chromosome. For example, CCL-chr25a
stands for one of the CC chemokine ligand genes found
on chromosome 25. When the chemokine genomic locus
of an EST or cDNA-derived chemokine gene was
unknown, 'U' was used instead of the chromosome
number. Pufferfish chemokine genes were similarly
termed. Since the genome of fugu is organized into scaffolds that are not yet organized into chromosomes, Tetraodon chromosome numbers were used for fugu

nomenclature. For the fish genes that have already
approved gene symbols or names termed by other
researchers, they are called by their symbols or given
names.
Protein structural characteristics of fish chemokines
There are 81 CC, 25 CXC, and one XC subfamily member
genes in the zebrafish genome, but no CX3C subfamily
member has been identified. Mammalian CXC chemokines with neutrophil chemotactic activity often contain
the ELR motif (a conserved Glu-Leu-Arg sequence preceding the first cysteine) [22], but no zebrafish CXC chemokines are found to have this motif. Although zebrafish
possesses one XC subfamily member, XCL-chr2a, it shows
little homology to the mammalian XC chemokines.

Two membrane-bound chemkines, CX3CL1 and
CXCL16, are known in the mammals [3]. To explore fish
chemokines with potential transmembrane domains, the
chemokine sequences were analyzed with SOSUI. Three

zebrafish chemokines, CXCL-chr24a, CXCL-chr24b, and
CXCL-chr24d, were revealed to have one potential transmembrane segment in the COOH-terminal region (see
Additional file 3). Compared to the other chemokines
that are approximately 100 amino acids (a.a.) long, these
three chemokines are much longer (Table 1), and the
transmembrane segments are located at positions 133â
155 of CXCL-chr24a (187 a.a. long), 132â153 of
CXCLchr24b (153 a.a. long), and 133-155 of CXCLchr24d (210 a.a. long).
Just like the mammalian transmembrane chemokines,
CX3CL1 [23] and CXCL16 [24], the three zebrafish chemokines with a potential transmembrane region also have
Ser/Thr-rich mucin-like domains between the chemokine
domain and the putative transmembrane region (Table
1). Their mucin domains tether and extend the chemokine domains away from the cell surface, allowing their
efficient interaction their receptors expressed by target
cells [25,26]. Of note, more than one third of the
zebrafish chemokines with no apparent transmembrane
region are also found to have potential mucin-type O-glycosylation sites in the COOH-terminal region (Table 1).
Especially, CCL-chr25x has more than 100 possible O-glycosylation sites in the Cterminal region downstream from
the fourth conserved cysteine residue. On the other hand,
the pufferfishes have few such chemokines like mammals
(see Additional file 1).
Zebrafish has a novel chemokine gene subfamily CX
We found four possible zebrafish chemokines, CXLchr12a, CXL-chr19a, CXLchr24a, and CXL-chr24b, that
miss one of the two N-terminus conserved cysteine residues and thus retain only three signature cysteine residues
(Figure 1). (Note that the XC subfamily lacks the first and
third conserved cysteine resides.) We designated the
group of the genes as a novel CX chemokine subfamily
because two of the member genes (CXL-chr24a and CXLchr24b) are clustered with other CC chemokine genes on
chromosome 24, and one of them (CXL-chr24a) shows a
chemotactic activity (see below). Our database search
showed that this novel class chemokines does not exist in
other species. Although Gilligan et al. [27] reported identification of a similar CX chemokine fCL1 in the fugu
genome, our analysis of the recent fugu draft genome
revealed that it is actually a CC chemokine (see Additional
file 1).

These novel CX subfamily genes show low similarities to
other chemokines, but contain a tryptophan residue at the
seventh position downstream from the fourth conserved
cysteine residue often found in other chemokines (Figure
1). Furthermore, there are three additional cysteine residues that are specifically conserved among the four CX
members (Figure 1). Although we isolated one cDNA

Amino acid sequences of zebrafish CX chemokines
Amino acid sequences of zebrafish CX chemokines.
Sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL W. The five CC
chemokines closely related to the CX chemokines are also
shown. Solid boxes indicate the conserved four cysteine residues and the tryptophan residues often found seven a.a.
downstream from the fourth cysteine residue. Dotted boxes
denote the additional cysteine residues conserved among CX
chemokines. Predicted signal sequences are underlined.

clone for CXL-chr24a, there are two EST records for CXLchr12a. There are, however, no expression data available
for the other two CX members.
Phylogenetic analysis of the chemokine genes
To analyze the evolutionary relationships between the
fish and human chemokines, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. For this analysis, the chemokine sequences from
three more fish species, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and common
carp (Cyprinus carpio), were also included. Their sequences
were retrieved from the literatures [28-35] and from the
EST databases. Preliminary construction of a phlylogenetic tree using all the sequences showed two large clusters (see Additional file 4). One cluster was mainly
comprised of CC, XC, CX, and CX3C subfamily members
of all species. Interestingly, five zebrafish CXC chemokine
genes on chromosome 24 were also included in this
group. The other cluster contained only CXC chemokines
from various species. Each cluster in the tree forms a
monophyletic clade supported with a high confidence
value. However, in order to obtain a more reliable tree, a
phylogenetic tree for each cluster was constructed separately since a large number of structurally divergent

Phylogenetic analyses of fish and human chemokines
Phylogenetic analyses of fish and human chemokines. Since a large number of chemokines were analyzed, trees were
separately constructed with two groups of chemokines (A and B) using the Dayhoff matrix and the neighborjoining method.
Four subfamilies of zebrafish chemokines and other species chemokines are indicated by colors and symbols. The zebrafish
chemokine genes used in the RT-PCR analyses (Figure 5) are shown in red letters, and the genes identical or similar to those
identified by DeVries et al. [20] and Peatman and Liu [19] are shown by asterisks (see also Additional file 2). European river
lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis, jawless fish) CXC chemokine LFCA-1 and shark (Triakis scyllium, elasmobranch fish) CC chemokine
SCYA107 were also included. Numbers at branch nodes represent the confidence of interior-branch test with 1000 iterations.
Only confidence values of â¥50% are shown. The nodes of large branches are unreliable in most cases due to the low values.
Amino acid sequences of zebrafish and pufferfish chemokines are shown in Additional file 3. Abbreviations: z, zebrafish; fr, fugu;
tn, Tetraodon; h, human; ip, channel catfish; om, rainbow trout; lf, European river lamprey; ts, shark.

sequences were used. Figure 2 shows the trees of the two
clusters using the JTT matrix for the amino acid alignment.
Dayhoff's (PAM) matrix was also tested for each alignment, but the results were essentially the same (not
shown).
To root the phylogenetic trees, CXC chemokine LFCA-1 of
jawless fish river lamprey or CC chemokine SCYA107 of
elasmobranch fish shark was added in the tree construction as an outgroup. Unexpectedly, these two chemokines
are very closely related to teleost fish chemokines (Figure
2), suggesting that the chemokine family have already
existed prior to the divergence of lamprey and other
organisms. Therefore, those chemokines were not used as
an outgroup.
The majority of the fish chemokines form their own
branches that do not include human chemokines, suggesting that most fish chemokines have been generated
after the divergence of fish and mammals. A few orthologous relationships between fish and human chemokines
are inferred based on the phylogenetic trees generated by
using two matrices (Figure 2). However, based on the synteny analyses, we have identified only two definitive
orthologous relationships. Zebrafish cxcl12a and cxcl12b
are found to be orthologous to human CXCL12, and
unambiguous 1:1 orthology is observed between
zebrafish scyba and human CXCL14 (Figure 3). Human
CXCL12 and Tetraodon CXCL-chr17b are also identified as
the orthologous genes based on the phylogenetic (Figure
2B) and synteny analyses (not shown). Huising et al.
(2003) [34] and [20] also found that only CXCL12 and
CXCL14 have unambiguous orthologues in fish.
Previously, by constructing a phylogenetic tree using a collectioin of CC chemokines from four teleost species
including zebrafish, Peatman and Liu have observed four
highly related chemokine groups, CCL19/21/25, CCL20,
CCL27/28 and fish-specific groups, in the tree [36]. However, the bootstrapping support of these groups is low,
and some groups are quite large and consisting of several
branches. Our phylogenic trees also demonstrate groups
such as CCL17/20, CCL19/21/25, CCL27/28 and fishspecific groups (Figure 2A). In the fish-specific groups of our
tree, there are several subgroups containing only zebrafish
or catfish chemokines. Notably, such zebrafish chemokines are located on the same chromosomes, suggesting
their species-specific amplification by tandem duplication
(see below). Although Peatman and Liu also described the
presence of large MIP and MCP CC chemokine groups in
their tree [36], such groups are not found in our tree most
probably due to the usage of different alignment and tree
construction methods. In the CXC chemokines, one
CXCL11 group and two fish-specific groups are evident in
addition to the orthologous groups of CXCL12 and

CXCL14 (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the chemokine genes
reported by DeVries et al. [20] and Peatman and Liu [19]
are clearly found within each group of chemokines. Thus,
the CX group and neighboring CC genes on chromosome
24 only identified in the present study constitutes truly a
novel gene cluster in the zebrafish genome.
Genome organization of the zebrafish chemokine genes
The zebrafish chemokine genes are distributed on 17 different chromosomes, but 10 genes have not yet been
localized on any chromosomes. There are two large chemokine gene clusters in the zebrafish genome, located on
chromosomes 24 and 25 containing 29 and 21 genes,
respectively (Figure 4). Other genes are present in miniclusters or as single genes on 15 different chromosomes.
In contrast to the mammalian chemokine gene organization, genes of different subfamilies, CC, CXC, XC, and CX,
are co-localized in a large cluster on zebrafish chromosome 24, even though the largest cluster on zebrafish
chromosome 25 consists of only CC subfamily genes. The

single zebrafish XC chemokine gene, XCL-chr2a, is
located within a mini-cluster of CC genes on chromosome
2, while the mammalian XC chemokine genes are located
separate from other chemokine genes. When the genome
organization is compared with the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2), zebrafish genes consisting of the same major or
mini-clusters also tend to locate in the same branches of
the phylogenetic tree. For example, the majority of the CC
chemokine genes from the major clusters on chromosomes 24 and 25 form separate branches consisting of
only zebrafish genes in the phylogenetic tree. Similarly,
the CXC and CC mini-cluster genes on chromosomes 5
and 20 form separate branches, respectively. These results
suggest that the cluster genes arose from extensive tandem
duplication events following the divergence of zebrafish
and other teleosts. In the catfish genome, tandem duplications might have also occurred on some chromosomes as
three branches consisting of only catfish CC chemokines
are present in the tree (Figure 2A). In addition, when the
major cluster on chromosome 25 is analyzed by dot-plot
analyses (not shown), three direct or inverted repeats,
each containing several chemokine genes, are found (Figure 4). Most of the genes in one of the repeat units are
identical or more than 90% similar to the corresponding
genes in other repeat units (Additional file 5). Collectively, these genome structures strongly suggest that relatively recent segmental duplication events were involved
in the expansion of the zebrafish chemokine genes.
As mentioned above, the major cluster on zebrafish chromosome 24 contains three different subfamily members.
The five CXC genes in the cluster form a separate branch
in the phylogenetic tree along with other CC chemokine
branches. Similarly, two CX genes in the gene cluster
(CXL-chr24a and CXL-chr24b) and two other CX genes on
other chromosomes (CXL-chr19a and CXL-chr12a) form
a separate branch with some CC genes on chromosome
24 in the tree. These results suggest that these CXC and CX
genes were generated from CC genes in zebrafish.
A close inspection of the CX and the neighboring CC
genes on chromosome 24 has further supported their derivation from a common ancestor gene. First, although the
number of coding exons in the chemokine genes is generally three or four, the coding sequences of the CX and the
five neighboring CC genes on chromosome 24 are split
into five exons (Figure 4). Second, the neighboring CC
chemokines also contain two or three of the three extra
cysteine residues specifically conserved among the CX
subfamily (Figure 1). These common structural features
indicate that the two CX genes on the chromosome 24
were generated in the zebrafish genome by successive tandem duplication events from the neighboring CC chemokines with five exons. Of note, two CC genes on
chromosome 17, CCL-chr17b and CCL-chr17c, also con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/222

tain one or three of the additional cysteine residues (see
Additional file 3) and consist of five coding exons (Figure
4). Furthermore, both genes are in the same branch in the
phylogenetic tree with the CX genes (Figure 2A). These
features suggest that one of the duplicated CX immediate
ancestor genes have translocated to another chromosome.
Developmentally regulated zebrafish chemokine gene
expression
Zebrafish embryonic development is rapid [12]. At about
two days post fertilization all common vertebrate specific
body features can be seen, including a compartmentalized
brain, eyes, ears, and all internal organs. The zebrafish larvae are able to swim as early as five days after fertilization
and become adults at around three months later. Macrophages have been identified in zebrafish as early as 15
hours post fertilization (hpf) [37], and neutrophilic granulocytes circulate by 48 hpf [38,39].

In order to investigate the gene expression pattern of
zebrafish chemokines in the early embryonic developmental stages, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR
analysis using primers for 23 representative chemokine
genes (Figure 5). These genes were selected based on the
sequence similarity to other member genes, and indicated
with red letters in the phylogenetic trees (Figure 2). The
highly similar genes were excluded from the present analysis, and the primers (Table 3) were carefully designed not
to cross-amplify other genes. However, we can not formally exclude the possibility that there exist undiscovered
genes that closely resemble to any of the selected genes.
Three previously reported chemokine genes, ccl1, cxcl12a,
and scyba, were also included.
Most of the examined chemokine genes started to be
expressed at the specific embryonic stages and their
expression continued until six months after fertilization.
However, there are some exceptions. The transcripts of
CCL-chr25s, CCL-chr20d, and CCL-chr5b were expressed
mainly in adults, whereas those of CXL-chr24a and CCLchr11b were detected only at certain developmental
stages, i.e., 36â120 hpf. The expression levels of the most
genes examined were gradually increased during the
embryonic (4â48 hpf) and early larval (72â120 hpf)
stages, especially CCL-chr24a and CXCl-chr13c being
almost exclusively expressed at early larval periods. Interestingly, the CCL-chr5b was expressed temporarily
between 4 and 12 hpf albeit at low levels, and again in the
adult stage at much higher levels. In contrast, CCL-chr5a,
CCLchrUi, cxcl12a, and ccl1 were expressed throughout
the developmental stages from 0 hpf to adults, although
their expression levels in eggs at 0 hpf were quite low compared to those of the other embryonic stages. These results
suggest that most of the chemokines tested might have
some roles during the zebrafish development.

Zebrafish chemokine CXL-chr24a has a chemotactic
activity
CCL-chr11a and CXL-chr24a with a (His)6 tag at the C-terminus were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified from
the culture supernatants with a His-binding Niaffinity column. To test the chemotactic activity of the recombinant
proteins, leukocytes were prepared from the common
carp, which belongs to the same family, Cyprinidae, as
zebrafish. The phylogenetic tree also indicates the close
relativeness of both fishes (Figure 2). Recombinant CXLchr24a showed a potent chemotactic activity for leukocytes from 0.033 to 33 nM (Figure 6A). Like other chemotactic molecules, the activity was decreased at higher
ligand concentrations. The attracted cells were mainly
neutrophils and lymphocytes (not shown). In contrast,
recombinant CCL-chr11a showed little chemotactic activity for carp leukocytes (Figure 6B). This may be due to the
lack of receptor expression or weak cross reactivity by carp
leukocytes.

Discussion
Our previous analyses of human and mouse chemokine
gene clusters have shown substantial species differences,
including species-specific expansions of gene subsets,
gene deletions, and generation of a fusion gene [40-43].
Our analysis of old world monkey genome have also
revealed that chemokine gene clusters are the subject of

frequent birth-and-death events even after the divergence
of primates [44]. Recent completion of the chimpanzee
genome sequencing revealed that the chemokine family is
one of the most rapidly evolving gene clusters [45]. Our
present analyses also show that the chemokine family has
expanded its member genes in zebrafish due to extensive
gene duplication events after the divergence of zebrafish
and other teleosts.
In sharp contrast to the large number of genes for the ligands of the chemokine superfamily in zebrafish, our preliminary search has revealed only 26 putative chemokine
receptor genes in the zebrafish genome (not shown).
DeVries et al. also identified only 24 chemokine receptor
genes in zebrafish [20]. This large gene number difference
between the ligand and receptor genes might indicate that
chemokine genes had duplicated more rapidly than the
receptor genes. However, since the chemokine receptor
gene family belongs to the large G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, it is difficult to distinguish chemokine receptor genes from other GPCR genes in some
cases. Therefore, the receptor gene number in the
zebrafish genome might be underestimated, and there is a
possibility that the fishspecific chemokines, particularly
the CX chemokines, may bind to receptors substantially
different from other chemokine receptors and thus may
be difficult to identify by the standard database search.

Duplication of genes is believed to be the major force in
the evolution of eukaryotic organisms and increases the
diversity in expression and function [46]. In zebrafish,
extensive duplication events have occurred on some chromosomes and generated a novel subfamily CX and some
CXC member genes from the neighboring CC genes. Such
duplications increased the number of chemokine genes,
particularly inflammatory genes, and might have provided a survival advantage to zebrafish, which is a fresh
water fish in temperate regions and possibly confronted
with a constant threat of invasion by infectious agents.
Another fresh water fish, catfish, might have recently
expanded its chemokine gene members by duplication

since catfish chemokines tend to form separate groups in
the phylogenetic trees (Figure 2). In sharp contrast, pufferfish, a marine or brackish water fish, might have much
less chemokine genes in part due to an alternative strategy
for their survival and in part due to their dwelling environment. Recently, the draft genome sequence for Medaka
(Oryzias latipes) has been reported [9]. The genome size of
Medaka is about 700 Mb, the size intermediate between
those of zebrafish and pufferfish, and Medaka diverged
from the pufferfish lineages about 98 Myr ago by the fossile data [10] or 191 Myr ago by the molecular data [11]
after the split of zebrafish. It is therefore interesting to see

Page 13 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:222

how many chemokine genes the Medaka genome contains and also how well the chemokine genes are shared
between Medaka and zebrafish.
Not all chemokine genes have undergone rapid evolution.
Some human and fish chemokine genes are orthologous
based on the phylogenetic trees and syntenic relationship,
indicating that they existed prior to the split of fish and
mammals (Figure 2). Their human orthologs, CXCL12,
and CXCL14, are known as the homeostatic chemokines
that have pivotal roles in the development and the maintenance of the functional integrity of the organism. Since
the genes have been conserved throughout the evolution
and are thus more close to ancestral genes, they are not
located in the major gene clusters and belong to the minior non-cluster chemokines in both zebrafish (Figure 4)
and mammals [3]. In addition to these orthologous genes,
several gene groups that include human genes are
observed in the trees (Figure 2). Most human genes in
such groups are homeostatic chemokines. However,
chemokines in these groups cannot be categorized as
orthologous and are not located in the syntenic loci.
Therefore, their genes might have been derived from common ancestor genes and are the paralogous genes generated by duplications, but their true orthologous genes
might have been drifted in sequence too much or even
deleted during evolution. Alternatively, the true orthologous genes or ESTs have not been sequenced yet. It has
been shown that a substantial number of chemokine
genes in the chicken genome had already existed before
the divergence between aves and mammals [47]. Therefore, a considerable number of chemokine genes might
have been lost in fish after the divergence of fish and the
lineage leading to aves and mammals.
Genome analyses of teleosts including fugu and zebrafish
have led to a hypothesis that a whole-genome duplication
occurred in the teleost lineage 370 Myr ago during the
early evolution of teleosts [8,48,49]. One example of the
genes generated by the whole-genome duplication may be
cxcl12a gene on chromosome 13 and cxcl12b or cxcl12bL
genes on chromosome 22. However, most of the expansion of chemokine genes in zebrafish can not be attributed to the whole-genome duplication. The phylogenetic
and gene organization analyses suggest that extensive
intrachromosomal duplication events have occurred in a
zebrafish-specific manner after the wholegenome duplication. Particularly, tandem duplications on chromosomes
24 and 25 apparently contributed to the increase in the
number of chemokine genes in the zebrafish genome.
Catfish might have also increased the different chemokine
members by the tandem duplication events in a lineagespecific manner.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/222

Taking advantage of genetic resources such as EST libraries, identification of chemokine genes has been pursued
in other fish species such as catfish [28,29,50], trout
[31,32], carp [33,35], and cichlid fish [51]. These studies
have also shown the existence of species-specific chemokines in each species and the conservation of homeostatic
chemokines across species. Each species thus might have
acquired and maintained high levels of genetic diversity
and the rapid sequence divergence rate in the chemokine
superfamily during evolution in order to cope with their
respective environmental challenges.
One of the most striking results obtained in this study is
the finding of a novel chemokine subfamily CX, which
has not been identified in other organisms so far. The
genome and gene structures suggest that the generation of
this subfamily is the result of the extensive tandem duplication events in the zebrafish genome (Figures 1 and 4).
Not only the sequence-structure (Figure 1) but also the in
vitro chemotactic activity (Figure 6A) showed that it is
truly the fifth subfamily of the chemokine superfamily.
The highly conserved four cysteine residues in the chemokine molecules are involved in the formation of two
disulfide bridges, between the first and the third and
between the second and the fourth [52]. Since the CX subfamily lacks one of the two N-terminus cysteine residues
but retain the third and fourth cysteine residues together
with three additional subfamily-specific cysteine residues,
it is interesting to see how they are folded into a threedimensional structure.
Another interesting result is the observation of the developmentally regulated expression of zebrafish chemokine
genes (Figure 5). In particular, CXL-chr24a and CCLchr11b mRNAs are mainly expressed for a short period of
time during the embryonic development but not in
adults. These results suggest that each chemokine has
highly specific biological functions during the embryonic
development other than previously conceived. The
involvement of cxcl12a and its receptor cxcr4 in the
directed migration of primordial germ cells in zebrafish
embryos has been shown [15], and similar observations
have been reported in chicken and mouse [53,54]. Therefore, characterization of other chemokine functions in
embryos may elucidate the molecular basis of the
dynamic movements of various types of cells during vertebrate development. Zebrafish is a model organism suitable for such studies, and our identification and
characterization of the zebrafish chemokine genes may be
useful for such studies.

Conclusion
We present the most extensive overall analysis of the
chemokine repertoire in zebrafish and compare this to
those of other fishes and human. By comparing the chem-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:222

okine sequences predicted from the zebrafish draft
sequence with those of isolated cDNAs and ESTs, the
sequences have been manually curated to ascertain a
higher level of completeness and quality. Of the species
reported previously and two species of pufferfish analyzed
here, zebrafish is found to contain the greatest number of
chemokine genes comprising CXC, CC and XC subfamilies and a novel subfamily CX. The CX subfamily
members lack one of the four cysteine residues highly
conserved among the chemokines. One of the CX subfamily members has been proven to be chemotactic for
carp leukocytes and to be expressed during a short period
time during the embryogenesis, suggesting a role in the
developmental processes. Based on the analyses on the
genome organization, phylogenetic trees, and synteny,
zebrafish chemokines can be divided into zebrafish-specific genes including CX subfamily members, fish-specifi
genes, several genes moderately similar to human chemokines, and genes orthologous to human homeostatic
chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL14. The fish- or zebrafishspecific chemokines are the most abundant in zebrafish
and it is apparent that most of these genes were generated
by extensive duplication events only in fish or zebrafish
lineages. These chemokines have unique protein structures and gene expression patterns and might be specifically involved in the development and the adult body
plans of zebrafish.

Methods
Gene prediction
Human chemokine protein sequences were used as queries to search the zebrafish (6th version), fugu (4th version), and Tetraodon (7th version) genomic databases at
Ensembl [55]. The EST database at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information [56] was similarly searched.
The searches were repeated using the identified fish chemokine genes and ESTs as queries to identify homologous
genes that were hard to be detected by initial searches
using the human sequences. Once the fish chemokine
gene loci were identified, the surrounding genome
sequences were analyzed by exon-predicting program
GenScan [57] to detect exons containing amino acid residues conserved among chemokines. Since our predictions
of exons and exonintron junctions were based on the
comparison with other chemokine genes, mRNAs, ESTs,
or proteins, the chemokine sequences described in this
study were often different from the NCBI RefSeq provisional records (accession prefix XM_) or the Ensembl
genes, which are model mRNAs generated in an automated fashion in the genome annotation process.
Zebrafish maintenance
Adult zebrafish were maintained in a cycle of 14 h light
and 10 h darkness per day in 28.5Â°C water. Embryos were
incubated in 1/3 Ringer's solution (39 mM NaCl, 0.97

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/222

mM KCl, 1. 8 mM CaCl2, 1. 7 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) in a
28.5Â°C water bath. Developmental stages were determined by embryo morphology and hours post fertilization (hpf) [12].
Isolation of zebrafish chemokine cDNAs
Total RNAs were prepared from various embryonic stages,
0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 70, 120 hpf, and adults (six
months) using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
The RNAs were reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT. The
double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized using PrimeStar
HS DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan). These
cDNAs were mixed to isolate chemokine cDNAs. The
primer sequences were designed based on the genome or
EST sequences (Table 2). The PCR condition was 30 cycles
of 98Â°C for 10 s, 60Â°C for 5 s and 72Â°C for 1 min. The 5'
cDNA fragment of CCL-chrUi was obtained by the RACE
(rapid amplification of cDNA ends) method using the
Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto,
CA) as described previously [58]. The gene-specific primer
5'-CCATTTCAGCTGAGGGTCCACACAG was derived
from an EST sequence (GenBank accession number
BQ615577). The complete cDNA was isolated by RTPCR
with the primers in Table 2. To avoid individual differences observed in some isolated cDNA clones, amino acid
sequences derived from the draft genome sequences were
used for the phylogenetic analyses as far as the genomic
sequences of the genes are available. The nucleotide
sequences of the cloned cDNAs were deposited in GenBank under successive accession numbers AB331747â
AB331780 (see Table 1).
Computational methods
Signal sequences and O-glycosylation sites were predicted
by SignalIP 3.0 [59] and NetOGlyc 3.1 [60], respectively.
Transmembrane regions were determined by SOSUI [61].
For phylogenetic analysis, the zebrafish and pufferfish
chemokine protein sequences, together with those of
human, were aligned with MAFFT [62] and corrected by a
visual inspection. For this alignment, sequences corresponding to the chemokine domain (Pfam PF00048 [63])
were extracted. Amino acid distance matrices, JTT (JonesTaylor-Thornton) or Dayhoff's (PAM), were then used to
infer phylogenetic trees by the neighbor-joining method
implemented in the MEGA program package version 3
[64]. Statistical support for the clustering was inferred
using the interior-branch test [65]. As the number of
sequences in the tree increases, the bootstrap test usually
underestimates the extent of statistical support of clusters
[65]. The interior-branch test is therefore more preferable
for the present analysis than the bootstrap test. Human
and other sequences used for the tree construction were
taken from the NCBI reference and GenBank files, respectively: XCL1, NP_002986; XCL2, NP_003166; CCL1,

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR
RT-PCR was performed using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen).
The primers used are listed in Table 3. The amplification
conditions, which were carefully chosen to obtain signals
in a linear amplification range, were denaturation at 94Â°C
for 30 s, annealing at 60Â°C for 30 s, and extension at 72Â°C
for 30 s for 32 cycles for the chemokines tested, and 23
cycles for Î²-actin. Amplification products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels.
Chemokine protein preparation
Zebrafish CXL-chr24a and CCL-chr11a were expressed as
a secreted protein containing a (His)6 COOH-terminal
tag. For this purpose, the chemokine coding sequences
were amplified by PCR with the following primers. CXLchr24a, 5'-TTTGGTACCATGCATCTGTCCTCTGTATCTCA
and 5'-TTTTCTAGAAGCCTCCCCTCTACACGTTAC. CCLchr11a, 5'-TTTGGTACCATGGAAACGCAGAGTTCAACC
and 5'-TTTTCTAGACATAGCTCTTTTGTTTTTCTCAT. The
PCR condition was as described in the above 'Isolation of
zebrafish chemokine cDNAs'. After digestion with KpnI
and XbaI, the products were ligated into the KpnI/XbaI
sites of pEF4/Myc-His A vector (Invitrogen). To produce
the recombinant proteins, human embryonic kidney
HEK293 cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with the
expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were maintained for 3 days in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with
10% FCS. The chemokines tagged with (His)6 swere purified in a single step with a His-binding Ni-affinity column
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) to a purity >95%.
Chemotaxis assay
Leukocytes of the common carp were prepared essentially
as described previously [66]. Cell suspension of the head
and body kidneys was layered on an isotonic Percoll (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, England) solution of the
specific gravity of 1.090. After centrifugation at 550 g for
40 min, the leukocyte fraction on the Percoll layer was collected and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution
(HBSS) containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 (HBSS-H). Leukocytes were resuspended in the same buffer and used for
chemotaxis assays in a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber
(Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg, MD) as described previously
[66]. Briefly, the lower compartments of the microchamber were filled with dilutions of chemokine (25 Âµl) or
with control buffer, and the upper compartments with 38
Âµl of leukocyte suspension (1 Ã 106 scells/ml). The two
compartments were separated by a 5-Âµm pore size (PVPfree) polycarbonate filters (Neuro Probe). After incubation at 25Â°C for 2 h, the filters were removed from the
chambers, and the cells that migrated into the lower wells

were counted with an improved Neubauer's counting
plate (Hirschmann Laborgerate, Eberstadt, Germany). All
assays were done in triplicate and the results were
expressed as the mean number of cells per 0.4 mm3. To
determine the cell types attracted by chemokines, cells
migrated into the lower wells were analyzed by the MayGrunwald-Giemsa staining.

Amino acid nucleotide sequences of zebrafish and pufferfish chemokines in FASTA format. Amino acid nucleotide sequences of zebrafish and
pufferfish chemokines in FASTA format. To avoid individual differences
observed in some isolated cDNA clones, amino acid sequences shown in
this figure are derived from draft genome sequences as long as the genomic
sequences for the genes are available. Small letters indicate signal
sequences. Red letters show the conserved cysteine residues and the WV
(tryptophan and valine) motif, and green letters the three cysteine residues
observed in the CX subfamily and some CC members. The amino acid residues at the splicing sites and the transmembrane regions are highlighted
in grey and green, respectively. Abbreviations: z, zebrafish; f, fugu; t,
Tetraodon.
