Abstract
Background: Vibrio vulnificus is the leading cause of reported death from consumption of seafood in the United
States. Despite several decades of research on molecular pathogenesis, much remains to be learned about the
mechanisms of virulence of this opportunistic bacterial pathogen. The two complete and annotated genomic DNA
sequences of V. vulnificus belong to strains of clade 2, which is the predominant clade among clinical strains. Clade
2 strains generally possess higher virulence potential in animal models of disease compared with clade 1, which
predominates among environmental strains. SOLiD sequencing of four V. vulnificus strains representing different
clades (1 and 2) and biotypes (1 and 2) was used for comparative genomic analysis.
Results: Greater than 4,100,000 bases were sequenced of each strain, yielding approximately 100-fold coverage for
each of the four genomes. Although the read lengths of SOLiD genomic sequencing were only 35 nt, we were
able to make significant conclusions about the unique and shared sequences among the genomes, including
identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Comparative analysis of the newly sequenced genomes to the
existing reference genomes enabled the identification of 3,459 core V. vulnificus genes shared among all six strains
and 80 clade 2-specific genes. We identified 523,161 SNPs among the six genomes.
Conclusions: We were able to glean much information about the genomic content of each strain using next
generation sequencing. Flp pili, GGDEF proteins, and genomic island XII were identified as possible virulence
factors because of their presence in virulent sequenced strains. Genomic comparisons also point toward the
involvement of sialic acid catabolism in pathogenesis.

Background
Vibrio vulnificus is an opportunistic pathogen that
causes sepsis in humans after ingestion of contaminated
raw oysters or wound infection and necrotizing fasciitis
from contamination of wounds (for a review see [1,2]).
The mortality rates for sepsis and wound infection are
~50% and ~15%, respectively. During infection of
humans the bacteria replicate rapidly, extensively invade
tissues, and cause severe tissue destruction. Mouse models of infection coupled with molecular genetic analysis

have identified several virulence factors partially explaining the high mortality and extreme tissue destruction,
most importantly, polysaccharide capsule [3,4], RtxA1
toxin [5-7], acquisition of iron [8,9], pili [10,11], and flagella [12,13]. However, these factors do not completely
explain the remarkable virulence of V. vulnificus.
V. vulnificus can be classified in several different manners. One of the first classification schemes was based
on biochemical reactions of strains initially yielding two
biotypes: biotype 1 most often associated with contamination of oysters and causing human disease and biotype 2 associated with infection of eels [14]. Recently, a
third biotype that caused wound infection from handling
fish in Israel was identified [15]. Genetic analysis using

analysis of ribosomal RNA loci [16,17], multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) [18-20], and virulence-correlated gene (vcg) PCR [21] revealed that V. vulnificus
strains could be divided into two groups. While the
descriptors for these two groups vary (clades, populations, clusters, and lineages), the terms clade 1 and
clade 2 are used here to follow the MLST clusters of
Bisharat et al. [19]. Biotype 1 strains are present in both
clades, whereas biotype 2 strains are present only in
clade 1. Based on MLST analysis, biotype 3 strains
appear to be a hybrid between clades 1 and 2 [18].
Clade 1 strains are most often isolated from environmental samples, while clade 2 strains are most often
associated with human disease. Because of these epidemiological patterns, many investigators hypothesized
that clade 2 strains possess inherently greater virulence.
In an analysis of 69 biotype 1 V. vulnificus strains, we
recently determined that both clade 1 and clade 2
strains have the ability to cause severe skin infection in
subcutaneously inoculated iron dextran-treated mice
(Thiaville, P.C. et al., Infect. Immun, submitted; Jones,
M. et al., in preparation). The major distinction between
the clades was that clade 2 strains had a greater propensity to cause systemic infection and death in the mouse
model, although there were some attenuated clade 2
strains and highly virulent clade 1 strains.
Analysis of the genomic DNA sequences of clade 1
and clade 2 strains would contribute to the identification of genetic differences among strains. As microbes
engage in lateral gene transfer and are often highly
divergent in genomic content, this study could help
identify genes responsible for the differences in virulence between these clades. Both of the complete and
annotated V. vulnificus genomes are of clade 2 strains,
CMCP6 (GenBank accession numbers AE016795 and
AE016796) and YJ016 (GenBank accession numbers
BA000037, BA000037, AP005352). The lack of genomic sequence data from clade 1 strains is a serious
impediment to understanding the differences in virulence between the two clades and in dissecting the
virulence of V. vulnificus in general. We therefore
undertook the present study to rapidly and economically obtain genomic sequence of numerous V. vulnificus

strains representing both clades and the two major
biotypes.
We hypothesized that clade 2 strains are more virulent, at least in part, because they contain unique virulence genes that are missing in most clade 1 strains.
Therefore, identifying DNA sequences common to clade
2 strains and missing from clade 1 strains would create
a set of putative virulence genes that could be subsequently experimentally examined. Because of the propensity of clade 1 strains to be associated with oysters,
these strains may possess unique genes enabling colonization of shellfish. Therefore, unique clade 1 genes offer
insight into the Vibrio-oyster relationship. However, not
all genes uniquely associated with one clade will be
involved with interactions with animal hosts, and virulence genes will not necessarily be present only in virulent genotypes. An example of the former is that the
ability of V. vulnificus to ferment mannitol is associated
with the cluster of strains that we are calling clade 2
most often derived from clinical cases [22], and an
example of the latter is the nearly universal presence of
the RtxA1 toxin in both virulent and attenuated V. vulnificus strains (Joseph, J.L., et al., in preparation). Finally,
by comparing the genomes of a variety of strains representing the different clades and biotypes, the set of
genes in the V. vulnificus genome shared by all V. vulnificus strains can be identified. Over and above identifying relationships between the presence and/or absence
of genes among strains, identifying single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) could also reveal the genetic
basis for differential virulence and shellfish-colonizing
phenotypes, as well as other phenotypes.
Given these goals, we used the SOLiD sequencing system
on four V. vulnificus strains, each of which represented
a unique genotype/virulence phenotype combination
(Table 1). V. vulnificus M06-24/O [4] is a typical clade
2 strain exhibiting a high level of virulence in the subcutaneously inoculated iron dextran-treated mouse
model [23-25]. Strain 99-520 DP-B8 [25] is a typical
clade 1 strain that can infect skin tissues but is defective at causing systemic infection and death in the
mouse model. Strain 99-738 DP-B5 [25] is an unusual
clade 1 strain that is highly virulent in the mouse

model, causing systemic infection and death. ATCC
33149 [26] is typical biotype 2 strain isolated from
an eel. Using SOLiD sequencing enabled us to obtain
approximately 100X coverage with 35-nt reads among
four genomes. This selection of strains analyzed with
SOLiD sequencing enabled comparative genomics to be
performed and identified clade 2-specific genomic
sequences and the genes of V. vulnificus shared among
all of the strains sequenced to date.

Results
Numbers of SOLiD sequencing reads

We performed SOLiD sequencing on the genomes of
four V. vulnificus strains to increase the understanding
of the genetic differences between the two major clades
and the biotypes of this organism and to possibly identify sequences associated with differences in virulence
potential in our subcutaneously inoculated iron dextrantreated mouse model [23-25]. V. vulnificus 99-520 DPB8 and 99-738 DP-B5 are clade 1 strains, typically isolated from environmental sources. Strain 99-520 DP-B8
exhibits the typical attenuated virulence of clade 1
strains, i.e., it can cause skin infection but is defective at
causing systemic infection and death. In contrast, strain
99-738 DP-B5 exhibits a high level virulence more characteristic of clade 2 strains, i.e., it causes skin infection,
systemic infection, and death (Thiaville, P.C., et al.,
Infect. Immun., submitted). V. vulnificus M06-24/O is a
typical clade 2 strain with full virulence that has been
widely used in examining molecular pathogenesis by
many laboratories [4]. V. vulnificus ATCC 33149 is a
biotype 2 strain isolated from an eel [26]. Genomic DNA
from each of these strains was loaded onto one-fourth of
a 25 mm × 75 mm SOLiD™ slide for sequencing on an
Applied Biosystems SOLiD™ apparatus at the University
of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology
Research, as described in the Methods. The total numbers of 35-bp reads for each strain were as follows: 99520 DP-B8 - 3.16 × 10 7 , 99-738 DP-B5 - 3.21 × 10 7 ,
M06-24/O - 3.50 × 107, and ATCC 33149 - 3.38 × 107.
These totals represented putative 210- to 239-fold coverage of each of the genomes, on the assumption that all of
the data were usable. The reads from each of the four
newly sequenced genomes have been deposited into the
NCBI Short Read Archive (accession number
SRA009283.2).
Comparison of SOLiD sequencing reads to reference
V. vulnificus genomes

Reads were mapped onto the two reference V. vulnificus
genomes, CMCP6 and YJ016 using MAQ [27]. This analysis enabled the identification of DNA sequences and ORFs
that were present in the newly sequenced strains that have
already been described in the reference strains. Graphical

representation of the coverage of the CMCP6 and YJ016
genomes by the reads from each of the four newly
sequenced V. vulnificus strains is shown in Figure 1.
We then mapped reads to plasmids described for biotype 2 V. vulnificus and whose DNA sequences are known
(pR99, pC4602-1, and pC4602-2) [28]. As expected,
greater than 90% of all three of these reference sequences
were matched to reads from biotype 2 ATCC 33149, and
lesser homologies were observed for the biotype 1 strains
(Additional File 1, Table S1). For clade 1 strains, between
37 and 56% of these plasmid sequences matched with 99738 DP-B5, and only 6 to 20% of plasmid sequenced
matched the SOLiD reads from strain 99-520 DP-B8.
These results suggested that 99-738 DP-B5 would have a
plasmid, whereas 99-520 DP-B8 would not, and we confirmed this by gel electrophoresis of extracted plasmid
DNA (data not shown). The reads from strain M06-24/O,
which is a clade 2 strain and least related to the other
strains, only matched to 1% of plasmid pC4602-1 and
failed to match to any sequences of plasmids pC4602-2
and pR99. This is in agreement with M06-24/O not having
a plasmid [29].
Despite the prediction of approximately 210-fold coverage based on the raw number of reads obtained for each
genome, coverage was actually on the order of 100-fold.
In total, 45% to 64% of the raw sequencing reads mapped
to one of the two reference genomes, leaving a considerable number of unmapped reads. Some of these reads
were of low complexity and may represent sequencing
error. Because approximately 14% of both CMCP6 and
YJ016 are low complexity, these unmapped reads also
may be derived from regions of low complexity in the
sequenced genomes. It is a limitation of the short read
technology that we cannot distinguish among these scenarios. For the remaining unmapped reads that were not
of low complexity, there are two possibilities: these reads
represented truly unique sequences for the newly
sequenced genomes or these reads were errors in the
sequencing system. In an attempt to separate these two
possibilities, these unmapped reads were compared to
several bacterial genomes by mapping the reads in
SOLiD colorspace using MAQ [27]. This would identify
orthologs of V. vulnificus strains in other species. The
largest number of matches (273,045) was found with the
genomic sequence of V. cholerae NC16961 (GenBank
accession numbers AE003852 and AE003852). (Additional File 2, Table S2). These V. cholerae matches
yielded 20 genes in total from the four sequenced genomes. Of these V. cholerae genes, sixteen were identified
from only a single V. vulnificus strain. Other novel genes
may still be found, but they would be genes not previously identified in any other bacterial genomes.
There were between 15 and 22 million unmatched
reads for each of the newly sequenced genomes. The

sequenced genomes. The depth of coverage (number of matched 35-nt reads per 100-nt window of the reference genomes) is plotted for
both chromosomes of the reference CMCP6 and YJ016 genomes and the YJ016 plasmid. The source strain for the reads being matched are as
follows: M06 - M06-24/O, B5 - 99-738 DP-B5, B8 - 99-520 DP-B8, ATCC - ATCC 33149. It should be noted that coverage of the reference genomes
is not as continuous as it appears in the figures.

cause of such a large amount of data with no similarity
to known genes cannot be explained by low complexity
alone, as many of these reads are not of low complexity.
While it remains possible that novel genes are included
in these data, it is also possible that these reads are just
noise from the technology.

Figure 1, which graphically shows the coverage of
the reference genome elements by each of the newly
sequenced genomic reads, reveals large regions on each
of the reference genomic elements for which there were
no matched reads from each of the newly sequenced
genomes. Detailed comparisons of coverage generated

lists of the genes of CMCP6 and YJ016 lacking significant depth of coverage from the newly sequenced reads
(Additional File 3, Table S3A and Additional File 4,
Table S3B, respectively). There were 309 ORFs unique
to CMCP6 and 489 ORFS unique to YJ016 relative to
the other five sequenced strains. In CMCP6 chromosome 1, two large regions that were not present in any
of the four newly sequenced genomes included genes
VV1_0063 to VV1_0124 and VV1_0374 to VV1_0400.
These regions, which were also missing from YJ016,
appear to encode phage genomes. They contain genes
annotated as bacteriophage phi 1.45 protein-like protein
(VV1_0066), P2-like prophage tail protein × (VV1_0086),
phage integrase (VV1_0372), or they resembled other
mobile genetic elements with putative transposases
(VV1_0385, VV1_0386).
Another CMCP6-specific region spanned the beginning
and ends of chromosome 1 (genes VV1_0001 to
VV1_0011 and VV1_3192 to VV1_3205). This region
also appeared to encode a phage or other mobile genetic
element. A smaller CMCP6-specific region located at
genes VV1_0777 to VV1_0781 appeared to encode sugar
metabolism genes possibly involved in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) or capsular biosynthesis. CMCP6 chromosome 2
contained a very large region at genes VV2_0630 to
VV2_0712 not present in any other strains. This region
appeared to have been derived from a mobile genetic
element, either a phage or transposon. There were also
smaller regions unique to CMCP6 on chromosome 2.
The YJ016 genome similarly contained numerous
regions that were not present in any of the other newly
sequenced genomes. On chromosome 1, YJ016-specific
genes were located at VV0130 to VV0165, VV0343 to
VV0367, VV0514 to VV0559, VV0799 to VV0817, and
VV2191 to VV2262. The largest of these YJ106 regions
at VV2191 to VV2262 appeared to be phage-related.
A similar pattern was evident for YJ016 chromosome 2.
A very large YJ106-specific region spanning VVA0825
to VVA0888 was notable. This region consisted mainly
of hypothetical proteins, but there is a possibility that
this region is phage-related, as VVA0886 is annotated as
a phage integrase.
The coverage of the YJ106 plasmid, which encodes 69
genes, was very different among the four newly
sequenced genomes. The genomes containing the most
matches were 99-738 DP-B5 and ATCC 33149, with 50
and 44 genes, respectively, matched to the YJ016 plasmid. As expected, both 99-738 DP-B5 and ATCC 33149
contain plasmids. None of the YJ016 plasmid genes
matched to the reads of 99-520 DP-B8 or M06-24/O,
neither of which contains plasmids.
V. vulnificus, like other Vibrio species, encodes a
super-integron on its large chromosome [30]. Integrons
are specific regions of genomic sequence that have the

Page 5 of 16

ability to accumulate gene cassettes via site-specific
recombination [31]. They are located in genomes at attI
sites and contain a site-specific integrase, intI, that mediates acquisition of gene cassettes at repetitive attC sites,
which are generally conserved among closely related
bacteria. The vibrio integrons are called super-integrons
because of their unusually large sizes [32]. In CMCP6
the super-integron spans genes VV1_2401 to VV1_2501,
and in YJ016 the super-integron spans genes VV1745 to
VV1941. As shown in Additional File 3, Table S3A and
Additional File 4, Table S3B, the genes encoded within
these super-integrons are mostly strain-specific, not having significant homology with the four newly sequenced
genomes or each other. It is interesting that the superintegrons did not appear in Figure 1 as missing from
the newly sequenced genomes, most likely because of
the attC sites and presence of infrequent homologous
genes between the genomes.
In contrast to identifying sequences missing from the
newly sequenced genomes, we also identified the genes
shared among all of the six genomes, thereby identifying
the core V. vulnificus genome. Up to this point, shared
genes based on the two reference genomes numbered
3,915 genes. Adding our four newly sequenced genomes,
there are 3,459 genes common to all sequenced V. vulnificus strains, listed in Additional File 5, Table S4. The
number of shared genes can only get smaller as more
genomes are sequenced. Since there are 4,473 proteincoding genes in the CMCP6 genome and 5,024 proteincoding genes in the YJ016 genome, but only 3,915 genes
shared between them, there is clearly an enormous
amount of strain-specific sequence among these clade 2
strains. The frequency of hypothetical proteins in the
core genome was 20.3% compared with the overall frequency of 23.6% in the CMCP6 genome.
The total number of genes obtained by combining the
CMCP6 and YJ016 reference genomes and excluding
redundancy is 5,630. Among the 4,473 genes in the
CMCP6 genome, 309 (6.9%) were unique to this strain,
and among the 5,026 genes in the YJ016 genome, 489
(9.7%) were unique to this strain relative to all of the
other genomes. By combining the matches for each
strain with the reference genomes we identified the following numbers of genes for each strain: ATCC 33149 4,184; 99-738 DP-B5 - 4,359; 99-520 DP-B8 - 4,225; and
M06-24/O - 4,534.
Genomic inference of different V. vulnificus genotypes

We asked which genes were common only to the three
biotype 1/clade 2 strains, but not present in the two biotype 1/clade 1 strains or the biotype 2 strain, because
this could help identify the genes that are responsible
for the increased virulence of clade 2 strains (Thiaville,
P.C. et al., Infect. Immun., submitted). The 80 clade 2-

Gulig et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:512
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/512

specific genes are listed in Table 2. Among the notable
clade 2-specific genes and regions are several GGDEF
proteins (genes VV1_2061, VV1_2228, VV1_2321 in the
CMCP6 genome) and a Flp pilus-coding region (genes
VV1_2330 to VV1_2337 in the CMCP6 genome).
GGDEF proteins are involved with signal transduction
in many bacteria by regulating intracellular levels of the
signaling molecule cyclic-di-GMP [33], and Flp pili
could be involved with adherence or genetic exchange
[34]. Hypothetical proteins comprised 36.3% of the clade
2-specific genes, compared with the overall frequency of
23.6% of hypothetical proteins in the CMCP6 genome.
Because the reference strains are both clade 2, any clade
1-specific genes will be missed in this initial mapping.
Strain 99-520 DP-B8 is a typical clade 1 strain with
attenuated virulence, while strain 99-738 DP-B5 is a
clade 1 strain with high virulence typical of clade 2
strains. There were 61 genes in 99-738 DP-B5 that were
common to the three clade 2 strains but missing from
attenuated clade 1 strain 99-520 DP-B8 and biotype 2
strain ATCC 33149. (Table 3). This set of genes could
contain virulence genes acquired by 99-738 DP-B5 that
endow it with clade 2-like virulence. Hypothetical proteins comprised 19.7% of this set of genes, compared
with the overall frequency of 23.6% hypothetical proteins in the CMCP6 genome. It is noteworthy that the
clade 2 + 99-738 DP-B5 specific set of genes includes
genomic island XII identified by Cohen et al. [20] as
being present in most clade 2 strains and missing from
most clade 1 strains (genes VV2_1090 to VV2_1111 on
the CMCP6 genome). They hypothesized that genomic
island XII could be responsible for the putative differential virulence of clade 2 strains, evidenced by their association with clinical cases.
Within genomic island XII are paralogs of galactose
utilization genes (VV2_1095, a paralog of galE2 encoding UDP-glucose 4-epimerase and VV2_1094, a paralog
of galT2 encoding galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase) that are in an operon with a predicted sulfate
transporter (VV2_1096). The canonical galE (VV1_1770)
and galT (VV1_1771) are located elsewhere in the
galETKM operon (VV_1770 to VV1_1773). The presence of additional galET genes in a subset of V. vulnificus strains with high virulence suggests a role for these
genes in another metabolic pathway possibly benefitting
the bacteria during infection.
The link with sulfate metabolism was intriguing
because five other genomic island XII genes are annotated as arylsulfatase A (VV2_1106, VV2_1108,
VV2_1109, and VV2_0151) or alkyl sulfatase
(VV2_0989). These enzymes hydrolyze the sulfate from
sulfated gangliosides (sulfatides). VV2_1098 and
VV2_1110 in the genomic island encode chondroitinases
(although they are not annotated as such in the

Page 6 of 16

reference genome sites). Sulfatides are important components of connective tissue involved with cell adhesion
[35] and serve as the receptors for various microbial
pathogens ranging from HIV [36], Bordetella pertussis
[37], and Helicobacter pylori [38]. An arylsulfatase of E.
coli K1 is necessary for invasion of the blood-brain barrier [39]; hence, such activity in virulent V. vulnificus
strains could enable invasion through tissues, which is
characteristic of V. vulnificus infection. In clinical
V. vulnificus isolates, the presence of region XII, encoding arylsulfatases, chondroitinases, sulfate transport, and
sulfate metabolism functions, suggests that this region
may have an important scavenging function removing
sulfate groups from host components, thereby providing
sulfur and/or carbon sources, which could facilitate survival in the human host where free sulfur is limited.
However, as noted above, some of the degradative
enzymes in genomic island XII could also be involved in
invasion of tissues. Cohen et al. [20] had noted the presence of such genes in genomic island XII predominant
in the clade of V. vulnificus strains most associated with
clinical strains. The exclusive presence of all of these
genes in clade 2 plus the highly virulent clade 1 strain
99-738 DP-B5 suggests a role in virulence. The dissection of the roles in virulence, if any, played by these
genomic island XII genes identified through our comparative genomic analysis will await construction and
analysis of specific mutants. However, Bryant et al. [40]
described the use of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polymyxin
B-sucrose plates for the identification of V. vulnificus
from shellfish samples. The ability of bacteria to form
halos around colonies on this medium is indicative of
alkyl sulfatase activity. In contrast to our determination
that VV2_0989 is absent in the biotype 2 strain ATCC
33149 and clade 1 strain 99-520 DP-B8 and the results
of Cohen et al. [20] similarly describing the limited presence of genomic island 12 among V. vulnificus strains,
Bryant et al. observed that all 20 V. vulnificus strains
examined possessed alkyl sulfatase activity. However,
VV2_0885 and VV2_1032 are also annotated as alkyl
sulfatase. Our results show that VV2_0885 is present in
all six strains except 99-738 DP-B5 and VV2_1032 is
present in all six strains. Hence, it would be expected
that all V. vulnificus strains would exhibit alkyl sulfatase
activity, in agreement with Bryant et al. [40].
Also of note in the clade 2 plus 99-738 DP-B5-specific
genes not present in genomic island XII were linked genes
possibly involved with sialic acid catabolism: N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NanA, VV2_0730), a TRAP transport system possibly involved with sialic acid transport (VV2_0731
to VV2_0733), N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase (NanE, VV2_0734), N-acetylmannosamine kinase
(NanK, VV2_0735), and N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate
deacetylase (NagA, VV2_0736). Because the nagB gene

encode a neuraminidase (NanH) which would liberate
sialic acid from host components. Almagro-Moreno
and Boyd [41] had noted that sialic acid metabolism
was unique to bacteria that interacted with mammalian
hosts, either as pathogens or as commensals. Jeong et
al. [42] recently constructed a nanA deletion in V. vulnificus and confirmed that the ability to utilize exogenous sialic acid was essential for virulence in
intraperitoneally inoculated iron dextran-treated mice,

strain and did not perform comparative genetics
among strains of different genotypes or virulence phenotypes. The summation of these data regarding nanA
is that our comparative genomic sequencing correctly
identified unique virulence genes among different sets
of V. vulnificus.
Another carbon source utilization pathway specific to
the clade 2 plus 99-738 DP-B5 strains but not in genomic
island XII is a complete mannitol catabolic pathway
encoding the mannitol/fructose-specific phosphotransferase system IIA protein (mtlABC, VV1_0638), mannitol-1phosphate 5-dehydrogenase (mtlD, VV1_0639), and a
specific mannitol repressor (mtlR, VV1_0640). The significance of these genes to virulence is unknown. Interestingly, by examining 465 V. vulnificus strains, Drake et
al. [22] previously determined that the ability to ferment
mannitol by V. vulnificus was highly correlated with a
strain being in, what we are calling, clade 2. Tison et al.
[14] reported that biotype 2 strains were mannitolnegative. Our sequencing data, albeit on a considerably
smaller sample size of strains, therefore corroborate the
phenotypic analyses of these two previous studies.

polymorphisms. We used MAQ to identify SNPs present
in the newly sequenced genomes relative to the reference
genomes. The SNPs from each of the pairwise analyses
versus the reference genomes are listed in Additional Files
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, and the summary of the numbers of SNPs from each sequenced strain relative to the
reference genomes is shown in Table 4. In examining
SNPs, we did not exclude any sets of genes, such as putative mobile genetic elements, e.g., phages. It is interesting
that M06-24/O, which had the highest amount of coverage
relative to the reference genomes, had the lowest number
of SNPs (mean of 42,191 SNPs per reference genome)
compared with the other three strains (mean of 73,130
SNPs per reference genome). This likely reflects the fact
that M06-24/O is in the same clade as the reference
genomes.
The accuracy of the SOLiD-based SNPs in identifying
polymorphisms was verified by examining Sanger
sequencing of specific genomic regions of each of these
strains. Having examined 8.7 kb of Sanger-derived
sequence that contained SNPs identified from our
SOLiD sequencing, we determined that 126 of 128 SNPs
were accurately identified (98.4% accuracy).
We then examined the distribution of nonredundant
SNPs among different sets of annotated ORFs using the
CMCP6 reference genome. It must be emphasized that
the vast majority of annotated ORFs have not been
experimentally verified; hence, such an analysis is conjectural. Of the 201,981 nonredundant SNPs in the
CMCP6 genome from all four sequenced strains,
177,464 fell within annotated ORFs (87.9%). This was
not unexpected since this figure approximates the
amount of the genome contained within annotated
ORFs [30]. However, other interesting trends were evident. There were highly significant differences in the
frequencies of SNPs between chromosomes 1 and 2 of
CMCP6. Among the annotated ORFs, there were 0.037
SNPs/base for chromosome 1 and 0.044 SNPs/base in
chromosome 2. Among the other sets of ORFs, there
were significantly more SNPs/base in the core genome
(0.043 SNPs/base) than in the total ORFs (0.040 SNPs/
base) (Figure 2). As opposed to the inference that the
core genome is actually more variable among strains,
this difference most likely is due to the fact that the
core genome, by definition, was shared among all of the
sequenced strains; hence, had more shared sequences in
which SNPs could be identified. In contrast, the lowest
rate of SNPs was among the clade 2-specific genes, with
only 0.019 SNPs/base. In the opposite manner to the
core genome, this result would be expected since
the clade 2-specific genes are unique and shared among
the set of three genetically related clade 2 strains and
because only one newly sequenced clade 2 strain, M06-

Page 9 of 16

24/O, contributed to this particular SNP pool. The frequency of SNPs in the clade 2 + 99-738 DP-B5 set of
ORFs was 0.033 SNPs/base. The frequency of SNPs
among hypothetical proteins (0.037 SNPs/base) was significantly lower than that of the total ORFs.
Lineage-specific Expansions

Gu et al. [43]. recently reported an analysis of numerous
Vibrio spp. to identify lineage-specific expansions (LSEs),
genes that have been duplicated within a species or genotype. Some LSEs are specific to single strain, while others
are present among varied strains across species. We
examined some of the LSEs present in the reference genomes of V. vulnificus to determine if these loci are similarly present in the newly sequenced V. vulnificus
genomes. We did not find a pattern to the presence or
absence of the LSEs examined. For example, VV1_3196
and VV2_0703 form a pair of LSE genes in CMCP6.
Neither of these genes has a homologue in YJ016 or any
of the newly sequenced V. vulnificus genomes. In contrast, VV1_2851 and VV2_0347 constitute a pair of LSEs
in CMCP6 that have homologues in YJ106 (VV1419 and
VVA0904). The VV1_2851/VV1419 pair of genes has
homologues in all of the four newly sequenced genomes,
while VV2_0347 and VVA0904 do not.

Discussion
This study is one of the first to use Applied Biosystems
SOLiD sequencing for genomic sequencing of bacteria.
Whole genome analysis has progressed considerably
since the publication of the first complete DNA sequence
of the pathogenic bacterium Haemophilus influenzae
[44]. Until recently, the wealth of complete genomes
available in public databases was decoded via the largescale industrialization of the Sanger dideoxy chain-termination sequencing method [45,46]. The prospect of
quickly and inexpensively resequencing large segments of
the human genome or whole genomes of populations or
species is driving development of a new generation of
sequencing technologies with impacts in microbiology,
functional genomics, ecology and evolutionary biology,
human health, and beyond [45,47-51]. In particular, bacterial sequencing has been advanced by the high throughput, parallel format of the 454 Sequencer [51], the first
‘next-generation’ technology to de novo sequence and
assemble whole bacterial genomes including Mycoplasma
genitalium in a single machine run [52]. Bacterial comparative genomics has expanded rapidly owing to the
speed of the 454 Sequencer compared to Sanger sequencing [53] as well as from a combination of the two technologies [54], while assessment of microbial diversity
from complex communities (metagenomics) [55]
has revealed insights into complex interactions such as

mammalian obesity and the microbiome [56,57], the
ocean biosphere [58], and the role of microbes in colony
collapse disorder in honeybees [59].
More recently released ‘second-generation’ sequencing
technologies such the Illumina GA2X Genome Analyzer
(GA) and ABI SOLiD system have been developed [51].
To date, these next generation sequencing technologies
generate shorter read lengths than Sanger sequencing,
which poses a difficulty for de novo sequence assembly
and defining large chromosomal rearrangements [49,51].
So far in prokaryotes, high quality draft sequences have
been assembled in the absence of Sanger sequencing by
combing the 454 and GA technologies [60-64]. Studholme et al. [65] utilized the Illumina platform alone for
the de novo assembly of the draft genome sequence of
Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tabaci strain 11528,
revealing insights into the nature of type III proteinmediated pathogenicity.
The improved throughput from the massively parallel
format of the new platforms (billions of bases in a single
run) is ideal for revealing patterns of genetic variation
among individuals by resequencing. For example, Srivatsan et al. [66] employed Illumina sequencing to improve
the existing draft of the extensively studied model bacterium Bacillus subtilis, while also identifying polymorphisms between other well studied laboratory
strains and their isolates. Moreover, this method was
sensitive enough to identify typically difficult to isolate
suppressor mutations in a single strain [66]. Using the
same platform, whole-genome analysis of 12 isolates of
the monomorphic human pathogen Salmonella enterica
serovar Typhi revealed evolutionary loss of gene function consistent with the effects of genetic drift on a
small effective population size [67]. Resequencing of the
Caernohabditis elegans N2 Bristol strain and SNP discovery in another strain demonstrated the effectiveness
of this technology in eukaryotes [68], and single base
mutations in a mutant C. elegans strain were mapped,
avoiding traditional genetic mapping efforts [69].
As one of the newer second-generation sequencers
currently available, (although ‘third-generation’ single
molecule sequencers are set to be marketed in 2010),
the ABI SOLiD platform has been used more with
eukaryotes than prokaryotes. One of the first studies

focused on assessing cross-platform performance for
sequence detection of known mutations in C. elegans.
Comparable accuracy between GA and SOLiD for mapping the same C. elegans mutant strain as Sarin et al.
[69] was reported [70]. Similarly, comparable accuracy
was reported between 454, GA, and SOLiD methods for
comparing a mutant strain of yeast to a reference genome [71]. At present the utility of the SOLiD platform
is reflected in several resequencing studies in humans,
including haplotype analysis, breakpoint mapping in disease-associated chromosomal rearrangements, and polymorphism discovery in protein coding exons [72-74].
With bacteria, SOLiD sequencing has been limited to
verifying an E. coli reference strain sequence in conjunction with traditional sequencing [75], as well as resequencing of Bacillus anthracis strains for rapid and
accurate forensic typing [76]. In our presently described
study, the SOLiD platform was successfully utilized for
rapid comparative genomic analysis of clade-specific and
core genome sequences of the opportunistic pathogen
V. vulnificus.
By examining the genomic DNA of each of four
V. vulnificus strains on one-fourth of a SOLiD slide, we
obtained 3.16 × 107 to 3.50 × 107 35-nt reads. This level
of sequencing yielded approximately 100-fold coverage
of each genome. Although the total numbers of reads
would have predicted over 200-fold coverage, there was
a significant amount of low complexity reads, as well as
reads that were unmappable to the reference genomes.
We identified sequences that are unique to the highly
virulent clade 2 strains. These 80 genes represent the
set that could contain virulence genes that are responsible for the ability of clade 2 strains to cause systemic
infection and death in subcutaneously inoculated iron
dextran-treated mice (Thiaville, P.C., et al., Infect.
Immun. submitted). Furthermore, we identified 61 additional genes that are common to the clade 2 strains and
an unusual highly virulent clade 1 strain but absent
from a typical attenuated clade 1 strain and a biotype 2
eel isolate. These 61 genes represent a very interesting
set that could contain generally clade 2-specific genes
that were acquired by a clade 1 strain and increased its
virulence to that of typical clade 2 strains. Among these
putative virulence genes were genomic island XII

identified by Cohen et al. [20], and most interesting was
a set of genes involved with sialic acid catabolism. Jeong
et al. [42] recently determined that the ability to utilize
sialic acid for metabolism was essential for virulence of
V. vulnificus. We are currently examining the possible
roles of several of these loci in virulence.
At the time of our performing this genomic sequence
analysis, we had not performed virulence studies of biotype 2 ATCC 33149 in our subcutaneously inoculated
iron dextran-treated mouse model for infection. However, Amaro et al. [77] previously reported that ATCC
33149 was of modest virulence in a different mouse
model involving intraperitoneal infection. Based on our
results indicating that ATCC 33149 lacked the genes
shared among virulent clade 2 strains or clade 2 strains
plus virulent clade 1 99-738 DP-B5, we hypothesized
that ATCC 33149 would be attenuated for virulence in
our model. In fact, when administered at the standard
lethal dose of 1,000 CFU for virulent strains, ATCC
33149 caused only minimally detectable skin infection in
one of five mice. Furthermore, when administered at
100 times the typical lethal dose (105 CFU/mouse), skin
infection but no systemic infection or death ensued.
Therefore, our genomic analysis of ATCC 33149 correctly

predicted its attenuated virulence. It should be noted that
Amaro and Biosca [78] reported that some biotype 2
strains are virulent for mammals, so the attenuation of
ATCC 33149 was not a foregone conclusion.
Because phenotypic differences are not only rooted in
presence or absence of whole genes, but also nucleotide
polymorphisms, we generated a set of SNPs among the
shared sequences of the reference and newly sequenced
genomes (Table 4 and Additional Files 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, and 13). By examining Sanger-derived sequences for
a subset of SNPs, we determined that 98.4% of our
reported SNPs are accurate. Of the 128 SNPs examined,
only two in one gene of one strain were not confirmed
by Sanger sequencing.
Although the sample size of newly sequenced strains
was small and each strain is a single representative of a
unique genotype/virulence phenotype combination,
some interesting relationships in SNPs were observed.
Most interesting, the rate of SNPs was significantly
higher for genes encoded on chromosome 2 compared
with chromosome 1. Given that chromosome 1 of
Vibrio is believed to encode most of the essential genes
and that chromosome 2 is believed to have been
acquired exogenously [79], it is reasonable that the

Gulig et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:512
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/512

highest rate of polymorphisms would occur in the chromosome 2. The number of SNPs between M06-24/O
and the reference genomes was much lower than those
from the other three genomes (Table 4), even though
there were slightly more genes identified in M06-24/O.
Because M06-24/O is in the same clade as the reference
genomes, this result would be expected. Significant differences were observed in the frequencies of SNPs
among about every subset of genes examined, e.g., clade
2-specific, core genome, hypothetical proteins (Figure 2).
However, it must be noted that the numbers of strains
contributing to the SNP pool for these subsets of genes
differ between the sets. For example, the core genome is
shared among all six strains, so all four newly sequenced
strains contributed SNPs and could have generated
a higher frequency of SNPs. In contrast, for the
clade 2-specific genes, the only newly sequenced strain
contributing SNPs, by definition of the subset, was
M06-24/O.
By comparing the sequences shared among all six genomes, we identified the core V. vulnificus genome consisting of 3,459 genes. Gu et al. [43] examined the
genomic sequences of all Vibrio species as of 2008 and
identified 1,882 genes common to the genus. We are presently examining the core V. vulnificus genome to deduce
possible metabolic and virulence characteristics of the
species. We identified 20 genes previously unreported in
V. vulnificus by using MAQ to compare the unmapped
reads to the V. cholerae N16961 genome. If the clade 1
or biotype 2 genomes possessed sequences with sufficient
similarity to the V. cholerae genome, we should have
been able to identify and assemble them exactly as we
did for the V. vulnificus reference genomes.
Most recently, Chun et al. [80] examined the genomes
of 23 V. cholerae strains collected over 98 years. Their
newly sequences genomes were obtained using a combination of Sanger and 454 sequencing. Like us, they
based their phylogenetic relationships primarily on presence or absence of ORFs. Their analysis enabled the
division of that species into 12 lineages, with one comprising the O1 strains and the seventh pandemic comprising a nearly identical clade. They determined that
horizontal gene transfer significantly contributed to the
evolution of the species.

Conclusions
SOLiD sequencing of multiple bacterial genomes of
V. vulnificus and subsequent comparative genomic analysis identified numerous genes that are common to the
most virulent strains yet lacking from attenuated strains
for which genomic DNA sequence data are available.
These candidate virulence genes encode Flp pili, GGDEF
proteins, and genomic island XII. Sialic acid catabolism
was similarly identified as a potential contributory factor

in molecular pathogenesis. These intriguing results will
likely lead to more thorough understanding of molecular
pathogenesis of V. vulnificus.

Methods
V. vulnificus strains

Each of the four V. vulnificus strains used for genomic
sequencing was chosen to represent a specific combination of genotype and virulence phenotype. M06-24/O is
a typical biotype 1, clade 2 strain that is highly virulent
in our subcutaneously inoculated, iron dextran-treated
mouse model. 99-520 DP-B8 is a typical biotype 1, clade
1 strain that is attenuated in our mouse model in that it
can cause skin infection, but not systemic infection or
death. 99-738 DP-B5 is an unusual biotype 1, clade 1
strain in that it is fully virulent in our mouse model.
ATCC 33149 is a biotype 2 strain that is highly attenuated for virulence in our mouse model. These data are
summarized in Table 1.
SOLiD DNA sequencing

Sequencing runs were done using cycled ligation sequencing on a SOLiD™ Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Beverly,
MA) at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology
Research at the University of Florida. Approximately 3 to
5 μg of purified bacterial genomic DNA was sheared into
80 to 100-bp short fragments with the Covaris™ S2 system
according to the AB protocol. The sheared DNA was purified using a Qiagen MiniElute® reaction cleanup kit. The
purified sheared fragments were made blunt-ended with
the Epicenter® End-It™ DNA end-repair kit and subsequently ligated to short SOLiD P1 and P2 adapters (P1,
41-bp: 5’-CCACTACGCCTCCGCTTTCCTCTCTATGGGCAGTCGGTGAT-3’; P2, 23-bp: 5’-AGAGAATGAGGAACCCGGGGCAG-3’), which provide the primary
sequences for both amplification and sequencing of the
sample library fragments. Adapter-ligated DNA was then
purified using the Agencourt kit. The reaction conditions
were optimized to selectively bind DNA 100-bp and larger.
At this point, DNA was nick-translated and resolved on
4% agarose gel, from which the 120 to 180-bp fragments
were excised. The fractionated DNA was subjected to 8 to
10 cycles of PCR amplification. The number of PCR cycles
needed for amplification was determined by the ability to
visualize the amplified product on a 2.2% Lonza flash gel.
The amplified PCR products were purified and then quantified using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer.
In preparation for sequencing, the DNA fragments
were clonally amplified by emulsion PCR by using 1.6
billion, 1 μM beads with P1 primer covalently attached
to the surface. Emulsions were broken with butanol, and
ePCR beads were enriched for template-positive beads
by hybridization with P2-coated capture beads (SOLiD
reagent, Applied Biosystems). Template-enriched beads

Gulig et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:512
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/512

were extended at the 3’ end in the presence of terminal
transferase and 3’ bead linker. About 60 million beads
with clonally amplified DNA were then deposited onto
one-fourth of a derivatized glass surface of a 25 mm ×
75 mm SOLiD™ slide. The slide was then loaded onto a
SOLiD instrument, and the 35-base sequences were
obtained according to manufacturer’s protocol.
DNA sequence data management

The colorspace reads from SOLiD sequencing were
aligned to the genomes of V. vulnificus strains CMCP6
(GenBank accession numbers AE016795 and AE016796)
and YJ016 (GenBank accession numbers BA000037,
BA000037, AP005352) using MAQ [27]. Reads from
each of the four sample strains were mapped to the two
reference sequences separately. Reads unmapped in both
reference genomes were identified. Mapped reads were
used to develop a consensus sequence for each of the
four strains. For each strain relative to the two reference
sequences, a gene was determined to be absent when
the average depth of coverage over the open reading
frame was less than 5X. Consensus sequences were also
used to generate a list of SNPs among the six strains of
V. vulnificus using the MAQ cns2snp [27].
Reads with low-complexity characteristics, defined as
containing a homopolymer run of at least 5 bases, at
least four repeats of the same dinucleotide in a row, or
at least four repeats of the same trinucleotide in a row,
were removed from the data set before further analysis.
While these reads may represent true genomic regions,
the difficulty in assigning them to a particular genomic
region limits their value. This is an inherent problem
with low complexity genomes and short read data.
Reads unmapped in both reference sequences were then
compared to the V. cholerae NC16961 reference genome
using MAQ [27]. Windows of 100 nucleotides in the
V. cholerae genome with a read depth of five or more
were identified. Regions where five or more windows
occurred in tandem were retained, while those with coverage less than five were discarded. Reads that initially
mapped to a lower density area of the V. cholerae
genome were re-examined for possible matches to the
tandem windows.
In parallel to the V. cholerae exploration, the unmapped
reads were examined for similarity to V. vulnificus biotype
2 plasmids pR99 (accession # AM293858), pC4602-1
(accession # AM293859), and pC4602-2 (accession #
AM293860) using MAQ and the same criteria as above.
Bioinformatic alnalysis

Functional analysis and annotations analysis of the
V. vulnificus YJ016 and CMCP6 genes were done using
the Pathway Tool Omics viewer from the BioCyc platform [81] and the SEED database [82].
