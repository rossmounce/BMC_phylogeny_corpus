Abstract
Background: The Recombination Activating Proteins, RAG1 and RAG2, play a crucial role in the immune
response in vertebrates. Among the nuclear markers currently used for phylogenetic purposes, Rag1 has
especially enjoyed enormous popularity, since it successfully contributed to elucidating the relationships
among and within a large variety of vertebrate lineages. We here report on a comparative investigation of
the genetic variation, base composition, presence of indels, and selection in Rag1 in different vertebrate
lineages (Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Aves, Chondrichthyes, Crocodylia, Lepidosauria, Mammalia, and
Testudines) through the analysis of 582 sequences obtained from Genbank. We also analyze possible
differences between distinct parts of the gene with different type of protein functions.
Results: In the vertebrate lineages studied, Rag1 is over 3 kb long. We observed a high level of
heterogeneity in base composition at the 3rd codon position in some of the studied vertebrate lineages and
in some specific taxa. This result is also paralleled by taxonomic differences in the GC content at the same
codon position. Moreover, positive selection occurs at some sites in Aves, Lepidosauria and Testudines.
Indels, which are often used as phylogenetic characters, are more informative across vertebrates in the 5'
than in the 3'-end of the gene. When the entire gene is considered, the use of indels as phylogenetic
character only recovers one major vertebrate clade, the Actinopterygii. However, in numerous cases
insertions or deletions are specific to a monophyletic group.
Conclusions: Rag1 is a phylogenetic marker of undoubted quality. Our study points to the need of
carrying out a preliminary investigation on the base composition and the possible existence of sites under
selection of this gene within the groups studied to avoid misleading resolution. The gene shows highly
heterogeneous base composition, which affects some taxa in particular and contains sites under positive
selection in some vertebrate lineages in the 5'-end. The first part of the gene (5'-end) is more variable than
the second (3'-end), and less affected by a heterogeneous base composition. However, in some vertebrate
lineages the 5'-end of the gene is not yet widely used for phylogenetic studies.

Background
The majority of recent phylogenetic studies of vertebrates
have relied on genetic data of both mitochondrial and
nuclear origins (reviewed in [1]). Often, nuclear genes are
considered to be superior to mitochondrial ones, especially to resolve deep divergences (e.g., [2]). Furthermore,
the use of a single gene, especially if mitochondrial, for
phylogenetic reconstructions may not reflect the "true
tree" due to a number of reasons, including past hybridization, gene duplication, and/or incomplete lineage sorting. Only a few studies have sought to understand why
some nuclear genes are better suited for phylogenetic
reconstruction than others ([2,3], but see also [4,5]).
Some of the factors that negatively influence the utility of
a gene to recover the correct phylogeny include: a heterogeneous base composition [6,7], codon position saturation (reviewed in [1]), and transition/transversion rate
bias.
In recent years, DNA sequences of Rag1 have been used
for phylogenetic inference at various taxonomic levels
(e.g., [8-11]). Several studies have focused on specific vertebrate groups (e.g., birds, turtles, sharks and amphibians
[8,12-14], but see also [10]) and have highlighted the
characteristics of this gene in relation to its phylogenetic
utility. Some of these potentially useful characteristics of
Rag1 include its existence as a single copy gene (except in
polyploidy taxa such as Xenopus, [15]), uninterrupted
exon (except in ray-finned fish where it has one or two
introns [16]), the conserved nature of certain regions of
the gene, especially its second half (3' end), which facilitates the design of degenerate "universal" primers for PCR,
the presence of numerous sequences from a variety of taxa
in public databases, and an overall lack of saturation [10].

The protein products of the two lymphocyte-specific
recombination activating genes, Rag1 and Rag2, play an
essential role in the host's active immune response to the
different pathogens (see [17] and references therein for
specific different activity of each protein in the immunological response), starting the process that generates specific receptors on B and T lymphocytes. The immune
system is able to target and destroy many different foreign
invaders as a result of the vast number of these specific
receptors. The specificity of these receptors is made possible by a process known as V(D)J joining. This mechanism
occurs in vertebrates and relies on the shuffling and
recombination of different pre-existing gene fragments (V
(variable), J (joining) and in some case D (diversity))
[17]. The first step of this set of reactions is the recognition
and cleavage of a well conserved Recombination Signal
Sequence (RSS), consisting of seven or nine nucleotide
sequences separated from each other by a spacer of 12 or
23 bp [18]. The Rag1 coding sequence contains a conserved protein structural domain that binds the RSS [19].
The active site for the RSS binding and DNA cleavage is
contained in part of the so-called the "core RAG1
domain", which also contains the nonamer-binding
region (NBR, Figure 1) and three active residues. The
recombination process requires that the RAG1 and RAG2
proteins act together as a heterodimer to recognize the RSS
(reviewed in [20]) and introduce a break between the RSS
and the adjacent V(D)J coding segments [21]. Almost the
entire length of RAG1 is involved in codifying for different
protein functions (e.g., sites involving in binding RAG2,
sites involving in binding the RSS, Figure 1 and [17,22] for
additional information on RAG1 structure).
In this study, we focus our attention on the comparative
analysis of the variation in the coding region of Rag1

within and among major vertebrate clades (Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Aves, Chondrichthyes, Crocodylia, Lepidosauria, Mammalia, Testudines). A few studies on much
smaller datasets highlighted possible characteristics of
this marker that could affect phylogenetic reconstruction,
such as base compositional bias (e.g., [10,23]). The large
dataset used in the present work allows us to further study
the extent of the base compositional bias across vertebrates as well as other factors that could influence phylogenetic reconstructions. Such a large dataset across
vertebrates also allows us to look at the occurrence of
indels across vertebrates and to evaluate their utility as
phylogenetic characters. Additionally, we also comparatively analyze different parts of the gene, with potential
different levels of constraints. We aligned a total of 582
vertebrate sequences yielding an alignment that spans
over 3.5 Kb to specifically look at the variability, base
composition, selection and utility of indels as phylogenetic characters of Rag1.

Methods
Datasets
A set of Rag1 sequences for each vertebrate clade was
downloaded from GenBank in 2008. Most of the downloaded sequences had been used in the framework of published phylogenetic studies. Due to computational
limitations, different datasets were used in a few cases. For
genetic distances and base compositional analyses, a dataset of 582 vertebrate sequences was used. For the analysis
of selection a dataset including a maximum of 60
sequences for vertebrate group was used, while for the
analysis of the utility of indels as phylogenetic characters
two distinct datasets, one of 1569 and one of 572
sequences, respectively have been used. Each dataset has
been built according to the following strategies. Initial
clade-wise amino acid alignments of all the downloaded
sequences were made manually using MEGA 4.0 [24]
using the amino acid sequences. These sub-alignments
(312 sequences of Actinopterygii, 181 of Amphibia, 539
of Aves, 30 of Chondrichthyes, 19 of Crocodylia, 150 of

Lepidosauria, 313 of Mammalia, and 25 of Testudines),
were used only for a more detailed within-clade examination of indels. Of these 1569 downloaded sequences, a
subset dataset including 582 vertebrate sequences of Rag1
[see Additional file 1] was constructed based on the following characteristics: a) we included one sequence per
species. Non-overlapping sequences from the same species were combined to obtain one single sequence. For
overlapping sequences of the same species, the longest
one was kept, whereas for sequences of the same species
of the same length randomly one of the sequences was
chosen. b) Sequences shorter than 1000 bp, on the base of
each separate within-clade alignment, were removed as
well as sequences above this size but not overlapping for
a large part (at least 1000 bp) of the gene; in our dataset
all the sequences within each vertebrate group span a
common fragment of at least 1000 bp. Since numerous
studies based on Rag1 often used only fragments of the
gene, not all the downloaded sequences spanned overlapping regions of the gene and fragments of different lengths
were thus included in our dataset (Table 1). c) The
remaining sequences were collapsed, to see if identical
sequences where present in the dataset, into one single
unique nucleotide sequence using the software DNAcollapser v1.0 [25]. d) When possible, we selected a similar
number of sequences for each of the major vertebrates
groups (110 Actinopterygii, 113 Amphibia, 119 Aves, 84
Lepidosauria, and 89 Mammalia; see Table 1 for the
number of sequences of the other groups). To obtain
these, we randomly removed sequences using the random
number generator as available in Microsoft Excel (version
2003), but making sure that a phylogenetic spread was
maintained. We then manually refined the alignment of
each clade in MEGA using the amino acid sequences, taking amino acid properties into consideration for optimal
alignment. Finally, the complete Rag1 sequences [see
Additional file 1] were used to check and manually correct
the alignment of all vertebrates (alignments available
from the authors on request, vertebrate alignment available as additional file, see below indel analysis). Indels

total vertebrate alignment). "Complete" indicates sequences included in the alignment for which the coding region of Rag1 has been entirely
sequenced (bold numbers, [see Additional file 1]). "2000 bp < N<total length" indicates the number of sequences of more than 2000 base pairs, but
not full length. "1000 bp < N<2000 bp" indicates the number of sequences between 1000 and 2000 base pairs long.

were added as indicated in the paragraph on the indel
analysis (see below).

gene and their beginning and ending points. Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes were included in the gene comparison analysis only for the 3'-end, as only two and one
of the available sequences, respectively, span the 5'-end of
the gene. We furthermore separately analyzed two functional regions of the gene (a zinc binding and DNA binding domains) contained in the 5'-end of Rag1, to see if
specific functional regions strongly depart from the general characteristics of the gene.

The amino- and carboxy-terminals of the gene were also
studied separately. To define the sites and regions of the
gene with different functional constraint, we used the
online site uniprot.org [26]. We divided the gene into two
parts of almost equal length (Figure 1) to allow comparable analysis in terms of bp included in the two gene
regions. A division of the gene into "core" and "non-core"
regions (Figure 1) would have produced a 3'-end being
nearly twice as big as the 5'-end (1152 bp versus 1968 bp).
Thus, the sequences included in the 582 sequences dataset
were split into a 5'-end part (amino acid 1-444 in Mus
musculus) including a zinc finger, a DNA binding domain
and NBR (RSS binding region) regions and a 3'-end part
(amino acid 445-1040 in Mus musculus), which contains
the major part of the core region (Figure 1). This partitioning corresponds also to current practice in phylogenetic
studies, where for some vertebrate groups (Actinopterygii,
Amphibia, Chondrichthyes, and Mammalia) the commonly used fragment only spans the second half of the
gene (generally after amino acid 500). Thus, the division
into two separate domains in our study reflects the need
of having two similarly long fragments to compare, of
which one covers as much as possible the "core-region" of
the gene and the other the "non-core" region, and also
represents the "most common" gene fragment used for
phylogenetic studies in some vertebrate groups. Not every
sequence of the 582 dataset spanned both parts of Rag1,
thus Table 2 indicates the actual number of sequences
used for the comparative analysis on the two parts of the

Genetic distances, and base composition analyses
We computed within each vertebrate lineage the TamuraNei distances ([27], to account for different base frequencies) for the entire gene, for each part of it (5' and 3'-ends)
and for each codon position, using the option of pairwise
deletions for missing sites in MEGA 4.0. We used the same
software to calculate the amino acid distances (as uncorrected p-distance), the number of variable sites for the
nucleotide and amino acid sequences for each vertebrate
lineage for the analyzed fragment as well as for the two
parts of it.

Base composition for each codon position was calculated
in MEGA 4.0. We calculated base composition skew for AT
and GC according to the formulas: AT skew = [(A-T)/
(A+T)] and GC skew = [(G-C)/(G+C)]. The same software
was also used to study the departure from base compositional stationarity for each vertebrate lineage using the
Disparity Index test (ID-test). Kumar & Gadagkar [28]
highlighted how this test is more powerful than the Chisquare in detecting departure from a homogeneous base
composition. The disparity index (ID) corresponds to the

indicated (based on the same alignment as in Table 1). "Bp" indicates the total number of base pairs or the base pairs range for the analyzed
fragment after the within group alignment. "Complete fragment" indicates sequences included in the alignment for which the entire part of the gene
as indicated under "Bp" was available. "1000 bp < N<complete fragment" indicates the number of sequences of more than 1000 base pairs, but not
covering the full length of the fragment. Note that for Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes only the 3'-end of the gene is indicated. 3' and 5' indicate
the 3' and 5'-ends of the gene, respectively. See Methods for any additional information on the gene divisions and data available for each gene

observed compositional difference between two
sequences compared to the compositional difference that
would be expected under homogeneity. ID equals 0 when
the homogeneity assumption is satisfied. The significance
of a given ID value is then assessed using a Monte Carlo
approach.
Statistical analyses
Comparisons on the within group nucleotide and amino
acid distances, and on the within group variable nucleotide and amino acid sites between different parts of the
gene (5' and 3'-ends and of the two functional regions)
were made using a Welch's t-test (test for unequal variance, unequal sample size and independent samples; test
run in the R environment, [29]). To avoid any bias associated with the presence of different numbers of sequences
in one part of the gene versus the other, we used for this
analysis only sequences that spanned both sides of the
two gene parts for at least 1000 bp on each side. Discriminant analysis of base composition was run in R on the
dataset containing 582 sequences, using each vertebrate
lineage as discriminant factor.
Analysis of selection
Due to computational limitations, we used a subset of the
original 582 sequences dataset for the analyses of selection. This subset contained a maximum of 60 sequences
for each vertebrate lineage. To build this dataset we first
randomly removed different species belonging to the
same genus included in the dataset, and continued by randomly removing sequences if necessary to reach the maximum number of 60 sequences. Tests for positive
selection were conducted using PAML 4.1 ([30], codeml
option) to estimate the synonymous (dS: silent changes)
and nonsynonymous (dN: amino acid replacement
changes) substitution rates and detect instances of positive selection. The dN/dS ratio is a measure of the selection
acting on the protein. Positive selection is detected when
the ratio is >1, indicating a functional benefit to diversify
the amino acid sequence. A neutral model (M1a) was
compared to a selection model (M2a) and a likelihood
ratio test (LRT) was used to determine if positive selection
could be rejected. The LRT is performed by taking twice
the log-likelihood difference between the models (M2a
and M1a) and comparing this to the distribution with
degrees of freedom equal to two, as indicated in [31].
Because this method relies on a gene tree, for each vertebrate lineage a NJ tree was created using MEGA 4.0 (trees
not shown).
Analysis of indels
In numerous cases, indels had to be added to correctly
align the amino acid sequences. A "correct alignment" was
defined as the most parsimonious one, in which indels are
added to maintain amino acid blocks in the indel-flank-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/32

ing regions. Due to difficulties in aligning the sequences
of all vertebrates, for the analysis of indels on the 582
sequences dataset, the first 315 bp (105 amino acids) of
the complete vertebrate alignment were removed from the
alignment [see Additional file 2]. We also used the full
dataset of 1569 sequences and the entire length available
for the different vertebrate groups, to study the exclusivity
of these indels within each vertebrate group. Furthermore,
to study how phylogenetically informative these indels
are within and among the different vertebrate lineages, we
coded them to infer a Maximum Parsimony (MP) tree,
using PAUP* [32]. The analysis was based on a presenceabsence matrix using the amino acid alignment of the 582
sequence dataset without the first 105 amino acids (see
above) and codifying indels as 1 and any amino acid as 0.
Within some groups (eg., Actinopterygii, Amphibia and
Chondrichthyes) only a few sequences span almost the
entire length of the gene (Table 1). To avoid misleading
results due to the longer fragment represented by these
sequences, we removed them from the original dataset
(one sequence of Chondrichthyes, two of Actinopterygii
and seven of Amphibia). Thus, the total number of
sequences used was 572.

Results
Comparison across vertebrates
Table 1 shows the distribution in terms of length of the
sequences used for each vertebrate lineage. Table 2 shows
the same distribution for each part of the gene studied
separately. Nucleotide substitution varies across sites,
with the 3rd codon position being more variable than the
other two [see Additional file 3]. The pattern of variation
in terms of genetic distances is, as expected, 3rd>1st>2nd.

Table 3 shows, for each group, the number of variable
sites in Rag1, indicating that Amphibia, and Lepidosauria
have the highest percentage of variable nucleotide sites
across the entire gene and at each codon position.
Amphibia and Lepidosauria also have the highest percentage of variable amino acid sites. The higher variability
observed in Aves, Lepidosauria, and Mammalia at the
third codon position, compared to taxa of older origin
like Actinopterygii, is probably caused by differences in
number of sequences spanning also the 5'-end of the gene
(37 or more sequences compared to zero, Table 2)
included in the analysis (see below for variability of 5' and
3'-ends of the gene). In fact, when considering the 3'-end
of the gene, nucleotide and amino acid variability in
Actinopterygii is higher or comparable to the above mentioned groups (Table 3).
Table 4 shows the results of the analysis of base composition for each vertebrate lineage. In Rag1, the hypothesis of
homogeneous base frequencies is rejected at the 3rd codon
position (p < 0.05) for more than half of the pairwise

The variability in nucleotides and amino acids is presented in percentages (rounded to the higher integer) for the 582 sequences dataset. "N"
indicates the number of sequences included. "Bp" indicates the total number of base pairs or the base pairs range for the analyzed fragment after the
within group alignment. "N aa" indicates the number of amino acids in the analyzed fragment after the within group alignment. Note that for
Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes only the 3'-end of the gene is indicated. "F", "5"' and "3"' indicate the full gene and the 5' and 3'-ends of the gene,
respectively. See Methods for any additional information on the gene divisions and data available for each gene division.

comparisons within several vertebrate lineages (Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Lepidosauria and Mammalia, Table 4).
Moreover, lineages that do not show an overall high
departure from homogeneous base composition (Aves,
Chondrichthyes and Testudines, but not Crocodylia), still
have species showing an especially strong heterogeneous
base composition compared to the rest of the within lineage dataset (e.g., in Aves Schiffornis turdinus, Sitta pygmaea
and Sitta carolinensis, data not shown). An analysis of base
compositional skew reveals a general high level of A versus T, and G versus C (adenine versus thymine and guanine versus cytosine) at the 1st codon position, a general
skew versus A and C at the 2nd codon position and no general trend at the 3rd codon position [see Additional file 4].
Base composition for the gene does not reflect a general
trend (all values are rounded up, T = 24%, C = 22%, A =
29%, G = 25%). CG frequency is highly variable at the 3rd
codon position in Amphibia (Figure 2), even if the mean

values for the gene are very similar across the vertebrate
lineages [see Additional file 4]. The lineages for which GC
frequency does not show high variation still have some
sequences with high departure from the common variation range (indicated by the whiskers, Figure 2). This is
especially true for Chondrichthyes and Aves. Furthermore, in a discriminant analysis on the total base composition Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes distinguish well
from the remaining vertebrate groups along the first and
second discriminant axes, respectively (Figure 3).
Table 5 shows the results of the selection test run on the
different vertebrate groups. The dN/dS ratio was always
lower than one, supporting the neutral selection scenario
along the entire gene. However, the results of the chisquare test do not reject positive selection acting at some
sites in Aves and Lepidosauria (Table 5). Moreover, we
found positively selected sites in Aves, Lepidosauria and

occur in a region with functional activity (the interaction
with importin alpha-1).

Analysis of indels across vertebrates
Figure 4 shows a strict consensus MP cladogram based on
the indels (homoplasy index: 0.607143; tree length 280).
Although indels confer some information to identify
higher taxa, only Actinopterygii could be resolved as a
monophyletic group. All lepidosaurs are united into one
clade, with the exception of single sequences of the worm
lizards Blanus, Bipes, the lizard Dibamus and the snake
Loxocemus. These four sequences are not recovered in a
clade with the remaining Lepidosauria probably due to
their short sequence length, lacking up to 478 amino acid
positions in the 5'-end of the gene relative to the rest of
the alignment. The lizard Lanthanotus was placed outside
the main Lepidosauria clade based on a single indel at
position 370 of the amino acid alignment.

Within each major vertebrate group, insertions and deletions often seem to be characteristic of a subset of genera,
indicating possible monophyletic subgroups. In Actinopterygii, an amino acid deletion (amino acid position 612
in the alignment, [see Additional file 2]) occurs in two of
the four families (Tetraodontidae and Diodontidae) of
the suborder Tetraodontoidei (as already reported in
[33]). In Amphibia, representatives of a derived clade in
the superfamily Hyloidea [34,35] have an amino acid
insertion (in position 606 of the alignment, [see Additional file 2]) as already reported by [36], which is lacking
in basal hyloids such as Caudiverbera, Lechriodus, Limnodynastes, and Myobatrachus, and in all the other amphibian
species included in our dataset. This insertion occurs in a
variable region (see Discussion relative to Figure 5 of this
manuscript) and also occurs in Chondrichthyes, probably
convergently. All Aves, except some genera of chicken and
duck-like birds and paleognaths (Aburria, Anas, Anhima,
Chamaepetes, Chauna, Crax, Gallus, Megapodius, Mitu, Nothocrax, Oreophasis, Orthalis, Pauxi, Penelope, Penelopina,
Pipile, Struthio, and Tinamus; see [8,37] for the phylogeny)
have a deletion of five amino acids that it is absent in
other vertebrate groups (amino acid positions 7-11 in the
alignment, [see Additional file 2], these amino acids occur
in a variable region across vertebrates). In the superfamily
Passeroidea (Aves) an insertion of four amino acids
(amino acid positions 201-204 in the alignment, [see
Additional file 2]) is characteristic of the monophyletic
group called "core Passeroidea" and includes the genera
Cardinalis, Emberiza, Estrilda, Fringilla, Icterus, Motacilla,
Parula, Passer, Ploceus, Prunella, and Thraupis (see [38] for
phylogeny). In the order Passeriformes (Aves) a deletion
of one amino acid (amino acid position 336 in the alignment, [see Additional file 2]) seems to have evolved mul-

tiple times as it occurs in some genera not belonging to a
monophyletic group (Ptilonorhynchus, Dryoscopus and Ailuroedus, for large avian phylogeny see [39]). In Testudines,
the family Emydidae shows a deletion of three amino
acids that seems to be characteristic of the clade including
the genera Graptemys and Trachemys, but not shared by the
other Emydidae included in our dataset (Actinemys).
Finally, synapomorphic insertions or deletions characterize a specific genus (e.g., an insertion of 20 amino acids in
Corvus (Aves)), a subfamily (e.g., in Amphibia the only
two genera of the subfamily Rhacophorinae included in
our dataset, Philautus and Polypedates, have a deletion of
four amino acids), or a family (e.g., an amino acid insertion characteristic of all the genera belonging to the family
Bombycillidae in Aves and a deletion of six amino acid
characteristic of the family Chamaeleonidae (Lepidosauria)), or in the parvorder Anguimorpha (Lepidosauria) (a
single amino acid insertion).
Comparison of different regions of Rag1
The 5' and 3'-ends of the gene differ in terms of genetic
diversity, with the 5' significantly more variable than the
3', across all vertebrates (Table 6) as well as within single
vertebrate lineages, with the exception of the number of
variable nucleotide sites for Aves, Lepidosauria (but for
these two groups the p-value is very close to significance),
Mammalia, and Testudines (Table 7).

The two functional regions included in the 5'-end of the
gene do not differ significantly in terms of genetic distances (Table 8). Base composition analysis of the two

Discussion

have to continuously face to find appropriate phylogenetic markers. This problem is even stronger when the
phylogenetic analysis involves distinct taxonomic groups
of different divergence times. Numerous articles (e.g.,
[1,40,41]) have dealt with the factors influencing the reliability of a molecular phylogeny. The lymphocyte-specific
recombination activating gene, Rag1, has been shown to
be a good phylogenetic marker in recovering phylogenetic
relationships within and among vertebrate lineages (see
Background). However, a few studies have also highlighted some possible flaws of this marker (e.g. in birds
[42] and in mammals [23]). The fact that Rag1 has
become of standard use in vertebrate phylogeny urges the
identification of possible problems inherent to this
marker.

The increasing number of available sequences in GenBank
and phylogenetic studies on different groups of organisms
has still not solved the main difficulties that researchers

Rag1 shows a strong departure from homogenous base
composition (Table 4) and high GC variation at 3rd codon

Almost all phylogenetically informative indels uniting the
Testudines and the Lepidosauria were found in the 5'-end
of the gene (Figure 4b), whereas the Actinopterygii were
defined as a clade based on indels in the 3'-end of the gene
(Figure 4c).

position in some vertebrate lineages and in some taxa
within the other vertebrate lineages that do not show an
overall high GC variation at this codon position. Moreover, while Hugall and colleagues [10] observed base heterogeneity only at the 3rd codon position in a restricted
vertebrate dataset, our results also reveal some departure
from homogeneity occurring at the 1st and 2nd position
(Table 4) and at the 3rd position in some species. Furthermore, GC content is higher at the 1st codon position than
at the 2nd or 3rd position in some lineages (Aves, Chondrichthyes, Crocodylia, Lepidosauria and Testudines, Figure 2). Overall base compositional skew is also a common
phenomenon in vertebrates Rag1, occurring at 1st and 2nd

codon positions [see Additional file 4]. Asymmetries in
the base compositions are also reflected by the amino acid
use, suggesting a selection for preferred amino acids in the
protein. Further studies investigating the 2D and 3D structure of RAG1 in distinct vertebrates could offer insights on
the possible selective constraints acting on the base composition. Base composition heterogeneity is thus a relatively common phenomenon in Rag1 in vertebrates, not
only limited to some vertebrate groups (e.g., [23,42]) and
may also influence substitution rate differences [10] and
thereby phylogenetic analyses. However, different phylogenetic analyses can be differently affected by compositional bias, as for example on smaller datasets this

Comparative analyses across vertebrates of the two parts of Rag1,
the 5' and 3'-ends. Number of sequences used for each monophyletic
vertebrate lineage: Amphibia = 7; Aves = 119; Crocodylia = 13;

phenomenon could possibly not be observed. We thus
suggest checking for possible base composition asymmetries before to run any phylogenetic analysis using
Rag1.
Our data also indicate instances of positive selection in
some vertebrate lineages (Aves, Lepidosauria) and at one
site in Testudines. These sites that are possibly under positive selection occur in a region coding for a unit with
functional activity in human RAG1, and further investigation is necessary to understand if this activity is also
present in the other major vertebrate lineages. Those lineages in which positive selection has not been observed do
not have a large number of sequences spanning the 5'-end
of the gene (except for Mammalia), where the positive
selected sites occur, indicating that sites under selection
may also be present in other lineages, beside the ones
observed here. While in the observed case, positive selection at these sites should not influence phylogenetic
reconstruction as it does not happen independently (for
the same sites and same amino acid changes) on different
branches, a more complete dataset across vertebrates

would give further insight into the functional activity of
these sites within and among vertebrate lineages.
Finally, insertions and deletions are relatively rare
genomic events and have hence often been used as
synapomorphic characters to resolve evolutionary relationships [43]. Our dataset indicates that insertions and
deletions in Rag1 may often occur in particular regions of
the gene and generally independently among major vertebrate taxa. The phylogenetic reliability of indels may
therefore be obscured by homoplasious insertion and
deletion events (e.g, as some of the indels in the cellular
myelocytomatosis oncogene, c-myc [44]). However,
within each vertebrate lineage these derived "length-characters" seem to be phylogenetically informative albeit taxonomically limited (see also Figure 4). Even if our dataset
recovered some vertebrate clades, it shows that the presence of indels characteristic of clades is limited within
each major vertebrate group, as described for other genes
in much smaller datasets (e.g., [44]). Further studies
including large datasets, multiple genes and statistical
analyses of ancestral state reconstruction, could add further understanding of the frequency with which insertions
and deletions occur as homoplasious characters. However, in our large Rag1 dataset we did not find clear insertions or deletions that would support the hypothesis of
common homoplasy. In fact, indels either occurred at different positions in different groups, or in hypervariable
regions of the gene which in any case are difficult to align.
Especially in such hypervariable regions, only a large data
set across vertebrates would allow distinguishing indels as
synapomorphic versus homoplasious, since the presence
of certain taxa could change the alignment of the dataset
and thus suggest different conclusions. Venkatesh and colleagues [43] identified three single amino acid deletions
assumed to be specific for some of the vertebrate lineages

Comparative analysis within each vertebrate lineage of the two parts of Rag1, 5' and 3'-ends. For each vertebrate lineage average Tamura-Nei
nucleotide distances, and average number of variable nucleotide sites within group have been used for the analysis. Tamura-Nei nucleotide distances
cannot be compared for Crocodylia as data are essentially constant between the two parts of the gene. Number of sequences used for each
monophyletic vertebrate lineage: Amphibia = 7; Aves = 119; Crocodylia = 13; Lepidosauria = 80; Mammalia = 37; Testudines = 24. "df" indicates the

analyzed in their alignment of a short fragment of Rag1.
In comparison to our alignment, however, their synapomorphic characters are not unambiguous and the one in
position 637-641 (Figure 5) occurs in a highly variable
region. Although phylogenetic results based on the use of
single amino acid deletions and insertions as synapomorphies with only limited taxon sampling cannot be generalized (see also discussion in [45]), this does not
invalidate the interpretation of major deletions or insertions of longer gene sections as rare genomic events of
high phylogenetic significance as observed for example in
Rag1 in squirrels by Steppan and colleagues [44] (see
review and Box 1 in [46], but also [45]).

Conclusions
Rag1 has been demonstrated to be a powerful marker for
phylogenetic reconstruction in vertebrates. Its quality is
attested by its widespread use in the community of molecular phylogeneticists, and by the quality of the results
which are usually in full agreement with those obtained
from other, comprehensive data sets. The gene is easily
aligned even across divergent taxa of vertebrates, largely
appears to lack saturation and does not contain introns in
the majority of vertebrates. However, our work and previous studies with a more restricted sampling report on a
highly heterogeneous base composition, especially at at
the 3rd codon position and for some specific taxa that may
affect phylogenetic reconstruction. Moreover, our data
also indicate instances of selection in the 5'-end of the
gene. Based on our results, the 5'-end of the gene shows
higher variability than the 3'-end and it is also slightly less
affected by a base composition bias. This suggests that the
use of the entire gene length fragment or of the 5'-end may
offer better resolution to problematic phylogenetic reconstruction. Especially when controversial and poorly supported relationships are to be studied we suggest verifying
if any taxa included in the dataset may show a strong
departure from a homogeneous base composition.

Finally, our data shows that in Rag1 indels do not seem to
be generally affected by homoplasy and may be used as
informative characters within vertebrate lineages.
