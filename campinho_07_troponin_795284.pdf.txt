Abstract
Background: Flatfish metamorphosis is a thyroid hormone (TH) driven process which leads to a
dramatic change from a symmetrical larva to an asymmetrical juvenile. The effect of THs on muscle
and in particular muscle sarcomer protein genes is largely unexplored in fish. The change in Troponin
T (TnT), a pivotal protein in the assembly of skeletal muscles sarcomeres and a modulator of calcium
driven muscle contraction, during flatfish metamophosis is studied.
Results: In the present study five cDNAs for halibut TnT genes were cloned; three were splice
variants arising from a single fast TnT (fTnT) gene; a fourth encoded a novel teleost specific fTnTlike cDNA (AfTnT) expressed exclusively in slow muscle and the fifth encoded the teleost specific
sTnT2. THs modified the expression of halibut fTnT isoforms which changed from predominantly
basic to acidic isoforms during natural and T4 induced metamorphosis. In contrast, expression of
red muscle specific genes, AfTnT and sTnT2, did not change during natural metamorphosis or after
T4 treatment. Prior to and after metamorphosis no change in the dorso-ventral symmetry or
temporal-spatial expression pattern of TnT genes and muscle fibre organization occurred in halibut
musculature.
Conclusion: Muscle organisation in halibut remains symmetrical even after metamorphosis
suggesting TH driven changes are associated with molecular adaptations. We hypothesize that
species specific differences in TnT gene expression in teleosts underlies different larval muscle
developmental programs which better adapts them to the specific ecological constraints.

Background
Troponin T (TnT) is a class of skeletal muscle specific proteins that are an important component of the thin-filament. TnT proteins are essential for correct assembly of
the sarcomeres [1,2] and are responsible for anchoring of
the Troponin complex to tropomyosin (Tm) and correct

assembly and function of Troponin I and C [3,4]. In tetrapods, three TnT genes exist, fast, slow and cardiac,
expressed respectively in white (fast-twitch and glycolytic), red (slow-twitch and oxidative) and cardiac muscle.
However, recent studies indicate that in teleosts a greater
number of genes exist and at least two fast TnT (fTnT) and

two slow TnT (sTnT) genes exist as well as an apparently
teleost specific intronless TnT (iTnT) gene [5-7].
In terrestrial vertebrates, TnT genes are known to produce
multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing mechanisms [3,4,6,8-20]. A number of factors, such as contractile properties [21], intracellular pH [22] in myofibres,
calcium dependence modulation during cross-bridge
cycling [23] and innervation patterns during development
[24], are proposed to be associated with TnT isoform
switching in cardiac and fast muscle of foetal and adult
terrestrial vertebrates. In contrast, in terrestrial vertebrates,
no developmental specific sTnT protein isoform changes
occur [4,9,13,18-20], although in adults red-muscle-specific isoforms are detected [3].
We recently reported the existence of three stage specific
fTnT transcripts in a teleost, the sea bream, namely embryonic, larval and adult which are splice variants of a single
gene [5]. Moreover, in contrast to tetrapods, two paralogue sTnT genes (sTnT1 and sTnT2) that exhibit developmental specific expression were also identified in sea
bream [6]. The teleost specific gene, sTnT2, is first detected
in sea bream in late epiboly stages and is the only sTnT
gene expressed up until 4 days post-hatch (dph) the time
at which sTnT1 expression starts [6]. Throughout larval
development and in early juvenile stages, sTnT1 is the predominant sTnT gene expressed in sea bream red muscle,
although in adult red muscle sTnT2 is the predominant
isoform and sTnT1 is virtually undetectable [6].

Studies in flatfish indicate that changes occur in muscle
during the thyroid hormone driven metamorphosis in
which a bilaterally symmetrical larvae changes to an
asymmetric juvenile. In pre-metamorphic pelagic larvae
of the flatfish Paralichthys olivaceus (flounder) two fTnT
immunoreactive proteins of 41.5 and 34 kDa were
reported [25]. However, when the larvae enter metamorphosis to become a benthic flatfish, the 41.5 kDa protein
is substituted by a new 33.5 kDa isoform. In post-metamorphosis juvenile fish only the 34 and 33.5 kDa isoforms of TnT are present [25]. Similarly, during
spontaneous metamorphosis larval 5,5'-dithio-bisnitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) light chain (myosin light chain
2, MLC2) is replaced by an adult specific isoform [26].
Although it is evident that changes which occur in muscle
during metamorphosis are probably associated with
changing functional requirements, surprisingly few
molecular studies exist of this process. In the present study
in order to analyse changes in skeletal muscle and in particular TnT gene expression during halibut (Hippoglossus
hippoglossus) natural and T4 induced metamorphosis,
cDNAs for slow and fast TnT were cloned and their expression and tissue distribution was studied in relation to
changing thyroid hormone concentrations and muscle
development.

Results
Halibut TnT genes
Five cDNAs corresponding to different skeletal muscle
TnT genes (Fig. 1) were isolated from a cDNA library of
metamorphosing halibut larvae. In tBLASTx analysis [27]

against the GeneBank database, three cDNAs gave a highly
significant match with teleost, fTnT genes. From the analysis it was determined that the fTnThh cDNAs isolated correspond to a putative embryonic/larval halibut fTnT
(denominated efTnThh; DQ680173) and two different
adult isoforms (denominated fTnThh-1, DQ680174, and
fTnThh-2, DQ680175). The efTnThh cDNA is a full-length
clone with 965 nucleotides (nt) and encodes a 286 amino
acids (aa) protein from nt 62 to 919. The size of the
deduced protein is 34.6 kDa and the predicted pI is 5.27
(Fig. 1)[28]. The fTnThh-1 isoform is a 752 bp cDNA
which encodes a protein of 232 aa from nt 22 to 717 (Fig.
1). The deduced fTnThh-1 protein has a predicted molecular weight of 27.89 kDa and a pI of 9.42 [28]. The cDNA
of the third isoform, denominated fTnThh-2, is 1,020 bp
long and encodes a putative protein of 229 aa from nt 70
to 756 (Fig. 1). The predicted molecular weight and pI for
the fTnThh-2 protein isoform is respectively 27.5 kDa and
9.55 [28].
In silico characterisation of the deduced halibut fTnT proteins using ProDom [29] and PRINTS [30] software confirmed that they possess all the characteristics of fully
functional fTnT proteins. ClustalX [31] multiple alignment analysis of these putative halibut fTnT cDNAs and
their deduced protein sequence indicates that they are the
products of alternative splicing of the halibut fTnT gene
(Fig. 1). Isoform efTnThh shares 80% sequence identity
with fTnThh-1 and -2 isoforms, whereas isoforms fTnThh1 and -2 are 99% similar. The differences between the halibut TnT cDNA isolated are due to the presence of an
insert in efTnThh (aa 12 to 68) and fTnThh-1 (aa 12 to 14)
which is lacking in the fThThh-2 isoform (Fig. 1).
A further 1,107 bp cDNA was also cloned and tBLASTx
analysis [27] suggests that it most closely resembles an
fTnT gene and gave the most significant hit to D. rerio
fTnTa gene and it was tentatively designated an atypical fast
TnT cDNA (AfTnThh-1; DQ680176) as a consequence of
its tissue distribution. The predicted protein product
encoded by AfTnThh-1 cDNA was 289 aa with a pI of 5.07
and molecular weight of 34.21 kDa (Fig. 1)[28].
A halibut cDNA homologous to a previously reported teleost specific sTnT2 gene was also cloned. This cDNA, designated sTnT2hh (DQ680172), is 980 bp long and
encodes a deduced protein of 246 aa (Fig. 1) with a predicted molecular weight of 29 kDa and a pI of 9.24 [28].
It was not possible, despite extensive cDNA library screening to isolate a cDNA that was the product of a putative
halibut sTnT1 gene.
ClustalX multiple sequence alignment [31] of the
deduced amino acid sequence of halibut TnT genes show
that efTnThh shares 69% and 52% sequence identity,

respectively, with AfTnThh and sTnT2hh. Comparison of
the other halibut fTnT-1 and -2 isoforms with AfTnThh
and sTnT2hh reveal they share ~59% sequence identity
while, AfTnThh and sTnT2hh share 50% identity.
Putative genomic organization of halibut skeletal TnT
genes
In silico tBLASTx analysis [27] using halibut fTnT cDNA
sequences gave a highly significant hit to Tetraodon nigroviridis genomic scaffold 7217 (SCAF7217). The putative
Tetraodon and deduced halibut fTnT gene is composed of
14 exons (Fig. 2A) as previously described for the sea
bream [5]. The efTnThh isoform is composed of exons I to
III and V to XIV (Fig. 2A). Isoform fTnThh-1 contains all
exons except exon V, which codes for the highly acidic
peptide containing a glutamic acid (E), proline (P) repeat
(Fig. 1 and 2A). In the isoform fTnThh-2 mRNA, exons IV
and V are spliced out (Fig. 2A) which results in the loss of
9 nt in relation to fTnThh-1 (Fig. 1). The ATG transcription
start signal is located in exon II and exon I bears the beginning of the 5'UTR (Fig. 2A). The 3'UTR and the end of the
protein coding region are located in exon XIV. Overall
coverage of the fTnThh cDNA sequences was 97% and
overall identity between it and the Tetraodon fTnT gene
sequence was 82%.

The halibut AfTnThh gene used in tBLASTx analysis led to
the identification of the putative Tetraodon AfTnT locus in
scaffold 15099 (SCAF15099) as well as five different
Tetraodon AfTnT cDNA isoforms (numbered 1 to 5) which
seem to be the product of alternative splicing (AfTnTtn-1,
CR696067; AfTnTtn-2, CR675364; AfTnTtn-3, CR662746;
AfTnTtn-4, CR727722; AfTnTtn-5, CR673164). The Tetraodon AfTnT cDNA and the AfTnThh cDNA were used to
deduce the putative genomic organization of the AfTnT
gene in Tetraodon scaffold 15099 by aligning the cDNAs
and genomic sequences in Spidey [32]. The analysis
revealed that the Tetraodon AfTnT gene (AfTnTtn) is composed of 16 exons with conserved intron/exon boundaries
spanning 8946 bp in Tetraodon scaffold 15099 (Fig. 2B).
Tetraodon AfTnTtn cDNAs had 100% coverage in the
Tetraodon genomic sequence of scaffold 15099 and the
majority of exons shared 100% nucleotide sequence conservation. The halibut AfTnThh cDNA had 100% coverage
in the Tetraodon genomic sequence of scaffold 15099 and
shared 79% overall sequence identity. Exon I bears part of
the 5'UTR while exon II contains the remainder and the
ATG translation start site. Exon III is composed of 13 nt
and constitutes together with exons I and II the N-terminal constitutive exons present in all Tetraodon AfTnT
cDNAs identified. Exon II and III share 77% sequence
identity between the Tetraodon genomic sequence and halibut AfTnThh cDNA, while exon I shares only 58% identity. Exon IV which codes for 3 acidic residues both in
Tetraodon and halibut is the first N-terminal alternatively
spliced exon in Tetraodon cDNAs, and shares 75%
sequence identity between Tetraodon genomic and halibut
AfTnThh cDNA sequence. Exon V is the largest alternatively spliced N-terminal exon in Tetraodon and is the
most divergent between the Tetraodon genomic sequence
and halibut AfTnT cDNA. In this exon the sequence identity is only 52% and a 41 nt insertion in the third quarter
of the Tetraodon genomic sequence renders this exon bigger in Tetraodon than in halibut. However, the 5' and 3'
regions of the Tetraodon sequence are well conserved with
the corresponding halibut AfTnT sequence. Exons VI and
VII are highly conserved (94%) between the Tetraodon
genomic sequence and halibut AfTnT cDNA sequence and
are alternatively spliced in Tetraodon. Exons VIII to XVI
encode the C-terminal constitutive region present in all
vertebrate TnT genes and sequence conservation between
the Tetraodon and halibut was always greater than 85%
and no splice variants of this region were observed in
Tetraodon. Exon XVI codes for the last 11 amino acid residues of the protein and the entire 3'UTR. Although exon
XVI shares only 47% sequence identity between Tetraodon
and halibut the sequence divergence is in the 3'UTR rather
than the coding region (86% sequence identity).
The genomic organization of halibut sTnT2 gene in Tetraodon was also determined (Fig. 2C). Using the sTnT2hh

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/71

sequence in tBLASTx analysis [27] of the Tetraodon
genome database [33] a single hit with Tetraodon scaffold
15000 (SCF15000) was found. A single cDNA transcript
(CR734482) arising from Tetraodon sTnT2 gene
(SCF15000) was isolated and introduced in Spidey aligning software [32] along with the halibut sTnT2 cDNA
sequence to determine the putative genomic organization
of sTnT2. The putative Tetraodon sTnT locus is composed
of 12 exons and spans 2567 nt in the Tetraodon genomic
sequence (Fig. 2C). Exon I bears the first three-quarters of
the 5'UTR and the beginning of the coding region is
located in exon II. Exon XII contains the 3'-end of the coding region as well as the 3'UTR (Fig. 2C). The halibut

sTnT2hh cDNA sequence had 86% coverage in the Tetraodon genomic sequence and shared 82% sequence identity.
Tissue specificity of halibut TnT genes
Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis were carried out in
order to determine tissue specificity of the halibut TnT
genes isolated. The northern blot results (Fig. 3A) show
that fTnThh, as expected, is expressed in adult halibut
white (fast) muscle and is absent from red muscle, cardiac
muscle and liver. However, the more sensitive RT-PCR
technique revealed that fTnThh is also expressed in halibut
adult red muscle (Fig. 3B). The tBLASTx and phylogenetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/71

analysis of AfTnThh classified this cDNA as the product of
a fast TnT gene, although its expression is red (slow) muscle specific (Fig. 3A) and it is not detected in adult white
(fast) muscle, cardiac muscle or liver. The halibut sTnT2
gene is exclusively expressed in halibut adult red muscle
(Fig. 3A). The red muscle tissue specificity of AfTnThh and
sTnT2hh was further confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3B).
Phylogenetic analysis of Halibut TnT genes
ClustalX multiple sequence alignment [31] of the
deduced protein of halibut TnT and other vertebrate TnT
protein sequences and striated muscle TnT from C. elegans
was performed and the resulting phylogenetic relationships were determined in PAUP* version 4.0b software
[34] using the maximum-parsimony method with 1000
bootstraps [35] and C. elegans TnT as an outgroup.

The phylogenetic tree shows that the vertebrate fTnTs
form a single clade and that within it the tetrapod fTnTs
cluster apart from the fish fTnTs (Figure 4). Moreover, efTnThh, fTnThh-1 and fTnThh-2 cluster with highly significant bootstrap values with other teleost fTnT genes.
Within the main fTnT clade, AfTnThh and Tetraodon AfTnTtn isoforms clustered together and formed a separate
group and this topology was supported by highly significant bootstrap values (Fig. 4).
Two principal clades were found for sTnT which corresponded to sTnT1 and sTnT2 (Fig. 4). The halibut sTnT2hh
clusters with other teleost specific sTnT2 genes (Fig. 4) and
forms a group apart from tetrapod sTnT and sTnT1, which
clustered together.

TnT expression during halibut metamorphosis
The expression of the isolated halibut fTnT, AfTnT and
sTnT2 genes was analysed by RT-PCR during halibut metamorphosis (Fig. 5, 6 and 7, respectively). The primers
used in this analysis encompass the entire N-terminal
hypervariable region which is known in vertebrates to
generate alternative spliced isoforms [3,4,6,8-20]. Three
fTnThh isoforms were amplified by RT-PCR during halibut
metamorphosis, the largest product corresponded to efTnThh (423 bp) while the smaller products correspond to,
fTnThh-1 (261 bp) and fTnThh-2 (252 bp; Fig. 5A). A further reaction product is observed between the efTnThh
and the other two isoforms that does not represent an
authentic isoform but a heteroduplex of efTnThh and the
other two isoforms since isolation followed by PCR, subcloning and sequencing always yield either efTnThh or one
of the other two isoforms.

The three halibut fTnT isoforms are all present in premetamorphic halibut larvae (stg 5–7) and efTnThh is the
predominant isoform expressed up until the beginning of
climax and has approximately 2-fold higher expression

than fTnThh-1 and -2 (stg 8; HSD, p < 0.001; Fig. 5A and
5B). At the beginning of climax fTnThh-2 expression starts
to increase and at the climax of metamorphosis (stg 9) the
efTnThh isoform is downregulated and is almost undetectable in fully metamorphosed juveniles (stg 10, Fig. 5A
and 5B). In parallel fTnThh-2 becomes the most highly
expressed fTnThh isoform and increases ~3-fold in juveniles (Fig. 5A and 5B). Prior to, and after metamorphosis
fTnThh-1 expression does not change significantly (Fig.
5A and 5B). Analysis of fTnT isoform expression in adult
halibut muscle by RT-PCR confirmed the general pattern
encountered by Northern blot (Fig. 3A). However, the
more sensitive RT-PCR technique permitted detection of
fTnThh isoforms in halibut adult red -muscle (Fig. 3B and
3C). In halibut adult white muscle low expression of efTnThh (~14-fold lower than fTnThh-2) is observed,
fTnThh-2 continues to be the predominant isoform
although fTnThh-1 expression has increased and is about
half that of fTnThh-2 (Fig. 3B and 3C). The ratio of the different fTnThh mRNA in red muscle differs from white
muscle since fTnThh-2 is ~10-fold more expressed than
efTnThh and fTnThh-1 which are almost undetectable
(Fig. 3B and 3C).

In contrast to fTnThh, expression of halibut AfTnThh (Fig.
6A) and sTnT2hh (Fig. 7A) detected by RT-PCR does not
change during metamorphosis (Fig. 7). However, 4 alternatively spliced isoforms of AfTnThh are detected (Fig. 8A
and 8D). Sequence analysis reveals that the AfTnThh isoforms are a result of alternative splicing of exons IV, V and
VII (Fig. 2) and are designated AfTnThh-1 to -4. The largest
product, AfTnThh-1 (439 bp) is identical to the AfTnThh
cDNA isolated by library screening and includes all alternatively spliced exons (Fig. 6A and 6D); AfTnThh-2 (412
bp; DQ680177) lacks exons IV and VII but exon V is
maintained (Fig. 6A and 6D); AfTnThh-3 (301 bp;
DQ680178) is composed of exon IV and VII but exon V is
spliced out (Fig. 6A and 6D); and in AfTnThh-4 (283 bp;
DQ680179) only exon IV is spliced in and all other alternatively spliced exons (exons V and VII) are spliced out
(Fig. 6A and 6D). All the halibut AfTnThh isoforms
detected contain exon VI (Fig. 6D) and neither the isoform expression pattern nor the ratio between these AfTnThh isoforms is altered during metamorphosis (Fig. 6A–
C). A small but statistically significant (HSD, p ≤ 0.005;
Fig. 6A and 6B) decrease in expression of all the isoforms
is observed in stg 10 juveniles; AfTnThh-1 is the predomi-

nant isoform throughout the halibut's life. In turn, AfTnThh-2 is the second most abundant isoform and its
expression increases after climax (HSD, p ≤ 0.006; Fig. 6A
and 6B). However, in adult red muscle the ratio of the two
isoforms is identical to pre-metamorphic stg 5 animals
(Fig. 6A and 6C). The AfTnThh-3 and -4 isoforms have
identical (HSD, p > 0.05), very low expression (Fig. 6A–C)

and their expression and ratio in relation to other isoforms does not change during metamorphosis (HSD, p >
0.05; Fig. 6A–C). Moreover, in adult red muscle these low
molecular weight isoforms are not expressed (Fig. 6A and

Spatial-temporal expression pattern of halibut TnT genes
during metamorphosis
The spatial-temporal expression pattern of TnT mRNA
was determined in free- swimming halibut larvae which
feed exogenously. In such larvae two distinct muscle layers are evident, an inner white and superficial red muscle
layer (Fig. 8). In stage 5 halibut the anatomical organisation of the white muscle is very simple with a "V" shaped
myomere and it is composed of several block-like bilaterally symmetrical myotomes bounded by a septum. The
extreme dorsal and ventral myotomes and the lateral
region of the myotomes close to the red muscle is characterized by the presence of numerous small rounded fibres,
characteristic of germinal zones, while in the deeper
region of the larger myotomes, fibres are much larger,
more block-like and are closely packed. In subsequent
stages myotome number increases and in stage 6 halibut
larvae they take on the typical "W" shaped myomer organisation.

increase in the volume of muscle occurs in stages 8, 9 and
10 (Fig. 8). Regions of hyperplastic growth persist in the
most ventral and dorsal myotomes in all of the stages analysed. A rapid increase in myotome number is evident
from stage 5 through 7 and in subsequent stages hypertrophic growth leads to a considerable increase in myotome and overall muscle volume. In stage 5 the red
muscle layer is a monolayer of fibres at the outermost
region of the myotomes, although proliferating red muscle fibres at the midline region of the myotome generate a
small region with a double layer of fibres. In stage 6 larvae
this double layer is much more evident and in successive
larval stages all the red muscle layer is proliferating so that
in stage 9 halibut it is composed of several layers of fibres
of different sizes. Notably during the entire metamorphic
process the symmetry of the myotomes is maintained
even though the skull becomes asymmetric with the right
eye migrating to the left side of the head that at the end of
metamorphosis constitutes the dorsal side of halibut
body.

No change in the bilateral symmetry of the muscle anatomy accompanies metamorphosis, although a significant

Halibut embryonic/larval fTnT exon expression in premetamorphic halibut larvae (Stg5 and 6; Fig. 8 and Fig. 9A
and 9B) is restricted to white muscle, in the lateral and
apical germinal zones of the myotome. As the halibut larvae approach metamorphic climax (Stg8; Fig. 8 and Fig.
9C) the efTnThh expression is significantly downregulated
and confined to very small fibres and to presumptive satellite cells (arrows in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9C). From climax of
metamorphosis (stg 9; Fig. 8 and 9D) onwards no efTnThh
expression is detected. The 3'UTR fTnT probe reveals the
general fTnThh expression pattern in stage 5 (Fig. 8 and
Fig. 9E) and stage 6 larvae (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9F) which is
similar to that observed with the embryonic/larval fTnT
exon probe. At stage 8 (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9G) fTnT is uniformly distributed in the white muscle. As the animals
reach post-metamorphic juvenile stage 10 (Fig. 8 and Fig.
9H) fTnThh expression looses its uniformity and although
still expressed in the entire myotome, the signal is more
intense in cells close to the myosepta (Fig. 8).
Halibut AfTnT and sTnT2 gene expression is confined to
red muscle fibres in all metamorphic stages analysed.
Expression of AfTnT in pre-metamorphic stage 5 larvae
(Fig. 8 and Fig. 9I) is highly abundant in the red muscle
layer. At the end of larval life, just before the onset of metamorphosis, (stg 6) in the myotome midline region two
red muscle cell layers both expressing AfTnT are present
(data not shown). In stage 8 (Fig. 9K) the expression of
AfTnThh is detected uniformly in all the fibres of the red
muscle, while in post-metamorphic juveniles at stage 10
(Fig. 8 and Fig. 9L) it is mostly present in the smaller fibres
(arrowheads in Fig. 9L). In the case of sTnT2, expression is
restricted to the red muscle layer and is very similar to
AfTnT in stage 5 (Fig. 9M), 6 (Fig. 9N), 8 (Fig. 9O), 10
(Fig. 9P) halibut. The spatial-temporal expression pattern
of red muscle specific halibut TnT genes is symmetrical
and does not change during halibut metamorphosis (Fig.
8 and 9).
TH levels in metamorphosing halibut
At the beginning of metamorphosis and up until the
beginning of climax (stg 8), T4 levels remain low with no
significant differences observed between stages 5, 6 and 8
(HSM, p > 0.05; Fig. 10). In fact in larvae at the beginning
of metamorphosis (stg 7) T4 levels are lower than in premetamorphic larvae (stg 5, HSD, p < 0.05). At the climax
of metamorphosis (stg 9), whole-body T4 content
increases about 3-fold in relation to all the previous stages
(HSM, p < 0.005, Fig. 10). In post-metamorphic juveniles
(stg 10) T4 levels continue high and, although not significantly different from stage 9, they are significantly higher
than all other preceding stages (stg 5 to 8, HSM, p < 0.001;
Fig. 10).

There is a general increase in myotome volume during metamorphosis. Note that throughout muscle ontogeny, prior to
and after metamorphosis, symmetry is maintained both in the
sagital and longitudinal planes. In pre-metamorphic halibut
(stg 5 and 6) white muscle hyperplasic small diameter fibers
are located in the most apical and lateral sides of the myotome regions (insert) which predominantly express efTnThh
(black dots). As white muscle fibers increase in size the
expression of fTnThh isoforms disappears. The expression of
the other fTnThh isoforms (light grey dots) co-localizes with
efTnThh expression up until stg 7. When the animals reach
the beginning of metamorphosis (stg 7) all mature white muscle fibers express fTnThh-1 and -2 isoforms (light grey shading) and efTnThh is only found in smaller diameter hyperplasic
fibers in the periphery of the myotomes around the
myosepta (black dots). As the animals enter the climax of
metamorphosis expression of the low molecular weight
fTnThh isoforms is located in the entire myotome (light grey
shading) and efTnThh is confined to scattered presumptive
satellite cells (black dots). At climax (stg 9) and in juvenile
(stg 10) white muscle fTnThh-1 and -2 isoforms are expressed
in all the myotome with varying intensity and in fibers close
to the myosepta expression is higher. In pre-metamorphic
halibut red muscle (dark grey) all cells express sTnT2hh and
AfTnThh. The expression of the red muscle specific Troponin T
genes is constant and restricted to the outer red muscle
throughout halibut metamorphosis and in juvenile animals.

Before metamorphosis and up until climax of metamorphosis (stg 9) T3 levels are lower than T4 (HSD, p < 0.001;
Fig. 10). In fact, T3 levels decrease from pre-metamorphic
larvae (stg 5) until the start of metamorphosis (stg 8) (Fig.
10). However, in halibut at climax (stg 9) T3 levels
increase more than 200-fold and are higher than T4 levels
(HSD, p < 0.001; Fig. 10). However, after metamorphosis
T4 levels are again higher than T3 levels (HSD, p < 0.001;
Fig. 10). T3 levels at climax and in fully metamorphosed
juveniles are significantly higher than all previous halibut
stages (HSD, p < 0.001; Fig. 10).

Discussion
We have isolated cDNAs from three different striated muscle TnT genes in the halibut one of which is white muscle
specific while the other two are red muscle specific. Alternative splicing of the fTnThh gene gives rise to three alternative splice variants which encode three proteins varying
only in the N-terminal region (Fig. 1). As observed for the
fTnT gene of S. auratus [5], halibut fTnT is also expressed
in adult red muscle. In fact, the expression of teleost fastspecific genes in red muscle seems to be a common feature
in teleost species [36,37]. In relation to fTnThh-1 (predicted MR 27.89 kDa and pI 9.42) and fTnThh-2 (predicted MR 27.5 kDa and pI 9.55), the putative efTnThh
protein isoform is bigger (MR 34.6 kDa) and more acidic
(pI 5.27) and the difference arises as a consequence of
splicing in of exon V (Fig. 2A), in a way similar to that previously reported in S. auratus, a perciform and also in
other vertebrates [4,10-13], [38-50]. In the halibut the
number of alternatively spliced fTnT isoforms are the
same as found in Tetraodon and S. auratus [5]. In common
with Tetraodon efTnT, exon V is spliced in and exon IV is
spliced out (Fig. 1 and 2A). This is in contrast to efTnT in
S. auratus in which exon IV is also spliced in along with
exon V [5] suggesting that in the halibut and Tetraodon
exons IV and V are mutually exclusively expressed (Fig.
2A). Although no data is available about the specific biochemical characteristics of muscle fibres in halibut, S.
aurata or Tetraodon larvae, the present study indicates that
differences probably exist between teleost species and
these differences are probably an adaptation to their differing ecologies and locomotive strategies.

significant statistical differences between efTnThh expression in control and T4 treated halibut larvae (HSD, p < 0.05). No reference signifies no significant statistical difference (HSD, p > 0.05).

In rat, human and mouse it has been reported that some
fTnT isoforms predominate over others due to the specific
biochemical characteristics of different fibres types [51].
In these mammals acidic, fetal fTnT isoforms predominate in mainly glycolytic fibres whereas more basic isoforms are predominant in mainly oxidative fibres [51].
However, there are clear differences between teleost and
tetrapod fTnT genes. In tetrapods alternative splicing of
the fTnT gene generates several N-terminal protein isoforms through the use of a greater number of alternatively
spliced exons [4,11] whereas in teleosts it seems that only
two exons undergo alternative splicing (Fig. 2A; [5]).
Although the fetal/embryonic exon is bigger in teleosts
than in tetrapods they have similar biochemical characteristics as it encodes an acidic peptide containing several
glutamic acid residues (present study; [5,12]). No fTnT
cDNA isoforms which give rise to 3' spliced variants and
therefore proteins with differing C-terminal sequences are

observed in halibut, Tetraodon or S. auratus. Curiously, the
deduced C-terminal amino acid sequence of all halibut
fTnT isoforms share greatest identity to tetrapod isoforms
containing the embryonic specific exon 17 [4,10,47,52].
Together with a previous study in teleosts [5] the present
data in halibut seem to reinforce the idea that the occurrence of alternatively spliced exons in the C-terminal
region of the fTnT gene is a characteristic exclusive to terrestrial vertebrates. Nonetheless, the genomic organization of fTnT genes in teleosts is identical to tetrapods [11]
and from an evolutionary perspective, it seems likely that
alternative splicing to generate N-terminal protein variants of the fTnT gene in vertebrates already occurred
before the divergence of actinoperigii and sarcopterigii
vertebrate lineages.
An unexpected observation arising from the present study
was the identification of a large (predicted MR 34.21 kDa),

BMC Developmental Biology 2007, 7:71

highly acidic (predicted pI 5.07) halibut skeletal muscle
TnT (AfTnT) gene with high sequence identity to D. rerio
fTnTa gene [7]. A homologue of this TnT gene was found
in Tetraodon together with five splice variants and despite
its unusual characteristics it had a similar organization to
other vertebrate TnT genes [4,7,10-13,19,38-52]. The
highly acidic nature of the protein isoforms encoded by
this gene is a consequence of splicing in of exon V which
encodes a very acidic stretch (~50 aa) of amino acids.
Regardless of the fact that both sequence similarity and
phylogenetic analysis categorise the putative AfTnThh
protein as a fast TnT the tissue expression analysis (Fig. 3)
indicates that the AfTnT is a red muscle specific gene in
halibut. This is the first time to our knowledge that a gene
presumed to be fast muscle specific in vertebrates is exclusively expressed in red muscle. The observations of TnTs in
halibut and zebrafish [7] indicate that despite the apparent anatomical simplicity of striated skeletal muscle in teleosts, at the molecular level they have novel adaptations
that probably underline species-specific control mechanisms of muscle development.
Halibut TnT genes expression during metamorphosis
The expression of AfTnThh and sTnT2hh transcripts does
not appear to change at climax of metamorphosis,
although changes in the expression of fTnT gene isoforms
do coincide with this developmental stage in halibut. The
transition in expression of fTnT isoforms is correlated
with the increase in whole-body T3 and T4 levels and the
downregulation of efTnThh (Fig. 5) In turn, TH levels correlate positively with the increase in expression of fTnThh2 (Fig. 5, 9 and 10). A similar situation also occurs in
other flatfish, Paralichthys olivaceus [25], Solea solea and
Scophthalmus maximus [53] and at the climax of metamorphosis an acidic efTnT isoform is downregulated and
lower molecular weight and more basic isoforms are
upregulated, and detected in juvenile and adult white
muscle.

The changes in fTnT isoform expression in different teleost (present study, [5,25,53]) are reminiscent of what
occurs in tetrapods in which fetal acidic fTnT isoforms are
downregulated immediately after birth and are substituted by basic adult isoforms [10,54,55]. Moreover, a
common mechanism of alternative splicing of 5' exons in
the fTnT gene in teleosts, birds and mammals, implied by
similar codon splitage combinations [5,11], further reinforces the hypothesis that alternative splicing of the fTnT
gene is conserved and occurs in order to cope with similar
developmental demands on muscle in all vertebrates. The
transition from acidic to a basic isoforms in fTnT genes
seems to be a common trend in vertebrates and represents
a physiological, mechanistic and functional adaptation of
developing striated muscle [3,10,22,23]. This strong conservation suggests that the same factors responsible for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/71

fTnT isoform transition during development are common
throughout vertebrates and may be a trait acquired long
before the divergence of the actinoperigii and sarcopterigii
vertebrate lineages. In fact, teleost muscle and tetrapod
muscle face similar physiological and biochemical
changes during development. Foetal mammalian muscle
grows by hyperplasia up until birth and muscle fibres are
mainly glycolytic while the mainly oxidative adult muscle
fibres, that differentiate after birth, express predominantly
basic fTnT isoforms [51]. In teleosts, the muscle fibres also
change their biochemical and physiological characteristics
during development and up until metamorphosis white
muscle is the major respiratory surface of the larvae and
fibres are mainly aerobic and rich in mitochondria
whereas the adult muscle fibres are mainly anaerobic [5662].
As shown by others, and in contrast to tetrapod postembryonic muscle development, in teleost species of large
size, like the halibut, post-embryonic muscle development takes place in two steps in which hyperplasia is the

growth
[36,56,58,60,61,63,64]. The first hyperplasic phase of
post-embryonic muscle development in large size teleost
larvae is characterised by proliferative epaxial and lateral
areas of the myotome and as animals reach the juvenile
stage these regions are depleted and a second stage of
hyperplasic growth continues in scattered myogenic cells
throughout the myotome. Notably, the efTnThh isoform is
mainly found at the most epaxial and lateral zones of halibut pre-metamorphic larval white muscle myotome,
especially in small diameter white muscle fibres (Fig. 8
and 9A–E and A'-E'). The early differentiated halibut larvae white-muscle myoblasts appear to first express predominantly efTnT and as they mature and are
incorporated in the myotome expression is downregulated and other fTnT isoforms take their place. In vertebrates the embryonic to adult fTnT isoforms pattern of
change is related to alterations in cellular pH, metabolic
and physiological characteristics of maturing muscle
fibres [3,10,22,23]. The transition from acid to basic pI
fTnT isoforms in developing halibut muscle may be associated with the transition from proliferative small diameter muscle cells to more basic larger white muscle fibres.
In fact, in S. auratus it was found that larval small diameter
myoblast cells located in the hyperplasic lateral and epaxial region of the larval myotome contain acid mATPase
activity whereas mature large diameter muscle fibres have
mild alkali mATPase activity [36]. Together with the
downregulation of expression of efTnThh at halibut metamorphosis these hyperplasic proliferative areas of the
myotome are gradually depleted just as metamorphosis
starts and totally absent in animals entering climax (Fig. 8
and 9A–E and A'-E'). This resembles the situation in S.
auratus where at the end of larval life the same lateral and

apical hyperplasic white muscle germinative areas are
depleted [65]. However, and in contrast to what occurs in
S. auratus [5], the treatment of pre-metamorphic halibut
larvae with T4 shows that thyroid hormones control the
expression profile of fTnT isoforms in the halibut and also
in other flatfish [25].
The relationship between THs and change in fTnT isoform
expression has yet to be directly demonstrated in teleosts.
It is notable that despite the accepted role of THs in driving flatfish metamorphosis and the change from a symmetrical larvae to an asymmetrical juvenile, the way in
which muscle symmetry changes has been largely ignored.
In the present study muscle development was found to be
a bilaterally symmetrical process before, during and after
metamorphosis as revealed by histology and in situ gene
expression studies. Nonetheless, the changes in TnT isoform expression in halibut, S. solea, S. maximus and P. olivaceus indicate muscle is TH responsive [53,25] as has
been demonstrated in mammals. In rats T3 increased the
expression of Ca2+ ATPase specifically in white muscle
fibres and the increase in relaxation rate of post-embryonic white muscle was strictly dependent on THs [66].
Moreover, in mammals THs are necessary to complete
development of skeletal muscle [67]. The results from
experiments in teleosts suggest that various post-embryonic muscle development mechanisms exist. For example,
in S. auratus [5] slow muscle seems to be more sensitive to
THs than white muscle, whereas in halibut, expression of
the slow-muscle specific genes sTnT2hh and AfTnThh does
not alter during metamorphosis (when endogenous T4
levels rise) or in response to exongenous T4 (Fig. 6, 7 and
11).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/71

more work is required to establish the specific molecular
and cellular events during flatfish and round fish muscle
development.

Methods
TnT cDNA library screening
A lambda phage cDNA library made from metamorphosing larvae of halibut was plated in densities ranging from
1,000–5,000 plaque forming units (pfu). A probe was
obtained for skeletal TnT by randomly isolating and
sequencing 10 clones. A putative halibut fTnT obtained in
this way was used as a probe for cDNA library screening or
alternatively a PstI/EcoRI digested cDNA fragment from a
sea bream sTnT2 gene (sTnT2sb)[6] was utilised. In each
screen using the halibut fTnT or the sTnT2sb probe, nitrocellulose membrane lifts were performed and membranes
pre-hybridized for 2 hours, respectively, at 65°C or 60°C
in hybridization solution (6×SSC, 0.1%SDS, 100 µg/mL
tRNA, 5× Denhardt's). DNA probes were labelled with
[32P] by random priming (Megaprime, random labelling
kit, Amersham Biosciences, UK) and purified on a sephadex column. Radioactively labelled probes were diluted in
new hybridization mix and allowed to hybridize overnight with the membranes. Two post-hybridisation stringency washes were carried out for ~30 minutes at room
temperature (1×SSC, 0.1%SDS) followed by two 30
minute washes (1×SSC, 0.1%SDS) at 65°C or 60°C,
respectively. Membranes where then exposed overnight at
-80°C to Biomax MS film (Kodak, Palo Alto, CA, USA)
and several positive plaques were isolated and automatically excised into pBluescript SK+/- (Stratagene), DNA
purified and cDNA clones sequenced to give 3-fold coverage using BigDye Version 3 (Perkin-Elmer, UK) chemistry
and an ABI 3700 sequencer.

Conclusion
Together with previous studies in teleost TnT genes
[6,7,25,53] the present work shows that teleost muscle,
although apparently simpler and having a smaller
number of specialized muscles in comparison to tetrapods [3,4] shows remarkable genetic heterogeneity and
species-specific regulation. The diversity of TnT forms in
teleost muscle arise from alternative splicing but also from
a new teleost specific TnT gene and this heterogeneity
probably contributes to better adapt the musculature to
the specific functional demands of different teleost species. In common with other flatfish, but in contrast to the
round fish, S. auratus [5], the halibut fTnT gene isoform
expression profile is regulated at metamorphosis by THs,
although halibut red muscle specific genes seem to be
insensitive. Interestingly, the asymmetry arising during
flatfish metamorphosis does not extend to the musculature and the temporal and spatial expression patterns of
TnT genes and muscle fibre organization remains symmetrical before, during and after metamorphosis (Fig. 8
and 9). Clearly THs regulate muscle development but far

Phylogenetic analysis
The identity of the halibut TnT cDNA isolated was
assigned by tBLASTx analysis [27] against GenBank and
the Medaka (Oryzia latipes) EST database [68]. All tetrapod
and teleost TnT cDNA sequences were retrieved and their
deduced amino acid sequence compared to that of halibut
TnTs using ClustalX software [31]. The phylogenetic relationship of halibut TnT genes with other vertebrate TnT
genes was analysed using the maximum-parsimony
method option of PAUP* version 4.0b software [34] with
1000 bootstraps [35] and TnT sequences available from
databases (Table 1). Caenorhabditis elegans striated muscle
TnT (GenBank accession no. NP509076.1) was used as
outgroup. All the sequences obtained during this study
have been submitted to EMBL/GenBank data library
under the accession numbers DQ680172 to DQ680179
(corresponding respectively to sTnThh2, efTnThh,
fTnThh-1, fTnThh2, AfTnThh-1, AfTnThh-2, AfTnThh-3
and AfTnThh-4).

Putative genomic organisation of halibut TnT genes
The putative genomic organisation of isolated halibut TnT
genes was established in silico using the Tetraodon nigroviridis genome database [69]. The Tetraodon scaffolds giving the most significant hit by tBLASTx analysis [27] with
the halibut TnT sequences were recovered. Pairwise alignment of halibut and Tetraodon TnT cDNA sequences with
the selected Tetraodon scaffold using Spidey mRNA-togenome software [32] permitted identification of the
putative exon/intron boundaries of the halibut TnT genes
Animal sampling
Atlantic halibut at different developmental stages (Saele et
al. 2004) ranging from pre-metamorphic larvae to fully
metamorphosed juveniles were obtained from Fiskey (Iceland). Animals (n = 10) were anesthetized in MS-222

(Sigma) and immediately collected for total RNA extraction by preservation in RNAlater (QIAgen, UK) according
to the manufacturers instruction. An adult halibut was
anesthetised in MS-222 (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and killed by
decapitation and white muscle, red muscle, heart and liver
were immediately collected into RNAlater (QIAgen)
according to the manufacturers instructions. Alternatively,
for in situ hybridization and histology anaesthetized halibut larvae and juveniles were fixed in paraformaldehyde
(4% PFA) at 4°C overnight. Samples were subsequently
washed twice for 5–10 minutes with PBT and stored in
100% methanol at 4°C. Samples where embedded in paraffin and 5 µm post-anal transverse section were made
from each animal.

For radioimmunoassay five individual samples were collected for each stage, anesthetised in MS-222 (100ng/mL,
Sigma-Aldrich) and immediately frozen in dry ice.
Total RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted from whole-body metamorphosing larvae and 100 mg of adult halibut tissue using Tri reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's
instructions, quantified in a GeneQuant (Amersham Biosciences) spectrophotometer and stored at -80°C until
use.
Northern Blot
Three micrograms of total RNA obtained from adult halibut white muscle, red muscle, heart and liver where fractioned on a 1.5% agarose/5.5% formaldehyde gel which
was run in 1× MOPS. RNA was transferred to nylon
Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) with
10× SSC overnight and cross-linked using UV light (Stratalinker, Stratagene). Hybridisations were carried out
using 3'UTR probe prepared from each cloned halibut
TnT gene (~10 µg) by digestion for 2 hours at 37°C with
10U of appropriate restriction enzyme (Promega) and 1×
buffer (Table 2). The resulting DNA for probes was purified by electrophoresis followed by extraction of DNA
using the GFX gel band extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences).

Individual membranes were hybridized overnight at high
stringency (65°C in 6×SSC, 5× Denharts solution, 100 µg/
mL tRNA and 0.1%SDS) with its respective 32P-dCTPlabeled halibut TnT probe. The membranes were then
washed twice for 30 minutes at room temperature (1×SSC
and 0.1%SDS) followed by two 30 minute high stringency washes (65°C in 1×SSC and 0.1%SDS) and exposed
at -80°C to Biomax MS film (Kodac, USA).
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of TnT expression
during halibut metamorphosis
In order to determine expression of halibut TnT genes during metamorphosis a semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay was
developed. For that, 0.5 µg of total RNA were DNased
with the Ambion DNA Free kit (Ca, USA), according to
the manufacturers instruction, and used for first strand
cDNA synthesis which was carried out in a 20 µL volume
using 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH8.3, 0.075 M KCl, 3 mM MgCl2,
0.01 M DTT, 1 mM dNTP, 5 pmol/µl random hexamer

primers, 4U of RNAse inhibitor (Promega, UK) and 10U
of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, UK).
Synthesis reactions were carried out in an iCycler thermocycler (Perkin Elmer) for 10 minutes at 25°C followed by
50 minutes at 42°C and heating for 2 minutes at 70°C terminated synthesis. Five individual cDNA synthesis reactions corresponding to five individual animals per stage
were performed.
Initial RT-PCR amplifications with primers specific for
each halibut TnT gene were conducted to determine optimal cycle number and ensure that amplification occurred
in the logarithmic phase of the reaction. The expression of
18s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was used as an internal standard for normalisation.
RT-PCR analysis of halibut TnT genes was carried out in a
25 µl reaction volume containing ~20 ng of cDNA for
each sample and 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dNTP's, 1 pmol/
µl of halibut specific TnT gene forward and reverse primer
(Table 3) and 0.6U Taq polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich).
Primers for all the halibut TnT genes analysed were
selected to amplify the entire N-terminal region, which in
terrestrial vertebrates [4] and sea bream [5,6] undergoes
alternative splicing. The forward primer was located in the
5'UTR region of the isolated halibut TnT cDNAs. The
reverse primer was designed in a constitutively expressed
region of the halibut TnT cDNAs.
The PCR reactions were performed in an iCycler (Perkin
Elmer) thermocycler, using the following cycle; 1 minute
at 95°C followed by 27 cycles, for fTnThh and sTnT2hh, or
28 cycles, for AfTnThh of; 30 seconds at 95°C, 1 minute at
56°C and 30 seconds at 72°C, followed by a final step of
1 minute at 72°C. Negative reactions without sample
cDNA were also performed.

Amplification of the housekeeping gene 18s rRNA used
for normalisation was carried out as described above
using 1 pmol/µl of forward and reverse primer (5'-TCAAGAACGAAAGTCGGAGG-3' and 5'-GGACATCTAAGGGCATCACA-3' respectively). The thermocycle utilised
was: 1 minute at 95°C followed by 16 cycles of 30 seconds
at 95°C, 1 minute at 56°C and 30 seconds at 72°C, followed by a final step of 1 minute at 72°C. All RT-PCR
reaction products were fractionated on 2.5% agarose gels
and analysed by densitometry using LabWorks software,
version 4.5 (Ultra-Violet Products Cambridge, UK).
Results are expressed as the mean and standard error of
five independent samples.
In situ hybridisation
The developmental ontogeny of halibut muscle was characterised using 5 µm post-anal transverse section from
several larvae from each stage. Several sections per fish
were dewaxed, rehydrated and stained using haematoxylin and eosin and mounted in DPX reagent (SigmaAldrich).

The spatial-temporal expression pattern of halibut fTnT
gene, and its efTnT isoform, sTnT2 and AfTnThh in metamorphosing halibut larvae and post-metamorphosed
juveniles was investigated by in situ hybridisation using
specific digoxygenin riboprobes. For fTnThh gene expression a 582 bp riboprobe for the conserved 3'UTR region
in all fTnThh isoforms was generated. The expression of
efTnThh isoform was established by generating a riboprobe complementary to the embryonic/larval exon (aa
12 to 68). AfTnThh gene expression was established using
a 641 bp riboprobe complementary to the constitutive 3'
coding region and the 3'UTR of the AfTnThh cDNA. Riboprobes were generated by linearising AfTnThh cDNA
clones with the appropriate restriction enzyme for 1.5 h at
37°C and isolating the linearised vector by phenol (pH 8)
extraction and precipitation in 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5)
and ethanol overnight at -20°C.
Specific riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription using the linearized vector as template and was carried out using 20U of T7 RNA polymerase or SP6 RNA
polymerase in the case of efTnThh, in transcription buffer
(Promega) with 1 µl of digoxigenin-RNA labelling mix
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), for 1.5 h at 37
°C. The reaction was stopped with 2 µl of 0.2 M EDTA.
The digoxygenin labelled riboprobes were purified by lithium precipitation and ressuspended in 25 µl of water.
Riboprobe purity and concentration were determined by
fractionation of reaction products on an agarose gel
(1.5%). To assess potential cross hybridization between
probes and target sequences dot blots were performed.
Each digoxygenin labeled riboprobe was hybridized with
all the halibut TnT target sequence, no cross hybridization

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/71

reactions were detected and each probe was found to be
specific for its target template.
For in situ hybridisation experiments adjacent transverse
tissue sections of halibut larvae were dewaxed, rehydrated
and then prehybridised at 58°C for 2 h in hybridisation
solution without probe (50% formamide, 4× SSC, 1 mg
ml-1 torula RNA, 0.1 mg ml-1 heparin, 1× Denhardt's,
0.04% CHAPS). Tissues were then hybridised overnight in
a humidified box at 58°C in 100 µl per section of hybridisation solution containing approximately 2 ng µl-1 of the
riboprobes. Control sections were pretreated with RNase
prior to hybridization with riboprobes or the riboprobes
were excluded from the hybridizations.
Stringency washes were 3 × 5 min at 58°C with 2× SSC
and 5 min at 58°C in 1× SSC. Tissue sections were then
washed 2× 5 min with 2× SSC:0.12% CHAPS at RT, followed by a wash for 5 min in 2× SSC:PTW (1:1, v/v) and
finally 5 min in PTW. Blocking was performed by incubation in blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) with 10% heat inactivated sheep serum, detection
of hybridised probe was carried out using sheep anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase (AP) Fab fragments (1/
600) (Roche, Lisbon, Portugal). The chromagens for colour detection were NBT (4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride) and BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro 3-indolylphosphate)
and colour development was carried out over 2 h at 38°C.
Stained sections from in situ hybridisation were rinsed in
PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% formaldehyde at room temperature, rinsed in PBS and mounted in glycerol gelatine.
Histological and in situ sections were analysed using a
microscope (Olympus BH2) coupled to a digital camera
(Olympus DP11) linked to a computer for digital image
analysis.
Radioimmunoassay for thyroid hormones
Larval extracts were used to assess T4 and T3 content of
whole larvae by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using a doubleantibody method under equilibrium conditions.

Frozen larvae (n = 8 per stage) were extracted individually
in 50 µl methanol, 200 µl chloroform and 100 µl barbital
buffer, centrifuged (3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C) and the
upper phase removed, lyophilized, reconstituted in assay
buffer, heat denatured (75°C for 2 hours) and assayed.
Standard curves were prepared with T4 or T3 standards
(Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 0.1N NaOH and diluted to
appropriate concentrations in assay buffer. T3 and T4
assays were conducted in barbital buffer (0.07 M, pH 8.6)
and Tris buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), respectively, and contained 0.1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide. In both RIA,
either 100 µl of standard or larval extract was added. For
both hormones, the total assay volume was 300 µl and

BMC Developmental Biology 2007, 7:71

included 100 µl of 125I-T3 (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) or 125I-T4 and 100 µl T3 antisera
(1:15,000, Sigma-Aldrich) or T4 antisera (1:10,000,
Sigma-Aldrich). Antisera were added to all tubes apart
from those to determine total count (cpm) and non-specific binding. The T3 and the T4 assays were incubated for
16–24 h at 4°C and subsequently, the free hormone was
separated from the bound hormone using precipitation
with a second antibody [70].
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed in
order to establish if significant differences in the concentration of T4 or T3 were detected between different metamorphic stages. If the two-way ANOVA detected
significant differences in T4 or T3 between stages the
Holm-Sidak (HSM) multiple comparison analysis was
performed to determine which stages have different T4 or
T3 levels. Both T4 and T3 concentration values were transformed using the logarithmic function before statistical
analysis. Significance was considered if p < 0.05. All statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat version 3
software (SPSS Corp.)
T4 treatment and halibut TnT expression
Pre-metamorphic halibut larvae (stage 5) were treated for
10 days with T4 (Sigma-Aldrich). The halibut larvae were
maintained in 100 L vessels with sea water at 10.5°C. The
waterflow was kept at around 0,3 l/min, with the oxygen
level at full saturation and disinfected clay dissolved in
water was put in the tanks prior to each feeding to shade
the environment and ensure maximum feed uptake and
the right distribution of light in the tanks.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/71

iments and animals collection were performed in accordance with EU legislation for Animal Welfare.
RT-PCR for fTnThh, AfTnThh, sTnT2hh and 18s rRNA was
performed with the primers and conditions described previously. Results are presented as the ratio between the
gene of interest and 18s. Results are presented as the mean
expression of fTnThh, AfTnThh and sTnT2hh of four individual larvae from control and T4 treated groups. Oneway ANOVA was performed to determine if statistically
significant differences in halibut TnT gene expression
occurred between control and T4-treated animals. If oneway ANOVA gave significant differences between the control and the T4-treated group in any of the halibut TnT
genes analysed a multiple comparison test was performed
using the Holm-Sidak multiple comparison test (HSD).
All statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat version 3 software (SPSS Corp.) and significance was considered at p < 0.05.

The hormone (T4) was administered by feeding the larvae
T4-enriched artemia and control animals were fed with
unenriched artemia. In order to enrich the artemia a solution (1 mg/ml) of sodium-pentahydrate salt of thyroxin
(3-(4-(hydroxy-3,5-diiodophenoxy)-3,5-diiodophenyl)Lalanine, Sigma T2501) was prepared in distilled water.
Artemia was enriched using 1 ml of T4 stock per liter of
artemia (each liter containing 300.000 artemia naupli).
T4-enriched artemia was fed to the larvae in the afternoon
(2/3 of the total feedings) but in the morning the larvae
were fed regular artemia (only 1/3 of the total feedings).
The experiment lasted for 10 days. Samples of the artemia
were taken and RIA for T4 was performed to validate the
uptake of T4 by the artemia which contained a T4 concentration of 2 µg T4/g artemia.
At the end of the experiment animals were anesthetized
with MS-222 (Sigma-Aldrich) and immediately fixed in
RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich) and kept at -20°C until analysis. Four individual treated and control larvae were used
