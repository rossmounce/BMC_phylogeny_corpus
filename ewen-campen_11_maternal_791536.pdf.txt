Abstract
Background: Most evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo”) studies of emerging model organisms focus
on small numbers of candidate genes cloned individually using degenerate PCR. However, newly available
sequencing technologies such as 454 pyrosequencing have recently begun to allow for massive gene discovery in
animals without sequenced genomes. Within insects, although large volumes of sequence data are available for
holometabolous insects, developmental studies of basally branching hemimetabolous insects typically suffer from
low rates of gene discovery.
Results: We used 454 pyrosequencing to sequence over 500 million bases of cDNA from the ovaries and embryos
of the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, which lacks a sequenced genome. This indirectly developing insect
occupies an important phylogenetic position, branching basal to Diptera (including fruit flies) and Hymenoptera
(including honeybees), and is an experimentally tractable model for short-germ development. 2,087,410 reads from
both normalized and non-normalized cDNA assembled into 21,097 sequences (isotigs) and 112,531 singletons. The
assembled sequences fell into 16,617 unique gene models, and included predictions of splicing isoforms, which we
examined experimentally. Discovery of new genes plateaued after assembly of ~1.5 million reads, suggesting that
we have sequenced nearly all transcripts present in the cDNA sampled. Many transcripts have been assembled at
close to full length, and there is a net gain of sequence data for over half of the pre-existing O. fasciatus
accessions for developmental genes in GenBank. We identified 10,775 unique genes, including members of all
major conserved metazoan signaling pathways and genes involved in several major categories of early
developmental processes. We also specifically address the effects of cDNA normalization on gene discovery in
de novo transcriptome analyses.
Conclusions: Our sequencing, assembly and annotation framework provide a simple and effective way to achieve
high-throughput gene discovery for organisms lacking a sequenced genome. These data will have applications to
the study of the evolution of arthropod genes and genetic pathways, and to the wider evolution, development
and genomics communities working with emerging model organisms.

Background
New and emerging model organisms occupy an increasingly important part of the developmental biology and
developmental genetics research landscape. While studying a huge diversity of animals has long been the norm
in the classical fields of experimental embryology and

functional morphology [see for example [1-3]], the
molecular biology revolution and the advent of the
“model system” concept [4] created demand for a small
number of highly genetically manipulable organisms
that could be intensively studied [5]. Research on these
“big six” [sensu 6] genetic model organisms has led to
enormous advances in our understanding of general
principles of embryogenesis. However, placing these
general principles in an evolutionary context requires
broader taxonomic sampling. Many researchers have

highlighted the need for developing new model organisms for specific comparative, evolutionary and ecological questions [6-8]. It has also been suggested, however,
that the single gene expression approach of the last several decades of evolutionary developmental biology
("evo-devo”) has outlived its usefulness, and that what
are needed are not more model organisms, but rather a
smaller number of groups chosen for the ability to functionally manipulate genes [9,10]. Sophisticated gene
expression techniques and even stable germline transgenesis have been developed in a large array of models
outside of the “big six” [see for example [11,12]]. The
ancient history of the small RNA processing machinery
[13,14] means that gene knockdown is a feasible goal
for most organisms, as long as the sequences of genes
of interest are available.
While whole genome sequencing is an increasingly viable
option for some organisms, many new models, particularly
within the arthropods, lack the large community resources
necessary to finance and maintain annotation of a genome.
For these reasons, many researchers studying nontraditional model organisms have turned to Sangersequenced EST libraries [see for example [15,16]]. In
principle this method of gene discovery can lead to highthroughput expression and functional genetic analyses of
multiple genes [see for example [17]]. In practice, however,
most non-traditional organism studies are still subject to a
gene discovery bottleneck. This is largely because at the
scale needed to uncover rare developmental transcripts,
Sanger-based EST sequencing quickly becomes technically
and financially prohibitive for many labs working on organisms with smaller research communities. In addition, those
smaller-scale EST projects that have been carried out are
often not publically available in easily searchable formats,
and their potential contribution to the developmental and
evolutionary biology fields is thus limited.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers comparative
and evolutionary developmental biologists a way to
obtain orders of magnitude more developmental gene
data than ever before, at a fraction of its former cost.
Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of NGS
for identifying SNPs for population studies and gene
sequences for use as phylogenetic markers [18-35].
Unfortunately, the lack of suitable protocols for cDNA
preparation, and of established pipelines for analysis
have left this tool under-utilized by many evo-devo
researchers. Furthermore, according to some estimates
[35], few of these studies have been carried out at a
scale large enough to provide significant recovery of
rare transcripts, and therefore of developmental genes.
Here we present an optimized protocol for synthesizing
cDNA for 454 Titanium pyrosequencing, as well as a
simple workflow for de novo assembly of the data without a reference genome, annotation and analysis of the

dataset, and a demonstration of its utility for comparative developmental genetics.
A large body of literature is dedicated to the development and genomics of holometabolous insects (insects
undergoing complete metamorphosis between embryonic
and adult stages). Tens of holometabolous insect genomes are now available, thanks largely to work on Drosophila melanogaster, other drosophilids, and dipteran
disease vectors [36,37]. In contrast, relatively little is
known about the development of hemimetabolous
insects, which undergo incomplete metamorphosis.
Although several of these insects are amenable to laboratory culture and a variety of experimental manipulations,
molecular developmental studies are scarce, and gene
discovery rates remain low. Notable exceptions among
the Hemiptera are the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum and
the Chagas’ disease vector Rhodnius prolixus, whose genomes are completed and in progress respectively [38,39].
However, the aphid genome has undergone extensive
duplications and gene loss, possibly due to its unusual
reproductive and ecological characteristics [38]. The
mammalian blood feeding needs of R. prolixus make it a
sub-optimal organism for developmental studies.
The milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus (Figure 1A-D)
has emerged as a promising hemipteran system for
studying the molecular development of hemimetabolous
insects [40-42]. It can be reared easily and cheaply in
the laboratory, and has a long history as a laboratory
animal for classical embryology and pattern formation
studies [43-45]. More recently, robust protocols for
in situ hybridization, live imaging of embryogenesis, and
RNAi-mediated gene knockdown have been developed
and successfully applied to the study of the evolution of
development [see for example [46,47]].
Here we present the results of the sequencing and
de novo assembly of the Oncopeltus ovarian and early
embryonic transcriptome. We outline an assembly and
analysis framework using a combination of existing tools
and freely available custom-made command line computational tools, which we hope will make this approach to
gene discovery accessible to comparative developmental
biologists. We identify homologues of genes involved in all
major signaling pathways and developmental processes,
including biologically verified splicing isoforms for some
genes. We also address the need for library normalization
in these studies, and show that at large enough scales of
NGS, large numbers of developmental genes can be discovered even with omission of a normalization step.

stages of embryonic patterning (Figure 1B-D). These
cDNA samples were prepared using a protocol optimized
for preparation of small or limiting samples for 454 pyrosequencing (see Materials and Methods). From these
libraries, we generated a total of 2,087,410 sequence
reads (Table 1). This includes reads generated using GSFLX technology as well as both normalized (N) and nonnormalized (NN) cDNA sequenced using the GS-FLX
Titanium platform. As expected, the reads generated
using GS-FLX Titanium technology were substantially
longer than those generated using GS-FLX technology
(Table 1, Figure 2A). However, the N sample gave an

unexpectedly low number of reads, which were on average shorter than those generated by the NN sample
(Table 1; Figure 2A). Given that a pilot run of one lane
(1/8 plate) of this same normalized cDNA sample generated roughly equal number and size-distribution as a NN
pilot study (Additional file 1), we suspect that a technical
error reduced the sequencing efficiency of this plate.
Despite the comparatively low yield of this normalized
cDNA, it still generated more than 600,000 high quality
reads that we therefore included in subsequent analyses.
We used the cDNA assembly algorithm of Newbler
v2.3 (Roche) to screen the reads for adaptor sequence

Figure 2 Effects of normalization and 454 sequencing chemistry on read length and isotig length. (A) Titanium sequencing chemistry
(grey, black) generally results in longer read lengths when compared with FLX chemistry (white). However, the normalized sample run with
Titanium chemistry (black) had shorter read lengths than the non-normalized sample (grey). This result is likely due to a technical error in that
particular sequencing run, since a 1/8 plate run of the same sample showed a read length distribution comparable to that of the nonnormalized sample (Additional file 1). (B) Isotig length distributions from assemblies of Titanium-sequenced data. The longest isotig per isogroup
is shown. The number of bases in the non-normalized (grey) and normalized (black) samples has been equalized to eliminate possible bias due
to the greater number and length of reads obtained from the run of the normalized sample (see (A)). The isotigs generated from the normalized
cDNA tended to be shorter than those produced by the non-normalized cDNA (see also Table 2). Pooling all FLX and Titanium reads generates
an assembly with more, longer isotigs (blue).

and then assemble the cleaned reads (see Note Added in
Proof for a comparison with Newbler v2.5). After quality
trimming and adapter screening, 2,041,966 reads (97.8%)
were used in the assembly. Of these, 1,773,450 (86.9%)
assembled either wholly or partially into contigs, and
178,770 (8.8%) remained as singletons. The remaining
reads were excluded as either originating from repeat
regions (9,875 reads; 0.05%), outliers (26,943 reads;
1.3%), or too short (<50 base pairs: 52,928 reads; 2.6%).
To our knowledge, Newbler v2.3 and higher are the
only assembly programs that address alternative splicing
and can output multiple isoforms per gene. Newbler
v2.3 explicitly accounts for alternative splicing by creating a hierarchical assembly composed of three elements:
contigs, isotigs, and isogroups. For consistency, we follow their terminology. Contigs are stretches of
assembled reads that are free of branching conflicts. In
other words, contigs can be thought of as exons or sets
of exons that are always co-transcribed. Isotigs represent
a particular continuous path through a set of contigs,
i.e. a transcript. An isogroup is the set of isotigs arising
from the same set of contigs, i.e. a gene. Different isotigs
within an isogroup are thought to represent alternative
isoforms of the same gene. Note that it is possible for
an isogroup to contain only one isotig, and it is also
possible for an isotig to be composed of only one contig.
After the initial Newbler assembly, we noticed substantial redundancy among the singletons. We therefore
subjected the 178,770 unassembled singletons to a secondary assembly with CAP3 [48]. This secondary assembly reduced the number of singletons from 178,770 to
112,531 (28,143 cap3_contigs and 84,388 cap3_singlets).
Thus, in total, our assembly generated a total of 133,628
sequences, including isotigs, cap3_contigs and cap3_singlets (Table 2).
Our data assembled into 22,235 contigs, organized
among 21,097 isotigs (Figure 2B). The isotig N50 length
was 1,735 bp (in other words, 50% of the bases are
incorporated into isotigs ≥ 1,735 bp), and 14,460 (68.5%)
of the isotigs contained only one contig. The 21,097

isotigs fell into 16,617 isogroups, of which 14,562
(87.6%) contain only one isotig (average number of isotigs per isogroup = 1.3).
The average coverage among contigs was 23.2 reads/
bp (median coverage = 6.9 reads/bp) (Additional file 2).
This coverage value is more than twice as high as the
highest reported value from a de novo transcriptome
assembly to date [summarized in [20]]. Such deep coverage should be helpful for overcoming the presence of
insertion/deletion errors in the individual raw reads [49].
To test whether our assembly would have been aided
by the inclusion of nucleotide sequence from Rhodnius
prolixus, the most closely related hemipteran to O. fasciatus whose genome is currently being sequenced [39],
we used the BLASTN algorithm to compare our isotigs
(the longest isotig per isogroup) with the published
ESTs of R. prolixus with an e-value cut-off of 1e-6. Consistent with previous observations of extremely low levels
of conservation between insect genomes [50] we found
that only 53 out of 16,617 isotigs had hits to R. prolixus
ESTs on the nucleotide level. These results suggest that
de novo sequencing and assembling efforts will be necessary for most insect species, even when sequence data are
available for other members of the same order. We note,
however, that a recent study [51] has shown that it may
be possible to incorporate EST data from different species into a de novo assembly by using amino acid
sequence rather than nucleotide sequence.
Validation of predicted alternate isoforms

To examine whether the alternative isoforms predicted
by Newbler v2.3 are in fact present in developing
embryos of O. fasciatus, we first focused on a gene of
particular interest to developmental biologists, nanos.
This conserved metazoan gene was first described as a
loss of function mutation in Drosophila melanogaster
[52], and is necessary for germ cell and posterior somatic
development [reviewed in [53]]. Newbler v2.3 predicted
this gene to encode two alternative isotigs within a single
isogroup (Figure 3B). The two isotigs differ in that the

longer contains an additional 100-bp exon that is absent
from the shorter (Figure 3B). We designed PCR primers
against sequences present in both isotigs (Figure 3B
arrows), which amplified two bands differing by ~100 bp
from a pool of embryonic cDNA (Figure 3C). Sequencing
of these two bands confirmed that they differ exactly as
predicted by Newbler v2.3 (Figure 3D).
Importantly, a previous version of Newbler (v2.0),
which does not account for alternative splicing, failed to
join together the three fragments which were linked by
Newbler v2.3 (Figure 3A). Because of this, Newbler v2.0
(and presumably other assemblers which do not address
branching within contigs) predicted three separate contigs, only one of which could be identified as nanos
with BLASTX, as the others fall in poorly conserved
regions of the gene. Thus, the ability of Newbler2.3 to
handle branching conflicts between reads allows this
program to assemble longer continuous sequences,
which are therefore in turn more easily annotated using
BLAST.

Page 7 of 22

To further characterize the accuracy of Newbler’s predictions of alternative transcript isoforms, we randomly
selected 10 isogroups that contained exactly two alternative isotigs differing by the presence/absence of a single
contig (Additional file 3). As we did for nanos, we
designed primers to flank the region differing between
the two predicted isoforms (Additional file 3A), and performed RT-PCR on O. fasciatus embryonic cDNA. In
eight of ten instances, we observed bands of the predicted sizes following agarose gel electrophoresis (Additional file 3B,C). However, in four of the eight positive
cases, additional, unpredicted bands were present (Additional file 3). In one of the ten cases, we observed two
RT-PCR products, but only one of them was of the predicted size (Additional file 3C, lane 6). Taken together,
these results suggest that Newbler v2.3 has a low rate of
false positives in the prediction of multiple splicing isoforms. Including our investigation of nanos, only one of
11 test cases (9.1%) produced a single RT-PCR product
where Newbler v2.3 had predicted multiple products.

Figure 3 Newbler 2.3 correctly identifies splicing isoforms of nanos. (A) Newbler v2.0 identified three separate contigs that map to an
O. fasciatus nanos homologue that we had previously identified by degenerate PCR (Ewen-Campen & Extavour, unpublished). Newbler v2.0 failed
to identify these contigs as belonging to the same transcript because of branching conflicts amongst the reads joining these contigs. BLASTX
against the RefSeq protein database identified only contig 31035 as being a putative nanos homologue; the other two contigs lie outside the
conserved Nanos domain and obtain no BLAST hits. (B) Newbler v2.3 predicted that the same three contigs identified by Newbler v2.0 belonged to
two isotigs, or splicing isoforms. (C) RT-PCR with specific primers F and R shown in (B) resulted in two bands of the predicted sizes of the isotigs
predicted by Newbler v2.3. (D) Sequencing the bands from (C) revealed that they were identical to the sequences of the predicted isotigs from (B).

Ewen-Campen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/61

However, we observed that roughly half of the time,
Newbler v2.3 failed to predict all of the isoforms identified via RT-PCR.
Transcriptome annotation

A BLASTN search of our dataset for the 93 existing
GenBank accessions for O. fasciatus sequences yielded a
hit result for 56% of the accessions, with an e-value cutoff of 1e-10. This result may be due in part to the short
length of some of the GenBank sequences. Accordingly,
we found that accessions with hits in the database were
significantly longer (mean length 729 bp) than accessions without hits (mean length 397 bp) (unpaired Student’s t-Test: t = 2.89, DF = 91, p = 0.0048). Of greater
relevance to developmental applications of this dataset,
however, was our finding that 85% of O. fasciatus developmental genes with existing GenBank accessions (n =
32) are represented in our transcriptome.
We then used BLASTX to map the 133,628 O. fasciatus sequences (isotigs, cap3_contigs and cap3_singletons) against the entire RefSeq Protein database with an
e-value cut-off of 1e-10. To simplify these statistics, we
report only the BLAST results for the longest isotig per
isogroup, under the assumption that all isotigs within an
isogroup share nearly identical BLAST results. Of
16,617 isotigs, 7,219 (43.4%) had at least one hit. Of the
28,143 cap3_contigs, 2,594 (9.2%) had hits, and of the
84,388 cap3_singlets, 2,367 (2.8%) had hits. These values
are higher than comparable BLAST statistics of most
other published studies of 454-generated de novo transcriptomes [24-26,30,32,33], likely because deeper
sequencing increases the length of assembled sequences
and thereby makes these sequences more likely to be
identified via BLAST. The unidentifiable sequences
likely originate from UTRs or non-conserved portions of
protein-coding sequences. Of the top BLAST hits, 89.3%
were genes from arthropod sequences (Additional file
4). Of the 12,180 O. fasciatus sequences with BLAST
hits, 1,455 hit non-overlapping segments of the same
top BLAST hit (i.e. potentially unassembled portions of
the same transcript), and 825 hit overlapping segments
of the same top BLAST hit (i.e. potential paralogs).
Excluding those 1,455 potentially double-counted
BLAST hits, our transcriptome identified a total of
10,775 genes. The assembled sequences generated in
this study, as well as pre-computed BLAST results, are
available as flat files from the authors upon request.
To explore and summarize the functional categories of
the genes sequenced in this study, we obtained the Gene
Ontology (GO) terms associated with the top 20 BLAST
hits of each sequence using Blast2GO [54]. Among the
7,059 genes for which we obtained GO terms, we
observed a wide diversity of functional categories represented on all levels of the Gene Ontology database

Page 8 of 22

(Figure 4). The O. fasciatus sequences fall into GO categories with a roughly similar distribution to that of the
well-annotated Drosophila melanogaster genome, suggesting that our sequence data contain a large diversity
of genes involved in a variety of biological processes,
and do not contain any notable biases towards particular
categories of genes.
Assessing coverage of the O. fasciatus transcriptome

We wished to know how thoroughly our sequencing
efforts sampled the true diversity of transcripts present
in our cDNA samples. This is a two-part question: first,
of the genes truly expressed during O. fasciatus oogenesis and embryogenesis, how many did we identify? And
second, of these identified genes, how thoroughly had
we assembled their full-length transcripts?
To address the first question, we created eight separate assemblies of progressively larger sub-samples of
our total reads and tallied the total number of genes
identified via BLASTX. The number of newly discovered
genes began to plateau after ~1.5M reads (1 7/8 plates
in our case) (Figure 5 black line). However, the N50 isotig length continued to increase roughly linearly over
this range of reads (Figure 5 grey line). These results
suggest that additional sequencing of this sample is unlikely to identify substantially more genes, but may continue to lengthen the existing sequences. Although in
the absence of a sequenced genome it is not possible to
accurately estimate how many genes are in fact present
in the O. fasciatus transcriptome, we note that while
several developmental genes of interest were identified
in this study, others were not. (Tables 3, 4 and see
below). Because these data suggest that we have
sequenced these specific cDNA samples quite deeply,
some form of specific target enrichment may be necessary for future attempts to discover additional genes not
identified in this dataset.
To address the second question, we employed a
method proposed by O’Neil and colleagues [20] for
addressing the question of how closely our sequences
approached full-length transcripts. Their metric, the
“ortholog hit ratio,” compares the length of the newly
discovered sequence that obtains a BLAST hit versus
the full length of its top hit [20]. Thus, an ortholog hit
ratio of one implies that a transcript has been assembled
to its true full length, while values over one suggest
insertions in the query sequence relative to its top
BLAST hit. We note the caveat that many genes contain
relatively poorly conserved regions that may fail to
obtain a BLAST hit at all, causing the ortholog hit ratio
to be an underestimate in these cases (Additional file 5).
In our dataset, many of the O. fasciatus isotigs appear
to be nearly fully assembled, while the singletons predictably tend to represent small portions of their top

Figure 4 GO term distribution of BLAST hits from the O. fasciatus transcriptome compared with those from the D. melanogaster
genome. Several GO categories are shown within the top-level divisions of Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component.
Column heights reflect the percentage of annotated sequences in each assembly that mapped to a given Biological Process GO term. The
relative percentages of genes falling into GO categories are comparable between our O. fasciatus transcriptome (black) and the D. melanogaster
transcriptome (white).

BLAST hit in RefSeq (Figure 6). In total, of the 7,219
isotigs with BLAST hits, 3,953 (54.8%) had ratios > 0.5
and 2,689 (37.2%) had ratios > 0.8.
We also asked, for those O. fasciatus sequences of
developmental genes already present in GenBank that
overlapped with transcriptome hits (n = 23), whether
our transcriptome data provided any net gain in transcript sequence compared to the GenBank accession
sequence. In 15/23 cases (68%), the transcriptome data
extended the known sequence beyond that reported in
GenBank by an average of 349 bp (range: 82-1,366 bp).
In most cases, additional 3’ sequence was obtained
(Figure 7).
Assessing the value of cDNA normalization

Reducing the representation of highly abundant transcripts (i.e. normalizing the cDNA) is often considered

essential to capture sequence from genes expressed at
lower levels, including many important developmental
genes [see for example [55-57]]. However, we hypothesized that current next-generation sequencing technologies could provide sufficiently deep sequence to render
normalization largely unnecessary for construction of
de novo transcriptomes for comparative developmental
biologists. To address this question, we assessed the
relative contribution of the N and NN cDNA to our
final assembly using several strategies.
First, to test whether our normalization protocol successfully reduced the presence of highly abundant transcripts, we created separate assemblies from the N and
NN cDNA samples (equalizing the total number of
bases to reduce the contribution of additional sequence
found in the NN sample). The N assembly contained a
greater number of isotigs that were shorter on average

Figure 5 Assessing coverage of the O. fasciatus transcriptome.
Randomly chosen subsets of increasing numbers of Titanium reads
were used to generate progressively larger sub-assemblies. The
number of reads in each sub-assembly (X axis) is plotted against the
number of unique BLAST hits in each sub-assembly (left Y axis:
black), and against the N50 isotig length (right Y axis: grey). For this
analysis BLAST was performed against the SwissProt database. The
number of unique BLAST hits plateaus when the assembly is
composed of approximately 1.5 million reads. However, the N50
isotig length maintains an approximately constant rate of increase.

than those in the NN assembly (Figure 2B). Additionally,
more singletons were generated in the N assembly relative to the NN assembly (Table 2). Further, similar to
the results obtained by Bellin and colleagues [27], we
observed the predicted decrease in the maximum number of reads per contig in the N assembly compared to
the NN assembly (Figure 8A, B), demonstrating that the
normalization procedure successfully reduced the
sequencing of highly abundant transcripts. These statistics, which could be interpreted to suggest that the N
reads generated an inferior assembly, may result from
the shorter average length of reads in the N sample
(Figure 2A). Indeed, Newbler rejected 7.9% (30,780) of
the N reads as too short, compared to only 1% (3,935)
of the NN reads. However, these assembly statistics
could also indicate greater heterogeneity in the N sample, which would suggest that normalization might
increase the number of new genes identified.
To discriminate between these possibilities, we
explored the contribution of the N and NN reads to the
genes discovered in our full assembly. We used
BLASTN to map one plate’s worth of raw reads from
the N sample and from the NN sample (equalized to
contain the same number of base pairs) against the
complete assembled transcriptome, with an e-value cutoff of 1e-4. We then explored the GO annotation of
those genes hit exclusively by only one of these two
samples. We observed similar overall GO term distributions between the N and NN samples (Figure 8C). We
found that a small number of GO terms (n = 20) were

Page 10 of 22

significantly differentially represented in the two samples, albeit generally with very few sequences in each
GO term (Additional file 6). For example, we were surprised to see that three of the four terms statistically
over-represented in the N sample were related to ribosome function (14/750 (1.9%) of the N hits were annotated with ‘ribosomal subunit’, compared to 1/1124
(0.09%) NN hits; FDR-corrected p-value = 0.006). In
contrast, several terms related to active transmembrane
transport were over-represented in the NN sample
(Additional file 6) possibly indicating that normalization
may have reduced the representation of genes involved
in certain basic metabolic processes.
As an additional way to investigate the contribution of
the N and NN samples to identifying specific genes of
interest for our studies, we manually examined the
results of mapping the N and NN samples to the fully
assembled transcriptome. Of the 79 genes of interest that
we investigated, four (5.1%) were uniquely present in the
N sample, whereas nine (11.4%) were uniquely present in
the NN sample, and the remaining 66 (83.6%) were present in reads of both the N and NN samples (Tables 3,
4). Although this may be an artifact of sequencing depth
(i.e. low-abundance genes of interest may be present in
only one of the two cDNA samples simply due to sampling effects rather than the normalization protocol per
se), our data suggest that the normalized cDNA sample
did not contribute disproportionately to gene discovery.
Gene discovery for developmental studies

The ultimate goal of this sequencing project was to
identify a wide diversity of candidate genes involved in
developmental processes. Traditionally, such gene discovery in “non-model” organisms has required degenerate PCR, which is labor-intensive, expensive, and prone
to failure. The annotated transcriptome assembly we
present here allows researchers to identify genes of
interest via simple text searches, or via BLAST searches.
To demonstrate the usefulness of these data for largescale gene discovery, we report here the identification of
several components from each of the seven widely studied metazoan signaling pathways (Table 3) as well as
many genes involved in specific developmental processes
(Table 4). We note that the majority of these gene fragments are of suitable length for immediate application
of such widely used techniques as in situ hybridization
and RNAi-based functional knockdown. In cases of
functional experiments where full-length proteins are
desirable, such as protein overexpression, RACE PCR
will likely be required. Importantly, we note that many
genes of interest were present among the singletons,
many of which are long enough for immediate use as
sequences for in situ hybridization probes or RNAi

templates, emphasizing the importance of including
these in NGS gene discovery studies.
Although we identified a diverse array of genes, some
well-studied genes known to be expressed during
embryogenesis were not easily identified in this study.
For example, our BLAST results only contained three
genes from the Hox cluster (fushi tarazu, Antennapedia,
and Abdominal-B), although orthologs of all the canonical arthropod Hox genes are known to be present in O.
fasciatus [58]. However, using the O. fasciatus Hox gene
sequence fragments available from NCBI as a BLAST
query against our transcriptome did reveal sequences
for all Hox genes except Sex combs reduced. It is

possible that these genes are expressed at very low levels
during the developmental stages sampled here, suggesting that enrichment techniques may be necessary to
more easily identify certain genes of interest. We do
note, however, that fushi tarazu, the only Hox cluster
gene not previously identified in O. fasciatus, was identified in both N and NN samples of this transcriptome
dataset (Table 4).

with that of JH esterase and JH binding proteins, is consistent with previous studies implicating tight control of JH
during embryogenesis [63].

Figure 6 Ortholog hit ratio analysis of isotigs and CAP3reassembled singletons. An ortholog hit ratio of one implies that
a transcript has been assembled to its true full length. For isotigs
(black), a majority (54.8%) appear to contain at least 50% of the full
length transcript sequence (arrow), while over one-third (37.2%)
appear to represent at least 80% of the full length transcript
sequence (arrowhead). Most singletons (grey) represent much
smaller percentages of full-length transcripts.

processes, we asked whether we could also identify genes
known to be employed in biological processes during postembryonic development of holometabolous insects. Recent
studies have suggested that many of the genes used during
holometabolous insect metamorphosis may also play
important roles during embryogenesis in hemimetabolous
insects [59,60]. To investigate this, we searched the O. fasciatus transcriptome for expression of key ecdysteroidand juvenile hormone (JH)-related genes. We identified
transcripts for many of the known ecdysteroid biosynthesis
genes, including cytochrome P450 genes encoded by the
Drosophila Halloween family, such as shade (CYP314A1),
shadow (CYP315A1), phantom (CYP306A1) and disembodied (CYP302A1) (Table 4). We also detected expression
of ecdysone response genes. In particular, we identified
many of the ecdysone-regulated genes that play key roles
during molting and metamorphosis, including E75, HR3,
and HR4 (Table 4). The presence of these genes in the
ovaries and early embryos of O. fasciatus corroborates
recent studies that implicate ecdysone-response genes in
key developmental processes during embryogenesis
[59-61]. As might be expected for a situation where ecdysone regulates embryonic development but not molting,
transcripts encoding insect peptide hormones implicated
in eclosion behavior, such as ecdysis-triggering hormone,
eclosion hormone and crustacean cardioactive peptide,
were not detected. JH biosynthesis and response genes
were also isolated (Table 4). JH has been shown to play a
role in promoting embryonic development and tissue
maturation [62]. The expression of these genes, together

Conclusions
We have used 454 pyrosequencing to create an early
developmental transcriptome for the milkweed bug
O. fasciatus in the absence of a reference genome.
Although genomic sequence data will be necessary in
the future for linkage or cis-regulatory analyses, at the
early stages of establishing new model organisms, one of
the most important goals is often gene discovery. In this
regard, while no transcriptome generated in this way
can realistically be “complete” in the sense of containing
full length transcripts for all expressed genes, we propose that for many evolutionary developmental biology
studies, the approach described here is a useful one for
fast, high-throughput gene discovery. A high priority for
comparative developmental biology research is gene
expression and function analyses. By sequencing at great
depth and testing a variety of cDNA preparation methods (normalized, non-normalized, embryo- and ovaryspecific), we have generated tens of thousands of gene
sequences of sufficient lengths for the commonly used
developmental techniques of in situ hybridization and
RNAi-mediated gene knockdown. These data can also
be used for phylogenetic, population genetic, and functional genomic applications, provide a starting point for
identification of genomic regulatory sequences, and
assist with assembly of hemipteran genomes sequenced
in the future.
Note added in Proof

While this article was in review, Kumar and Blaxter [64]
published a comparison of de novo assemblers for 454
transcriptome data, and reported important shortcomings of Newbler v2.3 compared to other available assemblers. Specifically, the authors reported that Newbler
v2.3 produced the smallest assembly (i.e. the smallest
number of base pairs incorporated into contigs) of the
assemblers tested. The authors argue that this poor performance is likely because Newbler v2.3 inexplicably discards portions of read overlap information. In contrast,
a newer, currently unreleased version of Newbler, v2.5,
produced the most complete assembly of all those
tested. Kumar and Blaxter (2010) therefore strongly
advise all de novo 454 transcriptome assembly projects
which have used Newbler v2.3 to recompute their
assemblies with Newbler v2.5.
To address this concern, we obtained a pre-release
version of Newbler v2.5 from Roche and reassembled
the O. fasciatus data, again using the -nosplit flag. In
contrast to Kumar and Blaxter (2010), we observed
much less dramatic differences between the assemblies

Figure 7 The O. fasciatus transcriptome adds sequence data to existing GenBank accessions, which in turn improves annotation of
transcriptome sequences. (A) Extended contig for Of-hunchback (bottom), comprising the complete mRNA GenBank accession (top, light grey), two
isotigs and one CAP3 contig from the transcriptome (middle, dark grey). The largest isotig provides an additional 252 bp of 3’ UTR sequence to the
GenBank sequence (black). Comparison with the GenBank sequence enabled isotig 08619 and cap3_contig 21314 to be assembled into the same contig.
(B) Extended contig for Of-homothorax (bottom), with a partial mRNA GenBank accession (top, light grey) and two transcriptome isotigs (middle, dark
grey). Both isotigs extend beyond the known GenBank sequence at the 3’ and 5’ ends, extending the known region by 449 bp in total (black). Both
isotigs had been identified as homothorax, and because they did not overlap, they were classified as belonging to the same transcript rather than being
paralogs. The GenBank sequence bridges an 87 bp gap between the isotigs, confirming that both sequences are fragments of a single gene.

produced by Newbler v2.3 and Newbler v2.5 (Additional file 7). For example, Kumar and Blaxter (2010)
report that Newbler v2.5 increased their total assembly
size by 39% compared to Newbler v2.3. For the O. fasciatus data analyzed here, Newbler v2.5 increased the
total assembly size by less than 1% (Additional file 7).
Further, we observed very similar numbers of isogroups, isotigs, and singletons between the two assemblies (Additional file 7). We did observe a 16% increase
in the number of contigs reported by Newbler v2.5,
but this difference was markedly less than the 80%
increase observed in the data analyzed by Kumar and
Blaxter (2010). After BLASTing all of the assembled
isotigs and cap3-assembled singletons against the
RefSeq database, we identified a total of 10,886 unique

BLAST hits, compared to 10,775 genes identified using
Newbler v2.3.
These results suggest that, although we did observe a
modest increase in assembly size using Newbler v2.5,
the analyses presented in the current study are largely
robust against differences between currently available
versions of Newbler. One possible explanation for the
difference between these results and those observed by
Kumar and Blaxter (2010), is the greater sequencing
depth performed in the current study. If in fact the poor
performance of Newbler v2.3 involves discarding information in regions of low coverage, the fact that our
dataset includes ~2.4x more reads than that analyzed by
Kumar and Blaxter (2010) may explain the reduced
improvement that Newbler v2.5 provided our dataset.

Figure 8 Normalization decreases coverage of highly abundant genes, but does not change the GO term distribution of contigs. In
both samples, most contigs are composed of <102 reads. However, the non-normalized sample (A) contains contigs with many more reads per
contigs than the normalized sample (B). In other words, normalization preferentially decreases the number of reads of those contigs with the
most reads. (C) GO term distributions do not differ dramatically between pyrosequenced libraries of N versus NN cDNA. However, see Additional
file 6 for exceptions. Column heights reflect the percentage of annotated sequences in each assembly that mapped to a given GO term. Note
that the GO terms shown represent the results of mapping the N and NN reads against the complete assembly, rather than those obtained via
independent assemblies of N and NN reads.

We also suggest that the reduced number of genes identified via BLAST observed by Kumar and Blaxter (their
Table five) may result from the fact that the authors
excluded singletons from their analyses. If Newbler v2.3
indeed fails to assemble regions of low coverage and
instead retains those reads as singletons, many genes of
interest may only be present as singletons. Indeed, we
observed many genes of interest exclusively represented

as singletons (Tables 3 and 4). Thus, for the purpose of
gene discovery, we emphasize that future de novo transcriptome projects should analyze singletons as an
important source of useful gene sequence.
Although our results do not appear to be greatly sensitive to which version of Newbler is used, we agree
with Kumar and Blaxter (2010) that future transcriptome project should use utilize the most current

Ewen-Campen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:61

available version of Newbler, or whichever assembler
algorithm they find most useful for their data.

Methods
Animal culture

The O. fasciatus specimens sequenced in this study were
originally purchased from the Carolina Biological Supply
Company (Burlington, NC) and were maintained in the
laboratory on sunflower seeds under a 12h:12h light/
dark cycle at 28°C.
cDNA Synthesis

For our pilot study using the GS-FLX platform, total
RNA was isolated from mature ovaries (Figure 1B) and
from mixed-stage embryos representing the first three
days of development (roughly 60% of embryogenesis at
28°C; Figure 1C, D) using TRIzol (Invitrogen), following
the manufacturer’s protocols. For each RNA sample,
approximately 5 μg of cDNA was prepared using the
SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech, CA,
USA). The cDNA was normalized using Evrogen’s Trimmer-Direct cDNA Normalization kit (Evrogen, Moscow,
Russia), and subsequently digested with SfiI to partially
remove the SMART adapters. The size distributions of
total RNA and cDNA were assessed on 1.0% agarose
gels following each step of the protocol.
To prepare cDNA for sequencing on the GS-FLX
Titanium platform, we followed a modified version of
the SMART cDNA protocol [65] that has been optimized for cDNA quality and yield from small quantities
of total RNA. A helpful guide that formed the initial
basis for the optimization of this protocol was once
available online from Evrogen, but has since been
removed. At the time these libraries were prepared,
Roche had not yet provided a specific protocol for
cDNA library preparation for 454 pyrosequencing. Subsequently, the company has released a cDNA protocol
that requires approximately 500 ng of purified mRNA
(typically requiring isolation of 10 to 50 μg of total
RNA). While useful for larger tissue samples, the Roche
cDNA preparation protocol is difficult to apply to samples in which RNA quantity is limiting, as is the case
with many non-model organisms. The protocol we present here does not require the loss-prone step of mRNA
purification, and we have found that it produces sufficient quantities of high-quality cDNA when 5 μl of the
RNA (18S and 28S bands) can be visualized on a 1%
agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Compared
with the original SMART protocol, we have optimized
the primers, PCR conditions, and downstream purification steps to maximize the yield of double-stranded
cDNA required for 454 pyrosequencing. We initially
optimized this protocol for Roche’s original 454 library
preparation protocol (not specific to cDNA), which

Page 17 of 22

required input of double-stranded DNA amounts of 2.510 μg (in our experience, typically 10-20 μg prepared
cDNA as measured by UV absorbance). However, newer
protocols from Roche require only 500 ng doublestranded cDNA, limiting the need for a secondary
amplification step, as described here, for samples with
highly limiting quantities of total RNA.
After separately isolating total RNA from mature ovaries (Figure 1B) and from each of the first three days of
embryogenesis (Figure 1C, D) as described above, each
RNA sample was treated with DNAse to remove potential genomic contamination. Equal amounts of each
sample were then pooled for use as a template for first
strand cDNA synthesis. Due to concerns that the poly
(T) primer used in the SMART kit could interfere with
pyrosequencing, the 3’-primer used was modified in two
ways: (1) the poly(T) was interrupted every fourth base
by the inclusion of a cytosine [sensu 30]; and (2) the
primer contained an MmeI site which allowed most of
the poly(T) to be removed during digestion. This 3’-primer (PD243Mme-30TC, 5’-ATT CTA GAG CGC ACC
TTG GCC TCC GAC TTT TCT TTT CTT TTT TTT
TCT TTT TTT TTT VN-3’) was used during first
strand synthesis and for all subsequent amplification
steps. Because MmeI also cleaves relatively commonly
within eukaryotic genes, it may not always be desirable
to use this enzyme for library preparation. As an alternative, we have additionally found that a similar 3’ primer containing an SfiI cleavage site (PD243-30TC, 5’ATT CTA GAG GCC ACC TTG GCC GAC ATG TTT
TCT TTT CTT TTT TTT TCT TTT TTT TTT VN-3’)
is also effective in producing cDNA that yields highquality 454 data (data not shown).
For first-strand synthesis, 3 μg of total RNA (in 6 μl)
and 2 μl 3’ primer (12 μM) were mixed and denatured
at 65°C for 5 minutes, then placed on ice. Reverse transcription reactions using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) in
the manufacturer’s recommended buffer were performed
for 50 minutes at 42°C using twice the recommended
concentration of enzyme, 1 μl of Protector RNAse inhibitor (Roche) to avoid RNA degradation, 2 μl 5’ primer
(12 μM), 2 μl 10 mM DTT, and 1 μl 10 mM dNTPs.
Template-switching essential for the SMART technique
was achieved using a 5’ primer (PD242, 5’-AAG CAG
TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA GTG GCC ACG AAG
GCC rGrGrG-3’) with three RNA nucleotides at its 3’
end, which contains an SfiI site. Reactions were then
heat-inactivated for 15 minutes at 70°C and diluted 1:5
in milliQ water in preparation for PCR amplification.
Contrary to some expectations, SuperScript III reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) may be substituted in this protocol with equivalent results (data not shown).
To maximize yield during cDNA amplification, the
first round of amplification was conducted using a 2:2:1

Ewen-Campen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/61

mix (v:v:v) of Hemo KlenTaq (New England Biolabs),
Phusion (New England Biolabs), and PfuTurbo (Stratagene) polymerases. This mixture of enzymes was determined empirically to provide the highest yield of cDNA
with a range of input first-strand concentrations.
Cesium KlenTaq AC (DNA Polymerase Technologies)
and the hot start versions of Phusion and PfuTurbo
polymerases in the same ratio may be also substituted at
this step without sacrificing yield; this may produce
fewer PCR artifacts in the final cDNA preparation. Buffer conditions (MgCl2 and DMSO) were also empirically
optimized to maximize yield and minimize PCR artifacts. Reactions were performed in 100 μL total volume
in 1X Phusion HF buffer, 1.5 μL polymerase mix, 5 μL
first-strand cDNA (previously diluted 1:5 in H2O), 1 μL
3’ primer (PD243Mme-30TC, 12 μM), 1 μL 5’ primer
(PCRIIA, 5’-AAG CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA
GT-3’, 12 μM), and a final concentration of 1% DMSO,
1.5 mM MgCl2 (in addition to the MgCl2 already present in the HF buffer), and 200 μM dNTPs. Reactions
were cycled with the following program: 1 minute at
95°C, followed by 16-20 cycles of 30 seconds at 95°C
(see below for determining optimal number of cycles),
30 seconds at 66°C, and 3 minutes at 72°C, and a final
10 minutes at 72°C. After cooling to room temperature,
10 μL 3M NaOAc pH 5.5 was added to each 100 μL
secondary PCR reaction followed by purification with
the QiaQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) using the
manufacturer’s recommended protocol. For all purification steps, samples were eluted with TM buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 1 mM MgCl 2 ) to prevent strand
separation of double-stranded cDNA.
To produce sufficient cDNA for sequencing, Advantage
2 (Clontech) polymerase was used under the manufacturer’s recommended conditions during the second
round of amplification using the same primer concentrations and 1 μl of undiluted primary PCR product. We
recommend testing a range of dilutions of the primary
PCR product to obtain the desired quantity of amplified
cDNA in 9-10 PCR cycles. In cases of highly limiting
RNA concentration, we have also found that a secondary
PCR reaction using a 1:1:1 mix of Phusion, Cesium KlenTaq AC, and Deep Vent (exo-) (New England Biolabs)
polymerase in ThermoPol reaction buffer supplemented
with 1.5 mM MgSO4 and 1% DMSO produces the highest yield of secondary PCR product (note that this polymerase mix does not produce optimal results when used
for first-round amplification). Secondary PCR reactions
were cycled using the same parameters as the primary
PCR but running for approximately 10 cycles.
To prevent overcycling during both rounds of PCR
amplification, each reaction was prepared in duplicate,
and one reaction was spiked with 1 μl of 1:750

Page 18 of 22

SybrGreen I (Invitrogen). The spiked reactions were
monitored in real time on an Mx3005P QPCR machine
(Stratagene Inc.), and the samples were removed when
amplification began to plateau. To increase the representation of double-stranded cDNA, two cycles of
“chase PCR” were conducted following each round of
cDNA amplification after the optimal number of cycles
had been reached. Excess primers were added (1.5 μL
of each, 12 μM primer per 100 μL reaction), and each
reaction was subjected to two additional non-denaturing cycles of 1 minute at 77°C, 1 minute at 65°C, and
3 minutes at 72°C, followed by a 10 minute extension
at 72°C.
Following the second round of amplification and PCR
purification, the cDNA samples were double-digested
with SfiI and MmeI (40 and 26 units per 150 μl reaction,
respectively). cDNA species <500 bp were then removed
using Chroma Spin 400 columns (Clontech) which had
been equilibrated with TM buffer following the manufacturer’s protocol. It should be noted that the Chroma
Spin column protocol suggested in the Clontech
SMART cDNA kit is non-optimal, and that following
the protocol provided with the separately purchased columns is less labor-intensive and produces a higher yield
of size-selected cDNA. Equilibration of Chroma Spin
columns is critical for maximizing the yield of doublestranded cDNA as required by the Roche library preparation protocols. Following size selection, cDNA was
blunt-ended with the NEB Quick Blunting kit (New
England Biolabs) and purified once more with the QiaQuick kit. After each step of cDNA synthesis, the size
distribution was checked on 1.0% agarose gels, and the
cDNA samples were quantified using a Qubit (Invitrogen), after observing that the NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo
Scientific) did not reliably quantify ds-cDNA (C. Dunn,
personal communication).
To prepare normalized cDNA for GS-FLX Titanium
sequencing, 1 μl of the twice-amplified, purified cDNA
sample described above was subjected to Evrogen’s
DSN-treatment protocol, followed by a single round of
further amplification, SfiI/MmeI digestion, and size
selection. Approximately 5 μl of normalized and nonnormalized cDNA were synthesized.
454 Titanium Pyrosequencing

For the pilot study using the GS-FLX platform, EnGenCore (University of South Carolina) conducted the final
steps of library preparation, including nebulization,
adaptor-ligation, and sequencing of each sample (¼
plate each). For sequencing using the Titanium platform, the samples were nebulized, adaptor-ligated, and
pyrosequenced by the Institute for Genome Science and
Policy DNA Sequencing Facility (Duke University).

Sequence Assembly

Raw reads were assembled using the cDNA assembly
algorithm of Newbler v2.3 (Roche) with default assembly
parameters. An adaptor-trimming step was included in
the assembly (the “-v” flag), and the “-nosplit” flag was
also used to reduce the generation of extremely short
contigs that might otherwise have been created. All of
the raw reads generated in this study have been submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive (Study Accession Number: SRP002610.1).
Because redundancy was observed among the singletons generated by Newbler v2.3, the singletons were
reassembled using CAP3 [48], with ‘-z’ option set to 1.
Prior to this secondary assembly, the singletons were
screened for adaptor sequences using both cross_match
[66-68] and a custom python script (Casey Dunn, personal communication), We note that Newbler can also be
used to produce a .fasta and corresponding .qual files of
trimmed reads using the ‘-tr’ option. The final assembly
thus consists of three types of sequences: Newblerassembled sequences, cap3_contigs, and cap3_singlets,
all of which were subjected to subsequent analyses.
Sequence Annotation

Sequences were first mapped against the RefSeq Protein
database [[69], downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/
blast/db/ on April 27, 2010] using BLASTX. All BLAST
searches were conducting using BLAST v2.2.23+ [70] with
an e-value cut-off of 1e-10. We then used Blast2GO v1.2.7
[54] to retrieve the Gene Ontology (GO) [71] terms and
their parents associated with the top 20 BLAST hits for
each sequence. To avoid potentially double-counting
sequences that might represent un-assembled portions of
the same transcript, a custom python script (“transcriptome_blast_summarizer.py”, available at http://www.extavourlab.com/protocols/index.html) was used to identify
sequences with identical top BLAST hits prior to GO
annotation. If multiple sequences hit non-overlapping portions of the same top BLAST hit, we used the conservative
assumption that these sequences represented unassembled
portions of the same transcript, and therefore only tallied
the GO terms of one of these sequences. However, if multiple sequences hit overlapping portions of the same top
BLAST hit, we considered these sequences potential paralogs and retained them all. Thus, the counts of sequences
in each GO term only include one sequence per top
BLAST hit, unless the multiple sequences mapped to overlapping portions of the same BLAST hit. These counts
were used to compare the distribution of sequences
among specific GO terms between the transcriptomes of
O. fasciatus and the Drosophila melanogaster genome. For
this comparison, we used a precomputed GO annotation
of the D. melanogaster genome [72].

Page 19 of 22

The FASTA formatted transcriptome data set file was
examined in TextWrangler (v. 3.1, Bare Bones Software,
Inc.). Candidate genes were sought via whole gene names
and, where possible, via the gene name abbreviations,
while avoiding irrelevant hits. The FASTA header annotation of transcriptome sequences includes the top 20
BLASTx hits to the RefSeq database as described above.
Sequencher (v4.8, Gene Codes Corporation; default
settings: minimum 20 bp overlap between sequences,
≥85% sequence identity) and CLC Combined Workbench (v5.6.1, CLC Bio) were used to examine whether
transcriptome sequences could be further assembled.
Estimating sequencing depth

To estimate how thoroughly our sequencing efforts
sampled the O. fasciatus transcriptome, eight progressively larger subsets of the reads were independently
assembled. The total number of genes was then identified via BLASTX. For these smaller assemblies, reads
from one plate each of normalized and non-normalized
reads were combined in random order and sampled
without replacement. For each assembly, we BLASTed
the longest isotig of each isogroup, and all of the singletons, against the SwissProt database [[73], downloaded
from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/ on April 21, 2010].
We used the relatively small SwissProt database in order
to reduce computation time. However, the absolute
values of BLAST hits against this database are likely to
be underestimates of those values that would have been
obtained from a larger database such as RefSeq or nr. If
multiple isotigs or contigs hit non-overlapping portions
of the same top BLAST hit, only one of these sequences
was counted. However, because frequent cases of identical, unassembled singletons were observed, we counted
only one singleton per top BLAST hit, regardless of
whether these hits overlapped or not.
We used a custom python script to calculate the ortholog hit ratio. This script, “ortholog_hit_ratio_calculator.py”
is available at http://www.extavourlab.com/protocols/
index.html).
Assessing the importance of cDNA normalization

To assess the relative contribution of cDNA normalization
to the quality of our assembly, the screened, raw reads
from both normalized (N) and non-normalized (NN) samples were mapped against the complete assembly of all
reads using the BLASTN algorithm [70] with an e-value
cut-off of 1e-4. Based on these results, the Fisher’s Exact
Test was used to identify over- and under-represented
terms in each gene list. This test was performed using
Blast2GO (two-tailed, removing double IDs so that only
those genes hit uniquely by either N or NN reads were
considered). The BLASTN results were also investigated

Ewen-Campen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/61

using text searches to find whether certain genes of interest were present in only one of the two cDNA samples.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Normalized sample did not perform equally in
pilot and full sequencing runs. (A) For the normalized sample, the read
lengths of the full plate sequencing runs (white) were shorter than those
obtained by the 1/8 plate run (grey). (B) The read length distribution of
the non-normalized sample was comparable for both 1/8 plate (grey)
and full plate (white) sequencing runs.
Additional file 2: Distribution of average coverage (reads/bp) within
contigs in the O. fasciatus transcriptome. The coverage within contigs
is calculated by dividing the total number of base pairs contained in the
reads used to construct a contig by the length of that contig. Note that
Newbler v2.3 discards those contigs <100 bp.
Additional file 3: RT-PCR validation of bioinformatically predicted
multiple isoforms. (A) Schematic of experimental design. Ten isogroups
were randomly selected, each containing exactly two isotigs that differed
by the presence/absence of a single contig. PCR primers were designed
to flank the differing region. (B) Band sizes predicted by Newbler v2.3 for
ten randomly selected isogroups containing exactly two isotigs. (C)
Agarose gel following RT-PCR using primers against the sequences
described in (B). Ladder sizes are given in base pairs on the left. Blue
arrowheads: bands of the sizes predicted by Newbler v2.3; red
arrowheads: bands not predicted by Newbler v2.3.
Additional file 4: Identity of taxa with top BLAST hits. “Isotigs” refers
only to the longest isotig of each isogroup; “Singletons” refers to the
Newbler-generated singletons after secondary CAP3 assembly. The
category “other” is the summation of all those species obtaining very low
numbers of BLAST hits.
Additional file 5: O. fasciatus assembly isotigs have ortholog hit
ratios similar to predictions from fully genome-sequenced
databases. When isotigs from the O. fasciatus transcriptome are
BLASTed against the RefSeq protein database, ortholog hit ratios show a
similar profile to those obtained when the complete Acyrthosiphon pisum
gene prediction set (downloaded from http://www.aphidbase.com/
aphidbase/downloads/) is BLASTed against the predicted gene set of
Drosophila melanogaster (r5.28 downloaded from ftp://ftp.flybase.net/
genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/) with an e-value cut-off of 1e-10.
Additional file 6: GO terms enriched in Normalized (N) and NonNormalized (NN) cDNA samples. N (assembly generated from full plate of
normalized cDNA) and NN (assembly generated from an equalized number
of base pairs of non-normalized cDNA) reads were BLASTed against the full
transcriptome assembly, and the results were used to generate “test” and
“reference” sets for a Fisher’s Exact Test. FDR: false discovery rate.
Additional file 7: Comparison of de novo transcriptome assemblies
produced by Newbler v2.3 and Newbler v2.5. Number of BLASTx hits
reflects a search against RefSeq Protein database with an e-value cut-off
value of 1e-10.
