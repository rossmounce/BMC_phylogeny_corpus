Proceedings summary
Accepted for publication in the conference proceedings
for this year were 21 research manuscripts out of a total
of thirty three papers submitted for consideration
(~64%). The volume of papers dropped a bit from last
year’s record-setting forty-three papers submitted and
twenty eight accepted [1-28], yet the acceptance rate
was very similar. At least 2 reviewers, a mixture of
external and internal (i.e., MCBIOS members), were
responsible for evaluating each paper. Our goal for
inclusion of papers in the conference proceedings
remains the same as prior years: To be inclusive, yet rigorous in the peer-review process such that accepted
papers are both high quality and reflective of the work
presented at the conference. Papers generally fell into
five categories:
Genomic analysis
Michael Mayo et al. propose a one-dimensional diffusion-reaction model, in the form of a master equation,
to analyze the non-equilibrium protein sliding kinetics
along a segment of bacterial DNA [29]. Model validity is
assessed through Monte Carlo simulations, and the
results are interpreted within the context of bacterial
transcription.
Sujoy Roy et al. describe a novel method to identify
potential transcription factors from a list of differentially
expressed genes using textual similarity between the
genes and transcription factors reported in the literature
[30]. Importantly, their approach has the potential to
identify transcription factors that might be indirectly
regulating the genes and, thus, would not be recognized
by sequence-based analysis of the expressed gene
promoters.
In “An Efficient and Extensible Approach for Compressing Phylogenetic Trees” [31], the authors demonstrate an efficient method for compressing large
collections of Newick file representations of phylogenetic trees. To do this, the Newick file compression is
directly operated on, without decompression needed.
Network analysis
Ying Li et al. describe RefNetBuilder [32], a platform for
the construction of putative reference pathways or gene
regulatory networks from expressed sequence tags
(ESTs), which provides a bioinformatics tool for
researchers who work with non-model organisms.
Analyses of gene expression networks require understanding of how these networks can be manipulated to
achieve desirable phenotype. The paper by Noushin
Ghaffari et al.[33] proposes an alternative method for
devising intervention/control policies for Boolean networks. Not only does it outperform other available techniques (MFPT-CP and SSD-CP) but eliminates the step

Page 2 of 5

of network reduction, thus simplifying analysis of large
gene regulatory networks without loss of information.
Mohammad Shahrokh et al. [34] describe an algorithm for identifying a set of mutations that drove a
healthy network into a cancerous state. Based on partial
knowledge of the underlying gene regulatory network
and the steady state distribution of the gene expression
values in a given tumor, their algorithm is able to reconstruct the actual path of tumor progression in simulated
and real networks.

Systems biology
Fan Zhang and Jake Chen develop a repository for human
organ-specific biomarkers called HOMER [35]. The ability
to distinguish the tissue-specificity or enrichment of individual proteins is an important step in being able to define,
molecularly, what is “normal” versus diseased and opens
up avenues to use these patterns for diagnostics.
Xiaoning Qian and collaborators describe an improved
method for computing the similarity between nodes
when aligning different biological networks [36]. A
semi-Markov random walk framework is used to calculate global correspondence scores between all pairs of
nodes in the networks. The effectiveness of the
approach in recovering known pathways is demonstrated with both synthetic and microbial networks.
Venkata Swamy and colleagues [37] describe a k-votes
method for integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI)
networks constructed from different databases. Edges are
included in the integrated network if they are included in
at least k of the source networks. The authors evaluate
the “goodness” of the resulting network for different
values of k by clustering the integrated network and evaluating the resulting clusters using measures of modularity, similarity-based modularity, clustering score, and
enrichment in biological annotations. Results indicate
that a k-value of two provides the best results.
Emerging biological threats or epidemics can rapidly
spread through out the world due to readily accessible
and rapid transportation systems. Social networking
data, news, and databases where hospitals and clinical
laboratories deposit screening data world wide can be
harnessed to assess potential outbreaks of human pathogens. Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratories
[38] outlined a strategy for Biological Signature Identification and Threat Evaluation System (BioSITES). The
authors focused on the principles for constructing a
semantic knowledgebase capable of integrating diverse
data repositories and data streams to use in constructing
such a threat identification system.
Microarray studies/RNAseq
With thousands of microarray experiments publicly
available, researchers are increasingly interested in

Wren et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 10):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S10/S1

conducting meta-analyses of them, yet finding a way to
make each dataset directly comparable is challenging
because of the technical and experimental variation. To
solve this, Dozmorov and Wren report on a semi-automated method to normalize thousands of microarray
experiments from NCBI’s GEO database, to create a
standardized subset of many or even all experiments
[39]. Once these datasets can be directly compared, the
authors also show that a meta-analysis of gene-gene coexpression patterns across 1-color microarrays can be
used to accurately predict gene ontology categories [40].
In addition to enabling topic-centric transcriptional
meta-analyses, global meta-analysis of gene-gene coexpression patterns has also been shown to be useful in
predicting function and phenotype for genes [41,42].
Minjun Chen et al. from the Food and Drug Administration present an assessment of models to find biomarkers from microarray experiments that are predictive of
clinical endpoints [43]. They find that an ensemble
method (i.e., using a combination of results from different methods) outperforms expert-nominated models.
As the cost of sequencing declines, RNAseq is poised
to replace microarrays for relative gene expression analysis. Ying Wang et al. [44] perform a quality evaluation
of two RNAseq datasets looking at chicken transcriptome gene representation. They focused on determining
the optimal number of reads needed for detection of
increasing percentages of annotated genes. Their study
looked at sequencing read length coupled to the number
of reads needed for optimal detection of both abundant
and rare transcripts. Their work provides a useful,
orderly approach to evaluating the level of RNAseq coverage needed for a given percent of gene detection in
organisms other than human with well annotated
genomes.
Markovets and Herman have developed a novel tool,
Transcriptome Analysis with Circos, TrAC, for comparative analysis of RNAseq short-read data [45]. To
validate TrAC, the authors selected the TCA and glycolysis pathways for comparison of normal brain and cancer RNAseq results. They calculated the expression level
for a quantitative digital signal and visual output of the
topology of transcript coverage. They showed unique
expression patterns for pathway markers between normal and cancer samples as a way to characterize the
drastic metabolic shifts in these pathways known as the
Marberg effect. However, TrAC is not pathway specific
and has broad application to gene expression-related
biological questions.
Imaging and structural biology

Determining the effects of hypertension and related diseases on vascular structure is complicated by the difficulty of measuring arterial morphology non-invasively.

Page 3 of 5

Diedrich et al.[46] computationally measured tortuosity,
or twistedness, of arteries in Magnetic Resonance
Angiography images. They were able to differentiate
between hypertensive and non-hypertensive populations
using arterial tortuosity measures thereby validating its
use determining underlying arterial morphology.
In “An Improved Border Detection in Dermoscopy
Images for Density Based Clustering“ [47], the authors
take their previously developed dermoscopic region classification method, DBSCAN, and improve a preprocessing step to have direct access to image information,
and make use of color information (if present), with significant improvement in both speed and accuracy over
the original DBSCAN.
A paper by Xiaofei Nan et al.[48] demonstrates a feasibility of splitting a problem domain into several nonoverlapping sub-problems to simplify learning tasks for
biological predictions. The authors provide a metric to
rank domain information attributes according to their
potential to reduce the uncertainty of a classification
task. In comparison with other methods this approach
enhances prediction performance of the classifier.

Miscellaneous
Halil Bisgin et al. report a method to identify topics
within pharmaceutical labels to compare their similarity
in an automated, objective manner [49]. This helps
enable identification of drugs with similar effects, safety
concerns and adverse events. They find their method is
accurate at grouping drugs in each of these capacities.
Stephen Winters-Hilt and colleagues [50] provide an
overview of potential applications of NTD technology in
biosensing. Applications include single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, targeted DNA re-sequencing, protein isoforms assays, and biosensing via
antibody or aptamer couple molecules. They also
describe a kit platform, the Nanoscope Kit, to increase
the accessibility of the technology.
In “A Modified Stokes-Einstein Equation for A-beta
Aggregation” [51], the authors argue that the standard
Stokes-Einstein equation is insufficient to understand Abeta 42 protein diffusion, given its aggregation behavior,
and demonstrate a modified form of the Stokes-Einstein
equation with improved modeling performance.
