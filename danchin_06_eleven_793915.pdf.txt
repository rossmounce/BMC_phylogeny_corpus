Abstract
Background: Gene losses played a role which may have been as important as gene and genome
duplications and rearrangements, in modelling today species' genomes from a common ancestral
set of genes. The set and diversity of protein-coding genes in a species has direct output at the
functional level. While gene losses have been reported in all the major lineages of the metazoan
tree of life, none have proposed a focus on specific losses in the vertebrates and mammals lineages.
In contrast, genes lost in protostomes (i.e. arthropods and nematodes) but still present in
vertebrates have been reported and extensively detailed. This probable over-anthropocentric way
of comparing genomes does not consider as an important phenomena, gene losses in species that
are usually described as "higher". However reporting universally conserved genes throughout
evolution that have recently been lost in vertebrates and mammals could reveal interesting features
about the evolution of our genome, particularly if these losses can be related to losses of capability.
Results: We report 11 gene families conserved throughout eukaryotes from yeasts (such as
Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to bilaterian animals (such as Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis
elegans). This evolutionarily wide conservation suggests they were present in the last common
ancestors of fungi and metazoan animals. None of these 11 gene families are found in human nor
mouse genomes, and their absence generally extends to all vertebrates. A total of 8 out of these
11 gene families have orthologs in plants, suggesting they were present in the Last Eukaryotic
Common Ancestor (LECA). We investigated known functional information for these 11 gene
families. This allowed us to correlate some of the lost gene families to loss of capabilities.
Conclusion: Mammalian and vertebrate genomes lost evolutionary conserved ancestral genes that
are probably otherwise not dispensable in eukaryotes. Hence, the human genome, which is
generally viewed as being the result of increased complexity and gene-content, has also evolved
through simplification and gene losses. This acknowledgement confirms, as already suggested, that
the genome of our far ancestor was probably more complex than ever considered.

Background
It is widely acknowledged that gene losses occurred in various different lineages of the tree of life and contributed in
modeling modern genomes. Reports of gene losses
including losses of ancestral genes in the human genome,
predate the genomic era [1,2] and generally described one
to a few genes. The availability of the complete genomes
and proteomes of several species including eukaryotes
allowed to investigate gene losses at a larger scale [3-7], to
consider gene loss as a global phenomena, and to study
co-losses in different lineages. In addition, these genomescale analyses allowed an evaluation of the ancestral proteome size at various different nodes of the tree of life, and
thus provided the capacity to deduce differential losses in
each daughter branches. Most "gene loss" reports and
analyses [3,6,8,9] arrive at the conclusion that protostomes (like Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans) underwent significantly higher rates of loss of
ancestral genes than vertebrates (like humans). Krylov et
al., for example, found that the human genome underwent losses of 158 gene families in comparison to the last
common ancestor of all coelomates, while Drosophila
lost 480 of these ancestral families [6]. Hughes et al.,
found that compared to the last vertebrates common
ancestor, humans lost 78 gene families while fugu lost
122 of them [3]. Therefore, in a naturally anthropocentric
manner, most of the analyses concentrated on the message that vertebrates, mammalian and in particular the
human genome evolved through keeping more complexity in comparison to "basal phyla". The studies thus provided more emphasis on ancestral genes that were lost
outside of vertebrate lineage and, more precisely on genes
still present in humans but lost in other species.
However, more recent publications, such as the analysis of
the chicken genome [10], reported gene families that were
probably present in the ancestor of all eukaryotes but were
lost in mammalian genomes as well as in other lineages.
Alternatively, several authors have reported specific losses
in hominoids or human lineages of genes that are conserved in all other mammals [1,2,11,12], or in all other
chordates [13].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/5

hence are probably universally indispensable in this lineage. However as no member of these gene families are
found neither in Homo sapiens nor in Mus musculus, they
represent gene families lost, at least, in mammals (and
possibly in other lineages). Mammalian gene losses
reported so far, in contrast, have generally considered
gene families that were lost multiple times and independently in several different eukaryotic lineages thus constituting non mammalian-specific losses and repeatedly
dispensable genes. Since the otherwise universal conservation of the 11 gene families we identified may reveal functionally important and central genes for eukaryotes, we
retrieved publicly available function for these genes. We
next attempted to correlate these gene families' losses to
loss of capabilities in our lineage as well as more generally
in vertebrates' lineage.
At a methodological level, all genome-scale analyses published thus far are based on multiple-way best reciprocal
blast hit approaches [14] to detect potential clusters of
orthologous genes. Moreover, these studies were all
bound to the analysis of only 7 genomes with the possibility that their annotation contain errors or missing
genes. Thus, data from other species was not taken into
account to complete the biodiversity coverage. The difference in our analysis is that we added two crucial steps: a
phylogenetic confirmation followed by an in-depth similarity search to gain more support and evidence. Systematic phylogenetic analysis allowed correcting falseorthology inference due to multidirectional best blast hits
approaches. In-depth similarity search allowed confirming loss and to provide more detailed resolution of the
loss timing of genes, by exploiting all the biodiversity
available in biological databases. This double confirmation turned out to eliminate a non-negligible proportion
of potential clusters and putative lost gene families. This
result suggest that while at a large scale automatic clusters
of orthologous genes certainly provide a good overview of
the general trends in comparative proteomics, careful confirmation should be considered when analyzing in detail
each cluster at a small scale.

Results and discussion
In the present analysis, we investigate the function of 11
gene families that are conserved across four model
Opisthokonts species (fungi + metazoan); Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and
Caenorhabditis elegans but that are absent from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus genomes (Figure 1). Throughout the
manuscript we use the term "gene-family" to describe
families of homologous genes that are present as multiple
copies in at least one of the species in which they are still
found. The major novelty in our analysis is that we have
focused on gene families that are still evolutionarily conserved at least in all the 4 Opisthokonts model species and

Evolutionarily conserved genes, lost in mammals and
vertebrates
By parsing clusters of orthologous eukaryotic genes, we
first identified 24 groups of orthologs that have representatives in all 4 model Opisthokonts species (Caenorhabditis
elegans, Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) but none neither in Homo sapiens nor in
Mus musculus (see methods for more details). Using this
criterion, we aimed at selecting genes that were present in
the last common ancestor of Opisthokonts (Figure 1) but
were specifically lost, at least, before the mammals' radiation. We performed a systematic phylogenetic analysis of

all of these 24 groups followed by an in-depth BLAST similarity search (including ESTs, HTGS, WGS, and BAC databases). Phylogenetic analysis allowed the confirmation of
homology relationships between the genes inside a given
group. It also permitted us to refine the loss temporal pattern by placing additional species on the phylogenetic
trees. The "in-depth" similarity search allowed us to check
for possible traces of these gene family members in other
species and to support the hypothesis of actual loss in
mouse and human genomes. Only half of the 24 groups
had both phylogenetically confirmed homology relationships and a total absence of trace of conservation in
mouse and human genomes. Hence, our analysis, which
is based upon the systematic phylogenetic analysis of prebuilt clusters of orthologous genes followed by in depth
verification of absence of trace of conservation, revealed
that in our case, 50% of clusters of orthologous genes
determined by multidirectional reciprocal best hits led to
false putative gene losses. It should also be pointed out
that while reciprocal blast hits' false positives can be
detected and eliminated through phylogenetic analysis,
false negative could also occur from such approach.
Indeed, true orthologs having more complex evolutionary
history can be missed by reciprocal best hits and would
thus not be detected using this approach. Our analysis
thus represents a minimal set of ancestral genes that were
lost in human and mouse and suggests that more gene
families universally conserved in eukaryotes may have
recently been lost in mammals.
The 11 gene families passing both the phylogenetic analysis and the similarity search are listed on Table 1; all the
other groups were either artifact due to protein sequences
missing in databases or due to the pairwise method for
building the predicted clusters of orthologous genes (one

eliminated family was a gypsy element some remnants of
which have recently been reported in the human genome
[15]). It should be noted that we required very stringent
parameters for parsing the groups of orthologous genes.
We required that the genes be still present in all the 4
model Opisthokonts genomes (Caenorhabditis elegans,
Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae); and are absent both from human and
mouse genomes. We thus did not intend to estimate the
total number of genes that were present in the last common ancestor of Opisthokonts, since we did not consider
genes that may have been lost independently and multiple times in different lineages. Rather we focused on
ancestral genes universally conserved, still present in
today model metazoan species and presumably lost in
mammals. The 11 gene families we identified were certainly present in the last common ancestor of fungi and
metazoan animals, which is believed to have lived around
one billion years ago. Interestingly, 8 of these gene families have corresponding orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana
and other green plants, which suggests that these gene
families were present even more ancestrally in the last
eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA).
Phylogenetic loss pattern
Phylogenetic analyses coupled with in depth similarity
search revealed that all the genes that are absent from
human and mouse genomes had no trace of conservation
with any mammalian sequence in protein databases and
hence may reflect losses extending to all mammals. Furthermore, 9 out of the 11 groups of orthologous genes
presented no trace of conservation in any vertebrate species indicating that these families were lost more ancestrally and even before the vertebrate's radiation. Only one
group had orthologous counterparts in urochordates, sug-

Bootstrap values are indicated to evaluate each node's robustness, for Neighbor Joining, Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood methods respectively. The Opisthokonts group is represented and total absence of deuterostomian species is
remarkable. This tree, as all the trees in the present analysis, was constructed with the automated phylogenomic annotation
pipeline available in the FIGENIX platform [24]. For a matter of clarity, only one representative and one close relative of each
of the 4 core metazoan species selected for constructing the COGS are represented on this tree. The whole tree, available
upon request, includes several other fungal, plant and protostomian species.

gesting that all the other families may have been lost at
least as far back as the chordates radiation (Table 1). We
propose that the 11 gene families we identified were at
least present in the last common ancestor of
Opisthokonts. None of these 11 gene families exhibit conservation in any mammalian species and they thus constitute at least mammalian-lineage's gene losses. The
phylogenetic analysis shows that the loss pattern of the 11
gene families is different and some genes have been lost
more ancestrally than others. However, as all these gene
families are conserved in all Opisthokonts lineages except

in chordates, they may represent functionally crucial
genes for the majority of Eukaryotic life forms.
Functional aspects of lost genes
We investigated available functional information related
to the 11 gene families and tried to correlate functional
data to losses of functionality or changes in environmental conditions for the species in which they are missing
(Table 1). We searched various "function-centered" databases, including pathway and domain databases (more
details are available on Methods). A total of 10 gene fam-

ilies had publicly available functional information
assigned. More than 50% of the universally conserved
gene families lost in mammals are involved in biomolecular metabolism/catabolism; three gene families were
annotated as oxydoreductive and ion transporters, and
one family as being a transcription factor (Table 1).
Interestingly, some cases of gene loss could be related to
losses of functionality in vertebrates and mammals, as for
example the cases of TPS1 and ILV1 gene families which
we detail hereafter.
The TPS gene family encoding Trehalose 6P synthase
This family is found in plants, fungi, arthropods, and
nematodes but appears to be missing in mammals and
more widely in vertebrates' genomes (Figure 2). This gene
family loss can be correlated to the loss of the ability to
biosynthesize Trehalose 6P from UDP-glucose. This disaccharide, which works as a storage carbohydrate, is crucial
for the survival of species in dry and freezing periods and
under other stress conditions [16]. Its presence in bacteria,
in addition to Opisthokonts lineages suggests it was
ancestrally present on the earliest lifeforms on earth.
Mammals are unable to produce Trehalose 6P, and actually Trehalose 6P is not found in those species [17]. Moreover, Guo et al. [18] ectopically expressed bacterial
Trehalose biosynthesis genes in human cells and showed
that these cells acquired tolerance to desiccation. Trehalose biosynthesis from UDP glucose requires two
enzymes, TPS (trehalose 6P synthase, EC:2.4.1.15), and
TPP (trehalose 6P phosphatase, EC:3.1.3.12), this information allowed us to identify a 13th group of lost genes in
human and mouse. Indeed, no trace of conservation
could be found in any database in mammals for TPP. This
gene family is present in plants, yeasts, and arthropods,
but has also been lost in nematodes [17], and for that reason, it did not pass our criterion in the parsing of groups
of orthologous genes, since we required presence in all the
4 model species and did not consider multiple convergent
losses.
The THDH/ILV1 family encoding Threonine deaminases
Members of this gene family are found in plants, yeasts,
arthropods, and nematodes. No trace of conservation can
be found in mammals or chordates, which suggests that
this family was lost before chordates' radiation. Members
of this family are all involved in Threonine metabolism
and biosynthesis of 2-Oxobutanoate, which is used as a
precursor in the biosynthesis pathway of 3 other aminoacids: Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine. These amino acids are
all essential amino acids that mammals are unable to synthesize and must be provided by the diet. It should be
noted here that while arthropods and nematodes are able
to biosynthesize 2-Oxobutanoate from Threonine, they
are also unable to synthesize these essential aminoacids

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/5

due to the loss of enzymes further down the pathway
(ILV3, ILV5) as shown by Hughes et al. [4]. The universal
capability (found from plants to arthropods) that we have
lost is thus, in this case, the biosynthesis of 2-Oxobutanoate from Threonine.
Most of the other families lost in vertebrates and mammals could not be correlated with clear loss of functionality, either because not enough functional information was
available for the considered genes or because the same
functionality was replaced by other genes in mammals
and vertebrates. This latter case is illustrated by the GLT
family that, although present in plants, yeasts, arthropods
and nematodes, is absent from all vertebrates. This family
encodes enzymes involved in glutamate and nitrogen
metabolism (EC:1.4.1.13) which catalyzes the reversible
reaction L-Glutamate → L-Glutamine, with NADP+ or
NAD+ as acceptor partner. This reaction is also possible in
vertebrates though it is catalyzed by another enzyme
(EC:6.3.5.4) and uses other partners (L-aspartate and Lasparagine). Interestingly, the loss pattern of these
enzymes is different between the various eukaryotic lineages. Indeed, while Plants, Yeasts and Nematodes have
the two enzymes and are thus able to transform LGlutamine and L-Glutmamate using two different pathways, Arthropods only have one enzyme (EC:1.4.1.13),
and vertebrates only have the other one (EC:6.3.5.4). The
loss pattern is thus complex in this case. The last eukaryotic common ancestor had at least these two enzymes and
one of them was lost in the vertebrate's lineage while the
other one was lost in arthropods.
As a complementary analysis to mammalian and vertebrates' losses of otherwise universally present
Opisthokonts genes we identified and analyzed, we also
performed a survey of previously reported gene losses in
mammals in the literature. We re-investigated each
reported gene loss in order to confirm them (using in
depth similarity search explained in Methods) and to give
more details about the temporal pattern of the loss of
these genes (see the detailed report on the supplementary
material 1).

Conclusion
Gene loss and our ancestor's genomic "complexity"
We reported here an in depth analysis of a dozen of gene
families that were all at least present in the last common
ancestor of fungi and metazoan (Opisthokonts), are still
present and conserved in all modern Opisthokonts model
species, but are specifically absent from human and
mouse genomes. Our analysis shows that, as with other
species, the human genome and other mammalian
genomes have undergone losses of gene families compared to the genome of the last common ancestor of all
Opisthokonts. Mammals and more generally vertebrates

thus appear to have recently and specifically lost genes
that were conserved for around 1 billion years. These
genes may thus constitute universally indispensable genes
in all Opisthokonts except in mammals and vertebrates.
Most of the lost genes we report in this analysis were

already present in LECA. It thus indicates that mammalian
and vertebrates' lineages have lost genes that were more
ancestrally present in the earliest lifeforms on earth and
are still widely present and conserved in other eukaryotic
lineages. The total number of such genes we have lost is

certainly higher. We reported here the existence of at least
11 families of such genes and correlated the losses with
functional data. In addition to confirming that the human
genome also evolved through gene losses of very ancestral
genes and not only by duplication events and the emergence of "new genes", this study also reinforces the
hypothesis first formulated by Kortschak et al [8], that the
genome of our far ancestor was more complex than usually considered.

detected and resolved by in-depth phylogenetic analysis
including additional taxa and comparison with a reference tree of life [24]. To perform the phylogenetic analysis, we used the phylogenomic analysis pipeline available
in FIGENIX automated genomic annotation platform
[24]. This pipeline uses as input any protein sequence and
can be summarized in the following steps (the whole
pipeline runs around 50 different steps):
- Produces blast similarity search.

Methods
The general strategy adopted to identify putative families
of homologous genes lost in mammals and vertebrates is
schematized on figure 3.

- Filters blast results for significant similarity.

Selection of putative universally conserved gene families
lost in mammals
Zdobnov et al. constructed clusters of putative orthologous genes in their comparative genomic analysis of the
Drosophila and Anopheles genomes [19]. These clusters
resemble the COGS and KOGS performed by Koonin et al
[20,21] as they were also built based on multiple way best
reciprocal blast hits. The COGs from Zdobnov et al.
included 7 eukaryotic species (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, and Mus
musculus) whose genome and proteome annotation were
available. The complete dataset containing all the clusters
of orthologous groups was kindly provided by Dr. Christian von Mering. Using UNIX grep and awk filters, we
selected clusters of putative orthologous genes containing
representatives from all the 4 following species:
Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles
gambiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but in which Homo sapiens and Mus musculus were missing. We thus selected
genes likely to have been ancestrally present in the last
common ancestor of metazoan animals and fungi (the
Opisthokonts ancestor), but that were lost at least in the
human and mouse genomes. We chose to focus on genes
lost at least in mammals rather than human specific
losses, because double losses (in human and mouse) reinforce the hypothesis of an actual loss and minimize the
risk of artifact due to incomplete databases or annotation
errors.

- Eliminates from the MSA sequences and columns producing potential biases in the phylogenetic reconstruction.

Confirmation of the orthology and paralogy relationships
inside the putative COGs
To filter false orthology and paralogy relationships determined by multidirectional reciprocal best blast hit analyses such as the one used in the construction of these
COGS, we performed a systematic phylogenetic analysis
of each cluster. Indeed, reciprocal gene losses as well as
genes actually missing in protein databases lead to false
orthology and paralogy relationships, thus producing artificial COGs [22,23]. These false relationships can only be

- Produces a multiple sequence alignment (MSA).

- Reconstructs phylogenetic trees using three different
methods, Maximum Parsimony [25], Maximum Likelihood [26] and Neighbor Joining [27].
- Builds a consensus of the three trees and reports bootstrap values given by each method.
- Compares the consensus tree to a reference species tree
of life.
- Deduces orthology and paralogy relationships.
For each putative group of orthologous genes, we chose
the Yeast protein as query sequence, for blast searches we
selected the NCBI nr protein database and we used the
NCBI taxonomic tree as the reference tree of life. All
orthology and paralogy relationships were thus phylogenetically verified and false-positive COGs were eliminated
from the dataset.
Determining the loss temporal pattern
Detailed phylogenetic analysis coupled with in depth similarity-search of all the confirmed clusters of orthologous
genes allowed, apart from confirming homology relationships, to check to what extent genes, orthologous to the
genes of the considered family are found in other species.
Phylogenetic trees for each family are available upon
request.
Supporting the loss hypothesis in mammals and
vertebrates
For each phylogenetically confirmed cluster of orthologous genes in which at least Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae are altogether present; and human and mouse
are both absent; we sought in depth for traces of conserva-

tion in mouse and human genomes, and more generally
in mammalian and vertebrates genomes using blast. We
performed blastp searches with relaxed stringency on
Swissprot, NR, and Ensembl proteomes. If no hit was
found we performed a further tblastn analysis with
relaxed stringency on complete genomes, HTGS, ESTs,
Traces Repositories, and WGS databases. In cases where
there are still no hit, and for species having their genome
completely sequenced as human and mouse, the most
likely hypothesis is that the gene family has actually been
lost in the corresponding species. Multiplying the number
of mammalian and vertebrate genomes searched against
reinforces the hypothesis of an actual loss, and in the
present analysis we used all publicly available genomic
information.
Functional information mining
For each cluster of orthologous genes lost in mammals,
we retrieved available functional information related to
the genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
Arabidopsis thaliana (when green plants' orthologs were
present). We searched the KEGG [28] database for known
pathways in which the genes are involved, and known
enzymatic properties and reactions in which they are
involved (EC codes). We searched flybase, Wormbase,
MGI, SGD, TAIR, and Swissprot databases for annotated
functional information (Biochemical Function, Biological
Process, and Cellular Component) in the gene ontology
format [29]. We also used Interpro and Pfam [30] web
servers to retrieve protein domains information for all
these species.

Authors' contributions
EGJD wrote the manuscript and designed and performed
the whole analysis. PG participated in designing UNIX
awk and grep scripts for parsing results of the clusters of
orthologous genes. PP supervised the whole analysis and
participated in analyzing the results and in drawing conclusions.
