Abstract
Background: The dspA (hik33) gene, coding for a putative sensory histidine kinase, is conserved
in plastids (ycf26) and cyanobacteria. It has been linked with a number of different stress responses
in cyanobacteria.
Results: We constructed an insertional mutant of dspA (ycf26) in Synechocystis 6803. We found
little phenotypic effect during nitrogen starvation. However, when the mutation was combined
with deletion of the pta gene coding for phosphotransacetylase, a more significant phenotype was
observed. Under nitrogen starvation, the pta/dspA double mutant degrades its phycobilisomes less
than the wild type and still has about half of its chlorophyll-protein complexes.
Conclusion: Our data indicates that acetyl-phosphate-dependent phosphorylation of response
regulator(s) overlaps with DspA-dependent signalling of the degradation of chlorophyll-protein
complexes (and to a lesser extent phycobilisomes) in Synechocystis 6803.

Background
The assembly, composition and maintenance of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes are regulated by
many different factors including light quality, light intensity, temperature, water availability and nutrient status
[1]. Microorganisms have diverse mechanisms for sensing
and acclimating to environmental parameters. In bacteria,
two-component signal transduction pathways form a
major part of the signalling machinery, mediating adaptive responses to a broad range of environmental stimuli
[2-4]. In response to such stimuli, a sensor kinase autophosphorylates an internal histidine residue, and then
transfers the phosphate to a conserved aspartate residue
on the receiver domain of its cognate response regulator.

The phosphorylation of the response regulator often leads
to changes in gene transcription [5].
Response regulators are generally phosphorylated by their
cognate sensor kinases, but phosphorylation can also be
mediated through low molecular mass phosphate donors,
such as acetyl phosphate, phosphoramidate (NH2PO3)
and carbamyl phosphate [6-9]. The pta gene encodes
phosphotransacetylase which catalyses the production of
acetyl phosphate, the activated acetate intermediate that
occurs during conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate [10].
Chamnongpol & Groisman [11] identified acetyl phosphate as the phosphate donor for a mutant version of the
response regulator PhoP (PhoP*) and showed that inactivation of the pta gene abolished PhoP*-mediated

transcription. Most response regulators can be phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate in vitro [8], but at physiological
concentration this may not be significant depending on
the Km for each individual response regulator for acetyl
phosphate. It may be that acetyl phosphate maintains a
low level of phosphorylation for most response regulators. The pta gene has been identified in Synechocystis 6803
(slr2132) and Crocosphaera watsonii by homology to other
bacterial pta sequences (up to 47% sequence identity by
BLASTP), however pta has not been identified in the
genome sequence of the other cyanobacteria.
The gene dspA (ycf26) codes for a putative sensory histidine kinase that is conserved in plastids and cyanobacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence of DspA contains
663 amino acids in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis 6803). DspA has a HAMP [12] and a PAS sensor
domain [13]. We have also identified a possible additional sensory domain in Ycf26, which will be discussed
below. All cyanobacterial genomes sequenced to date contain an ORF encoding a Ycf26 orthologue and ycf26 is also
the only histidine kinase gene present in the plastid
genomes of the red algae Porphyra purpurea, Gracilaria tenuistipitata and Cyanidium caldarium [14]. This suggests that
it performs a key role in the regulation of the level of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes.
The probable orthologue for Ycf26 in the cyanobacterium
Synechocystis 6803 is an ORF designated sll0698 in the
CyanoBase genome database http://www.kazusa.or.jp/
cyano which has also been called Hik33 [15] and DspA
[16]. It was identified as a factor that confers resistance to
a variety of herbicides and was suggested to be a histidine
kinase involved in chemical sensing [16]. It was found to
be involved in gene expression (including photosynthesis-related genes), demonstrating characteristics of a sensor that can detect a decrease in membrane fluidity, and is
involved in the perception and transduction of salt stress
and low temperature signals in Synechocystis 6803
[15,17,18]. Deletion of this open reading frame leads to
global changes in gene expression [19,20] and in addition
a potential link has been identified between Hik33 and
Rre31 (RpaA). In another cyanobacterium, Synechococcus
sp. PCC7942 (Synechococcus 7942), the probable orthologue for Ycf26 was shown to regulate phycobilisome degradation during nutrient starvation and in high light. The
gene was therefore designated nblS (non-bleaching
mutant sensor) [21]. DspA is also important for the survival of Synechocystis 6803 when grown in high-light [22].
One possible cognate response regulator (NblR) has been
identified in Synechococcus 7942 for NblS, however, no
orthologue for NblR has been identified in Synechocystis
6803 (MK Ashby & J Houmard, unpublished) and it is
likely that NblS also interacts with other response regulators [21]. NblS has been proposed to integrate redox and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/47

light signals and may influence other signalling pathways
involved in acclimation responses [21]. Thus it appears
that the orthologues of DspA in other cyanobacteria have
different but overlapping functions.
A role for the sll0698 gene product in controlling the degradation of the photosynthetic apparatus during nutrient
stress has not yet been demonstrated in Synechocystis
6803. We have constructed an insertional deletion mutant
in this ORF, which we will refer to as dspA. We show that
the inactivation of dspA has little phenotypic effect under
nitrogen starvation, unless the mutation is combined with
deletion of the pta gene. In the double mutant there is a
dramatic effect on the degradation of chlorophyll-protein
complexes under nitrogen starvation, which is not seen in
either of the single mutants, however phycobilisomes are
degraded, though not to the same level as in wild type. We
conclude that acetyl phosphate masks DspA signalling
under our laboratory conditions. The results indicate that
the degradation of photosynthetic complexes during
nutrient stress is controlled by multiple inputs, including
acetyl phosphate level.

Results
Analysis of cyanobacterial and plastid deduced Ycf26
protein sequences
The deduced amino acid sequences for Ycf26 from 15
available cyanobacterial annotated genome sequences
and the red algal species Porphyra purpurea, Gracilaria tenuistipitata and Cyanidium caldarium were analysed by Pfam
and SMART. This identified a HAMP, PAS (low confidence
in Cyanidium), HisKA and HATPase_c domain (Figure 1).
SMART and Interpro also identified two potential transmembrane helical regions upstream of the HAMP domain
(33–55 and 201–223 in 6803). The identification of
transmembrane sequences by SMART is with an accuracy
of 97–98% [23]. Because the 145 amino acid region that
is flanked by the two transmembrane regions is highly
conserved in all 15 cyanobacterial sequences and Porphyra
(see additional figure online and Prodom Family

PD339187 [24]) and it is adjacent and upstream of a
HAMP domain (which is known to in most cases be
actively involved in transmission of signals from a periplasmic signalling domain to the cytoplasmic portion of
the protein [12,25,26]), we think it probably functions as
a periplasmic sensor. We have not been able to detect
homologous sequences in any other protein sequence,
suggesting that it is unique to Ycf26 (DspA/NblS). The
PAS sensor domain may bind a redox sensitive cofactor
[13] that could potentially report on the metabolic state of
the cell. Phylogenetic analysis (Ashby, MK and Houmard,
J unpublished) and ClustalW alignments of these
sequences and the alignment scores indicate that all these
proteins (except Cyanidium caldarium and Gracilaria tenuistipitata) are probably orthologues (see supplementary
data online). This is supported by Tu et al., [19] who were
able to rescue their dspA null mutant in Synechocystis 6803
with the nblS gene from Synechococcus 7942.
Phenotype of the pta, dspA and pta/dspA mutants under
nutrient-replete conditions
Mutants were routinely characterised by whole cell
absorption spectra, which can be used to give an estimate
of the amount of chlorophyll and phycocyanin per cell
[27]. Mutants were further characterised by 77 K fluorescence emission spectra. These spectra give an indication of
changes in the PSII:PSI ratio [28].

When cells were grown under low light (white light at 10
µmol m-2 s-1) the absorption spectra were similar, indicating little difference in the chlorophyll and phycocyanin
content of the cells (data not shown). When cells were
grown under higher light (80 µmol m-2 s-1), only slight
differences in absorption spectra and Chl/PC ratios were
seen (Table 2). However low-temperature fluorescence
spectra recorded with chlorophyll excitation revealed
changes in the ratio of PSII/PSI (Figure 2). These spectra
show peaks at 685 nm and 695 nm (both from PSII) and
725 nm (PSI) [28,29]. Spectra have been normalised to
the PSI fluorescence emission, as their absolute amplitudes are unreliable [28]. When cells were grown at 80
µmol m-2 s-1, the dspA and pta single mutants show a lower
PSII/PSI ratio than the wild-type, and this difference was
more pronounced in the pta/dspA double mutant (Figure
2). A similar pattern was seen in cells grown at 10 µmol m2 s-1, but the differences were less pronounced (not
shown).
Phenotype of the pta, dspA and pta/dspA mutants after
nitrogen starvation
An nblS mutant of Synechococcus 7942 shows a pronounced phenotype under nitrogen starvation. In the
wild-type, cells gradually lose their photosynthetic pigments under these conditions. However, an nblS mutant
is bleached to a much lesser extent, retaining its

phycobilisomes in particular [21]. We therefore looked at
the pigmentation of our Synechocystis 6803 mutants during growth in modified BG11 medium supplemented
with glucose (to help maintain the viability of the cells),
but containing no NaNO3.
After three days nitrogen starvation in moderate light (80
µmol m-2 s-1), the wild-type and the dspA and pta single
mutants were almost completely bleached (Table 2). We
could detect no significant differences (less than 5%) in
the rate of bleaching during nitrogen starvation in the
three strains (data not shown). By contrast, the pta/dspA
double mutant retained significant levels of pigment
(Table 2). Both the chlorophyll and phycocyanin per cell
dropped somewhat compared to the start of the treatment, but loss of phycocyanin was much greater (Table
2). Thus only the pta/dspA double mutant shows a 'nonbleaching like' phenotype: Chlorophyll concentration
decreases by a factor of about two and that of phycocyanin
by about five. Figure 3 shows low-temperature fluorescence emission spectra for the pta/dspA double mutant
grown after 3 days nitrogen starvation. Whether with or
without nitrate, it exhibits a similar spectrum meaning
that the starved cells retain both PSI and PSII. The starved
pta-/dspA- cells also retained significant levels of oxygen

evolution (data not shown). Thus the pta/dspA double
mutant retains its photosynthetic apparatus during nitrogen starvation, in contrast to the wild-type and both single
mutants, where nearly all pigment is lost.

Discussion
A potential new sensor domain in DspA/Ycf26
Ycf26 may have a periplasmic sensor domain, which
could play an important role in sensing stress either
directly or indirectly (Figure 1). The putative periplasmic
sensor and PAS domain may combine to enable Ycf26 to
sense a wide variety of stress conditions [[15,17-19,21,22]
& this work]. It remains to be determined whether DspA
senses any of these signals directly or via other proteins or
phosphorelays and the precise way in which these sensor
domains interact. This apparent central role of Ycf26 in
the regulation of gene expression in response to a number
of different stresses is supported by its universal
occurrence in the 15 available cyanobacterial genome
sequences, particularly the 3 Prochlorococcus species which
only have 4–6 histidine kinases in their genome ([30], MK
Ashby & J Houmard, unpublished).
Roles of DspA and acetyl phosphate in cell signalling
We have constructed Synechocystis 6803 mutants deficient
in the pta gene coding for phosphotransacetylase and the
dspA gene coding for the DspA sensory histidine kinase
(otherwise known as Ycf26 or NblS), and a double mutant

Simplest model that fits the data for information
flow during DspA signalling. Acetyl phosphate and DspA
can both act as phosphodonors to one or more response
regulators. Under nitrogen starvation, phosphorylation by
either acetyl phosphate or DspA alone is sufficient to saturate the response. Thus pta or dspA single mutants behave
like the wild-type, and only the pta-dspA- double mutant has a
distinctive phenotype. Under other conditions the steadystate phosphorylation level of the response regulators (or
hybrid kinases) is not saturated either by acetyl phosphate or
by DspA alone. Then pta and dspA deletions have additive
effects. Both single mutants show a phenotypic change, but a
stronger effect is seen in the double mutant. RR: response

deficient in both genes. We have used the mutants to
examine the possible roles of DspA and acetyl phosphate
in controlling cell responses to nitrogen starvation. We
find strong evidence that DspA and acetyl phosphate act
cooperatively as signalling inputs into pathways controlling photosystem stoichiometry under nutrient-replete
conditions, and photosystem degradation during nitrogen starvation. Under nutrient-replete conditions, the
dspA and pta single mutants both show a decreased PSII/
PSI ratio (Figure 2). The PSII/PSI ratio becomes even
lower in the pta/dspA double mutant, indicating additive
effects of the two mutations. Since acetyl phosphate is
known to act as a phosphodonor to response regulators
[11], we propose that PSII/PSI ratio is influenced by gene
expression controlled by one or more response regulators
(or hybrid kinases) whose phosphorylation level is controlled by phosphotransfer both from DspA and from
acetyl phosphate. This scheme (in its simplest form) is
illustrated in Figure 4.
The effects seen under nitrogen starvation are even more
striking. After 3 days' nitrogen starvation under moderate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/47

light, wild-type cells are virtually devoid of pigment, indicating almost complete loss of the phycobilisomes and
the chlorophyll-protein complexes (Table 2). In this case,
the dspA and pta single mutants both behaved in the same
way as the wild-type, but the pta/dspA double mutant
retained a significant proportion of its photosynthetic
complexes, in particular the chlorophyll-protein complexes. Therefore the pta/dspA double mutant is clearly
deficient in a signalling pathway required to initiate degradation of these complexes under these conditions.
Again, we suggest that this pathway involves gene expression controlled by one or more response regulators whose
phosphorylation level is determined by phosphotransfer
from both DspA and acetyl phosphate (Figure 4). In this
case the double mutation is needed to produce a detectable phenotypic effect, suggesting that either DspA or acetyl
phosphate alone are sufficient to maintain high enough
levels of phosphorylation of the relevant response regulator(s) (Figure 4). The fact that the phenotypic difference is
seen only in the double mutant very strongly suggests that
DspA and acetyl phosphate are acting as phosphodonors
to the same response regulator(s). Again, it appears that a
high level of response regulator phosphorylation promotes the degradation of the photosynthetic complexes.
Acetyl phosphate as a potential global regulator of gene
expression in Synechocystis 6803
In E. coli the concentration of acetyl phosphate has been
shown to be dependent on the metabolic state of the cell
as well as the growth phase, carbon source, pH and temperature [8,31,32], therefore acetyl phosphate could
potentially serve as a global sensor of the physiological
state of the cell in E. coli. Acetyl phosphate is known to
phosphorylate several RR's, including CheY, NRI, PhoB
and OmpR [8]in vivo, but its ability to phosphorylate
response regulators in vivo depends on the Km of the
response regulator for acetyl phosphate, which in many
cases is too high to allow phosphorylation [33]. In the
four systems studied in one investigation of crosstalk
between two component systems, one, the Uhp system
was shown to be activated by acetyl phosphate when E.
coli is grown on pyruvate [34]. There have been no comparable studies in cyanobacteria, but it seems likely that
the level of acetyl phosphate would change in response to
physiological stress, in particular nutrient deprivation. If
this is the case, it seems likely that the Km of at least some
response regulators could be tuned to the physiological
concentrations of acetyl phosphate in Synechocystis 6803,
allowing the level of acetyl phosphate to be part of the signalling process. The level of pigment complexes in the pta
mutant was close to normal in nutrient replete conditions
(table 2), indicating that the level of acetyl phosphate is
not having an effect on overall expression of photosynthetic gene expression via a number of response regulators, but we cannot rule out that the cumulative effect of

pta- and dspA- that we observe in nutrient depleted conditions may be influenced by a reduced phosphorylation of
response regulator(s) other than those phosphorylated by
DspA.
Role of DspA in initiating degradation of photosynthetic
complexes during nutrient stress in Synechocystis 6803
NblS (DspA homologue) was originally identified in Synechococcus 7942 as a factor important for initiating the
degradation of the photosynthetic complexes (in particular the phycobilisomes) during nitrogen starvation [21].
In Synechocystis 6803 there is strong evidence for DspA as
a global regulator controlling the expression of many
genes involved in photosynthesis, carbon metabolism
and stress responses [15,17-19,21,22]. However, dspA
mutations in Synechocystis 6803 have not previously been
shown to induce a non-bleaching phenotype like that
seen in Synechococcus 7942. Here we have shown that such
a phenotype can be seen in the dspA mutant of Synechocystis 6803, provided that the pta gene is also deleted.
The phenotype is still not identical to that seen in Synechococcus 7942, however, since in Synechocystis 6803 it is
not only the degradation of the phycobilisomes which is
affected but also the degradation of chlorophyll-protein
complexes (Table 2).

Conclusion
It is clear that, under our conditions, DspA is a sensor for
nitrogen starvation in association with the level of acetyl
phosphate, leading to photosystem degradation, since
this response occurs similarly in the wild-type and in the
dspA single mutant (Table 2). However, it is unlikely to be
coincidental that non-bleaching phenotypes are associated with nblS/dspA mutations both in Synechococcus 7942
and in Synechocystis 6803. We suggest that there must be
other, as yet undetermined, conditions in which acetyl
phosphate levels in wild-type cells are low. Under such
conditions, DspA activity will become a physiologically
important factor controlling the degradation of the photosynthetic complexes. The presence of Pta in Synechocystis
6803 may reflect its more flexible metabolic lifestyle compared to other cyanobacteria.

Methods
Strain and culture conditions
All strains used are derivatives of the glucose-tolerant
strain of Synechocystis 6803 [35] and are listed in Table 1.
All strains were grown in BG-11 medium [36] supplemented with 10 mM sodium bicarbonate and 12 mM
sodium thiosulphate at 30°C in an illuminated shaking
incubator (New Brunswick) under white light. For nutrient deprivation studies, BG-11 medium lacking NaNO3
but supplemented with 5 mM glucose was used, this also
served as the wash medium. Illumination was at 80 µEm2s-1 unless otherwise indicated. Cultures for nitrogen star-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/47

vation experiments were grown in BG-11 with glucose at
a low cell density for at least 3 days prior to nitrogen starvation. Erythromycin and kanamycin were added to
media or plates when required at a final concentration 50
µg ml-1.
Sequence analysis
Deduced amino acid sequences were obtained form
Cyanobase [37], the National Centre for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) [38] and the DOE Joint Genome
Institute [39]. Protein to protein BLASTP 2.2.6/3 searches
were performed at NCBI and Cyanobase websites. Protein
sequences were analysed by Pfam [40,41], SMART [23,42]
and Interpro [43]. CLUSTALW alignments [44] were performed at the European Bioinformatics Institute [45].
Molecular biology
Routine DNA manipulations were performed as in [46]
using reagents purchased from QIAGEN, New England
Biolabs, Inc., Promega and Sigma. Genomic DNA from
Synechocystis 6803 was prepared as described by Porter
[47]. The primers used for PCR amplification of the dspA
gene had the sequences 5'-gcgagctcttctgtgtccaatccaacg and
5'-gcggtaccatggattgatacacggccag. The same primers were
used to monitor segregation in the transformant. The
primers used for PCR amplification of the pta gene had the
sequences
5'-GCGAGCTCCCTTTATTTAAGCACCACC
and 5'-GCGGTACCTTGCAAAGCTGTAATTACCACC and
were also used to monitor segregation in the transformants. Primers were purchased from Invitrogen
Technologies.
Construction of dspA and pta mutants of Synechocystis
6803
The pta open reading frame (slr2132 in the Cyanobase
database) and the dspA open reading frame (sll0698) were
amplified by PCR from Synechocystis 6803 DNA, using
primers shown above. The PCR products were cloned into
pBluescriptII KS +. The slr2132 sequence was cut at a PstI
site at position 872 in the coding sequence, and an erythromycin resistance cassette (pBSEmEco1) was ligated in.
The sll0698 sequence was cut at an EcoRI site at position
1384 in the coding sequence, and a kanamycin resistance
cassette (pUC4K) was ligated in [48,49]. Slr2132 is 265 bp
downstream of slr1888 and it is probably transcribed on
an mRNA encoding only Pta, so its interruption should
not have any polar effects. Sll0698 is upstream of two
putative transposases sll0699 and sll0700. The glucosetolerant strain of Synechocystis 6803 was transformed with
the slr2132::EmR construct as described by Porter [47].
After several rounds of growth on erythromycin plates,
PCR was used to check the insertion. This confirmed that
the wild-type slr2132 locus had been completely replaced
by the slr2132::EmR locus, and hence that the pta gene had
been completely inactivated generating a fully-segregated

pta mutant. A similar procedure was followed with the
sll0698::KmR construct, which was used to transform both
the wild-type and the pta mutant, to generate a sll0698
single insertional mutant (dspA) and a sll0698:slr2132
double insertional mutant (pta/dspA). These mutants were
shown to have segregated after six rounds of streaking to
single colonies on kanamycin (plus erythromycin for pta
double mutants) plates as has been observed by Hsiao et
al. [22], though without glucose in this work.
Procedure for initiating nutrient deprivation
50 ml cultures were grown to mid-log phase in BG11
medium. Each culture was then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of wash medium, harvested a
second time and resuspended in 10 ml of BG11 medium
supplemented with glucose but lacking NaNO3. This was
then divided into two 5 ml portions, which were then
used to inoculate parallel 20 ml cultures.
Pigment content analysis
Fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 77 K in a
Perkin-Elmer LS50 luminescence spectrometer equipped
with a liquid-nitrogen sample holder. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in growth
medium to a chlorophyll a concentration of 5 µM [28].
Re-absorption of emitted fluorescence was negligible at
the cell concentrations used. The samples were not mixed
with glycerol, as this alters the low temperature fluorescence emission spectrum [29]. The samples were then
injected into silica tubes (2 mm internal diameter) and
dark adapted for 5 minutes. Samples were rapidly frozen
by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Excitation and emission
slit widths were 5 nm. Chlorophyll a was excited at 435
nm: light at this wavelength is not significantly absorbed
by the phycobilisomes [50]. Chlorophyll a concentration
was estimated from the absorption of methanol extracts at
665 nm [51]. Spectra from different samples were normalised to the PSI peak (emission at 725 nm). Cell absorption
spectra were recorded with an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. The concentrations of chlorophyll and phycocyanin were estimated from the spectra using the
equations of Myers et al. [27]. Cell numbers were estimated from the optical density at 750 nm, calibrated
using a hemocytometer.
