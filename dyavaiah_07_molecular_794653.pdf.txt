Abstract
Background: To characterize Fusarium isolates from recent cases of fungal keratitis in contact lens
wearers, and to investigate fungal association with MoistureLoc solution.
Methods: We studied six fungal isolates from recent cases of keratitis in New York State. The isolates
were characterized by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of multiple genes, and then typed
using minisatellite and microsatellite probes. Experimental fungal biofilm formation was tested by standard
methods. MoistureLoc solutions were tested in biofouling studies for their efficacy in elimination of
Fusarium contamination.
Results: Fusarium solani – corneal ulcers (2 isolates), lens case (1 isolate), and F. oxysporum – corneal ulcer
(1 isolate), eye (1 isolate), were recovered from five patients. An opened bottle of MoistureLoc solution
provided by a patient also yielded F. solani. Two distinct genotypes of F. solani as well as of F. oxysporum
were present in the isolated strains. Remarkably, F. solani strains from the lens case and lens solution in
one instance were similar, based on phylogenetic analyses and molecular typing. The solution isolate of F.
solani formed biofilm on contact lenses in control conditions, but not when co-incubated with MoistureLoc
solution. Both freshly opened and 3-month old MoistureLoc solutions effectively killed F. solani and F.
oxysporum, when fungal contamination was simulated under recommended lens treatment regimen (4-hr).
However, simulation of inappropriate use (15 – 60 min) led to the recovery of less than 1% of original
inoculum of F. solani or F. oxysporum.
Conclusion: Temporary survival of F. solani and F. oxysporum in MoistureLoc suggested that improper lens
cleaning regimen could be a possible contributing factor in recent infections.

Background
Fungal keratitis due to filamentous fungi is quite common
in tropical parts of the world and the southeastern United
States [1-3]. Farmers and workers in agro-industries are
most at risk for these infections, due to occupation-related
corneal abrasions and subsequent fungal infections. In
temperate regions, fungal keratitis is most commonly
caused by the yeast Candida albicans, although mold keratitis due to Fusarium is being increasingly recognized [46]. Contact lens wearers have an elevated risk for fungal
keratitis, but the incidence of Fusarium keratitis is quite
rare among this group of patients [7-9]. There has been no
report until the beginning of 2006, on the association of
multipurpose contact lens solutions with fungal keratitis.
An upsurge in Fusarium keratitis among contact lens wearers was first noticed in 2005 by public health authorities
in Singapore. Subsequently, 66 patients were identified
from March 2005-February 2006; the characteristics in
common among these patients were the use of ReNu with
MoistureLoc solution and poor lens hygiene [10]. Two
recent reports described a noticeable increase in Fusarium
keratitis in contact lens wearers in the US, in the San Francisco Bay Area and in southern Florida [11,12]. A more
comprehensive report has documented 176 cases of Fusarium keratitis in 164 patients from various regions in the
US [13]. The investigators found significant use of MoistureLoc solution among 45 case patients in their series.
Interestingly, they did not recover any Fusarium isolate
through extensive sampling of lens solutions from the
patients, or from environmental sampling of the plant
where the solution was manufactured. Thus, the underlying causes of this perplexing outbreak remain elusive. We
investigated recent fungal keratitis cases from New York
State including the first case in which Fusarium was isolated from MoistureLoc solution being used by a patient.
We also carried out experimental studies with Fusarium
isolates in attempts to understand why these infections
were associated with the use of MoistureLoc solution.

Methods
Mycology
Five Fusarium isolates, recovered from patients' corneal
ulcers, contact lenses, or contact lens cases by hospital laboratories in New York and New Jersey, were forwarded to

the Mycology Laboratory at the Wadsworth Center (Table
1). These isolates were studied in detail for their colony
and microscopic characteristics [14,15]. An opened container of MoistureLoc solution being used by a patient for
approximately three-months was also submitted for evaluation. An aliquot of this solution was directly plated on
Sabouraud's dextrose agar supplemented with antibiotics
(chloramphenicol 25 μg/ml, gentamicin 40 μg/ml) for
fungal recovery, and the solution was centrifuged at 5000
rpm for 15 min to recover fungi from the pellet and the
supernatant, by plating on culture medium. Additional
unopened bottles of MoistureLoc solution were procured
from local pharmacies in Albany and New York City
before the global recall of this product by the manufacturer. These solutions were processed for fungal testing at
the Wadsworth Center and the New York Eye and Ear
Infirmary.
Molecular characterization
Specific identifications and typing of Fusarium isolates
were done by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. Fungal
DNA extraction involved grinding mycelia in a pestle and
mortar under liquid nitrogen, suspending the slurry in
lysis buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 250 mM NaCl, 25
mM EDTA, 0.5%SDS), extraction with phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol, and ethanol precipitation [16].
Fungal ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers 1 and
2 (ITS1, ITS2) and nuclear 28S rRNA [17], and Fusariumspecific partial β-tubulin and elongation factor (EF-1α)
genes were amplified with published primers [18]. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR amplicons was done on both
strands according to the standard methods [19]. Nucleotide sequences were manually edited and compared
against the NCBI database and Fusarium database at the
Pennsylvania State University [20]. These sequences have
been deposited in the GenBank under Accession Numbers
DQ852626 – DQ852630 and DQ813505 – DQ813508.
Percentage of nucleotide identity among various genes
was compared by ClustalW (v1.4) multiple alignment,
using MacVector 7.1.1 software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA).
Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences were done
with the PAUP v4 program using a bootstrap method with
a Neighbor-Joining or Maximum Parsimony search [21].

Molecular typing of Fusarium isolates was carried out
using two random probes: a 15-bp minisatellite probe
from M13 bacteriophage [22] and a simple DNA repeat
(GACA)4 probe [23]. These probes were chosen given that
they have been widely used to discriminate between
related strains of a variety of pathogenic microorganisms.
Three laboratory isolates- F. oxysporum 163-05 (corneal
ulcer), F. oxysporum 974-05 (finger nail) and F. solani
1064-05 (corneal ulcer), unrelated to this outbreak, were
used as outliers to check robustness of the two genotyping
methods. Single M13 (5' GAGGGTGGCGGTTCT 3') and
(GACA)4 primers were used in PCR reaction. PCR reaction
volume of 50 μl included 5 μl of 10 × PCR buffer with 15
mM MgCl2, 3.0 μl dNTP mix (10 μmol/L each), 30 ng
primer, 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Foster
City, CA, USA). Initial denaturation was at 94°C for 20
sec, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20
sec, annealing at 50°C for 1 min, amplification at 72°C
for 20 sec and final extension 72°C for 4 min, in a
GenAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin Elmer). PCR products
were concentrated to 20 μl and resolved by electrophoresis on 1.4% agarose gels in Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer,
and were detected by ethidium bromide staining [24].
Biofilm analysis
Microbial biofilms are an important potential source of
infectious propagules in keratitis [25,26]. Therefore, the
ability of the Fusarium isolates to form biofilms in the laboratory was tested with etafilcon A contact lenses (ACUVUE®, Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc.) using a
published procedure [25]. Briefly, F. solani 238-06 was
grown on Sabouraud's dextrose agar slants for 5 days, and
the conidia harvested in sterile distilled water. Fungal
inoculum comprised of conidial suspension adjusted to 1
× 104 cells/ml with a hemacytometer. A balanced salt solution (0.49 g NaCl, 0.075 g KCl, 0.048 g CaCl2, 0.03 g
MgCl2, 0.39 g sodium acetate {CH3COONa}, 0.17 g
sodium citrate {HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2}, dissolved in 100 ml deionized water, and filter sterilized)
was used to promote biofilm formation [25]. Five ml balanced salt solution aliquots were transferred to 25-ml
flasks. Half of the flasks received sterile, fresh, ACUVUE
contact lens and 10 μl of the fungal inoculum. The other
flasks received contact lens, fungal inoculum and 1.0 ml
MoistureLoc. The negative control was balanced salt solution with contact lens but no fungal inoculum. The flasks
were incubated for 48 h at 25°C on a rotator (180 rpm).
Some lenses from flasks with balanced salt solution and
fungal inoculum but no MoistureLoc were removed at the
end of incubation, treated with MoistureLoc for 4 h and
processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
contact lenses were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 h,
and dehydrated in 25–100% ethanol. Dehydrated lenses
were critical point dried, coated with gold particles and
examined in SEM as described previously [19].

Experimental biofouling
A previous report indicated that the time elapsed since
opening and the storage conditions significantly affected
the efficacy of the multipurpose contact lens solutions
[27]. We designed a biofouling study based on earlier
publications to test for efficacy of MoistureLoc solutions
against Fusarium isolates [28,29]. MoistureLoc solutions,
purchased from local pharmacies before the global recall
of this product, were inoculated with freshly grown Fusarium to test for survival and growth. Both sterile glass test
tubes (20 × 150 mm) and commercial lens cases (Sight
Savers®, Bausch & Lomb, Inc.) were used in these experiments. F. solani 238-06 and F. oxysporum 158-06, from 4–
5 day old slants of Sabouraud's dextrose agar, were suspended in sterile distilled water. The suspension comprised mostly of conidia with rare hyphal fragments. The
conidia were counted using a hemacytometer, and
adjusted to a final density of 1 × 104 – 107 cells/ml. Ten
microliters of these suspensions were used to inoculate
1.0 ml of MoistureLoc. The mix was incubated unstirred at
23° – 25°C for various intervals, and 100 μl aliquots were
spread on Sabouraud's dextrose agar plates after 15, 30, 60
and 240 min. The positive control included fungal inoculum suspended in sterile water without MoistureLoc. The
inoculated plates were incubated at 25°C for 48 – 72 h
and fungal colonies counted and photographed. [28,29].
The biofouling experiments were repeated 5 times.

Results
Mycology
MoistureLoc solution, provided by a patient, was positive
for Fusarium species, and quantification of fungal load
revealed approximately 50 colonies/ml (figure 1a). Furthermore, the supernatant, and not the pellet from the
contaminated solution yielded the fungus (figure 1b). The
finding was consistent with moderate recovery of fungal
colonies from this solution. Characterization of the morphology and spores of the MoistureLoc isolate (238-06)
showed it to most closely resemble F. solani. Mycological
investigations of five patient isolates also showed them to
be either F. solani or F. oxysporum (Table 1).
Molecular characterization
Total of five genes including ITS1, ITS2, 28S rRNA, βTubulin, and EF-1α were used for confirmation of Fusarium species (GenBank Accession Numbers DQ852626 –
DQ852630 and DQ813505 – DQ813508). Of these
genes, sequences from ITS1, ITS2, and EF-1α possessed
enough polymorphism, and therefore, were excellent
marker with 99–100% accuracy for the identification of
Fusarium species to be either F. solani or F. oxysporum species complex in the NCBI and Fusarium databases (hereafter referred as F. solani and F. oxysporum). On the contrary,
sequences from 28S and β-tubulin genes were highly conserved and therefore, these were only of limited use in fur-

ther delineation of Fusarium species. Multiple alignments
of EF-1α sequences of Fusarium species revealed significant polymorphism between F. solani and F. oxysporum
with 68–73% identity. Within F. solani species, three
strains 23-06 (DQ813507), 237-06 (DQ813506), and
238-06 (DQ813505) exhibited 100% sequence identity
and showed 92% and 84% identities with strains 1064-05
(DQ852626), and 24-06 (DQ813508), respectively. Similarly, within F. oxysporum species, four strains namely
158-05 (DQ852627), 159-06 (DQ852628.), 163-05
(DQ852629), and 974-05 (DQ852630) exhibited small
variation in their EF-1α sequences with 93–95% identity.
Phylogenetic analysis of various gene fragments amplified
from these isolates showed distinct clades of F. solani and
F. oxysporum in the test group. Two unrelated strains of F.
oxysporum (163-05, 974-05) and one F. solani strain
(1064-05), used as controls in these studies, also segregated into distinct clades. A representative phylogram
from EF-1α gene fragment is shown in figure 2. Subsequent molecular typing with M13 and (GACA)4 primers
generated genotypic patterns that permitted distinct
groupings of the test strains (figure 3). Two distinct genotypes of F. solani as well as of F. oxysporum were present in
the isolated strains. F. solani strain 24-06 genotype was
easily separated from the other three strains (23-06, 23706, and 238-06). F. solani from contact lens case (237-06)
and from MoistureLoc solution (238-06) showed similar
genotypes, by the two probes. In contrast, F. oxysporum
strains 158-06 and 159-06 yielded two different genotypes. The control F. oxysporum (163-05, 974-05) and F.
solani (1064-05) genotypes were distinct.

method with a Neighbor-Joining or Maximum Parsimony
search [21]. The numbers on the branches indicate percent
bootstrap values, based on 1000 replicates. Three distinct
clades were seen in both the F. oxysporum and the F. solani
strains. The six strains from our investigation came from five
different patients: 23-06 (corneal ulcer), 24-06 (contact lens),
158-06 (right eye), 159-06 (corneal ulcer left eye), 237-06
and 238-06 (contact lens case swab and contact lens cleaning
solution from the same patient). Three outlier controls were
F. oxysporum (163-05) and F. solani (1064-05), previously isolated from unrelated keratitis cases, and F. oxysporum (97405) isolated from finger nail.

Molecular typing of Fusarium isolates

genotypes. The control F. oxysporum (163-05, 974-05) and F. solani (1064-05) genotypes were distinct. The lane assignments for

salt solution (figure 4). Biofilms did not form when contact lenses were incubated in balanced salt solution +
MoistureLoc solution. Further, if a biofilm was allowed to
form in the salt solution, the treatment with the MoistureLoc sufficed to destroy the biofilm (figure 4c). Similar
negative results were obtained when patient isolates were
tested for their ability to form biofilms in presence or
absence of MoistureLoc (data not shown). Preliminary
tests with MoistureLoc suggested that F. solani (238-06)
did not survive or grow in shaken cultures kept for 7 days
at 30°C (data not shown). Different batches of MoistureLoc solutions, procured from local pharmacies before the
global recall of this product by the manufacturer, also
tested sterile in our hands. MoistureLoc solutions effectively killed F. solani (238-06) and F. oxysporum (158-06)
upon experimental inoculation, provided that the recommended length of treatment, 4-hr, was used. Further studies designed to simulate inappropriate cleaning revealed
that approximately 25 colonies of F. solani (0.02%) and
700 colonies of F. oxysporum (0.59%) could be recovered
after 60 min from the initial 100,000 colony forming
units (CFU) used for inoculation of MoistureLoc solution
(figures 5, 6). The remaining four test strains also yielded
similar survival patterns in these experiments (details not
shown). There was no appreciable difference in fungal

survival rates, between glass tubes and lens cases used as
container for interactions. Similarly, there was no difference in survival pattern between freshly opened MoistureLoc solution and solutions opened 3-months earlier, in
these experiments.

Discussion
Among the significant findings of our study was the recovery of similar F. solani strains from the MoistureLoc solution and from the contact lens case of a patient. To our
knowledge, this is the first instance of matched isolations
of any Fusarium strain connected with recent cases of fungal keratitis in contact lens wearers [10,13]. However,
only one additional isolate of F. solani, among the four
that we studied, shared this genotype. Also, two F. oxysporum strains in this study showed two distinct genotypes.
These observations, although limited suggested that it is
unlikely that common or clonal strains were the cause of
the infections. This conclusion agrees with the findings of
the report about the presence of multiple genotypes of F.
solani and F. oxysporum in keratitis cases in contact lens
wearers in the US [13]. The population make-up of a few
F. solani isolates from Singapore and Hong Kong also
showed mixed genotypes, albeit with one population predominating; the latter was common in both locales. More

Summary of experimental biofouling studies
Summary of experimental biofouling studies. The experimental biofouling studies were carried out by introducing 1 ×

comprehensive studies are indicated to rule out the presence of 'hypervirulent clones' as the cause of recent keratitis cases. It could be pertinent that a number of other
investigators have pointed out that clinical strains of
Fusarium are generally a mix of genotypes of plant and
environmental origin [13,20,30,31].
It was reasonable to suspect that devices such as contact
lenses or lens cases are important in the etiology of these
infections. In fact, the storage cases are reported to pose an
independent risk factor for biofilm formation in mycotic
keratitis [26]. We did not receive any relevant specimens
for mycology and/or microscopy that would have enabled
us to further investigate this aspect. Our limited experimental analyses indicated that both F. solani and F. oxysporum strains were capable of forming biofilms on these
devices under permissive conditions, but not in presence
of or after recommended treatment with MoistureLoc

solution. Based on this evidence, we suggest that the possible sources of Fusarium in keratitis patients are unlikely
to include contact lenses or lens cases when MoistureLoc
solution is properly used. However, further studies are
indicated to examine if contaminated lenses or lens cases
could still be important sources of infections independent
of lens cleaning regimen.
Our recovery of F. solani from MoistureLoc solution provided by a patient, taken with the previous report of a
strong association between MoistureLoc solution and
keratitis cases, led us to evaluate the scenarios in which
the efficacy of this multipurpose solution would be compromised. We found that MoistureLoc solution completely sterilized F. solani and F. oxysporum
contaminations as long as recommended 4-hr treatment
regimen was followed. These observations were consistent
with the conclusions of many other reports about the

overall efficacy of various multipurpose solutions against
fungi [28,29]. However, it has been documented that the
efficacy of cleaning solutions depends on the storage temperature and the time elapsed after opening of the container [27]. Both of these variables were examined to a
limited extent in our study; our experiments were carried
out with freshly opened containers and with containers
opened roughly 3-months earlier with storage at room
temperature. Again, no appreciable differences in efficacy
were noticed between fresh and aged solutions, experimentally inoculated with F. solani and F. oxysporum. The
simulation of inappropriate usage of MoistureLoc solution yielded positive growth up to 60 min with F. oxysporum being 30-fold more resistant than F. solani. These
results suggested that at least some occurrences of keratitis
could result from temporary contamination and/or inadequate cleansing with MoistureLoc solution.

Genetics Core Facility of the Wadsworth Center performed nucleotide
sequencing. We thank the three referees for constructive criticisms and
suggestions.

Conclusion

9.

Temporary survival of F. solani and F. oxysporum in MoistureLoc suggested that improper lens cleaning regimen
could be a possible contributing factor in recent infections.
