Abstract
Background: Alignment and comparison of related genome sequences is a powerful method to
identify regions likely to contain functional elements. Such analyses are data intensive, requiring the
inclusion of genomic multiple sequence alignments, sequence annotations, and scores describing
regional attributes of columns in the alignment. Visualization and browsing of results can be difficult,
and there are currently limited software options for performing this task.
Results: The Application for Browsing Constraints (ABC) is interactive Java software for intuitive
and efficient exploration of multiple sequence alignments and data typically associated with
alignments. It is used to move quickly from a summary view of the entire alignment via arbitrary
levels of resolution to individual alignment columns. It allows for the simultaneous display of
quantitative data, (e.g., sequence similarity or evolutionary rates) and annotation data (e.g. the
locations of genes, repeats, and constrained elements). It can be used to facilitate basic comparative
sequence tasks, such as export of data in plain-text formats, visualization of phylogenetic trees, and
generation of alignment summary graphics.
Conclusions: The ABC is a lightweight, stand-alone, and flexible graphical user interface for
browsing genomic multiple sequence alignments of specific loci, up to hundreds of kilobases or a
few megabases in length. It is coded in Java for cross-platform use and the program and source code
are freely available under the General Public License. Documentation and a sample data set are also
available http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads.html.

Background
Functional elements in a genome accumulate inter-specific substitutions more slowly than neutral DNA
throughout evolution [1]. Therefore, comparing orthologous genomic sequences from related species is useful for
the identification of elements that play important roles in
the biology of an organism [2-7]. While the statistical and
computational methods for extracting comparative information are variable, the types of data involved are gener-

ally quite similar. First, a multiple sequence alignment is
necessary. Second, a vector of quantitative scores is produced that describes the similarity of the nucleotides
observed in small windows, or individual columns, of the
alignment; percent identity is the metric used by the popular program VISTA [8], while a variety of other scoring
methods also exist [9-12]. Third, annotations are generated that highlight regions of the alignment that are under
constraint or meet some other quantitative threshold.

Fourth, annotations of features like transcripts, promoters, coding exons, and repeats provide functional context.
Finally, the phylogenetic tree that relates the aligned
sequences is important for both performing comparative
analyses and for interpreting their results.
Simultaneous visualization of complex data such as these
is of utmost importance both for experimentalists and for
computational biologists. Several options currently exist
for such visualization, but there are a variety of characteristics that distinguish the ABC from them. VISTA, for
example, generates a static image that is not interactive
[8]. Other popular browsers such as phylo-VISTA [13] and
PipMaker [14,15] require the use of a particular alignment
program and scoring scheme. Also, the ABC is not suited
for genome-wide visualization. Other tools exist for this
and are quite useful for the browsing of very large
genomic intervals and major evolutionary events such as
genomic rearrangements [16-19]. However, these programs are generally part of larger, more complex interfaces
that are not necessarily ideal for targeted analysis of an
individual alignment or genomic locus. Finally, we note
that the ABC allows many annotation types and colors, is
not web-based and can be used on a local machine as
intensively as necessary, and the source code is open and
freely available allowing users to modify and add features
if desired.

Implementation
The ABC requires Java 1.4 or later and has been successfully tested on Windows, Linux, and OS X. There is no specific upper limit in the size of potential data sets, but
system memory usage can be high on large alignments.
The ABC can efficiently handle a 2 Mb alignment of 29
sequences on a machine with a 1 GHz processor and 1 Gb
of RAM. Details about file formats and instructions for use
are available in the documentation that is available along
with the source code http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidow
lab/downloads.html. The file formats used by the ABC are
quite similar, with only minor modifications, to other
standard formats, such as fasta-formatted sequence files
and standard parenthesis notation for phylogenetic tree
descriptions. A sample data set is available, and is the
source of the screenshot depicted in Figure 1. The
sequence data are derived from a previously published
analysis [20]; it includes ~300 kb of sequence from 9
mammals, centered around the ST7 gene in the human
genome, near the CFTR gene. Repeats were identified in
the human sequence using RepeatMasker [21] and genes
identified using RefSeq annotations from the UCSC
genome browser [17]. The alignment was generated using
MLAGAN [22], and has been compressed so that the
human sequence is ungapped; annotation of human
sequence features is thus identical to the alignment annotations shown in Figure 1. A description of the method

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/192

used to score the alignment columns and identify constrained elements, along with Perl scripts that facilitate
this method, including export of results in ABC-ready formats, will be described elsewhere (in preparation). Please
note that the ABC will not translate coordinates from
alignment to sequence coordinates (or vice versa); the
annotations that the user supplies must be appropriate to
the alignment being analyzed.

Results and discussion
By default, the ABC displays graphical summaries of the
quantitative information associated with the alignment.
Scores are summarized regionally in consecutive nonoverlapping windows. The size of these windows depends
on the resolution, defined as the number of alignment
columns summarized per pixel. The ABC has three distinct display modes, chosen automatically depending on
the density of the information. At very low resolution, a
histogram is displayed that plots the number of data
points in each window that are at or below a specified
value; note that regions containing many low scores will
stand out as peaks in the histogram, as demonstrated by
the clear association of peaks and the location of exons
(Figure 1, top panel). At intermediate resolutions, a 'wiggly plot' is displayed, in which the average score for each
regional window is plotted; in this case, regions containing many low scores will appear as valleys in the plot (Figure 1; middle panels). Finally, at very high resolution, the
user may view the sequence data directly, along with the
sequence names and a tree relating the sequences (Figure
1; lower panel).
A mobile and scalable zoom window allows for exploration of the summary views (Figure 1; upper panels). The
user may drag and resize this rectangle, and when a
desired region is selected a more detailed view can be
obtained. This region will be expanded immediately
below the parent display, with the resolution, score plot,
and annotation adjusted accordingly (Figure 1; compare
the start and stop coordinates of the black rectangle in the
top panel to the start and stop coordinates of the entire
panel immediately below). At all resolutions, annotation
tracks are displayed immediately above the score/
sequence display (Figure 1; all panels). An arbitrary
number of tracks may be displayed, but the bottom two
tracks are reserved for displaying information about transcripts with exons and introns. Colors for features can be
specified individually using standard RGB notation.
Other key features of the ABC include:
• Mouse-over highlighting to reveal annotations, scores,
coordinates, etc
• Exporting of sequence, score, and annotation data

Figure 1
A screenshot of the ABC
A screenshot of the ABC. The upper-most panel consists of a histogram describing the regional density of columns with low
scores, corresponding to regions of high sequence similarity, across the length of the entire alignment. Note the association of
peaks in sequence similarity near the exons annotated in the lowest tracks ('Trx 1' and 'Trx 2'). The middle panels consist of
'wiggly plots' of the alignment scores; note the association in these panels between valleys in the plot and the location of exons.
The black rectangle can be moved and resized to highlight particular regions. The panels represent increasingly zoomed in
views of the regions highlighted within the rectangle, moving from 348 alignment columns per pixel at the top to 4 positions
per pixel in the third panel. The bottom panel shows a view of individual alignment columns corresponding to a small region of
the alignment. If supplied, a topology describing the relationships of the aligned sequences is also displayed here. Above all panels, four annotation tracks are displayed, the bottom two being reserved for transcripts with exons and introns. In this image,
the third and fourth tracks reveal conserved regions and repeats, respectively.

• Searching sequence data for particular nucleotide strings

Operating system: Platform independent

• GoTo feature to quickly bring up a desired region

Programming language: Java

The ABC is flexible in that is has the ability to visualize
diverse quantitative information and it has the capacity to
display an arbitrary number of annotation types. It does
not have a built-in scoring function; all data needs to be
generated and formatted prior to being displayed in the
ABC. While this may seem to be a drawback, it is in fact
the intended function for an interface that has no preconceptions about the methodology that generated the data.
Finally, the ABC is interactive, allowing the user to zoom
in quickly from summary views of the comparative data to
individual alignment columns. Zoom levels remain in the
display, allowing the user to keep a birds-eye view of a
large genomic region while focusing at much higher resolution on a small section within it.

Other requirements: Java 1.4 or later

Conclusions

RGB: Red-Green-Blue

The ABC is stand-alone alignment browsing software that
is relatively easy to use and customize. While it was not
designed as a genome-wide browser, it is well-suited for
tasks associated with comparative sequence analysis:
exploration of alignments of individual genomic loci;
analyzing the relationship between known biological features and quantitative comparative data; visualizing
results for researchers who develop and test methods for
comparative sequence analysis; isolating sequence elements in a genomic locus for downstream applications
like motif-discovery or primer design; generating graphics
that characterize a multiple sequence alignment or region
of an alignment; and potentially more applications that
we have not yet considered. In our own research, for
example, we have used it to display SNPs between different mouse strains in the context of a comparative alignment (not shown). This flexibility should be beneficial to
researchers whose primary interest is comparative
sequence analysis, but should also be valuable to those
who use comparative analyses in support of other types of
projects, such as experimental characterization of constrained elements. We also note that this flexibility distinguishes the ABC from other browsers that require built-in
or specific types of score data and/or the use of a particular
alignment program. The software is written in Java for
cross-platform support, and the source code is freely available under the General Public License (GPL).
