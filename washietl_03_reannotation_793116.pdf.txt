Abstract
Background: The genome of the avian adenovirus Chicken Embryo Lethal Orphan (CELO) has
two terminal regions without detectable homology in mammalian adenoviruses that are left
without annotation in the initial analysis. Since adenoviruses have been a rich source of new insights
into molecular cell biology and practical applications of CELO as gene a delivery vector are being
considered, this genome appeared worth revisiting. We conducted a systematic reannotation and
in-depth sequence analysis of the CELO genome.
Results: We describe a strongly diverged paralogous cluster including ORF-2, ORF-12, ORF-13,
and ORF-14 with an ATPase/helicase domain most likely acquired from adeno-associated
parvoviruses. None of these ORFs appear to have retained ATPase/helicase function and
alternative functions (e.g. modulation of gene expression during the early life-cycle) must be
considered in an adenoviral context. Further, we identified a cluster of three putative type-1transmembrane glycoproteins with IG-like domains (ORF-9, ORF-10, ORF-11) which are good
candidates to substitute for the missing immunomodulatory functions of mammalian adenoviruses.
ORF-16 (located directly adjacent) displays distant homology to vertebrate mono-ADPribosyltransferases. Members of this family are known to be involved in immuno-regulation and
similiar functions during CELO life cycle can be considered for this ORF. Finally, we describe a
putative triglyceride lipase (merged ORF-18/19) with additional domains, which can be expected to
have specific roles during the infection of birds, since they are unique to avian adenoviruses and
Marek's disease-like viruses, a group of pathogenic avian herpesviruses.
Conclusions: We could characterize most of the previously unassigned ORFs pointing to
functions in host-virus interaction. The results provide new directives for rationally designed
experiments.

Background
Chicken embryo lethal orphan virus (CELO) is an adenovirus infecting avian species [1,2]. It is a member of the
genus Aviadenovirus and also referred to as Fowl Adenovi-

rus 1 (FAdV-1). Compared to mammalian and, in particular, human adenoviruses of the genus Mastadenovirus,
which have been studied extensively over the years
(reviewed in [3]), relatively little information is available

on avian adenoviruses. In 1996, CELO was the first virus
of this group to be completely sequenced [4].
The analysis of the sequence revealed that the central portion of the 43.8 kb long, double-stranded, linear DNA
genome is organized similar to mammalian adenoviruses.
Genes for the major structural proteins (e.g. IIIa, hexon,
penton base) as well as crucial functional proteins (e.g.
DNA-polymerase, protease) are well conserved with
respect to amino acid sequence and location. However,
the important E1A, E1B, E3 and E4 regions, mainly
responsible for host cell interaction and immune modulation/evasion in mammalian adenoviruses, could not be
identified. Instead, two unique terminal regions of about
6 kb and 12 kb rich in open reading frames with no
homologs in mammalian adenoviruses could be found.
This surprising result suggests that the basic properties of
the replication cycle are similar in both groups whereas
they encode a completely different set of proteins for host
interaction. Only a few of these proteins have been functionally characterized so far.
ORF-1 is significantly homologous to dUTP-pyrophosphatases and was reported to have this enzymatic activity
[4]. ORF-1 is the only sequence in the terminal regions
which has homologs in mastadenoviruses (ORF-1 of early
region 4). In human adenovirus 9, this protein has
growth-transforming properties and is an important
oncogenic determinant [5].
ORF-8, which has been designated Gam1, is probably the
most intriguing protein found in CELO. Originally identified as a novel antiapoptotic protein [6] and further
shown to induce heat shock response necessary for replication [7], it is now known to influence host gene expression by inactivation of histone deacetylase 1 [4,8,9].
Together with another unique protein (ORF-22), Gam1
influences also the pRb/E2F pathway crucial for cell-cycle
progression. Both proteins bind pRb and, thus, act as
functional analogs of the prominent adenoviral E1A protein [10].
For the rest of the unique ORFs, experimental data is
sparse if available at all. Mutational studies found most of
them to be dispensable for viral replication under different experimental settings [11,12]. In an attempt to characterize the transcriptional organisation of CELO, the
corresponding RNAs for some of the ORFs together with
their expression kinetics could be identified [13]. However, the functions of these proteins during the viral life
cycle are still completely unknown. Since they are thought
to be implicated in such critical areas of biology as for
example cell cycle control and immune response to viral
infections, these proteins are of special interest. Moreover,
CELO has been considered for use as a gene delivery vec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/55

tor with promising features for both human gene therapy
and vaccination applications in aviculture [11,12,14]. A
better understanding of CELO biology could help to promote such applications.
In this contribution, we report a complete, systematic, indepth sequence analysis of all potential coding sequences
in the CELO genome. Applying a relevant subset of the
most advanced analyzing methods available at present,
we determined the molecular architecture of the putative
proteins and uncovered distant homologies, evolutionary
relationships and possible molecular and cellular functions. If available, we also analyzed homologous
sequences of closely related avian adenoviruses. These are
(i) Fowl Adenovirus 9 (FAdV-9, formerly known in literature as FAdV-8) [15-17], (ii) strain CFA40, a hypervirulent
variant of FAdV-9 [18] and (iii) FAdV-10. For FAdV-9, the
complete genomic sequence is available, for CFA40 and
FAdV-10 only fragments of the nucleic acid sequence are
known. We anticipate that our results will stimulate experimental studies of CELO ORFs with newly assigned
molecular and/or cellular functions.

Results
Refinement and analysis of potential coding regions
The complete CELO sequence has been analyzed upon its
initial sequencing [4]. In the central region ranging from
approximately nt 6000 to 31000, most of the ORFs could
be reliably assigned to proteins that have been previously
described for mastadenoviruses. In the terminal regions
(appr. nt 0–6000 and 31000–43804) no sequence similarity to known adenoviral sequences could be detected
on the nucleic acid or protein level. Originally, 22 potential protein coding sequences were proposed to reside in
the unique terminal regions [4]. They have found their
way into public databases and are referred to throughout
literature. Those putative proteins are exclusively ORFs
which are longer than 99 amino acids and start with a
methionine. This is a rather arbitrary approach and, since
also the experimental studies fall short in detecting and
characterizing all RNAs of these regions [13], we had to
refine the prediction of protein coding regions in order
not to miss important information due to wrong conceptual translations. We did a complete retranslation of the
genome in all six frames also considering ORFs shorter
than 99 amino acids and without a starting methionine,
we further compared the potential coding regions to the
related avian adenoviruses, especially to the complete
genome of FAdV-9, and integrated all available experimental data [13,15-17] as well as the results of our subsequent protein sequence analysis. Table 1 and Fig. 1 list the
most likely coding regions that could be identified. If possible, we adhere to the nomenclature introduced by Chiocca et al. [4].

Figure 1
Coding regions in the terminal segments of the CELO genome
Coding regions in the terminal segments of the CELO genome. The 15 ORFs listed in Table 1, representing the most likely
protein coding regions, are indicated. ORFs being transcribed from the forward and reverse strand are shown above or below
the bold line representing the double-stranded DNA, respectively. Open lines denote ORFs without a start codon in the
genomic sequence. ORF-1, ORF-8 and ORF-22 are annotated based on experimental results. The detailed annotation and
results of the sequence analysis for all other ORFs are described in the text and Fig. 3.

In four cases (ORF-12, ORF-14, ORF-20, ORF-18/19) the
translation of the ORFs was extended in the amino terminus mainly because of significant similarity to homologous sequences in FAdV-9 and CFA40 or the existence of
known domains in this extended region. ORF-18 and
ORF-19 were merged to one single ORF-18/19 for reasons
detailed in the discussion below.
Furthermore, we could find two new ORFs. ORF28115-27765
is not located in the terminal regions but is located
between the fibre and pVIII gene and was, therefore, not
described and numbered by Chiocca et al. Since it is conserved in CELO, FAdV-9, CFA40 and FAdV-10 but unique
to this group, it was of special interest for this study. It is
noteworthy that this is the only unique ORF in the central
portion of the genome, all others are exclusively found in
the terminal regions.
We further identified ORF32895-32434, which overlaps with
ORF-21 in a different frame. Since ORF32895-32434 has
homologous sequences in FAdV-9 and CFA40, it appears
more likely to be expressed than the originally described
ORF-21.

18/19). In adenoviruses, genes usually do not overlap and
it is unlikely that heavy usage of overlapping genes does
occur in CELO. It can be rather expected that, if two or
more ORFs overlap in substantial parts of their coding
sequence, only one ORF is expressed. After our analysis,
we propose that the originally described ORF3,4,5,6,7,15,21 do not code for proteins because (i) there
are no homologs in the closely related avian adenoviruses
or in other viruses/organisms, (ii) sequence analysis did
not yield reasonable protein features, (iii) no corresponding transcript could be experimentally detected [13] (iv)
they overlap with alternative ORFs that meet most of these
criteria.
Taken together, we have to expect that the CELO genome
has at least 15 ORFs of functional importance without
homologs in mammalian adenoviruses. The amino acid
sequences of all the ORFs can be found together with
homologous sequences from related avian adenoviruses

SEQUENCES/CELO/. All these sequences were subject of
an in-depth sequence analysis. The general strategy that
was used is outlined in Fig. 2 and the major results are
summarized below.

Also some other originally described ORFs overlap with
each other (e.g. ORF-3 with ORF-13 or ORF-7 with ORF-

ORF-2, ORF-12, ORF-13: homologs of parvovirus nonstructural proteins with an inactive ATPase/helicase
domain
In ORF-2, homology to parvoviral non-structural proteins
is significant and was noted previously [4]. ORF-2 is most
similar to Rep78 of adeno associated virus (AAV) 3B
(BLASTP expectation value: E = 8·10-32) and is already
member of the corresponding Pfam family (Parvovirus
non-structural protein NS1: PF01057). This domain spans
the complete sequence of ORF-2 (Fig. 3a). We also found
that ORF-12 and ORF-13 are distantly related to this family of proteins. A PSI-BLAST search with inclusion
threshold 0.05 was initiated with ORF-12. After the first
run, only the FAdV-9 homolog ORF6190-5243 was found (E
= 8·10-38). The second run did also bring up CELO-ORF13 (E = 0.016). After the inclusion of FAdV-9-ORF5058-4261
(the FAdV-9 homolog of ORF-13) in round 3, CELO-ORF2 was found among the top hits (E = 0.55) after four
iterations.

Outline of the analysis process illustrating basic steps from an
unknown protein sequence towards a functional interpretation. (1) Starting with the unknown CELO sequence, significantly homologous sequences featuring relatively high
identity/similarity are searched. Usually, only sequences from
related avian adenoviruses could be found at this step. This
results in a set of homologous proteins likely to have the
same or at least similar function. The following steps are carried out for each of these sequences. This comparative
approach can bring up additional information which might be
missed if only one sequence is analyzed. (2) Intrinsic
sequence features are investigated. This includes a statistical
analysis of amino acid contents, the search for low complexity regions (LCRs), coiled coil domains, transmembrane
domains (TM), amino- and carboxy-terminal signal sequences
and internal repeats. An important output of this step is the
rough discrimination between globular and non-globular
regions in the protein. (3) The globular regions are further
analyzed. These domains present the most useful level on
which to understand protein function and their identification
is, therefore, one of the major issues during the whole analysis process. Comparison to different databases using various
algorithms (see Material and Methods) can either find significant homologs, or proposes a set of candidate domains with
borderline statistical significance. In the latter case (4), those
hits must be further verified or excluded be additional investigations (conservation of critical functional or structural residues, secondary structure prediction, fold recognition,
consensus of different methods, consensus of prediction
results within the group of close homologs,...). (5) Finally, all
the results are integrated and can be interpreted in the context of the CELO infection cycle.

So, PSI-BLAST suggests distant links between ORF-12,
ORF-13 and ORF-2 and, thus, to the NS-1 family. Those
three ORFs are likely to form a paralogous group which
originates from an acquired parvoviral NS-1 protein (see
supplementary material for a more detailed phylogenetic
analysis). Since (i) BLAST searches initiated with ORF-2
clearly hit AAV Rep proteins and (ii) interactions between
adenoviruses and AAVs, which depend in their replication
on a helper adeno- or herpesvirus [19], are naturally
occuring, an AAV Rep protein is the most plausible
candidate.
Rep proteins are multifunctional proteins and have a variety of enzymatic activities: DNA-binding activity, endonuclease activity, helicase activity and ATPase activity
[20,21]. The regions of the Rep proteins responsible for
the distinct activities have been functionally mapped in a
variety of mutational studies [22-26] (Fig. 4).
Endonuclease activity is located in the 200 amino-terminal residues. This region is missing completely in the
CELO/FAdV-9 sequences. ATPase/helicase activity was
found to be located in the central region of the Rep proteins. This region is covered by the Pfam NS-1 domain
which is conserved between other parvoviral non-structural proteins and the CELO/FAdV-9 ORFs. In other
words, ORF-2, ORF-12, ORF-13 and their FAdV-9
homologs mainly consist of a domain derived from an
ATPase/helicase domain.
The ATPase/helicase domain was previously classified as a
superfamily III helicase [27]. This sort of helicase proteins
can be found in small viruses. These proteins have three
conserved sequence motifs tightly packed in an approximately 100-amino-acid domain. The first two of them

reported by "COILS". Zn: region with four conserved cysteines in ORF-12 and ORF-13. ORF-13 has an extended and presumably unstructured amino-terminus rich in prolines and charged residues. In ORF-14, a distant homology to the superfamily III
helicases could be detected in the region of the "Motif A" (see text). (B) Putative type-1 transmembrane glycoproteins. SP: signal peptides predicted by SignalP. TM: transmembrane domains predicted by TMHMM. In ORF-11, the TM is not significantly

viruses. The domain boundaries were estimated according to the location of PSI-BLAST hits to known lipases. "S/T" and "T"
denote regions rich in serine/threonine and threonine, respectively. These domains are predicted to be highly O-glycosylated.

(motif A and B) form the NTP binding site and are specific
versions of a NTP binding pattern common to many families of helicases. The third motif (C) is unique to superfamily III helicases [27]. In parvoviral sequences, an
additional motif B' between B and C was identified [28].
Fig. 5 shows a multiple sequence alignment of the central
region of Rep78 from AAV-3B to the NS-1 domains found
in CELO and FAdV-9 sequences. The superfamily III helicase motifs are indicated. Motif A (also known as the
Walker motif or P-loop, [29]) has the consensus [AG]x(4)-G-K-[ST] (PROSITE PS00017) and forms a NTP
interacting loop which connects a beta-sheet and an
alpha-helix. In Rep78, this motif is perfectly represented,
while in the CELO/FAdV-9 sequences critical residues are
not conserved. The lysine and the serine/threonine are
substituted in all cases. Only the glycines are partly conserved indicating the existence of a loop which is confirmed by the secondary structure prediction. Although
some variations of the Motif A might be compatible with
ATPase function if the typical sheet-loop-helix conformation is maintained [28], it is unlikely that this is the case
here. The lysine and serine/threonine are strictly conserved throughout the superfamily III but also in related
superfamilies [28] and, in the special case of AAV-Rep proteins, it was shown that mutation of either of these residues abolishes ATPase and helicase activity completely
[24]. Also in the other three motifs, critical residues
required for enzymatic activity are not or only partly conserved. This is most obvious for B' where a substantial part
of the motif including three essential residues for helicase
function [25] is deleted. To conclude, none of the
sequences appear to be Rep-like enzymatically active, not
even ORF-2 and FAdV-9-ORF1950-2753, which are significantly similar to Rep proteins.
Interestingly, the ATPase/helicase motifs only cover 100
amino acids in the central part of the conserved NS-1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/55

domain (Fig. 5). There are appr. 100 additional residues
in the amino terminus. We could not find data that shows
that this region is directly involved in ATPase/helicase
activity and it is definitely not part of the amino-terminal
endonuclease domain of the AAV Rep proteins [26].
Therefore, taking also into account the relatively high
sequence conservation, we assume that the amino-terminal appr. 100 residues form another globular domain
with additional yet unknown functions.
Also, the identity of the appr. 80 carboxy-terminal residues is unclear. Compared to the rest of the sequence, this
region is not that well conserved and the CELO/FAdV-9
ORFs cannot be reliably aligned in this region. AAV Rep
proteins have a carboxy-terminal domain which contains
several zinc binding motifs (Fig. 4). This domain is known
to bind zinc in vitro [30] but little is known about its function. In the CELO/FAdV-9 sequences, a distinct domain
with pronounced zinc binding motifs is missing. However, for CELO-ORF-12, CELO-ORF-13 and their FAdV-9
homologs, some weak hits in the comparison with
domain libraries (PFAM, SMART) point to various C4
zing finger domains. Those hits can be explained by the
existence of four conserved cysteines in the very carboxyterminus of the sequences (cysteine is a rare amino-acid
type and, if cysteines match, they yield high scores). It can
be speculated that these residues have zinc binding capability, although no further data can support this.
Furthermore, there is good evidence that AAV Rep proteins function as oligomers [31] and important interaction sites have been mapped to two putative coiled-coil
regions [25,31]. All sequences were routinely scanned for
regions with the potential to form coiled-coils. In the case
of ORF-12 and its FAdV-9 homolog, two such regions are
found (Fig. 3a). The signal in the carboxy-terminus lies
exactly in the region corresponding to the experimentally
determined interaction site. Closer inspection shows that
this region is predicted with maximum confidence to
form a helix which has amphipathic properties indicated
by the typical distribution pattern of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic residues. This result might suggest that also
some of the adenovirus NS-1 proteins interact with each
other.
ORF-14: an additional putative NS-1 domain protein
ORF-14 is located within the cluster of NS-1 proteins
between ORF-2 and ORF-13 (Fig. 1). This genomic
arrangement suggests a connection for ORF-14 to the NS1 proteins. We have, indeed, evidence that ORF-14 is
related to this protein family. In this case, however, the
degree of divergence has almost reached the limit of detection and a homology could only be indirectly inferred in
a short region of ORF-14.

Figure sequence alignment of parvovirus NS-1 domains found in CELO and FAdV-9
Multiple5
Multiple sequence alignment of parvovirus NS-1 domains found in CELO and FAdV-9. As a reference sequence, the Rep78 protein of adeno-associated virus 3B (acc. no. AAB95451) is included. JPred secondary structure prediction for CELO-ORF-2 is
shown in the top line (H: alpha-helix, E: beta-sheet). Superfamily III ATPase/helicase motifs (see text) are indicated. Critical residues for NTP-binding in motif A are marked by arrows. In the region of motif A, CELO-ORF-14 and two homologous
sequences from FAdV-9 were included in the alignment. In this region of CELO-ORF-14, homology to papillomavirus helicases
is reported by CD-Search. As a reference sequence, papillomavirus E1 helicase (acc. no. P22154) is included. JPred secondary
structure prediction for CELO-ORF-14 is shown in the bottom line.

In ORF-14, CD-search detected sequence similarity to E1
papillomavirus helicases (Pfam PF00519, pos. 90–120, E
= 0.57). Although a borderline hit of limited statistical significance, it turned out to be of special interest. The E1
helicase (reviewed in [32]) is member of the same superfamily as the parvoviral NS-1 helicases [28]. Both have the
Walker A-motif discussed above, and the short CD-search
hit matches the region of this motif. Interestingly, there
are two ORFs related to CELO-ORF-14 in FAdV-9. One
full length homolog (ORF) can be easily found by BLASTP
with E = 6·10-8. If this ORF is included in a PSI-BLAST
query, another homolog (FAdV-9-ORF3412-2837), which is
encoded directly adjacent to FAdV-9-ORF4180-3536, is
detected (E = 1.8). The PSI-BLAST hit only matches a short
region, which corresponds, again, to the Walker A motif.
In the alignment in Fig. 5, the relevant stretches of CELOORF-14 and the two FAdV-9 sequences have been aligned
to the A motif of the sequences with the parvoviral NS-1
domains. The motif itself is hardly recognizable but the
hydrophobic pattern and also the typical sheet-loop-helix
succession seems to be present.
To conclude, these remnants of the Walker A-motif indicate that there are additional ORFs in CELO and FAdV-9
which are likely to be derived from superfamily III helicases. Together with ORF-2, ORF-12 and ORF-13 they
form a cluster which dominates the left terminal region in
both genomes.
ORF-9, ORF-10, ORF-11: Putative type-1 transmembrane
glycoproteins with an immunoglobulin-like domain
The analysis results for ORF-9, ORF-10 and ORF-11 show
that the three ORFs, which are arranged directly adjacent
to each other, are similarly organized and encode putative
type-1 transmembrane glycoproteins (Fig. 3b). In all
sequences, an amino terminal signal peptide is significantly predicted (probabilities of the SignalP hidden
Markov model >0.9). In the case of ORF-10, a signal peptide is only predicted if the second methionine in the
sequence is used as start (P = 0.996 in contrast to P = 0.027
if the complete sequence is used). This suggests that the
start codon is at pos. 41113 rather than at pos. 41002. In
ORF-9 and ORF-10, transmembrane regions (TM) are significantly predicted (classified as "certain" by Toppred
with scores near 2 and TMHMM probabilities near 1). In
ORF-11, no significant TM is reported. There is only a
hydrophobic region in the carboxy-terminus labelled as a
"putative" TM by Toppred.

In all three sequences, the Prosite Asn-glycosylation motif
PS00001 was detected several times (see legend of Fig.
3b). This is a short and thus very common motif but the
number of occurrences is unusual high for proteins of this
length, and so some of them can be expected to be real
glycosylation sites rather than mere statistical artifacts.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/55

There is, apparently, one distinct globular domain common for all three ORFs. In ORF-11, this domain spans
almost the complete sequence. In ORF-9 and ORF-10, this
central domain is flanked by presumably unstructured
low complexity regions. Detailed sequence analysis
revealed that it is an immunoglobulin-like domain: In
ORF-11, the SMART IG-domain (SMART SM00409) is
predicted by CD-Search and HMMER (19–119, E = 21·107 and 18–119, E = 3·10-6, respectively). In the other two
sequences, the prediction is not that clear but the domain
can be plausibly assigned. In ORF-9, CD-Search predicts
the SMART IG-domain in region 192–227 with E = 1.0. In
ORF-10, it is detected by CD-Search (135–233, E = 0.71)
and HMMER (166–233, E = 0.36). Furthermore, the 3DPSSM fold recognition server proposes for all three
sequences almost exclusively structures of the immunoglobulin superfamily. A multiple sequence alignment
of the IG-like domains found in the CELO virus genome
and in related viruses is available as part of the supplementary material on our website.
The IG-like fold is probably the most abundant protein
fold that exists. As a consequence, public databases are full
of proteins with IG-like domains and this makes homology searches with ORF-9, ORF-10 and ORF-11 difficult. In
all cases, BLASTP detects a wide variety of different glycoproteins and surface receptors with borderline E-values.
However, those hits most likely only reflect the fact that
the proteins have the same fold and a closer evolutionary
relationship could not be inferred for any of the three
sequences to other known proteins. On the other hand,
the results show that ORF-9, ORF-10 and ORF-11 are
closer related to each other. A BLASTP search with ORF-9
against the NCBI non-redundant protein database finds
ORF-10 with E = 5·10-4. A PSI-BLAST profile search initiated with ORF-11 (inclusion E-value 0.05) finds ORF-9
with E = 0.04 after the second iteration. These results suggest a common origin for these ORFs. Further database
searches propose a candidate for a possible ancestor. We
could find an expressed sequence tag from a chicken
library which is highly similar to ORF-9 (acc.no.
BM491231, TBLASTN against the NCBI EST database: E =
6·10-14). So, it is likely that this cluster of three similarly
organized proteins form a paralogous group derived from
a cellular gene that has been acquired from an avian host.
ORF-16: a putative ADP-ribosyltransferase
In ORF-16, an unexpected homology to ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) could be detected. ARTs (reviewed in [33])
transfer the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD onto specific protein targets. ARTs have been long known in prokaryotes
but an ART family could also be found in vertebrates [3436]. In ORF-16, CD-search reported a hit from pos. 70 to
129 to this family of vertebrate ARTs (Pfam PF01129).
The hit is statistically of borderline significance (E = 0.23)

but there are additional arguments which consistently
support this finding.
(i) The hit matches the region of the ART NAD-binding
pocket which constitutes the important region for enzymatic activity. This binding pocket is structurally conserved (see below) and characteristic for all ART enzymes
of known structure [37-39].
(ii) Critical residues for enzymatic activity are conserved.
Although the structural properties of the catalytic core are
similar in distantly related ARTs, the conservation in primary sequence is remarkably low. Only typical fingerprint
residues are conserved between the distantly related ARTs
[37]. Vertebrate ARTs belong to a subgroup which is characterized by an Arg-Ser-Glu motif [37]. This motif can be
found in ORF-16 (Fig. 6). The first arginine (Arg93) is well
conserved together with other surrounding residues. The
serine (Ser108) is also conserved and part of a short S/T
rich stretch which is characteristic for the other ART
sequences too. The relevant region of the glutamate in the
Arg-Ser-Glu motif was not part of the CD-search hit. But
there is a charged motif in the very carboxy-terminus of
ORF-16 including a glutamate (Glu136) which can be
plausibly aligned to the mainly acidic stretch found in the
ART sequences which contains the critical glutamate.
(iii) Predicted secondary structural features of ORF-16 are
compatible with the ART fold. The 3D-structure of a vertebrate ART of this family (ART2.2 from rat) has been determined recently [39]. Secondary structure predictions for
ORF-16 are consistent with it (Fig. 6). The amino-terminal
part is predicted to form mainly alpha-helices. Especially,
α-4 and α-5 immediately upstream of the catalytic core
are well predicted by different methods. In contrast, the
catalytic core itself is, again in accordance with the ART2.2
structure, predicted to form mainly beta sheets. There is
only one clear alpha-helix predicted in this region which
matches exactly the α-6 of the ART2.2 structure. Furthermore, the gaps in ORF-16 match exactly the loop regions
of the ART structure and no important secondary structures are broken or missing. Only β-9 and β-10 are missing due to the end of the sequence but both are not critical
for the formation of the typical four stranded NAD-binding core which is made up by β-2, β-5, β-6 and β-8 [39].
(iv) For ART2.2 it was found that the fold of the catalytic
core is stabilized by a disulfide bond tying together the
two ends of the strands β-2 and β-6. The responsible
cysteines are marked in the alignment. Both are conserved
in ORF-16 (C88 and C128).
Taken together, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that
ORF-16 is related to ADP-ribosyltransferases. To our surprise, ORF-16 has no homolog in FAdV-9. We could only

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/55

detect a short homology in FAdV-10 (ORF4550-4209). This
ORF is similar to the amino-terminus of ORF-16, but it
stops prematurely and the rest of the sequence including
the relevant part showing ART homology in ORF-16 is
unclear.
ORF-18/19: a putative triglyceride lipase with an
additional domain unique to avian adeno- and
herpesviruses
The sequence analysis of ORF-18 and ORF-19 suggested
that both ORFs encode one single protein. A sequencing
error was suspected and could be confirmed by comparison to an alternative nucleic acid sequence of CELO covering this region (acc.no. S33490). In the sequence of
Chiocca et al., a single A is obviously missing at pos.
35749. Insertion of the missing nucleotide leads to a continuous open reading frame (ORF-18/19).

There are homologs of the merged ORF-18/19 in FAdV-9,
CFA40 and FAdV-10 (Table 1) but also in Marek's diseaselike viruses (MDV), a group of pathogenic avian herpesviruses [40]. Fig. 3d shows the architecture of the different
proteins. In ORF-18/19, significant homology to triglyceride lipases (Pfam PF00151) could be detected by different
methods (e.g. CD-Search reports a hit to this family in the
region of 125–306 with E = 3·10-7). This homology to
lipases has been noted previously in the CFA40 homolog
[18] and also in the MDV sequences [41,42]. The active
site serine and the surrounding residues (Prosite motif
PS00120) are well conserved among all sequences,
suggesting enzymatic activity (see supplementary material). However, only part of the Pfam lipase domain,
which is widely distributed among animals, plants and
prokaryotes, can be found in the viral proteins. Instead,
there are about 300 residues unique to the avian and adenoviral proteins. PSI-BLAST and HMMER profile searches
with this region did not find a connection to any other
known proteins. Some of these residues may contribute to
lipase function but additional functional domains can be
expected. Interestingly, in FAdV-10 the lipase domain and
the unique region is encoded by two distinct ORFs. It
must be noted that this cannot be explained by a simple
sequencing error as in the case of the CELO sequence.
Further results of the comparative analysis indicate that
the proteins of this group are possibly membrane glycoproteins. Signal peptides and transmembrane regions
could be identified (Fig. 3d). In the CELO sequence, no
signal peptide could be found (SignalP: P = 0.005).
However, Payet et al. report a short leader sequence which
is spliced together with ORF-18/19 [13]. If this leader is
included in the translation and an alternative ATG
encoded by this leader is used as the start codon, the new
amino terminus has significant signal peptide properties
(P = 0.996). This suggests that the short 5'-leader

sequences which are common during the transcription in
CELO and FAdV-9 [13,17] are, at least in some cases, part
of the coding sequence and must be regarded as short
exons rather than untranslated leaders. Interestingly, also
in the homologous sequence of Marek's disease virus 1 the
signal peptide is encoded in a very short exon which is
spliced together with a much longer second exon encoding the rest of the protein [41].
In FAdV-9, CFA40 and FAdV-10 an extended carboxy-terminus including S/T rich regions can be observed. In
FAdV-10, there is a run of about 60 threonines interspersed only with some prolines. Such S/T rich domains
are typical sites for O-glycosylation of the mucin type
[43]. Moreover, the carboxy-terminus of FAdV-10-ORF
was found by CD-Search to be similar to the carboxy-terminus of herpes glycoprotein D (Pfam PF01537, E =
0.007). In CELO this extended glycoprotein-like carboxyterminus is missing. It might be encoded by another exon
or might have been lost completely.
ORF32895-32434: two conserved transmembrane domains
This ORF overlaps with the originally described ORF-21
and is read in a different frame on the same strand. It is
conserved in CELO, FAdV-9 and CFA40 with respect to
amino acid sequence and genomic location (in all three
viruses it is located between ORF-20 and ORF-22). The
analysis of ORF32895-32434 found only one interesting feature in this sequence. There are two significantly predicted
transmembrane segments (TMHMM probabilities > 0.9
and TopPred2 scores > 2). Also the homologous ORFs in
FAdV-9 and CFA40 contain two transmembrane segments
each (Fig. 3e). We do not have the impression that
ORF32895-32434 encodes a functional protein on its own but
is conceivable that this conserved coding region is an exon
which provides one or two transmembrane segments for
some other ORFs. Candidate sequences are for example
ORF-20 and ORF-18/19 which are located on the same
strand directly upstream of ORF32895-32434 and which are
likely to be membrane located (indicated by signal peptides or transmembrane domains in close homologs).
Other ORFs
In the case of ORF-17 and ORF28115-27765, the sequence
analysis did not yield reasonable new results. For ORF-20,
it can be noted that an amino-terminal signal peptide is
significantly predicted in the FAdV-9 homolog. In ORF-20
and also in the CFA40 homolog, the amino terminus is
unclear since the homology goes beyond the only methionine and another methionine cannot be observed. It can
be speculated that ORF-20 is provided with a leader peptide by another exon, presumably the same as in the case
of ORF-18/19. This assumption is supported by the
genomic location and could account for the missing start
codon.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/55

Also in the case of the UTPase (ORF-1), GAM-1 (ORF-8)
and ORF-22, which have been characterized experimentally [4-10], the sequence analysis could not add new
aspects to what has already been known.

Discussion
We report the reannotation of the genome of the avian
adenovirus CELO with emphasis on the unique terminal
regions. In view of the unsatisfactory state of the previous
annotation and the rapidly improving sequence analyzing
techniques, this genome appeared worth to be revisited.
So, we conducted a comprehensive sequence analysis on
the protein level aimed towards a better understanding of
the unique features of CELO biology.
In a first step, we had to refine the prediction of the coding
regions and propose 15 ORFs which can be expected to be
of functional importance. Interestingly, we found several
ORFs without a start codon. This possibly indicates that
some of these proteins are not encoded by one contiguous
ORF and splicing is necessary to form the complete coding
sequence. Also, simple errors in the genomic sequence can
result in wrong or missing start codons which in turn can
obscure the identity of ORFs remarkably. Both issues are
difficult to deal with by theoretical methods. Therefore,
protein sequences cannot be reliably determined in all
cases. However, the relevant regions for this study have a
manageable size of about 18 kb which could be examined
manually. Thus, obvious pitfalls of an automatic ORF prediction could be avoided which resulted in a prediction
which is in some cases quite different from what has been
proposed before but which is likely to reflect the expression situation in vivo more precisely.
The subsequent in-depth sequence analysis of these new
ORFs could shed new light on the identity of most of
them. An unexpected result is that the majority of the
ORFs are related to each other and cluster in paralogous
groups.
The terminal region on the left side of the map (Fig. 1) is
dominated by a group of ORFs with a conserved domain
homologous to Rep proteins of adeno-associated viruses.
This parvoviral domain is completely unusual in adenoviruses. Within this family, it can be exclusively found in
CELO and its close relative FAdV-9. The very fact that the
generally tightly packed and economically arranged CELO
genome contains several copies of this domain suggests
major functional importance for it.
The function of the adenoviral Rep proteins, however,
must be different from the primary function of the Rep
protein in AAVs. There, they are essential for a successful
life cycle and are required for DNA nicking and subsequent priming of DNA replication, for site specific integra-

tion into the host genome and for packaging the single
stranded DNA into the capsid [21,44,45]. These functions
are useless for CELO simply because these processes do
not occur or are solved in a different way during the life
cycle of adenoviruses. This is consistent with the results of
our sequence analysis which found that only the central
region of the AAV-Rep proteins containing the ATPase/
helicase function is present in CELO and FAdV-9 while the
regions with DNA-binding and endonuclease activity are
missing. Furthermore, the ATPase/helicase domain is

the only non-structural gene. This might be the reason
why rep products have taken over a wide variety of other
functions. Rep proteins are known, in different contexts,
to act as transcriptional activators and repressors of
homologous and heterologous promoters [46-49]. Several interaction partners have been identified including
different transcription factors [50-54]. These results point
to a general role in transcriptional regulation. Moreover,
Rep proteins are also implicated in other cellular pathways as for example the p53 and pRB-E2F pathways where
they exhibit onco-suppressive functions and hinder cell
cycle progression [55,56]. Rep proteins are also known to
induce apoptosis [57]. Interestingly, these functions are
contrary to CELO physiology in which proliferation is
enhanced and apoptosis is prevented with the help of
Gam1 and ORF-22 [6,10].

Therefore, other functions for this diverged non-functional domain must be envisaged. In AAVs, the rep gene is

In most of the cases, the exact molecular basis of all those
Rep functions are not established yet. Diffuse mappings
do not allow the identification of new functional domains
or motifs. This situation is of course unfavourable for a
detailed functional prediction for the CELO Rep proteins.
However, CELO apparently makes use of the great functional plasticity of this protein family and we must expect
that ORF-2, ORF-12, ORF-13 (and possibly also ORF-14)
interact with a number of cellular targets resulting in
implications for various pathways. They might be
involved in transcriptional control as it can be seen in a
rather general fashion for AAV Rep products. CELO possibly uses those early proteins to modulate the host's gene
expression machinery in order to render cellular conditions more favourable.
In the right terminal region (Fig. 1), we could identify a
cluster of three putative type-1 transmembrane glycoproteins with (partly diverged) immunoglobulin-like
domains. IG-like domains are multi-purpose interaction
domains and characteristic for proteins involved in recognition processes in the immune-system [58]. Also in the
case of the CELO proteins, a connection to the immune
system must be considered.
A virus is always threatened by the host's immune
response and adenoviruses have evolved multiple strategies to escape the immune mechanisms (reviewed in
[59]). In human adenoviruses, most of these functions are
encoded by the E3 transcription unit which is not present
in avian adenoviruses. Detailed E3 functions have primarily been described for human adenoviruses of the subgenus C. The E3 regions of different human subgenera differ
remarkably and there are many E3 proteins of unknown
function which are unique to distinct subgenera. It is
noteworthy that several E3 products were shown to be
type-1 transmembrane glycoproteins. Also a conserved
domain which is thought to have an IG-like fold was
found in some E3 proteins of subgenera B and D [60,61].
Although no closer evolutionary relationship between
any of these known E3 proteins and the ORFs of the CELO
IG-cluster could be detected, these ORFs are strong
candidates to substitute for the missing immunomodulatory functions. The fact that not a single E3 protein is conserved in CELO, may be explained by the different
immunological requirements that a virus faces in an avian
host. This avian specificity is evident if we consider the
origin of this gene cluster. We have found an expressed
sequence tag from a chicken library which is a direct
homolog to ORF-9. Although the corresponding gene/
protein has not been characterized yet, this shows that an
ORF-9 homolog must exist in the chicken genome. This
chicken gene is likely to be present also in other avian species and is presumably the origin of the IG-like proteins in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/55

avian adenoviruses. It is an interesting scenario that a
virus could have acquired an immune-receptor from the
host and uses it, in course of its efforts to escape the
immune mechanisms, to its own advantage.
Directly adjacent to the IG-cluster, ORF-16 can be found.
We have well-founded evidence that ORF-16 is homologous to a family of vertebrate mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases. Although the overall sequence similarity is only
within the twilight zone, the conservation of invariant fingerprint residues together with structural considerations
including secondary structure prediction and conserved
disulfide bond forming cysteines, strongly suggest that
ORF-16 has a NAD-binding fold which is characteristic for
all known ARTs. Interestingly, it has been speculated
before that there might exist unrecognized ARTs in known
genomes which could have evaded detection by standard
methods due to the low conservation of primary sequence
[35].
To our knowledge, this putative CELO ART would be the
first occurrence of such an enzymatic activity in a vertebrate virus and this raises the question of its function in
such a viral context.
ADP-ribosylation is well known as the pathogenic mechanism of some potent bacterial toxins such as pertussis,
cholera and clostridial toxins [62]. On the other hand, the
functions of vertebrate ARTs are still ill-defined. However,
data is emerging that members of this family which can be
found in mammalian and avian species play an important
role in cell signaling and the modulation of inflammatory
and immune response (reviewed in [63]). Different surface receptors (mostly expressed on cells of the immune
system) have been identified as targets for ART mediated
ADP-ribosylation. Such immuno-regulatory functions,
based on the posttranslational modification of cell-surface receptors, would also make sense in the context of
CELO infection. Considering the existence of three potential IG-like surface receptors in the CELO genome, it is of
course tempting to speculate that CELO uses the ART
activity to modify them. It must be noted, however, that
the known members of the vertebrate ART family are
localized in the extracellular space (secreted or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored [34,35]). The sequence of
ORF-16 has no features which indicate extracellular localization. It is possible that the amino terminus is not complete and a signal peptide is missing, as we can see it for
other CELO ORFs. Alternatively, it is conceivable that the
putative ART has changed target specifity and is located
intracellularly. In any case, such an unusual enzymatic
activity is of broader interest and appears worth to be pursued experimentally.

Finally, we have characterized the merged ORF-18/19
which is expected to encode a triglyceride lipase. Comparison to homologous sequences of other avian adeno- and
herpesviruses show that these lipases are likely to be transmembrane glycoproteins and have an additional domain
of unknown function unique to those viruses. It is difficult to speculate on a possible role of these lipases. Some
ideas have been put forward previously [42].

the Pfam [70] and SMART [71,72] collections of hidden
Markov models of known protein domains and families
were searched using the HMMER package (version 2.1.1,
Sean Eddy, Dept. of Genetics, Washington university
School of Medicine) in both global and fragmentary
mode. All sequences were scanned for PROSITE [73] patterns and motifs using PPSEARCH (European Bioinformatics Institute).

Conclusions

Intrinsic protein features
Regions of biased amino acid content and regions of low
complexity were detected with SAPS [74] and SEG [75].
Sequences were scanned for transmembrane regions using
TopPred 2 [76] and TMHMM 2 [77]. Amino-terminal signal peptides were predicted with SignalP 2, applying both
the neural network and the hidden Markov model [78].

Taken together, our results give a new picture of the
unique terminal regions of the CELO genome. Even the
use of different highly sensitive methods could not detect
homologies to any known sequences of mastadenoviruses
in these regions. In contrast, those methods could elucidate unexpected relationships to various other proteins.
We found that CELO has acquired several genes from
other viruses and also from its host. Apparently, these proteins form, partly after duplications and heavy diversification, a novel set of functions for host interaction in avian
adenoviruses. This reannotation provides an important
source of new information which can readily direct and
assist experimental work. The detailed sequence analysis
of the CELO gene products can help to devise new experiments and to interpret existing and forthcoming experimental results.

Materials and Methods
Sequences
The complete genomic sequences of CELO and FAdV-9
described by Chiocca et al. [4] and Ojkic et al. [15] were
taken from the RefSeq [64] entries with GenBank accession numbers NC_001720 and NC_000899, respectively.
Partial genomic sequences of the hypervirulent FAdV-9
strain CFA40 were taken from entry AF155911 [18], and
in the case of FAdV-10 from entries AF160185 [65] and
AF006739 [66].

Secondary and tertiary structure prediction
Secondary structure was predicted using PHD [79] and
JPred [80]. The existence of coiled-coil structures was
examined with COILS [81]. All sequences were submitted
to the 3D-PSSM fold recognition server [82].
Sequence manipulation and multiple sequence alignments
All sequence manipulations, especially translation operations, were carried out with the appropriate programs of
the EMBOSS package [83]. Multiple sequence alignments
were created with the help of ClustalW [84] and T_coffee
[85]. The alignments were automatically shaded according to the default settings of the ClustalX [86] interface.

In addition to the programs, servers and databases listed
here, the sequences were also analyzed with a variety of
other methods described previously [87,88]. However,
they did not yield relevant results for this special study
and, therefore, their description is omitted here.

List of abbreviations
Searching for homologous sequences
Public available sequence databases (National Center for
Biotechnology Information, NIH, Bethesda) were
scanned using the BLAST suite of programs, including
BLASTP, TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST [67,68]. To enhance
sensitivity during clustering and comparing of protein
sequences among the avian adenoviruses, a custom
library of all available sequence data for this group was
created and searched as well.
