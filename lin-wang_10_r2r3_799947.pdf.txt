Abstract
Background: The control of plant anthocyanin accumulation is via transcriptional regulation of the genes
encoding the biosynthetic enzymes. A key activator appears to be an R2R3 MYB transcription factor. In apple fruit,
skin anthocyanin levels are controlled by a gene called MYBA or MYB1, while the gene determining fruit flesh and
foliage anthocyanin has been termed MYB10. In order to further understand tissue-specific anthocyanin regulation
we have isolated orthologous MYB genes from all the commercially important rosaceous species.
Results: We use gene specific primers to show that the three MYB activators of apple anthocyanin (MYB10/MYB1/
MYBA) are likely alleles of each other. MYB transcription factors, with high sequence identity to the apple gene
were isolated from across the rosaceous family (e.g. apples, pears, plums, cherries, peaches, raspberries, rose,
strawberry). Key identifying amino acid residues were found in both the DNA-binding and C-terminal domains of
these MYBs. The expression of these MYB10 genes correlates with fruit and flower anthocyanin levels. Their
function was tested in tobacco and strawberry. In tobacco, these MYBs were shown to induce the anthocyanin
pathway when co-expressed with bHLHs, while over-expression of strawberry and apple genes in the crop of
origin elevates anthocyanins.
Conclusions: This family-wide study of rosaceous R2R3 MYBs provides insight into the evolution of this plant trait.
It has implications for the development of new coloured fruit and flowers, as well as aiding the understanding of
temporal-spatial colour change.

Background
The Rosaceae is an economically important group of
cultivated plants, which includes fruit-producing genera
such as Malus (apples), Pyrus (pears), Prunus (e.g.
peach, plums, apricots), Fragaria (strawberries), and
Rubus (raspberry, blackberry, boysenberry), as well as
ornamental plants such as Rosa (rose). In these fruits
and flowers, colour is a key quality trait and is often
caused by anthocyanin. Anthocyanins are water-soluble
pigments that belong to the flavonoid family of compounds giving red, blue and purple colours in a range of
flowers, fruits, foliage, seeds and roots [1]. Anthocyanins
are involved in a wide range of functions, such as the

attraction of pollinators, seed dispersal, protection
against UV light damage, and pathogen attack [2-5].
Recently, research on anthocyanins has intensified
because of their potential benefits to human health,
including protection against cancer, inflammation, coronary heart diseases and other age-related diseases
[6-11].
In plants, the structural genes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway are largely regulated at the level of transcription. In all species studied to date, the regulation of
the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes are
through a complex of MYB transcription factors (TF),
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs and WD-repeat proteins (the MYB-bHLH-WD40 “MBW” complex; [12]). A
model has been proposed for the activation of structural
pigmentation genes, with regulators interacting with
each other to form transcriptional complexes in

conjunction with the promoters of structural genes [13].
For example, the R2R3 MYB C1 protein, that regulates
the anthocyanin pathway in maize, interacts with a
bHLH TF (either of the genes termed B or R) to activate
the promoter of dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR). In
contrast, the R2R3 MYB P protein, which regulates the
phlobaphene pathway in maize, can activate the same
promoter without a bHLH TF [14].
MYB TFs can be classified into three subfamilies
based on the number of highly conserved imperfect
repeats in the DNA-binding domain including R3 MYB
(MYB1R) with one repeat, R2R3 MYB with two repeats,
and R1R2R3 MYB (MYB3R) with three repeats [15,16].
Among these MYB transcription factors, R2R3-MYBs
constitute the largest TF gene family in plants, with 126
R2R3 MYB genes identified in Arabidopsis [17]. Those
associated with up-regulation of the anthocyanin pathway are R2R3 MYBs. Over-expression of the AtPAP1
gene (AtMYB75, At1 g56650) results in the accumulation of anthocyanins in Arabidopsis [18]. Several repressors of the phenylpropanoid pathway, and perhaps
anthocyanins specifically, are also MYB TFs, including
an R2R3 MYB repressor from strawberry FaMYB1 [19],
Arabidopsis AtMYB6, 4, and 3 [20], Antirrhinum
AmMYB308 [21], and a one repeat MYB in Arabidopsis,
AtMYBL2 [22,23]. How the repressor MYBs interact
with the MBW transcriptional complex is beginning to
be elucidated [22,23].
Based on the phylogenetic relationship between Arabidopsis R2R3 MYB TFs and anthocyanin-related MYBs
of other species, it appears that anthocyanin-regulating
R2R3 MYBs fall into one or two clades [17,24,25].
Anthocyanin-regulating MYBs have been isolated from
many species, including Arabidopsis AtMYB75 or PAP1,
AtMYB90 or PAP2, AtMYB113 and AtMYB114 [26],
Solanum lycopersicum ANT1 [27], Petunia hybrida AN2
[28], Capsicum annuum A [29], Vitis vinifera VvMYB1a
[30], Zea mays P [31], Oryza saliva C1 [32], Ipomoea
batatas IbMYB1 [33], Anitirrhinum majus ROSEA1,
ROSEA2 and VENOSA [34], Gerbera hybrid GhMYB10
[35], Picea mariana MBF1 [36], Garcinia mangostana
GmMYB10 [37], Malus × domestica MdMYB10,
MdMYB1/MdMYBA [24,38,39], and Gentian GtMYB3
[40].
For rosaceous species, MYBs that regulate the genes of
the anthocyanin pathway have been examined in apple
and strawberry. In apple (Malus × domestica) MYB10
was isolated from red-fleshed apple ‘Red Field’ [24], and
showed a strong correlation between the expression of
MYB10 and apple anthocyanin levels during fruit development. Transgenic apple lines constitutively expressing
MYB10 produced highly pigmented shoots. Two more
apple TFs, MYB1 and MYBA, were also reported to regulate genes in the anthocyanin pathway in red-skinned

Page 2 of 17

fruit [38,39]. Both MYB1 and MYBA share identical
sequences [38], while MYB10 and MYB1 genes are
located at very similar positions on linkage group 9 of
the apple genetic map [41]. In strawberry (Fragaria ×
ananassa), the R2R3 MYB TF FaMYB1 plays a key role
in down-regulating the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and
flavonols [19].
In this current study, we used an allele-specific PCR
primer approach to show that MdMYB1/MdMYBA/
MdMYB10 are highly likely to be allelic in the apple
genome. We then isolated genes with high sequence
similarity to MYB10 from 20 species within the Rosaceae. Sequence and functional characterization of these
genes provides insight into the evolution of this
TF, within a plant family where higher levels of pigmentation has been selected for during the process of
domestication. Expression analysis during the fruit
development, and functional testing using transient
assays and transgenic plants suggest that these R2R3
MYBs are responsible for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis in these crops.

Results
The MdMYB10/MdMYB1/MdMYBA genes are likely to be
allelic

Three highly homologous apple genes, MYB10 [24],
MYB1 [39] and MYBA [38], have been reported in different cultivars of apple. In order to ascertain whether,
in any given cultivar, these represent different genes or
are alleles of the one gene, we designed PCR primers to
amplify a region of genomic DNA common to all three
of these genes, spanning a region from the promoter
through to exon 1 of the published sequences. This
region produces an amplification length polymorphism
distinguishing the MYB10 allele present in red-fleshed
cultivars from white fleshed types [42]. The amplification products from a range of apple varieties are shown
in Figure 1A. One amplification product of approximately 900 bp is observed for the white-fleshed varieties
Pacific Rose™, ‘Royal Gala’, and ‘Granny Smith’. Two
amplification products, of approximately 900 bp and
1000 bp, were observed in red-fleshed apple varieties
such as ‘Red Field’, ‘Niedzwetzkyana’, and ‘Robert’s
Crab’. With red-fleshed varieties, known to be homologous for the red-flesh gene [41,42], only the 1000-bp
fragment is amplified. These products represent the R1
and R6 alleles previously reported for MYB10 [42], and
suggests that MYB10 and MYB1 are alleles, because if
they were paralogues there would still be two products
in R6R6 homozygous apples.
While these end-point PCR amplifications are not
quantitative, the fluorescence from ethidium bromide
(EtBr) indicated that in those tissues where both 900and 1000-bp fragments are amplified, these molecules

are likely to be in equivalent molar quantity within the
genome. This is based on the observation that when a
mixture of diluted PCR products from the 900-bp and
1000-bp fragments are mixed in ratios of 3:1 or 1:3
respectively, the EtBr fluorescence of the end-point PCR
amplifications reflects the corresponding molar ratios
(Figure 1A). Furthermore, PCR analysis of the progeny
from crosses made between the R1 homozygous Pacific
Rose™ cultivar and the heterozygous R 1 R 6 ’Red Field’
shows segregation of the homozygous R1 allele and the
heterozygous R1 and R6 alleles (Figure 1B). If MYB1 and
MYB10 were different genes, band intensity ratios of 3:1
would be possible but as only 1:1 ratios are observed,
MYB1 and MYB10 are likely to be allelic, representing
the R1 and R6 alleles.
Isolation of MYB10 homologues from the major
rosaceous crop species

We isolated both cDNA and genomic DNA from 20
rosaceous species and, using a gene-specific primer
approach based on the apple MYB10 gene sequence,
generated PCR fragments for cloning into sequencing
vectors. Fragments with sequence similarity to MYB10
were used to obtain full-length sequences for further
functional testing. This approach worked well for all the
members of the Maloideae subfamily (including apple,
quince, loquat, medlar and pear) and Amygdaloideae
subfamily (including apricot, damson, cherry, plum,
almond and peach), but not for species of the Rosoideae

subfamily (rose, strawberry and raspberry). For Rosoideae, we required additional steps involving 5’ and 3’
GeneRace of mRNA (GeneRacer Kit, Invitrogen), with
degenerate primers designed to the consensus DNA
sequence of the anthocyanin-related R2R3 MYB DNA
binding domain. The rosaceous MYB transcription factors isolated, using these approaches, are shown in
Table 1, and predicted protein sequence is shown in
Figure 2.
For both protein sequence and coding DNA sequence
(CDS) of rosaceous MYBs, the percentage of identity to
Arabidopsis AtMYB75 (PAP1, AT1G56650) varied from
58 to 64%, and 40 to 49%, respectively. The length of
CDS and protein sequence was similar between each
species analysed, but the length of genomic DNA
(gDNA) sequence varied significantly from 1122 bp
(Rosa hybrida) to 4055 bp (Malus × domestica, Table
1). This is due almost entirely to the variable length of
intron 2, which ranges from 82 bp (AtMYB90) to 3000
bp (MdMYB1). A schematic of MYB10-like genes from
rosaceous species is shown in Additional File 1. The
large size of intron 2 in apple correlates with its higher
DNA content than close relatives; apple has almost 2.5
times more DNA mass than pear [43 ]http://www.kew.
org/cval/homepage.html. Intron 2 of apple MYB10 is
2995 bp, compared with 487 bp in pear (Additional File
1B).
When the region of homology, corresponding to the
MYB R2R3 domain, was used to generate a phylogenic
tree, all the genes clustered with known anthocyaninrelated MYBs (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the MYB genes
clustered according to their taxonomic relationships in
the Rosaceae (Figure 3B). For the Maloideae (apple,
pear, quince, loquat and medlar), all clustered together
into a clade. For the Amygdaloideae (plum, cherry,
almond, apricot, peach and damson), all were clustered
into another clade. Raspberry, strawberry and rose are
the members of the Rosoideae and they all clustered
together. While the Maloideae and Amygdaloideae clustered closely together, the Rosoideae clustered more
distantly.
Sequence signatures specific for anthocyanin-related
MYBs

The large gene family of R2R3 MYB proteins was examined using conserved regions of homology. Over 172
proteins were included; all Arabidopsis R2R3 MYBs,
38 other dicot anthocyanin-promoting MYBs, including
apple MYB8, MYB9 and MYB11 (GenBank DQ267899,
DQ267900, and DQ074463 respectively), strawberry
anthocyanin repressor MYB1, as well as anthocyaninrelated MYBs from four monocots and one
gymnosperm. All the MYBs associated with promoting
anthocyanin biosynthesis from dicot species cluster

MYBs of this subgroup (Figure 3A). Monocot sequences,
such as C1 and P, as well as the gymnosperm Picea
mariana MBF1, cluster outside this group, suggesting
that this clade is dicot-specific. The function of promoting anthocyanin biosynthesis for this subgroup may

therefore have evolved after the divergence between
dicots and monocots.

of other clades (Figure 4). Three amino-acid residues
(arginine (R), valine (V), alanine (A); marked with arrows
in Figure 4A) are conserved for dicot anthocyanin-promoting MYBs at a frequency of 100(R):92(V):90(A).
None of these amino-acid residues appeared in the other
134 sequences at the respective position (full dataset in
Additional File 2). Another convenient identifier for an
anthocyanin-promoting MYB appears to be ANDV (in
over 90% of cases) at position 90 to 93 in the R2R3
domain (Figure 2 Box A and Figure 4B) which is not seen
in any other R2R3 MYBs (Additional File 2).

Outside of the DNA-interacting R2R3 domain, most
R2R3 MYB proteins have a long C-terminal sequence.
In this region of Arabidopsis anthocyanin-promoting
MYBs, the motif KPRPR [S/T]F has been identified (Box
B in Figure 2) [17], which is not present in other R2R3
MYBs. When anthocyanin-promoting MYB sequences
from other species are aligned, this C-terminus consensus motif was still identifiable but with slight variations
(Figure 2) to become [R/K]Px [P/A/R]xx [F/Y]. Within
the subfamilies Maloideae and Amygdeloideae, there
was over 70% similarity of C-terminus. An 18 amino
acid deletion occurred in the C-terminus of both

indicating that this is not a mis-prediction of an exonintron boundary. However, this deletion did not disrupt
the activity of peach MYB10 (see next section). Other
anthocyanin-related MYBs are known to repress the biosynthetic pathway (e.g., FaMYB1, AtMYB3, AtMYBL2).
These contain C-terminal motifs such as the ERF-

associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif or the
TLLLFR motif [22,23]. Such motifs were not found in
any of the MYB10-like predicted proteins identified in
this study.

Figure 4 Analysis of R2R3 DNA binding domains of anthocyanin-promoting MYBs. Alignment (A) of three consensus amino-acid
sequences from 22 rosaceous MYB10s, 38 dicot anthocyanin-promoting MYBs, and the other 134 proteins included in Figure 3A. To obtain three
consensus sequences, the sequences in each of three groups were aligned using AlignX (opening = 15, extension = 0.3) in Vector NTI 9.0, and
residue fraction for consensus was set to 0.9 for the alignments of 22 rosaceous MYB10s and 38 dicot anthocyanin-promoting MYBs, and 0.3 for
the alignment of the other 134 proteins. (B) Frequency of residues at position 90 to 93 of the R2R3 domain covering 168 MYB TFs of Arabidopsis,

for the interaction between MYB and R/B-like bHLH
proteins [44]. All rosaceous MYB sequences, as well as
anthocyanin-related dicot MYBs and PmMBF1 and C1
had this signature. However, other R2R3 MYB TFs also
have this signature (e.g., Arabidopsis MYBs TT2 [12] and
AtMYBL2 [45]). Therefore, the presence of this motif is
not indicative of the candidate MYB being within the
anthocyanin-promoting clade, but rather suggests that
these MYBs require an interacting bHLH partner.

Functional assay of rosaceous MYB activity

Transient luciferase assays in the tobacco species Nicotiana benthamiana have been used to assay MYB activity
against the Arabidopsis DFR-promoter (dihydro flavanoid reductase; At5g42800, [24,46]). Full length cDNAs
of apple (MYB10), wild and cultivated strawberry
(Fv and FaMYB10), rose (RhMYB10) and raspberry
(RiMYB10), and genomic DNA of pear, European plum,
cherry-plum, cherry, apricot, and peach (PcMYB10,

PdmMYB10, PcfMYB10, PavMYB10, ParMYB10, and
PprMYB10, respectively) were cloned into the transient
expression vector pGreen II 0024 62K [46] and transfected into Agrobacterium. These TFs were then coinfected into N. benthamiana leaves with AtDFR-LUC
in a second Agrobacterium strain, with or without a
bHLH co-factor in a third Agrobacterium strain. Transactivation was assayed 3 days later as a change in LUC/
REN ratio.
As shown in Figure 5A, all 11 MYB10s induced the
DFR promoter, but only in the presence of a bHLH
partner (either AtbHLH2, AtbHLH42, MdbHLH3 or
MdbHLH33). In all cases, MYB10 activity increased to
the greatest extent with AtbHLH2 or AtbHLH42. Apple
MYB10 performed well with apple bHLHs. With cherryplum, European plum, apricot, and raspberry, the induction by the MYB and bHLH was highly efficient,
out-performing 35S:Renilla by at least 3-fold. Some of
the MYB10 TFs (e.g., strawberry, pear, peach and rose)
performed poorly with MdbHLH3. The poorest activator
of AtDFR-LUC, PcMYB10, could enhance transcription
of the LUC reporter to 0.45 of 35S:Renilla with
AtbHLH2 as a partner. MYB8, an apple R2R3 MYB
from an unrelated clade, was included as a negative control. The induction of AtDFR-LUC by MdMYB8, with
AtbHLH2, AtbHLH42, MdbHLH3 or MdbHLH33, was
significantly lower than all rosaceous MYB10s.
As previously reported [24] a patch of foliar anthocyanin production can be induced in Nicotiana tabacum
leaves by co-expression of MdMYB10 with MdbHLH3.
Induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in transient assays
by rosaceous MYB10s was tested and found to be
dependent on the co-expression of the bHLH proteins
from Arabidopsis or apple. Patches of anthocyanin were
most apparent with PdmMYB10 and PprMYB10 when
AtbHLH2 was included as a partner (Figure 5B).
Expression of rosaceous MYB10 TFs correlate with
anthocyanin biosynthesis

Expression of sweet cherry PavMYB10 gene transcript
was examined using qPCR analysis during fruit development in two cherry cultivars, ‘Rainier’ and ‘Stella’. These
two cultivars differ in the level of anthocyanin that accumulates in mature fruit (Figure 6A). At maturity, ‘Rainier’
appears pink as anthocyanin accumulates in the fruit
skin, while ‘Stella’ is a deep red variety with high skin and
flesh anthocyanin at maturity. Transcript of PavMYB10
accumulated in the fruit tissues of both cultivars. However, the level of expression is much higher in the fruit of
‘Stella’ compared with ‘Rainier’ at the latter two stages of
fruit development (Figure 6B). Expression of cherry CHS,
an early step in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway,
and cherry LDOX, a later step, showed up-regulation correlated with cherry colour (Figure 6B).

Page 8 of 17

Expression of the strawberry genes, FvMYB10 and
FaMYB10, was examined by qPCR analysis during a
fruit development series of wild diploid strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and cultivated octaploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa; Figure 7). Expression of an R2R3
MYB repressor of anthocyanin biosynthesis, FaMYB1
[19] was also examined in the same fruit series. There
was a large increase in the relative transcript levels of
the MYB10 transcription factor in the fruit tissues
(Figure 7A). In F. ananassa, transcript levels of
FaMYB10 were detectable but low until fruit were full
size (Figure 7B). Upon ripening and colour change,
there was an almost 40,000-fold increase in relative
transcript level. FaMYB1 showed an expression pattern
similar to that published, with the highest transcription
level at the ripe fruit stage [19] while FvMYB1 expression showed little change. Expression levels of FvMYB10
in F. vesca also correlate with colour change. F. vesca
has an earlier colour change, which occurs only in the
skin (Figure 7C). For the mature fruit, the increase of
FaMYB10 is almost 10 times more than that of
FvMYB10. This may be due to cultivated strawberry
fruit having anthocyanin throughout fruit flesh and skin
while the wild strawberry accumulates anthocyanin only
in the outer cell layers of the mature fruit.
Under stressful conditions (high light), the petals of
F. vesca flowers became pigmented (Figure 7D). While
FvMYB1 showed little change in these petals, the transcript of FvMYB10 from this tissue showed a large
increase in accumulation compared with the petals that
were not exposed to high light and were unpigmented.
This is further evidence that MYB10 in strawberry is
involved in regulating anthocyanin accumulation.
Transformation of MYB10 into the crop of origin results
in elevation of anthocyanin biosynthesis

It has been recently reported that transformation of
‘Royal Gala’ apple with 35S:MdMYB10 results in plants
ectopically accumulating anthocyanins [24,42]. In contrast, when 35S:FaMYB10 was transformed into F. ananassa, (using an adapted protocol [47]), callus and
plantlets were not highly pigmented. When these plants
were grown under short day conditions (8 h day, 16 h
night) to encourage flowering and then transferred to
long days, 35S:FaMYB10 plants had elevated foliar
anthocyanins (Figure 8A), and red roots (Figure 8B). All
of the 35S:FaMYB10 transgenic lines had flowers which
showed distinctive red stigmas (Figure 8C). Transgenic
fruit from these lines had immature fruits with red
seeds, and mature fruits with approximately 50% more
anthocyanin. These fruit had the same compound profile as wild-type fruit (cyanidin-glucoside: pelargonidinglucoside: pelargonidin rutinoside at approximately
1:50:5 as measured with HPLC; Figure 8E, Additional

Discussion
The plant MYB family

The MYB TF superfamily illustrates how a relatively
small family in animal genomes (3 members of this TF
type in the human genome by BLAST match)

Page 10 of 17

controlling cell division and differentiation has become
the most abundant TF group in plants [48] with diverse
functions in hormone response [49], growth [50],
epidermal cell fate and formation of trichomes [51], stomatal movements and development [52]; [53], seed
development [54], response to drought [55] and cold
[56,57], pathogen-response [58,59], light-sensing
responses [60,61], sugar-related responses [62], modulation of secondary metabolites such as glucosinolates
[63,64] and phenylpropanoids [65]. MYB proteins have a
conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain of 100-160
residues, depending on the number of R repeats, with
each repeat containing a helix-helix-turn-helix structure.
Within this N-terminal region are key residues important for trans-activation efficiency [66], residues that
regulate and specify DNA binding [14], and interactions
with bHLHs [67]. We have identified in this study several residues shared by anthocyanin-promoting MYBs,
from diverse species, that may be important in their
function (Figure 4).
Consensus motifs in the C-terminus of MYBs, important for function are just beginning to be elucidated.
One such example is the case of the C2 EAR motif
repressor clade. AtMYB4 has the motif NLELRISLPDDV, which is essential for its repressive activity
against the CH4 promoter [20]. This motif (pdLNLD/
ELxiG/S) is also conserved in a number of R2R3 MYB
proteins belonging to subgroup 4 which includes
AtMYB4, AtMYB6, AtMYB7 and AtMYB32, and Antirrhinum AmMYB308 and AmMYB330, which have very
similar effects to AtMYB4 when over-expressed in
tobacco [21]. FaMYB1 also has such a motif [19]. In
anthocyanin-promoting MYBs, the motif KPRPR[S/T]F
was identified [65]. By analysing more MYBs of this
clade we found variation in this C-terminal motif
(Figure 2), but enough conservation to suggest it could
be used as an identifier.
MYBs involved in regulation of phenylpropanoid levels

The phenylpropanoids include flavonoids, anthocyanins,
and proanthocyanidins. The accumulation of these compounds in plants and plant organs is central to such
quality parameters as colour, human health, bitterness
and astringency, as well as plant response to biotic and
abiotic stress. R2R3 MYBs are responsible for controlling different aspects of the phenylpropanoid pathway in
a wide range of different plant species. These include
flavonol-specific MYBs [65], proanthocyanidin-specific
MYBs [68], inhibitors of branch points [69] and R2R3
MYBs specifically controlling the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway genes as well as anthocyanin conjugation, transport into the vacuole [70], and acidification of
this compartment to affect fruit/flower/foliage colour
[71].

In Arabidopsis, one of the R2R3 anthocyanin-related
clades is made up of AtMYB75 (PAP1, At1g56650; [18],
AtMYB90
(AtPAP2,
At1g66390),
AtMYB113
(At1g66370), and AtMYB114 (At1g66380). As three of
these MYBs occur in order on chromosome 1, they may
have arisen by tandem duplications of AtMYB75. Overexpression of PAP1 [70], AtMYB113 and AtMYB114
[26] all result in elevated anthocyanin levels. By

examining homologues of PAP1 in other species, we
have identified residues that predict MYBs involved in
anthocyanin regulation. This anthocyanin-promoting
clade is apparently absent in the rice genome and other
monocots and gymnosperms, suggesting recent divergence of these MYBs.
In apple, three MYB genes have been independently
isolated, all of which control anthocyanin levels and

Figure 8 Transformation of strawberry with 35S:FaMYB10 elevates anthocyanin synthesis. Cultivated strawberry was transformed with 35S:
FaMYB10. Visible reddening was seen in leaves (A; WT on right) and roots (B; WT on right), and in flowers (C; WT on right). Fruits showed red
seeds and elevated anthocyanin (D; transgenic top photos, WT below). Extracted pigment was anthocyanin and increased in all lines (E). Error

show a very high degree of sequence similarity; MYB10,
MYB1 and MYBA. It has been suggested that MYB1 and
MYBA are alleles arising from the different varieties
from which they were cloned [38]. The MYB10 sequence
is more diverse. It is difficult, from sequence analysis
alone, to distinguish between recently duplicated gene
paralogues and allelic variation between different varieties. By designing PCR primers to a region of sequence
common to both MYB10 and MYB1, we were able to
distinguish between the MYB10 allele from ‘Red Field’,
which produces a 1000-bp amplification product and
other MYB10 alleles (from ‘Royal Gala’ amongst others)
and the MYB1 alleles from Pacific Rose™ and ‘Royal
Gala’ that produce a 900-bp fragment. If MYB1 and
MYB10 were paralogues then, in the varieties that only

amplified a 900-bp fragment, this fragment would be the
product of four alleles (i.e. two from each of the parologous genes). However, if MYB10 and MYB1 are allelic,
the 900-bp fragment would only be produced by two
alleles, one from each of the MYB10/MYB1 alleles of the
parents. Accordingly, in red-fleshed varieties which are
heterozygous for the promoter polymorphism, such as
‘Robert’s Crab’, one of the MYB10 alleles produces a
1000-bp fragment, and the other allele a 900-bp fragment. In homozygous Malus sieversii 01P22 there is only
the 1000-bp fragment. In addition to this, if MYB1 was a
paralogue, a further two 900-bp products would be contributed from the MYB1 alleles. As we do not see DNA
fluorescence consistent with a 1:3 amplification of the
1000- and 900-bp fragments, we propose that MYB10

Lin-Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/50

and MYB1/MYBA are alleles. The future availability of
whole genome sequence for apple will aid a conclusion
on the allelic structure of this gene.
Identification of anthocyanin-promoting MYB10 genes in
rosaceous crops

Using degenerate PCR based on the MYB10 sequence,
we have been able to isolate 20 MYB10-like genes from
a range of rosaceous species. Analysis of the genomic
DNA of these species predicts that all the genes contain
two introns in positions consistent with the intron location of other MYB genes [72]. Almost all of the variation in gene size is due to alterations in the predicted
length of intron 2 (Table 1). Aligning intron 2 of Malus
MYB10 (crab and domesticated apple; ~3000 bp) and
Pyrus MYB10 (European and Asian pears; ~500 bp)
revealed a high degree of similarity except within a
region of intron 2 where there appears to have been a
2500-bp insertion. This does not contain inverted
repeats or sequence signatures that are indicative of
mobile genetic elements such as transposons or helitrons [73]. This insertion could be the result of a local
genome rearrangement that took place after the speciation of apple and pear, but before the divergence of
apple and crab apples.
Botanical classification of the Rosaceae has recently
been undertaken using 88 species analysed for a combination of phenotypic and molecular marker [74]. Using
the nuclear encoded genes, polygalacturonase inhibitor
protein (PGIP) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), a weak or
conflicting phylogenic resolution was produced. We have
complemented this analysis, on a smaller dataset, by adding additional information relating to a single copy
nuclear gene, where orthology has been inferred by both
sequence and functional characterisation. The phylogenic
placements are in broad agreement with the Pyrinae subtribe and Amygdaloideae tribe described [74].

may indicate a degree of specificity that exists for the
apple bHLH gene and its association with apple MYB
gene and target promoter. However, the degree of transactivation, and interaction with bHLH partners, varies
greatly amongst the rosaceous MYBs genes tested
(Figure 5). In particular, plum and apricot showed transactivation values in excess of five times that of the 35Spromoter. Such high trans-activation potential may be
due to more effective interaction of plum and cherry
MYBs with tobacco transcription factors endogenous
within the transient assay, or could point to an
enhanced ability of these MYBs to promote high levels
of anthocyanin. Further analysis of these MYB TFs in
homologous systems is required, and techniques such as
yeast-2-hybrid used to probe which protein residues are
responsible for strong or weak interactions.
MYB10 expression is strongly associated with
anthocyanin production in fruits

Transient activation of the anthocyanin pathway by
rosaceous MYB10s requires a bHLH

During fruit development, in both strawberry and
cherry, the transcript level of MYB10 was up-regulated.
A correlation between transcript and anthocyanin production has already been reported in apple [24,38,39]. In
a cherry cultivar which has lower anthocyanin levels at
maturity the expression of MYB10 transcript was lower
than in a dark-fruited cultivar. It remains for these
genes to be mapped in crops segregating for different
pigmentation levels. However, for apple, MYB10/MYB1/
MYBA is the major gene in a crossed population segregating for red flesh [75] and red skin [38].
Transformation of strawberry with FaMYB10 resulted
in plants with elevated root, foliar and fruit anthocyanin
levels (Figure 8). These levels were not as high as previously reported in 35S:MdMYB10 apple transformants
[24], due perhaps to other partners in the MYB/bHLH/
WD40 complex. It has been shown recently that tomato
fruits, with elevated anthocyanins due to over-expression
of MYB and bHLH members of the MBW complex, are
responsible for promoting human health attributes
[6,76].

Within the R2R3 domain of all 20 MYB10s there were
several key motifs suggesting an association with a
bHLH partner. Several anthocyanin-promoting MYBs
have been assayed in heterologous systems; for example,
tobacco [24,39], Arabidopsis [39] or Antirrhinum petal
cells [34] and this trans-activation is often enhanced by
the co-infiltration of an appropriate bHLH gene
[24,37,42]. We used transient assay of rosaceous MYB
genes, with the DFR promoter from Arabidopsis and
bHLH genes from either apple or Arabidopsis. All of the
isolated MYB TFs were able to trans-activate the DFR
promoter in the presence of at least one of the four
bHLHs tested. Only the apple MYB10 gene responded
equally to either apple or Arabidopsis bHLH genes. This

Conclusions
The Rosaceae family-wide characterisation of MYBs provides insight into the evolution of this TF and has implications for the understanding of temporal-spatial colour
change. Our identification of this set of MYBs will aid
development of new rosaceous fruit and flowers by
allowing the testing of co-segregation of MYB alleles
with pigment phenotypes in Rosaceae, which are both
common and highly sought after (e.g., rose, plum,
cherry, peach). If these candidate genes do segregate for
anthocyanin levels, gene-based marker-assisted selection
or even cisgenics could be used in breeding programmes. This approach has worked for apple [75] and

Lin-Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/50

there is preliminary evidence that PavMYB10 co-locates
with a QTL for fruit and flesh colour in cherry (A. Iezzoni and J. Bushakra, pers. comm.) and PprMYB10 colocates with anther colour segregating in the peach
reference map (J. Bushakra and P. Arus, pers. comm.).
This group of transcription factors therefore becomes
useful as a breeding and biotechnological tool.

Methods
Isolation of rosaceous transcription factors

Fruit and leaf samples of 20 rosaceous species were collected as follows: crab apple (Malus sylvestris), sweet
cherry (Prunus avium), sour cherry (Prunus cerasus),
almond (Prunus dulcis), peach (Prunus persica), Japanese plum (Prunus salicina) and rose (Rosa hybrida)
from Auckland Botanic Gardens (Auckland, New Zealand); quince (Cydonia oblonga), loquat (Eriobotrya japonica), medlar (Mespilus germanica), pear (Pyrus
communis), apricot (Prunus armeniaca), Damson (Prunus insititia), European plum (Prunus domestics),
cherry-plum (Prunus cerasifera) from local gardens
(Auckland, New Zealand); strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa and Fragaria vesca) from Plant & Food Research
greenhouse (Auckland, New Zealand); red raspberry
‘Latham’ (Rubus idaeus), pear ‘Nashi’ (Pyrus pyrifolia),
and Chinese pear ‘Yali’ (Pyrus × bretschneideri) from
various Plant & Food Research orchards.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) was isolated using an
adapted method [77] from pigmented fruit or flower tissue, and genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated (DNeasy
Plant Mini Kit, Qiagen) from young leaves or flower
buds. MYB10s of pear (Pyrus communis) and cherryplum (Prunus cerasifera) were successfully obtained by
applying various primers based on MdMYB10 in cDNA
or gDNA PCR amplification. With more primers based
on PcMYB10 and PcfMYB10, MYB10s from two subfamilies, Maloideae and Amygdaloideae, were completed
by overlapping PCR fragments. For the subfamily Rosoideae, which includes Fragaria, Rubus and Rosa, degenerate primers, designed to the consensus DNA sequence
of R2R3 binding domain were used in 5’ and 3’ GeneRace (GeneRacer Kit, Invitrogen). The complete sequence
for MYB10 was compiled from overlapping fragments
and full length clones were isolated using gene-specific
primers designed to the 5’ and 3’ UTR regions. Phylogenic trees were generated using MEGA 3.1, a minimum
evolution phylogeny test and 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Dual luciferase assay of transiently transformed Nicotiana
benthamiana leaves

The promoter of Arabidopsis DFR (TT3, AT5g42800)
was isolated from genomic Arabidopsis DNA and cloned
into pGreenII 0800-LUC vector [46]. MYB10 cDNA or
gDNA full length sequence from 10 selected rosaceous

Page 14 of 17

species was cloned into pGreen II 62-SK 0029 binary
vectors [46].
Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown under
glasshouse conditions until about 5 cm in height.
Approximately 150 μl of Agrobacterium culture was
infiltrated at four points into a young leaf. Three days
after inoculation, 3-mm leaf discs (4 technical replicates
from each plant) were cut with a hole-puncher, placed
into wells of a 96-well-plate containing 50 μl of PBS
(phosphate buffered saline) in each well, and gently
crushed with the hole-puncher. The measurement and
analysis was carried out using an Orion Microplate
Luminometer (Berthold Detection System), using the
manufacturer’s recommended conditions.
PCR expression analysis

Strawberry fruits from Fragaria × ananassa and Fragaria vesca were collected at six time points during fruit
development: stage 1, pre-opened bud; stage 2, fully
open flower; stage 3, petal drop; stage 4, expanding
fruitlet; stage 5, expanded fruit; stage 6, red-ripe fruit,
from plants grown under glasshouse conditions, using
natural light with daylight extension to 16 h. In one
instance, Fragaria vesca was grown under constant
lighting, inducing red pigmented petals. RNA was
isolated [77] from fruit (six samples from the same
plant, skin and cortex combined), and red and white
petals. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out by
using oligo dT according to the manufacturer’s instructions (SuperScript III, Invitrogen). As the identity
between cDNA sequences of Fragaria × ananassa and
Fragaria vesca is as high as 95%, a set of qPCR primers
was designed for both species using Vector NTI to a
stringent set of criteria, enabling application under universal reaction conditions.
To eliminate gDNA contamination, both forward and
reverse primers were designed to span an intron/exon
boundary. The strawberry actin primers were based on
the actin sequence of Fragaria × ananassa (Genebank
number AB116565). The reverse primer of actin was
also designed to span an intron.
Sweet cherry (Prunus avium) ‘Stella’ and ‘Rainier’ were
collected at three time points during fruit development:
stage 1, green fruitlet; stage 2, expanding fruit; stage 3,
mature fruit, from a Plant & Food Research orchard
(Clyde, New Zealand). Actin primers were based on the
actin sequence of closely related sour cherry Prunus cerasus (Genebank number EE488162). The method of
RNA extraction and the principles of primer design
were the same as strawberry.
Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) DNA amplification
and analysis was carried out using the LightCycler System
(Roche LightCycler 1.5, Roche), with LightCycler software
version 4. The LightCycler FastStart SYBR Green Master

Lin-Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/50

Mix (Roche) was used, and the 10 μl of total reaction
volume applied in all the reactions following the manufacturer’s method. qPCR conditions were 5 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95°C, 5 s at 60°C, and 10 s at
72°C, followed by 65°C to 95°C melting curve detection.
The qPCR efficiency of each gene was obtained by analysing the standard curve of a cDNA serial dilution of that
gene. The expression was normalized to Fragaria × ananassa actin and Prunus cerasus actin with Fragaria vesca
stage 1 flower bud and Prunus avium ’Rainier’ stage 1
fruitlet acting as calibrator with a nominal value of 1.
Actin was selected as a reference gene because of its consistent transcript level throughout fruits and leaves. To
confirm the amplification of the expected DNA sequence,
qPCR amplicons were sequenced.
Endpoint PCR analysis used in the apple MYB allele
study was carried out using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen).
Reaction conditions were 95°C, 5 min followed by 35
cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 60 s at 72°C.
PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and
stained with ethidium bromide. Primer sequences are
listed in Additional File 4.

components by HPLC. The HPLC system consisted of a
Waters Alliance Separation Module (model 2690) and a
photodiode array detector (model 996) under the control of Chromeolen® (Dionex, USA) software. The
separation column used was a Zorbax Rapid Resolution
SB-C18 4.6 × 150 mm (Agilent, USA) with a binary solvent program (A = formic acid/MQ water (5:95); B =
acetonitrile) that started at 95% A 5% B at injection,
changed to 80%A 20%B at 9 minutes; 20%A 80%B at 18
minutes and held for 2 minutes before returning to 95%
A 5%B ready for the next sample injection. Total flow
rate was 0.8 mL/min and sample injection volumes were
5 μL. Anthocyanin components were detected at 530
nm, and peaks indentified by retention time with
authentic standards, and previous reports of strawberry
anthocyanins.

Growth of Strawberry plants and Generation of 35S:
FaMYB10 Fragaria × ananassa plants

Strawberry plants of Fragaria × ananassa and Fragaria
vesca were grown under controlled conditions (23°C
day, 15°C night) in a short day room (8 h day, 16 h
night) for 3 months, then plants were moved to long
day conditions (16 h day, 8 h night, 25°C day, 15°C
night) to encourage flowering.
Surface sterilized seeds were germinated on 1/2 MS
basal salt and vitamins (Duchefa) + 3% sucrose + 0.7%
agar (Germantown) (pH 5.7) medium. Seedlings were
sub-cultured onto fresh medium every four weeks.
Young leaves excised from in vitro grown shoots were
cut into ~1 × 2 mm leaf strips. Transformation was via
an adapted protocol (from [47] with Agrobacterium
tumefaciens strain EHA105 [78], harbouring the binary
plasmid pGreen II 0029 62-sk [79] containing the NOS/
NPT II for kanamycin resistance, and a CaMV 35s promoter-driven full length FaMYB10 cDNA.
HPLC measurement of strawberry fruits

Two mature strawberry fruits were taken from each of
three plants representing two transgenic lines and a
wild-type control. The fruits were freeze-dried for at
least 24 h. The dried tissue was then pulverized, resuspended in ethanol: distilled water: formic acid (80:20:1)
with the ratio of 5 mL solvent to 1 g of original fresh
fruit weight, extracted at room temperature for 3 h in
the dark, centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min. A 1-ml
aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed for anthocyanin
