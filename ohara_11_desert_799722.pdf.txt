Abstract
Background: Desert hedgehog (DHH) belongs to the hedgehog gene family that act as secreted intercellular signal
transducers. DHH is an essential morphogen for normal testicular development and function in both mice and
humans but is not present in the avian lineage. Like other hedgehog proteins, DHH signals through the patched
(PTCH) receptors 1 and 2. Here we examine the expression and protein distribution of DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 in
the developing testes of a marsupial mammal (the tammar wallaby) to determine whether DHH signalling is a
conserved factor in gonadal development in all therian mammals.
Results: DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 were present in the marsupial genome and highly conserved with their eutherian
orthologues. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that DHH has recently evolved and is a mammal-specific hedgehog
orthologue. The marsupial PTCH2 receptor had an additional exon (exon 21a) not annotated in eutherian PTCH2
proteins. Interestingly we found evidence of this exon in humans and show that its translation would result in a
truncated protein with functions similar to PTCH1. We also show that DHH expression was not restricted to the
testes during gonadal development (as in mice), but was also expressed in the developing ovary. Expression of
DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 in the adult tammar testis and ovary was consistent with findings in the adult mouse.
Conclusions: These data suggest that there is a highly conserved role for DHH signalling in the differentiation and
function of the mammalian testis and that DHH may be necessary for marsupial ovarian development. The
receptors PTCH1 and PTCH2 are highly conserved mediators of hedgehog signalling in both the developing and
adult marsupial gonads. Together these findings indicate DHH is an essential therian mammal-specific morphogen
in gonadal development and gametogenesis.

Background
Desert hedgehog (DHH) is a member of the hedgehog
gene family which act as secreted intercellular signal
transducers [1]. Hedgehog was first identified as a segment polarity gene in Drosophila and has since been
identified as a key regulator of pattern formation in
embryonic and adult development in many vertebrate
and invertebrate species. In addition, the hedgehog gene
has undergone duplications in both invertebrates and
vertebrates to produce a number of orthologues [2-6].

Mammals have three hedgehog orthologues, Sonic
(Shh), Indian (Ihh), and desert (Dhh) hedgehog [3,4,7-9].
All three share a striking homology with the Drosophila
orthologue [10]. Each mammalian orthologue has a
unique, largely non-overlapping expression pattern,
except in the gut where Ihh and Shh are co-expressed,
and in the adult ovaries where Ihh and Dhh are coexpressed [11,12]. Shh has an essential role in early fetal
development, and is required for correct formation of
the limbs, phallus, somites and neural tube [8-10]. Ihh
has a more restricted developmental role, and is essential for chondrocyte development [13]. Dhh is essential
for the maintenance of the male germ line and spermatogenesis [14]. Dhh is also expressed in Schwann cells,

and appears to play a role in nerve sheath formation
[15,16].
Hedgehog actions are mediated at the cell surface by a
multi-component receptor complex comprising the
patched (PTCH) receptors and smoothened (SMO) protein [17]. Both proteins have orthologues in Drosophila
that are also involved in hedgehog signal transduction
and pattern formation. Initially, all three hedgehog protein functions were thought to be mediated through the
PTCH1 receptor in mammals. However, a second orthologue was identified, PTCH2, which shares significant
sequence homology with PTCH1. PTCH1 and PTCH2
both bind all hedgehog family members with similar
affinities, and each forms a complex with SMO. However, the expression patterns of PTCH1 and PTCH2 do
not entirely overlap, suggesting some degree of functional specialization [18]. While PTCH1 is widely
expressed throughout the mouse embryo, PTCH2 is
most predominant in the skin and in testis [18].
In the mouse, Dhh is expressed in the presumptive
testis from E11.5 through to adult stages. Dhh was initially thought to be specifically expressed in the testis in
the pre-Sertoli cells and so it was suggested it may be
directly modulated by Sry [1,10,19] or its downstream
partner Sox9 [20-22]. Dhh-null male mice are sex
reversed [21,23], their gonads are small and devoid of
sperm and the mice develop as phenotypic females due
to a lack of male steroid hormone production [20,21].
Leydig cell numbers are dramatically decreased in the
Dhh null gonad, but are not entirely absent [24]. Dhh
appears to be an important regulator of Leydig cell
development since its over-expression in the somatic
cells can induce Leydig cell development [25]. In contrast to the Dhh-null males, female mice lacking the
Dhh gene develop normally and are fertile [1]. While
Dhh does not appear to be important for ovarian development, Dhh mRNA has been detected in the granulosa
cells of preantral and antral follicles suggesting it can be
activated in an SRY-independent manner [1,12,24-26].
In humans, mutations in DHH cause a range of phenotypes in 46, XY male patients from mild [27] to complete gonadal dysgenesis, including bilateral streak
gonads, normally developed Müllerian ducts, and female
external genitalia [28].
The majority of genes involved in testicular differentiation are highly conserved among the vertebrates [29].
However, no DHH orthologue has been identified in
birds, although a paralogue (annotated as DHH) is present in the zebrafish (Danio), anole lizard (Anolis) and
African clawed frog (Xenopus) genomes http://www.
ensembl.org. Here we describe high conservation of
DHH, PTCH1 and 2 in the genome of a marsupial, the
tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). Marsupials, have
been evolving independently of eutherian mammals for

Page 2 of 12

130- 148 million years [30]. To determine when DHH
evolved its role in mammalian testicular development,
we examined the expression of DHH and its receptors
PTCH1 and 2 during marsupial gonad development.

Methods
Animals

Tammar wallabies of Kangaroo Island, South Australia
origin were maintained in our breeding colony in open
grassy enclosures. Husbandry, handling and experiments
were in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia/Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization/Australian
Research Council (1990) guidelines and approved by the
University of Melbourne Animal Experimentation Ethics
Committees.
Pregnancies were initiated by removal of the pouch
young (RPY) from animals carrying a blastocyst in
embryonic diapause [31,32]. The day of RPY is designated Day 0 of pregnancy and births occur 26-27 days
later [32]. Fetuses were removed from the uterus, dissected and tissues snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for
mRNA expression analyses or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C for protein localization. The sex
of the fetus or pouch young was determined by the presence of scrotal bulges in males or mammary primordia
in females [33] or by PCR for SRY [34]. The developing
gonadal ridge first becomes apparent around day 22 of
gestation in the fetal tammar wallaby [35]. We examined
gonads from day 23 of gestation through to adulthood
in both males and females.
Cloning of a tammar wallaby Dhh, PTCH1 and PTCH2

A full length DHH cDNA clone was isolated from a
lambda-Zap II cDNA library (constructed from total
RNA combined from male and female day 5 postpartum
pouch young). The cDNA library was constructed by
Clontech Laboratories. Libraries were plated to a density
of 120, 000 plaque-forming units per 22 × 22 cm Nunc
plate. The library was screened with a full-length mouse
Dhh cDNA probe at 60°C in Church’s buffer [36].
PTCH1 and 2 sequences were partially isolated from
the tammar wallaby genome trace-archives http://www.
ensembl.org. PCR and RACE was used to fully characterise the open reading frame (primers listed in Additional file 1) of each receptor. PCR fragments were
cloned into p-GEM-T-Easy plasmid (Promega) and
sequenced to verify. RACE was performed according to
manufacturers instructions (Roche).
Phylogenetic analyses

Complete cDNA sequences for annotated, full-length
hedgehog and patched family members were obtained
from the Ensembl database (Ensembl identification

numbers listed in Additional file 2) and aligned using
MUSCLE http://www.ebi.ac.uk. Trees with fewer than
20 nodes were constructed by aligning sequences using
MUSCLE and assembling tree with Mr.Bayes 3.1.2 at
100, 000 generations, sampled every 100 with burnin set
to the first 250. Larger trees were aligned with TCoffee
http://www.ebi.ac.uk and assembled with Mr.Bayes 3.1.2
at 1, 000, 000 generations, sampled every 1000 with burnin set to the first 250. All trees were viewed and
ordered in FigTree 1.3.1.
RNA extraction

Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues using the
GenElute Total RNA mini kit (Sigma). RNA was DNase
treated using the DNAfree reagent (Ambion). DNA free
RNA was reverse transcribed using a dT primer and the
superscript III kit according to manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). All RT-PCR derived products were
sequence verified as described above.
Immunohistochemistry

Tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and embedded
in paraffin wax according to standard methods. Deparaffinised tissue sections (8 μm) were treated with 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 5 min to quench
endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieval was
achieved by placing slides in boiling 0.05 M Tris HCL
pH 9.0 for 20 min. Primary antibodies were applied to
sections as follows; DHH (anti-mouse DHH, goat polyclonal IgG, R&D Systems, cat.#AF196), 1:400, PTCH1
(anti-human PTCH1, rabbit polyclonal IgG, Abcam, cat.
#AB39266) 1:400 and PTCH2 (anti-human PTCH2, rabbit polyclonal IgG, Lifespan BioSciences, cat#LS-B301)
1:400. The DHH antibody was verified by Western Blot
to detect a single protein of 43 kDa (the predicted size
of the tammar wallaby DHH protein; result not shown
Additional file 3). Furthermore, DHH is the primary
hedgehog ligand expressed in the marsupial gonad [37].
While the PTCH1 and 2 antibodies were not validated
by western blot in the tammar wallaby, the PTCH1 and
PTCH2 antibodies were raised against epitopes that
share 99 and 100% homology respectively with the analogous tammar target proteins, but that show no cross
reactivity. In addition, no other homologous sequences
exist within the tammar genome with which the antibody could non-specifically cross react [38]. Primary
antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight. Depending
on the primary antibody, the secondary antibody was
either an anti-goat IgG raised in rabbit (Millipore) or an
anti-rabbit IgG raised in goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), both conjugated to biotin and used at a 1:250 dilution. Signal was amplified using the ABC kit (Vector
Labs) and visualised using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole
(AEC) (Vector Labs) and sections were counterstained

with haematoxylin. Immunohistochemistry was performed on at least 3 independent samples at each stage.
Negative controls were performed as above with the primary antibody omitted.
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation Mapping

Chromosomes were prepared from peripheral blood
according to standard methods [39]. Chromosome in
situ suppression (CISS) hybridisation of the genomic
lambda clones was performed, with minor modifications
[40]. The largest DHH cDNA clone was labelled with
digoxigenin using nick translation. The labelled probe
was incubated with 50 ng of tammar wallaby Cot1 DNA
before hybridisation to tammar-fixed metaphase chromosome spreads for 48 h at 37°C. Slides were washed in
0.2 × SSC at 60°C and hybridisation detected with antiDIG-mouse antibody (Serva), followed by tetramethyl
rhodamine iso-thiocyanate (TRITC) conjugated goatanti-mouse antibody (Serva). Following hybridisation,
the slides were counterstained with DAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to visualise the chromosomes.
Expression analyses

RT-PCR was carried out according to standard methods
using oligo dT primed cDNA (superscript III, Invitrogen) and 30 PCR cycles. No-template negative controls
were included in each round, and in each case showed
no amplification (data not shown). A single sample was
used for each amplification.
Quantitative PCR was similarly performed on oligo dT
primed, reverse transcribed mRNA was prepared as outlined above. Quantitative PCR was carried out using the
IQ Sybr green master mix (BioRad) in 20 ul reactions
using primers for tammar DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2
(Table 1) and normalised to b-actin as previously
described [41]. Each PCR was performed on a single sample in triplicate (except for the adult ovary which was verified on three independent samples) and only those
samples with a standard deviation of less than 1 cycle considered for analyses. Relative changes in gene expression
were analysed using the methods described by Pfaffl
[39,42]. The variance in cycle threshold (ΔCt) was normalised across samples (with beta actin levels set to 100%)
and inversely plotted as a percentage of the earliest ΔCt.

Results
Isolation of the tammar wallaby DHH cDNA

Eight independent cDNA clones of DHH were isolated
from the tammar wallaby pouch-young cDNA library. The
two cDNA clones containing the longest 5’ and 3’ UTRs
and overlapping with each other in the coding region were
sequenced. The combined length of the two DHH clones
was 2.38 kb with a predicted open reading frame of 1, 197
bp. This encoded a protein of 399 amino acids with a

O’Hara et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/72

predicted molecular weight of 44 kD. There were several
common features between the predicted tammar DHH
protein and that of mouse [43]. A short stretch of N-terminal residues (25 for the tammar and 22 for the mouse)
were highly hydrophobic and presumed to function as a
signalling peptide. There was a conserved 6 amino acid
stretch, CGPGRG, after the signal peptide used to generate
the secreted form of DHH. Drosophila hedgehog protein
and vertebrate Shh, and Dhh proteins are processed into
two smaller secreted peptides by an auto-proteolytic process, both in vitro and in vivo [44]. The catalytic site, GCF,
was conserved in the tammar DHH protein, suggesting a
similar auto-proteolytic mechanism may also occur to produce a 19.9 kD N-terminal peptide (amino acids 1-200)
and a 21.6 kD C-terminal peptide (amino acids 201-403).
Furthermore, the tammar and mouse DHH proteins share
96% identity in the N-terminal peptide and 94.5% in the
C-terminal peptide, implying that both regions have been
highly conserved during evolution (Additional file 4).
PTCH1 and 2 were partially isolated from the tammar
wallaby genome http://www.ensembl.org. PCR and
RACE was used to fill in missing portions to complete
the open reading frame for each gene. PTCH1 was
seven amino acids longer than its human orthologue
and shares 83% sequence homology and 96% amino acid
similarity. Conservation was particularly high (85%100%) in the transmembrane domains and there was
complete conservation of the putative glycosylation sites
(Additional file 5).
PTCH2 was more divergent, but still shared 79%
sequence identity and 89% amino acid similarity with
eutherian orthologues. The tammar PTCH2 predicted
protein was 11 amino acids shorter at the N-terminus
compared to eutherian PTCH2. In addition we identified
a 70 amino acid contiguous insertion immediately
downstream of the 12th (last) transmembrane domain
located at the C-terminus, which was present in cDNA
isoforms isolated from both the day 3 and day 14 post
partum (pp) testis (Figure 1). A relaxed Blast search of
the non-redundant protein and nucleotide database with
this 70 amino acid (210 base pair) sequence failed to
return any homology in any described species, except
for hits to human and opossum PTCH2 in the same
location, downstream of the terminal transmembrane
domain. The insertion shows 70% nucleotide identity
and 79% amino acid similarity with human. Interestingly, one of the base changes in the human sequence
(corresponding to amino acid 35) produced a premature
stop codon (Figure 1a). As a result, there were no
human protein hits that included this region, only
nucleotide homology, and no known ESTs mapping to
the nucleotide stretch. The sequence maps to reads in
the unannotated genome archives of the opossum with
81% nucleotide identity and 77% amino acid similarity.

21a in mammals. Exon 21a was present in the common therian
ancestor (blue arrowhead). The exon was retained without a
nonsense codon in the marsupial lineage (blue arrowhead), was
mutated in humans to contain a premature stop resulting in the
Δ-22 isoform (red arrowhead) and was lost in the rodent lineage
(green arrowhead).

The sequence shows low homology (< 30% contiguous
nucleotide similarity) to mouse and cow gDNA in the
same region. Additional exon aside, the C-terminus was
the most variable region both within and between
eutherians and marsupials (Additional file 6a). As with
PTCH1, the transmembrane domains and glycosylation
sites were all extremely conserved with 90-100%
sequence identity within these regions. Additionally,
multiple truncated splice variants of PTCH2 showing
developmentally-regulated expression were identified
during the subcloning process (Additional file 6b).
Phylogenetic relationships of DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 to
eutherian and non-mammalian vertebrates

A phylogenetic analysis of DHH sequences grouped
them into four main clusters, one for primates, another

elephant, mouse, and hyrax, a third for pig, dog, and
dolphin; tammar was an outlier (Additional file 7a).
These groupings are largely consistent with the accepted
mammalian phylogenetic tree and all eutherian clusters
show equal divergence.
DHH orthologues are absent from the bird genome,
but are annotated in other non-mammalian vertebrates
including the anole lizard, African clawed frog, zebrafish,
medaka, stickleback and puffer fish. To determine the
evolutionary relationship of these orthologues to mammalian DHH we constructed a phylogenetic tree (as
described above) using complete sequences for SHH,
IHH and DHH for all vertebrate species, as well as for
the zebrafish specific echidna (EHH) and tiggywinkle
(TWHH) hedgehog genes [45]. Our analyses show that
the non-mammalian DHH orthologues do not cluster
with the DHH of mammals, but instead form a highly
divergent out-group, suggesting that these paralogues
had an independent evolutionary origin (Figure 2; Additional file 8) and are hereafter referred to as the fishy
hedgehogs (Fhh).
The PTCH analyses were less inclusive as only a few
species had complete open reading frame sequences
available. However, the PTCH1 phylogenetic tree
mimicked standard mammalian groupings, with the
tammar clustering with other mammals, and zebrafish

as the outlier (Additional file 7b). Phylogenetic analysis
of PTCH2 grouped tammar PTCH2 with that of other
mammals, but as the most divergent lineage. PTCH2
was more divergent between species than DHH or
PTCH1 (Additional file 7c).
All full-length proteins used for phylogenetic analyses
were obtained from Ensembl and are listed in Additional file 2.
Genomic localisation of the tammar wallaby DHH cDNA

A single localization signal was observed for tammar
wallaby DHH on chromosome 1q in approximately 50%
of spreads examined, with no other consistent localization signals seen (Figure 3).
Expression of DHH in the tammar wallaby

DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 expression was examined in
the gonads throughout fetal and pouch young development using an RT-PCR assay. In contrast to the mouse,
DHH was expressed in the gonads of both male and
female fetuses and pouch young. DHH was expressed
from the first appearance of the genital ridge until after
testicular and ovarian differentiation had occurred and
persisted in the adult (Figure 4a). In addition, both
PTCH1 and PTCH2 were expressed throughout gonadal
development, through to adulthood. Although not quantitative, PTCH2 expression appeared to be expressed at
a lower level than PTCH1. In the testis, both PTCH1
and PTCH2 were present from 1 day after birth, around
the time of initiation of cord formation in the tammar
(Figure 4a).
A limited quantitative real-time PCR profile confirmed
the presence of DHH at all stages of gonad development
in both testes and ovaries (Figure 4b-d). DHH mRNA

consistent throughout gonad development. PTCH2 mRNA levels were always higher than PTCH1 in the gonads, and levels were consistently
lowest for both genes in the adult ovary.

levels were similar in the developing male and female
gonads at all stages examined, but in adult gonads ovarian expression was low (Figure 4b). PTCH1 expression
was consistent throughout gonadal development in

males and females, with lowest levels seen in the adult
ovary (Figure 4c). In contrast, PTCH2 levels remained
constant in the gonad of both males and females at all
stages examined including in the adult (Figure 4d). All

three genes were also expressed in the prostate and
adrenal albeit at lower levels than in the developing
gonads.
DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 protein distribution during
gonadogenesis

DHH was widely distributed throughout the bipotential
gonad, PTCH1 and 2 staining was present but very weak
(Additional file 9, d24 fetus). By day 1 pp the cords were
beginning to form in the testis, and DHH stained preSertoli cells that were coalescing into cord- like structures (Additional file 9, D1pp). PTCH1 protein stained
weakly throughout the gonad while PTCH2 appeared
more prominent and was localized outside the forming
cords. At day 9 pp cords were fully formed in the developing testis. DHH protein was present throughout the
gonad and was strongly detected in some Sertoli cells
and in the peritubular myoid cells and at the basement
membrane. PTCH1 was diffuse throughout the gonad
but was mainly localised in the Sertoli cells and absent
from the interstitium. Conversely, PTCH2 staining was
more intense and concentrated in Leydig cells in the
interstitium (Figure 5). In the adult testis, DHH was

Page 7 of 12

present at low levels in all cell types, but strong staining
was seen in round spermatids from the post pachytene
primary spermatocyte stage, through to the mature
sperm. PTCH1 was present at high levels in the Leydig
cells and showed a punctate distribution reminiscent of
membrane bound protein recycling [46]. PTCH2 distribution also became highly restricted and localised
strongly in the Sertoli cells (Figure 5).
The ovary becomes clearly differentiated around day 8
pp in the tammar [35]. At day 9 pp DHH staining was
diffuse throughout the gonad along with PTCH1 and
PTCH2 (Additional file 10). However, all three proteins
were noticeably absent from the germ cells. By day 72
pp DHH was present in low levels across the ovary, but
strongly localised within the germ cells that have coalesced into nests. PTCH1 was also expressed in the
germ cells at this stage, while PTCH2 staining was weak
and primarily in the interstitial tissue (Additional file 9).
In the adult ovary, DHH was present but weak throughout the gonad. PTCH1 staining was only weakly
detected in the granulosa cells of antral follicles, but
increased in the cumulus cells of mature follicles. Staining was also seen in the steroidogenic theca cells.

Figure 5 Immunohistochemistry of DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 in the tammar wallaby testis at key developmental time points. Red/
brown staining indicates protein distribution while the heamatoxalin counterstain appears blue. It is important to note that DHH is a highly
secreted molecule and staining does not imply cell of origin. DHH staining was most intense at the basal lamina (BL). In the adult staining is
concentrated in the develop spermatocytes (GC). At day D9pp PTCH1 was present within the Sertoli cells (SC) while PTCH2 was predominant in
the Leydig cells (LC). This expression profile is reversed in the adult testis with PTCH1 found predominantly in the Leydig cells, while PTCH2 was
predominate in the Sertoli cells. Scale bars indicate 40 μm, controls show immunohistochemistry with the primary antibody omitted.

O’Hara et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/72

PTCH2 showed a similar distribution to PTCH1 but was
abundant in the granulosa, cumulus and theca cells (Figure 6). DHH, PTCH1, and PTCH2 were also detected in
the corpus luteum (Additional file 9).

Discussion
We have shown that DHH is a highly conserved mammal specific hedgehog paralogue with conserved expression during mammalian gonadogenesis. DHH and its
receptors PTCH1 and 2 are highly conserved at the protein level and are expressed in an analogous pattern to
that seen in the mouse gonad. However, DHH was
expressed in the developing marsupial ovary in contrast
to the mouse, in which it is testis-specific during
development.

across vertebrates shows that non-mammalian DHH
genes in fish form a distinct subgroup, distantly related
to mammalian DHH genes, indicating they have had an
independent evolutionary origin. We have re-named this

Page 8 of 12

sub-group fishy hedgehog (FHH) to emphasise their distinction from the DHH genes. This suggests that the
evolution of mammalian DHH is a recent event (Figure
2) making it quite unique among the gonadal differentiation genes, all of which have orthologues in the nonmammalian vertebrates with the notable exception of
the sex determination switch gene SRY, which is also
mammal specific [47]. Despite its recent origin, DHH
was extremely highly conserved between marsupials and
eutherians, suggesting it quickly adopted an essential
function in mammalian reproduction.
The hedgehog receptors PTCH1 and 2 were highly
conserved between marsupials, eutherians and nonmammalian vertebrates. Marsupial PTCH2 was the
most divergent (especially in the C-terminal region,
consistent with findings in other vertebrate species
[48]) but still shared 89% amino acid similarity with
eutherian orthologues. The tammar PTCH2 C-terminus contained a 70 amino acid additional exon not
found in eutherian PTCH2 proteins. Interestingly,

Figure 6 Immunohistochemistry of DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 in the tammar wallaby ovary. DHH was found in the granulosa cells (GC) of
follicles at all stages of development, and in the oocyte cytoplasm shown in primordial follicles (PrF). Staining was also observed for all three
proteins in the cumulus cells (CC). PTCH1 and PTCH2 showed a similar distribution in the granulosa cells and were also present at reduced levels
in the theca (T). PTCH2 staining was evident in the oocyte but PTCH1 was not. Scale bars indicate 160 μm, controls show immunohistochemistry
with the primary antibody omitted.

significant homology to the additional tammar exon
was identified in the human PTCH2 genomic
sequence, in intron 21, and shared 70% identity at the
nucleotide level and 79% amino acid similarity with
the tammar additional exon (hereafter referred to as
exon 21a). The level of conservation of this exon
between marsupials and humans was much higher
than that of non-functional intronic DNA, suggesting
functional conservation of the sequence. Translation of
the human sequence revealed a premature stop codon
at amino acid 35, so its inclusion in the transcript
would lead to a PTCH2 receptor with a severely truncated intracellular signalling domain (Figure 1b). Such
an isoform, lacking exon 22, identical to the one predicted from the inclusion of the human putative exon
21a, has been previously identified (the Δ-22 isoform)
[18]. The human Δ-22 PTCH2 isoform is the only one
capable of acting as a strong inhibitor of SHH induction, similar in function to PTCH1 [18]. It appears that
the ability to produce such an isoform was derived
from a stochastic nonsense mutation in the original
exon 21a leading to a truncated protein. The tammar
does not have a premature stop (exon 21a is an intact
ORF) and so this tammar PTCH2 isoform does not
share redundancy with PTCH1 function. The degree of
conservation of this region in humans suggests that it
has only recently become non-functional in primate
evolution. It is intriguing then, that this sequence
could not be identified in any other mammalian
PTCH2 loci, but only in the tammar, opossum, and
human. These findings suggest that the exon was present in the ancestral PTCH2 gene and has been independently lost in different eutherian lineages (Figure
1c). We also identified several PTCH2 isoforms that
appear to be dynamically regulated at specific developmental time points. This is also consistent with findings in humans that identified PTCH2 isoforms lacking
exons 9 and 10 (PTCH2-Δ9-10)[18]. Taken together,
these data suggest that PTCH2 has divergent speciesspecific roles in development, while PTCH1 is likely to
maintain a highly conserved function in hedgehog signal transduction. Furthermore, it suggests that the
human PTCH2 Δ-22 isoform may have evolved to
compensate for a loss of PTCH1 in tissues in which
they are co-expressed.
DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 mRNA and protein were
present throughout gonadal development in both males
and females, from early development through to adult
stages. The presence of ligand and both receptor proteins throughout gonadal development is consistent with
findings in mouse testis, but not ovary [49] and suggests
a conserved role for hedgehog signalling in mammalian
gonad formation. These findings are also consistent with
the observed disruption to normal gonadal patterning

Page 9 of 12

and significant reduction in the expression of the downstream target gene GLI1, in the tammar when hedgehog
signalling is ablated in vitro [37].
In the testis, DHH could be seen within the pre-Sertoli cells of the aggregating cords. Once the testes differentiated, DHH staining was concentrated in the Sertoli
cells, especially at the basal lamina of the cord. This
protein distribution is similar to that reported in mouse
[49,24,49] and suggests it is critical for testicular patterning. However, there were some differences in PTCH
distribution from predicted mouse patterns. PTCH1
staining was similar to that of DHH, and was distributed
mainly within the seminiferous cords (containing germ
cells and Sertoli cells). This was in contrast to the interstitial expression seen for Ptch1 in the developing
mouse testis [24] but similar to the expression of Ptch2
[17]. Conversely, PTCH2 staining in the tammar was
more reminiscent of Ptch1 distribution in the mouse
testis [17] and was located throughout the gonad but
concentrated in the interstitium and Leydig cells. This
suggests there may have been a reversal in the roles of
these receptors in marsupial testicular development relative to the mouse. Since detailed localisation of the
PTCH receptors during gonad development in other
mammals and vertebrates is not available we cannot
determine which profile is more typical during
development.
There was discrete staining of DHH, PTCH1 and
PTCH2 proteins in the adult testis. DHH was concentrated in the differentiating germ cells, but restricted to
the post pachytene primary spermatocyte stage through
to the mature sperm. There was faint PTCH1 and
PTCH2 staining throughout the testis but the proteins
were concentrated in the Leydig cells and Sertoli cells
respectively. This is consistent with in situ results in the
adult mouse testis [17], suggesting a conserved role for
these genes in maintaining testicular function and spermatogenesis in all therian mammals.
Unlike in the mouse, in which Dhh is testis-specific in
early development [1], DHH was expressed in the developing tammar ovary throughout development. Activation of hedgehog signalling in the developing mouse
ovary leads to Leydig cell development [25]. However,
early ovarian development was not affected by the presence of DHH in the tammar, despite the presence of
similar mRNA and protein levels of both ligand and
receptors as in the developing testis. These findings
show that SRY is not needed for DHH activation in the
developing gonad. In the juvenile ovary, DHH was abundant in the oocytes consistent with the suggested role
for DHH in maintaining the germ line [1]. In the adult
ovary, DHH was broadly co-localized with PTCH1 and
2, in follicles and the corpus luteum suggesting it may
be important for normal folliculogenesis and

O’Hara et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/72

steroidogenesis, consistent with recent findings in the
mouse [26]. As in the testis, PTCH2 appeared to be the
predominant receptor throughout ovarian development
and in the adult.

Conclusions
These data support a conserved role for hedgehog signalling in gonadal development but show that in marsupials this pathway may be significant for early patterning
of the ovary as well as for the testis. These results, in
conjunction with our phylogenetic analysis of hedgehog
family members in all vertebrates, suggests that DHH is
unique to mammals and is a conserved member of the
gonadal development pathway.
