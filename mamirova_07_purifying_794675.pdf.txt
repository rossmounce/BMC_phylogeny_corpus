Abstract
Background: The effectiveness of elimination of slightly deleterious mutations depends mainly on
drift and recombination frequency. Here we analyze the influence of these two factors on the
strength of the purifying selection in mitochondrial and proteobacterial orthologous genes taking
into account the differences in the organism lifestyles.
Results: (I) We found that the probability of fixation of nonsynonymous substitutions (Kn/Ks) in
mitochondria is significantly lower compared to obligate intracellular bacteria and even marginally
significantly lower compared to free-living bacteria. The comparison of bacteria of different
lifestyles demonstrates more effective elimination of slightly deleterious mutations in (II) free-living
bacteria as compared to obligate intracellular species and in (III) obligate intracellular parasites as
compared to obligate intracellular symbionts. (IV) Finally, we observed that the level of the purifying
selection (i.e. 1-Kn/Ks) increases with the density of mobile elements in bacterial genomes.
Conclusion: This study shows that the comparison of patterns of molecular evolution of
orthologous genes between ecologically different groups of organisms allow to elucidate the
genetic consequences of their various lifestyles. Comparing the strength of the purifying selection
among proteobacteria with different lifestyles we obtained results, which are in concordance with
theoretical expectations: (II) low effective population size and level of recombination in obligate
intracellular proteobacteria lead to less effective elimination of mutations compared to free-living
relatives; (III) rare horizontal transmissions, i.e. effectively zero recombination level in symbiotic
obligate intracellular bacteria leads to less effective purifying selection than in parasitic obligate
intracellular bacteria; (IV) the increased frequency of recombination in bacterial genomes with high
mobile element density leads to a more effective elimination of slightly deleterious mutations. At
the same time, (I) more effective purifying selection in relatively small populations of
nonrecombining mitochondria as compared to large populations of recombining proteobacteria
was unexpected. We hypothesize that additional features such as the high number of proteinprotein interactions or female germ-cell atresia increase evolutionary constraints and maintain the
effective purifying selection in mitochondria, but more work is needed to definitely establish these
additional features.

Background
Theoretically, elimination of recent slightly deleterious
mutations must be more effective in species with high
population size [1,2], since low stochastic sampling variance decreases the power of random genetic drift. Also,
according to the theory, meiotic segregation and recombination allow for independent mixing of alleles, thus leading to more effective elimination of slightly deleterious
mutations [3-6] and halting of the Muller's ratchet [7,8].
Thus both the population size and the recombination
level determine the effectiveness of the purifying selection.
Although the influences of population size and recombination level on the effectiveness of the purifying selection
are interconnected and often mutually reinforcing, it is
possible to distinguish between them by comparing species with different population sizes, levels of recombination, or both. For example, the influence of the
population size on probability of fixation of slightly deleterious mutations was observed in comparison of primates and rodents [9-11], mammals, birds, and
drosophilids [12], island- versus continent-inhabiting
populations of same species [13], and large- versus smallbodied mammals[14]. The role of the recombination
level was demonstrated in asexual versus sexual Daphnia
[15]. The influence of both population size and recombination level, most likely, leads to the differences in the
molecular evolution patterns of endosymbiotic and freeliving bacteria [16-18] and to degeneration of the neo-Y
chromosome of Drosophila miranda [19].
The strength of the purifying selection, acting on different
genes, is mainly determined by structural or functional
constraints on the encoded protein. Since orthologous
proteins in closely related species most likely operate
under similar constraints, it is possible to investigate more
intimate relationships between the rates of molecular evolution, the population sizes of the analyzed species and
the level of recombination in their genomes. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of purifying selection in
various groups of proteobacteria and mammalian mitochondria.
The relative effectiveness of the purifying selection was
estimated as the rate of fixation of nonsynonymous substitutions (Kn/Ks) and radical amino acid substitutions
(Kr/Kc) in seven orthologous genes, encoding subunits of
a respiratory chain enzyme (NADH:ubiquinone-oxidoreductase or complex I) from bacterial and mitochondrial
genomes. These genes encode components of one multisubunit complex and represent a large fraction of all mitochondrial protein-coding genes. Orthologous genes,
encoding subunits of complex I, exist in all aerobic bacteria.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/17

Since the respiratory chain proteins are highly conserved,
we assume that the role of the positive selection is negligible, and thus these genes are appropriate for the analysis
of the purifying selection. Throughout the work we empirically corroborate this assumption.
Firstly, we compare mammalian mitochondria with bacteria. Since mitochondria are descendants of ancient endosymbiotic proteobacteria, it is interesting to compare the
purifying selection in orthologous mitochondrial and
proteobacterial genes with regards to the differences of
their ecology. Mitochondrial genes of vertebrates are
strictly maternally inherited, and thus asexual, and have
low population size [20]. Conversely, the bacteria (especially free-living) are characterized by nonzero recombination levels and high population sizes. Therefore, we can
expect that mitochondria are subject to less effective purifying selection than bacteria.
Secondly, we consider the purifying selection in various
groups of proteobacteria, taking into account their ecology. From the ecological point of view, the analyzed sample of bacterial species consists of two main groups:
obligate intracellular species (parasites or mutualists) and
free-living species able to exist outside of the host cell. The
free-living protebacteria are characterized by higher population size and higher recombination level, and thus one
may expect that they are subject to more effective purifying selection as compared to obligate intracellular species
[21,18].
Thirdly, we compare the purifying selection in obligate
intracellular symbionts (gamma-proteobacteria) and
obligate intracellular parasites (alpha-proteobacteria). It
is generally assumed that among obligate intracellular
bacteria, symbionts with strictly vertical inheritance (such
as obligate dietary endosymbiotic gamma-proteobacteria:
Buchnera and Blochmannia, that are required for the survival and reproduction of their insect host) possess lower
level of recombination as compared with parasites (such
as some alpha-proteobacteria: human pathogen Rickettsia
and reproductive parasite of arthropods Wolbachia) which
are able to switch from one host to another and thus contact and recombine with a novel gene pool [22]. Thus we
test the hypothesis that the transmission differences
among obligate intracellular species, determined by the
differences in their ecology, might influence the effectiveness of purifying selection through recombination frequency.
Fourthly, we analyze the correlation of the strength of purifying selection with the mobile elements density in bacterial genomes. We expect that the mobile element density
in bacteria should positively correlate with the recombination level, as it seems likely that these are two recipro-

reinforcing
factors.
The
inter-genomic
recombination level in bacteria is mainly determined by
the activity of the mobile elements which able to perform
conjugative transfer (conjugative plasmids, conjugative
elements) or transduction (prophages of temperate
phages) [23,24]. Number of other mobile elements, without ability to induce recombination, is evolutionary
maintained in concordance with the recombination level
in bacterial genomes [22] as it is in eukaryotes [25-33].
Thus we use the density of all mobile elements as a proxy
measure of the recombination activity in bacterial
genomes.
Unexpectedly, the level of purifying selection in mitochondria is significantly higher as compared with obligate
intracellular bacteria and even marginally significantly
higher as compared with free-living bacteria. This observation contradicts the widely accepted opinion about degradation of mitochondrial genomes and we discuss some
factors, which can increase selection constraints of mitochondrial genes. The comparison of bacteria demonstrates a more effective elimination of mutations in freeliving species as compared to obligate intracellular ones
with low effective population size and level of recombination. The purifying selection in parasitic obligate intracellular bacteria is more effective as compared to symbiotic
ones, possibly due to the higher recombination level in
the former. To elucidate the purifying effect of recombination, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of purifying
selection (1-Kn/Ks) positively correlates with the density of
mobile genes, i.e. with the frequency of recombination.

Results
(I) Evolutionary models
The phylogenetic tree, used in our analysis, is shown on
Fig. 1. To estimate the Kn/Ks values several models were
implemented for the mammalian and bacterial trees:
model 0 with a single Kn/Ks value for all branches of the
tree; model 2a with two Kn/Ks values estimated separately
for all external and all internal branches; and model 2b
with Kn/Ks values estimated separately for groups of external branches and a single Kn/Ks value for all internal
branches. In model 2b, bacterial external branches were
grouped by ecology or by taxonomy and ecology, mammalian external branches were grouped only by taxonomy.

Further the bacterial tree was divided into 3 monophyletic
sub-trees (alpha-, beta and gamma-proteobacteria), and
the mammalian tree was divided into glires and primates
sub-trees, and each sub-tree was analyzed separately. For
each sub-tree three models were implemented: models 0
and 2a defined as above, and model 2c with Kn/Ks estimated separately for each external branch and a single Kn/
Ks for all internal branches.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/17

Among any two compared nested models, the one with
more degrees of freedom had a significantly higher maximum likelihood (ML) value (i.e. 2∆lnL was larger with
statistical significance of at least a 5% for a χ2 distribution
with the number of the degrees of freedom dependent on
the model), thus providing a better fit to the analyzed
data. For the complete bacterial and mammalian trees: ML
(models 2b) > ML (model 2a) > ML (model 0); for subtrees: ML (models 2c) > ML (models 2a) > ML (model 0).
Since in model 2c the external branches of seven species
had no nonsynonymous substitutions (Kn = 0 and thus
Kn/Ks = 0), these species were not considered further.
Therefore, our final dataset for this model consisted of
110 species, including 36 alpha-proteobacteria (20 freeliving and 16 obligate intracellular parasites), 20 free-living beta-proteobacteria, 22 gamma-proteobacteria (16
free-living and 6 obligate intracellular symbionts), 13
glires and 19 primates.
All results obtained from models 2a and 2b (Table 1) were
consistent with the results of model 2c (Table 1, Fig. 2),
which we will discuss in detail below.
(II) Lack of positive selection
For all phylogenetic groups (all mammals, primates,
glires, all proteobacteria, α-, β-, γ-proteobacteria) model 7
(Kn/Ks values assumed to be beta-distributed on interval
(0, 1)) had significantly lower maximum likelihood (ML)
value than model 8 (one extra class of sites which may
have Kn/Ks values larger than one). However, the Kn/Ks values of the extra class sites were less then one in all mammals (0.298) and in all proteobacteria (0.384), as well as
in each group separately: 0.319 in primates, 0.223 in
glires, 0.513 in α-, 0.239 in β- and 0.462 in γ-proteobacteria. Thus we did not observe positive selection in the analyzed genes.
(III) Comparison of mitochondria with bacteria
The Kn/Ks values of mitochondrial genes are significantly
lower than those for all proteobacteria (P = 0.013), as well
as for all obligate proteobacteria (P < 0.001) and obligate
alpha-proteobacteria (P < 0.001), but only marginally significantly lower than those for all free-living proteobacteria (P = 0.068; Fig. 2). The primate Kn/Ks values are larger
than the glires ones (P < 0.001) and lower than Kn/Ks for
obligate alpha-proteobacteria (P = 0.007). Average values
of Kn and Ks estimated separately for each group are given
in Table in additional file 1.
(IV) Bacterial ecology
In the analysis of all proteobacteria, the obligate intracellular proteobacteria have higher Kn/Ks, as compared with
the free-living ones (P = 0.018; Fig. 2). For gamma-proteobacteria, the obligate intracellular ones have higher Kn/Ks

than the free-living ones (P = 0.032), while for alpha-proteobacteria the obligate intracellular have Kn/Ks similar to
that of free-living ones (P = 0.815; Fig. 2).
The Kn/Ks values of obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria (parasitic) are smaller than those of obligate intracellular gamma-proteobacteria (symbiotic) (Fig. 2) at a
marginally significant level (P = 0.054). The free-living
alpha-proteobacteria have higher Kn/Ks values as compared to free-living beta-proteobacteria (P = 0.003), and
similar to those of free-living gamma-proteobacteria (P =
0.319; Fig. 2). The Kn/Ks values for free-living gamma-proteobacteria are marginally higher than for beta-proteobacteria (P = 0.080; Fig. 2). Averages values of Kn and Ks

estimated separately for each group are given in additional file 1.
(V) Fixation of radical nonsynonymous substitutions (Kr/Kc)
Two of the four Kr/Kc ratios (charge-based Kr/Kc and volume-based Kr/Kc) demonstrate significantly higher values
in all bacteria compared with all mitochondria (P < 0.001
and P = 0.049, respectively). None of the Kr/Kc ratios demonstrate significant difference between free-living and
obligate intracellular bacteria.
(VI) Influence of branch lengths
Biased estimations of Kn/Ks values could be due to the saturation of synonymous sites on long branches [34], or to
the stochastic errors on short branches [35]. Since one

substitution per codon (i. e. branch length = 1) is the optimal divergence level for the estimation of Kn/Ks [36] we
repeated all analyses using species with the length of the
external branch from the interval (0.02, 2). Despite the
decreased sample size, the majority of all previously
obtained significant results still remained significant.
However, some of marginally significant results disappeared (see Table 2).
(VII) Density of mobile genes
The Kn/Ks values were negatively correlated with the
mobile elements density (hereafter MED: plasmid,
prophage and transposable element genes per one megabase of genome size; Kendall tau = -0.305, P = 0.0014, N
= 46) (Fig. 3). After exclusion of two species with no
mobile elements (Buchnera aphidicola APS and Buchnera
aphidicola Sg), we performed linear regression of Ln(MED)
on Ln(Kn/Ks) that corroborated the observed trend (Ln(Kn/
Ks) = -1.297 - 0.363×Ln(MED), r2 = 0.138, P = 0.013).
Additionally, we took into account nonindependence of
data using linear mixed-effects model and still observed
significant negative regression (Ln(Kn/Ks) = -0.670 0.619×Ln(MED), P = 0.0012).

The densities of plasmid, prophage and transposable element genes separately, also demonstrated significant rank
correlations with Kn/Ks (data not shown). The mobile elements density determined as the number of mobile genes
divided by the number of all genes in the genome also
demonstrated negative relationships with Kn/Ks (Kendall
rank correlation: tau = -0.329, P < 0.001, N = 46; ordinary
linear regression: Ln(Kn/Ks) = -3.891 - 0.396×Ln(MED), P
= 0.008, N = 44).

Discussion
Unexpectedly, mitochondrial genes, despite low effective
population sizes and no recombination, seem to eliminate slightly deleterious mutations more effectively than
orthologous genes in obligate intracellular and even freeliving bacteria which have huge population sizes and
nonzero recombination level.
Moreover, we demonstrated that this result cannot be
explained by the positive selection events in bacteria. The
Kn/Ks values were < 1 in all branch-specific models (2a, 2b,
2c), where the Kn/Ks values were estimated separately for
some branches or sub-trees (but were averaged across all
sites). Further, the Kn/Ks values were < 1 for all classes of
sites analyzed under site-specific models (7, 8) which
account for heterogeneous selective pressure on codons
(but are averaged across all branches of the phylogeny).
However as the adaptive evolution could affect only few
sites at several time points, both approaches of averaging
rates over sites or over time (over branches) could fail to
detect positive selection. Here we argue that the design of
our experiment, especially (I) analysis of conserved genes
on (II) external branches of the tree (see model 2c), allows
us to disregard the effect of possible positive selection.
Indeed, since we analyzed only external branches of the
tree, possible events of positive selection in the deepbranch phylogeny did not influence our results. On the
other hand it is unlikely that events of positive selection
on external branches (for example in bacterial species)
could be so numerous and so universal as to fully determine the observed trend.
Our result is unlikely to be biased due to the saturation of
synonymous substitutions on long branches or to stochastic errors on too short branches, the since analysis of

species with optimal branch length demonstrated similar
trends in majority of analyses. Besides, the Kr/Kc analysis
that is less sensitive to the saturation effect, demonstrated
similar trends.
Although we used the models that incorporate the possibility of different codon usage between the compared
groups of species (see Methods, par. (b)), it is still could
be possible, that the codon bias effect was not fully
accounted for. We can suppose that free-living bacteria
with high Ne possess higher Kn/Ks values (as compared to
mitochondria) due to elimination of some synonymous
substitutions through selection for more preferable
codons. Such selection would lead to underestimation of
Ks. To test this possibility we estimated the codon usage as
a

) , where f is the observed

probability distribution of m codons in an analyzed

genome (downloaded from the Codon Usage Database
[38]) and f' is the codon frequency under the assumption
of uniform synonymous codon usage. If the compared
distributions are similar, the relative entropy value should
be small. We obtained that the average relative entropy is
maximal for genomes of free-living bacteria (mean K =
257, N = 51), intermediate for genomes of obligate bacteria (mean K = 225, N = 19) and minimal for mitochondrial genes (mean K = 191, N = 33). However the
comparison of averages did not reveal any significant differences between the groups (the Mann-Whitney U-test)
and therefore we concluded that the codon bias should
not strongly influence our results.
As we look at only a single sequence from each species and
ignore polymorphism within the species, some polymorphic mutations may contribute to Kn/Ks estimated in our
work. For a synonymous substitutions (assuming their
neutrality), the expected polymorphism at mutation-drift
equilibrium is proportional to the effective population
size [2]. At the same time polymorphic slightly-deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions should segregate at a
Page 7 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:17

higher frequency in populations with low Ne as compared
to populations with high Ne [2]. Thus the both effects
should lead to underestimation of Kn/Ks values of bacterial
genes and overestimation of Kn/Ks values of mitochondrial
genes. Since bacterial Kn/Ks values, obtained in our work
are higher than mitochondrial ones, elimination of the
influence of polymorphic substitutions (i.e. increase in
bacterial Kn/Ks values and decrease in mitochondrial Kn/Ks
values) should only strengthen our results.
Thus positive selection, codon usage, stochastic errors or
saturation effects and influence of polymorphic substitutions can not provide alternative explanations to the conjecture that purifying selection is more efficient in
mammalian mitochondria compared to obligate bacterial
species and is at least the same compared to free-living
bacterial species.
Most likely, although the mitochondrial genes have the
same functions as their bacterial orthologs, they experience stronger evolutionary constraints. There may be several possible causes for that. Firstly, the increased number
of subunits in mammalian Complex I (45 [39] versus 14
[40]) can lead to a larger number of protein-protein interactions and consequently to a slower rate of the protein
evolution [41]. Secondly, it has been suggested that effective elimination of deleterious mutations from mtDNA
during the female germ-cell atresia is caused by the preferential apoptosis of egg cells with defect mtDNA [42-44].
Thirdly, additional factors such as the protein essentiality
or the expression level could increase evolutionary constraints on the mitochondrial genes [45,46]. Although it
seems likely that both protein essentiality as well as the
expression level of the mitochondrial genes should be
higher compared to their bacterial counterparts, we are
not aware of any experimental studies corroborating these
suggestions. Thus future experiments in this area may help
to identify the main cause of the increased evolutionary
stability of the mitochondrial protein-coding genes as
compared to their bacterial orthologs.
The widely accepted opinion about degradation of mitochondrial genome is based on theoretical [47] and empirical backgrounds [48-50]. Since mitochondria possess low
effective population size and no recombination, the
molecular evolution of mtDNA genes should be associated with a high rate of accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations. A number of studies compared
mitochondrial and nuclear genes and corroborated these
predictions [48-50]. However, because the genes in
nucleus and in mitochondria are not orthologous, this
approach is not fully adequate. Here, we compared
orthologous genes between mitochondria and various
proteobacteria, and observed no degradation of mitochondrial genes. Therefore, we suggest that some other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/17

above-mentioned factors have to influence on molecular
evolution of mtDNA and maintain highly-effective purifying selection in mitochondria despite their low effective
population size and absence of recombination.
Although this study does not refute completely the irreversible accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations in
nonrecombining mitochondrial genes, we argue that the
rate of the Muller ratchet in modern mammalian mitochondrial genes is at least slower than that in the ecological equivalents of mitochondria, obligate intracellular
endosymbionts.
The rate of the Muller ratchet depends on the number of
optimal individuals no with fewest mutations. If no is
small, there is a chance that all no individuals would die
without offspring and the ratchet will click round one
notch, i.e. the new optimal class of individuals will
became slightly worse since it will contain more mutations. Haigh demonstrated that under the additive fitness
effect of deleterious mutations, the number of individuals
−
in the optimal class is no = Ne U / s , where Ne is the effective

population size, U is the mutational rate per genome per
generation, and s is the selection coefficient of deleterious
mutations [51]. We argue that no in mitochondria is significantly higher than in obligate intracellular symbionts
due to higher s (because of the lower values of Kn/Ks in
mitochondria observed here) and lower or similar U
(because of the smaller mitochondrial genome size
(~16500 bp), but higher mutational rate per nucleotide
per generation). Thus, assuming all other parameters
equal (Ne and mutational rate per nucleotide per generation), the rate of the Muller ratchet is expected to be lower
in mitochondria.
Although two of four Kr/Kc values demonstrate more effective purifying selection in mammalian mitochondria as
compared to bacteria, it seems likely, that the Kr/Kc values
in general are less sensitive to the variations in the purifying selection between species.
Higher Kn/Ks values in obligate intracellular versus free-living bacteria are consistent with the theory as well as with
previous observations. This difference is most likely due
to low Ne and/or recombination level in the obligate intracellular bacteria.
We observed increased effectiveness of purifying selection
in obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacterial parasites as
compared to obligate intracellular gamma-proteobacterial symbionts. Since both groups pass through the bottle-

necks due to their obligate intracellular lifestyle,
differences in effective population sizes are unlikely to
cause the observed differences in effectiveness of selection. It has been suggested that, since obligate intracellular parasitic microbes change their hosts more frequently
than strictly vertically transmitted symbiotic microbes,
parasites enjoy recombination among different colonies
during horizontal transmissions [22]. Therefore, the most
likely explanation for the observed difference in the effectiveness of selection is the higher recombination level in
the obligate intracellular parasitic alpha-proteobacteria.
One recently described genome-level difference between
obligate intracellular parasites and endosymbionts is the
higher number of mobile elements in the former [22]. The
negative regression between the mobile element density
and the Kn/Ks values provides empirical evidence that high
level of recombination leads to more effective elimination
of slightly deleterious mutations. However, causal relationships of various types of mobile elements and purifying selection seem to be different. (I) The negative
regression of transposon density on Kn/Ks is most likely an
effect of recombination on both these values, since recombination increases both transposon density and effectiveness of purifying selection (i.e. 1-Kn/Ks). That would mean
that there may be no direct causal links between transposon density and purifying selection. (II) However, other
mobile elements, such as plasmids and temperate phages,
determine recombination events [23], and therefore their
high density causes the increase in the effectiveness of
purifying selection. Therefore, recombination induced by
mobile elements has an additional role, increasing effectiveness of the purifying selection in bacterial genomes,
which is beneficial for the host genome evolution [52,53].

Conclusion
This study shows that the comparison of patterns of
molecular evolution between ecologically different
groups elucidates the genetic consequences of various ecological lifestyles. Comparing the strength of the purifying
selection among proteobacteria with different lifestyles
we obtained results, which are in concordance with theoretical expectations: low effective population size and
level of recombination in obligate intracellular proteobacteria lead to less effective elimination of mutations compared to free-living relatives; rare horizontal transmission,
i.e. effectively zero recombination level in symbiotic obligate intracellular bacteria leads to less effective purifying
selection than in parasitic obligate intracellular bacteria;
the high frequency of recombination in bacterial genomes
with high mobile element density lead to a more effective
elimination of deleterious mutations. At the same time,
more effective purifying selection in relatively small populations of asexual mitochondria as compared to large
populations of sexual proteobacteria was unexpected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/17

since it contradicts the common theory. It seems that
additional features such as the high number of proteinprotein interactions or female germ-cell atresia maintain
the effective purifying selection in mitochondria.

Methods
(a) Data and preprocessing
Sequences of seven orthologous genes (mitochondrial:
ND1-6 and ND4L; bacterial: NuoA, NuoH, NuoJ, NuoK,
NuoL, NuoM, NuoN) of alpha-, beta-, gamma-proteobacteria and mitochondria of primates and glires (Rodentia
and Lagomorpha), were downloaded from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information database (NCBI)
[54] using blastp [55] with genes of E. coli K12 as a query.
Thus we obtained the data for 83 bacterial and 34 mammalian species. These genes were then translated into
amino acid sequences in silico. The obtained amino acid
sequences for each gene were aligned using E-INS-i
MAFFT model [56,57] and then reverse translated in silico
to obtain the nucleotide sequence alignments. The
aligned amino acid and corresponding nucleotide
sequences were concatenated into a single amino acid
(nucleotide) sequence for each species (3353 codons in
length). The concatenated amino acid sequences were
used to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees for each monophyletic group (alpha-, beta-, gamma-proteobacteria,
rodents and primates) using PHYML [58,59]. All bacterial
trees (for alpha-, beta- and gamma-proteobacteria separately) were rooted using the Homo sapiens mitochondrial
sequence as an outgroup. Similarly, the primates and
glires trees were rooted with Rickettsia rickettsia as an outgroup. The constructed mammalian and microbial trees
are shown in Figure 1. The homologous codon positions
that exist only in bacteria (mammals) and consequently
are absent in all mammals (respectively, all bacteria) were
removed from all sequences. The resulting sequence was
2126 codons in length. The concatenated nucleotide
sequences were used to analyze the pattern of nucleotide
substitutions and to reconstruct the nucleotide sequences
in the internal nodes of the trees.
(b) Ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide
substitutions (Kn/Ks)
The codon-based likelihood model suggested by Goldman and Yang [60] and implemented in the program
codeml of PAML package [61] provides a useful framework
for estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates (Kn/Ks). The transition/transversion rate
bias and the codon frequency bias are found to have significant effects on the estimation of synonymous and
nonsynonymous rates, and approximate methods do not
adequately account for these factors [62]. Thus, the
codon-based likelihood approach is preferable, because
this model can easily incorporate these parameters.
Because of that, the ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:17

substitutions to the rate of synonymous substitutions (Kn/
Ks) in this study was estimated using the program codeml
from the PAML package [61].
To take into account possible species differences in transition/transversion ratio, this parameter was set as free and
thus it was estimated from the sequence data in each
model. To take into account possible differences in the
codon usage bias, all codon frequencies also were set as
free parameters.
To estimate the Kn/Ks values several models were implemented for the mammalian and bacterial trees: model 0
with a single Kn/Ks value for all branches of the tree; model
2a with two Kn/Ks values estimated separately for all external and all internal branches; and model 2b with Kn/Ks
values estimated separately for groups of external
branches and a single Kn/Ks value for all internal branches.
In model 2b, bacterial external branches were grouped by
ecology (two groups: free-living and obligate intracellular
organisms) or by taxonomy and ecology (five groups:
free-living and obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria
(parasitic); free-living beta-proteobacteria; free-living and
obligate intracellular gamma-proteobacteria (symbiotic)). Since mammalian mitochondria are obligate intracellular symbionts with strictly vertical inheritance, in
model 2b the external branches of the mammalian tree
were grouped only by taxonomy (primates and glires).
Since an independent estimate of Kn/Ks for each external
branch of the whole tree would have taken too much
processor time, the bacterial tree was divided into 3
monophyletic sub-trees (alpha-, beta and gamma-proteobacteria), and the mammalian tree was divided into subtrees corresponding to glires and primates, and each subtree was analyzed separately. For each sub-tree three models were implemented: models 0 and 2a defined as above,
and model 2c with Kn/Ks estimated separately for each
external branch and a single Kn/Ks for all internal
branches. The resulting maximum likelihood (ML) values
of the models were compared using the likelihood-ratio
test [61].
(c) Positive selection
As only few codons in a gene may be under positive selection, while the rest of the gene is under purifying selection, the average Kn/Ks value is likely to be below one
despite the action of positive selection on the gene. All
above mentioned models (see the previous paragraph)
assume a single Kn/Ks ratio for all codons and thus represent a conservative test of positive selection. Adding
another class of codons with different Kn/Ks values may
better describe the distribution of Kn/Ks across codons and
reveal codons under positive selection [63,64]. For this
goal we used models 7 and 8 in the codeml program. A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/17

neutral model (7) with Kn/Ks values assumed to be betadistributed on interval (0, 1) was compared with a selection model (8) with one extra class of sites which may
have Kn/Ks values exceeding 1. Positive selection is inferred
if the estimate of the Kn/Ks value of this extra class indeed
is larger then one and if the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) is
significant. The LRT is performed by taking the negative of
twice the log-likelihood difference between the nested
models (7 and 8) and comparing this to the χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom.
(d) Ratio of radical to conservative substitutions (Kr/Kc)
Based on the algorithm by Hughes and coauthors [65],
which was modified by to take into account the transition/transversion rate bias [66], we computed the rates of
conservative (Kc) and radical (Kr) nonsynonymous substitutions for nucleotide sequences of modern species and
their most recent reconstructed ancestors (the ancestral
nucleotide sequences were reconstructed using the
method by Yang et al. [67] implemented in PAML under
model 2c). Since the Kc and Kr rates were small (< 0.3), the
Jukes-Cantor formula was used to correct for multiple
hits; that is, our Kr/Kc ratio is identical to the dR/dC ratio in
Zhang's notation [66].

The twenty amino acids were classified into groups in four
different ways according to their physicochemical properties. We relied largely on Zhang's classification, were the
amino acids differ by charge, polarity and both polarity
and volume [66]. Additionally, we used Taylor's classification, that classifies the amino acids by volume alone [68].
Amino acid substitutions within groups (i.e. when ancestral and modern amino acids in homologous sites belong
to the same group) were regarded as conserved, while
those between groups as radical.
(e) Mobile element genes
For the bacterial species with complete genome sequences
available, we determined the number of genes with
mobile DNA-related functions. For this we used the automated annotation of the Comprehensive Microbial
Resource of the Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR).
This annotation classifies genes into nineteen functionalrole categories, among which the mobile-DNA category
specifies plasmid, prophage and transposable-element
genes [69]. We used the number of genes from this category divided by the genome size in megabases as an estimate of the mobile element density in each species.
(f) Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were done in the R language (R
Development Core Team 2005) [70]. The Kn/Ks values
obtained from models 2a and 2b were compared using
the standard error (SE) values from PAML [61]. The Kn/Ks
distributions, obtained using model 2c for pairs of groups

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:17

with different ecology, were compared using the parametric t-test. The relationship of Kn/Ks and the mobile elements density was analyzed using three approaches: the
Kendall rank correlation which is robust to the nonlinearity of a relationship; the ordinal linear regression for loge
transformed data; and the regression analysis which takes
into account possible non-independence of data. Indeed,
since the number of mobile genes may possess some phylogenetic inertia and thus may not be independent among
species due to shared ancestry, we performed regression
analysis based on the linear mixed-effects model (the
function lme in the nlme package [71] of R language (R
Development Core Team 2005)), which explicitly takes
into account the hierarchical (nested) structure of comparative-species data [72]. Here, the data are nested into
the following two levels: species within families (Rhizobiales, Rickettsiales; Burkholderiales, Neisseriales; Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonadales) and within orders (alpha-, beta-,
and gamma-proteobacteria, correspondently).
