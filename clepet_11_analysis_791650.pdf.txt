Abstract
Background: Melon (Cucumis melo), an economically important vegetable crop, belongs to the Cucurbitaceae
family which includes several other important crops such as watermelon, cucumber, and pumpkin. It has served as
a model system for sex determination and vascular biology studies. However, genomic resources currently available
for melon are limited.
Result: We constructed eleven full-length enriched and four standard cDNA libraries from fruits, flowers, leaves,
roots, cotyledons, and calluses of four different melon genotypes, and generated 71,577 and 22,179 ESTs from fulllength enriched and standard cDNA libraries, respectively. These ESTs, together with ~35,000 ESTs available in
public domains, were assembled into 24,444 unigenes, which were extensively annotated by comparing their
sequences to different protein and functional domain databases, assigning them Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and
mapping them onto metabolic pathways. Comparative analysis of melon unigenes and other plant genomes
revealed that 75% to 85% of melon unigenes had homologs in other dicot plants, while approximately 70% had
homologs in monocot plants. The analysis also identified 6,972 gene families that were conserved across dicot and
monocot plants, and 181, 1,192, and 220 gene families specific to fleshy fruit-bearing plants, the Cucurbitaceae
family, and melon, respectively. Digital expression analysis identified a total of 175 tissue-specific genes, which
provides a valuable gene sequence resource for future genomics and functional studies. Furthermore, we identified
4,068 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 3,073 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the melon EST
collection. Finally, we obtained a total of 1,382 melon full-length transcripts through the analysis of full-length
enriched cDNA clones that were sequenced from both ends. Analysis of these full-length transcripts indicated that
sizes of melon 5’ and 3’ UTRs were similar to those of tomato, but longer than many other dicot plants. Codon
usages of melon full-length transcripts were largely similar to those of Arabidopsis coding sequences.
Conclusion: The collection of melon ESTs generated from full-length enriched and standard cDNA libraries is
expected to play significant roles in annotating the melon genome. The ESTs and associated analysis results will be
useful resources for gene discovery, functional analysis, marker-assisted breeding of melon and closely related
species, comparative genomic studies and for gaining insights into gene expression patterns.

Background
Melon (Cucumis melo) belongs to the Cucurbitaceae
family, which comprises 130 genera, including approximately 800 species that are mainly found in temperate,
subtropical and tropical regions worldwide [1,2]. Besides
melon, the Cucurbitaceae family also consists of many
other economically important species, including cucumber (C. sativus), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), squash
and pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.). Economically, melon is
among the most important fleshy fruits for fresh consumption. Indeed, melon is one of America’s, Europe’s
and the Middle East’s favorite fruits for dessert and
salad uses because of its unique flavor. The average per
capita consumption of melon in the U.S. has been
increasing consecutively each decade since the 1960s
with 2000-2006 average per capita consumption exceeding 12 pounds per year, an 8% rise from 1990-1999.
Besides its economic importance, melon is a very useful
experimental system for fundamental studies on a range
of topics including sex determination [3,4] and vascular
biology [5,6]. In addition, melon is also an intensively
studied species in terms of fruit ripening. It exhibits
extreme diversity for fruit traits and includes a wide
variety of cultivars producing fruits differing in many
traits including fruit shape, size, flesh color, sweetness,
aroma volatiles and fruit texture [7]. In addition, melon
fruits also have significant variations in ripening physiology and can be categorized as either climacteric or nonclimacteric types based on their ripening related respiration rate and ethylene evolution profiles [8]. Extensive
molecular and genetic studies have been carried out in
recent years in order to better understand the regulatory
mechanisms underlying important traits of melon with
the aim to improve melon fruit quality [9,10]
Melon is a diploid species (2n = 24) with an estimated
genome size of 450 Mb [11]. Genetic and genomic tools
available in melon include BAC libraries [12-14], a physical map [15], high-resolution genetic maps [16-19],
oligo-based microarrays [20], and a TILLING platform
for functional studies [21]. Currently the melon genome
is being sequenced under the Spanish Genomics Initiative (MELONOMICS) and the genome sequencing
should be completed in the near future. The sequence
of the closely related cucumber genome is available [22].
Complementary to whole genome sequences, expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) can directly represent the transcriptome or transcribed portions of the genome. They
have played significant roles in rapid gene discovery,
improving genome annotation, elucidating phylogenetic
relationships, facilitating breeding programs, and largescale expression analysis [23]. Currently in the NCBI
dbEST database, there are approximately 35,000 melon
ESTs, most of which were produced by González-Ibéas
et al. [24]. Approximately 8,000 ESTs are available for

Page 2 of 12

cucumber and watermelon, respectively, and a total of
approximately 1,000 EST from other cucurbit species.
Recently several reports have described the generation
of large-scale transcriptome sequences in cucurbit species using next generation sequencing technologies
(mainly the Roche-454 massive parallel pyrosequencing
technology), including melon [25], cucumber [26], and
Cucurbita pepo [27]. Although sequences generated
under these efforts are much shorter than traditional
Sanger ESTs, they represent a significant expansion of
cucurbit functional genomics resources.
We undertook to expand the melon transcript catalog
in the framework of the International Cucurbit Genome
Initiative, which was established in 2005, being one of
its major objectives to sequence approximately 100,000
ESTs from different melon genotypes and tissues [28].
We have constructed eleven full-length enriched cDNA
libraries and four standard cDNA libraries from various
melon tissues and cultivars and generated ~94,000
ESTs. These melon ESTs were analyzed to determine
the structure and putative functions of the corresponding transcripts. In addition, a number of new SSR and
SNP markers were identified in this EST collection. All
of this data has been integrated in the Cucurbit Genomics Database [28]. The ESTs generated from the present study, especially those from full-length enriched
cDNA libraries, will be a useful resource for the ongoing
melon whole genome sequencing project and for characterizing gene expression patterns and traits of interest
in melon and closely related species.

Results and discussion
Construction and sequencing of melon cDNA libraries

We constructed eleven full-length enriched and four
standard cDNA libraries from various melon tissues
(cotyledon, leaf, root, flower, fruit and callus) and cultivars (Dulce, PI161375, Piel de Sapo T-111, and Vedrantais) under normal conditions or upon infection with
melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV)-Ma5 (Table 1). The
flower, fruit and callus libraries were derived from two
climacteric (Dulce and Vedrantais) and two non-climacteric cultivars (Piel de sapo T-111 and PI161375). For
the flower and fruit, RNA pools were prepared from
various developmental stages (see Methods). The leaf,
root and cotyledon libraries were constructed from tissues infected with MNSV-Ma5. EST sequencing was
carried out independently on full-length enriched and
standard cDNA clones. For full-length enriched cDNA
libraries, 70,576 randomly-selected clones were
sequenced from the 5’ end, producing 69,196 (98%) useful reads after trimming vector, adaptor and low-quality
sequences and identifying and removing all possible
contaminated sequences. Assembly of these ESTs produced 6,469 clusters, among which 2,721 non-redundant

Melon EST sequence assembly and annotation

The 93,756 high quality melon ESTs generated under
this study, together with ~35,000 ESTs that are publicly
available [24,28,29] and 173 published mRNA sequences,
were assembled into a melon unigene build. The resulting assembly contained a total of 24,444 unigenes with
an average length of 776.7 bp, among which 11,653
were contigs with an average length of 972 bp and
12,791 were singletons with an average length of 598.7
bp (Table 2). The distribution of the number of ESTs in
each melon unigene is shown in Figure 1. A number of
highly abundant genes could be identified, with 162

unigenes represented by over 100 ESTs. The most abundant genes in the combined set of libraries (> 500 ESTs)
are listed in Table 3. Details of the melon EST assembly
are available at the Cucurbit Genomics Database [28].
Putative functions of melon unigenes were accessed by
comparing unigene sequences against the GenBank nonredundant (nr) protein database using the NCBI BLAST
program. The analysis showed that applying an e value
cutoff of 1e-5, a total of 19,359 (79.2%) melon unigenes
had hits in the nr database; while a total of 10,068
(41.2%) had hits when an e value cutoff of 1e-50 was
applied. This indicated that a very high percentage of
melon unigenes could be assigned a putative function.
Those having no hits in the database are likely to

clones were selected for 3’ end sequencing, yielding a
total of 2,381 (87.5%) high quality 3’ reads. For the four
standard callus libraries, 26,112 randomly-selected
clones were sequenced from the 5’ end, generating
22,179 (85%) high quality EST sequences. In total, we
have generated 93,756 high quality melon ESTs from
the constructed cDNA libraries (Table 1) and the average length of these ESTs is 629.6 bp. The EST
sequences have been deposited in GenBank and are also
available at the Cucurbit Genomics Database [28].

include non-coding RNAs, genes whose sequences do
not capture regions that contain conserved functional
domains, or protein coding genes that are novel in the
database and/or are melon-specific.
We then further compared melon unigenes to the
pfam protein domain database [30]. A total of 8,251
(33.8%) melon unigenes contained at least one pfam
domain and a total of 2,206 distinct pfam domains were
represented by these 8,251 melon unigenes. A similar
analysis on the well-annotated Arabidopsis proteins
(TAIR version 10) indicated that 3,272 pfam domains
could be represented by the Arabidopsis proteome. This
suggested that melon unigenes assembled in the present
study captured a large portion (at least 70%) of genes in
the melon genome. The most highly represented pfam
domains in the melon unigene database included
PF00069 (protein kinase; 144 unigenes), PF00076 (RNA
recognition motif; 138 unigenes), PF07714 (protein tyrosine kinase; 108 unigenes) and PF00097 (Zinc finger,
C3HC4 type; 103 unigenes).
Based on BLAST and pfam annotations, melon unigenes were further annotated with Gene Ontology (GO)
terms. A total of 15,350 (62.8%) unigenes were assigned
at least one GO term, among which 12,953 (53%) were
assigned at least one GO term in the biological process
category, 13,149 (53.8%) in the molecular function category and 12,420 (50.8%) in the cellular component category; while 9,927 (40.6%) melon unigenes were
annotated with GO terms from all the three categories.

Based on the GO annotations, putative gene functions
of melon unigenes were classified into high-level plant
specific GO slims [31] in each of the three categories.
The most abundant GO slims within the biological process, molecular function, and cellular component categories were cellular process, binding, and membrane,
respectively. In addition, a large number of melon unigenes appeared to be involved in plant responses to
abiotic (1,534) and biotic (844) stimuli, flower development (347), and secondary metabolite process (603), or
have transcription factor activities (519).
To gain insights into metabolism-related genes, we
further predicted biochemical pathways from the melon
unigenes and built a melon metabolic pathway database
using the Pathway Tools software [32]. A total of 302
metabolic pathways, as well as 30 superpathways, were
predicted from 3,543 enzyme-coding melon unigenes.
Most primary and secondary metabolic pathways were
well-represented by melon unigenes. The melon metabolic pathway database is freely available at the Cucurbit
Genomics Database [28].
Quality assessment of melon full-length enriched cDNAs

As shown in Table 1, a total of 71,577 ESTs derived
from full-length enriched cDNA clones were obtained in
the present study. These ESTs were assembled into
6,848 unigenes, among which 6,469 contained 5’
sequences of at least one full-length enriched cDNA
clone. By blasting sequences of the 6,469 unigenes
against GenBank nr, SwissProt/TrEMBL and Arabidopsis (TAIR version 10) protein databases, 5,552 (85.8%)
had significant hits (1e-05). Out of the 5,552 unigenes,
4,668 (84.1%) hit within five amino acids of the corresponding start sites. This indicated that a large portion
of clones from full-length enriched cDNA libraries
encoded full-length cDNAs.
We further generated 3’ end sequences of more than
2,300 clones (Table 1) and ultimately obtained 2,162
clones that were sequenced from both the 5’ and 3’
ends, among which 1,538 (72.5%) had 5’ and 3’
sequences that were assembled into the same unigene.
After removing redundancy, a total of 1,382 unigenes
that contained 5’ and 3’ sequences of at least one fulllength enriched cDNA clone were identified as melon
full-length transcripts. The majority of the identified
full-length transcripts contained overlapping 5’ and 3’
sequences from the same clone. The length distribution
of melon full-length transcripts is shown in Figure 2A.
The full-length transcripts ranged from 269 to 2,839 bp
and their average size was 1,230 bp, which was shorter
than previously reported for tomato (1,418 bp; [33]),
Arabidopsis (1,445 bp; [34]), and soybean (1,539 bp;
[35]), but longer than poplar (1,045 bp; [36]). We then
predicted the complete protein-coding sequences (CDS)

version 10). The statistics of the complete codon usages
of melon and Arabidopsis CDS are provided in Additional file 1. Overall codon usages of melon full-length
transcripts were largely similar to those of Arabidopsis
CDS. TGA, TAA, and TAG accounted for 44.9%, 37.2%,
and 17.9%, respectively, of melon stop codons; and they
accounted for 43.6%, 36%, and 20.4%, respectively, of
Arabidopsis stop codons (Additional file 1). In addition,
the GC content of melon coding sequences (45.61%)
was also very close to that of Arabidopsis (44.14%).
This, combined with the evidence described above, supported the high quality of melon full-length enriched
cDNA libraries.

for the 1,382 melon full-length transcripts and were able
to obtain CDS for 1,345 (97.3%) full-length transcripts.
The remaining 37 could be non-coding RNAs or transcripts that did not contain full CDS. Indeed, we found
that four transcripts (e.g., MU51348) did not contain a
stop site. The average length of the predicted CDS was
814 bp, which was shorter than that of tomato (938 bp;
[33]) and soybean (1,042 bp; [35]), but longer than
poplar (649 bp; [36]) and maize (799 bp; [37]). The size
distribution of melon CDS predicted from melon fulllength transcripts is illustrated in Figure 2A. Overall, the
average lengths of both melon full-length transcripts
and CDS were shorter than those reported for fulllength cDNAs of other plant species such as tomato
[33], Arabidopsis [34], and soybean [35]. This is not
unexpected since, as mentioned earlier, the majority of
melon full-length transcripts were identified based on
the overlap between 5’ and 3’ sequences of a single fulllength cDNA clone.
Based on the predicted CDS, we extracted 5’ and 3’
UTR sequences for each melon full-length transcript.
The average lengths of melon 5’ and 3’ UTRs were 167
bp and 254 bp, respectively, which were very close to
those of tomato (175 bp and 257 bp, respectively) and
longer than those of other plant species except rice [33].
The length distributions of melon 5’ and 3’ UTRs are
shown in Figure 2B, which were also largely similar to
those of tomato [33].
We further examined codon usages of the 1,345
melon full-length transcripts and compared the codon

To date, genome sequences of fourteen plant species
have been published. These plant species are Arabidopsis
[38], rice [39], poplar [40], grape [41], papaya [42], sorghum [43], cucumber [22], maize [44], soybean [45], Brachypodium [46], apple [47], castor bean [48], strawberry
[49], and cacao [50]. Protein sequences of genes predicted from the fourteen plant genomes were downloaded from corresponding websites (Additional file 2).
The 24,444 melon unigenes were then compared to these
protein sequence databases using the NCBI BLAST
(blastx) program. The complete comparative analysis
results are shown in Additional file 3. At e value < 1e-05,
approximately 85% of melon unigenes matched to proteins of cucumber, 75.4% to 79.2% of melon unigenes
matched proteins of other dicot plants (Arabidopsis,
poplar, apple, strawberry, cacao, grape, papaya, soybean,
and castor bean), while 70.6% to 72.5% of melon unigenes
matched proteins of monocot plants (rice, maize, sorghum, and Brachypodium). At a very stringent e value
cutoff (e value < 1e-100), approximately 30% of melon
unigenes matched cucumber proteins, 10.8% to 13.6%
matched proteins of other dicot plants, and 7.9% to 8.5%
matched proteins of monocot plants (Additional file 3).
These matches represented the highly conserved proteins
between melon and other plant species.
We constructed families of homologous proteins using
OrthoMCL [51] from protein sequences translated from
melon unigenes with ESTScan [52] and from a wide
phylogenetic range of representative plant organisms
including cucumber, Arabidopsis, rice, and grape. These
four organisms were chosen for the OrthoMCL analysis
because cucumber, as melon, belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family; grape, cucumber and some cultivars of
melon (e.g., Piel de sapo) are non-climacteric fleshy
fruit; and Arabidopsis and rice represent the model systems for dicot and monocot plants, respectively. As
shown in Figure 3, the analysis revealed 6,972 gene
families that were distributed among the five genomes,

might play roles in floral sex determination. Further studies, of course, are required to test this hypothesis.
Finally, we found that gene families specific to melon
mainly encompassed genes of unknown functions,
which is consistent with findings reported in other plant
species [50].
Tissue-specific melon gene expression

Figure 3 Venn diagram of ortholog group distribution in
melon, cucumber, Arabidopsis, grape, and rice. Numbers in
individual sections indicate the numbers of ortholog groups

which represented highly conserved gene families across
dicot and monocot plant kingdoms. We also identified
181 gene families that were specific to fleshy fruit-bearing plants (melon, cucumber, and grape), 1,192 families
specific to the Cucurbitaceae family (melon and cucumber), and 220 specific to melon. Functional analysis of
melon unigenes using GO terms revealed that the 6,972
melon gene families common to the other four plant
species were highly enriched with GO terms related to
cellular process, metabolic process, and biosynthetic
process (Additional file 4). This is consistent with a previous report [50]. Gene families specific to fleshy fruits
were significantly enriched with GO terms related to
hormone-mediated signaling pathway, response to biotic
stimulus, and regulation of metabolic processes (Additional file 4); all these biological processes have been
reported to be related to fleshy fruit development [53].
Gene families specific to the Cucurbitaceae family were
significantly enriched with GO terms related to
responses to various stimuli including responses to hormone and chemical stimuli (Additional file 4). Both
melon and cucumber have diverse floral sex types and
have long served as the primary model systems for sex
determination studies [54]. It has been reported that a
number of environment variables, such as light, temperature, water stress, and disease, as well as exogenous
treatment with hormones or other growth-regulating
substances, can directly influence floral sex determination [55,56]. Results obtained from the OrthoMCL analysis indicated that cucurbit specific gene families were
enriched with such stimulus-responsive genes which

Melon cDNA libraries generated in the present study, as
well as melon phloem EST libraries described in Omid
et al. [29], were neither normalized nor subtracted; thus
for these libraries, EST copy numbers can be used as an
approximate estimation of gene expression levels in the
corresponding tissues. The non-normalized and nonsubtracted melon cDNA libraries were prepared from
the following seven tissues: leaf, flower, fruit, phloem,
cotyledon, callus, and root. Statistical analysis identified
a total of 175 tissue-specific genes, among which 49, 39,
20, 25, 9, 15, and 18 were leaf, flower, fruit, phloem,
cotyledon, callus, and root-specific, respectively (Additional file 5). Heatmap representation of expression profiles of these tissue-specific genes is shown in Figure 4.

In most cases, genes expressed in specific tissues had
putative functions or were involved in pathways known
to be consistent with said tissue, e.g., leaf-specific genes
were highly enriched with genes involved in photosynthesis, phloem-specific genes were highly enriched with
genes encoding phloem filament proteins and phloem
lectins, and callus-specific genes were highly enriched
with genes involved in glycolysis, glucose metabolic process, hexose metabolic process, monosaccharide metabolic process, carbohydrate catabolic process, and
alcohol metabolic process (Additional file 5). It is worth
pointing out that some tissue-specific genes identified in
leaf, cotyledon and root might be due to the infection of
MNSV-Ma5. Indeed, functional analysis indicated that
leaf, cotyledon and root-specific genes were enriched
with GO terms such as response to stimulus and
defense response (Additional file 5).
It is worth noting that one of the fruit-specific genes
encoded 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase
(ACO), the final enzyme in the biosynthesis of ethylene
which is a plant hormone that regulates ripening of climacteric fruits [57]. Further detailed digital expression
analysis of this gene (MU46283) revealed that, as
expected, the gene was predominantly expressed in
fruits of melon cultivars Dulce and Vedrantais, both of
which are climacteric fruits; while none or very few
ACO transcripts were detected in fruits of the two nonclimacteric cultivars, PI161375 and Piel de Sapo T-111.
In addition, two genes (MU45060 and MU46015)
encoding acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) were highly and
exclusively expressed in fruit tissues. ACPs are essential
components of the fatty acid synthase complex and may
be required to maintain the production of fruit aroma
volatiles [58].
Interestingly, we found that genes involved in nucleosome and chromatin assembly (e.g., histones) and translation process (e.g., ribosomal proteins) were highly
enriched in the list of flower-specific genes (Additional
file 5). However, the exact role of these flower-specific
genes in melon flower development remains unclear and
further studies are required to clarify their functions in
flower development.
Marker discovery from melon EST sequences

Molecular markers are valuable resources for constructing high-density genetic maps, facilitating crop breeding
and identifying traits of interest. Early melon genetic
maps mainly used markers of Restriction Fragment
Length Polymorphism (RFLP), Amplified Fragment
Length Polymorphism (AFLP), and Random Amplified
Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). However these types of markers are not user friendly as they are either labor intensive to generate, harbor low rates of polymorphism in
melon [59], or are not readily transferred to other

genotypes and populations [60]. With the accumulation
of sequence information in melon during the past several
years, markers of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are becoming more
widely used in construction of melon genetic maps.
These markers have the following advantages: they are
hypervariable, multiallelic, codominant, locus-specific,
and evenly distributed throughout the genome [60], and
for markers derived from ESTs, they are directly linked
to expressed genes. The melon EST sequence information generated in this and other studies has served as a
major resource to generate new molecular markers
(mainly SSRs and SNPs). Several recently constructed
melon high-density genetic maps have already utilized
SSR and SNP markers derived from EST sequences generated in the present study [18,19].
We first screened melon unigenes for the presence of
di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide SSR motifs.
We retrieved 4,068 SSR motifs in 3,279 melon unigenes.
The major types of melon SSR motifs were tri-nucleotide, followed by di-nucleotide, tetra-nucleotide, pentanucleotide and hexa-nucleotide (Table 4). The most frequent SSR motif was AAG/CTT (1,269; 31.2%), followed
by AG/CT (1,134; 27.9%), AT/AT (364; 8.9%) and AAT/
ATT (120; 2.9%). CG/CG (3) was the least frequent SSR
motif identified in melon unigenes; possibly due to the
fact that CpG sequences are normally highly methylated,
which may further inhibit transcription [61]. These statistics are in agreement with previous reports of other
plant species [26,62]. Primer pairs were designed for
SSR motifs that had sufficient flanking sequences. The
complete list of SSR motifs and their corresponding primer pair information is provided in Additional file 6.
ESTs generated in this (Table 1) and other studies
[24,28,29] were from a diversity of melon cultivars. We
expected that SNPs would be enriched in the melon
EST dataset. Using very stringent criteria (see Methods
for details), we identified a total of 3,073 high-quality
SNPs in 1,331 unigenes, among which 1,972 were transitions, 976 were transversions, and 125 were single-base
insertions or deletions (Table 5). The most frequent
SNPs were C to T transitions (1,108; 36.1%), followed
by A to G transitions (864; 28.1%) (Table 5). The complete list of SNPs identified from melon ESTs is

provided in Additional file 7. Detailed information
including alignments of sequences containing each individual SNP is also available at the Cucurbit Genomics
Database [28]. Both SSRs and SNPs identified in the
present study represent an important resource for
genetic linkage mapping and marker-assisted breeding
in melon and closely related crops. As stated above,
they have already been used for these purposes.

Conclusion
We present the analysis of more than 71,000 and 22,000
melon ESTs from eleven full-length enriched and four
standard cDNA libraries, respectively. These libraries
were constructed from a range of tissues and melon
genotypes. Analysis of approximately 1,400 melon fulllength transcripts identified from this EST collection
indicated that melon transcripts had 5’ and 3’ UTRs of
similar size as those of tomato, while longer than those
of other dicot plants that we investigated. Comparative
analysis between melon ESTs and other plant genomes
allowed us to identify a number of highly conserved
gene families across the plant kingdom, as well as gene
families specific to fleshy-fruit bearing plants, to the
Cucurbitaceae family, and to melon. Digital expression
analysis identified genes showing significant tissue-specific expression and this resource remains to be further
exploited from the perspective of mining expression
data. Furthermore, SSR and SNP markers were also
identified in this melon EST collection and recent
research activities have begun to utilize these resources
to construct high-density genetic maps [18,19]. Overall
the availability of a large collection of melon ESTs from
full-length enriched and standard cDNA libraries will
not only facilitate the annotation of the melon genome,
which is currently being sequenced by the Spanish
Genomics Initiative, but also provide a valuable resource
for further functional and comparative genomics analysis, and for future improvement of breeding programs of
melon and closely related species.

Fruits of the four genotypes were collected at four developmental stages: 10, 20, 30 Days After Anthesis (DAA)
and at the mature stage. The mature stage was determined based on the formation of the abscission zone in
the two climacteric genotypes Dulce and Vedrantais (42
and 32 DAA, respectively) and based on highest Total
Soluble Solids (TSS) for the two non-climacteric fruits
PI161375 and Piel de sapo (42 and 45 DAA, respectively).
Hermaphrodite flowers were collected on secondary axes
at three developmental stages, C1, C3, and C5, which
correspond to initial, medium and late developmental
stages of flowers before anthesis, respectively (Caño-Delgado, unpublished). Specifically, C1 is the most initial
stage where the flowers are around 1 mm in the longitudinal axis, C3 is the stage where the future fruit shape is
already defined and first stamens are visible, and C5 is
the stage just before anthesis (1-2 cm). MNSV-Ma5
infected cotyledons, leaves and roots were produced from
melon cultivar Piel de Sapo T111 grown in growth chamber with a 16-hour, 25°C light and 8-hour, 18°C dark
regime. Specifically, nine-day old cotyledons were inoculated mechanically with fresh inoculums of MNSV-Ma5
and harvested after 4 days when necrotic lesions started
to appear with high incidence. Leaves and roots were
harvest 10 and 8-10 days after inoculation with MNSVMa5, respectively. Undifferentiated callus growth was
induced from cotyledon sections of the four cultivars
(Dulce, Piel de Sapo T111, PI161375, and Vedrantais).
Fifty seeds from each genotype were surfaced-sterilized
in 70% ethanol for 2 min, followed by 1% (w/v) NaOCl
with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 20 min, and rinsed three
times with sterile distilled water. Under a dissecting
microscope, seed coats were removed, a small incision
was done on the integuments, and embryos were
hydrated overnight in sterile distilled water. Embryo axis
was removed from the de-coated seeds. Depending on
the genotype, four to six transversal cotyledon sections
were dissected from each seed and cultured in Petri
dishes containing callus induction medium. Cultures
were incubated in the dark, at 28°C, and subcultured
every three weeks to fresh medium. Callus induction
medium was the MS (Murashige and Skoog), supplemented with 30g·L-1 sucrose, 8g·L-1 Bacto agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit), 5uM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
(2,4-D), and 1uM Kinetin (6-furfurylaminopurine). Five
months after initiation, 100 Petri dishes, 10-cm-wide,
with six to eight calli were produced from each genotype.
Total RNA preparation, cDNA library construction and
cDNA clone sequencing

Total RNAs from callus and MNSV-infected tissues
were extracted following the TRI-reagent (SIGMA)

Clepet et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:252
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/252

protocol, including two additional chloroform purification steps. Fruit total RNAs were prepared from slices
of the fruit that included both flesh and rind using the
protocol described by Portnoy et al. [25]. Melon flower
total RNA was extracted from hermaphrodite flowers
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and chlorophorm, following the protocol described by Cuperus et al. [63].
All RNA samples were submitted to one extra cleaning step on RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and purified on a
poly(A) track system (Promega). For cDNA library construction, fruit and flower RNAs were pooled, respectively, by mixing equal amount of RNA from each
developmental stage. Full-length enriched cDNA
libraries were constructed with the RNA Captor protocol, as described previously [64], and the four standard
callus cDNA libraries were constructed using the pBluescript II XR cDNA Library Construction Kit (Stratagene)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A subset
of clones was randomly selected from each cDNA
library. Clones from full-length enriched cDNA libraries
were sequenced at Genoscope (Evry, France) and those
from standard cDNA libraries at Arizona Genome
Institute.
EST sequence processing, assembly, and annotation

The raw chromatogram files were base-called with
phred [65]. Vector, adaptor and low-quality bases (a 20bp window with an average error rate > 0.01) were
trimmed from the raw EST sequences using LUCY [66].
The resulting sequences were then screened against the
NCBI UniVec database, E. coli genome, and melon ribosomal RNA sequences using SeqClean [67], to remove
possible contaminations of these sequences. Sequences
shorter than 100 bp were discarded. The resulting high
quality melon ESTs have been deposited in GenBank
dbEST database under accession numbers JG463773JG557528 and are also available at the Cucurbit Genomics Database [28].
Melon ESTs were assembled into unigenes using iAssembler [68] with minimum overlap of 40 bp and minimum percent identity of 97. Melon unigene sequences
were compared against GenBank non-redundant (nr)
and UniProt [69] protein databases using the NCBI
BLAST program with a cutoff e value of 1e-5. The unigene sequences were translated into proteins using
ESTScan [52] and the translated proteins were then
compared to pfam domain database [30] using
HMMER3 [70]. Gene Ontology (GO) terms and plantspecific GO slim ontology [31] were assigned to each
unigene based on terms annotated to its corresponding
homologues in the UniProt database and domains in
pfam database. Melon biochemical pathways were predicted from the unigenes using the Pathway Tools program [32] and a melon biochemical pathway database

Page 9 of 12

was constructed and is available at the Cucurbit Genomics Database [28].
Full-length transcript identification and analysis

Unigenes containing both 5’ and 3’ sequences of at least
one clone from the full-length enriched cDNA libraries
were identified as full-length transcripts. The complete
CDS were identified using the getorf application in the
EMBOSS package [71]. CDS were also identified based
on the ESTScan translations and CDS identified from
the two approaches were integrated. 5’ and 3’ UTRs
were then extracted from each candidate full-length
transcript. Codon usages were calculated with the cusp
program in the EMBOSS package [71].
Comparative genomics analysis

Melon unigenes were compared to protein databases of
fourteen plant species whose genomes have been fully
sequenced (Additional file 2) using the NCBI BLAST
program with an e value cutoff of 1e-5. Furthermore,
ortholog groups of protein sequences for melon (ESTScan translated proteins), Arabidopsis, rice, cucumber,
and grape were identified using the orthoMCL program,
which performs an all-against-all BLAST comparison of
protein sequences with subsequent Tribe-Markov clustering [51. Venn diagram showing the distribution of
shared gene families among melon, Arabidopsis, rice,
cucumber and grape was created with Venn Diagrams
[72]. Enriched GO terms of melon unigenes in each list
of specific ortholog groups were identified using GO::
TermFinder [73] with corrected p values (False Discovery Rate (FDR); [74]) less than 0.05.
Identification of tissue-specific genes

All normalized or subtracted cDNA libraries (e.g., libraries
described in Gonzalez-Ibeas et al [24]) were excluded in
the digital expression analysis. Pair-wise comparisons
between fruit, flower, callus, leaf, root, cotyledon (Table 1),
and phloem [29] were performed with the R statistic
described in Stekel et al. [75] to identify differentially
expressed genes. Only genes with a total of at least five
EST members in the two compared tissues were included
in the analysis. Raw p values from the R statistic were corrected for multiple testing using the FDR [74]. Tissue-specific genes were identified if the genes were significantly
up-regulated (ratio > 2 and FDR < 0.05) in the tissue when
compared to all other tissues. Enriched GO terms in each
list of tissue-specific genes were identified using GO::
TermFinder [73], requiring p values adjusted for multiple
testing (FDR) to be less than 0.05.
Identification of SSRs and SNPs

SSRs in melon unigene sequences were identified using
the MISA program [76]. The minimum repeat number

Clepet et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:252
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/252

was six for dinucleotide and five for tri-, tetra-, pentaand hexa-nucleotide. Primer pairs flanking each SSR loci
were designed using the Primer3 program [77].
SNPs in the cDNA sequences between different melon
cultivars were identified with PolyBayes [78], which
takes into account both the depth of the coverage and
quality of the bases. To further eliminate errors introduced by PCR amplification during the cDNA synthesis
step and to distinguish true SNPs from allele differences,
we filtered PolyBayes results and only kept SNPs meeting both of the following two criteria: 1) at least 2X coverage at the potential SNP site for each cultivar; 2) no
same bases at the potential SNP site between the two
compared cultivars. The detailed information of all
melon SSRs and SNPs is freely available at the Cucurbit
Genomics Database [28].
