divergence between two invasive whitefly
cryptic species

Abstract
Background: Invasive species are valuable model systems for examining the evolutionary processes and molecular
mechanisms associated with their specific characteristics by comparison with closely related species. Over the past
20 years, two species of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci species complex, Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) and
Mediterranean (MED), have both spread from their origin Middle East/Mediterranean to many countries despite their
apparent differences in many life history parameters. Previously, we have sequenced the transcriptome of MED. In
this study, we sequenced the transcriptome of MEAM1 and took a comparative genomic approach to investigate the
transcriptome evolution and the genetic factors underlying the differences between MEAM1 and MED.
Results: Using Illumina sequencing technology, we generated 17 million sequencing reads for MEAM1. These
reads were assembled into 57,741 unique sequences and 15,922 sequences were annotated with an E-value above
10-5. Compared with the MED transcriptome, we identified 3,585 pairs of high quality orthologous genes and
inferred their sequence divergences. The average differences in coding, 5’ untranslated and 3’ untranslated region
were 0.83%, 1.66% and 1.43%, respectively. The level of sequence divergence provides additional support to the
proposition that MEAM1 and MED are two species. Based on the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous
substitutions, we identified 24 sequences that have evolved in response to positive selection. Many of those genes
are predicted to be involved in metabolism and insecticide resistance which might contribute to the divergence of
the two whitefly species.
Conclusions: Our data present a comprehensive sequence comparison between the two invasive whitefly species.
This study will provide a road map for future investigations on the molecular mechanisms underlying their
biological differences.

Background
Genomic resources and information about invasive species are valuable for evolutionary studies to determine
how and why phenotypes specific to non-indigenous species have been formed [1,2]. Moreover, they will aid
ongoing efforts to understand and control the ecological,
genetic and economic impacts of the invasive species.
However, genomic or expressed sequence tag (EST)
resources required to identify candidate genes or genomic changes associated with invasiveness are not yet
developed for most invasive species [3]. In fact, only few

invasive species have had significant genomic resources
developed for this purpose [4]. Over the past several
years, the next generation sequencing technology has
significantly accelerated the speed of gene discovery and,
is expected to boost genomics studies [5-7]. Because this
technology eliminates the need for cloning ESTs, which
introduces bias, and has greatly increased the quantity of
data that can be generated in a short time at a reduced
cost compared with traditional Sanger sequencing of
cDNA libraries [8]. This technology has been proved to
be a valuable addition to evolutionary and ecological
research for non-model organisms [9]. However, so far,
few studies have explored the potential of using next generation sequencing to investigate the source of genetic

variation underlying the evolution of an invasive species
[3,10].
The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera:
Aleyrodidae) has a global distribution with substantial
genetic diversity and has been recorded over 600 species
of plants [11-13]. Recent phylogenetic analysis combined
with a determination of a consistent pattern of reproductive isolation among many genetic groups within
B. tabaci indicates that the whitefly is a complex containing at least 28 cryptic species (herein species) [12,14-17].
Two species of the complex, Middle East-Asia Minor 1
(herein MEAM1) and Mediterranean (herein MED), as
designated by Dinsdale et al. [15] and commonly referred
to as the B and Q ‘biotype’ respectively in the past
20 years, have risen to international prominence since
the 1980s due to their global invasion [18-22]. The invasive ability and damage potential of MEAM1 has earned
it a place as one of the world’s top 100 invasive species
http://www.issg.org[23]. Some effort has been made to
understand the multiple factors that contribute to the
incursion of the two species into new regions and habitats. For example, asymmetric mating interactions
between MEAM1 and its indigenous competitors have
been shown to play a major role in the invasion of
MEAM1 into China and Australia [19]. While both
MEAM1 and MED are known for their invasiveness,
their biological characteristics are rather different. For
example, the invasion of MED seems more closely related
to its strong resistance to major classes of insecticides
[23-28]. Several studies have revealed that the greater
abundance of MED relative to MEAM1 in Israel and
southern Spain were associated with the higher levels of
resistance to pyriproxyfen and neonicotinoids in MED
[25,26]. Both species have been speculated to have a wide
range of host plants, although up to date the knowledge
of their actual host range is very limited partly due to the
confusion of their species status in the past [12,29,30].
The experimental evidence available also shows clearly
that the two species differ substantially in host range
[31,32], interactions with begomoviruses [33,34] and
mating behavior [35,36]. Because of those differences
between MEAM1 and MED, competitive interactions
between them where they co-occur are common and
have significant impacts on their distribution. In Zhejiang
Province of China, MEAM1 probably arrived in the late
1990s and has been rapidly displacing the indigenous
species of the B. tabaci complex [19,37]. In 2005,
MED appeared and gradually replaced MEAM1 and has
become the only or predominant B. tabaci in some locations [37].
Natural selection under different ecological and agricultural environments is likely to have driven the evolution
and divergence between MEAM1 and MED whiteflies and
resulted in their reproductive isolation and biological

differences. However, the molecular factors responsible for
the differences between MEAM1 and MED species are
almost unknown. Furthermore, we have no information
about how natural selection may have affected the transcriptomes of these invasive whiteflies since their divergence from a common ancestor. So far, studies about
sequences divergence in this whitefly species complex only
focused on a few genes, such as cytochrome oxidase 1,
nuclear ribosomal intergenic transcribed spacer 1, and 16S
ribosomal DNA, which are important molecules to differentiate genetic groups of B. tabaci [12,15]. The sequence
divergence of acetylcholinesterase among different whitefly
populations of MEAM1 has also been documented
because of its role in insecticide resistance [38]. However,
the investigations of individual genes can not provide an
accurate description of genome wide DNA sequence
divergence. A more robust picture of genomics divergence
between MEAM1 and MED may be attained by examining
large numbers of genes that have been selected without
prior interest in their biological functions or evolutionary
histories [39]. The transcriptome represents a sample of
the spatiotemporally expressed genome and can be used
as an entry into the genome divergence study [40].
Previously, we have sequenced the transcriptome of
MED using Illumina sequencing technology and demonstrated that this technology allows de novo transcriptome
assembly in a species lacking genome information [41].
In this study, we generated over one billion bases of
high-quality DNA sequence for MEAM1 with Illumina
technology. Based on these DNA sequences, we identified
57,741 distinct sequences including hundreds of insecticide target and metabolism genes. To reveal the genetic
differences between MEAM1 and MED, we compared
the sequence variations between them and identified a
number of orthologous genes that show signs of diversifying natural selection. The assembled, annotated transcriptome sequences of MEAM1 provide an invaluable
resource for the identification of whitefly genes involved
in biological invasion, insecticide resistance and host
adaptation. The identification of divergent sequences
between MED and MEAM1 opens the door for future
investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying
the biological variations between them.

To obtain an overview of the MEAM1 whitefly transcriptome, a cDNA sample was prepared from a mixture
of RNA from egg & nymph, pupa, female adult and
male adult at equal ratio, and sequenced using the Illumina sequencing platform. We obtained a total of 17
million of 75 bp reads, which have been deposited in
the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) under the accession

using SOAPdenovo software and resulted in 123,055
contigs (Table 1) [42]. The contigs were assembled into
104,722 scaffolds using paired-end joining and gap-filling (mean size: 326 bp) (Table 1). The 104,722 scaffolds
were further clustered into 57,741 distinct sequences
including 135 clusters and 57,606 singletons (Table 1).
In this article, a cluster means a sequence composed of
several scaffolds and the singleton means a scaffold that
matches no other scaffolds. Next, we analyzed the length
distribution of the 57,741 distinct sequences. As shown
in Figure 1, although nearly 70% of the sequences
(40,254) are between 100 to 500 bp, we identified 4,480
sequences longer than 1,000 bp.

searched using BLASTx against the non-redundant (nr)
NCBI nucleotide database using a cut-off E-value of 1 ×
10-5. A total of 15,922 genes returned an above cut-off
BLAST result representing about 27.6% of all distinct

sequences (See additional file 1). The E-value distribution
of the top hits in the nr database showed that 34.2% of the
mapped sequences have strong homology (smaller than
1.0E-40), whereas 65.8% of the homolog sequences ranged
between 1.0E-5 to 1.0E-40 (Figure 2A). Likewise, the similarity distribution showed that 39% of the sequences have
a similarity higher than 60%, while 61% of the hits have a
similarity ranging from 18% to 60% (Figure 2B). Similar to
the results of MED transcriptome [41], the highest percentage of MEAM1 sequences were matched to the pea aphid
(Acyrthosiphon pisum) (17.7%), followed by the body louse
(Pediculus humanus corporis) (14.3%), red flour beetle
(Tribolium castaneum) (12.4%) and honey bee (Apis mellifera) (10.9%) (Figure 2C). Gene Ontology (GO) assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted
MEAM1 whitefly genes. Based on sequence homology,
4,711 sequences can be categorized into 52 functional
groups under three main divisions (See additional file 2,
red bars). Next, we compared the GO of MEAM1 and
MED whitefly transcriptomes [41] and found that the distributions of gene functions from these two species are
extremely similar (See additional file 2). This expected
result indicates that there is no bias in the construction
of the libraries from the MEAM1 and MED whiteflies.
Compared to the MED transcriptome which has 7,330
sequences with GO annotation [41], the number of
sequences with GO annotation in MEAM1 (4,771) is lower.
This is probably due to the differences in the amount of
sequencing data generated from the two samples (MEAM1:
1G; MED: 3G). For both species, in the three main divisions
(cellular component, molecular function and biological
process) of the GO classification, ‘Cell part’, ‘Binding’ and
‘Cellular process’, terms are dominant respectively. For
both species, we also noticed a high-percentage of genes
from categories of ‘Cell’, ‘Catalytic’ and ‘Metabolic process’
(See additional file 2).

To compare the sequence divergence of the two species,
we analyzed the possible orthologous genes between
their transcriptomes using bidirectional best hit which
has been widely used to identify orthologous genes
[9,40,43,44]. By this way, we identified 24,945 pairs of
putative orthologs with an average length of 397 bp and
98.22% identity (range from 80.2% to 100%). To remove
potential paralogs, these putative orthologous genes were
further screened against the Swissprot database. Only
pairs of sequences that mapped unambiguously to the
same protein in Swissprot database with an E-value < 1 ×
10-5 were selected as orthologous genes. Among these
sequence pairs, 3,997 pairs of sequences could be
mapped unambiguously to the same protein, suggesting
strongly that they are orthologous genes (Figure 3). The

untranslated region (UTR) of each sequence pair was
identified based on the predicted coding region. Among
the 3,997 pairs of orthologs, 188 pairs contain 5’UTR and
286 pairs contain 3’UTR. After removing the UTRs, we
obtained the coding sequences (CDS) of all the orthologs.
The CDS sequences containing unexpected stop codon
and shorter than 150 bp were further filtered, resulting in
3,585 pairs of orthologous CDS sequences (Figure 3 and
additional file 3). The average length of the 3,585 orthologous genes is 482.7 bp with an average similarity of
99.17%. The average GC content of orthologous CDS is
42.84% (Table 2), a value slightly higher than that of pea
aphid genome (mean = 38.8) and Apis mellifera genome
(mean = 38.6) [45,46]. However, the GC contents in the
UTR regions of MEAM1 are 37.12% (5’UTR) and 35.19%
(3’UTR) which is slightly lower than that of the pea aphid
and honeybee genomes. Considering the large percentage
of noncoding sequences in the whitefly genome [47], the
overall GC content of the whitefly should be comparable
to that of the pea aphid and honeybee. The 3,585 translated genes were annotated and classified using Kyoto

Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database
(See additional file 3). Given the differences between
MEAM1 and MED, we propose that these pathways
represent a transcriptome involved in core cellular and
physiological functions common to the two whitefly
species.
The sequence divergence between MEAM1 and MED

For the 5’UTR, the GC content is 37.12%, and 6.3% of
the compared nucleotides occur in CpG contexts (Table
2). Differences between 5’UTRs of MED and MEAM1
orthologous genes occur at 1.66% of the positions. Interestingly, CpG sites in the 5’UTR differ at 5.29% of positions, whereas non-CpG sites differ at 1.46%. Thus,
within 5’UTRs, differences occur approximately 3.6
times more often at CpG sites than at non-CpG sites.
For the 3’UTR, the GC content is 35.19% and 3.74% of
the nucleotides are in a CpG context. The overall difference of 3’UTR between MED and MEAM1 is 1.43%.
CpG and non-CpG sites differ at 7.32% and 1.1%,
respectively. Hence, in the 3’UTR, CpG sites contain

6.65 times more differences than non-CpG sites. These
results suggest that a substantial proportion of the DNA
sequence divergence between the two species is caused
by changes at CpG sites. To understand the mechanism
of evolution, we compared the ratio of transition (ts)
and transversion (tv) [48]. Overall, the transitional differences are 1.41 times more frequent than transversional
differences in 5’UTRs (Table 2). Interestingly, the transition-transversion ratio is higher in the CpG positions (2.32)
than the non-CpG positions (1.28). This is consistent with
the suggestion that the predominant type of mutations in
the CpG sites is cytosine deamination, which results in
transitional differences [49]. As in 5’UTR, transitional substitutions at 3’UTR are more common than transversions
(ts/tv = 1.56) and transitions are even more frequent than
transversions at CpG sites (ts/tv = 3.18, Table 2) compared

with non-CpG sites (1.36). When comparing divergences of
3’UTR and 5’UTR, the overall and non-CpG sites divergence of 3’UTR is slightly lower than that at 5’UTR. However, for the CpG sites, the divergence at 3’UTR is higher
than that of 5’UTR (7.32% versus 5.29%). Therefore, the
mutation rates are likely to differ for CpG sites in different
regions of genes. It reflects differences in mutational pressures between these regions because of differential methylation rate, which is also consistent with the finding that the
transition/transversion rate is higher in the 3’UTRs than in
the 5’UTRs (Table 2).
Among the 3,585 orthologous gene pairs, the overall
divergence in coding regions is 0.83%. In non-CpG sites,
the divergence is slightly lower (0.61%); whereas in the
CpG sites, the divergence (3.99%) is 6.5 times as high as
that of non-CpG sites. Apart from CpG context, the

nucleotides in coding regions can further be classified as
non-degenerative (nd) sites (any nucleotide substitutions
produce amino acid change) and four fold degenerate
(4d) sites (no changes cause amino acid replacement).
From a total of 1,730 kb of coding region sequences,
1,025 kb are nd sites, whereas 238 kb are 4d sites (Table
2). At nd sites the overall divergence is 0.2%, whereas
the overall divergence at 4d sites (2.68%) is 13.4 times
that at the nd sites. The results indicate that the nd
sites evolve under extensive functional constraints
because any nucleotide substitutions at nd sites will produce amino acid changes. At nd sites, the GC content is
43.62% and the CpG content 5.72%. At nd sites, the
non-CpG sites divergence between MED and MEAM1
is 0.18% and the divergence at CpG sites is 0.58% which
is 3 times the non-CpG sites divergence. At the 4d sites,
the GC content is 37.2%, whereas the CpG content is
much higher (11.03%). At CpG sites, the divergence is
12.16% which is 7 times that at the non-CpG sites
(1.73%). These results demonstrate that the higher percentage of divergence at the 4d sites is proportional to
both the content of CpG sites and the rate of mutation.

To identify genes undergoing purifying and positive selections, we estimated rates of nonsynonymous (Ka) and
synonymous (Ks) substitutions between MEAM1 and
MED ortholog pairs. Among the 3,585 pairs of CDS, both
a Ka and a Ks rate could be calculated for 1,161 orthologs
(See additional file 4). For the rest of the gene pairs, we
could calculate either only Ka or Ks. The 1,161 sequence
pairs had mean values of Ka, Ks, and Ka/Ks of 0.0058,
0.0385, and 0.225. The Ka/Ks ratio has been widely used
to measure the intensity and mode of selection under
which a CDS is evolving. Ka/Ks > 1 is interpreted as a sign
of positive selections and Ka/Ks < 1 is a signature of purifying selections [50-52]. Of the 1,161 sequence pairs with
a Ka and a Ks rate, 24 orthologous gene pairs have a
Ka/Ks value larger than 1 and 86 genes have a Ka/Ks value
between 0.5 and 1 (Table 3 and Figure 4). Among the
sequences with Ka/Ks values > 1, a couple of genes are
involved in sugar and amino acids metabolic processes
suggesting those processes are under strongly positive
selection and are critical to the specialization of the whiteflies (Table 3). For example, the alpha-trehalose-phosphate
synthase (TPS), which is a key enzyme for the synthesis of
trehalose, has the highest Ka/Ks value (2.90). The amino
acid sequences comparison of the TPS revealed that, in
the MEMA1 species, a highly conserved glutamic acid
residue in the catalytic domain is replaced by an alanine
(Figure 5A) [53]. Except the sequences with high Ka/Ks,
many sequences had Ka/Ks values equal to or only slightly
greater than zero, suggesting that these genes have evolved
under high selective constraint (See additional file 4) [39].
Analysis of sequences with weak amino-acid similarity

To determine the transcriptome-wide levels of coding
sequence divergence, we calculated the sequence homology
of orthologous genes between MED and MEAM1. The
3,585 sequence pairs had a mean homology of 99.17% and
ranged from 92% to 100% (See additional file 3). The large
variation in sequence homology suggests that estimated
values of species divergence based on few genes may produce misleading results. Among these sequence pairs, 604
show 100% homology, suggesting these genes are well conserved between MED and MEAM1 (See additional file 3).
To reveal the proteins responsible for the differences
between the two species, we analyzed the sequence pairs
with weak amino-acid similarity. Interestingly, many of the
divergent genes are related to sugar, protein and amino
acid metabolism, such as aminopeptidase (92%), oligopeptide transporter (93.6%), aspartate aminotransferase
(93.8%) and galactose oxidase (95.8%) (See additional file 3).
The sequence divergences of these genes may cause functional differences in corresponding enzymes and result in
the biological variations between MED and MEAM1.
Furthermore, we noticed that a couple of proteins involved

pesticides appeared to be enhanced by cytochrome P450
[54]. Therefore, we compared the protein sequence of the
MED cytochrome P450 4C1 with that of MEAM1 (Figure
5B). Sequence alignment showed that the MED whitefly
cytochrome P450 4C1 is clearly different with the MEAM1
homolog. The relevance of these mutations in pesticide
resistance requires further investigation.

Discussion
For the B. tabaci complex, 28 cryptic species have been
delineated based on a number of phylogenetic analysis
and reproductive isolation studies; however, the evolutionary origin and basal taxa have not been ascertained.
Furthermore, the genetic factors associated with the evolution of invasive whitefly species are almost unknown.
This is partially due to the fact that few molecules are
available for inferring the evolutionary history and
genetic divergence of B. tabaci. So far, only the mitochondrial 16S DNA, cytochrome oxidase 1 and the nuclear
ribosomal intergenic spacer have been explored [12,15].
In this study, we have identified nearly 3,585 ortholog
gene pairs and determined the average sequence divergence between MEAM1 and MED to be 0.83% for the
CDS. This is much higher than the reported mean 0.45%
divergence at the coding region between human and

chimpanzee [55,56]. The gene divergence at the non-coding regions is even more obvious for 5’UTR (1.66%) and
3’UTR (1.43%) regions - nearly 1.5 times the divergence
between the 5’UTR (1.12%) and 3’UTR (0.86%) regions of
human and chimpanzee [56]. In addition, it is likely that
our analyses might have underestimated the level of
divergence between the two species. The orthologous
genes were identified with very high stringency (reciprocal best match and the same unique Swissprot hit) which
may have filtered out genes that have diversified in
response to selection and no longer exhibit similarity significant enough to be identified with BLAST [39]. This
strictness could have biased our data set toward more
conserved sequences. Altogether, these results indicate
that despite high-sequence identity in their CDS, the
MEAM1 and MED species have diverged substantially
between their transcriptomes. The level of sequence
divergence provides additional support to the proposition
that MEAM1 and MED are two species [15], in addition
to the evidence of reproductive isolation [35,36].
Previous studies have shown that MEAM1 and MED
differ in many life history parameters, such as mating
behavior, insecticide resistance and host plant utilization
[25,31,35,57]. Interestingly, we have identified a number
of divergent sequences which might contribute to these
biological differences between the two species. For example, MEAM1 and MED have different capacity to utilize
various host plants and weeds [32,58]. In this study, we
found that a number of genes involved in sugar and
amino acid utilization are highly divergent, such as

alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase, oligopeptide transporter, aminopeptidase and galactose oxidase. Further
functional characterization and comparison of these
enzymes in MEAM1 and MED might reveal the molecular mechanisms underneath those differences. We also
noticed that a couple of genes involved in insecticide
resistance, such as cytochrome P450 4C1 and glutathione
S-transferase, are clearly divergent between MEAM1 and
MED. These differences might be responsible for the
higher insecticide resistance of the MED species [25,54].
Nonetheless, the functions of those proteins in driving
the evolution and divergence of the MEAM1 and MED
species need to be further characterized.
The higher level of similarity observed in the CDS could
be attributable to the presence of purifying natural selection on the CDS of the genes. To estimate the extent to
which selection affects protein-coding DNA sequences, we
calculated the number of nucleotide substitutions that
change amino acids (Ka) and the number of substitutions
that do not (Ks). Among the 3,585 pairs of transcript compared, the average Ka/Ks ratio is 0.225. Surprisingly, this
ratio is remarkably similar to the average Ka/Ks ratio of
rat and mouse coding region (0.19) and Ka/Ks ratio of
human and chimpanzee (0.22) [56,59]. This is unexpected
because the effective population size is much larger in
whiteflies than in rodents and humans, which should have
resulted in more effective selection against deleterious
variants [60]. The ratio of Ka/Ks is a good indicator of
selective pressure and has been used to identify proteincoding genes under positive and purifying selection [61].

Wang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:458
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/458

Of the 1,161 orthologous pairs for which Ka and Ks could
be calculated, 24 have Ka/Ks > 1, suggesting that those
sequences might play important roles in the speciation
and adaptive evolution of the whitefly. While the genes we
have earmarked through this study are suitable subjects
for future research, more rigorous statistical tests of positive selection, using multiple sequence samples, are
required to confirm current results as well as to detect
specific codons undergoing adaptive change.
Major advances in transcriptomics have become feasible
in non-model organisms as a result of technology developments in next-generation sequencing. This study dramatically increased the number of genes from the MEAM1
whitefly (previously referred to as B biotype) [62]. Together
with the MED whitefly transcriptome [41], we can provide
an initial estimate of the number of transcribed genes in
the whitefly. By reciprocal best match, we have identified
24,945 homologous sequences between MEAM1 and
MED. Those 24,945 sequences were separately sequenced
and assembled during the Illumina sequencing suggesting
strongly that they are valid transcripts. As many distinct
sequences represent nonoverlapping portions of the same
transcript, this number is probably an overestimation of the
actual genes and can be considered as an upper-bound of
our library. For gene annotation, 12,931 sequences of the
MEAM1 transcriptome have significant Swissprot hits with
a minimum E-value of 1 × 10-5 and 20,824 MED sequences
have a significant hit [41]. As many of these Swissprot hits
are likely to be duplicates (e.g., two sequences blasting to
different parts of the same gene), we analyzed the unique
gene names identified during these Blast searches. Among
these Swissprot hits, 8,872 unique gene names were identified during the Blast search of the MEAM1 transcriptome
and 11,219 unique gene names were identified for the
MED transcriptome (data not shown). Considering both
sets of results, the lower-bound of genes for the whitefly
transcriptome should be more than 8,872. In fact, many
assembled sequences lack matches to public database
because they are either too short to permit appropriate
alignments or represent highly divergent genes. For example, about 20% of the genes in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon
pisum), the closest relative of B. tabaci with a sequenced
genome, showed no homology to other metazoan genes
[46]. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that the minimum number of genes in the whitefly will exceed 11,000.
Although a precise estimation of transcriptome coverage is
unachievable without the full genome information, our collection of unique transcripts represents a substantial percentage of the genes from the genome of B. tabaci.

Conclusions
In this study, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to
use Illumina sequencing to rapidly characterize multiple

Page 9 of 12

transcriptomes and compare their differences in an invasive non-model species. The level of sequence divergence is consistent with the previous proposition that
MEAM1 and MED whiteflies are two species. Furthermore, we have identified hundreds of sequences showing
high sequence divergence and found 24 genes under
strong positive selection. The divergent sequences identified in this study will be an invaluable resource for
studies of whitefly speciation, invasion, insecticide resistance and host plant utilization. To our knowledge, this
is the first attempt using Illumina sequencing to study
the transcriptome divergence of invasive species. We
anticipate that this methodology holds great potential
for the identification of genetic variation underlying the
evolution of other invasive species.

Methods
Insect rearing and sample preparation

Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum cv. Zhe-Mian 1793) was cultivated to the 7-8 true-leaf stage for experiments. A pair of
virgin adults of MEAM1 (mitochondrial cytochrome
oxidase 1 gene GenBank accession no: GQ332577) were
released onto cotton plant to oviposit and develop for five
generations in a climate chamber at 27 ± 1°C, a photoperiod of 14 h light:10 h darkness and 70 ± 10% relative
humidity [63]. The purity of the culture was monitored
using the random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction technique and the sequence of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene, which has been
used widely to differentiate B. tabaci genetic groups [28].
Since the quantity of eggs was extremely low, a mixture of
eggs and first to third instar nymphs were collected as one
sample. The pupae were collected as another sample. For
adults, individuals were collected from the culture using a
glass tube (5 × 0.5 cm) and the sex was determined under
a stereo microscope. Then the male and female adults
were pooled separately into plastic tubes using an aspirator. Finally, these samples were frozen at -80°C until use.
RNA isolation and library preparation for transcriptome
analysis

Total RNA was isolated separately from the four samples
(egg & nymph, pupa, female adult, and male adult) using
SV total RNA isolation system (Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol [64]. RNA integrity was confirmed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)
with a minimum RNA integrated number value of 8.
mRNA was purified from 8 μg of total RNA (a mixture of
RNA from egg & nymph, pupa, female adult and male
adult at equal ratio) using oligo (dT) magnetic beads.
The cDNA library for transcriptome sequencing was prepared using Illumina’s kit following manufacturer’s
recommendations as described before [41].

Analysis of Illumina sequencing results

The cDNA library was sequenced at The Beijing Genome
Institute (Shenzhen, China) on the Illumina sequencing
platform (GAII). The size of the library is approximately
200 bp and both ends of the library are sequenced with a
length of 75 bp. Image deconvolution and quality value
calculations were performed using the Illumina GA pipeline 1.5. The raw reads were cleaned by removing adaptor
sequences, empty reads and low quality sequences (reads
with unknown sequences ‘N’). The reads obtained were
randomly clipped into 21 bp K-mers for assembly using
de Bruijn graph and SOAPdenovo software [42]. After
sequence assembly, the resultant contigs were joined into
scaffolds using the read mate pairs. To obtain distinct
gene sequences, the scaffolds were clustered using TGI
Clustering tools with the default parameters [65]. Distinct
sequences were used for Blastx search and annotation
against the NCBI nr protein database using an E-value
cut-off of 10 -5 . Functional annotation of GO terms
http://www.geneontology.org was analyzed by Blast2go
software. The data sets of Illumina sequencing are available at the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) with the
accession number: SRX022878. The assembled sequences
have been deposited in the NCBI’s Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database under the accession number of HP643344 to HP701084 and can be searched
using the GeneID listed in Additional file 1.
Identification of orthologous genes and prediction of the
coding and untranslated regions

We used the bidirectional best hit method in MegaBLAST
to identify genes that are putatively orthologs between
MEAM1 and MED. Pairs of sequences that were each
other’s best hit and longer than 200 bp were retained as
putative orthologs. Bidirectional best hit has been widely
used to identify the orthologous genes between closely
related species [9,40,44] and this approach has been found
to outperform more complex orthology identification
algorithms [43]. As de novo transcriptome assemblies generally struggle to differentiate members of gene families,
using bidirectional best hit to identify orthologs may not
completely exclude the orthologous paralogs. Therefore,
these putative orthologous genes were further screened
against the Swissprot database to remove potential paralogs. If two sequences are orthologous paralogs, during the
Blast search, they probably will hit to different genes in the
Swissprot database. Only pairs of sequences that mapped
unambiguously to the same protein in Swissprot database
with an E-value < 1 × 10-5 were selected as orthologous
genes. Alignments containing any frameshifts and indels
were filtered. CDS of the orthologous genes were determined by BLASTx against all known proteins in Swissprot
database using a threshold of 1 × 10-5. CDS with unexpected stop codon in the Blast hit region and shorter than

Page 10 of 12

150 bp were removed. Start codon positions were determined by examination of the in-frame ATG codon present
30 bp upstream or downstream of the beginning of the
aligned reference protein. The 5’UTR of each pair of
orthologs was identified based on the results of CDS and
start codon prediction. The stop codon positions were
determined by examination of in-frame TAA, TAG and
TGA motifs present within 30 bp of the stop codon of the
reference protein. Similarly, the 3’UTR of orthologs was
defined based on the CDS and stop codon prediction. To
prevent false positive results, only UTR pairs with an Evalue < 1 × 10-30 were selected for further analyses.
Sequence divergence analyses and estimation of
substitution rates

For each pair of orthologs, 5’UTR, coding and 3’UTR
regions were extracted respectively. For the CDS region,
pair-wise alignments were generated for all the orthologous gene pairs based on protein sequences and backtranslated to DNA sequences for subsequent analysis. The
CDS and UTR regions were aligned separately to each
other with a MegaBlast algorithm and checked manually
for errors. Alignments are available upon request. Because
MEAM1 and MED are closely related, multiple substitutions at the same site are highly unlikely. Therefore, the
sequence divergence was calculated by dividing the number of substitutions by the number of base pairs compared.
The divergence was determined for the contexts of nondegenerate (nd), fourfold degenerate (4d), CpG and nonCpG [56]. The ratio of transitions over transversions
(ts/tv) was determined for the 5’UTR, CDS and 3’UTR as
well. Substitution rates were estimated separately for
synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous sites (Ka) using an
approximate method implemented in the KaKs Calculator
Version 1.2 [66]. Pair-wise approximate analyses were performed using the YN method [61]. Because the sequencing
errors are distributed among synonymous and nonsynonymous sites at equal frequencies, they are not expected to
influence the results of analyses [39].
