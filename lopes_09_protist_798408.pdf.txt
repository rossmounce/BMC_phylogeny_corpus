Abstract
Background: For three decades the Mutator system was thought to be exclusive of plants, until
the first homolog representatives were characterized in fungi and in early-diverging amoebas earlier
in this decade.
Results: Here, we describe and characterize four families of Mutator-like elements in a new
eukaryotic group, the Parabasalids. These Trichomonas vaginalis Mutator- like elements, or TvMULEs,
are active in T. vaginalis and patchily distributed among 12 trichomonad species and isolates. Despite
their relatively distinctive amino acid composition, the inclusion of the repeats TvMULE1, TvMULE2,
TvMULE3 and TvMULE4 into the Mutator superfamily is justified by sequence, structural and
phylogenetic analyses. In addition, we identified three new TvMULE-related sequences in the
genome sequence of Candida albicans. While TvMULE1 is a member of the MuDR clade,
predominantly from plants, the other three TvMULEs, together with the C. albicans elements,
represent a new and quite distinct Mutator lineage, which we named TvCaMULEs. The finding of
TvMULE1 sequence inserted into other putative repeat suggests the occurrence a novel TE family
not yet described.
Conclusion: These findings expand the taxonomic distribution and the range of functional motif
of MULEs among eukaryotes. The characterization of the dynamics of TvMULEs and other
transposons in this organism is of particular interest because it is atypical for an asexual species to
have such an extreme level of TE activity; this genetic landscape makes an interesting case study for
causes and consequences of such activity. Finally, the extreme repetitiveness of the T. vaginalis
genome and the remarkable degree of sequence identity within its repeat families highlights this
species as an ideal system to characterize new transposable elements.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous components
of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and, as a consequence of their prevalence, mobility and concomitant
mutagenicity [e.g., [1,2]], they can induce profound
changes in genome organization and have an important
evolutionary impact on expression and function of host
genes [3-6]. TEs can lead to genome expansion and contraction [7-9], transduction and amplification of host
gene fragments [10,11] and increase the variability of protein repertories [12-20]. Given this enormous potential as
a source of genetic novelty, considerable effort has been
devoted by the scientific community to the characterization of new TEs in the plethora of new genomes and transcriptomes available in public databases, particularly in
organisms for which the knowledge about TEs is scarce.
While some families of TEs are found across most taxa surveyed, others appear to have a restricted host distribution;
the Mutator system in plants was an example of the latter.
This notion was recently dispelled by the identification
and extensive characterization of Mutator homologs in the
first non-plant species [21-24]. Moreover, consensus
sequences of new representatives of this TE family
obtained from a broad range of species have been
reported in Repbase Reports within the past few years:
CEMUDR1-2 from Caenoharbidtis elegans [25,26]; MuDR12_TP in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana [27,28];
MuDr1-2_NV in the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis [29,30]; MuDR1x-2x_SM in the planarian Schmidtea
mediterranea [31,32] and MuDr1x-2x_AP in the insect
Acyrthosiphon pisum [33,34].
The Mutator (Mu) system was originally identified by Robertson [35] in maize as a highly mutagenic transposon system. This system is composed of diverse families that
share ~220 bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and create
a 9 bp host sequence duplication at the insertion site
[reviewed by [36]]. These elements can be either autonomous (MuDR) or nonautonomous (Mu). Transposition of
Mu elements is dependent of the autonomous MuDR elements. The MuDR element in maize is 4.9 kb long and
contains two open reading frames (ORFs): mudrA and
mudrB. The mudrA gene product, the MURA protein of
823 amino acids, probably a transposase, contains a catalytic domain with a D34E motif (aspartic and glutamic
acids separated by 34 residues) and its expression is sufficient for the somatic excision of the TE [37,38]. The transposase encoded by mudrA shares weak but significant
similarity to those encoded by the IS256 group of prokaryotic insertion sequences [21]. Deletions on mudrA disable
the Mutator transpositional activity [37]. The MURB protein is encoded by mudrB; while this protein's function
remains undetermined, it seems to be necessary for the
activity of the Mu system in maize [37,38]. Mutator-like
elements (MULEs) have been identified in a wide range of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/330

plant species, such as Arabidopsis [39-41], Oryza [e.g.,
[42,43]], Saccharum [44,45] and different grasses [46].
Interestingly, MULEs lack the mudrB gene [36]. In maize,
thale cress and rice MULEs are heterogeneous in sequence,
size and structure. In particular, some elements either
carry small imperfect TIRs or completely lack them
[39,40].
Recently, non-plant species have been reported to harbor
MULEs. Chalvet et al. [22] provided the first evidence for
the presence of an active MULE in the fungus Fusarium
oxysporum, the transposon Hop. It is 3,299 bp long, has
TIRs of 99 bp and 9 bp target site duplication (TSD),
encodes a putative transposase of 836 amino acids and
has no apparent sequence specificity at the insertion site.
The presence of related elements in other filamentous
fungi like Magnaporthe grisae, Neurospora crassa and
Aspergillus fumigatus has also been reported [22]. Neuvéglise et al. [23] identified a new type of DNA transposons, Mutyl, in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica with 7,413
bp, imperfect TIRs of 22 bp, 9 to 10 bp TSD, and two ORFs
which potentially encode proteins of 459 and 1,178
amino acids. Whereas the first ORF shows no significant
homology to described proteins, the second one shows
similarity to a wide variety of MULE-encoded transposases. More recently, Pritham et al. [24] characterized a
canonical copy of the Mutator-like element in a protist
genome, Entamoeba invadens. This element, named
EMULE-Ei1, is 2,882 bp long and displays structural features typical of plant MULEs, such as TIRs of 187 bp and
a 9 bp flanking TSD. Moreover, it contains a single ORF
that putatively encodes a 456-aa protein that shows significant similarity to the Hop transposase from F. oxysporum.
In that study, homologous elements were observed in
three additional Entamoeba genomes, namely E. dispar, E.
hystolitica and E. moshkovskii [24].
Trichomonas vaginalis, an asexual flagellated protist [47], is
an extracellular obligate human parasite of the urogenital
tract [48] and a member of a deep-branching eukaryotic
lineage, the Parabasalids [49]. Its genome sequence and
annotation, published in 2007 by Carlton and collaborators, revealed a putative set of ~60,000, mostly intronless,
protein-coding genes, endowing T. vaginalis with one of
the largest gene sets among eukaryotes [9]. Interestingly,
this genome was shown to be highly repetitive, with
repeats and TEs comprising about two-thirds of its ~160
Mb-long sequence. Until now, only DNA transposons
have been completely characterized in this species, including Mariner [50], Polintons [51], and Mavericks [52].
Among the original repeats identified in the genome of T.
vaginalis were included four repeat consensus sequences
with a Mutator-like profile: R210 with 2,127 bp, R130a
with 1,129 bp, R119 with 2,954 bp, R165 with 2,410 bp
[9]. In this report, we characterize these four T. vaginalis

Mutator-like elements (TvMULEs), which we renamed as
TvMULE1 (based on the R210 sequence), TvMULE2
(based on the R130a sequence, here revised regarding to
sequence and structure), TvMULE3 (based on R119) and
TvMULE4 (based on R165). We confirm the inclusion of
the four repeats into the Mutator superfamily based on
sequence, structural and phylogenetic analyses. While
TvMULE1 is a member of the MuDR clade predominantly
from plants, the other three TvMULEs represent a new and
quite distinct Mutator lineage, expanding the taxonomic
distribution and the range of functional motif of MULEs
among eukaryotes.

Results
Characterization of TvMULEs: new T. vaginalis
transposons
The sequence and structure of four Mutator-like consensus
sequences [9] were analyzed in detail in the present study.
The manual inspection of a combination of sequence similarity searches and consensus sequence building techniques (described in Methods) and the presence of
putative, imperfect, terminal inverted repeats (TIRs)
resulted in the definition four new Mutator-like transposable element families represented by the consensus
sequence of which we termed TvMULE1, TvMULE3 and
TvMULE4 (Figure 1) and TvMULE2 represented by the

canonical copy contained in the contig 95978 (position
24930–27469).
All insertions of the four families were identified in the
17,290 contigs that make up the current genome assembly
of T. vaginalis by BLASTN. A total of 61, 514, 666 and
1,204 matches revealed strong similarity to TvMULE1,
TvMULE2, TvMULE3 and TvMULE4, respectively (identity
>80% and E ≤ e-20). All matches were extracted by BLAST
coordinates and all ORFs starting at the Met residue were
predicted, excepting TvMULE2, in which the predicted
ORF was only derived of the canonical copy. The four
TvMULEs contain a single intronless gene. The more frequent ORF of TvMULE1, which putatively encodes a 629aa protein (Figure 1), displayed highest similarity (43%)
to a Mutator transposase (Tpase) from A. thaliana (Table
1). On the other hand, the other three TvMULEs showed
similarity to three potential Mutator Tpases from the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans: the first of these (GenBank
gi # 68466572) is 568-aa residues long and is very similar
to the second C. albicans protein (GenBank gi #
68466277), which is 832-aa long; the third C. albicans
protein (GenBank gi # 68474652), is 668-aa long.
TvMULE2 matched the first C. albicans protein, and
TvMULE3 and TvMULE4 showed significant similarity to
the third protein with 40 and 43% similarity, respectively
(Table 1). While TvMULE1 have relatively small non-coding regions, these extend to several hundred base pairs in
TvMULE2, TvMULE3 and TvMULE4.
Within each of the four TvMULE families all copies were
found to be nearly identical in sequence (identity >99%).
This result confirms the low polymorphism obtained
from average pairwise differences between copies (π)
observed by Carlton et al. [9]. There, the π value was estimated as 0.9% for TvMULE1, 0.7% for TvMULE2, 1.1%
for both TvMULE3 and TvMULE4. Within each family, the
sequences of the 5' and 3' TIRs are nearly identical. In

addition, an alignment of these putative TIRs across
TvMULE families shows three positions in the 5' end and
six in the 3' end are nearly perfectly conserved (not
shown). The presence of polymorphism in the terminal
ends within each repeat family could indicate that they do
not act as the transposase recognition site, given that the
internal regions of different copies are more highly conserved. Alternatively, it is possible that the binding is not
specific across the entire TIR, or that some of the mutations that have accumulated since transposition actually
inactivates the respective copies.
TvMULE1 shares recognized MULE structural motifs.
Firstly, it has a well-conserved D34E integrase signature in
the putative active site, and three residues of the transposase core conserved across a wide range of MULEs [36]
are also present (Figure 2A). This conserved region corresponds to the ~130-aa domain identified by Eisen et al.
[21] containing a 25-aa signature sequence [D-x(3)-G(LIVMF)-x-(6)-(STAV)-(LIVMFFYW)-(PT)-x-(STAV)-x-(2)(QR)-x-C-x(2)-H]. Secondly, a transposase zinc finger
domain at the C-terminal region was identified, which has
a nearly perfect CX2CX4HX4/6C-motif (Figure 1 and Figure
2B). This motif is found in the nucleocapsid protein of retroviruses, in several known nucleic acid binding proteins,
in the copia-like retrotransposons from tobacco [53], and
in Ty elements in yeast [54]. It has been proposed that this
motif plays a role in a transposase-transposon interaction
that takes place during transposition and/or regulation
[40].
The other three TvMULEs (TvMULE2, TvMULE3 and
TvMULE4) show amino acid residue contents that differ
markedly from that of TvMULE1 and from those of
known plant MULEs. However, these elements exhibit significant similarity to three C. albicans elements (Table 1).
This observation is readily apparent from the quite new
and distinct content of residues contained in two con-

wide range of Mutator-like elements, previously described by Lisch [36].
served motifs shared by these six elements (Figure 3). The
inclusion of this extended group in the Mutator superfamily is supported by a variety of structural analyses.
First, the three C. albicans proteins show significant similarity to MULEs such as Hop from F. oxysporum (GenBank
gi # 30421204) and a Cucumis melo MULE (GenBank gi #
46398239); in addition, one of them (GenBank gi #
68466572) contains a conserved Mutator-like transposase
domain corresponding to pfam00872 (COG3328 and
CDD85084), a hallmark of Tpases of the Mutator family.
Secondly, BLASTP generated significant pairwise alignments for all comparisons between these TvMULEs (2e37<E-value<2e-13), as well as between them and the C.

albicans sequences (Table 1). Thirdly, a careful characterization of motifs across 41 Mutator elements, as well as in
these T. vaginalis and C. albicans repeats, revealed that the
latter encode an extended motif of 36 residues (motif 1)
identical to the 25-aa signature sequence of the MULE
transposase core previously mentioned [see Additional
file 1]. The high degree of sequence conservation of this
motif [see Additional file 1] in quite distinct branches of
the Mutator lineage suggests that it plays a role that is
essential to the fitness of the elements.
Finally, none of the four TvMULEs encodes a mudrB product, similarly to what is observed in the A. thaliana and O.

are widespread in grasses, mudrB sequences seem to be
restricted to Zea [46].
Preferential insertion sites of TvMULEs
Among all matches with similarity to TvMULE1 (61) and
TvMULE2 (514), only 8% (five sequences) and 0.5%
(three sequences), respectively, correspond to complete
copies. Probably due to their longer size, which can not be
spanned by two PCR reads, matches to TvMULE3 (666)
and to TvMULE4 (1,204) represent only internal or end
regions of the elements; these observations reflect the fragmentary nature of the current assembly, which in turn is
caused by the highly repetitive character of the T. vaginalis
genome. Thus, the analyses of putative insertion site preferences were performed with all insertions that contain at
least one end region.

The sequences flanking TvMULE1 insertions exhibit a
high degree of nucleotide conservation in the first 25 positions (data not shown). Genomic fragments of 2,000 or
5,000-nt adjacent to the element were extracted to evaluate the extent of such similarity in the regions flanking of
different copies. The extent of the similarity between
regions flanking TvMULE1 insertions depends on the copies of this family being compared. Interestingly, one pair
of TvMULE1 copies (contig 85938:11024–17138 and
contig 91860:9141–15539) appears to be nested within
another repeat. In fact, the similarity upstream and downstream of these copies extends to 1,246-bp and to 3,075bp, respectively, including putative 36-bp TIRs (5'GgGtcaTTATtGATTTTGTAATTTAATCGTcgTCGT-3', and
5'-ACGAtaATGATTAAATTACAAAATCgATAAcctCtC-3'),
suggesting an unknown repeat of approximately 4,300 bp
in length. This unknown repeat is itself flanked by two different TSDs (Table 2). Despite the fact that this full-length
nested configuration is observed only in the two genomic
regions mentioned above, multiple partial copies of
TvMULE1 that contain one end region are flanked by fragments of this unknown repeat. Sequence similarity
searches of this novel repeat against consensus sequences
of Trichomonas and Entamoeba genera stored in Repbase
database, ~55 repeat families identified in the T. vaginalis
genome [9] and Genbank showed no significant matches.
Therefore this element remains unidentified. We hypothesize that a copy of this repeat containing an insertion of
TvMULE1 has transposed in a recent past producing multiple nested copies. However, detailed empirical studies of
excision/transposition/insertion by transfection in new
lineages are required to corroborate this hypothesis.
TvMULE2, TvMULE3 and TvMULE4 are flanked by completely variable regions upstream and downstream of all
insertions (data not shown). Curiously, multiple TSDs
with distinct lengths are observed, a characteristic not

found in MULEs previously characterized (Table 2). Taken
at face value this would suggest an extreme flexibility in
their insertion sites.
Finally, as the genomic distribution of these repeats is
putatively the product of only self-mobilization, we
assessed the preferential insertion of these TvMULEs relative to local GC content calculated in the first 100, 2,000
and 5,000-nt. The average GC content within the nearest
100-nt is 26.9% (se = 0.0) for TvMULE2, 27.7% (se = 0.4)
for TvMULE3 and 25.0% (se = 0.3) for TvMULE4. The
average GC content in the 2,000-nt and 5,000-nt flanking
regions is slightly higher, ranging between 31.3% and
31.8% ± 0.0 for TvMULE2, 30.9% and 31.6% ± 0.2% for
TvMULE3, 30.0% and 30.7% ± 0.2% for TvMULE4,
respectively. This nucleotide composition is similar to
that of intergenic regions in the current assembly (28.8%)
and considerably lower than the GC content of T. vaginalis
genes (53.5%), suggesting either that these two TvMULE
families insert preferentially in non-active regions or that

insertions into genes have been eliminated by selection.
This is not unexpected since almost all T. vaginalis genes
are intronless and TE insertions within coding regions are
frequently associated to deleterious effects [e.g., [55]].
Phylogenetic relationship of TvMULEs
Three major clades of eukaryotic elements have been
identified to date in the Mutator superfamily: (1) the
MuDR group, characteristic of plant genomes, contains
the original Mutator elements identified in maize, and its
relatives from Arabidopsis and rice, (2) the Hop/Jittery
group contains elements from a variety of host taxa
including plants and fungi, and (3) the EMULE clade,
which contains all elements identified in the genome of
Entamoeba species. Members of these three clades were
used to determine the phylogenetic placement of the T.
vaginalis MULEs in the Mutator superfamily, and the tree
was rooted with elements belonging to the IS256 clade of
bacterial transposons. Bayesian analyses showed strong
support for the monophyly of the eukaryotic Mutator
sequences relative to the bacterial IS256 elements (Figure
4). The eukaryotic clade is present in 100% of the trees in
the posterior sample, a result that is confirmed by neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis (97% bootstrap support). There
is also strong support (87% in NJ bootstrap and 78% in
bayesian analysis) for a clade containing the MuDR elements. The NJ analysis suggests the monophyly of the
Hop/Jittery clade but the support from Bayesian and NJ
bootstrap analyses is <50%. Finally, the EMULE
sequences form a strongly supported monophyletic clade
(74% in NJ bootstrap and 99% in bayesian analysis). The
elements from T. vaginalis are nested within the broad
clade of eukaryotic Mutator elements. TvMULE1 clusters
with an element from O. sativa in the MuDR clade. On the
other hand, TvMULE2, TvMULE3 and TvMULE4, together
with the C. albicans sequences, form a monophyletic clade
present in 100% of the trees in the posterior sample of the
bayesian analysis and in 85% neighbor-joining bootstrap
trees. All these findings lead us to conclude that the
TvMULEs/C. albicans clade represents a new and quite distinct branch in the Mutator superfamily, which we name
TvCaMULEs.

The genetic distances within and between clades were calculated in order to determine the heterogeneity of the
MULEs. First, the TvCaMULE members are more divergent
regarding on the number of amino acid substitution per
site (aa/site) among each other (aa/site= 1.84 ± 0.17) than
the members of other clades (Hop/Jittery: aa/site= 1.53 ±
0.06; MuDR: aa/site= 1.45 ± 0.07; IS256: aa/site= 1.27 ±
0.08; and EMULEs: aa/site= 1.04 ± 0.09). However, this
higher divergence is due to difference between the members of the two species (aa/site= 2.19 ± 0.07) than
between C. albicans (aa/site= 1.43 ± 0.7) and the TvMULEs
(aa/site= 1.2 ± 0.1) sequences. Second, a pairwise compar-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/330

ison between clades shows that TvCaMULEs are the most
distinct from any other clade (aa/site= 2.96 ± 0.15) than
all other comparison pairs (aa/site= 2.5 ± 0.06). These
data lead us to conclude that TvCaMULEs form a heterogeneous group and that they are distantly related to the
other MULEs analyzed.
Multiple conserved motifs in Mutator and IS256
superfamilies
Forty eight Mutator and IS256 transposon sequences were
used to search for sequence motifs common within this
superfamily. Twelve conserved motifs were identified,
with motifs 1, 4 and 8 present in all sequences [see Additional file 2 and Table 3]. Interestingly, only the elements
of the MuDR and Hop/Jittery clades present the D34E
active site integrase signature between motifs 4 and 8,
while the bacterial transposons show a range in the
number of intervening residues in this region (D38-40E)
[Table 3]. Some motifs are clade-specific, such as motifs 5
and 9 in the IS256 clade, which are similar to the Mutatorlike transposase domain, while others are more widespread, such as motifs 7 and 10 harbored by plants and
fungi in the MuDR and Hop/Jittery clades.
Distribution and transcriptional activity of TvMULEs in
Trichomonads
The low degree of sequence polymorphism within
TvMULE families suggests a very recent expansion of
Mutator-like transposons in the T. vaginalis genome, either
due to TE-induced proliferation or to small-scale duplications of the host genome. To evaluate whether this expansion occurred before or after the global expansion of T.
vaginalis, four T. vaginalis isolates obtained from different
geographical regions were analyzed for the presence of
TvMULE homologs (Table 4). PCR products from each
sample were obtained using primer pairs from each
canonical MULE family of T. vaginalis (Table 5). The specificity of these amplifications was confirmed by stringent
DNA hybridizations using as probe an internal fragment
of Tpase isolated of the T. vaginalis JT strain. The strong
hybridization signal in all lanes suggests the presence of
all TvMULEs in the four T. vaginalis strains tested (Figure
5A). Interestingly, homologs to the TvMULEs occur in
other Trichomonad species, even though their distribution appears to be patchy. All non-T. vaginalis isolates
showed extremely weak or nearly imperceptible PCR
amplification (data not shown), possibly due to low copy
number and/or high sequence divergence in the primer
region. However, positive hybridization signals were still
detected against these amplicons in some of these species
(Figure 5A). In particular, Tetratrichomonas sp and T. gallinae, the two closest species to T. vaginalis examined, show
evidence of TvMULE1, TvMULE2 and TvMULE3, and of
TvMULE4, respectively. On the contrary, the species more
distantly related to T. vaginalis [47] show a heterogeneous

Discussion
Transposable elements are major players in the evolution
of eukaryote genomes. T. vaginalis, whose two-thirds of
the genome consists of repetitive sequences, is a fascinating species to study in this context, since several topics can
be explored: the discovery of new TEs, their structure and
origin, the dynamic of TEs among related species and geographical populations, and their comparison to those
characterized in other fully sequenced genomes. Mutator
elements are one of the most thoroughly studied plant TEs
[21,37,38,40-42,44,46,56-62]. For nearly three decades
after their initial discovery by Robertson [35] they were
thought to be present exclusively in plants. The first
homologous representatives were completely characterized in the early 2000's in fungi [22,23] and in the amoebozoa [24]. We have conducted a comprehensive study of

To verify if the TvMULEs are transcriptionally active,
polyA+ RNA was extracted and cDNAs synthesized from
one strain from T. vaginalis (JT) and six non-T. vaginalis
species and isolates (Table 4). Again, RT-PCR products
were obtained for each sample using the primer pairs of
each element and their homology to TvMULEs validated
by hybridization using the sequence from the JT strain of
T. vaginalis as probe. The presence of abundant mRNA for
the four TvMULEs was observed in the JT strain (Figure
5B), confirming that the four Mutator elements are active
transcriptionally in T. vaginalis. In contrast, the other speTable 4: Trichomonad species and strains used in this study

four new members of the Mutator superfamily in a new
taxonomic group, the Parabasalids, and in particular the
class Trichomonada, and conclude that three of the elements found are representatives of a new branch in the
evolutionary history of the Mutator superfamily.
This study shows that only TvMULE1 is a typical member
of the Mutator superfamily, since it shows significant similarity to Mutator proteins with known transposase motifs
and harbors some of the hallmarks of MULEs. Interestingly, TvMULE2, TvMULE3 and TvMULE4, in addition to
the presence of a conserved Mutator-like transposase
domain and a motif identical to the 25-aa signature
sequence of the MULE transposase core, also display new
and distinct conserved motifs. The presence of Mutatorlike elements in Trichomonads is not unrealistic, as the
evolutionary relatedness between the maize Mutator
autonomous elements and the bacterial IS256 [21] shows
this superfamily's ability to invade hosts across large evolutionary distances or to survive, by vertical transmission,
across the spectrum of life. New MULE families have
already been characterized in other early divergent eukaryotes, such as in the first genomes analyzed from the genus
Entamoeba [24]. What is perhaps surprising is that it took
over two decades for elements of the Mutator superfamily
to be identified in eukaryotic taxa other than plants. Our
Southern blot experiments using TvMULE probes strongly
suggest their presence in other trichomonad species and
our in silico analyses allowed their identification in the C.
albicans genome.
Elements similar to our repeats TvMULE2, TvMULE3 and
TvMULE4 have been submitted to Repbase Reports,
namely MuDR-4_TV [63], MuDR-3_TV [64], MuDR-5_TV
[65], respectively. These repeats and their structures differ
somewhat from those found here described in one or
more of the following characteristics: (1) length of the elements and the peptides they encode; (2) length of TSDs;

and (3) copy number estimates. The differences could be
due to the methods employed to determine the canonical
consensus sequences.
The four TvMULEs each carry a putative transposase ORF,
which are smaller than those of known MULE Tpases but
seem, nevertheless, to be functional since independent
lines of evidence support their transpositional activity.
The level of sequence divergence between copies and their
respective consensus sequences (identity >99%) and the
presence of complete copies inserted in different scaffold
locations suggest that these families have undergone a
recent process of activation and amplification. In addition, the set of expressed mRNAs includes transcripts with
high sequence similarity to these repeats. Interestingly,
typical MULE TIRs, characteristically over 100 bp long and
the perfect inverted complement of each other, and which
are supposedly necessary for mobilization, were not identified in TvMULES. We hypothesize that these repeats represent of a novel type of non-TIR-MULEs, similar to those
identified in A. thaliana, which are able to transpose in the
absence of long TIRs [40].
The large number and mobility of TvMULEs, much like
those observed for other TEs already characterized in T.
vaginalis [9,50-52], raise puzzling questions. What are the
biological and epidemiological features that explain such
high level of recent transposon activity in T. vaginalis,
while these elements present a heterogeneous distribution
among other Trichomonads examined? Could these elements have been recently introduced into T. vaginalis and,
if so, where from? How do these TEs contribute to the
architecture and dynamics of this highly repetitive
genome? What in the T. vaginalis genetic background
makes this genome permissive to the high activity of these
DNA transposons, to the extent that they have accumulated to hundreds and even thousands of copies per family [9]?

A fascinating hypothesis to explain the extraordinary
expansion of TEs in the genome of T. vaginalis was proposed by Carlton and collaborators [9]. T. vaginalis, unlike
most other Trichomonads which are enteric, is a parasite
of the human urogenital tract. A large cell size is likely
advantageous in this species, since it increases its phagocytosis ability, decreases the probability of it being
ingested by other organisms and host macrophages, and
facilitates adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells. There is a
strong, and possibly causal, correlation between genome
size and cell size [66-68]. Therefore, an initial stochastic
expansion of TE families could have given rise to the variation upon which natural selection could act, favoring the
largest cells and, concomitantly, those with the largest TE
complement [9]. It is interesting to note that Tritrichomonas foetus, the only other vaginal trichomonad surveyed, was the only other species in which all four
TvMULEs were detected.
The large copy number and extremely low polymorphism
of TvMULEs and other T. vaginalis repeats, as well as their
absence in T. tenax, a parasite of the bucal cavity and the
sister taxon to T. vaginalis, suggest a fast repeat expansion
that has taken place in a recent evolutionary past [9]. The
lack of homologs of the T. vaginalis repeats in T. tenax [9]
also raises the possibility that these elements have been
recently acquired through horizontal transfer, a phenomenon that is relatively more common than was once
believed, and which is possibly an essential step in the
life-cycle of successful class II transposable elements
[69,70]. Here we found evidence for the presence of some
TvMULE homologs in some of the species surveyed. In
particular, only TvMULE4 shows a strong hybridization
signal in T. gallinae, the closest species to T. vaginalis examined in this study, while homologs to the other three
TvMULE families are present in more distantly related species. The possibility remains that these repeats could have
been lost from some species, or that the PCR primers used
did not amplify existing divergent homologous repeats,
an issue that can only be solved with an extensive
genomic survey of the family Trichomonadidae.
Transposable elements have undeniably played a major
role in the expansion of eukaryotic genomes, a phenomenon well documented in plants [71], arthropods [72] and
vertebrates [73-76]. Rapid genome expansions due to
bursts of TE amplification, similar to what is observed in
T. vaginalis, have also been postulated for a variety of
organisms [77-81]. What sets T. vaginalis apart is the fact
that it is an asexual species, which, like all other trichomonads, reproduces by longitudinal binary fission. It
has been argued that transposons are unable to persist in
the long term in clonal lineages because the mechanisms
that keep TE copy number in check in sexual species, and
that thereby prevent excessive mutational loads, are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/330

absent in asexual lineages [82]. In addition, once lost,
they cannot be reintroduced by sexually-mediated genetic
transfer [83]. Given the recency of the TE expansion in T.
vaginalis, their long-term effect on the survival of the species is as yet unclear. It is possible that, with each TE family expansion, this species is steadily proceeding to
extinction.

Conclusion
The remarkably recent common ancestry of each TE family in the T. vaginalis genome is attested to by the high
copy number and nearly complete within-family
sequence similarity of these TvMULEs, features that are
shared with the other ~55 repeat families identified in the
T. vaginalis genome. The structure of each repeat, inferred
from the consensus of all copies within a family, is therefore likely to reflect with high accuracy the ancestral
sequence of each original active element. This makes the
genome sequence of T. vaginalis is an ideal mining ground
for new transposable elements, which sequence and structure have not yet been adulterated by the accumulation of
inactivating mutations.

Methods
The consensus sequences of the newly characterized Mutator-like elements from Trichomonas vaginalis described
here have been submitted to Repbase Reports http://
www.girinst.org.
In silico analyses
The draft genome sequence of the G3 strain of T. vaginalis
was obtained from the website of The Institute for
Genomic Research (TIGR) http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/
tvg/. This draft, based on ~7.2-fold coverage of the
genome, consists of 17,290 scaffolds, representing ~160
Mbp [9]. Sequence similarity searches using the four consensus sequences of TvMULEs as query against the T. vaginalis genome were performed using BLASTN [84], with
parameters E = e-20, V = 10,000 and B = 10,000. Significant matches were required to be >200 bp long and display ≥ 80% identity. We will refer to the repeat copies
found in the genomes according to the contig scaffold
name and the start and end position of the copy. The coordinates of each BLASTN match were extracted using our
customized Perl scripts, which utilized some modules of
the BioPerl toolkit [85], and aligned with ClustalW [86]
with default parameters. When available, the regions
flanking each insertion were extracted for additional analyses: i) logo sequences were built from the first 25 nt
upstream and downstream of each insertion using WebLogo [87], ii) the extent of the similarity between insertions, in regions upstream of the 5' end and downstream
of the 3' end, was evaluated by BLASTN, and iii) the "guanine and cytosine" content (percent GC) was calculated
from the first 100, 2,000 and 5,000 flanking nucleotides

using the program "geecee" of the EMBOSS package http:/
/emboss.sourceforge.net.
As T. vaginalis genes are mostly intronless all open reading
frames (ORFs) corresponding to protein coding genes
start with a methionine (Met) residue. The location of all
ORFs starting with a Met residue that were at least 100
amino acids in length was determined for all contigs that
contained the four TvMULEs, using the program "getorf"
of the EMBOSS package. Homologs to the most frequent
ORFs associated with each TE were detected by BLASTP
against the non-redundant protein database in GenBank.
Conserved domains were predicted with the « Conserved
domain search » toolbox from NCBI [88] or the MEME
package [89]. The putative occurrence of conserved terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) was analyzed by BLAST 2
sequences [90] and manual inspection.
Phylogenetic Analyses
Additional sequences of Mutator elements and related TE
families from a variety of taxa, including plants, fungi,
protists and bacteria, were obtained from GenBank, Repbase Report, TIGR http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/eha1/
and the BLAST Server of the Sanger Institute http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/
comp_Entamoeba. Highly conserved regions in 56 protein sequences of Mutator and IS256 were detected using
MEME, with the following parameters: number of different motifs = 15; minimum and maximum motif width =
5 and 300 amino acids, respectively. Twelve motifs were
identified, of which motif 1 is conserved in all sequences,
motif 8 occurs with the second highest frequency followed
by motif 4 [see Additional file 2]. These three motifs are
contiguous in the following orientation: motif 4 → motif
8 → motif 1. The sequences with motifs 4 and 8 were used
as reference for discovering homologous regions by manual inspection in proteins where they were not identified
by MEME due to their higher sequence divergence. The
three motifs were found in 48 of the initial 56 sequences.
This region containing motifs 4, 8 and 1 was extracted and
aligned by CLUSTALW [86] with default parameters; the
alignment was refined manually [see Additional file 3].
Two methods were used to reconstruct the evolutionary
relationships among the sequences: i) neighbor-joining
(NJ) with the JTT substitution model, pairwise deletion
condition and the bootstrap analysis consisted of 1,000
replicates as implemented in MEGA4 [91], and (ii) a bayesian analysis, implemented in MrBayes v3.1.2 [92]. Model
settings for MrBayes were as follows: amino acid transition matrix was set to a mixture of models with fixed rate
matrices (Poisson, Jones, Dayhoff, Mtrev, Mtmam, Wag,
Rtrev, Cprev, Vt, and Blosum) of equal prior probabilities,
site rate variation described by a gamma distribution (α
uniformly distributed between 0–200, with 4 rate categories), and a proportion of invariant sites uniformly distrib-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/330

uted between 0.0–1.0. Branch lengths were unconstrained
and described by an exponential distribution (10.0). Two
simultaneous runs of MrBayes, with 4 chains each, ran for
1,500,000 generations. Results were evaluated after a
burn-in period of 10% (150,000 generations) and convergence was achieved (PSRF= 1.00) for all model parameters
estimated, including tree length (mean = 18.8), α = 2.28
and the proportion of invariant sites (4%), the amino acid
model (Blosum), and the tree topology (see results).
Trichomonad species and Culture medium
The trichomonad species used in this study are listed in
Table 4. Cultures were maintained in TYM Diamond's
medium [93] as suggested by the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), and grown at 36.5°C until reaching 5
× 106cells. The samples were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed two times in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.2).
DNA amplification and sequencing
Amplification of each of the four TvMULEs was performed
with primer sets designed to amplify an internal region of
the transposase domain (Table 5). PCR was done in a volume of 25 μl with 0.5U of Taq DNA polymerase in 1×
polymerase buffer, 10 μM of each primer, a 200 μM concentration of each dNTP and 1.5 mM MgCl2. The solutions
were heated to 94°C for 2 min, and followed by 35 cycles
of denaturation (94°C for 1 min), annealing (60°C for 2
min), and extension (72°C for 1 min), followed by a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products with the
expected size were excised from 1% agarose gels, purified
using GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), and cloned using TOPO
TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To confirm the
identity of the PCR products from the T. vaginalis JT isolate, both strands of two clones for each transposon, chosen at random, were sequenced using the BigDye
Terminator mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and
run on an ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). The clones were used as probes to confirm DNA
and cDNA PCR amplification of each TvMULE.
DNA and cDNA hybridization analyses
Genomic DNA was extracted from the eight trichomonad
species listed in Table 4 using DNAzol® reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and PCRs run on each sample with
TvMULE-specific primers. The occurrence of TvMULEs in
different species was confirmed by Southern blot of PCR
products using the detection system Gene Images CDP-Star
detection module (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK), due to non-availability of total DNA content
sufficient for direct DNA gel blot. Cloned TvMULE transposase fragments were labeled with the chemioluminescent hybridization system Gene Images random-prime
labeling module (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont,

UK). PCR products were separated in 1% agarose gels and
transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Blots were prehybridized 1
h at 60°C in 5× SSC, 5% dextran sulfate and 20-fold dilution of liquid block and hybridized overnight with the
probes of each TvMULEs. Blots were washed twice with
0.2× SSC, 0.5% SDS and exposed to autoradiographic film
for 20 minutes at room temperature.

d(T)12 (Gene Link™, Hawthorne, NY) at low stringency
(37°C). RT-PCR products of each cDNA sample were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, and the fragments were
transferred onto Hybond N+ membranes. Prehybridization, hybridization, washing and detection were performed as for DNA hybridization.
