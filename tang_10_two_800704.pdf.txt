Two storage hexamerins from the beet
armyworm Spodoptera exigua: Cloning,
characterization and the effect of gene silencing
on survival
Bin Tang1, Shigui Wang1*, Fan Zhang2*

Abstract
Background: In insects, hemocyanin superfamily proteins accumulate apparently to serve as sources of amino
acids during metamorphosis, reproduction and development. Storage hexamerins are important members of the
hemocyanin superfamily. Although insects possess storage hexamerins, very little is known about the character and
specific functions of hexamerin 1 and storage protein 1 in insect development.
Results: To gain insight into the function of storage proteins in insects, cDNAs for two storage proteins were
cloned from the fat body of Spodoptera exigua. S. exigua hexamerin 1 (SeHex) cDNA contained an open reading
frame of 2124 nucleotides encoding a protein of 707 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 82.12 kDa.
S. exigua storage protein 1 (SeSP1) cDNA contained an open reading frame of 2256 bp encoding a protein of 751
amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of ~88.84 kDa. Northern blotting analyses revealed that SeHex
mRNA is expressed in the fat body, cuticle, midgut and Malpighian tubules and SeSP1 in fat body, Malpighian
tubules and tracheae. SeHex and SeSP1 mRNAs were expressed in fat body at different levels from first instar larvae
to pupae, with expression was much lower from first instar larvae to first-day fifth instar larvae. SeHex transcript
expression was high in fat body of wandering larvae (pre-pupae) and steadily decreased to the seventh pupal day.
SeSP1 transcript expression was high in fat body of wandering larvae, 2-day-old fifth instar larvae and 2-, 4- and 7day-old pupae. SeHex and SeSP1 mRNAs levels were expressed lower than control on the condition of starvation at
12 h. Of insects injected with SeHex and SeSP1 dsRNA, 38.7% and 24.3% survived to 204 h after treatment,
respectively. This was significantly lower than in the controls groups.
Conclusions: These findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns and the function in
starvation of storage proteins. RNA interference results revealed that storage protein genes are key in
metamorphosis, reproduction and insect development. The results for SeHex and SeSP1 interference reveal that a
potential method to control this pest is to disrupt the regulation of storage proteins.

unavailable and the demand for amino acids is high
[1,2]. Before the initiation of insect metamorphosis and
reproduction, these proteins are progressively stored in
larval hemolymph. Hexamerins are mainly synthesized
by the fat body during larval development, stored in the
hemolymph, and sequestered in the fat body, where they
serve as sources of nitrogen and amino acids for pupae
and adults during metamorphosis and reproduction
[3-5].
The insect tracheal system has many respiratory proteins that transport oxygen in the hemolymph and, in

preparing for metamorphosis, insect larvae store a huge
amount of protein in hemolymph [6-9]. These specialized oxygen-transport proteins evolved from the copper-containing hemocyanins [10]. In most Hexapoda,
gas exchange is mediated by the tracheal system, a network of tubules that open to the atmosphere on the
cuticle and radiate to all parts of the body. Oxygen is
delivered through the trachea and tracheoles in the gaseous phase [11]..
Insect hexamerins share sequence similarities with
other proteins of divergent functions [12] and belong to
a protein superfamily that also comprises arthropod
phenoloxidases, crustacean pseudohemocyanins, insect
storage hexamerins and dipteran hexamerin receptors
[10,12-15]. The most abundant and widely distributed
storage proteins that accumulate in the hemolymph or
fat body are composed of six identical or similar subunits of ~80 kDa, and thus are also called hexamerins
[4,13,16-18]. Storage hexamerins include the hexamerins, juvenile hormone-related protein, riboflavin-binding
hexamerin precursor, methionine-rich storage protein
(storage protein 1, SP1), very-high-density lipoprotein,
tyrosine-rich proteins and hemocyanin-related proteins
[4,19].
Genes for storage hexamerins have been cloned from
plants, bacteria and fungi. Gordadze et al. cloned two
hexamerin cDNAs from the mosquito Aedes aegypti
[20]. So far, SPs and hexamerins have been cloned and
studied in Musca domestica [21], Apriona germari
[22,23], Apis mellifera [5], Drosophila melanogaster [24]
and Reticulitermes flavipes [25]. In Lepidoptera, SPs and
hexamerins have been cloned and studied in Spodoptera
litura [26], Plodia interpunctella [2], Corcyra cephalonica [27], Manduca sexta [28], Amsacta albistriga
[29-31], Plutella xylostella [32], Helicoverpa zea [33],
Omphisa fuscidentalis [34], and Sesamia nonagrioides
[35,36].
Spodoptera exigua, commonly called the beet armyworm, is a worldwide agricultural pest that has developed resistance to many chemical pesticides. In the
present study, we cloned cDNA for two hexamerin
genes from S. exigua (EF646282 and EU259816). We
observed expression of these two genes not only in fat
body, but also in Malpighian tubules and other tissues.
Furthermore, the genes exhibited differential expression
patterns in fat body and they play a role in starvation.
We used RNA interference (RNAi) to investigate the
functions of the genes.

Results
SeHex and SeSP1 cDNA sequence analysis

SeHex had an open reading frame of 2124 bp, encoding
a protein of 707 amino acids (Figure 1A) with a predicted molecular weight (MW) of approximately 82.12

Page 2 of 13

kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.48. SP1 had an
open reading frame of 2256 bp, encoding a protein of
751 amino acids (Figure 1B) with a predicted MW of
approximately 88.84 kDa and pI of 9.10.
SeHex cDNA (GenBank accession no. EF646282) has
43-74% identity to other known Hex genes (Additional
file 1). SeHex is most similar to Hex from the lepidopteran H. armigera (74% identity). It is also similar to
Hex genes from Trichoplusia ni, Hyalophora cecropia,
Galleria mellonella and O. fuscidentalis (Figure 2).
SeSP1 cDNA (GenBank no. EU259816) has 28-96%
identity to other known SP1 genes (Additional file 1).
SeSP1 is most similar to SP1 from the lepidopteran S.
litura (96% identity). It is also similar to SP1 genes from
T. ni, S. nonagrioides, H. cecropia, Hyphantria cunea, M.
sexta, Samia cynthia, Heliconius erato, Bombyx mori,
Chilo suppressalis, P. interpunctella, A. aegypti, Culex
quinquefasciatus, Anopheles gambiae, Periplaneta americana, Perla marginata, Thermobia domestica, Reticulitermes speratus, A. germari, Sinella curviseta, Tribolium
castaneum, Tenebrio molitor and R. flavipes (Figure 2).
Protein sequence analysis

In Figure 1, underlined amino acid residues 1-18 and 115 represent the signal peptides for SeHex and SeSP1,
respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences for
SeHex and SeSP1 contain not only four signature motifs
of the hemocyanin family, such as ERL (residues 277279 and 281-283), RDP (424-426), RLNH (506-509) and
GFP (668-670 and 630-632), but also other conserved
motifs. Sequence alignment for lepidopteran Hex proteins revealed three highly conserved regions (Additional
file 1A). Alignment of lepidopteran SP1 proteins
revealed ten highly conserved motifs (Additional file
1B). Four potential N-glycosylation sites (amino acids
75, 209, 479 and 647) were found in SeHex, but only
one potential site (amino acid 47) in SeSP1 (Figure 1,
Additional file 1).
Results for two hexamerin genes from the termite R.
flavipes (RfHex) revealed conserved hexamerin signature
motifs (ADKP/QFKM/QK/RQ, YFTEDVGL and
TALRDPAY/NQ) [24]. The protein sequence encoded
by SeHex had only two signature motifs (YFTNDFGL
and TALRDPAFY) in common with RfHex. Sequence
alignment revealed four conserved signature motifs
(ERL, RDP, RLNH and GFP) for insect hexamerins and
storage proteins. Three conserved motifs (RYYMRRLS,
YQTALR/SDPAY/FYMIM/WKRVL and FFLAPKYD)
were observed for lepidopteran Hex genes (Figure 1 and
Additional file 1). Moreover, lepidopteran SP1 genes had
ten highly conserved regions (PRGE, GMFV/LY, I/
VDW/SRKGV/LR/P, KERR/QGE, QLLAR, WPKI,
RDGT, LRDP, VRI/VFL/IGPKY/FDCM/LGR/LL and
GFPFDR) (Figure 1 and Additional file 1).

Tissue distribution of Hex and SP1 in S. exigua

Northern blotting revealed strong SeHex bands for fat body
and midgut and weak bands for cuticle and Malpighian
tubules, but no transcripts were detected for brain, spermary and trachea samples from S. exigua larvae (Figure 3A).
The results suggest that SeHex is specifically expressed in
fat body, midgut, cuticle and Malpighian tubules. Northern
blotting results for SeSP1 transcripts revealed expression in
fat body, Malpighian tubules and tracheae, but not in
brain, cuticle, midgut and spermary (Figure 3A).

XM_968706 and TcSP1, XM_967951) and Trichoplusia ni (TnHex,
CBLJHSP and TnSP1, L03280).

SeHex and SeSP1 mRNAs were expressed in fat body at
different levels from fifth instar larvae to pupae. SeHex
transcripts were highly expressed in fat body in wandering
larvae (pre-pupae), as well as in day-1 and day-2 pupae.
Transcripts were present at lower levels in fat body of day2 and day-3 fifth instar larvae and the day-3 and day-4
pupae. SeHex transcripts were very low in fat body of day1 and day-7 pupae (Figure 3B). Moreover, SeHex expression steadily decreased from wandering larvae to 6-dayold pupae. The results suggest that SeHex mRNA is constitutively expressed at a rather high level in fat body from
the second day of larva stages to the fourth day of pupa
stages. SeSP1 transcripts were highly expressed in fat body
in wandering larvae (pre-pupae), as well as in day-2 fifth
instar larvae and day-2, day-4 and day-7 pupae. It was present at lower levels on day-3 fifth instar larvae and day-1,
day-3 and day-6 pupae (Figure 3B).
Comparative RT-PCR results showed that SeHex and
SeSP1 mRNAs were expressed at very low levels in fat
body from first instar larvae to day-1 fifth instar larvae.
SeHex and SeSP1 mRNAs expression was higher in day2 fifth instar larvae (Figure 3C).
SeHex and SeSP1 proteins’ function identified on the
condition of starvation

RT-PCR analysis showed that SeHex and SeSP1 transcripts were mainly lowly expressed when the insects
were been on the condition of starvation. And SeHex
and SeSP1 transcripts expressed in the same mode or
tread in the different starvation treatment (Figure 4A,
4B). In the group of starvation with 6 h, once stress
after finals, SeHex and SeSP1 mRNA expressional levels
lower than control, but higher than the group of starvation with 12 h at 6 h, 24 h and 36 h (Figure 4A, 4B). In
the group of starvation with 12 h, once stress was finished, SeHex and SeSP1 mRNA expressed decreased and
keep the lower expressional levels.

after double-stranded RNA injection

Double-stranded RNA for SeHex and SeSP1 (dsSeHex
and dsSeSP1) was injected into day-2 fifth instar larvae.

The survival rate of insects injected with dsSeHex was
50.55%, 42.60%, 39.42% and 38.73% at 36, 48, 60 and
204 h after injection, respectively, which is significantly
lower than the survival of insects in the two control
groups (Figure 5). A sharp decrease in survival rate was
observed between 24 and 36 h after dsSeHex injection.
The survival rate of insects injected with dsSeSP1 was
42.18%, 40.54%, 25.07% and 24.29% at 36, 48, 60 and
204 h after injection, respectively, which is significantly
lower than the survival of insects in the two control
groups (Figure 5). Two sharp decreases in survival rate
were observed from 24 to 36 h and from 48 to 60 h
after dsSeSP1 injection. Prior to death, these larvae
usually became less vital and smaller in size.
To test the RNAi efficiency, semi-quantitative RT-PCR
was performed to detect SeHex and SeSP1 transcripts.
SeHex and SeSP1 mRNA levels substantially decreased
at 12, 24 and 36 h after injection compared to the negative controls (dsGFP and no injection) (Figure 6A, B).
However, transcription of both genes recovered to some
extent 48 h after injection.

Discussion
Many different storage proteins are found in larvae and
pupae at different stages, but not all species have all the
storage proteins. Ryan et al. were the first to identify a
74-kDa hexamerin subunit in A. mellifera larval hemolymph [37]. Two storage proteins have also been

no injection

investigated in the honeybee A. mellifera [38], the ant
Camponotus festinatus [39,40], and several other ant
species [41]. In Lepidoptera, two different types of
methionine-rich hexamerins can be classified according
to their common amino acid composition [16,42,43],
and three or four SPs are found in some species. Storage
proteins first reported in T. ni in final-stage larvae [44]
and two SPs in M. sexta have been separated and cloned
[45,46]. Six storage proteins of four different types have
been found in Caplodes ethlius [19]. In the present
study, two storage proteins were cloned from S. exigua
(Figure 1). The results in Figure 2 show that three storage proteins (SP1, SP2 and Hex2) are found in the
Hymenoptera A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus. Moreover, no more than three different storage proteins have
been found in Lepidoptera (Figure 2).
Storage proteins serve as a source of amino acids for
tissue metamorphosis during pupal development and
have been shown to be a component of the sclerotizing
system of the cuticle [47]. They also serve as an ecdysteroid carrier in the hemolymph and function in nutrient uptake and storage; some are also capable of
binding the insect morphogenetic hormone juvenile hormone [48-50]. Storage proteins are mainly synthesized
in fat body during larval development and stored in the
hemolymph [9]. Corcyra cephalonica hexamerin protein
2 was expressed in fat body and carcass tissue, but not
in salivary gland, midgut or Malpighian tubules [27].

Figure 6 (A) SeHex and (B) SeSP1 transcript analysis by RT-PCR amplification after dsRNA injection. Three larval states (before death, still
living and less vital) were randomly selected at each time point after injection. Total RNA was extracted and reversed to cDNA using AMV
reverse transcriptase (Takara). SeHex and SeSP1 specific probes were radiolabeled with [a-32P]-dCTP. The specific primers SeHex-FP and SeHex-RP
or SeSP1-FP and SeSP1-RP were used to amplify cDNAs in the same PCR reactions. The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gel and
transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane. Hybridization, washing and signal detection of the blots were carried out as described previously.

Kim et al. reported that A. germari hexamerin was
expressed not only in fat body, but also in midgut, in
agreement with our results for SeHex1 [22]. We found
that SeHex was expressed not only in fat body and midgut, but also in cuticle and Malpighian tubules (Figure
3A). SP1 in Amsacta albistriga was detected in fat body
and pupal ovary [31]. However, the results for SeSP1
reveal that it is expressed in fat body, Malpighian
tubules and tracheae (Figure 3A). Storage proteins do
not bind copper or transport oxygen to the hemolymph

[51,52], and lower expression levels were detected in
Malpighian tubules and tracheae (Figure 3A). This is
consistent with the theory of hemocyanin superfamily
evolution.
Storage proteins accumulate in large quantities in
hemolymph during final instar larvae, are taken up by
fat body cells and serve as a reservoir for subsequent
development [4,43,53]. CcHex2 mRNA was present at all
stages of larval development of C. cephalonica and
reached a maximum in fat body of final instar larvae

Tang et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/65

[27]. AalSP1 expression gradually increased from day-1
to day-7 final instar larvae [30]. It has been reported
that expression levels of insect storage proteins (including Hex1, Hex2, SP1 and SP2) reach a maximum in the
last stage of final instar larvae [31,54]. SeHex and SeSP1
mRNA expression also reached a maximum in the final
stage (pre-pupae) of last instar larvae (Figure 3B). However, SeHex and SeSP1 mRNA expression was much
lower before the first day of fifth instar larvae, so it was
not detected in the 25 μg of total RNA used for Northern blotting. In order to get the exact expression patterns of SeHex and SeSP1 mRNA in the larvae
developmental stages, the more sensitive way of RTPCR is used. And RT-PCR results confirmed that
expression of these storage proteins is high in final
instar larvae (Figure 3C). This result showed that storage protein can be accumulated on the good nutritional
status, just as the last larvae in S. exigua.
The function of storage proteins is clear. In M. sexta,
starvation is effective in reducing mRNA levels of both
hexamerin genes [55]. In the group of starvation with 12
h, SeHex and SeSP1 mRNA expression was much lower
than control (Figure 4A, 4B), that showed storage proteins are key in the stress of starvation. Hakim and colleagues reported that a monomeric a-arylphorin storage
protein can stimulate stem cell proliferation in the lepidopterans M. sexta and Spodoptera littoralis and in the
beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata. In addition, feeding an
artificial diet containing arylphorin increased the growth
rate of several insect species [56]. It is known that storage proteins are crucial for insect development and disruption has a negative effect on the natural development
and movement of an insect, which may eventually die.
RNAi was used to investigate the function of SeHex and
SeSP1 in the present study and resulted in adult survival
rates of 38.73% and 24.29%, respectively (Figure 5).
Moreover, SeHex and SeSP1 mRNA was substantially
lower at 36 h after injection compared to the negative
control (Figure 6). And the expression levels of some
control larvae are weird may result in the side effect of
inject. The results confirm that SeHex and SeSP1 mRNA
expression is crucial for insect life. Abnormal morphological development was not observed after RNAi treatment. It is also found that SeHex and SeSP1 mRNA are
lower on the condition of starvation. Hence, a lack of
nutritional reserves or developmental failure may be key
reasons for the lethality. Nevertheless, the SeHex and
SeSP1 RNAi results suggest that a potential method for
control of this pests is to disrupt the regulation of storage proteins.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that genes for two storage hexamerins
exist in S. exigua. SeHex transcripts were expressed not

Page 9 of 13

only in fat body, but also in cuticle, midgut and Malpighian tubules. SeSP1 mRNA was expressed in fat
body, Malpighian tubules and tracheae. Furthermore,
SeHex and SeSP1 have differential expression patterns in
fat body. The results of starvation treatment suggest
that SeHex and SeSP1 have important functions in S.
exigua. RNAi results showed that these proteins are critical for S. exigua metamorphosis, indicating that a
potential method for control of this pest is to disrupt
the regulation of storage proteins.

Methods
Insect culture

S. exigua larvae were reared at 25 ± 1°C with an L14:
D10 photoperiod on an artificial diet [37]. The developmental stages were synchronized at each molt by collecting new larvae or pupae. The brain, midgut, fat
body, cuticle, Malpighian tubules, spermary and tracheae
from different stages from fifth instar larvae and the fat
body from day-1 fifth instar to day-7 pupae were dissected in saline containing 0.75% NaCl and stored at
-80°C until further use.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was isolated from the fat body of S. exigua
pupae using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenolchloroform method [57,58]. The fat body (100 mg) was
homogenized in solution D (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate; 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7; 0.5% sarcosyl; 0.1 M
2-mercaptoethanol), placed on ice for 5 min, and then
sodium acetate, phenol (pH 7.0) and chloroform/isoamyl
alcohol (49:1) were added. The mixture was centrifuged
at 10,000×g at 4°C for 20 min. The supernatant was
transferred to a new tube and then isopropanol was
added. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed
with 75% ethanol and then dissolved in ddH2O. A sample of 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed at 42°C
for 1 h in a 25- μl reaction solution containing reaction
buffer, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μg of oligodT18 and reverse transcriptase from avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV, Takara, Japan) [59].
Polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of
cDNA ends

Two pairs of degenerate primers were designed based
on the conserved amino acid sequences of known Hex
and SP1 proteins. The first PCR reaction was performed
with primers DF1 and DR1 using the following conditions: three cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 45°C and 90 s
at 72°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at
48°C and 90 s at 72°C. A second PCR was carried out
using the nested primers DF2 and DR2 using the same
cycle conditions [60]. The products were subjected to
agarose electrophoresis and the DNA bands were then

excised from the gel and purified using a DNA gel
extraction kit (Omega, USA). The PCR products were
cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara) and
sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method
(Invitrogen).
cDNA was synthesized according to the manufacturer’s protocol (SMART™ kit, Clontech/Takara). Specific primers, Hex-5R1, Hex-5R2, SP1-5R1 and SP1-5R2
for 5’-RACE and Hex-3F1, Hex-3F2, SP1-3F1 and SP13F2 for 3’-RACE (Table 1), were designed and synthesized based on the cDNA sequence of the known PCR
fragment. 5’-RACE was performed using 2.5 μl of 5’ready-cDNA with Universal Primer Mix (UPM, Clontech/Takara) and Hex-5R1 or SP1-5R1. Then nested
PCR was carried out using Nested Universal Primer A
(NUP, Clontech/Takara) and Hex-5R2 or SP1-5R1. 3’-

RACE was performed using 2.5 μl of 3’-ready-cDNA
with UPM and Hex-3F1 or SP1-3F1, then with NUP
and Hex-3F2 or SP1-3F2. The PCR conditions were as
follows: 10 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 30 s at 60°C and 150 s at 72°C, then 10 min at
72°C. Samples were then kept at 12°C.
Cloning of full-length SeHex and SeSP1 cDNA

Based on the conserved amino acid and nucleotide
sequences of hexamerin and storage protein 1 from B.
mori, A. aegypti, A. gambiae, G. mellonella, Helicoverpa
armigera and M. sexta, we designed eight degenerate
primers (Hex-DF1, Hex-DF2, Hex-DR1, Hex-DR2, SP1DF1, SP1-DF2, SP1-DR1and SP1-DR2) for PCR reactions. Fragments of 800 bp (SeHex-DF2 and SeHexDR2) and 1100 bp (SeSP1-DF2 and SeSP1-DR2) were

first obtained from fat-body cDNA by a second PCR.
After sequencing, the deduced amino acid sequence was
found to have a high degree of similarity to insect hexamerin classes. We then performed 5’ and 3’ rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using several specific primers (Table 1) designed based on the fragment
sequences, as well as universal primers (Clontech). The
600- and 1000-bp PCR products for SP1 and two 1100bp PCR products for Hex were amplified by 5’ and 3’RACE, respectively. After assembling the overlapping
fragments, full-length cDNAs of 2651 bp for Hex and
2254 for SP1 were obtained.
Analysis of SeHex and SeSP1 cDNA sequences

The neighbor-joining method was used to construct a
phylogenetic tree with MEGA 3.1 software based on the
amino acid sequences of known insect hexamerins.
SeHex and SeSP1 cDNA sequences were compared with
those for other Hex, SP1 or hexamerin proteins deposited in GenBank using the BLAST-N or BLAST-X tools
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) website. The amino acid sequences encoded by
SeHex and SeSP1 were deduced from the corresponding
cDNA sequences using the translation tool at the
ExPASy Proteomics website http://expasy.org/tools/dna.
html. A bootstrap analysis was carried out and the
robustness of each cluster was verified using 1000 replicates. Other protein sequence analysis tools used in this
study, including MW, pI and N-glycosylation sites, were
obtained from the ExPASy Proteomics website http://
expasy.org/. Multiple sequence alignment of insect
hemocyanin family protein sequences was performed
using the tool at the multiple sequence alignment website http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/multalin/multalin.html.
Probe labeling and Northern blotting analysis

Tissue-specific expression of SeHex and SeSP1 was
determined by Northern blotting. cDNA fragments of
990 bp (primers Hex-FP and Hex-RP) and 895 bp (primers SP1-FP and SP1-RP) were labeled with [a- 32 P]
dCTP using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Takara,
Japan) as the hybridization probe [59]. Samples of 25 μg
of total RNA isolated from brain, midgut, fat body, cuticle, Malpighian tubules, spermary and tracheae of day-3
fifth instar larvae were separated on a formaldehyde
agarose gel containing ethidium bromide [59]. The RNA
was subsequently blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane
(Amersham) and pre-hybridized at 42°C for 3-6 h. The
[a-32P]-labeled SeHex and SeSP1 probes were added and
incubated at 42°C for up to 12 h in 5× SSPE (0.75 M
NaCl, 0.05 M NaH2PO4, 0.005 M EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 0.1%
SDS and 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA [61,62]. After
hybridization, the membrane was washed with 0.2×

Page 11 of 13

SSPE (0.03 M NaCl, 0.002 M NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.0002 M
EDTA, pH 7.4) at 45°C and exposed to X-ray film at
-70°C for 24 h [59].
Developmental expression of SeHex and SeSP1 by
Northern blotting and RT-PCR amplification

Developmental expression of SeHex and SeSP1 from
fifth instar larvae to pupae was determined by Northern
blotting. The fat body was dissected from day-1 fifth
instar larvae to day-7 pupae. Total RNA was isolated
from the fat body and 25 μg was separated on a formaldehyde agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Northern blotting was carried out as described above. A
sample of 25 μg of total RNA was also used to detect
the expression of SeHex and SeSP1 in young larvae, but
the results were poor. Thus, more sensitive RT-PCR was
used to detect the expression of SeHex and SeSP1 in larval stages. The PCR reaction was performed with primers Hex-FP and Hex-RP (or SP1-FP and SP1-RP)
using the following conditions: 10 min at 94°C, followed
by 37 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C and 70 s at
72°C, then 10 min at 72°C. Samples were then kept at
12°C. The PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.
The expression of SeHex and SeSP1 in starvation
treatment by RT-PCR amplification

The day-2 fifth instar larvae were used as experimental
insects in the treatment of starvation. In the experiment
of starvation, all of the insects were divided into two
processed groups and a control group. Two experimental group insects were starvation with 6 h and 12 h,
respectively. Followed by these insect continue to rear at
25 ± 1°C with an L14:D10 photoperiod using an artificial diet. The insects were observed at 0 h (before treatment), 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h and 72 h after
treatment. Every three to five lively larvae were randomly selected and stored at -80°C for subsequent RNA
extraction. The way of PCR reaction just as the
previous.
Injection of dsRNA into S. exigua larvae

dsRNA for SeHex and SeSP1 genes was prepared
according to methods established in the State Key
Laboratory of Biocontrol of Sun Yat-sen University [60].
The T7 RiboMAX™ Express RNAi system (Promega,
USA) was used for synthesis. Day-2 fifth instar larvae
were used for injection experiments. For each treatment,
5 μg of dsRNA dissolved in 5 μl of DEPC water was
injected into the side of the thorax of a larva using a
10- μl syringe (Hamilton) and the injection point was
sealed immediately with wax. Control larvae were
injected with an equivalent volume of dsRNA corresponding to a GFP gene or were not injected. Each

Insect survival and morphological changes were
recorded every 12 h. The insects were observed at 24 h
(day-2 5th instar larvae), 36 h (day-3 5th instar larvae),
48 h (pre-pupae), 60 h (pupae) and 204 h (adult) after
injection. To assess the effect of a treatment, ANOVA
was performed using the cumulative percentage of
abnormal and dead larvae as the dependent variable and
treatment (dsSeHex, dsSeSP1, dsGFP or no injection) as
the independent variable. Post hoc Duncan’s tests were
used to determine differences among groups when treatment effects were detected. Results were arcsine squareroot transformed before analysis to correct for the nonnormal distribution of percentage values.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene silencing

Insects were observed at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168
h (pupae) after injection. Larvae in three states (before
death, still living and less vital) were randomly selected at
each time point and stored at -80°C for subsequent RNA
extraction. Total RNA was extracted from individual larvae using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenolchloroform method [61,62] and converted to cDNA using
AMV reverse transcriptase (Takara). The Hex-FP/Hex-RP
or SP1-FP/SP1-RP primers were used to amplify all three
cDNAs in the same PCR reactions. Pilot experiments
demonstrated that 22-24 cycles were optimal for linear
amplification of the PCR products, and this protocol was
then used in subsequent experiments. PCR amplification
was performed in a 25- μl reaction mixture under the following conditions: 10 min at 94°C; 22-24 cycles of 1 min
at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C and 1 min at 72°C; and a final 10
min at 72°C. The PCR products were separated on a 2%
agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane. Hybridization, washing and signal detection of the
blots were similar to methods previously described [59].
