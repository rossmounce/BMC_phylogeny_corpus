Abstract
Background: Analysis of the data available from traditional faunistic approaches to mollusc-trematode systems
covering large spatial and/or temporal scales in Europe convinced us that a parasite community approach in welldefined aquatic ecosystems is essential for the substantial advancement of our understanding of the parasite response
to anthropogenic pressures in urbanised areas which are typical on a European scale. Here we describe communities of
larval trematodes in two lymnaeid species, Radix auricularia and Lymnaea stagnalis in four man-made interconnected
reservoirs of the Ruhr River (Germany) focusing on among- and within-reservoir variations in parasite prevalence and
component community composition and structure.
Results: The mature reservoir system on the Ruhr River provides an excellent environment for the development of
species-rich and abundant trematode communities in Radix auricularia (12 species) and Lymnaea stagnalis (6 species).
The lake-adapted R. auricularia dominated numerically over L. stagnalis and played a major role in the trematode
transmission in the reservoir system. Both host-parasite systems were dominated by bird parasites (13 out of 15
species) characteristic for eutrophic water bodies. In addition to snail size, two environmental variables, the oxygen
content and pH of the water, were identified as important determinants of the probability of infection. Betweenreservoir comparisons indicated an advanced eutrophication at Baldeneysee and Hengsteysee and the small-scale
within-reservoir variations of component communities provided evidence that larval trematodes may have reflected
spatial bird aggregations (infection 'hot spots'). Two life history groupings of dominant species, the 'cyprinid' and
'anatid' parasites, that depict two aspects of progressive eutrophication in this mature reservoir system, were identified.
Conclusions: We conclude that trematode communities in the lake-adapted R. auricularia are better suited for
monitoring the effect of environmental change on host-parasite associations in the reservoir system on the Ruhr River
and other similar systems due to the important role of this host in trematode transmission in lakes. Whereas variations
in trematode community diversity and abundance may indicate the degree of eutrophication on a larger scale (among
reservoirs), the infection rates of the two life history groups of dominant species, the 'cyprinid' and 'anatid'
assemblages, may be particularly useful in depicting environmental variability, eutrophication effects and infection 'hot
spots' on smaller spatial scales.
Background
Snail-trematode systems have long been the focus of
medical, evolutionary and ecological research, the latter
resulting in a large body of literature on factors structuring trematode communities (reviewed in [1,2]). A com* Correspondence: bernd.sures@uni-due.de

munity of sometimes phylogenetically distant larval
trematodes in a snail host provides indication of coevolved host-parasite compatibility and trophic links at
different levels within an ecosystem. Since trematode
communities in snails reflect the richness and abundance
of free-living assemblages [3] they may appear good indicators of ecosystem health and anthropogenic pressure
(see e.g. [4] and references therein). However, the community line of research depends on taxonomic expertise
and the availability of information on trematode life-

cycles which are highly diverse, especially in freshwater
systems.
Research on trematode life-cycles originated in Germany with the remarkable works of Nitzsch [5], La Valette [6] and Lühe [7] and has flourished in the last century
yielding knowledge on more than 177 species whose
freshwater life-cycles can be completed in the country
(see references in Faltýnková & Haas [8]). In spite of the
vast amount of life-cycle data, only two surveys have been
conducted since the 1970's dealing with trematode distribution in Germany. Loy & Haas [9] observed no change
in the prevalence of larval parasites in Lymnaea stagnalis
(L.) over 20 years and Faltýnková & Haas [8] revealed a
diverse larval trematode fauna in molluscs (31 species)
and the same spectrum of the "typical" for Central Europe
species as that observed some 100-150 years ago by La
Valette [6] and Lühe [7]. Both studies were predominantly carried out on old fishponds existing in the area
for centuries and included the ponds of the Aischgrund
lowland near Erlangen encompassing a nearly 200 ha natural reserve area hosting an exceptionally rich and abundant avian fauna (more than 250 species, [10]). Further,
both studies report data from pooled either long-term
(over 20 years) sampling of a single mollusc species [9] or
short-term opportunistic collection of a wide array of
hosts in a range of habitats in the south of Germany
(Bavaria) [8]. The high diversity and stability of the trematode fauna in molluscs revealed by these authors may
therefore, reflect the maturity and stability of the ecosystems studied in the south of Germany or the nature of the
traditional faunistic approach to summarising data over
time and space. However, studies at the community level
associated with well-defined aquatic ecosystems in Germany that would help test these suggestions are still lacking. A parasite community approach would not only
substantially advance our understanding of the parasite
diversity in undisturbed freshwater habitats but would be
essential for the assessment of parasite response to
anthropogenic pressures in urbanised areas which are
typical on a European scale.
The creation of large freshwater impoundments is one
of the most dramatic anthropogenic impacts on both the
natural environment and wildlife parasite fauna [11]. The
responses of parasites to reservoir formation are not uniform both with respect to higher taxonomic groupings
and/or life-cycle strategies utilised, and the age of reservoir (see Morley [11] for an extensive review). However,
the majority of published data suggest that, in the longrun, the creation of dam reservoirs results in humaninduced facilitation of trematode life-cycles. Thus, water
resources development projects have led to increase in
the prevalence and outbreaks of human schistosomiasis
worldwide and are considered an important risk factor
for human health (reviewed in [12]) and large dam con-

structions in the former Soviet Union have caused severe
problems due to increased transmission of important fish
pathogens of the genus Diplostomum [13]. However,
analyses of how environmental change in mature reservoirs and mollusc-parasite systems are related, are still
lacking.
The Ruhr catchment area in western Germany is
emblematic, with the industrial pollution in the past and
the vast anthropogenic impact exerted by the dense population associated with a large number of waste-water
treatment plants in the catchment area. In this area the
Ruhr River Association (Ruhrverband) has been running
a complex water reservoir system for nearly a century
which comprises a number of water structures, mostly
dams and weirs, built on the Ruhr River and its tributaries which regulate the water system. A reservoir system
affects the river flow making backwater influences inevitable and induces variability in hydrological conditions
causing alterations in aquatic communities which, in
turn, may affect levels of parasitism in potential available
hosts.
This paper is the first to apply a community approach
to the diversity of larval parasites in two species of lymnaeid snail, Radix auricularia (L.) and L. stagnalis in Germany and, to the best of our knowledge, in aquatic
habitats of Central Europe. It is based on sampling in four
mature (30-80 year-old) interconnected reservoirs of the
Ruhr River, North Rhine-Westphalia, where these snails
appear to be the predominant element of the molluscan
fauna. We characterise the larval trematode fauna at the
reservoir level and focus on small-scale among and
within-reservoir variations in parasite prevalence and
component community composition and structure, using
distinct representative samples of both hosts.

Methods

Molluscs were sampled at four out of the five artificial
reservoirs on the river Ruhr: Hengsteysee, Harkortsee,
Kemnader See and Baldeneysee (see map in Fig. 1 and
Table 1 for details). Baldeneysee is the largest of the four,

noticeably longer and with more than double the volume
of the other reservoirs which are of similar size (Table 1).
All reservoirs were constructed (three as early as the
1930's) as deposit reservoirs of sediments from the
inflowing rivers Lenne and Volme and natural water purification. With the construction and development of more
effective sewage treatment plants along the Ruhr the initial function of water purification has become secondary;
currently the reservoirs of the Ruhr River serve for drinking water and hydropower supply and recreation. The
shallow nature of these water bodies has gradually
resulted in volume loss due to the deposition and accumulation of sediments. As a restoration measure, sediment removal has been carried out in all reservoirs
except Kemnader See during the last 20 years [14].
Six run-of-the-river hydroelectric plants operate in the
section of the Ruhr between the four reservoirs and one
pumped-storage hydropower plant is operating at Hengsteysee. Power plant operation results in regular variations in the reservoirs' surface elevation associated with
pumping and generation (e.g. of 0.5-0.7 m in Hengsteysee
which serves as the lower reservoir of the pumped-storage hydropower plant, [14]); the inflow of warmer water
into the post-dam reservoirs is another factor that may
introduce changes of aquatic communities.
One setback associated with the shallowness of the reservoirs is the excessive growth of aquatic plants, a problem existing since the 1930's. Of particular recent
concern is the mass development of the invasive macrophyte Elodea nuttallii (Planch.), native to North America
which is the most widespread alien aquatic plant species
in North Rhine-Westphalia causing problems in many
lakes by covering almost the total water body and forming dense mats up to the water surface. Since its first mass
occurrence in Harkotsee in 1994, massive infestations
occurred in this reservoir in summer of 2000 and spread
in the adjacent Hengsteysee and Kemnader See in the following years so that large surface areas were covered by
macrophytes in summer (e.g. > 50% of the surface area,
Hengsteysee; > 45%, Harkortsee; > 30%, Kemnader See,
observed in aerial surveys in 2005; after a recession in
2006 and 2007 large surface areas of the reservoirs were
infested again in 2008, see [14]). Although local patches
of E. nuttallii were first observed in 2006, mass development of this waterweed has not yet occurred in Baldeneysee to the same extend as in the other reservoirs perhaps
due to the higher turbidity caused by phytoplankton in
this reservoir. However, large scale infestations were
observed in this reservoir in 2008, with more than 13% of
its surface covered by E. nuttallii [15].
The study area provides suitable habitats for a range of
waterfowl, with many birds overwintering on the reservoirs. The spread of E. nuttallii may have contributed to
providing abundant food source for plant-grazing birds

such as swans, coots and mallards which have colonized
the reservoirs [14]. Moreover the bird sanctuary Heisingen at Baldeneysee (Vogelschutzgebiet Heisinger Bogen)
offers a protective environment for both fish-eating (e.g.
Phalacrocorax carbo, Larus ridibundus, Podiceps cristatus, Tachybaptus ruficollis, Ardea cinerea, Alcedo atthis)
and plant-grazing birds (e.g. Cygnus olor, Fulica atra,
Anas platyrhynchos, Branta canadensis, Alopochen
aegyptiacus) amongst others. Although no planned bird
counts were carried out during our study, all these species
were registered and documented in a visit to the sampling
sites (see Table 1 for semi-quantitative data and Additional file 1 for detailed maps of the sampling sites and
the areas of bird aggregations).
Data collection

A total of 430 R. auricularia and 185 L. stagnalis was collected comprising 23 distinct snail samples (16 and 7,
respectively) at different sites of the four reservoirs
(labelled in the maps in Additional file 1). Snails were collected with hand-nets in the aquatic vegetation or picked
by hand on stones along the shore of the reservoirs during 7 sampling trips in September-October 2009. The
main bulk of samples was collected on 23 September (5
samples of R. auricularia and 2 of L. stagnalis) and 26
September (3 samples R. auricularia and 4 of L. stagnalis). Two samples of R. auricularia were collected on 5, 8
and 22 October; one sample on 12 and 19 October; and
one sample of L. stagnalis was collected on 8 October.
Although sampling was not quantitative, the sample
sizes (range 8-76) reflected the abundance of both hosts
at the sampling sites. To reduce the bias due to small sample size we used only samples comprising more than 20
snails for quantitative comparisons (hereafter referred to
as reduced dataset, a total of 13 samples comprising 323
R. auricularia and 132 L. stagnalis, thus representing 75%
and 71% of the total samples, respectively, see breakdown
by reservoir in Table 1). Snails were measured, labelled,
placed in individual containers with dechlorinated tap
water under a light source and screened for patent infections (i.e. cercarial emission) within 48 h after their transfer to the laboratory. Cercariae were identified alive using
the keys of Faltýnková et al. [16,17] and other relevant
primary sources [18,19]. Samples of selected species were
fixed in molecular grade ethanol for DNA isolation and
sequencing.
During each sampling trip the water temperature (°C),
and three water quality parameters were measured at
each site: dissolved oxygen concentration (mg/L) measured with Oxi 1970i, Wissenschaftlich-Technische
Werkstätten GmbH, Weilheim, Germany (WTW); pH
(measured with pH 320, WTW) and conductivity (°S/cm)
(measured with Cond 315i; WTW). All measurements
were taken at a depth of approximately 0.5-0.7 m at 1-2 m

distance from the shore (ranges for multiple sites at each
reservoir provided in Table 1).
Data analysis

The effect on the probability of infection of snail size, reservoir of origin and the natural environmental variables
measured at each site was assessed by a backward stepwise logistic regression (generalized linear models custom design with binomial distribution and logit link
function in Statistica v.6, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA)
for both snail hosts. The dependent binomial variable
"infection" was coded 0 (uninfected) and 1 (infected); one
categorical ("reservoir" coded 1-4) and five continuous
("snail size","dissolved oxygen concentration", "temperature", "conductivity", and "pH") variables were used as
covariates. Cases with missing data (e.g. 21 "large"
infected R. auricularia of the first sampling died and were
accidentally discarded without measuring) were excluded
from regression analysis. This resulted in the lack of
infected snails in the data for Harkortsee; regression for
R. auricularia was, therefore, carried out for three of the
reservoirs.
Species with prevalence higher than 10.0% in at least
one community of the reduced dataset (i.e. sample size >
20) were considered dominant. Variations in levels of
infection (the overall prevalence of larval trematode
infection and the prevalences of the dominant species) of
both snail hosts at the reservoir level were examined by
contrasting pooled data across all of the sampling sites
within a reservoir. At the component community level,
only the data from distinct samples (n > 20 snails) within
reservoirs were used. Assessment of intra-reservoir variability of larval communities was thus restricted to
Baldeneysee (both hosts) and Hengsteysee (R. auricularia only; see Table 1 for details). Parasite prevalences
were compared using Fisher's exact test in Quantitative
Parasitology 3.0 [20]. Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlataions) were carried out with
Statistica v.6. Component community composition analyses [non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) ordination and randomization tests on similarity matrices
(ANOSIM); both based on Bray-Curtis index values]
were carried out with PRIMER v6 software [21].

Results
Snail populations and natural environmental variables

Snail populations of R. auricularia were markedly more
abundant at Baldeneysee and Hengsteysee whereas those
of L. stagnalis had higher density at the former only
(Table 1). Mean snail size ranged from 11.9 to 19.1 mm
for R. auricularia and between 31.3 mm and 38.9 mm for
L. stagnalis. The sample size for the latter species only
was strongly correlated with the water temperature at the
time of sampling (rs = 0.772, p < 0.05) whereas the size of

Page 5 of 13

the samples of R. auricularia exhibited a significant association with water pH (rs = 0.456, p <0.05). These correlations did not hold when tests were carried out on the
reduced dataset of distinct samples considered for further
quantitative comparisons.
Overall, natural environmental parameters varied
within overlapping ranges among reservoirs (Table 1).
Water temperature ranged between 9.3°C and 18.6°C
depending on the day and time of collection. The hydrogen ion concentration was within the range providing
protection for the aquatic life (6.0 to 9.0). The concentration of dissolved oxygen showed generally high (> 7.0 mg/
L) levels and exhibited a strong negative association with
water conductivity (rs = -0.665, p < 0.05). There were significant differences between reservoirs with respect to
oxygen concentration only (Kruskal-Wallis H(3,19) = 8.80,
p = 0.032) with highest levels observed at Hengsteysee
(Table 1). Conductivity varied within the range normally
found within the Ruhr catchment area.
Larval communities in Radix auricularia

A total of 20.9% of all collected R. auricularia had patent
larval trematode infections. Snail populations were very
abundant in Hengsteysee and Baldeneysee where the
overall prevalence of infection was notably high (28.2 and
18.3%, respectively, Table 2). This contrasted with the
very low population density and overall prevalence
recorded at Harkortsee and Kemnader See (4.6%).
Although sample sizes varied between sites (20-76 snails)
no significant correlation with the prevalence of infection
was detected.
R. auricularia in the Ruhr River reservoirs was infected
with 12 species of trematodes, nearly half belonging to
the family Echinostomatidae (five species including a new
species of Echinostoma of the "revolutum" group detected
by molecular methods, Kostadinova, unpublished data).
The other seven species represent six families: Diplostomidae (2 species) and Notocotylidae, Plagiorchiidae,
Schistosomatidae, Strigeidae and Telochiidae (1 species
each; see Table 2). Three double infections were found:
Diplostomum spathaceum - Echinostoma sp. (one snail
from Hengsteysee, sample He2); D. spathaceum - Paryphostomum radiatum (one snail from Hengsteysee, sample He3b) and D. spathaceum - Opisthioglyphe ranae (one
snail from Kemnader See, sample K1a). Six of the trematodes parasitising R. auricularia complete their lifecycles in anatid birds, three species require fish-eating
birds as definitive hosts, one matures in small mammals,
one in amphibians and one in a wide range of birds (final
host groups broadly defined in Table 2). Faunal richness
of trematodes in R. auricularia followed the spatial pattern of overall infection with 11 species at Hengsteysee
and seven species at Baldeneysee, whereas only two and

Component communities in R. auricularia comprised
of 1-7 species and were dominated by 1-3 species. Overall, five species (marked with a star in Table 2; four maturing in birds) were considered dominant. It is worth noting

of cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch), was detected at
Baldeneysee and Hengsteysee, exhibiting a high prevalence in the latter (Tables 2-3).
Larval communities in Lymnaea stagnalis

The overall prevalence of patent larval trematode infections in L. stagnalis was slightly lower than that for R.
auricularia (15.1%). Snail populations were abundant
only in Baldeneysee which is reflected in the larger number of samples available for quantitative comparisons (2251 snails, see Table 1); sample size and the prevalence of
infection were not correlated. Overall prevalence of
infection was high at Harkortsee and Kemnader See (21.7
and 18.8%, respectively) and somewhat lower at
Baldeneysee and Hengsteysee (14.1 and 9.1%, respectively, Table 2).
L. stagnalis in the Ruhr River reservoirs was infected
with six trematode species of five families: two species of
the family Echinostomatidae and one species each of the
families Diplostomidae, Plagiorchiidae, Schistosomatidae and Telorchiidae (Table 2). L. stagnalis shared three
species with R. auricularia (Echinoparyphium recurvatum, O. ranae and Plagiorchis elegans; the former two
identified as dominant in trematode communities in R.
auricularia). Three of the species infecting L. stagnalis
complete their life-cycles in a wide range of anatids, one
species requires fish-eating birds as definitive hosts, one
matures in amphibians, and one in a wide range of birds
(final host groups broadly defined in Table 2). Trichobilharzia szidati, another species known to cause cercarial
dermatitis (swimmer's itch), was detected at Baldeneysee

although with a moderate prevalence (Table 2). The trematode fauna was relatively species-rich at Baldeneysee
(five species) in contrast to the rest of the water bodies
studied (one and two species).
Component communities in L. stagnalis were speciespoor (1-2 species) and were occasionally dominated by a
single species, D. pseudospathaceum (single community
at Harkortsee). This species was the only parasite of L.
stagnalis found in snail samples from all four reservoirs.
Between-reservoir patterns of variation in infection

We used the data from the pooled samples by reservoir in
order to compare distributional patterns of the larval
trematodes among reservoirs for each host species. There
were significant differences between reservoirs with
respect to the overall prevalence of infection of R. auricularia and the prevalence of three of the five dominant
species which were present and/or exhibiting higher
infection levels at Baldeneysee and Hengsteysee in concordance with the distinctly higher richness recorded at
these water bodies (Table 2). Of the dominant species,
only D. spathaceum had a wider distribution among reservoirs (present in three, dominant in one community at
Hengsteysee). There was a significant positive correlation
between the overall prevalence of infection and two environmental variables (dissolved oxygen concentration, rs =
0.591; and pH, rs = 0.423, both p > 0.05; however, the latter was not significant for the reduced dataset).
In contrast, the overall prevalence of infection in L.
stagnalis did not show significant variation between reservoirs and was not correlated with any of the environmental variables measured. The only dominant species in
this host, D. pseudospathaceum, was found in all four
water bodies and with a significantly higher prevalence
and dominating communities sampled at Harkortsee and
Kemnader See (Table 2).
The overall probability of infection was strongly dependent on snail size and exhibited a significant association

auricularia (n = 354) and Lymnaea stagnalis (n = 171) in the four reservoirs of the Ruhr River.

with the levels of dissolved oxygen and pH for both species datasets whereas the temperature at the time of sampling appears to have significantly influenced the
collection of infected R. auricularia only (Table 3). Reservoir of origin and water conductivity did not exhibit significant association with the probability of infection of
both hosts.
Within-reservoir patterns of variation in infection

Unequal snail density among the studied water bodies
affected not only species richness and the distribution of
the dominant species as indicated above, but also limited
the possibility for assessment of small-scale variations at
the component community level, especially for L. stagnalis. To achieve this we used data for a total of eight component communities in R. auricularia from Baldeneysee
(three sites, one sampled twice) and Hengsteysee (four
sites) and three communities in L. stagnalis from
Baldeneysee.
Component communities in R. auricularia exhibited a
contrasting pattern of variation in the two reservoirs
under comparison with low (one species) to moderate
species richness (site B3, 3-4 species, see map in Additional file 1) and similar overall infection levels and distributions of the dominant species (with the exception of O.
ranae found only at the second sampling of site B3, Table
3) at Baldeneysee. On the other hand, although a single
species was found at two sites each at Hengsteysee, communities at sites He2 and He3 were both species-rich (7
species, see map in Additional file 1). This richness was
associated with substantially higher overall levels of
infection and significant differences in the distributions
of the dominant species (except O. ranae not recorded in
this reservoir, Table 4). Communities sampled at Hengsteysee also exhibited a much lower predictability (mean
similarity based on species presence/absence of 9.8 vs
31.5% at Baldeneysee).
The mean similarity between species-poor communities in L. stagnalis at Baldeneysee was similar to that for
R. auricularia from the same reservoir (36.5%). No significant differences were detected in the overall prevalence
or the distribution of the dominant species, D. pseudospathaceum, which showed moderate prevalences at
sites B1 and B3 (see map in Additional file 1 and Table 4).
Community structure

The MDS ordination plot of component communities in
the two hosts comprising the reduced dataset in Fig. 2A
(stress value 0.02) illustrates the significant compartmentalization of community composition by host species
(ANOSIM R = 0.522, p = 0.001). There was a higher overall variation of communities in R. auricularia which,
however, could not be consistently related to the reservoir
of origin. In an attempt to increase the representation

Page 8 of 13

from the two reservoirs with lower density of R. auricularia, Harkortsee and Kemnader See, we included all
samples of more than 10 snails. The result of the ANOSIM test although significant for the factor "reservoir"
(but with low R = 0.253, p = 0.044), was rather due to the
somewhat isolated position of the single community from
Harkortsee and the similar composition of the two communities from Kemnader See. On the other hand, communities from the two reservoirs with high density of R.
auricularia exhibited a wider range of variations as illustrated in the MDS plot (Fig. 2B).

Discussion
The results of our study demonstrate that the mature reservoir system on the Ruhr River in the west of Germany
provides an excellent environment for the development
of species-rich and abundant trematode communities in
the first intermediate hosts and this was in line with our
expectations based on bird abundance. The purely faunistic by-product is nevertheless striking since the total of 15
species of trematodes we detected as a result of a limited
sampling of the two mollusc hosts represents half the
diversity registered by Faltýnková & Haas [8] in more
than 6,000 molluscs belonging to 28 species studied in
the southeast of Germany. Furthermore, the faunal richness we observed in the four Ruhr River reservoirs is similar to the 17 species recorded by these authors in the
Aischgrund lowland area. Although their data are pooled
among the 26 localities sampled and thus not directly
comparable to our results based on distinct snail population samples, another remarkable difference is worth noting. Faltýnková & Haas [8] registered a poorer trematode
fauna in R. auricularia compared with L. stagnalis (4 vs
10 species). Faltýnková [22] and Żbikowska [23] reported
a similar relationship (3 vs 10 spp. and 1 vs 13 spp.,
respectively) in small fish ponds near Ceske Budejovice
(Czech Republic) and a variety of water bodies in Poland.
On the contrary, we observed the reverse faunal richness:
12 vs 6 species in R. auricularia and L. stagnalis, respectively. These data tend to support the hypothesis of
Wesenberg-Lund [24] that in lakes R. auricularia plays a
role in the life-cycles of trematodes similar to that of L.
stagnalis in ponds. In contrast to Wesenberg-Lund's suggestion, Adam & Lewis [25] reported high trematode
richness (11 spp.) in a population of R. auricularia during
the process of its colonisation of a gravel-pit near
Wraysbury (UK), whereas the sparse populations of L.
stagnalis studied in the same area were uninfected. However, the sample sizes of the two snail hosts were not
comparable.
Concerning the rates of infection, although data for
Asian populations of R. auricularia indicate that parasitism may affect large proportions of the snail population
(e.g. overall prevalence 18.2% at Lam Tsuen River, Hong

Kong [26]), surprisingly little is known for levels of larval
parasitism in European populations of this snail host.
Adam & Lewis' [25] study depicting prevalence patterns
in R. auricularia over three years in a single snail population appears so far unique. Notably, their data show high
monthly prevalences (typically above 20%) occasionally
peaking up to c. 60% (in at least three out of 11 distinct
monthly samples, estimated from Figure 1 in Adam &

Lewis [25]) in association with the high prevalence of the
bird parasite E. recurvatum (> 30%). Although overall
prevalences observed in communities in R. auricularia in
the Ruhr reservoirs showed a wider range of variation
there were important infection foci, e.g. sites B3, He2 and
He3, the latter two showing extremely high infection
rates. In contrast, the overall prevalences in L. stagnalis
(max. 14%) were low compared with those for both R.

auricularia ([25]; this study) and communities of L. stagnalis studied in the same season in two small fishponds in
the Czech Republic (up to 53 and 65%, Kostadinova,
unpublished data). Thus, our data tend to support the
"reverse role" hypothesis of Wesenberg-Lund [24] for the
two snail hosts in lakes.
There were clear differences in snail population densities associated with reservoir characteristics. Thus the
'large-lake adapted' species R. auricularia dominated
over L. stagnalis especially at Hengsteysee where the
macrophyte cover at the sampling sites was poor and all
R. auricularia were found aggregated on stones. The
spread and abundance of R. auricularia in the studied
reservoir system could also be related to the fact that
Radix spp. in general can withstand severe water fluctuation [27]. Interestingly, L. stagnalis is considered a "calciphile species" not normally found reproducing in waters
with less than 20 mg/L calcium [27]. This sensitivity to
external calcium concentration can explain the distinctly
higher density of this species at Baldeneysee which is
characterised by highest mean calcium content of the
sediments (10.5 mg/kg vs slightly above 4.0 mg/kg at

Page 10 of 13

Hengsteysee and less than 4.0 mg/kg in the other two reservoirs [14]) and the higher abundance of the more "softwater" R. auricularia at Hengsteysee. Further, although
all studied reservoirs show backwater effects as evidenced by the perpetual removal of sediment deposits
during the last 20 years, Baldeneysee is characterised by
the lowest water flow velocity both in spring and summer
(0.07 and 0 m/s, respectively [14]), thus providing a range
of lentic habitats suitable for L. stagnalis.
Our ability to detect parasites with low prevalence
decreases at low population densities since sample sizes
also decrease and this is particularly true for mollusc-parasite systems characterised by a remarkable consistency
in prevalences (usually within the 5-10% range, see Esch
et al. [2]). Although this has inevitably affected our observations, we believe that infection levels may well have
reflected real variation among the Ruhr reservoirs and
the logistic regression results tend to support this. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first study relating environmental variables with the outcomes of trematode
transmission at the level of individual snails in a natural
setting. In fact, studies on the impact on the survival and
infectivity of parasite transmission stages of environmental variables have rarely been undertaken in laboratory
and then only in the case of a few trematodes (reviewed
by Pietrock & Marcogliese [28]). In addition to the wellknown strong association between infection and snail
size (reviewed in [29]), our results indicate that oxygen
content may play an important role for trematode survival and/or infectivity especially in areas with poor water
column oxygen conditions (e.g. L. stagnalis dataset, predominantly sampled at Baldeneysee) and, therefore, be of
importance for the distribution of larval trematode infections among reservoirs which differed significantly with
respect to this environmental variable. The strong correlation between oxygen content and conductivity explains
the exclusion of the latter variable from the models. Further, although hydrogen ion concentration varied within
a narrow range, pH was also identified as an important
factor with a negative effect on the probability of infection.
We expected a substantial homogenisation of trematode distribution accross reservoirs which would reflect
an even distribution of the limited number of bird species
at the relatively small spatial scale of the study (Table 1,
Additional file 1). However, we observed at Baldeneysee
and Hengsteysee, in addition to differential snail densities, the highest trematode richness and this was in sharp
contrast with the other two reservoirs. Trematode diversity and prevalence are directly associated with bird
diversity and abundance (e.g. [30-32]) and both bird species richness and maximum densities increase with nutrient load [33]. Therefore, the diversity and composition of
larval trematodes in the bird-parasite dominated (87% of

Soldánová et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:56
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/56

all species and 83% of the dominant species) snail systems
studied by us appear to reflect an advanced eutrophication at Baldeneysee and Hengsteysee in line with the predictions for parasites in eutrophic water bodies in the
classical study of Wisniewski [34]. In support of our findings, Podraza et al. [14] considered the total phosphorus
content of the sediments of Hengsteysee characteristic
for eutrophic lakes and recorded more than twice as high
levels at Baldeneysee. Furthermore, the two infection foci
at Hengsteysee are located in a shallow stagnant bay (sites
He2 and He3, see map in Additional file 1) affected predominantly by the inflow from the Lenne River which
includes the inflow from a nearby wastewater treatment
plant of a paper mill.
However, the two snail-trematode systems depicted different prevalence patterns among reservoirs. The sharp
differences in the overall prevalence and the prevalence
of three out of five dominant species in R. auricularia
were in contrast with the more homogeneous overall
prevalence between reservoirs in L. stagnalis. The pattern
observed in the latter host-parasite system is probably
associated with the substantially lower overall trematode
richness and the higher prevalence of the only dominant
species, D. pseudospathaceum in Harkortsee and Kemnader See. In spite of the variability observed, the domination of parasites maturing in birds with respect to both
richness and prevalence, is a common feature of the two
snail-trematode systems studied in the Ruhr reservoirs.
Although we have selected a very high threshold prevalence value for dominance status, the number of dominant species appears unprecedented in view of the
typically low prevalences of larval trematodes in molluscs
[1].
Remarkably, the life-histories of five out of the six dominant species appear to depict two aspects of progressive
eutrophication in this mature reservoir system. First, the
relatively homogenous prevalences of the two Diplostomum spp. completing their life-cycles in gulls and the
specific parasite of cormorants P. radiatum, indicate
increased densities of their most suitable intermediate
hosts, cyprinids, which are characteristic for eutrophic
conditions. Although no records are available for P.
radiatum, increased infections of Diplostomum spp. in
fish were related to progressive eutrophication in the
Lake Constance (Germany) [35]. The rates of infection
with the three species associated with cyprinids and fisheating birds in the Ruhr reservoirs studied are within the
upper ranges reported so far (typically from pond systems; see [9,21,36,37]).
The high infection rates of the second group of dominant species, E. recurvatum and T. franki, which mature
in anatid birds, suggest parasite proliferation associated
with another aspect of lake eutrophication, i.e. the domi-

Page 11 of 13

nance of anatids and Anas platyrhynchos in particular
[34]. High eutrophication of water reservoirs, accompanied by colonisation by snails and nesting ducks, is considered as one of the most important factors for the
increase of outbreaks of cercarial dermatitis worldwide
[38,39]. Although Trichobilharzia spp. infection rates in
lymnaeids are typically low, ranging between 0.3 and 5.2%
in Europe [9], two of the most diverse sites in our study
were also important foci of T. franki showing prevalences
as high as the maxima recorded (22% and 26% in the
Czech Republic [40] and South Germany [41], respectively). It has been suggested that these high infection
rates may have resulted from disturbances in the ecological balance of the lakes leading to increased snail densities [39,42] and our data tend to support this. An added
factor in our system is the presence of dense mats of E.
nuttallii on water surface attracting large numbers of
plant-grazing anatids and cyprinids and thus facilitating
trematode transmission (see bird aggregations outlined in
Additional file 1). It is worth noting that cases of cercarial
dermatitis have been recorded at Hengsteysee.
One important result of our study is that component
community composition and structure provided evidence
that larval trematodes in R. auricularia, and to a much
lesser degree in L. stagnalis, may have reflected spatial
bird aggregations on the small-scale within-reservoir
study especially with respect to the focal occurrence of
parasites. Thus, at least three foci exist in Baldeneysee
and Hengsteysee that support diverse communities
involving up to four different groups of vertebrate final
hosts (Table 4). The small-scale patterns of variation of
component communities in the two snail hosts also indicated differentiation between host-parasite associations
in the two study reservoirs. Thus, infection levels in both
snail hosts from Baldeneysee were somewhat homogenous and this was in contrast with the substantial variation in communities in R. auricularia at Hengsteysee;
unfortunately no representative samples were available
for L. stagnalis from the latter. One possible explanation
is that the larger size of Baldeneysee levels down the environmental instability e.g. water level and temperature
variation which is significant at Hengsteysee as it serves
as a lower reservoir for a pumped-storage hydropower
plant. The bird sanctuary Heisingen at Baldeneysee also
supports important numbers of breeding birds. These
factors in combination may tend to homogenise trematode communities in molluscs. We are tempted to suggest
that the contrasting patterns of variation in communities
in R. auricularia may be associated with the more
advanced eutrophication at Baldeneysee thus offerring
support for another insightful prediction of Wisniewski
[34]i.e. that the distribution of hosts and parasites in an
eutrophic water body "leads, as a rule, to the possibility of

Soldánová et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:56
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/56

the hosts being invaded in the same degree at all points at
the lake". A wider small-scale sampling at the four Ruhr
reservoirs would be influential in testing this prediction.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we suggest that trematode communities in
the lake-adapted R. auricularia are better suited for monitoring the effect of environmental change on host-parasite associations in the mature reservoir system on the
Ruhr River and other similar systems due to the high density of this host and its important role in trematode transmission in lakes. Whereas variations in trematode
community diversity and abundance may indicate the
degree of eutrophication on a larger scale (among reservoirs), the infection rates of the two life history groups of
dominant species, the 'cyprinid' and 'anatid' assemblages,
may be particularly useful in depicting environmental
variability, eutrophication effects and infection 'hot spots'
on smaller spatial scales.
