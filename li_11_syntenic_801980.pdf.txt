Abstract
Background: Cucumber, Cucumis sativus L. (2n = 2 × = 14) and melon, C. melo L. (2n = 2 × = 24) are two
important vegetable species in the genus Cucumis (family Cucurbitaceae). Both species have an Asian origin that
diverged approximately nine million years ago. Cucumber is believed to have evolved from melon through
chromosome fusion, but the details of this process are largely unknown. In this study, comparative genetic
mapping between cucumber and melon was conducted to examine syntenic relationships of their
chromosomes.
Results: Using two melon mapping populations, 154 and 127 cucumber SSR markers were added onto previously
reported F2- and RIL-based genetic maps, respectively. A consensus melon linkage map was developed through
map integration, which contained 401 co-dominant markers in 12 linkage groups including 199 markers derived
from the cucumber genome. Syntenic relationships between melon and cucumber chromosomes were inferred
based on associations between markers on the consensus melon map and cucumber draft genome scaffolds. It
was determined that cucumber Chromosome 7 was syntenic to melon Chromosome I. Cucumber Chromosomes 2
and 6 each contained genomic regions that were syntenic with melon chromosomes III+V+XI and III+VIII+XI,
respectively. Likewise, cucumber Chromosomes 1, 3, 4, and 5 each was syntenic with genomic regions of two
melon chromosomes previously designated as II+XII, IV+VI, VII+VIII, and IX+X, respectively. However, the marker
orders in several syntenic blocks on these consensus linkage maps were not co-linear suggesting that more
complicated structural changes beyond simple chromosome fusion events have occurred during the evolution of
cucumber.
Conclusions: Comparative mapping conducted herein supported the hypothesis that cucumber chromosomes
may be the result of chromosome fusion from a 24-chromosome progenitor species. Except for a possible
inversion, cucumber Chromosome 7 has largely remained intact in the past nine million years since its divergence
from melon. Meanwhile, many structural changes may have occurred during the evolution of the remaining six
cucumber chromosomes. Further characterization of the genomic nature of Cucumis species closely related to
cucumber and melon might provide a better understanding of the evolutionary history leading to modern
cucumber.

Background
The genus Cucumis (family Cucurbitaceae) includes two
economically important vegetable crop species that are
cultivated worldwide: cucumber (C. sativus L., 2n = 2 ×
= 14) and melon (C. melo L., 2n = 2 × = 24). The
genetic, phylogenetic, and evolutionary relationships of
cucumber and melon have been the subject of much
research. The genus Cucumis initially contained 32 species that was divided into two subgenera, Melo and
Cucumis [1]. While the subgenus Melo is centered in
Africa with 30 species including melon (all of which
have 2n = 24 chromosomes), the subgenus Cucumis is
of Asian origin and includes the cultivated cucumber C.
sativus and its wild relative C. hystrix Char. (2n = 2 × =
24). Although C. melo is considered the most morphologically diverse species in Cucumis [1,2], two inter-fertile
botanical varieties (2n = 2 × = 14), the cultivated C.
sativus var. sativus L. and the wild C. sativus var. hardwickii (Royle) Alef., comprise the primary gene pool of
cucumber. This gene pool has a rather narrow genetic
base as evidenced in various genetic diversity studies
[3-6]. No interspecific hybrids between melon and
cucumber have been reported due to their sexual
incompatibility [7].
The genus Cucumis has undergone considerable revision in recent years. For instance, molecular phylogenetic studies indicated that the genera such as
Cucumella, Mukia, Dicaelospermum, Myrmecosicyos,
and Oreosyce possess genetic affinities with Cucumis
species resulting in their inclusion in Cucumis in more
recent taxonomic treatments [8-10]. The genus Cucumis
in the newest treatment contains 52 species, which are
grouped into two subgenera: Humifructus (two species,
C. humifructus and C. hirsutus) and Cucumis (consisting
of the remaining 50 species) [9,11]. In addition, both
melon and cucumber are believed to be of Asian origin,
which were derived from a common ancestor approximately nine million years ago [12].
The genome size of melon (12 chromosome pairs) is
estimated to be 454 Mb, and cucumber (7 chromosome
pairs) has a genome size of 367 Mbp [13]. The evolutionary relationship between melon and cucumber can
be investigated through chromosome analysis. In Kirkbride’s taxonomic assessment of Cucumis [2], subgenus
Cucumis is considered primitive and subgenus Melo was
hypothesized to have been derived from it through chromosomal fragmentation [14-16]. In contrast, cytological
investigations have also suggested that ancestral species
of subgenus Melo gave rise to subgenus Cucumis species
via chromosome fusion or non-homologous translocation [17,18]. However, Ramachandran and Seshadri [19]
argued that the two subgenera are not closely related
given differences in geographical distribution and

chromosome number, size, organization, and behavior.
More recent molecular-based phylogenetic analyses of
Cucumis support the hypothesis that the base chromosome number of x = 7 was achieved by chromosome
reduction from x = 12 progenitor species [8,10,12].
Despite their distinct phylogenetic relationships
[20,21], the genomes of melon and cucumber seem to
be highly conserved. Cross-species similarities based on
molecular marker transferability among cucurbit crops
are well documented. Neuhausen [20] first reported affinities among cucurbit species by identifying molecular
cross-hybridizations (i.e., signals) using RFLP probes.
More recently, Katzir et al. [21] and Danin-Poleg et al.
[22] defined specific genomic regions using SSR primer
products to reveal considerable sequence homologies
between cucumber and melon. Danin-Poleg et al. [23]
identified nine SSR markers shared between melon and
cucumber and proposed that their cucumber Linkage
Group B and melon Linkage Groups E and 2 were syntenic. Since 2000, molecular markers (primarily SSRs)
developed from melon have been used routinely in
cucumber genetic mapping studies or vice versa [24-37].
The high degree of synteny and conservation between
the melon and cucumber genomes has also been
demonstrated at the DNA sequence level (micro-synteny). Park et al. [38] and Meyer et al. [39] compared
genomic DNA flanking the zucchini yellow mosaic virus
resistance locus (zym) in melon and cucumber and
detected considerable marker colinearity between those
species. Alignment of melon BAC-end and BAC clone
(6.7 Mbp) sequences of melon against a cucumber draft
genome assembly (line Gy 14) revealed 90% homology
between the compared sequences [40,41]. Although
transposition activity was found to be low in cucumber,
it is comparatively high in melon [41]. Thus, it has been
postulated that the genomic size differences between
melon and cucumber is due mainly to the expansion of
inter-genic regions and proliferation of transposable elements in the melon genome [41].
Recently, whole genome sequencing in cucumber [42]
and the availability of large numbers of molecular markers [43] has made it possible to define more clearly the
syntenic relationships between cucumber and melon. By
alignment of 348 marker sequences mapped in the
melon genome onto the 9930 cucumber draft genome,
Huang et al. [42] found that there was no substantial
rearrangement between cucumber Chromosome 7 and
melon Chromosome I. In addition, the majority of
cucumber Chromosome 4 corresponded to melon Chromosome VII, and each of the remaining five cucumber
chromosomes was collinear to two melon chromosomes
[42]. The correspondance between melon and cucumber
chromosomes was also observed in a comparative

Li et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:396
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/396

mapping study by Fukino et al. [44], who placed 70
cucumber SSR markers on a melon linkage map.
Comparative genetic mapping is useful for revealing
syntenic relationships among closely related planted species [45,46]. An understanding of syntenic relationships
among species facilitates the investigation of genome
evolution and dynamics [47,48], and allows for the use
of genetic information among related species in gene
isolation and molecular tagging experiments [49-51].
Comparative mapping has been used successfully to
define syntenic relationships among closely related plant
species in the Solanaceae (pepper, tomato, and potato)
[52-55], Gramineae grasses [56,57], Fabaceae legumes
[47,58-62], Brassicaceae [63], and Rosaceae (Prunun
spp) [64,65].
When compared to other crop species, genetic and
genomic resources in cucurbit crops have historically
been limited. However, this situation is changing rapidly.
For instance, the draft genomes of two cucumber inbred
lines (North China fresh market type 9930 and North
American pickling type Gy14) have been released
[42,66] (also Weng et al., unpublished data). A high
resolution linkage map and several SSR-based genetic
maps have been developed for this species [43,67-69]. In
melon, many linkage maps as well as a BAC-based physical map have been constructed [24,27-29,33-37]. In
addition, comparative fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) mapping in cucumber and melon [70] suggested
that centromere repositioning occurred during the evolution of cucumber chromosomes. Several cucumber
chromosomes have been anchored using fosmid clones,
and karyotypes of cucumber and melon genomes have
been developed [71-75].
Previous studies [38-44] have shown that genomic
synteny and co-linearity exists between cucumber and
melon. This information is, nevertheless, fragmented
and incomplete. Thus experiments were designed herein
for large-scale comparative genetic mapping of melon
and cucumber to identify syntenic blocks using microsatellite markers. To accomplish this objective, two
extended linkage maps in melon were constructed using
an F2 and a RIL population, which were subsequently
merged to form a consensus map. Then the scaffolds of
the Gy14 and 9930 cucumber draft genomes were associated to markers on both the melon consensus map
and a high-resolution cucumber genetic map [43] to
define species chromosomes and allow for the detection
of syntenic blocks.

Results
1. Development of an F2-based extended melon linkage
map using cucumber SSRs

In total, 2,487 SSR markers were used to screen for
polymorphisms between the two parental lines, Q3-2-2

Page 3 of 14

and Top Mark of the F2 mapping population. Of these,
2,442 were genomic SSRs developed from cucumber, 21
from watermelon, 14 from melon [28,29,31], and 10
were EST-SSRs from other species [29]. Of the 2,442
cucumber SSRs, 1,123 (45.9%) produced amplicons in
melon after PCR, from which 187 (16.7%) were polymorphic between Top Mark and Q3-2-2. The success in
marker transferability for all cucumber SSRs tested was
7.7% (187/2,442). Of the 21 watermelon genomic SSRs
that produced amplicons in cucumber (data not presented), seven (33.3%) produced amplicons in melon,
and two were polymorphic (2/21 = 9.5%). In total, 196
non-melon polymorphic markers were identified (187
from cucumber, 2 from watermelon, and 7 from other
species) and 154 of them were finally placed on the F2
genetic map (145 from cucumber, 2 from watermelon
and 7 from other species).
Using this F2 mapping population, Cuevas et al. [35]
mapped 169 co-dominant markers (154 SSR, 8 CAPS,
and 7 SNP) in 13 linkage groups (LG). Genotypic data
from the 154 additional cucumber or watermelon markers developed herein were combined with the previously mapped 169 markers for linkage analysis. All
323 codominant markers (308 SSRs, 15 CAPS/SNP)
were placed onto this F2-based melon genetic map in
13 LG. Information on LG and map positions is presented in Table S1 (Additional File 1), and their associated statistics are presented in Table 1. Segregation
distortion was rare, where only four markers, CU2186,
GCM548, SSR05695, and UW085218 significantly
deviated from expected 1:2:1 segregation ratio (P <
0.01). Except for Chromosome IV, each LG could be
assigned to corresponding chromosomes as defined by
Liu et al. [74]. In our analysis, Chromosome IV was
split into two linkage groups (4A and 4B) (Table S1)
due to an insufficient number of markers. The F 2 based map consisted of 13 LG spanning 1,012 cM,
with a mean marker interval of 3.1 cM, where the largest gap resided in Chromosome IV associated with
LG 4A and LG 4B.
2. Development of a RIL-based extended melon linkage
map with cucumber SSRs

The molecular markers employed for F2 mapping were
also used to identify polymorphisms between Top Mark
and WI 846-1 of the RIL population. Of the 2,403
cucumber SSRs tested, 44.9% (1,080) produced amplicons in melon, where 11.1% (120/1080) of the SSRs
detected polymorphisms between Top Mark and WI
846-1 (5.9% when all 2,043 cucumber SSRs were considered). Of the 127 polymorphic markers identified herein
(i.e., 120 from cucumber, 6 from melon or Arabidopsis,
and 1 from watermelon), 89 were placed on the RIL
map.

Using the same melon RIL population, Cuevas et al.
[34] mapped 256 marker loci (105 SSR, 11 SNP/CAPS,
and 140 AFLP or RAPDs). The two sets of marker data
were pooled for linkage analysis using 80 RILs. Ten of
these markers could not be assigned to any LG. The
resulting linkage map possessed 335 marker loci including 203 codominant (SSR, CAPS, and SNP) and 132
dominant markers (103 RAPDs and 29 AFLPs) in 22 LG
with cumulative genetic distances of 879.1 cM. The
mapping data are presented in Table S2 (Additional File
1) and associated map statistics are shown in Table 1.
Based on SSR markers shared in common with previously published melon maps [29,34,35,76], it was possible to relegate the LGs constructed herein to 12
linkage groups (chromosomes).
3. Development of a consensus melon genetic map
through map merging

The F2 and RIL maps developed herein shared 79 markers in common (44 melon, 34 cucumber, and 1 watermelon), and were merged to produce a consensus map
using the JoinMap 3.0 program. The 132 dominant
AFLP and RAPD markers resident on the RIL map were
excluded from map integration because they were
deemed ineffective for defining cucumber-melon synteny. These markers tended to clustered on the linkage
map, and a number of them showed segregation distortion (data not shown). In contrast to the RIL map, the
323 markers on the F2 map were co-dominant and their
order was used as the reference during map merging.

The resulting consensus linkage map is presented in
Figure 1 and summarized in Table 1. Shared loci (boldface typed) between the F2 and RIL maps are given in
Table S3 (Additional File 1).
The consensus melon genetic map consisted of 401
co-dominant marker loci positioned in 12 LGs spanning
1,029.0 cM with an average marker interval of 2.6 cM.
Among the 12 LGs, LG4 (Chromosome IV) had the
longest map length (116.9 cM) followed by LG7 (108.0
cM) and LG1 (107.3 cM). In contrast, the length of LG
10 (Chromosome X) was the shortest (62.5 cM). Predictably LG4 possessed the most loci mapped (56) and
LG3 (24) the least markers (Table 1). Since marker
order of the F 2 map was used as the reference during
map merging, all loci on the consensus map were colinear with those on the F2 map. Moreover, inconsistencies in marker order were rare resulting in substantial
colinearity between the RIL map (Table S2) and the
consensus map (Table S3, Figure 1).
4. Identification of syntenic blocks between melon and
cucumber chromosomes

Among the 401 markers present on the consensus
melon map, 199 were SSR or CAPS markers developed
from cucumber, one from the watermelon, and the
remaining 201 were derived from melon. The cucumber Gy14 and 9930 draft genome scaffold locations of
these 401 markers were predicted by in silico PCR or
BLAST searches of the cucumber draft genome
sequences.

Figure 1 Consensus linkage map of melon. This map was developed with the JoinMap 3.0 program by merging the F2 and the RIL genetic
maps constructed in the present study. The source of each marker and their association with cucumber draft genome scaffolds is provided in
Table S3 (Additional File 1). Chr = Chromosome.

Seventy-four of the 401 markers on the consensus
melon map had no in silico PCR products or BLAST
hits suggesting that they may be specific to the melon
genome. Three markers (CMN53_36, UW084111, and
SSR05758) were located in sequences that were annotated as repeated sequences [42], and, therefore, their
cucumber scaffold locations were difficult to determine.
The remaining 324 markers could be assigned to the
Gy14 and 9930 cucumber scaffolds. The scaffold names
and physical positions of these markers are presented in
Table S3 (Additional File 1).
Once the association of these markers on the melon
consensus map with cucumber scaffolds was established,
the locations of these cucumber scaffolds in the seven
chromosomes of cucumber were deduced from published cucumber genetic maps [43,67-69] (provided in
Table S4, Additional File 1). Among the 401 markers
placed on the melon consensus map, 79 have been
mapped in previous cucumber mapping studies
[43,67-69]. Therefore, their locations on cucumber
genetic maps could be assigned directly. For markers
with associated cucumber scaffold(s), their map locations in the cucumber genome was inferred by other
markers derived from the same scaffold, which had been
previously placed on cucumber maps (Table S4). However, three markers (UW060336, LycB, and CMCTN7)
were located in cucumber scaffolds from which no marker has been mapped. Therefore, their locations in the
cucumber genome were unknown.
With molecular markers shared between the melon
and cucumber genetic maps or linked by cucumber
draft genome scaffolds, syntenic relationships between
cucumber and melon chromosomes could be directly
inferred. Figure 2 depicts a view of the 12 melon chromosomes consisting of cucumber syntenic blocks (Chromosomes I to XII, where each melon chromosome is
portrayed in increasing order of map saturation). Inspection of Figure 2 and Table S3 indicated that melon
Chromosome I was syntenic to cucumber Chromosome
7. Likewise, Chromosomes II and XII were syntenic
with cucumber Chromosome 1; Chromosomes IV and
VI were syntenic with cucumber Chromosome 3; and
Chromosomes IX and X were syntenic with cucumber
Chromosome 5. Similarly, the three melon chromosomes III, VIII, and XI contained blocks that were syntenic to two cucumber chromosomes, 2+6, 4+6, and 2
+6, respectively. These melon-cucumber syntenic relationships are summarized in Table 2.
It has been previously hypothesized that cucumber
chromosomes evolved from a progenitor species with 2n
= 2 × = 24 chromosomes through chromosome fusion
([42]; also see Discussion below). Thus, a melon syntenic block view of cucumber chromosomes was developed which is shown in Figure 3. In this view, the

scaffolds in each cucumber chromosome were arranged
in the same order as were marker loci on cucumber
genetic maps. In most cases, the high resolution genetic
map developed by Ren et al. [43] was used as a reference for ordering those scaffolds. In rare instances, however, marker locations did not coincide with those of
Ren et al. [43] and, thus, other more recent cucumber
genetic maps [67-69] were consulted to infer marker
map locations (data not shown).
The arrangement of melon syntenic blocks across the
seven cucumber chromosomes indicates that cucumber
chromosome evolution is more complex than simple
chromosome fusion (Figure 3). For instance, cucumber
Chromosome 7 was homoeologous to melon Chromosome I along its entire length. Cucumber Chromosomes
2 and 6 each contained three syntenic blocks detected
in melon Chromosomes V+XI+III, and III+XI+XIII,
respectively, and the remaining four cucumber chromosomes (1, 3, 4, and 5) were syntenic with two melon
chromosomes but differed in patterns of arrangement of
melon syntenic blocks. Cucumber Chromosome 1 was
syntenic to melon Chromosome II and XII, whereas
cucumber Chromosome 5 was syntenic to melon Chromosome IX and X. In both cases, the syntenic blocks
from the two melon chromosomes were arranged alternatively along each cucumber chromosome. In contrast,
the syntenic blocks residing in melon Chromosomes VI
and IV were in a side-by-side alignment in cucumber
Chromosome 3. Lastly, cucumber Chromosome 4
housed syntenic blocks of melon Chromosome VII and

was found to be incorporated into the syntenic block of
melon Chromosome VII. Taken collectively, these syntenic patterns were suggestive of a complex history of
chromosomal structure changes during cucumber
evolution.
5. Verification of melon-cucumber syntenic relationships

In this study, in silico PCR and BLAST sequence alignment proved useful for inferring the cucumber scaffold
location of markers on the melon consensus map (Figures 2 and 3). To verify the syntenic relationships
between cucumber and melon chromosomes detected
from comparative mapping conducted herein, a similar
strategy was used with molecular markers from a melon
linkage map developed by Deleu et al. [36]. This genebased melon linkage map consists of 414 marker loci, of
which nearly 200 were SNPs developed from melon EST
sequences, and all these markers were derived exclusively from the melon genome. The details of this map
are shown in Table S5 (Additional File 1). The genomic
or EST sequences from which these markers were developed were used in BLAST analysis against the cucumber
draft genome assemblies. Of the 414 markers, only 3
(0.7%) did not yield either in silico PCR products or
BLAST hits in the cucumber draft genomes examined.
This contrasted with markers on the consensus melon
map (Table S3), where 81 (20.2%) of 401 (mostly

genomic DNA-derived markers) did not produce hits in
either Gy14 or 9930 genome assembly. This suggests
that the EST sequences examined are highly conserved
between these genomes.
The syntenic relationships between melon and cucumber chromosomes inferred from this gene-based melon
genetic map are shown in Table S5 (Additional File 1).
Although there were no cucumber source markers on
this map, melon-cucumber syntenic relationships
revealed from the present study (Figures 2 and 3) were
confirmed by this independent study [36].

Discussion
Cross-species transferability and polymorphisms of
cucumber SSRs in the melon genome

Nearly 2,400 randomly sampled cucumber genomic
SSRs were tested herein for their ability to detect polymorphisms among three melon parental lines used in
map construction. The polymorphism level of cross-species transferable cucumber SSRs was 11.1% between
Top Mark and WI 846-1, and 16.9% between Top Mark
and line Q3-2-2, which would be reduced to 5.9 and
7.7%, respectively if all cucumber SSRs tested were considered. This level was appreciably lower than that
reported in other studies [35,37] using melon SSRs. For
example, of 492 melon SSRs evaluated for map construction by Cuevas et al. [35], 32% were polymorphic
between two melon lines Q3-2-2 and Top Mark.

Figure 3 A melon syntenic block view of 7 cucumber
chromosomes (C1 to C7). Number(s) within each cucumber
chromosome indicated corresponding melon chromosome
numbers with significant synteny. Segments with the same color
belong to the same melon chromosome. Length of chromosome
was drawn based on number of marker loci used for inference of
syntenic blocks which is an approximation of actual length of each
chromosome.

Likewise, the level of polymorphism of melon SSRs
between the two melon lines PI 414723 and Dulce used
by Harel-Beja et al. [37] was comparatively high (as
much as 55%).
Such differences in polymorphism level may be attributable to the sources of markers (melon source versus
cucumber source), the melon lines used, or the relative
genetic distance among the germplasm being evaluated.
Two additional factors may also contribute to the low
polymorphism level detected by cucumber SSRs. Firstly,
unlike melon, which is considered genetically diverse
[2,3], cucumber has a narrow genetic base [3-6], and the
degree of polymorphism at the whole genome level for
randomly chosen SSRs between any two cultivated
cucumber genotypes is in general less than 20% [69]. In

the present study, about 45% of cucumber SSRs examined exhibited cross-species amplification in the melon
genome after PCR. This amplification level is similar to
that detected by Ritschel et al. [28] who found that
~50% of the melon SSR markers evaluated produced
amplicons when cucumber DNAs were used as templates. González et al. [40] found 54% of the melon
BAC-end sequences under investigation could be
aligned to the cucumber genome. It is likely that the
melon genomic regions that were amplified by cucumber SSRs represent conserved portions between the
cucumber and melon genomes. The genomes of Gy14
and 9930 cucumber lines have been sequenced using
the “next generation” sequencing technologies (Roche
454 and Illumina GAII) [42,66], and, therefore, most of
the assembled genome sequences may originate from
the gene-rich low or single copy DNA fraction in the
genome, which are more conserved between closely
related species such as melon and cucumber than repetitive DNA sequences [40,41]. Therefore, using SSRs
developed from highly conserved gene-rich genomic
DNA regions of a genome with limited genetic diversity
may be an important contributor to the low polymorphism of cucumber SSRs in the melon genome. The second factor, as discussed in Cavagnaro et al. [66], is that
melon SSRs used in previous mapping studies (e.g.,
[35,37]) may over-estimate the polymorphism in the
genome due to biases created during SSR selection,
because of the reiterative selection for longer repeats
during development of microsatellite markers. That is,
library screening methods for SSR isolation are designed
to yield a higher proportion of long SSRs, which are
preferentially used for designing primers, which are then
typically pre-screened for their relative polymorphism
level in potential parental lines. Thus, the most polymorphic loci are selected for further utilization (because
there is a positive relationship between SSR length and
polymorphism [66,77,78]). In this study, the polymorphism level detected between Q3-2-2 and Top Mark
(7.7%) or Top Mark and WI 846-1 (5.9%), although very
low, may reflect the true global polymorphism of
cucumber SSRs at the whole melon genome level.
The melon consensus linkage map with cucumber SSRs

The consensus map developed herein added a considerable number of SSR markers (~2 times) towards map
saturation in melon (1 < cM between markers). We
added 154 and 127 new markers to the previously developed melon F 2 (from Q-3-2-2 × Top Mark) and RIL
(from Top Mark × WI 846-1) maps [34,35], respectively.
Marker order on the new (Table S1) and the historic F2
maps were almost identical. The RIL map was improved
over the historic map [34] (i.e., from 28 LG to 22 LGs),
but was still relatively fragmented (i.e., small linkage

Li et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:396
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/396

groups), which was likely due to the large number of
dominant markers incorporated into the RIL-based map.
It is known that dominant markers such as RAPDs or
AFLPs tend to be clustered on the linkage maps
[37,67,79-81], and for this reason, dominant markers
were excluded in map merging for development of the
consensus map.
Even though more than the predicted numbers of LGs
were present on the F2 and RIL maps, the large number
of shared marker loci enabled integration of the two
maps to produce a consensus melon genetic map with
the expected 12 LGs (Table 1, Figure 1). This consensus
map contained 401 co-dominant markers including 199
derived from cucumber, and is the first melon map containing such a high number of cucumber-derived markers. The map length of this consensus map was 1,029
cM, which is within the predicted size range of the
melon genome (1,000-1,500 cM) [35]. The reliability
(quality) of this map can be measured by its colinearity
and its relationship with available cucumber scaffolds.
Although there were minor discrepancies in marker
orders (Tables S1-S3) between markers on the consensus and the RIL-based maps, these maps were largely
collinear (Tables S1-S3). The disparities detected
between these maps may be, in part, due to varying
recombination rates between mapping population (e.g.,
RIL vs. F2), relatively small mapping populations (i.e., 80
RIL and 91 F2 individuals) used, and/or genome structural variations (deletion, inversion, or translocation)
between populations. With few exceptions, closely
linked markers on these melon maps were located in
the same cucumber draft genome scaffolds (Table S3).
Synteny between melon and cucumber chromosomes

Comparative mapping, in silico PCR, and BLAST
sequence alignment allowed a comprehensive assessment of syntenic relationships between the cucumber
and melon chromosomes (Figures 2 and 3). Among the
401 markers positioned on the melon consensus map,
81 provided no in silico PCR products or BLAST hits in
the cucumber genome sequences examined (Table S3).
Most of these 81 markers were derived from melon
genomic DNA sequences (Table S3), indicating their
uniqueness to the melon genome. The genomic distribution of these “no-hit” markers also appears to be nonrandom on the melon consensus map, and in many
cases (Chromosomes II, V, VI, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII),
these markers were located at telomeric ends, implying
the possibility of rapid evolutionary divergence (Table
S3). Such information may allow design of experiments
to investigate the nature of these regions in Cucumis
chromosome evolution.
Phylogenetic analyses [8,10,12] in Cucumis support an
early hypothesis that the base chromosome number x = 7

Page 9 of 14

in cucumber is derived from a progenitor species with x =
12 [17,18]. Six of the seven cucumber chromosomes may
be originated from chromosome fusion of such a progenitor species [42,44]. We provide herein additional information regarding the syntenic relationships between
cucumber and melon chromosomes indicating that the
evolutionary dynamics of cucumber evolution is complex
(Table 2, Figure 3). Although we confirmed the early finding [42,44] that cucumber Chromosome 7 was syntenic
with melon Chromosome I, we found that the co-linearity
of marker loci in the two chromosomes has been broken
(Table S3, Additional File 1) suggesting that Chromosome
7 of cultivated cucumber may have undergone certain
structural changes since its divergence from an ancestral
species (e.g., melon or C. hystrix, see below). The other six
chromosomes of cucumber appear to have more complicated evolutionary histories. For instance, both Chromosomes 2 and 6 possess genomic regions that are syntenic
to genetic blocks from at least three melon chromosomes
(III+V+XI, and III+VIII+XI, respectively; Figure 3), suggesting they are derived from more than simple chromosome fusion. Although Chromosomes 1, 3, 4, and 5 each
possessed genomic blocks syntenic with those from two
melon chromosomes, the arrangements of these blocks
differed among chromosomes (Figure 3). Since cucumber
Chromosome 3 (longest of the 7 chromosomes) [70,72]
appears to be comparatively simple in its syntenic block
organization, it is tempting to hypothesize that it originated from simple fusion of melon chromosomes IV and
VI. However, close inspection of marker order in cucumber Chromosome 3 and melon Chromosomes IV and VI
(Table S3) reveals non-colinearity, which suggests that
additional structural changes may have occurred after a
hypothetical chromosome fusion event.
Data presented herein provides a rather complicated
description of Cucumis species chromosome evolution,
making a comprehensive statement regarding chromosome evolution in melon and cucumber difficult at this
time. It is apparent that additional information is
required regarding the genomic nature of melon, and
cucumber, as well as potential ‘bridge” species [[12], e.g.,
C. hystrix) to elucidate more clear evolutionary relationships in this genus. To better understand these relationships a more saturated cucumber genetic map is needed
to increase the resolution of cucumber scaffolds for
comparative mapping. The cucumber map used herein
was developed with 77 RILs from an inter-subspecific
cross between cultivated cucumber (C. sativus var. sativus) line Gy14 and the wild C. sativus var. hardwickii
line PI 183967 [43]. There were, however, strong recombination suppressions detected during map construction
resulting in clustering of molecular markers in several
regions of cucumber Chromosomes 4, 5, and 7. Such
recombination suppression may, in part, be due to

Li et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:396
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/396

structural differences in chromosomes between cultivated and wild cucumbers (Table S3), which, in turn,
may have reduced the power of ordering markers and
scaffolds. Meanwhile, the whole genome sequencing of
melon is near completion (Garcia-Mas et al., manuscript
in preparation). This will provide a powerful tool to
understand the synteny between the melon and cucumber chromosomes at DNA sequence level.
A wild relative of cucumber, C. hystrix (2n = 2 × = 24),
may play the key role in understanding the process of
cucumber chromosome evolution. Extensive phylogenetic
analyses in Cucumis have indicated that C. hystrix is so
far the closest wild relative of cucumber [8,10,12]. The
lack of genetic affinity between C. hystrix and C. melo,
and African species, lends support to the hypothesis that
C. hystrix is a progenitor species of C. sativus, or that
they at least share a common ancestral lineage [82]. C.
hystrix has the same number of chromosomes as melon,
and is sparingly cross-compatible with cucumber, but not
melon [83]. A fertile amphidiploid, C. hystivus (2n = 4 ×
= 38) between cucumber and C. hystrix, as well as alien
addition lines have also been successfully created [84,85].
The seven meiotic chromosomes of C. sativus are larger
than the 12 chromosomes of C. hystrix [85]. Fluorescence
in situ hybridization of 45S rDNA and CsCent1 repetitve
DNA probes to cucumber pachytene chromosomes also
suggested that cucumber Chromosomes 1 and 2 may
have evolved from fusions of an ancestral karyotype with
2n = 24 [86]. These findings make C. hystrix the primary
resource for testing genetic hypotheses for further characterizing the evolution of modern cucumber.

markers. The first experiment used 91 F2 plants derived
from a cross between melon inbred lines Top Mark and
Q3-2-2. Top Mark is an andromonoecious U.S. Western
Shipping market class melon in Group Cantalupensis
[87]. The monoecious line Q3-2-2 does not fall into any
common market class, but possesses Group Conomon
and Momordica melon morphological fruit characteristics [88]. The second experiment used 80 F8 RIL derived
from Top Mark × WI 846-1 [34]. The monoecious line
WI 846-1 was derived through selfing from a three-way
cross between a C. melo ssp. agrestis (Naud.) Pangalo
germplasm (Cartago, Costa Rica), an Eastern market
type breeding line (USDA, ARS, Clemson SC), and a
Galia market type breeding line (ARO, Israel) [34]. Both
populations were previously used in the mapping of
fruit yield- and quality-related components in melon
[34,35,89,90].
Molecular marker analysis

Conclusions
This is the first broad-based comparative analysis of
synteny between melon and cucumber. The consensus
melon linkage map derived herein from two historic
maps possesses the largest number of cross-species
cucumber molecular markers currently mapped in the
melon genome and provides a greater understanding of
genomic relationships between these two important
Cucumis species. Data support the hypothesis that
cucumber chromosomes originate from fusions of chromosomes of an x = 12 ancestral progenitor. However,
many structural changes may have occurred in the evolution of the seven cucumber chromosomes. In depth
cytogenetic and molecular investigations of x = 12
Cucumis species (e.g., melon and C. hystrix) will likely
provide further evidence of chromosome evolution in
cucumber, melon and related taxons.

Two sets of SSR markers developed from cucumber
whole genome sequences were employed for polymorphism screening and the development of melon
linkage maps. The first set included 2,012 SSR markers
from the draft genome of cucumber inbred line 9930
[43] and the second set included a collection of 83,689
SSRs developed from the Gy14-derived draft genome
[66]. Also employed were 21 watermelon microsatellite
markers known to amplify in the cucumber genome (U.
Reddy, unpublished data). Information regarding all
mapped markers used herein (i.e., primer sequences and
their scaffold locations in the Gy14 and 9930 draft genomes) is provided in Table S3 (Additional File 1).
For DNA extraction, unexpanded young leaves from
each F2 plant or five plants from each RIL were placed
into a 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube, lyophilized in a
freeze dryer, and ground into fine powder in a highthroughput homogenizer (OPS Diagnostics, Lebanon,
NJ, USA). Genomic DNA from all samples was
extracted using the CTAB method [91].
Each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) contained 25
ng template DNA, 0.5 μM each of forward and reverse
primers, 0.2 mM dNTP mix, 0.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase and 1× PCR buffer (Fermentas, Glen Burnie,
MD, USA) in a total volume of 10.0 μl. A “touch-down”
PCR program was employed for all primer sets [92].
The PCR products were size-fractionated in a 9% polyacrylamide gel. After gel electrophoresis, band patterns
were visualized with silver staining, and gel images were
taken with a digital camera.

Methods

Linkage map construction and map integration

Plant materials

Previously, 169 and 256 markers loci were positioned,
respectively, on Q3-2-2 × Top Mark F2 and WI 846-1×
Top Mark melon RIL linkage maps [34,35]. Genotypic

Two melon populations were employed to conduct linkage mapping experiments using cucumber microsatellite

Li et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:396
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/396

marker data from previous mapping studies and the present study in each population were combined for linkage
analysis. For each marker, Chi-square analysis was performed to test goodness-of-fit to expected 1:2:1 segregation ratio for the F2 population and 1:1 ratio for the RIL
population (significance declared at P < 0.01). Linkage
analysis was then performed with JoinMap 3.0 with
three rounds of mapping to build the map, and LG were
established at a LOD threshold of 4.0 with the Kosambi
function.
Seventy-nine markers were shared in common
between the F2 and the RIL maps. A consensus melon
map was developed by merging the two maps according
to Cuevas et al. [35]. Common markers having the same
recombination fraction (rf) among different populations
are required for use as anchor makers during map merging [93]. Therefore, heterogeneity test was conducted
for these common markers using JoinMap algorithms to
determine recombination fractions in both populations
(RIL and F2). Common markers with different recombination fraction (P < 0.05) were excluded from map merging experiments. All AFLP and RAPD markers present
on the RIL-based map were also excluded from map
integration given their inability to provide appropriate
information for assessment of syntenic relationships.
Subsequently, these maps (F 2 and RIL) were merged
using JoinMap 3.0 (LOD = 2.0; rf = 0.35-0.50) by
employing the “fixed order“ option according to Qi et al.
[94] using the marker order present on the F2 map as
the reference. This option allowed for the definition of
fixed order marker subsets based on marker order in
the F2 linkage groups.
The numbering conventions for melon linkage groups
and their respective chromosome assignment followed
Liu et al. [74], which is consistent with the nomenclature established by the melon research community ([76],
also see http://www.icugi.org/). To avoid confusion,
cucumber chromosomes were named using Arabic
numbers (1 through 7), whereas the Roman numerals I
to XII were used to indicate melon Chromosomes 1 to
12, respectively.
Inference of syntenic relationships between the melon
and cucumber genomes

The melon consensus linkage map (401 marker loci)
was used to infer syntenic relationships between melon
and cucumber chromosomes. The map/chromosomal
locations of these markers in the cucumber genome
were inferred from procedures given below.
Initially, four SSR-based cucumber genetic maps
[43,67-69] were used as a primary reference to determine the chromosomal locations of mapped loci including a high-resolution genetic map (with 995 SSR loci)
[43]. These maps contained 1,244 unique SSR or SCAR

Page 11 of 14

marker loci distributed in seven cucumber chromosomes. The associated scaffold locations of the majority
of these markers in the 9930 or Gy14 draft genome
were known [66]. The map locations as well as their
chromosomal assignment and associated scaffolds in the
9930 and Gy14 draft genomes of the 1,244 mapped loci
are summarized in Table S4 (Additional File 1).
Of the 401 markers positioned on the melon consensus map, 199 originated from cucumber, of which 79
were present on different cucumber genetic maps
[43,67-69]. Therefore, the cucumber scaffolds associated
with these 79 markers were known. For other markers,
an in silico PCR (virtual PCR) strategy [66] was used to
deduce their position on the cucumber scaffold of the
Gy14 and 9930 draft genome assemblies. For each marker, the output of in silico PCR included the scaffold
name, nucleotide positions of left and right primer binding sites, and the sequence and expected size of virtual
PCR product. The information was generated and
recorded for both 9930 and Gy14 draft genomes and is
summarized in Table S3 (melon consensus map) and
Table S4 (cucumber linkage maps). In cases where no
or multiple in silico PCR products were available, the
marker was labeled ‘no hit’ or ‘multi-copy’, respectively
(Tables S3-S5).
Many markers mapped on the melon consensus map
were developed from EST or gene regions (e.g., ESTSSR, or EST-SNP, or genes). In this case, the source
DNA sequences were used to perform a BLAST search
against the draft genome to find their (marker) scaffold
locations. Most of the sequences examined were
extracted from the s (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/), the
International Cucurbit Genome Initiative (http://www.
icugi.org/), and the MELOGEN (http://www.melogen.
upv.es/) databases. Cuevas et al. [34,35] mapped six
melon genes in the carotenoid pathway which included
genes for the phytoene synthase (PS), beta-carotene
hydroxylase-1 (BOH-1), lycopene cyclase (LycB), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), phytoene desaturase (PDS), violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE), and the orange-related
gene (Or). These gene sequences were also employed in
BLAST search against the cucumber draft genomes to
identify the scaffold locations of their homologous
sequences.
Once a marker was assigned to the cucumber draft
genome scaffold, its map location was inferred in two
ways. Firstly, 79 of the 401 markers had already been
mapped in cucumber chromosomes, and they could be
directly assigned to specific chromosomal location(s) of
the cucumber genome. Secondly, if a marker had not
been mapped in cucumber but the cucumber scaffold
possessed markers that have been mapped in the
cucumber genome, then that marker was assigned to
the same location as those markers.

Verification of melon-cucumber syntenic relationships

A melon genetic map developed by Deleu et al. [36] was
used to verify the syntenic relationships between melon
and cucumber chromosomes identified by this study. It
was selected because it contained 414 markers in 12
LGs, of which nearly half were gene-based SNPs. All the
414 markers were developed exclusively from the melon
genome. Genomic or EST sequences from which these
markers were developed were downloaded from databases located at MELOGEN (http://www.melogen.upv.
es/), GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/) or at ICUGI
(http://www.icugi.org/) websites. The majority of these
markers could be mapped onto cucumber scaffolds
using both in silico PCR and BLAST sequence alignment. All information for molecular markers on this
consensus melon genetic map is provided in Table S5
(Additional File 1).
