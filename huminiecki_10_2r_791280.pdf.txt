2R and remodeling of vertebrate signal
transduction engine
Lukasz Huminiecki1,2*, Carl Henrik Heldin1

Abstract
Background: Whole genome duplication (WGD) is a special case of gene duplication, observed rarely in animals,
whereby all genes duplicate simultaneously through polyploidisation. Two rounds of WGD (2R-WGD) occurred at
the base of vertebrates, giving rise to an enormous wave of genetic novelty, but a systematic analysis of functional
consequences of this event has not yet been performed.
Results: We show that 2R-WGD affected an overwhelming majority (74%) of signalling genes, in particular
developmental pathways involving receptor tyrosine kinases, Wnt and transforming growth factor-b ligands, G
protein-coupled receptors and the apoptosis pathway. 2R-retained genes, in contrast to tandem duplicates, were
enriched in protein interaction domains and multifunctional signalling modules of Ras and mitogen-activated
protein kinase cascades. 2R-WGD had a fundamental impact on the cell-cycle machinery, redefined molecular
building blocks of the neuronal synapse, and was formative for vertebrate brains. We investigated 2R-associated
nodes in the context of the human signalling network, as well as in an inferred ancestral pre-2R (AP2R) network,
and found that hubs (particularly involving negative regulation) were preferentially retained, with high connectivity
driving retention. Finally, microarrays and proteomics demonstrated a trend for gradual paralog expression
divergence independent of the duplication mechanism, but inferred ancestral expression states suggested
preferential subfunctionalisation among 2R-ohnologs (2ROs).
Conclusions: The 2R event left an indelible imprint on vertebrate signalling and the cell cycle. We show that 2RWGD preferentially retained genes are associated with higher organismal complexity (for example, locomotion,
nervous system, morphogenesis), while genes associated with basic cellular functions (for example, translation,
replication, splicing, recombination; with the notable exception of cell cycle) tended to be excluded. 2R-WGD set
the stage for the emergence of key vertebrate functional novelties (such as complex brains, circulatory system,
heart, bone, cartilage, musculature and adipose tissue). A full explanation of the impact of 2R on evolution,
function and the flow of information in vertebrate signalling networks is likely to have practical consequences for
regenerative medicine, stem cell therapies and cancer treatment.

Background
Most genes belong to gene families which are derived
through consecutive cycles of gene duplication. In animals, in the absence of horizontal gene transfer, gene
duplication is the most important source of evolutionary
novelty. While most duplications are of single genes,
predominantly in tandem arrangements, whole genome
duplication (WGD) is a special case whereby all genes
duplicate simultaneously through polyploidisation. A

WGD is followed by the loss of the majority of duplicated genes in the process of rediploidisation. Over
large evolutionary time scales, rediploidisation results in
the formation of a paleopolyploid species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae was shown in a pioneering study to derive from a WGD which took place
after the divergence of Saccharomyces from Kluyveromyces [1]. Pairs of genes derived from this WGD were
shown to constitute about 13% of the yeast coding gene
set [1].
Evidence has accumulated that single-gene duplications and WGDs result in preferential retention of different functional gene classes. In particular, WGDs may

facilitate coevolution of interacting proteins, which are
likely to resist single-gene duplication because of sensitivity to gene dosage [2,3]. Ohnologs, which are defined
as paralogs derived from a WGD, were shown to be
enriched in transcription factors (TFs) and signalling
genes in animals, plants, yeast and Paramecium
(reviewed in [4]). However, no detailed analysis of the
consequences of these trends for functionality of signal
transduction pathways and signalling networks has been
undertaken for any of the known WGD events in plants,
animals or protozoans.
The modern version of the two rounds (2R) hypothesis (recently reviewed in [5]) proposes that two WGDs
occurred at the base of vertebrates after the divergence
of urochordates and before the radiation of gnathostomes, most likely even before the cyclostome-gnathostome split [6]. Recent genomic studies have provided
overwhelming support for the 2R hypothesis. In particular, strong evidence was derived through sequencing and
analysis of genomes of the human [7], the fish Tetraodon nigroviridis [8] and the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae [9]. An important methodological advance was
made by Dehal and Boore [10], who used an ingenious
approach of mapping 2R paralogons by first identifying
descendants of gene duplications mapping to the base of
vertebrates by phylogenetic timing. Furthermore, successful attempts have been made recently at the reconstruction of the ancestral vertebrate genome before 2RWGD [11].
Herein we present the first systematic analysis of the
functional consequences of 2R-WGD using state-of-theart methods for inference of orthology and duplications.
We establish a gene retention percentage for each
WGD, analyse preferences in types of retained genes
and tissue expression signatures, contrast trends
detected for 2R-WGD with those observed for tandem
or segmental duplications and view gene family data
through the lens of signalling network evolution.

Results
Phylogenetic timing links the emergence of vertebrates
with the greatest wave of gene duplications in the
history of the animal kingdom

We performed a comprehensive computational screen of
duplication patterns in the TreeFam database of
metazoan gene families (see Methods). Table 1 shows
the distribution of inferred duplication events associated
with different taxonomic units (sorted according to
rank). The highest number of inferred duplications was
associated with the emergence of vertebrates (7,701
duplication nodes), more than twice as many as for the
second most abundant taxonomic unit, the Bilateria
(3,313 nodes). Human 2R-ohnologs (2ROs) were
mapped to 9,958 unique Entrez Genes (Additional file 1,

Page 2 of 21

Table S1), which were then placed on the genome defining a linear pattern of paralogons covering 83% of the
length of human chromosomes (proving that they originated through whole genome duplication; see Methods,
Identification of paralogons in the human genome).
Next, we calculated the number of ancestral pre-2R
(AP2R) chordate genes as 3,545 by analysing the topology of TreeFam trees. 2R-WGD was assumed to initially
result in a fourfold increase minus genes lost later
through rediploidisation. Thus, the overall retention percentage was estimated as 9,958 ÷ (3,545 × 4) × 100% =
70.2%. However, this was an overestimate, as 4,231 tandem or segmental duplications, identified as nodes
younger than 2R-WGD, inflated the number of ohnologs. One also needs to take into account the number of
gene families without ohnologs, estimated from the total
of human genes in TreeFam minus 2ROs (14,892 9,958 = 4,934), or total of Ensembl-predicted human
protein-coding genes minus 2ROs (23,438 - 9,958 =
13,480). The upper-bound estimate was therefore calculated as (9,958 - 4,231) ÷ (3,545 × 4 + 4,934) × 100% =
30% and the lower bound as (9,958 - 4,231) ÷ (3545 × 4
+ 13,480) × 100% = 20.7%.
The number of duplication nodes which could be
placed at the very base of vertebrates was 3,545. An
additional 3,263 duplication nodes were children to
these nodes, yet were still assigned to vertebrates by
phylogenetic timing. These two waves of duplications, in
close temporal succession, and of similar quantitative
contributions, should be interpreted as differential signatures of two consecutive rounds of genome doubling of
2R-WGD, with similar retention rates (approximately
10%-15%, that is, half of the overall 2R-WGD retention
rate).
Gene duplication in the shared animal developmental
toolkit

A key set of uniquely important conserved genes, known
as the shared toolkit, control development in all animals.
To better understand the evolution of the toolkit, we
investigated duplication patterns of the eight key signalling pathways, namely, G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), Wnt, Notch,
transforming growth factor (TGF)-b, Janus kinase/signal
transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT),
Hedgehog and nuclear hormone receptors. These duplication patterns are illustrated in Table 1 with two clear
major waves of diversification: one at the emergence of
Bilaterians and the other tied to the emergence of vertebrates (2R-WGD). Apart from these two waves, the
toolkit was strongly conserved throughout vertebrates,
although a few additional modifications were associated
with teleosts (potentially reflecting a fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD)), tetrapods and mammals.

GPCRs were perhaps most dynamic, particularly those
involved in sensory information processing, which
was likely a sign of environmental adaptation. For example, Canis familiaris (dog) was associated with 222 species-specific GPCR duplications (the majority of which
map to families of olfactory receptors, such as
TF344049, TF337111, TF337295, TF343679, TF337210
and TF336833).
Gene families associated with the highest number of
2ROs

Gene families expanded during the course of 2R
included predominantly TFs and signalling genes.
Table 2 lists the top 20 expanded families. The highest
number of 2R duplications was assigned to the T-box
transcriptional factor family (19 gene duplication nodes);
followed by integrin-a (13 nodes); GPCRs of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone/vasopressin/oxytocin family
(11 nodes); and Cdc42, Wnt ligand, annexin and PDZ/
LIM domain family (10 gene duplications each). The
integrin-b repertoire (which pair with a-integrins in a
combinatorial fashion) also underwent substantial
expansion in the course of 2R (six duplication events).
Functional enrichment associated with 2ROs

We searched for over- and underrepresented functional
categories associated with 2ROs. Table 3 lists the top 20

overrepresented gene ontology (GO) biological process
(BP) terms. Some terms were related, as the GO
classification used was a mixture of all hierarchy levels.
No ontology should be seen in isolation; instead,
specific functions should always be viewed in the context of higher-level functions. Signal transduction
(GO:0007165) was the top overrepresented term, with
853 of the total pool of 1,160 human-associated genes
(that is, 74%) being 2ROs. The full list of overrepresented BP terms is given in Additional file 2, Table
S2_bp, while overrepresented molecular function (MF)
and cellular component (CC) terms are given in Additional file 3, TableS2_mf, and Additional file 4,
TableS2_cc, respectively.
Specific GO terms revealed signalling pathways preferentially affected by 2R-WGD, that is, GPCRs, Ras
and its regulators, Wnt pathway, and RTK-associated
signalling (Additional file 2, Table S2_bp). Several
terms also pointed to signalling associated with the
cytoskeleton and cellular attachment (Additional file 2,
Table S2_bp). Vertebrate evolutionary novelties could
be associated with a high proportion of 2ROs. For
example, a number of overrepresented terms could be
linked with the muscular upgrade: muscle contraction,
skeletal muscle development and myoblast differentiation (Additional file 2, Table S2_bp). Higher-level
terms indicated a general trend towards greater

organismal complexity, as well as expanded locomotory
and sensory abilities characteristic of vertebrates
(Additional file 2, Table S2_bp).
BP terms underrepresented among 2ROs (Additional
file 5, Table S3_bp) were dominated by basic cellular
functions strongly conserved throughout Eukaryota,
such as translation, DNA repair, RNA splicing, DNA
replication, protein folding, DNA recombination, cellular
respiration, mRNA transport or ubiquitin-dependent
protein catabolic process. Underrepresented MF and CC
terms are given in Additional file 6, TableS3_mf, and
Additional file 7, TableS3_cc, respectively.
It was also intriguing to directly compare over- and
underrepresented CC terms. The former (Additional
file 4, TableS2_cc) centered on the membrane and cellular skeleton, including plasma membrane, synapse, actin
cytoskeleton, cell junction, postsynaptic membrane and
contractile fiber. The latter (Additional file 7,
TableS3_cc), in contrast, centered on organelles, cytoplasm and the nucleus, including mitochondrion, spliceosome, ribosomal subunit, proteasome complex,
nucleolus, chromosome and cytoplasm.
Overall, these findings boldly underlined the conclusion that signal transduction genes were preferentially
retained after 2R-WGD. In stark contrast, very different
functional trends characterised duplications younger
than 2R, corresponding to tandem or segmental duplications (mapped to 5,495 unique human Entrez Genes).

Overrepresented BP terms associated with these genes
(Additional file 8, Table S3_not2R-over) were strongly
biased towards immune functions and DNA/nucleosome/chromatin packaging. Crucially, terms associated
with cell communication, development and cell cycle
were strongly underrepresented (Additional file 9, Table
S3_not2R-under).
Pathways overrepresented among 2ROs

Investigation of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways overrepresented in gene duplications associated with 2R (Additional file 10, Table S4)
revealed four classes of pathways: (1) canonical signalling pathways (calcium signalling, mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, Wnt signalling, insulin signalling, ErbB signalling, TGF-b signalling); (2)
pathways associated with vertebrate novelties (neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, axon guidance, melanogenesis, leukocyte transendothelial migration,
adipocytokine signalling pathway, vascular endothelial
growth factor signalling pathway, B cell receptor signalling pathway); (3) pathways associated with the cellular
cytoskeleton, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix
(ECM) interactions (regulation of actin cytoskeleton,
focal adhesion, adherens junction, tight junction and
ECM-receptor interaction); and (4) disease-associated
pathways (renal cell carcinoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, long-term depression, colorectal cancer, type 2

Protein domains overrepresented among 2ROs

All Pfam domains overrepresented among 2ROs were
related to signal transduction (Table 4 and Additional
file 11, Table S5). The most obvious were typical signalling domains, such as the protein tyrosine kinase
domain, the serine/threonine kinase domain (harboured
by cyclin-dependent kinases among others), Ras family
signature, RhoGEF domain, RhoGAP domain, protein
kinase C, protein-tyrosine phosphatase, neurotransmitter-gated ion channel domains and two types of 7TM
domains (rhodopsin and secretin families). Several
further domains were associated with transcriptional

Figure 1 Gene duplication timing and spatial expression domain of progeny genes. The heatmap (false-color image) reveals the
expression signature of vertebrate-specific gene duplications in the context of the broader evolutionary history of the animal kingdom. Tissues
(horizontal axis) and taxons (vertical axis) were ordered using a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm (as visualized using dendrograms). The
taxons are grouped into four clusters: (a) Eukaryota and Metazoa; (b) Bilateria, Chordata and Vertebrata; (c) Tetrapoda, Amniota, Mammalia,
Eutheria and Theria; and (d) Catarrhini, Homo/Pan/Gorilla and Homo sapiens. Two round (2R) genes (labeled “Vertebrata”) appear to be
preferentially expressed in nervous tissues (amygdala, thalamus, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, spinal cord, fetal brain, cerebellum, cortex and
whole brain; highlighted in red), whole blood (in bold font), female reproductive track (uterus and ovary; highlighted in blue), several vertebratespecific glands (salivary gland, prostate cancer, prostate, pancreas; highlighted in green) and the respiratory system (trachea and lung; in italics).

genes. Taxons and tissues were ordered using the hierarchical clustering. It is striking and has never been previously reported that taxons comprise four chronological
groups which can be aligned with major evolutionary

transitions that have occurred in the course of animal
evolution:

(c) Tetrapoda, Amniota, Mammalia, Eutheria and

(d) Homo/Pan/Gorilla, Homo sapiens and Catarrhini:
The emergence of primates
The preferential expression of 2ROs in neuronal tissues demonstrated in Figure 1 is particularly exciting.
Additional file 12, Table S6, lists 349 2ROs preferentially expressed in brain (preferential expression measure >0.4). GO terms (BP, CC and MF, respectively)
preferentially associated with these genes are listed in
Additional file 13, Table S7_bp; Additional file 14,
Table S7_cc; and Additional file 15, Table S7_mf. The
top three overrepresented terms in each category were
as follows: synaptic transmission, neurological system
process and cell communication (BP); synapse, cell
junction and plasma membrane (CC); and calcium ion
binding, transporter activity and calmodulin binding
(MF).
In the next step, we analysed expression divergence
between paralogs and found that mRNA expression
similarity decays steadily over evolutionary time. This is
proven by the falling average expression correlation
between pairs of paralogs grouped by increasing age,
detected using a variety of measures of expression distance (Figure 2a) (Pearson product-moment correlation

coefficient, Additional file 16, Figure S1; Kendall correlation coefficient, Additional file 17, Figure S2; Spearman
correlation coefficient, Additional file 18, Figure S3;
Manhattan distance, Additional file 19, Figure S4, simple
difference in breadth of expression). No specific signature could be discerned for 2ROs: the overall rate of
expression divergence was similar between tandem and
WGD duplicates, at least over large evolutionary time
scales.
Similar trends were inferred with relative protein concentration data derived from a large-scale antibody
screen of human cell lines and tissues [12]. However,
relative protein abundance between paralogs diverge
with somewhat different temporal dynamics when tissue
distribution (tissue microarray (TMA), overall; tissue
microarray focused (TMAf), focused on positive regions)
rather than cell line distribution (CMA) is considered
(Figure 2b). CMA diverges gradually, reaching a plateau
for duplications dated to mammals and older, similar to
mRNA divergence (Figure 2a). In contrast, TMA and
TMAf divergence is low for human-specific duplications,
but subsequent divergence is extremely rapid. One possible explanation is that tissue protein levels are stabilised posttranscriptionally by a mRNA-level network of
regulation, for example, through microRNA (miRNA),
and this step is subtly influenced by the tissue microenvironment. The stabilising effect, however, decays
rapidly over evolutionary time, as noncoding regions of

paralogs, being under little selective constraint, rapidly

Specific family examples
Ras system was greatly affected by 2R

Evolution of the Ras family (TreeFam family TF312796)
was shaped predominantly by the 2R event. Three vertebrate co-orthologs of Ras, K-Ras, N-Ras and H-Ras, originated from 2R. Two further duplications in the Ras
family could be mapped to 2R: (1) Ras-related protein
Ral-A (RALA; located on chromosome 7) and Rasrelated protein Ral-B (RALB; chromosome 2) and (2)
Ras-related protein (RRAS; chromosome 19) and Rasrelated protein 2 (RRAS2; chromosome 11).
RasGAPs are GTPase-activating proteins. There are
two subfamilies of RasGAPs in TreeFam: TF105303 and
TF105302. In TF105303, RAS protein activator-like 3
(located on chromosome 19), RAS protein activator-like
2 (chromosome 1), disabled homolog 2-interacting protein (DAB2IP; chromosome 9), and SYNGAP1 (chromosome 6) are 2ROs. DAB2IP acts as a tumor suppressor
gene and is inactivated by methylation or polycomb Ezh2
complex and histone deacetylase in prostate cancer [13].
SynGAP is a synaptic-specific GTPase-activating protein
[14]. There is only one RasGAP of that subfamily in fly
(CG42270) and worm (gap-2). In the second subfamily of
RasGAPs (TF105302), two duplications can be mapped
to 2R: Ras GTPase-activating protein 4 (RASA4; chromosome 7) and RasGAP-activating-like protein 1 (RASAL1;
chromosome 12), as well as Ras GTPase-activating
protein 2 (RASA2; chromosome 3) and Ras GTPaseactivating protein 3 (RASA3; chromosome 13).
Cell cycle machinery expanded dramatically in the course of
2R

Most cyclins, including key cell cycle-regulating groups
A, B and D, underwent diversification at the base of vertebrates and are represented by two to four vertebratespecific paralogs (Table 5). Analysis of the TreeFam

Page 9 of 21

database indicated that the following genes were also
2ROs: cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2 and CDK3
(TF300619), CDK4 and CDK6 (TF328559) and cyclindependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 (TF101038), as
well as p18 and p19 (TF333311) and finally orthologs of
the WEE1 (S. pombe) inactivator of the CDK/cyclin
complex, namely, Wee1 and Wee2 (TF315075).
Neurotrophin family

Neurotrophins are key growth factors influencing proliferation, differentiation, survival and death of neuronal
cells. Human neurotrophins (TF106463) include
NTF4 (located on chromosome 19), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; chromosome 11), NTF3 (chromosome 12) and nerve growth factor (NGF;
chromosome 1). NTF4, BDNF, NTF3 and NGF are evidently ohnologs deriving from the 2R-WGD (Figure 3).
Interestingly, worm and fly lack orthologs of neurotrophins [15]. The expanded neurotrophin family is most
likely involved in the sculpturing of characteristically
complex vertebrate nervous systems, with a large, centralized and multicompartmental brain.
Histone deacetylases: Cell-specific regulators of chromatin
structure

The family of class II histone deacetylases (HDAC;
TF106174) includes four vertebrate genes, that is,
HDAC4 (located on chromosome 2), HDAC5 (chromosome 17), HDAC7 (chromosome 12) and HDAC9 (chromosome 7). There is only one HDAC in fly, worm and
C. intestinalis (Figure 4). Vertebrate HDACs have cell
type-specific expression patterns and link through an Nterminal extension to TFs from a number of signalling
pathways [16]. There are links with vertebrate novelties
in the skeletal, circulatory and muscular systems.
HDAC4 is a corepressor controlling bone development
[17]; HDAC5 and HDAC9 have been shown to suppress
cardiac stress signals and control cardiac development
[18]; and HDAC9 also couples neuronal activity to muscle chromatin acetylation and gene expression [19].

2R-WGD and the architecture of the human signalling
network

First, we identified the total overlap between protein
members of the 1,625-node human cancer signalling map
(HCSM) of Cui et al. [20] and paralogous genes of different ages. (HCSM is not limited to cancer; it describes the
entire human signalling network and is suitable for the
evolutionary analyses of the type we have undertaken.)
The overlap consisted of 237 nodes for duplications
mapped to Tetrapoda and younger, 1,096 nodes for
2ROs, 194 nodes for duplications linked with the emergence of chordates and 620 for those linked with the
emergence of bilaterians (Table 6). Second, separate
overlaps were identified for subnetworks consisting of
positive, negative and scaffolding edges alone. (Note that
these categories are not mutually exclusive, as many
nodes are linked to more than one edge type.)
Network connectivity: Degree and betweenness

Table 6 illustrates the overall results of the analysis of
network connectivity, suggesting that highly connected

negative regulators were preferentially retained after 2RWGD. All statistically significant differences corresponded to increases in connectivity and/or betweenness
centrality. These statistically significant differences were
mostly associated with either 2ROs or the emergence of
Bilaterians. It should be noted that the degree of a node
and its betweenness centrality were highly correlated
(Pearson’s r correlation, 0.91), and we cannot be certain
whether the simple number of interacting partners
(degree) or the amount of information flowing through
the given node (betweenness centrality) correspond
more closely to the biological properties of the network
which were selected for in evolution.
Degree difference and edge conservation

We compared degree difference and edge conservation,
following waves of duplications of different ages. Degree
difference, that is, the absolute value of degree subtraction between two nodes, is a metric of paralog connectivity divergence. The edge conservation concept is
considered in the Discussion section. Table 7 shows that

Paralogous gene pairs linked with different taxons are mapped to the human cancer signalling map (HCSM). The entire network, as well as the subnetworks
consisting of only positive, negative or scaffolding edges, is considered. The overlap between pair sets of different ages and HCSM subnetworks is given in
parentheses in the first column. In the second column, the number of shared edges versus the total is given (as the ratio and the resulting percentage value,
calculated for the total set of paralogs). In the third column, the average difference in degree between such node pairs is given.

these two metrics were inversely correlated, that is, the
lower the average degree difference, the higher the percentage of conserved edges. Furthermore, edge conservation was higher and degree difference was lower
between pairs of nodes linked with 2ROs than those
linked with gene duplications mapping to the base of
Chordates or Bilaterians. The differences in conservation
of edges were highly statistically significant. For example, when the entire signalling network was considered,
ratios of conserved edges to the total number of edges,
calculated for each paralogous pair separately and then
averaged, were (1) 0.281, (2) 0.083 and (3) 0.141, using
Wilcoxon rank-sum test P values for pairwise comparisons 1 versus 2 and 1 versus 3 were 6.163e-08 and
1.235e-13, respectively. The differences were even more
pronounced when distribution characteristics were considered: The percentages of paralogous pairs with more
than one third of conserved edges were 39%, 9% and
17%, for (1), (2) and (3), respectively. The percentages of
paralogous pairs which had at least one conserved edge
were 65%, 35% and 47%, respectively.
It should be noted that the number of random node
pairs with shared edges is much lower than the values
observed among paralogs. By random sampling, we
approximate that the expected fraction of shared ages
under the null hypothesis is only 0.6% (versus 25.63%
for 2ROs), while only 4% of random node pairs have

any shared edges (versus 65% for 2ROs). This strongly
supports the conclusion that the presence of shared
edges between duplicate nodes stems from their shared
evolutionary ancestry.
Interestingly, for all age groups, conservation of regulatory edges with negative impact was higher than those
with positive impact. This effect was strongest for pairs
of paralogous nodes linked with 2ROs: 658 (23.92%) of
2,750 positive edges and 348 (44.44%) of 783 negative
edges were conserved. Corresponding percentage figures
for Chordates and Bilaterians were 13.66% versus
23.52% and 11.93% versus 15.89%, respectively (Table 7).
We further subdivided 2RO-linked regulatory conserved edges into those originating from the shared
interaction node and directed towards the paralogous
pair (conserved incoming edges, or CIEs) and those originating from the paralogous pair and directed towards
the shared interaction node (conserved outgoing edges,
or COEs), with similar percentage frequencies (22.28%
versus 26.91% for positive edges only and 48.42% versus
45.54% for negative edges alone).
Finally, it should also be noted that the fraction of
conserved edges for duplications mapping to Tetrapoda
and younger is not significantly different from that calculated for 2ROs (62/275 = 22.54% versus 1,728/6,741 =
25.63%, respectively; Wilcoxon P value = 0.808), suggesting that there is no dominant linear correlation

between duplicate age and edge conservation and that
greater edge conservation among 2ROs than older single-gene duplications can be attributed in large measure
to the inherent properties of genome duplication.
Paralogous nodes linked by a bridging edge

A bridging edge is an edge directly linking the paralogous node pair. Bridging interactions were preferentially
of the scaffolding type. We identified 48 bridged 2RO
pairs, with 35 scaffolding, 19 stimulatory and 5 inhibitory bridging edges (Additional file 20, Table 2ROs,
bridged). The apparent excess of activatory links was
simply a reflection of the general bias in network composition. Bridged pairs were also characterized by higher
average number of edges, 26.7 per pair versus 15 per
pair in the total set (Wilcoxon rank-sum test P value =
0.000196), and had a similar fraction of conserved edges
(0.291 versus 0.281, t-test P value = 0.77).
Analysis of the inferred AP2R network and expression states

The fly ancestral ortholog set (FAOS) is a set of unique
Drosophila melanogaster orthologs of human ohnolog
pairs inferred from TreeFam with high confidence
(bootstrap >75%). To investigate associated topology features, the FAOS was linked to the fly PPI network
described by Giot et al. [21]. We found that FAOS
nodes were characterised by increased degree (6.28 compared to the average of 5.52 for 1,000 randomly sampled
subnetworks; P = 0.005). Nodes linked with mammalian
and chordate duplications exhibited even higher-degree
biases: 7.75 and 8.74 (P = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively).
We combined the FAOS with Fly Expression Atlas
(FEA) [22] to infer AP2R expression states, as well as
patterns of expression sub- and neofunctionalisation.
The following FEA tissues were considered analogous to
human tissues: brain, midgut, hindgut, heart, ovary,

testis and fat. However, we found good correlation
between the FEA and the GEA only for brain and not
for the other six tissues (data not shown). On top of
that, in the past we have found that brain had the highest number of uniquely expressed genes and was robust
in comparative expression tests [23]. Therefore, we concentrated on brain expression.
To investigate the evolution of AP2R expression
states, we identified gene triads consisting of a unique
fly ortholog (member of the FAOS) and a pair of human
paralogs, where the three genes could be linked to
expression data in the FEA or the GEA. We then established whether these genes were preferentially expressed
in brain. Preferential brain expression (PBE) was defined
as brain signal higher than the average signal for all tissues. “b” denotes the PBE, while “nb” denotes the lack
thereof. Triads in each of six possible configurations
were then quantified and interpreted (Table 8). For
example, “b: b & b” and “nb: nb & nb” correspond to
straightforward conservation of brain expression status.
More interestingly, “b: b & nb” signifies subfunctionalisation through loss of the PBE in one of the paralogs,
while “nb: nb & b” is interpreted as neofunctionalisation
through gain of the PBE.
The first interesting observation was that subfunctionalisation was two to three times more common relative
to neofunctionalisation among 2ROs than among other
duplicates (Table 8). Clearly, subfunctionalisation, as a
faster process, was well suited for network remodeling
following 2R-WGD. The second important observation
was that expression neofunctionalisation into brain was
very rare among duplicates dating to Tetrapoda and
younger, supporting the interpretation of 2R as the formative event for vertebrate brains.

Discussion
2R-WGD occurred more than 450 million years ago, and
most resulting gene duplicates were lost, leading to rediploidisation. Here we set out to functionally characterize
retained 2ROs. First, we found that signal transduction
was the most enriched GO term (in stark contrast to tandem or segmental duplications, where this term was
underrepresented). In total, 74% of human signalling
genes were descendants of 2ROs. Foreshadowing later
findings, several GO terms were associated with the nervous system: neurogenesis, synaptic transmission, axon
guidance, nervous system development and neuron differentiation (Additional file 2, Table S2_bp). Next, we
searched for protein domains enriched among 2ROs and
found many classic signalling domains, as well as wellknown protein interaction (PI) domains, such as Src
homology 2 (SH2), Src homology 3 (SH3), phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) and PDZ (reviewed in [24]).
The PI domains aid signalling by enabling dynamic formation of signalling protein complexes. For example,
SH2 and PTB selectively recognise phosphorylated tyrosines, while SH3 binds proline-rich sequences with a
characteristic motif Pro-X-X-Pro. SH2 proteins frequently form membrane-attached signal-processing complexes at autophosphorylated receptors and participate in
positive and negative feedback loops of phosphorylation
cascades. PTB-bearing proteins, in turn, are predominantly adaptors and docking stations, frequently
anchored in the cell membrane (sometimes by means of
a lipid-binding PH domain), and promoting assembly of
large signalling complexes at autophosphorylated tyrosine kinases. Finally, PDZ domains recognise internal
valine or leucine residues and are abundant in synapses,
serving as scaffolds for the assembly of large signalling
complexes involved in neurotransmission.
To better understand the evolutionary dynamics of
2R-WGD, we investigated the relationship between relative timing of gene duplication and spatial expression
domain of progeny genes. The heatmap in Figure 1
revealed 2R’s expression signature in the broader context of animal evolution. Significantly, a trend could be
observed for brain and nervous tissue expression (amygdala, thalamus, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, spinal
cord, fetal brain, cerebellum, cortex and whole brain) to
map to the taxonomic cluster (b), Bilateria, Chordata
and Vertebrata, while being excluded from younger
clusters (c) and (d). These expression patterns, taken
together with the results of GO analysis, suggested that
the molecular machinery of the vertebrate neuron was
defined in the 2R event and strongly conserved thereafter. A previous focused study of fly and mouse noted
that vertebrate synapses were far more complex than
those of invertebrates [25], but the scale, the mechanism

Page 15 of 21

and the precise timing of this key evolutionary transition
was hitherto unknown.
Development of large multicompartmentalised vertebrate brains is shaped by three layers of control [26]: (1)
establishment of patterning centres that secrete diffusible signalling ligands, such as WNTs, BMPs and soluble
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists; (2)
brain-specific transcriptional regulatory networks involving TFs such as paired box proteins (PAX) and forkhead box protein (FOXP); and (3) extensive neuronal
apoptosis shaping the fine detail of brain structures and
compartments. For example, in a direct mechanistic
demonstration, mice deficient in cysteine-aspartic acid
protease 3 (CASP3) exhibited decreased neuronal apoptosis and hyperplasia, resulting in gross brain abnormalities [27]. How important was 2R-WGD for the
definition of this developmental toolkit? We found that
multiple WNT ligands (TF105310), PAX2/5/8 and
PAX1/9 (TF315397), FOXP1/2/3/4 (TF326978) and
CASP3/7 (TF102023) were 2ROs. Previously, we showed
that the evolution of the BMP/TGF-b pathway was
guided almost entirely by 2R-WGD [28]. In conclusion,
we identified most of the vertebrate brain developmental
toolkit as 2ROs.
The exclusion of nervous tissue from the expression
domain of newly formed mammalian and primate genes
contradicts intuition. However, anatomical differences
between vertebrate nervous systems can be sufficiently
explained by changes in developmental expression patterns of existing regulatory and structural genes of the
neuron. Higher complexity of mental functions in certain vertebrate lineages (for example, in primates, some
birds, and dolphins) is likely to stem from these anatomical differences, as well as more complex ways in
which neurons are connected, as demonstrated by the
rising area of connectomics.
Uniquely in animal evolution, and in stark contrast to
other basic cellular functions, 2R-WGD expanded the
cell cycle machinery, in particular cyclins A and B, and
the interface with signalling made up by cyclins D1-D3,
CDK4/6, p21/p27 and p18/p19. Cyclin D levels (unlike
cyclins A and B) do not correlate with cell-cycle phases
but with extracellular mitogens, cytokines, hormones
and juxtacrine ligands. Signalling pathways induce
expression of cyclin D, which pairs with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) of types 4 and 6, stimulating the
cell to enter the cycle from G1. (This progression can
be inhibited by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21/
p27 and p18/p19.) We identify all four sets of genes
involved (that is, cyclins D1-D3, CDK4/6, p21/p27 and
p18/p19) as 2ROs.
Arguably, the cyclin/CDK engine might be a relatively
late evolutionary invention, taking over from ancient

Huminiecki and Heldin BMC Biology 2010, 8:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/146

kinases [29], and with the inherent tendency for redundancy characteristic of an integrating system [30]. However, cyclin/CDK signalling is very well documented in
yeast. Regardless of the controversy regarding the nature
of primordial cell-cycle regulators, the results presented
here suggest that control over cell cycles became more
important in large and long-lived animals and that
expansion of the cyclin/CDK network, which occurred
through genome duplication, facilitated fine-tuning of
that control. No such regulatory upgrade was required
for other basic cellular functions (such as translation,
replication, splicing and recombination). We hope to
open a new area of investigation into the differences of
cell-cycle control between vertebrates and model species
such as fly, worm and yeast, with important consequences for both basic and applied science. As cyclin
D1-D3/CDK4/6 complexes have at least partially overlapping phosphorylation targets, the apparent functional
redundancy serves to integrate multiple upstream signals. In other words, 2R-WGD most likely resulted in
retention of duplicates with different signalling inputs
but similar outputs. Kinetic modeling, protein interaction and target screens focused on differences between
invertebrate and vertebrate cyclin/CDK networks should
yield the first clues.
The next question we decided to ask was whether signalling network nodes linked with 2ROs exhibited some
characteristic features, such as the degree (that is, the
number of interaction partners) or betweenness centrality (that is, the amount of network traffic, or information, flowing through a given node). The degree of
human 2RO nodes was significantly increased, with the
strongest effect on outdegree of negative regulation
(Table 6). This suggested that highly connected nodes,
that is, network hubs, in particular those involving negative regulators, were preferentially retained. Enrichment
of 2ROs in PI domains, as shown by PFAM analysis,
also suggested higher interconnectedness of the post-2R
network. The likely biological result of this trend
towards greater network complexity was increased signalling robustness and cross-talk. Negative feedback
loops, on the other hand, were likely to mediate inducible and temporary biological responses invoked by
external stimuli or network oscillations facilitating spatiotemporal patterning during vertebrate development.
However, was high connectedness driving preferential
retention, or was it merely a consequence of rediploidisation? If only we could sequence the genome of the
AP2R animal! This is, of course, impossible, but some
features can be inferred from extant species. To this
end, we compared fly and human and found that hubs
were already enriched in genes ancestral to 2ROs. High
connectedness was therefore a factor contributing
towards preferential retention. Interestingly, ancestral

Page 16 of 21

nodes associated with mammalian and chordate duplications exhibited even higher connectivity biases, but the
progeny of these genes were not associated with human
hubs. This could be explained by the evolutionary
model in which all duplications preferentially target
highly connected nodes but WGDs preserve their status
as hubs, while tandem and segmental duplications
remodel them towards reduced connectivity.
Do gene duplications conserve interactions or rewire
duplicates with novel interaction partners? We must
first define a few concepts which will help us approach
network topology from the evolutionary perspective,
with a focus on gene duplication. Let us define shared
edges as a pair of edges extending between two nodes
and an identical third node. A conserved edge, on the
other hand, corresponds to an ancestral interaction in
the ancestral network, which is still present in the extant
network. We can see that shared edges between a pair
of 2ROs are parsimoniously explained as conserved
edges (derived from an ancestral interaction in the
AP2R network), as the probability of gaining shared
edges through convergent evolution is extremely low.
Finally, a bridging edge is an edge directly linking the
paralogous node pair, suggesting sophisticated forms of
regulatory feedback and information processing between
duplicates [31]. The bridging edge is an evolutionary
novelty created as a consequence of duplication, possibly
but not necessarily associated with ancestral proteins
prone to homodimerisation.
When the concepts of shared, conserved and bridging
edges are applied to HCSM (Table 7), a number of
observations emerge: (1) the fraction of conserved edges
is higher for 2ROs than for paralogs mapping to Chordates or Bilaterians, (2) the fraction of conserved regulatory edges with negative impact is higher than those
with positive impact, and (3) complex novel network
motifs are formed by bridged hubs (Figure 5). Figure 5
shows a graph representation of a HCSM subnetwork
focusing on the apoptosis pathway featuring three
bridged 2RO pairs. Overall, bridged pairs are extremely
rich in signalling hubs, with twice the average number
of interacting partners. In terms of the broader evolutionary impact, we propose that 450 million years ago,
at the time of 2R, instantaneous doubling of the signalling network through WGD not only immediately
expanded the available space of network states but also
kick-started rapid coevolution of nodes into novel topologies. The cumulative effect was that of greatly
increased phenotype space, enabling adaptation to an
expanded range of physiological parameters, such as
temperature, osmotic pressure, availability of nutrients
and growth factors. Greater organismal adaptability
facilitated, in turn, colonisation of novel environments
or ecological niches. 2R-WGD was most likely an

instantaneous speciation, in itself an extraordinary evolutionary event, somewhat contrary to the classic Darwinian view of gradual evolution. It probably took place
under stress conditions on the fringes of the normal
ecological range of the parental species. Few “hopeful
monsters”, with duplicated genomes, must have had an
instant adaptability advantage to compete with AP2R
parental populations, despite the increased costs of
DNA replication, chromatin remodeling and chromosome segregation associated with polyploidy. For example, Conant and Wolfe [32] proposed that yeast WGD
conferred an immediate selective advantage for growth
in high-glucose environments through the increase of
dosage of genes in the glycolytic pathway. In the longer
term, as proven by our GO analysis, 2R-WGD likely
also provided a drive for increased morphological complexity [33] and conferred greater evolvability, facilitating the emergence of vertebrate novelties.

Conclusions
Herein we present the first global analysis of functional
trends among 2R-WGD-retained genes using state-ofthe-art methodology and a high-quality data set verified
through manual curation. In a methodological advance,
2R ohnologs were identified using detailed phylogenetic
trees on the basis of a tree-merging algorithm implemented in the TreeFam database. We found that 2R-WGD
was the paramount source of novelty in vertebrate evolution, affecting an overwhelming majority (74%) of signalling genes, in particular developmental pathways
involving receptor tyrosine kinases, Wnt and TGF-b
ligands, GPCRs and apoptosis pathway. Moreover, 2RWGD redefined vertebrate synapses and facilitated the
formation of centralised brains. We show that 2R-WGD
preferentially retained genes associated with higher organismal complexity (for example, locomotion, nervous system, morphogenesis), while genes associated with basic
cellular functions (for example, translation, replication,
splicing and recombination, with the notable exception
of cell cycle) tended to be excluded. In conclusion, 2RWGD left an indelible imprint on the vertebrate signalling network (including the interface with cell-cycle
machinery) and set the stage for the emergence of key
vertebrate functional novelties, facilitating the evolutionary success of this taxonomic group. Finally, we link
observed functional trends to signalling network and
expression evolution, investigating the human signalling
network and the inferred AP2R network, a comparison
that has never previously been performed.
Methods

Page 18 of 21

TreeFam relies on a multistage computational pipeline
and a tree-merging algorithm implemented in the
TreeBeST phylogenetic engine. Several types of trees are
utilized: (1) a maximum likelihood tree built using
PHYML with the WAG model, (2) a maximum likelihood tree built using PHYML with the HKY model, (3)
a neighbor-joining tree using P distance, (4) a neighborjoining tree using Ka distance, and (5) a neighbor-joining tree using Ks distance. The merging procedure is
implemented in the TreeBeST phylogenetic engine. In
the first step of the merging procedure, the set of permitted branches and nodes is constructed, given the
input set of trees. In the second step, the tree which
optimizes the objective function is found. The objective
function measures the similarity between a gene tree
and the species tree (by minimizing the number of
inferred gene duplications and losses), as well as the
overall bootstrap support. TreeBeST has been tested
extensively against knowledge of biologists, including
manual curation, within the TreeFam and Ensembl databases [35].
TreeFam release 6 database was downloaded as a set
of SQL instructions and data files, and reconstituted as
a local MySQL database. The total data set extracted
from TreeFam6 consisted of 11,635 trees containing
391,730 genes and assigned to 64 different taxonomic
categories spanning the animal kingdom with S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana as outgroups. Perl scripts based on
the provided TreeFam API http://treesoft.sourceforge.
net/tf-perl-api.shtml were used to extract the data.
Figures 3 and 4 were produced using a locally installed
version of the TreeBeST pipeline. Trees were rooted on
time. A speciation and duplication inference (SDI) algorithm, based on the reconciliation of the gene tree with
a trusted species tree [36], was used to infer orthology,
paralogy, speciation nodes and gene duplication events.
However, inferred duplication events with no species
intersection support (SIS = 0) were attributed to locally
incorrect gene tree topology.
GO, KEGG and PFAM enrichment analysis

A hypergeometric test implemented in the Bioconductor
package GOstats was used to detect enrichment in GO
categories, KEGG pathways, PFAM domains or spatial
clustering along human chromosomes. The test is
implemented in function hyperGTest, which enables
testing for both over- and underrepresentation of terms,
and conditional correction taking into account the hierarchical structure of GO ontologies was used [37].

Tree families database

Expression signatures of gene duplications throughout
the animal kingdom

TreeFam (Tree Families; http://www.treefam.org/) is a
database of phylogenetic trees of animal genes [34].

Expression data are derived from a Gene Expression Atlas
[38], a collection of Affymetrix readings from 47 human

Huminiecki and Heldin BMC Biology 2010, 8:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/146

tissues and cell lines (see Additional file 21, Table S8, and
http://expression.gnf.org/human_annot.html). Mapping of
Affymetrix clusters to Entrez Genes was derived from the
R environment table hgu95aENTREZID. In case of multiple probes mapping to the same Entrez Gene, average
values across the probes were taken. Original data from
the Gene Expression Atlas were in the form of average difference (AD) values, representing the fluorescence
assigned to a given gene probe after subtraction of background calculated from its mismatch control. The cutoff
accepted in the GEA for a gene to be regarded as
switched-on or expressed was AD = 200. The AD values
were converted to preferential expression measures
(PEMs). PEM is log10(S/A), where S is the Affymetrix signal for a given gene in a specific tissue and A is the arithmetic mean signal for the gene across all tissues. To avoid
biasing PEM values by genes without detectable expression in any of the GEA tissues or by genes with very high
average expression, data points with ADavg < 50 or ADavg
> 999 were omitted (2,130 and 545 of the total 6,837
human genes mappable to the GEA data set). The actual
number of genes with expression data corresponding to
each taxonomic unit and average PEM values across 47
human GEA tissues are given in Additional file 22, Table
S9. The heatmap in Figure 1 was generated using the standard R function and the brewer.pal palette from the RColorBrewer package. Tissues (horizontal axis) and taxons
(vertical axis) were ordered using a simple hierarchical
clustering algorithm and visualized using dendrograms.
For the analysis of tissue specificity of expression, two
separate measures of tissue specificity were used: percentage breadth of expression and PEMMAX. Percentage
breadth of expression was defined as the percentage of
the 47 human tissues studied in which a given gene was
expressed above the threshold level (AD = 200). PEMMAX is the maximal value of the PEM across the 47 tissues for a given gene.

sometimes even marginal. Various algorithms aiming at
increased sensitivity have been developed, including the
Automatic Detection of Homologous Regions
(ADHoRe), which combines information across multiple
homologous segments. In our analysis, multiplicon
detection was performed using the i-ADHoRe 2.4 [39]
implementation of the ADHoRe algorithm. The following parameter values were used: 30 intervening genes
were allowed between anchor points, a minimum of five
anchor points were required to define a multiplicon, a
quality value of 0.8 and a probability cutoff of 0.00001.
Multiplicon detection was used to verify gene duplications assigned to the 2R-WGD by phylogenetic timing.
Positional mapping of human genes descending from
the duplication node mapping the base of vertebrates
yields a characteristic pattern of paralogous regions covering 83% of the length of the human genome, constituting a definitive signal of an ancient WGD (Additional
file 23, Table S10, contains the list of genes with chromosomal location; Additional file 24, Table S11, defines
the paralogy relationships between human 2ROs). Similarly to the analysis of Dehal and Boore [10], chromosomes 18, 21 and Y were found not to harbour any
paralogous regions, suggesting that they originated after
2R-WGD (Additional file 25, Table S12, lists fractions
contained in multiplicons by chromosome breakdown).
Additional confirmation can be derived from the fact
that no simple spatial clustering in chromosomal gene
order can be detected for the list of 2ROs, which would
be expected if these paralogs arose in the standard fashion, that is, by tandem duplications. In contrast, such
chromosomal clusters can be found for descendants of
gene duplications mapped by phylogenetic timing to
other taxons, such as Chordata (Additional file 26,
Table S13), Amniota/Tetrapoda (Additional file 27,
Table S14), Mammalia/Eutheria/Theria (Additional file
28, Table S15) or identified as human-specific (Additional file 29, Table S16).

Identification of 2R paralogons in the human genome

We identify 2ROs in the human genome with high certainty by the combination of phylogenetic timing and
paralogon detection. By phylogenetic timing, we mean
the inference of relative evolutionary timing of gene
duplications on the basis of the patterns of presence or
absence of orthologs and paralogs in genomes of extant
species, assuming a known and trusted species tree.
Paralogons (or multiplicons) are pairs of mutually
paralogous chromosome regions in which gene content
and gene order are conserved. Coverage of the majority
of the genome by multiplicons is an unmistakable signature of a past WGD. It should be noted that in the case
of ancient WGDs, such as the 2R event, a large number
of positional rearrangements is bound to have occurred
and the conservation of synteny is imperfect or

Analysis of the human signalling network

A manually curated signalling network consisting of 1,634
nodes, termed the human cancer signalling map (HCSM),
was derived by Cui et al. [20] from the integration of several data sets: the BioCarta database http://www.biocarta.
com/, the Cancer Cell Map http://cancer.cellmap.org/cellmap/ and the data set described by Ma’ayan et al. [40].
The integrated network consists of 5,059 edges divided
into undirected 1,915 scaffolding links (neutral physical
interactions) and directed 2,403 activator and 741 inhibitory links. The network was retrieved as a Microsoft Excel
file (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) and processed
into two tab-delimited files containing data on nodes and
edges, respectively. These files were then processed into a
format compatible with the R class graphNEL and

analysed using the R package RBGL (an interface to the
popular Boost C++ library of graph algorithms). Protein
members of the signalling network were mapped to Entrez
Gene Ids. Custom R functions were written to analyze the
overlap between human gene sets mapped to gene duplications of different phylogenetic age and the protein nodes
of the imported human signalling network. Nodes were
compared using standard RBGL functions, with regard to
degree (including indegree and outdegree), and betweenness centrality (function brandes.betweenness.centrality,
method relative.betweenness.centrality.vertices) as shown
in Table 6. P values were calculated by comparison with
distributions of relevant function values calculated for random subgraphs of the same size as that obtained through
mapping to a given test set. Random subgraphs were
derived through permutation of node labels using sampling without replacement.
An analysis of conservation of network edges following gene duplications of different ages was also performed (Table 7). The number of identical edges was
compared against the total number of edges linked to
the pair of nodes identified as paralogs. The percentage
of conserved edges was calculated and is shown in
Table 7. An undirected graph representation of the
human signalling network was used. The average difference in degree between paralogous nodes, and the number of paralogous nodes connected by a bridging edge,
were also calculated (Table 7).
