Abstract
Background: Tetraspanins (TSPs), also known as members of the trans-membrane 4 super-family (TM4SF),
comprise an assemblage of surface antigens reported in eukaryotic organisms. In the work presented here, six
novel TSP proteins from the human blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) were produced and
analyzed through a combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches.
Results: Six novel TSP proteins of Schistosoma japonicum (designated as Sj-TSP-#1~6) contained four transmembrane regions and one large extracellular loop (LEL) with a conserved CCG motif. Size of the proteins varied
from 227 to 291 amino acid residues. All the six proteins were produced in E.coli and immune sera to each protein
were prepared. Analysis of transcription profiles of the proteins by RT-PCR showed that Sj-TSP-#4 was transcribed
only in the egg stage while transcription of the Sj-TSP-#2 was detected in female worms but not in males. The
similar results were obtained by Western blot. Immunolocalization of the TSP proteins by immunofluorescence
assay showed that the Sj-TSP-#2, Sj-TSP-#5 and Sj-TSP-#6 were located in the tegument of worms.
Conclusions: This study provided six novel TSP members of S. japonicum including their sequences and
recombinant proteins. Availability of the novel proteins and information on their expression profile and location
provided a basis for further investigation of the TSP proteins for their biological functions and as vaccine
candidates.

Background
Tetraspanins (TSPs) are members of the trans-membrane4-superfamily (TM4SF) and are widely expressed in eukaryotic organisms. The first reported member of the
TM4SF, CD81, was recognized when murine mAb-5A6
reacted proteins were studied in a human cell line [1].
After the genomic sequencing of several model organisms,
numerous TSP members were found and proved to be
conserved through distantly related species by expressed
sequence tag analysis [2]. The TSP family includes 33
mammalian members [3,4], at least 37 members found in
the Drosophila melanogaster genome [5] and 20 members
in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome [6,7]; the family
also includes fungus [8] and sponge TSPs [9].
Members of the family are characterized by the following four trans-membrane regions: short cytoplasmic tails
at the N- and C-terminus, the small extracellular loop

(SEL), the large extracellular loop (LEL) with a conserved
Cys-Cys-Gly (CCG) motif and other juxtamembrane
cysteine residues of palmitoylation sites [10]. The physiological roles of TSP are largely unknown. Recently, several lines of evidence indicated that TSP is involved in
cell adhesion, migration, tumor metastasis and neurite
outgrowth [11,12]. TSP also has been reported to interact
with many proteins that are critically important to
immune function, such as forming immune-complex to
regulate B cells proliferation, binding B cell or T cell epitope to lead to polarization towards a Th1 response, rearranging distribution of MHC II molecules to modulate
peptide loading and etc [7,12-14].
At present, several members of the TSP family have
been identified in Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) and
Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) such as Sj25 [15],
SjTE736 [15], Sm23 [16]/Sj23 [17], SmTSP1 [18] and
SmTSP2 [18]/SjTSP2 [19,20]. According to the numbers
of TSP from the above species, other members of this
family should exist in S. japonicum. To further investigate the sequences of TSP members and their potential

functions, it is necessary to identify and analyze other
new TSP members. Therefore, in the present study, we
screened for new members of TSP using bioinformatics
and experimental approaches in S. japonicum. In addition, the putative TSP proteins were produced and analyzed for their expression profiles at transcriptional and
translational level among various developmental stages
and genders of the parasite.

Results
Identification of novel TSP members in S. japonicum

Structure characteristic of ‘tetraspanin’ proteins contain
four trans-membrane regions, forming two loops including a SEL and a LEL which contains a conserved CCG
motif located at the C-terminus [21]. According to the
protein structures, we used TMHMM2.0 software to
screen for 523 sequences from integrated information of
transcriptome and proteome of S. japonicum [22], we
identified six novel TSP proteins which were designated
as Sj-TSP-#1~6 (Table 1). Alignments of the deduced
amino acid sequences of the six novel TSP proteins were
shown in Figure 1. All the proteins contain the conserved
‘CCG motif’ indicated in bold and four putative hydrophobic trans-membrane regions. Moreover, the TSP
proteins also contain several different predicted palmitoylation sites and N-glycosylation sites (Figure 1).
We also predicted putative domains in the six TSP proteins by searching a conserved domain database (CDD).
As shown in Figure 2A, Sj-TSP-#1 shared many specific
matches with penumbra [23], a member of TM4SF that
serves as the organizer of signaling complexes in cell
membranes. Sj-TSP-#3 shared a high specific domain with
TSP. Moreover, Sj-TSP-#2, Sj-TSP-#4 and Sj-TSP-#5
shared a high specific domain with uroplakin-I [24].
Although Sj-TSP-#6 showed a non-specific match with
tetraspanin, it had structure characteristic of ‘tetraspanin’
proteins. Therefore it is classified as TM4SF family. In
addition, a phylogenetic tree was constructed basing on
the deduced amino acid sequences of Sj-TSP-# 1~6 and
their closest homologues from S. mansoni, including several known TSP proteins (Figure 2B). Sj-TSP-#1 shared
83% identity with CD151-related protein [Genbank:
XP_002582093.1], which is a member of TM4SF [25].
Sj-TSP-#2 shared 29% with Tetraspanin-1 (Tspan-1)
[Genbank: XP_002577444.1], which is a tumor proliferation-related protein from the TM4SF [26]. Sj-TSP-#3
shared 98% with tetraspanin family protein 16 invertebrate
[Genbank: XP_002573925.1]. Sj-TSP-#4 shared 38% with
tetraspanin-CD63 receptor [Genbank: XP_002574749.1].
Sj-TSP-#5 shared 64% with tetraspanin D76 [Genbank:
XP_002575497.1], which was the same sequence of tetraspanin-18 [27]. Sj-TSP-#6 shared 82% with transmembrane 4 superfamily member [Genbank: XP_002579012.1].
These data further suggested that the six novel TSP

Page 2 of 11

proteins be the members of the TM4SF. In addition, the
phylogenetic relationship revealed that Sj-TSP-#1 and
Sj-TSP-#3 were classified into the CD subfamily while
Sj-TSP-#6 was classified into the CD63 subfamily, and the
rest three proteins were classified into the Uroplakin subfamily (Figure 2B).
Analysis of transcription and expression profile of the six
TSP genes at different developmental stages and genders
of the parasite

To examine transcriptional patterns of the six TSP members at different developmental stages and genders, the
screened TSP genes were generated by RT-PCR. As
shown in Figure 3A, the control gene of SjGAPDH was
produced in all the stages and genders, but the six TSP
genes showed different patterns of transcription: Sj-TSP#4 was detected only in the egg stage while the other
TSP genes were detected in both schistosomulum and
adult parasite (Figure 4A). Interestingly, the Sj-TSP-#2
gene was transcribed in female but not in male parasites
(Figure 4A).
To investigate expression profiles of the novel TSP proteins in different stages of the parasite by Western blotting, we firstly expressed the six novel TSP recombinant
proteins (rSj-TSP-#1~6) in E.coli and purified the proteins
using Ni-column. The six purified proteins were shown in
Figure 3A and interacted with anti-His-tag monoclonal
antibody as shown in Figure 3B. To prepare the immune
sera, groups of mice were immunized with the individual
rSj-TSP-#1~6, respectively. Protein extracts derived from
different stages of parasite were subjected to immunoblotting and interacted with their corresponding immune sera.
As shown in Figure 4B, the native Sj-TSP-#1, Sj-TSP-#2
and Sj-TSP-#3 proteins were detected in schistosomulum
and adult worm stages with the exception of the male
adult that does not express the Sj-TSP-#2, which is similar
to the observation in transcription detection (Figure 4A,
lane M). Similarly, expression of Sj-TSP-#4 was detected
only in the egg stage (Figure 4B). In addition, expression
of Sj-TSP-#5 and Sj-TSP-#6 were detected in the adult
worm but not in schistosomulum stages (Figure 4B).
Moreover, Sj-TSP-#2 expression was detected in the purified tegument component (Figure 4B, lane TM) of the
adult worms while the Sj-TSP-#1 and Sj-TSP-#3 expressions were detected in tegument-stripped component
(Figure 4B, lane STR) as the Non-TM TSPs, which is consistent to other observation that the Sj-TSP-#3 was
expressed on the gastrodermis of S. japonicum [28]. And
the Sj-TSP-#5 and Sj-TSP-#6 were present in both components, suggesting they were located on the surface and
in internal tissues of the adult worms as well (Figure 4B).
We performed immunofluorescence assays to determine
localization of the proteins using various immune sera. As
shown in Figure 5, Sj-TSP-#2, Sj-TSP-#5 and Sj-TSP-#6

proteins as TM TSPs were located in the tegument on
whole-mount adult worms of S.japonicum.

Discussion
Genetic evidence found in fungi, worms, and mammals
confirmed that TSP exerts a wide influence in the coordination of intracellular and intercellular processes,
including host-parasite interaction which may be associated with immune evasion [14]. Great success has
been achieved in vaccinating against schistosomiasis
using TSP recombinant proteins such as SmTSP2 [18].
It appears that TSPs are the most important proteins
which have been found in schistosomes, and identification of novel TSP proteins in S. japonicum can help to
develop new tools for the control of schistosomiasis. In
this work, we screened and identified six novel TSP
genes in S. japonicum and analyzed their expression
profile during various developmental stages of the parasite. Availability of these novel Sj-TSP members should
provide a basis for further investigation of their biological functions.

TSP forms a large group of integrated-membrane proteins. The proteins in this family are 200-300 amino acids
in length and have four trans-membrane domains; there is
one SEL region containing 13-30 amino acids, a short
intracellular sequence, and a second LEL harbored CCG
motif, which is variable in sequence length in determining
its functional specificity [29]. Protein palmitoylation is the
modification of juxtamembrane cysteine residues [30] that
results in the formation of a thioester linkage in the protein and plays a crucial role in the TSP web [31]. Conserved N-glycosylation sites are required for signal
transduction, intercellular stability and subunit folding
[32]. The six novel TSP proteins identified in this study
have these characteristics including the size, four transmembrane domains, the LEL with the CCG motif, and glycosylation etc. These characteristics are also used to distinguish TSPs from other four trans-membrane proteins.
In the TM4SF, the TSP proteins can be divided into four
major subfamilies: the CD family, the CD63 family, the
uroplakin family and the retinal-degeneration-slow (RDS)
family [33]. However, the RDS-containing TSPs have not

been identified in schistosomes. This could be due to lack
of bioinformatical data for the cercaria stage [34]. The
classification approach determined that the CD63-like
group included the CD family (including CD151, CD9,

TSPAN1, et al), the uroplakin family and the CD63 family
(such as CD63, TSPAN31, et al), indicating that these
three families likely diverged from a CD63-like ancestor
[35]. Therefore, Sj-TSP-#2, Sj-TSP-#4 and Sj-TSP-#5

Jiang et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:190
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/190

containing uroplakin-I-like LEL, as well as Sj-TSP-#1
(similar with CD151-related from S. mansoni) and Sj-TSP#3 (a score of 124 when compared with the CD9 antigen
[Genbank: NP_031683.1]), may have similar functional
properties, relative to their closely CD63 proteins. Among
them, Sj-TSP-#3 could be more closely related to CD9
which plays a role in the immune modulation [36] and fertilization [37]. We suppose that it had a similar function in
schistosome immune evasion and reproductive biology. SjTSP-#6, with a score of 148 when compared with
TSPAN31 [Genbank: NP_080258.1], is also included in
the CD63 family of TSP based on sequence analysis [33].
Therefore, it is suggested that the six genes share a common ancestor of CD63-like group.
The RT-PCR results showed that the six TSPs have
distinct expression profiles during the life cycle of the
parasite excluding the cercaria stage. Their protein
expression patterns also were in accordance with their
transcriptions with the exception of Sj-TSP-#5 and SjTSP-#6 protein. Tran’s experiment [38] pointed that the
highest level of SmTSP1 expression was detected in cercaria whereas SmTSP2 expression was lowest in cercaria. This suggested that TSP members likely have
different functions during various development stage of
schistosome. In addition, the TSP proteins of the parasite can be expressed either tegument component or the
tegument-stripped component or both components. As
the tegument is generally viewed as the most susceptible
structure to host-mediated immune attack [39-41], we
would suggest that Sj-TSP-#2, Sj-TSP-#5 and Sj-TSP-#6
as TM TSPs should be considered as priority antigens
for vaccine candidates. Although both Sj-TSP-#1 and SjTSP-#3 were non-TM TSPs, we also could not rule out
their possible effects on immune modulation [42].
Recent technical advances assisting to guide TSP
research focus on the LEL region of the TSP basing on
its important functions in mediating protein-protein
interactions [43]. Strategies for targeting functions of
TSP include recombinant soluble LEL, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), RNA interference (RNAi) and additional
approaches [44]. Further investigations are still necessary to determine potential functions of the Sj-TSPs
involving immune modulation and growth regulation of
the parasite by various approaches including use of
monoclonal antibody to the TSP proteins, and also the
RNAi technique.

Conclusions
This work demonstrated the existence of six novel TSP
proteins in S. japonicum. The proteins showed different
transcriptional and expression profiles during various
developmental stages and gender. Three of the six TSP
proteins were located in tegument structure. The work

presented here expands future exploration into biological roles of S. japonicum TSP proteins.

Methods
Animals and parasites

Female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. The animals remained
under specific pathogen-free conditions and had access
to food and water ad libitum. Mice were 6-8 weeks of
age at the start of each experiment, cercaria were
obtained from the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases,
Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in
Shanghai. Live-stage schistosomulum and adult worms
were harvested from rabbits by mesenteric perfusion at 3
weeks and 6 weeks, respectively. Eggs were obtained
from the livers of mice 6 weeks after infection by S. japonicum. All experimental procedures performed on animals within this study were conducted in accordance
with, and by approval of the Internal Review Board of
Tongji University School of Medicine.
Screening for new members of the tetraspanin family by
bioinformatics analysis

The new nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences
of tetraspanins were analyzed from published integrated
data [22]. The transmembrane domains in the proteins
were predicted by THMHMM 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.
dk/services/TMHMM/). The N-linked glycosylation sites
were predicted by Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X stands for any
amino acid except for Pro) motif. The protein domain
was predicted by CD-search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/cdd). The protein palmitoylation sites were predicted
by CSS-Palm 2.0 software.
Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses

Multiple alignments of new protein sequence were performed by CLUSTALW and phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbour-Joining method [45] and
bootstrap analysis (1000 replication) [46] in MEGA 4 software. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in
the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used
to infer the phylogenetic tree. The numbers of the tree
represent the confidence of the branches assigned by
bootstrap.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

The new TSP gene Sj-TSP-#1~6 mRNA expression profiles in various cell lines were analyzed by RT-PCR. Total
RNA was isolated from S. japonicum during different
developmental stages using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen),
and first strand cDNA were synthesized from 1 μg of the
total RNA with an oligo (dT) 15 primer (Invitrogen). The
Sj-TSP-#1~6 open reading frame were amplified with

Jiang et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:190
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/190

their respectively specific primers based on the listed
accession numbers in Tab 1. GAPDH from S. japonicum
(SjGAPDH) primers (forward prime: 5’- GGACCATTAAAAGGCATCTTGG-3’, reverse prime: 5’-GCAACT
GTAGCCGAATTCATTG-3’) serving as a positive control. No template was as a negative control. The PCR
reaction was performed using ExTaq enzyme (Takara)
and initiated with one cycle of 5 min at 94°C, followed
by 26 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 40 s at
72°C. PCR products were detected from agarose gel
electrophoresis.
Recombinant protein expression and purification

The gene fragments encoding LEL of Sj-TSP-# 1~6 were
amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase. Specific forward
and reverse primers with introduction of an EcoRI or HindIII site at their extremities were used for the rSj-TSP#1~6. Recombinant plasmids pET28a+ vector (Novagen,
USA) containing the specific fragment of six TSP members were constructed. After sequencing, the correct plasmids were transformed into E.coli BL21 strain (DE3)
(Invitrogen, USA) to express. Expression of recombinant
proteins was induced with IPTG at 1mM. These recombinant proteins were purified with a hexahistidine tag and
confirmed by 6-His tag antibody (TIANGEN, China).
Preparations of mouse anti-rSj-TSP-#1~6 specific antisera

To produce the antisera to the recombinant proteins,
BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with individual 20 μg recombinant protein by Freund’s complete
adjuvant (Sigma, USA), followed by two boosting with
Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) at 2 weeks intervals. Polyclonal antibody sera were collected 10 days after
the third immunization.
Proteins preparation

Total proteins from eggs, cercaria, liver-stage schistosomulum, mixed adult worms, male and female adult worms
were extracted in 40 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2% SDS supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (Sigma) on ice. Moreover, the tegument extract was obtained by a freeze/thaw/
vortex procedure, as previously described [47]. Briefly, frozen adult worms were thawed on ice in the presence of 1
ml RPMI 1640 medium plus proteinase inhibitors (Sigma),
with 10 vortex pulses at a maximum speed for 1 s to
detach the tegument. The supernatant part collected
namely tegument proteins. The left tegument-stripped
worms were extracted in a similar way according to the
total proteins preparation. A Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad,
CA, USA) was used to measure protein levels.
Western blotting assay

Equal quantities of proteins were separated by 12% SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes

(Millipore). Membranes were incubated with primary
antiserum of specific rSj-TSP-#1~6 and probed with an
alkaline phosphatase (AP) -conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG (H+L) antibody (Promega) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Subsequently, the chemiluminescence AP
substrate (Promega) was used to detect the specific
bands. Recombinant proteins were as a positive control
to product a specific band under the reaction of their
respective antisera.
Immunolocalization

Immunofluorescence assay of adult worms from S.japonicum was conducted as previously described [18]. Freshly
female and male worms from S. japonicum were fixed in
100% methanol. After blocking, the sections were incubated with mouse anti-sera Sj-TSP-#2, 5, 6 (1:25 dilution)
and followed by FITC-conjugated goat antibody to
mouse IgG (Sigma, 1:150 dilution). Pre-vaccination
serum was used as a negative control. Worms were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma; 0.1 mg/ml in PBS), which
stains nuclei. Images were acquired with a fluorescence
microscope.
