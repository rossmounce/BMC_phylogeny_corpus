Abstract
Background: Cysteine proteases have been shown to be highly relevant for Apicomplexan parasites. In the case of
Babesia bovis, a tick-transmitted hemoparasite of cattle, inhibitors of these enzymes were shown to hamper
intraerythrocytic replication of the parasite, underscoring their importance for survival.
Results: Four papain-like cysteine proteases were found to be encoded by the B. bovis genome using the MEROPS
database. One of them, the ortholog of Plasmodium falciparum falcipain-2, here named bovipain-2, was further
characterized. Bovipain-2 is encoded in B. bovis chromosome 4 by an ORF of 1.3 kb, has a predicted molecular
weight of 42 kDa, and is hydrophilic with the exception of a transmembrane region. It has orthologs in several other
apicomplexans, and its predicted amino acid sequence shows a high degree of conservation among several B. bovis
isolates from North and South America. Synteny studies demonstrated that the bovipain-2 gene has expanded in the
genomes of two related piroplasmids, Theileria parva and T. annulata, into families of 6 and 7 clustered genes
respectively. The bovipain-2 gene is transcribed in in vitro cultured intra-erythrocyte forms of a virulent and an
attenuated B. bovis strain from Argentina, and has no introns, as shown by RT-PCR followed by sequencing.
Antibodies against a recombinant form of bovipain-2 recognized two parasite protein bands of 34 and 26 kDa, which
coincide with the predicted sizes of the pro-peptidase and mature peptidase, respectively. Immunofluorescence
studies showed an intracellular localization of bovipain-2 in the middle-rear region of in vitro cultured merozoites, as
well as diffused in the cytoplasm of infected erythrocytes. Anti-bovipain-2 antibodies also reacted with B. bigeminainfected erythrocytes giving a similar pattern, which suggests cross-reactivity among these species. Antibodies in sera
of two out of six B. bovis-experimentally infected bovines tested, reacted specifically with recombinant bovipain-2 in
immunoblots, thus demonstrating expression and immunogenicity during bovine-infecting stages.
Conclusions: Overall, we present the characterization of bovipain-2 and demonstrate its in vitro and in vivo
expression in virulent and attenuated strains. Given the involvement of apicomplexan cysteine proteases in essential
parasite functions, bovipain-2 constitutes a new vaccine candidate and potential drug target for bovine babesiosis.

candidates [5]. The best characterized P. falciparum

peptidases are the falcipains, which are cysteine peptidases that belong to clan CA, subfamily C1A.
Assortment of peptidases into clans is based on the
presence of sequence motifs around the catalytic residues, their evolutionary relationships and/or similarities
in their tertiary structure. Clans, in turn, are subdivided
in families, according to their amino acid sequence similarities. Cysteine peptidases of clan CA utilize catalytic
glutamine, cysteine, histidine and asparagine residues
that are invariably in this order [6]. These four amino
acids are present in three separate, well conserved
regions of the primary sequence that correspond to the
mature protease, which are known as the eukaryotic
thiol (cysteine) proteases cysteine, histidine, and asparagine active site regions.
Falcipain-2 has shown to be involved in digestion of
host erythrocyte hemoglobin in the parasite food vacuole
[7,8]. The amino acids that result from this process are
used for parasite protein synthesis [9,10], and contribute
to maintain the osmotic stability of the parasite [11].
Hemoglobin degradation might provide space for the
growth of the parasite inside the erythrocyte [12]. Additionally, falcipain-2 has been shown to cleave host erythrocyte membrane skeletal proteins ankyrin and protein
4.1. The removal of the carboxyl terminus of ankyrin
weakens its interaction with the erythrocyte membrane
and yields an increased rate of membrane fragmentation
of infected erythrocytes [13]. In addition, falcipain-2
cleaves protein 4.1 within a region of the spectrin-actin
binding domain critical for erythrocyte membrane stability [14]. It has been postulated that the proteinaseinduced ankyrin and protein 4.1 degradation destabilizes
the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, which in turn facilitates parasite release [15]. Furthermore, it has been
shown that cysteine peptidases might be involved in the
differentiation of plasmodial gametocytes into ookinetes.
Torres et al [16] demonstrated that serine/cysteine protease inhibitors TPCK and TLCK, but not the serine protease specific inhibitors PMSF and leupeptin, inhibited
exflagellation centers formation, suggesting a participation of cysteine proteases in P. berghei gamete activation
and zygote development.
Cysteine proteinases have been shown to play critical
roles in the pathogenicity of other parasitic protozoans
as well. Thus, they have been identified as virulence factors in Leishmania amazonensis and Entamoeba histolytica [17,18]. Virulence is intimately associated with
proteolysis and invasion of cells and/or tissues by intracellular and extracellular parasites [19]. Accordingly,
cysteine proteinases of Toxoplasma gondii and Trypansoma cruzi have been found to be involved in host cell
and tissue invasion and egress [18,20]. Adherence of
E. histolytica to erythrocytes and epithelial cells as well
as excystation processes of Cryptosporidium sp. and

Page 2 of 12

Giardia sp. [18] have been shown to be mediated by
parasite cysteine proteinases.
This type of enzyme is ubiquitous in all kingdoms of
organisms. In mammals, cysteine proteinases function in
diverse processes like apoptosis, prohormone processing,
tissue remodelling, turnover of the extracellular matrix,
and extracellular degradation of foreign proteins [21,22].
Importantly, lysosomal cysteine peptidases also regulate
the immune response by mediating antigen presentation
of classical MHC class II and non-classical MHC class-I
molecule CD1D [23].
Cysteine peptidases have so far not been characterized
in B. bovis. However, evidence of their importance for
the survival of these parasites was obtained by the observation that specific inhibitors of these enzymes impaired
merozoite growth in vitro [24]. As in P. falciparum,
cysteine peptidases may be involved in the erythrocyte
egress of B. bovis merozoites, a prerequisite for the maintenance of the asexual propagation of the parasite, and/or
nutrition of the trophozoite and merozoite parasite stages
that reside within the erythrocyte through degradation of
hemoglobin. Additionally, B. bovis cysteine peptidases
may also play an important role in several differentiation
steps of the parasite (sporozoite, trophozoite, merozoite,
kinete) as well as in invasion and evasion processes
within the tick vector tissues.
The aim of this work has been to identify and characterize the falcipain-2 ortholog in B. bovis, as well as to
make an inventory of cysteine proteinases in this parasite and two related piroplasmids.

Results
Identification of putative cysteine peptidases of the C1
family in the B. bovis T2Bo genome

Four putative cysteine peptidases of clan CA, subfamily
C1A [6], were identified in the B. bovis T2Bo predicted
proteome. Two of these cysteine proteinases belong to
the family of dipeptidylpeptidase I of the Plasmodiumtype [MEROPS:C01.124] which is confined to protozoans. This type of cysteine proteinases is composed of the
cathepsin C exclusion domain, whose function is to prevent the approach of a polypeptide apart from its termini,
and the catalytically active cysteine peptidase region. The
remaining two cysteine proteinases were found to be
papain homologues of the Theileria-type. This type of
proteases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes and
proteolytic cleavage of the inhibitor region [MEROPS:
I29.UPW] is required for activation of the peptidase C1
unit [MEROPS:C01.079]. Apart from protozoans, this
type of papain-like cysteine proteinases has also been
found in other eukaryotes. The identification number,
chromosome location, current annotation status, predicted protein size and active site region localization of
these four cysteine peptidases are shown in Table 1.

Molecular characterization of bovipain-2

Among the four predicted cysteine proteases mentioned
above, the peptide XP_001610695 showed to be orthologous to P. falciparum falcipain-2. According to current
nomenclature standards, this protein is referred to as bovipain-2 in this work. Bovipain-2 orthologs are present in
B. bigemina, T. annulata, T. parva, P. knowlesi, and
P. vivax (Table 2). A very high E value was also found
with a cysteine peptidase of T. orientalis (E value, 7e-73)
and B. equi also known as T. equi [25] (E value, 3e-70),
however, as the complete genome sequence of these two
organisms is not available, orthology could not be
established.
The bovipain-2 encoding gene is located half way
between the centromere and the 3’ telomere of chromosome 4. It is surrounded, upstream, by a gene encoding a
GTP-binding protein and, downstream, by a gene encoding a hypothetical membrane protein (Figure 1). No other
peptidase-encoding genes are found in close vicinity. The
bovipain-2 ORF is 1338 bp long, and encodes for a putative protein with a calculated molecular weight of 42 kDa.
Secondary structure prediction of the bovipain-2 ORF
showed three distinct regions: an N-terminal hydrophilic
region of 43 amino acids (aa), predicted to be located in
an aqueous compartment at one side of a membrane, a
22 aa-long hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a

380 aa-long region at the opposite side of the membrane
that extends to the C-terminus. Domain predictions
(Figure 2) showed the typical prepropeptide organization
of cysteine proteases of the papain family, including a 43
aa-long signal peptide, a 24 aa transmembrane domain,
a spacer, and a 320 aa-long propeptide (which corresponds to a predicted molecular weight of 34 kDa). This
propeptide is composed of a cysteine peptidase inhibitor,
a spacer and a 209 aa-long mature enzyme of an estimated molecular weight of 26 kDa.
Post-translational modification of 3 sites that are
potentially N-glycosylated (N113, N198, and N221) and
1 site that is potentially O-glycosylated (T204) could be
predicted based on sequons in the propeptide/spacer
region of bovipain-2. As the available bioinformatic
tools have been developed for mammalian organisms,
the validity of these predictions in Babesia needs to be
verified by direct experimental evidence.
The mature enzyme owns three stretches of amino
acids that contain the catalytic residues (Q254, C260,
H389, and N411). Upon folding, these amino acid
sequences configure the 3D structure of the catalytic center of the proteinase. These three stretches are known
as 1) eukaryotic thiol (cysteine) proteases cysteine
(aa 254 to 265), 2) histidine (aa 387 to 397), and 3) asparagine (aa 406 to 425) active site regions, since these

residues are essential for enzymatic activity. Their
sequence is highly conserved among several apicomplexan parasites, as shown in Figure 2.
Bovipain-2 predicted amino acid sequences encoded in
the genome of different B. bovis geographic isolates
from USA, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil and Mexico
were aligned and compared (data not shown). A high
percentage of overall identity (97.8%) was observed
among these sequences, with polymorphism in 10 sites
(Table 3). All ten of these amino acid substitutions are
conservative, and were in silico predicted not to affect
protein function, as the exchanged amino acids have
similar physico-chemical characteristics.

were, analyzed (Figure 3A). Clades 1, 3, and 4 each contain one B. bovis cysteine peptidase with their respective
T. annulata and T. parva orthologous counterpart.
Orthology of the protein sequences in clades 1, 3, and 4
were also confirmed by a reverse BLAST test. In contrast, clade 2, contains the B. bovis cysteine peptidase
defined in this work as bovipain-2, as well as an evolutionary closely related family of 7 T. annulata and 6
T. parva cysteine proteinases (Figure 3B). Comparative
genomics of the bovipain-2 coding region of B. bovis
with corresponding cysteine proteinase encoding regions
of T. annulata, and T. parva genomes demonstrated
that the bovipain-2 gene has expanded into a gene
family of 7 and 6 cysteine proteinase encoding genes,
respectively. Both gene families are clustered and have
possibly originated from several gene duplication events.
It is noteworthy that a small ORF encoding a hypothetical protein [GenBank: XP_001610696] that is lying
downstream of the bovipain-2 encoding gene in B. bovis
has high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) in T. annulata
and T. parva. However, only in T. parva, but not in
T. annulata this ORF has been annotated. This highly
likely represents an example of a mis-annotation as this
ORF has been reported to be conserved in apicomplexan parasites [26].
Transcription and expression of bovipain-2 in B. bovis
in vitro cultured merozoites

RT-PCR, using total RNA from in vitro cultured parasites
from the Argentine virulent strain BboS2P (Figure 4) and
the attenuated strain BboR1A (not shown) as template,
demonstrated that the bovipain-2 gene is transcribed in
intra-erythrocytic stages of both strains. Sequence comparison between the DNA and the resulting cDNA
sequences showed the absence of introns.
Antibodies against a recombinant form of bovipain-2
recognized at least two distinct proteins of in vitro cultured merozoites of the BboS2P strain in immunoblots.
Two bands of 26 and 34 kDa were observed, which
coincide with the expected sizes of the proenzyme and
the mature enzyme, respectively (Figure 5A).
Immunofluorescence confirmed the expression and
intracellular localization of bovipain-2 in in vitro cultured merozoites from an Argentine (BboS2P) and a
Mexican (RAD) strains (Figure 6A and 6B). Fluorescence microscopy analysis indicated that the signal
appeared concentrated in a dense spot, in the middlerear region of the cell (Figure 6B). Additionally, diffuse
fluorescence was also observed in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes infected with merozoites of either strain, but
not in non-infected erythrocytes (Figure 6F), thus
demonstrating that the pattern of fluorescence observed
was bovipain-2-specific and not due to possible crossreaction with erythrocyte proteins. As expected [27],

Common physico-chemical characteristics

The complete bovipain-2 coding sequence of different isolates was sequenced. The table shows the polymorphic sites and the amino acid substitutions, after
alignment of predicted peptide sequences. Amino acid polymorphic positions within the active site region are in italics. The least frequent substitution in each
column is in bold. Common physico-chemical characteristics of amino acids found at each polymorphic site are depicted in the last row: p: polar; a: aliphatic; h:
hydrophobic; s: small or tiny; n: negatively charged. Single-letter amino acids code was used.

anti-rhoptry associated protein-1 (RAP-1) monoclonal
antibodies tested on the same smears yielded a punctuated pattern, with no erythrocyte cytoplasm reaction
(Figure 6D), and normal mice serum gave no signal
(Figure 6E). B. bigemina merozoites of an Argentine
(BbiS2P) (not shown) and a Mexican (Mexico strain)
strain (Figure 6C) also reacted with anti-bovipain-2 antibodies, as shown by immunofluorescence, yielding a
similar pattern to that observed for B. bovis. Thus, the
immunofluorescence data indicates that bovipain-2 is
expressed in intra erythrocytic stages of B. bovis.
Antigenicity of bovipain-2 in B. bovis-infected cattle

Partially purified recombinant bovipain-2 was tested in
immunoblots against serum samples from bovines
experimentally infected with the BboS2P (n = 3) or the
BboR1A (n = 3) strains of B. bovis (day 63 p.i.). Non
B. bovis-reactive sera from two bovines from a tick-free
region of Argentina were used as negative controls.
Only one of the BboS2P-infected and one of the
BboR1A-infected sera reacted with recombinant bovipain-2 (Figure 5B), while all BboS2P and BboR1A sera
strongly reacted with recombinant MSA-2c (not shown),
a previously characterized immunodominant protein of
B. bovis [28]. These results indicate that bovipain-2 is
expressed and immunogenic in the course of bovine
infections with these two strains.

Discussion
P. falciparum falcipain-2 has received a great amount of
attention as a target for therapeutic interventions against
malaria, due to its relevant functional role [29]. This
work identifies and characterizes bovipain-2, the B. bovis
ortholog of falcipain-2. The biological significance of
this protein is underscored by the observation that
B. bovis growth can be inhibited using cysteine-proteinase inhibitors [24].

Based on their sequences, falcipain-2 and bovipain-2
are classifiable as cysteine peptidases belonging to Clan
CA, subfamily C1A. This peptidase subfamily is characterized by the presence of four catalytic Q, C, H, and A
residues present in three separate, well conserved
regions of the primary sequence that corresponds to the
mature protease, which are known as the eukaryotic
thiol (cysteine) proteases cysteine, histidine, and asparagine active site regions (Figure 2). In the final tertiary
conformation of the protein, the catalytic amino acids
are brought together and constitute the enzyme active
site. Importantly, predicted models of the putative catalytic site in falcipain-2 and bovipain-2 showed a similar
arrangement of the relevant C, H, and N regions that
form the active site of the enzyme in both proteins,
despite high sequence polymorphisms in the intervening
regions (data not shown). Furthermore, alignment of
bovipain-2 orthologs from different apicomplexan parasites showed strict conservation of the catalytic residues
and low polymorphism in their surrounding areas
(Figure 2). Additionally, full sequence conservation was
observed among bovipain-2 protein sequences of
B. bovis geographical isolates in the whole region that
harbors the active site. This constraint for genetic variation is likely due to the need for keeping the structural
conformation of the protein in order to preserve its
activity. Thus, taken together these data support a
cysteine protease function for bovipain-2, similar to
what was previously described for falcipain-2.
Interestingly, apart from bovipain-2, only 3 other C1
cysteine proteinase encoding genes seem to be present in
the B. bovis-genome. The bovipain-2 encoding gene corresponds to gene families in T. annulata and T. parva of
7 and 6 members, respectively. In contrast, the other
cysteine proteinase encoding genes of B. bovis have a single ortholog equivalent in T. parva and T. annulata. We
hypothesize that the expanded cysteine-protease family

(8-9); or a monoclonal antibody that reacts with the histidine tag of
the recombinant protein (7). A band of 50-55 kDa was recognized
in samples 1, 6 and 7 by reaction with peroxidase-labeled speciesspecific secondary antibodies, followed by chemiluminiscence
detection.

to be demonstrated in future investigations. Gene duplications and tandem arrays of similar isoforms of clan CA
peptidases have also been found in other related protozoan parasites, but the biological implications of this phenomenon remain unclear [30].
In P. falciparum falcipain-2 localizes in the food
vacuole, where hemoglobin digestion takes place [31].
However, falcipain-2 expression was detected also outside of the food vacuole and near the erythrocyte membrane skeleton which is consistent with the proposed
involvement of erythrocyte membrane skeletal protein
cleavages in merozoite egress [15]. The punctate immunofluorescence pattern shown in Figure 6 indicates that,
similar to its P. falciparum ortholog, bovipain-2 also
appears to be localized in a yet undefined, internal organelle of the parasite. Food vacuoles have been described
in Babesia sp. but only on the basis of morphological
evidence [32,33]. Thus, further investigations need to be
carried out to more exactly elucidate the intracellular
location of bovipain-2. However, similarly to Plasmodium, anti-bovipain-2 antibodies also reacted with the
cytoplasm of B. bovis-infected erythrocytes of different
strains tested, while smears of non-infected erythrocytes
showed no reactivity. These observations suggest first,
that bovipain-2 and erythrocyte proteases do not share
cross-reactive B-cell epitopes and also, that bovipain-2 is

Mesplet et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:113
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/113

released into the erythrocyte cytoplasm. Occasionally,
some erythrocytes in which no parasites could be
detected showed cytoplasmic reactivity in smears of
B. bovis-infected erythrocytes (data not shown). Since
non-infected erythrocyte smears showed no reactivity
with anti-bovipain-2 antibodies, a possible explanation
for this observation is that the parasites egressed from
the reactive erythrocytes before the smears were prepared, leaving released proteins behind. Reactivity
towards empty erythrocytes of antibodies that recognize
babesial proteins was previously observed in the case of
the merozoite spherical body protein, Bb-1, which can
be found on the cytoplasmic side of the erythrocyte
membrane [34]. It has been suggested that Bb-1 is
secreted by B. bovis into the erythrocyte cytoplasm,
where it might be involved in invasion and/or exit
processes.
Anti-bovipain-2 antibodies cross-reacted with B. bigemina merozoites. A 48.5% identity in the predicted
amino acid sequences of bovipain-2 and a putative
B. bigemina protein named babesipain [35,36] (Table 2)
could be responsible for the observed cross-reactivity.
The cytoplasm of B. bigemina-infected erythrocytes also
reacted with anti-bovipain-2 antibodies, suggesting that
release of babesipain from B. bigemina merozoites has
also taken place.
Expression of cysteine proteases in cultured, wild type
or attenuated B. bovis parasites can be affected by distinct possible selective pressures. This is significant
since the pattern and level of expression of cysteine proteases were also regarded as potential factors affecting
the virulence of parasites [18]. Sera from bovines experimentally infected either with the BboS2P or BboR1A
Argentinean strains reacted with the recombinant bovipain-2, confirming in vivo expression and immunogenicity of the protein in the blood stages of the parasites
regardless of their degree of virulence.
However, because four out of six sera from infected
animals tested failed to recognize recombinant bovipain2, the results also suggest that bovipain-2 might be
poorly immunogenic during acute infection. It has been
reported that subdominant antigens may prove to be
more effective as vaccine candidates than immunodominant antigens [37]. Based on this supposition, bovipain2 constitutes an interesting candidate for subunit
vaccine development. Alternatively, it is possible that
these sera also contain antibodies reactive with conformational epitopes in the native protein that are not able
to recognize the recombinant version of bovipain-2.
In silico analysis of the B. bovis predicted proteome
using the MEROPS database has shown the presence of
66 proteases, that belong to the cysteine (n = 18), serine
(n = 18), metallo (n = 19), threonine (n = 6) and aspartic (n = 5) classes (manuscript in preparation). Although

Page 8 of 12

this number is small compared to P. falciparum (n =
93), the high number of protease-encoding genes
appears to indicate that these enzymes participate in critical metabolic processes and/or signalling mechanisms
that need to be separately regulated. On-going experiments to analyze which of these proteases are transcribed in the merozoite and other stages of the parasite
life cycle will throw light on their possible functional
roles and their suitability as targets for improved control
methods for bovine babesiosis.

Conclusions
Collectively, the data presented in this study identifies
and demonstrates the in vitro and in vivo expression of
bovipain-2, a cysteine protease, in Babesia bovis.
Because this family of proteases plays significant roles in
the biology of related parasites, they might become additional targets for improving the control of bovine babesiosis. Whether antibodies against bovipain-2 present
during natural infection reduce the parasite burden and
whether this protein is a viable candidate for vaccine
development or for new anti-babesial drugs will be the
subject of future research.
Methods
Bioinformatic analysis

C1 cysteine peptidases were identified from the proteome
as predicted by the genome of Babesia bovis (T2Bo
strain), Theileria annulata (Ankara strain) and T. parva
(Mumuga strain) [38] using the MEROPS database
[6,39]. Orthology was established when the complete
genome sequence of the corresponding organism was
available using reciprocal BLASTP best hit [40]. Percentages of protein identity were calculated using a BLOSUM62 matrix. Possible deleterious effects of amino acid
substitutions on protein function were predicted by SIFT
[41,42]; which takes into account sequence homology
and the physical properties of amino acids. After alignment of the amino acid sequences of the catalytic region
of cysteine proteinases of B. bovis, T. annulata and
T. parva by clustalw [43], their phylogenetic relationship
was constructed by neighbor joining using MEGA4
[44,45]. Synteny studies were carried out with GEvo
[46,47]. Parameter settings using BLASTZ were as follows: word size 8, gap opening penalty 400, gap extension
penalty 30, and score threshold 1800. The minimum high
scoring sequence pair (HSP) length for overlapped features was set to 50. For the prediction of glycosylation,
NetNGlyc and NetOGlyc were used [48-50].
Samples and DNA extraction

The following B. bovis strains and isolates were used:
BboR1A, an Argentine vaccinial strain [51]; BboS2P and
BboM3P, pathogenic isolates derived from clinical cases

Mesplet et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:113
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/113

in Salta and Corrientes, Argentina, respectively; Veracruz, a pathogenic isolate from Mexico [52]; Brazil and
Uruguay, which originated from clinical cases from
these countries.
BboR1A and BboS2P strains were maintained in
in vitro culture on bovine erythrocytes in M199 medium,
supplemented with 40% bovine serum, at 37°C, basically
as described by Levy and Ristic [53] but using a regular
10% CO2 atmosphere. BboM3P, Brazil, Uruguay and Veracruz isolates were amplified in splenectomized calves.
In vitro cultured merozoites were partially purified by differential centrifugation as previously described [54]. In
the case of parasites amplified in splenectomized calves,
whole blood was centrifuged (3000 × g, 30 min, 4°C), the
pellet was frozen at -20°C overnight, and then washed
thrice with PBS by centrifugation (3000 × g, 30 min, 4°C)
to remove released hemoglobin. DNA was purified from
both kinds of samples with phenol/chloroform/isoamylic
alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) extraction and
ethanol precipitation, using established procedures [55],
followed by RNAse (USB, Cleveland, OH; 20 μg/ml, 45
min, 45°C) and proteinase K (USB; 100 μg/ml, overnight,
45°C) treatment. DNA samples were re-extracted, dissolved in distilled water, quantified by spectrophotometry, and kept at -20°C until use.

SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq
DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), 2× reaction mix (following the manufacturer’s protocol), and 0.4 μM of bovipain-F and bovipain-R primers in a final reaction
volumen of 25 μl. Parallel negative controls were prepared, containing the same composition without Reverse
Transcriptase. As positive control, primers that amplify
the MSA-2c transcript [28] were used with the same
RNA samples. All samples were incubated for 30 min at
55°C, followed by 2 min at 94°C and then subjected to
40 cycles of 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 55°C and 60 s at 68°C,
with a final extension period of 5 min at 68°C. Amplicons were visualized and sized as described above.
Sequencing

PCR and RT-PCR amplicons were purified using the
GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification kit (GE
Healthcare), and both strands were sequenced using
specific primers, at the Internal Service of Genotyping
and Sequencing Ibiotec (Institute of Biotechnology, CICVyA, INTA-Castelar, Argentina). The Big Dye Terminator v3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
and a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer equipment (Applied Biosystems) were employed.
Expression and purification of recombinant bovipain-2

PCR amplification

An aliquot of DNA (50 ng) was added to a PCR mix (25 μl
final volume) containing 2 mM Cl 2 Mg, 200 μM each
dNTP, 1 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and 0.4 μM bovipain-F and bovipain-R primers (5’-ATGGAAATACCGGCTGCTG-3’ and 5’-ATATGGGACATAAC
CGTAAG-3’, respectively). After 10 min incubation at
95°C, samples were subjected to 35 cycles of: 60 s at 95°C,
45 s at 55°C and 60 s at 72°C, followed by an extension
period of 10 min at 72°C. Amplicons were visualized in
ethidium bromide-stained 0.8% agarose gels and sized by
comparison with a 1 kb Plus DNA ladder (Invitrogen).
RNA extraction

Total RNA was extracted from 5 × 106 infected erythrocytes of in vitro cultured B. bovis BboS2P and BboR1A
parasites, using the NucleoSpin RNAII kit (MachereyNagel, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA integrity was protected with 1 U/ul of
Riboblock (Fermentas, Burlington, Canada). Samples
were then treated with DNAse (Invitrogen) for 15 min at
room temperature, followed by addition of 2 mM EDTA
and incubation at 65°C for 10 min for DNAse inactivation. The final samples were kept at -80°C until use.
RT-PCR

RNA aliquots (150 ng) from either the BboS2P or
the BboR1A strain of B. bovis were incubated with

The entire bovipain-2 ORF, amplified by PCR from
DNA of B. bovis BboR1A was cloned into pCR2.1 vector
(Invitrogen). The correct reading frame of the recombinant construct was verified by sequencing. After digestion of bovipain-2-pCR2.1 with EcoRI (Promega,
Madison, WI), the restriction fragment was purified
using GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification kit (GE
Healthcare) and cloned in-frame in the prokaryotic
expression vector pRSETB (Invitrogen). E. coli Rosetta
(DE3, Novagen) cells were transformed with the recombinant vector and expression was induced by overnight
exposure to 1 mM IPTG (Invitrogen) in Luria Broth
medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml
chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were pelleted by
centrifugation and the pellet was solubilized in Laemmli
buffer. Aliquots of this lysate were electrophoresed in
preparative 12% polyacrylamide minigels in the presence
of SDS. A protein molecular weight marker (Fermentas)
was run in parallel to size the bands. Gel sections containing 50-55 kDa proteins were excised, and placed in
a cellulose membrane dialysis tubing retaining proteins
of molecular weight of 12 kDa or greater (SigmaAldrich). Proteins were electroeluted in a horizontal
electrophoresis chamber at 35 mA for 2.5 h in SDSPAGE running buffer, followed by dialysis against PBS.
For Western blots, samples were 5× concentrated
inside the dialysis membranes by exposure to solid
sucrose at room temperature, followed by dialysis

against PBS. Finally, 1 mM PMSF, final concentration
(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was added, protein concentration was measured by the Micro BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, USA), and samples were
stored at -80°C until use.

incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG, and
blots (b) and (c) with peroxidase-labeled anti-bovine IgG
(Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and the reactions were
visualized by ECL chemiluminiscence. As positive control, recombinant B. bovis MSA-2c [28] was used.

Production of antisera

Indirect immunofluorescence assay

Adult male Balb-c mice (n = 2) were inoculated with
bovipain-2, produced and partially purified by electroelution as described above, emulsified in Sigma Adjuvant
System (Sigma-Aldrich). Inoculations took place at days
0, 20, 40 and 55 and each consisted in 200 μl emulsion,
containing 50 μg of protein, which were administered in
several spots through the subcutaneous and intraperitoneal routes. Hyperimmune serum aliquots were collected by heart puncture at day 70 p.i. after euthanizing
the mice with CO2.

Aliquots (5 ml) of in vitro cultured suspensions of B.
bovis merozoites in bovine erythrocytes (10-15% infected
erythrocytes) from the strains BboS2P (Argentina) or
RAD (Mexico); or with in vitro cultures of B. bigemina,
strains BbiS2P or Mexico, were washed thrice with PBS
by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS/0.5% normal
horse serum. Smears of these suspensions or of non
infected erythrocytes (5 μl) were prepared, divided in
sections with Enamel paint and incubated with: a) normal mouse serum in a 1/60 dilution; b) a pool of two
anti-bovipain-2 mouse sera (70 dpi) in the same dilution; and c) anti-RAP-1 23/70.174 Mab [27], 8 μg/ml.
The fixed immunofluorescence assay was carried out as
described before [56], using fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Dacko, Glostrup,
Denmark), or donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488
(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Eugene, OK). Slides were
mounted with glycerol/PBS (1:1, v/v) and observed
under fluorescence microscopy (400 and 1000 ×
magnification).

Detection of bovipain-2 expression in in vitro cultured
merozoites

In vitro-cultured B. bovis BboS2P merozoites were purified by centrifugation in Percoll gradients as described
before [54]. Samples containing 7 μg of protein were
dissolved in Laemmli buffer, electrophoresed in 10%
polyacrylamide minigels in the presence of SDS, and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. A protein
molecular weight standard from Fermentas was run in
the same gels. Blots were blocked with 10% (w/v) dry
low-fat milk in PBS/0.01% Tween-20 (PBST) and incubated with a pool of mouse anti-bovipain-2 hyperimmune serum (day 70 p.i.), or with a pool of serum
obtained at day 0 from the same mice (1/50 dilution in
blocking buffer). After three washes with PBST, reactivity of antibodies with merozoite proteins was detected
by incubation with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG
(Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, CA) followed by ECL
reagent (GE Healthcare). Chemiluminiscence was visualized on Hyperfilm sheets (GE Healthcare) developed
with Kodak photographic reagents (Rochester, NY).
Reactivity against bovipain-2 of sera from B. bovisinfected cattle

Partially purified recombinant bovipain-2 obtained as
described above was electrophoresed in 12% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS, followed by transfer
to nitrocellulose membranes, blocking as above, and
incubation with the following sera: a) monoclonal antihistidine antibody (GE Healthcare); b) bovine sera negative to B. bovis antibodies from a tick-free region of
Argentina (n = 2); or c) sera of bovines experimentally
infected with B. bovis BboR1A (n = 3) or BboS2P (n =
3), (day 63 p.i.). Sera from groups (b) and (c) were preincubated with an E. coli lysate (0.1 mg/ml, 37°C, 1 h).
Bovine sera were tested in 1/10 dilution. Blot (a) was
