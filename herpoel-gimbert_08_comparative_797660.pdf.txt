Abstract
Background: Due to its capacity to produce large amounts of cellulases, Trichoderma reesei is
increasingly been researched in various fields of white biotechnology, especially in biofuel
production from lignocellulosic biomass. The commercial enzyme mixtures produced at industrial
scales are not well characterized, and their proteinaceous components are poorly identified and
quantified. The development of proteomic methods has made it possible to comprehensively
overview the enzymes involved in lignocellulosic biomass degradation which are secreted under
various environmental conditions.
Results: The protein composition of the secretome produced by industrial T. reesei (strain CL847)
grown on a medium promoting the production of both cellulases and hemicellulases was explored
using two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF or LC-MS/MS protein identification. A
total of 22 protein species were identified. As expected, most of them are potentially involved in
biomass degradation. The 2D map obtained was then used to compare the secretomes produced
by CL847 and another efficient cellulolytic T. reesei strain, Rut-C30, the reference cellulaseoverproducing strain using lactose as carbon source and inducer of cellulases.
Conclusion: This study provides the most complete mapping of the proteins secreted by T. reesei
to date. We report on the first use of proteomics to compare secretome composition between
two cellulase-overproducing strains Rut-C30 and CL847 grown under similar conditions.
Comparison of protein patterns in both strains highlighted many unexpected differences between
cellulase cocktails. The results demonstrate that 2D electrophoresis is a promising tool for studying
cellulase production profiles, whether for industrial characterization of an entire secretome or for
a more fundamental study on cellulase expression at genome-wide scale.

Background
The filamentous cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma reesei is
known to be an exceptionally efficient producer of cellulases and hemicellulases acting in synergy to degrade
lignocellulosic materials. T. reesei produces a broad range
of cellulases able to hydrolyze the β-1,4 glycosidic bonds
present in celluloses and derivatives. The glucose produced provides the fungus with a carbon source readily
usable for growth. One of the main applications is the
conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels, such as
ethanol [1]. Due to their biotechnological interest, the
most abundant hydrolytic enzymes of T. reesei have been
the subject of extensive structural [2-6] and genetic studies
(see reviews [7,8]). These enzymes include two cellobiohydrolases (Cel7A and Cel6A, E.C. 3.2.1.91) that act like
exoenzymes, releasing cellobiose from crystalline cellulose as the main product, five endoglucanases (Cel7B,
Cel5A, Cel12A, Cel61A and Cel45A, EC 3.2.1.4) that
attack cellulose in an endo-acting manner with a strong
affinity towards the soluble derivatives of cellulose, and
two β-glucosidases (BGLI and BGLII, EC 3.2.1.21) that
cleave cellobiose to glucose [9]. The hemicellulolytic system of T. reesei is composed of several enzymes, including
endo-1,4-β-xylanases (XYNI, 2, 3 and 4, EC 3.2.1.8), mannanase (MANI, EC 3.2.1.78), acetylxylan esterase (AXEI,
EC 3.1.1.72), α-galactosidase (BGAI, EC 3.2.1.22) and
arabinofuranosidase (ABFI, EC 3.2.1.55) [10-12]. In addition, new biomass degradation-related genes have been
identified through cDNA sequencing and DNA microarrays [13,14].
Cellulases are produced industrially using T. reesei strains
genetically modified by random mutagenesis or by targeted genetic modifications such as introducing strong
inducible promoters, increasing the gene copy numbers or
removing undesired secreted proteins [15]. Industrial
mutant strain CL847 yields a high production (about 40 g
L-1) of proteins secreted in the extracellular medium
[16,17]. Commercial cellulolytic products are generally
poorly characterized enzyme mixtures containing cellulases and other unidentified proteins. The sole 2D maps of
T. reesei secretomes reported in the literature were established from commercial cellulase preparations prior to the
availability of genome sequences [18,19], making it difficult to identify new enzymes. The recent ongoing
sequencing of the T. reesei QM6a strain genome available
from the DOE Joint Genome Institute http://genome.jgipsf.org/Trire2/Trire2.home.html gives an opportunity to
gain a better understanding of the variety of enzymes
secreted by this fungus.
We performed a proteomic study of the enzymes secreted
from T. reesei CL847, which is a strain already used at
industrial scale, grown under conditions promoting the
production of both cellulases and hemicellulases, using

http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/1/1/18

2D electrophoresis (2DE) gels coupled with MALDI-TOF
and LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. The 2D map obtained
was used to compare the secretome composition of
CL847 with that of the well-known cellulase overproducer
Rut-C30 [20] under cellulolytic enzyme secretion-promoting conditions.

Methods
Fungal strain and culture conditions
For storage, T. reesei strains CL847 [21] and Rut-C30
(ATCC 56765) cultures were grown on plates of Potato
Dextrose Agar (Difco Laboratories, USA) at 30°C. After
sporulation, the spores were resuspended in a sterile NaCl
(9 g L-1)-glycerol 20% solution and stored at -80°C. Frozen spores were used to inoculate a Fernbach flask containing 250 mL of culture medium (glucose 30 g L-1; corn
steep 2 g L-1; (NH4)2SO4 1.4 g L-1; KOH 0.8 g L-1; H3PO4
85% 4 mL L-1; phthalic acid, dipotassium salt 5 g L-1;
MgSO4.7H2O 0.3 g L-1; CaCl2 0.3 g L-1; FeSO4.7H2O 5.0
mg L-1; MnSO4.H2O 1.6 mg L-1; ZnSO4.7H2O 1.4 mg L-1;
CoCl2.6H2O 2.0 mg L-1). Cultivation was carried out at
30°C with stirring at 110 rpm. After 72 h, 100 mL of
medium broth was used as an inoculum for bioreactor
culture. Fermentation of T. reesei was carried out in a 4 L
bioreactor under culture conditions previously described
by Pourquié and Warzywoda, 1993 [17]. The cellulase
production was performed in two steps. In the first step, a
growth phase, with 2 L starting medium containing 35 g
L-1 of lactose as carbon source, 27°C and pH regulated at
4.8 (with 6 M ammonia) was conducted. The air flow was
adjusted at 0.5 VVM and initial stirring was set at 500 rpm.
This parameter was gradually increased to maintain pO2
above 40% oxygen saturation. In the second step, when
initial lactose was depleted, a fed-batch phase was initiated. During this phase, a 250 g L-1carbon source solution
was injected at a 4 mL h-1 rate. The feeding solution composed of either 60% lactose and 40% xylose (W/V) or only
lactose. Samples were collected periodically to determine
the biomass, carbon and protein concentrations. For both
strains, the initial lactose was depleted after 30 h of cultivation. At this stage of the culture, the biomass dry weight
concentrations were between 15 to 18 g L-1 and remained
steady during the whole fed-batch phase for all cultures
whatever conditions were tested. No carbon source accumulation was observed during the whole fed-batch phase.

CL847 strain cultivations were performed in triplicate for
the lactose as the only carbon source condition, and in
duplicate for the mixed lactose-xylose condition. Only
one production was carried out for the Rut-C30 strain.
Analytical methods
Lactose was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography on a 7.8 × 300 mm2 HPX-87P column (Biorad)
maintained at 85°C, using a Varian Prostar Model 350

HPLC equipped with a refractive index detector. Eluant
was helium-degassed distilled water at a flow rate of 0.4
mL min-1. Quantification was performed using a solution
of 1 g L-1 of lactose as external standard.
Biomass concentration was assayed using a gravimetric
method. A culture volume is filtered with a vacuum pump
on a dried and preweighed GF/C glass fiber membrane
(Wathman). After washing with distilled water, membranes are dried for 48 h at 105°C and weighed.
Protein extract preparation
Samples were collected around 160 h after start of cultivation. At this stage, protein concentration for all cultures
was around 30 g L-1. The culture supernatants were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,800 g and 4°C.
The supernatants were further clarified on a glass fiber filter GF/F (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) and concentrated
and diafiltered against 10 times their volumes of Milli-Q
water using a 5 kDa membrane (Amicon system, Millipore Bradford, USA) to eliminate salts. Total protein concentrations were determined in duplicates using the BioRad Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of extracellular protein samples were stored at -80°C for 2DE gel
experiments. The same amount of proteins (200 μg) was
used for each 2D gel, regardless for the initial supernatant
concentration.
Protein separation by 2D gel electrophoresis
Immobiline DryStrips (18 cm, pH 4–7, Amersham Biosciences) were rehydrated overnight at room temperature
with 200 μg of proteins diluted in rehydration solution
(DeStreak solution, Amersham Biosciences) supplemented with 2% (v/v) 4–7 IPG buffer and 2.8 mg mL-1
dithiothreitol to a final volume of 350 μL. Isoelectric
focusing was performed on a Multiphor II system at 20°C
with a 3-phase gradient program: 500 V for 1 Vh, 3500 V
for 3 kVh and 3500 V for 27 kVh. Following isoelectric
focusing, each strip was equilibrated for 10 min in 10 mL
of SDS equilibration buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 6 M
urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) SDS, a trace of
bromophenol blue) containing 25 mM dithiothreitol. A
second equilibration step was then performed in the same
SDS equilibration buffer containing 250 mM iodoacetamide instead of DTT. The strips were then loaded onto
12% homogeneous acrylamide gels and sealed with 0.5%
(w/v) agarose in SDS running buffer (25 mM Tris base,
192 mM glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). The second dimensional separation was performed using an Ettan™ DALT
system (Amersham) at 0.5 W/gel and 16°C overnight, followed by 17 W/gel for 3 h. After electrophoresis, the acrylamide gels were either silver-stained for spot picking
experiments or stained with Biosafe Coomassie Stain
(Biorad) for comparative analysis experiments.

Protein identification
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
For protein identification, protein spots were picked up
from the gel and silver-stained spots were washed with
sodium thiosulfate/potassium ferricyanide, as previously
described [22]. All spots were washed, digested by trypsin,
extracted and dried as previously described [23]. Spectra
were acquired on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry Voyager DE-RP (ABI) in positive reflectron mode. Peak list
was generated by DataExplorer and manually checked.
Identifications were performed using GPMAW software
(Lighthouse data).
Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
Spots of protein were excised from a 2D gel and subjected
to in-gel tryptic digestion as above. The resulting peptides
were extracted and subjected to nanoscale reverse-phase
liquid chromatography on a modular LC Packings Ultimate HPLC system equipped with a Famos autosampler
and a Switchos microcolumn switching device (LC Packings – a Dionex company, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
The tryptic digest samples were diluted in an aqueous
solution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and preconcentrated and de-salted at a flow rate of 20 μL min-1 on
a 5 mm × 300 μm PepMap C18 precolumn (100 Å, 5 μm,
LC Packings). The mobile phase flow from pump C was
used to load and wash the sample for 5 min with an aqueous solution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 2%
acetonitrile. The peptides were then eluted onto a 150
mm × 75 μm analytical PepMap C18 column (100 Å, 3
μm, LC Packings). Chromatographic separation used gradient elution of 95% solution A (acetonitrile/water 2:98,
v/v) to 50% solution B (acetonitrile/water 95:5, v/v), both
containing 0.08% formic acid and 0.01% trifluoroacetic
acid, over 40 min at a flow rate of 200 nL min-1. The nanoscale LC eluant from the analytical column was directed to
the nanoelectrospray ionization source of a QSTAR®XL
global hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) run in positive ion mode. A voltage of approximately 2 kV was applied to the spray needle
(Picotip Emitter, 360/10 μm, New Objective, MA, USA).
Mass spectra were acquired with the Analyst 1.1 software
using MS survey for 1 s followed by MS/MS for 3 s. The
instrument was calibrated with a multi-point calibration
using selected fragment ions that resulted from the collision-induced decomposition (CID) of the C-terminal
peptide of β-CN casein 193–209. Data-directed analysis
was employed to perform MS/MS analysis on doubly and
triply charged precursor ions. Product (fragmentation)
ion MS/MS spectra were collected from m/z 60 to m/z
2000. Raw data were automatically analyzed on a local
server hosting Mascot V.2.1.03.

The T. reesei genome database http://www.jgi.doe.gov/
sequencing/why/2998.html was used to identify proteins
from MS/MS data.

Image analysis
For comparative studies, each culture sample was independently prepared and used in 2DE in triplicates. To
allow an unbiased comparative analysis, Coomassie Blue
staining was used instead of silver staining (Biosafe
Coomassie Stain, Biorad). The amount of proteins used
for 2DE (200 μg) and Coomassie Blue staining was the
best compromise between spot-detection sensibility and
coloration saturation (data not shown).

Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Gels were scanned
on a calibrated GS800 scanner (Biorad). Images were analyzed using ImageMaster II software (GE Healthcare)
using the following workflow. After automatic spot detection, artifacts such as dust or cracks on gels were manually
eliminated, and then the weaker spots (individually <
0.05% of the whole gel volume) were eliminated.
Remaining spots were then automatically linked to reference spots on a synthetic reference gel to allow comparison between samples.
Enzymatic assays
All samples were analyzed in duplicate and mean values
were calculated. Overall cellulase activity of the samples
was measured as Filter Paper (FP) activities using the
IUPAC-recommended procedure [24]. Endoglucanase
activity was assayed as CMCase activity with CMC
(Aqualon) as substrate in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.8)
for 30 min at 50°C. Xylanase activity was measured with
Oat Spelt Xylan (Sigma) as substrate in the same conditions. For all three activities, sugar release was assayed via
the dinitrosalicylic acid method using glucose or xylose as
the standard. β-glucosidase activities were determined
using 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside with paranitrophenol as the standard [25].

Results and discussion
2D mapping of T. Reesei CL847 secretome
Cellulase and hemicellulase production is dependent on
fungus cultivation conditions [26]. It has been demonstrated that the production of the main cellulases of Trichoderma is transcriptionally regulated and carbon sourcedependent [8,13]. In order to obtain the fullest complement of the hemicellulolytic enzymatic system, T. reesei
was grown under conditions promoting the production of
both cellulases and hemicellulases. Thus, T. reesei was cultivated on a lactose-xylose medium in fed-batch fermentation, since this medium is known to induce the
production of both cellulases and hemicellulases in T. reesei [27,28].

Total extracellular proteins from the culture supernatant
were separated by 2DE. Preliminary investigations using
pH 3 to 10 IPG strips revealed that most proteins had pIs
< 7. Thus, IPG strips ranging from pH 4 to 7 were chosen

http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/1/1/18

for detailed expression analyses to improve the resolution
of the proteins spots and facilitate further quantification
of individual protein species. The resulting protein maps
are shown in Figure 1. Ninety-five distinct protein spots
were detected on the 2D gel after staining. The distribution of the protein spots showed that most strongly
secreted proteins had an isoelectric point below 6 and a
molecular weight above 43 kDa.
Among the 95 protein spots, 36 were identified by
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Table 1). To increase the
amount of identified proteins, 18 additional spots were
analyzed by nanoLC-MS-MS, resulting in the identification of nine further proteins (Table 2). Absence of reliable
identification of the remaining protein spots is due to
small amounts of biological material and/or post-translational modifications known to affect identification [18].
In most cases, molecular masses observed on 2D gels were
higher than the expected masses calculated from the protein sequences, probably because of glycosylation. Several
protein spots were assigned to the same protein, suggesting the presence of numerous isoforms and/or degraded
forms (Tables 1 and 2).
As expected, most of the identified proteins were related
to biomass degradation and were assigned to cellulases
and hemicellulases. Cellobiohydrolases Cel7A and Cel6A
were the two most abundantly secreted proteins. These
proteins are known to account for 70 to 80% of the total
T. reesei cellulases [4,29], consistent with the high intensity of the corresponding protein spots observed on the
gel. The only β-glucosidase identified on the gel was BGLI,
in accordance with reports of the other β-glucosidases
being either intra-cellular, membrane-anchored, or playing only a minor role in cellulose hydrolysis [6]. Four out
of the five known endoglucanases were also identified,
but one of them, endoglucanase Cel61A, was only identified with a single peptide and thus should be considered
provisional (Table 2). The minor endoglucanase Cel45A
of T. reesei [30] was not identified, probably because of its
highly acidic pI. This secretome analysis also revealed the
expression of the ORF_27554 product annotated as candidate endoglucanase in the T. reesei genome database. The
similarity between the observed and predicted molecular
weight for this new endoglucanase (Table 1) suggests that
this protein is only sparsely glycosylated. In addition, the
product of the gene cel74a [6] was detected on the protein
map. This enzyme, formerly endoglucanase VI, has been
characterized as a xyloglucanase. The observation that several spots matched to this protein supports previous data
that there are multiple isoforms of this enzyme [31].
We also identified some major components of the hemicellulolytic system of T. reesei: β-xylosidases, xylanases
and arabinofuranosidase (Table 1). Three out of the four

sponded to one of the minor unidentified spots. The
present study highlights the production of a putative arabinofuranosidase (ORF_55319, ABFIII Table 1). As stated
previously for the putative endoglucanase, the close correlation between the observed and predicted molecular
weight of this putative arabinofuranosidase suggests that
this enzyme is also sparsely glycosylated. T. reesei is thus
able to produce at least three different arabinofuranosidases. Two of them have already been described in a purification study (ABFI) [33] and in cDNA analysis (ABFII)
[13]. This work provides evidence for the production of
both ABFII and a novel third α-L-arabinofuranosidase
(ORF_55319, ABFIII) not reported previously. Apart from
cellulases and hemicellulases, non-hydrolytic proteins
including CIPI, CIPII and swollenin were identified

(Table 2), providing new evidence for the production and
secretion of these proteins. CIPI and CIPII were discovered during the T. reesei genome sequencing program as
proteins with a cellulose-binding domain, but no other
functional domain, such as a glycosyl hydrolase domain,
could be found [13]. However, a recent phylogenetic analysis suggests they share close relationships with cellulases,
which adds support to the potential roles of these genes in
biomass degradation [14]. Proteolytic enzymes such as
trypsin were also found at low levels (0.2%). This may
explain the presence of some altered proteins, especially
Cel6A, whose molecular weight in the gels was lower than
expected (Figure 1). Heterogeneity of cellobiohydrolases
on PAGE-SDS has already been reported, and explained
by glycosylation and proteolysis [19].

In total, 22 biomass-degrading enzymes were identified
on our gels, to be compared with the previous study of
Vinzant et al (2001) [19] where only 10 enzymes were
identified. An analysis of the lactose-xylose 2D gel image
by ImageMaster II software indicated that the identified
proteins account for 83% of all visible proteins in the gel
in terms of spot volume. This percentage rises to 93% for
the secretome of T. reesei CL847 grown on lactose alone.
Comparison between secretomes of CL847 and Rut-C30
produced on lactose
Rut-C30 has for decades been the reference cellulase-overproducing strain in academic publications. This strain,
like CL847, has been obtained through random mutagenesis and subsequent screening. The last common ancestor
of these two strains is the reference T. reesei strain QM6a.

CL847 was further evolved from strain QM9414. Enzymatic activities vary significantly between these two
strains (Table 3). In the same culture conditions, Rut-C30
has a slightly higher FPase and CMCase-specific activity,
while xylanase and β-glucosidase activities are significantly higher for CL847 strain (respectively ×2.7 and
×1.5). Two mutations were identified in Rut-C30. Firstly,
a mutation in cre1, a gene encoding a transcription factor
mediating glucose repression for cellulase production was
discovered. This frameshift mutation leads to a truncated
protein that might account for some increase in cellulase
production in this strain [34]. Secondly, a frameshift
mutation was observed for glucosidase II alpha subunit,
leading to defective extracellular protein glycosylation
[35]. However, it is almost certain that these are not the
only mutations affecting this strain. As Rut-C30 grown on

lactose and xylose failed to produce cellulases, secretomes
of Rut-C30 and CL847 were produced with lactose as the
only carbon source.
As for proteome map construction, samples were taken
during the late fed-batch production phase (around 160
h) for each sample. At this stage of the production, protein
concentrations were around 30 g L-1 for both strains.
The 2DE profiles of CL847 and Rut-C30 grown on lactose
were very different, in terms of both spot numbers and
protein composition (Figure 2). CL847 2DE reveals many
more protein spots that Rut-C30, especially in minor
spots corresponding to less than 0.5% of total spots volume (Figure 3), and consequently most of these spots are
unidentified or correspond to degradation forms absent
in Rut-C30. Differences in protein spots representing a
higher percentage of the total spot volume are due to the
presence of several Cel7A isoforms for CL847, while a single and bigger spot is visible for Rut-C30. In contrast,
Cel6A isoform profiles were similar. Protein spot quantitation revealed that Rut-C30 has 10% more total cellobiohydrolases than CL847 (Figure 4A). This is related to a
higher Cel7A level in this strain (57.4% in Rut-C30 versus

42.1% in CL847), since Cel6A levels were not significantly
different between the two strains. As a consequence, the
Cel7A-to-Cel6A ratio is much higher in Rut-C30 than in
CL847 (Figure 4B). This is in disagreement with the widespread hypothesis that Cel7A and Cel6A are co-regulated
[16,36]. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility
that this change in ratio could be due to a higher level of
degradation of Cel7A in CL847. In contrast with cellobiohydrolases levels, the relative amount of BGLI produced
by CL847 is twice as much as compared to Rut-C30 (Figure 4D), which is reflected in β-glucosidases activities for
these strains in similar conditions (Table 3). No significant differences were observed for endoglucanases Cel7B
and Cel5A. However, this area of the gels is heavily
crowded, especially for CL847, and any quantification
must be taken with caution (Figure 2). Contrast was more
pronounced for minor endoglucanases. CL847 produces
around 2% Cel12A, while it is almost undetectable in RutC30 samples. Cel61A and Cel74A levels were much
higher in Rut-C30 (Figure 4C). These results contrast with
those of Foreman et al (2003) [13], where endoglucanase
co-expression was observed at the mRNA level, prompting
the authors to propose co-regulation of these enzymes.
We observed no such events at protein level, but the dif-

Differences between the two strains can be related to both small spots, which are more abundant in CL847, and isoforms,

ferences may be due to the different strains and culture
conditions used in our work and Foreman's. Another
point to highlight is that the EGL and AXEIII are also
absent in the both strains cultivated on lactose. The βxylosidase, BXLI, is only present in Rut-C30, although at a
very low percentage (0.2%). This is consistent with reports
of a low constitutive expression of the BXLI protein in RutC30 [10]. The only xylanase expressed in Rut-C30 was
XYNIV, secreted at a similar level to CL847 (Figure 4F). In
contrast, in CL847, XYNIV only figured as one of the
minor xylanases. This suggests that expression of xylanases XYNI, XYNII and XYNIV is different in the two studied Trichoderma strains and that these different expression
pathways were not equally affected by the mutations that
led to the CL847 and Rut-C30 phenotypes. Globally, RutC30 has a lower xylan-related enzyme secretion while
CL847 secretes a more diversified set of enzymes. Other
hemicellulase levels also showed marked differences.
While ABFII levels were comparable and ABFIII level was
tenfold higher in CL847, ABFI was slightly over-produced
in Rut-C30 (Figure 4E). As for xylanases, the results suggest that the role of these proteins is not equivalent and
that they are not co-regulated. The only mannanase of T.
reesei was expressed twice more in CL847 than in Rut-C30
(Figure 4E). Among non-cellulolytic enzymes, except for

the absence of CIPII, there was no significant detectable
difference in CIPI and SWO. Finally, trypsin was absent in
Rut-C30. The presence of proteases may explain the observation of degraded forms of proteins in CL847 and the
much higher number of spots, especially in the low
molecular weight region of the gels.
These results fit nicely with data obtained from specific
enzymatic activities (Table 3): the lower FPase activity in
CL847 can be related to the lower amount of cellobiohydrolases in this strain. While it is difficult to link the
CMCase activity differences to any specific protein, since
many enzymes exhibit endoglucanase activity, the higher
β-glucosidase and xylanase specific activities are consistent with the higher BGLI and xylanases activities in the
CL847 cellulase productions (Figure 4).

Conclusion
A total of 22 extracellular protein species of T. reesei was
identified. Most of the corresponding proteins were
involved in lignocellulose degradation. In addition to the
reference map of the secreted proteins, we describe hitherto unreported experimental evidence of the expression
of a new putative endoglucanase and a new putative arabinofuranosidase.

The last common ancestor of CL847 and Rut-C30 is the
originally isolated strain QM6a. This secretome study
shows that mutagenesis, in addition to improving the
secretion capacities of cellulases, also seems to lead to different enzyme cocktail compositions. The more diversified secretome of CL847 suggests that this strain may be a
more general hypersecretory strain while Rut-C30 may be
more cellulase-oriented. It suggests that Rut-C30 and

CL847 were obtained using a totally different 'mutation
route' towards becoming efficient producers. On the
genetic regulation level, the only known transcription factors are the XYRI and ACEII activators and the CREI and
ACEI repressors [8], all of which act at global level. Contrasts in secretome profiles, such as those observed in
CL847 and Rut-C30 in this research, could potentially be
attributed to chromosomal rearrangements or chromatin

structure [35], making it particularly tricky to identify the
mutations involved without extensive genomic investigation. Moreover, studying secretomes produced in different
conditions for the same strains will provide greater insight
into secretion behavior and cellulase regulation.
