Abstract
Background: Evolutionary relationships among the 11 extant orders of insects that undergo complete
metamorphosis, called Holometabola, remain either unresolved or contentious, but are extremely
important as a context for accurate comparative biology of insect model organisms. The most
phylogenetically enigmatic holometabolan insects are Strepsiptera or twisted wing parasites, whose
evolutionary relationship to any other insect order is unconfirmed. They have been controversially
proposed as the closest relatives of the flies, based on rDNA, and a possible homeotic transformation in
the common ancestor of both groups that would make the reduced forewings of Strepsiptera homologous
to the reduced hindwings of Diptera. Here we present evidence from nucleotide sequences of six singlecopy nuclear protein coding genes used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and estimate
evolutionary divergence times for all holometabolan orders.
Results: Our results strongly support Hymenoptera as the earliest branching holometabolan lineage, the
monophyly of the extant orders, including the fleas, and traditionally recognized groupings of
Neuropteroidea and Mecopterida. Most significantly, we find strong support for a close relationship
between Coleoptera (beetles) and Strepsiptera, a previously proposed, but analytically controversial
relationship. Exploratory analyses reveal that this relationship cannot be explained by long-branch
attraction or other systematic biases. Bayesian divergence times analysis, with reference to specific fossil
constraints, places the origin of Holometabola in the Carboniferous (355 Ma), a date significantly older
than previous paleontological and morphological phylogenetic reconstructions. The origin and
diversification of most extant insect orders began in the Triassic, but flourished in the Jurassic, with
multiple adaptive radiations producing the astounding diversity of insect species for which these groups
are so well known.
Conclusion: These findings provide the most complete evolutionary framework for future comparative
studies on holometabolous model organisms and contribute strong evidence for the resolution of the
'Strepsiptera problem', a long-standing and hotly debated issue in insect phylogenetics.

Background
Insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, collectively known as Holometabola, represent the vast majority of animal life on Earth. There are close to 1 million
named species of insects [1], and the most reliable estimates suggest that the global total is between 5 and 10
million species [2,3]. Holometabola are by far the most
successful group of insects, and comprise just over 80% of
the named species. As far as we know, this represents
about 50% of all animal diversity [4]. Understanding the
relationships of the major lineages, or orders, of holometabolous insects has been a great challenge, not least
because of their megadiversity, and represents one of the
truly significant challenges of systematic biology.
The life history of holometabolous insects is divided into
discrete developmental stages, including a distinct larval
(feeding) and pupal (quiescent) stage. Most of the speciesrichness of this group is found in the four largest orders of
insects: Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (bees, ants,
and wasps), Diptera (true flies), and Lepidoptera (moths
and butterflies), in addition to seven smaller orders: Neuroptera (lacewings), Megaloptera (dobsonflies and alderflies),
Raphidioptera
(snakeflies),
Trichoptera
(caddisflies), Mecoptera (scorpionflies), Siphonaptera
(fleas), and Strepsiptera (twisted-wing parasites). Important model species such as Drosophila melanogaster, Apis
mellifera (honey bee), Bombyx mori (silkworm) and Tribolium castaneum (flour beetle) are members of Holometabola and understanding evolutionary relationships within
this diverse insect radiation is increasingly critical for
comparative studies in genomics, development, and evolutionary biology.
The monophyly of the orders included in Holometabola
(also known as the Endopterygota) is well established,
with the exception of Mecoptera, which in some molecular analyses is rendered paraphyletic due to the inclusion
of the fleas [5,6]. There is, however, less unanimity regarding the relationships between the orders. Traditional morphological hypotheses and emerging molecular results
have converged on the division of Holometabola into two
major lineages, Neuropteroidea, which includes Coleoptera + Neuropterida (Neuroptera, Megaloptera, and
Raphidioptera), and Mecopterida (= Panorpida), including Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, Diptera, Mecoptera, and
Siphonaptera [7,8]. Evidence on holometabolan phylogeny is both limited and controversial. Identification of the
earliest branching extant holometabolan lineages, and
resolution of the phylogenetic positions of Hymenoptera
and the unusual order Strepsiptera, remains among the
most disputed issues in insect phylogeny.
Hymenoptera and Strepsiptera have been placed in various positions in the holometabolan tree, the former most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/34

often placed as sister to Mecopterida and the latter traditionally included either within, or as sister to, Coleoptera
[9,10]. The consensus view is that most morphological
features of Hymenoptera and Strepsiptera are too highly
modified to unequivocally resolve their phylogenetic
positions [11,12]. Thus the placement of these two orders
will necessarily rely on the use of molecular data. However, the conflicting results of the molecular studies completed to date contribute to the indeterminate nature of
their evolutionary relationships. Two recent phylogenomics projects, with limited taxon sampling but including
large numbers of genes, addressed the placement of
Hymenoptera; mitochondrial genomes provide evidence
for a sister group relationship between Hymenoptera and
Mecopterida [13], while combined analysis of 185
nuclear genes shows strong support for Hymenoptera as
the earliest branching holometabolan lineage, sister to all
other orders [14].
Most other molecular analyses of holometabolan phylogeny rely on ribosomal DNA, and the results have been
highly dependent on taxon sampling, alignment, and
method of analysis [5,15-18]. The most provocative rDNA
results involve Strepsiptera, a small (600 spp.) enigmatic
order that maintains a degree of phylogenetic ambiguity
that is unique amongst insects. Their affinity to any other
order is unconfirmed, and until relatively recently, even
their inclusion in Holometabola was questioned [19,20].
Strepsipterans are endoparasites of other insects, with
free-living males and eyeless, larviform, viviparous
females that remain inside their host (with the exception
of members of the family Mengenillidae). Ribosomal
DNA analyses show support for a sister group relationship
between Diptera (true flies) and Strepsiptera, united in a
clade called Halteria [5,17,21-24]. Dipterans and strepsipterans both possess halteres, paired knob-like structures that are homologous to wings, although dipteran
halteres are found on the third thoracic segment, in place
of hindwings, while strepsipteran halteres are on the second thoracic segment, in place of forewings. The initial
18S findings implied that a homeotic mutation, similar to
those documented in laboratory studies with the ultrabithorax gene (Ubx) in Drosophila melanogaster [25], could
have been responsible for the differing wing arrangement
found in the two orders [21]; however, no supporting
genetic evidence for this transformation has since been
found [8,26]. Additionally, all of the morphological characters that unite Mecopterida and Antliophora (in which
Halteria would be included) are lacking or inapplicable in
Strepsiptera [7,8,24]. The Halteria concept also contradicts traditional interpretations of morphological characters uniting Strepsiptera and Coleoptera based on
structural modifications due to posteromotorism or hindwing-powered flight [7].

Subsequent reanalyses of 18S data along with additional
ribosomal DNA sequences resulted in the 'Strepsiptera
problem' becoming the best known empirical example of
long-branch attraction [27-30]. In a 1999 review of
holometabolan phylogeny, Kristensen [8] stated that if
further evidence supports Halteria, the hypothesis will be
considered one of the 'most spectacular contributions of
molecular characters to systematic zoology'. No additional multi-gene phylogenetic analyses have yet been
completed to address the Strepsiptera question, but three
additional molecular studies, one that examined an
engrailed homeobox intron [26], and two that investigated the structure and evolutionary rate dynamics of
ecdysone receptor and ultraspiracle proteins [31,32],
failed to find any evidence of a close relationship between
Diptera and Strepsiptera.

with Siphonaptera as its sister group. Hymenoptera are
the basal-most branching lineage, concordant with the
phylogenomic findings of Savard et al. [14]. The enigmatic
Strepsiptera are unequivocally placed as the sister group to
Coleoptera, providing additional evidence for the traditional morphological placement of the twisted-wing parasites. In accordance with previous morphological and
molecular hypotheses, our study finds Holometabola to
be divided into two major lineages, Neuropteroidea and
Mecopterida. Within these two lineages, the traditional
respective supra-ordinal groupings are recovered; Neuropteroidea includes Coleoptera, Strepsiptera, and Neuropterida (Neuroptera, Megaloptera, and Raphidioptera),
and Mecopterida includes Amphiesmenoptera (Lepidoptera and Trichoptera) + Antliophora (Diptera, Mecoptera,
and Siphonaptera).

Palaeontological and phylogenetic evidence suggest an
origin for Holometabola in the late Carboniferous (318300 Ma) [1,32,33], but definitive fossil evidence is lacking
until the Permian (280 Ma), a time when most of the
extant orders had their origins [1]. An insect gall, presumed to be from a member of Holometabola, has been
identified from the Late Pennsylvanian (302 Ma), that if
accurately diagnosed provides the earliest physical evidence of their existence [34]. A molecular analysis that
relied on mitochondrial data (cox1) and maximum likelihood (ML) global and local molecular clocks to date the
origin of the insects included both dipterans and lepidopterans, and found the origin of this taxon-limited Holometabola to be between 338 Ma and 351.4 Ma [35].

It appears that the use of nuclear protein-coding genes, six
in our study and 185 in Savard et al. [14], has brought
decisive and robust results to the previously obscured
phylogenetic placement of Hymenoptera. Most previous
morphological hypotheses favored a sister group relationship between Hymenoptera and Mecopterida, although
strong supporting evidence was lacking [7,8]. Mitochondrial genomes also favor the Hymenoptera + Mecopterida
relationship, although not definitively, as the authors suggest that another 'plausible alternative placement is at the
base of Holometabola' [13]. 18S rDNA paradoxically supports both previously mentioned and novel Hymenoptera
hypotheses depending on alignment strategy and taxon
sampling [5,15,22]. Our results constitute the tipping
point of the compounding evidence (extensive sample of
nuclear genes, fossil evidence, wing characters, and
introns of elongation factor 1-alpha) that Hymenoptera
are the earliest branching lineage of the holometabolan
radiation [14,37-41].

To further resolve the evolutionary relationships of
Holometabola and to clarify specifically the sister group
to Diptera, we provide the first phylogenetic analysis to
include multiple nuclear genes and representative taxa
from all 11 holometabolous orders. rRNAs analyzed in
previous studies were not included specifically to avoid
documented biases due to alignment, long branches,
compositional bias, and the unusual, divergent nature of
strepsipteran rRNA [15,36,51]. Our new molecular phylogenetic data are also used to provide divergence time estimates that reveal the range of most likely dates in earth
history for the origin and subsequent diversification of the
extant lineages of holometabolous insects.

Results and discussion
We analyzed six nuclear genes (AATS, CAD, TPI, SNF,
PGD, and RNA POL II), comprising 5736 base pairs (bp),
to infer the phylogeny of 29 species representing all 11
holometabolous orders and two hemimetabolous insect
outgroups (see Table 1). ML and Bayesian (BI) analyses
yielded congruent trees with high posterior probabilities
and mixed bootstrap values (Figures 1 and 2). All orders
were found to be monophyletic, including Mecoptera

Currently, the hypothesis that fleas are actually members
of the scorpionfly order Mecoptera has gained wide
acceptance [5-7]. Analyses based on morphology, ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA have strongly supported
the collapse of the Siphonaptera and their inclusion
within the Mecoptera as the sister group to the wingless
family of snow scorpionflies, Boreidae [5-7]. Our data
provide no indication of a close relationship between
fleas and boreids. We found the traditional grouping of
Mecoptera, with the exclusion of the fleas, to be highly
supported in our analyses. No variation of taxon sampling, character inclusion, or methodology resulted in the
placement of the fleas within Mecoptera. Our results suggest that the morphological characters grouping the fleas
and the boreids, such as wing reduction and characters of
oogenesis, be further investigated [7].

The controversial placement of Strepsiptera has been the
subject of much debate, particularly in regard to whether
strepsipterans are affected by a methodological artifact
known as long-branch attraction (LBA). LBA is an analytical phenomenon in phylogenetic studies in which rapidly evolving sequences cluster counter to their true
evolutionary history due to non-inherited similarity of
rapidly accumulating mutations in independent lineages.
Theoretical demonstrations of LBA identify it as a particularly difficult problem for parsimony analyses [42,43] in

which the interpretation of shared derived features are
maximized as the basis for explaining common ancestry
[44,45]. Model-based approaches, such as ML and BI
methods, make corrections for the increased chance of
spurious grouping in these lineages by including information about the probability of specific changes along a
branch of the tree into the analysis. However, molecular
models are still widely considered to be under-developed
and model-based methods can still be subject to long-

branch grouping errors due to the unpredictability of evolutionary rates [46-48].
Halteria, as supported by 18S rDNA, is often cited as the
first empirical evidence for LBA and initiated the development and use of parametric simulation as a statistical test
for detecting LBA [28]. Both flies and strepsipterans have
exhibited 'long' branches in previous 18S analyses. Similarly, in our current study one strepsipteran has a uniquely
long branch, and the taxon with the next longest branch is
the coleopteran Tribolium. To address the possibility that

in our analyses the Strepsiptera + Coleoptera relationship
is a spurious artifact due to LBA, we thoroughly examined
our data and modified our analyses to detect and potentially rectify effects of LBA.
Although LBA is a well-documented phenomenon, its
precise detection is a challenge [28,29]. Currently, the
retrieval of conflicting results from maximum parsimony
(MP) and ML, parametric simulation, and the visualization of conflict in a dataset can all provide suggestive evidence that LBA may be affecting an analysis [48,49]. Our

Page 8 of 16

BMC Biology 2009, 7:34

parsimony trees agree with the topology generated by
both ML and BI, a finding not suggestive of LBA.
Parametric simulation, a method developed by Huelsenbeck [29] to test the rDNA-based Halteria findings for
LBA, can provide statistical support that branches are long
enough to attract. In a procedure similar to a parametric
bootstrap, simulated datasets are generated according to a
tree in which taxa with elevated rates of evolution are separated in the topology; in this case, the strepsipterans are
separated from the coleopterans and constrained to the
base of Holometabola. The simulated datasets are then
analyzed to determine whether the putative longbranched taxa will cluster counter to their placement in
the tree on which the data were simulated. If Strepsiptera
and Coleoptera consistently form a clade in analyses of
the simulated datasets, we would conclude that grouping
to be the result of LBA. None of our 100 ML analyses of
the simulated data resulted in the attraction of longbranched strepsipterans and coleopterans to each other.
This finding signifies that in our dataset, in contrast to the
original rDNA data, there is no statistical evidence to suggest that the rates of evolution in the strepsipteran and
coleopteran branches are sufficiently elevated to attract
each other, counter to their accurate (simulated) evolutionary placement.
In contrast to other methods that are implemented postanalysis, visualizing conflict in a dataset can be used to
identify the potential for LBA prior to analysis [50]. A
dataset likely to be affected by LBA should exhibit conflicting signal supporting both the artifactual relationship and
the actual evolutionary relationship. We utilized two visualization methods, likelihood mapping and neighbornets, and our results were not definitive. Likelihood mapping, a quartet puzzling method, showed little conflict
(revealed by only 0.4% of unresolved quartets while 10%
to 15% is considered high) (Figure 3a). However, our
neighbor-net analysis, a network showing all compatible
and incompatible splits, did show conflicting signal
throughout our dataset (Figure 4). The conflicting splits
exist across many regions of the tree, not just regarding
Strepsiptera, indicating that there is no reason to suspect
LBA in regards to Strepsiptera more than other clades. Yet
when a network including Strepsiptera is directly compared with a network with Strepsiptera excluded, it is evident that the conflict in this dataset is substantially
alleviated by the absence of the strepsipterans, particularly
in respect to the reticulation at the base of Diptera. This is
not a clear sign of LBA, but it does suggest that there is
conflicting support for the placement of Strepsiptera and
their relationship to Diptera.
To explore further the potential for LBA identified by the
neighbor-net, we utilized a four- cluster likelihood map-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/34

ping analysis to again visualize the degree of conflicting
signal regarding the placement of Strepsiptera. We divided
the taxa into four clusters: (1) Neuropteroidea (which
includes Coleoptera); (2) Mecopterida (which includes
Diptera); (3) Hymenoptera; (4) Strepsiptera. The possible
relationships between these four clades generate three
possible topologies, each represented by a tip of the triangle. This quartet puzzling method plots the probability of
each possible quartet closest to the topology that it favors.
Each region of the triangle or 'basin of attraction' contains
a percentage of quartets that support a particular topology. This analysis again reveals the conflicting signal in
our dataset and shows that we have signal supporting all
three hypotheses regarding the placement of Strepsiptera,
with slightly more support in this analysis for a close relationship of Strepsiptera and Mecopterida (including the
flies) (Figure 3b).
Though our concatenated dataset clearly results in the
placement of Strepsiptera with Coleoptera in MP, ML, and
BI, there is evidence that some signal supports a closer
relationship between Strepsiptera and Diptera. To determine the source of this conflicting signal, we examined
ML analyses of the six individual gene trees. Data contributing phylogenetic information for the placement of
Strepsiptera is available for five out of six genes, and three
out of those five genes place Strepsiptera within the close
vicinity of Coleoptera or Neuropterida. The gene tree for
CAD, however, recovers Halteria, with Strepsiptera as the
sister group to Diptera. At 2000 bp, CAD is the longest
gene in the dataset and in recent years has become a staple
for resolving Mesozoic-age divergences among flies. The
topology of the CAD ML tree reveals that Diptera and
Strepsiptera all have the longest branches in the tree, similar to the initial 18S findings, suggesting the possibility
that LBA may play a role in the CAD recovery of Halteria.
It has been hypothesized that Diptera have experienced
accelerated evolution in comparison to other insects [52],
and by observing their long branches in various datasets
we can surmise that Strepsiptera may have as well. Rapid
evolution in specific loci, such as 18S and CAD, could lead
to LBA and the erroneous grouping of Diptera and Strepsiptera. The reliance on a single locus for phylogenetic resolution, though useful in some circumstances, can clearly
result in inaccurate conclusions. No single gene in our
dataset recovers our well-supported phylogeny that is congruent to morphological hypotheses. Our phylogeny
relies on the concatenation of all six genes to overcome
the misleading signal in CAD placing Strepsiptera as the
sister group to Diptera.
Our findings are robust over multiple phylogenetic methods intended to counter LBA including: the removal of
third positions, RY coding of first and third positions, the
removal of out-groups and long branches, and the use of

a conservative alignment (with fast evolving positions
removed by the program Gblocks [49,50,52] (Table 2). In
light of the fact that our many attempts to identify or
ameliorate LBA did not result in a positive detection of
LBA or a change in our results, we concluded that the
Strepsiptera + Coleoptera relationship is not a clear case of
systematic error due to LBA. Our study is the first to rely
on multiple genes to re-address the placement of Strepsiptera and our robust findings should reignite the debate
regarding the morphologically dissimilar orders Strepsiptera and Diptera as sister groups. In light of our findings, upcoming work involving much larger genomic
datasets (S. Longhorn, pers. comm.), and the re-examination of existing morphological characters shared by strepsipterans and beetles [7], we anticipate that the
phylogenetic placement of Strepsiptera will cease to be
considered the most controversial issue in holometabolan
phylogenetics.
We used the concatenated nucleotide sequence data for all
six genes, the BI phylogenetic tree topology of Figure 1,
and several fossil-based minimum age constraints to estimate divergence times for major holometabolous lineages
using the relaxed clock BI method implemented in the
programs Estbranches and Multidivtime [53]. Congruent
to the findings of Gaunt and Miles [35], multiple nuclear
genes place the origin of Holometabola around 355 Ma,

within the Carboniferous, but substantially earlier than
traditional estimates and older than any clearly assignable
holometabolan fossil (Figure 1).
As the earliest branching lineage in the phylogeny, the
Hymenoptera originate just after the mean estimated age
for Holometabola. This date is considerably older than
existing fossil estimates (an increasingly common feature
of most molecule-based divergence time estimates), a pattern suggesting either an incomplete fossil record, biases
in parameter choice, model mis-specification, or some
combination of these [54]. The split between the two
major sub-clades Neuropteroidea and Mecopterida took
place just within the Permian (300 Ma), with the
Amphiesmenoptera/Antliophora diverging at 284 Ma.
The origins of the extant holometabolous orders (excluding the Hymenoptera) appear to have occurred in relatively rapid succession, with dates of origin falling in the
range of approximately 274 Ma to 213 Ma; the earliest
divergences were the Coleoptera/Strepsiptera (274 Ma),
while the most recent were the Raphidioptera and Megaloptera, splitting at 213 Ma. According to current evidence, Diptera and Mecoptera + Siphonaptera last shared
a recent common ancestor approximately 256 Ma.
Though some of our findings for the mean age of origin
do not precisely correspond with traditional ages based
on fossils, most of the published fossil-based values do

These variations on taxon and character inclusion (with the exception of the inclusion of third positions) are cited as a means to rectify the effects
of long-branch attraction. Clade recovery from these various methods is substantially in agreement with each other and with our final results.

fall within the 95% posterior probability range interval for
our molecule-based estimates. Additionally, the insect
fossil record is currently dramatically expanding
[1,55,56], and thus, better fossil calibrations coupled with
larger samples of genes and taxa, as well as improved analytical methods, should continue to sharpen divergence
time estimates for the major holometabolous clades.
Molecular divergence time estimates and fossils agree that
Holometabola had its origins within the Paleozoic, most
likely in the late Carboniferous. The subsequent origins of
the extant orders (excluding Hymenoptera) took place
primarily within the Triassic, with primary splits occurring
at the end of the Permian, and with the crown group
diversification of many orders beginning in the early
Jurassic. Most explanations for the enormous species
diversity of holometabolous insect clades that have dominated the earth's terrestrial ecosystems since the Jurassic
feature 'key innovations', such as adaptations associated
with feeding on vascular plants, separation of adult, larval, and pupal stages, or morphological developments
like the 'wasp waist', beetle elytron, and fly puparium
[8,57-59]. Ultimately, these disparate adaptations seem to
have had similar macro-evolutionary effects repeated
widely across holometabolous groups; they allowed specific clades to exploit the resources provided by an increasingly complex environment and rapidly speciate in an
expanding arena of biological interactions, undoubtedly
propelled in many cases by flowering plant diversification
[57,58,60]. The testing of key innovation hypotheses to
explain the prodigious diversity of holometabolous
insects remains a major task of insect phylogenetic
research [33,59,61], but extreme diversity has made it difficult to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the
major lineages. Consequently, conflicting lines of evidence will continue to make holometabolan phylogeny
one of the most important, and revisited questions in
insect phylogenetics.

Methods
Taxa sampled, DNA extraction, amplification and
sequencing
A total of 29 taxa representing the 11 holometabolous
orders and two hemimetabolous out-groups were sampled for sequence data from six nuclear protein-coding
genes: CAD, AATS, TPI, RNA POL II, SNF, and PGD (Table
1). Taxonomic information and Genbank accession numbers are available in Table 1 and nucleotide alignments
are deposited in TreeBase http://www.treebase.org.
Sequence alignments and trees are available for download
from Treebase.org. Genomic DNA was extracted using the
DNeasy DNA extraction kit and the RNA extraction kit
(real time – polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) (QIAGEN
Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The standard protocol was
altered by extending the amount of time the specimen was
in the proteinase K solution to 2 days in order to allow
enzymes to penetrate the cuticle without grinding the
specimen. Final elution was reduced to 30 μl to avoid
diluting the DNA solution. Genes were amplified and
sequenced using degenerate primers designed by Moulton
[62] for CAD and by JWK for the remaining five genes.
PCR parameters varied for the six genes, but followed typical three-step reaction protocols (available on request
from BMW). PCR products were extracted from agarose
gels and purified with the Qiaquick Gel Extraction kit
(Qiagen, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Big Dye Sequencing kits
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were used for
sequencing reactions and sequencing was completed at
the North Carolina State University, Genomic Sciences
Laboratory. Sequences were assembled and edited using
Sequencher 4.1 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Alignment was carried out manually according to the
amino acid translation using Se-Al 2.0 [63]. Introns and
other positions of ambiguous alignment were removed
from the analysis. To detect existing base compositional
bias, a chi-square test of homogeneity of base frequencies
across taxa was performed for the concatenated dataset
using Tree Puzzle [64].

Conclusion
A new and taxonomically complete phylogenetic hypothesis for the relationships among holometabolous insect
orders is presented based on six nuclear protein-coding
genes. This evolutionary framework provides a critical
foundation for comparative studies of insect model
organisms. We have also added to the growing debate
regarding the phylogenetic placement of Strepsiptera by
providing the first molecular evidence that they are close
relatives of beetles. The extensive analyses confirmed that
the placement of Strepsiptera is not a methodological artifact, as previously proposed in other studies. Divergence
time estimates show that the Holometabola emerged in
the Carboniferous, while the spectacular radiations of the
primary groups that exist today, wasps and bees, beetles,
butterflies and flies, occurred in the Triassic.

Phylogenetic analyses
MP, ML, and BI analyses were completed with all positions included, third positions excluded, third positions
RY coded (purine/pyrimidine coding), first and third
positions RY coded, as amino acids, and of each independent gene with the third positions removed. In addition, a conservative alignment was generated in the
program GBlocks, which identifies and removes areas of
ambiguous alignment from the dataset [52] and analyzed
with MP, ML, and BI. The following exploratory analyses
with adjusted taxon sampling were completed with third
positions removed: the removal of taxa with base composition bias, strepsipterans removed, coleopterans
removed, and out-groups removed. These variations on

character and taxon inclusion have all been suggested as
means to rectify LBA [49,65].
MP analyses
MP analyses were done using Paup* 4.0b10 [66]. Heuristic searches with tree bisection-reconnection branch swapping and 100 random addition replicates were completed
to find the shortest trees. Node support was obtained by
acquiring bootstrap values from heuristic searches of 500
re-sampled datasets and 10 random addition replicates.
BI analyses
An appropriate model of nucleotide evolution, in this case
GTR + I + G, was chosen by using Mr.Modeltest [67].
Using MrBayes [68,69], analyses were conducted for 5
million generations, trees sampled every 1000, with the
first 25% discarded as burn-in. For nucleotide analyses,
the model GTR + I + G was used with each gene treated as
a separate partition; however, when third positions were
included, each codon position was treated as a separate
partition. For amino acid analyses, the WAG model [70]
and a mixed model [71] were used, with each gene treated
as a separate partition.
ML analyses
ML analyses were performed using Garli [72] with a GTR
+ I + G model for nucleotides and the WAG model for
amino acids. To obtain bootstrap values, 500 bootstrap
replicates were performed.
Conflict visualization
In order to visualize conflicting phylogenetic signal in our
dataset, likelihood mapping and four-cluster likelihood
mapping analyses were completed using the program Tree
Puzzle [64]. Analyses of 10,000 quartets were completed
using quartet sampling and a neighbor-joining tree with
exact parameter estimates and a GTR + I + G model of substitution. To generate neighbor-nets, we analyzed a Paup*
[66] generated matrix of ML inferred distances in the program SplitsTree [73]. Neighbor-nets were generated with
all taxa included and with Strepsiptera excluded.
Parametric simulation
In an effort to statistically determine whether our recovery
of the Strepsiptera/Coleoptera clade was the result of LBA,
we carried out a parametric simulation similar to that
described by Huelsenbeck [29]. First, an input tree topology was constructed on which Coleoptera and Strepsiptera were separated (the strepsipterans were
constrained to group at the base of Holometabola).
Branch lengths, substitution rates, base frequencies, and
gamma parameters for both first and second positions
independently were calculated using Paup* 4.0b10 [66].
Using the program Mesquite v. 2.5 [74], 100 individual
datasets of 1912 bp were simulated according to the con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/34

straint tree and with ML branch lengths and model
parameters for both positions 1 and 2 of our empirical
data. These position 1 and 2 datasets were then concatenated, resulting in 100 datasets of 3824 bp. The 100 datasets were analyzed using Garli [72]. To determine if, and
how frequently, the strepsipterans grouped with the beetles, a consensus network showing all splits in the 100
resulting trees was generated in SplitsTree [73].
Divergence time estimation
Divergence time estimates were calculated using the
relaxed-clock BI MCMC method implemented in the program Multidivtime [53,75]. Inputs to the program include
our dataset of six concatenated nucleotide gene sequences
(excluding third position sites), the tree topology of Figure 1, and empirical model parameters and ML branch
lengths calculated in the BASEML routine of the program
PAML 3.4 [53,76]. To better delimit the search space and
constrain ages based on several known fossils, we
bounded the holometabolan root age to fall between 360
Ma (maximum age) or the approximate age of the Neoptera (a group that includes the majority of winged insects),
and 280 Ma, a hypothetical minimum age for Holometabola [1]. Four additional minimum ages were set for lineages represented in the tree based on firmly established
fossils: 220 Ma for Mecoptera (Thaumatomerope neuropteroides) [77], 227 Ma for Diptera (Grauvogelia arzvilleriana)
[78], and 270 Ma for Coleoptera (Sylvacoleus sharovi) [77].
All other analysis conditions were identical to those used
in Wiegmann et al. [75]. The effects of model prior designations on age estimates were investigated using runs that
exclude the nucleotide data [53]. For analyses that
included the data, multiple independent runs of the
Markov chain from differing starting conditions were carried out to confirm convergence and robustness of estimated ages and rates [54].
