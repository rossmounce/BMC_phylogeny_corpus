Background
Eucalyptus forests are a competitive and efficient alternative to convert carbon from the atmosphere in cellulose, an important source for paper manufacture and
bioenergy production.
To obtain transgenic Eucalyptus with important traits
improved it is necessary to make modifications in genes
that affect the final phenotype. One interesting gene
that follows this requisite was recently found: this is the
AtSHN2 gene (Arabidopsis thaliana SHINE 2).
AtSHN2 codifies to a Transcription Factor known as
“Arabidopsis SHINE/WAX INDUCER”. Instead of inducing drought tolerance in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa),
AtSHN2 overexpression causes: i) 34% increase in the
cellulose content; ii) 45% reduction in lignin content and
iii) increase in wood digestibly (elevated S:G ratio) with
no compromise in plant strength and performance [1].
The discovery of AtSHN2 function in plant cell wall formation, led Ambavaram and collaborators [1] to perform
other studies and ultimately to propose the following
model: AtSHN2 regulates positively MYB transcription
factors (TF) related to cellulose synthesis and it downregulates MYBTF’s related to lignin formation. At the
same time, SHINE can repress NAC TFthat controls MYB
expression[1].
As a consequence of the interesting phenotype
achieved through AtSHN2 overexpression in rice, this
work focused on the identification and analyses of
AtSHN orthologues in Eucalyptus. Bioinformatics
tools were used to search for AtSHN similar genes in

Material and methods
Putative transcription factors of the SHINE family were
searched in Eucalyptus by comparing the AtSHN amino
acid sequences with the Eucalyptus genome assembly
(obtained from Eucalyptus grandis – http://eucalyptusdb.bi.up.ac.za).
This analysis revealed the existence of two sequences
with high similarity to AtSHN proteins. Quantitative
RT-PCR assays were carried out to verify the expression
profile of these genes in different tissues (leaves, flowers
and xylem) of the hybrid variety E. urograndis (E. uroplhyla x E. grandis). The RNA extraction was carried out
following the protocol described by Zeng & Yang (2002)
[3]. The qRT-PCR was performed with the SYBR ®
Green PCR Master Mixkit from Applied Biosystems. The
Results were analyzed according to the mathematical
method described by Pfaffl, 2001 [4].
Plant materials were provided by the International
Paper Company, Brazil.

Results and discussion
The comparison of the AtSHN amino acids sequence
with E. grandis genome revealed the existence of two

Eucalyptus. Moreover, the expression profile of the corresponding genes in Eucalyptus was evaluated to prove
their role as AtSHN. To carry it on, the expression
experiments were done with flower, leaf and xylem. If
the Eucalyptus putativeSHINE’s has the same function
of the AtSHN’s,, gene expression in flower tissues will
be the highest [2]. This is because it is known that
AtSHN’s genes are preferentially expressed in abscission
and dehiscence zones, a phenomenon that usually
occurs in lots of flower tissues.

Figure 1 Phylogenetic analysis of SHN genes from A. thaliana
(AtSHN1, AtSHN2 and AtSHN3) and the new SHN genes identified in
Eucalyptus grandis (EgSHN1a and EgSHN1b). The scale bar of 0,1
corresponds to 10% sequence divergence. Bootstrap values are
given for nodes and are considered as value of significance of the
branches.

putative SHN genes in Eucalyptus (named EgSHN1a and
EgSHN1b). A phylogenetic analysis showed that these
Eucalyptus SHN genes are orthologs to the AtSHN1
ofArabidopsis thaliana (Figure 1).
The proteins encoded by EgSHN1a and EgSHN1b
share approximately 58% identity to AtSHN1and a conserved gene structure is found between AtSHN and both
EgSHN genes: a single intron is present and located
approximately 80 bp from the start codon. In addition,
as in AtSHN1, EgSHN genes contain an AP2 DNA binding domain, which is in accordance to their putative
role as transcription factors. More importantly, the
domains “mm” and “cm”, which are exclusive of SHN
genes, could be identified in the Eucalyptus sequences.
In the same way that the gene sequence is very correlated between the species, it’s probable that their function are the same two.
Gene expression analysis revealed a higher expression
of EgSHN1a in flowers (Figure 2). This result is similar
to the AtSHN1 expression profile [2], suggesting a similar function for EgSHN1a.
The expression pattern of the gene EgSHN1b is being
carried on.

Conclusions
There are two SHN genes in Eucalyptus (EgSHN1a and
EgSHN1b), which are orthologs to AtSHN1;
The EgSHN1a function might be the same of AtSHN1
as suggested by their similar expression patterns. It is
possible that, in Eucalyptus, biosynthesis of cuticle and
cell wall in abscission and dehiscence zones is regulated
by EgSHN’s, as already described in A. thaliana[1].
The new genes described here are interesting candidate for the development of transgenic Eucalyptus.
Overexpression of SHN genes in A. thaliana increased
tolerance to drought and pathogen attacks and greatly
improved cell wall quality.
