Abstract
Background: Mimivirus isolated from A. polyphaga is the largest virus discovered so far. It is
unique among all the viruses in having genes related to translation, DNA repair and replication
which bear close homology to eukaryotic genes. Nevertheless, only a small fraction of the proteins
(33%) encoded in this genome has been assigned a function. Furthermore, a large fraction of the
unassigned protein sequences bear no sequence similarity to proteins from other genomes. These
sequences are referred to as ORFans. Because of their lack of sequence similarity to other proteins,
they can not be assigned putative functions using standard sequence comparison methods. As part
of our genome-wide computational efforts aimed at characterizing Mimivirus ORFans, we have
applied fold-recognition methods to predict the structure of these ORFans and further functions
were derived based on conservation of functionally important residues in sequence-template
alignments.
Results: Using fold recognition, we have identified highly confident computational 3D structural
assignments for 21 Mimivirus ORFans. In addition, highly confident functional predictions for 6 of
these ORFans were derived by analyzing the conservation of functional motifs between the
predicted structures and proteins of known function. This analysis allowed us to classify these 6
previously unannotated ORFans into their specific protein families: carboxylesterase/thioesterase,
metal-dependent deacetylase, P-loop kinases, 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, BTB domain and
eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E.
Conclusion: Using stringent fold recognition criteria we have assigned three-dimensional
structures for 21 of the ORFans encoded in the Mimivirus genome. Further, based on the 3D
models and an analysis of the conservation of functionally important residues and motifs, we were
able to derive functional attributes for 6 of the ORFans. Our computational identification of
important functional sites in these ORFans can be the basis for a subsequent experimental
verification of our predictions. Further computational and experimental studies are required to
elucidate the 3D structures and functions of the remaining Mimivirus ORFans.

Background
Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites which are
responsible for many diseases in plants and animals. They

differ from other microorganisms in their extreme
dependence on the host cell. In 2004, the genome of
Mimivirus [GenBank:AY653733], was sequenced [1].

Mimivirus is a nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus
(NCLDV), and is the largest known virus, both in particle
size (>0.4 μm in diameter) and genome length (1.2-Mbp)
[1]. Its genome size is larger than that of several bacteria
and archea [1,2], is characterized by an extensive gene repertoire and the absence of pseudogenes [1,3], and contains a total of 911 predicted protein-coding genes [1].
Previously characterized NCLDVs share a set of 31 evolutionary conserved genes required for viral replication,
transcription and virion biogenesis [4]. Of these 31 genes,
Mimivirus possesses 26, indicating that it might have originated from a common ancestor [1,5]. At the same time, it
lacks 5 core NCLDV genes and contains a number of other
unique genes, which clearly distinguish it from other
viruses [5]. Strikingly, it contains genes related to tRNA
modification, translation, protein folding, DNA repair,
amino acid and lipid metabolism, which exhibit homology to eukaryotic genes [1,5]. Mimivirus is assigned to its
own lineage at the beginning of the Eukarya branch, distinct from the other three domains of life (Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea) [1]. Notably, out of 911 coded Mimivirus
proteins, only 298 have been assigned functions based on
homology [1]. This represents only 33% of the total predicted genes, which is typically a very low percentage in
comparison to that of newly sequenced prokaryotic
genomes (70%) [6]. Furthermore, over 300 of the Mimivirus proteins show no sequence similarity to any other
protein in the databases. Proteins with no detectable
sequence similarity to other proteins are referred to as
"ORFans" [7]. All these characteristics make Mimivirus a
unique virus and emphasize the need to understand its
biology.
Here we focus on attempting to assign three-dimensional
(3D) structures and putative functions to Mimivirus
ORFans. Recent studies [8,9] have also provided some
hints regarding the function of a number of originally
unannotated Mimivirus sequences. Our goal here is to use
fold recognition (FR) methods to identify a number of
very confident computational 3D structural assignments
which we subsequently analyze in detail in order to arrive
at specific functional predictions. For structural predictions we used FR methods available through the 3D-Jury
Meta server [10]. Using very stringent criteria, we were
able to assign 3D structures to 21 of the ORFans. By analyzing the predicted structures and the conservation of
functional motifs, 4 ORFans (R843, L374, R277, L759)
were predicted to be enzymes which we functionally characterized as carboxylesterase/thioesterase, metal-dependent deacetylase, P-loop kinase and 3-methyladenine DNA
glycosylase, respectively. 2 ORFans (L834 and L529) were
predicted to belong to the BTB/POZ domain family and
the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eIF4e) family, respectively.

Results
Highly confident structural predictions (INUB score > 12
and 3D-JURY score > 50; see Methods) were obtained for
21 Mimivirus ORFans. No annotation exists for any of
these ORFans, which means that they are currently annotated as hypothetical proteins. These 21 structural predictions were analyzed in detail in order to identify those for
which, in addition to the structural assignment, a confident functional prediction can be made.
ORFans allowing confident structural and functional
predictions
Analysis of the sequence-structure alignments, the annotations in various databases and the literature, allowed us
to confidently predict the functions for 6 ORFans. Table 1
shows for each ORFan, the 3D-Jury score, the PDB template chosen and its fold type. The last two columns list
the predicted function and the functional evidence that
allowed us to arrive at the confident functional prediction. In what follows we describe in detail the functional
predictions for 3 ORFans. The results of remaining 3
ORFans are available online [11].
ORFan R843
The 10 highest scoring results obtained by 3D-JURY are
listed in Table 2. For each result, the table shows the 3DJury score, the server from which the model was obtained,
the template used in the sequence-structure alignment
and its SCOP [12] family classification. The highest 3DJury score was 119.75, well above the confidence threshold of 50. Furthermore, all the top ten predictions had
scores above 86.75, corresponding to templates belonging
to the α/β hydrolase superfamily. The table shows that
similar results were obtained by the various servers used
by 3D-Jury. Taken together, there is a strong indication of
a very confident structural prediction.

The α/β hydrolase superfamily is one of the largest groups
of structurally related hydrolytic enzymes which are
highly divergent on the sequence level and perform a wide
range of catalytic functions [13-16]. The canonical α/β
hydrolase fold is constructed of eight β-strands connected
by five α-helices [13,14,17]. Members in this family
include a large number of enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase, dienlactone hydrolase, lipase, thioesterase,
serine carboxypeptidase, haloalkane dehalogenase,
haloperoxidase, lyase and others. Despite the marked variance in the primary structures, it has been found that all
of these enzymes contain a catalytic triad, which is conserved in the invariant order of nucleophile-acid-histidine
(but except from the histidine, the amino acid identities
can vary) [14-16]. Although the fold recognition (FR)
results unambiguously suggest that ORFan R843 is a
member of this fold, predicting the specific family within
the α/β hydrolases is not straightforward [18].

The 8 top FR results identify templates belonging to a single SCOP family, carboxylesterase/thioesterase (Table 2).
Carboxylesterase/thioesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of
compounds containing the functional groups such as carboxylic acid ester, amides and thioesters [19]. They are
characterized by a conserved HG sequence, which constitutes the oxyanion hole, located about 70–100 amino
acids ahead of the active site serine residue [20] and more
specifically, carboxylesterases are characterized by the
PROSITE [21] signature pattern containing the active site
serine, [LIV]-X- [LIVFY]- [LIVMST]-G- [HYWV]-S-X-G[GSTAC] [22]. In addition, other characteristics of this
family (shared also with other families in the fold)
include a similar catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp/Glu) responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon
atom of the ester bonds and a conserved pentapeptide
sequence around the nucleophile, Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly, which
is usually located between a β-strand and an α-helix and
assumes an extremely sharp turn called a nucleophilic
elbow [14].
The first 3D-JURY hit corresponds to the template 1fj2A,
human acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1). APT1 is a
canonical α/β-hydrolase fold, with the catalytic site made
up of Ser-114, Asp-169 and His-203 [23]. It lacks the first

β-strand and a typical insertion after strand β6, but contains a long loop connecting strand β4 with helix αB [23].
Figure 1a shows the sequence-structure alignment of R843
with the template 1fj2A generated by INUB. A ribbon diagram of the predicted three-dimensional (3D) model for
R843 is shown in Figure 1b. The sequence identity
between 1fj2A and R843 is only 15%. The aligned secondary structure of the template (Fig. 1a) is in good agreement
with the predicted secondary structure of R843 (44% secondary structure match, with most of the secondary structure elements in the canonical fold predicted correctly).
The loop between β4 and αB aligns to residues in R843,
indicating that R843 is consistent with this feature of
1fj2A. The alignment revealed that the 'HG' motif (residues 97–98 in R843, yellow boxes in Fig. 1a), characteristic of caboxylesterase/thioesterase, is aligned to identical
residues in R843. Interestingly, the PROSITE signature
pattern containing the active site serine (shown in grey
background), characteristic of carboxylesterases, is also
conserved in R843. The catalytic residues, Ser, Asp and His
(magenta boxes and marked by asterisks, Fig. 1a) are
aligned to identical residues in R843. The assignment of
the residues forming the catalytic triad is further corroborated by the fact that the active-site serine residue is a part

of the conserved pentapeptide motif, G-Y-S-N-G (marked
in green boxes, residues 198–202). Moreover, it is also
evident from Figure 1b that R843 has a α/β hydrolase fold
with all the secondary structure elements β3–β8 and αAαF being conserved. It contains the active site residues in
the same topological location with Ser located in a sharp
turn connecting strand β5 and helix αC and Asp and His
residues located after strands β7 and β8 respectively (Fig.
1b). In summary, based on the strong FR results and the
conserved features in the sequence-structure alignment,
we confidently predict that R843 is a member of the carboxylesterase/thioesterase family.
R843 is considered an ORFan sequence because BLAST
[24] identified no similar sequences in the nonredundant
(NR) database. However, searches in other databases confirm our result; CDD [25] and InterPro [26] indicated significant matches to the "abhydrolase_2" family which
consists of both phospholipases and carboxylesterases.
Similarly, COG [27] analysis indicated that residues 91 to
267 in R843 align to the COG "predicted esterase"
(COG0400). Thus, these searches further corroborate our
prediction that R843 is a member of the carboxylesterase/
thioesterase family and has esterase activity.
ORFan R277
The top 10 3D-Jury results for R277 are listed in Table 3.
All the top 10 hits are confident structural predictions
with 3D-Jury scores above 50. They correspond to P-loop
kinases and are members of the P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases (P-loop NTPases) SCOP
superfamily. However, the last column in the table shows
that the templates belong to 3 different SCOP families
(1yj5 not yet classified).

P-loop NTPases hydrolyze the β-γ phosphate bond of a
bound nucleoside triphosphate in a Mg2+ dependent reaction. Structurally, they adopt a three-layered α/β sandwich
configuration that contains regularly recurring α-β units
with the β-strands forming a central, mostly parallel βsheet surrounded on both sides by α-helices [28]. At the
sequence level, the P-loop is characterized by two strongly
conserved sequence motifs, termed the Walker-A and
Walker-B motifs [28,29]. The Walker-A motif (typically,
Gx4GK [T/S], where x is any residue) encompasses the first
strand and helix, and is involved in binding the triphosphate moiety of the substrate NTP [30]. The Walker B
motif, composed of conserved aspartate (typically,
hhhhD, where h is a hydrophobic residue), encompasses
the third conserved strand and coordinates a Mg2+ ion
[29,31,32]. This motif is generally less conserved among
the P-loop NTPases [33].
P-loop kinases, which are one of the types of P-loop
NTPases are ubiquitous enzymes that transfer the γ phos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/115

phate of ATP to a wide range of substrates. The substrate
of a kinase can be a small molecule, lipid, or protein. The
P-loop kinases share the Walker-A and B motifs with the
rest of the P-loop NTPases [28]. Further, P-loop kinases
can be distinguished from other major groups of P-loop
NTPases by the presence of a mostly helical structure
between strands β4 and β5. Structurally, the P-loop is covered by a helical lid containing the conserved arginine
motif Rx(2–3)R at the distal end of helix α5, where the
second conserved arginine (in some cases, lysine) interacts with the γ phosphate of ATP [28]. Sequence comparison studies have shown that the position of the conserved
arginine motif varies among different polynucleotide
kinases [33].
3D-Jury first hit corresponds to a mammalian polynucleotide kinase (mPnk) (PDB code: 1yj5). mPnk belongs to
a group of phosphotransferases with hydroxyl group as an
acceptor and catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate from
ATP to the 5' end of either DNA or RNA. mPnk consists of
3 domains: FHA domain, phosphate domain and kinase
domain [33]. R277 matches with its kinase domain and
the sequence identity of the alignment is 16%.
Figure 2a shows the sequence-structure alignment of R277
and 1yj5. Figure 2b shows the ribbon diagram of predicted 3D model of R277. The secondary structure match
is 36%. Figure 2a reveals the conserved motifs, particularly the Walker-A and Walker-B motifs in R277, which
are characteristic features of various P-loop NTPases. The
walker-A motif, the P-loop sequence in R277 is
10GLPGSGKT17 (marked in green color) and is identical to
that of mPnk (371GFPGAGKS378). The walker-A motif is
followed by the conserved walker-B (Asp-59) motif and is
aligned well with that of the template (marked in yellow
color). It is also clear from Figure 2b that P-loop (highlighted in red color) is located between the first β-strand
and first α-helix, which is a common feature in many
nucleotide dependent phosphotransferases. Structurally,
in mPnk, the P-loop is covered by a helical lid which contains the conserved arginine motif, 457RHNNR461. Figure
2b shows a similar helical lid (helix α5 in Fig. 2b) folded
over P-loop in R277. Further, the two conserved arginine
residues in the helix lid probably are Arg-103 and Arg-107
in the sequence motif 103RNDNR107 (shown as sticks at
the distal end of α5 in Fig. 2b). The alignment in Figure 2a
shows that the motif 103RNDNR107 in R277 (shown in
light pink) is not fully aligned and is six residues away
from the motif 457RHNNR461 of the template (shown in
dark pink). Nevertheless, the presence of two arginines at
distal end of helix α5 in R277 with the same orientation
as that of the template is a strong indication that they may
form the conserved arginine motif and interact with the
bound ATP.

Based on the FR results, it can be inferred that R277 is a Ploop kinase with all the important sequence motifs conserved. To attempt to arrive to a more specific functional
prediction, we also compared the Enzyme Commission
(EC) numbers [34] (column 6 in Table 3) of the templates. Table 3 shows that the first 3 digits in the EC numbers are the same (EC 2.7.1.-), corresponding to
phosphotransferases enzymes that transfer the phosphoryl group to the hydroxyl moiety. The last digit of an EC
number usually represents the substrate specificity of a
reaction, while the first three digits of the EC number usually describe the overall type of enzymatic reaction. Thus,
based on the convincing features, we conclude that R277
is functionally related to the group of phosphotransferases that catalyzes a reaction involving the transfer of
phosphoryl, where the substrate may be an alcohol moiety.
Confirming evidence was obtained from COG and Interpro (but not CDD), which also identified R277 as a member of the superfamily of P-loop containing nucleoside
triphosphate hydrolases. In summary, we predict that
R277 has a P-loop NTPase fold with conserved binding
sites for a phosphate donor and may have a similar catalytic mechanism as that of other P-loop kinases.
ORFan L529
For L529, the top 9 results obtained from 3D-Jury scored
above 40, with the first 4 above 50 (Table 4). The first 9
hits correspond to the same SCOP family, the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). The 10th hit corresponded to an unrelated template with a low 3D-Jury
score of 18.57.

eIF4E recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing (m7Gppp) cap of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs during an early step in the initiation of protein synthesis and
facilitates ribosome binding to mRNA [35]. The structure
of eIF4E has been highly conserved throughout eukaryotic
evolution and consists of eight antiparallel β-strands, 3
long and 3 short α-helices, whereby the 3 long helices are

on one side of the β-sheet [36]. The cap analogue binds in
a narrow slot on the concave surface [37-39]. Sequence
analysis of eIF4E from several species revealed that all
known eIF4Es contain a set of eight conserved tryptophans, two of which are critical for cap recognition and
are absolutely conserved [40-42]. Site directed mutagenesis studies have shown that tryptophans 1 and 8 are essential for the cap recognition and the mutations of these two
residues totally abolished the cap recognition, whereas
other mutations had smaller or no effect on activity [41].
Recognition is mediated by π-π stacking between the 7methyl-guanine and the indole groups of these two absolutely conserved tryptophan residues [37]. Moreover,
eIF4E contains a phylogenetically conserved sequence (S/
T)VxxFW, required for the interactions with eIF4Gs and
4E-BPs [36]. Substitution of Trp to a nonaromatic amino
acid in this consensus sequence has been shown to disrupt the ability of eIF4E to interact with either eIF4G or
with 4E-BPs [43,44].The highest scoring 3D-Jury corresponds to a translation initiation factor from yeast (PDB
code: 1ap8). Figure 3a shows the sequence structure alignment of L529 with 1ap8. Figure 3b shows the ribbon diagram of our predicted 3D model for L529. The sequence
and the secondary structure identities were 20% and 43%,
respectively. Figure 3a reveals that L529 possesses tryptophan residues at positions equivalent to Trp-43, Trp-75
and Trp-166 of 1ap8. More significantly, tryptophans 1
(Trp-25) and 8 (Trp-124), important for cap recognition,
are fully conserved as shown by yellow boxes. The consensus sequence (S/T)VxxFW (residues 39–44 of L529,
marked in green color), including the Trp residue required

with the exception of an Ile residue in place of Val. Finally,
L529 contains other aromatic residues (28Y, 73Y, 74F and
89F) at positions equivalent to other Trp resides (46W,
104W, 115W and 130W) in 1ap8 (marked in magenta background).
For this ORFan, no corroborating additional information
was obtained from CDD, InterPro nor COG. Nevertheless,

for cap binding and the strong FR results, we predict that
L529 is a translation initiation factor and hypothesize that
it may participate in cap-dependent translation.
ORFans allowing only confident structural predictions
For 10 of the 21 confident 3D-Jury predictions, we were
able to predict their general fold only, but did not find
strong evidence to attempt to arrive to a specific functional characterization. The 10 prediction results are summarized in Table 5. The table lists the ORFan name, the
3D-Jury score, the PDB template used and the predicted
SCOP fold type. For each ORFan, the hits are confident
fold assignments with 3D-Jury scores more than 50. Further, it was found that for 8 ORFans, the top confident
(3D-Jury scores > 50) results belonged to the same SCOP
family, however the key residues crucial for function and
other family specific sequence motifs were not conserved.
So, no clear functional annotations were obtained. Moreover, no CDD hits were obtained for any of the 10
ORFans. Searches against Interpro found 4 ORFans to
contain known domains and were consistent with our FR
results (see [11]).

Ankyrins Prediction
5 ORFans (L146, R551, L677, R747 and R868) were predicted to be ankyrin repeats, with corresponding 3D-Jury
templates 1n11, 1k1a, 1n0q, 1n0r and 1k3z. All 3D-Jury
scores were above 50. 3D-Jury scores and CDD/InterPro
searches of these ORFans are available online [11]. The
ankyrin repeats are usually 33 amino acids long and are
important for protein-protein interactions. Also, earlier
studies of the Mimivirus genome have shown that
Ankyrin repeats form the largest paralogous gene family
[5,8] and are identified in more than 30 distinct ORFs [1].

Discussion
Mimivirus is the largest DNA virus ever characterized. In
terms of the size, complexity and gene repertoire, it has
challenged the conventional views about viruses and thus
is an interesting organism to study. In Mimivirus, only a
small percentage of proteins have known functions
derived from sequence homology. A large fraction of proteins have no homologs in current databases and constitutes a set of ORFans. Nothing is known about their
structure and function. Despite their lack of homology to

any other sequence in the databases, a fraction of the
ORFans may correspond to very divergent members of
known families. Using fold recognition we identified
highly confident distant relationships to known proteins
for 21 of the ORFans. Further, based on the 3D models
and an analysis of the conservation of functionally important residues and motifs, we were able to derive functional
attributes for 6 of the ORFans. In all these cases, the functionally important residues and sequence motifs were
found to be fully conserved with respect to the template.
4 ORFans (R843, R277, L759 and L374) were predicted to
be enzymes and we functionally categorized them as carboxylesterase/thioesterase, P-loop kinase, 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase and metal-dependent deacetylase,
respectively. Some of these enzymatic functions were also
assigned to other Mimivirus ORFs by earlier studies [3].
ORFans R843 and R277 predicted as thioesterase and
kinase respectively may play a role in cell regulation processes. Also, previous analyses have shown the presence of
several types of DNA repair enzymes in Mimivirus including formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylases, UV-damage
endonuclease and MutS protein and the presence of DNA
repair enzymes is the one of the remarkable features of the
Mimivirus genome [1,5]. ORFan L759 predicted as 3methyladenine DNA glycosylase suggests that the ORFan
correspond to a DNA repair enzyme which may function
primarily by removing alkylation damage from duplex
and single-stranded DNA. ORFan L374 predicted as
deacetylase may play a role in lipid biosynthesis. 2
ORFans (L834 and L529) were predicted to be members
of the BTB/POZ domain and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eIF4e) families, respectively. The BTB
domain has also been found in some other ORFs (which
were annotated as "unknown", including L834), making
this family the second largest annotated paralogous family in Mimivirus [8]. BTB/POZ domains from several zinc
finger proteins and have been shown to mediate transcriptional repression and to interact with components of histone deacetylase corepressor complexes [8]. ORFan L529
predicted as translation initiation factor 4e is an important protein of the translation apparatus and will function
as a cap binding protein during protein synthesis and
facilitate ribosome binding to mRNA.
We were unable to confidently assign specific functions to
10 of the confident structural predictions. In these cases,
the fold assignment was fairly straightforward, but the further classification into precise protein family was not that
evident. For example, the fold type for the ORFan R882
was predicted to be a 7-bladed β-propeller, but it was not
possible to deduce any function since proteins with a βpropeller fold are involved in a wide range of biological
functions, despite their structural similarity [45]. Further,
it might be possible that these ORFans may exhibit some

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/115

unrelated function while their 3D structures have converged to a similar fold. Finally, 5 ORFans were predicted
to be ankyrin repeats. Ankyrin repeat is the most frequently found fold in Mimivirus and forms the largest
paralogous family [8]. Ankyrin repeat-containing proteins
are ubiquitously found in both viral and bacterial
genomes and play structural roles.
Further computational and experimental work is needed
to continue to unravel the mystery of the functions and
origins of the many ORFans in Mimivirus. Until then, our
knowledge about viral gene function will be limited, but
progress is likely to be expected soon. In particular, since
viruses are most abundant organisms in natural waters
[46], Metagenomics projects [47,48] can further help in
finding homologs. Indeed, in a recent study, an exhaustive similarity search of all Mimivirus predicted proteins
against all publicly available sequences identified many of
their closest homologues among the Sargasso Sea environmental sequences [9]. With the renewed interest in
sequencing the vast viral repertoire, we will be able to
unravel the functions and origins of more Mimivirus
ORFans. Only experimental characterization, possibly
guided by computational predictions, will allow a better
characterization of the Mimivirus and other genomes.

Conclusion
The present study describes the confident structural predictions for 21 of the ORFans in the Mimivirus genome
using fold recognition. Based on the predicted 3D models
and an analysis of the conservation of functionally important residues and motifs, we were able to derive functions
for 6 of these ORFans. Indeed, the computational predictions can provide the basis for the subsequent experimental validation to unambiguously determine the exact
functional roles of these ORFans.

Methods
Structure Prediction
Structure prediction was carried out using 3D-Jury [10], a
fully automated protein structure meta prediction system
that implements a number of fold recognition servers. The
Meta-DP server [49] was used to identify possible
domains within the protein sequences. Highly confident
FR predictions are considered for INUB [50,51] and 3DJury scores greater than 12 and 50, respectively. After
thousands of predictions processed by these servers, virtually no false positives have been observed above these
thresholds.
Motif Search
To confirm the 3D-Jury results and to obtain additional
functional hints by other methods, we also searched for
motifs (signature sequences) using the CDD [25], COG
[27] and InterPro [26] databases.

Function Prediction
Function assignment was carried out based on the conservation of features in the 3D-Jury sequence-template alignment, such as correspondence of predicted and observed
secondary structure and conservation of functionally
important residues (e.g. residues involved in catalytic
activity, in binding to ligands, DNA or other proteins). To
aid in the analysis, we developed a new automated Fold
Recognition Alignment Analyzer tool called Fralanyzer
[52]. Fralanyzer receives as input a sequence-template
alignment from FR servers, automatically searches annotated databases (such as PDBSum and SwissProt) and
highlights the functionally important positions that are
identical in the alignment. Our predictions of functionally
important residues as well as the annotated alignments in
the figures were carried out with the aid of Fralanyzer.
