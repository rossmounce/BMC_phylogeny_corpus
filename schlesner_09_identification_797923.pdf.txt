Abstract
Background: Archaea share with bacteria the ability to bias their movement towards more favorable
locations, a process known as taxis. Two molecular systems drive this process: the motility apparatus and
the chemotaxis signal transduction system. The first consists of the flagellum, the flagellar motor, and its
switch, which allows cells to reverse the rotation of flagella. The second targets the flagellar motor switch
in order to modulate the switching frequency in response to external stimuli. While the signal transduction
system is conserved throughout archaea and bacteria, the archaeal flagellar apparatus is different from the
bacterial one. The proteins constituting the flagellar motor and its switch in archaea have not yet been
identified, and the connection between the bacterial-like chemotaxis signal transduction system and the
archaeal motility apparatus is unknown.
Results: Using protein-protein interaction analysis, we have identified three proteins in Halobacterium
salinarum that interact with the chemotaxis (Che) proteins CheY, CheD, and CheC2, as well as the flagella
accessory (Fla) proteins FlaCE and FlaD. Two of the proteins belong to the protein family DUF439, the
third is a HEAT_PBS family protein. In-frame deletion strains for all three proteins were generated and
analyzed as follows: a) photophobic responses were measured by a computer-based cell tracking system
b) flagellar rotational bias was determined by dark-field microscopy, and c) chemotactic behavior was
analyzed by a swarm plate assay. Strains deleted for the HEAT_PBS protein or one of the DUF439 proteins
proved unable to switch the direction of flagellar rotation. In these mutants, flagella rotate only clockwise,
resulting in exclusively forward swimming cells that are unable to respond to tactic signals. Deletion of the
second DUF439 protein had only minimal effects. HEAT_PBS proteins could be identified in the
chemotaxis gene regions of all motile haloarchaea sequenced so far, but not in those of other archaeal
species. Genes coding for DUF439 proteins, however, were found to be integral parts of chemotaxis gene
regions across the archaeal domain, and they were not detected in other genomic context.
Conclusion: Altogether, these results demonstrate that, in the archaeal domain, previously unrecognized
archaea-specific Che proteins are essential for relaying taxis signaling to the flagellar apparatus.

Background
Many archaeal and bacterial species have the ability to
sense environmental parameters and use this information
to direct their movement in response to gradients towards
more favorable locations [1]. This process, called taxis, is
in both prokaryotic domains of life based on a modified
two-component signal transduction system ([2-5],
reviewed in [6]), and a motility organelle. The best understood motility organelle in bacteria, and the only one
known in archaea, is the flagellum, a rotating, propellerlike structure (reviewed for example in [7-9]. Pili have
been observed on the surface of many archaeal species,
but their cellular function is unknown [10]). In response
to external stimuli, the taxis signal transduction system
modulates the frequency by which the flagellar motor
changes its direction of rotation, and thus enables a biased
random walk, and leads to movement to places with
improved environmental conditions (reviewed in [11]).
Even though several variations of the taxis signaling system exist in different bacterial and archaeal species (see
for example [12]), the overall mechanism, as well as the
proteins involved, are conserved (for review see [6]). The
receptors, also known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis
proteins (MCP), sense a multitude of environmental stimuli such as various chemicals, oxygen, osmolarity and, in
H. salinarum, also light. They regulate the autophosphorylation activity of the histidine kinase CheA, which is coupled to them by the adaptor protein CheW [13-15]. After
autophosphorylation, the phosphoryl group is transferred
from CheA to the response regulator CheY [16]. Phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P) is the flagellar motor switch factor
[4,17]. Hence CheA acts as an integrator of diverse stimuli
to generate an unambiguous output for the flagellar
motor. Other proteins mediate adaptation to the signal
(CheR, CheB, CheC, CheD, CheV) [18-23] and removal of
the phosphate from CheY-P (CheZ, CheX, CheC, FliY)
[16,24,25].

data of the halobacterial response to light has been
obtained [31-33], which allowed the generation of a
quantitative model of the flagellar motor switch and its
sensory control in this organism [34,35]. However, in
spite of the good understanding of the switch cycle in H.
salinarum on a systems level, the underlying molecular
mechanisms remain unclear.
In archaea and bacteria, the flagellar apparatus is composed of three functional units: the flagellar filament, the
motor, and its switch, which allows the motor to change
its rotational direction. Despite this superficial similarity,
these motility organelles are distinct structures in both
domains, which are not related to each other (see [8,9,36]
for review). For the proteins constituting the bacterial flagellar apparatus, no homologs have been detected in
archaeal genomes, suggesting very strongly that the
archaeal motility apparatus must be built from different
components [8]. Furthermore, the archaeal flagellar
motor is not driven by proton-motive force (PMF) like
most bacterial motors, but either by ATP directly or by an
ATP-dependent ion gradient which is not coupled to PMF
(except via the H+-ATP synthase) [37]. In some respects,
archaeal flagella resemble bacterial type IV pili more than
bacterial flagella [38,39]. Known components of the
archaeal flagellar apparatus are the flagellins, which compose the filament, and a number of conserved proteins
that are coded by genes located close to the flagellin genes
in archaeal genomes: the flagella accessory genes flaC,
flaD, flaE, flaF, flaG, flaH, flaI, and flaJ [40,41]. In H. salinarum and other archaea of the families Halobacteriales
and Methanomicrobia, the FlaC and FlaE proteins are
fused to one polypeptide [42]. The exact role of the Fla
proteins is not understood, but it has been shown by deletion mutations that they are required for flagellation
[43,44]. A role in flagellar biosynthesis was suggested,
because FlaI and FlaJ are homologous to proteins from the
bacterial type II secretion system and type IV pili biogenesis system [8,43].

In bacteria, CheY-P binds to the flagellar motor switch
protein FliM [26], which forms together with FliN and
FliG, and in B. subtilis also FliY, the motor switch complex.
The binding site of CheY-P is the highly conserved N-terminal region of FliM [27]. Without bound CheY-P, the
flagellar motor in bacteria rotates in one default direction.
Binding of CheY-P increases the probability that the
motor switches to rotation in the opposite direction
(reviewed in [28]).

CheY-P is the flagellar motor switch factor also in H. salinarum and probably also other archaea [4,5]. However,
the interaction site of CheY-P is unknown, since for its target protein in bacteria, FliM, just as for all other proteins
constituting the bacterial flagellar apparatus, no
homologs can be found in archaeal genomes [6,8,45]. No
equivalent to the CheY-P binding peptide has been identified either.

The taxis signal transduction system of H. salinarum is
built from 18 receptors (called halobacterial transducer
proteins, Htrs), and the Che proteins A, Y, W1, W2, R, B,
C1, C2, C3, and D [29,30]. Due to its ability to perform
phototaxis, H. salinarum is an excellent model organism
for studying cellular responses. In several studies, detailed

Besides CheY-P, fumarate is a further factor involved in
flagellar motor switching, both in archaea (H. salinarum,
[46,47]) and bacteria (E. coli and S. typhimurium, [48]). In
E. coli, fumarate reductase (FRD) was identified as the target of fumarate at the motor, where it was shown to interact with the flagellar motor switch protein FliG [49]. In H.

salinarum, which has neither a FRD nor a FliG, fumarate
must act by a different, till now unknown mechanism.

the chemotaxis signal transduction system and the
archaeal flagellar apparatus.

Hence, the connection between the archaeal flagellar
apparatus, the bacterial-like taxis signal transduction system, and the enigmatic fumarate pathway has remained
elusive. Here we report the identification of three proteins
that interact with CheY, CheC2, and CheD as well as
FlaCE and FlaD, thereby building a link between the taxis
signal transduction system and the archaeal flagellar
apparatus. By assaying deletion mutants, we demonstrated that two of these proteins are essential for control
of the direction of rotation of the flagellar motor. Two of
the proteins belong to the protein family DUF439. We
found that the members of this family are generally and
exclusively present in archaeal che gene regions. We conclude that DUF439 describes essential archaeal chemotaxis proteins for which we propose the name CheF.

Construction of in-frame deletion mutants
To elucidate the function of the newly identified proteins,
in-frame deletion strains for OE2401F-OE2404R (referred
to as Δ1, Δ2, and Δ4) and a double deletion ΔΔOE2402F
OE2404R (Δ2–4) were created using a two-step recombination method [50]. As host, two H. salinarum strains
were used: Strain R1 was used, because it is considered as
wildtype and this strain was previously used for PPI analysis (Schlesner et al., unpublished; see Additional file 1 for
details). The same deletion mutations were also constructed in strain S9, because S9 cells are better suited for
motion analysis and determination of the flagellar rotational bias, whereas R1 cells tend to stick to the glass surface of the microscope slides [51]. Clones that had
undergone the second recombination event were screened
for the absence of the target gene(s) by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis using probes for the target gene and its upstream region (see Additional file 2).
DNA from the deletion strains did not hybridize with the
gene probe, and showed the expected size decrease when
probed with the gene's upstream region.

Results
OE2401F, OE2402F, and OE2404R interact with Che and
Fla proteins
Protein interaction analysis of the halobacterial Che proteins (Schlesner et al., unpublished; see Additional file 1
for details) revealed two proteins of unknown function,
OE2402F and OE2404R, as interaction partners of CheY,
CheD, and CheC2. These proteins are homologous to
each other and are coded by adjacent genes, located
between the che genes and the type B flagellins (Figure 1).

To determine the role of OE2402F and OE2404R, these
proteins were used as baits in additional bait fishing
experiments. Both proteins were shown to interact with
the flagellar accessory proteins FlaCE, and OE2404R also
with FlaD (Figure 2; see Additional file 1 for details). The
third protein, coded by a gene located between the che
gene region and flagellins, OE2401F, was also subjected
to protein interaction analysis, although it was not
detected as an interaction partner in previous experiments. OE2401F was shown to interact with CheD and
OE2402F.
These results indicate that all three proteins play a role in
the chemotaxis signaling pathway of H. salinarum. Due to
their interaction with Che proteins as well as with Fla proteins, the newly identified proteins build a link between

Since the deletions in both parent strains S9 and R1 exhibited the same phenotype, they will be discussed together
in the following sections. As independent biological replicates, the use of two parent strains gives a high degree of
certainty for the phenotypic findings.
OE2401F and OE2402F are essential for chemotaxis and
phototaxis
To examine the effect of the deletions on chemotaxis and
motility, the deletion strains were analyzed by swarm
plate assays. A swarm plate is a semi-solid agar plate in
which the cells are inoculated. The agar concentration is
low enough to allow movement of the cells in the agar.
After point inoculation the cells grow, metabolize various
nutrients, and create a concentration gradient. Cells which
are motile and capable of chemotaxis move along this gradient away from the inoculation site, forming extended
rings, called swarm rings. Figure 3 shows representative
swarm plates for each deletion in S9, compared to
wildtype (see Additional file 3 for all swarm plates). After
three days of growth, the wild type strains formed large

copy, and the frequency of reversal of their swimming
direction was measured with a computer-based cell-tracking system (Figure 4; see Additional file 4 for details). This
system automatically determines the rate of reversing cells
over a certain observation time [52].

swarm rings. The deletion strains Δ1, Δ2, and Δ2–4 did
not show any swarming. Δ4 cells produced swarm rings,
but of a reduced size.
Reduced or impaired ring formation on swarm plates can
be due to defects in signal transduction or flagellar motility. In order to determine the defects of the deletion
strains, their swimming ability was evaluated by micros-

Visual inspection clearly demonstrated that all deletion
strains were motile without detectable swimming defects.
The wild type strains showed in a 4 s observation interval
a reversal rate of 10% (R1) and 25% (S9) in the unstimulated state. Upon stimulation with a blue light flash or
orange light step down (both are repellent stimuli), wild
type cells responded effectively with reversal rates of 70–
80%.
In the strains Δ2 and Δ2–4, very low reversal rates of up to
5% were measured, both spontaneous and after stimulation. These strains displayed a smooth-swimming phenotype with hardly any switching. Similar results were
obtained for the Δ1 strains. The reversal rates for three of
the Δ1 clones were slightly higher than the estimated
tracking error of 5%, but this may have been due to the
low number of cells evaluated for these clones, which is
also reflected by the broader confidence intervals. A significant increase of reversals after repellent stimulation could
not be detected, indicating that this deletion has disabled
the response to repellent stimuli. It leads to a strongly
reduced switching frequency or even also to a smoothswimming phenotype.
For Δ4, no significant difference was visible compared to
wild type cells, either with or without photophobic stimulation.

Δ1, Δ2, and the double deletion Δ2–4 show almost 100%
CW rotational bias
To further characterize the defects of the deletion strains,
the flagellar rotational bias was investigated by dark-field
microscopy [53,54]. These measurements were taken only
with the S9 strains and, except for Δ1, only one clone for
each deletion was analyzed because the results were in
complete agreement with the other phenotypic findings.
The two S9Δ1 clones were investigated because they
showed a slightly different phenotype in the phototaxis
measurements (smooth-swimming vs. some residual
switching).

The numbers of cells observed swimming forward (clockwise (CW) rotating flagella) and backward (counterclockwise (CCW) rotating flagella) are shown in Table 1.
Wildtype cells showed a distribution between forward

[32,54]. Cells of the deletion strain Δ1, Δ2, and the double
deletion Δ2–4, showed a bias toward forward swimming
of almost 100%. The slight discrepancy of both S9Δ1

The flagellar rotational direction was analyzed by dark-field
microscopy. Cells with clockwise (CW) rotating flagella are pushed
forward by their right-handed flagellar bundle, whereas cells with
counterclockwise (CCW) rotating flagella are pulled backward [53].
The flagella and the direction of movement of the cell can be seen
under the dark-field microscope and thus the rotational direction be
determined. Shown is the number of cells in CW and CCW
swimming mode at the time point of observation, as well as the
percentage of CW swimming cells.

clones found in the cell tracking assay also showed up in
this experiment, proving the reliability of the applied
methods. Δ4 cells exhibited a rotational distribution of
nearly 50:50, similar to wildtype.
The deletion phenotypes are not caused by inhibited
expression of Che and Fla proteins
To rule out the possibility that the observed phenotypes
are caused by altered che or fla gene expression levels,
quantitative Realtime Reverse Transcription PCR (qRTPCR) was applied (Table 2). The genes of the che operon
as well as the fla genes CE, F, G, H, I, J are cotranscribed
[43,55], so not all genes needed to be analyzed separately.
cheR and cheY were chosen for analysis because cheR is at
the border of the che operon, next to the deleted genes,
and cheY was an additional control. cheC2 and cheW2,
which are not located in the che operon, were not tested
separately, because the deletion of these genes does not

cause a smooth-swimming phenotype (unpublished
observations). Additionally, flaH was chosen as a representative of the fla genes, although a defect in Fla protein
expression seemed a priori unlikely since no motility
defect was observed.
The qRT-PCR curves were analyzed using the 2 −ΔΔC t
method with normalization to the constitutively
expressed fdx gene [56]. In none of the tested cases was a
significant difference between deletion and wildtype
observed.
Complementation of the deletion strains reverted their
phenotype to that of wildtype
All deletions in the S9 background were complemented
by reintroducing the deleted gene in cis. The phenotype of
the complementations was examined by swarm plates
and, for the single deletions, by motion analysis. In these
assays, all complementations behaved exactly like the
wild-type strain (see Additional file 5), confirming that
the phenotypes observed in the mutants were a direct
result of their gene deletions.
Bioinformatics analysis
To collect information on the three unknown proteins
and to test if the findings obtained in H. salinarum are
potentially transferable to other archaeal species, a bioinformatics analysis was done. The starting point was a
homology search and querying databases like COG [57]
and Pfam [58]. The goal was to identify orthologs from
other organisms for which some knowledge might exist,
and to unravel correlations between the occurrence of the
here investigated proteins and Che and Fla proteins. For
this, an extensive search for Che and Fla orthologs in all
published archaeal genomes was performed (see Additional file 6).

helical repeats. Beside the HEAT-like repeats, no other
domain could be detected. In the COG database,
OE2401F is identified as member of the FOG ("Fuzzy
Orthologous Groups") COG1413, described to contain
HEAT repeat proteins. This COG belongs to the functional
category C, "Energy production and conversion". No
functional information for this COG is given.
The repeats in the protein sequence of OE2401F led to a
high number of non-significant matches in database
searches. Thus it was not possible to identify a reliable set
of orthologs from other organisms, and no conclusions
about co-occurrence of this protein family with che or fla
genes could be drawn. Close homologs were identified in
the che and fla gene regions of the halophilic archaea N.
pharaonis and H. marismortui. These homologs are, like in
H. salinarum, adjacent to a DUF439 gene. Additionally,
proteins with HEAT-like repeats are present in all
sequenced haloarchaeal genomes (the above mentioned,
H. walsbyi, and H. salinarum) in other genomic context.
For none of these proteins could any functional knowledge be obtained.
Homologs of OE2402F and OE2404R are found generally and
exclusively in archaeal che gene regions
OE2402F and OE2404R are annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins. They are homologous to each other and
belong to the protein family DUF439 [58] and to the cluster of orthologous groups COG2469. DUF439 is
described as "archaeal protein of unknown function", and
COG2469 as "uncharacterized conserved protein".

Homology searches showed that no members of the family DUF439 can be found outside the domain Archaea.
Among the archaea, the presence of such a gene strictly
correlated with the presence of che genes (see Additional
file 6). The only exceptions were Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, which does not possess che genes but has a
DUF439 homolog, and Methanosarcina barkeri, that has
che genes but no DUF439. Examination of the genomic
context revealed that the DUF439 genes are always located
in the chemotaxis gene regions (Figure 5). The exceptions
were two of the four paralogs in H. marismortui. In 10 out
of 17 species the DUF439 gene is adjacent to CheY.
The only archaeal che gene regions without a DUF439
homolog are the che2 regions of the Methanosarcina species. In Methanosarcina barkeri this is the only che region,
as this species does not contain the part of the genome
where the che1 region in M. mazei and M. acetivorans is
located [59-61]. The che gene region of M. barkeri is peculiar in that it has lost cheC, which is present in all other
archaeal che regions.

OE2401F is classified as a HEAT_PBS or HEAT family protein [58]. These proteins are predicted to contain short bi-

A multiple alignment of all members of the family
DUF439 revealed only few conserved residues and several
weakly conserved regions (Figure 6). No conserved motif
could be detected that could provide a clue to the function
of these proteins. It is noteworthy that in comparison to
the other species the protein from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (which lacks Che proteins) is less conserved and
truncated at the C-terminus.
Two or more copies of DUF439 proteins were only found
in the motile haloarchaea H. salinarum, N. pharaonis, and
H. marismortui. All three species contain a second
homolog in or adjacent to the che gene region (OE2404R
in H. salinarum). These second homologs lack several residues conserved in all other proteins of the family
DUF439 (see boxes in Figure 6), and probably fulfill a different function than the main group of DUF439 proteins.
This is consistent with the phenotypic results obtained for
the deletions: the deletion of OE2404R resulted, other
than the deletion of OE2402F, only in a weak phenotype.
Phylogenetic analysis (Figure 7) revealed that the second
homologs in the che gene region of the haloarchaea
(OE2404R, NP2162A, rrnAC2213) form a separate
branch in the phylogenetic tree, indicating that they probably arose by a gene duplication prior to the divergence of
the haloarchaea. H. marismortui contains two additional
DUF439 homologs located apart from the che gene
region. These two paralogs resemble more the main group
of DUF439 proteins than the second homolog of the
haloarchaea, as can be seen in the multiple alignment and
the phylogenetic tree. If they also fulfill a function in taxis
signaling, it remains elusive.

Discussion
OE2401F, OE2402F, and OE2404R build a link between
the Che system and the flagellar apparatus
Protein-protein interaction analysis in H. salinarum identified the proteins OE2401F, OE2402F, and OE2404R as
interaction partners of the chemotaxis proteins CheY,
CheD, and CheC2, as well as the flagella accessory proteins FlaCE and FlaD. The function of the flagellar accessory proteins is not known but their critical role in
flagellation has been demonstrated [41,43,62,63]. The
FlaE part of FlaCE is homologous to FlaD, both proteins
contain a FlaD/E domain [58]. In Methanococcus maripaludis, the deletion of flaC resulted in non-motile and
non-flagellated cells [44]. Deletion of flaCE and flaD in H.
salinarum resulted in cells with a reduced number of flagella, which are hardly (ΔflaD) or not (ΔflaCE) motile [55].
Thus, ΔflaCE cells (and perhaps also ΔflaD cells) most
likely have defects both in flagellar assembly and in flagellar function. These findings were interpreted as indicating that FlaC, FlaCE, and FlaD either function in flagellar
secretion and assembly or that they are part of the flagellar
motor or related structures. As mentioned in [44], in cre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/56

narchaeal genomes the genes flaC-E are generally absent
(see also [42] and Additional file 6) although several crenarchaeal species are known to possess functional flagella,
making a function assignment for these proteins even
more difficult. However, in no crenarchaeal genome have
che genes been detected (see Additional file 6), and we are
not aware of any study reporting that a crenarchaeote
reverses the flagellar rotational direction. Temperaturesensitive motility is described for Sulfolobus acidocaldarius
[64], but this organism achieves reorientation by briefly
halting its flagella and not by reversals [64,65]. This fact,
and the connection to the response regulator CheY via the
proteins identified in this study suggest that FlaC-E might
be components of the flagellar motor or associated structures and might be involved in flagellar motor switching.
In bacteria, the link between the Che system and the flagellar motor is built by the interaction of CheY-P with the
flagellar motor switch protein FliM. The archaeal flagellar
motor is built from different components and driven by
ATP instead of proton influx [37], but its overall function
is the same.
Accordingly, it can be speculated that OE2401F,
OE2402F, and OE2404R are either part of the archaeal
flagellar motor switch, or they are adapters which fit the
bacterial-like Che system to the yet unidentified archaeal
switch.
OE2401F, OE2402F, and OE2404R also interact with
CheD, and OE2402F and OE2404R with CheC2. In B.
subtilis, CheC is a CheY-P phosphatase localized at the signaling complex [25]. CheD deamidates glutamine residues of the receptors and is necessary for receptor
activation of CheA [66]. Together, these proteins build a
feedback loop from the output of the system to the receptors [22]. Besides CheC, B. subtilis expresses with FliY a
second CheY-P phosphatase, which is localized at the flagellar motor switch [25]. Generally, phosphatase localization turns out to be a conserved and important principle
in bacterial chemotaxis systems [67]. In H. salinarum,
receptor deamidase activity was demonstrated for the
CheB protein, but not detected for CheD [68] and the cellular role of CheD and the three CheCs is unknown. However, provided that OE2402F and OE2404R are part of or
related to the flagellar motor switch, the interaction with
CheC2 might reflect CheY-P phosphatase localization
similar to B. subtilis. CheC2 would then fulfill the role of
FliY, and one or both of the other CheCs the role of B. subtilis CheC. Altogether, the protein interaction data are not
sufficient to functionally characterize OE2401F,
OE2402F, and OE2404R, but they provide strong evidence that these proteins act between the Che system and
the archaeal flagellar apparatus.

The data suggest that without OE2401F or OE2402F the
Che system and the flagellum are decoupled. This could
occur if either the Che system cannot generate its output,
CheY-P, or if CheY-P is present but not effective. The first
of these two possibilities seems less likely because the PPI
data suggest a role for OE2401F and OE2402F between
CheY and the flagellum, and not upstream of CheY. Additionally, the homology of the Che system to bacteria
argues against the first hypothesis: Our current understanding is that the Che system of H. salinarum, with the
ten known Che proteins, is complete up to CheY-P. Only
for the part downstream of CheY-P have no homologs to
bacterial proteins been found.

Phylogenetic analysis of DUF439 proteins. Unrooted
phylogenetic tree by neighbor-joining, calculated from the
multiple alignment shown in Figure 6. Species can be derived
from the prefix of the protein identifier as explained in the
legend of Figure 6.

Without OE2401F and OE2402F the Che system and the
flagellum are decoupled
The phenotypic characteristics of the deletion strains (see
Table 3 for an overview) demonstrated that OE2401F and
OE2402F are essential for the ability to control the direction of flagellar rotation, whereas the role of OE2404R
remained unclear. The Δ4 strains were not distinguishable
from wildtype strains in the phototaxis measurement and
with respect to the flagellar rotational bias, but produced
significantly smaller swarm rings. Hence, while it can be
said that OE2404R is involved in taxis signal transduction
in H. salinarum, it either fulfills a non-essential function or
it can be replaced by its homolog, OE2402F, with only
minor constraints.

Cells of the strains Δ1, Δ2, Δ2–4 displayed very weak or no
spontaneous switching, they did not respond to repellent
light stimulation, and were unable to form swarm rings.
They rotated their flagella almost exclusively clockwise.
None of the strains exhibited defects in flagellar motility.
Hence they behaved exactly like CheY and CheA deletion
strains [35,54].

A further possibility to explain the behavior of Δ1, Δ2, Δ2–
4 is an influence of the deleted proteins on the switch factor fumarate, which might act independently of the Che
system. A defect in fumarate signaling can cause a phenotype similar to the one observed for Δ1, Δ2, Δ2–4 [46].
However, the detected protein interactions with CheY
provide strong evidence that the proteins examined here
play a role in the action of CheY and not exclusively in
fumarate switching.
OE2401F and OE2402F act cooperatively
Bioinformatics analysis did not reveal much knowledge
for OE2401F. The PPI data suggest that OE2401F and
OE2402F act cooperatively to perform their function. This
idea is also supported by the genomic location of
OE2401F and its homologs in the haloarchaeal che gene
regions, where it is always adjacent to a DUF439 protein.
However, in the chemotaxis gene regions of other archaeal
species no homologs of OE2401F were found. Hence it
remains to be investigated if these proteins are restricted
to haloarchaea, or if similar proteins, coded elsewhere in
the genome, play a role in taxis signaling also in other
archaeal species.
OE2402F and OE2404R belong to a family of archaeaspecific Che proteins
The proteins OE2402F and OE2404R belong to the protein family DUF439 [58]. Proteins of this family were
found to be an integral part of archaeal chemotaxis gene
regions; they were not detected in other genomic contexts.
The DUF439 gene is adjacent to cheY in 10 of 17 che gene
regions, which supports the interaction found between
these proteins [69].

The only archaeal chemotaxis gene regions without a
DUF439 protein are the che2 regions of the three Methanosarcina species. Although these species are described as
non-motile [70], they probably have the capability to
swim by flagella since their genomes contain flagellins
and a complete set of fla genes (see [42], Additional file
6). Whether the Methanosarcina che2 region plays a role in

Page 10 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:56

controlling flagellar motility and, if so, how this is done
without DUF439 protein, remains to be elucidated.
Among the archaea with published genome sequences,
Methanocaldococcus jannaschii is the only species which
codes for a DUF439, but not for Che proteins. However,
the protein from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii is less conserved and truncated at the C-terminus while this is well
conserved in all other species. Hence it is likely that this
protein is either non-functional or fulfills a different function.
The presence of a DUF439 protein in (almost) all archaeal
che gene regions and the restriction to this genomic context indicate that these proteins constitute a hitherto
unrecognized family of archaeal chemotaxis proteins.

Conclusion
Overall, the PPI data and the observed deletion phenotypes strongly support a model where, in H. salinarum,
CheY-P cannot trigger flagellar motor switching without
OE2401F and OE2402F. Bioinformatics analysis has
demonstrated that proteins of the DUF439 family are not
only essential for chemo- and phototaxis in H. salinarum,
but comprise a family of general archaeal chemotaxis proteins. The Che proteins in archaea were identified by
homology to their bacterial counterparts [4-6], so the
absence of DUF439 in bacteria might explain why these
proteins were not recognized earlier. Since the archaeal
chemotaxis proteins identified in this study connect the
chemotaxis system to the archaeal flagellum, we propose
the name CheF for this protein family. Future experiments
will be necessary to determine the exact role of CheF in
archaeal flagellar motor switching.

Methods
Strains and growth conditions
H. salinarum strains R1 (DSM 671) and S9 [71] were
grown aerobically either in complex medium or in synthetic medium as described previously [72,73]. Transformed cells were grown with 10 μg ml-1 mevinolin or
0.15 μg ml-1 novobiocin. Transformation of H. salinarum
was performed essentially as described by [74]. E. coli
strain DH5α and transformants were grown in LB
medium at 37°C and supplemented with ampicillin (100
μg ml-1), kanamycin (25 μg ml-1), or chloramphenicol (50
μg ml-1), if necessary.
Protein-protein interaction analysis
Interactions between halobacterial proteins were determined by affinity purification of halobacterial protein
complexes using bait proteins fused to a cellulose-binding
domain. Components of the complex were identified by
mass spectrometry. Additional file 1 provides a detailed
description of this method.

Construction of in frame deletion mutations
In-frame deletion plasmids were constructed using the
vectors pMKK100 [50] and pMS3 (unpublished). All PCR
reactions were done with Phusion Polymerase according
to supplier's instructions and genomic DNA of H. salinarum strain R1 as template. 500 bp of sequence upstream
(us) and downstream (ds) of the targeted gene were
amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Additional
file 7. The corresponding PCR products were used as templates in a second PCR using the external primers (us_fo
and ds_re), resulting in a fusion product of us and ds
sequence. The fusion products were ligated into both
pMS3 and pMKK100, and the resulting deletion plasmids
verified by DNA sequencing of the insert.

Deletion mutants were generated by transformation of the
deletion plasmids into the wild type strains R1 and S9 and
subsequent cultivation without selection pressure as
described in [50]. Briefly, after transformation and plating
on X-gal and antibiotic containing plates two blue clones
were picked and grown in complex medium without antibiotics. After three passages of the culture, roughly 600
cells were plated on X-gal containing plates without antibiotics. Red colonies (red color indicates that these cells
have lost the integrated plasmid) were inoculated into
complex medium and screened for the loss of the target
gene by PCR using the primers spanning the flanking
regions.
Southern blot analysis
Deletions were verified by Southern blot analysis.
Genomic DNA of wild type and deletion strains was isolated and digested with BglI. DIG-labeled DNA probes
were generated via PCR amplification of the upstream or
the gene sequence from genomic DNA in the presence of
DIG-11-dUTP (Roche). The digested DNA was subjected
to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted to Hybond-N
nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and then UVcrosslinked. The use of blocking reagent, hybridization
procedure and chemiluminescent detection with CSPD
chemiluminescent substrate (Roche) was according to
standard protocols.
Complementation of deletions
Deleted genes were reintroduced into all deletion strains
in cis. Complementation plasmids for each deletion were
constructed by PCR amplification of the deleted gene(s)
together with the flanking regions from H. salinarum R1
genomic DNA using the external primers (us_fo, ds_re)
used for deletion plasmid construction. Inserts were
digested with the respective restriction enzymes and
cloned into pMS3, and the resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing of the insert. Each deletion strain was
transformed with the corresponding complementation
plasmid, and a double crossover triggered as described

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:56

above. Red colonies were inoculated into complex
medium and screened for reintroduction of the target
gene by PCR using the primers spanning the flanking
regions.
Quantitative Realtime RT-PCR
Total RNA from 5 ml late log-phase cultures was isolated
using the peqGOLD RNAPure™ system according to manufacturer's instructions. 3 μg total RNA were reverse transcribed with 50 pmol random hexamer primer (Applied
Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) using Superscript III
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The quantitative PCR
reactions were done in a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using the SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix Kit (Applied Biosystems). The final reaction volume was 25 μl with 0.5 μl of the reverse transcription reaction as template. Primers (see Additional file 7)
were applied in a final concentration of 0.5 μM. Controls
without template and control reactions amplifying a noncoding DNA region (the bop promoter) were included.
The PCR consisted of 10 min initial denaturation at 95°C
and 40 cycles of 15 sec 95°C and 1 min 60°C. Uniformity
of the product was assured by measuring the melting
curve of the product. Transcript level differences were calculated by the ΔΔCt method using the constitutively
expressed fdx gene (OE4217R) as internal standard. For all
calculations the mean-Ct of 2 replicate reactions was used.
Results were accepted if the Ct of both replicates differed
by less than 0.5, and if the difference to the lowest Ct of the
controls was at least 5.
Swarm plates
Semi-solid agar plates were prepared from complex
medium with 0.25% agar. Wild type and deletion cultures
were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 – 0.8. Fresh medium was
inoculated with equal amount of cells from the starter cultures and culturing repeated twice to achieve equal cell
densities in the final cultures. 10 μl of culture with an
OD600 of 0.6 – 0.8 were injected with a pipette tip into the
soft agar. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 37°C in
the dark.
Computerized cell tracking (Motion analysis)
Reversal frequencies of unstimulated cells and after application of a photophobic stimulus were measured with a
computerized cell tracking system [52]. The system consists of a phase-contrast microscope (BX51, Olympus)
equipped with a CCD camera (COHU, USA) which
allows stimulus-free observation of the cells using infrared
light. To measure the responses to light stimuli, the light
from two computer-controlled light sources (MT20-SPA,
Olympus) was applied to the cells. Cells were grown in 35
ml complex medium to an OD600 of 0.6 – 0.9. Cells were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/56

diluted with complex medium and arginine to an OD600
of 0.32 and a final arginine concentration of 0.1% (w/v).
Diluted cells were incubated in the dark at RT for at least
20 min. For measurement, 5 μl cell suspension were
pipetted on a slide and sealed under a cover slip with a
molten 2:1 (w/w) mixture of paraffin wax and vaseline.
Before starting the measurements, the specimen was incubated for 5 min on the heated stage (25°C). An experiment consisted of 20 single measurements, each
recording 5 s of cell movement. From this a 4 s interval
was analyzed for cell reversal.
For measuring the blue light response, a blue light pulse
(480 ± 50 nm excitation filter, 0.5 s duration, 5% intensity) was applied through the objective at the beginning of
the tracking interval. After each measurement the position
on the slide was changed to avoid repeated stimulation of
the same cells. For measurement of the response to an
orange light step-down, the cells were initially adapted for
5 min to orange light (580 ± 50 nm excitation filter,
applied through the condenser). At the beginning of the
tracking interval, the orange light was switched off for 4 s.
Prior to each subsequent measurement, the cells were
adapted again for 45 s.
Reversals are detected by an algorithm based on a Kalman
filter [52]. Briefly, for each time point, a prediction of the
cell position for some time span in the future is made
based on the last measurements. The prediction is compared with the actual position after the time span has
elapsed. Reversals are detected by this comparison (see
also [31]) with a false positive and false negative rate of 2
and 2.5% [52], respectively. The 95% confidence intervals
were calculated assuming a binomial distribution according to Lorenz [75].
By measuring known straight-swimming mutants
(cheY**, [35]), the false positive detection of reversal
events (tracking error) was determined to be maximally
2.5–5% in a 4 s observation interval [52].
Dark-field microscopy
To visualize the flagellar bundle, cells were investigated
on a dark-field microscope (Olympus BX50, equipped
with an USH-120D mercury lamp and U-DCW cardioid
immersion dark-field condenser). Cell culture and preparation of microscopic specimens was done as described
above. Cells were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 with complex
medium and arginine added to a final concentration of
0.1%. 50 μl immersion oil (ne = 1.5180, Leitz, Wetzlar,
Germany) were pipetted on the condenser, the slide put
onto the stage, and the condenser adjusted to maximal
height. The cells were focused and the condenser gradu-

ally lowered again (with permanent refocusing), until the
flagella became visible. Each specimen was used for one
hour at the most. The flagellar rotational bias was determined by counting the cells swimming with the flagellum
in front of the cell body (CCW) and cells swimming with
the flagellum behind the cell body (CW). Bipolarly flagellated cells were excluded from the analysis. Cells which
changed their swimming direction during observation
were counted with the first swimming direction.
Bioinformatic analysis
The multiple alignment of the DUF439 proteins was calculated using ClustalX [76,77] using standard parameters.
For phylogenetic analysis, a neighbor-joining tree was calculated from the multiple alignment applying the Phylip
package [78]. Again, standard parameters were used.
