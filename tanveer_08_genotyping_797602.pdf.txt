Abstract
Background: The incidence of tuberculosis in Pakistan is 181/100,000 population. However,
information about transmission and geographical prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains
and their evolutionary genetics as well as drug resistance remains limited. Our objective was to
determine the clonal composition, evolutionary genetics and drug resistance of M. tuberculosis
isolates from different regions of the country.
Methods: M. tuberculosis strains isolated (2003–2005) from specimens submitted to the laboratory
through collection units nationwide were included. Drug susceptibility was performed and strains
were spoligotyped.
Results: Of 926 M. tuberculosis strains studied, 721(78%) were grouped into 59 "shared types",
while 205 (22%) were identified as "Orphan" spoligotypes. Amongst the predominant genotypes
61% were Central Asian strains (CAS ; including CAS1, CAS sub-families and Orphan Pak clusters),
4% East African-Indian (EAI), 3% Beijing, 2% poorly defined TB strains (T), 2% Haarlem and LAM
(0.2). Also TbD1 analysis (M. tuberculosis specific deletion 1) confirmed that CAS1 was of "modern"
origin while EAI isolates belonged to "ancestral" strain types.
Prevalence of CAS1 clade was significantly higher in Punjab (P < 0.01, Pearsons Chi-square test) as
compared with Sindh, North West Frontier Province and Balochistan provinces. Forty six percent
of isolates were sensitive to five first line antibiotics tested, 45% were Rifampicin resistant, 50%
isoniazid resistant. MDR was significantly associated with Beijing strains (P = 0.01, Pearsons Chisquare test) and EAI (P = 0.001, Pearsons Chi-square test), but not with CAS family.
Conclusion: Our results show variation of prevalent M. tuberculosis strain with greater association
of CAS1 with the Punjab province. The fact that the prevalent CAS genotype was not associated
with drug resistance is encouraging. It further suggests a more effective treatment and control
programme should be successful in reducing the tuberculosis burden in Pakistan.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of morbidity and
mortality worldwide, causing more than 2 million deaths
a year [1,2]. Pakistan with a population of 140 million
and a growth rate of 3.5% [3] has the seventh highest
tuberculosis rate despite widespread BCG vaccination. TB
prevalence in Pakistan can be attributed to poor health
care systems and limited diagnostic and treatment modalities for TB[4]. The TB problem is also compounded by
multi-drug resistance (MDR, resistance to at least
rifampicin and isoniazid), WHO report suggests that globally 3% of M. tuberculosis isolates are MDR-TB[5]. Resistance to TB drugs is recognized in Pakistan[6,7]. While
community based information is lacking, laboratory data
suggests an increasing frequency of MDR from 14% in
1999 to 28% in 2004[6] and 47% in 2006[8].
International databases such as the SpolDB4.0 have
revealed the clonal structure of M. tuberculosis isolates in
different geographical settings. SpolDB4.0 data base further defines super families specific to certain locations[9].
Genotypic information has further expanded our understanding of strain prevalence and transmission [10-13]. A
few predominant genotypes circulating throughout the
world e.g. Beijing, Haarlem, and African clusters have
been associated with a number of major outbreaks [1416]. These major strain groups have been described as
being predominant pathotypes in the world [17]. The
abundance of polymorphism indicates that transposition
and homologous recombination are the major events
contributing to the diversity of M. tuberculosis strains [18].
In addition, polymorphism seen with different molecular
markers also describes mutual association. This supports
the hypothesis that M. tuberculosis has a strong clonal population structure [18]. In support of phylogeographical
population structure of M. tuberculosis, differences in
strain genetics may be responsible for the variation in
BCG efficacy [19-22].

stan, strains from the four provinces, Punjab, Sindh,
Balochistan and NWFP were spoligotyped. Genotypic
information was correlated with drug resistance to determine association between strain types and MDR. Predominant clades obtained were further analyzed to distinguish
between "ancestral" versus "modern" lineages of tubercle
bacilli based on the presence or absence of the TbD1
region.

Methods
Mycobacterial strain collection
This study was conducted on M. tuberculosis strains isolated at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) in
Karachi during the 3 year period 2003–2005. Specimens
were from collection points situated in all four provinces
of Pakistan. AKUH is a tertiary care hospital in Karachi
and its clinical microbiology laboratory receives specimens through more than 100 collection points situated in
all four provinces of Pakistan. All samples were delivered
within a period of 24 hrs of collection and were processed
for culture and sensitivity testing. Strains were stored at 70°c in 15% glycerol phosphate broth. During the study
period 6,067 samples were processed from which 2208
strains were isolated. Based on the stratified random sampling method[32], a total of 926 strains were included in
this study (It was ensured that only one sample per individual is included in our analysis). The largest 234 (25%)
were from 14 different locations in Karachi. A further 691
strains were from the 4 provinces of Pakistan (excluding
Karachi); 256 from Punjab, 224 from Sindh, 207 from the
North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and 5 from Balochistan. We were not able to classify patients on basis of
prior therapy since treatment history was not available.
The M. tuberculosis isolates studied included both pulmonary (n = 850) and extra-pulmonary (n = 76) samples.

Predominant M. tuberculosis clades from the Indian subcontinent include Central Asian strain (CAS) [9,23] and
Beijing strains [11,24-27]. Central Asian strain 1 (CAS1)
are defined by absence of spacers 4–7 and 23–34 [28].
While, Beijing strains were characterized with the absence
of 1–34 spacers in direct repeat region (DR). Beijing
strains are reported to constitute about 50% of strains in
far East-Asia and 13% of isolates globally[29]. East African-Indian strains, the T clade and Haarlem strains have
also reported from India, Afghanistan and Iran[30,31]. In
Pakistan predominance of CAS1 (39%) with a 6% prevalence of Beijing isolates has previously been reported [32].

Microbiological methods
Mycobacterial cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing
Mycobacterial cultures were performed on liquid as well
as solid media. Respiratory samples were decontaminated
using N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NALC) sodium hydroxide prior
to culture. Samples from sterile sites were processed without decontamination[35]. All specimens were concentrated by centrifugation (3000 × g) for 30 minutes and
sediments cultured at 37°C using BACTEC 460 (Becton
Dickinson Diagnostic Instruments Systems) and Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) medium. The growth index of inoculated
BACTEC vials was checked for four weeks, LJ slants were
incubated for up to 8 weeks. M. tuberculosis was identified
by BACTEC NAP TB differentiation test (Becton Dickinson, USA).

Globally, MDR-TB outbreaks have been associated with
Beijing and Haarlem families [33,34]. In order to understand the population structure of M. tuberculosis in Paki-

Susceptibility testing was performed using standard agar
proportion method on enriched Middle brook 7H10
medium (BBL) at the following final drug concentrations;

BMC Infectious Diseases 2008, 8:171

rifampicin 1 ug/ml and 5 ug/ml, isoniazid 0.2 ug/ml and
1 ug/ml, streptomycin 2 ug/ml and 10 ug/ml and ethambutol 5 ug/ml and 10 ug/ml, ethionamide 5 ug/ml, capreomycin 10 ug/ml, cycloserine 30 ug/ml and ciprofloxacin
2 ug/ml. [36-38]. Pyrazinamide sensitivity was carried out
using BACTEC 7H12 medium pH6.0 at 100 ug/ml
(BACTEC™ PZA test medium, Becton Dickinson USA) in
accordance with manufacturers instructions. To ensure
selection of high level resistance strains for purposes of
this study however, only resistance to the higher concentrations were used for analysis. Multidrug resistance
(MDR) was defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and
rifampicin.
Molecular methods
Mycobacteria were cultured on 7H10 Middle brook agar.
DNA extraction was carried out from mycobacterial colonies using the CTAB method[39]. Spoligotyping was carried out using a commercially available kit from Isogen
Bioscience BV, Maarssen, The Netherlands according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Spoligotyping based on
the 43 spacers of the DR region of M. tuberculosis complex
was carried out using primers DRa 5'GGTTTTGGGT
CTGACGAC3' and DRb 5'CCGAGAGGGGACGGAAAC 3'
as originally described by Kamerbeek et al[24].
TbD1 analysis
TbD1; "M. tuberculosis specific deletion 1" consists of two
genes encoding membrane protein (mmpS6 and
mmpL6). TbD1 was originally identified as a 2153-bp
fragment[40]. TbD1 deletion analysis was done by PCR as
described by Brosch et al[41]. Two isolates from each cluster of CAS1 and its sub-families were tested for both primers complementary to flanking sequences and internal
sequences in order to confirm deleted region (TbD1) in
our Mycobacterium isolates. Sequences inside or flanking
regions were obtained from the website http://
www.pnas.org/cgi/data/052548299/DC1/1/[11].
Data analysis
Spoligotyping results were entered in the Bionumerics
Software, Applied Maths Program, BioSystematica, UK.
Dendrograms were generated using the unweighted pairgroup method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) calculation. A cluster (shared types) was defined as two or more
isolates from different patients with identical spoligotype
patterns, whereas, non-clustered strains had 'orphan' spoligotype patterns. The spoligotypes were compared with
the most prevalent M. tuberculosis subfamilies as identified
by the World Spoligotyping Database SpolDB4.0 of Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe http://www.pasteur-guade
loupe.fr/tb/bd_myco.html[42]. The SpolDB4.0 information system is an automated Access-based labeling and
matching system for spoligotyping. SpolDB4.0 which
included ~40,000 isolates split into 1,939 shared types

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/171

and ~3,530 orphan profiles. We compared each of our
clusters with the shared types (STs) present in SpolDB4.0
[29].
Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to determine statistical association between strain types and specific parameters, Statistical Package for Social Science Software (SPSS,
USA) was used for analysis. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Considering that the isolates were independent the association between cluster types and drug
resistance was analysed by the use of multilogistic regression model. The magnitude of the association was estimated by using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
interval (CIs)

Results
Study population
A total of nine hundred and twenty six M. tuberculosis clinical isolates were studied. These were from pulmonary (n
= 850) and extra-pulmonary (n = 76) sources. Of the pulmonary isolates studied, 411 (48%) were from the province of Sindh of which 195 (23%) were from Karachi; 232
(27%) were from the province of Punjab; 202(22%) from
the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and 5 (0.4%)
from Balochistan. Out of seventy six extra-pulmonary isolates 47 (5%) were from Sindh, 24 (3%) from Punjab and
5 (0.5%) from NWFP.

An age-wise analysis of the M. tuberculosis clinical isolates
showed that four hundred and forty seven (48%) isolates
were from patients aged 15–30 years (214 males, 233
females), 246 isolates (26%) were from patient's aged 31–
45 years (141 males, 105 females), while 233 isolates
were from the 45+ years (25%) age group (154 males, 79
females).
Spoligotyping of M. tuberculosis isolates
All M. tuberculosis strains were spoligotyped and their data
analyzed using UPGMA calculation in the Bionumerics
software. Seven hundred and twenty one (78%) isolates
grouped into 59 different "shared types" while 205 (22%)
isolates had 'orphan' spoligotypes. Central Asian strains
61% (n = 568) were found to be the most predominant
genotype. Within the CAS genogroup, the CAS1 strain was
predominant while, different levels of similarity were
noted between CAS1 and other strains in the study population; 17 strains had 96% similarity, 22 strains had 92%,
and 29 strains had 88% similarity to CAS1. A further 124
(13%) isolates were found to be part of the CAS super
family of strains.

The shared types identified in this study are presented in
Fig 1 in order of descending cluster size. We have previously identified cluster groups Pak 1–10 in our population [32]. An additional 26 clusters, Pak 11–36 not

defined within SpolDB4.0 are described here. Orphan
Spoligotypes Pak 1–12 displayed 92–98% similarity with
CAS1 and its sub-families and were classified as CAS genotype strains. Manu strains characterized by absence of
spacer 33–34 have been included in CAS genogroup [10].
These are presumed to be the probable ancestor of CAS
strain types. Pak15, Pak27 and Pak33 showed 88% similarity to EAI strains and were classified with East AfricanIndian genotype. Whereas, Pak16 and Pak35 had 82%
similarity to Haarlem genotype strains.

tuberculosis strains were tested for the TbD1 region, 2
strains each from CAS1 and its sub-families (ST25, ST428,
ST754, ST794, ST1327, ST288, ST142, ST1093, ST203,
ST100, ST54, ST458, and ST21) and in Beijing, Haarlem,
EAI3 and EAI5 genotypes. TbD1 region was found to be
deleted in all of the above genotypes studied except for the
EAI lineages, confirming that the predominant CAS1
strains in this population belongs to a "modern" TB lineage while that EAI strains harboring the TbD1 region and
are likely to be "ancestral strains"[43].

An overall analysis of strain distribution showed that 3/25
(12%) of Beijing strains were isolated from the under 15
years age group as opposed to 8/544 (1.5%) of CAS
strains, 3/205 (1.5%) orphan strains and 12/152 (7.9%)
of the other shared types (Fig 2). Our data suggests a significant association of Beijing strains with the younger age
group (P value = 0.03, Chi square test).

Pulmonary versus extra pulmonary isolates
We next determined genotypes of M. tuberculosis strains as
identified from either pulmonary [n = 850; Sputum (n =
722) and Bronchial lavage (n = 128)] and extra pulmonary sources [n = 76; Pleural fluid (n = 30), Pus (n = 26),
Urine (n = 8) and Tissue (n = 12)]. Table 1 lists these in
sequence of genotypes given in Fig 1.

M. tuberculosis genotypes distribution from the four provinces of the country is illustrated in (Fig 3). The largest
number of strains was from Sindh followed by Punjab,
NWFP and Balochistan. Central Asian strain 1 (CAS1),
CAS sub-families (CAS_DEHLI, CAS, U, MANU1 and
MANU2) and Beijing strains were prevalent across the
country, while EAI strains, T1 family, LAM and Haarlem
strains were also present in the different provinces. A comparison of spoligotype distributions between the four
regions indicated that the occurrence of CAS1 clade was
significantly higher in the Punjab (P < 0.01, Pearsons Chisquare test) as compared with Sindh, NWFP and Balochistan.

There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of shared spoligotypes i.e in CAS1, Beijing, EAI,
Haarlem, T, LAM and other Pak clusters between their pulmonary and extra pulmonary sources. However, 33% of
the isolates from extra pulmonary sources were orphan
types, compared with 21% of the pulmonary isolates and
this difference was statistically significant (Pearsons Chisquare test P = 0.018; 95% CI, 2.0 to 23.5).

was determined in CAS genotype including sub-groups of
CAS family and related Pak-clusters. Of the 926 isolates
included in this study, 405 (44%) were sensitive to all 5
first line agents tested and 402 (43%) were MDR.
The association between M. tuberculosis genotypes and
first line drug resistance was assessed by logistic model in
comparison with CAS genotype, a significantly higher
resistance was observed amongst 'Orphan' isolates and to
streptomycin (P value = 0.001, OR; 2.35, CI; 1.68–3.29)
and ethambutol (P value = 0.001, OR; 2.15, CI; 1.57–
2.93) while, Beijing strains showed higher resistance to
streptomycin (P value = 0.041, OR; 2.6; CI; 1.04–6.52).
Analysis of cluster types further showed that Beijing
strains (P value = 0.01, Pearsons Chi-square test), and EAI
(P value = 0.001, Pearsons Chi-square test) were associated with MDR. The MDR rate in the predominant CAS

genotype was not found to be statistically significant (P
value = 0.36, Pearsons Chi-square test).

Discussion
This study presents novel information regarding genotypic diversity and drug resistance of M. tuberculosis strains
in Pakistan. We found that 411 (44%) of 926 study isolates to be CAS1 or ST26 strains [25], confirming previous
reports of 39% prevalence of CAS1 amongst M. tuberculosis strains [32]. The results further showed that in addition
to ST26 the majority of spoligotypes belonged to the CAS
genotype. CAS1 has been also identified by recent studies
as a predominant strain in Delhi[25] and Mumbai[44].
Prevalence of Beijing strains in our study at 3% (n = 25)
compares well with data from Delhi, where 8% of 105 isolates are reported to be of Beijing family[25]. We further
identified 36 clusters (Pak clusters) not identical with any
of the STs described within SpolDB4.0.

Comparison of pulmonary and extra pulmonary sources
showed a significant association of 'Orphan' spoligotypes
with extra pulmonary disease. This difference between
pulmonary and extrapulmonary spoligotypes may be
attributed to the greater ease with which pulmonary
strains may be transmitted via aerosol routes, leading to
greater transmission and strain clustering.
The global population structure of M. tuberculosis is
reportedly defined by six phylogeographical lineages,
each associated with specific human populations http://
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.052548299[29,45].
It has been suggested that particular lineages of M. tuberculosis might be adapted to specific human populations
and maladapted to others[45]. Strain differences in different geographical regions may be linked to different ethnic
subpopulations in these regions, and their migration histories [46].

ratio. This hypothesis is supported by a recent report[30]
suggesting that TB in India is essentially caused by historic
clones of tubercle bacilli which circulate with geographic
predilection.
Deletion analysis demonstrated the absence of TbD1
region in CAS1 and its sub-families. A recent study [43]
also suggests that CAS1 family evolved as a result of an
evolutionary event causing TbD1 deletion from a common ancestor[18,41]. The study further suggests that
strains within CAS genotype are related through minor
genetic changes. The similarity seen in our study between
Pak clusters 1–12 and CAS genotype suggests an evolution
from a common ancestor belonging to the same phylogenetic lineage CAS.

The CAS strains have been shown to be predominant
[30,47] in this region, the distribution of CAS1 strains was
greater in the province of Punjab (P < 0.01, Pearsons Chisquare test) as compared with Sindh, NWFP, and Balochistan. This could be due to the shared border and similar population mix between Punjab now in Pakistan
(West Punjab prior to the 1947 partition of India), and
East Punjab, (now Punjab, North India).

Haarlem4 and T1 were also identified amongst our isolates. It is reported that more than 60% of ST127 (H4,
modern type) are localized in Iran and Russia. Their presence in our population suggests the role of traditional
migratory routes from central Asia in the history of tuberculosis. In addition to the predominant groups, we also
found clusters of rare/localized shared types listed in
SpolDB4.0 that have previously been found only in North
America, Australia and Europe (CAS1_KILI) as well as
those found in neighboring Iran and India (LAM 9, LAM
6).

Although not statistically significant, East African-Indian
strains were more prevalent in Sindh. The fact that 4% of
our isolates were East African-Indian is comparable to an
earlier study from Delhi, reporting 8% EAI strains in their
population [25]. Both these figures are in contrast to a
study from Southern India indicating an 80% prevalence
of TbD1+/EAI isolates amongst their samples [43]. It has
been hypothesized that lineages that are rare in specific
human population are not adapted to spreading within
these populations and show a significantly lower case-rate

In the absence of national surveillance for drug resistance
in Pakistan, the majority of published reports rely upon
laboratory data based on passive specimen collection.
There is thus little information about the burden of MDR
at a community level. WHO estimates suggest an MDR
rate of under 3% amongst new cases and 20–40%
amongst previously treated TB cases[48]. A recent report
of 1.8% MDR-TB, in untreated cases in Pakistan corroborates the WHO estimates [49]. Since the samples in our
study were not collected through active case finding, the

high MDR rate noted in our specimens is likely to reflect
the large number of previously treated patients included
in this study. This however, cannot be confirmed due to
absence of prior treatment history for our patients.
In agreement with an earlier report [32] CAS1 and related
CAS sub-family spoligotypes in this study showed no correlation with MDR-TB. However, a higher relative risk of
MDR amongst Beijing strains was noted. Association
between Beijing strains and MDR varies worldwide
[50,51], A recent study from Mumbai, India reported a

higher frequency of Beijing strains (35%) amongst MDR
isolates [44]. The distinctive feature of Beijing MDR-TB
outbreak is accelerated transmission as compared with
other MDR-TB outbreaks[52]. Further, East African-Indian
strain was also found to be associated with MDR supported by a study from Iran [53]. Recent studies moreover
suggests that MDR-TB strains may be responsible for
emergence of XDR-TB cases [53,54].
The higher occurrence of streptomycin resistance in Beijing strains as compared to CAS genotype has importance

in that particular lineage of M. tuberculosis might harbor
polymorphisms which make them resistant to certain
anti-tuberculosis drugs.

In our study population, association of Beijing strains
with a younger age group (<15 years) is concerning. It suggests that Beijing strains may be an emerging strain type
and is likely to increasingly contribute to the burden of
drug resistant tuberculosis in this region.

Conclusion
The identification of a dominant spoligotype, CAS, similar to previously identified isolates in India and Bangladesh illustrates an important trend in the M. tuberculosis
infection pattern in the South Asian region. All predominant clusters apart from CAS1 strains were equally distributed in the country suggest a continual transmission of
strains. This data presents a comprehensive evaluation of
the strain-to-strain variability in M. tuberculosis, important
in phenotypic consequences, also these phylogeographical strain variation may affect the development of new
diagnostic tools, drugs, and vaccines for treatment in the
endemic region.
