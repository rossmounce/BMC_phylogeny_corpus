Abstract
Background: Learning the function of genes is a major goal of computational genomics. Methods
for inferring gene function have typically fallen into two categories: 'guilt-by-profiling', which
exploits correlation between function and other gene characteristics; and 'guilt-by-association',
which transfers function from one gene to another via biological relationships.
Results: We have developed a strategy ('Funckenstein') that performs guilt-by-profiling and guiltby-association and combines the results. Using a benchmark set of functional categories and input
data for protein-coding genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Funckenstein was compared with a
previous combined strategy. Subsequently, we applied Funckenstein to 2,455 Gene Ontology terms.
In the process, we developed 2,455 guilt-by-profiling classifiers based on 8,848 gene characteristics
and 12 functional linkage graphs based on 23 biological relationships.
Conclusion: Funckenstein outperforms a previous combined strategy using a common benchmark
dataset. The combination of 'guilt-by-profiling' and 'guilt-by-association' gave significant
improvement over the component classifiers, showing the greatest synergy for the most specific
functions. Performance was evaluated by cross-validation and by literature examination of the topscoring novel predictions. These quantitative predictions should help prioritize experimental study
of yeast gene functions.

Introduction

The rapid development of high-throughput technologies has
made it possible to study the properties and relationships of

thousands of genes in parallel [1-6]. A current challenge in
genomic analysis is to combine this increasingly rich trove of
evidence to infer biological function. The sheer volume of

Genome Biology 2008, 9:S7

information makes manual human evaluation impracticable.
Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop improved automated algorithms to assist and accelerate the process of functional annotation.
The transfer of function annotation from one gene to another
via biological relationships ('guilt-by-association') has been
widely used, especially on the basis of homology relationships. However, accurate functional annotation via homology
often requires high sequence similarity between homologous
proteins [7], and many proteins do not have homologs with
known function. Function may also be assigned to a gene
based on a profile of its characteristics ('guilt-by-profiling').
Sequence-based guilt-by-profiling methods, for example,
assign functions based on matches to motifs derived from
multiple sequence alignments [8-11].
Sequence-based relationships and characteristics are better
suited to predict catalytic activity or structural role rather
than involvement in a biological process, for example,
osmotic stress response. Biological relationships other than
homology have proven useful in guilt-by-association studies,
including protein-protein physical interactions [12], genetic
interactions derived from examination of double-perturbation and phenotyping experiments [13], correlated gene
expression [14], or correlated phylogenetic profiles [15]. Algorithms to predict function from interactions have evolved
from simple inspection of neighborhood interactions [12,16]
to consider the global structure of the interaction network
[17,18].
Beyond sequence patterns, a wide variety of biological characteristics has proven useful in guilt-by-profiling function
prediction, including phenotype [19,20], subcellular localization [21], gene chromosome neighborhood [22], previously
known functional annotations [23], and membership within
gene expression clusters [24,25] or protein complexes [5].
Many guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association efforts have
been reported. Some guilt-by-profiling studies have exploited
gene-gene relationships by transforming them into gene
characteristics [14], and some guilt-by-association studies
have exploited gene characteristics by treating shared annotation with a gene characteristic as a gene-gene relationship.
Only a few attempts have been made to integrate both types
of inference. In particular, Deng and coworkers [26] inferred
gene function by exploiting both gene-gene relationships and
gene characteristics. This approach, discussed further below,
used protein pattern annotation and protein complex information as gene characteristics, and also exploited protein
interaction, genetic interaction, and expression correlation
relationships.
Here, we introduce Funckenstein, a new method combining
both guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association approaches
to predict protein function. Initially, Funckenstein uses sepa-

rate classifiers for guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association.
It can integrate a very large number of gene characteristics
and gene-gene relationships to infer functions, thanks to the
scalability of its component classifiers. Funckenstein then
combines prediction results using logistic regression optimized for precision versus recall performance, achieving a
better performance than either approach alone.
Here we apply Funckenstein to a benchmark of integrated
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic data used previously to
predict broad gene functions, and show that Funckenstein
achieves higher precision at all levels of recall. Because predictions of more specific gene functions are generally more
useful to experimental biologists, we also apply Funckenstein
to score 2,455 Gene Ontology (GO) terms for all protein-coding genes in S. cerevisiae. The results are assessed by crossvalidation and by evaluation of top predictions by an expert
curator from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD).
Together, the results show that Funckenstein achieves high
precision in cross-validation and in the prediction of novel
functions.

Results
A method combining guilt-by-profiling with guilt-byassociation
We have developed an algorithm (Funckenstein) that combines both guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association to make
gene function predictions. Guilt-by-profiling was performed
using the random forest (RF) method [27]. However, for comparison we also performed guilt-by-profiling using a probabilistic decision tree (PDT) method [28] with an early-stopping
criterion to limit over-fitting. Guilt-by-association was performed in two steps: first, generate a functional linkage (FL)
graph [29], that is, a graph with edge weights reflecting the
probability that two genes share a sufficiently specific GO
term; and second, use the FL graph to assign a score to each
(candidate gene, GO term) combination based on the weight
of links between the candidate gene and genes currently
assigned to that GO term. The RF and FL predictions were
then combined via a logistic regression model that optimizes
precision versus recall performance. A full description of the
algorithm and optimization of its parameters may be found in
Materials and methods.

Performance evaluation using a previous benchmark
A combined approach was applied previously to predict S.
cerevisiae gene functions. Specifically, a Markov random
field (MRF) guilt-by-association approach integrated information from protein interactions, genetic interactions, and
gene expression correlation [26]. This approach also
employed guilt-by-profiling, in that a gene-specific prior was
calculated from Pfam protein sequence patterns [8] and protein complex membership using a naïve Bayes (NB) method
[30]. We will refer to this combined approach as 'MRF-NB'.

MRF-NB was applied previously to protein-coding S. cerevisiae genes to predict a small set of functional categories
derived from literature annotation by the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) [31]. MIPS functional categories are hierarchical, with top-level functions
describing very general protein functions (for example,
'metabolism') and lower levels describing more specific functions (for example, 'proton driven symporter'). The MRF-NB
approach was applied to 13 top-level MIPS functional categories and trained on the 3,588 yeast genes that had been
assigned at least one of these categories (see Table 1 for
details). For the purposes of comparison, we trained Funckenstein on the same data sets used for the MRF analysis and
compared our cross-validation performance with the crossvalidation performance reported previously [26].
To train Funckenstein's guilt-by-profiling classifiers, we used
protein sequence pattern and complex membership data. For
guilt-by-association analysis, we used four types of pairwise
biological relationships: pairwise physical and genetic interactions, correlated gene expression (with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9), and interaction according to a largescale affinity purification dataset [5]. When using affinity
purification-derived interactions for predictions, we considered both the 'spoke' model (interactions defined to exist
between bait and prey proteins) and the 'matrix' model (interaction defined not only between bait and prey protein, but
also between prey proteins purified with the same bait) [32].
Because the 'matrix' model gave a slightly worse prediction
performance (Table 2), we used the 'spoke' model for affinity
purification-derived interactions.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves reflect the
tradeoff between recall and false positive rate that can be
achieved by tuning a given method. Here, false positive rate is
defined as the fraction of (gene, MIPS category) pairs that
were predicted to be positive, among all pairs that are incorrect annotations according to the MIPS annotation. The ROC
curves for Funckenstein and MRF-NB (Figure 1a) reflect a
similar trend to that observed in the precision versus recall
curves, with Funckenstein yielding an area under the ROC
curve (AUC) of 0.88, compared with an AUC of 0.75 for MRFNB. An AUC of 50% would indicate performance equal to that
of random guessing and an AUC of 100% would indicate perfect performance. Although AUC is a measure of overall performance that is used for many applications, it is less
appropriate here. Because the total number of unannotated
gene/MIPS functional category pairs far exceeds the number
of annotations, only performance at extremely low false-positive rates will be relevant to most users. Furthermore, most
biologists are more interested in precision (fraction of predictions that are correct) than in false positive rate as defined
above. Therefore, we used the precision-recall curve to evaluate prediction performance in all subsequent analyses.
The precision that a given user requires depends on their
application. Since each of our predictions is accompanied by
a quantitative measure of confidence, users may consider
only the highest-precision predictions. Alternatively, users
wishing to select candidate genes for further study - for example, for medium-scale genomic experiments - may wish to
include a greater number of 'trues' at the expense of precision.
Predictions offer a principled form of triage to reduce the

Figure 1b, which describes the tradeoff between precision and
recall for various score thresholds, shows that Funckenstein
outperforms MRF-NB in predicting MIPS functional categories. Funckenstein yields a higher precision than MRF-NB
across the full range of recall values obtained in the MRF-NB
study. For example, with a recall of 50% (that is, when 50% of
all MIPS annotations are predicted), a precision of 75% is
achieved, compared with 67% by MRF-NB. For approxi-

result, the precision-recall curve of MRF-NB is truncated at a

achieves a higher recall than MRF-NB at every level of precision. As a single overall measure of performance, we computed the area under the precision-recall curve. (In truncated

having precision corresponding to that of the nearest
observed recall value.) The area under the precision-recall
curve of Funckenstein was 0.651, greater than the 0.522
observed for the MRF-NB approach.
We also investigated the individual contributions of Funckenstein classifiers of each type (guilt-by-profiling or guilt-byassociation) in predicting MIPS functional categories. The
guilt-by-profiling classifier outperforms the guilt-by-association classifier (Figure 1b) with precision-recall curve areas of
0.621 and 0.364, respectively. In fact, the guilt-by-profiling
classifier alone already outperforms MRF-NB (area 0.522).
Figure 1 also shows the performance of an alternative PDT
guilt-by-profiling method in predicting MIPS functional categories. The RF method is undoubtedly an improvement over
the PDT method (area 0.621 versus 0.504). This supports our
choice to use the RF method for all other guilt-by-profiling
predictions described here.
Combining the two component classifiers led to better performance than was achieved with either alone. However, the
improvement of Funckenstein over the guilt-by-profiling
classifier was modest for the MIPS benchmark (area of 0.651
compared with 0.621 under that of guilt-by-profiling classifier). This could be because of the very limited number of
available interactions in this dataset. More substantial
improvement would be expected as more relationships are
included.
Note that differences in component classifier performance
may be due either to algorithmic differences or to the value of
the features used for prediction, and the comparison above
does not separate these effects. Therefore, we also investigated the effect of transforming gene features into gene-gene
relationships for use by the FL classifier. Specifically, we
treated shared annotation with a Pfam domain as a gene-gene
relationship (information found in expression cluster membership features was already available to the FL classifier as
protein interactions). This substantially improved the performance of the FL classifier to an area under the precisionrecall curve of 0.451 (versus the previous 0.364 area). However, use of the improved FL guilt-by-association classifier
within Funckenstein actually reduced its overall performance
(area 0.651 versus 0.637). One explanation is that the inclusion of the same evidence type in both component classifiers
may lead to 'over-counting' of evidence and, thus, a slightly
weaker Funckenstein. Thus, it may be important to include
component classifiers using relatively independent input features for the success of Funckenstein.

Application to Gene Ontology terms using an
expanded integrated dataset
Although it enabled us to compare Funckenstein and MRFNB methods directly, the previously defined set of functional
categories has the drawback of being somewhat non-specific.
(For example, it is not immediately clear what specific follow-

up experiment would test the hypothesis that a gene is
involved in 'metabolism'.) Therefore, we sought to apply
Funckenstein to predict more specific GO functional terms.
We also expanded the scope of the data used to make predictions. We assembled data for 21 gene characteristic types and
23 experimentally determined gene-gene relationship types
(shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively).
Terms in the GO vocabulary are organized within a rooted
directed acyclic graph with three branches that describe biological process (BP), molecular function (MF), and cellular
component (CC), respectively. Within each GO branch, a
child GO term may descend from multiple parental GO terms.
The vocabulary is structured such that annotation with a
given GO term implies 'propagation' of this annotation to all
ancestral terms. We obtained GO annotation for all proteincoding S. cerevisiae genes from SGD and, for each gene, we
assigned ancestral GO terms implied by annotated descendent terms.
For GO term prediction, we selected yeast protein-coding
genes annotated by at least one of the attribute types listed in
Tables 3 and 4. Out of these 6,368 genes, the numbers of 'verified', 'uncharacterized', and 'dubious' open reading frames
were 4,476, 1,312, and 580, respectively, when we initiated
the work. In total, 5,790 genes were assigned to at least one
GO term, including all 'verified' and 'uncharacterized' open
reading frames.
Some GO terms describe extremely general functions; for
example, 'catalytic activity' (GO:0003824) had 1,885 associated genes. To focus on specific GO terms with the greatest
potential to guide future experimentation, we considered only
GO terms assigned to 300 or fewer genes. We excluded GO
terms assigned to fewer than three genes, because of the
extreme difficulty in developing a classifier with such a limited number of positive training examples. After this filtering,
2,455 GO terms remained. For convenience, we separated GO
terms into 12 categories corresponding to all combinations of
three GO branches (BP, MF, and CC) and four specificity levels (Table 5). Specificity levels are defined according to the
number of annotated genes: 3 to 10, 11 to 30, 31 to 100, and
101 to 300 genes. To avoid circularity due to logical dependency between GO terms, we have not allowed classifiers to
predict GO terms using other GO terms. The functional linkage graphs used in guilt-by-association analysis were trained
separately for each of the 12 GO categories, and the logistic
regression parameter for combining guilt-by-association and
guilt-by-profiling predictions was optimized separately for
each GO category by maximizing the area under the corresponding precision versus recall curve.
GO term predictions using both guilt-by-profiling and guiltby-association classifiers were made for the 6,368 S. cerevisiae protein-coding genes that are either annotated with a GO
term or have at least one gene characteristic or interaction.

This resulted in a score for each of 6,368 S. cerevisiae genes
for each of 2,455 GO terms for a total of 15,633,440 quantitative annotation scores.
We also assessed variants of the FL classifier using relationships defined by shared annotation (as discussed above for
MIPS function predictions). Results from the variant FL component classifier were combined with the RF predictions to
yield variants of Funckenstein. As described above for MIPS
function predictions, we evaluated prediction performance by
calculating precision and recall at different quantitative score
thresholds and by calculating total area under the precisionrecall curve within each of the 12 GO categories. Performance
was calculated for individual component classifiers, and for
variants of Funckenstein, the combined classifier (Figures 2
and 3, respectively, with underlying values shown in Table 6).
The addition of relationships based on shared annotation
improved predictions for MF attributes, but not BP and CC
attributes (Figure 2 and Table 6). For example, the area under
the precision-recall curve for MF attributes with 101 to 300
genes was 0.55 for the FL guilt-by-association classifier using
shared annotation relationships alone, in contrast to 0.24
using only direct gene-gene relationships. By contrast, the FL

classifiers for BP and CC attributes with 101 to 300 genes
yielded precision-recall areas of 0.169 and 0.271, respectively,
using only shared annotation relationships - compared with
0.373 and 0.391, respectively, for the FL classifiers using only
direct relationships. It is intuitively reasonable that shared
annotation with protein motifs would be most useful for
inferring similar molecular function rather than similar BP
and CC attributes, and that direct relationships such as protein interaction would be more useful for inferring similar BP
and CC annotation. The FL classifier variant that used both
shared annotation and direct relationships outperformed
variants using either type of relationship alone, especially for
predicting MF attributes.
The RF guilt-by-profiling classifier substantially outperformed the best FL guilt-by-association classifier in predicting MF attributes. For example, the precision-recall area of
the RF classifier for MF attributes with specificity of 11 to 30
genes was 0.557, in contrast to 0.383 for the best FL classifier,
suggesting that the presence of particular sequence motifs (or
combinations of sequence motifs) is more helpful in inferring
molecular function than are gene-gene relationships. In predicting BP and CC attributes, the opposite was true. The FL
classifier outperformed the RF classifier in predicting BP and

By combining the guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association
classifiers, Funckenstein generally outperforms either classifier alone in all three GO branches (Figure 3 and Table 6), and
the combination shows particular synergy for BP and CC
attributes. For example, for BP attributes with 31 to 100
genes, the precision-recall area of the best Funckenstein classifier is 0.454, compared with 0.349 by the best individual
classifier, a 30% improvement. For CC attributes with 31 to
100 genes, the precision-recall area increases by 18% from
0.496 for the best individual classifier to 0.586 by the best
Funckenstein classifier. The improvement for MF attributes
is not substantial, with the best performance coming from the
RF classifier, which relies on the presence or absence of protein motif patterns.
Interestingly, the best Funckenstein classifier is not based on
the best guilt-by-association component classifier. The
Funckenstein variant based on the FL classifier using only
direct relationships excels in most GO categories, and is particularly superior for MF attributes. Consequently, we chose
the Funckenstein with guilt-by-association classifier using
only direct relationships as our final predictor. As discussed

above for MIPS function predictions, it appears that complementarity of individual classifiers is more important than use
of individually optimized component classifiers.
The final version of Funckenstein achieves high prediction
precision in predicting GO terms. For example, at a recall rate
at 50%, Funckenstein achieves a prediction precision for GO
terms with 101 to 300 genes of 48%, 89% and 64% for BP, MF
and CC branches, respectively. In all three branches, it is clear
that these precision levels could greatly facilitate the choice of
candidate genes for follow-up experiments - precision levels
of only approximately 3% would be expected from unguided
'brute force' experimentation. For the most specific GO terms
annotated with only 3 to 10 genes, Funckenstein still achieves
(at 50% recall) precision rates of 14%, 59%, and 73% for BP,
MF, and CC branches, respectively, which may be compared
with a corresponding unguided precision of approximately
0.09%.
Because there were no experimentally determined gene-gene
relationships for any dubious genes in our data set, performance of the above-mentioned classifiers was based on verified
and uncharacterized protein-coding genes (5,790 genes in
total). To generate scores for dubious genes, we used scores
obtained by the guilt-by-profiling classifier alone. This
resulted in a total of 15,569,760 quantitative prediction scores
(2,455 GO terms × 6,368 genes).
To investigate trends associated with verified, uncharacterized, or dubious genes, we counted the number of predictions
for genes of each type that fell into each of ten prediction
score intervals. Based on the correspondence of prediction
score to observed precision, these intervals were chosen to
have an expected precision of 0 to 0.1, 0.1 to 0.2, and so on.
Within each interval, we compared the number of predictions
for verified or uncharacterized genes with that of dubious
genes (Figure 4). As expected, uncharacterized and verified
genes tended to have higher precision scores than dubious
genes, with verified genes tending to have the best scores.

novel predictions are the most interesting product of a quantitative gene annotation system.
To assess the best-scoring novel predictions according to current literature, we selected 120 high-scoring novel predictions (the top 10 from each of the 12 GO categories). Within
each GO category, we selected predictions in order of score.
To avoid over-weighting particular genes or GO terms in our
evaluation, we excluded predictions involving a gene or GO
term already associated with a higher-scoring prediction
within the same category of GO terms. Each novel prediction
was assessed by an expert curator within the SGD group (JP,
with guidance from JMC).
Each prediction was assigned with one of the following labels:
A, 'known correct', that is, having strong supporting evidence
in the literature that was not yet captured by a GO annotation
in SGD; B, 'likely true', that is, having supporting evidence
that is inconclusive; C, 'unclear'; D, 'unlikely to be true', that
is, having evidence which either mitigates against the prediction or which suggests an incompatible annotation; or E,
'highly unlikely', that is, having strong evidence that contradicts the association or supports a clearly incompatible annotation (see Table 7 for more detail). We consider predictions
labeled 'A' as known correct predictions, and predictions with
either 'A' or 'B' as supported.
Results of the assessment, summarized in Figure 7a, show the
proportion of novel predictions that are known correct in different GO branches. The fractions of top-scoring predictions
that are supported were comparable in each of the three
branches - 63%, 60% and 48% for BP, MF and CC GO terms,
respectively. The fractions of top-scoring predictions that are
known correct were 63%, 35% and 45% for BP, MF and CC
attributes, respectively. We note that the top-scoring novel
BP predictions were confirmed more frequently than MF and
CC predictions (the reverse of performance order observed in
cross-validation assessment).

Literature-based evaluation of novel GO function
predictions

The number of 'known correct' predictions is a conservative
estimate of the actual number of correct predictions, since
supporting evidence may not be available in the literature.
Therefore, the number of predictions that are actually correct
is estimated to be between the number of predictions labeled
'A' and the number labeled either 'A', 'B', or 'C'. Thus, our estimates for the true rates of success among top novel predictions were 63%, 35% to 65%, and 45% to 50% for BP, MF and
CC GO terms, respectively.

In calculating precision and recall by cross-validation, only
predictions corresponding to currently known GO annotations were counted as 'true'. This is conservative in that our
current knowledge of gene function in S. cerevisiae is far from
complete, and some predictions considered to be 'false' may
actually be true. A high-scoring prediction that is 'false' is
most appropriately viewed as a novel prediction. Indeed,

We also examined the success rate of novel predictions as a
function of the specificity of the GO terms predicted (Figure
7b). The success rates were 33% to 43% and 20% to 27% for
GO terms with specificity 11 to 30 and 3 to 10, respectively. As
one might expect, Funckenstein's precision for novel predictions rose substantially for more general GO terms: 73% to

We show in Figure 5 the impact of different evidence types on
prediction performance of the guilt-by-profiling classifier. In
Figure 6, we show an example decision tree of the guilt-byassociation classifier. Detailed discussion of these two figures

Discussion

Top novel predictions and their evaluations are listed in Additional data file 1. Only 2 out of these 120 predictions were
made for 'uncharacterized' genes, and none were made for
dubious genes. Among these 120 predictions, 103 are refinements of original annotations, that is, the target gene has
already been annotated with an ancestor GO term of the predicted GO. For example, the correct novel prediction of 'DNA
bending activity' (GO:0008301) for ARG80 was a refinement,
in that ARG80 was previously annotated with 'DNA binding'
(GO:0003677), the direct parent term of 'DNA bending activity'. The remaining 17 predictions in Additional data file 1
have no annotated ancestor GO terms assigned to the target
gene except the root GO term, and are, therefore, particularly
interesting novel predictions. For example, BPT1 was correctly predicted to have 'ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances' (GO:0042626), and had
not previously been annotated with any ancestor of this GO
term. Interestingly, out of these 17 particularly interesting
novel predictions, 13 were ranked by a SGD expert as 'known
true' or 'likely to be true'.

The Funckenstein method yielded substantial improvement
over MRF-NB, a previous method combining guilt-by-profiling with guilt-by-association. Indeed, Funckenstein achieved
a higher prediction precision across all ranges of recall when
applied to the same benchmark data (Figure 1b).

A resource for browsing predictions and underlying
evidence
So that researchers may browse predictions and gain intuition about the evidence underlying specific predictions, we
developed an online resource allowing browsing by GO term
or gene. This is publicly available at [33].

Validation of a method combining guilt-by-profiling
and guilt-by-association

Here we generated a more up-to-date collection of integrated
data, and applied Funckenstein to predict more specific functional terms from the GO vocabulary. The precision versus
recall performance of these predictions was assessed by
cross-validation and (for top novel predictions) by a followup analysis of the literature.
The results suggest that these predictions could be very useful
in guiding experimentalists to promising candidate genes.
Even the most challenging GO category, highly specific BP
terms, yielded a precision of 14% at 50% recall in cross-validation assessment. Importantly, even predictions with 14%
(or lower) precision can be extremely useful. To put 14% precision into perspective, if predictions were made at random
for a GO term with approximately 6 genes left to be identified,
we would expect a precision at 50% recall of approximately
0.1%. Thus, predictions with 14% precision at 50% recall represent a 140-fold increase in the 'hit rate' compared with random testing (which is the rate that would be achieved by an
experimentalist using the 'brute force' approach of testing all
genes).
In Funckenstein, both guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association classifiers were based on a decision tree model. Decisiontree based classifiers offer some advantages over other

machine learning algorithms. For example, unlike NB [34],
decision trees do not assume conditional independence
between different data types. Decision trees can also provide
intuition for the reasoning behind predictions more readily
than support vector machine approaches [35]. In addition,

decision trees have good scaling properties in terms of running time and memory usage, which is an important issue
when considering thousands of gene characteristics for thousands of genes, and multiple biological relationships among
millions of gene pairs.

Cross-validation results for Funckenstein and the RF guilt-by-profiling component classifier (RF) alone (brown)

Cross-validation results for Funckenstein and the RF guilt-by-profiling component classifier (RF) alone (brown). Three versions of Funckenstein were
compared, each integrating RF with one of three variants of the FL guilt-by-association classifier (FL): FL1, FL using only relationships derived from shared
gene characteristics (green); FL2, FL using only direct gene-gene relationships (red); and FL3, FL using all types of relationship (blue). (a-l) Plots are

Much of the success of Funckenstein can be attributed to the
RF classifier in the guilt-by-profiling classification. The RF
classifier is an ensemble of decision trees [27], which has
proven to be superior to regular decision trees in many cases,
for example, in predicting protein interactions [36]. As we

can see from Figure 1, if we had used the simpler PDT rather
than the RF classifier, we would not have gained much
improvement over MRF-NB. The fact that the guilt-by-association classifier was based on a PDT suggests that further
improvements could be obtained using the RF method to

of interactions and inclusion of additional relationship types
in the GO term prediction effort, and to the fact that the GO
terms were generally more specific. When the benchmark
data set for MRF-NB was established, the total number of
relationships, including gene expression correlation and comembership within a protein complex, was only 9,976. By
contrast, our GO predictions used 55,039 interactions
reported by BioGRID [37]. The number of relationship types
also increases from 4 when predicting MIPS functions to 23
when predicting GO terms.
We also found that the relative contribution of guilt-by-association in GO term predictions increases as GO terms become
more specific. This coincides with the decreased performance
of the guilt-by-profiling RF classifier for more specific GO
terms, for which fewer positive training examples (that is,
genes previously annotated with the GO term) are available.
By contrast, guilt-by-association has the potential to be successful given only a single positive training example gene with
a given GO term, since the 'transfer rules' are learned from the
many GO terms within each GO category.

obtain the functional linkage graph used in guilt-by-association.
The guilt-by-association classifier was important to Funckenstein's success, especially in predicting BP and CC attributes.
While performance of the guilt-by-association component
classifier can be improved by transforming gene characteristics into gene-gene relationships, this does not necessarily
lead to better performance in the follow-up integration by
Funckenstein. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3, Funckenstein
with the FL classifier that used only experimentally determined gene-gene relationships achieved better performance
than Funckenstein using the version of FL that performed
best by itself. Thus, to achieve the best overall performance, it
may be important to integrate component classifiers using
complementary input features rather than using the input
features that optimize performance of each component classifier alone.

The use of a FL graph significantly improves the
performance of guilt-by-association in predicting
specific GO functions
In our benchmark study predicting MIPS functions, the guiltby-profiling classifier played a more dominant role than guiltby-association. In predicting GO terms, however, the contribution of guilt-by-association was more substantial. This
improvement can be attributed both to the increased number

The guilt-by-association classifier performs well for both CC
and BP GO terms, and even outperforms the RF classifiers in
some of the CC and BP subcategories; however, its performance is much poorer in the MF categories than that of the RF
classifier. This may be explained by the fact that CC and BP
GO terms more often have corresponding relationships with
other genes in the genome, while the MF GO terms focus on
describing the catalytic activity or structural role of an individual protein.

Assessing the value of different evidence types in
predicting function
The RF classifier is not only useful in prediction, but can also
be used to assess the value of particular variables in inferring
a given function [27] (see Materials and methods). By ranking
gene characteristics according to their importance score, we
gain intuition about the gene characteristics that were most
useful for inferring a particular function.
For each GO term, we identified the five variables that were
most useful in the corresponding RF classifier (see Materials
and methods for details). Within each of the 12 GO categories,
we then calculated the frequency with which each gene characteristic type was observed among the set of most useful variables (Figure 5). For GO terms assigned to 31 or more genes,
we find the protein subcellular localization study by Huh and
coworkers [21] and a phenotyping study by Lum and colleagues [19] to be the most useful sources of gene characteristics. In addition, the Huh et al. study was the most useful type
of gene characteristic in predicting CC GO terms, while the
Lum et al. study was the most useful gene characteristic type
in prediction of BP and MF GO terms. It is intuitively reasonable that the Huh et al. study of subcellular localization
should be useful in predicting CC GO terms, since CC GO

It is easy to rationalize the value of the Lum et al. phenotyping
study in predicting BP GO terms, since genes within the same

biological pathway or process are known to often exhibit similar phenotypes. However, it was surprising to find that a phenotyping study was dominant in predicting general molecular
functions. Phenotypes in Lum et al. often correspond to the

tion with other terms, even if the Lum phenotypes alone are
not sufficient to predict the target GO term accurately.
Some gene characteristics may also be negative predictors of
molecular function. For example, 124 S. cerevisiae genes are
annotated with 'RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity' (GO:0003702). Among 1,453 genes with the gene characteristic 'Huh:nucleus', 106 are annotated with the target GO
term; by contrast, among the remaining genes without this
characteristic, only 18 are annotated with the target GO term,
so that not having 'Huh:nucleus' is particularly valuable as a
'negative predictor' of GO:0003702.
For predicting specific GO terms assigned to 30 or fewer
genes, we find no gene characteristic type dominates in terms
of variable importance; almost all gene characteristic types
are represented among the most useful variables of at least
one GO category. Yet there is a tendency for protein sequence
patterns to become more useful as GO terms become more
specific, within each of the three GO branches. For example,
the MF term 'aldehyde reductase activity' (GO:0004032) is
annotated to only four S. cerevisiae genes, each sharing a
Prosite sequence motif 'PS00063' that is unique to these four
genes, making it the best predictor of this function. In another
example, the BF term 'negative regulation of microtubule
polymerization or depolymerization' (GO:0031111) is
assigned to eight genes, six with a conserved DH domain
(Interpro 'IPR000219') involved in Rho GTPase interaction

and activation that has been assigned to only seven S. cerevisiae genes. A third example is the CC term 'proteasome core
complex, alpha-subunit complex (sensu Eukaryota)'
(GO:0019773) that has been assigned to seven S. cerevisiae
genes. Each shares a protease alpha unit domain, Interpro
'IPR000426', that has been assigned only to these same seven
S. cerevisiae genes. Although protein sequence information is
valuable in all GO branches and is increasingly useful for
more specific GO terms, it is far from dominant in terms of
variable importance. Thus, it is necessary to integrate multiple sources of experimental evidence.
The prediction importance of gene characteristics within the
same class (each indicated by color in Figure 5) can be very
different. For example, data from Lum et al., Huh et al., Roberts et al., and Interpro are, respectively, the best characteristic types within each of the five characteristic classes. Within
the same characteristic class, we can assess value of variables
in predicting gene function as one surrogate measure of the
corresponding quality of each experiment. It must be noted
that this analysis does not reveal the reasons for improved
value in predicting function, which may result from differences in sensitivity, specificity or coverage of the corresponding experiments. Furthermore, a data set that is least useful
for predicting function may be ideal for other purposes. With
these caveats, we note one example from the comparison of
characteristic types: among protein subcellular localization
studies, gene characteristics derived from the study by Huh

and coworkers study were substantially more useful than
those of Kumar and colleagues [38] in all 12 GO categories
(Figure 5).
It is less clear how one should establish the importance of particular variables in generating the FL graph used in guilt-byassociation. However, we can still obtain some intuition by
examining the PDT classifier used to generate the FL graph.
For example, in the PDT classifier developed for the most specific BP GO category, we can see (Figure 6) that a protein pair
with 'Affinity capture-MS', 'Affinity capture-western', and
'two-hybrid' evidence is more likely to share a specific BP
function than another pair with 'Affinity capture-MS' and
only one of 'Affinity capture-western' or 'two-hybrid' evidence. The corresponding number of functionally linked ('+')
and non-functionally linked ('-') gene pairs within the training set were (138+, 580-) for pairs with all three supporting
evidence types. The decision tree structure is slightly different
in different GO categories, with more general GO categories
having more complex structures. However, the 'Affinity capture-MS' tends to be a top choice within decision trees used to
generate the FL graph.

by-association scores (corresponding to the genes VPH1,
SUI2, SPT7, and TIF5); and predictions with high RF but low
guilt-by-association scores (corresponding to the genes SFH1,
MSH3, TPS2, LSM1, MSH6, and MLH2). Predictions in the
former class all corresponded to CC GO terms. In each of
these four cases, genes were known to encode members of a
protein complex, and membership in a different subunit of
the same complex was predicted (Additional data file 1). For
example, VPH1 was predicted to have function 'hydrogentransporting ATPase V1 domain' (GO:0000221), while
according to SGD it is a 'subunit of vacuolar-ATPase V0
domain' (a different subunit of the same complex). Thus, it is
no surprise that VPH1 was found in multiple high-throughput
experiments to interact with all eight S. cerevisiae genes in
the V1 subunit, leading to a high guilt-by-association score
and a mistaken prediction. This mistake might have been
avoided, given the knowledge that VPH1 is annotated to the
ATPase V0 domain. However, we had avoided using GO
terms to predict other GO terms, to avoid complications arising from strong dependencies between GO terms [23]. This
example suggests, however, that we might gain by using GO
terms that are strongly anti-correlated with the target GO
term as a predictor.

Directions for further improvement
Novel predictions made by Funckenstein were sufficiently
accurate to be useful in guiding experimental research
according to current literature. However, we would like to
understand why some top Funckenstein predictions were
ranked as 'highly unlikely' by the SGD expert. Because highly
specific terms are expected to be most useful to experimentalists, we focused on predictions for the most specific GO categories (assigned to 3 to 10 genes). Among the 30 such novel
predictions of the most specific GO categories, 10 were considered 'highly unlikely' in light of current literature. These
ten fell within each of the GO branches (three, five, and two
predictions corresponding to MF, CC, and BP branches,
respectively; see Additional data file 1). According to the contribution of the RF and guilt-by-association classifier to the
final prediction scores of these ten predictions, we can divide
them into two classes: predictions with low RF but high guilt-

We also examined six top-scoring predictions with high RF
but low guilt-by-association scores. All six can be attributed to
conserved protein domains. For example, SFH1 was predicted to have 'phosphatidylinositol transporter activity'
(GO:0008526), while SGD annotation describes SFH1 as a
'putative homolog of Sec14p, which is a phosphatidylinositol/
phosphatidylcholine transfer protein involved in lipid metabolism'. All five S. cerevisiae genes currently annotated with
'phosphatidylinositol transporter activity' share the Pfam patterns 'PF00650 (CRAL/TRIO domain)' and 'PF03765
(CRAL/TRIO N-term domain)', as well as the Prosite pattern
'PS50191 (CRAL-TRIO lipid binding domain profile)'.
Because SFH1 is the only S. cerevisiae gene other than these
five genes to have these domains and sequence patterns,
Funckenstein assigned the target function with very high confidence. However, a previous study was unable to record any

Conclusion

We have developed a combined algorithm named 'Funckenstein' that combines both gene characteristics and gene-gene
relationships to predict functions. Funckenstein shows substantial improvement over a promising previous method in
predicting MIPS functions of S. cerevisiae genes. We have
therefore applied Funckenstein to systematically predict
2,455 more specific GO terms for S. cerevisiae genes. In
cross-validation Funckenstein achieves high precision within
all three GO branches, even for the most specific GO terms.
Funckenstein has generated a large number of novel predictions that can be readily explored by experimentalists. The
assessment of the top 120 novel predictions by an SGD expert
suggests that the resulting novel predictions have the potential to be extremely useful to experimentalists.

Random forest classifier

Prediction methods
The probabilistic decision tree classifier

Whereas the PDT classifier produces only one tree as a predictive model for a given GO term, a RF classifier is composed
of an ensemble of many decision trees. Each decision tree in
the 'forest' differs from the PDT in that: training genes at the
root node are selected by bootstrap resampling (sampling
with replacement) from the full training set; at every node,
only a fraction of available object characteristics are assessed
as candidates for splitting the next node; and there is no
early-stopping criterion (since the process of averaging over
diverse trees is an intrinsic safeguard against overfitting
[27]). The score for a given candidate gene and GO term is
then the fraction of trees trained on that GO term that classify
that gene as positive. More details on the RF classifier can be
found in [27].

The PDT is a simple and effective tool for modeling the probability of one variable describing an object conditioned on
other known characteristics of that object [40]. The decision
tree is a graph describing the recursive division of a set of
objects into successively smaller partitions. For a detailed
description, see [28,40]. In short, all objects in the training
set are initially assigned to the root node. Objects are recursively split into smaller partitions on the basis of the value of
a particular predictive variable. The predictive variable used
to split objects at each node was chosen based on the Gini
impurity measure [28], a measure of uniformity of objects
with respect to a given variable of interest. To avoid overfitting, we implemented an 'early stopping' criterion to decide
whether the next proposed split provides sufficient information to justify the accompanying increase in model complexity. For the predictive variable offering the largest reduction
in Gini impurity, we compute the corresponding hypergeometric distribution probability:

Because the extremely large number of predictive variables
available in our data set (8.848 for the GO term prediction
study) impacts the memory and time efficiency of the RF
method, we introduced modifications to the RF method. We
performed feature selection to eliminate variables that were
marginally uninformative. For feature selection we examined
the set of unique genes at the root node and computed the
hypergeometric distribution probability P (as defined in the
PDT description above), retaining only those characteristics
with P < α. Because of the bootstrap resampling in selecting
training genes, the selected features may vary between trees.
We also imposed the same early stopping criterion and
method for calculating a probability score at each leaf node
that were described for PDTs above. The final RF score for a
given gene and GO term was then the average of the probability scores at leaf nodes corresponding to that gene across all
trees in the forest trained on that GO term.

Materials and methods

P=

N T !⋅ N F !⋅ N L !⋅ N R !
N !⋅ N TL !⋅ N TR !⋅ N FL !⋅ N FR !

where N is the total number of genes in the parent node, and
NT and NF are the total number of genes in the parent node
annotated with and without the target GO term, respectively,
while NTL and NFL, NTR and NFR are the corresponding numbers at the left and right daughter node given the split, respectively. We reject the split and determine the node to be a 'leaf
node' if the hypergeometric distribution probability P > α
(with α = 0.01 except where otherwise specified). We compute the probability of a given gene i to be annotated with the
target GO term j as:

There are three free parameters of the RF classifier: the
number of random variables at each split, the threshold for
feature selection, and the threshold for early stopping. Optimization of these parameters is described below in the 'Training and cross-validation' section.
We also estimated the importance of each variable in predicting each given GO term. Variable importance was computed
using Gini impurity (also used above in the context of PDTs).
Specifically, importance of a given variable is the sum of the
reduction in Gini impurity over all appearances of that variable over all decision trees in the forest [27].

Guilt-by-association classifier
N T + PT ⋅ Ψ
P (i , j ) =
NT + N F +Ψ

Guilt-by-association was performed using a FL graph, in
which each edge in the graph is assigned a weight related to
the probability that two genes share a common GO term
Genome Biology 2008, 9:S7

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/S1/S7

Genome Biology 2008,

whose specificity (number of genes) is within the specificity
range of a given GO category [29]. The FL graph is then used
to assign scores to particular gene and GO term combinations. We produced a separate FL graph for each of 12 GO categories, corresponding to each combination of three GO
branches (BP, MF, and CC) and four specificity levels (3 to 10,
11 to 30, 31 to 100, and 101 to 300). We used the PDT method
to produce each FL graph. Unlike PDTs predicting specific
GO terms where the objects under study are genes, here the
objects of interest are gene pairs. The variable to be predicted
for each gene pair is the answer to the question 'are these two
proteins functionally linked, that is, do they share any one of
the specific GO terms in a specified GO category?' The
attributes used for this classifier are gene-gene relationships,
such as protein or genetic interactions. To limit over-fitting,
we used the same PDT early-stopping criterion described in
the context of function prediction, with threshold 10-8. Thus,
for each GO category, each pair of S. cerevisiae genes is
assigned a FL 'weight' reflecting the probability that the gene
pair shares a specific GO term in that category. To score the
annotation of a particular candidate gene with a particular
GO term, we retrieve FL weight scores for all pairings of the
candidate gene with genes known to have the GO term and
average the top three FL scores.

Combining guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association scores
Guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association classifier scores
are combined by a simple logistic regression model with one
free parameter. For a given gene i and a target function j, let
the probability score computed by the guilt-by-profiling and
guilt-by-association classifiers be PGBP(i, j) and PGBA(i, j),
respectively, then the corresponding combined score P(i, j) is
defined as:
log(

P
P (i , j )
(i , j )
P
(i , j )
) = w ⋅ log( GBP
) + (1 − w) ⋅ log( GBA
)
1 − P (i , j )
1 − PGBP (i , j )
1− PGBA (i , j )

where w is optimized over the range from 0 to 1 based on area
under the precision versus recall curve obtained in cross-validation.

Training and cross-validation
For both PDT and RF classifiers, we performed ten-fold
cross-validation to obtain a probability score for each gene
and used these scores to assess performance. For the RF classifier, we obtained an 'out-of-bag' score for every gene. Each
tree in the forest uses only approximately 66% of genes in
training. Therefore, for each gene we identified the approximately 33% of trees that did not use that gene in training and
averaged the scores for that gene to obtain its 'out-of-bag'
score.
We optimized the free parameters of the RF classifier according to the performance of 'out-of-bag' scores. To evaluate performance of a set of scores, we obtain at multiple score
thresholds the number of true positive (TP), false positive

Volume 9, Suppl 1, Article S7

Tian et al. S7.18

(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) genes at the
given threshold. TP (FP) is defined as the number of proteins
with a score greater than the threshold, which are (are not)
currently annotated with target function. FN (TN) is defined
as the number of proteins with a score below the threshold
that are (are not) currently annotated with the target function. Thus, we can compute 'precision':

P precision =

TP
TP + FP

'recall' or 'true positive rate':

Precall = Ptrue =

TP
TP + FN

and 'false positive rate':

P false =

FP
FP + TN

Thus, to assess the performance of a given set of scores, we
can plot Pprecision versus Precall, or Ptrue versus Pfalse (the latter
is often called a ROC curve). Although the ROC curve is
widely used in evaluating the performance of a classifier, it is
not the best measure for this application. Because annotations are sparse, only very low false positive rates correspond
to predictions with a level of precision that is likely to be useful. Therefore, we used the area under the precision-recall
curve to optimize the three free parameters of the RF classifier and the single free parameter of the logistic regression
procedure used to combine guilt-by-profiling and guilt-byassociation scores. We also used the precision-recall curve to
compute the 'projected precision' corresponding to a given
prediction score. First, we computed its corresponding recall.
Then, we identified the maximal precision at or greater than
the recall in the precision-recall curve, and used that precision as the 'projected precision' corresponding to a given prediction score.

Predictions of MIPS functions using a previously
defined benchmark data set
Data sources
For comparison with the earlier MRF-NB method, we used
the benchmark data set to which it was previously applied.
This used the MIPS catalog of functional categories ('FunCat')
[41]. Although this catalog currently includes 28 top-level
functional categories that describe general functions, we used
the 13 functional classes derived previously from MIPS [26]
(see Table 1 for detailed description). We also predicted only
for the 3,588 S. cerevisiae genes annotated with at least one
of the 13 function classes, as was done previously. We used
the same information used in training the MRF-NB model,
including Pfam domain and tandem affinity purification
(TAP) complexes [5], protein and genetic interactions derived
from MIPS, and gene expression correlation. We downloaded

this information from the website corresponding to the previous MRF-NB publication without any post-processing [42].
We trained PDT and RF guilt-by-profiling classifiers using
gene characteristics, that is, protein domain and complex
information. The FL graph for the guilt-by-association classifier was trained using protein and genetic interactions from
MIPS, gene expression correlation, and TAP complex interaction based on the 'spoke' model [32].

GO function prediction
Sources of data
We downloaded associations of GO terms with S. cerevisiae
genes from SGD [43] in December 2006. We also downloaded the GO directed acyclic graph structure from the GO
database (November 30, 2006 release) and used it to 'propagate' associations so association to a particular GO term was
propagated to all ancestral GO terms. We identified 2,530 GO
terms that are associated with at least three S. cerevisiae
genes according to the propagated annotation. We defined a
measure of functional specificity for each GO term by counting the number of genes currently associated with that GO
term. Then, following the same strategy that was used in a
recent critical assessment of Mus musculus gene functions
(unpublished data), we divided these GO terms into 12 subcategories according to GO branches and GO specificities (3
to 10, 11 to 30, 31 to 100, and 101 to 300 genes). The total
number of GO terms in these 12 categories was 2,455. The
parameters of the RF classifier and Funckenstein were
trained independently for each of the 12 GO subsets.
For guilt-by-profiling predictions, we collected a large
number of gene attributes derived both from sequence analysis and high-throughput experimental data (see Table 3 for
details). For guilt-by-association predictions, we downloaded
experimentally determined interaction types from the BioGRID database [37]. This database defines 23 protein and
genetic interaction types, for example, yeast two-hybrid protein interaction and synthetic lethal genetic interaction (see
Table 4 for details), corresponding to a total of 55,039 unique
gene pairs with some relationship. We also computed shared
annotation relationships for all gene characteristics in Table
3. Within a given class of gene characteristics, a gene pair was
considered to have shared annotation if the number of shared
characteristics was more than 90% of the number of unique
characteristics held by either protein.
