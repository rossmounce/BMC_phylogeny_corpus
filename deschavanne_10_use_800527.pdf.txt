The use of genomic signature distance between
bacteriophages and their hosts displays
evolutionary relationships and phage growth
cycle determination
Patrick Deschavanne1*, Michael S DuBow2, Christophe Regeard2

Abstract
Background: Bacteriophage classification is mainly based on morphological traits and genome characteristics
combined with host information and in some cases on phage growth lifestyle. A lack of molecular tools can
impede more precise studies on phylogenetic relationships or even a taxonomic classification. The use of methods
to analyze genome sequences without the requirement for homology has allowed advances in classification.
Results: Here, we proposed to use genome sequence signature to characterize bacteriophages and to compare
them to their host genome signature in order to obtain host-phage relationships and information on their lifestyle.
We analyze the host-phage relationships in the four most representative groups of Caudoviridae, the dsDNA group
of phages. We demonstrate that the use of phage genomic signature and its comparison with that of the host
allows a grouping of phages and is also able to predict the host-phage relationships (lytic vs. temperate).
Conclusions: We can thus condense, in relatively simple figures, this phage information dispersed over many
publications.

Background
Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities
on Earth and their total population is estimated at
approximately 1031 particles on earth [1]. In comparison
with the estimated 1030 bacterial cells in the biosphere
[2], there are thus 10 virus particles for each putative
host [3,4]. In aquatic or terrestrial samples, 106 to 107
viral particles per milliliter of water or gram of soil are
regularly reported. Moreover, these viruses are highly
dynamic, leading to approximately 1023 infections per
second [5]. The study of phage diversity is crucial for
understanding an ecosystem. For instance, the concept
of “killing the winner” has been proposed to explain
how phage propagation can control host diversity and
abundance [6].
Bacteriophages also participate in the evolution of
their bacterial hosts. Horizontal transfer of genes from

phage to host and vice versa has been well documented
[7,8]. Temperate bacteriophages have the capacity to
integrate their DNA into that of the host and can also
lead to lysogenic conversion in pathogenic bacteria such
as Vibrio cholerae [9]. Prophages have been shown to
contribute to genome diversification [10] and in some
environments, the majority of bacteria contains at least
one prophage [4,11]. Lawrence et al, (2002) [12] calculated an average of 2.6 prophages per free living bacterial cell, some genomes can contain up to 10% of
prophage DNA [13].
Since the sequencing of the first complete genome of
bacteriophage F × 174 in 1977 [14], several characteristics have been established concerning phage genomes.
The size of completely sequenced genomes varies
between 2435 bp (Leuconostoc phage L5) and 497 513
bp (Bacillus phage G). However the size distribution of
phage genomes is not homogenous, possibly because of
a bias linked to isolation techniques [15]. Phages genomes ranging in size from 30 to 60 kb, the majority
belonging to the Siphoviridae, have been the most

sequenced (approximately 55% of the total), and small
phage genomes (5 to 20 kb) are the second most abundant size range (approximately 27% of the total). An
intriguing gap is observed between 80 and 100 kb, with
very few complete genome sequences available followed
by large genome sequences. The distribution of morphotypes corresponding to the genomes available in the
Genbank phage database reflects what has been
observed by electron microscopy [16], with a predominance of tailed phages containing double strand genomic DNA. The extraordinary diversity of phages in
nature, the dynamism of phage populations and the lack
of homology among most phage genes is a recurrent
theme. However it is also common to observe an
absence of homology among phage genes belonging to
phages infecting the same host and therefore likely closely related. As the number of available sequenced
phage genomes increases, their mosaic structure is
becoming more evident [17-19]. Phage genome mutation rates, combined with recombination leading to
genetic mosaicism as well as the lack of an universal
gene, analogous to the 16 S rRNA gene, explain why
phage classification is based on the nature of the phage
nucleic-acid and virion morphology. Family-specific
genes such as viral capsid structural genes have been
used as taxonomic tools [20]. However, these methods
are limited and do not reveal other phage characteristics
such as virus-host relationships. Homology-free methods
based on the usage of oligonucleotides (sequence signatures) are potentially interesting to try in phage classification. Numerous studies have shown the utility of
genomic signatures for different purposes. Dinucleotide
frequencies have been used to compare genomic signatures of prokaryotic genomes [21-25] or phage genomes
[26]. Methods based on longer oligonucleotides were
further developed for the characterization and classification of bacterial species [27]. Local variations of the
genomic signature along the sequence of a genome
allow the detection of horizontal transfers and pathogenicity islands [28-33] or prophages remnants [34].
More recently genomic signatures were used in an
approach to classify virus genomes, and it was observed
that, in general, viral genome signatures are close to
that of their hosts [35]. Another use of genome
sequence signatures, applied to viruses, was to assign
environmental genomic fragments either to a known
species or to regroup them in new ones [36].
Recent phages metagenomic studies [11,37,38] have
reinforced the view that phage genome diversity is
extraordinarily high, that phages with dsDNA are predominant in the environment, and that they constitute an
enormous “source” of uncharacterized genes. One of the
principal questions that remains to be answered is the
nature of phage-host relationships in the context of

Page 2 of 12

genomic and metagenomic data, such as the phage life
cycle (lytic or temperate), morphotype or host range.
In this report, we have used the genomic signatures of
phages and their hosts to aid in the understanding of
these relationships. Host signatures from four bacterial
species infected by a large number of phages has been
compared with phage signature. We calculated a “distance” between each phage and its host. We demonstrate that this distance can be used to group the phages
and gives indications of the phages growth cycle.

Results and discussions
Choice of the phage genomes used in this study

As of January 2009, there were 521 bacterial and
archaeal virus genomes available in the Genbank phage
database. Among these genomes, 459 are composed of
dsDNA and are mainly distributed among the Orders of
the Caudoviridae. The 62 remaining genomes contain
ssDNA or RNA and correspond to Microviridae, Leviviridae and Inoviridae members.
We examined the 459 dsDNA phage genomes of the
database and, where possible we grouped the different
phage genomes by host and collected data concerning
their morphotype, whether temperate or lytic, and the
genome length.
The Caudoviridae corresponded to 84% of available
genomes, composed of 57% Siphoviridae, 23% Myoviridae and 20% Podoviridae families (Figure 1A). This distribution is nearly the same as that published in 2007
concerning the phages examined in the electron microscope [16], although 9% of the available genomes have
not been characterized or completely annotated.
Approximately one third of the genomes contain an indication of the capacity to lysogenize their hosts. Only 21%
have been described as exclusively lytic, whereas for 43%
of the phages this information is not mentioned (Figure
1B). The majority (60%) of the genomes available in the
database infect only 13 species, with a clear dominance
of phages infecting Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia
coli (Figure 1C). We thus examined the Caudoviridae
members infecting these four bacterial species.
Escherichia coli Caudoviridae

Forty-six genomes of the order Caudoviridae infecting
E. coli can be gathered in Genbank phage database. The
genomic signature of each phage was generated, as
detailed in Methods, compared with the genomic signature of E. coli W3110, and the distance between phages
and host was calculated. Other E. coli strains were
tested but the distances were not significantly different
(data not shown). The genomic signature distances,
morphotypes, genome lengths and life styles are shown
in Figure 2.

sequenced genome of phages infecting the same host. Only host with at least 5 different phages are shown. ND: Not indicated in the database.

E. coli phage groups

A first feature that is revealed by an analysis of Figure 2
is the coherent grouping of phages. This grouping is in
agreement with a 6 groups K-means classification based
on phage signatures. The number of groups is greater
than those described in Figure 2 to take into account
the isolated phages. The groups based on signature distance correspond to the different known and identified
groups of coliphages. For example, all the phages
belonging to the lytic T7 super-group (group III) have a
relatively homogenous distance signature. For temperate
phages, two groups can be observed. The first group
(group I), containing the lambda-like phages, is characterized by a short distance signature, perhaps reflecting
a more ancient prophage life style. The second lambdoid
group (II) is very homogenous and contains phages
characterized by their ability to carry shiga toxin-like
encoding genes. Our representation appears to be compatible with the “classification scheme” suggested by

Casjens [39]. The last group (IV) corresponds to the T4
super-group that contains phages with genomes ranging
from 164 to 180 kb in length. These genomes have the
peculiarity of having a low GC%, necessitating the normalization of genomic signature of the host and phages
(see Methods). In spite of the fact that genomes are larger and then likely least host dependent, the overall
observed distance is less than that of the T7 supergroup. In the E. coli phage landscape, several phages
remain isolated. Phage FEcoM-Gj1 has been recently
described and its genome reveals a unique pattern of
different origins. It is the first phage with a Myoviridae
morphotype but with a T7-like RNA polymerase and a
large subunit terminase related to that of phage T1 [40].
Phage EPS7 has been isolated and its genome recently
analyzed [41]. This phage belongs to the T5 family and
its close genomic signature distance is not surprising.
The addition to this group of the phage rv5 is tempting,
although rv5 is a Myoviridae. Moreover, the proximity

listed in the Table.

of the T4 super group and the putative T5 group is
coherent. Analysis of the T5 sequence by Wang et al
(2005) [42] revealed that in the “top 10” homologous
phages and genes, RB49, RB69 and T4 are first on the
list. Like FEcoM-Gj1, phage FEco32 has been described
as a genome with a large degree of mosaicism [43]. The
genomic signature distance of phage N4 seems to allow
it to be grouped with FEco32, but no genetic relationship can be retrieved from the literature. Finally, phages
Mu and P2 show very close distances, whereas Mu is
able to integrate as a prophage by a transposition
mechanism, while P2 has a site-specific mechanism of
genome integration. It is noticeable that significant
homology between phage Mu and P2 have been
observed for the tail fiber encoding genes [44]. Phage
P4, the satellite phage of P2, is a defective phage that
exists as a plasmid, shows a more divergent distance signature. Figure 2 confirms that there is no correlation
between morphotypes and groups or subtype of phages,
although several groups appear to be more homogenous
than others. For example, the temperate phage group
represented by phage 933W (II) appears more

susceptible to exchange modules encoding tail fibers.
There is also no significant correlation between genome
length and the distance between the host and phage signature. However, our representation, using a combination of the distance signatures, genome length and
phage characteristics (life style and morphotype), allows
us, independently of sequences comparison, to obtain a
coherent picture of the “relationship landscape” of the
bacteriophages of E. coli.
E. coli phage life styles

The second striking observation is the apparent separation between temperate and lytic phages. All the temperate phages are characterized by a host-phage distance
≤0.2. The genomic signature distance seems therefore
be sufficiently robust, without any direct sequence comparison, to distinguish these two different life styles. The
short genomic distance for temperate bacteriophages is
likely due to the long timescale of the “prophage” state.
This hypothesis was first suggested by Lawrence and
Ochman (1997) [45] to explain that horizontally
acquired genes will, over time, adopt the molecular
characteristics of the host genome, and has been

Deschavanne et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:163
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/163

recently confirmed in a study comparing the sequenced
genomes of different strains of the same species [46].
Thus, for temperate phages, the more time a genome
remains in a prophage state the smaller should be the
genomic signature distance. The difference between
temperate and lytic phages of E. coli is intriguing
because it should not be difficult for a temperate phage
to lose its ability to lysogenize its host [39]. The high
rate of horizontal transfers in phage genomes is also an
argument for the possible acquisition of a functional
module involved in lysogeny. The use of genomic signature distances may allow the detection of a temperate
phage that has recently lost its lysogenic capacity. In
E. coli, such examples have not yet been identified,
whereas several examples in other species have been
reported [47,48]. A lytic phage for which the distance
resembles temperate distances is represented by phage
T1. In the genome of T1, a homolog of the phage N15
cor gene, involved in lysogenic conversion, can be
found. When phylogenetic trees are constructed, several
lines of descent, including temperate phages such as
N15, HK022 and HK97 have been suggested [49]. The
largest temperate phage genome P1 shares with N15 the
shortest distance. However, the only thing in common

Page 5 of 12

between these two phages is a plasmid prophage form,
suggesting that the homogenization process between
phage and host genomic signatures may be more efficient for plasmids.
Staphylococcus aureus Caudoviridae

Fifty phages of the order Caudoviridae with completely
sequenced genomes and infecting Staphylococcus aureus
were analyzed using the same procedures as described
for the E. coli bacteriophages.
S. aureus phage groups

Only 8 phages outside of the 39-47 kb genome length
range and an average of distances of 0.12 were observed
(Figure 3). S. aureus strains are often involved in pathogenesis, and represent an important cause of nosocomial
infections. Thus, temperate phages with the capacity of
lysogenic conversion, such as those containing PantonValentine Leukocidin toxins [50-53] are frequently
examined. The genomic comparison of 27 phages
reported by Kwan et al (2005) [19], based on genome
size, nucleotide sequence and proteome comparisons,
leads to the description of three separate groups. These
3 groups are retrieved by a K-means classification based
on phage signatures and are also clearly evidenced using

phages listed in the Table.

genomic distances signatures. Group II is composed of
lytic Podoviridae with genome sizes inferior to 20 Kb
and genomic signature distances around 0.15. Phages
44AHJD and P68 have been classified as F29-like by the
ICTV, and the presence of a terminal protein at the
genome extremities has been confirmed [54]. Phage
PT1028 could be assigned to the same group because of
its genome size, but no significant homologies can be
observed with phages 44AHJD, P68 and 66 [19]. Our
results allows us to add phage SAP-2 to group I. Phages
K, Twort and G1 (group III) have genomes of approximately 130 Kb, belong to the Myoviridae family, are
lytic phages, and have a clearly different signature distance (≅ 0.3) in comparison with the other S. aureus
phages. The remaining 42 phages were classified in the
same group (group I) and contain all the phages of class
II, as defined by Kwan et al, 2005 [19]. The highest distance value is observed for phage X2 (0.13) and the
smallest value was observed for phage PVL (0.09).
S. aureus phage life styles

When information concerning morphotype and life style
is available, group I phages belong to the Siphoviridae
family and are temperate. It is interesting to note that,

Page 6 of 12

as for E. coli phages, the temperate phage genomes of
S. aureus display a tendency to have undergone an amelioration process. The phages that show the smallest distances, PVL, PVL108 and phiPV83 have mutations or
insertions that prevent their induction by Mitomycin C
[50,51,55]. Phages SLT and 2958PVL possess significant
homologies and genome organization with the three
“inactive” phages cited above, but their genomic signatures have less resemblance to the host signature.
Mycobacterium smegmatis Caudoviridae

Sixty completely sequenced genomes of bacteriophages
infecting M. smegmatis are available in the Genbank
phage database. The overall landscape of the Mycobacteriophages obtained with the genomic signature distance
(Figure 4) represents the high degree of genetic diversity
described using sequence homologies and genome organization methods [18,56]. The distances vary between
0.008 (Che9c) and 0.29 (Predator), with an average (0.22)
comparable to that observed in E. coli phages.
M. smegmatis phage groups

Six clusters have been described on the basis of nucleotide similarity [18]. A k-means classification is difficult to

perform due to the proximity of small groups of phage
(as seen in Figure 4 and 5) that impedes a proper classification. By extrapolation, we have encircled the different
clusters, taking as a limit the smallest and the longest
genomes. Many phages not yet studied by genome
sequence comparison can be added to the different
groups. Others, like Omega, Gilles, Predator, Konstantine
etc, seem to be more isolated. Group VI, composed only
of Myoviridae, is the easiest to discern, whereas to the
other group a zoom of the picture is necessary (Figure 5).
As observed in E. coli and S. aureus phages, phage genomes that display significant similarities tend to have
similar genomic distance signatures and similar genome
size range. For example, cluster V contains phages with
significant sequences similarity. However two subgroups
are also possible to construct on the basis of genomic signature distances: subgroup A phages number 35, 36, 44
and 46; subgroup B phages number 37, 38, 39, 41, 42 (see
table in Figure 4). Indeed, phages of subgroup B show a
genomic signature that more closely resembles that of
the host. Group II is a very homogenous group for both
the genomic signature distance as well as for genome
length. Phage Fruitloop appears outside of cluster III but
shares a comparable genomic distance signature. The
same observation is likely valid for the phages TM4 and
Pukovnik that probably belong to group I. In contrast to
E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa phages, no genomes
of Podoviridae infecting M. smegmatis have been
sequenced, probably because this morphotype (short tail)
is not adapted to the complex cell wall of this bacterium

Page 7 of 12

[18]. It is clear that, like all other clustering attempts, our
representation is unlikely to completely reflect reality,
and as more phages genomes infecting the same host
become known, better clustering will likely occur.
M. smegmatis phage life styles

Contrary to E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa phages,
the distinction between lytic and temperate life style
seems less easy to establish for the different mycobacteriophages. As explained in [57],“most of the phages form
plaques with hazy appearance, not obviously either clear
or turbid”. However stable lysogens can be isolated from
these hazy plaques. D29 is a lytic phage very similar to
temperate phage L5 [48]. Its status as a lytic phage is
due to a 3,6 Kb deletion that removes the repressor.
Bxb1 is a temperate phage that forms turbid plaques
with a halo, probably due to an enzymatic activity
associate with tail particles [58]. TM4 is not considered
a temperate phage, thought it was isolated after Mitomicyn C treatment, because no integrase or repressor
homolog are present in its genome [59]. Giles and Tweety forms lightly turbid plaques, reflecting a low frequency of lysogeny, but can be considered as temperate
because they possess integrases [60,61]. The picture of
the genomic distance signatures shows that nearly all
the phage genomes are distributed around the average
distance. It is interesting to note that Brujita, Che9c and
Corndog are more close to their host. Therefore, here
we can’t propose a “frontier” between lytic and temperate mycobacteriophages. Several hypothesis could
explained this fact: (1) all the mycobacteriophages isolated until now are temperate (or are derivatives of temperate like D29); (2) the determination of life style on
the basis of plaques morphologies (or the laboratory
conditions) is not adapted to the mycobacteriophages;
(3) finally we can imagine that these mycobacteriophages have only recently been able to infect Mycobacterium smegmatis, or have a different life style as
chronic infection, and therefore the amelioration process
can’t be yet detected by the genomic signature distances.

genomes between 40 and 80 kb. Red symbol: Myoviridae, green

not indicated. The numbers refer to the Table in Figure 4.

Thirty-three completely sequenced genomes of phages
belonging to the order Caudoviridae and infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa are available in the Genbank phage
database. It should be noted that, a significant number
of these phages have a %GC significantly lower than
that of the host (65%). As seen in Figure 6, although
several phages genomes with a GC% that resembles that
of the host (e.g. MP22, D3112, B3) show short distances,
some others (e.g. YuA, M6) have a similar %GC and a
greater distance. In addition, phiKZ, (like T4) has a very
low GC% (33%), but the calculated distance is less than
that of phage 73 that has a 20% greater GC%. Different
hypotheses have been proposed to explain this

phenomenon such as the fact that recent horizontal
gene transfers in phages infecting hosts with a lower %
GC may allow these phages to interact. It is also possible that this large range of %GC is a characteristic of
these phages [62]. However, this variation in %GC may
also reflect the known high phylogenetic versatility of
the Pseudomonas genus [63].
P. aeruginosa phage groups

As observed for the phages infecting the three other
hosts used in this study, it was possible to group the
phages as a function of the distance and the genome
length (Figure 6). An 8 groups K-means classification is
in agreement with this classification. The higher number
of groups is due to the isolated phages. Group I is composed of “Mu-like” genomes, but are all Siphoviridae,
with the exception of phiCTX. Phage MP22 for example, has been recently sequenced [64] and is highly similar to D3112 except in the gene c and in the late genes
of virion morphogenesis. DMS3 has been described has
having a high degree of similarity with phage D3112. B3
belongs to the same group of transposable phages and
displayed some genetic relationships with D3112 using
DNA hybridization [65] and sequence comparisons [62].
MP29, MP38 and F10 are encircled in the same group,
whereas F10 presents no significant sequence similarities

with B3 and D3112 [62]. The second group is composed
of T7 super-group phages, such as phiKMV and LKD16.
The unpublished genomes of phages PT5, PT2 and
Luz19 are present in the same group. Phages LKD16
and phiKMV present 83% DNA homology with significant differences localized in their early regions [66]. In
contrast, LKA1 only show homology at the protein level
(48% of the predicted proteins) with phiKMV. Phages
119X, LUZ19 and PaP2 have genomes with very similar
length, but only 119x and PaP2 show very similar distances, and the presence of group III is supported by
the positive nucleotide comparison between these two
phages [62]. Phages LUZ24 and PaP3 are Podoviridae
that share 71% nucleotide identities, are grouped, and
also share the same genomic signature distance. 24% of
the PAJU2 genome is similar to that of phage D3 and
46% of the PAJU2 predicted proteins show similarity
with D3 proteins [67], but the nearly 10 kb genome
length difference appears to separate them. The last
group reported in the literature is the one containing
phages M6 and YuA (group V). These two phages share
91% nucleotide identities [68] and have very similar
genomic signature distances. Phages LBL3, PB1, F8, 141, SN and LMA2 probably constitute another coherent
group (group VI). They all show a very homogenous

Deschavanne et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:163
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/163

genomic signature distance, the same morphotype and a
genome length of 64-66 KB. A Dot-plot genome comparison shows significant nucleotide similarities between
these genomes (data not shown).
P. aeruginosa phage life styles

The overall landscape of phages infecting P. aeruginosa
seems less easy to differentiate between lytic and temperate. Indeed the distance observed for the phiKMV
group, although higher than the distance observed for
the D3112 temperate group, is less different than what
is observed for the T7 group of E. coli. However, in
contrast with the M. smegmatis phages, it seems possible to propose a demarcation point separating the lytic
and temperate phages, although several atypical cases
remain. PaP3, for example, has been described as a
temperate phage and LUZ24 as a lytic phage, but their
behavior is not totally clear. Indeed, the integration of
PaP3 in the host genome has only been demonstrated
by restriction enzyme analysis [69], and no indication
of immunity or reactivation of an integrated PaP3
prophage is available. On the other hand, LUZ24
forms clear plaques on 36 different strains of P. aeruginosa, but small and turbid plaques on strain PAO [70].
The distance (0.38) observed for these two phages is
more compatible with a distance characteristic of other
lytic phages with genome length of the same order
(such as the group of E. coli phage containing K1E,
K1-5). D3 is a temperate phage with a lambdoid organization, and homologies with HK022/HK97 have been
established [71]. A putative integrase has also been
detected in the genome of PAJU2, and a lysogenic
strain has been isolated [67]. Phage YuA has been
described as a temperate phage and it possesses a
putative repressor and integrase. But, like phage
phiJL001 with which significant similarity is observed,
isolation of a stable lysogenic strain was not possible
[68]. The YuA distance is more characteristic of the
other lytic phages, however it is always possible that
the capacity of YuA to infect P. aeruginosa is recent
and that its genome has not yet evolved through an
amelioration process. Finally, like E. coli phages P1 and
N15, F116 shows a very short distance confirming the
hypothesis that the amelioration process is more efficient for phages able to lysogenize their hosts in a
plasmid form.

Conclusions
Bacteriophage genome comparisons, without the need to
use tools based on sequence homology is possible using
genomic signatures. Our analysis and results, present in
one picture per host, allow us to group the phages
infecting E. coli, S. aureus, M. smegmatis and P. aeruginosa and to determine their life cycle (temperate vs.
lytic).

Page 9 of 12

The hypothesis of the “amelioration” process for the
genomes of temperate phages is reinforced by our
results. Indeed, the majority of the temperate phages
display a shorter genomic signature distance between
their genome and that of their host than that of the
lytic phages. The genomic distance signature can therefore be a useful tool to predict phage life style.
Finally, putative evolutionary groups, for which available data is often dispatched over a fragmented scientific
literature, have been identified on the basis of a conserved genomic signature distance for a coherent genome size range. The genomic signature distance could
therefore be a useful tool to assign, without homology
sequence comparison, a new phage sequence DNA to a
known phage group.

Methods
1/DNA sequences

Caudoviridae (dsDNA) viral genomes infecting four bacterial species and their corresponding host sequences
were retrieved from GenBank phage database: Escherichia coli (46 phage genomes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(33 phage genomes), Staphylococcus aureus (50 phage
genomes) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (60 phage
genomes).
2/Sequence signatures

The signature of each sequence is defined as the frequencies of all possible tetranucleotides in the two
strands of a sequence represented by a vector. The
four hosts under study and their respective phages display large differences in base composition: E. coli
(strain w3110) GC% = 50.8, P. aeruginosa (strain PA7)
GC% = 66.6, S. aureus (strain RF122) GC% = 32.8, M.
smegmatis (strain MC2-155) GC% = 67.4. Genomic
signatures depend on the relative nucleotide proportion within a genome [27]. As phages infecting the
same hosts can present a broad spectrum of nucleotide
base composition differences, in order to compare
their signatures to their host, we standardized the signatures [27]. Assuming that the succession of nucleotides along a sequence follows a random model (a zero
order Markov chain; i.e. that the probability of a particular nucleotide depends only on the nucleotide concentration), the probability to observe a given word is
the product of the probabilities of its constituent letters. Therefore, we constructed mock signatures based
on the genome base composition under consideration.
These signatures were subtracted from the genomic
signature of the genome studied in order to obtain the
standardized signature.
In order to compare genome signatures, we computed
the Euclidian distance

∑i (Vi − H i )2

between host

and virus signatures: where V corresponds to the virus
signature and H to that of the host and i indicates the
tetranucleotide under consideration.
