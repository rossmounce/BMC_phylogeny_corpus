Abstract
Background: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are involved in adaptive and survival responses to
hypoxic stress in mammals. In fish, very little is known about the functions of HIFs.
Results: We have cloned and characterized two distinct HIF-alpha cDNAs – gcHIF-1alpha and
gcHIF-4alpha – from the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp. The deduced gcHIF-1alpha protein is highly
similar to the HIF-1alphas (57–68%) from various vertebrate species, while gcHIF-4alpha is a novel
isoform, and shows an equivalent degree of amino acid identity (41–47%) to the HIF-1alpha, HIF2alpha and HIF-3alpha proteins so far described. Parsimony analysis indicated that gcHIF-4alpha is
most closely related to the HIF-3alpha proteins. Northern blot analysis showed that mRNA levels
of gcHIF-1alpha and gcHIF-4alpha differ substantially under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, while
Western blot studies demonstrated that the endogenous protein levels for both gcHIF-1alpha and
gcHIF-4alpha are similarly responsive to hypoxia. Our findings suggest that both gcHIF-1alpha and
gcHIF-4alpha are differentially regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels. HREluciferase reporter assays show that both proteins function as transcription activators and play
distinct roles in modulating the hypoxic response in grass carp.
Conclusion: There are at least two distinct HIF-alpha isoforms – gcHIF-1alpha and gcHIF-4alpha
– in the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp, which are differentially expressed and regulated in different
fish organs in response to hypoxic stress. Overall, the results suggest that unique molecular
mechanisms operate through these two HIF-alpha isoforms, which underpin the hypoxic response
in the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp.

Background
Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are highly conserved
proteins, found in a wide range of animals, that mediate a

variety of adaptive cellular and systemic responses to
hypoxia by upregulating the expression of more than 60
different genes [1] to assist animals in their adaptation

and survival. HIF is a heterodimeric DNA-binding complex consisting of α and β (also known as aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, or ARNT) subunits
which are members of the bHLH-PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM)
superfamily of proteins [2]. In mammals, three types of
HIF-α s (HIF-1α, -2α and -3α) have been reported (for a
review see [3]), amongst which the HIF-1α is believed to
be the principal regulator of oxygen homeostasis, which
heterodimerizes with ARNT and binds to the hypoxiaresponsive elements (HREs) of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes to trigger their expression [4]. The increase in
HIF-1 activity is primarily due to the hypoxia-induced stabilization and activation of the HIF-1α subunit which is
degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system under normoxic conditions [5]. This process is activated by the
hydroxylation of two conserved proline residues (Pro-402
and Pro-564) within the oxygen-dependent degradation
(ODD) domain of HIF-1α by oxygen-dependent prolyl-4
hydroxylases (PHD) [6,7]. Hydroxylation of these proline
residues increases the affinity of HIF-1α for the Von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) protein, which is part
of an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex that targets the protein
for proteasomal degradation [8]. Moreover, hydroxylation of a conserved asparagine residue (Asn-803) within
the HIF-1α C-terminal activation domain by an asparaginyl hydroxylase, known as Factor Inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH),
under normoxic conditions inhibits the recruitment of the
CBP/p300 coactivator, an important component for HIFdependent transcriptional activation [9].
Fish are ideal models to study molecular and cellular
adaptation to hypoxia because fluctuations in environmental oxygen availability have played an important role
in the evolution of these animals [10]. Indeed, compared
to mammals, the chronic and protective responses to
hypoxia in fish are considerably more diverse [11].
Although HIF-1α and HIF-2α cDNAs have been described
in rainbow trout [12] and Atlantic killifish [13], respectively, the presence and function of these molecules in
cyprinids, which are generally hypoxia-tolerant, has previously not been studied in detail, although sequences of
zebrafish HIFs are available.
In order to obtain broader insights into the evolution and
possible functions of the HIF-αs in fish, we have identified and characterized two distinct HIF-α isoforms –
gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α – from the hypoxia-tolerant grass
carp. Here, we present evidence for the differential roles of
these two HIF-α proteins in grass carp for adaptation to
hypoxia based on their in vivo expression and response
patterns to short- and long-term hypoxia, and in vitro gene
transactivation studies. Moreover, parsimony analysis
(amongst other findings) support the notion that HIF-4α
(so far found only in fish) is possibly an ortholog of the
mammalian HIF-3α.

Results

Identification and cloning of full-length gcHIF-1α and
gcHIF-4α cDNAs
In an attempt to isolate HIF-α-like cDNA sequences from
grass carp, degenerated primers targeting consensus
sequences derived from multiple alignment of the bHLH/
PAS domains of human [GenBank:AF208487], cow [GenBank:AB018398], rat [GenBank:Y09507] and rainbow
trout [GenBank:AF304864] HIF-1α s were used in RT-PCR
on total RNA from kidney of grass carp that was exposed
to 4 h hypoxia. Two distinct cDNA fragments, c12 (0.45
kb) and c18 (1.8 kb), with partial open reading frames
(ORFs) that shared high sequence identity with the HIF-α
proteins (bHLH-PAS domains) of various vertebrates species were identified. Using 5' – and 3' -RACE PCR, fulllength cDNAs were derived for c12 (2092 bp) and c18
(3848 bp), the authenticity of which were confirmed by
full-length RT-PCR on poly (A)+ RNA isolated from grass
carp kidney, and were cloned into the pGEM-T plasmid
vector to produce the corresponding full-length cDNA
clones, SL12 and SL18 (Fig. 1). The clones were completely sequenced on both strands and computer analyses
indicated that SL18 contains 5' – and 3' -untranslated
(UT) regions of 257 and 1238 bp, respectively, and an
ORF that specifies a protein of 774 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 86 kDa, and is consistent with the detection
of a single mRNA transcript of ca. 3.8 kb by Northern blot
analysis (data not shown). SL12 contains 5' – and 3' -UT
regions of 102 and 29 bp, respectively, and an ORF that
encodes for a protein of 643 amino acids with a predicted
Mr of 76 kDa. Northern blot analysis using either the 5' UT or 3' -end (350 bp) sequences of SL12 as probes indicated that SL12 is expressed in two forms in hypoxic kidney, a major 3.7-kb transcript and a minor 2.1-kb
transcript; with the larger transcript showing a 10-fold
higher expression level than the former (data not shown).

Database searches using BLASTX showed that the ORF of
SL18 shares high amino acid identity with the HIF-1α s of
human (64%, [GenBank:AF208487]), cow (65%, [GenBank:AB018398]), rat (64%, [GenBank:Y09507]) and
rainbow trout (68%, [GenBank:AF304864]), and moderate (53% with human HIF-2α, [GenBank:BC051338];
52% with Fundulus HIF-2α, [GenBank:AF402782]) to low
(45% with human HIF-3α, [GenBank:AB054067])
sequence identity with other HIF-α proteins from various
vertebrate species. Moreover, the primary structure of the
deduced protein of SL18 contains the characteristic
bHLH, PAS-A/B, N-TAD and C-TAD domains (Fig. 1) that
are highly similar to homologous domains in the human
and rainbow trout HIF-1α proteins (Fig. 2). Taken
together, these data indicated that SL18 encodes for the
grass carp HIF-1α protein, hereupon designated as gcHIF1α. In contrast, BLAST analysis of the ORF of SL12 showed
that it shares an equivalent degree of sequence identity

Figure structures of the inferred gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α proteins
Domain 1
Domain structures of the inferred gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α proteins. Sequence identities between homologous
domains of the two HIF-α isoforms encoded by cDNA clones, SL18 and SL12, are shown. The amino acid positions delineating
the different domains are indicated and include: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix domain; PASA/B, Per-ARNT-Sim A/B domains;
PAC, domain C-terminal to PAS motifs; ODD, oxygen dependent degradation domain; N-TAD, N-terminal transactivation
domain; and C-TAD, C-terminal transactivation domain.
(41–46%) with the HIF-1α, HIF-2α and HIF-3α proteins
from different animal species; which suggests that SL12
does not belong to any of the known HIF-α subtypes documented thus far. Furthermore, although the deduced
SL12 protein contains the characteristic bHLH, PAS-A/B,
PAC and N-TAD domains, the amino acid sequence at the
C-terminal end is highly divergent from those of the HIF1α, HIF-2α and HIF-3α proteins (Fig. 2). Overall, primary
sequence analyses indicated that SL12 highly likely
encodes for a novel HIF-α protein, hereupon designated
as gcHIF-4α.
Characteristics of the deduced gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α
proteins
Sequence alignment of the deduced gcHIF-1α and gcHIF4α proteins with the rainbow trout HIF-1α (rtHIF-1α),
Fundulus HIF-2α (fHIF-2α) and human HIF-1α, -2α and 3α proteins indicated extensive sequence similarity in the
bHLH, PAS-A/B, PAC and N-TAD domains (Fig. 2).
Importantly, several functionally important sequence
motifs (that mediate HIF-α subcellular translocation and
stability) described in all known members of the HIF-α
protein family are also found in the gcHIF-1α and gcHIF4α deduced proteins. They include (amino acid numbering according to human HIF-1α): the N-terminal nuclear
localization signal (N-NLS; residues 17–74) that mediates
nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of the HIF-α protein
[14,15]; Proline-402 residue, a critical hydroxylation site
that mediates HIF-1α degradation under normoxia [7];
Pro-564, Tyr-565 and Ile-566 which are highly conserved
in the pVHL recognition sequence PYIXXDDDFXL (residues 564–574) within the N-TAD domain [6] that control

ubiquitin/proteasome degradation of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions [16]; and Leu-574, a molecular determinant of Pro-564 hydroxylation that modulates oxygendependent proteolysis of HIF-1α [17]. Moreover, gcHIF1α shares remarkably high sequence similarity with the
human HIF-1α and -2α proteins in the C-TAD region, in
particular the leucine-rich hydrophobic domain encompassing Asn-803 (an asparagine hydroxylase target site),
and Leu-795, Cys-800, Leu-818 and Leu-822 residues
which are required for physical interaction of the HIF-α
protein with the CBP/p300 transactivators [9] to activate
HIF-1 transcriptional activity [18,19]. In addition, Val802, which correctly positions Asn-803 in HIF-1α for
hydroxylation by the asparagine hydroxylase enzyme
[20], is also conserved in gcHIF-1α. In contrast, gcHIF-4α
shares very little sequence identity in its C-terminal region
with the C-TADs of human HIF-1α, -2α or -3α (Fig. 2).
Curiously, gcHIF-4α contains a stretch of glutamic acidrich region (residues 365–397 of gcHIF-4α) that is not
found in the HIF-1α, -2α or -3α deduced proteins (Fig. 2).
Phylogenetic analysis
In order to obtain additional HIF-α homologues from
other fish species for phylogenetic analysis, the Fugu
rubripes (Takifugu rubripes) genome [21], medaka (Oryzias
latipes) genome [22], GenBank/EMBL and zebrafish EST
databases [23,24] were queried using TBLASTN. Three distinct HIF-α-like proteins were identified from the Fugu
genome: one (located in Scaffold2916) shared 71% and
81% sequence identity with the human and rainbow trout
HIF-1α, respectively; the second (in Scaffold159) shared
76% and 81% identity with the human and Fundulus HIF-

2α, respectively; and the third (in Scaffold266) shared
71% identity with gcHIF-4α. Similarly, three distinct HIFα-like proteins were found in zebrafish: one [GenBank:AAH46875] shared 77% identity with human HIF1α; the second [GenBank:BX248102] shared 79–80%
identity with the mammalian HIF-2α s; and the third
[GenBank:CA471737] shared 90% identity with gcHIF4α. Based on amino acid identity, putative HIF-1α homologues from scaleless carp (Gymnocypris przewalskii; [GenBank:AY745735] and grouper (Epinephelus coioides;
[GenBank:AY735010]; and putative HIF-4α homologues
from freshwater pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis; [GenBank:CAAE01014252], medaka (Oryzias latipes; located in
scaffold16794) and grouper [GenBank:AY735011] were
also identified by database search for comparative analysis. Interestingly, we were unable to identify any HIF-3αlike isoforms in fish. Likewise, in silico analysis of the
genome sequences of a number of mammalian species
(human, mouse, rat, cow, dog and cat) in the GenBank
database failed to turn up any HIF-4α-like sequences.
Because the different HIF-α subtypes share high sequence
conservation in the N-terminal bHLH-PAS(A/B) domain
but are highly divergent in the C-terminal region, only the
bHLH-PAS(A/B) sequences of the HIF-α s, ARNT1 and
ARNT2 proteins from various vertebrate species were multiply aligned for phylogenetic analysis. Using the
Caenorhabditis elegans AHA protein as outgroup, a maximum parsimony tree was constructed (bootstrapped with
1000 replications) using the PHYLIP package [25]. As
shown in Fig. 3, two closely-related subclades of HIF-1α s
(97% bootstrap support) – one consisting of avian, Xenopus and mammalian HIF-1α s and the second consisting
exclusively of fish HIF-1α homologues – were obtained.
As expected, the HIF-1α clade is shown to be more closely
related to the HIF-2α (92% bootstrap support) than the
HIF-3α and HIF-4α clades. Most intriguingly, the putative
HIF-4α proteins from six different fish species formed a
distinct clade (94% bootstrap support) which is phylogenetically more similar to the mammalian HIF-3α s (89%
bootstrap support) than to other HIF-α proteins. Phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method also
produced a tree of the same topology with similarly high
bootstrap scores (data not shown).
In vivo expression and response patterns of gcHIF-1α and
gcHIF-4α to short- and long-term hypoxia
To examine the in vivo expression and response patterns of
gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α to hypoxia, grass carps were
exposed to normoxic (7 mg O2/l) and hypoxic (0.5 mg
O2/l) conditions and fish (n = 5) were sampled from each
treatment group and control after 4 and 96 h. Total RNA
was isolated from seven different tissues of each of five
fish from the normoxic and hypoxic groups at each time
point for Northern blot analysis. Overall, normoxic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/15

expression and hypoxic induction patterns of the gcHIF1α and gcHIF-4α genes were consistent amongst the replicate blots derived from different fish tissues, and a representative autoradiogram is shown in Fig. 4. Under
normoxic conditions, the 3.9-kb gcHIF-1α mRNA transcript was expressed most abundantly in eye and kidney;
with lower expression levels being detected in brain, gill,
heart and liver; and negligible expression in muscle. In
contrast, the 3.7-kb gcHIF-4α transcript was expressed at
comparatively higher levels in brain, heart, kidney, liver
and muscle relative to gcHIF-1α under similar conditions.
A marked increase in gcHIF-1α expression was observed in
gill and kidney after exposure to hypoxia for 4 h (but not
at 96 h); while gcHIF-1α expression was seemingly downregulated in brain, heart and liver, and appeared
unchanged in eye. This is in sharp contrast to observations
in rainbow trout [12] and mammals [26-28] where HIF1α mRNA levels are unaffected by hypoxia. Interestingly,
gcHIF-4α (the larger 3.7-kb transcript) was markedly
upregulated following exposure to hypoxia for 4 and 96 h
in eye, gill, heart, kidney, liver and muscle. Curiously,
although the less abundant 2.1-kb gcHIF-4α transcript
showed prominent expression and hypoxic up-regulation
(ca. 5-fold) in kidney; expression of this smaller gcHIF-4α
transcript was barely detectable in all other tissues examined under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (data
not shown).
Expression levels of gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α in all replicates of each hypoxic tissue were normalized against 28S
rRNA and compared with the normoxic counterpart. If
expression levels were the same in both the hypoxia treatment and normoxia control groups, the hypoxia:normoxia expression ratio should theoretically be equal to 1;
whereas the ratio is expected to be significantly greater
than 1 if hypoxic induction of the genes was observed. The
4- and 96-h datasets of each tissue were lumped and a
non-parametric χ2 test was performed to test the null
hypothesis that the hypoxia:normoxia expression ratio
was not significantly different from 1 [29]. The analysis
indicated that while gcHIF-1α expression was significantly
higher in hypoxic kidney as compared to the normoxic
control (P < 0.05), hypoxic induction of gcHIF-4α was
found to be comparatively higher in eye, gill, heart, kidney and liver (P < 0.05).
Western blot analysis of gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α
To investigate the endogenous gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α
protein levels in grass carp liver in normoxia and hypoxia,
liver extracts from fish exposed to 0, 4 and 24 h of hypoxia
were analysed by Western blotting using gcHIF-1α – (AB1) and gcHIF-4α-specific (AB-4) rabbit antisera. The specificity of these polyclonal antibodies was confirmed
using in-vitro-transcribed and -translated gcHIF-1α and
gcHIF-4α proteins which were detected as 86-kDa and 72-

gcHIF-4α and gcHIF-1α, respectively (data not shown).
As shown in Fig. 5B, the AB-1 and AB-4 antibodies each
detected at least two protein bands in the fish liver
extracts, which most likely correspond to post-translationally-modified (differentially phosphorylated) forms of
the respective gcHIF-α proteins. Interestingly, gcHIF-1α is

clearly detectable in the liver of normoxic grass carp (0 h
hypoxia exposure) and is increased by ca. 1.5- and 2.5fold, respectively, following exposure to 4 h and 24 h of
hypoxia. This is in striking contrast to previous observations in mouse [30,31] and rainbow trout [12] where HIF1α is not detectable in liver (or hepatocytes) under normoxic conditions due to rapid proteasomal degradation
of the protein. As for the gcHIF-4α protein, its expression
was also evident in grass carp liver under normoxic condi-

4 h (ca. 2.5-fold) and 24 h (ca. 3-fold) of hypoxia.
Induction of p(HRE)4-LUC reporter expression by gcHIF1α and gcHIF-4α in CHO cells
To compare the transcriptional activity of gcHIF-1α and
gcHIF-4α, CHO-K1 C4.5 cells were cotransfected with a
luciferase reporter plasmid containing the human EPO
HRE element together with expression vectors for either
gcHIF-1α or gcHIF-4α followed by exposure to normoxia
or hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 6, luciferase activity in cells
transfected with the pBK-CMVgcHIF-1α expression vector
showed ca. 2.5-fold increase while cells transfected with
pBK-CMVgcHIF-4α showed a 50% decrease in activity,
respectively, when compared to cells transfected with the
empty pBK-CMV vector (P < 0.05). Interestingly, coexpression of pBK-CMVgcHIF-4α markedly reduced the
transcriptional activity of pBK-CMVgcHIF-1α by more
than 5-fold (P < 0.05), suggesting that gcHIF-1α may be
competitively inhibited by gcHIF-4α. To examine whether
the reduction in gcHIF-1 activity by gcHIF-4α may be
attributed to limiting amounts of endogenous ARNT; a
gcARNT2b expression plasmid was cotransfected into
CHO cells together with pBK-CMVgcHIF-1α and/or pBKCMVgcHIF-4α. While the transfection of gcARNT2b alone
showed no stimulatory effect on the HRE-luciferase
reporter gene, cells cotransfected with gcARNT2b and
gcHIF-1α or gcHIF-4α showed ca. 7-fold and 5-fold
increase in luciferase activity, respectively (P < 0.05), relative to the empty vector. Overall, the induction of luciferase activity was consistently higher in the gcHIF-1α –
than gcHIF-4α-transfected cells (Fig. 6). Cells cotrans-

showed a marked increase in luciferase activity as compared to the empty vector control (P < 0.05). Overall, no
significant difference in luciferase activity was observed
between normoxic and hypoxic gcHIF-α-transfected cells.

Discussion
We have identified and characterized the expression pattern and transcriptional activity of two distinct HIF-α isoforms – gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α – from the grass carp. To
our knowledge, the present study is the first to report the
cloning and comparative analysis of two HIF-α isoforms
from a hypoxia-tolerant fish species. The open reading
frames (ORFs) of gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α are 2325 bp and
1932 bp in length, and encode proteins of 774 and 643
amino acids, respectively. High sequence conservation is
observed in the N-terminal portion of these two proteins
which contain all of the characteristic motifs typical of
HIF-α proteins including: the basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) domain; N-terminal nuclear localization signal
(N-NLS); Per-Sim-ARNT (PAS)-A and -B domains; PASassociated C-terminal (PAC) domain; oxygen-dependent
degradation (ODD) domain; and N-terminal transactivation (N-TAD) domain (Figs. 1 and 2). Sequence comparison showed that while gcHIF-1α is most similar to known
HIF-1α s (57–68%) from different vertebrate species,
gcHIF-4α showed an equivalent degree (41–47%) of
sequence identity in the N-terminal bHLH and PAS

domains (but not the C-terminal domain) with the HIF1α, HIF-2α and HIF-3α proteins so far described, which
led us to believe that gcHIF-4α is a novel HIF-α isoform.
Although the C-terminal region of gcHIF-4α is poorly
conserved in comparison with other vertebrate HIF-α s
(Fig. 2), the fact that it is capable of activating HRE-driven
transcription of the luciferase gene (Fig. 6) suggests that it
probably contains an atypical transactivation domain
with properties distinct from that of the CTADs of HIF-1α,
-2α and -3α. Traditionally, transcription factors have been
classified according to the prevalence of certain amino
acids in the activation domains such as glutamine-rich,
proline-rich and acidic-classes [32]. Analysis of the C-terminal region of gcHIF-4α (amino acids 525–643; Fig. 2)
showed that it is significantly more acidic (20% are aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues) than that of HIF-1α
(12–13%), HIF-2α (12–14%) and HIF-3α (8–11%),
which suggests that gcHIF-4α likely contains an acidic
activation domain. However, further experiments are
needed to further characterize and map the functional
activation domain of this region.

Using Northern hybridization, we demonstrated that
gcHIF-1α is expressed as a single 3.8-kb transcript while
gcHIF-4α is expressed in two forms – a major 3.1-kb transcript and a minor 2.1-kb transcript. We speculated that
the two gcHIF-4α mRNA transcripts are generated either
through the use of alternative transcriptional start sites or
polyadenylation sites although numerous attempts at
using 5' – and 3' -RACE, and degenerate RT-PCR to identify an alternatively spliced variant(s) of gcHIF-4α (in
addition to clone SL12; Fig. 1) have been unsuccessful.
Nonetheless, it was demonstrated that the major 3.1-kb
gcHIF-4α transcript is ubiquitously expressed in a wide
variety of fish tissues in normoxia, albeit at varying levels,
and differs from gcHIF-1α which exhibited a more
restricted expression profile (Fig. 4). Additionally, the
response pattern to hypoxia also differs substantially
between the two genes whereby gcHIF-4α expression is
markedly upregulated in eye, gill, heart, kidney, liver and
white muscle following exposure to short- (4 h) and longterm (96 h) hypoxia, while gcHIF-1α expression was only
marginally upregulated in gill and kidney at 4 h (but not
96 h) hypoxia (Fig. 4). These findings indicated that
gcHIF-1α expression and its regulation is markedly different from its counterparts in hypoxia-sensitive animal species such as rainbow trout [12], mouse, rat and human
[26-28,31] where HIF-1α is ubiquitously expressed and at
a constant level under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
On the other hand, increases in endogenous gcHIF-1α
protein levels in liver of hypoxic fish (Fig. 5) suggest that
gHIF-1α may be stabilized (or its translation increased)
under hypoxic conditions in a manner similar to mammalian HIF-1α [3]. Overall, the differential expression and
regulation patterns of gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α at the
mRNA and protein levels indicate that both genes play
very specialized roles in different fish organs in normoxia
and are essential for tissue response to short- (4 h) and
long-term (96 h) hypoxia in grass carp.
To explore whether a HIF-4α subtype exist in mammals,
TBLASTN search of the genome sequences and EST databases of all available mammalian species (at NCBI) was
performed and a number of hits (which showed between
33–49% sequence similarity to the bHLH and PAS
domains of gcHIF-4α) were obtained. However, closer
inspection indicated that the clones encode for different
members of the bHLH-PAS superfamily of proteins such
as HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-3α, ARNT, AhR, CLOCK, SIM1,
SIM2 and various MOP isoforms, and none showed any
significant similarity to the C-terminal region of gcHIF4α. Based on this, we believe that HIF-4α is probably not
found in mammals and highly likely a novel isoform specific to fish. Conversely, HIF-3α has thus far only been
reported in mammals and bioinformatic searches of several fish (Japanese pufferfish, green puffer, zebrafish and
medaka) genome and EST databases (NCBI) also failed to

BMC Molecular Biology 2006, 7:15

turn up any HIF-3α-like sequence, which suggest that HIF3α may not be present in the genomes of fish. Interestingly, parsimony analysis of 35 HIF-α and 13 ARNT proteins from different animal species indicated that the
putative HIF-4α s from fish form a distinct clade that is
phylogenetically more closely related to the mammalian
HIF-3α s (89% bootstrap support) than to either the HIF1α or HIF-2α proteins (Fig. 3). This raises the intriguing
possibility that HIF-3α and HIF-4α are probably
orthologs that may have arisen following lineage divergence between mammals and fish some 350–400 million
years ago [33].
There are a number of similarities (at the expression and
functional levels) between gcHIF-4α and mammalian
HIF-3α which are in line with this notion. First, expression of gcHIF-4α (Fig. 4) and mammalian HIF-3α [28] is
not only evident under normoxic conditions in tissues
such as brain, heart, kidney and liver, but the mRNA levels
are also markedly upregulated in these same tissues in fish
and rat, respectively, in response to hypoxia. In a related
series of experiments, we have observed (by Northern
hybridization) that VEGF-A mRNA levels in grass carp are
also significantly upregulated in brain, heart, kidney and
liver tissues upon exposure to hypoxia for 4 h which indicated that the HIF system has indeed been activated under
these conditions (unpublished observations). Most
intriguingly, the increase in VEGF-A mRNA levels correlated with the hypoxic increase in gcHIF-4α (but not
gcHIF-1α) mRNA levels in the same tissues (Fig. 4). These
results are consistent with the notion that the function of
gcHIF-4α, and the mechanism(s) regulating its expression
in grass carp, may be similar to that of HIF-3α in mammals, which purportedly represents a rapidly responding
HIF system to short-term tissue hypoxia [28].
Independent evidence supporting the functional similarity of gcHIF-4α to HIF-3α is provided by HRE-luciferase
reporter gene activation studies in which overexpression
of gcHIF-4α was found to attenuate the transcriptional
activity of gcHIF-1α in CHO cells (Fig. 6); a phenomenon
analogous to the suppressive effect of HIF-3α on HIF-1
activity in mammalian cells [34]. Whether the suppression by gcHIF-4α is due to its competition with gcHIF-1α
for ARNT or other bHLH-PAS dimerization partners such
as CLIF [35] and MOP [36]; or its direct binding to HIF1α similar to the inhibitory PAS (IPAS) protein which prevents the nuclear import of HIF-1α and its subsequent
binding to the HREs of downstream target genes [37], is
presently not known. On the other hand, it was observed
that when cotransfected with ARNT, gcHIF-4α (Fig. 6) and
mammalian HIF-3α [34,38] are each able to activate HREdriven transcription, indicating that both are capable of
operating as weak transcription factors. These observations suggest that gcHIF-4α, similar to HIF-3α, may play a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/15

dual regulatory role as a transcriptional activator (HIFARNT dimer) or repressor (presumably in its monomeric
form), depending on the availability of compatible ARNT
molecules (Fig. 6).
It is recognized that the enhancement of transcriptional
activation is dependent upon the stability and translocation of specific HIF-α proteins from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus and their subsequent binding to the HREs of target genes [3]; and a key factor modulating these processes
is the intracellular redox state [39-41]. Recently, it has
been shown that the stability and DNA-binding activity of
rainbow trout HIF-1α (rtHIF-1α) is regulated by a redox
mechanism [41] very similar to the mammalian HIF-2α
[40], whereby the redox sensitivity of both proteins was
attributed to the Cys28 residue in the rtHIF-1α (Cys25 in
mammalian HIF-2α) protein. Changing the Ser28 residue
to Cys28 by site-directed mutagenesis in mammalian HIF1α rendered its DNA-binding activity redox sensitive [40].
Interestingly, the amino acid at position 28 of gcHIF-1α
and gcHIF-4α are, respectively, Ser27 and Cys24 (Fig. 2),
suggesting that the stability and DNA-binding activity of
both proteins may be differentially sensitive to redox
states. Conceivably, redox regulation through sulfhydryl
modifications of cysteine residues could also potentially
occur in the C-terminal transactivation domain, wherein
the redox-sensitive residues may affect both the stability
and activity of the protein [41]. Whether these aspects of
gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α are regulated by cellular redox
states in the grass carp will need to be elucidated in future
studies.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that there are at least two distinct
HIF-α isoforms – gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α – in the
hypoxia-tolerant grass carp and that they are differentially
expressed and regulated in grass carp in response to
hypoxic stress in different fish organs. Our findings suggest that unique molecular mechanisms operate through
these two HIF-α isoforms, which underpin the hypoxic
response in the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp. However, the
in vivo functions of gcHIF-1α and gcHIF-4α remains to be
elucidated, and experiments are underway in our laboratory to compare their stability, nucleocytoplasmic distribution and DNA binding specificity to the HREs of
hypoxia-inducible genes such as gcGlutX [42], gcCITED
[43] and gcVEGF-A [44] in grass carp using the chromatin
immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift
assays. In addition, a comparison of gcHIF-4α with the
corresponding orthologues in hypoxia-sensitive fish species such as rainbow trout would provide further insights
into the role(s) of this novel isoform in hypoxia tolerance
mechanisms in fish.

Methods
Fish
Animal care and experiments were undertaken in accordance with City University of Hong Kong animal care
guidelines. Grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idellus (body
weight of around 500 g) were obtained from a commercial hatchery and acclimatized in 300-l fiberglass tanks
with circulating, filtered and well-aerated tap water at 20
± 1°C for 1 week prior to experimentation. Fish were
reared under normoxia (7.0 ± 0.2 mg O2/l) or hypoxia
(0.5 ± 0.3 mg O2/l) for 4 and 96 h in a continuous flow
system as previously described by Zhang et al [42]. Dissolved oxygen was monitored continuously using an YSI
Model 580 dissolved oxygen meter (Geo Scientific Inc.).
After the exposure period, fish were anaesthetized and tissues were immediately dissected out, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until ready to be
processed.
Cell cultures and treatments
CHO-K1 cells, a gift from Professor Peter Ratcliffe (Wellcome Trust Center for Human Genetics, Oxford University, UK), were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen)), 0.1 mM non-essential
amino acids (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (penicillin G,
100 U/ml; streptomycin, 100 µg/ml) (Invitrogen), in
humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cells were
exposed to either normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2)
by incubating them in an anaerobic incubator (NUAIRE)
in 5% CO2, 94% N2 at 37°C.
RNA isolation and cloning of full-length cDNAs
Total RNA was extracted from grass carp tissues using the
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly (A)+ RNA was purified from total
RNA using the PolyATract System kit (Promega). Using

Bank:AF304864] HIF-1α cDNA sequences, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with total RNA from grass carp
kidney was performed. PCR in a 100- µl mixture was performed on first-strand cDNAs that were reverse transcribed from total RNA (1 µg) using Superscript II RNase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/15

H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo-dT12–18 as
primers and consisted of 20 ng of first strand cDNA, 1 ×
PCR buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl), 1 µM
of each primer, 0.2 mM of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 5 U
of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR
program consisted of predenaturation at 94°C for 3 min,
followed by 35 cycles of amplification (denaturation at
94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min) and a final extension at 72°C for
10 min in a Gene Cycler (Bio-Rad, USA). A 0.45-kb RTPCR product (designated as c12) was obtained with
primer pair, HIF-F1 and HIF-R2, and a 0.8-kb RT-PCR
product (designated as c18) was obtained with primer
pair, HIF-F1 and HIF-R3. DNA sequencing indicated that
both cDNA fragments encode for peptides that share significant sequence similarity to HIF-α proteins. To obtain
the full-length cDNAs of c12 and c18, 5' – and 3' -RACE
PCR were performed using the SMART RACE cDNA
Amplification kit (Clontech). Poly (A)+ RNA (1 µg) from
kidney of hypoxically-stressed grass carp was used as a
source of template. Gene-specific nested primers for 5' RACE were: 1α-5'GSP1 (ACGGCTAAGGAAGGTCTTGCTGTCC) and 1α-5'GSP2 (CCTCGTTGTTTGAGGGATGAGGAATGG)
for
c18;
and
4α-5'GSP1
(TATCCAACAAGCTCAGTGACTCGTC) and 4α-5'GSP2
(GTGAGGAAAGTGCTGCTGTCAAGTG) for c12. Genespecific nested primers for 3' -RACE were: 1α-3' GSP1
(GGTGCTTTGCTTCAGAGTGTGGACAG) and 1α-3' GSP2
(GAAGTTAAAGGATCGAGTGTGCTCGG) for c18; and
4α-3' GSP1 (CAGCTTCCTGACATTGCTGTGTGAG) and
4α-3' GSP2 (GACGAGTCACTGAGCTTGTTGGATA) for
c12. Thirty-five cycles of PCR were performed according to
the manufacturer's recommendations. RACE products
were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) for
DNA sequencing. Full-length cDNAs were obtained by
RT-PCR using two pairs of gene-specific primers: 1α-F
(TACCGACTAGAAGCTGCACCGA) and 1α-R (AGAAAGACTGGAGACTGCAG AGA) for c18; and 4α-F
(GATAAACAAGCTGCAGACGACGT) and 4α-R (GGCA
TGGTTTCAGCAACAGGT) for c12.
Northern blot analysis
Total RNA (20 µg) was electrophoresed on 1% (w/v) agarose/formaldehyde gel and blotted onto Hybond-XL
membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were prehybridised at 65°C for 30 min in ExpressHyb solution
(Clontech) and Northern hybridization carried out at
65°C for 2 h in the same solution containing 2.0 × 106
cpm/ml of [32P]dCTP-labelled cDNA probe prepared by
random priming (GE Healthcare). Blots were washed
thrice in 2 × standard sodium citrate (SSC), 0.05% (w/v)
sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) for 10 min at room temperature, and twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (w/v) for 20
min at 50°C. Blots were exposed on a phosphor screen
(Kodak-K) at room temperature for 20 h, and the signals

were captured and quantified using the Molecular Imager
FX System (Bio-Rad). A 115-bp 28S rDNA fragment (and
confirmed by DNA sequencing) was amplified from grass
carp total DNA using primers 28S-F (GATCCTTCGATGTCGGCTCT)
and
28S-R
(CTAACCTGTCTCACGACGGT) and used as an internal control probe in
northern hybridization for normalization of gene expression.
Plasmid construction
Coding regions of SL18 (gcHIF-1α) and SL12 (gcHIF-4α)
were PCR amplified, respectively, using primers c18F
(ATCCACATATGGATACTGGAGTTGTCACTG; NdeI site is
underlined) and C18R (ATTACCCGGGGTTGACTTGGTCCAGAGCACG; SmaI site is underlined); and primers c12F (ATCCACATATGGTGAACTCGGTGAAT; NdeI
site is underlined) and c12R (ATTACCCGGGAGTAAGGGACGCGAATTCACTAGTG; SmaI site is underlined).
PCR fragments were double digested with NdeI/SmaI and
subcloned into the pIVEX 2.3-MCS prokaryotic expression
vector (Roche) to produce pIVT-gcHIF-1α and pIVTgcHIF-4α plasmids. In vitro expression of the gcHIF-1α
and gcHIF-4α cDNAs was performed using the Rapid
Translation System (RTS 100) kit (Roche). Expression vector pBK-CMV-gcHIF-1α was generated by RT-PCR amplification of gcHIF-1α using primers HIF-1α-F
(TAATAGGCTAGCCTCGCGGTTTGGAAAAACCTAACAC; NheI site is underlined) and HIF-1α-R (TCATGCTCGAGAGTTGACTTGGTCCAGAGCACG; XhoI site is
underlined) to produce a 2.35-kb gcHIF-1α cDNA fragment which was subcloned into the NheI/XhoI sites of
pBK-CMV (Stratagene). Expression vector pBK-CMVgcHIF-4α was generated by RT-PCR amplification of
gcHIF-4α using primers HIF-4α-F (ATCCAGGATCCGAATTTGCAGTGATTTCACTAG; BamHI site is underlined)
and
HIF-4α-R
(TCATGCTCGAGTAAGGGACGCGAATTCACT; XhoI site
is underlined) to produce a 1.95-kb gcHIF-4α cDNA fragment which was subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of
pBK-CMV. Expression vector pBK-CMV-gcARNT2b was
generated by RT-PCR amplification of gcARNT2b [Genusing
primers
gcARNT2b-F
Bank:AY596921]
(TTGCTAGCTAACCGAGGCAATATGGCAACACC; NheI
site is underlined) and gcARNT2b-R (CACTCGAGTCTCCGGTTACTCAG; XhoI site is underlined) to produce a
2.2-kb gcARNT2b cDNA fragment which was subcloned
into the NheI/XhoI sites of pBK-CMV. All constructs were
verified by DNA sequencing.
Transient transfection and luciferase assays
CHO cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per
well and transfected with 120 ng of p(HRE)4-Luc reporter
plasmid and 60 ng of pSVβ-Galactosidase expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using LipofectAMINE 2000®
transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in OptiMEM® I reduced

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/15

serum medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. The p(HRE)4-Luc reporter plasmid consists of 4
copies of the human erythropoietin hypoxia-responsive
element (HRE) linked to the SV40 promoter and firefly
luciferase gene (a gift from Professor Yoshiaki Fujii-Kuriyama, Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance
and Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Japan). Ectopic expression of gcHIFα involved
cotransfection of 120 ng of the respective gcHIF-α expression plasmid(s) or an equimolar amount of the empty
pBK-CMV vector with the luciferase and β-Gal reporter
plasmids in the presence/absence of 120 ng of pBK-CMVgcARNT2b. Transfected cultures were incubated in fresh
medium at 37°C for 24 h and then exposed to normoxia
(21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for 16 h. Luciferase activities of cell lysates were determined using the Bright-Glo™
Luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to
the manufacturer's instructions and normalized against
theβ-galactosidase values to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Data given are means ± S.E.M. from five
independent experiments with three replicates per sample
in each experiment.
Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis
Fish tissues were homogenized using a Polytron tissue disruptor (Kinematica AG) in protein extraction buffer (420
mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES)
with protease inhibitors (0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A and aprotinin; Sigma). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (BioRad).
Anti-gcHIF-1α (AB-1) and anti-gcHIF-4α (AB-4) polyclonal antibodies were raised in different rabbits, respectively, using gcHIF-1α-specific peptides corresponding to
amino acids 153–167 [CSKKTKEQNTERSFFL] and amino
acids 630–644 [CPFSGSRDTSPARSPT], and gcHIF-4αspecific peptides corresponding to amino acids 77–91
[CTKTEETENPTDGFYQ] and amino acids 576–591
[SDDASEEFEPPPQKRC] (Fig. 2); and were custom produced by Eurogentec (Bruxelles, Belgium). Total proteins
were separated in 10% SDS PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked in
4% non-fat dry milk and incubated with AB-1 (1:100 dilution), AB-4 (1:100 dilution) or rabbit anti-β-tubulin
(1:1000; Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies, followed by detection with HRP-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000 dilution in 1% BSA in PBS) using the ECL
Western-blotting system (GE Healthcare). Membranes
were exposed to BioMax MR films (Kodak) and relative
intensities of bands were estimated using the Quantity 1
software (BioRad, U.S.A.).
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed by maximum parsimony using the PROTPARS program of the PHYLIP pack-

age version 3.57 c [25]. Support for the inferred clades was
obtained by bootstrap analysis from 1000 replications of
the data set using the SEQBOOT and CONSENSE programs. Phylogenetic tree was displayed using TREEVIEW
[45]. Sequence analyses and homology searches were performed using the online BLAST suite of programs (NCBI,
USA).
Statistical analysis
A non-parametric χ2 test was used to test the null hypothesis that the ratio of hypoxic:normoxic mRNA expression
level was not significantly different from 1 [29]. One-way
ANOVA was used to examine effects of ectopic expression
of different gcHIF-α s on HRE-driven luciferase activity.
Where significant effects were detected, Tukey's tests were
performed to identify significant difference between individual means; α = 0.05 was used in all statistical tests.
