Abstract
Background: In China, a rapid expansion of Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks has occurred since
2004 and HFMD has become an important issue for China. However, people are still only concerned with human
enterovirus 71(HEV-71) and coxsackie virus A16 (CV-A16). Much of what is known about the other enterovirus
infections relies on fractional evidence and old epidemic data, with little knowledge concerning their distribution.
To alert potential threatens of the other enteroviruses, our study genetically characterized specimens from different
regions of China and yielded novel information concerning the circulating and phylogenetic characteristics of
enteroviral strains from HFMD cases.
Findings: A total of 301 clinical throat swabs were randomly obtained from patients suffering from HFMD from
the southern, northern and central regions of China during outbreaks in 2009. 266 of 301 (88.4%) HFMD cases
were found positive for HEV and seven genotypes, HEV-71, CV-A16, -B5, -A4, -A6, -A10, and -A12, were detected.
Conclusions: The HFMD pathogen compositions in the different regions of China were significantly different.
HFMD epidemics might persist for a long time in China due to the multiple pathogen compositions, the
enteroviral characteristic of recombination and co-infection, the ever-increasing travel and migration and the
deficiency of effective vaccine. Our study deserves the attention on HFMD control and vaccine development.

Background
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common
childhood illness characterized by fever and vesicular
eruptions on the hands, feet and mouth. HFMD is
caused by a few serotypes of enteroviruses, most frequently coxsackie virus A16 (CV-A16) and human
enterovirus 71 (HEV-71), and the severe forms were
often associated with HEV71. Other enteroviruses (CVA2, -A4, -A5, -A6, -A8, -A9,-A10, -A16,-B3 and -B5),
may also be associated with HFMD outbreaks, sporadic
cases or asymptomatic infections [1-3].
In recent years, the prevalence of HFMD in the AsiaPacific region, especially in Southeast Asia, has greatly

increased. In China, a rapid expansion of HFMD outbreaks has occurred since 2004 [4-7]. In 2009, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China
CDC) confirmed 1,155,525 cases in Mainland China
including 353 deaths. (http://www.moh.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/mohbgt/s10639/201002/46043.

Objective

Although HFMD has become an important issue for
China, people are still only concerned with HEV-71 and
CV-A16. Much of what is known about the other enterovirus infections in China relies on fractional evidence
and old epidemic data, with little knowledge concerning
their distribution. To alert potential threatens of the
other enteroviruses, our study genetically characterized
specimens from different regions of China and yielded

phylogenetic characteristics of enteroviral strains from
HFMD cases.
Study design

A total of 301 clinical throat swabs were randomly
obtained from patients suffering from HFMD in Guangdong (southern China), Beijing (northern China) and
Shandong (central and eastern China) during outbreaks
in 2009. All patients were identified according to the
Ministry of Health diagnostic criteria (http://www.moh.
gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/mohyzs/s3586/
201004/46884.htm; Chinese website). The age distribution of HFMD cases was from 1 month to 12 years, and
the median age was 2 years.
Semi-nested RT-PCR on the 5’ partial region of VP1
with sense (GCIATGYTIGGIACICAYRT; CCAGCACTGACAGCAGYNGARAYNGG) and antisense (CICCIGGIGGIAYRWACAT; TACTGGACCACCTGGNGGNAYRWACAT) primers was used to type HEV directly
from specimens as previously described [8]. Amplified
DNA was purified using a commercial procedure (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Cat. No 28704), Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) and then sequenced on an ABI3730 automated sequencer (Applied Biosciences, Foster City, CA)
using Big Dye reagents (version 3.0). Using the MEGA4
software, partial sequences were aligned with the
sequences retrieved from GenBank by using the neighbor-joining method.

Results
266 of 301 (88.4%) HFMD cases were found positive for
HEV by using enterovirus general primers. HEV-71,
CV-A16 occupied 50.4% and 38.3% of typed strains
respectively. CV-B5 only detected from Shandong specimens and occupied 14.4 of Shandong typed strains.
Additionally, four other genetically distinct strains, CVA4, A6, A10, and A12, were also detected (Table 1).
The 112 obtained sequences have been submitted to
GenBank under accession numbers HM447216-447233
and HM459721-459814.
All the identified HEV-71 strains belonged to subgenogroup C4 (Figure 1a). High homologous (95.1%100.0%) was noticed between the isolated stains from

three different regions, but lower homologous showed
between the new isolated stains and C4 previous strains
isolated in 2001 and 2003. Notably, C4 is predominantly
responsible for almost all HEV-71 infections in more
than 10 years in Mainland China [9]. In contrast, the
analysis of recent and previous HEV71 isolates in the
Western Pacific Region showed that several subgenogroups, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4, were cocirculating in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan
and Japan, respectively [3,10]. It seemed that the HEV71
strains evolved independently in Mainland China.
All CV-A16 strains evaluated in this study grouped
with cluster B1a and B1b with 87.8-100% identity (Figure 1b), consistent with Chinese CV-A16 strains isolated
between 1999 and 2008, which were also found in Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Vietnam, and Saudi
Arabia [11]. It indicated that the Chinese CV-A16
strains coevolved and co-circulated with those from surrounding countries. Interestingly, this was very different
with Chinese HEV71 (the genetic evolution of Chinese
HEV71 didn’t share with neighboring countries),
although both of them were genetically closely related
and shared the similar transmission mode.
CV-B5 was present in 5.3% of typed strains with 98.4100% identity. The Chinese strains [GenBank:
AY695109], which were isolated from Zhejiang in 2002,
were the closest observed among the strains analyzed.
Strains clustering in the same subgroup were from
Shandong of China, Korea, France, and Belarus, and all
were isolated in 2005. Sequences from the 2000 Chinese
Yunnan strain and the 1998 Shandong strain clustered
in another subgroup, suggesting that CV-B5 types probably vary with time rather than geographical
distribution.
All CV-A4, -A6, -A10, and -A12 strains evaluated segregated into individual genetic clusters distinct from
previously reported sequences. The CV-A4 Chinese
2008 Shandong [GenBank: GQ253372] and 2004Yunnan
[GenBank: AB268278] strains were the most closely
related strains to those isolated in our study. The Japanese CV-A6 strains from 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2005
showed the closest relationship with our new CV-A6
strains. The CV-A10 Chinese 2008 and 2009 Shandong

Figure 1 Consensus phylogenetic tree constructed with human enterovirus (HEV)-71 (a) and coxsackie virus (CV)-A16 (b) sequences,
including isolates from the present study (dots). The nucleotides correspond to the prototype BrCr strain at positions 2597-2900 for (a) and
(b).

[GenBank: GQ214173 and GU947787] strains were
more closely related to those in our study than the earlier Shandong strains and the other Japanese, German
and American strains. We found only four sequences
that could be compared with our three sequenced CVA12 isolates, and the 2003 Japanese strains showed the
closest relationship with our new CV-A12 strains.

Discussion
The HFMD pathogen compositions in the southern,
northern, and central regions of China were significantly
different. Guangdong had an epidemic of HEV-71 over
10 years ago, but in 2009, CV-A16 was the dominant
strain, likely as a result of the previous immune barrier
on HEV-71. The epidemic of Beijing increased only in
recent years, and both HEV-71 and CV-A16 were the
major epidemic strains in 2009. Shandong reported the
most HFMD cases and exhibited the most diverse
pathogens, except HEV-71 and CV-A16, CV-B5

occupied 14.4% of typed strains in Shandong in 2009,
this matched with its huge population and central communicating location.
In our study, we detected and analyzed four other
HEVs (CV-A4, -A6, -A10, and -A12) that were simultaneously coexisting in China. Although some HFMD outbreaks and sporadic cases have been associated with
them, eg., CV-A6 had been identified as the etiologic
agent of HFMD outbreak in Finland [2], they only were
detected from few HFMD patients in our study. Therefore, their relationship with HFMD may not be identified in China in 2009. However, the coexisting of
multiple enteroviruses and the viral ability of co-infection and recombination suggested that, except HEV-71
and CV-A16, other enteroviruses also had the possibility
to cause HFMD epidemic in China. It deserves our
attention on HFMD control and vaccine development.
HFMD epidemics might persist for a long time in China
due to the multiple pathogen compositions, the
