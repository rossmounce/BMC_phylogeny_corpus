Introducing the refined gravity hypothesis of
extreme sexual size dimorphism
Guadalupe Corcobado1*, Miguel A Rodríguez-Gironés1, Eva De Mas1, Jordi Moya-Laraño1,2

Abstract
Background: Explanations for the evolution of female-biased, extreme Sexual Size Dimorphism (SSD), which has
puzzled researchers since Darwin, are still controversial. Here we propose an extension of the Gravity Hypothesis
(i.e., the GH, which postulates a climbing advantage for small males) that in conjunction with the fecundity
hypothesis appears to have the most general power to explain the evolution of SSD in spiders so far. In this
“Bridging GH” we propose that bridging locomotion (i.e., walking upside-down under own-made silk bridges) may
be behind the evolution of extreme SSD. A biomechanical model shows that there is a physical constraint for large
spiders to bridge. This should lead to a trade-off between other traits and dispersal in which bridging would favor
smaller sizes and other selective forces (e.g. fecundity selection in females) would favor larger sizes. If bridging
allows faster dispersal, small males would have a selective advantage by enjoying more mating opportunities. We
predicted that both large males and females would show a lower propensity to bridge, and that SSD would be
negatively correlated with sexual dimorphism in bridging propensity. To test these hypotheses we experimentally
induced bridging in males and females of 13 species of spiders belonging to the two clades in which bridging
locomotion has evolved independently and in which most of the cases of extreme SSD in spiders are found.
Results: We found that 1) as the degree of SSD increased and females became larger, females tended to bridge
less relative to males, and that 2) smaller males and females show a higher propensity to bridge.
Conclusions: Physical constraints make bridging inefficient for large spiders. Thus, in species where bridging is a
very common mode of locomotion, small males, by being more efficient at bridging, will be competitively superior
and enjoy more mating opportunities. This “Bridging GH” helps to solve the controversial question of what keeps
males small and also contributes to explain the wide range of SSD in spiders, as those spider species in which
extreme SSD has not evolved but still live in tall vegetation, do not use bridging locomotion to disperse.

Background
Sex differences in body size, or sexual size dimorphism
(SSD), are widespread across the animal kingdom [1-4],
and hypothetically reflect the different selective pressures acting on males and females [5,6]. Female-biased
SSD (females larger than males) is the most common
pattern, typical in invertebrates and ectothermic vertebrates. Even though fecundity selection favoring large
females [1,7] is the most accepted explanation for
female-biased SSD, two questions remain unsatisfactorily
solved. First, what selective pressures act on males in

order to keep them small [5,8] in spite of the usually
high genetic correlation between the sexes? [9]; and second, what factors are responsible for the wide range of
variation in SSD present in nature? [10].
SSD is widespread among spiders (Araneae). There
is a general pattern of female-biased SSD which is highly
variable among taxa [11,12]. Additionally, spiders are the
only group of free-living terrestrial organisms in which
extreme SSD - i.e., females twice as large as males [13]-,
is common, and in which this pattern has evolved several times independently [13]. Most spider species exhibiting extreme SSD are found among Orbicularian
spiders (especially in the families Tetragnathidae, Theridiidae and Araneidae) and the family Thomisidae within
the RTA clade. However, some exceptional cases can be
found in other taxa, including the Mygalomorphae [14].

Hormiga et al. [13] in a study based on 9 families of
Orbicularian spiders (526 species) found that 24 out of
76 genera showed female-biased extreme SSD and that
extreme SSD had been gained and lost several times
across the phylogeny. Vollrath & Parker [15] found that
in web-building spiders (7 families from the Orbiculariae
clade plus the families Agelenidae and Atypidae - the
latter belonging to the old Mygalomorphae clade-), 93
out of 159 species showed extreme SSD, and 17 out of
the 20 species of sampled Thomisidae also showed
extreme SSD. In contrast none of the 41 species from
the 7 families: Pisauridae, Lycosidae, Salticidae, Philodromidae, Sparassidae, Clubionidae and Gnaphosidae,
showed extreme SSD [15]. Thus, spiders, especially
those from the Orbicularian clade and the family Thomisidae, constitute a perfect system to study the evolution of extreme SSD.
In spiders, the most accepted hypothesis explaining
the actual pattern of SSD is the fecundity selection
hypothesis, by which females increase in size due to
selection imposed on fecundity [7,13,16-18]. Nevertheless, this hypothesis does not offer a solid explanation
for the wide range of SSD found across spiders. In particular, fecundity selection does not explain why there are
some species in which males grow almost as giant as
females while in others males stay small while females
grow gigantic. Additionally, there is a strong controversy
about which selective pressures act on male size and
thus on the adaptative significance of SSD [12]. In spiders, males and females share the same lifestyles until
maturation. Following maturation males, which are generally the searching sex, change their lifestyle and start
roaming, searching for females to mate with [[19], but
see [20]]. As a consequence of this particular male lifestyle, many hypotheses have tried to explain the adaptive
significance for the evolution of SSD in relation to male
agility or the ability of males to find receptive females,
which usually point to advantages of small body size
[1,15,21-25]. However, a global and integrative explanation for the evolution of extreme SSD has not been
achieved thus far [reviewed in [12]].
The gravity hypothesis (GH) [25] links the evolution
of extreme SSD with the capacity of males to move on
vertical surfaces. The GH predicts that smaller males
should be favored because they climb faster and, as a
result, these males would have an advantage either by
scramble competition (more mating opportunities) or
natural selection (escaping from predators). Although
there is some controversy around the GH [26-30], it has
been shown that the relationship between climbing
speed and body mass is curvilinear with an optimal
body mass for climbing [31]. Consequently, it has been
suggested that extreme SSD has evolved only in those

Page 2 of 14

species that 1) live in high habitats and 2) in which
females are larger than the optimal climbing mass.
However, in species living in high habitats spiders do
not only walk or climb to disperse: they also bridge.
Bridging is a very common means of aerial locomotion
in spiders [32-34] that has nevertheless been relatively
neglected in the literature [but see [35-40]]. To bridge, a
spider releases a line of silk that the wind attaches to a
distant plant, and after actively tensing the line by pulling it back with its legs, the spider crosses hanging
upside-down from the line [38]. Different sources of evidence support the hypothesis that the morphology (leg
length relative to body size) of modern spiders (Araneomorphae) that hang upside-down from their webs, has
evolved to facilitate bridging, allowing spiders to swing
as pendulums from their silk threads [38]. This finding
suggests that bridging plays an important role in the life
of some spider taxa [33], and that during evolutionary
time morphological adaptations to bridging locomotion
should be expected in spiders that live in high places
[38]. Given that dispersal through bridging is very
uncommon among very large individuals (GC and JML,
personal observations), constraints on bridging could
help to explain the evolution of SSD in spiders.
Morse & Fritz [35] hypothesized that heavy Misumena
vatia females did not use bridging for long-distance dispersal because, due to the elasticity of silk, the sag of
the fiber would bring the spiders down to the ground
when they crossed their silk bridges. This hypothesis is
confirmed by a biomechanical model showing that large
spiders cannot use bridging as an efficient dispersal
mechanism. Large spiders are limited to short bridging
events or to bridging events that start high above the
surface (Rodríguez-Gironés et al. unpublished manuscript). Spiders have up to 5 different types of silk glands
which spin fibrous silks characterized by different
mechanical properties and linked to distinct ecological
functions [42-44]. The kind of silk used to bridge is
spun in the minor ampullate glands [33,34]. Some
remarkable properties of this kind of silk are the thin
diameter of its fibers, their low strength and their high
extensibility [44]. Although spiders have some control
on the diameter of their minor ampullate silk fibers
[45], as well as the diameter of other types of lines [eg.
[46-50]], phenotypic plasticity in thread diameter is
severely limited [51], possibly constraining the ability of
large spiders to bridge. Thus, while giant female spiders
perform short bridging events during web building [33],
large adult web-building spiders move less often and
shorter distances than juveniles [52]. This could be due
to the fact that large spiders are not able to bridge long
distances efficiently (Rodríguez-Gironés et al. unpublished manuscript).

It is easy to see how a small size could be favored in
habitats in which bridging is the most frequent mode of
locomotion. If large spiders forego bridging, they will
have to walk along leaves, twigs and branches, climbing
down to the ground, walking towards their target and
climbing up again. Other than the extra time and energy
expended by climbing up and down, this implies an
increase in the length of their trajectory. In addition,
once spiders are morphologically adapted to bridge, this
would be particularly disadvantageous, as their illadapted morphology makes large spiders clumsy walking
on the ground [38]. If, on the other hand, these large
spiders choose to bridge, the short distance they can
span in a single bridging event will force them to perform a greater number of bridging events to cover the
same distance, as compared to smaller individuals, thus
expending more time and energy by having to build
more lines [38]. Bridging imposes a final cost on large
spiders linked to the GH of SSD [25,31]. The actual trajectory of a spider during bridging has some resemblance with an inverted parabola: from the midpoint on,
spiders must actually climb to reach their goal. If climbing speed decreases in spiders of relatively large mass, as
a few studies have shown, [25,29,31], large size will be
disadvantageous during the final stages of bridging. Even
though some studies have failed to find a negative relationship between body size and climbing speed in spider
males [26,30], the lack of this pattern in males, which
exhibit a small range of variation in size than females,
could be the product of the “ghost of the evolution
past” [8]. This would imply that we could not find a
climbing disadvantage for larger males because the sizes
of extant males fall below the threshold beyond which
body size constraints climbing speed. Indeed, using a
sufficiently wide range of body sizes, researchers showed
that the relationship between climbing speed and this
trait has an optimum at intermediate value, after which
climbing speed decreases with body size, as predicted by
the GH [31].
Given that males are the searching sex in spiders [19],
selective pressures on morphological traits enhancing
mobility in general, and bridging in particular, should be
much stronger in males than in females. Hence, in species living in high habitats, where bridging is a common
mode of locomotion [32-34,36], being a good “bridger”
could be adaptive for males, since they could be favored
from sexual selection by scramble competition. Previous
studies have already suggested the advantage of more
mobile males related to scramble competition in spiders
with extreme SSD as well as the implications in the evolution of SSD [25,36,53,54]. Considering the biomechanical constraint of the model mentioned above and the
low rate at which giant females seem to bridge, we
hypothesise that there should be a negative relationship

Page 3 of 14

between body size and bridging ability and that this
bridging constraint should have played a role in the evolution of extreme SSD in spiders. In this paper we test
these hypotheses.
A more comprehensive way to introduce these predictions is assuming a trade-off between traits positively
correlated to body size and traits negatively correlated
to body size (Figure 1). Assuming heritability in body
size, if bridging is negatively correlated with body size
and other traits are positively correlated with large size,
such as fecundity in females [7], and in males walking
on the ground [26] and/or advantages in male-male
contest competition [55], two scenarios are possible, the
evolution of extreme SSD and the evolution from
extreme SSD to reversed monomorphism [13]. The evolution of male and female body sizes along the trajectory
of the trade-off will depend on the direction and magnitude of the net effect of opposing selective forces, those
that favor a large body size on the one hand and those
that favor a small body size on the other. Furthermore,
this net effect of opposing selective forces will also have
to overcome the genetic correlation between the sexes
[9] for extreme SSD to evolve. Reversal to monomorphism could evolve in environments in which dispersal by
bridging is more important in females than fecundity
(such as highly unpredictable environments for prey
availability) and/or contest competition or walking on
the ground is more important than bridging for males
(such as habitats with sparse vegetation).
Here we use bridging propensity, i.e., the probability
of building a bridging line and crossing it by walking
upside-down under laboratory conditions of constant
wind speed, as a proxy for the ease with which spiders
can bridge in nature. The rationale of the approach is
that if larger spiders have a stronger constraint for bridging, then selection should have favored a lower propensity to disperse by this mechanism in larger individuals.
We measured bridging propensity in laboratory conditions for adult males and females of 13 spider species of
considerable phylogenetic diversity (Table 1; Figure 2),
both within the Orbicularian clade and the family Thomisidae -RTA clade-, covering a broad range of spider
body sizes (Table 1). After the trials were finished all
the spiders were weighed and their carapace width
(CW) measured. To analyze the data we used phylogenetically controlled analyses. We predicted that i) SSD
would explain sex differences in bridging propensity, in
the sense that when both males and females are small
and of similar size both would bridge at the same rate,
but when females start growing to a large size and
males remain relatively small, then females would bridge
at a much lower rate; ii) there is a negative relationship
between body size and the probability of bridging for
both males and females.

and a size-mediated trade-off between other male competitive abilities (e.g. walking on the ground, male-male contest competition) and
bridging ability (males) can lead to the evolution of extreme SSD and the reversal to monomorphism. Black circles, ancentral bi-variate trait; Red
circles, trait values after the response to opposite selection in females and males; Blue circles, values after response to selection converging to
similar female and male sizes. The horizontal dotted arrows denote the strength of selective forces (i.e. favouring bridging) decreasing body size
and the vertical solid arrows denote the strength of selective forces increasing body size. The red and blue arrows denote the trajectories of the
response to selection along the trade-off line. When fecundity selection in females is stronger than selection for dispersal, female gigantism
evolves. When selection for dispersal by bridging is stronger in males, male dwarfism evolves. The join effect is the evolution of extreme SSD.
Similarly, when dispersal is favoured over fecundity in females and other male competitive abilities are favoured over bridging in males, reversal
to monomorphism will evolve.

Results
Bridging propensity vs. SSD

As predicted, we found a negative relationship between
SSD and sexual dimorphism in bridging propensity. The
phylogenetically controlled GLS analysis showed that the
differences in bridging propensity across species were significantly explained by SSD, whether measured as body
size (CW, t11 = -3.296, p = 0.004) or as body mass (t11 =
-2.440, p = 0.016). This relationship was negative for
both variables (Figure 3, see also tables A1, A2 in Additional file 1, and Figure A1 in Additional file 2), which
implies that when females are much larger than males,
males bridge at higher rates relative to females (see
Methods below for a more detailed explanation of how
the SDI index was built). The variation of the GLS analyses including male bridging propensity as well as female

and male body size as independent variables, with female
bridging propensity as the dependent variable, also
revealed that SSD was negatively related to differential
bridging propensity. After controlling for male body size
and male bridging propensity, female body size was negatively related to female bridging propensity for both CW
and body mass (t9 = -3.059, p = 0.007 and t9 = -3.631,
p = 0.003, respectively; Figure 4, table A3 in Additional
file 1). Taken together, our results show that a lower
bridging propensity of females is linked to stronger
female-biased SSD across taxa.
Bridging propensity vs. size in females and males

Both females and males tended to bridge less when larger. The GLS analyses ran separately for females showed
that female size, measured either as CW or body mass,

Bridging propensity is the proportion of females or males that bridge.

explained the proportion of bridging females, with the
larger taxa having a lower propensity to bridge (Female
mass: t11 = -4.751, p < 0.001; Female CW: t11 = -4.528,
p < 0.001; Figure 5a, b). Likewise, males with wider carapaces were significantly less prone to bridge (Male
CW: t11 = -2.350, p = 0.019), and a negative relationship

was also found for body mass, although this last relationship was only marginally significant (Male mass:
t11 = -1.668, p = 0.061; Figure 5c, d; see also tables A4,
A5 in Additional file 1, and Figure A2 in Additional file
2). The slopes for males and females (tables A4 and A5
in Additional file 1) differ in almost one order of magnitude, being those of males much flatter than those of
females. Actually, when we combined males and females
in the same GLS analysis we found a significant interaction between sex and body size, measured either as
mass (t 22 = -3.093, p = 0.003) or CW (t 22 = -2.516,
p = 0.020; table A6 in Additional file 1).

respectively, where body mass, m, is expressed in mg
and carapace width, CW, in mm. These equations can be
used to determine the maximum body mass and size
beyond which spiders do not bridge. We define the bridging threshold as the body mass or size beyond which
the probability of bridging declines below 0.05. Setting P

= 0.05 in equations 1 and 2 and solving for m and CW,
we obtain that spiders in our sample size were very unlikely to bridge if their body mass was greater than 118.32

than 4.17 mm (95% CI: 2.97 - 6.42) (Figure 6).

Discussion
As we predicted following our extended version of the
GH, SSD (measured using CW or body mass) clearly
explains the different bridging abilities between males
and females, suggesting that in species living in high

habitats, selection has favored small size in males via the
enhancement of bridging. Due to the genetic correlation
in body size between the sexes, this force acting upon
males should have been strong enough to overcome the
strong fecundity selection acting on females, which is
the driving force of female gigantism. Our results show
that in species where females are small and of similar
size to males (low SSD), both sexes bridge at a similar,
and substantially high rate, but when SSD increases and
females become much larger than males, these relatively
giant females stop using bridging to move, while males
keep bridging at a very high rate. This pattern showing
that large body size constrains bridging is also found
when we analyze the sexes separately. Thus, body size
alone can explain a large part of the variation on the
proportion of females that bridged across species.

Although we found the same trend in males, the results
tended to be less clear - probably because the size of all
males examined was too low to severely constrain bridging locomotion (see Figure 6) and a high proportion of
males bridged even in the largest species. Therefore,
within bridging species, the current body size distribution of male body sizes could be the product of the
“ghost of the evolution past” [8], which refers to the fact
that the evolutionary processes that we can measure
today do not necessarily reflect adaptive evolution
occurring in the past [see also [27]]. In other words, if
we measure natural selection within a species in nature,
and find that smaller sizes are not favored during mate
search, the underlying reason could be that all male
sizes fall below the bridging threshold, and this by no
means would mean that selection for bridging had not

trial of one single individual (females solid circles, males empty
circles). To distinguish between males and females, successful
bridging takes the value of 1 for females and 1.05 for males, while
unsuccessful bridging takes the value of 0 for females and 0.05 for
males. The red arrows show the threshold beyond which the
predicted probability of bridging is les than 5%, and the red small

originated the pattern of SSD in the evolutionary past
(see however an example below suggesting bridging
selection against large males in natural conditions), but
rather that past selection has been stronger in males (see
evidence for this below). The strength of the evolutionary
comparative method relies precisely in comparing species
(or taxa), allowing expanding the range of variation of
traits and thus increasing the chances of detecting

adaptive patterns. Together, our results confirm a sizemediated trade-off involving bridging which leads to the
evolution of extreme SSD. In species living in high habitats, selection would have favored a small size in males
via the enhancement of bridging. By contrast, in females,
a relatively low environmental stochasticity in prey availability would select for fecund (and thus large) females
that would need to disperse relatively little, leading to the
evolution of extreme SSD. A reversal to monomorphism
could also occur when an increase in environmental stochasticity for prey availability selects for high dispersal
rates in females or when male-male contest competition
or other dispersal modes favoring a large size become
more important for males. The fact that the slope of the
relationship between size and bridging propensity is
much steeper in females than in males also supports the
hypothesis that selection in the past has been much
stronger in males than in females, making the slope of
the trade-off to tilt up in males [56].
A question remaining to be tested would be whether
the evolution of SSD is a cause or a consequence of
bridging dispersal in elevated habitats. Although the
final answer will have to wait for a larger study than
this one, including species with and without SSD, with
and without bridging dispersal, our data suggest that
selection to preserve bridging in males has induced SSD
when female size has increased. At least in the Orbicularian clade, the ancestral state would be small males
and females [13], and we can hypothesize that both
sexes bridged (certainly the males: males bridge in all
Orbicularian species that we have tested). If this was
indeed the ancestral state, it follows that through the
evolution of the clade females of different species have
repeatedly and independently foregone bridging because
the advantages of increasing body size (increased
fecundity) were larger than the costs of losing mobility.
Males, on the other hand, have remained small enough
to bridge. In this scenario, SSD is the result of two
selective pressures: on females to increase their fecundity [13] and on males to retain their bridging ability. For
the family Thomisidae, on the other hand, the lack of a
resolved phylogeny and the paucity of our data preclude
us from advancing even a preliminary answer to the
question. However, the hypothesized trade-off in Figure
1, and the evidence supporting it in this paper, suggests
that bridging would have always preceded the evolution
of extreme SSD, as this is a plausible scenario in which
opposing selection for large size in females and small
size in males leads to extreme SSD. It is more difficult
to think about a possible reversed scenario, in which
extreme SSD would lead to an increase in sex differences of bridging propensity.
The mechanical properties of the silk prevent large spiders from bridging (Rodríguez-Gironés et al. [41]), and

Corcobado et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/236

the threshold of 118.32 mg observed in our data (beyond
which the probability of bridging is less than 5%) is in
good agreement with the biomechanical model, which
predicts that bridging should be constrained beyond
masses of 100 mg. Consequently extreme SSD can be
expected in high habitats and in those bridging species in
which females are larger than the threshold to bridge efficiently, even if they live just barely above the ground.
Beyond the bridging threshold, females can still evolve to
be larger (due to the advantages originated from fecundity selection), but males will not. Hence, this bridging
constraint and the associated trade-off (Figure 1) would
decelerate the rate of male and female body size coevolution, relaxing the genetic correlation of body size between
the sexes and leading eventually to the evolution of
extreme female-biased SSD.
In addition, there is some evidence suggesting that silk
properties also depend on the feeding condition of the
spider, as starved spiders produce silk of worse quality
[57]. This fact would be particularly relevant to females
since they must allocate their nutritional and energetic
resources not just to produce silk for bridging, but also
in the production of offspring and silk for the egg sac
[51]. Thus, beyond a certain body size threshold, this
reproductive trade-off could have also favored females
that do not use bridging locomotion and save resources
to invest in reproduction, particularly when fecundity
selection is the main driving force of body size. Males,
on the other hand, by being released from fecundity
selection, could be favored by having large protein
reserves to spin the necessary silk to move around at
the price of having the burden of carrying heavier body
masses during mate search, which has been shown to be
detrimental for bridging [54]. Alternatively, selection
could favor a smaller size that would allow males to
bridge efficiently without having a high demand of
nutrients. Assuming that the cost of energy and nutrient
expenditure of smaller males is relatively less than the
benefit of bridging more efficiently, we propose that the
second explanation is more likely to be true.
The hypothesis that selection favoring bridging efficiency in males has been responsible for the evolution
of extreme SSD is not incompatible with other hypotheses that explain selection on small males. On the contrary, we suggest that our hypothesis is complementary.
For example, the Differential Mortality Model predicts
that smaller males are favored because the high predation risk that males suffer during mate searching relaxes
male-male contest competition for females, and ultimately selection favoring large males. This in turn favors
early maturation because it improves male viability and
his chances to reproduce [15,58]. Certainly, direct selection favoring smaller bridging males and indirect viability selection also favoring smaller males can work

Page 9 of 14

synergistically. The GH [25] also predicts that small
males are favored because they move faster in vertical
surfaces. Additionally, a recent revision of this hypothesis shows a curvilinear relationship between body mass
an climbing speed, proposing that extreme SSD would
have evolved in species where females live in high habitats and are larger than the optimal body mass for
climbing [31]. Whether selection for fast climbing or
efficient bridging has been stronger over evolutionary
time depends on how often spiders use each of these
two kinds of locomotion, and also on how often they
walk on the ground, which has actually been shown to
favor relatively larger males [26,30]. These different
sources of selection need to be evaluated with field
work. Nonetheless, as far as we know, there is only one
study (using males of Nephila clavipes) that has evaluated different kinds of locomotion in spiders, and this
study shows that bridging is by far the most frequent
mechanism used to move and that smaller males are
favored at finding mates [36]. However, we would like
to stress that this extended version of the Gravity
Hypothesis, also considering bridging locomotion, supports the more global explanation that in general gravity
is an important factor to explain the evolution of
extreme SSD. Furthermore, this “Bridging GH” even
explains the exceptional cases in which there is no
extreme SSD in species with relatively giant females living on relatively tall vegetation, as it is the case for
some species within the families Theraphosidae, Ctenidae, Oxyopidae and Sparassidae. The absence of
extreme SSD in these taxa could be related to the fact
that these species have not evolved bridging capabilities
or bridging morphologies [38] and consequently the
selective pressures to keep males small would be less
strong. Finally, our hypothesis and the fecundity selection hypothesis [7] are not mutually exclusive either, as
the second only explains why females are large, not why
males are relatively small in some species with large
females and not in others. Rather, a bridging-fecundity
trade-off acting on females can help to explain the evolution of extreme SSD (Figure 1).

Conclusions
Bridging is a neglected dispersal mode that can explain the
evolution of extreme SSD in spiders. Physical constraints
make bridging inefficient for large spiders. Thus, in species
where bridging is a very common mode of locomotion,
small males, by being more efficient bridgers, will enjoy
more mating opportunities and thus will be better at
scramble competition to reach receptive females. While
there is general agreement that fecundity selection increasing female size is quantitatively the most significant factor
that can explain the actual pattern of SSD in spiders
[7,13,16,17] our hypothesis helps to solve the controversial

Corcobado et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/236

question of what keeps the males small [5], and also contributes to explain the wide range of SSD in spiders, which
the fecundity hypothesis can not explain. Hence, extreme
SSD should always be expected in species that commonly
use bridging locomotion and in which females are large
and have a low need to disperse.

Methods
Spider collection

We collected adult male and female spiders in four different areas: Cabo de Gata and Punta Entinas (Almería,
South East Spain), Cadí-Moixeró Natural Park (Pyrenees, North East Spain) and Region of Villuercas-Ibores
(Extremadura, South West Spain) between May 2006
and May 2007. We selected our samples from the two
independent clades in which most of the examples of
extreme SSD are found, Orbiculariae and the family
Thomisidae within the RTA Clade [13]. Preliminary
data from a study including temperate spiders of about
58 genera and 21 families across the entire spider phylogeny (Agelenidae, Amaurobiidae, Dictynidae, Dysderidae,
Gnaphosidae, Linyphiidae, Lycosidae, Miturgidae, Oecobiidae, Oxyopidae, Philodromidae, Pholcidae, Pisauridae,
Salticidae, Sparassidae, Teraphosidae, Tetragnathidae,
Theridiidae, Thomisidae and Titanoecidae) show that
bridging locomotion has been detected only in one additional clade to those included here: the Dictynidae (Corcobado & Moya-Laraño unpublished data). The fact
that there is a considerable overlap between the clades
where most cases of extreme SSD are found and those
where bridging has been recorder so far, suggests a possible link between the distribution of bridging locomotion and that of extreme SSD across spiders. Within the
two selected clades, we chose our sample in order to
maximize phylogenetic diversity and to include those
taxa with a body shape (relationship between leg lengths
vs. body size) that suggested bridging locomotion [38].
In total, the dataset comprised a total of 204 individuals
from 13 species: Argiope bruennichi, Argiope lobata and
Argiope trifasciata (Araneidae), Tetragnatha montana,
Tegragnatha pinicola and Tetragnatha nigita. (Tetragnathidae), Neriene emphana and Tenuiphantes tenuis
(Linyphiidae), Latrodectus tredecimguttatus and Anelosimus aulicus (Theridiidae), Synaema globosum, Thomisus
onustus and Misumena vatia (Thomisidae). Our sample
of species covered a wide range of body sizes, including
almost the entire range for temperate web-building spiders [59]: Females - Carapace Width (CW) 0.7-7.02
mm, Body Mass 0.2-1846.6 mg; Males - CW 0.7-2.75
mm, Body Mass 0.3-44.8 mg.
Bridging trials

All spiders were kept in the laboratory in jars of variable
size adjusted to their own size until the trials were

Page 10 of 14

performed. All trials were performed at room temperature, during the day and within the next 24-72 hours
after the spiders had been collected. Temperature during
the bridging trials, time of day when the trials were run
and time elapsed since the spiders were captured had
no significant effect in our response variable and thus
we did not include them in further analyses. We followed the methods described in Moya-Laraño et al. [38]
to experimentally induce bridging in the laboratory, with
minor modifications to adapt the system to our larger
range of spider sizes. We placed a blowing fan 3.3 m
away from a plant fragment and released the spider on
top of a wire stand 27 cm height, which was located
between the plant and the fan (30 cm away from the
plant and 3 m away from the fan). The fan produced an
air flow with a speed of 0.6 - 0.8 m·s-1 blowing on the
top of the wire stand. All trials were recorded with a
video-camera for as long as 5 minutes. Our response
variable was whether the spider bridged or not. If spiders did not start releasing silk for a bridge within the
first 2 minutes, we induced spiders to do so by poking
them gently a few times with a paint brush. Trials were
finished when the spider reached the plant after a successful bridging or 3 minutes after we first poked them,
whatever came first. Of the 126 spiders that bridged, 61
needed to be poked before they started bridging. Notice
that this allowed us to be sure that all spiders were
motivated to bridge if they could do so. Thus, all spiders
were likely responding to a potential predatory threat,
the difference being that some of them responded
immediately upon handling and others needed to be
specially “threatened”. After trials were finished all the
spiders were weighed with a precision balance to the
nearest 0.1 mg or 0.01 mg (smaller spiders were
weighed with higher precision). The spiders collected in
Almería were weighed alive after the trials, and then
killed by freezing. The rest of the spiders were frozen
after the trials and carried to the laboratory to be
weighed as frozen individuals. Previously, we had verified that there was almost no difference between the
weight of alive or frozen spiders (Repeatability between
measurements - alive vs. frozen: R > 0.99; p < 0.001; n =
28). All spiders were preserved in 70% ETOH after
weighing. We measured the size of specimens (CW)
under a dissection microscope. All animals were measured by the same observer (GC) with high intra-observer repeatability: R = 0.94; p < 0.001; n = 20.
Statistical Analyses
Measurement of Sexual Size Dimorphism (SSD)

SSD was estimated from CW and body mass. CW is
fixed at maturation and does not change with the feeding status of the spider [reviewed in [12]], while body
mass is a more dimorphic and plastic character [e.g.

Corcobado et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/236

[12,60]] that needs to be investigated because some biomechanical properties of the spider silk suggest that
body mass is the trait that could constrain the ability to
bridge efficiently (Rodríguez-Gironés et al. unpublished
manuscript). We used the modified ratio index or SDI
[61] to measure SSD because of its good statistical properties [10]. This index is estimated by taking the ratio of
the larger to the smaller sex minus 1, and then assigning
a negative value if males are the larger sex, and a positive value if females are larger. The index takes a value
of 0 when there is no SSD.
Comparative Analysis

To analyze the data across species we used a type of
Generalized Least Squares (GLS) that incorporates phylogenetic relationships to correct for non-independence
due to common ancestry [62]. The GLS analysis was
implemented in R using the package PHYLOGR [63].
We rebuilt the phylogeny for the species included in
our data using published partial phylogenies [13,64-70].
We included polytomies when the available phylogeny
was not completely resolved. Because branch length is
unknown for most phylogenies we assigned all branches
the same arbitrary value of one. Phylogenies were drawn
using the PDTREE procedure within the statistical package PDAP [71] and then the phylogenetic distance
matrix was imported into PHYLOGR. Figure 2 shows
the phylogeny of our sample of species.
To illustrate the results of those analysis that only
involved one predictor variable we generated the independent contrasts (IC) following the method of Garland
et al. [71] using the package PDAP [71], -the statistical
package used here to run the GLS do not provide the
possibility to draw scatter plots in which points are corrected for phylogenetic distances-. The Method of IC
and the GLS are functionally identical [72], although the
former has lower statistical power when the phylogeny
includes some politomies (due to a decrease in the
degrees of freedom). In addition, GLS has the advantage
that it accommodates multiple independent variables.
The results of the analyses following the IC methods are
included in tables A2 and A5 of Additional file 1.
Because our sample size was very small for some species (See Table 1), we repeated the analysis excluding
the four species that had only one individual for either
sex. The results were qualitatively the same, with the pvalues only marginally significant for some of the analyses due to the smaller sample size (see tables B1, B2,
B3 of Additional file 3). Thus, our results are robust
despite the relatively small sample size for some of the
species used.
Testing prediction i): SSD explains the differences in
bridging propensity across taxa

In order to asses the robustness of our results we
applied two different approaches. First, we calculated

Page 11 of 14

the proportion of males and females that bridged for
each species, and then we used these data to calculate
a modified SDI index of bridging propensity (SDI bp ).
The modification was required because, in some species, the proportion of bridging females was equal to
zero, and the SDI index is undefined when the minimal value (the denominator) is zero. To avoid dividing
by zero we added one to the numerator and denominator of the quotient of the SDI index. We obtained
the average values of CW for each sex and species,
and then we calculated SDI using CW (SDI cw ). Similarly we used the average mass for each sex and species to calculate mass SDI (SDImass). We then ran two
GLS analyses using SDI bp as the dependent variable
and either SDIcw or SDImass as predictor variables. We
predicted a negative relationship between differential
bridging propensity and SSD. Note, that the prediction
is a negative relationship between SDIbp and SDIcw or
SDImass because SDIs are arbitrarily made negative
when males are the larger sex. Thus, when the SDIcw
and SDImass are large and positive (large females), the
SDIbp is predicted to be large and negative (males
bridge more than females). In the second approach we
followed the method used by De Mas et al. [58], which
is an adaptation of Smith’s suggestion for analyzing
SSD through multiple regression using log-transformed
variables and introducing statistical control [73]. As we
did in the previous analysis, we introduced the average
for each sex and species in the multiple regression
model. Thus, we ran a GLS comparative analysis in
which we included female bridging propensity as the
dependent variable and female body size, male body
size, and male bridging propensity as independent variables. All the variables were log-transformed using natural logarithms, although for bridging propensity we
calculated the logarithm of one plus the proportion of
bridging individuals (since, as mentioned above, bridging propensity included zeros). We predicted that
female body size, statistically controlled in the model
for male body size, would show a negative relationship
with female bridging propensity, which was statistically
controlled for male bridging propensity by including
this variable on the right hand side of the model. As
the prediction is for a negative relationship, all statistical tests were one-tailed. We used partial regression
plots to graphically display the results of the multiple
GLS analyses [74].
Testing prediction ii): There is a negative relationship
between body size and bridging propensity

First, we tested whether body size (CW) or body mass
explains the propensity to bridge separately for males
and females. We then combined males and females in
the same analysis and tested for an interaction between
sex and body size. To perform this analysis we add at

Corcobado et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/236

the tip of the main phylogeny an additional node with
two branches, one for each sex (sex was coded as follows: males 0, females 1). For each sex we used the
average of either CW or body mass as independent
variables and the proportion of bridging individuals as
the dependent variable. All the variables were logtransformed using the natural logarithm, but as above,
for bridging propensity we added one to the raw value
before log-transformation. Again, as the prediction is
for a negative relationship, all statistical tests were
one-tailed.
To calculate the threshold size above which spiders
did not bridge we performed generalized linear models
with binomial error and logit link functions using
“size” (body mass or CW) as the predictor and occurrence or non- occurrence of bridging as the dependent
variable. The predicted regression equations were then
used to calculate the size beyond which the probability
of bridging was very low (<0.05). To obtain confidence
intervals for this threshold size, for each measure of
size (body mass or CW), we generated 1000 logistic
equations by randomly generating the equation parameters (slope and intercept). For each randomly generated equation, the values of the intercept and the slope
were independent realizations of normally distributed
random variables, with mean and standard deviation
given by the expected value and standard error of the
corresponding parameter in the original (data-driven)
regression equation. The size (body mass or CW) for
which the simulated logistic equation predicted a probability of bridging of 0.05 was stored for each of the
1000 runs, thus providing 1000 estimates of the
threshold size. Eliminating the 2.5% highest and lowest
values, we obtained the 95% confidence intervals for
these parameters. Because we know of no method to
include binomial errors in the evolutionary comparative method, this analysis did not include a correction
for phylogenetic relatedness and treated individual spiders as independent data points. Although this analysis
was not used for hypothesis testing, we realize that not
correcting for phylogenetic relationships could substantially affect parameter estimation. However, a
recent study using a very similar approach [31] showed
that the calculation of optimal climbing speed in spiders changed very little regardless of whether phylogenetic correction was applied or not. Thus, here we
assume that parameters would also change little (or at
least not meaningfully) if we had applied a phylogenetic correction.
