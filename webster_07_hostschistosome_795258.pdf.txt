Abstract
Background: That pathogens and hosts coevolve is a powerful concept with broad theoretical
and applied implications spanning from genetic theory to the medical and veterinary sciences,
particularly in the context of infectious disease epidemiology. A substantial body of theory has been
developed to explore the likelihood and consequences of coevolution, but few empirical studies
have been conducted to test these theories, particularly for indirectly-transmitted pathogen-host
systems. We initiated replicate longitudinal host-schistosome co-selection trials under different
host genotype combinations: Schistosoma mansoni parasite lines were co-selected with populations
of either previously resistant-selected Biomphalaria glabrata host genotypes, or unselected
susceptible B. glabrata genotypes, or a mixed population of the two. All parasite lines were also
passaged through their obligatory mammalian definitive host at each generation.
Results: We demonstrated variation in, and a reciprocal impact on, the fitness of both host and
pathogen phenotype and genotype, an outcome dependent on the combinations of genotypes
involved, and evidence of change over time. Most apparent was the observation that parasites
appeared to rapidly adapt to those intermediate hosts previously selected for resistance.
Conclusion: Our results illustrate the potential for host-schistosome coevolution and, in
particular, suggest that host resistance may be a temporary phenomenon in nature due, in part, to
rapid counter-adaptations by parasites.

Background
Host-parasite coevolution is driven by the reciprocal evolution of host resistance [1] and parasite infectivity and/or
virulence [2] (see Appendix for definitions). Coevolution
maintains polymorphisms at relevant loci [3,4] and has
important repercussions for traits such as host-parasite
compatibility, range and virulence [5]. Understanding
how pathogens respond to evolved changes in host characteristics may also provide a good model for their all too

apparent potential to respond to other kinds of selective
pressures, such as the use of new drugs or vaccines to combat disease [6,7]. A substantial body of theory has been
developed to explore the likelihood and consequences of
coevolution. Classic theories, such as that of the Red
Queen Hypothesis [8-11], provide a conceptual underpinning to discussions of biological evolutionary arms races
or reciprocal change. However, direct tests of coevolution
remain elusive and empirical evidence of host-parasite

coevolution is rarely available, particularly for vertebrate
host-parasite populations [12]. Some have taken this to
suggest that either host-pathogen coevolution does not
occur or that it is not important [13,14]. Others, in contrast, have suggested that in order to detect coevolution we
must improve our techniques for how to look for it [12].
Host-parasite coevolution requires additive genetic variation in the relevant host and parasite traits, reciprocal
effects on the fitness traits of the two populations, and a
dependence of the outcome of the host-parasite interaction on the combinations of genotypes involved. Whilst
evidence for each is required to demonstrate the potential
for coevolution, demonstrating that coevolution is actually occurring requires evidence of change, whether directional or non-directional, in both host and parasite [12].
Coevolution may be expected to be most apparent where
a specialist parasite exerts a strong selection pressure on its
host as well as vice versa, where the relevant host and parasite traits have high heritability, and where parasite and
host generation times are short. Many of these requirements are met in Schistosoma spp. (Platyhelminthes; Trematoda), at least within the snail-schistosome-rodent
system, and hence may provide us with a useful model for
examining potential coevolutionary interactions and
thereby an insight into the genetics of adaptation in general. Schistosomes are the causative agent of schistosomiasis, a macroparasitic disease of profound medical and
veterinary importance, with some 600 million people
exposed and 200 million infected at any time throughout
the tropical world [15]. Schistosoma spp. have an indirect
lifecycle involving obligatory alternation of generations
between mammalian definitive and molluscan intermediate hosts. Transmission between hosts occurs via freeswimming larval stages, miracidia (infective to the mollusc) and cercariae (infective to the mammal). Prevalence
and transmission of schistosome infections in natural
populations is highly variable across space and time
[16,17]. Although the precise genetic or molecular mechanisms have not yet been identified, snail resistance and
susceptibility, and schistosome virulence and infectivity,
have each been demonstrated to have heritable, strainspecific bases [16,18], and variability for each trait maintained through a range of cost-benefit trade-offs [16,19].
The aim of the current study was to initiate, to our knowledge, the first experimental co-selection investigation to
determine the potential for coevolution in an indirectlytransmitted animal macroparasite system [12]. In order to
test whether snails and their schistosomes have the potential to coevolve we designed a longitudinal co-selection
laboratory study under a combination of differing host
genotype pressures. Replicate lines of Biomphalaria glabrata were set up consisting of snails either previously artificially-selected over multiple generations for increased

resistance to Schistosoma mansoni infection (R-lines), or
unselected susceptible lines (U-lines), or mixed 'populations' of both resistant-selected and unselected host genotypes together (R:U-lines). Due to the higher selective
pressure imposed upon parasites passaged through the
already resistant-selected host lines (R), such parasites
may be predicted to demonstrate faster reciprocal change
or adaptation than those passaged through the initially
unselected hosts (U). In contrast, in terms of the hosts, we
may predict faster change within the unselected (U) snails
than in their previously resistant-selected (R) counterparts. As natural snail meta-populations show heterogeneity in resistant and susceptible genotypes [17], and
because theoretical predictions have suggested that it may
be slower for parasites to evolve counter-adaptations as
heterogeneity in host resistance is enhanced [20], the
mixed (R:U) line was set up here to present a potentially
more epidemiologically and evolutionary realistic experimental simulation.
Uniquely amongst selection studies [4,6,21,22], the current design also encompassed more than one host species,
where all schistosomes were exposed to the contrasting
pressures of both their co-selected invertebrate intermediate host species and their obligatory mammalian (mouse)
definitive host species at each generation. This is important because having a life cycle involving two or more
obligatory host species has been predicted to constrain a
parasite's ability to coevolve with either host [23,24].
Alternatively, as schistosomes have been demonstrated to
display potential fitness compensatory responses through
differential between-host-species transmission and establishment dynamics [23,25], one may predict any observed
changes in parasite infectivity, or virulence, to the coselected intermediate host here may also influence these
traits at the definitive host stage. Therefore, despite the
inherently increased logistical demands and potential to
decrease the likelihood of clearly observing coevolution
[23,24], inclusion of a definitive host stage within our
experimental design further helps ensure the data gathered are biologically realistic and generalizable to the natural situation.
A further quality unique to the current study was that the
reciprocal impact of host and parasite was investigated
from both a phenotypic and genotypic perspective. Microsatellite DNA has a high mutation rate, between 10-4 to 5
× 10-6, thus mutational changes can be detected over a
short time period, making them, together with their neutrality, co-dominant expression and allelism, an ideal
molecular tool for such studies. If host and parasite genotype have a reciprocal impact upon each other, we may
predict that these neutral molecular markers would reveal
patterns of population differentiation inparasitesand/or
their co-selected hosts over generation, consistent with

that observed at the phenotype level. Furthermore, even
within generation one may predict differences in allele
frequencies between lines. This may be expected to be
most apparent within the parasite, rather than host, lines
here due to differential success in penetrating and establishing within different host genotypes, according to their
resistance status, in addition to any subsequent mutation
[26,27].

Within the intermediate host
Within the co-selection study, parasite infection rate (parasite infectivity and/or host susceptibility) was higher in
the U snail lines than in their R or R:U counterparts overall (F2,37 = 9.2, p = 0.0006). There was, however, evidence
of a significant interaction between selection line and gen-

Our study is thus believed to represent one of the first
experimental co-selection investigations in an animal-parasite system, specifically that for an indirectly-transmitted
macroparasite [12]. Through demonstration of variation
in, and a reciprocal impact on, the fitness of both host and
parasite phenotype and genotype, combined with evidence of change over time, most apparent within those
parasites co-selected with resistant snail genotypes, the
current study provides an important stepping stone in
demonstrating the potential for host-schistosome counter-adaptation and coevolution.

Results

Breeding

Finally, the current study also incorporated cross-infections between selected parasite lines with novel host lines
at each generation, aimed to disentangle any potential
change in parasite characteristics independent of host factors and/or to detect the strain-specificity of any response
[16]. For the former, one may predict any phenotype, such
as a change in infection rates in co-selected snails over
time, if displayed also in novel snails exposed to the same
parasite, would indicate a predominantly parasite-focused
trait change. In contrast, a lack of associated phenotype in
novel snails may indicate a predominantly host-focused
change amongst the co-selected snails. However, any
strain-specificity inherent in this system may equally be
likely to reduce or mask any such host-parasite differentiation. Strain specificity, where any phenotypic trait is displayed only within the host-parasite co-selected
combination, is a fundamental assumption of many coevolutionary models and theories, including that of frequency dependent or Red-Queen coevolution [8-11], and
may account for the greater compatibility amongst many
sympatric snail-schistosome populations in the field [28].
Such strain-specificity, where selected snails were exposed
to novel parasites and/or selected parasites were exposed
to novel snails, has been documented within previous
experimental studies on each of host resistance and susceptibility and parasite infection intensity, infectivity and
virulence traits in this snail-schistosome system
[16,18,29]. Therefore whilst cross-infection experiments
serve as an important complement to the major co-selection experimental design, alone, due to any inherent
strain-specificity, they would not be sufficient to test for
the potential for host-parasite coevolution in this system.

addition to the preceding approx 2.4 years continuous snail

Within the cross-infection study (parasite lines from the
co-selection study exposed to novel control snails), a similar pattern to that within the co-selected lines was
observed: there was also evidence of a significant interaction between selection line and generation (F2,28 = 5.31, p
= 0.01), where parasite infection rate increased with generation in the R lines, and to some extent in the R:U lines,
while declining with generation for the U snail lines (Figure 3a). There was, however, no significant difference
between lines over time in terms of parasite virulence to
these novel snails (Figure 3b).

Within the definitive host
In the definitive host, the impact of both line and generation was as apparent as that observed in the co-selected
intermediate hosts. Infectivity tended to increase through
the generations (F1,36 = 3.91, p = 0.06) and, although there
was no statistical evidence for a line × generation interaction, the slope was steepest for those parasites passaged
through R snails (Figure 4a). Overall, infectivity to the
mouse was also significantly lower in parasites passaged
through the R snail lines than from either R:U or U snails
(the mean proportions of worms establishing in mice
across all generations (with SEMs) were R = 0.19(0.02),
RU = 0.27(0.02), U = 0.32(0.02); F2,36 = 5.25, p = 0.010).

rate increased significantly with generation in the R lines
(F1,10 = 4.33, p = 0.04), and to some extent in the R:U
lines, while declining non-significantly with generation
for the U snail lines. In other words, whilst snail infection
prevalence was significantly highest amongst U line hostparasite combinations at the start of the co-selection study
(F2,8 = 5.23, p = 0.03), this trait was reversed by the final
generation with highest infection prevalence observed in
the R-line host-parasite combinations (Figure 2a - see fig
1 for coding).
Virulence, in terms of snail mortality, also showed a different trajectory over time between lines (line × generation interaction term: F2,55 = 2.7, p = 0.07), where snail
mortality declined significantly with generation through
the R lines (F1,18 = 5.13, p = 0.04), but showed no trend for
the other two lines (Figure 2b).

Parasite virulence within the definitive host, in terms of
hepatosplenomegaly, did not differ in response to the
selection status of the intermediate host through which
they had been passaged, nor did it show a trend with generation (Figure 4b).
Genotypic change in host and parasite
Molecular analyses also provided support for an impact of
host on parasite genotype and, to some extent, vice versa.
The Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
Mean (UPGMA) phenogram for parasites generated using
co-ancestry identity revealed clustering based on generation and on line (Figure 5a). Indeed, within each of the
increasing co-selected F1-F3 generations, the parasites coselected through the R snail lines consistently clustered
separately from the R:U and U-lines, with the F3 generation being most different, suggesting an impact of selection rather than random genetic differentiation. As for the
intermediate hosts, whilst there was no clear clustering
pattern between lines by generation, within each generation the R snail lines also tended to cluster separately from
the R:U and U-lines, particularly by the F3 generation
(Figure 5b). Comparison of Fst estimates between the first
and final generations for both the intermediate host and
parasite lines revealed greater genetic variation within parasite (P1:RF3-0.74; P1:RUF3-0.63; P1:UF3-0.65) than
within the intermediate host (P1:RF3, P1:RUF3; P1:UF3all values <0.001). Indeed, all the Fst values obtained here
were significant (P < 0.01) suggesting great differentiation

one or two generations of selection [16,18,30], the current
host-parasite co-selection experiments demonstrate a subsequent reciprocal change in both host and parasite populations. Further indication of evolution in host resistance
may be suggested here as the decrease in infection prevalence over generation, and hence potential increased
resistance to infection, within the originally unselected
(U) snail lines (Figure 2a). Indication that S. mansoni can
rapidly counter-adapt to such differential host genotype
pressures was observed here as the phenotypic and genotypic changes evident in parasite lines, expressed to both
intermediate and definitive host, co-selected with the
originally resistant-selected (R) snails (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5).
Such rapid counter-adaptations, in addition to the previously documented strain-specificity [16,18] and high
costs of resistance inherent in this system [31], are thereby
consistent with a transient nature and lack of fixation of
resistant
genotypes
in
natural
populations
[8,11,12,31,32]. Indeed, over a greater number of coselected generations, one may well predict cycling
between host resistance and parasite infectivity in this system.

the intermediate host (very low differentiation). Random
genetic drift alone could not explain such consistent differences between co-selection lines and/or the coherent
association between the genotype data with that of the
phenotypic traits observed as demonstrated in this study.

Discussion
The results presented here provide empirical support to
suggest the potential for host-schistosome coevolution,
and in particular that consistent with Red Queen coevolution [8-11] where hosts must continually evolve in order
to achieve transient resistance to coevolving parasites
tracking them. Complementary to the previously published host-only selection experiments, which demonstrated that B. glabrata genotypes resistant or susceptible
to S. mansoni can increase in frequency in response to just

Further potential for polymorphism in natural populations may be suggested here by the corresponding
decrease in virulence observed amongst R-lines as infectivity increased over generation (Figures 2a &2b). Such patterns may be explicable, in part, by a relatively higher
individual infection dose and subsequent intra-host parasite competition within those comparatively few infected
P1 R-line snails. High parasite exposure doses and intrahost competition levels are both factors previously demonstrated to be associated with high virulence to these
snails [16,33,34]. As parasite infectivity increased and/or
snail resistance decreased in subsequent generations
within these R-lines, a relatively greater proportion of
snails would be infected at a presumably correspondingly
lower individual parasite dose (as the total mass miracidial exposure dose per line remained constant over time),
and hence intra-host competition and subsequent virulence would be reduced [35]. An alternative, not mutually
exclusive explanation, may relate to the high costs to the
host inherent within their immune defence, where a lack
of mounting such a response would result in the observed
increasing parasite establishment and declining host virulence over time amongst these R-lines [36]. However, the
lack of any consistent corresponding change in virulence
over time amongst the U-lines (Figure 2b &3b), despite an
apparent change in parasite infectivity (Figures 2a &3a),
may suggest other factors too may be involved in this
host-parasite relationship. This latter may also provide
further evidence to suggest that infectivity does not appear
to equal virulence in this snail-schistosome system
[16,25], although it remains to be ascertained as to which
trait may have the greater genetic variability. It should be

acknowledged, nevertheless, that the potential strength of
selective pressure on evolution of virulence in the current
experimental design may by constrained to a minimum,
in contrast to the selective pressures imposed here on parasite infectivity and snail host resistance/susceptibility.
Parasite exposure dose was relatively low in order to
ensure sufficient snails survived to breed the next coselected generations. Intra-host parasite competition, as
mentioned above, would be subsequently minimized in
most snail lines. Likewise, parasite exposure dose together
with infection duration was also kept to a tightly controlled minimum within the definitive hosts, and all rodents
were euthansed before parasite-induced morbidity/virulence should have developed. Such protocols were performed for ethical reasons. If higher parasite doses for
intermediate and definitive hosts, and/or longer durations of infection in the latter, one may well predict

Of course there are many more complexities both host
and parasite will be exposed to under natural settings,
including constraints imposed by simultaneous interactions with multiple hosts or multiple parasite species and
strains. Indeed, theoretical predictions have suggested
that it may be much more difficult and slower for parasites to evolve counter-adaptations as heterogeneity in
host resistance is enhanced [20], and in accordance with
this the reciprocal impact appeared reduced within the
mixed R:U lines in the current study (Figures 2a &2b). Yet
this is not to suggest that such adaptation and counteradaptation cannot occur, even under highly heterogeneous natural conditions. Furthermore, increased heterogeneity has also been proposed to increase the likelihood for
coevolution in some cases, where for example, host
defence against genetically heterogeneous parasite infections may require more resources to be effective and thus
may result in increased pressure for the evolution of host
resistance and/or parasite infectivity [37-39]. Likewise,
whilst having a life cycle involving two or more obligatory
host species has been predicted to constrain a parasite's
ability to coevolve with either host [23,24], one could
conversely suspect it may be less costly for the parasite to
adapt towards the definitive host here, as this represents
the more constant host genotype, in contrast to the potential reciprocally changing intermediate host. The apparent
increase in parasite infectivity to the intermediate host
with generation in the R-line (Figure 2a and 3a) did
appear to be reflected here in the definitive host stage (Figure 4a). It is plausible that a similar scenario may occur
within natural host-schistosome interactions, particularly
considering the longer generations of the definitive host,
either human or rodent, relative to the snail.
Such elucidation of the evolutionary dynamics of such
schistosomes and their hosts holds considerable applied
significance for their control and management. For example, one theoretically proposed snail-mediated control
strategy, the genetic control theory (GCT) for schistosomiasis, contends that it is possible to reduce the size of
schistosome populations by genetic manipulation of the
snail intermediate host [40-42]. The technique advocates
collection of resistant snails from natural populations,
artificially selecting for resistance within the laboratory
and returning descendants to the site of disease transmission. The theory rests on the central assumptions that
resistant snails will have an evolutionary fitness advantage
over their susceptible-infected counterparts, thus spreading the genes for resistance through the population, and
that the resultant genetic perturbation due to the increase
in resistant snails will be too great for the schistosome

population to adjust co-evolutionarily [40]. In contrast,
the apparently rapid counter-response in terms of
increased parasite infectivity to, and/or increased susceptibility of, those previously resistant-selected snails
observed here (Figures 2a &3a), combined with the previously documented strain-specificity and high costs of
resistance inherent in this system [16,18], would appear
to mitigate against the predicted success of such a control
measure. Likewise, one may suspect that the essentially
transient and strain-specific nature of the virulence traits
observed here could constrain any potential likelihood of
manipulation of schistosome virulence for public health
ends [43].

particular those aimed to identify reciprocal polymorphisms in genes involved in the host-pathogen interaction, for both host-schistosomes and many other
theoretically and clinically important host-pathogen systems. Not surprisingly perhaps, where considerable
progress has been made in these areas, convincing evidence of potential host-pathogen coevolution and counter-adaptation is beginning to appear. For instance,
reciprocal molecular polymorphisms between the human
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and malaria
CS genes in West African populations have been identified
and the co-distributions of pathogen and host genotypes
are consistent with selection pressures exerted on each
other [44]. Likewise, one explanation for the reduced virulence of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in sooty
manabeys is that this and closely related species have
evolved mechanisms to silence the CCR5 receptor [45].
Suggestive of a coevolutionary arms race, there is then evidence of subsequent SIV counter-adaptation to CCR5
inhibition, where red-capped mangabeys harbour SIV
strains that utilize CCR2 instead of CCR5 [46,47]. Recent
research may even suggest that the human immune
response is also already driving adaptation of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and, at the same time, the
virus is driving evolution of human immune genes [48].
Researchers have observed that, in a small proportion of
infected people, the virus is successfully controlled by the
immune system. It appears that the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) principally involved in killing HIVinfected cells are recognising fragments of viral proteins
presented on HLA-B molecules, and that these are the
immune responses against which HIV is adapting the fastest. Similarly, the success of the immune response in controlling HIV infection, and therefore the speed of
progression to AIDS, is primarily determined by the particular HLA-B genes expressed by each individual. Such
data thereby suggest an explanation for the more rapid
evolution of HLA-B. We anticipate that, as further analytical tools are developed, further evidence indicative of
host-pathogen coevolution will appear across a whole
range of systems, even for comparably long lived and
complicated host-parasite interactions such as that of the
indirectly-transmitted macroparasite system examined
here. Moreover, we suspect that the subset of host genes
involved in coevolutionary interactions will turn out to be
of particular biomedical importance, since they are likely
to be major determinants of susceptibility, infectivity and
virulence and should provide insights not only into the
ways that host and pathogen adapt and counter-adapt
but, perhaps more importantly, into the constraints which
prevent either 'winning' the evolutionary battle outright.

Conclusion
There does remain, nevertheless, a need to develop and
apply new, more powerful tools and methodologies, in

To conclude, the results obtained here do, at least under
the tightly controlled constraints of this experimental set-

ting, demonstrate the potential for host-schistosome
coevolution, even within as little as 3–4 generations. At
the same time, the current study serves to highlight both
the complexities and considerations inherent in any
attempt to achieve empirical evidence of host-parasite
coevolution in action, particularly in complex animal-parasite systems [12]. Yet, an understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of such parasites holds considerable
significance for their control and management, and this
study should, at very least, help motivate further experimental and theoretical investigation of coevolution in this
fascinating indirectly-transmitted system and beyond. The
impact of host-pathogen coevolution on host genetics,
immunology and disease epidemiology is only beginning
to be better understood, and an interdisciplinary
approach will be imperative to progress this exciting area,
especially in today's environment of emerging and novel
infections.

Methods
Host and parasite lines
Here we focus on co-selection between the parasite S.
mansoni and its intermediate host B. glabrata (the natural
host within the New World and parts of Africa), with mice
(CBA/CA; Harlan Olak UK, Ltd) serving as the definitive
host (since both humans and rodents act as natural definitive hosts for S. mansoni within Africa and the New
World) [17].

Artificial selection, carefully controlling against any
potential inbreeding or maternal-effect bias, was used to
breed B. glabrata snail lines that were resistant-selected,
susceptible-selected, or unselected, toward S. mansoni
infection, as has been described in detail elsewhere [18].
There were highly significant differences between snail
lines in the % infection prevalence following exposure to
five miracidia by the F1 generation (log-linear analysis: χ2
= 93.83, d.f. = 2, P = 0.001) and this difference remained

significant in all subsequent generations (F1 to the F6 generation used here).
Co-selection experimental design (Figure 1)
Replicate groups of 20 adult (as determined by the onset
of egg laying) size- and age-matched B. glabrata containing graded proportions of previously resistant-selected
and unselected snail lines were placed in tanks (30 cm ×
15 cm × 10 cm); four tanks contained 20 resistant-selected
snails (100% Resistant 'R'), four contained 10 resistantand 10 unselected snails (50% Resistant: Unselected
'R:U') and four tanks contained 20 unselected snails
(100% Unselected 'U'). Snails for each line/tank were
mass exposed to a maximum of 100 miracidial dose
(mean of 5 per snail), from a previously unselected laboratory S. mansoni line. Using mass rather than individual
exposure here allows the miracidia to 'choose' the snails
to infect, which may also be more comparable to the natural situation. At week 7 post-exposure, S. mansoni cercariae from all infected snails within each group were
harvested, pooled and used to infect four mice (CBA/CA;
Harlan Olak UK, Ltd) per group replicate, at a dose of 220
cercariae, by allowing the animal's feet to paddle freely for
60 minutes in 100 ml of infected water. The mice were
kept for 6–8 weeks in order to allow the schistosomes to
mature to adults, and for the females to become gravid
and to start producing viable eggs. Following this period,
before the mice showed signs of illness, they were euthanized with an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide.
The liver and spleen were removed, macerated through a
sieve, and placed in 80 ml deionised water under a 100
watt light in order to stimulate hatching. For the F1 generation, a randomly selected group of 20 size- and agematched offspring from each parental snail line was
moved to a fresh tank and exposed to the corresponding
miracidia harvested from the mice infected with the parasites obtained from the parental lines, such that each parasite line was co-selected with the snail line through

which it had been passaged. The parasite dose remained
the same through generations. Subsequently, cercariae
shed by snails from all the F1 experimental groups were
pooled, within co-selection line, and used to infect four
more adult mice, as described above. This procedure was
repeated across four generations in total (P1-F3).
In order to follow the potential genotypic changes in
response to co-selection, 20 worms (10 male: 10 female),
and 10 snails, were randomly selected from each line per
P1-F3 generation and their population genetic structure
analysed using six of the recently characterised microsatellite markers for S. mansoni [49] and 8 of the microsatellite
markers for B. glabrata [50] (Table 1) . Total genomic DNA
from ethanol preserved snails was extracted by using their
foot tissue and a modified phenol-chloroform extraction
protocol followed by purification with GeneClean II kit.
Genomic DNA from individual schistosomes was
extracted using phenol-chloroform extraction and purified using GeneClean II kit. PCR was performed using
published primers with the 5' end of the forward primer
for each locus fluorescently labelled using 6-FAM, NED or
TET dye (Applied Biosystems), and amplification on a
PTC-200 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research). Amplifications
were performed in 40 μl reactions with 10 ng of genomic
DNA, 5 pmoles of each primer, 1 unit of Taq polymerase,
4 μl of reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 50 mM
KCl, 0.1% Triton®X-100; Promega), 0.4 mM dNTPmix
(Sigma) and 1.5–2.5 mM MgCl2 (Promega). Thermal
cycling was conducted under the following conditions: 5
minutes at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 seconds at
94°C, 1 min at locus-specific annealing temperature, 1
min at 72°C, with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min.
Products were diluted in N, N'- dimethyl formamide with
GeneScan ®-500 [ROX] (ABI), electrophoresed using a ABI
377 sequencer; and sized using GENESCAN software v3.7
(PE Applied Biosystems) and Genotyper v 3.7(PE Applied
Biosystems).
Cross-infection experimental design
Cross-infections between selected parasite lines with
novel host lines were performed at each selection generation, aimed to disentangle any potential change in parasite characteristics independent of host factors and/or to
detect the strain-specificity of any response [16]. At each
generation an additional set of replicate tanks of 10 novel
size- and age-matched novel control snails (i.e. snails not
co-selected with the parasite here, but those from a separate unselected laboratory stock line, referred to as Novel
control (n) snails here) were exposed, at a matched dose,
to the same parasite line (p) as the experimental coselected snails.

Life-history data
Intermediate host life-history parameters were recorded
for each line replicate at weekly intervals including (i) Parasite infectivity to the snail and/or snail resistance or susceptibility to the parasite was measured as the percentage
of patent snails, i.e. those shedding cercariae, within each
snail group [25], and (ii) Virulence was measured as the
number of breeding adults remaining from the original
matched snail population in each tank after 15 weeks, i.e.
snail mortality.

Definitive host life-history parameters were recorded
where adult schistosomes were recovered from each
mouse using a modified hepatic perfusion technique. (i)
Parasite infectivity was calculated as the number of worms
successfully established within the definitive host following a matched 220 cercarial exposure dose [23,35] and (ii)
virulence to infected mice was measured as the weight of
the liver and spleen as a percentage of total body weight,
as the major pathological effect of S. mansoni infection in
definitive hosts results from granuloma formation causing hepatosplenomegaly [51].
Statistical analyses
Evidence of phenotypic differences in all parameters
between lines and across generations (where the co-selection data were analysed separately from the cross-infection study data) was investigated using a general linear
modelling procedure (GLM procedure) applied with the
SAS Software v.8 (SAS Inst. 1999). Dependent variables
were transformed as necessary (log, square-root or arcsine-root as appropriate) to meet the model assumptions
of normality of error and homogeneity of variance. Selection line (R, R:U and U) was used as a categoric independent variable. Generation (P1-F3) was treated as a
continuous variable. Intermediate host dependent variables included i) infection prevalence (parasite infectivity
to/resistance in the snail) and ii) mortality (virulence).
Similarly i) infectivity and ii) virulence to the mouse were
used as dependent variables for the definitive host.
Throughout, as there were replicates and all three lines of
snail occur within each, these effects were therefore
crossed (in contrast to nested, where one variable is nested
within another when the levels of that first variable occur
only within one level of the second variable, classically
when experimental subjects are assigned randomly to one
or more levels of an experimental treatment, and hence
not the design applied here). Non-independence attributable to multiple measurements on different replicates was
therefore dealt with by treating 'replicate' as a fixed blocking factor. Inferences about the effects of interest are therefore confined to these replicates, and not generalised to a
wider population of replicates that might have been used.
Although treating each of the two replicates as a subject in
this way yields a design where inferences cannot be gener-

alized to a wider population of potential replicates, this
does not weaken the value of the data we present with
respect to the replicates observed [52]. As our effect sizes
are clearly presented, and with appropriate metrics of
their precision, we have chosen not to incorporate Bonferroni correction procedures here to control type-1 error
rate; such procedures are increasingly viewed as unhelpful
[53-56].

Molecular analyses
As a measure of genetic distance between populations, a
matrix of co-ancestry coefficients was estimated in Arlequin 2.0 [57], which considers pair-wise distance, population size and divergence time. In order to demonstrate
visually the similarity of individuals or populations,
UPGMA clustering (a sequential clustering algorithm, in
which local topological relationships are identified in
order of similarity, and the phylogenetic tree is built in a
stepwise manner) was then performed on all population
samples based on these pair-wise co-ancestry data. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [58] was used to
quantify intra- and inter-population variability which calculates Wright's F-statistics, e.g. Fst measures which reflect
the genetic differentiation between different samples [59],
suggest the following qualitative guidelines for the interpretation of Fst genetic differentiation: 0–0.05 'little';
0.05–0.15 'moderate'; 0.15–0.25 'great'; and > 0.25 indicate 'very great' genetic differentiation. The significance of
departure from 0 for Fst was tested by randomising alleles
between individuals in each sample (15000 permutations) and the significance level was set at P < 0.01.
