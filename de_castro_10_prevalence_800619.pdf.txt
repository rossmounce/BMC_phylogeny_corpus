Abstract
Background: BED-EIA HIV-1 Incidence Test (BED-CEIA) has been described as a tool to discriminate recent (RS)
from long-term (LTS) seroconversion of HIV-1 infection, contributing to a better understanding of the dynamics of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic over time. This study determined the prevalence, estimated incidence and HIV-1 subtype
infection among individuals seeking testing in Voluntary Counseling and Testing centers (VCTs) from Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil.
Methods: Demographics and behavioral data were obtained from 434 individuals, diagnosed as HIV-positive
among 9,008 volunteers screened from November 2004 to October 2005 in three VCTs located in the Rio de
Janeiro Metropolitan area, Brazil. BED-CEIA protocol was performed to identify RS. DNA samples from RS and a
subset of LTS (under a proportion of 1:2) were selected for gp120 C2-V3 and pol (protease and reverse
transcriptase) regions genomic sequencing.
Results: Overall HIV-1 prevalence was 4.8%. Sixty-one of 434 seropositive individuals were classified as RS,
corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.68%/year (95%CI 1.26% -2.10%). Estimated incidence between Men Who
Have Sex with Men (MSM) was 11 times higher than among heterosexual men and 55% of the new cases were
identified in volunteers aged 25-40 years. A similar distribution of different HIV-1 subtypes was found among RS
and LTS.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that prevention for MSM remains a challenge and efforts focusing on prevention
targeting this population should be prioritized. No significant changes in HIV-1 subtypes were observed among the
RS and LTS subgroups. One case of HIV-1 AUK (pol)/A (env) recombinant genome was detected for the first time
in Brazil.

Background
The HIV pandemic continues to spread unabated, with
about 33.4 million people living with HIV worldwide.
Globally, approximately 2.7 million new infections are
believed to occur in 2008 [1]. Hosting the largest HIV-1
infected population in Latin America, Brazil has a complex HIV-1 epidemic characterized by an increase of
women participation over time, a pronounced decrease

among injecting drug users and persisting high-risk
behaviors and a higher proportion of new infections
among gay and bisexual men [2]. Approximately
620,000 individuals aged 15 to 49 years old are estimated to be infected with HIV in Brazil. According to
the former National AIDS Program (recently renamed
as the Department of STD, AIDS and Viral hepatitis)
544,846 AIDS cases were reported from 1980 to June
2009. Rio de Janeiro is the second Brazilian state in
terms of number of reported AIDS cases, corresponding
to 14% of the overall national AIDS cases [3]. Sentinel

studies in pregnant women estimate an overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection of 0.61% [4]. Serology for HIV
infection is available at no cost in the Voluntary Counseling and Testing centers VCTs) all over the country,
where the volunteers have full access to prevention
activities and individual counseling.
In Brazil, twenty years ago, facilities offering voluntary
counseling and testing (VCT) at not cost at the point of
delivery were established as a key strategy to promote
the access of the Brazilian population to early diagnosis
and prevention of HIV and others sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) and to stimulate agile referral to treatment. Such VCT centers became a central piece of Brazil’s initiative to curb the epidemic over the years and
nowadays comprise a comprehensive network of over
380 public health facilities spread all over the country.
In cities with VCT centers, the number of HIV tests per
1,000 people is 2.4 times higher than in the localities
where there is no VCT center. At present, in Rio de
Janeiro state, 13 VCT centers are fully operative - eight
of them located in the metropolitan area [5].
In order to better understand recent epidemiological
trends in HIV transmission it is key to estimate incidence and to assess viral diversity among recently
infected individuals. Serological differentiation between
recent (RS) and long-term seroconverters (LTS) has
been described as a powerful tool to track the trends of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic [6]. A variety of approaches
have been described over time [7,8]. One of those assays
is based on the capture and detection of increasing proportions of HIV-1 IgG in the serum over the time
(BED-CEIA) that uses a branched peptide based on
gp41 of B, D and E HIV-1 subtypes [9,10]. Due to some
concerns that have emerged in scenarios with high HIV
prevalence and/or viral diversity [11], two correction
strategies/factors were proposed to minimize the putative overestimation of incidence rates using BED-CEIA.
One of them proposes the exclusion of certain specimens on clinical grounds, by relying on trend differences rather than absolute incidence estimates, using
secondary confirmatory testing or adjustments for misclassification [12]. The second correction factor adjusts
the findings in order to avoid misclassification of subtype C infected individuals [13].
Brazil is a huge country presenting heterogeneous
HIV/AIDS epidemiological trends [3] and virological
scenarios, with distinct HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant
infections [14] in different regions and/or population
strata. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and to estimate incidence of HIV-1 infection
among individuals seeking HIV testing in VCT centers
located in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan area, as well
as to track HIV diversity among RS and LTS over time.

Methods
Study Population

Frozen sera collected from a consecutive sample of individuals from November 2004 to October 2005 (n =
9,008), recruited from three VCT centers located in
municipalities of Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan area were
analyzed in this study. The VCT centers were selected
based on their role as reference centers for people seeking HIV testing at no cost in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan area. These sites are the places where any
Brazilian citizen can be tested for HIV infection for free,
keeping anonymity if desired, with easy access, and in
the context of a welcoming environment. They are localized mainly in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, which
corresponds to a catchments area of about 5 million
people, the vast majority of them from poor social
strata.
Demographic information was obtained from baseline
data collection forms, administered in private by trained
interviewers. Among the population studied, the records
provided information on gender, age and sexual orientation for all individuals. In 96.5% of HIV-1 seroreactive
individuals (419 of 434) it was possible to obtain additional information on testing such as: reasons for being
tested, previous testing, and presence of symptoms associated to HIV/AIDS, as well as a history of risky injection behaviors. We should observe here that the
protocol of the present study did not interfere in any
sense with the routine procedures adopted by each one
of the VCT centers and in this sense allows for individuals the right to refuse to answer one or more questions they may consider as embarrassing or annoying.
Individuals were entitled to be counseled and tested, as
defined by the guidelines of the Brazilian Ministry of
Health (BMoH), irrespectively of their answers (or the
absence of answers) to the short standard form used as
a routine procedure in the VCT centers.
The present research protocol conformed to the Helsinki Declaration and to the local legislation. Informed
consent was obtained from the participants and the
refusal to provide information perceived as sensitive
explicitly guaranteed by the study protocol. The study
was approved by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) - Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute
Ethical Board, registration CAAE-0032.0.009.000-04.
Serological testing algorithm

With the goal of enabling this research protocol without
disturbing the routine procedures of the VCT centers,
two parallel blood tubes (BD Vacuntainer® ref. 367958)
were collected from each individual. One of them
remained in the VCT centers, in order to conduct the
standard serological testing and delivery of results with

de Castro et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:224
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/224

the corresponding post-test counseling, in accordance
with the Brazilian Ministry of Health (Ordinance N°59
of January 28, 2003). The second tube was sent to the
Laboratory of AIDS & Molecular Immunology, IOC
(FIOCRUZ), and then stored at -20°C until the delivery
of the results of the HIV testing. This strategy assured
the non-interference in the VCT center routine, as well
as the possibility to have 100% of the HIV seroreactive
samples viable to perform BED-CEIA methodology.
These samples were then thawed, aliquoted into sterile
microtubes and stored at -70°C for subsequent studies.
Two aliquots of serum and one aliquot containing the
blood clot were available for each HIV seroreactive
sample.
In order to identify recent HIV-1 infections, serum
samples reactive for HIV antibodies were subjected to
testing in vitro by a quantitative competitive capture
enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA), to determine the
proportion of anti-HIV-1 specific IgG in relation to the
total IgG, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
[9]. Briefly, serum (or plasma) samples were added to
the wells of a microplate coated with anti-human IgG.
HIV specific and not specific IgG molecules were captured on the solid phase, representing populations of
antibodies found in the sample. After the incubation
and washing protocol, a synthetic chimeric polypeptide
containing the HIV-1 immunodominant epitope of gp41
subtype B, E and D was added and incubated for one
hour at 37°C. At this stage the peptide bound to their
respective antibodies (anti-HIV-1 specific). After further
steps the reactions is revealed in the presence of TMB
(tetramethylbenzidine) and read using a spectrophotometer (wavelength 450 nm). The color intensity
obtained in each sample is directly proportional to the
amount of specific anti-HIV-1 antibodies. The controls
(negative, low positive and high positive) (Calypte HIV-1
BED Incidence EIA) and calibrators are analyzed along
with samples. The criteria for validation of the test, definition of samples to confirm and set the time of infection were used in accordance with the instructions and
worksheet provided by the manufacturer [10]. Annual
HIV seroincidence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were calculated on the basis of the BED-CEIA results,
using the 153-day window period and the seroincidence
formula described elsewhere [9,10]. Two correction strategies, here named CF1 [12] and CF2 [13] were further
applied.
DNA Extraction and PCR amplification of HIV-1 env and
pol regions

Proviral DNA was extracted from the blood clot using
the phenol/chloroform method [14]. The samples were
amplified for the gp120 C2-V3 region using a nested
PCR protocol with ED5/ED12 and ED31/ED33

oligonucleotide sets respectively as outer and inner primers [15], generating a fragment of approximately 564
bp. Similarly, for the pol gene we amplified a 1 Kb fragment covering the protease (PR) and part of the reverse
transcriptase (RT) using the outer DP10/LR54 and inner
DP16/LR49 primer sets as previously described [16,17].
The samples were amplified in the thermocycler GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 (Perkin Elmer - Norwalk,
USA) using the following conditions: 3 cycles at 97°C
for 1 minute, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 minutes. Thirty
two cycles at 94°C for 45 seg, 55°C for 1 minute, 72°C
for 2 minutes. Final cycle was performed at 72°C for 10
minutes. PCR products were visualized after electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels (Gibco/BRL, Life Technologies - USA) and purified (GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel
Band Purification Kit) following the manufacturer’s protocol (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare - UK).
DNA sequencing and Phylogenetic analyses

Purified PCR products corresponding to env and pol
regions were respectively submitted to automated
sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Ready Reaction - ABI PRISM (Perkin
Elmer, Foster City, USA), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Fifty to 100 ng of amplified DNA were
used for sequencing reaction in both senses using the
env inner primers ED31 and ED33. For the pol region,
sequence reactions were performed using DP16 and
LR49 in addition to the RT12 and LR51 in order to
cover the whole fragment in both directions Sequencing
reactions were performed in the thermocycler GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 (Perkin Elmer - Norwalk,
USA) using the following conditions: 25 cycles of 96°C
for 30 seconds, 50°C for 20 seconds and 60°C for 4
minutes. Each reaction product with a final volume of
20 μl was incubated for 15 min with 80 μl of 75% isopropanol, followed by centrifugation, discarding of the
supernatant and drying the precipitate in the thermalcycler at 70°C for about 10 minutes. The pellet was suspended with 10 ul of Hi-Di Formamide, followed by a
shock of 5 minutes at 95°C and 1 minute on ice for
denaturation and placed on the ABI model 3100 DNA
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Generated DNA sequences (sense and anti-sense) of
each sample were assembled using SeqMan, included
in the DNASTAR package [18]. Sequence electropherograms obtained for the env C2-V3 and pol regions
were respectively aligned against a set of reference
strains from HIV-1 group M subtypes using CLUSTAL
X [19]. SIVcpz env C2V3 or pol sequences were used
as outgroup in both analyses. Gap stripping and minor
adjustments were manually performed. Phylogenetic
inferences were performed by the neighbor-joining
algorithm using the program Mega 3.0 (Molecular

Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, version 3.0), and
the reliability of the branches determined by analysis
of bootstrap calculated based on 100 re-samplings [20].
TREEVIEW [21] was used for visualization of the phylogenetic trees. Screening of pol recombinant forms
were assessed through the Rega HIV-1 Subtyping Tool
website [22] and further confirmed by bootscanning
analysis (sliding window of 400 bp, incremental
steps of 10 bases, and the Kimura two-parameter
model) as implemented in Simplot version 2 (Ray
S. Simplot v2.5.0 http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware/simplot/).
Data Analysis

Data were entered into contingency tables and analyzed
using chi-square or Fisher’s exact test.

Results
Overall 9,008 persons were tested for HIV infection in
the three VCT centers. Men comprised 41.4% of the
tested population, of whom 10.7% (n = 399) referred to
have had sex with other men. Twenty-eight percent of
clients were younger than 25 years, 40.8% were 25-40
years old, and 31.2% were older than 40 years.
The overall prevalence of HIV infection was 4.8%,
higher for men compared to women (6.5% vs. 3.6%).
Prevalence was 6 times higher for MSM (24.8%) vis-àvis heterosexual men (4.3%). The age group more
affected was young adults aged 25 to 40 years old, with
a prevalence of 6.3% (Table 1). The major motivations
for testing could be obtained for the HIV seropositive

individuals. In general, about thirty-five percent of the
individuals with valid answers admitted to be recently
exposed to risk as the main reason to seek and HIV
test, over one quarter said testing had been taken after
the suggestion made by professionals from a health service. Forty individuals (roughly corresponding to 10% of
the individuals with valid answers) reported that symptoms related to HIV/AIDS were their main motivation
for testing, whereas 15% reported they were mainly
motivated by the desire to prevent themselves against
HIV. In this subgroup, only five people were returning
for a new test (all of them with prior negative results),
and 404 individuals with valid answers (96.42%)
reported unprotected sexual intercourse as their main
risk factor. Eight individuals (less than 2%) reported to
have shared syringes in the context of illicit substance
self-administration.
Based on the BED serology results, sixty-one out of
the 434 seropositive individuals (14.0%) were classified
as RS, with an overall incidence rate of 1.68%/year (95%
CI 1.26% -2.10%). Data including the estimated incidence re-calculated according to CF1 (1.09%/year) and
CF2 (1.17%/year) are also presented. Incidence rates
were also calculated according to the different exposure
categories and age strata (Table 2). Overall, higher incidence rates were observed for MSM when compared to
heterosexual men (8.55-11.96% vs 0.56-1.12%), and
young adults aged 25-40 years old.
Molecular analyses of the C2-V3 env, RT and Protease genomic regions were performed for 52 out of
the 61 RS (85%) and 114 out of the 122 (93%) randomly selected LTS samples. Overall, 80.1% (n = 133)
individuals were infected by subtype B viruses, 8.4%
by subtypes F (n = 13) and C (n = 1), and recombinant forms were found in 11.4% (n = 19) of the isolates. No significant differences were found between
RS and LTS for subtype distribution; however, a
higher proportion of non-B subtypes were found in
the RS group (11.5% vs 7.0%). Roughly 75% (14 out of
19) of recombinant samples were between B and F
subtypes and none of them showed the same breakpoint of recombination in the pol region, or subtype
determination between pol and env regions, confirming the high frequency of URFs BF, as usually
described in our region [23].
An HIV-1 A PR UK RT A ENV mosaic genome was
detected among the LTS. Based on the bootscanning
analysis (data not shown), this viral genome was composed by a fragment of subtype A in the protease portion, one fragment of around 400 bp classified as
unknown (U), located at the 5’ side of the reverse transcriptase, followed by a subtype K fragment of 301 bp
from position 2952 to 3253 (relative to HXB2 isolate).
The gp120 C2-V3 region was assigned as subtype A.

Discussion
Data generated from multiples studies conducted
under the scope of the HIV/AIDS National Surveillance System, clearly indicate that the epidemic in Brazil persists as a concentrated one [3,4]. Like other
countries in the region, our epidemic is driven mostly
by Men who have sex with men [3,4]. The 4.8% overall
prevalence found in our study conducted on three
VCTs located in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro State,
are in accordance with data from studies conducted
among clients seeking HIV testing in VCT services.
These studies found a higher prevalence among these
clients than in the general population in which rates
are around 0.6%. [24-27]. Our data showing a prevalence of HIV infection 6 time higher among MSM
when compared to heterosexuals participating in the
same study, corroborates with a variety of studies
which results showed high rated of HIV infection
among this population (9.2% -32.2%). In a report of
the Population Council, published recently, one study
using the respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method
points to a high prevalence (7%; 95%CI 5-11%) among
MSM in the city of Campinas, state of São Paulo. Of
special concern are the high prevalence found between
very young MSM (aged 14-19) among whom a prevalence of 4% (95%CI 1-9%) was found, suggesting the
epidemic in this population is far to be curbed [28].
Finally, all these data are in accordance with the AIDS
national report system that register a proportion 11
times higher of MSM AIDS cases reported when compared to cases reported among heterosexual men [29],
reinforcing the conclusion that MSM remain disproportionately affected by the epidemic in Brazil.

The approach adopted by our study has been found to
be highly sensitive (82% [95%CI 77-86%]) and specific
(89% [95%CI 85-92%]) [30], and has been used to estimate HIV national incidence in the USA [31], where
viral diversity is similar to the scenario made evident for
the regions assessed by the present study, where most of
the infections are attributed to subtype B.
Different factors have been described as associated
with BED-CEIA misclassification, which can lead to
overestimated HIV incidence, including: HIV-infected
individuals under antiretroviral therapy, patients with
advanced immunodeficiency, drug naïve individuals with
persistent low to undetectable viral loads, and different
HIV subtypes [11,32,33]. In order to overcome these
putative caveats we applied 2 correction factors (CF1
and CF2) to improve the incidence estimate rates in our
study. Indeed, rates obtained after correction with CF1
and CF2 were close to each other and lower than the
one obtained with the conventional method. Although
lower estimates were obtained after the use of the correction algorithms, the proportions relative to the different categories remained approximately the same. This
speaks in favor of the internal consistency of our findings, irrespectively of the inclusion or not of the correction factors. Recently, a series of publications discuss
the pertinence and adequacy of such corrections [34-38]
and, as to the best of our knowledge, this subject is still
far from a consensus.
In our study, women found to be HIV-infected were
almost invariably infected in consequence of unprotected sex with HIV infected male partners. This is a
common pattern in contexts where blood transfusions
are safe and HIV drug use is uncommon, like in Rio de

de Castro et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:224

Janeiro. This city metropolitan area has been relatively
spared by the injecting drug users-driven boom of new
HIV infections secondary to the shared use of injection
paraphernalia, even in its national peak (in the late
1980s/early 1990s), and has declined since then. The
number of female IV drug users has been particularly
low [39,40]. Since early 90 s the standard of quality of
the Brazilian blood banks is comparable to the best
international ones [41]. As a result, new AIDS cases secondary to blood transfusions has been negligible in the
last decades, specially in urban areas such as the one
where our study was conducted (data available from
Monitoraids and SINAN-AIDS at: http://sistemas.aids.
gov.br/monitoraids/?lang=en-US&pagina=&st_lPanel=&indexMenu= -1).
No significant changes in the HIV-1 subtype distribution could be discerned among the RS compared to
LTS. Subtype B was predominant, followed by subtype F
and BF recombinant viruses, as previously described for
the Brazilian Southeast region [42-44]. A different scenario may be observed for heterosexual men vs. women,
when we compare HIV-1 infections with recombinant
virus (almost 1:7 vs. 1:15, p = 0.19). One case of AUK
recombinant infection was detected for the first time in
Brazil.

Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive assessment of HIV-1 prevalence, estimated incidence and subtype profile in the population seeking
testing in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area and may
contribute to better discern recent trends of the local
epidemic. Moreover, our data suggests that prevention
for MSM remains a challenge and efforts aiming to curb
the epidemic in this population should be prioritized.
The approach used for this study also permitted the
identification of new HIV-1 isolate, as the AUK recombinant genome found for the first time in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. Unfortunately, no further contact could be made
with this individual in order to track the origin and the
potential dissemination of this recombinant virus in the
country.
Due to the fact our data were obtained from a population who actively sought HIV testing, findings cannot be
generalized to the general population or to the sampling
frame defined by men who have sex with men living in
the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro and should be
viewed with the necessary caution. Notwithstanding, the
present study is the most comprehensive assessment of
the population seeking testing in the Rio de Janeiro
metropolitan area carried so far and may inform
renewed policies aiming to prevent and treat people living with HIV/AIDS in Rio de Janeiro.
