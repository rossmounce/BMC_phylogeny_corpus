Abstract
Background: Orthologs of the vertebrate ATP gated P2X channels have been identified in
Dictyostelium and green algae, demonstrating that the emergence of ionotropic purinergic signalling
was an early event in eukaryotic evolution. However, the genomes of a number of animals including
Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, both members of the Ecdysozoa superphylum,
lack P2X-like proteins, whilst other species such as the flatworm Schistosoma mansoni have P2X
proteins making it unclear as to what stages in evolution P2X receptors were lost. Here we
describe the functional characterisation of a P2X receptor (HdP2X) from the tardigrade Hypsibius
dujardini demonstrating that purinergic signalling is preserved in some ecdysozoa.
Results: ATP (EC50 ~44.5 M) evoked transient inward currents in HdP2X with millisecond rates
of activation and desensitisation. HdP2X is antagonised by pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'
disulfonic acid (IC50 15.0 M) and suramin (IC50 22.6 M) and zinc and copper inhibit ATP-evoked
currents with IC50 values of 62.8 M and 19.9 M respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis showed
that unlike vertebrate P2X receptors, extracellular histidines do not play a major role in
coordinating metal binding in HdP2X. However, H306 was identified as playing a minor role in the
actions of copper but not zinc. Ivermectin potentiated responses to ATP with no effect on the rates
of current activation or decay.
Conclusion: The presence of a P2X receptor in a tardigrade species suggests that both nematodes
and arthropods lost their P2X genes independently, as both traditional and molecular phylogenies
place the divergence between Nematoda and Arthropoda before their divergence from Tardigrada.
The phylogenetic analysis performed in our study also clearly demonstrates that the emergence of
the family of seven P2X channels in human and other mammalian species was a relatively recent
evolutionary event that occurred subsequent to the split between vertebrates and invertebrates.
Furthermore, several characteristics of HdP2X including fast kinetics with low ATP sensitivity,
potentiation by ivermectin in a channel with fast kinetics and distinct copper and zinc binding sites
not dependent on histidines make HdP2X a useful model for comparative structure-function
studies allowing a better understanding of P2X receptors in higher organisms.

Background
Vertebrate P2X receptors comprise a family of ligand gated
ion channels activated by extracellular ATP [1]. They form
homo or heteromeric trimers with each monomer consisting of intracellular amino and carboxy termini, two transmembrane domains and a large glycosylated extracellular
region containing five disulphide bonds [2] and the agonist binding site [3]. Mammalian species possess seven
distinct P2X subtypes (P2X1–7) that play important roles
in a wide range of physiological processes including neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contractility and bone formation [4,5]. Many studies have
also described potential roles for ATP as an extracellular
signalling molecule in a range of invertebrate phyla [6]
and plants [7,8] leading to the assumption that ATP is a
primitive signalling molecule and that the emergence of
purinergic receptors occurred relatively early in evolution
[9]. This assumption is supported by the definitive molecular and functional identification of P2X receptors in the
slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum [10], the green alga
Ostreococcus tauri [11] and the choanoflagellate Monosiga
brevicollis [11]. However, several non-vertebrate organisms for which full genome data are available lack P2Xlike genes, including Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Apis mellifera. Arthropods and nematodes are members of the protostome
superphylum Ecdysozoa. Given that P2X receptors are
present in choanoflagellates, believed to be the sister
group to the Metazoa, and in some representatives of the
protostome superphylum Lophotrochozoa including
Schistosoma mansoni [12] and Lymnaea stagnalis [13], the
absence of P2X receptors from the above fully sequenced
nematode and arthropod genomes suggests a loss of this
class of gene in an ancestor of the Ecdysozoa.
We identified a partial P2X-like sequence in expressed
sequence tag (EST) data from the tardigrade Hypsibius
dujardini. Tardigrades are microscopic animals around
200 to 500 m in length that inhabit both marine and
fresh water habitats [14,15]. They possess a fascinating
ability to desiccate into a reversible state of metabolic suspension called cryptobiosis allowing them to survive for
many decades in harsh environments, such as lack of oxygen, extremes in temperature, and high pressure, before
rehydration to an active state within minutes [16]. Tardigrades are placed in their own phylum, Tardigrada and
share features with both arthropods and nematodes. Like
arthropods they possess legs and a distinctly segmented
body. However they also have a triradiate pharynx more
reminiscent of the nematodes. Indeed, molecular phylogenetic analyses support tardigrades as part of the Ecdysozoa [17,18]. Functional confirmation that tardigrades
possess P2X receptors would expand our emerging knowledge of P2X phylogeny and better estimate the pattern of
loss of P2X in nematodes and arthropods. Furthermore, a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/17

better understanding of P2X receptor function in simple
invertebrate organisms may help shed new light on structure-function aspects of human P2X receptors in health
and disease by virtue of conservation of functionally
important amino acid residues between evolutionary
remote P2X receptors and the identification of novel P2X
mediated signalling pathways. The aim of this present
work therefore was to determine whether the Hypsibius
dujardini EST sequence corresponds to a gene encoding a
functional P2X receptor and to determine its pharmacological properties. This was achieved by expression of
cRNA encoding the Hypsibius dujardini P2X gene in Xenopus oocytes to enable two electrode voltage clamp recordings of ATP evoked membrane currents. Using this
approach we show that the Hypsibius dujardini EST
sequence does indeed code a functional P2X receptor with
fast activation and desensitisation kinetics and similar to
some vertebrate P2X channels, is potentiated by ivermectin and inhibited by zinc and copper.

Results
Sequence analysis of HdP2X
Existing EST data for clone Hd_mx23_13F10 consisted of
330 bp from the 5' end of a cDNA showing similarity to
vertebrate P2X receptors. Sequencing of the full insert of
this clone showed that it contained an insert of 1743 bp
with an open reading frame of 1440 bp. The nucleotide
sequence of this cDNA has been submitted to the GenBank database [EU979525]. The coding sequence of
HdP2X is 480 amino acids in length and is predicted to
contain intracellular amino and carboxy termini and two
transmembrane helices (residues 47 – 67 and 345 – 365)
by the TopPred algorithm [19] (Fig. 1). From the human
P2X1–7 family, HdP2X was most similar to P2X1, P2X3 and
P2X4 with sequence identities of 36.1, 36.5 and 38.4%
respectively. However, phylogenetic analysis of the
HdP2X protein alongside vertebrate and other P2X
sequences suggests that, like other invertebrate P2X receptor proteins, HdP2X does not appear to be a member of
any of the seven vertebrate P2X receptor subtypes, but
instead represents an ortholog to the ancestor of the vertebrate paralog groups (Fig. 2). Sequence identity with the
S. mansoni, D. discoideum (dP2XA), and O. tauri P2X channels was 34.2%, 15.6% and 26.0% respectively. HdP2X
contains a number of conserved features typical to P2X
channels including ten cysteine residues in the extracellular domain [2], a consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation site in the amino terminal [20], and the lysine
residues and NFR/FT motifs shown to be involved in agonist binding (Fig. 1) [21].

Figureacid alignment of HdP2X
Amino 1
Amino acid alignment of HdP2X. The predicted amino acid sequence of HdP2X was aligned with human P2X1, and 4, rat
P2X2 and non vertebrate P2X channels from S. mansoni (smP2X) [12]O. tauri (OtP2X) [11], M. brevicollis (MbP2X) [11] and D.
discoideum (dP2XA) [10]. Predicted transmembrane regions in HdP2X (TopPred algorithm [19]) are depicted by black horizontal lines. Functionally important amino acid residues using human P2X1 residue numbering (indicated by *) are highlighted in
bold above the sequence including positively charged lysine residues, FT and NFR motifs, conserved cysteines and a conserved
consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation site. Point mutations made in HdP2X to investigate zinc and copper binding are
indicated in bold below the sequence.

respectively. Both hP2X1 (Fig. 3A) and S. mansoni P2X [12]
display a marked reduction in current amplitude between
the very first and second applications of 100 M ATP five
minutes apart (34.39 ± 5.46% and 45.76 ± 5.10% reductions respectively (n = 15)) before producing stable
responses with subsequent applications of agonist at five
minute intervals. In contrast, with the same experimental
protocol, HdP2X showed a much lower reduction in current amplitude (8.96 ± 5.46% (n = 11)) between first and
second applications of ATP (first application mean = -1.77
± 0.30 A; second application mean = -1.62 ± 0.29 A
(Fig. 3A) demonstrating that HdP2X recovers more rapidly from desensitisation than hP2X1 and S. mansoni P2X.
The current-voltage relationship for HdP2X was obtained
by applying 100 M ATP at a range of holding potentials
between -60 mV to and +40 mV. Typical of a non selective
cation channel the reversal potential was -3.8 mV (n = 6)
and the current voltage relationship showed a slight outward rectification over the range of potentials measured
(Fig. 3B and 3C).

Phylogenetic relationships of Hypsibius dujardini P2X.
Aligned protein sequences from P2X homologues from H.
dujardini (Hd) (Tardigrada), vertebrates (represented by
human (h), mouse (m) and rat (r); these taxa have seven paralogous P2X genes (P2X1–7)), S. mansoni (Sm) (Platyhelminthes), L. stagnalis (Lym) (Mollusca), M. brevicollis (Mb)
(Choanoflagellida), D. discoideum (d) (Mycetozoa; Dictyosteliida; five paralogues) and two Ostreococcus species, O. tauri
(Ot) and O. lucimarinus (Ol) (Chlorophyta; Prasinophyceae)
were analysed using Neighbour Joining and maximum parsimony methods. Both methods agreed on the well supported
nodes figured in this phylogram. Nodes were supported with
bootstraps of 100% unless otherwise indicated; all nodes
with less than 75% bootstrap support were collapsed.

sitised during the continued presence of agonist (Fig. 3A).
At 100 M ATP (~EC90) the rise time from 10% to 90%
peak amplitude was 71.4 ± 2.5 ms and the current decay
from peak to 50% peak was 289.9 ± 16.1 ms (n = 39). The
decay of the current in the continued presence of 100 M
ATP was best fit with two exponentials consisting of a fast
component with a time constant of 122 ± 26 ms and a relative amplitude of 0.68 ± 0.04 and a slower component
with a time constant of 627 ± 148 ms and a relative amplitude of 0.32 ± 0.04 (n = 6). As a direct comparison using
the same experimental apparatus application of 100 M
ATP at the fast human P2X1 receptor gave rise and decay
times of 134.5 ± 11.0 ms and 727.0 ± 88.6 (n = 15) ms

Agonists
ATP induced responses at HdP2X in a concentration
dependent manner with an EC50 of 44.5 M (pEC50 4.5 ±
0.1, n = 7) and a Hill slope of 1.12 ± 0.14 (Fig. 3D and 3E).
The ATP analogue Bz-ATP also evoked responses at
HdP2X with an EC50 of 12.2 M (pEC50 5.9 ± 0.2, n = 5)
and a Hill slope of 0.7 ± 0.2. The efficacy of Bz-ATP was
lower (p < 0.01) than ATP, with the maximum Bz-ATP
response 64.6 ± 5.7% that of the maximum response to
ATP (Fig. 3D). Currents evoked by Bz-ATP had a slower
rise time and rate of desensitization than equivalent ATP
evoked currents (p < 0.01 in both cases). With 100 M
BzATP (maximal response) the time from 10%–90% peak
current was 142.3 ± 10.2 ms and the rate of current decay
from peak to 50% was 446.4 ± 38.9 ms (n = 7) (Fig. 3F).
-methylene ATP (meATP) at 100 M evoked currents
that were less than 50% of those evoked by 100 M ATP.
ADPhex (hexokinase treated ADP), adenosine, UDP and
UTP at 100 M failed to elicit currents at HdP2X.
Antagonists
PPADS antagonised ATP evoked currents at HdP2X with
an IC50 of 15.0 M (pIC50 4.6 ± 0.1, n = 5) and a Hill slope
of -1.0 ± 0.3 for responses evoked by 100 M ATP (Fig. 4).
Suramin also antagonised HdP2X currents in a concentration dependent manner but not as strongly as PPADS.
Suramin inhibited 100 M ATP responses with an IC50 of
22.6 M (pIC50 4.7 ± 0.3, n = 5–7) and a Hill slope of -0.8
± 0.3. A component of the HdP2X current was resistant to
suramin and at the highest concentration tested (300
M), only ~75% of the 100 M ATP evoked response was
inhibited (Fig. 4).

Properties(seeATP evoked currents
Properties of ATP evoked currents. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings at a holding membrane potential of -60 mV
were made from oocytes expressing HdP2X. A. Comparison of HdP2X and human P2X1 receptors. Currents were recorded in
response to 100 M ATP, indicated by bar. HdP2X displays faster current rise and decay times than the human P2X1 and displays faster recovery from desensitisation between the first and second applications of agonist (applications 5 minutes apart). B.
Current voltage relationship of HdP2X. The reversal potential of ATP mediated currents was determined by recording ATP
(100 M, indicated by bar) induced currents at holding potentials ranging from -100 mV to +40 mV with a 5 minute interval
between applications. Currents obtained in different oocytes were normalised to the current obtained at -60 mV for each individual cell (n = 6). C. Example currents for the plot depicted in B. D. Concentration response curves for ATP, Bz-ATP and me-ATP. Mean currents were normalised to the response given by 100 M ATP (n = 5–7). E and F. Example currents recorded
in response to ATP (E) and Bz-ATP (F) (concentrations in M, agonist application indicated by bar).

HdP2X is inhibited by zinc and copper
Vertebrate P2X receptors can be subject to allosteric modulation by both metal ions and pH [22]. Unlike some vertebrate P2X receptors [23], neither the ATP concentration
response curve nor the amplitude of ATP evoked currents
for HdP2X were affected by acidic pH (pH6.5) (n = 5, data
not shown). The divalent cations zinc and copper however both caused concentration dependent inhibition of
ATP-evoked currents (Fig. 5). Zinc inhibited 100 M ATP
currents, with an IC50 of 62.8 M (pIC50 4.2 ± 0.14, n = 5–
6) and a Hill slope of -0.7 ± 0.1. Copper also acted as an
inhibitor of 100 M ATP currents with an IC50 of 19.9 M
(pIC50 4.7 ± 0.06, n = 5–6) and a Hill slope of -0.8 ± 0.1.
(Fig. 5A). Histidine residues have previously been
reported to be involved in zinc and copper inhibition of
the P2X7 receptor [24,25] and also in the potentiation of
P2X2 receptor currents by zinc [26]. Three histidine residues are present in the extracellular region of HdP2X and
we therefore mutated these residues to alanine both individually and in combination with each other in order to
probe their potential involvement in metal ion binding.
Using 100 M zinc as a test concentration, wild type currents evoked by 100 M ATP (~EC80) were inhibited by
59.3 ± 2.2%. The inhibition observed for the single histidine mutants H232A, H252A and H306A and the double
histidine mutants H232A/H252A, H252A/H306A and
H232A/H306A was not significantly different from wild
type (Fig. 5B). The triple histidine mutant H232A/H252A/
H306A produced a non functional channel and therefore
could not be studied. With copper (100 M) as the inhibitor, wild type currents were inhibited by 81.0 ± 2.3%.
Similar to zinc, the inhibition observed in the single histidine and the H232A/H252A double mutant with copper
did not significantly differ from wild type (Fig. 5B). The
inhibition observed with the double mutants H232A/
H306A and H252A/H306A however was less than wild
type (p < 0.05) with H232A/H306A currents inhibited by
60.0 ± 3.9% and H252A/H306A currents inhibited by
50.7 ± 8.9%. In order to assess whether mutation had
resulted in a gross change in channel function, the
potency of ATP for each histidine mutation was assessed
(Fig. 5C) and none of the single or double mutations pro-

duced a concentration response curve that differed significantly from wild type. Lysine, aspartic acid, and glutamic
acid residues are also potential candidates for coordinating metal binding and a glutamic acid residue in rat P2X7
has been shown to be involved in zinc and copper binding [25]. We therefore mutated lysine and negatively
charged residues in HdP2X that were specific between
HdP2X and S. mansoni P2X since this channel is also sensitive to metal ions [27]. Five alanine substitution mutations were created (K297A, E249A, D183A, K130A and
E110A) and tested for sensitivity to zinc and copper inhibition (Fig. 5B). No significant difference from the wild
type inhibition for either zinc or copper was observed in
any of these charged amino acid mutations.
HdP2X currents are potentiated by Ivermectin
Ivermectin, a broad spectrum anti-parasitic agent from the
bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis is known to potentiate
ATP-evoked currents at human and mouse P2X4 [28,29]
and the S. mansoni [12] P2X receptors. We therefore studied the effects of this allosteric modulator on the HdP2X
receptor. Ivermectin alone was unable to activate the
receptor (data not shown). However, 3 M ivermectin
potentiated the response to a maximal concentration of
ATP (300 M) by 223.8 ± 14.1% of control responses,
with no notable effect on the rates of current activation or
decay (Fig. 6). Currents were significantly (p < 0.01)
potentiated in the presence of 3 M ivermectin at all concentrations of ATP investigated and the concentration
response curve for ATP in the presence of 3 M ivermectin
had an EC50 of 32.1 M (pEC50 4.5 ± 0.1, n = 5–10) and a
Hill slope of 0.8 ± 0.2.

Discussion
Despite their absence in several key model organisms such
as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and
Caenorhabditis elegans, functional P2X receptors have now
been described in a wide range of non-vertebrate metazoan phyla including platyhelminthes [12,27], and molluscs (41), and in representatives of other eukaryotic
kingdoms such as dictyostelida [10], prasinophyceae [11]
and choanoflagellates [11]. Additional partial and pre-

dicted P2X-like proteins can be identified in EST and partial genome data from other animals, including
additional molluscs, echinoderms [30] and cnidaria.
These data provide an emerging phylogenetic understanding of the evolution of ionotropic purinergic signalling.
Alignment of P2X proteins from a diverse range of taxa
with the mammalian P2X(1–7) families (Fig. 2) clearly
shows that the mammalian P2X receptors are a lineagespecific gene expansion, with ortholog triplets evident in
mouse, human and rat. A lineage-specific expansion is
also evident in D. discoideum. In the other taxa, the single
P2X receptors identified appear to be orthologous to the
entire vertebrate expansion. This strongly suggests that the
emergence of a family of seven mammalian P2X receptors
was a relatively recent evolutionary event that occurred
subsequent to the split between vertebrates and invertebrates. The functional confirmation that P2X receptors
exist in the tardigrade H. dujardini strongly suggests that
the loss of P2X receptors in some nematode (represented
by C. elegans) and arthropod (represented by the
sequenced hexapod genomes) species occurred independently, as both traditional and molecular phylogenies place
the divergence between Nematoda and Arthropoda before
their divergence from Tardigrada. Pharmacological evidence for purinergic signalling in some nematode and
arthropod species [6] suggests that P2X-like receptors may
have been maintained in some members of these phyla.
Indeed a partial transcript for a P2X gene from the nematode Xiphinema index [31] suggests that the loss of P2X in
C. elegans may have occurred relatively late in nematode
evolution, and P2X-like ESTs from the chelicerate
Boophilus microplus similarly suggest that the loss of P2X
receptors in arthropods may be restricted to Hexapoda.

Ivermectin potentiates ATP evoked currents at
HdP2X. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were
made from Xenopus oocytes expressing HdP2X. A. Representative ATP (100 M) evoked currents recorded from the
same cell in the presence and absence of 3 M ivermectin
(ATP/ivermectin application indicated by bars). Five minutes
recovery was allowed between applications and ivermectin

second recording as well as being present in the ATP application. B. Concentration response curves for ATP in the presence (open circles) and absence (closed squares) of 3 M
ivermectin (n = 7). Mean currents were normalised to the

Based on their kinetic parameters and ligand sensitivity,
mammalian P2X receptors can be divided into three
groups [32]. Group 1 consists of P2X1 and P2X3 receptors
that have high sensitivity for ATP (EC50 ~1–3 M) and
show rapid channel activation and desensitisation during
the continued presence of agonist. Group 2 includes P2X2,
P2X4, P2X5, and P2X6 receptors with a lower sensitivity for
ATP (EC50 ~10 M) and much slower desensitization
whilst group 3 is represented by P2X7 which has a very low
sensitivity for ATP (EC 50 ~300 M) and shows little
desensitization. HdP2X displays an unusual phenotype in

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:17

that it has a relatively low sensitivity for ATP (EC50 ~44.5
M) but has very fast activation and desensitisation kinetics. This is interesting from a mechanistic point of view
regarding the relationship between channel gating and
agonist binding since it demonstrates that that fast channel kinetics do not necessarily have to be associated with
a high agonist sensitivity. Similar to HdP2X, a P2X3-like
receptor from Zebrafish has also been shown to combine
fast current kinetics with low sensitivity to ATP [33]. However, unlike HdP2X (Fig. 3A) current amplitudes at the
Zebrafish channel never fully recover from the first stimulation. Other lower organism P2X receptors that have
been characterised to date have all displayed slow rates of
desensitisation making HdP2X the first example of a non
vertebrate P2X channel with fast kinetics. Given that it is
likely that a fast phenotype evolved independently in
P2X1,3 and HdP2X channels, it will be interesting to determine whether the same factors determine the rates of current activation and desensitisation in these evolutionary
remote channels.
HdP2X contains several amino acid residues that are
highly conserved throughout the vertebrate P2X receptor
family. The ten conserved cysteine residues present in the
extracellular loop of all vertebrate P2X receptors are
thought to form five disulphide bonds [2] and these residues are also present in HdP2X suggesting conservation of
gross extracellular structure constrained by disulphide
bond location. It is interesting to note that the P2X receptors from O. tauri and M. brevicollis [11] possess only eight
of these ten conserved cysteine residues in their putative
extracellular regions and that in each case the two absent
cysteines correspond to a proposed disulphide bond pairing in the human P2X1 receptor [2] (the equivalents of
hP2X1 C217 and C227 are absent in O. tauri and C117
and C165 are absent in M. brevicollis). The agonist binding
site of P2X receptors is distinct from other ATP-binding
proteins and is thought to be formed from the interaction
between adjacent subunits [34]. Based on site directed
mutagenesis combined with methanethiosulfonate reactivity a core common mode of action of ATP binding at
P2X receptors has been proposed consisting of lysine residues adjacent to the transmembrane domains coordinating phosphate binding, an NFR motif binding the
adenine/ribose moiety and an FT motif also involved in
agonist action [21]. The lysine residues, NFR and FT
motifs are also present in HdP2X (Fig. 1) suggesting that
this mechanism of ATP binding arose relatively early in
evolution and is not restricted to mammalian receptors.
However, the NFR motif and the equivalent of hP2X1 K68
are absent in the D. discoideum P2XA receptor [10], the FT
motif is YT in S. mansoni P2X [12] and the NFR motif is
NIR in the O. tauri [11] receptor suggesting that conservation of the residues involved in ATP binding is not universal to all P2X receptors. Residues at positions D280 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/17

R278 in the rat P2X4 receptor have also been shown to
play an important role in the action of ATP [35]. These residues are also conserved in HdP2X, S. mansoni P2X and M.
brevicollis P2X suggesting that, despite their incomplete
conservation amongst the seven mammalian P2X subtypes, these two residues may also play an important role
in the formation of the ATP binding site in some P2X
receptor subtypes. Interestingly, the only feature with
complete conservation across all vertebrate and lower
organism P2X receptors characterised to date is a consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation site in the N-terminal tail of the receptor (Fig. 1). This putative
phosphorylation site has been shown to regulate desensitisation in both P2X1 [36] and P2X2 [20] receptors however, surprisingly direct phosphorylation of this site has
been shown not to occur [37,38].
Unlike the D. discoideum [10] and O. tauri [11] P2X receptors, the general P2 receptor antagonists suramin and
PPADS both inhibited HdP2X receptor currents in a concentration dependent manner. PPADS at 100 M effectively blocked ATP evoked currents. Suramin however was
less potent and a component of the current was resistant
to antagonism by suramin even at high concentrations. At
the highest concentration tested (300 M) only ~75% of
the 100 M ATP-evoked current was blocked. These properties are opposite to those of the S. mansoni P2X, which
was more potently inhibited by suramin and incompletely blocked by PPADS [12]. The presence of a lysine
residue at position 246 in rat P2X2 and at equivalent positions in other mammalian subunits has been proposed to
be involved in the inhibition of P2X receptors by PPADS,
possibly forming a Schiff base with the aldehyde group of
PPADS [39]. Similarly a lysine residue at position 138 in
human P2X1 has recently been shown to play a key role in
the binding of suramin [40]. Neither of these lysine residues shown to be involved in PPADS and suramin action
at mammalian receptors are conserved in either HdP2X or
S. mansoni P2X suggesting that additional residues in the
ectodomain also play key roles in the mechanism of
antagonist binding.
HdP2X is inhibited by both copper and zinc in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 5). The effects of these
metal ions on vertebrate P2X receptors differ markedly
with P2X1 being inhibited by zinc, P2X7 inhibited by both
zinc and copper, P2X2 potentiated by both zinc and copper and P2X4 potentiated by zinc but inhibited by copper
(reviewed by [41]). The action of these metal ions at P2X
receptors has physiological significance since both zinc
and copper are stored in presynaptic terminals and
released after nerve stimulation [41,42]. In addition to
HdP2X, the modulation of P2X receptors by metal ions is
also present in other lower organisms with Dictyostelium
P2X inhibited by copper [10] and S. mansoni P2X inhib-

ited by zinc [27]. Several mutagenic studies have identified amino acid residues involved in metal binding in
P2X2, 4 and 7 receptors (reviewed by [41]) however, no consensus binding site has emerged showing independent
evolution of metal binding sites among the different vertebrate P2X receptor subtypes. Histidine residues appear
to be a common feature in metal binding sites in P2X2, 4
and 7 receptors (reviewed by[41]) and in rat P2X2, H120
and H213 have been shown to form an intersubunit zinc
binding site [26]. There are three extracellular histidine
residues present in HdP2X and we mutated each of these
residues, both individually and in combination with each
other, to alanine in order to assess their involvement in
metal binding. Surprisingly, none of the extracellular
HdP2X histidine residues are essential for inhibition by
zinc or copper (Fig. 5B). This demonstrates that the mechanisms by which metal ions can influence the properties
of P2X receptor function are not restricted to interactions
with histidine residues. However, mutation of H306 in
combination with either H252 or H232 did produce a significant reduction in copper but not zinc inhibition. This
suggests that H306 plays a minor but non critical role in
the formation of the copper binding site and that the copper and zinc binding sites in HdP2X are distinct from one
another. Distinct zinc and copper binding sites are also
likely for P2X4 which is potentiated by zinc but inhibited
by copper [43].
Of the currently identified vertebrate and lower organism
P2X receptors only human and rat P2X4 [29] and S. mansoni P2X [12] are known to be potentiated by the semi synthetic macrocyclic lactone ivermectin. Both P2X4 and S.
mansoni P2X have a slow current phenotype and it is therefore interesting with respect to the mechanism of ivermectin action that HdP2X which has very fast current
activation and desensitisation kinetics is also potentiated
(Fig. 6). Ivermectin does not affect the kinetics of desensitization of HdP2X currents, a feature also observed in S.
mansoni P2X. However, in human P2X4, ivermectin confers a slower rate of desensitization [29]. Ivermectin is
thought to have an allosteric mode of action by increasing
maximum current when binding to a high affinity site on
the receptor to stabilise the open state, whereas binding to
a low affinity site is proposed to slow the rate of deactivation [44]. More recently it was proposed that during gating TM1 rotates relative to TM2, and ivermectin is able to
access the lipid environment and optimally bind to a
hydrophobic crevice created by TM1 and TM2 at the protein-lipid interface [45]. Interestingly several hydrophobic-nonpolar residues in both TM1 and TM2 that have
been shown to be involved in the action of ivermectin at
P2X4 are conserved in S. mansoni P2X [28] and these
hydrophobic-nonpolar residues are mostly also present
HdP2X. Future investigations comparing the mode of ivermectin action in both naturally fast and slow desensitising

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/17

P2X channels may enhance our understanding of the
process of gating and motions of the channel pore.

Conclusion
The identification and pharmacological characterisation
of a P2X receptor from H. dujardini provides further evidence that P2X receptors for ATP emerged early in eukaryotic evolution. Several unusual characteristics of HdP2X
including fast current kinetics with low ATP sensitivity,
ivermectin potentiation in a channel with fast kinetics and
the likelihood of distinct copper and zinc metal binding
sites make this channel a useful model for comparative
structure-function studies allowing a better understanding
of P2X receptors in higher organisms.

Methods
Identification of the Hypsibius dujardini P2X receptor
BLAST searches of the GenBank EST database identified a
partial Hypsibius dujardini EST sequence [GenBank:CO741227] encoding a peptide with significant
sequence similarity to the amino terminus of vertebrate
P2X receptors. The insert of the corresponding clone for
this EST sequence (Hd_mx23_13F10) was fully
sequenced on both strands (Automated ABI sequencing
service, Leicester University, U.K.) using vector
(pSPORT1) and insert specific primers and was shown to
contain a full length coding sequence which was named
HdP2X.
Phylogenetic analysis
P2X protein sequences were obtained from SwissProt/
UniProt and aligned with ClustalW. The alignment was
adjusted by eye to minimise unique indels and subjected
to phylogenetic analysis in PAUP* version 4.10b using
Neighbour Joining (BioNJ) and maximum parsimony
methods. The alignment was 696 characters long, and had
147 invariant and 433 parsimony-informative characters.
As the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the proteins
were poorly aligned, the analysis considered only the central 445 characters (of which 342 were parsimony informative, and 208 included gaps). The alignment is available
from the authors (MLB). Support for the derived phylogenies was assessed by 1000 bootstrap iterations.
Site directed mutagenesis
Point mutations in the HdP2X plasmid construct were
introduced using the QuikChange™ Mutagenesis Kit
(Stratagene, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Histidines at positions 232, 252 and 306,
glutamic acid residues at positions 110 and 249, an aspartic acid residue at position 183 and lysine residues at positions 130 and 297 were mutated to alanine. Double
mutations where two of the three histidines were both
mutated to alanine were created by conducting serial
rounds of site directed mutagenesis as follows: H252A/

Page 10 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:17

H232A, H252A/H306A, H232A/H306A. A triple mutant
where all three histidines were mutated to alanine was
constructed by introducing the H306A mutation into the
H252A/H232A double mutant. In all mutants, introduction of the correct mutation(s) and the absence of spontaneous mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing
(Automated ABI sequencing service, Leicester University).
Oocyte preparation
Mutant and wild type plasmids were digested with NotI to
linearise and sense strand cRNA was generated using the
T7 mMessage mMachine™ kit (Ambion, U.S.A.) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Manually defolliculated stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were injected with 5 ng of
cRNA (50 nl at a concentration of 0.1 g/l) using an
Inject +Matic micro injector (J. Alejandro Gaby, Genève)
and were stored at 18°C in ND96 buffer (96 mM NaCl, 2
mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM sodium
pyruvate, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) before electrophysiological recordings were carried out 3–6 days later.
Two-electrode voltage clamp
Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made from
oocytes using a Turbo TEC 10C amplifier (NPI Electronic
Instruments, Germany) with a Digidata 1200 analogue to
digital converter (Axon Instruments U.S.A.) and WinWCP
acquisition software (Dr J. Dempster University of Strathclyde, Scotland). Microelectrodes were filled with 3 M
KCl, and the external solution consisted of ND96 buffer
with 1.8 mM CaCl2 replaced with 1.8 mM BaCl2 to prevent the activation of endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels. Membrane currents were recorded at a
holding potential of -60 mV. Agonists, ATP (Mg2+ salt),
2',3'-O-4-Benzoylbenzoyl ATP (Bz-ATP) and ,-methylene-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (meATP) (Sigma,
Poole, U.K.) were applied from a U-tube perfusion system, whereas ivermectin, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS), suramin, zinc, copper
and altered pH solutions were bath-perfused as well as
being present at the same concentration in the U-tube
solution together with the agonist. Concentrationresponse curves were constructed by having a 5-minute
recovery period between applications and by normalizing
data points to two applications (one preceding and one
following the test agonist/antagonist concentration). 100
M ATP was used for normalisation as this concentration
produced reproducible responses with a 5 minute recovery interval.
Data analysis
Data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between
means were assessed by either the Student's t-test for simple comparison between two data sets or by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post test when multiple data sets were
compared (GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, USA)).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/17

Concentration-response data were fitted with the equation Y = ((X)H·M)/((X)H + (EC50)H), where Y is response,
X is agonist concentration, H is the Hill coefficient, M is
maximum response, and EC50 is the concentration of agonist evoking 50% of the maximum response. pEC50 is the
-log10 of the EC50 value. All concentration-response
curves, EC50 values and Hill coefficients were obtained
using GraphPad Prism software.
