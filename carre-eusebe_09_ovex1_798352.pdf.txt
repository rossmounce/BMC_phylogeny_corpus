Abstract
Background: In chickens, as in most birds, female gonad morphogenesis is asymmetrical. Gonads
appear first rather similarly, but only the left one undergoes full differentiation and gives rise to a
functional ovary. The right gonad, in which the cortex does not develop, remains restricted to the
medulla and finally regresses. Opportunity was taken of this left-right asymmetry to perform a
suppression subtractive hybridization screening to select for transcripts preferentially expressed in
the developing left ovary as compared to the right one, and thus identify genes that are potentially
involved in the process of ovarian differentiation.
Results: One of these transcripts, named Ovex1 according to its expression profile, corresponds
to an endogenous retrovirus that has not been previously characterized. It is transcribed as fulllength and singly spliced mRNAs and contains three uninterrupted open reading frames coding
potentially for proteins with homology to Gag and Pro-Pol retroviral polyproteins and a third
protein showing only a weak similarity with Env glycoproteins. Ovex1 is severely degenerated; it is
devoid of typical long terminal repeats and displays some evidence of recombination. An
orthologous Ovex1 locus was identified in the genome of zebra finch, a member of a different bird
order, and similar sequences were detected in turkey, guinea fowl, and duck DNA. The relationship
between these sequences follows the bird phylogeny, suggesting vertical transmission of the
endogenous retrovirus for more than 100 million years.
Ovex1 is transcribed in chicken gonads with a sex-dependent and left-right asymmetrical pattern. It
is first expressed in the cortex of the left indifferent gonads of both sexes. Expression is transient
in the left testis and absent in the right one. In developing ovaries, Ovex1 transcription increases
sharply in the left cortex and is weakly detected in the medulla. After folliculogenesis, Ovex1expressing cells constitute the follicular granulosa cell layer. Ovex1 expression highlights a striking
desquamation process that leads to profound cortical remodeling associated with follicle
morphogenesis.
Conclusion: Evidence for a selection pressure at the protein level suggests that this endogenous
retrovirus, expressed in the ovarian supporting cell lineage, might play an active role in bird ovarian
physiology.

Background
In chickens, as in most birds, gonad differentiation is
characterized by left-right (L/R) asymmetry. In the female,
only the left gonad becomes a functional ovary. The right
one fails to fully differentiate and ultimately disappears.
By contrast, both male gonads, initially asymmetrical,
become functional testes. Bird sex determination is not
fully understood. The heterogametic sex, with a ZW karyotype, is female and the homogametic sex, with two Z
chromosomes, is male. Unlike in mammals, the initial
genetic sex trigger is not clearly identified (reviewed in
[1,2]).
Gonad organogenesis begins around the 4th day of incubation (E4), with identification of the genital ridge, a
thickening of the coelomic epithelium on the medial
aspect of the mesonephros, in which primordial germ
cells, migrating from the germinal crescent, are going to
settle [3]. In both sexes, the gonad epithelium is characterized by the expression of the Lim homeodomain-containing protein Lhx9 [4]. The subjacent mesenchyme, which
will give rise to the so-called "medulla", expresses the steroidogenic factor SF-1 (Nr5a1/Ad4BP), Wnt-4, and by day
5, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) [4-7]. Early L/R asymmetry is observed in both sexes. The left gonad is larger,
has a thicker epithelium, usually called "cortex", and is
colonized by a greater number of primordial germ cells.
This asymmetry, more pronounced in females than in
males, is considered an early sign of some sex differentiation, prior to other morphological changes [8]. L/R asymmetrical expression of several genes (estrogen receptor ER, FET-1, Bmp7, R-Spondin1) in female gonads had been
reported and was related to the asymmetry of their differentiation [9-13]. However, the mechanism responsible
for this asymmetry has been identified only recently [1416]. It depends on the bicoid type homeobox gene Pitx2
(Pituitary homeobox 2), a general actor in early embryo L/
R differentiation [17]. In both sexes, Pitx2c is asymmetrically expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm, and later
in the epithelium of the left coelomic cavity in the region
of gonad formation. This factor is sufficient to induce the
differentiation of gonads along a "left pathway". The
action of Pitx2c results from its effect on retinoic acid (RA)
signaling. A balance between RA-synthesizing enzymes
(RALDH2) and RA-metabolizing enzymes (CYP26) controls RA levels. In both sexes, Pitx2c is expressed in the cortex of the left gonad. Pitx2c repression of RALDH2
synthesis prevents RA formation. In the cortex of the right
gonad, where Pitx2c is not expressed, RA is formed and, as
CYP26 is absent, the RA cascade is activated. RA suppresses transcription of ER- and of SF-1, a factor required
for the expression of the cell cycle mediator cyclin D1, thus
limiting cortical cell proliferation. Conversely, in the left
cortex, where RA is absent, ER- and SF-1 are expressed,
and cyclin D1-stimulated cell proliferation is activated. In

the medulla of both gonads, RA is degraded by Cyp26A1,
which allows some ER- expression.
After 6.5 days of incubation, ovaries and testes can be distinguished histologically by the differentiation in the
internal region of the male gonads of testicular cords
delimited by a basement membrane, enclosing germ cells
and supporting Sertoli cells. These somatic cells express
high levels of SOX9, DMRT1 and AMH [7,18-22].
At the same time, aromatase (P450 arom), the enzyme
converting androgens to estrogens, begins to be present in
the female gonads but is not expressed in the male ones
[9,10,23,24]. Estrogens are essential for ovarian differentiation [25-27]. The medulla is rather similar in both
female gonads. It expresses the estrogen receptor ER-,
aromatase and FoxL2, a forkhead transcription factor [28].
On the other hand, the expression of ER- in the left cortex and its absence in the right one leads to an asymmetry
in the estrogen-mediated differentiation of the gonads.
Primordial germ cells and somatic cells multiply in the left
ovarian cortex. Germ cells enter meiosis at E15.5 [29]. Folliculogenesis occurs after hatching at E21, with the progressive formation of follicles constituted of an oocyte
surrounded by a layer of somatic granulosa cells. In contrast, the development of the right gonad is limited. The
surface epithelium devoid of ER- is not stimulated by
estrogens and does not proliferate. The few germ cells do
not enter meiosis, and the gonad becomes vestigial after
hatching. The female right gonad does not have the physiological potential to form a functional ovary and even, in
the case of left ovary castration, differentiates into a testis
[30]. However, early Pitx2c ectopic expression is able to
overcome the degenerative fate of the right gonad and to
direct it toward an ovarian differentiation pathway [14].
With the purpose of finding yet unknown factors involved
in the early steps of ovarian cortex differentiation, we took
advantage of the differential fate of the two female gonads
in chicken. Suppression subtractive hybridization screening (SSH) was used to select transcripts expressed in the
left differentiating ovary and underrepresented in the
right gonad. In the course of this study, we identified a
new endogenous retroviral element that we named Ovex1,
whose specific expression in gonads is characterized by a
sexual dimorphism and a L/R asymmetry.
More than 30,000 endogenous retroviruses or ERVs, representing 2.9% of the DNA, are present in the chicken
genome [31,32]. They are remnants of ancestral retroviruses that have gained access to the germ line of a host,
leading to vertical transmission of the integrated provirus
to the offspring in a Mendelian fashion. They are characterized by the presence of two long terminal repeats
(LTRs), flanking sequences coding for structural and

enzymatic viral proteins. The genomic organization of
simple retroviruses is 5'LTR-Gag-Pro-Pol-Env-3'LTR. Viral
protein expression is controlled by the promoter and
enhancer elements located in the 5' LTR. The polyprotein
Gag (group specific antigen) is a structural component of
the virus particle. Pro encodes an aspartyl protease
required for processing of the Gag precursor. The polyprotein Pol contains domains for reverse transcriptase (RT),
RNase H, and integrase (IN). The envelope protein (Env)
is composed of two domains, a surface region (SU) and a
transmembrane domain (TM). After their initial integration, ERVs can copy themselves to different locations
within the genome, giving rise over long periods of time
to a family of related ERV elements, most of them inactivated by mutations (for a review, see [33]). Retroviruses
are divided into three major classes. Class I contains elements related to gammaretroviruses (such as Moloney
murine leukemia virus, MMLV) and epsilonretroviruses
(as Walleye dermal sarcoma virus, WDSV). Class II elements are related to alpharetroviruses (as the Avian leukosis virus, ALV), betaretroviruses (as Mouse mammary
tumor virus, MMTV), deltaretroviruses (as Human T-lymphotropic virus, HTLV) and lentiviruses (as Human
immunodeficiency virus, HIV). Class III contains elements related to spumaviruses (as Human foamy virus,
HFV) and ERV-L elements [34]. Some fish viruses, as the
Snakehead fish retrovirus, SnRV, have an intermediate
position and are said to be epsilon-like [35]. Endogenous
retroviruses of the chicken remain incompletely described
in spite of intensive studies. The most studied chicken
ERVs are class II elements specific for Gallus species. The
existence of retroviral sequences, related to human ERVs
and representative of the other classes of retroviruses has
been reported [31,32,35,36], but little is known about
these elements.
Chicken Ovex1 contains three long open reading frames
(ORF). The first two consecutive ORFs are similar to Gag
and Pro-Pol retroviral sequences. The third ORF in a different frame is possibly related to Env. A sequence orthologous to chicken Ovex1 was found in the genome of zebra
finch. We also detected the presence of similar Gag and Pol
sequences in the DNA of three other domestic birds.
Expression of Ovex1 was analyzed by RT-PCR and by in
situ hybridization in chicken gonads from embryonic day5 to adulthood. It depends both on the sexual determinism and on the L/R asymmetry pattern of gonad differentiation. This gene is specifically transcribed in somatic
cells of the ovarian cortex involved in the formation of the
follicles and in granulosa cells of the adult hen ovary. Its
expression enlightens the profound remodeling of the
ovarian cortex that occurs during follicle morphogenesis,
an important phase of the ovarian differentiation which
has not yet received much attention.

Results
Identification of differentially expressed genes in chicken
embryonic ovaries using SSH
In order to identify unknown factors involved in early
steps of the ovarian cortex differentiation, we performed a
suppression subtractive hybridization screening (SSH)
[37] to selected transcripts expressed in the chicken differentiating left ovary and underrepresented in the right
gonad in which the cortex does not differentiate. The 8day embryonic stage (E8) was chosen because the process
of cortex development is at its beginning; meiosis has not
yet started; and the gonads are easily dissected. We generated a left ovary cDNA-enriched library (LO-RO), by subtracting RsaI-digested cDNAs from the left ovary (LO)
with those of the right ovary (RO), and a right ovary
cDNA-enriched library (RO-LO) by the opposite screening. Two hundred and fifty clones from the (LO-RO)
library were pick-up randomly and submitted to differential hybridization screening. Macroarrays established with
the PCR-amplified inserts were hybridized with labeled
cDNA probes prepared with either the (LO-RO) or the
(RO-LO) subtracted libraries. Asymmetry of expression
was quantified by the ratio of (LO-RO)/(RO-LO) counts.
We report here the study of one clone, OG43, which had
a differential hybridization-screening ratio of 154, and a
high expression in gonads, preferentially the ovaries, with
left-right asymmetry. This clone was shown to correspond
to an endogenous retroviral element not yet identified
that we named Ovex1 (Ovary expressed, #1) in relation to
its expression pattern.
Sequence analysis of the Ovex1 locus
Identification of the insert of clone OG43 was performed
by BLAT screening of the May 2006, v2.1 draft assembly of
the chicken genome (galGal3). It revealed a 99.7% identity with the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of a hypothetical gene [GenBank:XM_420865] (locus LOC422926),
located on the chromosome 4 long arm (Fig. 1A). This
gene, annotated as coding for a protein "similar to env",
corresponds to the 3' region of the sequence given in Fig.
3, from nucleotide 6764.

Most of the expressed sequence tags (EST) corresponding
to this locus have an ovarian origin. Some of them extend
5' from the locus (Fig. 1B), suggesting that transcription
might start further upstream. Interestingly, the next locus
upstream from LOC422926 in the galGal3 draft assembly,
LOC422925, displays also a strict ovarian expression. It
corresponds to a predicted gene, [GenBank:XM_430004],
coding for a hypothetical protein of unknown nature (Fig.
1A) and extends from nucleotide 15 to 2461 of the
sequence given in Fig. 2. None of the already published
ESTs overlaps with the two loci. To examine if there might
be a relationship between these two neighboring loci that
have the same orientation and display the same specificity

of expression, we tried to amplify overlapping cDNA fragments from one locus to the other by RT-PCR using
embryonic ovary mRNA. The series of fragments obtained
demonstrates that the two loci constitute in fact a single
transcription unit (Fig. 1C).
The initiation cap site of this mRNA was determined by
rapid amplification of the 5'cDNA-end method (5'RACE)
using, in a first experiment, Ov6849a as antisense primer
(Fig. 1D). Two sequences were amplified, indicating the
existence of two types of mRNA: a genomic mRNA similar
to DNA and a spliced subgenomic transcript lacking the
97–5766 sequence (Fig. 1F). Additional 5'RACE experiments confirmed this result, one with a primer (Ov6061a)
located downstream from the acceptor splice site which
allows only amplification of the short spliced transcript,

and the second with a primer (Ov654a) located in the
intron to amplify the unspliced mRNA. Both experiments
gave the same 5'-terminal sequences, indicating that the
cap site of the two mRNAs is presumably G+1 or A+4 (Fig.
2), a few bases upstream from the putative start of
LOC422925. The cap site is located 23 nucleotides after a
consensus TATA box (Fig. 2).
The mRNA polyadenylation site was identified by 3' RACE
(Fig. 1D), using a forward primer common to both
mRNAs (Ov8378s). The longest sequence obtained was
polyadenylated at position 9213 (Fig. 3). Shorter
sequences, polyadenylated at positions 9203 to 9211,
were also found. The polyadenylation site is preceded by
a consensus polyadenylation signal, AAUAAA (nt 9190 to
9195). The maximum size of the unspliced mRNA is 9213

bp and that of the spliced transcript 3543 bp (not taking
into account the polyA tail). No other splicing was
detected by RT-PCR amplification using various pairs of
primers.
Surprisingly, in addition to the final polyadenylation signal, Ovex1 contains one AAUAAA and three AUUAAA hexamers followed by U and GU-rich elements, clustered in
the region of nucleotides 6082 to 6669, which might constitute polyadenylation signals leading to premature transcription arrest. However, the efficiency of these signals in
vivo is low as demonstrated by the RT-PCR amplification
of cDNA fragments D, E, and F (Fig. 1C) and the existence
of ESTs overcoming the signals (Fig. 1B). To verify if polyadenylation at these internal signals would affect differently the spliced and unspliced mRNAs we performed RTPCRs using sense primers located upstream from the polyadenylation signals, either into the intron to amplify the
unspliced mRNA, or across the splice site to amplify the
spliced product. Several antisense primers, upstream or
downstream from the four polyadenylation signals, were
tested in both cases. The amplification of cDNAs overrunning the signals indicates that at least a substantial fraction of both types of mRNAs is transcribed unto the final
polyadenylation site (additional file 1: Figure S2, Effect of
the internal polyadenylation signals).
The complete sequence of chicken Ovex1, obtained by
sequencing the cDNA fragments and the cloned RACE
products, is given in Figs. 2 and 3. It is 99.9% identical to
a region of the chicken genome draft assembly version
v2.1 (galGal3, chr. 4, + strand, 89,102,054 to
89,111,266). Differences between these two sequences
determined on different strains of Gallus gallus, the wild
type Red Jungle fowl for the DNA and the domestic White
Leghorn strain in our study, are exclusively single nucleotide substitutions.
Blat search in the recently sequenced genome of a passerine bird Taeniopygia guttata (zebra finch) revealed the presence of a sequence with 83% identity to chicken Ovex1
(taeGut1, chr. 4, + strand, 65,939,815 to 65,948,592). The
sequence is incomplete, due to the presence of a sequencing gap of some 600 bp in this first version of the genome.
This Ovex1 homolog is located on zebra finch chromosome 4, syntenic to chicken chromosome 4 long arm,
between the CD8 and SMYD1 loci as for chicken Ovex1.
Such conservation indicates that this sequence is the
ortholog of chicken Ovex1. The sequence of zebra finch
Ovex1 is given in additional file 2 (Figure S3, Partial zebra
finch Ovex1 sequence). Conservation of the TATA box, the
polyadenylation signal, and of sequences surrounding the
donor and acceptor splice sites suggests that zebra finch
Ovex1 is transcribed and spliced as chicken Ovex1.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/59

The first two thirds of the Ovex1 sequence appear to be
present as a single copy in chicken (galGal3) and zebra
finch (taeGut1) genomes. In contrast, in both species the
last third of Ovex1 contains sequences identified by
RepeatMasker as the internal part of a multi-copy LTRcontaining element, GGLTR11-int [36]. In addition, an
imperfect antisense 3'-fragment of CR1-Y4, member of
the large family of chicken CR1 non-LTR retrotransposons
(LINE) [31,38], is included in the 3'-UTRs. These
sequences are indicated in Fig. 3 and in additional file 2
(Figure S3, Partial zebra finch Ovex1 sequence).
Repeated sequences
Endogenous retroviruses are usually bordered by two
LTRs classically divided in U3-R-U5 regions. The 5' U3
region contains promoter and enhancer elements. Transcription is initiated at the 5' U3-R junction and terminates at the 3' R-U5 junction. We looked for repeated
sequences in the chicken Ovex1 gene and flanking
sequences. Direct repeats of 120–122-bp were found on
each side of the gene, from nucleotide -6 to +114, 17-bp
after the TATA box, on the 5'-side, and from nucleotide
9023 to 9144, 46-bp before the polyadenylation signal,
on the 3'-side (Figs. 2 and 3). These repeats, which have
only 73% identity, might be degenerated forms of the R
region of previous LTRs. Identity of the zebra finch repeats
is even lower (69%). No other repeated sequences corresponding to the U3 and U5 regions were found in the
genomic sequence in and around the gene. No sequence
complementary to the 3'-end of a chicken tRNA [39] that
might be the primer tRNA binding site (PBS) required for
reverse transcription was identified, thus precluding classification of Ovex1 according to this usual criterion. The
3'-UTR contains a 13-purine sequence that may correspond to the polypurine tract that precedes the 3'-U3
region in retroviruses (Fig. 3). Conservation of the 5'UTRs between chicken and zebra finch is globally low
(65%), but the sequence surrounding the splice donor site
is well conserved. By contrast, the 3'-UTRs are very similar
(80% identity score).

Chicken and zebra finch Ovex1 5'-proximal DNA
sequences were screened to detect transcription factor
binding sites, using the MatInspector program. Among
putative responsive elements conserved with a similar
position in the 5'-flanking regions, we identified a TATA
box and sites for Ras-responsive element binding proteins, forkhead domain factors, estrogen-related receptors,
GATA binding factors, and bicoid-like homeodomain
transcription factors, in particular Pitx2 [40]. These sites
are shown in additional file 3 (Figure S4, Alignment of
chicken and zebra finch 5'-proximal DNA sequences).

Open reading frames
As seen in Fig. 1E, the unspliced chicken mRNA contains
three large uninterrupted open reading frames (ORF). The
first two ORFs are contiguous in frame and separated by a
stop-codon. The third one is in a different frame and nonoverlapping. The spliced mRNA contains only the third
ORF (Fig. 1F). The conceptual translation is given in Figs.
2 and 3 for chicken and in additional file 2 for zebra finch
(Figure S3, Partial zebra finch Ovex1 sequence). Protein
similarity queries using Blastp have shown that the
unspliced mRNA potentially encodes Gag and Pro-Pol
polyproteins and that the spliced mRNA encodes a protein that might be an envelope protein. Chicken and zebra
finch Ovex1 display the same organization, which is typical of numerous retroviruses. Alignment of these proteins
is shown in additional file 4 (Figure S5, Alignment of
Ovex1 putative proteins).
Gag polyprotein
The Gag initiation codon is usually the first AUG after the
cap site. In the chicken unspliced mRNA, the first AUG, in
position 313, initiates potentially a 5-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide. Initiation may also occur at the next AUG
downstream, by reinitiation or leaky scanning [41]. The
next AUG is at position 370, in a correct context for initiation of the translation (CUCACUAUGAUGU). If translation starts effectively at this codon, the ORF would encode
a 565-residue protein till the first stop-codon (nucleotide
position 2065 to 2067) (Fig. 2). However, a second AUG,
immediately following this initiation codon in a seemingly less favorable context, has been chosen as initiator
for the hypothetical protein encoded by LOC422925. The
putative protein was analyzed using Blastp. Gag polyproteins are constituted by the matrix, the capsid and the
nucleocapsid domains. The C-terminal region (from the
amino-acid residue 248) has 22% identity with the capsid
domain of an epsilon-like retrovirus, Snakehead fish retrovirus (SnRV) [42]. The Ovex1 protein contains a
sequence EKQNPEERPDAYVNRKKMLY corresponding to
the major homology region (MHR) with the three underlined fundamental residues [43]. This region, which provides the interface for capsid binding and dimerization, is
present in all retroviruses with the exception of the spumaviruses. No zinc finger domain was identified here,
unlike in SnRV and most retroviruses except the spumaviruses. In the N-terminal region, no sequence similarity
was detected with other Gag proteins, even with that of
SnRV, but they do have some homology. As in SnRV, the
protein N-terminus is presumably not myristylated, and
the N-terminal region contains a polybasic sequence (residues 50 to 61) with two successive consensus nuclear
localization signals, KKPKPTNKCKKR [44]. As in SnRV,
the protein has a region of strong probability of coiledcoil structure [45], between residues 62 and 114, like in
the rod domain of myosin-type proteins. In addition, the

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/59

Ovex1 protein contains a L(X)6L(X)6L(X)6L leucine zipper
motif (residues 88–109) seen in numerous regulatory
proteins. Thus, this protein may be classified as a Gag
polyprotein by analogy with that of the SnRV and from
the position of its coding sequence preceding a Pol
sequence, but its functionality remains to be demonstrated. The uninterrupted zebra finch Gag polyprotein is
well conserved, with 90% sequence identity to chicken
Gag, and contains the same functional domains (see additional file 4 (Figure S5, Alignment of Ovex1 putative
proteins)).
Pro-Pol polyprotein
The second long ORF immediately follows the Gag amber
codon in the same translational frame and is presumably
translated by suppression of this codon as seen for SnRV,
gamma- and epsilonretroviruses [46]. Translation results
in a 1786-amino-acid Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein unto the
next stop-codon. Analysis of the conceptual translation of
this ORF allows the identification of retroviral aspartyl
protease (Pro) and Pol polyprotein domains: reverse transcriptase (RT), Rnase H, and integrase (IN) (Figs. 2 and 3).
In zebra finch, the Pol region is only partially sequenced
and most of the Rnase H domain is unknown. Chicken
and zebra finch Pol sequences display 81% identity in
their common regions and the same characteristics (see
additional file 4 (Figure S5, Alignment of Ovex1 putative
proteins)).

The aspartyl protease domain, approximately between
residues 583 and 686, contains the active site MLIDTGASYSIL and presents 29 to 26% identity with the proteases of Sphenodon endogenous virus SpeV [47],
immunodeficiency viruses and porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). As for SpeV, we note the absence of the conserved GRD/N motif present in all retroviral proteases,
except for spumaviruses [48].
The RT domain, from residue 767 to 965, displays a similarity with RTs of foamy viruses, fish viruses: Walleye epidermal hyperplasia viruses WEHV 1 and 2 [49], Walleye
dermal sarcoma virus (WDSV), SnRV (33–30% identity),
and with the partially sequenced reptilian SpeV. However
in chicken as in zebra finch Ovex1, several fundamental
RT residues are not conserved, in particular two of the
three aspartates that make up the catalytic active site [50],
a difference resulting presumably in the loss of the
enzyme activity.
The chicken Rnase H core domain, between amino-acid
residues 1211 and 1357, is similar to those of SnRV (35%
identity) and Moloney murine leukemia virus, MMLV
(32%) with, in particular, the conserved WFVDGSN and
FSDS motifs [51]. The distance between this sequence and
the RT domain is consistent with the presence of the tether

region that separates RT and Rnase H domains in vertebrate retroviral Pol genes [52].
The integrase (INT) has a similarity with those of MMLV,
WEHV2, foamy viruses and SnRV. It contains a putative
zinc finger: H(X)3H(X)29C(X)2C, as most retroviral integrases. The core domain, rve, between residues 1500 and
1647, is only partially conserved. Where other integrases
have the catalytic triad D(X)55–60D(X)35E, the motif is
E(X)59D(X)35E in chicken and E(X)59E(X)35E in zebra
finch Ovex1. The difference is important since substitution of the first aspartate by a glutamate drastically
impairs the integrase activity of Rous sarcoma and HIV
viruses [53]. The C-terminus does not contain the consensus GPY/F motif but a WMGPVRV sequence that might be
the degenerated remnant of this motif [35].
ORF3: an envelope protein?
The Ovex1 third ORF (ORF3) is located downstream from
Gag-Pol. It is entirely contained in the second exon of the
singly spliced transcript (Fig. 1F). A similar organization
occurs for the envelope protein of gammaretroviruses. The
ORF starts 11 bp after the splice site and encodes a putative protein of 873 amino acids. This ORF is potentially
interrupted by the presence of the internal polyadenylation signals that do not appear very efficient in vivo, as
demonstrated above. In zebra finch, the third ORF
encodes an 874-amino-acid putative protein with 81%
identity with the chicken protein and similar characteristics (see additional file 4 (Figure S5, Alignment of Ovex1
putative proteins)).

This region is quite complex. Segments of sequence on
gray background in Fig. 3 were identified by RepeatMasker
as weakly similar to GGLTR11-int, a consensus sequence
quoted in Repbase as internal part of an ERV1 chicken
endogenous retrovirus [36]. Nucleotide conservation with
GGLTR11 is rather low (60%) and better-conserved copies of ERV1 can be found in the chicken genome. Furthermore, the first two GGLTR11-like sequences are separated
by 30 nucleotides in GGLTR11 while located 960 nucleotides apart in Ovex1. The intervening region, not identified by RepeatMasker, is locally similar to sequences
found in chromosome Z. A similar presence of GGLTR11related sequences is detected in zebra finch ORF3, as seen
in additional file 2 (Figure S3, Partial zebra finch Ovex1
sequence). The conceptual translation of GGLTR11 is
given in additional file 5 (Figure S6, Structure and conservation of ORF3-encoded proteins). Unlike Ovex1 ORF3, it
contains stop-codons and frameshift mutations.
Significant similarity of the ORF3 putative protein with
other proteins was found only in an avian retrovirus, the
Tetraonine endogenous retrovirus (TERV). This defective
ERV of the ruffled grouse, Bonasa umbellus, a member of

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/59

the galliform order as chicken, contains 5' and 3' LTRs, a
Gag-like protein and a truncated region considered as an
envelope TM domain [54]. The similarity between Ovex1
and TERV is limited to this envelope domain, with 52%
identity over a 92-amino-acid region (residues 754 to
845) that can be extended upstream to amino acid 645,
with stop-codons and frameshifts in the TERV sequence.
This TERV region is closer to the consensus GGLTR11 than
is the Ovex1 sequence. The main arguments sustaining
the identity of the TERV envelope are its position just
before the 3' LTR and some similarity with envelope proteins of MMLV and PERV. Identity of ORF3 with these retroviral envelopes is even more limited.
The protein potentially encoded by ORF3 is larger than
prototypical retroviral envelope proteins. It contains two
hydrophobic regions shown in additional file 5 (Figure
S6, Structure and conservation of ORF3-encoded proteins). One is close to the N-terminus, and the second,
located in the C-terminal part, corresponds to the identified transmembrane anchor and is preceded by a
sequence susceptible to adopting a coiled-coil structure
(residues 753 to 780). The cytoplasmic domain, C-terminal to the TM region is short. Retroviral envelopes are glycosylated. Four conserved potential N-glycosylation sites
are present in the sequence. However, the protein does
not seem to possess a signal peptide. Retroviral envelope
precursors are cleaved between the surface and transmembrane domains at specific RX(R/K)R sites. The proteins
encoded by ORF3 in chick and zebra finch contain conserved potential cleavage sites. However, neither these
proteins nor TERV's contain the conserved CWLC
sequence [55], the consensus immununosuppressive
motif CKS17, and the disulfide bonded loop C(X)6CC
that precede the TM region in many retroviruses [43,56].
Thus, despite its position and its homology with the TERV
predicted envelope, the identity of the ORF3 product as an
envelope protein is still uncertain, given its limited similarity with other retroviral envelope proteins.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
Differences between the sequence of chicken Ovex1 transcripts and the genomic galGal3 draft assembly are exclusively point substitutions reported in additional file 6
(Table S7, Polymorphisms in chicken Ovex1 sequences).
Among 14 substitutions in Gag, Pol and ORF3 coding
sequences, 12 are silent. These differences reflect the polymorphism between two types of Gallus gallus derived
from a common ancestor: the wild Red Jungle fowl and
the domestic White Leghorn strain. In addition, direct
sequencing of RT-PCR products from pools of gonads
allowed the detection of the presence of two nucleotides
in variable proportions at some positions of the sequence.
This heterogeneity is presumably due to polymorphism
within the Leghorn chicken population. Some of these

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/59

differences are also found in ESTs. In the sequence coding
for Gag-Pol, these SNPs correspond to silent differences.
In ORF3, conservative and non-conservative substitutions
are observed.

Comparison with other retroviral elements
To classify Ovex1 amongst retroviral sequences according
to the criteria defined by Jern [35], we may recall general
characteristics. (i) The Gag-Pro-Pol coding sequences are in
the same frame and translation of the Pro-Pol polyprotein
results likely from the translational suppression of the Gag
stop-codon, as in gamma-, epsilon- and intermediate
epsilon-like retroviruses. (ii) The putative Gag protein
contains no zinc finger, as in spumaviruses and spumarelated HERV-L and MuERV-L [43,57]. This is in contrast
to the SnRV, which displays some similarity with Ovex1
Gag but has one zinc finger. (iii) No dUTPase domain was
detected, unlike in MuERV-L. The absence of the integrase
GPY/F motif is not discriminating as for spuma-like
viruses, since a degenerated sequence may be present. A
single splicing event and no obvious accessory ORFs were
found in Ovex1, unlike in complex retroviruses like SnRV,
WEHV and spumaviruses. In the analysis, it is necessary to
distinguish the Gag-Pol and the ORF3 regions of Ovex1.

Presence of Ovex1-related sequences in other birds
To investigate the presence of sequences related to Ovex1
in the genome of other birds, we performed PCR amplifications with primers corresponding to Ovex1 Gag and RT
regions, using DNA from turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),
guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos). Direct sequencing of the fragments gave unique
sequences, corresponding to ORFs highly similar to those
obtained from chicken. The 132-bp-long Gag fragment,
which contains the nuclear localization signals, has no
analog in nucleic-acid and protein databases. Conservation for turkey, guinea fowl and duck with respect to
chicken is 98%, 96% and 92% at the nucleotide level and
100%, 100% and 98% at the protein level. The 400-bplong RT fragments present 94%, 92% and 84% of nucleotide conservation. Although it is not proven that the
amplified Gag and Pol sequences are linked in the DNA of
turkey, guinea fowl and duck, the result suggests that
Ovex1 orthologs exist in these birds. Alignment of the protein sequences is shown in additional file 4 (Figure S5,
Alignment of Ovex1 protein sequences). Amino-acid identity scores for the RT fragments range from 93% between
chicken and turkey to 76% between chicken and zebra
finch (Fig. 4B). By comparison, identity with the closest
known retrovirus, SpeV, is only 42%. The neighbor-joining tree based on the alignment of the five Ovex1 RT
sequences (Fig. 4C) follows the bird phylogenetic relationship shown in Fig. 4A.

The second region of chicken and zebra finch Ovex1, corresponding to the third ORF, is partially related to
GGLTR11, a class I ERV, which is not the case for Pol. Similarity with Bonasa TERV is limited to the transmembrane
domain of the putative TERV's envelope. TERV is a defective endogenous retrovirus devoid of Pol that has been
classified as an alpharetrovirus on the basis of its LTRs and
Gag region but, according to the authors, the truncated
Env might have a different origin [54]. Similarly in Ovex1,
ORF3 and Gag-Pol might originate from different
retroviruses.
Analysis of chicken Ovex1 expression by RT-PCR
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR amplification of Ovex1 transcripts in various 8-day chicken embryo tissues shows that
the unspliced Gag-Pol mRNA and the spliced ORF3-containing transcript are expressed in a similar manner (Fig.
5A). Expression is higher in the left ovary than in the right
one, lower in the left testis, and absent in the right testis.

RT is the most conserved retroviral domain generally used
for phylogenetic analysis, allowing detection of the relationship between distant elements [58]. We performed
the alignment of a 159-amino-acid sequence of chicken
and zebra finch putative RTs (Gag-Pol polyprotein residues 759 to 917) to that of representative retroviral elements and retroviruses, using ClustalW2 (see Additional
file 7 (Figure S8, Alignment of Ovex1 RT and homologous
sequences). The derived neighbor-joining unrooted dendrogram presented in Fig. 4D displays three groups of
sequences. They correspond to the class I and class II of
retroviral elements and to a third group more dispersed
(similar to group I in [59]) that contains class III elements
and the intermediate epsilon-like retrovirus SnRV [34,35].
Ovex1 RT is not closely related to any known avian retroviral sequence. On the basis of this analysis, Ovex1 does
not belong to class II. Despite some similarity with the
epsilonretroviruses WEHV and WDSV, it is not included
either in class I elements. It appears more related to the
third group of sequences. However, its relation with members of this group is not well defined. Ovex1 does not cluster with spumaviruses or spuma-related elements MuERVL and HERV-L. It is not either similar to the Repbase
GGERV-L element [36] or to avian sequences like ENS-3
(Chicken Embryonic Normal Stem cell gene 3) [60] and
the bird Tinamou retrovirus [59]. Ovex1's closest relative
is the Sphenodon endogenous virus, SpeV, found in an
archaic reptile [47]. So far, only the Pro and RT domains
of this endogenous virus are known, and they are the most
similar to Ovex1. Ovex1 and SpeV constitute a distinct
branch of the RT-based phylogenetic tree, close to the
branch point of SnRV and spumaviruses. However, Ovex1
and SpeV are distantly related since their RT identity score
is only 42%, which is not higher than between some
members of different classes.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Ovex1 expression in
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Ovex1 expression in chicken tissues. (A) Expression of Ovex1 in 8-day
embryo tissues. RT-PCR was performed with pairs of primers designed to amplify specifically the unspliced mRNA (GagPol) or the spliced transcript (ORF3). Amplification of GAPDH
transcripts was used as control for mRNA amounts. Primers
and RT-PCR conditions are given in additional file 9 (Table
S1, Primers and PCR conditions). A similar pattern of expression is observed in both cases. The level of transcripts is
higher in the left ovary than in the right one and in the left
testis. Expression is null in the right testis and in the other
tissues tested, but for occasional traces in the wing. (B)
Expression of Ovex1 in chicken gonads, as a function of age.
The unspliced and spliced mRNAs were amplified from 8and 12-day embryo left (L) or right (R) gonads, from 18-day
embryo left gonads, and from adult (7 weeks) left ovaries or
mixed (LR) testes. The identity of the RT-PCR amplified
product was verified by sequencing. A control with chicken
genomic DNA was performed in order to verify the absence
of the deleted form in the genome and the specificity of
amplification. The level of both types of mRNAs is up-regulated in the left ovary, weak in the right one, down-regulated
after 8 days in the left testis, and null in the right one.
Amplification is negative for the other tissues investigated
(mesonephros, heart, brain, liver), but for traces in the
wings. In female embryos, expression of both types of
transcripts is asymmetrical at 8 and 12 days (Fig. 5B). The
highest expression is found in the adult (left) ovary. The
expression observed in the left testis at 8 days is down-regulated at 12 days and after, and the right testis remains
negative.
In situ hybridization

hybridization using a probe corresponding to the Pol

region and compared with that of other genes expressed in
the gonads. In both sexes, the region of the presumptive
gonad can be first identified at four days of incubation
(E4) (Hamburger and Hamilton stage 24, HH24) by the
expression of the Lim homeobox gene, Lhx9, in a
restricted area of the mesonephros coelomic epithelium
[4,61]. At this stage, neither the transcripts of Ovex1 nor
those of the estrogen receptor alpha ER- are detected in
this region (not shown).
At E5 (HH27) (Fig. 6A), male and female gonads, morphologically indistinguishable, are protrusions at the surface of the mesonephroi. They comprise two territories:
the outer epithelial area or "cortex", negative for fibronectin, and the inner region, or "medulla", containing irregular groups of cells separated by strands of fibronectinpositive material [4,7]. The two gonads are not identical:
the left one is larger and has a thicker cortex. The pattern
of expression of the studied markers is the same for male
and female embryos. Ovex1 starts to be transcribed with a
L/R asymmetry. Transcripts are present in the apical
region of the cortex of left gonads, whereas they are not
detected in right ones or in the mesonephros and surrounding tissues. Lhx9 is transcribed in the totality of the
cortex of both gonads, and in part of the dorsal mesentery
epithelium. At the same time, ER- starts to be expressed
asymmetrically in the cortex of left gonads and symmetrically in the medulla of the both, as reported [14,15].
At E6 (HH28) (Fig. 6B) in both sexes, the cortex is thicker
in left gonads. In the female (ZW), Ovex1 is now detected
in both gonads, but with a very dissimilar distribution. In
the left ovary, it is expressed in the columnar cortical cells
of the medioventral region, whereas in the right gonad a
few Ovex1-expressing cells are scattered throughout the
medulla. In the male (ZZ), expression of Ovex1 is visible
in the medioventral region of the left testis cortex, whereas
no expression is detected in the right gonad.
At E7.5 (HH31), the morphological L/R asymmetry of the
female gonads is even more evident. In the left ovary (Fig.
6C), the thickening cortex, constituted of multiplying
oogonia and somatic cells, is bordered by a single epithelial-cell layer. The medulla contains loosely connected
cords of epithelial cells. Ovex1 is highly expressed in the
cortical region including the surface epithelial cells, and
also to a lower extent in the medullar cords. Likewise Lhx9
and ER- are expressed in the cortex and more faintly in
the medulla, but the patterns are not strictly identical.
Ovex1 and ER- transcripts are not detected at the lateral
ends of the gonad, where the thickness of the cortex
diminishes. Oogonia, identified by the chicken vasa
homolog, Cvh, a germ cell-specific factor of the DEAD-box
family [62], are mostly located in the depth of the cortex,
although rarely some are dispersed in the medulla. If a

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/59

germ-cell expression of Ovex1 cannot be fully excluded, it
is clear at this stage that most of the cells that express
Ovex1 in the left gonad are somatic cells and not germ
cells. FoxL2, the female-specific forkhead transcription
factor [28,63], is transcribed exclusively in the medulla in
cordonal cells.
In the smaller right ovary (Fig. 6D), the cortex has not
undergone the same development and the medulla represents the major part of the gonad. Ovex1 transcripts are
completely absent from the cortical region but are present
in some dispersed medullar cells. Similarly, ER- is only
expressed in the medulla as reported [9,10]. Lhx9 is
expressed in the thin cortical region and in dispersed
medullar cells, whereas FoxL2 is expressed in patches in
the major part of the gonad but absent from the surface
region. A few germ cells are present in the gonad.
At this stage, the morphological L/R asymmetry of the
gonads is less obvious in males. Testicular differentiation
becomes morphologically visible in both gonads. Sertoli
cells, that start to express Sox9 and a high level of AMH,
are clustering to form the sex cords [7]. A weak expression
of Ovex1 is observed in the thin surface epithelium of the
left testis (Fig. 6E), but none in the right one (Fig. 6F). No
expression is detected in the medullas. Lhx9, by contrast,
is expressed in the cortex of both gonads (Figs. 6E and 6F).
Expression of ER- is asymmetrical. Only the left testis
displays a cortical expression whereas a faint symmetrical
presence of transcripts is detected in both medullas (compare Figs. 6E and 6F), as reported [14,15]. Germ cells,
more numerous in the left testis than in the right one, are
dispersed in the gonads (Figs. 6E and 6F). At this stage,
germ cells display a mostly peripheral distribution, a
rather puzzling situation because Sertoli cells are clustering in the central part of the medulla to form the sex cords
in which these germ cells are to be enclosed, as previously
observed [4].
In the male, Ovex1 expression remains limited. At E12
(HH38), left and right testes appear morphologically
rather similar. In both gonads, testis cords have formed
into the medulla, containing germ cells and supporting
Sertoli cells surrounded by a basal membrane. The malespecific marker Sox9 identifies the Sertoli cells that express
also AMH. In the left testis, Ovex1 transcription is
restricted to a small apical zone where the epithelium is
thicker (Fig. 6G). It is still absent in the right testis (not
shown). At E18, Ovex1 transcripts are no longer detected
in the left testis (not shown). Disappearance of Ovex1
transcription in the left testis is coincident with that of
Pitx2c [14] and ER- [10].
At E14 (Fig. 7A), the well-developed cortex of the left
ovary, overlaid by a single epithelial-cell layer, is com-

posed of fibronectin-negative regions separated by strands
of fibronectin-positive material, often in continuity with
the medulla, infiltrating sometimes up to the surface cell
layer. The fibronectin-positive medulla is formed of
groups of loosely connected cells and contains lacunae in
its inner region. The interface between cortex and medulla
is underlined by a thick deposit of fibronectin. The cortical fibronectin-negative nests contain clusters of germ
cells and somatic cells. Germ cells are identified by the
expression of Cvh and of the pre-meiotic factor Stra8 [64].
Somatic cells express Lhx9. Ovex1 is highly transcribed in
cells located at the inner side of these cortical nests and
faintly expressed in the gonad surface cell layer. At this
stage, the high density of germ and somatic cells intermingled in the cortical nests does not allow to exclude that
Ovex1 might be expressed in both cell types. Groups of
Ovex1-positive cells are also dispersed within the subcortical region of the medulla. Lhx9 transcripts are totally
absent from the medulla. The dispersed FoxL2 expression
is limited to the medulla and AMH transcripts are located
in the subcortical region of the medulla and in the
fibronectin-positive cortical strands, as previously
reported [4]. The degenerating right female gonad, relatively small and devoid of cortex, has no longer been
studied.
Around hatching (P1) (Fig. 7B) occurs a dramatic remodeling of the left ovarian cortex. This is a prelude to folliculogenesis. The gonad surface cell layer, which has become
negative for Ovex1, undergoes local disruptions leading to
a sort of peeling. Exfoliation is initiated by apoptosis of
superficial cells, as seen by TUNEL labeling (Additional
file 8 (Figure S9, Detection of apoptotic cells in chicken
ovary at hatching)). The desquamated surface of the
gonad becomes jagged, with irregular cracks and protuberances. The phenomenon is emphasized by the intense
expression of Ovex1 in cells that form a nearly continuous
but irregular layer, especially visible in the bottom of the
cracks. This layer appears to form a barrier resisting the
desquamation process. At this stage, FoxL2 is expressed as
previously in the medulla, more specifically in the juxtacortical region, but now also in some cells located on the
cortical side of the fibronectin deposit that delimits cortex
and medulla (shown by arrows). Wnt4 expression in the
gonad is almost undetectable.
Folliculogenesis starts in the left ovary after hatching, and
is completed by 22 days [65]. One week after hatching, at
P7 (Fig. 7C), the limit between cortex and medulla
becomes undefined. Small follicular structures expressing
high levels of Ovex1 are observed near or at the surface of
the desquamated ovary. It is also in these structures that a
low FoxL2 expression is now visible and where Wnt4 starts
to be expressed. These cells express also AMH, as illustrated in [4]. At previous stages, expression of this hor-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/59

mone was restricted to cells of the fibronectin-positive
regions, as seen in Fig. 7A.
At P14 (Fig. 7D), follicles of various sizes are present at the
periphery of the ovary, the smaller ones (the last formed)
being the most external. They are constituted of a single
oocyte surrounded by a layer of somatic cells. These follicular cells (also called granulosa cells) express Ovex1 at a
high level, FoxL2, AMH, and in addition Wnt4 as shown
in [4]. At this stage, folliculogenesis appears uncompleted
because a layer of Ovex1-positive cells remains close to the
surface of the gonad.
At P28 (Fig. 7E), the ovary that has acquired an important
development is highly folded. Cells expressing Ovex1,
FoxL2, and AMH, as well as Wnt4 (not shown) are essentially the granulosa cells of the follicles.
Effect of the inhibition of estrogen synthesis on Ovex1
expression
Estrogens play an essential role in ovarian differentiation.
Aromatase, the key enzyme that converts androgens to
estrogens, is expressed in female gonads from E5-E6. A
possible involvement of estrogens in Ovex1 up-regulation
after E6 in the left ovarian cortex and in the medulla of
both female gonads, where the estrogen receptor ER- is
present, was thus investigated. Fadrozole (CGS 16949A),
a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, was injected into the
eggs at E4 to prevent estrogen synthesis, and the embryonic gonads examined at E14. Fadrozole treatment has
been shown to lead to female to male sex reversal. The
right gonad differentiates into a testis and the left one into
an ovotestis or a testis. This is characterized by impairment of cortex development, decrease of aromatase synthesis, and formation of testicular cords expressing the
testicular marker SOX9 and elevated levels of AMH and
DMRT1 transcripts [22,27,66,67]. By comparison with the
E14 control ovary (Fig. 7A), it is evident in Fig. 8 that the
left gonad of the fadrozole-treated female is masculinized,
with a thin cortical region and important medulla containing epithelial cords and lacunae. Ovex1 expression is
extremely reduced in this gonad in the medulla as in the
remnants of the cortical region. Conversely, Sox9, which is
not normally transcribed in female gonads, and AMH are
expressed in internal epithelial structures that resemble
testis cords.

Discussion
Characterization of Ovex1 as endogenous retrovirus
The SSH technique used in this study was designed to
identify genes transcribed preferentially in the chicken
embryo left ovary and thus potentially involved in the differentiation of this gonad. It revealed the existence of a
locus that we called Ovex1 according to its expression pattern. Ovex1 has a structure similar to that of simple endog-

enous retroviruses, with ORFs coding for potential
proteins related to retroviral Gag and Pro-Pol polyproteins and a third one (ORF3) which displays only a faint
similarity with retroviral envelope proteins. In the chicken
ovary a full-length genomic mRNA and a singly spliced
subgenomic transcript encoding only the third protein are
present. Translation of the Pro-Pol ORF results presumably
from read-through of the Gag stop-codon, like in gamma,
epsilon and intermediate epsilon-like retroviruses.
A homologous sequence was found in the genome of
zebra finch, a distantly related bird species. The location
of these sequences, at similar positions in synthenic chromosomes, indicates an orthologous relationship. Partial
sequences corresponding to Gag and Pol regions were also
detected in turkey, guinea fowl and duck, suggesting the
presence of similar genes in these species. Protein similarity of the five Ovex1 RT fragments follows the phylogenetic relationship of the bird species. This relation is
indicative of the vertical transmission of an ERV integrated into the genome of a common ancestor of these
birds, therefore before the split between Galloanserae
(chicken, turkey, guinea fowl, duck...) and Neoaves (zebra
finch...) some 122 Myr (million years) ago [68]. Investigation for similar sequences in Paleognathae (tinamou and
ratites), which diverged from the lineage leading to other

birds 139 Myr ago, would be necessary to ascertain the
precise time of insertion.
Available data indicate that only one copy of the Ovex1
Gag-Pol region exists in the genome of chicken and zebra
finch, in contrast to most ERVs that constitute families of
related sequences derived from an initial integrated virus.
This region is not closely related to other known avian retroviruses. According to the RT-based phylogenetic analysis, Ovex1 is mostly related to SnRV and class III retroviral
elements but its relationship with these elements is very
distant. Its closest relative is SpeV, an endogenous retrovirus of the tuatara (Sphenodon), last representative of an
archaic reptilian lineage that already existed 220 Myr ago
[69]. However the identity is rather low. In SpeV, only a
part of the Pro and RT domains have been sequenced and
the comparison is limited. More information would be
required to confirm the relationship of these ERVs.
In contrast, the region of Ovex 1 ORF3 and the 3'UTR contain sequences similar to an ERV I repeated element and a
fragment of CR1 that are similarly located in chicken and
zebra finch DNA. This means that Ovex1 is likely a composite element and that the recombination events
occurred in an ancestral genome before divergence of the
two bird clades 122 Myr ago. Such a chimerism resulting
from exchange of Pol and Env is frequently observed in the
ERVs [56].
The obvious deficiency of chicken and zebra finch Ovex1
in comparison with other ERVs is the absence of identifiable LTRs. However, two imperfect direct repeats, located
in the regions at the start and end of the transcription unit
are the presumable remnants of former LTRs. Retroviral
LTRs, generated from a single template during reverse
transcription of RNA into DNA, are identical at the time
of integration into the host genome. Over time, they will
diverge in sequence because of mutations occurring during cellular DNA replication. Differences between the two
repeats can be used to estimate the time that has elapsed
since the ERV integration [32]. The lack of full LTRs and
the high divergence of the remaining 5' and 3' repeats are
consistent with the ancient origin of Ovex1.
The great majority of ERVs, having suffered random mutations since their insertion, have accumulated deletions,
frameshifts and stop-codons that interrupt their ORFs
[70]. In chicken Ovex1, all three ORFs are uninterrupted
(though small deletions or local frameshifts might have
remained undetected) and in zebra finch at least two of
them. This is a rare event, unless the ERV has a very recent
origin, which is not the case. In vivo translation of Ovex1
transcripts remains to demonstrate. However, conservation of the ORFs suggests the existence of a selection pressure acting to retain not only the RNA but also the

Page 16 of 24

Retrovirology 2009, 6:59

encoded proteins. The effect of selection can be revealed
by comparing the rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) nucleotide substitutions in chicken and
zebra finch coding sequences [71]. dN/dS ratios <1 indicate the effect of a purifying selection acting to eliminate
divergent protein sequences. Gag is under a strong purifying selection, with a dN/dS ratio of 0.08, close to the mean
value (0.085) for genes located on macrochromosomes
[72]. Pol and ORF3, with dN/dS ratios of 0.18 and 0.16,
display less constraint in the purifying selection. In addition, we detected a certain number of single nucleotide
substitutions between the wild Red Jungle fowl and the
White Leghorn chicken, a domestic strain derived from
the same Gallus gallus ancestor after some 10,000 years of
domestication [31]. Most of these substitutions are silent
(as seen in additional file 6 (Table S7, Polymorphisms in
chicken Ovex1 sequences)). This is in support of an ongoing purifying selection that appears more stringent for Gag
and Pol than for ORF3.
Ovex1, devoid of homologous LTRs, is likely unable to
propagate its sequence. Gag and Pol have retained enough
conservation to be identified, but are nevertheless considerably different from proteins of other retroviruses.
Important amino-acid residues implicated in viral
enzyme activity are not present in chicken and zebra finch
Ovex1 sequences whereas they are conserved in all retroviruses including Ovex1's closest relative, SpeV. RT and
Int, if translated, are presumably inactive. The protein
encoded by ORF3, if it is an envelope protein, appears also
highly defective. Conservation of uninterrupted retroviral
ORFs during more than 100 Myr despite the presence of a
high number of presumably invalidating mutations can
hardly occur just by chance and might indicate that these
proteins fulfill some unknown biological function and are
useful to the host.
Expression of Ovex1 in chicken gonads
The in situ hybridization study shows that expression of
Ovex1 is restricted to specific cells of the gonads and thus
tightly controlled. This expression is characterized by L/R
asymmetry and is dependent on sex differentiation. In
both sexes, Ovex1 transcription is initiated at E5 in the cortex of left gonads before the onset of evident sex differentiation. At this stage, asymmetry of the gonads is already
determined by the asymmetrical expression of Pitx2c in
the epithelium of the left coelomic cavity, including the
genital ridge [14]. In both sexes, Pitx2c inhibition of retinoic acid synthesis allows expression of ER- and SF-1 and
cortical cell proliferation in the left gonad [15]. The patterns of expression of Pitx2c [15] and Ovex1 at E5 and their
transient expression in the left testis are rather similar, and
it is plausible that Pitx2c controls Ovex1 expression,
directly or indirectly. In this context, the presence of a conserved Pitx2 responsive element in the promoter region of

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/59

chicken and zebra finch Ovex1 is interesting and deserves
further study.
From E6 thereon, aromatase, the key enzyme of estrogen
synthesis, is present in female gonads, not in male ones.
Consequently, in female embryos, the cortex of the left
gonad and both medullas, where the estrogen receptor
ER- is present, become direct physiological targets of
estrogens. After E6 in the female, an increased and sustained transcription of Ovex1 occurs in the cortex of the
left ovary and a low expression is observed in the medulla
of both gonads. In the male, the cortical region of the left
testis able to express Ovex1 becomes more and more limited. As Pitx2c [14], Ovex1 is no longer expressed at E18.
The absence of Ovex1 transcription in testicular medullas
suggests that estrogen stimulation might be required for
the medullar expression. Estrogen deprivation by fadrozole treatment leads to the masculinization of female
gonads with an inhibition of the left ovarian cortex development and the apparition in the medulla of epithelial
structures analogous to testis cords. Ovex1 expression is
strongly decreased in the medulla as well as in remnants
of the cortical region, showing the requirement for estrogens to get a sustained expression. This effect might be due
to a direct action of estrogens on the Ovex1 promoter but
reflects also the role of the hormone in proliferation and/
or differentiation of cortical and medullar cells able to
express Ovex1.
During the embryonic differentiation of the ovary, most
of the Ovex1-expressing cells are tightly associated with
germ cells in the left cortex (or in close vicinity in the subcortical medulla). After hatching, they constitute the granulosa cell layer surrounding the oocyte in the forming
follicles. This is in contrast with other markers of the granulosa like FoxL2, AMH and Wnt4 [4], which are not
expressed in cortical cells during embryogenesis, but in
the medullar compartment, and start to be expressed in
granulosa cells only when follicles form. The continuity of
expression of Ovex1 makes this factor an interesting
marker of the filiation between cortical somatic cells and
granulosa cells.
The expression of Ovex1 enlightens the dramatic remodeling of the ovarian cortical surface that occurs around
hatching preceding the folliculogenesis. The previously
compact cortex, which contained nests of tightly packed
meiotic germ cells and somatic cells covered by a continuous surface cell layer, suffers an important morphological change. The surface cell layer loses Ovex1 expression;
patches of cells undergo apoptosis, and local disruptions
lead to an exfoliation of the superficial region of the cortex. Ovex1-expressing cells appear to constitute a barrier
resisting the desquamation process before follicle formation. A more limited phenomenon has been observed by

scanning electron microscopy in human and mouse ovaries. The extrusion of germ cells and satellite somatic cells
through temporary breaks of the ovarian surface epithelium under the pressure of the subjacent highly proliferating tissue has been reported [73].
Putative roles of Ovex1 in the gonads
Ovex1 expression constitutes an interesting marker of
ovarian morphogenesis in chicken, but can it be an actor
in this process? In the male, the transient Ovex1 transcription in the left testis is dispensable for testis function since
the right gonad becomes a functional testis despite the
absence of Ovex1 expression. The same conclusion cannot
be drawn for female gonads.

ERV transcription in vertebrates is not an exception and
displays variable tissue specificity [33,74]. In mammals,
expression of several ERV envelopes is detected in various
cancer cells, in particular ovarian cancers [75] and in several normal tissues [55,76]. However, the role of these retroviral proteins in vertebrate cells – if they are translated –
is not often known. The unique but prototypical example
is the recruitment of the fusogenic properties of retroviral
envelopes for the specific mammalian function of placenta morphogenesis. HERV-W and HERV-FRD envelope
proteins, named syncytin 1 and 2, are responsible for trophoblast cell fusion in placenta syncytiotrophoblast formation in humans [77,78]. Envelope proteins of various
retroviruses have been independently recruited to fulfill
the same function in other mammals [79,80]. However, it
does not seem that embryonic ovary differentiation
involves cell fusion. Another positive role of ERVs for the
vertebrate host is protecting cells against infection by
viruses of the same family. Endogenous envelope proteins
saturate viral cell receptors, thus preventing exogenous
virus entry. In addition, the Gag protein of MuERV has
been shown to be closely related to the murine Fv1 gene
that controls the replication of MMLV and prevents disease in mice infected by this retrovirus [43]. Such a role
might be useful in the ovary.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/59

functions, in particular if the putative envelope possess
fusogenic properties. Alternatively, these proteins might
have acquired new functions. The presence of nuclear
localization signals and of a leucine zipper motif in Ovex1
Gag protein suggests a possible role in nuclear
regulations.
In a recent screening for ESTs present in adult hen ovarian
follicles, an EST [GenBank:EC912004] that corresponds
to Ovex1 has been found to be expressed at a rate 6-time
lower in hen ovaries of a chicken strain selected for its
high egg production, compared with another strain with
low egg production [81]. Ovex1, which is expressed in
supporting somatic cells in close contact with germ cells
in the embryonic cortex and in follicles up to adulthood,
might play a role in regulating hen fertility at different
stages: germ cell proliferation, meiosis, folliculogenesis,
follicular survival or rate of follicle recruitment.

Conclusion
Ovex1 is an ERV present in both chicken and zebra finch
genomes. Similar sequences are detected in three other
domestic birds. Sequencing of more bird and reptile
genomes will presumably enlarge the family of Ovex1containing species. Unlike most ERVs that are represented
in the host genome by a family of related sequences, most
of the Ovex1 sequence (Gag and Pol regions) exists as a
unique copy in the genome of chicken and zebra finch.
However, these genomes are not fully investigated and
random divergence of elements inserted more than 100
Myr ago may impair their identification. The conserved
copy of this ERV might have been preserved because of a
specific function. Specifically expressed in the gonads,
Ovex1 constitutes an interesting marker of the granulosa
cell lineage useful for the study of ovarian morphogenesis.
The future objective will be to determine if it is only a witness or if it is an actor. The involvement of a retroviral element in crucial processes of the ovarian development
would be very exciting.

Methods
It is noticeable that Ovex1 is not the only retroviral
sequence expressed in the embryonic chicken ovary. FET1 (female expressed transcript 1), a W-chromosome gene
asymmetrically expressed in the left ovarian cortex
between E4.5 and E6 has also a retroviral origin [2,11].
We found that it is similar to the consensus GGLTR7A retrovirus (described in RepBase) [36] over 87% of its length
and encodes potentially an Env-like protein with similarity to the HERV-FRD Env protein (syncytin 2). A common
role and/or a common regulation of FET-1 and Ovex1
might be investigated. To speculate further about the function of Ovex1 (and FET-1) in the ovary, it would be necessary first to establish whether the encoded proteins are
actually translated, and if so, whether they retain viral

Commercial White Leghorn chicken eggs were incubated
at 38°C. Development stages (HH) are defined according
to Hamburger and Hamilton [82]. Embryonic left and
right gonads were dissected, collected individually into
RNA-later solution (Qiagen), and stored at -80°C. Young
embryos (up to E8) were genetically sexed by PCR [4] on
DNA purified from extragonadal tissues with the NucleoSpin tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel). Total RNA was purified
from pools of male or female, left or right gonads (35
gonads, about 18 mg of tissues for E8 embryos), using the
RNeasy RNA mini extraction kit (Qiagen), with DNase
treatment.

Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH)
The suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique [37] was used to select transcripts expressed at a
higher level in the left ovary than in the right one of E8
female chicken embryos. The cDNAs were prepared and
amplified from total RNA of left or right ovaries, using the
SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (BD Biosciences Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To
generate the first strand, 1 g of total RNA was reversetranscribed with an oligo-dT containing primer (CDS),
using PowerScript reverse transcriptase (BD Biosciences
Clontech). Bicatenar cDNA was produced using the
SMART II 5'-anchored primer and amplified by PCR for
15 cycles. SSH was performed with the PCR-Select cDNA
Subtraction kit (BD Biosciences Clontech) according to
the user's manual. The two amplified cDNA populations
were digested with the restriction enzyme RsaI. After
digestion, the left ovary cDNAs (LO) were subtracted
against the right ovary cDNAs (RO), giving a cDNA pool
enriched in left ovary transcripts (LO-RO). Conversely,
the right ovary cDNAs were subtracted against the left
ovary cDNAs, giving a cDNA pool enriched in right ovary
transcripts (RO-LO). The efficiency of normalization and
subtraction was assayed by comparing the abundance of
the constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase cDNA in initial and subtracted cDNA
pools, using chicken-specific PCR primers (cGAPDHs:
5'ACCACTGTCCATGCCATCAC3',
cGAPDHa:
5'TCCACAACACGGTTGCTGTA3').
Cloning of the subtracted cDNA fragments
(LO-RO) subtracted cDNA fragments were cloned into
pGEMT-easy plasmid (Promega), to construct a (LO-RO)
subtracted cDNA library. Two hundred and fifty individual colonies were randomly selected, grown in 96-well
plates in 100 L LB medium plus ampicillin for 14 hours
at 37°C and frozen at -80°C after addition of 10%
glycerol.
Differential hybridization screening
Differential hybridization screening was performed to
identify the cDNA clones displaying the greatest asymmetry of expression between left and right gonads. A procedure adapted from the PCR-Select differential screening
kit user's manual (BD Biosciences Clontech) was used
with the following differences. The (LO-RO) cDNA clone
library was used to prepare macroarrays. The insert of each
clone was PCR-amplified, using PCR-Select nested primers 1 (5'TCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT3') and 2R
(5'AGCGTGGTCGCGGCCGAGGT3'). Four identical
macroarrays were prepared by spotting 2-L aliquots of
each PCR reaction mixture on nylon membranes
(Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Denaturation of the DNA was achieved by blotting the membranes
onto 0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl-impregnated Whatman 3

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/59

MM paper for 2 min, followed by neutralization with 0.5
M Tris-HCl pH7.4, 1.5 M NaCl for 5 min and 3xSSC for 5
min, under the same conditions. Dry membranes were
then exposed to ultraviolet light (0.6 J/cm2) to perform
DNA cross-linking. The membranes were hybridized with
radioactive probes corresponding to the subtracted and
non-subtracted cDNA pools: LO-RO, RO-LO, LO, and
RO. 32P labeled probes were prepared by random priming
(Invitrogen Random primers DNA labeling system).
Hybridization was performed as described previously
[83]. Denatured herring sperm DNA (100 g/mL) and 3
g/mL each of PCR-Select nested primers 1 and 2R, antinested primer 1: (5'ACCTGCCCGGGCGGCCGCTCGA3')
and
anti-nested
primer
2R
(5'ACCTCGGCCGCGACCACGCT3') were added to the
hybridization solution to prevent unspecific hybridization of the PCR-Select adaptator sequences. Membranes
were subjected to autoradiography and the intensity of the
spots quantified using the ImageJ software. The clones displaying the highest ratios of (LO-RO) versus (RO-LO)
hybridization were selected. The inserts were sequenced
by automated fluorescence sequencing (MWG Biotech
France), using pGEMT-specific primers.
Determination of the complete Ovex1 sequence
Primers derived from the genomic sequence were used to
amplify by RT-PCR overlapping cDNA fragments from E8
left ovary RNA. Reverse transcription was performed by
random priming on 2 g total RNA using SuperScript II
Rnase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed on 1/20th of the cDNA product
(equivalent to 100 ng of RNA), with 10 g/mL of the PCR
primer pairs listed in additional file 9 (Table S1, Primers
and PCR conditions). The mixture contained 67 mM TrisHCl (pH8.8), 17 mM (NH4)2SO4, 6.7 mM MgCl2, 10 mM
2-mercaptoethanol, 6.7 M EDTA, 10% (v/v) dimethylsulphoxide, 0.5 mM each of the four dNTP, and 2 units of
EurobioTaq polymerase (Eurobio) in a final volume of 50
L. Hot start was performed by addition of the Taq
polymerase after 5 min of preincubation at 80° and followed by 30 cycles of amplification (45 s at 95°, 45 s at
57°, and 180 s at 72°). After analysis for purity of the PCR
product by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the PCR
reaction mixture was treated with ExoSap-It (USB) to
remove primers and nucleotides and used for direct
sequencing of the fragments in both directions (MWG
Biotech France).
Determination of cDNA ends
5' and 3' cDNA fragments were isolated by the rapid
amplification of cDNA end methods (5'RACE and
3'RACE) using total RNA purified from E12 left ovaries.
Amplification was performed with the SMART RACE
cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences Clontech),
according to the manufacturer's instructions, using

SMART universal primers and the gene specific primers
indicated in additional file 9 (Table S1, Primers and PCR
conditions). The amplification products were analyzed by
electrophoresis on agarose gel and the main band, purified with NucleoSpin extract II (Macherey Nagel), was
cloned into pGEMT-easy vector (Promega). At least 5
independent recombinant clones were sequenced in each
experiment.

software [87]. The ORF map and the hydrophobicity plot
calculated according to Kyte and Doolittle [88] were created with the DNA Strider program [89]. Protein structure
was analyzed with Psort version II http://mobyle.pas
teur.fr and N-glycosylation sites predicted by the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/. Synonymous and

Gene expression analysis by semi-quantitative RT-PCR
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to determine
the specificity of expression of Ovex1. Experimental conditions were as described above, except for the use of 1/
100th of the RT product (equivalent to 20 ng RNA). The
number of PCR cycles was limited and optimized in each
case. Primer pairs, hybridization temperatures and
number of cycles are given in additional file 9 (Table S1,
Primers and PCR conditions). Elongation at 72° was for
75 s. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on

In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed on Leghorn gonad
cryostat sections as described previously [7], using antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes. Lhx9 and Cvh
probes have already been described [4]. Other probes
were prepared from cloned RT-PCR fragments, according
to the same procedure. The FoxL2, Stra8 and ER- probes
correspond respectively to [GenBank:AY155534] (nucleotides 1 to 330), [GenBank:XM_416179] (nt 121 to 825)
and [EMBL:X03805] (nt 827 to1752). For Ovex1, a Pol
probe corresponding to nucleotides 2511 to 3245 was
used in the experiments reported. Hybridization of a 3'UTR probe (nt 8633 to 8919) gave similar results. Hybridization with sense probes was negative. Apoptotic cells
were detected by the TUNEL method, using In Situ Cell
Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche), on frozen sections previously treated for in situ hybridization. After PBS
washing, sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with the TUNEL Label Mixture containing terminal transferase.
