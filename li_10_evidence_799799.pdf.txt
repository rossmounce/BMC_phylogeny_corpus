Abstract
Background: The Tarim Basin, located on the ancient Silk Road, played a very important role in the history of
human migration and cultural communications between the West and the East. However, both the exact period at
which the relevant events occurred and the origins of the people in the area remain very obscure. In this paper,
we present data from the analyses of both Y chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) derived from human
remains excavated from the Xiaohe cemetery, the oldest archeological site with human remains discovered in the
Tarim Basin thus far.
Results: Mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that the Xiaohe people carried both the East Eurasian haplogroup (C)
and the West Eurasian haplogroups (H and K), whereas Y chromosomal DNA analysis revealed only the West
Eurasian haplogroup R1a1a in the male individuals.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the Xiaohe people were an admixture from populations originating
from both the West and the East, implying that the Tarim Basin had been occupied by an admixed population
since the early Bronze Age. To our knowledge, this is the earliest genetic evidence of an admixed population
settled in the Tarim Basin.

Background
The Tarim Basin in western China, positioned at a critical site on the ancient Silk Road, has played a significant
role in the history of human migration, cultural developments and communications between the East and the
West. It became famous due to the discovery of many
well-preserved mummies within the area. These mummies, especially the prehistoric Bronze Age ‘Caucasoid’
mummies, such as the ‘Beauty of Loulan’, have attracted
extensive interest among scientists regarding who were
these people and where did they come from.
Based on analyses of human remains and other
archaeological materials from the ancient cemeteries
(dated from approximately the Bronze Age to the Iron
Age), there is now widespread acceptance that the first
residents of the Tarim Basin came from the West. This

was followed, in stages, by the arrival of Eastern people
following the Han Dynasty [1,2]. However, the exact
time when the admixture of the East and the West
occurred in this area is still obscure [3]. In 2000, the
Xinjiang Archaeological Institute rediscovered a very
important Bronze Age site, the Xiaohe cemetery, by utilizing a device employing the global positioning system.
The rediscovery of this cemetery provided an invaluable
opportunity to further investigate the migrations of
ancient populations in the region.
The Xiaohe cemetery (40°20’11"N, 88°40’20.3"E) is
located in the Taklamakan Desert of northwest China,
about 60 km south of the Peacock River and 175 km
west of the ancient city of Kroraina (now Loulan;
Figure 1). It was first explored in 1934 by Folke Bergman, a Swedish archaeologist, but the cemetery was lost
sight of until the Xinjiang Archaeological Institute rediscovered it in 2000. The burial site comprises a total of
167 graves. Many enigmatic features of these graves,
such as the pervasive use of sexual symbolism

represented by tremendous numbers of huge phallusposts and vulvae-posts, exaggerated wooden sculptures
of human figures and masks, well-preserved boat coffins
and mummies, a large number of textiles, ornaments
and other artifacts, show that the civilization revealed at
Xiaohe is different from any other archaeological site of
the same period anywhere in the world [3].
The entire necropolis can be divided, based on the
archeological materials, into earlier and later layers.
Radiocarbon measurement (14C) dates the lowest layer of
occupation to around 3980 ± 40 BP (personal communications; calibrated and measured by Wu Xiaohong, Head of
the Laboratory of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Peking
University), which is older than that of the Gumugou cemetery (dated to 3800). To date, these are the oldest human
remains that have been excavated in the Tarim Basin [3].
A genetic study of these invaluable archeological materials
will undoubtedly provide significant insights into the
origins of the people of the Tarim Basin.
We examined the DNA profiles on both the maternal
and the paternal aspects for all the morphologically

well-preserved human remains from the lowest layer of
the Xiaohe cemetery. We used these data to determine
the population origins, to provide insights into the early
human migration events in the Tarim Basin and, finally,
to offer an expanded understanding of the human history of Eurasia.

Methods
Sampling

The excavation of the Xiaohe cemetery began in 2002.
The lowest layer of the cemetery, comprising a total of
41 graves of which 37 have human skeletal remains, was
excavated by the Xinjiang Archaeological Institute and
the Research Center for Chinese Frontier Archaeology
of Jilin University from 2004 to 2005. After the appropriate recording, the skeletal remains of 30 well-preserved individuals, together with sandy soil, were packed
in cardboard boxes and sent to the ancient DNA laboratory of Jilin University, where they were stored in a dry
and cool environment. All the samples were collected by
two highly skilled scientists in our group, equipped with

Li et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/15

gloves and facemasks. As a result of the saline and alkaline character of the sand, the dry air and good drainage, the human remains are in excellent conditions.
One intact femur and two tooth samples for each set of
human remains were selected for DNA analysis, except
for samples 84 and 121, which have only tooth samples.
The archaeological information regarding the samples
used in this study is summarized in Additional File 1.

that of the morphological examination in order to monitor any potential contamination in the extraction.
(9) DNA samples from all laboratory excavators and
staff members involved in the project were genetically
typed and recorded for comparison with the haplotypes
of all ancient samples. This is critical in order to ensure
the accuracy of the generated ancient DNA results [6-9].
The information for people involved in this project is
listed in Table 1.

Contamination precautions and decontamination

Previous studies have shown that the recovery of
authentic ancient human DNA is possible [4,5] when
strict precautions are taken to prevent contamination.
The following is a summary of the measures taken to
avoid contamination and to ensure authenticity in the
present study.
(1) Bone powdering, DNA extraction and amplification were carried out in three separate rooms in our
laboratory which is dedicated solely to ancient DNA studies; all staff wore laboratory coats, facemasks and
gloves and strict cleaning procedures [frequent treatment with bleach and ultraviolet (UV) light] were
applied.
(2) In order to prevent contamination, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) tubes, tips, microcentrifuge tubes
and drills were sterilized by autoclaving. Some of the
reagents were exposed to UV light at 254 nm for at
least 30 min. Tip boxes were soaked in 10% sodium
hypochlorite solution. Extraction and amplification
blanks were included in every PCR assay in order to
detect any potential contamination from sample processing or reagents even though they were guaranteed
DNA-free by the manufacturers.
(3) Multiple extractions and amplifications from the
same individual were undertaken at different times and
from two different parts of the skeleton by three different laboratory members.
(4) Three samples were sent to Fudan University in
Shanghai, China, for an independent repetition.
(5) Cloning analysis was performed with all the samples, in order to detect potential heterogeneity in the
amplification products due to contamination, DNA
damage or jumping PCR.
(6) Different length fragments were amplified. Since
there is an inverse correlation between fragment length
and amplification efficiency for ancient DNA, contamination from modern DNA could be identified by this assay.
(7) Ancient DNA from animal remains (goat or cattle)
found at the same site was isolated and amplified using
the same procedures as those used for the human ancient
DNA, again providing a negative control for our study.
(8) The sex of some of the morphologically intact
individuals was determined by amplifying the amelogenin (AMG) gene and the results were compared to

Sample preparation and DNA extraction

The bone and tooth samples were processed independently. A fragment of bone, about 3 cm long, was cut
from the intact femur or tibia by sawing. In order to
remove any possible surface contamination of the samples by external DNA, each bone was drilled three times
with three different drills to remove a layer about 1-3
mm from the top after removing the external soil using
brush, and then soaked in a 5% sodium hypochlorite
solution for 10 min, rinsed with distilled water and
absolute alcohol successively and UV-irradiated (254
nm) on all sides for at least 45 min in a clean room.
The samples were then pulverized by Freezer Mill 6850

after immersion in liquid nitrogen. Intact teeth were
handled differently: they were soaked in a 5% sodium
hypochlorite solution for 15 min after a preliminary
treatment in which they were wiped with 10% sodium
hypochlorite and then rinsed with absolute alcohol.
After that, all sides of the samples were exposed to UV
radiation (254 nm) for a minimum of 20 min before the
sample was ground to powder by Freezer Mill 6750.
DNA was extracted by means of a silica-based protocol
[10]. One extraction blank was included for every three
ancient samples. In brief, 0.5-2 g tooth/bone powder
was incubated about 20 h at 50°C in lysis solution (1
mL 10% SDS, 4 ml EDTA (pH 8; 0.5 M, Promega, WI,
USA), 100 uL of 10 mg/ml proteinase K (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). After centrifugation, the solution was
subsequently concentrated with centricons (Millipore,
MA, USA) up to about 100 μL volume, and then the
extraction proceeded according to the handbook of the
QIAquick DNA Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany).
DNA amplification, cloning, and sequencing

The nucleotide positions 16035-16409 of the mitochondrial genome was amplified by two overlapping primer
pairs. In addition, a number of coding-region mtDNA
polymorphisms were typed, which are diagnostic for
major branches in the mtDNA tree: Haplogroups R
(12705C), UK(12308G), HV(14766T), H(7028C), R1
(4917G), R11(10031C) and C4(11969A) were identified
by direct sequencing and haplogroups M(10400T), F
(3970T) and C(14318C) were examined by using amplified product-length polymorphisms method [11-13]. The
B haplogroup was identified based on 9-bp deletion in
np8280. Some Y-chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (Y-SNPs) were typed, which are diagnostic
for major branches in the Y chromosome haplogroup
tree [14,15]: Haplogroups F(M89T), K(M9G), P(M45A),
R1(M173A), and R1a1a(M198A) were identified by
direct sequencing. The primers used in HVRI and diagnostic SNP markers are shown in Table 2.
PCR amplifications were performed in 20 μL reactions
with 3 μl of extract, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada), and 1.5×buffer (Fermentas), 1.5
mg/ml BSA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP (Promega,
USA), and 400 pmol for each primer (Sangong, China).
The cycle conditions used a Mastercycler gradient
(Eppendorf, Germany) consisting of 40 cycles at 94°C
for 1 min, 59°C -52°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min,
with a first denatured step of 94°C for 5 min and a last
extended step of 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were
purified with QIAamp quick DNA Purification Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced with BigDye 3.1 in an ABI 310
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The
PCR products were cloned with pGEM-T (Promega),

following the supplier’s instructions. Extraction, amplification, cloning, and sequencing were undertaken
in slightly varying conditions for different samples
(Table 3).
Data analysis

Sequence alignments were performed using the Clustalx1.8 software. Comparison of DNA sequence homology was performed with Blast from the National Centre
for Biotechnology Information. Median networks were
constructed by Network 4.5 using a reduction threshold
and the different weights for SNPs loci but the same
weight for all HVSI polymorphism loci. No statistical
analysis was performed in this study due to the small
sample size.

Results
Authenticity of results

A total of 23 reproducible mtDNA fragments (360 bp)
were obtained from 30 individual sets of the Xiaohe
human remains, after discarding seven samples due to
failed amplification or irreproducible results. Three of
the 23 DNA fragments were similar to the DNA of two
people involved in the study and were also removed
from the study, even though they yielded consistent
results through three or more independent extractions.
The remains of 20 individuals were selected for cloning
analysis. Eight to twelve clones from two independent
amplifications of the 20 individuals were selected for automated DNA sequencing. Although a few positions were
different from direct sequencing of the PCR products,
which could be due to random Taq misincorporation or
DNA damage, the consensus sequence from cloning was
consistent (see Additional File 2). In order to validate the
results generated in our laboratory, human remains from
three Xiaohe individuals (100, 119, and 127) were sent to
the ancient DNA laboratory of Fudan University for
further analysis and identical results were obtained.
The following facts further confirm the authenticity of
our results: (1) an inverse correlation between the size
of the PCR amplicons and the amplification efficiency
for the Xiaohe samples (209 bp > 235 bp > 399 bp) was
found; (2) molecular sexual identification results were in
accordance with morphological sex assignments; (3)
HVR-I sequences match well with the key coding region
SNPs according to the well-defined mtDNA phylogenetic tree [16,17]; and (4) parallel studies were also performed on Xiaohe animal samples, and no human DNA
was detected. Collectively, 20 mtDNA fragments from
30 human remains were obtained that were inferred to
be authentic (Table 3). The sequences have been submitted to GenBank with accession numbers FJ719792FJ719811. This high success rate suggests that the DNA
from the Xiaohe human remains is well preserved, as

MtDNA haplogroup profile and distribution

The 20 mtDNA fragments containing eight different
haplotypes that can be further assigned to five haplogroups, which belong to subhaplogroups of macrohaplogroups M and N (Figure 2).
The dominant haplogroup in the Xiaohe people was
the East Eurasian lineage C, shared by 14 Xiaohe individuals who were associated with two different mtDNA
haplotypes (S1 and S2). According to the coding region
11969 G to A, all lineage C found in the Xiaohe people
was further changed to subhaplogroup C4, which had

D-loop group-specific polymorphisms at nucleotide
positions (np) 16298 (T to C) and 16327 (C to T) [18].
Interestingly, the haplotype S1 shared by these 10 of the
14 Xiaohe individuals did not have the 16223T, a mutation had been found in the majority of modern lineage
C populations. This haplotype was found merely in
modern Evenks and Udegeys of southeastern Siberia but
the frequency is low [18]. It is interesting to note that
our study found a mutation, unique to the Xiaohe people but rare among lineage C, 16309 G (see Additional
File 3). To the best of our knowledge, the lineage C
with 16309 G was observed only in three people from
modern central Asia to date, who also possess another
two mutations in HVRI region [19].

Note: √ means we performed this kind of strategy to the sample; - indicates that the targeted DNA fragment could not be amplified for a given sample.

Besides the East Eurasian lineage, two West Eurasian
mtDNA haplogroups H and K were found among the
Xiaohe people. H lineage is the most common mtDNA
haplogroup in West Eurasia [20], but haplogroup H
with a 16260T was shared by only nine modern people
in Genbank, including one Italian, one German, one
Hungarian, one Portuguese, one Icelander and four English people. Haplogroup K, a western Eurasian-specific
haplogroup, is mainly distributed in Europe, central
Asia, and Iran [20,21]. However, haplogroup K with
16134T, found in the Xiaohe people, has not been
found in modern people to our knowledge.
Among the Xiaohe people, three sequences with the
unique HVRI motif 16189-16192-16311 formed a subcluster (Figure 2) and were not shared by modern people. They are identified as macrohaplogroup R through
sequencing the PCR amplicons at np10400 and
np12705 in the coding region. The np12308, np14766,
np10031, np4917, np3970, and 9 bp deletion, which
are the diagnostic sites for the main subhaplogroups of
R, were further examined [15]. The results showed
that they are related neither to the West Eurasian
haplogroups UK, TJ, HV, R11 and R1, nor to the East
Eurasian haplogroups B and F. So we designated
them as haplogroup R* temporarily. Another sequence
with motif 16223-16304, shared by some people from
East Asia, India, and Europe, was assigned to
haplogroup M*.

Y chromosome haplogroup profiling and distribution

Fifteen individuals’ AMG amplicons were obtained from
the 20 Xiaohe individuals (whose mtDNA was successfully amplified), among which seven individuals were
identified as male and eight as female. The Y chromosome haplogroup of the seven males were all assigned
to haplogroup R1a1a through screening the Y-SNPs at
M89, M9, M45, M173 and M198 successively. Haplogroup R1a1a is widely distributed in Eurasia: it is
mainly found in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, South
Asia, Siberia, ancient Siberia, but rare in East Asia
[22-24].

Discussion
The Xiaohe cemetery is the oldest archeological site
with human remains discovered in the Tarim Basin to
date. Our genetic analyses revealed that the maternal
lineages of the Xiaohe people were originated from
both the East and the West, whereas paternal lineages
discovered in the Xiaohe people all originated from the
West.
The East Eurasian lineage C, which was widely distributed in modern Asian populations, was the dominant haplogroup in the remains recovered from the
lowest layer of the Xiaohe cemetery. This lineage is
most frequently found in modern Siberian populations

(Mongolian, Daur and Korean) and Central Asian
populations [25-29] (Figure 3). It was also found in the
ancient Qinghai (4000BP) of China [30] and ancient
South Siberian populations [31,32]. In order to trace
the original wellspring of lineage C in the Xiaohe
population, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using
14 ancient Xiaohe samples and 522 modern haplogroup C samples from surrounding areas of the
Xiaohe cemetery, including Siberian, Mongolian, Central Asian, northern Chinese and northern minorities
of East Asia (see Additional File 3). The phylogenetic
network displays a star-like distribution within the
South Siberian population, which has an ancestral haplotype motif 16223-16298-16327. The ancestral haplotype was found mainly in South Siberian whose
diversity of haplotypes C is very high (Figure 4).
Therefore, the original source of haplogroup C was
inferred to South Siberian. It is important to note that
the C haplotypes of the Xiaohe people had only a single mutation compared with the ancestral haplotype.
The shared sequences of the Xiaohe C haplotype (S1)

were distributed in southeastern Siberia. It implies that
the east Eurasian component in the Xiaohe people originated from the Siberian populations, especially the
southern or eastern Siberian populations.
The mtDNA haplogroup H is the most common
mtDNA haplogroup in Europe, especially in northwestern Europe, and its frequency can be as high as 65% in
Iberia. Frequencies gradually decrease from the northwest to the southeast of Europe. By contrast, the frequency of haplogroup H rises to only 20% in the Near
East, and to less than10% in Central Asia, and is very
low in East Asia [33,34]. All of the shared sequences of
the Xiaohe H haplotype, however, were distributed in
Western Europe. Haplogroup K is also common in Europe, particularly around the Alps and the British Isles. It
is found with less frequency in North Africa, the Middle
East, and South Asia [21,35-37]. Considering the presence of haplogroups H and K in the Xiaohe people and
the geographical distribution of shared sequences, we
conclude that the west Eurasian component observed in
the Xiaohe people originated from western European,

and maternal ancestry of the Xiaohe people might have
close relationship with western European.
Regarding the Y chromosomal DNA analyses, the
seven males identified all belonged to haplogroup
R1a1a. It is most frequently found in Eastern Europe,
South Asia and Siberia. In contrast, it is relatively
uncommon in Middle Easterners and rare in East Asian
[22-24]. It is thought to be a trace of the migration
events of early Indo-European [38,39]. The presence of
haplogroup R1a1a in the ancient Xiaohe people implies
that the parental ancestry of the Xiaohe people originated from somewhere in Siberia or Europe, which is
consistent with the origin of maternal ancestry.
It is generally agreed that the origin of modern
populations in Xinjiang and Central Asia is the result
of the admixture of people from the West and the East
[19,25,40]. When and where this admixture first
occurred has long been of interest to geneticists and
archaeologists [41-44]. The year 132 BC is often considered to be the beginning of contact between the

Page 9 of 12

East and the West along the Great Silk Road, since the
Chinese explorer Zhang Qian went westward into Central Asia at that time. However, Mair has suggested
that the date should be even earlier, based on the fact
that silk appeared in Europe at 1000 BC [1]. In this
study, the East and West Eurasian lineages are seen to
coexist in the Xiaohe people, implying that the East
had contacted the West during the early Bronze Age.
It is noteworthy that the maternal lineage of five male
individuals (106, 111, 115, 136 and 139) originated
from East Eurasian, whereas their paternal lineage originated from the West Eurasian, implying that the
Xiaohe population had been an admixture of people
from both the West and the East. Given the unique
genetic haplotypes and the particular archaeological
culture, the time of this admixture could be much earlier than the time at which the Xiaohe people were living at the site. This means that the time of their
mingling was at least a 1000 years earlier than previously proposed.

Li et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:15

However, the mtDNA haplogroups H, K and C all are
very ancient lineages, over 10,000 years old in vast north
Eurasia, whereas the civilization of the Tarim Basin,
according to the archaeological materials, arose very
late. The admixture therefore probably occurred elsewhere, before immigration into the Tarim Basin. The
Xiaohe people might well have been an admixture at the
time of their arrival. Where did the initial admixture
occur?
The admixture from people of the West and the East
was also found in ancient Central Asia, Siberia, and
Mongolia [16,38,45,46]. The extent of the admixture
varied in different regions and at different periods (Figure 5). Central Asia has always been the crossroads of
contact between the West and the East. Lalueza-Fox et
al. proved that Eastern lineages coexisted with Western
lineages in Central Asia after 700 BC [41], whereas the
West had met the East in south Siberia in the Bronze
Age [38], and even earlier at Lake Baikal [45]. Xinjiang
and the surrounding areas, especially south Siberia,
were places at which the contact between western and
eastern populations occurred earlier than in Central
Asia. Given the fact that the mtDNA haplogroup C was
distributed mainly in south Siberia, and that haplogroups H, K and R1a1a already had spread eastward
into south Siberia during the Bronze Age, it is possible
that the initial admixture occurred somewhere in southern Siberia. Considering that the cultural characteristics
of the Xiaohe cemetery are similar to those of the
Andronovo or Afanasevo culture that appeared
throughout the southern Russian steppe, Kazakhstan,
and western Central Asia during the second millennium
BC [1,46], the admixed population might have had relationship with populations settled South Siberia during
the Bronze Age.

Conclusions
Our results demonstrated that the Xiaohe people was
an admixture from populations originating from both
the West and the East, implying that the Tarim Basin
had been occupied by an admixed population since the
early Bronze Age. Considering the unique genetic haplotypes and particular archaeological culture, the
admixed population might have had relationship with
populations settled South Siberia during the Bronze
Age. To our knowledge, this is the earliest genetic evidence of an admixed population settled in the Tarim
Basin.
