Abstract
Background: Adult cartilaginous fish express three immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes, IgM, IgNAR and
IgW. Newborn nurse sharks, Ginglymostoma cirratum, produce 19S (multimeric) IgM and
monomeric/dimeric IgM1gj, a germline-joined, IgM-related VH, and very low amounts of 7S
(monomeric) IgM and IgNAR proteins. Newborn IgNAR VH mRNAs are diverse in the
complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) with non-templated nucleotide (N-region)
addition, which suggests that, unlike in many other vertebrates, terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase (TdT) expressed at birth is functional. IgW is present in the lungfish, a bony fish sharing
a common ancestor with sharks 460 million years ago, implying that the IgW VH family is as old as
the IgM VH family. This nurse shark study examined the IgM and IgW VH repertoire from birth
through adult life, and analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of these gene families.
Results: IgM and IgW VH cDNA clones isolated from newborn nurse shark primary and secondary
lymphoid tissues had highly diverse and unique CDR3 with N-region addition and VDJ gene
rearrangement, implicating functional TdT and RAG gene activity. Despite the clear presence of Nregion additions, newborn CDR3 were significantly shorter than those of adults. The IgM clones
are all included in a conventional VH family that can be classified into five discrete groups, none of
which is orthologous to IgM VH genes in other elasmobranchs. In addition, a novel divergent VH
family was orthologous to a published monotypic VH horn shark family. IgW VH genes have
diverged sufficiently to form three families. IgM and IgW VH serine codons using the potential
somatic hypermutation hotspot sequence occur mainly in VH framework 1 (FR1) and CDR1.
Phylogenetic analysis of cartilaginous fish and lungfish IgM and IgW demonstrated they form two
major ancient gene groups; furthermore, these VH genes generally diversify (duplicate and diverge)
within a species.
Conclusion: As in ratfish, sandbar and horn sharks, most nurse shark IgM VH genes are from one
family with multiple, heterogeneous loci. Their IgW VH genes have diversified, forming at least
three families. The neonatal shark Ig VH CDR3 repertoire, diversified via N-region addition, is
shorter than the adult VDJ junction, suggesting one means of postnatal repertoire diversification is
expression of longer CDR3 junctions.

Background
The major components of adaptive immunity, including
Ig, T cell receptors, and MHC class I and class II, have been
identified in the ancient jawed vertebrate taxon cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes), which includes sharks,
skates, rays (elasmobranchs), and ratfish (holocephali)
(Figure 1) [1,2]. Additionally, genes required for lymphopoiesis and Ig gene rearrangement/diversification,
such as PU.1, Ikaros, RAG1, RAG2 and TdT, as well as primary and secondary lymphoid tissues, are also present
within this vertebrate class [3-8]. Cartilaginous fish
genomic Ig gene segments are organized in ~10 kb clusters, each containing one variable segment (V), two to
three diversity segments (D) depending on the VH class, a
joining segment (J), and constant gene exons (C); in all
expression studies to date these gene segments undergo
rearrangement only within a cluster [1,9,10]. Thus far
three major Ig classes, IgM, IgNAR, and IgW, have been
identified in adult elasmobranchs [1,2]. However, newborn shark pups require postnatal development to express
adult levels of 7S IgM and IgNAR [11-13]. In lieu of 7S
IgM and IgNAR, neonates preferentially secrete 19S IgM
and IgM1gj (so-named because it is related to conventional
IgM; 1 refers to the 1st IgM gene expressed during ontogeny and expressed in primary lymphoid tissue; and gj
refers to the germline-join of this VH gene [5]), a monotypic VH expressed from a non-somatically rearranged
(germline-joined) VDJ locus [5,11,12]. Whereas IgNAR
protein is present in low amounts in the sera of newborn
sharks, study of IgNAR mRNA at birth revealed a novel
isotype (type 3) of reduced diversity, in part due to germline-joining of two of the three DH genes in the specific
cluster [5,14]. Interestingly, this IgNAR type 3 is most
highly expressed at birth and may undergo positive selection since its CDR3 length is highly constrained [14]. As
with IgM1gj expression, when shark pups mature IgNAR
type 3 gene transcription declines and expression of conventional IgNAR types 1 and 2 comes to predominate.
This switch in expression correlates with increased diversity in CDR3 due to rearrangement of the three DH genes
and N-region additions [5,14]. A molecular study in the
embryonic and newborn clearnose skate, Raja eglanteria,
demonstrated that IgM and IgW VH CDR3 increase in
diversity by 2–3 fold as they mature to adulthood [15].
Together these results suggest cartilaginous fish may have
a developmental program for expression of their Ig genes,
progressing from an innate-like, restricted repertoire to a
complex, diverse repertoire. These findings are similar to
previous analyses of the ontogeny of mouse, human, and
frog Ig gene expression [16-18]. However, unlike those
other species, there is clear evidence for N-region additions in CDR3 during embryonic and neonatal life at
every rearranging H chain locus so far analyzed.

In all elasmobranchs examined, secretory IgW transcripts
are expressed in two forms, a full-length, long form and a
truncated, short form that is probably derived by alternative splicing [19,20]. Recent molecular characterization of
Ig H chains also identified both IgW forms in the African
lungfish, Protopterus aethiopicus, a lobe-finned bony fish,
which phylogenetic studies suggest are closely related to
land vertebrates (tetrapods) (refer to Figure 1) [1,21,22].
Since molecular phylogenetic analyses determined that
the cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes) separated prior to
the divergence of bony fishes (Osteichthyes – lobe-finned
and ray-finned) from the other jawed vertebrates [23] the
discovery of IgW in the lungfish suggests that it was
present in the common ancestor of bony and cartilaginous fishes 460 million years ago (MYA). As well this discovery provides an impetus for further work to determine
if this Ig class is present in one or more groups of the rayfinned bony fish, i.e. chondrostean, and holostean, and
teleost, and the cartilaginous fish group of holocephali
[21,24] since to date only IgM and IgD have been identified in the ray-finned bony fishes and only IgM in the
holocephali [25].
To further our understanding of Ig class expression and
regulation during ontogeny, we herein describe IgM and
IgW VH family expression in the newborn nurse shark,
Ginglymostoma cirratum.

Results
Newborn IgM is expressed from multiple loci of one VH
family
Developmental regulation of IgM expression was examined by screening two cDNA libraries constructed from
newborn nurse shark epigonal organ (primary lymphoid
tissue) and spleen (secondary lymphoid tissue). Libraries
were probed with a canonical IgM VH and partial CH1
probe under high and low stringency hybridization conditions [5]. Deduced amino acid (AA) sequences of the
leader, VH, and partial CH1 for 25 positive clones were
compared to the predicted AA sequence of the single previously published adult nurse shark IgM (Genbank accession #M92851 [26]) and aligned in Clustal W (Figure 2)
[27]. These clones formed six groups (I-VI) that differ in
VH leader, FR and CDR. Clones in Groups I-V are all clustered within one VH family, and as has been reported for
other elasmobranchs; nevertheless CDR1 and CDR2 are
diverse among the different groups. Group VI, which consists only of clone 36E, is distinct from the other groups
and is discussed separately below.

Excluding the positions of VDJ rearrangement (CDR3),
VH members within a group are quite similar in FR and
CDR1-2, suggesting that they are expressed from one
locus or several highly related loci. Indeed, microheterogeneity of 5'UT sequences of the 24 clones identified

expression of 15 highly related loci from the five groups
(data not shown). We estimated from previous Southern
blotting analysis that there were ~15–25 IgM loci in the
nurse shark [5]. Thus, our library screening results would
suggest that most IgM loci are expressed at birth, which is
consistent with our previous immunohistochemistry

study demonstrating that the great majority of splenic B
cells in newborn nurse sharks are IgM+ [12]. If this estimate of gene number is confirmed in future studies of
nurse shark VH genes, then this elasmobranch species has
far fewer IgM genes as compared to the published esti-

Alignment of VH and partial CH1 of IgM cDNA clones

Alignment of VH and partial CH1 of IgM cDNA clones. The deduced amino acid sequences of 25 IgM cDNA clones
(Genbank accession # AY609247-AY609274) were aligned with the conventional adult nurse shark IgM (Genbank accession
#M92851 [32]) in ClustalW. Dashes (-) indicate identity with the first sequence and gaps introduced to correct alignment are
indicated by slashes (/). Identification of framework and CDR are based on previous work [26]. Differences in the framework
and CDR separated the clones into six groups (I-VI). The CDR3 varies in length and sequence thus most clones are unique,

mates of 100 IgM loci for the horn shark and 50 loci for
the skate [1,28].
The IgM clones were analyzed for the conserved residues
necessary to maintain the Ig structural fold using the
ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) system [29-31]. Representa-

tives of the most divergent groups I and VI were compared
to the originally isolated nurse shark IgM M92851 VH
(Figure 3) [32]. Residues essential for the Ig fold are the
hydrophobic GlyLeuGluTrp in FR2 positions 49–52,
Trp41, and Cys in strands B and F at positions 23 and 104
required for the canonical disulfide bridge [31]. These

Newborn IgM and IgW VH families conserve residues important for the Ig fold motif
Figure 3
Newborn IgM and IgW VH families conserve residues important for the Ig fold motif. The VH structures are formatted per the IMGT numbering system [29]. (A) IgM Ig fold is maintained in IgM VH family members. The nurse shark canonical IgM Genbank accession # M92851 [32] was compared to the more divergent members from group I clone 30E and group
VI clone 36E. Hydrophobic amino acids (hydropathy index with positive value: I, V, L, F, C, M, A) and tryptophan (W) at positions at which more than 50 % of analysed IG and TR sequences were positive are highlighted in blue [32]. Prolines (P) are
marked in yellow and conserved Ig fold residues Cys at positions 23 and 104, and Tryp (W) at position 41 are highlighted in
yellow lettering. This modeling demonstrates that Ig fold motifs strand B and F Cys and hydrophobic core residues are conserved in these VH domains. Hatched circles represent residues of the canonical VH IMGT structure that are not utilized in the
shark VH. (B) The IMGT numbering system was used to compare the VH domains of the conventional IgW U51450 [46] to
representatives of the IgW VH divergent groups III and V. These divergent VH families maintain the Ig fold motif and utilize Pro
in the FR similar to IgM (refer to part A).

residues and their positions are conserved in members of
the five IgM groups, indicating preservation of the Ig fold
structure. The FR and CDR for the clones were analyzed
for their similarity to the original VH (Table 1). All groups

were least similar to the original VH in the FR1 (69–83%
identity) and CDR1 (33%), and most similar in FR2 and
FR3 (78–93%). CDR2 was more conserved than CDR1,
with groups II-IV most similar to the original sequence. FR

conservation and variation in the CDR are consistent with
findings in the horn shark, sandbar shark, and higher vertebrates [33]. Membership within a specific VH family has
been defined as greater than or equal to 75% identical AA
(greater than or equal to 70% identical nucleotides); thus
VH in nurse shark groups I-V are within a single family
(refer to Table 1) [31,35]. Additionally an ATG codon
(Methionine) in CDR1 is present in all IgM clones, consistent with a previous study showing this codon at this
position is preserved throughout vertebrate phylogeny
(refer to Fig 2) [35]. Any nucleotide substitution in this
codon leads to an AA replacement, suggesting a role for its
evolutionary conservation. Generally, CDR1 and CDR2
contain codons that either target the hypermutation
machinery (see below) or are minimally degenerate (e.g.
ATG) to maximize the potential for AA modifications in
these regions of the V domain [36].
The CDR3 sequences of each clone were unique in length
and sequence, suggesting gene rearrangement and Nregion addition via RAG1/2 and TdT action, respectively.
This was further investigated by comparison of CDR3
nucleotide sequences to a representative genomic horn
shark IgM locus (X13447, [33]) in Table 2. The DH gene
sequence that exactly matched the horn shark sequence
(and thus could be encoded by a DH segment) is underlined (at least 4 bases corresponding to the D segment),
and putative N-region additions are indicated by italicized
G and C nucleotides [37]. At least four of 22 newborn
clones (18%) putatively utilize both DH1 and DH2 genes,
as do most adult VH clones. The majority of newborn VH
may rearrange only the DH1 gene, or more likely, based
upon the RSS sequences of the rearranging segments in
most shark clusters (V-23, 12-D1-22, 12-D2-12, 23-J)
there may instead be extensive trimming of the DH2 segment during rearrangement so that it cannot be recognized in the cDNA clones. There is a GC bias in the nonD-encoding CDR3 sequences for ~75% of the clones
implicating TdT activity, similar to previous findings for
neonatal IgNAR VH [14]. In summary, newborn IgM is
expressed from multiple heterogeneous loci of one VH
family that have conserved the Ig fold structure, and these

expressed VH genes are diverse in CDR3, indicative of TdT
and RAG activity at birth.
cDNA clone 36E in group VI is an unrearranged VH containing intronic sequence. The deduced sequence of 36E
has only 38–50% AA identity with the conventional VH,
and thus forms a separate VH family (Table 1) [31]. This
VH family contains the residues important for the Ig fold,
with the exception of an Arg replacing the typical Gly at
position 49 (Figure 3). Clone 36E VH has more charged
residues, especially in CDR1 and FR2, than the canonical
VH, and the CDR are not enriched in Ser, unlike the other
IgM VH. National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [3840] identified this VH family is most similar to a monotypic horn shark IgM VH (79%) (accession #Z11776
[41]). Clone 36E VH has 56% and 48% identical AA residues, respectively, to the sandbar shark IgW (accession
#U50606 [42]) and nurse shark IgW (accession #U51450
[43]), and only 36% identical AA to a representative sandbar shark IgM VH [44] (data not shown). This novel VH
family, therefore, is most related to the unusual horn
shark VH and it was present in their common ancestral
gene pool ~120 MYA [24]. In addition, this VH has similarity to both IgM and IgW VH genes, suggesting a more
ancient origin (see below). Identification of a productively rearranged transcript containing the constant gene
exons for this novel IgM VH locus is needed to permit its
placement in the appropriate Ig class and enable further
study.
IgW VHs are diverse and consist of multiple families
expressed at birth
The ontogeny of IgW expression in neonate sharks was
investigated by screening nurse shark pup spleen and
epigonal organ cDNA libraries with an IgW VH and partial
CH1 probe [5]. Clones were negatively selected for IgM
VH+ cross-hybridizing clones and positively selected for
strong, intermediate, and weak hybridization intensity
signals. Their deduced AA sequences were aligned to the
published nurse shark IgW VH (accession #U51450 [43])
in Clustal W and shown to form six groups (Figure 4). The

percent similarity of the FR and CDR AA sequences to the
original VH region is summarized in Table 3. Groups I
and II are members of the original VH family, with 73–
78% identity. Groups III-V form three new IgW VH families, with 46–56% AA identity to the original VH [31].
Interestingly, similar to our observations for the novel
IgM VH family clone 36E, CDR1 in groups II and V contain more charged residues than are found in the other
groups. CDR3s of each IgW clone in groups I and V are
diverse and contain unique AA residues, again suggesting
that TdT is active on rearranging IgW loci in neonates. A
genomic clone for nurse shark IgW has not been isolated
and therefore identification of DH gene usage in the junctions is not possible. 5'UT microheterogeneity shows that
IgW VH groups are expressed from 11 loci, suggesting that
several highly related loci are represented by each group
(data not shown). High stringency Southern blotting
analysis of the conventional IgW VH family indicated that
4–6 loci exist in the nurse shark, and low stringency
conditions revealed more VH+ bands, which may have
been divergent IgW (or IgM) VH families [43]. Multiple
IgW VH families were previously indicated by in situ
hybridization results in the skate, Raja eglanteria [45].
Thus these data together suggest that the nurse shark and
skate have an equivalent number of IgW VH loci.

In the first constant domain (CH1) of conventional Ig H
chains a Cys in the A strand is typically present that forms
a disulfide bond with light (L) chains; this position is Gly
in group II clones and Arg in group I clone 8S (Figure 4)
[31]. A Cys located in a more C-terminal position may be
available for L chain association (data not shown). Mutation of the canonical Cys used for L chain association also
is seen in IgM1gj where the Ig heavy chain protein does
associate with Ig light chain protein [5], and modeling of
other Cys more C-terminal in the CH1 domain has shown
they likely are available for disulfide bonding to L chains
[5].
IgW VH (#U51450 [43]) structure from IMGT [46] was
compared to representative members of the divergent
groups III and V (refer to Figure 3). Both of these VH families maintain the conserved residues and positions
required for the Ig fold. In addition, they contain more
Pro residues in strands A and C than conventional IgW
VH, which are also present in these same strands in cartilaginous fish IgM VH (ratfish, nurse and horn sharks, Figure 3) [26,33,47]. In summary, our results, along with
previous data, demonstrate the existence and expression
of several IgW VH families in newborns. These VH gene
families conserve residues necessary for maintenance of

#AY609225-AY609246, AY531553-AY531554, AY524297) were compared to the predicted amino acid sequence of conventional IgW U51450 [43] and aligned in ClustalW with differences in FR and CDR separating the clones into six groups. Dashes

the Ig fold, and they undergo rearrangements containing
N-region additions in neonates.
The potential somatic hypermutation motif AGY is biased
to FR1 and CDR1
The V region of secretory IgNAR in the adult nurse shark
has a high frequency of mutation in adult sharks, yet this
region is seldom mutated in young pups suggesting that
the newborn immune system requires further maturation
to enable an effective immune responsive environment

[14,48]. Previously the Ser codon motif AGY (Y=C/T) had
been identified as a heavily targeted site of IgNAR somatic
hypermutation [48]. Therefore, we analyzed the newborn
IgM and IgW VH FR and CDR for the AGY potential hypermutation motif and Ser codon TCN (N=C/G/T/A), which
tends not to be somatically mutated (Figure 5). The AGY
motif was utilized significantly more frequently in IgM
VH FR1 (p < 0.01) and CDR1 (p < 0.01) than the TCN
codons and IgW also preferred the AGY codon motif for
CDR1 (p < 0.01). Both IgM and IgW VH genes encode the

Potential somatic hypermutation motifs are restricted to the FR1 and CDR1 for IgM and IgW VH genes. The FR
and CDR nucleotide sequences for all IgM and IgW cDNA clones were analyzed for the Ser codon potential somatic hypermutation motif AGC/T (AGY red square) and the non-hypermutated Ser codon nucleotide sequence TCC/T/A/G (TCN yellow
square). IgM significantly uses the AGY sequence in the FR1 and CDR1 (p < 0.01, one-way factorial analysis of variance
(ANOVA), n = 23) while IgW uses this motif in the CDR1 (p < 0.01, ANOVA, n = 16). The non-hypermutated motif was significantly enriched in the FR3 region for both Ig VH families (p < 0.01, ANOVA) and neither motif was present in all FR2
analyzed.

TCN sequence more frequently than AGY in FR3 (p <
0.01), but encode neither AGY nor TCN in FR2 implying
a resistance to hypermutation in these regions, as seen in
previous studies of tetrapod Ig genes [34]. Thus, the nurse
shark VH genes have potential hypermutation sites

focused in FR1 and CDR1, while FR2 and FR3 lack motifs
conducive to targeting somatic hypermutation.

Newborn IgW and IgM CDR3 are significantly shorter than the adult correlate. A). Newborn and adult nurse
sharks (Gc) frequency of specific CDR3 region lengths for IgM, IgW and IgNAR were compared. Newborn VH CDR3 is
shorter in length more frequently than the adult for each Ig isotype except IgNAR type 3 (which is not expressed in detectable
amounts in the adult). Sample size for each Ig isotype in newborns and adults are listed in part B. B). The mean CDR3 lengths
for Xenopus laevis (Xl) [49,51] and human (Hs) [64] newborn and adult IgM VH sequences were compared to the newborn and

the same pattern of preference for shorter CDR3 lengths as seen in the newborn frog (larvae) and human. Significance determined by ANOVA test with ** = p value <0.01 and * = p value <0.05.

Newborn IgW and IgM CDR3 are shorter than in adults
Newborn mouse, human, and frog VH CDR3s are less
diverse and shorter in length due to non-random VH gene
usage and lack of TdT activity [16,17,49-51]. In newborn
elasmobranchs TdT is expressed and functional early in
shark ontogeny, as shown in previous studies of TdT
expression and implied by the diversity of the newborn
CDR3 repertoire in the IgM and IgW classes (Figures 2, 4,
Table 2) and IgNAR types 1 and 2 [5,14,48]. The frequency of IgW and IgM VH CDR3 lengths in newborn
nurse sharks were compared to adult nurse, horn, and
sandbar sharks (Figure 6A). Newborn IgM VH utilize significantly shorter CDR3 than the adult with the newborn
mean length 7.8 AA (p < 0.01, range 3–17 AA, n = 23) and
the adult mean length 11.6 AA (p < 0.01, range 4–18 AA,
n = 64). This is consistent with our findings that expressed
newborn IgM VH tend to have only one recognizable DH
gene in CDR3 (Table 2). As well, newborn IgW VH CDR3s
are significantly shorter than adult CDR3s with the newborn mean 7.6 AA (p < 0.05, range 2–13, n = 16) and the
adult mean 10.6 AA (p < 0.05, range 7–15, n = 12). Previously published newborn and adult IgNAR were also
included in the VH CDR3 length analysis, although
IgNAR CDR3s are longer because this VH gene undergoes
four rearrangement events (V-D1-D2-D3-JH). Neonatal
IgNAR VH Type 1 CDR3 mean length 14.1 AA (p < 0.01,
range 8–20 AA, n = 18, [14]) was also significantly shorter
than those of the adult CDR3 mean 20 AA (p < 0.01, range
15–26, n = 20, [14]). As stated previously, the IgNAR Type
3 VH locus has two germline-joined DH genes and its
length is always 16 AA (n = 32) for all clones analyzed,
suggesting that this VH is positively selected during ontogeny on a self-ligand [14]. As Type 3 VH expression wanes
during postnatal maturation it was not possible to compare this gene's expression in adult life [14]. Together
these results show that newborn IgW, IgM, and IgNAR VH
CDR3 are significantly shorter than those of adults, indicating that the postnatal Ig VH repertoire is not entirely
mature. In addition, the results suggest that the rearrangement of Ig genes and the development of B cells from
immature precursors persist in primary lymphoid tissues
after birth in cartilaginous fish. To confirm these findings
the shark Ig VH CDR3 lengths were compared to
previously published newborn and adult frog and human
IgM VH CDR3s (Figure 6B). Despite the fact that all newborn sharks VH CDR3 contain N-region additions, indicative of functional TdT gene activity not apparent in frog
and human newborn sequences, the contrast of CDR3
sizes in young and old sharks is similar to that of tetrapod
CDR3 during ontogeny. Thus, a developmental program
of postnatal maturation, defined by longer CDR3, is demonstrated in sharks, frogs, and humans, which spans 460
million years of evolution.

IgM and IgW classes were present in the ancestors of all
jawed vertebrates
1The identification of IgW in the lungfish, close relatives
of land vertebrates, substantially changed the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of this Ig class, since these
lobe-finned bony fish shared a common ancestor with
cartilaginous fish more than 460 MYA (refer to Figure 1)
[21]. 2Accordingly, IgW VH family is more ancient than
previously believed and may be the primordial Ig rather
than IgM, as initially hypothesized [43]. 3The lungfish discovery allowed a more thorough phylogenetic analysis of
the IgM and IgW VH families (Figure 7). 4The neighborjoining phylogram was constructed using VH FR1-3,
excluding the CDR to reduce effects caused by positive
selection, and was rooted using the outgroup mouse (M.
musculus) L chain V kappa (accession #29725591) [5255]. 5Representative members from each newborn IgM
and IgW VH group were included in the tree, in addition
to representative IgM and IgW VH sequences from the
lungfish (P. aethiopicus), ratfish (H. colliei-holocephali),
skate (R. erinacea-elasmobranch), guitarfish (R. productusray, elasmobranch), sandbar shark (C. plumbeus-elasmobranch), horn shark (H. francisci-elasmobranch), and
nurse shark (G. cirratum) (refer to Figures 1,2 and 4).
Notably this analysis reveals that IgM and IgW cluster as
separate VH families among the cartilaginous and bony
fish lineages, demonstrating that the IgW VH family is
ancient. The monotypic horn shark IgM (accession
#Z11776) and its ortholog, the nurse shark divergent IgM
group VI clone 36E, segregate with the IgW VH group indicating that they have features of both the IgM and IgW VH
families. This phylogenetic analysis confirms the findings
of the lungfish IgW discovery, namely that IgM and IgW
VH are ancient gene families that were present in the common ancestor of cartilaginous and bony fish, which most
likely was a placoderm, an extinct heavily-armored fish
group considered to be the earliest vertebrates with jaws
[24]. Finally, most of the shark and skate IgM sequences,
excluding clone 36E, cluster within a species, which suggests that the various VH groups emerged after the divergence of each species.

Discussion
We show that the newborn nurse shark expresses five IgM
VH genes from one conventional VH family, as shown
previously for the adult horn shark, sandbar shark, and
ratfish [33]. Additionally, newborn nurse sharks express at
least two other VH families (36E and IgM1gj [5]). Newborn IgM VH CDR3 are diverse with N-nucleotide additions, which shows that TdT is active in embryonic life, as
previously documented for newborn IgNAR CDR3 [5,14].
The majority of IgM loci are expressed at birth. Among the
five VH groups these loci differ mainly in the CDR1 and
CDR2, implying that diversity-enhancing selection pressures are active in germline CDR as previously reported for

IgW and7IgM VH are ancient gene families
Figure
IgW and IgM VH are ancient gene families. A neighbor-joining tree was drawn in PHYLIP using cartilaginous fish and
lobe-finned bony fish IgM and IgW VH sequences FR1-FR3 omitting the CDR1-2 from published sources (accession numbers
noted next to sample) and this report (identified by clone numbers from Figures 2 and 4). The tree shows the various fish species cluster together by VH family rather than by their evolutionary relatedness indicating the IgW VH gene family is as ancient
as the IgM VH gene family.

other vertebrates [53]. The IgM VH CDR3 length is significantly shorter in neonates, showing that a developmental
program may control the CDR3 length. One explanation
for this finding may be that there is expression of different
VH clusters in adults that have longer DH and JH gene segments, as is seen in the mouse [56]; this possibility seems
unlikely as germline diversity seems similar in neonates
and adults (although the adult nurse shark repertoire
must be studied in more detail to prove this point). Secondly, TdT expression in pro/pre B cells in adults may be
higher than in young animals [57]. Finally, TdT activity
may be modified (e.g. decreased N-region addition or
increased exonuclease activity – our data suggest that DH2
segments may be extensively trimmed in neonatal junctions) by expression of splice variants or developmental
regulation of DNA-dependent protein kinase, a known
modulator of TdT activity [58,59].
Newborn IgW VH expression is from at least three rather
divergent VH families [43]. CDR3 lengths of IgW are also
significantly shorter than that of adults, as seen for IgM,
implying that a developmental program selects for
increased CDR3 length as the animals mature.
Potential somatic hypermutation Ser AGY motifs are preferentially encoded in the FR1 and CDR1, whilst the untargeted TCN motif is present in FR3. No Ser residues at all
are encoded in FR2. This tendency to target mutations
predominantly in the CDR is expected, but is paradoxical
in FR1 of IgM VH. There are generally fewer mutations in
FR1 in Ig from all vertebrates so far examined. This suggests that despite the presence of hypermutation targeting
motifs in this region, there is a higher order of control over
the mutational mechanism that inhibits the targeting to
FR1 AGY hotspots.
The IgM and IgW VH phylogenetic analysis suggest that
both VH families were present in the cartilaginous and
bony fish ancestral pool. A more thorough understanding
of the evolution of these VH families will require identification of IgW in the cartilaginous fish class holocephali
and in bony fish groups such as the chondrostean, holosteans and teleosts. Furthermore, isolation of all of the
germline genes is required to examine relative expression
levels of the various genes, and the level of diversity
gained by somatic hypermutation after antigenic stimulation of B cells.

Conclusion
Most IgM loci expressed at birth in nurse shark are from
one heterogeneous highly-related VH family which differs
in the CDR1-2. This repertoire is increased in its diversity
via N-region addition in CDR3. In spite of the N-region
addition the newborn VDJ junction is significantly shorter
than the adult, most likely due to extensive trimming of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/5/8

the DH2 segment during rearrangement. In contrast,
nurse shark IgW VH genes have diverged to form at least
three VH families expressed at birth.

Methods
Animals
Nurse shark pups were delivered by Caesarian section
from a gestating female shark near term as described [60].
cDNA library construction and screening
Tissues were dissected from nurse shark pups and total
RNA was isolated as described [5]. The newborn pup
spleen and epigonal cDNA libraries were constructed as
described previously [5]. Libraries were plated and
screened with canonical nurse shark IgM VH probe under
both high and low stringency conditions as described
[5,61]. Canonical nurse shark IgW VH and partial CH1
probe was amplified by PCR from plasmid DNA containing cloned cDNA insert using specific primers and labeled
as described [5,43]. Clones were selected and isolated
based on hybridization signal intensity of strong, intermediate and weak with more than 60 clones analyzed for
each Ig class.
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
IgW and IgM cDNA clones were translated into amino
acid sequences using the EXPASY translate tool [62] and
aligned in ClustalW v1.8 [63] for alignment analysis or
ClustalX v 1.8 for phylogenetic tree analysis [27,55]. Phylogenetic tree analysis was performed using the VH
regions from FR1-FR3 excluding CDR1-2. Amino acid
sequences were aligned in ClustalX v1.8 using the multiple alignment parameter which does pairwise alignments
in the Gonnet series protein weight matrix under default
conditions of 10.00 gap opening, 0.20 gap extension, and
30% delay divergent sequences. A neighbor-joining (NJ)
tree in PHYLIP output was drawn using a dendrogram as
the guide and the reliability of branching order was determined by 1000 replications (bootstrap analysis) [52,55].
The NJ phylogram tree was drawn in Treeview v1.6.6 and
rooted using mouse VL kappa as outgroup [54]. The NJ
tree was labeled in Canvas v9.0 (ACD Deneba Software,
Miami, FL, USA). Genbank and Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL
