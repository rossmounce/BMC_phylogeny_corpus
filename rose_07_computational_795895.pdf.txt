Abstract
Background: Recent experimental and computational studies have provided overwhelming
evidence for a plethora of diverse transcripts that are unrelated to protein-coding genes. One
subclass consists of those RNAs that require distinctive secondary structure motifs to exert their
biological function and hence exhibit distinctive patterns of sequence conservation characteristic
for positive selection on RNA secondary structure.
The deep-sequencing of 12 drosophilid species coordinated by the NHGRI provides an ideal data
set of comparative computational approaches to determine those genomic loci that code for
evolutionarily conserved RNA motifs. This class of loci includes the majority of the known small
ncRNAs as well as structured RNA motifs in mRNAs. We report here on a genome-wide survey
using RNAz.
Results: We obtain 16 000 high quality predictions among which we recover the majority of the
known ncRNAs. Taking a pessimistically estimated false discovery rate of 40% into account, this
implies that at least some ten thousand loci in the Drosophila genome show the hallmarks of
stabilizing selection action of RNA structure, and hence are most likely functional at the RNA level.
A subset of RNAz predictions overlapping with TRF1 and BRF binding sites [Isogai et al., EMBO J.
26: 79–89 (2007)], which are plausible candidates of Pol III transcripts, have been studied in more
detail. Among these sequences we identify several "clusters" of ncRNA candidates with striking
structural similarities.
Conclusion: The statistical evaluation of the RNAz predictions in comparison with a similar
analysis of vertebrate genomes [Washietl et al., Nat. Biotech. 23: 1383–1390 (2005)] shows that
qualitatively similar fractions of structured RNAs are found in introns, UTRs, and intergenic
regions. The intergenic RNA structures, however, are concentrated much more closely around
known protein-coding loci, suggesting that flies have significantly smaller complement of
independent structured ncRNAs compared to mammals.

Background
High-throughput transcriptome data obtained in particular using tiling arrays [1-6] and cDNA sequencing [7-9] in
conjunction with detailed functional studies of individual
genes have profoundly changed our picture of eukaryotic
gene regulation by emphasizing multiple regulatory layers, many of which involve non-protein-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs). In contrast to protein-coding genes, however,
ncRNAs do not form a homogeneous group of transcripts
but rather belong to a diverse array of classes with vastly
different structures, functions, and evolutionary patterns
[10-16].
Efficient computational methods [17,18] have recently
been developed to determine the genomic inventory of a
large subgroup of ncRNAs, namely those that exhibit evolutionarily conserved secondary structures. As stabilizing
selection acts to preserve structure in the presence of
sequence variation, these transcripts are very likely to have
discernible biological function – as opposed to being a
mere byproduct of transcriptional noise [19] or gene regulation by transcriptional interference [20]. The group of
structured RNAs that we are considering here consequently includes the classical families of small ncRNAs
(tRNAs, rRNAs, miRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, RNAse P
RNA, etc) as well as structured, usually regulatory, motifs
associated with larger coding or non-coding transcripts,
such as internal ribosomal entry sites, IRE, and SECIS signals see e.g. [21]. The RNAz approach [17] has proven to
produce rather high quality predictions. In particular, as
part of the detailed analysis of the ENCODE regions [22],
the verification of many unannotated RNAz predictions
by means of RT-PCR has been reported, and for a substantial fraction of RNAz predictions corroborating evidence
from high-throughput experiments has been obtained.
Computational screens for structured RNAs have been
reported so far for mammalian [22,23], urochordate [24],
nematode [25], and yeast [26,27] genomes. However, no
comprehensive analysis of structured ncRNAs in insect
genomes has been published so far, even though there is
statistical evidence for an enrichment of structured RNAs
within highly conserved non-coding elements of drosophilids [28]. Drosophilids, which have been deeply
sequenced by a consortium coordinated by the NHGRI
[29-31], provide an ideal model system for this task, since
their evolutionary divergence is comparable to those of
mammals. As a consequence, large portions of their
genomes are alignable, while at the same time there is
substantial sequence variation. Both are necessary prerequisites for currently available ncRNA detection tools.
In addition to the statistical evidence for wide-spread
structured RNAs in insects, two recent genome-wide
experimental studies provide evidence of a large reservoir

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/406

of novel ncRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster: Isogai et al.
[32] mapped TRF1 and BRF binding sites in the D. melanogaster genome and showed that, unlike most other
eukaryotes, TRF1/BRF binding appears responsible for the
initiation of all classes of Polymerase-III (Pol III) transcription. As the known Pol III transcripts are small
ncRNAs, their data suggests that drosophilids are likely to
have a large set of previously unannotated small ncRNAs.
A large-scale tiling array study of transcription in the early
development of D. melanogaster [5] found that about 20%
of the observed transcripts in D. melanogaster come from
stand-alone intergenic or intronic sources and may constitute new types of RNAs, including a substantial fraction of
ncRNAs.

Results and Discussion
We report here on a computational screen for structured
RNA motifs in Drosophilids based on 12-species Pecan
alignments provided by the Consortium. The detected
RNAz hits are either (parts of) independently transcribed
non-coding RNAs with evolutionarily conserved secondary structures, or they are structured elements that are
parts of coding transcripts such as SECIS or IRE elements.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Overall, 42 482 RNAz hits corresponding to roughly 5 Mb
in the D. melanogaster genome show evidence of evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structure. About 20%
of these overlap existing annotation. The 16 377 loci of
the high confidence set covers approximately 2.1 Mb of
DNA, see Tab. 1.

In total, 336 hits correspond to known non-coding RNAs
according to at least one source of annotation (FlyBase:
316; BLAST against miRBase: 79; BLAST against Noncode:
44; BLAST against Rfam: 222; tRNAscan: 159). Tab. 2
summarizes the recall of the screen on several "classical"
ncRNAs families. Note that some classes of ncRNAs were
deliberately removed already in the Pecan alignments,
notably the 5S rRNA sequences. We recovered 96% of the
known D. melanogaster miRNAs.
A BLAST search of the drosophilid RNAz hits against the
results of prior RNAz surveys of mammals [23], urochordates [24], and nematodes [25] yielded the following pattern of conservation: 167 tRNA hits and 11 snRNAs
associated with the major spliceosome. Furthermore, we
recover the U6atac snRNA (which was previously unannotated) and 5 microRNAs.
In order to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR), we
repeated the screen with shuffled alignments as described
in [33]. Alignments are shuffled such that two alignment
columns are swapped only if both their gap pattern and
their sequence conservation pattern is the same. This

Table 1: Overall statistics of the RNAz screen. Initial filtering of Pecan alignments leaves roughly 50% as input for RNAz respectively to
the ncRNA prediction. The distribution of RNAz hits does not show a chromosomal bias. We counted the number of predicted loci
and their overall length at two probability thresholds (p > 0.5, p > 0.9) for normal and also randomized alignments. Obtained relative
frequencies (given as percentages) can be interpreted as false discovery rates (FDR). As expected, the FDR decreases with a higher
RNAz p-value.

amounts to a very "gentle" shuffling that in particular preserves pairwise sequence divergence within any given window. This gentle shuffling procedure may fail to remove
the secondary structure signal in some cases because too
few pairs of alignment columns satisfy the stringent conditions for shuffling. This is at least one reason why we
observe 3 239 (7.6%) hits in which true and shuffled
screen intersect, including 53 of the 756 annotated D. melanogaster ncRNAs, almost exclusively tRNAs. The estimated FDR of roughly 50% for p > 0.5 and 40% for the
high quality set in Tab. 1 should therefore be regarded as
pessimistic estimates.
The results of a second, more "vigorous" shuffling
approach lead to much more optimistic estimates: shuffling of the columns without considering their sequence
conservation or gap pattern reduces the estimated FDR by
factor of 35 to only a 1–2%. One may argue, of course,
that shuffling columns independently will change the gap
pattern of the alignment (even though it still conserves
pairwise sequence identities). Hence, this procedure may
well underestimate the FDR. The dramatic difference in
the result highlights a general problem that so far has not

been solved in a satisfactory way, namely how to systematically construct randomized alignments that preserve all
correlation features of the genomic background except the
one under consideration. One important feature which
must be mentioned at this point is dinucleotide content.
Due to the stacking energy contributions in the folding
model, dinucleotide content can affect folding energies
and thus FDR estimates considerably. Since there is still
no way of randomizing alignments preserving dinucleotide content, we cannot control for this effect. However,
we found that, in contrast to mammalian genomes [22],
there is no strong dinucleotide bias in the genomic background of D. melanogaster that effects folding energies.
Therefore, our estimates from mononucleotide shuffled
alignments will not differ dramatically from estimates one
would obtain from controls with the same dinucleotide
content.
In contrast to most previous RNAz screens, we have not
removed coding sequences from the input alignments.
Notably, 8 021 hits for p > 0.5 and 2208 hits for p > 0.9
overlap with annotated coding regions, accounting for
19% and 13% of the RNAz hits, respectively. These

fractions are much smaller than the expected FDRs; we
therefore expect that most of these signals are indeed false
positives. Interestingly, if we base our analysis on the
number of nucleotides that are predicted to lie in regions
with conserved structures instead of counting the RNAz
hits the estimates are reduced to 15%, and 11.5%, respectively (cp. Fig. 1). Conversely, only 12% (8 326) at p > 0.5
and less than 4% (2 522) at p > 0.9 of the annotated coding regions are detected by RNAz. Note that 1 398 RNAz
hits overlap more than one annotated coding region. The
small percentage of RNAz hits in annotated CDS indicates
that even a possibly large number of unannotated coding
sequences will not have a significant impact on the interpretation of the RNAz results in the sense that only a small
fraction of the RNAz hits may be previously unannotated
CDS. To further corroborate this point we have computed
the overlap of the RNAz predictions with various gene prediction tracks available in the UCSC Table Browser,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/406

yielding no significant increase in the number of RNAz
hits located in putative CDS: In total only 11 172 (p > 0.5)
and 3 144 (p > 0.9) RNAz hits lie in regions with any evidence for coding capacity.
Genomic Distribution
The genomic distribution of structured RNA candidates in
D. melanogaster is comparable to the observations in previous RNAz-based screens, see Fig. 1. As in the ENCODE
data [22], the distribution of RNAz hits largely follows the
patterns of sequence conservation. In the fly data, only
5'UTRs show a substantial enrichment relative to the
input data. In contrast, the largest enrichment in the
human ENCODE data was observed from 3'UTRs [22].
The most striking difference between fly and human data
is that the relative fraction of both intronic RNAz hits and
intronic sequence conservation is twice as large in human.

Figure 1
Genomic distribution of D. melanogaster RNAz hits
Genomic distribution of D. melanogaster RNAz hits. We compare genomic locations of the RNAz hits in D. melanogaster for two different classification thresholds with the corresponding distribution of the input alignments (relative to the
current FlyBase gene track from the UCSC Table Browser, April 2004). In addition, the corresponding distribution for the
human ENCODE regions [22] is shown. The numbers differ slightly from ref. [22] since here we have normalized them to
100%. Percentages for the 5'-UTRs are not given due to the very small bar areas; the values are (from left to right): 1.24%,
1.69%, 1.70% and 0.6%. In general, the distribution of structured RNAs closely follows that of conserved sequence, i.e., there is
no strong enrichment of RNAz hits in a particular annotation class. The most striking difference between human and fly is the
much larger fraction of intronic RNAz hits in the ENCODE data.

In a recent article Manak and colleagues [5] describe widespread transcriptional activity in the D. melanogaster
genome during 12 timepoints of early embryonic development detected by genomic tiling arrays. When comparing the RNAz hits to this data, we identify 4 236 (p > 0.5)
and 1 713 (p > 0.9) hits that overlap a Transfrag in any of
the 12 timepoints. A comparison of the fractions of RNAz
hits from normal and control screen which overlap Transfrags in one, several or all timepoints yields, however, no
significant enrichments (see Additional file 1 for details).

intergenic or intronic sources (relative to FlyBase annotation) [5]. Only a relatively small fraction of the novel
independent transcripts (5.1% of the total transcriptional
output) had intergenic origin. In comparison, more than
13% [21.9% of 60%] of the transcriptional output
recorded by comparable methods from the ENCODE
regions has a distal intergenic source (in relation to annotated exons) [22]. This difference is in agreement with
closer association of most RNAz hits with protein coding
genes in the fly.

The distance distribution of intergenic RNAz hits reveals a
striking difference between the situation in the human
and the fly genome, Fig. 2. Since the D. melanogaster
genome is much more compact than the human one, we
need to compare the distribution of the distances between
RNAz hits and the nearest coding sequence relative to the
length distribution of the intergenic regions (IGR). In Fig.
2 we plot the relative frequency of IGR with a length
exceeding a given distance D, and the relative frequency of
RNAz hits with a distance larger than D from the nearest
coding region. If intergenic RNAz hits are uniformly distributed within the IGR, the distribution of RNAz-CDS
distances looks like the distribution of IGR distances, just
shifted to the left by a factor of 4. Indeed, this is observed
in the human data, albeit the shift is a factor between 3
and 4, indicating that the placement of intergenic RNAz
hits in human is nearly uniform, with a small tendency of
avoiding the proximity of coding genes.

Further Annotation of RNAz Predictions
In a recent study, Isogai et al. [32] identified TRF1 and BRF
binding sites using high-resolution genome tiling microarrays and provided evidence that in Drosophila the alternative TRF1/BRF complex appears responsible for the
initiation of all known classes of Pol III transcription. At
the p > 0.9 significance level RNAz hits are about threefold enriched in these regions. We have therefore analyzed
the distribution of RNAz hits within the experimentally
determined TRF1 and BRF binding regions. As reported in
[32], most of the sites correspond to tRNAs, 7SL RNAs,
and a subset of snoRNAs. In addition to these known
ncRNAs, the loci contain 197 unannotated RNAz hits,
which are prime candidates for novel Pol III transcripts.

In contrast, about 40% of the D. melanogaster RNAz hits in
intergenic regions are located adjacent to coding
sequences. This may indicate that current annotation of the
fly genome lists boundaries of protein coding genes that
systematically truncate the UTRs. If this is the case, however, then we would have to interpret more than 15% of
the total RNAz hits as located in UTRs. Our data could be
explained if a situation similar to the minifly gene is prevalent in the fly: For this gene a recent study [34] described
several alternative poly-A sites and multiple small ncRNAs
that are processed from the alternative 3'UTRs. At least one
of these ncRNAs is structured: the snoRNA H1 was also
detected in our screen. In any case, the structured RNAs by
RNAz are on average much more closely linked to protein
coding genes in flies than in human.
On the other hand, a small fraction (≈ 10%) of the intergenic RNAz hits, i.e., the tail in Fig. 2, is located much further away from CDS than expected for random placement.
This suggests the existence of a distinct class of RNAz hits
with a propensity for large IGRs. Most likely, these signals
correspond to independently transcribed ncRNAs.
About 20% of the unannotated transcripts observed in D.
melanogaster early development arise from stand-alone

In order to identify putative microRNAs, we screened all
RNAz hits with RNAmicro [35]. This results in 607 candidates, of which 541 are unannotated so far. 176 of these
signals are located in annotated CDS and are therefore
most likely false positives, leaving 365 plausible microRNA candidates. The recent discovery of hundreds of new
human microRNAs that are not conserved beyond primates strongly suggests that "evolution of miRNAs is an
ongoing process and that along with ancient, highly conserved miRNAs, there are a number of emerging miRNAs"
[36]. In the light of these data, a large number of drosophilid-specific microRNAs does not come unexpected.
Using SnoReport [58], RNAz hits are classified as putative
box H/ACA snoRNAs, of which 4 intersect with previously
annotated snoRNAs. Taking into account that for only 22
of the 250 annotated snoRNAs the annotation distinguishes between box H/ACA (3), box C/D (18), and scaRNAs (1), the small overlap with the existing annotation is
not surprising. Again, recent experimental surveys in other
species, including nematodes [37,38] and mammals [39]
have discovered a substantial number of previously unannotated snoRNAs in these species, suggesting that the current annotation of snoRNAs in D. melanogaster is also far
from complete.
Finally, 1 700 RNAz hits have direct evidence for expression
through ESTs that are not related to protein coding genes,
i.e., through ESTs that do not intersect with the FlyBase,

Distributions of IGR length and distances of RNAz hits to their nearest annotated CDS element in fly and human
Distributions of IGR length and distances of RNAz hits to their nearest annotated CDS element in fly and
human. The two curves with shaded backgrounds show the distribution of IGRs that exceed a given length D for Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. The shape of these curves is very similar. Note that, although distances D < 50 nt
are omitted in the plot, all cumulative distributions of course reach 1 at D = 1. The main difference is that the IGRs in fly are on
average two orders of magnitude shorter. Thick lines indicate the distribution of distances of RNAz hits that have a distance of
more than D from the nearest coding sequence. In humans, this distribution is similar to the IGR distribution, shifted to the left
by a factor of 3 to 4. In contrast, we observe a completely different shape in flies: A fraction of about 40% of the RNAz hits is
located adjacent to the annotated genes. On the other hand, a small fraction of the RNAz hits is located further away from
coding genes than expected. RNAz hits refer to the comprehensive set p > 0.5.

Structure-Based Clustering
Since the 197 RNAz hits that overlap TRF1 or BRF binding
regions [32] are good candidates without annotation for
bona fide ncRNAs, we applied structure-based clustering to
this small subset of our predictions to identify common
secondary structures and, hence, putative novel functional

RNAs. The complete clustering tree as well as a table of the
most prominent clusters is given in the Additional file 1.
Since all clusters have a mean pairwise identity less than
45%, structurally related candidates are typically highly
diverged at sequence level.
In Fig. 3 an example cluster of complex structures is given.

loops in common. All consensus structures show compensatory mutations.
Fig. 4 depicts a large cluster of simple hairpin structures.
They show a relatively high structural conservation (high
structure conservation index, SCI) whereas the sequence
similarity (expressed as main pairwise identity, MPI) is
small.
Phylogenetic Distribution
In order to study the phylogenetic distribution of the
RNAz prediction we determine the last common ancestor
for each RNAz hit that contains the corresponding
sequence in the input alignment. Fig. 5 summarizes these
results for both the true data and the "gentle" control
screen.

More than 50% of the RNAz hits are found only within
the melanogaster subgroup. To interpret this result we compute the ratio of newly appearing RNAz hits and the
branch length for each branch in the tree leading to D.
melanogaster. We observe little variation in the data, with
the exception of a reduced rate of innovation along the
most recent branch. This reduction is, however, most
likely a methodological artefact, since the pairwise mutation distances between D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and
D. sechellia are only about 0.1 and RNAz is known to be
less sensitive for highly similar sequences.
Approximately 12% of the RNAz hits are conserved
throughout all drosophilids. In comparison, a screen of
vertebrate genomes [23] found about 3% of mammalian
RNAz candidates (1 000 out of 36 000) to be conserved
throughout vertebrates.
A comparison of true and shuffled screens furthermore
indicates a small but significant decrease of the FDR with
phylogenetic age of the RNAz hit.

Conclusion
The present computational survey of drosophilid
genomes yields about 16 000 high quality predictions.
Taking into account the (very pessimistically estimated)
false discovery rate of about 40%, this implies that at least
some ten thousand loci in the Drosophila genome show
the hallmarks of stabilizing selection acting on RNA structure, and hence are most likely functional at the RNA
level. The elucidation of these functions, however,
remains elusive in many cases. Here, we have studied a
small subset in more detail. Almost 200 RNAz hits overlap
with loci that are likely to be transcribed by Pol III,
strongly suggesting that these are bona fide ncRNAs. Using
structural clustering, we discovered several groups of
structural similar ncRNA candidates in these regions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/406

This number of putative ncRNAs and a regulatory RNA
element is not unexpected given that about 36 000 high
quality RNAz hits have been found by a similar procedure
in a screen of mammalian genomes [23], which was based
on a comparable size of the input set comprising about
103 Mb of the human genome and a similar number of
putative ncRNAs was reported using the SCFG-based evofold approach [18].
A comparison with the results from a similar RNAz screen
of the human genome [17] and with an analysis of
ENCODE regions [22], shows many similarities and several striking differences. We observe a smaller fraction of
intronic and larger fraction of protein coding hits (cp. Fig.
1) in flies. A comparison of the distances between RNAz
hits and their nearest annotated protein coding sequence
shows that structured RNAs are concentrated much more
strongly around known genes in flies than in human, even
when accounting for the much more compact D. melanogaster genome. This observation agrees with recent tiling array data [5] which showed that a much smaller
fraction of intergenic transcription is truly independent
from surrounding protein coding genes in flies compared
to human [6].
The inventory of structurally conserved RNAs is only a
very small subset of the total non-coding transcriptional
output, which covers most of the non-repetitive genome
[5]. The current computational approach relies on substantial sequence conservation. Indeed many of the
known ncRNAs that were missed in our survey were not in
the input set. In fact, RNAz explicitly requires two independent signals for stabilizing selection: (1) sequence
conservation so that a good alignment can be computed
as input, and (2) stabilizing selection on RNA secondary
structure in the presence of sequence variation. RNAz hits
are therefore subject to specific selection pressures that
make it highly likely that RNAz predictions have distinctive biological function. In contrast, it has been shown
recently, that in some cases, such as the bithoraxoid
ncRNAs of the Drosophila bithorax complex, ncRNA transcription itself, acting in cis, represses a target gene (in this
case Ubx) [20]. In such a scenario, however, we do not
expect to observe high levels of sequence conservation of
the non-coding transcripts or the tell-tale substitution patterns of conserved secondary structures.

Methods
Data Sources
For our analysis we used the Pecan [40] alignment of the
12 drosophilid genomes [30,31] of the Comparable Analysis Freeze 1 (CAF1, Feb. 2006). The alignments were
downloaded from [31,41]. We favored the Pecan alignments over two other sets of drosophilid alignments that
are available at [31,42]. Visual inspection strongly

Phylogenetic distribution of ncRNA candidates
Phylogenetic distribution of ncRNA candidates. The tree only represents the topology and is not drawn to scale. Branch
lengths are indicated below by large numbers in sans serif font, measured in terms of substitutions per site for 4-fold degenerated sites. For each branch we mark the number of RNAz hits for p > 0.5 and p > 0.9, respectively above the branch leading to
the last common ancestor (LCA) of the sequences in the corresponding input alignment (full boxes). Below the branches we
indicate the corresponding numbers for the "gentle" control screen. Below the tree the ratio of the fraction of newly appearing
RNAz hits and the branch length is given, indicating little variation in the "innovation rate". Since the original tree is unrooted
without an outgroup, no data are available for the branch separating Sophophora from the rest. The number of RNAz hits listed
in the tree is smaller than the total number of RNAz hits because we only considered sequences present in all single windows
of an RNAz hit here.

suggested that Mavid alignments [43,44] are more biased
towards protein coding regions. We did not use the Multiz
alignments, because they contain three additional
genomes (insects), and removing those sequences would
effectively require a complete realignment in order to
obtain a fair comparison between screens performed on
different input alignments. The Pecan alignments comprise the D. melanogaster chromosomes 2L (22.4 Mb), 2R
(20.8 Mb), 3L (23.8 Mb), 3R (27.9 Mb), 4 (1.3 Mb), and
X (22.2 Mb).

Preprocessing of Input Alignments
The current implementation of RNAz is restricted to input
alignments containing at most 6 sequences and a
maximum length of 400 nt due to the training of the
underlying SVM [17]. In addition, certain restrictions
apply for the fraction of gaps and on the overall base composition as a consequence of the data sets that were used
to train the SVM model. The original genomic alignments
thus need to be re-processed. The protocol used in this
contribution closely follows that of previous RNAz-based
studies:

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:406

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/406

Alignments longer than 120 nt are cut into 120 nt slices in
40 nt steps, so that subsequent slices overlap in 80 nt. This
default length is motivated by the fact that many structured RNAs are less than 100 nt long. Such short signals
would "drown" in the noise of longer alignments that are
then mostly unstructured. On the other hand, alignments
that are too short do not yield reliable signals for secondary structure conservation. In a series of filtering steps,
sequences were removed from the individual alignments
or alignment slices if they are (a) shorter than 50 nt, or (b)
contain more than 25% gap characters, or (c) have a base
composition outside the definition range of RNAz (e.g.
GC content > 0.75 or < 0.25).
Alignments were discarded completely if fewer than 3
sequences were left after the filtering steps, or they did not
contain a D. melanogaster sequence, since this species
serves as a reference and as the basis for subsequent annotation. All preprocessing steps were performed using the
script rnazWindows.pl of the current release of the RNAz
package [45].
For alignment slices with more than 6 sequences,
rnazWindows.pl selects a representative subset consisting
of the D. melanogaster sequence and five additional
sequences in such a way that 6 sequences are as evenly distributed in the dataset as possible and approach an average pairwise sequence identity of 80%, the optimal
working range of the RNAz program. In practice that
means that only a single representative from nearly identical sequences is chosen, and highly divergent sequences
are excluded provided there is sufficient sequence variation in the remaining alignment. For the technical details
of the procedure we refer to the documentation of the
RNAz package .[45]
Tab. 1 summarizes the initial filtering steps. Roughly 50%
of the nucleotides in the Pecan alignments are still contained in the RNAz input data.
RNAz Classification and Annotation
RNAz was applied to the filtered input alignment slices in
both reading directions. Overlapping slices with a positive
ncRNA classification probability of p > 0.5 were combined
using rnazCluster.pl to a single annotation element,
which we will refer to as "RNAz hit". From these data, we

extract a subset of high confidence RNAz hits that contain
at least one slice with a prediction confidence of p > 0.9.
In order to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) of the
screen we repeated the entire procedure with shuffled
input alignments as described in [33]. The alignments
were (1) shuffled using the rnazRandomizeAln.pl script
(part of the RNAz package). It wraps a conservative shuffling procedure that maintains local characteristics of an
alignment, e.g. columns with the same gap and conservation pattern. All remaining RNAz hits of this control
screen are then shuffled once again (2) using a more stringent shuffling method that explicitly shuffles all columns
of a given alignment randomly (cp. Tab. 3).
The RNAz hits were annotated using the D. melanogaster
sequence as reference. We performed the following annotation steps:
• Overlap with known D. melanogaster annotation
We used the coordinates of a set of D. melanogaster noncoding RNAs, publicly available as gff files at [46] and
[31,47] to identify already known D. melanogaster ncRNAs
among our predictions. Furthermore, we computed the
overlap of the RNAz hits with the CDS annotations from
[31,48] (file = dmel-all-r4.3.filtered.gff) and [49] (file =
all_caf1_DGIL_TEX.gff).
• Overlap with public non-coding RNA databases
We furthermore performed BLAST [50] searches using
rnazBlast.pl against the Rfam (version 7.0) [51], Noncode
(version 1.0) [52], ncRNAdb [53], FlyBase (version 2006
00.2 Beta) [54,55], and miRBase (version 9.0) [56].
• Tools for annotation of specific RNA families
We furthermore used tRNAscan [57] to annotate tRNAs
and RNAmicro [35] to classify putative microRNAs.
RNAmicro is an SVM based classification method that
evaluates both thermodynamic stability and evolutionary
conservation patterns.
We used SnoReport to recognize putative snoRNAs (for
technical details see [58]). Similar to RNAmicro, SnoRe-

port is composed of a pre-filter, a secondary structure prediction step, and a subsequent SVM-based classificator. In
brief, the prefilter searches for consecutive H (pattern:
ANANNA) and ACA boxes [59]. In the second step, the
constraint folding option of RNAfold [60] is used to compute the secondary structure subject to the constraint that
both boxes remain unpaired. If this results in an snoRNAlike secondary structure, several sequence and structure
features are computed and passed to an SVM for classification. The model was trained on the set of snoRNAs that
can be downloaded from the snoRNABase [61]. C/D box
and scaRNAs represented the negative and H/ACA box
snoRNA sequences the positive samples. Estimated positive and negative prediction values for the model used
here are 80% and 99.9%, respectively.
Structure-based clustering was performed as described in
[62]: The modified Sankoff algorithm implemented in the
LocARNA program is used to compute local structural
alignments and their consensus structure. The clustering
tree is obtained by agglomerative clustering using
LocARNA alignment scores as distance measures. To avoid
that large scores influence the distance transformation we
define distances by d(i, j) = max(0; q - score(i, j)), where q
is here the 99% quantil of all pairwise scores. Since the
procedure is computationally very demanding we have
restricted this type of analysis here to a small subset of
RNAz hits that are likely Pol III transcripts.
The phylogenetic relationships within drosophilids are
taken from the AAA (Alignment/Analysis/Annotation of
12 related Drosophila species) web site [63]. Branch lengths
are genomic mutation distances computed from 4-fold
degenerate sites in all coding regions corrected for base
composition as in [31][64]. In order to determine the
branch in the phylogenetic tree at which an RNAz hit first
appears, we determine the last common ancestor (LCA) of
the sequences in the corresponding input alignment and
assign the RNAz hit to the branch in the tree leading to
this internal node. Due to the fact that RNAz hits are a
combination of single windows and each window represents a specific selection of sequences out of an n-way
alignment, we only considered those sequences for the
LCA analysis which are simultaneously present at all
windows.
