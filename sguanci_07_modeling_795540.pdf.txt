Abstract
Background: During the HIV infection several quasispecies of the virus arise, which are able to
use different coreceptors, in particular the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors (R5 and X4
phenotypes, respectively). The switch in coreceptor usage has been correlated with a faster
progression of the disease to the AIDS phase. As several pharmaceutical companies are starting
large phase III trials for R5 and X4 drugs, models are needed to predict the co-evolutionary and
competitive dynamics of virus strains.
Results: We present a model of HIV early infection which describes the dynamics of R5
quasispecies and a model of HIV late infection which describes the R5 to X4 switch. We report the
following findings: after superinfection (multiple infections at different times) or coinfection
(simultaneous infection by different strains), quasispecies dynamics has time scales of several
months and becomes even slower at low number of CD4+ T cells. Phylogenetic inference of
chemokine receptors suggests that viral mutational pathway may generate a large variety of R5
variants able to interact with chemokine receptors different from CXCR4. The decrease of CD4+
T cells, during AIDS late stage, can be described taking into account the X4-related Tumor
Necrosis Factor dynamics.
Conclusion: The results of this study bridge the gap between the within-patient and the interpatients (i.e. world-wide) evolutionary processes during HIV infection and may represent a
framework relevant for modeling vaccination and therapy.

Background
The relationship between phenotype and survival of the
genotype is central to both genetics and evolution. Viruses
represent a good sized-complexity phenotype to study
and they show rapid evolution. Selection pressures
mainly depend on the interaction strength with the recep-

tor vital for the entry into the target cell. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is characterized
by the progressive loss of CD4+ T cells. Infection by most
strains of HIV-1 requires interaction with CD4 and a
chemokine receptor, either CXCR4 or CCR5. During early
stages of HIV-1 infection, viral isolates most often use

CCR5 to enter cells and are known as R5 HIV-1. Later in
the course of HIV-1 infection, viruses that use CXCR4 in
addition to CCR5 (R5X4) or CXCR4 alone (X4 variants)
emerge in about 50% patients (switch virus patients)
[1,2]. These strains are syncytium-inducing and are capable of infecting not only memory T lymphocytes but also
naive CD4+ T cells and thymocytes through the CXCR4
coreceptor. The switch to using CXCR4 has been linked to
an increased virulence and progression to AIDS, probably
through the formation of cell syncytia and apoptosis of T
cell precursors. X4 HIV strains are rarely, if ever, transmitted, even when the donor predominantly carries X4 virus.
Clevestig [3] found that in children, the X4 virus developed from their own R5 population, and was not caused
by transmission from the mother. CXCR4 is expressed on
a majority of CD4+ T cells and thymocytes, whereas only
about 5 to 25% of mature T cells and 1 to 5% of thymocytes express detectable levels of CCR5 on the cell surface
[4]. It is noteworthy that X4 HIV strains stimulate the production of cellular factor called Tumor Necrosis Factor
(TNF), which is associated with immune hyperstimulation, a state often implicated in T-cell depletion [5].
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) is produced mainly by monocytes; it is a
type II transmembrane protein belonging to the TNF family, homologous to Fas ligand (FasL), which is a well-characterized apoptosis-inducing ligand. In particular the Fasassociated domain or a Fas-associated domain-like adaptor molecule leads to activation of the caspase cascade,
resulting in apoptotic cell death. TNF seems able to both
inhibit the replication of R5 HIV strains while having no
effect on X4 HIV and to down regulate the number of
CCR5 co-receptors that appear on the surface of T-cells
[6]. Plasma TRAIL is elevated in HIV-1 infected patients
and is decreased by Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy
(HAART). Thus, when HAART decreased viral load, there
is a concomitant decrease in plasma TRAIL, which may be
one of the reasons for the efficacy of antiviral therapy [7].
Mathematical modeling
The use of mathematical models is an insightful and
essential complement to in vivo and in vitro experimental
design and interpretation. Indeed mathematical models
of HIV dynamics have proven valuable in understanding
the mechanisms of many of the observed features of the
progression of the HIV infection, see for example [8-15].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S5

and of co-infection (simultaneous infection), superinfection (delayed secondary infection) and selection, that
keep variability low. HIV-1-infected individuals show heterogeneous viral populations, best described as viral quasispecies [16]. Infact, the infection capacity of mutants
may vary and also their speed of replication [17].
Moreover, since the number of targets (the substrate) is
limited, fitter clones tend to eliminate less fit mutants,
which are subsequently regenerated by the mutation
mechanism. Mutations are a key ingredient for exploring
the genetic space in the search for the fitness maximum,
but are also responsible for the disappearance of the quasispecies when exceeding a critical mutation rate, the error
threshold [18].
Taking into account state-of-the-art models of HIV infection, we address the issue of studying the coevolutive and
competitive dynamics of different strains of HIV-1 virus
also leading to the R5 to X4 phenotype switching. Ribeiro
and colleagues [19] have recently presented a model of R5
to X4 switch based on the hypothesis that X4 and R5
viruses have a preferential tropism for naive and memory
T cells, respectively. Here we prefer to follow the mutational hypothesis supported by several experiments [1-4].
In the next section we introduce two models: a quasispecies model for R5 phase in which several R5 strains appear
by mutations, co-infection and superinfection. In the
limit of a single quasispecies we are able to find the same
values observed experimentally and in other models
(most notably Perelson's standard model). We test the
model in the scenarios of co-infection and superinfection
using parameters derived from biological and medical literature. A second model focuses on the R5 to X4 shift and
the hyperstimulation of T cell precursors through TNF.
The results of the numerics reproduce well the decreasing
dynamics of CD4+ after the appearance of X4 strains and
make the model suitable for further investigations on
antiretroviral therapies and their effects on disease progression. The R5 to X4 switch is also investigated by using
phylogenetic models of the amino acid sequences of the
human and mice chemokine receptor families. The analysis of the mutational pathway suggests that the switch
from R5 to X4 may allow the HIV to bind to other chemokine receptors, thus likely leading to immune system signaling disfunctions.

Results and discussion
A powerful concept in understanding HIV variability and
its consequences is that of quasispecies, accounting for the
result of evolution not being the selection of a single
sequence (genotype), rather a distribution of quasi-identical sequences, termed the quasispecies, centered around a
master sequence. Quasispecies are the combined result of
mutations and recombination, that originate variability,

Modeling HIV dynamics and the immune response
The basic model of HIV-1 dynamics, first introduced by
Perelson and colleagues in 1995 [8], is a class model considering three variables: uninfected cells, infected cells
and free viruses. A system of three differential equations
describes how these quantities change over time. In the
basic model by Perelson uninfected cells encounter free

virus and turn into infected cells. The rate of production
of infected cells is proportional to the product of the density of uninfected cells times the density of free virions.
Free virions are produced by infected cells. Uninfected
cells, infected cells and free virions die at fixed rate. Uninfected cells are also assumed to be constantly replaced by
the immune system. These assumption define the basic
model of virus dynamics.
We extended this basic model of HIV-1 dynamics, by
including the response by the immune system and the
role of B lypmhocytes, see Figure 1. There are several
works that discuss the role of B cells in the immune
response [20]. Since the progression to AIDS has been
found to correlate well with CD4+ T cells decrease, B cells
are thought to play a minor role in the immune response
to HIV. Note that B cells can act only as predator to the
HIV, so their coupling with HIV dynamics is different
from that of T cells. Our aim is to present a more general
model framework of both T and B immune responses to
HIV. We have first considered the following system of dif-

ferential equations describing the dynamics of a single
viral strain:

T = (λ + γ(T)IT)(1 - T/K) -(δT + βV)T,

(1)

I = βVT - (δI + γ(I)T)I,

(2)

V = πI - (c + γ(V)T)V.

(3)

This model considers the T-helper (CD4+) cells (T) and
HIV virus particles (V); the T cells can become infected (I).
With respect to Refs. [8,9], in Eq. (1), we describe how the
number of naive T cells (T) which have passed the thymus
selection, depends on rate of formation in the bone marrow (λ) and on clonal amplification upon stimulation by
infected cells, I (term IT). They decrease with a rate that is
the sum of a natural clearance (δTT) due to cell aging and
cell destruction upon virus infection, (VT). The density of
T cells is limited by a saturating density/lymphonode
capacity factor, K. Following Ref. [14] we have set K =
1012.
The second equation describes the rate of infection,
described by β, of naive T cells upon the interaction with
the virus (term VT). Infected T cells are cleared out at a
fixed rate, δI, and due to the action of natural killer cells,
CD8+ (term TI).
The third equation describes the budding of viruses from
infected cells, π. Virus particles are cleared out at rate c
(defective viruses) and after immunoglobulin binding
and subsequent engulfments by the macrophages (term
TV).
The γ parameters have the same meaning of the constant
of association in chemistry, or can be thought as a combination of both the probability of interaction and the interaction strengths between cells (γ(T), γ(I)) or between cells
and viruses (γ(V)). Note that in the limit γ → 0 and K → ∞,
we recover the pattern of the standard model [13].

At the same time HIV peptides are presented via APC cells

The B cell response is modeled using the parameters corresponding to the T cells which activate them by receptor
recognition. Here, we have assumed the immunoglobulin
concentration, which represent the B cell response, to be
linearly correlated to the concentration of activated B
cells. These in turn are supposed linearly correlated to the
concentration of the CD4+ T cells. Exploratory analysis
with different parameters, suggested us that Eq. (3) allows
to keep a minimum number of parameters without loss of
important details.

A quasispecies framework
A meaningful model to study the evolution of a viral population is that of quasispecies. The quasispecies concept
was put forward by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster [21]
within the framework of physical chemistry. Their model
accounts for the description of the process of the Darwinian evolution of self-replicating entities and shows that
the result of evolution is not the selection of a single
sequence, rather a distribution of sequences centered
around a master sequence. The quasispecies behavior of
viruses is nowadays recognised as a key element for the
understanding and modeling of viral evolution and disease control [22]. The extreme mutation rate of RNA
genetic elements, together with their large population
sizes, endows them with the characteristics of quasispecies
populations. Most progeny genomes of individual
(clonal) RNA viruses generally differ from one another in
having one or more mutations scattered randomly along
their genomes; thus comprising a quasispecies cloud or
swarm of related, but not identical variants.

A quasispecies model of HIV infection can be derived by
the model previously introduced. We adopt a quasispecies
description of the process by first hypothesizing the evolution of the virus to be characterized by only one slight
changing phenotypic trait, e.g. the shape of the envelope
and its corresponding binding affinity. This assumption is
justified if the phenotypes are determined by few viral
protein functional determinants which are both independent and differ only few DNA bases, i.e. few mutations
can change one determinant into another. This corresponds to map the different phenotypes of the virus on a
linear space (see [23,24] for similar assumptions). In fact
this binding does not need to be a perfect match, but has
a certain degree of tolerance. Similar phenotypes compete
for the same coreceptor and mutations can be the key factor to give origin to a new phenotype able to use a different coreceptor. On the other hand T lymphocytes look
forward to kill infected T cells and free virions. Their recognition ability of viral antigens depends on the binding
between a T cell receptor (TCR) and a viral epitope.
Based upon the above schematization, the population of
T cells can be thought of as composed by different phenotypes corresponding to the different TCRs and the virus
populations as characterized by a specific binding ability.
Thus the clonal amplification of naïve T cells (of population i) depends on the ability of (ith class) T cell to recognize all the infected T cells (carrying an epitope from the
kth class of viruses). The rate of infection of naïve T cells (of
class i) depends on all the viruses (containing the epitope
k). In the same way, the clonal expansion of infected T
cells (of class k, meaning that they have been infected by
a virus of class k irrespective of the original T class)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S5

depends on the interaction of these viruses with all the T
cells (of any class i).
It's noteworthy that this schematization is valid for the
quasispecies case and for the undifferentiated one. In the
latter case, the indication of strains (in parenthesis)
should be neglected.
A model of the early R5 phase evolution
In someone who is newly infected by HIV, several variants
of the virus, called R5, are often the only kind of virus that
can be found. A meaningful way to model strain mutations, coinfection and superinfection is to extend the
model previously introduced by incorporating multi
strain evolutive dynamics. Thus the R5 quasispecies
dynamics can be described by the following set of equations:

The following cell types are considered: T-helper (CD4+)
cells carrying the CCR5 co-receptor responding to virus
strain i, (Ti); T cells infected by virus strain k, (Ik); k strains
of R5 virus, (Vk). We have thus assumed that viral strain k
are identified by just one epitope, which is then displayed
on the surface of the T cell of class k, and that a T cell of
class i can be activated at least by one CD4+ T cell carrying
the epitope k, which is specific of the viral strain k. The
indices i (k) range from 1 to Ni (Nk), and in the following
we have used Ni = Nk = N.
In Equation (4) T cells are generated through two mechanisms: the bone-marrow source (and selection in the thymus) and the duplication of T cell strains activated upon
the recognition with an antigen carrying cell that may be
even an infected one. We modeled T cells activation as a
logistic term mimicking the global carrying capacity (the
K parameter) of immune system [25].
The death-rate term is composed by a natural death rate
proportional to the population, and by the infection rate
of T cells due to any viral strain. The term ∑kβkVkTi and the
sum over Ti in the I cell birth rate reproduce the infection
probability, that is the same irrespective of the T class. As

immune response.

supplies through hyperactivation of the immune system
that lead to CD4 depletion in HIV-1 infection.

Equation (5) describes the infection dynamics. The two
death rate parameters account for the decrease of the
infected cells due to cellular death and after the action of
T-killer cells (CD8+). Even if there are clear experimental
evidences that CD4+ cells decrease during the late HIV
infection stages and in the AIDS state, as far as the asymptomatic phase of the infection is concerned, the parameter
δI may be assumed as a constant, medical literature
referred, value.

We here introduce a modified version of the previous
model, that considers only CD4 dynamics. Neither B nor
CD8+ T cells are explicitly modeled and the space that is
considered is that of different phenotypes of the virus.
Under those assumptions we may focus on the appearance of X4 viruses and on their subsequent interaction
with R5 strains.

The µkk' term is responsible of the mutation process affecting the phenotype, essential for the formation of new quasispecies. The choice of a mutation rate of the order of 105 is based on considering only those non-synonymous
mutations that alter the phenotype (protein structure)
[25].
In Equation (6) the virus replicative dynamics is
described. The birth rate term is proportional to the virus
"budding" numerosity while the viral death rate parameters depend on the rate of natural death and accounts for
the recognition of virus by B cells.
It's worth noting that B-cells and T-killer cells are only
implicitly included in the model in order to reduce the
dimensionality without loosing too many details. We
assume that these responses are fast enough to be at equilibrium and they are just proportional to the abundance
of (cognate) T helper cells.
The three γ parameters γ(T), γ(I) and γ(V) are matrices
describing the interactions between cells and/or cells and
viruses, i.e. who will interact with whom, in terms of
geometry and strength of the interaction. It is thus possible to consider which strains of the virus are recognized
and with which accuracy, and the same for the action of T-

In the equations above, the variables modeled are the
pool of immature CD4+ T cells, U, the different strains of
uninfected and infected T cells (T and I, respectively), HIV
virus, V, and the excess of TNF concentration, F. TNF concentration, in uninfected people, i.e. when X4 = 0, has a
low basal value. Here we consider the excess of TNF abundance, by assuming its concentration to be proportional
to the X4 concentration. A schematic view of the model is
depicted in Figure 2. The value of the parameters introduced with respect to the R5 model are summarized in
Table 1.

(T )

killer cells and B-cells. It is also worth noting that γ ii is
the most important determinant of the viral fitness [25].
Modeling the transition R5 to X4
In about half of the people who develop advanced HIV
disease, the virus begins to use another co-receptor called
CXCR4 (X4 viral phenotype). The shift to using CXCR4 it
is generally accompanied by a dramatic increase in the
rate of T-cell depletion. The inability of the thymus to efficiently compensate for even a relatively small loss of naive
T cells may be a key factor for CD4+ T cells depletion and
AIDS progression. We hypothesize that it may not be
exhaustion of homeostatic responses, but rather thymic
homeostatic failure along with gradual wasting of T cell

In particular, Equation (7) describes the constant production of immature T cells by the thymus NU and their differentiation into mature T cells at rate δU. If X4 viruses are
present, upon the interaction with TNF, immature T-cells
U
are cleared at fixed rate δ F .

Equation (8) describes how uninfected mature T cells of
strain i are produced at fixed rate δU by the pool of immature T cells. Those cells, upon the interaction with any
strain of the virus, Vk, become infected at rate βk = β ∀ k.
The infectiousness parameter, β, is not constant over time,
but depends on the interplay between R5 and X4 viruses.
In particular, due to the increase in TNF abundance upon

Equation (10) is close to that in the R5 quasispecies
model, a part from different viral phenotypes being here
considered.

Finally, in Equation (11), we model the dynamics of accumulation of TNF by assuming the increase in TNF level to
be proportional, via the constant kF, to the total concentration of X4 viruses present.

Naïve T-cells, U, are generated at constant rate NU and
removed at rate δU. They give birth to differentiated, uninfected T-cells, T. These in turn are removed at constant rate
δT and become infected as they interact with the virus.
Infected T-cells, I, die at rate δI and contribute to the budding
of viral particles, V, that are cleared out at rate c. As soon as
the X4 phenotype arise, the production of the TNF starts,
proportional to the X4 concentration and contribute to the

clearance of naïve T-cells, via the δ F parameter.

X4 emergence, the infectivity of R5 strains is reduced
(βR5(t) = β - kR5F(t)), while the one of X4 viruses increases,
with constant of proportionality kX4 (βX4(t) = β + kX4 F(t)),
mimicking the cell syncytium effect induced by the TNF
molecule.
Equation (9) describes the infection of mature T-cells.

virus of strain k with any of the mature T-cell strains. The

Investigating the mutational pathway from R5 to X4
In our model we represent the different phenotypes by
using a linear strain space ordered in terms of phenotype
similarity. Although we are aware of the several recent
works on HIV mutational dynamics and phylogenetic
assessments, we thought that a meaningful way to estimate the mutational pathways between R5 and X4 seen is
to use phylogenetic inference on chemokine receptor families. The assessment of phylogenies using likelihood
framework depends on the choice of an evolutionary
model [26]. We computed the maximum likelihood (ML)
analysis of the CRs data set under different models of evolution: [27], JTT [28], WAG [29]. We used these models
considering the incorporation of the amino acid frequencies of the chemokine data sets, ('+F '), and the heterogeneity of the rates of evolution, implemented using a
gamma distribution ('+Γ') [30,31].
Results
We have first extended Perelson's standard model to
incorporate different antigen recognition abilities by the
immune system and coexistence dynamics of different R5
strains of HIV virus. Our approach is a mean field one, i.e.
we investigate the average quantities of these molecular
species [32-36]. Then, we have modified the model to
describe features of the latent phase of the infection, i.e.
the R5 to X4 switch and the hyperstimulation of the T cell
precursors through the TNF. Finally we have analysed the
results of the phylogenetic inference on chemokine receptors.
Amplification of R5 strains: mutation, co-infection and super-infection
Recent works have shown that HIV quasispecies may compete [22,37] and that persistence of the initial or ancestor
quasispecies is a good indicator for disease progression
[38]. Burch and Chao [39] have shown that the evolution
of an RNA virus is determined by its mutational neighborhood. As the phenotype divergence among viral strains
arises from differences in selection pressure, these differences may lead, for instance, to a higher infection rate.
Since the competition is through the immune system
response and given that the phase space of antigen recognition is not homogeneously covered [40], the HIV high
mutation rate allows the quasispecies to find regions with
weak immune response. This competition may lead to
speciation of viral strains.

If we consider the model of the early phase of the infection, the evolution of T cells abundances in a scenario of
quasispecies is shown in Figure 3a. Here we consider five
viral phenotypes being differently recognized by the
immune system. In particular, the recognition strength,
corresponding to the selection pressure on viruses, is
reported on the right y-axis in the inset of the figure as a
dashed line. The temporal evolution of different T cells
strains is characterized by the amplification of the T cells
clones responding to viral infection, while asymptotic
viral abundance is represented as solid stems in the inset.
The asymptotic state of our model is a fixed point, thus the
asymptotic distribution is insensitive of the initial conditions and the more abundant strains are that corresponding to the lower pressure exerted by the immune system
(see inset of Figure 3b). However, one should consider
that this asymptotic state may be reached after such a long
time that it may be outside any practical scenario of the
progression of a disease. The role of mutations in the transitory regime is quite particular. First of all, starting from
the first inoculum at time t = 0 on the zeroth phenotype,
mutations are necessary to populate the other strains of
the virus, see also Figure 3. Moreover, in the presence of
coupling among strains, due to competition or to a global
constraints (the K parameter), the specific form of mutations does not play a fundamental role, see also Ref. [41].
Figures 4a and 4b show the results of short and long term
viral coevolution after superinfection. We considered the
first viral inoculum to happen at time t = 0, with the superinfection event occurring at time t = 20 days, when the
immune response to the first inoculum has completed
and the virus has established a chronic infection. After the
second inoculum the model exhibits a short transient, followed by a slow mounting of the second infection. Due to

the resulting low dynamics, the time needed by the second quasispecies to reach the same level of the other
amounts to several months (Figure 4a) and represents
another example of a slow relaxation toward a fixed-point
equilibrium. We may also account for the progression of
the disease by considering a weak immune system, for
example being characterized by a lower thymic activity,
i.e. a lower value of λ, with respect to the previous scenario. In this case the strain corresponding to the second
inoculum requires much longer time to reach the same
abundances of the first strain.
We have also investigated how the co-evolutionary and
competitive dynamics of viral strains, mediated by the
immune response, may lead to the formation of new viral
quasispecies. We have considered a phenotypic space of
25 strains; this is an estimate of the number of different
phenotypes (such those targeting different cell receptors
or having different binding specifity for the same receptor) while the effective number of strains may be much
larger. In Figure 5 the initial inoculum is at phenotype 15
(Figure 5a). In this simulation, since the immune system
does not discriminate among similar phenotypes, there is
an induced competition among neighboring strains. The
result of this induced competition is the separation of the
original quasispecies into two clusters (quasi-speciation),
Figure 5b. However the immune system response continues to change in time (Figures 5c–d), resulting into a complex coevolution with viral populations.
R5 to X4 switch
Research into HIV dynamics has much to gain from investigating the evolution of chemokine co-receptor usage.
Although CCR5 and CXCR4 are the major coreceptors
used by HIV-1 a number of chemokine receptors display

coreceptor activities in vitro. Several other chemokine
receptors, possibly not present on the T cell membrane,
may act as targets. To date, a number of human receptors,
specific for these chemokine subfamilies, have been
described, though many receptors are still unassigned.
Several viruses, for example Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes Samiri, contain functional homologous
to human CRs, an indication that such viruses may use
these receptors to subvert the effects of host chemokines
[42]. Cells different from CD4 and CD8, such as macrophages, express lower levels of CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4
on the cell surface compared with CD4+ T cells [43-45],
and low levels of these receptors expressed on macaque
macrophages can restrict infection of some non-M-tropic
R5 HIV-1 and X4 simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)
strains [46,47].

Viral counts, V, during a superinfection scenario. Viral
counts, V, during a superinfection scenario. We set N = 5 and
no mutation is considered, thus µ = 0. (a) A slow mounting
of the second viral infection (ᮀ), having time scale of several
months, is observed. In (b) a compromised immune system is
considered. The time for the second strain to reach the same
abundance of the first-infecting strain ( ) is greater than in
(a).

We studied the coevolutive dynamics leading to X4 strain
appearance by successive mutations of the ancestor R5
strain. The stimulated production of TNF regulate the
interactions between immune response and the virus and
between the different strains of HIV virus. The results of
these interactions are a decline in T-cells level, leading to
the AIDS phase of the disease, and the decline in levels of
viruses using the R5 coreceptor. In Figure 6 we report the
result of the numerical simulations of the infection. The
early stages of the infection are characterized by R5 strains.
As time goes on, mutation accumulates that finally lead to
the X4 phenotype appearance. After a short transitory
regimes, T cells abundance starts declining. We have
finally studied the influence of switching co-receptor
usage in superinfection dynamics. In Figure 7 we show Tcells dynamics for different times of the superinfection
event. We may observe that if the superinfection occurs
after the appearance of the X4, the new R5 strain does not
have any effect on T-cells behavior. On the other hand is
worth noting that if the new R5 inoculum takes place
before the X4 appearance, this may speed up the switching
to the X4 phenotype if the new strain is mutationally close
to the X4.
Investigating the mutational pathway between R5 and X4
Fundamental to the evolutionary approach is the representation of the evolution of sequences along lineages of

evolutionary trees, as these trees describe the complex patterns of dependence amongst sequences that are caused
by their common ancestry [29,48,49].
The ML tree, obtained using the JTT+F+Γ model of evolution, is shown in Figure 8. The topology clearly shows that
the CCR family is not homogeneous: CCR6, CCR7, CCR9
and CCR10 are separated from the other CCRs; in particular, CCR10 clusters with CXCRs; CXCR4 and CXCR6 do
not cluster with the CXCRs. The tree shows that there are
many mutational steps between CCR5 and CXCR4. The
phylogeny suggests that the mutations that allow the virus
env to cover a wide phenotypic distance from R5 to X4,
may also lead to visit other receptors.

Conclusion
The worldwide presence of several strains of the HIV virus
and their often simultaneous presence within a patient,
due to the increased frequency of multiple infections, are
the remarkable features of HIV pandemia. For example,
HIV-1 exists as several groups, subdivided into a growing
number of subtypes which are slightly predominant in
different geographical regions [50]. HIV-1-infected CD4+
T cells isolated from the spleens of two individuals were
recently shown to harbor anywhere between one and
eight proviruses, with an average of three to four proviruses per cell [51]. Mutations, recombination and selection pressure cause the appearance of quasispecies [52].

We first presented a model of the within-patience persistence of HIV quasispecies, by extending to multiple strain
the Perelson's standard model [13]. This approach allows
to incorporate coevolutive and competitive dynamics

considered. Our model shows that the time evolution of
the competition between quasispecies is slow and has
time scales of several months.
Phylogenetic inference of chemokine receptors shows that
there are several mutational patterns linking CCR5 to several receptors that have the same branch length of that
from CCR5 to CXCR4. The evolutive dynamics towards
the selection of X4 requires a preferential binding to a
CXCR4 receptor. Recent works show that TNF is a prognostic marker for the progression of HIV disease [5,7] and
has role in regulating the interactions between the different strains of HIV virus. The second model we have introduced shows that keeping low the concentration of TNF,

both the depletion of T-cells precursors repertoire and the
X4 dominance over R5 strains slow down.
The observed co-evolutionary dynamics of virus and
immune response opens the way to the challenging possibility of the introduction or modulation of a quasispecies
to be used in therapy against an already present aggressive
strain, as experimented by Snell and colleagues [53,54].
Different drug treatments can alter the population of quasispecies. Will R5 blocking drugs cause HIV to start using
X4? And will that be worse than letting the R5-using virus
stay around along at its own, slower, but no less dangerous activity? The presence of a large number of R5 will
increase the mutational spectra in R5 strains (late R5) and
the probability of getting closer to the binding specificities
of other chemokine receptors. Therefore, our model suggests that a therapy such the HAART to decrease the HIV
load should be started the sooner the better. The large
effect of TNF on T cells dynamics described by our model,
suggests the benefit of a TNF buffering therapy. It is
known that the dynamics of TNF is related to the dynamics of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). In
this model we consider constant the concentration of
TRAIL [7] and we do not consider many other important
players such as Rantes.

Our models represent also a general framework to investigate intermittency or switching dominance of strains and
the arising of new dominant strains during different
phases of therapy; how superinfection will evolve in case
of replacement of drug-resistant virus with a drug-sensitive virus and acquisition of highly divergent viruses of
different strains; to investigate whether antiviral treatment
may increase susceptibility to superinfection by decreasing antigen load.
