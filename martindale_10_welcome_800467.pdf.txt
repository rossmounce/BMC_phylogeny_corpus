Welcome to open access publishing at EvoDevo: a
macroevolutionary change in sharing data
Editorial

Mark Q Martindale*1 and Maximilian J Telford2

Patterns of speciation and extinction throughout the history of our planet are a testament to the complex changes
in embryogenesis that have created the immense biological diversity that surrounds us.
The diversity of multicellular organisms arises through
complicated and highly coordinated processes of
embryogenesis that continue to be one of the most fascinating and least understood areas of biology. In contrast
to other scientific disciplines, there are few theories of
development that predict how complex, functional larval
or adult organisms, composed of distinct and specialized
cell types, arise from a single cell. The primary guiding
principle in the field of developmental biology is the
notion of 'differential gene expression' enunciated some
40 years ago [1] - a simple concept that explains the
appearance of cells with many different phenotypes yet
sharing a single genotype. Although our understanding of
the control of gene expression has made huge advances,
we still lack a predictive "logic" to understand the connection between genotype and phenotype. This is due, in
part, to the need for consideration of the evolutionary
context within which each organism has arisen.
We are in the midst of a renaissance of the rigorous
study of the developmental basis of biological diversity.
The field of evo-devo is gaining pace, energised by opportunities such as the freedom to go beyond the handful of
genetic model systems at the cellular and molecular levels. This expansion is being fuelled by the reduced cost of
nucleic acid sequencing, high throughput screening
approaches, and opportunities for live cell imaging now
applicable to many species of interest. Many of the recent
major advances in understanding gene expression that
have profound evolutionary implications (e.g. imprinting,
RNAi, buffering of genetic variability) have been discovered through studies of embryonic material.
The study of development not only provides insight
into the tortuous past of any one species, it illuminates

the modifications in development that have given rise to
existing forms. These new technologies coincide with our
increasingly mature understanding of phylogenetic relationships amongst extant organisms. Interpreting developmental phenomena in this rigorous phylogenetic
context is the most direct approach to gaining understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of the evolution of diversity and provides necessary information
regarding the direction of evolutionary change.
All these factors have resulted in the much needed
expansion of the number of new 'model' systems available
for study - the new sources of data require a new and
modern online venue for the communication of valuable
results. The fields of developmental and evolutionary
biology are inherently comparative and require the careful documentation of features of embryos that vary both
across time and space and can benefit enormously from
modern imaging and comparative techniques for examining increasingly large and complex data sets.
A common request from traditional print journals is for
a reduction in size, colour content, or number of display
figures in a manuscript or for an increased financial contribution that is unjustifiable under shrinking lab
research budgets. Constraints on the ability to share high
quality data are particularly limiting in these days when
new model systems are being introduced to the community: often, crucial descriptive background information
and detailed documentation of complex phenomena is
needed to educate an eager new audience and to lay the
foundation for future studies.
Clearly, web-based publications are in a position to take
maximum advantage of modern technologies such as
multichannel imaging, animations, time-lapse movies,
and rapid access to online databases. The internet is an
ideal and powerful method to access information and is
available virtually everywhere in our wireless world. And
that is the point: to share solid, interesting, high quality
data with as many people as possible.
Open access publishing promotes rapid dissemination
of information to the greatest number of individuals pos-

sible [2]. Authors of EvoDevo manuscripts retain copyright to their own work so they can reproduce figures and
provide PDF copies of their papers on personal websites.
There are no page limits or colour plate fees that artificially constrain manuscript preparation, allowing authors
to provide as much information as needed to explain
their results to their peers. There is a one-time articleprocessing charge paid at the time of publication that
ensures that papers are permanently archived in multiple
locations such as PubMed Central and the US National
Library of Medicine, as well as in Germany, France and eDepot [3,4]. Open access publication is now a requirement for many public funded research agencies (such as
the NIH). Furthermore, online publishing at BioMed
Central allows authors to rapidly track the impact of their
own publications, providing metrics (number of times
viewed, download statistics, etc.) for professional evaluation and advancement.
As we struggle with unscientific faith-based approaches
to understanding our world, not only is evolutionary biology a cornerstone of modern biology, but also of science
and intellectualism around the world. The study of development in an evolutionary and phylogenetic context, and
the appreciation of the role of the developmental period
in evolutionary theory, is therefore a fundamental and
fascinating field of study. It is an exciting time to be
involved in the field of evo-devo as the logical intersection of these basic questions with mountains of new data
generated by technical advancements in the field. We
invite and encourage you and your colleagues to join our
outstanding group of international editors [5] in contributing to this excitement by open access publishing in
EvoDevo.
