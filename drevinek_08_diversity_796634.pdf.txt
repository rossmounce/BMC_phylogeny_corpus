Abstract
Background: Burkholderia cenocepacia is the most prominent species of the B. cepacia complex
(Bcc), a group of nine closely related and difficult to identify bacteria that cause serious infections
in patients with cystic fibrosis. Despite its clinical relevance, identification of B. cenocepacia as a
single species is unavailable, as it splits by a widely used recA gene-based PCR identification method
into discrete phylogenetic subgroups IIIA, IIIB, IIIC and IIID. With the aim of identifying gene targets
suitable for unified detection of B. cenocepacia strains, we examined sequence polymorphisms in the
repA and parB genes. These essential genes are involved in the replication and partitioning of
bacterial replicons, hence we also had the opportunity for the first time to investigate the evolution
of the multireplicon (three chromosome) structure of Bcc genomes.
Results: Alignment of the repA and parB genes from publicly available Bcc genome sequences
enabled the design of primers for their amplification and sequence analysis. Multilocus sequencing
typing, a highly discriminatory method for Bcc species and strain discrimination, was used to select
strains of unique sequence types (STs) that spanned the known Bcc genetic diversity. Sequence
datasets of repA (83 isolates, 67 STs) and parB (120 isolates, 95 STs) genes from the second
chromosome were aligned and examined phylogenetically to identify polymorphisms suitable for
identification of B. cenocepacia. In contrast to parB, the Bcc repA sequences demonstrated distinct
clustering of B. cenocepacia from other species, which enabled the design a species-specific
multiplex PCR. The novel single-reaction B. cenocepacia detection method was tested on a panel of
142 different Bcc strains (142 STs) and distinguished recA groups IIIA, IIIB and IIID, from all other
Bcc members with 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity.
Conclusion: The repA-based multiplex PCR is a useful aid to the rapid identification of the most
clinically relevant B. cenocepacia recA subgroups IIIA, IIIB and IIID. Phylogenetic analysis of repA and
parB genes demonstrated that acquisition of the second and third replicons of Bcc genomes
occurred prior to their differentiation into discrete species and that the sharing of replicons across
species had not occurred.

Background
Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are threatened over their
lifetime with multiple respiratory infections contributing
significantly to their morbidity and mortality [1]. One of
the most problematic infectious agents are the microorganisms belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex
(Bcc), a group of nine closely related bacterial species initially designated as genomovars prior to their formal naming [2]. Current species within the Bcc are: B. cepacia
(genomovar I; [3]), B. multivorans (genomovar II; [3]), B.
cenocepacia (genomovar III; [4]), B. stabilis (genomovar IV;
[5]), B. vietnamiensis (genomovar V; [3]), B. dolosa
(genomovar VI; [6]), B. ambifaria (genomovar VII; [7]), B.
anthina (genomovar VIII; [8]) and B. pyrrocinia (genomovar IX; [8]). Although all Bcc species can be isolated from
CF respiratory samples [2], two of them, B. cenocepacia
and B. multivorans, are by far the most predominant,
cumulatively accounting for approximately 85 – 98% of
all Bcc infections in CF [9-12].
Within B. cenocepacia, phylogenetic analysis of the recA
gene sequence [13] subdivides this species into four distinct clusters, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC and IIID [4]. A fifth B. cenocepacia subgroup, IIIE, has been described in multilocus
sequence typing studies of the Bcc [14-16], however, the
clustering of IIIE isolates in all these studies has been very
distinct from B. cenocepacia subgroups IIIA to IIID. The
classification of these isolates as B. cenocepacia IIIE is now
recognised to have been a mis-assignment (P. Vandamme,
personal communication) and they will be referred as Bcc
Group E until their taxonomic position is formally
resolved. Epidemiological surveillance of B. cenocepacia
CF infection has revealed the vast majority of cases to be
caused by subgroups IIIA [11,17,18] and IIIB [10,12].
Clinical strains of IIID origin were originally reported
from a single CF centre [19] and to date no clinical IIIC
strains have been described [20]. In addition to nine
established Bcc species, other Bcc-related groups with unidentified genomovar status have been described such as
Bcc Group K [16,21] and Bcc groups 1 to 6 [14,15]; the
phenotypic similarity of these novel groups with B. cenocepacia provides the potential for misidentification.
The need for accurate identification of Bcc has led to the
development of several PCR-based methods [13,22,23],
aimed at preventing the alarming rate of Bcc misidentification based upon the use of standard phenotypic tests
[24]. The house-keeping gene recA whose polymorphisms
allowed the discrimination of all the Bcc species [13] has
been found to be particularly convenient for the Bcc identification purposes [2]. However, when the PCR targeting
the recA is applied to detection of B. cenocepacia, it lacks
the option to detect all isolates within this species in a single reaction. Separate PCR primers have to be employed
for each existing recA variant from the B. cenocepacia IIIA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/44

and IIIB phylogenetic subgroups [13,21,25]; no PCR
primers have been developed for IIIC or IIID strains. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of seven housekeeping genes (including recA) [14] has now largely
superseded recA gene analysis in terms of being a gold
standard test for discriminatory species or novel group
identification within the Bcc. MLST also has the great
advantage of being capable of globally tracking and discriminating strains [16,26]. However, despite the fact that
DNA sequence analysis is becoming more cost effective
and accessible, the requirement for PCR and sequencing
of seven genes is often beyond the means of standard
diagnostic laboratories.
In this study we developed a PCR for simultaneous detection of all clinically relevant B. cenocepacia recA groups –
IIIA, IIIB and IIID [4]. We analyzed nucleotide polymorphisms of two additional essential genes, parB and repA,
from the second chromosomal replicon of Bcc bacteria
which are involved in the partitioning and replication,
respectively, of their multipartite genomes [27]. Alignment of parB and repA genes from six sequenced Bcc
genomes enabled the design of universal PCR primers
capable of amplification of each respective gene from all
Bcc bacteria. These PCRs were then used to generate Bcc
sequence datasets for each gene. After subsequent detection and comparison of discriminatory nucleotide polymorphisms, the final design of a B. cenocepacia speciesspecific repA PCR was carried out. The availability of a collection of parB and repA sequences also allowed us to evaluate for the first time the genetic and evolutionary
conservation of the second chromosome that is carried by
all members of the Bcc [2,27]. The design of parB/repA
PCRs, diagnostic evaluation of the performance of a B.
cenocepacia-specific repA against a gold-standard set of isolates identified by MLST [14], and the evolutionary specificity of the second chromosome to each discrete Bcc
species are described.

Results
Analysis of repA and parB genes encoded in Bcc genomes
Six Bcc genomes that spanned B. cenocepacia, B. vietnamiensis, B. ambifaria and Bcc Group K were examined for the
presence of repA and parB genes. Due to the multireplicon
structure of Bcc genomes that are known to comprise at
least 3 chromosomal replicons and may have one or more
associated plasmids [2,27], homologs of both genes were
present in multiple copies. For all Bcc genomes examined,
all replicons possessed their own sequence-specific copy
of parB, and every replicon except the largest (chromosome 1), harboured a sequence-specific copy of repA. Phylogenetic analysis of the repA and parB sequences retrieved
from the second and third chromosomal replicons was
performed (Figure 1). Alleles for both genes clustered primarily by the replicon they were encoded on. Within these

on the second chromosome (Table 1); these primers were
applied to collection of strains representative of the
genetic diversity within the Bcc identified by MLST
[14,15,26]. Sequence analysis of an internal 623 bp portion of 898 bp repA product was performed using two further primers, while the shorter, 656 bp long parB
amplicon was sequenced completely using the universal
primers for this gene (Table 1).

Sequence analysis of the Bcc repA gene
The relationship and sequence similarities among repA
alleles originating from different Bcc species was investigated for 67 Bcc ST types. Phylogenetic analyses of repA
(Figure 2, panel A; raw sequences are provided in Additional file 1: Sequences repA) revealed that B. cenocepacia
recA groups IIIA and IIIB clustered in close proximity to
each other, indicating they might share unique sequence
polymorphisms not present in other Bcc species/groups.
The variation in repA alleles from B. cenocepacia IIIB was
considerably greater than that seen in IIIA strains which
were virtually identical for the 11 STs examined. B. cenocepacia IIIC and IIID, along with two Bcc5 strains of distinct
ST clustered adjacent to IIIA and IIIB; a third Bcc5 ST
formed the next most closely related arm of the tree (Figure 2, panel A). These five groups split weakly from all
other Bcc species examined on the basis of the repA phylogeny.

replicon-specific clusters, each species was resolved as a
discrete phylogenetic arm, with the three B. cenocepacia
derived sequences clustering more closely than the Bcc
Group K, B. vietnamiensis or B. ambifaria sequences. The
repA and parB sequences on the respective plasmids
within B. cenocepacia J2315 and HI2424 were also
resolved and not as closely related as the chromosomally
encoded genes.
The repA and parB genes present on chromosome 2 were
selected for evaluation as targets to which both universal
and B. cenocepacia specific PCRs could be designed. Using
the alignment of full length Bcc genes, universal primers
were designed to amplify 66% of the 1,368 bp repA coding

The sequence length obtained from a subgroup of 73 isolates representing 60 ST types was suitable for MLST-like
analysis. In an analogous fashion to the allele numbering
system used in MLST [14], a unique number was assigned
to every repA sequence variant and resulted in identification of 35 new repA alleles (submitted to Genbank as
accession numbers EU165089 to EU165123). None of
the repA alleles was able to further distinguish a single ST
type and all isolates of the same ST always carried the
same repA allele. Moreover, the same repA allele numbers
were found shared by multiple STs within the same species. These data indicated the repA gene was more conserved than the gltB, gyrB, lepA and trpB genes used in
conventional MLST of the Bcc.
Phylogenetic analysis of parB gene
The parB gene polymorphisms were examined in 95 different STs, including same isolates used for repA analysis
above. The constructed phylogenetic tree for parB (Figure
2, panel B; raw sequences are provided in Additional file
2: Sequences parB) demonstrated considerably weaker
relatedness between B. cenocepacia IIIA and IIIB compared
to the repA tree. IIIA and IIIB were not found next to each
other and in addition, IIIB isolates were split into three
separate parB clusters. B. cepacia, Bcc Group K, Bcc Group
E, Bcc4, Bcc5 and Bcc6, were clustered between IIIA and

the three IIIB subgroups. This pronounced phylogenetic
diversity showed that there was substantial sequence heterogeneity within the parB gene. Application of the MLSTlike allele designation system to the parB gene of 114 isolates (89 STs) resulted in the identification of 67 different
alleles (submitted to Genbank as accession numbers
EU165124 to EU165190). Similarly to the repA results,
identical alleles were found present in more than one ST
and the isolates of the same ST never differed by their parB
allele. However, only one of the 7 MLST loci, gyrB,
exceeded the number of different alleles found in parB.
Design of PCR for B. cenocepacia IIIA, IIIB and IIID
One of the aims of this study was to develop a single species-specific PCR for B. cenocepacia, primarily aimed at
unifying the identification of the most clinically significant groups IIIA and IIIB that exist within this species.
After obtaining the repA and parB sequence datasets which
spanned the current diversity within the Bcc, both genes
were evaluated for their potential as PCR targets. However, the high degree of parB sequence heterogeneity
within the IIIB group excluded this gene from being evaluated further as a suitable target.

In this respect, the repA proved to be less troublesome and
allowed the design of B. cenocepacia-specific primers.
However, even within repA, two sites with species-specific
nucleotide polymorphisms had to be selected to avoid
false positivity deriving from non-IIIA non-IIIB isolates.
The first species-specific polymorphism site selected was
targeted by primer repA-237-3 (Table 1); this primer had
priming base mis-matches in the repA sequences of B.
cepacia, B. multivorans, B. cenocepacia recA group IIIC, B.
stabilis, B. vietnamiensis, B. dolosa, B. ambifaria, B. anthina,
B. pyrrocinia, Bcc Group K, Bcc Group E and Bcc4. Primer
repA-237-3 in combination with the sequencing forward
primer repA-SEQ-5 was predicted to produce a 237 bp
product with IIIA, IIIB, and Bcc5 while the mis-matched
species described above were predicted to be negative. The
second site selected for the multiplex PCR was targeted by

primer repA-636-3 (Table 1) and containing priming
basis mis-matches present in the repA sequences of B. multivorans, B. cenocepacia IIIC and Bcc5; in combination with
repA-SEQ-5, primer repA-636-3 was therefore predicted to
produce a 636 bp product from all Bcc species except the
latter three.
As a combined multiplex PCR, with repA-SEQ-5 as the
forward primer and a mixture of repA-237-3/repA-636-3
as the reverse primers, the predicted identification algorithm from the in silico analysis was as follows: B. cenocepacia IIIA and IIIB isolates would produce both 636 and
237 bp PCR products; B. cenocepacia IIIC and B. multivorans would be negative for both; Bcc5 would produce only
the 237 bp product, while all the remaining Bcc species
and novel groups would produce only the 636 bp amplicon. At this stage, we could not predict outcomes for Bcc6
(due to a lack of sequence information) and B. cenocepacia
IIID (the repA sequence obtained was sufficient for phylogenetic analysis but did not span the target regions
selected). However, since we were mainly focused on the
specific detection of B. cenocepacia IIIA and IIIB as predominant CF pathogens, the multiplex PCR was tested on
a group of 83 isolates spanning the diversity of the Bcc
(Figure 3). As predicted, B. cenocepacia recA groups IIIA
and IIIB were characterized with two positive bands, and
in addition subgroup IIID was also positive for both of
these. B. cenocepacia IIIC and B. multivorans were negative
for both PCR products and Bcc5 produced the 237 bp
product alone. All the remaining Bcc members were positive for just the 636 bp amplicon (Figure 3).
Specificity and sensitivity of B. cenocepacia PCR
The initial success of the multiplex prompted a complete
screen of a broad range of different STs representing all
Bcc species and most of recently described Bcc groups
which was used to determine specificity and sensitivity of
the multiplex PCR. The hypothesis tested was that the
novel repA PCR was capable of discriminating B. cenocepacia IIIA, IIIB and IIID from all other Bcc species and novel

groups (Table 2). For B. cenocepacia IIIA, IIIB and IIID, all
44 isolates (39 STs) gave the expected double-positive
PCR result. All 3 B. cenocepacia IIIC isolates (3 STs) were
negative. Outside of B. cenocepacia, 69 isolates (53 STs)
from formally named species within the current B. cepacia
complex produced results that correlated to their species
designation (Figure 3). The only exceptions were 3 isolates representing 1 ST from B. vietnamiensis, B. ambifaria
and B. pyrrocinia, respectively, that were negative for both
multiplex products (Table 2). Expansion of the test strain
collection to novel Bcc groups with no formal species
names demonstrated the presence of B. cenocepacia III-AB-D-like double positives only among 7 STs in group
Bcc6. Three STs within the 12 Bcc5 isolates tested produced single 237 bp amplicons as expected, however, the
remaining 6 STs were negative for both amplicons. The
other novel groups screened all produced the expected
multiplex PCR result.
In total, 135 out of 142 STs were assigned correctly into
one of the two categories: (i) being B. cenocepacia IIIA, IIIB
or IIID (39 out of 39 STs), and (ii) being other Bcc species
or groups (96 out of 103 STs). This represented 100% test
sensitivity (39/39) and overall 93.2% specificity (96/
103). The species-specific character of the assay was also
further tested by examining amplification from closely
related non-Burkholderia species and bacteria commonly
encountered in CF sputum (see methods); all these microorganisms did not cross-react with novel multiplex PCR
and designed primers. The detection threshold of the PCR
which comprised just 20 cycles was found to be 107 B. cenocepacia CFU/mL; addition of 5 further PCR cycles
reduced the minimal amount of bacteria needed for successful amplification to 106 CFU/mL.

Discussion
Correct identification of bacteria belonging to the B. cepacia complex still remains dependent on the use of molecular methods. The non-ribosomal house-keeping gene
recA has become one of the mainstays of Bcc identification, since its sequence polymorphisms allow both detection of the whole complex and also species level
identification [13,21]. However, one of the major drawbacks of using the recA gene was the fact that B. cenocepacia
is split into four recA phylogenetic variants [4]. As a consequence, B. cenocepacia lacks a one-step identification
test, even though this particular species represents the
most frequent Bcc pathogen in persons with CF [2,1012,17]. A single test for unified identification of B. cenocepacia isolates, especially the clinically dominant subgroups IIIA and IIIB [10-12], would be a great asset to the
rapid diagnosis of infection caused with these virulent CF
pathogens. In this study we examined the nucleotide polymorphisms present in the essential house-keeping genes
repA and parB, which are involved in the control of repli-

cation and partitioning, respectively, of the multiple chromosomal replicons present in Bcc genomes [27].
Of these two genes, repA was the most suitable for the
design of the identification method. The successful repA
multiplex PCR developed was capable of identifying B.
cenocepacia strains IIIA, IIIB and IIID; also its testing represents the first time a single identification test had been
compared to a reference collection of Bcc strains identified
and typed by MLST. The repA multiplex PCR method was
primarily designed to detect the two main B. cenocepacia
recA groups IIIA and IIIB, however, its efficacy for the
identification of B. cenocepacia IIID should prove clinically useful. As opposed to B. cenocepacia IIIC which is
entirely comprised of the environmental isolates which
are specialist plant endophytes [20], recA groups IIIA, IIIB
and IIID all include clinical isolates of B. cenocepacia [1012,19,28] and therefore are the most likely to be encountered in clinical microbiology practice.
The PCR method was tested on 142 different ST types. Its
sensitivity reached 100% within the target groups of B.
cenocepacia IIIA, IIIB and IIID, while specificity was found
at 93% due to several strains from the Bcc6 producing the
same PCR result as B. cenocepacia. Eight different Bcc
groups of unassigned species status (Bcc Groups K, E, Bcc2
to 6, and Bcc group 8) were included in the study making
the strain collection examined one of the most broad in
terms of Bcc diversity. While the Group K has already been
shown to potentially comprise more than one bacterial
unit analogous to the species level [16], the taxonomic
positions of other Bcc groups remain unanswered. However, a recent study describing the Bcc groups 5 and 6 for
the first time [15], showed that Bcc6 was very closely
related to B. cenocepacia recA groups IIIA and IIIB suggesting their same species origin. Our PCR was able to detect
7 out of the 18 STs examined within Bcc6 (Table 2).
Although this detection rate was below 50% it may prove
useful in the future if Bcc6 is assigned to B. cenocepacia. In
contrast we were able to eliminate the positivity of Bcc5
during the design of the repA-based PCR. Although Bcc5
has been proposed to be closely related to B. cenocepacia
(like Bcc6, [15]), with repA analysis two Bcc5 isolates clustered most closely to B. cenocepacia IIIC and IIID, and a
third isolate formed a distinct arm (Figure 2, panel A).
Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated sequences from
seven MLST loci also show even closer links to B. stabilis
and B. pyrrocinia rather than B. cenocepacia IIIA or IIIB [15]
suggesting that resolution of the taxonomic status of Bcc5
will require further analysis.
The detection limit experiment demonstrated that the
repA PCR was able to detect approximately 106 CFU/ml B.
cenocepacia from a pure culture after 25 cycles of PCR. A
similar detection limit has been observed with the stand-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/44

ard recA gene PCR for B. cepacia complex bacteria [22].
Once chronically infected, large numbers of B. cepacia
complex bacteria may be present in CF sputum (ranging
from 105 to 108 CFU/ml; PD and EM unpublished data).
The sensitivity of the repA PCR seen in this study indicates
that without modification, it could only be applied
directly to sputum for the most heavily infected individuals. However, our previous studies have shown that by
nesting a recA gene-based PCR as low as 103 CFU/ml of
Bcc bacteria may be directly detected from CF sputum and
identify individuals that are culture negative, but show
early evidence of being infected [25]. Since we have now
shown that repA is an accurate B. cenocepacia identification
target, the design of future nested PCRs based on this gene
may be undertaken. Overall, the repA PCR as developed
herein is most suited to application on pure Bcc cultures
and the specific identification of B. cenocepacia IIIA, IIIB
and IIID.
Sequence analysis of repA as well as of another partitioning gene parB revealed that a degree of their sequence conservation was comparable with other house-keeping
genes used for MLST. parB was more polymorphic than
repA as the number of identified alleles within it was the
second largest identified after MLST locus gyrB. Lower variation of the B. cenocepacia repA was observed in phylogenetic analysis where, unlike parB, B. cenocepacia IIIB
formed a uniform single cluster which was adjacent to B.
cenocepacia IIIA (Figure 2, panel A). Overall the repA tree
closely mirrored the phylogenetic relatedness of the Bcc
members observed by concatenated nucleotide sequences
from seven MLST loci [14]. Phylogenetic trees of parB (Figure 2, panel B) or recA [13] do not clearly identify this
close B. cenocepacia IIIA-IIIB relatedness.
Our analysis has also enabled us to speculate on the evolution of the multireplicon B. cepacia complex genome.
An intriguing question of Bcc genomic biology is: has
chromosomal replicon movement occurred between species? While considerable genomic plasticity mediated by
insertion sequences and the capacity of strains to survive
deletion of over 800 kb of DNA from secondary replicons
has been shown for Bcc bacteria [29], we do not know if
they are capable of swapping replicons between species.
Examination of the full length repA and parB genes from
complete Bcc genomes demonstrated clustering by chromosomal replicon, while each species possessed genetically distinct replication regions within these major
clusters (Figure 1). This suggests that the second and third
chromosomes present in Bcc each have a distinct common ancestor that was present in the Bcc progenitor prior
to its divergence into the closely related species that currently make up the complex. Although we found evidence
of different strains of a species (eg. multiple STs) sharing
a given repA or parB allele, we did not find any that were

Page 7 of 10

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:44

shared by different Bcc species. These data suggest that the
second chromosomal replicon has not moved between
Bcc species and was evolutionary stabilised a long time
ago such that it diverged in concert with their emergence
as new species. It also indicates that the partitioning and
replication regions of Bcc bacteria are highly stable and
essential, such that inter-species recombination which has
been observed for several Bcc MLST loci [30] does not
occur in these regions.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed easy-to-use single PCR
method that is capable of unifying the detection of all B.
cenocepacia strains except for recA subgroup IIIC. The repA
gene targeted by this assay possesses sequence polymorphisms that enable Bcc species clustering which closely
mirrors that provided by MLST and making repA a stable
and discriminatory gene for the development of diagnostics of Bcc infection. We have also shown the second and
third chromosomal replicons possessed by these bacteria
have evolved stably with each respective Bcc species and
that replicon movement has not occurred after their speciation.

Methods
Bacterial strains
Bcc isolates used in this study were derived from the Cardiff University collection and were subjected to growth,
DNA extraction and basic identification as previously
described [13]. In addition, the collection comprised
highly divergent isolates representing all nine formally
described Bcc species as well as novel Bcc groups identified by MLST: Bcc Group K [16,21], Bcc groups 2 – 6
[14,15] and Bcc group 8 (A. Baldwin, unpublished data).
In total, 215 isolates were examined at the repA locus; 83
isolates (corresponding to 67 MLST sequence type; STs)
were subjected to repA sequence analysis; for testing the
repA-based PCR this was expanded to 170 isolates (142
STs) including 38 of those that were sequenced. 120 isolates (95 STs) from the same collection were sequenced
for parB analysis.

Ten non-Bcc bacteria reference isolates representative of
closely related species or those that are frequently encountered in CF respiratory samples were used as controls for
the molecular diagnostics: Achromobacter xylosoxidans
LMG 1863T, Burkholderia gladioli LMG 2216T, Delftia acidovorans LMG 1226T, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Pseudomonas fluorescens LMG 1794T, Pseudomonas putida LMG
2257T, Pseudomonas stutzeri LMG 11199T, Ralstonia pickettii
LMG 5942T, Ralstonia mannitolytica LMG 6866T and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia LMG 958T; LMG strains were
obtained from Belgium Coordinated Collections of
Microorganisms [31].

Amplification and sequence analysis of repA and parB
The repA and parB sequences [27] from the second and
third chromosomes, and plasmid of B. cenocepacia strain
J2315 were downloaded from the genome sequence of
this strain produced by the Pathogen Sequencing Group
at the Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge [32]. The
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; [33]) was then
used to identify homologous genes in the genomes of five
additional Bcc strains produced by the US Department of
Energy Joint Genome Institute [34]: B. cenocepacia IIIB
strains AU1054 and HI2424, Bcc Group K strain 383, B.
vietnamiensis G4 and B. ambifaria AMMD. Annotated repA
and parB genes from the published genomes of Burkholderia pseudomallei [35], Burkholderia mallei [36] and Burkholderia xenovorans [37] were included in selected analyses as
reference sequences. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
of DNA sequences was performed using the BioEdit [38]
and Mega 3.1 [39] softwares as described previously [40].
Phylogenetic trees were primarily drawn using Neighborjoining method (Jukes-Cantor algorithm) and bootstrap
analysis evaluated for 500 replicates. Three additional
treeing algorithms were evaluated (UPGMA, Minimum
Evolution and Maximum Parsimony) and produced phylogenetic trees that were concordant with final Neighborjoining methods presented in the study. In addition to the
DNA-based analysis, translated amino acid sequences
were also used for the tree reconstruction, however no discrepancy with the nucleotide-based trees was found.

Universal Bcc primers for amplification of the repA gene
encoded on the second chromosome were designed from
the alignments (primers repA-UNI-5 and repA-UNI-3;
Table 1). The universal primers were used to amplify the
898 bp region of the Bcc repA gene from 83 isolates representing 67 divergent STs. PCR was performed in a 20-µl
reaction mixture containing 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of
each dNTPs, 0.8 U of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison,
USA), 0.5 µM of each primers (Table 1) and 1 µl of template DNA (approximately 500 ng). The PCR was performed on a Dyad DNA Engine thermal cycler (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The thermal
cycling profile was repeated 35 times and consisted of 30
sec at 94°C, 45 sec at 55°C and 1 min at 72°C. The amplified repA-gene products were sequenced in both directions
using internal sequencing primers (repA-SEQ-5 and repASEQ-3; Table 1) exactly as described [14]. The maximal
available accurate repA sequence read was used for species-specific primer design (see below), however for phylogenetic analysis a subset of 73 sequences were trimmed
to a single overlapping region of 345 bp.
In an analogous fashion to the repA gene analysis
described above, universal primers were designed to
amplify the parB gene encoded on the Bcc second chromosome (parB-UNI-5 and parB-UNI-3; Table 1). A 656 bp

parB amplification product was produced using PCR conditions identical to those for repA. Sequence analysis of
120 isolates (95 STs) was performed on both strands
using the universal parB primers (Table 1) as described.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on a subset of 114
sequences trimmed to an overlapping internal region of
494 bp.
B. cenocepacia species-specific PCR targeting repA gene
A multiplex PCR producing two repA gene fragments of
636 and 237 bp in length was designed to distinguish B.
cenocepacia from all other Bcc members. The multiplex
PCR used the repA sequencing 5' primer (repA-SEQ-5;
Table 1) and two different 3' primers (repA-636-3 and
repA-237-3, Table 1). PCR was carried out in a 20-µl reaction volume containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM (each)
dNTPs, 0.75 U of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison,
USA), 0.72 µM 5' primer, 0.5 µM 3' primer repA-636-3,
0.22 µM 3' primer repA-237-3 and 0.5 µl of template DNA
(approximately 250 ng). The PCR program was run on a
Dyad DNA Engine thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hemel Hempstead, UK) with initial denaturation 5 min at
94°C and a subsequent run of 20 cycles, each comprising
30 sec at 94°C, 15 sec at annealing temperature and 15 sec
at 72°C. The initial annealing temperature set at 70°C
was decreasing for the first 10 cycles by 0.2°C/cycle to
reach the final annealing temperature of 68°C. The PCR
specificity and sensitivity was evaluated by testing 170 Bcc
isolates falling into 142 different STs (Table 2); in addition the 10 non-Bcc species commonly found in sputum
were also tested (see above).

The detection limit of the assay was determined by serial
decimal dilutions of DNA extracted from a B. cenocepacia
culture of known viability characterized in CFU/mL. The
reference strain B. cenocepacia J2315 was grown in Luria
Bertani broth to an optical density (630 nm) of 0.5 units,
corresponding to a viability of approximately 5 × 108
CFU/ml. Serial dilutions of this culture were plated as 10
µl drop counts onto Tryptic Soya Agar and incubated overnight at 37°C to precisely determine the number of viable
cells present. In parallel, 200 µl of each dilution were
mixed with 100 µl of 5% Chelex 100 and a rapid DNA
extraction performed exactly as described [40]; 1 µl of this
DNA extraction was then subjected to either 20 or 25
cycles of PCR as described above. Once viable counts were
available, all the dilutions performed in making the DNA
extraction and setting up the PCR were taken into account
to calculate the number of viable cells present in the detection limit experiment.
