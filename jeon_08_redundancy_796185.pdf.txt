Abstract
Background: Drosophila has six receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), five of which are
expressed primarily in neurons. Mutations in all five affect axon guidance, either alone or in
combination. Highly penetrant central nervous system (CNS) and motor axon guidance alterations
are usually observed only when specific combinations of two or more RPTPs are removed. Here,
we examine the sixth RPTP, Ptp4E, which is broadly expressed.
Results: Ptp4E and Ptp10D are closely related type III RPTPs. Non-drosophilid insect species have
only one type III RPTP, which is closest to Ptp10D. We found that Ptp4E mutants are viable and
fertile. We then examined Ptp4E Ptp10D double mutants. These die before the larval stage, and
have a mild CNS phenotype in which the outer longitudinal 1D4 bundle is frayed. Ptp10D Ptp69D
double mutants have a strong CNS phenotype in which 1D4 axons abnormally cross the midline
and the outer and middle longitudinal bundles are fused to the inner bundle. To examine if Ptp4E
also exhibits synthetic phenotypes in combination with Ptp69D, we made Ptp4E Ptp69D double
mutants and Ptp4E Ptp10D Ptp69D triple mutants. No phenotype was observed in the double
mutant. The triple mutant phenotype differs from the Ptp10D Ptp69D phenotype in two ways. First,
the longitudinal tracts appear more normal than in the double mutant; two or three bundles are
observed, although they are disorganized and fused. Second, axons labelled by the SemaIIB-Myc
marker often cross in the wrong commissure. We also examined motor axon guidance, and found
that no phenotypes are observed in any Ptp4E double mutant combination. However, triple
mutants in which Ptp4E Ptp10D was combined with Ptp69D or Ptp52F exhibited stronger
phenotypes than the corresponding Ptp10D double mutants.
Conclusion: Type III RPTPs are required for viability in Drosophila, since Ptp4E Ptp10D double
mutants die before the larval stage. Unlike Ptp10D, Ptp4E appears to be a relatively minor player
in the control of axon guidance. Strong phenotypes are only observed in triple mutants in which
both type III RPTPs are eliminated together with Ptp69D or Ptp52F. Our results allow us to
construct a complete genetic interaction matrix for all six of the RPTPs.

Background
Signalling via tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for
axon guidance in many systems. Target proteins involved
in signal transduction and cytoskeletal dynamics in
growth cones are phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases
(TKs) and dephosphorylated by tyrosine phosphatases
(PTPs).
In a simplified view of phosphotyrosine pathways controlling cell growth and differentiation, signaling is triggered by engagement of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
by ligands. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization
and phosphorylation of downstream targets. RTK signalling is downregulated by dephosphorylation of autophosphorylated RTKs and other signalling molecules by
cytoplasmic PTPs. In this scenario, the PTPs are passive
modulators of a process in which the 'informational'
event that initiates signalling is ligand binding to the RTK.
In contrast, phosphotyrosine signalling pathways
involved in growth cone guidance in the Drosophila
embryonic central nervous system (CNS) involve receptor
tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) and cytoplasmic TKs. Like
RTKs, RPTPs are modular signalling receptors. They have
cell adhesion molecule-like extracellular (XC) domains,
linked via a single transmembrane region to one or two
cytoplasmic PTP domains. Five of the six fly Rptp genes are
selectively expressed in CNS neurons, and all of these
genes have loss-of-function phenotypes that affect axon
guidance [1-6].
The TK that is central to many growth cone guidance
events in the Drosophila embryo is Abl, a cytoplasmic
kinase [7-9]. Drosophila has many RTKs, but no functional
RTK has been implicated in embryonic axon guidance
(the kinase-related axon guidance receptors Derailed and
Off-track are thought to lack enzymatic activity) [10,11].
These facts suggest that phosphotyrosine signalling in
growth cones could be controlled in a manner opposite to
that used in RTK pathways. In this scheme, the growth
cone would use a cytoplasmic TK to constitutively phosphorylate targets, and the 'information' that alters signalling strength would be transmitted via engagement of
RPTPs by ligands located on the surfaces over which the
growth cone travels.
Of course, this is a greatly oversimplified picture, because
there are many other receptors that can influence phosphotyrosine signalling in embryonic growth cones. For
example, the Roundabout 1 (Robo1) receptor is an essential regulator of axon guidance across the midline. Phosphorylation of Robo1 by Abl may be regulated by Robo1's
engagement of its ligand Slit, and in this case the 'information' that triggers signalling would be delivered via Slit
binding to Robo1 [9]. Also, it is unlikely that phosphor-

http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/3/1/3

ylation by Abl is an unregulated, constitutive process.
Nevertheless, it is striking that the receptors are kinases
and the cytoplasmic modulators are phosphatases in
pathways that regulate cell growth, while the reverse
seems to be true for pathways that control neuronal
growth cone guidance.
RPTP pathways are poorly understood relative to RTK pathways, partially because in vivo ligands that regulate axon
guidance and synaptogenesis have been identified only for
the Drosophila Lar RPTP. These are the heparan sulfate proteoglycans Syndecan and Dallylike [12,13]. However, Lar
also has non-heparan sulfate proteoglycan ligands [14,15],
and ligands for the other five fly RPTPs have not yet been
defined. It has also been difficult to identify substrates that
are important for RPTP signalling in vivo.
Five Drosophila RPTPs have been genetically characterized
in published papers. Four of these (Ptp10D, Lar, Ptp69D,
Ptp99A) are expressed only on CNS axons in late embryos
[16-18], and the fifth, Ptp52F, is CNS-specific but is
expressed on both axons and cell bodies [5]. All of the
published zygotic phenotypes for these genes are alterations in axon guidance, suggesting that this is the major
function of this gene family in Drosophila. In contrast,
many mammalian RPTPs are expressed in non-neural tissues and have functions unrelated to axon guidance.
The RPTPs regulate both CNS and motor axon guidance.
There is extensive redundancy among the five genes, so
that highly penetrant guidance phenotypes are usually
observed only when two or more RPTPs are genetically
removed. Studies of motor axon guidance indicate that
each guidance decision made by motoneuron growth
cones requires a specific subset of the RPTPs. For example,
axons in the ISNb nerve are unable to defasciculate from
the common ISN pathway in Lar Ptp69D Ptp99A triple
mutants. The later decision by ISNb axons to enter their
target muscle field fails in Lar single mutants, so that the
axons bypass the muscle field, but the bypass phenotype
is suppressed and muscle field entry restored in Lar
Ptp99A double mutants [19]. This example illustrates that
RPTPs can exhibit either functional redundancy, in which
the absence of one RPTP is compensated for by another
RPTP, or competition, in which removal of a second RPTP
suppresses the guidance errors caused by the absence of
the first RPTP. Similar genetic interactions among RPTPs
may also occur in vertebrates, as two recent papers show
that double mutant combinations and RNA interference
perturbations involving the vertebrate Lar and type III
(Ptp10D-like) RPTP subfamilies produce complex alterations in motor axon guidance [20,21].
In this paper, we examine the functions of the sixth and
last Drosophila RPTP, Ptp4E. This protein is closely related

to Ptp10D, and is the product of a recent gene duplication. Unlike the other RPTPs, Ptp4E is widely expressed in
late embryos. When we began these studies, we thought
that Ptp4E mutations might have phenotypes affecting
many non-neural tissues, since loss of Ptp4E could not be
compensated for by neural-specific RPTPs. However, our
findings show that Ptp4E single mutants have no detectable phenotypes, because Ptp4E is redundant with the
closely related Ptp10D. Double mutant embryos lacking
both of these RPTPs die at hatching, but they have specific
phenotypes affecting only CNS axons and tracheal cells.
Here we describe the axon guidance phenotypes produced
by Ptp4E mutant combinations. The tracheal phenotypes
will be described elsewhere (MJ and KZ, manuscript in
preparation). The data in this paper, together with those
in earlier papers from our group [4,5,19], allow us to construct complete pairwise interaction matrices that define
how all six Drosophila RPTPs regulate CNS and motor
axon guidance.

Results and discussion
Evolution of Ptp4E
Ptp10D and Ptp4E are clearly the result of a gene duplication that occurred much more recently than the split
between the other Drosophila Rptp genes. The amino acid
sequences of their catalytic PTP domains share 89% identity, versus 36–40% identity for pairwise comparisons of
Ptp4E with other Drosophila RPTPs. Their XC domains
have a very similar organization, containing chains of 11
FN3 repeats in Ptp4E and 12 FN3 repeats in Ptp10D, and
are 58% identical in amino acid sequence (Figure 1c). The
Ptp4E gene encodes two predicted preproteins, of 1,767
and 1,607 amino acids, while the Ptp10D gene encodes
preproteins of 1,931 and 1,631 amino acids. The
sequences that differ between the alternative gene products are at the carboxyl terminus in both cases, but there is
no sequence similarity between the Ptp4E and Ptp10D
proteins within this region. Both genes reside on the X
chromosome, and the nine Ptp4E introns within conserved coding sequence all correspond exactly in position
to Ptp10D introns. Ptp10D has one additional intron not
found in Ptp4E.

The Caenorhabditis elegans gene dep-1 is the ortholog of
both Ptp10D and Ptp4E. Humans and mice have five genes
encoding type III RPTPs, defined as proteins with XC
domains composed of long chains of FN3 domains and a
single PTP domain. Among these, the product of the
PTPRB gene (PTP, not to be confused with RPTP, which
is a different protein also known as PTP) has a somewhat
higher alignment score to Ptp10D and Ptp4E than the
other four mammalian type III proteins. These are: DEP1/CD148, encoded by the Ptprj gene; PTPRO; SAP-1,
encoded by the Ptprh gene; and PTPRQ. Since the radia-

http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/3/1/3

tion into the five mammalian genes seen today occurred
after the split between arthropods and mammals, one
cannot define any of the type III mammalian genes as an
ortholog of one of the fly genes. A more complete description of the relationships among all the Drosophila, C. elegans, and mammalian RPTPs is found in [5].
The recent availability of genome sequences from twelve
different Drosophila species, three mosquito species, two
hymenopterans, a beetle, and the silkmoth allowed us to
trace the evolution of the Ptp10D/Ptp4E gene pair within
insect lineages. Surprisingly, we find that the Ptp4E gene is
found only in drosophilid species. Mosquitoes, which are
also dipterans, and all other sequenced insects have only
a single Rptp gene corresponding to this gene pair. This
gene is always much more closely related to Ptp10D than
to Ptp4E. In addition, the Ptp4E sequence exhibits more
sequence diversity among the drosophilid species than
does the Ptp10D sequence. These data indicate that
Ptp10D is the ancestral gene and that its sequence has
been constrained more by evolution than the Ptp4E
sequence since the time of the duplication. Ptp4E has
evolved much more rapidly, suggesting that it may have
acquired new function(s) since its emergence or was less
essential for fitness than Ptp10D. These relationships are
displayed in the phylogenetic tree of Figure 1d.
The Ptp10D ortholog found in all insect species always
contains the Ptp10D-specific intron, and all Ptp4E
orthologs in drosophilids lack this intron. This suggests
that the intron may have been lost at the time of the duplication from the copy that evolved into Ptp4E. This would
have been between 235 million years ago (the estimated
time at which the mosquito and fly lineages diverged from
each other) and 40 million years ago (the estimated time
at which the radiation among the 12 sequenced drosophilid species occurred) [22,23].
We attempted to trace the history of the duplication by
examining the genes adjacent to Ptp10D and Ptp4E, but
found that the organizations of the Ptp10D and Ptp4E
regions in D. melanogaster arose long after the Ptp10D and
Ptp4E genes diverged from each other. Ptp10D is flanked
by the Rst(1)JH and bifocal genes. Rst(1)JH is found
upstream of the Ptp10D ortholog in both the obscura and
melanogaster groups, but is separated from it in D. willistoni
and all other drosophilids. bifocal orthologs are adjacent
to the Ptp10D gene only in the melanogaster group. Similarly, the two genes flanking Ptp4E, SIP3 and CG4068, are
located next to the Ptp4E ortholog only within the obscura
and melanogaster groups. There are no significant sequence
similarities between the genes that flank Ptp10D and
Ptp4E. See [24] for a phylogenetic tree displaying the relationships among the sequenced insect species.

The 4E-AP construct that was used to express protein consists of a secretion signal peptide sequence (pink), 6× His residues
(blue) followed by Ptp4E XC domain and human placental alkaline phosphatase sequence. (c) Comparison of Ptp4E ad Ptp10D

Ptp4E/Ptp10D, which is more similar to Ptp10D than to Ptp4E. Ptp10D is likely to be the ancestral copy. This is visualized in the
tree by comparing the branch lengths connecting Ptp4E and Ptp10D to other insect species. D. melanogaster Ptp10D is closer
than Ptp4E to the sequences in other insects that have only one type III RPTP gene, indicating greater sequence similarity. Also,
the Ptp4E sequence evolved much faster than the Ptp10D sequence after the duplication (compare the branch lengths within
the melanogaster/ananassae/virilis cluster for the two genes). A. gambiae, mosquito; A. aegypti, mosquito; A. mellifera, honey bee.

Ptp4E expression and protein localization during embryogenesis

Ptp4E expression and protein localization during embryogenesis. (a-f) Expression of Ptp4E during development was visualized
by in situ hybridization of whole-mount embryos. In all panels, anterior is left and dorsal is up, except for (c), which shows a
ventral view. (a) At stage 8, in gastrulating embryos, Ptp4E expression is enriched in the mesoderm (labelled m). (b,c) In germ

shows a scalloped pattern that corresponds to the visceral mesoderm (vm). (d) As a positive control, we also stained embryos
where UAS-Ptp4E-GFP was driven using the engrailed-GAL4 driver. The characteristic striped engrailed pattern is observed,
indicating that the probe recognizes Ptp4E transcripts. (e) At stage 15, the strongest Ptp4E signal is in the midgut (mg); the ventral nerve cord (CNS) is also visible (arrow). (f) At stage 17, the gut is segmented and starts to coil. Ptp4E is expressed at highest levels at the anterior and posterior ends of the midgut and in the hindgut (hg). (g-o) Anti-Ptp4E antibodies recognize
ectopically expressed Ptp4E-GFP. (g,h) The UAS-Ptp4E-GFP construct was ectopically expressed using the engrailed-GAL4

expression pattern, indicating that the antibody specifically recognizes the Ptp4E protein. (i) In wild-type embryos, the antibody
shows a low and ubiquitous signal. Ptp4E-GFP protein was expressed in all postmitotic neurons using elav-GAL4 (j-o). Stage 16
embryo was visualized with anti-Ptp4E (j,m), anti-GFP (k,n), and merged (l,o). Ptp4E-GFP protein is transported out to the
axons (m-o) as the CNS ladder brightly stains with anti-Ptp4E and anti-GFP. Ptp4E also accumulates in cell bodies, since the
CNS region outside of the axon tracts stains brightly (j,k,m,n, arrows). PNS cell bodies (chordotonal organs) are also visible
(j,k, arrowheads). (j-l) Images are projections of confocal stacks. (m-o) Images are single confocal sections. Scale bars are 35

Characterization of Ptp4E mutations
We generated a deletion mutation in Ptp4E, denoted
Ptp4E1, by imprecise excision of a P element, EP425,
located upstream of the putative transcription start site.
This mutation removes the first and second exons, thus
deleting the sequences encoding the initiating methionine and the first 67 amino acids of the Ptp4E protein
(Figure 1a).

which encodes a ligand for the fibroblast growth factor
receptor Heartless-, is expressed in a similar pattern [27].
Figure 2d is a germ-band extended embryo expressing a
UAS-linked Ptp4E-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion
from the engrailed-GAL4 driver. This shows the expected
striped pattern of expression, confirming that the probe
recognizes Ptp4E and allowing an estimate of the relative
levels of driven versus endogenous Ptp4E mRNA.

Ptp4E1/Y males are viable, fertile, and apparently healthy,
as are Ptp4E1/Df(1)ovo4 females. We could not detect any
alterations in the CNS or neuromuscular system in
embryos or larvae of these genotypes. Df(1)ovo4/Y
embryos also had no CNS or neuromuscular system phenotypes that could be detected by antibody staining. To
determine if the absence of a loss-of-function phenotype
for Ptp4E is due to compensation by the closely related
Ptp10D protein, we constructed Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1 double
mutants. Ptp10D1 is an excision mutation that removes
the amino-terminal coding sequences of Ptp10D [3].
Ptp10D1 animals are viable and fertile, and also have no
detectable defects in their embryonic nervous systems. In
contrast, Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1/Y animals can hatch out into first
instar larvae, but die immediately after hatching. To
ensure that this lethality is not due to other mutations on
these chromosomes that confer lethality when combined
in the Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1 recombinant chromosome, we also
made a double mutant chromosome containing independently isolated insertions just upstream of Ptp4E
(Ptp4EKG2328) and Ptp10D (Ptp10DEP1172). This chromosome is also lethal in hemizygous males (Ptp4EKG2328
Ptp10DEP1172/Y). These data confirm the hypothesis that
the viability of animals lacking either Ptp4E or Ptp10D is
due to compensation by the other protein.

At stage 14, Ptp4E is widely expressed, with highest levels
observed in the midgut. Expression in the CNS can also be
seen (Figure 2e). Finally, at stage 17 expression is much
higher in the gut than elsewhere, with particularly strong
expression observed in the hindgut and at the anterior end
of the midgut (Figure 2f).

Expression of Ptp4E mRNA and protein
The published in situ hybridization data suggest that Ptp4E
mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in late embryos,
although there are some level differences between tissues
[25]. To further analyze expression, and to ensure that the
observed pattern was not affected by cross-hybridization
between the closely related Ptp4E and Ptp10D phosphatase domain sequences, we repeated this analysis
using a probe from the first four Ptp4E exons, which are
not closely related to Ptp10D.

In gastrulating embryos, Ptp4E mRNA is enriched in the
invaginating mesoderm (Figure 2a). In germ band
extended embryos (stage 10–11), the strongest expression
is observed in the posterior midgut primordium. There is
also an interesting 'scalloped' pattern of expression
observed at the ectodermal border (Figure 2b,c, vm). This
has an intriguing correspondence to visceral mesoderm
dpERK staining [26], suggesting that Ptp4E may be
enriched at sites of RTK activation. Interestingly, thisbe,

To examine Ptp4E protein expression and localization, we
generated a variety of mouse monoclonal and polyclonal
antibodies against Ptp4E. We made a construct that consisted of 6×-His-tagged Ptp4E XC domain fused to human
placental alkaline phosphatase (PTP4E:AP; Figure 1b).
PTP4E:AP was expressed in insect cells, purified over a NiNTA column, and injected into mice. To characterize the
resulting antibodies, we first stained embryos that overexpressed Ptp4E-GFP using the engrailed-GAL4 driver. Figure
2g,h shows double staining of a germ-band extended
embryo with anti-Ptp4E (red) and anti-GFP (green). The
polyclonal antibodies clearly recognize the Ptp4E protein,
as anti-Ptp4E (red) signal colocalizes with anti-GFP
(green) signal in the expected striped pattern. Figure 2i
shows a wild-type embryo at the same stage stained with
anti-Ptp4E, where the expression appears to be ubiquitous. Note that the staining between the stripes in Figure
2g is much weaker than within the stripes, suggesting that
the endogenous protein is expressed at low levels.
Although the ubiquitous staining observed with the antibody is consistent with the in situ hybridization data, we
cannot be sure that antibody staining in wild-type
embryos is due to Ptp4E protein, because it is not significantly reduced in Ptp4E mutant embryos (Ptp4E1 or
Df(1)ovo4). This finding could be explained in two ways.
First, Ptp4E1 mutants might continue to make an abnormal Ptp4E protein(s) due to initiation of translation at
methionine residues encoded in exons not removed by
the excision mutation (the second methionine residue in
Ptp4E is at amino acid 377, within an undeleted exon).
This protein, if it exists, would lack a signal sequence and
may be nonfunctional, because the CNS phenotypes of
Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1 and Df(1)ovo4 Ptp10D1/Y embryos are
identical (Figure 3). Df(1)ovo4 deletes the entire Ptp4E
gene (Figure 1). The presence of antibody staining in
Df(1)ovo4 mutants could be due to persistence of Ptp4E
protein synthesized from maternal mRNA, since early
embryos contain large amounts of Ptp4E mRNA [25].

CNS phenotype of Ptp4E Ptp10D double mutants
CNS phenotype of Ptp4E Ptp10D double mutants. (a-d,h) Stage 17 embryos were stained with mAb 1D4 and visualized using
HRP immunohistochemistry. (e-g) Stage 17 embryos expressing the transgene SemaIIb-myc were stained with anti-Myc antibodies, and images are projections of confocal stacks. (a) Wild-type embryos at stage 17 show three distinct longitudinal tracts
on either side of the midline. Commissural bundles do not stain with 1D4 at this stage, although cell bodies showing light staining are visible here. Ptp4E1 (b) and Ptp10D1 (c) embryos do not show any defects in CNS axon guidance, and are indistinguishable from control w1118 CNS (a). The double mutants Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1 (d) and Df(1)ovo4 ptp10D1 (h) show mild CNS defects. The
longitudinal axons appear wavy and the outermost longitudinal axon tract is discontinuous and often invades the middle (intermediate) longitudinal axon tract (arrowheads). SemaIIB axons were visualized using the SemaIIb-myc transgene. (e) In the
wild-type CNS, semaIIb-myc expressing axons project across the midline along the anterior commissural bundle and extend
anteriorly along the intermediate 1D4 fascicle (arrows indicate the direction of axon trajectory). (f,g) SemaIIb-myc axons
project in a normal manner in the double mutants. However, they have a consistent defect within their longitudinally projecting
segment, in which the axon bundles do not form a tight bundle but have a frayed appearance (arrowheads). Anterior is up in all
panels. Scale bars are 10 microns.

Second, it is possible that our Ptp4E antibodies cross-react
with another ubiquitously expressed protein. They do not
cross-react with Ptp10D, because the signal does not
decrease in Ptp10D1 mutant embryos.

Although we could not use the antibody to define where
Ptp4E is expressed in the embryonic CNS in wild-type
embryos, its ability to recognize overexpressed Ptp4E protein (Figure 2g,h) allowed us to ask whether Ptp4E can

*Expression of UAS-4E-GFP in neurons using the elav-GAL4 driver produces incomplete rescue (from 30% to 7%, versus 1–2% in single mutants).
However, the statistical difference between Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1 and Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1; UAS-4E-GFP/elav was highly significant (p < 0.0001, Chi-square test),
indicating that pan-neural expression of Ptp4E rescues. † Statistical differences between Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1 and each of the single mutants were also

localize to axons. To do this, we drove Ptp4E-GFP with the
pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 driver. In these embryos, bright
staining of both CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS)
axons is observed with anti-Ptp4E and anti-GFP antibodies,
and the two patterns are superimposable (Figure 2j–o).
Interestingly, Ptp4E-GFP also appears to localize to neuronal cell bodies in the PNS and CNS (Figures 2j–l). In contrast, Ptp10D, Ptp69D, Lar, and Ptp99A, which are
restricted to axons in wild-type embryos, are also axon-specific when overexpressed (unpublished data).

UAS-containing P element insertion upstream of the gene,
so it allows rescue by crossing in GAL4 drivers) rescues
lethality, allowing some adults to emerge. These data confirm that lethality in the double mutant is rescuable by
Ptp10D expression in tracheae (or in other cells that
express breathless-GAL4). We also attempted to rescue
lethality by ubiquitous expression of Ptp4E, but found
that pancellular overexpression of Ptp4E-GFP driven by
tubulin-GAL4 is lethal.

Expression of Ptp10D protein was detected only in the
nervous system in published work. It is selectively
expressed on embryonic CNS axons [16,17], and in the
neuropil of the larval and adult brain [28]. Our recent data,
however, show that Ptp10D is also expressed by embryonic
tracheal cells. These findings suggest that the embryonic/
larval lethality of Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1 animals might be due to
either nervous system or tracheal phenotypes. In fact, we
have found that these embryos have severe tracheal defects.
These will be described elsewhere (MJ and KZ, manuscript
in preparation). Their nervous system defects, however, are
relatively mild (see below), and would not be expected to
produce early lethality. Consistent with this, we find that
GAL4-driven pan-neural expression of a UAS-Ptp4E-GFP
fusion, which is capable of rescuing the tracheal phenotype
when driven in tracheal cells by breathless-GAL4 (MJ and
KZ, manuscript in preparation), does not rescue lethality in
the Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1 background.

Analysis of CNS phenotypes in double and triple mutants
lacking Ptp4E
To evaluate CNS defects in multiply mutant embryos, we
stained them with a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 1D4,
and also crossed a SemaIIB-Myc reporter [29] into the
mutant backgrounds. mAb 1D4, directed against the cytoplasmic domain of Fasciclin II [30], stains three longitudinal bundles on each side of the CNS in stage 17 embryos.
Figure 3 shows 1D4 staining of the CNS in stage 17 wildtype, Ptp4E1, Ptp10D1, Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1, and Df(1)ovo4
Ptp10D1 embryos. In both of the Ptp4E double mutant
genotypes, a mild fraying of the longitudinal bundles is
observed. The outer bundle is often incompletely formed,
and the outer bundle invades the middle longitudinal
bundle. The phenotypes of the two genotypes are of
approximately equal severity, suggesting that Ptp4E1 could
be a null mutation. Table 1 shows the quantitative comparison of the CNS phenotypes in double and triple
mutant combinations.

Driving Ptp10D in tracheae with breathless-GAL4 in a

The CNS defects are specific to loss of Ptp4E, because they
can be rescued by supplying wild-type Ptp4E in neurons.

CNS axon guidance defects in double and triple mutants
CNS axon guidance defects in double and triple mutants. Stage 17 embryos were stained with (a,b,f) 1D4 and (c-e,g,h) antiMyc as in Figure 3. (a) The Ptp4E, Ptp69D CNS shows very mild defects with 1D4 in which the outer longitudinal bundle is
slightly wavy. (e) The SemaIIb-myc axons are almost indistinguishable from wild-type, although there is some slight fraying of
the longitudinal segments of the pathways. (b) The Ptp10D; Ptp69D CNS has a strong ectopic midline crossing defect in which
1D4 axons grow across the posterior commissure (arrow); a thinner bundle is observed in the anterior commissure (arrowhead). Only one or two longitudinal bundles are visible, and the width of the CNS axon ladder indicates that the outer bundle
is missing. (c) SemaIIb-myc axons in Ptp10D; Ptp69D. A thin axon bundle crosses the CNS in the posterior commissure
(arrowhead). (d) An extreme Ptp10D, Ptp69D phenotype, with axons that project out of the CNS (arrows), and stalled growth
cones along the longitudinal tract (asterisk). (f) 1D4 staining in Ptp4E Ptp10D; Ptp69D triple mutants show thick bundles that
cross the midline in each segment (asterisk). There are two or three distinct longitudinal bundles (arrowhead). (g,h) Thick bundles of SemaIIb-myc axons in the triple mutant cross the midline in the posterior commissure (g, arrowhead; h, top arrowhead). A stalled axonal projection in this commissure is seen in (g, asterisk). Other abnormally crossing axons are indicated
with arrowheads in (h). Anterior is up in all panels. Scale bars are 10 microns.

When we drove expression of the UAS-Ptp4E-GFP transgene with elav-GAL4, the break and fraying phenotypes
were rescued to near-wild-type levels. The differences
between Ptp4E Ptp10D and the rescued or wild-type
embryos are both highly statistically significant (p <
0.0001; Table 1). There is also a subtle overexpression

phenotype produced by driving Ptp4E-GFP in neurons, in
which the longitudinal bundles have a 'wavy' appearance
(data not shown).
SemaIIB-Myc is a useful marker for a specific axon pathway that crosses the midline in the anterior commissure

and then extends anteriorly within the longitudinal tract
[29]. Staining with anti-Myc antibodies in embryos
expressing this reporter in the Ptp4E1 Ptp10D1 background
reveals that the longitudinal portions of the SemaIIB axon
pathway exhibit a mild fraying, consistent with the 1D4
results (Figure 3).
Previous work from our group showed that Ptp10D
Ptp69D mutants have a specific CNS phenotype in which
some 1D4-positive longitudinal axons abnormally cross
the midline. Two distinct longitudinal bundles usually
remain in these mutants. The Ptp10D Ptp69D combination genetically interacts with robo1, slit, and commissureless mutations, and the data suggest that repulsive
signalling through Robo1 in response to engagement of
the midline Slit ligand is reduced in the absence of these
RPTPs [3].
Since Ptp4E is similar to Ptp10D, we wondered whether
Ptp4E might also genetically interact with Ptp69D to produce a synthetic CNS phenotype affecting the 1D4-positive longitudinal axons. This, however, is not the case.
Ptp4E Ptp69D double mutants, like Ptp69D single
mutants, have wild-type 1D4 and SemaIIB-Myc patterns
(Table 1, Figure 4a,e).
We then asked whether removal of both Ptp4E and
Ptp10D together with Ptp69D would generate a new synthetic phenotype. We observed that the Ptp4E Ptp10D;
Ptp69D triple mutant has a strong 1D4 phenotype, with
extensive ectopic midline crossing (Figure 4f, Table 1).
The 1D4 pattern shows midline crossing defects like those
observed in Ptp10D Ptp69D mutants [3], in which a 1D4positive bundle crosses in the posterior commissure, but
the crossing bundle often is thicker than in the double
mutants (Figure 4f, asterisk).
The longitudinal tracts look different from those in
Ptp10D Ptp69D mutants, because they have more distinct
bundles. In Ptp10D Ptp69D, two 1D4 bundles are
observed that sometimes fuse into one, and the CNS is
narrowed, suggesting that the outer bundle is missing
(Figure 4b). In the triple mutants, there are always two,
and sometimes three, longitudinal bundles. Extensive
fusion and breakage of the bundles are observed, however
(Figure 4f).
When examined with SemaIIB-Myc, the Ptp10D Ptp69D
double mutant displays occasional ectopic crossing by
single axons in the posterior commissure (Figure 4c,
arrowhead). Rare embryos have much more severe phenotypes in which the axons stall along the longitudinal
pathways (Figure 4d, asterisk), and axons project out of
the CNS rather than along the longitudinal tracts (Figure
4d, arrows). The triple mutant is observed to have more

http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/3/1/3

ectopic midline crossing in the posterior commissure than
does the double mutant, and the crossing bundles are
thicker (Figure 4g, arrowhead; Figure 4h). In one segment
of Figure 4h, all of the axons that should project anteriorly
appear to cross instead (top arrowhead). Other axons start
crossing and then stall (Figure 4g, asterisk). We never
observed SemaIIB axons that projected out of the CNS in
triple mutant embryos (n = 10). It is difficult to say
whether removing Ptp4E from a Ptp10D Ptp69D double
mutant suppresses or enhances the double mutant phenotype. The phenotype changes, so that the outer 1D4 longitudinal bundle is restored in some segments of triple
mutants. However, more ectopic crossing of SemaIIB
axons is observed, and the ectopically crossing 1D4 bundles are often thicker.
What does this pattern of phenotypic interactions imply
about the roles of these three RPTPs in CNS axon guidance? First, the existence of the synthetic Ptp10D Ptp69D
phenotype indicates that Ptp10D and Ptp69D have
redundant functions with regard to control of midline
crossing, and that the activities of Ptp10D that are compensated for by Ptp69D with respect to midline crossing
are not shared with Ptp4E. Second, there could be additional Ptp69D functions in CNS axonal guidance that are
redundant with Ptp4E activities that are not shared
between Ptp4E and Ptp10D. However, elimination of
these activities in Ptp4E Ptp69D double mutants does not
produce a strong 1D4 or SemaIIB phenotype. Third, when
all functions of the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily of RPTPs are
eliminated, the 1D4 and SemaIIB phenotypes are still
weak because these functions are mostly redundant with
activities of Ptp69D. Finally, when all the Ptp10D/Ptp4E
functions are removed together with the Ptp69D functions, the phenotype is subtly altered relative to the
Ptp10D Ptp69D phenotype. The lack of a strong synthetic
triple mutant phenotype suggests that Ptp4E is a relatively
minor player in regulation of CNS axon guidance.
An earlier study from our group examined CNS axons in
double, triple, and quadruple mutant combinations of
Lar, Ptp10D, Ptp69D, and Ptp99A mutations [4]. Strikingly, in this paper it was found that Lar Ptp69D Ptp99A
and Ptp10D Lar Ptp99A triple mutants both have an
almost normal pattern of 1D4-positive longitudinal
axons, but when the fourth RPTP is removed as well (in a
Ptp10D Lar Ptp69D Ptp99A quadruple mutant) all of the
1D4-positive longitudinal pathways are converted to
commissural pathways that cross the midline. Thus, Lar
and Ptp99A can have a strong effect on CNS axon guidance, but only when they are removed together with both
Ptp10D and Ptp69D.
We wondered whether analysis of other mutant combinations involving Ptp4E would produce results consistent

with the idea that strong synthetic 1D4 CNS phenotypes
are unique to combinations in which both Ptp10D and
Ptp69D are mutant, as suggested by [4]. To examine this,
we made Ptp4E Lar, Ptp4E Ptp52F, and Ptp4E Ptp99A double mutants, and Ptp4E Ptp10D Lar and Ptp4E Ptp10D
Ptp52F triple mutants. Ptp4E Lar and Ptp4E Ptp99A
mutants had no detectable alterations in 1D4-positive
CNS longitudinal tracts. Ptp4E Ptp10D Lar mutants had
phenotypes like those of Ptp4E Ptp10D double mutants,
indicating that there are no important longitudinal axon
guidance functions that are redundant between the
Ptp10D/Ptp4E protein pair and Lar. Ptp52 mutants are the
only Rptp single mutants that have a detectable 1D4 phenotype [5]. Ptp4E Ptp52F mutants had 1D4 phenotypes
indistinguishable from Ptp52F single mutants, while
Ptp4E Ptp10D Ptp52F triple mutants had stronger phenotypes. However, we had already demonstrated that
Ptp10D Ptp52F double mutants have a more disorganized
pattern of 1D4-positive bundles than Ptp52F single
mutants [5]. The Ptp4E Ptp10D Ptp52F triple mutant does
not show an obvious enhancement of phenotype relative
to the Ptp10D Ptp52F double mutant (data not shown). In
summary, of the eight mutant combinations involving
Ptp4E that we examined, only the triple mutant that lacks
both Ptp10D and Ptp69D has a strong CNS phenotype
that is detectable with the markers used in this study. This
phenotype is much like the Ptp10D Ptp69D double
mutant phenotype, but differs from it in some subtle
ways.

nerve. One of the two SNa branches (anterior/dorsal or
posterior/lateral) is missing in approximately 40% of
hemisegments in zygotic null mutants [5].
When double, triple, and quadruple combinations of Rptp
mutations were analyzed, we observed that other decisions are perturbed in specific patterns. Each combination
of mutations has a unique phenotype, and the data suggest that specific RPTPs are required for each pathway
choice made by motor axon growth cones. This is
described for ISNb guidance in the Background section.
Another example is extension of the ISN past branchpoints in the dorsal muscle field. In Lar single mutants,
the ISN usually reaches its normal termination point but
arborization on muscle 1 is reduced. In the absence of
both Lar and Ptp69D, the ISN stops at the second branchpoint near muscle 2, while in Lar Ptp69D Ptp99A triple
mutants it stops at the first branchpoint near muscle 3
[19].
Not all combinations of Rptp mutations produce phenotypic enhancement. Ptp99A and Lar have opposing activities in controlling ISNb entry into the VLM field. Thus, in
the strongest Lar mutant combination only 40% of ISNb
branches successfully enter the VLM field, while in Lar
Ptp99A double mutants this phenotype is almost completely suppressed, and approximately 96% of ISNbs
enter the muscle field in a normal manner [4,19].

Roles of the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily in motor axon
guidance
We also used mAb 1D4 staining to evaluate the motor
axon phenotypes in all of these mutant combinations.
There are approximately 36 motor neurons in each
abdominal hemisegment. Motor axons exit the CNS in
two main nerve roots (ISN and SN), then split into five
distinct nerve branches. ISNd and SNc innervate ventral
muscles, ISNb innervates ventrolateral muscles (VLMs),
SNa innervates lateral muscles, and ISN innervates dorsal
muscles. The patterns of motor axons in segments A2–A7
are essentially identical, so it is possible to quantitatively
score phenotypes in up to 12 hemisegments per embryo.

For the first four RPTPs to be analyzed (Lar, Ptp69D,
Ptp99A, Ptp10D), it was possible to construct and analyze
all 15 possible single, double, triple, and quadruple
mutant combinations, and thus obtain a complete picture
of the genetic relationships among these signalling molecules [4]. When we identified mutations in the fifth gene,
Ptp52F, it became impossible to make and analyze every
combination, so we examined only double mutants [5].
These two studies led to the conclusion that Ptp10D is relatively unimportant, relative to the other RPTPs, for regulation of motor axon guidance. This conclusion is
opposite to that reached for CNS axon guidance, where we
observe ectopic midline crossing only in genotypes where
Ptp10D is missing [4].

Earlier work from our group and others showed that Rptp
mutations affect every guidance decision made by these
motor axon branches (with the exception of SNc branching, which has not been studied). Lar and Ptp52F are the
only single mutants that have strong phenotypes. Lar
mutations produce a 'parallel bypass' phenotype (approximately 30% penetrance in zygotic nulls), in which the
ISNb axons leave the common ISN pathway at the exit
junction but then fail to enter the VLM field. ISNd also
fails to extend (approximately 80% penetrance) in these
mutants [2,19]. Ptp52F regulates bifurcation of the SNa

Enhancement of Ptp52F phenotypes is observed in Ptp10D
Ptp52F double mutants, so that ISNb 'stall' phenotypes, in
which the ISNb stops short of its normal termination
point at the ventral edge of muscle 12, and ISN truncation
phenotypes are observed more frequently [5]. These are
the only double mutants involving Ptp10D that exhibit
phenotypic enhancement relative to the corresponding
single mutant. Ptp10D mutations increase the penetrance
of some double and triple mutant motor axon phenotypes involving Lar, Ptp69D, and Ptp99A, and decrease the
penetrance of others [4].

Ptp52F and Ptp10D Ptp52F) are statistically significant (p < 0.0001, Chi-square test). §The results for Dlar5.5/Dlar13.2 were published in [19]. ¶While
approximately 90% of ISNbs end at the base of m13 in both genotypes, the phenotype is different in the triple mutant: 56% of stalled ISNb axons in
triple mutants form a clump, whereas in the double mutant they simply resemble earlier (stage 16) axons with growth-cone like morphologies.
These embryos were scored with genotypes blinded by another observer to make sure we could distinguish the phenotypes. The difference
between the triple and the double mutants is highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001, Chi-square test). ¥Difference between the triple and the
double mutant (Ptp10D Ptp69D) is statistically significant (p < 0.0001, Chi-square test).

We wondered whether this apparent lack of a role for
Ptp10D in motor axon guidance arises from the fact that
Ptp10D is the only RPTP in Drosophila that has a paralog
within the same subfamily. Each of the other RPTPs
appears to represent its own subfamily. The Lar subfamily
has a representative in C. elegans and three members in
mammals, while Ptp69D and Ptp99A each have one

worm counterpart but no obvious mammalian orthologs
[5]. Ptp52F has similarities to type III RPTPs, but has a
unique amino-terminal sequence and appears to be
unique to drosophilids (unpublished results). Because of
their close sequence relationship, the loss of Ptp10D function in the motor axon system might be compensated for
by the presence of Ptp4E. This model predicts that Ptp4E

distal to the tracheal dorsal trunk (shown in dotted lines). (b) In a Ptp4E Ptp10D; Ptp52F triple mutant embryo, ISN stalls at the

branches are very thin (d, arrowhead) or almost undetectable (f, arrow). The branch on the right in (f, arrowhead) is normal.
The left SNa in (e) has only stubs at the branchpoint (arrowhead). The SNa on the right abnormally projects beyond the muscle 22/23 bifurcation cleft and sends a thin projection toward an abnormal ISN side branch (e, asterisk). (g,h) The SNa in

grow out along the ISN, producing an ectopic branch onto muscle 12 (l, right arrow). In the middle hemisegment, thin branches
also emerge from the clump and grow onto the surface of muscle 13 (m, arrowhead). Anterior is left and ventral is down in all

Figure 6
Summary of pairwise genetic interaction among all six RPTPs
Summary of pairwise genetic interaction among all six RPTPs. Matrices depict role of RPTPs in CNS longitudinal axon guidance
(a) and motor axon guidance (b). (c) Interaction of Ptp4E Ptp10D double mutant with RPTPs. Ptp4E shows enhancement of
motor axon guidance phenotypes observed in Ptp10D Ptp69D and Ptp10D Ptp52F double mutants. Thicker lines indicate
stronger genetic interaction than thinner lines. Red double headed arrows indicate synthetic genetic interactions. Black single
headed arrows indicate enhancement/cooperation, and the blue lines indicate genetic suppression.

double mutant combinations also would not exhibit phenotypic enhancement relative to the corresponding single
mutants. Indeed, we found this to be the case: no motor
axon phenotypes are observed in Ptp4E Ptp99A mutants,
and the phenotypes seen in Ptp4E Ptp69D, Ptp4E Lar, and
Ptp4E Ptp52F mutants are no stronger than in the corresponding Ptp69D, Lar, and Ptp52F single mutants. We also
found that removal of both members of the Ptp10D subfamily, in Ptp4E Ptp10D double mutants, does not produce motor axon phenotypes, suggesting that the
subfamily has no essential role in motor axon guidance
that is not compensated for by the presence of one of the
other RPTPs (Table 2 and data not shown).
We then asked whether strong phenotypic interactions
might be observed in triple mutants lacking both Ptp4E
and Ptp10D together with one of the other subfamilies. If
so, this would indicate that there are motor axon guidance
functions that are redundant between the Ptp10D subfamily and another subfamily, so that synthetic phenotypes would be observed only when both subfamilies are
eliminated. To examine this question, we analyzed the triple mutants described above for motor axon phenotypes.
Our data show that Ptp4E Ptp10D Lar mutants do not have
any new phenotypes, and also do not exhibit phenotypic
enhancement relative to Lar single mutants (Table 2).
Thus, as for CNS axon guidance, there appear to be no
important functions of the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily that
are uncovered by removal of Lar.

For the other two triple mutant combinations, however,
we did observe phenotypic enhancement by removal of
both Ptp4E and Ptp10D. Ptp4E Ptp10D Ptp69D triple
mutants have a stronger ISNb phenotype than any of the
component double mutants. This is a 'clump' phenotype
in which 90% of ISNbs terminate in a darkly staining blob
at the dorsal border of muscle 6 (Figures 5l,m). In cases
where the ISNb passes this point, it is often misrouted
(Figure 5k, right hemisegment), or bypasses the muscle
field (Figure 5l) by growing along the ISN. As in bypass
phenotypes seen in other mutants, the axons often ectopically project interiorly to muscle 12 from the ISN (Figure
5l, right arrow), suggesting that they retain an affinity for
this muscle. Ptp10D Ptp69D double mutants have a similar percentage of ISNb branches that fail to reach muscle
12 (stall phenotype); however, these branches maintain a
growth cone-like appearance (Figure 5j).
In almost every affected triple mutant hemisegment, the
ISNb clump is at the same point. These data suggest that
extension of ISNb axons onto muscle 13 might require a
specific signalling event(s) that can be mediated by either
a type III RPTP or by Ptp69D. In contrast, for most other
published Rptp stall phenotypes (for example, Ptp69D
Ptp99A [1,19]) defective ISNbs terminate at a variety of
sites, suggesting that loss of the RPTPs produces multiple
defects in pathway choice and extension that occur in a
probabilistic manner. The differences between the triple
and double mutant phenotypes are highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001; Table 2).

We also observed a subtle phenotypic enhancement for
SNa defects. We previously showed that Ptp10D Ptp69D
double mutants have a SNa defect in which one of the
branches is missing (13% penetrance of a completely
absent branch). For a smaller percentage of SNas (10%),
both branches are missing or the SNa fails to even reach
the bifurcation point. In Ptp4E Ptp10D Ptp69D triple
mutants, the penetrances of the missing branch phenotypes are similar to those in the double mutant, but an
additional 9% of SNa nerves are very thin (Figure 5f,
arrow) or completely absent; this phenotype is not seen in
Ptp10D Ptp69D (p < 0.0001; Table 2) Also, there are SNa
nerves that project along abnormal pathways (Figure 5d).
The other major effect on motor axon guidance we
observed in response to loss of Ptp4E was enhancement of
a Ptp10D Ptp52F phenotype in which the ISN is truncated
at the second branchpoint. This phenotype is observed in
about 20% of hemisegments in the double mutant. However, the penetrance of second branchpoint truncation
increases to 60% in the Ptp4E Ptp10D Ptp52F triple mutant
(p < 0.0001; Figure 5b, Table 2). For the other phenotypes
of Ptp10D Ptp52F (SNa bifurcation failure and ISNb stalling), we saw only small increases in phenotypic penetrance when Ptp4E is removed.

or more of the eight nonreceptor PTPs. Some of these are
ubiquitously expressed. Only three have been genetically
characterized. Csw and PTP-ER are involved in cell fate
determination [31,32]. Mutations in ptpmeg produce
axonal defects in the adult brain [33]. Ptpmeg, however,
does not act in the neurons that exhibit the axonal phenotypes, but is required in surrounding cells [33]. Thus, it is
unlikely to participate in growth cone signal transduction
in the same manner as the RPTPs.
Ptp10D and Ptp4E are the only Drosophila RPTPs that are
members of the same subfamily; the other four are each
the sole fly representative of their subfamily. Mutations in
three of the other four Rptp genes (Lar, Ptp52F, Ptp69D)
cause lethality. This suggests that the viability of Ptp10D
and Ptp4E single mutants might be due to compensation
by the other member of the subfamily, and that a Ptp4E
Ptp10D double mutation would cause lethality. This is in
fact observed; the double mutant dies at hatching. However, it does not have generalized defects. Rather, the
defects we have found are all within the nervous system
and the tracheal network. Our unpublished data show
that Ptp10D is also selectively expressed in tracheal cells
(MJ and KZ, manuscript in preparation). We suggest that
Ptp4E Ptp10D double mutant phenotypes are observed
only where Ptp10D is expressed.

Conclusion
In Drosophila, five of the six RPTPs were reported to be
neural-specific in late embryos, and all the zygotic Rptp
phenotypes that have been published are axon guidance
alterations. In contrast, many of the 17 mammalian
RPTPs are expressed in non-neural cell types and have a
variety of functions unrelated to axon guidance. Since
Ptp4E is the only widely expressed Rptp gene, we speculated that studying its mutant phenotype might reveal
new functions for Drosophila RPTPs outside the nervous
system, and that these might provide information about
functions of mammalian non-neural RPTPs. One might
have expected that Ptp4E mutations would cause lethality
and produce strong phenotypes, since no other RPTPs
would be able to compensate for the loss of Ptp4E in nonneural cells. This, however, is not the case. Ptp4E mutants
are viable, fertile, and apparently healthy, and have no
detectable phenotypes in the nervous system or elsewhere. Furthermore, our evolutionary analysis indicates
that Ptp4E is a relatively recent invention; it is present in
drosophilids but not in mosquitoes or non-dipteran
arthropods. Within the drosophilids, its sequence also
changes more rapidly than that of Ptp10D, suggesting that
it has been less constrained by evolution (Figure 1). All of
these considerations indicate that Ptp4E is not essential
for development of non-neural cell types in Drosophila.
Perhaps in Drosophila the functions executed by mammalian RPTPs in non-neural cell types are carried out by one

The analysis described in this paper, together with that in
several other papers from our group [4,5,19] allow us to
assemble complete genetic interaction matrices for pairwise combinations of mutations in all six of the Rptp
genes. Figure 6a is a matrix depicting the functions of the
RPTPs in regulation of longitudinal axon guidance in the
CNS, as assayed by 1D4 staining. The lines represent different types of genetic interactions. Red double-headed
arrows indicate synthetic phenotypes, where neither of
the single mutants exhibits a detectable phenotype but the
double mutant has a phenotype; the arrow thickness indicates the strength of the phenotype. These are seen for
Ptp10D Ptp69D [3] and Ptp4E Ptp10D (Figure 3). Black
arrows indicate enhancement of a single mutant phenotype by removal of a second RPTP. In the CNS, these are
observed only for Ptp52F, since this is the only single
mutant that has a CNS phenotype detectable with 1D4.
Finally, blue lines with bars at the end indicate suppression, where removal of a second RPTP suppresses the single mutant phenotype. This is observed for Lar Ptp52F
mutants [5], and may indicate that these two RPTPs function in a competitive manner (in a formal genetic sense)
to regulate a CNS signalling pathway.
Figure 6b shows the interaction matrix for motor axon
guidance. This is different from the CNS interaction
matrix, so we can conclude that the relationships between
the RPTP signalling pathways differ in some cases

between motor neurons and CNS interneurons. However,
Ptp10D Ptp69D double mutants have a synthetic SNa phenotype [4], so these two RPTPs interact strongly in regulating both CNS and motor axon guidance. Loss of Ptp10D
also enhances both the CNS and motor axon defects of
Ptp52F mutants [5].
As in the CNS, there are competitive relationships
between RPTPs, but they are seen for a different RPTP pair.
In motor axons, removal of Ptp99A completely suppresses
the Lar ISNb parallel bypass phenotype [19]. Lar mutations enhance the Ptp52F motor axon phenotypes rather
than suppressing them as they do in the CNS [5].
In this paper, we have defined the phenotypes associated
with simultaneous elimination of the functions of two
RPTP subfamilies, by examining triple mutants removing
both Ptp4E and Ptp10D together with each of the other
three RPTPs whose absence produces lethality. This analysis shows that the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily is redundant
with Ptp69D in controlling guidance decisions made by
three neuronal types, but Ptp4E mutants have relatively
minor effects relative to Ptp10D mutants. For guidance of
1D4 and SemaIIB axons within the CNS, removal of both
members of the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily together with
Ptp69D modulates the phenotype observed in Ptp10D
Ptp69D mutants (Figure 4). For SNa axons, the triple
mutant has an enhanced phenotype, in that 10% of SNa
nerves now fail to extend altogether; this is almost never
observed in double mutants (Figures 5 and 6c). We also
observe enhancement of a Ptp10D Ptp52F ISN truncation
phenotype by removal of Ptp4E (Figures 5 and 6c), but no
strong interactions between Ptp4E Ptp10D and Lar are
observed in the CNS or neuromuscular system.
These results suggest that there is a special relationship
between the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily and Ptp69D. Perhaps these two types of RPTPs have similar substrates in
both CNS interneurons and motor neurons. In CNS neurons, some critical substrate(s) dephosphorylated by
Ptp69D might also be dephosphorylated by either
Ptp10D or Ptp4E, so that certain phenotypes, such as
crossing of all the SemaIIB axons in the wrong commissure (Figure 4h), are observed only when all three RPTPs
are eliminated. However, in CNS neurons such as the neuroblast 2–5 lineage, whose axons ectopically cross the
midline in Ptp10D Ptp69D double mutants [3], Ptp4E cannot compensate for the loss of Ptp10D. Perhaps in these
cells the relevant Ptp69D substrate(s) can be dephosphorylated by Ptp10D but not by Ptp4E; however, this seems
unlikely given that Ptp4E and Ptp10D have PTP domains
that are much more similar to each other than are those of
Ptp69D and Ptp10D. Alternatively, perhaps the Ptp4E
concentration is too low in these neurons for efficient
dephosphorylation to occur. Another possibility is that

http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/3/1/3

growth cones of these neurons contact Ptp10D ligands,
but not Ptp4E ligands, and that ligand contact is required
for signalling. An understanding of the biochemical origins of these genetic interactions will require identification and characterization of RPTP ligands, substrates and
downstream signalling proteins, as well as localization of
these proteins to specific neuronal types.

Materials and methods
Drosophila stocks and transgenic flies
Ptp4E1 was generated by imprecise excision of EP425 [34]
inserted 1,157 nucleotides upstream of the transcription
start. PCR was used to map the deletion endpoints. The
deletion removes approximately 10.5 kb, starting from
130 bp upstream of the EP425 insertion site to before the
start of exon 3. The excision event introduced chromosomal rearrangement, and as a result there are unrecognizable sequences between the endpoints.

The following Rptp mutant flies were used: Ptp10D1 [3];
Ptp69D1 and Df(3L)8ex25 [1]; Lar5.5 and Lar13.2 [2];
Ptp52F18.3 [5]. Lethal mutations were balanced over GFP
balancer chromosomes for sorting homozygous mutant
embryos. Double and triple mutant lines were checked for
the presence of Ptp4E1 by PCR. Elav-GAL4 was obtained
from Bloomington Stock Center (Bloomington, IN, USA).
All crosses were carried out at 25°C.
The UAS-Ptp4E-GFP construct was made by PCR amplification of the entire coding region of the long Ptp4E cDNA,
Ptp4E-A, and cloning it into the Gateway System vector
(DGRC, Bloomington, IN, USA). The vector used placed a
GFP sequence downstream of the Ptp4E coding sequence.
The entire construct was sequenced, and also expressed in
S2 cells to check for GFP expression to verify that PCR
errors were not introduced into the clone. Ptp4E-GFP
DNA was injected into embryos using standard methods
to generate transgenic flies. Multiple lines were generated
and examined; UAS-4E-GFP#4/CyO was used for all studies.
Generation of Ptp4E antibodies
To generate antibodies against the native protein, we
made a construct 4E-AP that was expressed in insect cells
using a baculovirus expression system. The 4E-AP construct was made by dropping in a 2.7 Psi I/Kpn I fragment
from Ptp4E-A (extracellular domain amino acids 169–
1073) into a modified baculovirus expression vector
pAcGP67-A (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The vector contains a pg67 secretion signal sequence followed by
a 6x-His tag, placed upstream of the Ptp4E insertion site.
The sequence for human placental alkaline phosphatase
was placed in frame, carboxy-terminal to the Ptp4E
sequence. The protein expressed consists of the gp67 signal peptide-6xHis-Ptp4E-AP fusion protein that was har-

vested from insect cell media. Protein was concentrated
ten-fold, then purified over a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA). Conditions used are: binding buffer
(10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM, Tris pH8.0),
wash buffer (25 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM,
Tris pH8.0), and elution buffer (250 mM imidazole, 300
mM NaCl, 20 mM, Tris pH8.0). Purified protein was
injected at approximately 100 g per boost. Antibodies
were generated at the Caltech Monoclonal Facility.

were: Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen) at
1:1,000, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA,
USA). Samples were mounted on Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) or glycerol. Samples were
photographed on the Zeiss Axioplan microscope using
DIC optics. Fluorescent images were taken on Zeiss
LSM510, and images were processed using Adobe Photoshop.

Whole-mount in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry
Embryos were collected overnight, fixed and hybridized
with digoxigenin-UTP antisense RNA probe. Probes were
generated from approximately 750 bp PCR product
amplified from Ptp4E cDNA that corresponds to the first
four exons. Conditions were used as previously described
in [35] with some modifications.

Phylogenetic tree
Phylogenetic tree construction was performed using the
software Geneious Pro, available at [37]. The accession
numbers of sequences are the following. Ptp4E-PA:
AAF45998 (melanogaster), CH940655 (virilis), CH902621
(ananassae). Ptp10D-PA: AAS65319 (melanogaster),
CH940655 (virilis), CH902630 (ananassae). Aedes aegypti,
AAEL012083. Anopheles gambiae, AGAP004246. Apis mellifera, GB19351.

Whole-mount antibody staining of stage 16–17 embryos
was performed using standard procedures [36], with some
variations. Embryos were fixed for 20 minutes with 4%
paraformaldehyde. Washes were done in 0.1% PT (0.1%
Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline), and blocking
buffer used was PT with 0.1% bovine serum albumin +
5% normal goat serum. Double and triple mutant
embryos were balanced over GFP balancer chromosomes
and homozygous mutants were sorted for lack of GFP
expression. Anti-GFP and mAb 1D4 were simultaneously
incubated on embryos. Alexa-488 conjugated secondary
antibodies were used against anti-GFP, and non-green
embryos were sorted under an epifluorescent dissecting
microscope. These embryos were then treated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immunohistochemistry using
standard procedures [36] to visualize 1D4 staining pattern.
In cases where RPTP specific antibodies were used for sorting, staining was done in a sequential manner. Embryos
were first incubated with RPTP antibodies, sorted, and
then incubated with 1D4. For some of the triple mutant
combinations, live embryos were sorted under the epifluorescent dissecting microscope, then dissected live on
Superfrost/Plus adhesion slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline. These live
dissected embryos were fixed on the slide, and carried
through the same procedures as whole-mount embryo
staining procedure.
Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions:
anti-GFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 1:1,000, mAb
1D4 at 1:3, mouse anti-Ptp4E (polyclonal) at 1:500,
mouse anti-Ptp10D (8B2) at 1:3; mouse anti-Ptp69D
(2C2) at 1:3, mouse anti-Myc (clone 9E10, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) at 1:250. Secondary antibodies used
