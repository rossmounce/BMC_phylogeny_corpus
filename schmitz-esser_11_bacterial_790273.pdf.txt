A bacterial genome in transition - an exceptional
enrichment of IS elements but lack of evidence
for recent transposition in the symbiont
Amoebophilus asiaticus
Stephan Schmitz-Esser1,3*†, Thomas Penz1†, Anja Spang2 and Matthias Horn1

Abstract
Background: Insertion sequence (IS) elements are important mediators of genome plasticity and are widespread
among bacterial and archaeal genomes. The 1.88 Mbp genome of the obligate intracellular amoeba symbiont
Amoebophilus asiaticus contains an unusually large number of transposase genes (n = 354; 23% of all genes).
Results: The transposase genes in the A. asiaticus genome can be assigned to 16 different IS elements termed
ISCaa1 to ISCaa16, which are represented by 2 to 24 full-length copies, respectively. Despite this high IS element
load, the A. asiaticus genome displays a GC skew pattern typical for most bacterial genomes, indicating that no
major rearrangements have occurred recently. Additionally, the high sequence divergence of some IS elements, the
high number of truncated IS element copies (n = 143), as well as the absence of direct repeats in most IS
elements suggest that the IS elements of A. asiaticus are transpositionally inactive. Although we could show
transcription of 13 IS elements, we did not find experimental evidence for transpositional activity, corroborating our
results from sequence analyses. However, we detected contiguous transcripts between IS elements and their
downstream genes at nine loci in the A. asiaticus genome, indicating that some IS elements influence the
transcription of downstream genes, some of which might be important for host cell interaction.
Conclusions: Taken together, the IS elements in the A. asiaticus genome are currently in the process of
degradation and largely represent reflections of the evolutionary past of A. asiaticus in which its genome was
shaped by their activity.

Background
Mobile genetic elements such as phages, plasmids and
transposable elements play a vital role in horizontal
gene transfer and genome rearrangement in bacteria
and archaea [1]. Among transposable elements, insertion
sequence (IS) elements are particularly widespread
within bacterial and archaeal genomes, and are considered the most abundant and ubiquitous genes in nature
[2-6]. IS elements can have profound effects on chromosome structure and evolution. Due to their ability to

disrupt genes and to induce rearrangements such as
inversions, duplications and deletions they are key mediators of genome plasticity [2,3,7-9]. Although IS elements are perceived primarily as genomic parasites,
their activity can also be beneficial. As composite transposons IS elements are able to mobilize adjacent genes,
thereby mediating the spread of antibiotic resistance
genes and genes involved in the catabolism of complex
xenobiotics [10,11]. IS elements may also promote adaptation of their host genomes as demonstrated in experimental evolution experiments [12-15]. In addition, IS
elements can influence or activate the expression of
adjacent genes, e.g. by forming hybrid or fusion

promoters or by containing outward-directed promoters
[16-22].
IS elements are usually less than 2.5 kbp in length and
have a relatively simple genetic organization. Most IS
elements are flanked both by inverted and direct repeats
and generally encode no function other than those
involved in mobility, which is mediated by transposases
[16]. IS elements have been classified into several
families based on the degree of sequence conservation
of their transposases and its catalytic site, similar genetic
organization such as size, number of open reading
frames (ORFs) and potential coding sequences (CDSs),
inverted repeats, and genome target sites [2,16]. The
majority of IS elements encode transposases containing
the so-called DDE-motif consisting of the three amino
acids aspartic acid, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid.
These residues form the catalytic triad necessary for
transposition. They are found in three regions (N2, N3,
and C1) of the transposase amino acid sequence separated by spacers of various lengths [2,16].
Although IS elements are found in the majority of
sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes [2-4], their
distribution is patchy, and their occurrence within single
genomes is usually below 3% [2,6]. IS elements are very
rare in the genomes of most ancient host-restricted
symbionts or pathogens such as mutualistic insect and
clam symbionts or chlamydiae [23,24]. On the other
hand, elevated numbers of IS elements has been
observed in the genomes of bacteria which adapted only
recently to an intracellular or pathogenic lifestyle
[8,25-27]. However, this view has been challenged by
the recent detection of IS element-rich genomes in
ancient symbionts such as Wolbachia spp. or Orientia
tsutsugamushi [9,28-31]. Interestingly, the genomes containing the highest percentages of IS elements are from
obligate intracellular bacteria: Orientia tsutsugamushi
[28,29], the g1 symbiont of the marine oligochaete Olavius algarvensis [32], the symbionts of grain weevils
[26,33], and the amoeba symbiont Amoebophilus asiaticus 5a2 [34].
Amoebophilus asiaticus is a Gram-negative, obligate
intracellular symbiont, which has been discovered within
an amoeba isolated from alkaline lake sediment [35].
Highly similar A. asiaticus strains have been recovered
from various sources worldwide [35-38]. A. asiaticus
shows highest 16S rRNA similarity to ‘Candidatus Cardinium hertigii’, an obligate intracellular parasite of
arthropods able to manipulate the reproduction of its
hosts [39]. Both organisms belong to the phylum Bacteroidetes and form a monophyletic lineage in 16S rRNAbased phylogenetic trees [35], consisting only of symbionts and sequences retrieved from coral samples [40].
The A. asiaticus genome is only moderately reduced in
size compared to many other obligate intracellular

Page 2 of 16

bacteria [41,42] but nevertheless, its biosynthetic capabilities are extremely limited [34]. The A. asiaticus genome encodes a hitherto unparalleled high number of
proteins with eukaryotic domains such as ankyrin
repeats, TPR/SEL1 repeats, leucine-rich repeats and
domains from the eukaryotic ubiquitin system, and it
contains an unusually large number of transposase
genes (n = 354) corresponding to 23% of all genes [34].
Here, we report on the in-depth analysis of the IS elements in the A. asiaticus genome. We classified them
and describe their main characteristics. We demonstrated that other symbionts closely related to A. asiaticus contain highly similar IS elements, and we could
show that although they are transcribed, they exhibited
no transpositional acitivity on a population level during
a time period of almost 1,000 days. Taking into account
evidence that no major rearrangements have occurred
recently in the A. asiaticus genome, this suggests that
the IS elements are evolutionary older components of
the A. asiaticus genome, which likely played an important role during genome reduction and adaptation to an
obligate intracellular life style.

Results
Diversity of IS elements in the A. asiaticus 5a2 genome

IS elements make up 183 kbp (10%) of the A. asiaticus
genome. In total, 354 transposase genes (corresponding
to 23% of all CDSs) were identified in the detailed and
manually curated analysis performed here (Tables 1, 2).
Compared to other sequenced prokaryotic genomes, the
percentage of IS elements as well as the number of IS
elements per megabase genome is among the highest in
A. asiaticus (Additional file 1, Figures S1, S2). We were
able to assign the vast majority of these transposase
genes (n = 329, 93%; including partial IS element copies)
to 16 different IS elements (ISCaa1 to ISCaa16), which
belong to eight different IS element families, with IS5
family IS elements being most abundant in the A. asiaticus genome (Table 2). Each of the 16 IS elements is present in 2 to 24 full-length copies in the A. asiaticus
genome, the only exception being ISCaa1, which was
identified earlier by the ISFinder website [43] and is
only present as a single full-length copy (Table 2). This
results in a total copy number of 122 full-length IS elements that are evenly spread across the A. asiaticus genome [34]. A high number of IS elements in A. asiaticus
is truncated (n = 143), and in some cases (e.g. ISCaa5,
ISCaa6 and ISCaa11) there are more truncated than
full-length copies present (Table 2). Truncation sites
were generally not conserved, i.e. truncations occurred
in different regions, and truncated IS elements show
varying lengths (Additional file 1, Figure S3). For most
of the full-length IS element copies (n = 101, 83%) we
could not identify direct repeats (Tables 1, 2). In the

following sections we shortly describe few selected IS
elements of A. asiaticus in more detail.
ISCaa4

ISCaa4 is the most abundant IS element in A. asiaticus. It
is present in 24 full-length copies, 21 of these copies
should be able to produce an intact, functional transposase. ISCaa4 belongs to the IS1 family and shows a typical
IS1 family DDE-motif [2,44]. Similar to other IS1 family
members, the ISCaa4 transposase is encoded by two overlapping ORFs, which are probably translated into a 226
amino acid transposase by -1 ribosomal frameshifting
(Table 2, Additional file 1, Figure S4). Translational frameshifting is often found in IS elements and represents an
important mechanism regulating the expression of the
transposases at a translational level [16,45]. Translation
starts at the first ORF (orfA) and shifts to the -1 reading
frame at the so-called slippery site and continues in a second overlapping ORF (orfB) resulting in a transframe
ORFAB protein. The predicted frameshift site in ISCaa4
(AAAAAAG) is highly shift-prone in bacteria such as A.
asiaticus that have only a single tRNA Lys (anticodon:
UUU) and lack the tRNA Lys with the anticodon UUC
[45,46]. In ISCaa4 five nucleotides downstream of the
putative slippery site a stem-loop structure is predicted
(ΔG -6.3 kcal/mol) (Additional file 1, Figure S4). Such
stem-loop structures have been shown to be stimulatory
for -1 ribosomal frameshifting [45,46]. Interestingly,
ISCaa4 shows highest amino acid sequence identity (46 to
51%) to uncharacterized IS elements from methanogenic
archaea of the family Methanosarcinaceae; the similarity
to other transposases is lower than 40%. In phylogenetic
trees, ISCaa4 forms a stable monophyletic group with
these archaeal transposases, indicating interdomain horizontal gene transfer between methanogenic archaea and
A. asiaticus (Figure 1, Additional file 1, Figure S5).
ISCaa3

ISCaa3 is present in ten full-length copies in A. asiaticus
and belongs to ISL2 group within the IS5 family (based

on the presence of a typical DDE-motif) whose transposases typically consist of a single ORF [2,16]. The transposase of ISCaa3 however, is encoded by two
overlapping ORFs most likely translated into a 275
amino acid protein by -1 ribosomal frameshifting. In
contrast to other IS elements with canonical slippery
sites like ISCaa4 and ISCaa9, no stimulatory stem-loop
structure possibly enhancing ribosomal frameshifting is
predicted downstream of the slippery site in ISCaa3
(Additional file 1, Figure S6). ISCaa3 shows highest
amino acid sequence identity (57 to 66%) to ISCaa2 and
IS elements found in the intracellular bacteria Orientia
tsutsugamushi, Legionella drancourtii, Regiella insecticola, and Parachlamydia acanthamoebae. In phylogenetic analyses ISCaa2, ISCaa3 and related IS elements
from intracellular bacteria consistently group together in
all treeing methods applied, suggesting horizontal transfer of IS elements between these intracellular bacteria
(Figure 1, Additional file 1, Figure S7). Interestingly, a
number of cyanobacterial IS elements form a sister
group with the ISCaa3-related IS elements.
ISCaa9

ISCaa9 is an 881 bp IS element which is present in 15
almost identical copies (the differences occur only in the
inverted repeats). ISCaa9 belongs to the IS5 family and
shows highest amino acid sequence identity (45%) to
ISMac15 from Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A, and
40% amino acid identity to ISWpi1, an IS element found
in many Wolbachia strains [47,48]. The ISCaa9 transposase is encoded by three consecutive and overlapping
ORFs which are translated into a 253 amino acid protein (Table 2, Additional file 1, Figure S8). We propose
a stop codon read-through to occur at the stop codon
(UGA) at nucleotide positions 263 to 265, which is supported by the presence of the stop codon in all 15
ISCaa9 copies in A. asiaticus, the absence of a stemloop structure indicative of a terminator downstream of
the stop codon, and the observation that UGAA is a
weak stop codon quartet [49,50]. We predict that the

calculated with ARB using the TREE-PUZZLE algorithm are shown: (A) Phylogenetic relationships of ISCaa3 (IS5 family) and (B) ISCaa4 (IS1
family). Transposase sequences consisting of two ORFs were merged into a single ORF. Filled Black circles indicate nodes which are supported

stop codon is recoded into tryptophane (UGG), a common feature of UGAA stop codon quartets [50]. In
addition, the majority of ISCaa9-related transposases
encodes a tryptophane at the position of the stop codon
read-through in ISCaa9 (Additional file 1, Figure S9).
We predict a translational -1 frameshifting at a slippery
site (AAAAAAG) between orfB and orfC (Additional file
1, Figure S7). Five nucleotides downstream of this putative slippery site, a stem-loop structure (ΔG -12.6 kcal/
mol) is predicted in ISCaa9 (Additional file 1, Figure
S8). The ISCaa9 transposase contains a DDE-motif,
which is most similar to the IS1031 group within the
IS5 family, the transposases of this group however, are
usually encoded by a single ORF [2].
ISCaa10

ISCaa10 is with a length of 527 bp a very short IS element that contains a single ORF encoding a 147 amino
acid transposase. It belongs to the IS200/IS605 family
and IS200 group of IS elements comprising the shortest
known transposases [2]. Members of the IS200 group
are unusual IS elements because their transposases do
not contain the DDE-motif found in most transposases.
Instead they belong to the Y1 transposases with a catalytic tyrosine residue and a conserved HuH motif (consisting of a histidine, a hydrophobic amino acid, and
another histidine) [51,52]. Interestingly, this motif is present only in two of seven ISCaa10 copies; in the others,
the second histidine is replaced by tyrosine, which

might render these copies nonfunctional. Other unusual
features of IS200 IS elements, that are also found in
ISCaa10, are the absence of both direct and terminal
inverted repeats and the presence of secondary structures leading to low transcriptional and transpositional
activity [51-53]. For example, IS200 from Salmonella
typhimurium LT2 forms two stem-loop structures: The
first is a transcriptional repressor terminating impinging
transcripts, the second acts at the translational level and
occludes the ribosome binding site [53]. Similarly, a
stem-loop structure is predicted ten nucleotides
upstream of the start codon of the ISCaa10 transposase
and close to the 3’ end of ISCaa10 (ΔG -13 kcal/mol
and -20.3 kcal/mol, respectively). ISCaa10 shows highest
amino acid sequence identity (76%) to (uncharacterized)
IS200 family transposases from Xenorhabdus nematophila (GenBank accession no: YP_003712757).
Unclassified IS elements

Twenty-five transposase genes could not be assigned to
either of the 16 A. asiaticus IS elements under the criteria applied here. Among these unclassified full-length
transposases two transposases belong to the IS110
family (Aasi_1379 and Aasi_1284); and to the Tn3
family (Aasi_0096, Aasi_0545); one belongs to the IS3
family (probably consisting of the two consecutive ORFs
Aasi_1748 and Aasi_0907); and two belong to the
YhgA-like family of putative transposases (Aasi_0894,
Aasi_1306; PFAM-family PF04754).

Conservation of IS elements among different A. asiaticus
strains

In order to analyze whether the IS elements found in the
genome of A. asiaticus 5a2 are also present in closely
related A. asiaticus strains, we performed PCR using primers targeting the 13 most abundant IS elements (Additional file 2, Table S1) with genomic DNA from A.
asiaticus strain EIDS3 [35] as well as from two novel A.
asiaticus isolates, A. asiaticus US1 and A. asiaticus WR.
These strains show 98.9%, 99.2%, and 98.5% 16S rRNA
sequence similarity to A. asiaticus 5a2, respectively, corresponding to strain and species level diversity, respectively. Six out of the 13 IS elements analyzed here were
detected in all four A. asiaticus isolates. Cloning and
sequencing of PCR products obtained from A. asiaticus
EIDS3 revealed nucleic and amino acid sequence identities to consensus sequences of the A. asiaticus 5a2 IS elements of 87% to 98% (Table 3). The lack of PCR
products for some IS elements indicates either the
absence of these IS elements in the investigated A. asiaticus strains or a low degree of conservation and hence the
absence of or mismatches with the primer target sites.
Transcription but lack of transpositional activity of the A.
asiaticus IS elements

The large copy number and the high degree of conservation of some IS elements identified in the A. asiaticus

5a2 genome might indicate that they are transpositionally active. To investigate this, we first asked whether
the IS elements are transcribed during intracellular
replication of A. asiaticus in its amoeba host. Using
reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, we analyzed the transcription of those 13 IS elements that are present in at
least three copies in the genome (ISCaa2 to ISCaa12,
ISCaa15 and ISCaa16). The detection of transcripts of
all 13 IS elements demonstrates that at least one copy
each is actively transcribed (Figure 2). Next, we used
Southern hybridizations to check for chromosomal rearrangements resulting from transposition events
[12,14,54]. We analyzed the same 13 IS elements for
which we could show transcription and compared DNA
from the same A. asiaticus culture isolated in November
2006 and in July 2009, respectively, a period of 984
days. We could not detect differences in the banding
pattern indicative for chromosomal rearrangements in
Southern hybridizations for any of the IS elements
tested (Figure 3).
Contiguous transcription of IS elements and their
downstream genes

Some of the A. asiaticus IS elements are in close proximity to their downstream genes (with distances less
than 50 bp). As previous reports have shown that IS elements can influence the transcription of neighboring

Figure 2 Transcription of IS elements during intracellular growth of A. asiaticus 5a2 in its Acanthamoeba host. Transcription of 13
selected A. asiaticus IS elements was analyzed with reverse transcriptase PCR. Whole RNA from the Acanthamoeba host harboring A. asiaticus
was transcribed into cDNA and subsequently used for PCR. (A) Reverse transcriptase PCR reactions. Lanes 1: cDNA; lanes 2: positive control,

genes [17-21], we investigated whether contiguous transcripts between A. asiaticus IS elements and downstream genes occur. We analyzed ten selected loci
where IS elements and their downstream genes are
encoded on the same strand and have the same orientation (Figure 4). Using RT-PCR we could show contiguous transcripts of the investigated IS elements with their
downstream genes at 9 out of 10 analyzed loci (Figure
5). We performed two control experiments in order to
exclude that the observed transcripts from RT-PCR
derive from unspecific background noise transcriptional
read-through. One control targeted an unlikely contiguous transcript between two genes located on different
strands and oriented in opposite directions (Aasi_1200/
1201, Figure 4). We could not detect transcripts in this
control reaction (Figure 5), indicating that the observed
transcripts from the nine loci of IS elements and their
downstream genes are above unspecific read-through
transcription. This is further supported by a second,
semi-quantitative control experiment in which we compared RT-PCR products (using the same conditions)
from contiguous transcripts between IS elements and
their downstream genes with the products from RTPCR reactions targeting only the downstream genes

(Additional file 1, Figure S10). In all cases the obtained
bands were of similar intensity, providing further evidence that the observed contiguous transcripts are
above unspecific transcriptional read-through.

Discussion
Mobile genetic elements such as IS elements move
within and between genomes. Owing to its intracellular
lifestyle in free-living amoebae A. asiaticus is, however,
largely shielded from other bacteria. Although horizontal
gene transfer seems unlikely to occur under these circumstances, previous studies proposed that amoebae
may serve as hot spots for horizontal gene transfer
among intracellular bacteria [34,55], and according to
the ‘intracellular arena’ hypothesis genetic material may
move in and out of communities of obligate intracellular
bacteria that co-infect the same intracellular host environment [23]. We identified four IS elements in A. asiaticus that were likely involved in horizontal gene
transfer although the direction of the transfer cannot be
inferred (ISCaa2, ISCaa3, ISCaa4, ISCaa12; Figure 1,
Additional file 1, Figure S5, S7). Three of these IS elements group with IS elements from several other intracellular bacteria related to rickettsiae, legionellae and

Figure 3 Analysis of transpositional activity of the most abundant IS elements of A. asiaticus 5a2. Transposition of IS elements was
analyzed with Southern hybridizations using IS element-specific probes and DNA purified from the same A. asiaticus 5a2 culture in November
2006 and July 2009, respectively. DNA was digested with Eco32I (except for ISCaa2, where HindIII was used). Each visible band corresponds to at
least one IS element copy on the respective DNA fragment, as the restriction endonucleases do not cut within the IS elements. IS elements are
indicated above each hybridization; lanes 1: DNA isolated November 2006; lanes 2: DNA isolated July 2009. The absence of changes in the
banding patterns between both time points indicates that no (major) chromosomal rearrangements due to IS element transposition has
occurred.

chlamydiae, and consistent with previous findings it is
conceivable that amoebae or other protozoa served as a
common habitat for these microbes. One IS element of
A. asiaticus is most closely related to IS elements found
in free-living methanogenic archaea (Methanosarcinaceae). Anoxic aquatic sediments, where free-living amoebae and methanogenic archaea can be found, might
represent a possible shared habitat facilitating horizontal
gene transfer [56-58]. Horizontal gene transfer of IS elements between distantly related organisms is rather rare
[59]. Hence the discovery of related IS elements in three
different bacterial phyla (Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria,
Chlamydiae) and the Archaea might be surprising.
However, a recent study based on the analysis of 800
bacterial and archaeal genomes showed that although
the majority of horizontal gene transfer events occur
between closely related organisms there is a considerable number of large-distance horizontal gene transfer
events [60]. Our observations expand our view on the

extent of horizontal gene transfer of IS elements among
distantly related microbes, and they provide a glimpse
into past interactions of A. asiaticus with other
microbes during its evolutionary history.
Several lines of evidence point to an ancient origin of
many IS elements in A. asiaticus. First, ISCaa4, ISCaa6,
ISCaa11, and ISCaa16, which together make up 46% of
all full-length A. asiaticus IS elements, show a remarkably low degree of sequence conservation among their
different copies (Table 2). This is in contrast to high
sequence similarities expected if IS elements have
entered a genome and spread only recently [4,61]. Second, the high number (n = 143) of truncated IS element
copies suggests that these IS elements have been present
in the A. asiaticus genome for extended time periods
during which they disintegrated slowly. Third, the GCcontent of the A. asiaticus IS elements (37.3% on average, range: 31.9 to 40.7%) is similar to the overall GC
content of the A. asiaticus genome (35.0%). This

Figure 4 Genomic organization of selected A. asiaticus IS elements and their downstream genes. IS elements are shown as dark grey
pentagons; downstream genes as light grey pentagons; inverted repeats are represented by vertical black bars. The distance between IS
elements and downstream genes is indicated. Reverse transcriptase PCR was used to test for contiguous transcription (Figure 5); the size of the
expected PCR products are indicated as horizontal black lines below each locus. Panels (A) to (J) show the organization of IS elements and their
downstream genes. Panels (K) and (L) show the genomic organization of genes used for control reactions in the reverse transcriptase PCR
experiments. Aasi_1200 and Aasi_1201 are located in opposite direction on different strands and served as negative control; Aasi_0308 and
Aasi_0309 representing the groEL/groES operon served as positive control. An asterisk (*) indicates genes which are not drawn to scale (due to
their length). Further details on the genomic organization of the analyzed loci and the downstream genes (including locus_tags of the IS
elements) are available in Additional file 2, Table S3.

suggests that considerable time has elapsed to allow the
base composition of the IS elements to adapt towards
the general base composition of the A. asiaticus genome
[62]. Finally, at least six IS elements are conserved
among four different A. asiaticus strains, some of which
show a relatively high divergence (Table 3). Taking into
account that our PCR based screening likely underestimates the actual number of shared IS elements (due to
mismatches at the primer binding sites in more diverged
homologs), this indicates that many - if not most - A.
asiaticus IS elements were already present in the last
common ancestor of the A. asiaticus strains investigated
here. Taken together, there is compelling evidence that
the IS elements have been residing in the A. asiaticus
genome for considerable evolutionary time periods.
We noted previously that the A. asiaticus genome
shows a GC skew pattern typical for most bacterial

genomes with two major shifts at the origin and terminus of replication and only few local deviations, which
are indicative of recent genome rearrangements [34].
This is remarkable because with the exception of Lactobacillus helveticus DPC 4571 and Shigella sonnei Ss046
(whose genomes contain significantly lower percentages
of IS elements than A. asiaticus; Additional file 1, Figures S1, S2)[27,63], all other bacteria with high numbers
of IS elements do not show such a regular genomic GC
skew pattern (Additional file 1, Figure S11). Thus,
despite of the high number of IS elements, the A. asiaticus genome has not been reshuffled extensively recently,
which indicates that most IS elements are transpositionally inactive and also that recombination events between
highly similar IS element copies have not occurred.
A mechanism by which apparently inactive, non-functional IS elements can be maintained in bacterial

Figure 5 Contiguous transcription of A. asiaticus IS elements with their downstream genes. Transcription was analyzed with reverse
transcriptase PCR. Whole RNA from the Acanthamoeba host and A. asiaticus 5a2 was transcribed into cDNA and subsequently used for PCR.
Genomic organization of the tested loci and the expected sizes of the PCR products are shown in Figure 4. Locus_tags are indicated above the
gel images; lanes 1: cDNA; lanes 2: positive control, genomic DNA; lanes 3: negative control, no nucleic acids added. Contiguous transcription
was demonstrated for all tested loci except for the IS element Aasi_0897 (ISCaa16) and its downstream gene Aasi_1745. The genes Aasi_1200/
1201 were used as negative control (as they are located on different DNA strands and have opposing orientation). The groEL/groES operon
(Aasi_0308/0309) was used as a positive control. All experiments were performed in three biological independent replicates.

genomes is gene conversion, which was described
recently for the genome of Wolbachia wBm, a mutualistic symbiont of the nematode Brugia malayi whose genome contains a number of highly similar IS element
copies rendered non-functional by multiple stop codons
and frame shifts [64,65]. In contrast to Wolbachia wBm,
A. asiaticus still encodes intact copies of each IS element, and many IS elements show relatively high
sequence divergence (Table 2). In addition, the transposase genes of different non-functional IS element copies
show variable pseudogenization states. This largely rules
out gene conversion as the main mechanism for maintenance of IS elements in A. asiaticus.
Rather unexpectedly, we detected transcription of 13
A. asiaticus 5a2 IS elements during intracellular growth
in amoebae (Figure 2). Generally, IS elements are
among the lowest expressed genes due to their potentially detrimental effects on the host genome
[16,61,66-70]. For several A. asiaticus IS elements
(ISCaa2, ISCaa9, ISCaa10, ISCaa14, ISCaa15; data not
shown) stable hairpin structures within the first 50 bp

of the IS elements are predicted, which might interfere
with expression both at the transcriptional and the
translational level, thus controlling the activity of these
IS elements. In addition, evidence for programmed
translational frameshifting, another regulatory mechanism, can be found in six A. asiaticus IS elements (Table
2). Translational frameshifting acts at the level of translation elongation between two consecutive (and partially
overlapping) open reading frames where the ribosome
slides one basepair up- or downstream at a so-called
slippery site [16,45,66]. For several IS elements of A.
asiaticus, the occurrence of frameshifting is supported
by the presence of a canonical slippery site, of stimulatory secondary structures downstream of the slippery
site and, most importantly, the merged amino acid
sequences of the IS elements transposase ORFs show
more significant Blast hits than the single ORFs alone
(data not shown). In summary, transcription of several
IS elements occurs in A. asiaticus, but there is evidence
that many IS elements are tightly regulated both at the
transcriptional and the translational level.

Schmitz-Esser et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:270

Southern hybridizations demonstrated the absence of
major transposition events and genome rearrangements
for A. asiaticus during a time period of 984 days (Figure
3). With an estimated generation time of Acanthamoeba
sp. 5a2 infected with A. asiaticus of 19 h (data not
shown), this time period corresponds to approximately
1200 generations of the Acanthamoeba host. Although
the generation time of A. asiaticus is unknown, it must
be shorter than that of its amoeba host (due to the high
number of symbionts per amoeba cell [35,37]). The analyzed time period thus corresponds to considerably more
than 1200 A. asiaticus generations. For E. coli and Lactococcus lactis, the first IS element-mediated genomic
changes (insertions, deletions, duplications) occurred
already after 400 to 500 generations [12-15]. This indicates that the time period monitored in our study should
be sufficient to detect IS element-mediated genomic rearrangements. However, in contrast to our experiment, in
these studies bacterial cultures were exposed to environmental stress conditions with respect to nutrient availability, temperature, or oxygen, facilitating adaptive
changes. Although no genome rearrangements were
observed for A. asiaticus, we cannot exclude the possibility that transposition events occurred in individual A.
asiaticus cells which subsequently became not fixed at
the population level and would thus be undetectable by
our experimental approach. However, Southern blot is a
highly sensitive method [71], and we have estimated that
we should be able to monitor changes in Southern blot
patterns in subpopulations consisting of only a few to a
few hundred of amoeba host cells (Additional file 2,
Table S2). Taking into account typical densities of
Acanthamoeba sp. 5a2 infected with A. asiaticus during
in vitro cultivation of 105 up to 107 cells/ml, the sensitivity of our assay should thus be sufficient to detect variations even in very small subpopulations. The IS elements
in A. asiaticus are therefore most likely transpositional
inactive. Their abundance is explained by transpositional activity in the evolutionary past of A. asiaticus,
and while still being transcriptionally active, most IS
elements are transpositionally inactive in extant A. asiaticus. In addition to a tight transcriptional and (post-)
translational control there are several other conceivable
explanations for this observation. For example, A. asiaticus might lack host factors required for transposition
activity of IS elements although most of those are specific for certain IS elements; they act at different steps
and cellular processes and their exact role in transposition is still largely unclear [16,66,72]. Alternatively, the
small, reduced genome of A. asiaticus, which is highly
adapted to the intracellular life style and optimized for
host cell interactions, might not allow for major rearrangements as most transposition events would be deleterious rendering the cell nonviable.

Page 11 of 16

One reason why some IS elements were retained in
the A. asiaticus genome despite of the apparent lack of
transpositional activity might be their influence on the
transcription of downstream genes. Indeed, we could
show contiguous transcripts of IS elements with their
downstream genes at 9 out of 10 tested loci (Figure 4,
Figure 5). In some cases, the distance between the IS
element and the start codon of the downstream gene is
too short to include known Bacteroidetes Shine-Dalgarno sequences, which are located at -33 and -7 bp
relative to the transcription initiation site [73,74].
Expression of the respective downstream genes might
thus depend on promoter sequences located within the
upstream IS element (e.g. in the inverted repeats), a feature often found in IS elements [16,66], or on the endogenous promoter of the IS element. In other cases the
distance between the analyzed IS elements and their
downstream genes was larger (up to 300 bp). Similar
polycistronic mRNAs starting from IS elements including downstream genes have been described recently for
two IS elements in Francisella tularensis [17] and in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis IS6110 [21]. It is striking
that many of the genes whose transcription is affected
by the presence of IS elements in A. asiaticus likely play
an important role (Additional file 2, Table S3). For
example, Aasi_1844 is an uncharacterized membrane
protein conserved among most Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi; Aasi_1118 contains six TPR/SEL1 repeats, eukaryotic domains that can be involved in host cell interaction
[75], and Aasi_0380 is a ferritin homolog involved in
iron storage. Furthermore, a genomic organization of IS
elements and downstream genes similar to the loci analyzed in this study was found in 44 other regions on the
A. asiaticus genome (data not shown), suggesting that
contiguous transcripts between IS elements and downstream genes are even more widespread and represent a
more general feature of A. asiaticus.
Genome reduction is an important process during the
adaptation of bacteria to an obligate intracellular life
style, and IS elements are considered to be important in
this process [2,8]. The genome of A. asiaticus is only
moderately reduced compared to other obligate intracellular bacteria [41,42]. Its genome size is with 1.9 Mbp
notably larger than that of other related symbionts in
the Bacteroidetes (0.2 to 1.1 Mbp), but smaller than
those of free-living relatives (2.2 to 9.1 Mbp, Additional
file 1, Figure S12). The genome of A. asiaticus thus
represents a transitional stage in genome reduction. We
argue that the IS elements in the A. asiaticus genome
are evolutionary remnants. They have been present in
the A. asiaticus genome for extended time periods and
reflect the organism’s evolutionary history. The IS elements proliferated and were important during the adaptation of A. asiaticus to the intracellular life style, but

Schmitz-Esser et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:270
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/270

they became increasingly redundant. The A. asiaticus
genome thus represents a snapshot of a bacterial genome which was shaped by the activity of IS elements
but whose IS elements are largely inactive and in the
process of further degradation at the present stage.

Conclusion
Analysis and characterization of the A. asiaticus IS elements provides evidence for an extremely IS elementrich genome, which seems to be evolutionary surprisingly stable - a feature not found in other IS elementrich genomes. The presence of contiguous transcripts
between IS elements and their downstream genes indicates that these IS elements influence the transcription
of their downstream genes, most of which likely play an
important role for A. asiaticus. Proliferation of IS elements in the evolutionary past of A. asiaticus might
thus have been an important process during the adaptation of A. asiaticus to an intracellular life style in which
its genome was shaped by their activity.
Methods
Sequence analyses

The genome sequence of A. asiaticus 5a2 has recently
been determined and analyzed [34] and is available at
GenBank under accession no. CP001102. For identification of IS elements we first compiled a list of candidate
transposase genes by keyword, PFAM and InterPro
domain search available in the genome annotation software Pedant [76]. We then manually inspected this list
in order to verify the evidence for each gene to encode
a putative transposase. In addition, further transposase
genes were identified by manually analyzing each predicted gene in the A. asiaticus genome (e.g by using
Blast against the NCBI nr dataset (provided by the
annotation software Pedant), Blast against the ISfinder
database http://www-is.biotoul.fr/) In order to classify
the transposases into groups of homologs we performed
Blast (BlastP, BlastN) searches against the A. asiaticus
genome. In order to identify full-length IS elements, the
gene sequences of the transposases and surrounding
genomic regions were aligned and the full-length IS elements were then manually identified based on these
alignments. Partial IS element copies were identified by
BlastN and BlastP searches and alignment of full-length
IS element copies against the A. asiaticus genome.
Inverted repeats were identified with the EMBOSS software palindrome and einverted [77]. Nucleic acid
sequences of IS elements and amino acid sequences of
transposase genes were aligned with MAFFT [78]; alignments were visualized using BOXSHADE http://www.
ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html. For detection
of direct repeats the nucleic acid alignments of the IS
elements and their genomic neighborhood were

Page 12 of 16

searched manually. We grouped and classified IS elements using Blast against the ISfinder website http://
www-is.biotoul.fr/[43] and the following criteria: (i) a
minimum amino acid sequence identity of 30% of the
transposase to described transposases, (ii) the presence
of flanking inverted repeats (exception: IS elements
belonging to family IS110 and IS200/605, which do not
have flanking inverted repeats), and (iii) the presence of
at least two copies in the genome. IS element copies
that shared more than 80% nucleic and amino acid
sequence identity over at least 98% of their length were
considered isoforms. The nomenclature suggested by
the ISFinder website was used for naming of IS elements
http://www-is.biotoul.fr/[43]. mRNA secondary structures were predicted using the Mfold web server [79].
For calculations of phylogenetic relationships of the
transposases from selected IS elements, the amino acid
sequences of overlapping ORFs were merged resulting
in a single peptide sequence (in the case of IS elements
with predicted ribosomal frameshifting), aligned with
MAFFT [78] and imported into ARB [80]. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed with the Phylip maximum parsimony, distance matrix (Fitch), ProML (using the JTT
amino acid replacement model) methods and the TREEPUZZLE algorithm (using the VT model of amino acid
substitution) [81,82] implemented in ARB. Maximum
parsimony bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000
resamplings. A filter considering only those alignment
positions that were conserved in at least 10% of all
sequences (resulting in a total number of 274 and 228
alignment columns for ISCaa3 and ISCaa4, respectively)
was used for all treeing calculations. For each IS element analyzed, the overall tree topology between the
different treeing methods applied was consistent, thus
only trees calculated using the TREE-PUZZLE algorithm
are shown.
Cultivation and isolation of amoebae

Amoebae harboring A. asiaticus 5a2 (ATCC no. PRA228) and amoebae harboring A. asiaticus EIDS3 (ATCC
no. PRA-221) were maintained as adherent culture in 25
cm 2 tissue culture flasks containing 10 ml peptoneyeast-glucose medium (PYG: 20 g/l proteose peptone, 2
g/l yeast extract, 90 mM glucose, 4 mM MgSO4*7H2O,
3.4 mM C6H5Na3O7*2H2O, 2.5 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM
Na2 HPO 4*2H 2O, 51 μM Fe(NH 4) 2(SO4 )2 *6H 2O). Cultures were incubated at 27°C and passaged at confluency
by 1:10 dilution of the culture every five to ten days.
Amoebae harboring A. asiaticus WR and amoebae harboring A. asiaticus US1 were isolated from soil and lake
sediment (Alkaline lake “Unterer Stinker”, Burgenland,
Austria) samples, respectively, using non-nutrient agar
plates seeded with live or heat-inactivated Escherichia
coli as described previously [83]. Both isolates were

Schmitz-Esser et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:270
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/270

cultivated as described above using modified PYNFH (10
g/l bacteriological peptone, 10 g/l yeast extract, 1 g/l
yeast nucleic acid, 15 mg/l folic acid, 1 mg/l hemin, 2.6
mM KH2PO4, 2,8 mM Na2HPO4*2H2O).
DNA isolation

Amoebae harboring A. asiaticus 5a2, EIDS3, WR and
US1 were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10
min). The cell pellet was resuspended in 250 μl 1× TE
buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) and subsequently used for high molecular weight DNA isolation
using a modified protocol from Zhou et al. [84]. Briefly,
675 μl DNA extraction buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl, 100
mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium-phosphate, 1.5 M NaCl,
1% (w/v) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB),
200 μg/ml proteinase K, pH 8.0) were added to the cell
pellet and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After addition
of 75 μl 20% (w/v) SDS, the samples were incubated at
65°C for 1 h. To recover the aqueous phase, the lysate
was mixed with an equal volume of chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1, v/v) and centrifuged (11200 × g, 10 min).
Nucleic acids were precipitated with 0.6 volume isopropanol at room temperature for 1 h. The resulting pellet
from centrifugation (16000 × g, 20 min) was washed
with 70% ethanol, centrifuged again (16000 × g, 5 min),
resuspended in ddH2O and stored at -20°C until use.
Transcription analysis

Amoebae harboring A. asiaticus 5a2 were harvested by
centrifugation (7000 × g, 3 min, 27°C). The resulting
cell pellet was resuspended in 750 μl TRIzol (Invitrogen
Life Technologies), transferred to a Lysing Matrix A
tube (MP Biomedicals) and homogenized using a
BIO101/Savant FastPrep FP120 instrument (speed: 4.5
m/sec, 30 sec). RNA was extracted by phase separation,
precipitation, washing and redissolving according to the
recommendations of the manufacturer (TRIzol, Invitrogen Life Technologies). Remaining DNA was removed
using the TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion). After DNase
treatment RNA was resuspended in ddH 2 O DEPC and
stored at -80°C until use. The absence of DNA contamination in the DNase-treated RNA was verified by performing a control PCR with 42 cycles using primers
targeting the 16S rRNA gene of A. asiaticus 5a2 (Additional file 2,Table S1). DNA-free total RNA (containing
host and symbiont RNA) was used to synthesize cDNA
using the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Fermentas) according to the recommendations of the
manufacturer. cDNA was subsequently used as template
in standard PCR reactions (35 cycles and annealing temperatures according to the optimal conditions for the
primers listed in Additional file 2, Table S1). Negative
controls (no cDNA added) and positive controls (genomic DNA) were included in all PCR reactions.

Amplification products were sequenced to ensure that
amplification was specific. All experiments were performed in biologically independent triplicates.
PCR screening for IS elements in different A. asiaticus
strains

A standard PCR cycling program with 35 cycles at low
stringency (annealing temperature 45°C) with primers
specific for different A. asiaticus 5a2 IS elements was
used for the detection of IS elements in the A. asiaticus
strains EIDS3, WR and US1 (see Additional file 2, Table
S1 for primer sequences). Negative (no DNA added)
and positive controls (genomic DNA from A. asiaticus
5a2) were included in all PCR reactions. The amplified
fragments from A. asiaticus EIDS3 were cloned using
the TOPO TA cloning kit and cloning vector pCRII
(Invitrogen Life Technologies). Nucleotide sequences of
the cloned DNA fragments were determined on an ABI
3130 XL genetic analyzer using the BigDye Terminator
kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems).
Southern hybridizations

Southern hybridization was performed using a modified
protocol based on Sambrook et al. [71]. Two μg DNA
(containing host amoeba and A. asiaticus DNA) were
digested with Eco32I for all investigated IS elements,
except for ISCaa2, for which DNA was digested with
HindIII and subsequently separated on a 0.7% TAE
agarose gel (4°C, 17 h, 30 V). The gel was depurinated
for 10 min in 0.25 M HCl, denaturated for 30 min in
1.5 M NaCl/0.5 M NaOH and neutralized for 30 min in
1.5 M NaCl/1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Between each of
these steps the gel was briefly rinsed in ddH2O. DNA
was transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes (GE
Healthcare) with a vacuum transfer system and 20× SSC
(3M NaCl, 0.3M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) as transfer buffer for 30 min. After immobilizing the DNA by UV
cross-linking (120000 μJ cm -2 ), the membrane was
briefly rinsed in ddH2O. Pre-hybridization was carried
out for 2 h at 42°C in hybridization buffer (containing
50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche),
0.1% N-lauroyl sarcosyl sodium salt, 0.02% SDS (v/v)) in
a rotation hybridization chamber as the following steps.
The blot was hybridized with digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled
probes (synthesized using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis
Kit, Roche; each probe was specific for a single IS element; see Additional file 2, Table S1) and hybridization
buffer over night at 42°C. The membrane was washed
twice for 15 min each with 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 25°C,
and twice with 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 60°C for 15 min,
followed by 2 min with DIG washing buffer (0.5 M
maleic acid, 0.75 M NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20, pH 7.5) at
25°C, 30 min with buffer 2 (0.5 M maleic acid, 0.75 M
NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20, 20% blocking reagent) at 25°C, 30

min with buffer 2 and Anti-Digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments (1:10000) at 25°C, twice for 15 min with DIG
washing buffer at 25°C and finally for 5 min in 100 mM
Tris/100 mM NaCl/50 mM MgCl 2 (pH 9.5) at 25°C.
The membrane was swayed for 1 min in 1% CSPD solution (Roche) and subsequently exposed to Amersham
Hyperfilm™ ECL (GE Healthcare).
Amplification of 16S and 18S rRNA genes

Oligonucleotide primers targeting 16S rRNA or 18S
rRNA gene signature regions were used for PCR to
obtain near full-length bacterial 16S rRNA or amoeba
18S rRNA gene fragments of the novel isolates Acanthamoeba sp. WR (containing A. asiaticus WR) and
Acanthamoeba sp. US1 (containing A. asiaticus US1);
see Additional file 2, Table S1. Nucleotide sequences of
DNA fragments were determined on an ABI 3130 XL
genetic analyzer using the BigDye Terminator kit v3.1
(Applied Biosystems).
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

Obtained nucleotide sequences of IS elements of A.
asiaticus EIDS3 and 16S and 18S rRNA genes of the
isolates Acanthamoeba sp. WR (containing A. asiaticus
WR) and Acanthamoeba sp. US1 (containing A. asiaticus US1) were submitted to EMBL/DDBJ/GenBank
under accession numbers HM159367 to HM159370.
The sequences of the A. asiaticus IS elements were
deposited at EMBL/DDBJ/GenBank under accession
numbers HM159371 to HM159380 and the ISFinder
database http://www-is.biotoul.fr/[43].
