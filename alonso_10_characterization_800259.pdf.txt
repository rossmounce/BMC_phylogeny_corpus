Abstract
Background: The Beijing lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is causing concern due to its global distribution and its
involvement in severe outbreaks. Studies focused on this lineage are mainly restricted to geographical settings where
its prevalence is high, whereas those in other areas are scarce. In this study, we analyze Beijing isolates in the
Mediterranean area, where this lineage is not prevalent and is mainly associated with immigrant cases.
Results: Only 1% (N = 26) of the isolates from two population-based studies in Spain corresponded to Beijing strains,
most of which were pan-susceptible and from Peruvian and Ecuadorian patients. Restriction fragment length
polymorphism typing with the insertion sequence IS6110 identified three small clusters (2-3 cases). Mycobacterial
interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat typing (MIRU-15) offered low discriminatory power,
requiring the introduction of five additional loci. A selection of the Beijing isolates identified in the Spanish sample,
together with a sample of Beijing strains from Italy, to broaden the analysis context in the Mediterranean area, were
assayed in an infection model with THP-1 cells. A wide range of intracellular growth rates was observed with only two
isolates showing an increased intracellular replication, in both cases associated with contained production of TNF-α.
No correlation was observed between virulence and the Beijing phylogenetic group, clustered/orphan status, or
resistance. The Beijing strain responsible for extensive spread on Gran Canaria Island was also identified in Madrid, but
did not lead to secondary cases and did not show high infectivity in the infection model.
Conclusions: The Beijing lineage in our area is a non-homogeneous family, with only certain highly virulent
representatives. The specific characterization of Beijing isolates in different settings could help us to accurately identify
the virulent representatives before making general assumptions about this lineage.
Background
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the main infectious causes of
death worldwide, with more than 9 million new cases of
active disease every year and nearly 2 million deaths [1].
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the causative agent
of most TB cases, and its ability to spread and the outcome of infection depend on epidemiological, host, and
bacterial factors [2].
The MTB genome is highly conserved, but several large
sequence polymorphisms defining different genetically
related lineages have been identified. Among them, the
Beijing family can be identified rapidly and reliably by
several genetic features. These include a characteristic

spoligotype with exclusive deletion of spacers 1-34 (the
so-called RD207 deletion) [3], an intact open reading
frame in the pks15/1 gene [4], and deletion of the
genomic region RD105, which define the Beijing family as
a separate lineage within MTB [5].
The Beijing lineage is causing major concern worldwide
[6,7] because its worldwide spread and involvement in
several TB outbreaks, some of them involving drug-resistant strains [8]. The Beijing lineage is generally considered to be associated with drug-resistance, although this
association has not been found in all geographic settings
[7,8]. The proportion of Beijing strains differs, being low
in Western Europe, although a slight increase in the number of Beijing strains has been detected over time [6]. The
presence of this lineage in the population has been associated with the recent increase in the number of TB cases

among immigrants observed in several areas, including
the Mediterranean [8,9].
The wide distribution of Beijing strains suggests that
members of this phylogenetic lineage are better adapted
to infect and cause disease in humans than other MTB
families, and there are reports indicating that Beijing
strains show higher replication rates and more virulent
phenotypes than other MTB lineages in both in vitro and
in vivo models [10,11]. The infective success of this lineage seems to be associated with its effect on the immune
response, in that it can control the release of the macrophage-derived cytokines that play a central role in
directing the immune response towards a non-protective
Th2 phenotype [12,13].
The incidence of the Beijing lineage in Spain is low,
although in recent years it has been increasing due to
immigration [9]. The profile of nationalities of the immigrants infected by Beijing isolates differs from that
observed in other countries, and South American cases
are the most common. The impact of the importation of
Beijing isolates to Spain was described in the 1990s on
Gran Canaria Island, where an extensive outbreak involving this lineage was detected after a Beijing isolate was
identified in an immigrant [14].
Studies analyzing the Beijing lineage are scarce in the
Mediterranean area [15,16]. We explored whether specific genotypic and phenotypic features could be found
for the Beijing strains isolated in a context where this
clade is not endemic, but imported by immigrants whose
origin (mainly Peru and Ecuador) is different from that
found in other settings.

Results
Identification and characterization of Beijing isolates

Of the 2391 isolates analyzed in the Spanish sample, 26
(1.09%) were identified as members of the Beijing lineage
according to the criteria reported in the Methods section.
In particular, nineteen showed deletion of the spacers 134 and the characteristic hybridization pattern of spacers
35-43, and the remaining seven corresponded to variant
"Beijing-like" spoligotypes.
In order to verify the spoligotyping-based identification
of Beijing strains and to refine the genetic characterization, the pks15/1 gene and the RD105, RD181, RD150,
and RD142 were analyzed. The pks15/1 gene, which is
generally considered a marker for M. tuberculosis strains
of Asian origin [4,17], was sequenced in all 26 isolates in
order to rule out deletions, and in all cases this gene was
intact (Table 1). The genomic deletion RD105, which
phylogenetically defines the Beijing family [5], was found
in all 26 (Table 1). On the basis of the polymorphisms
associated with genomic deletions RD181, RD150, and
RD142, previously defined for the Beijing lineage by Reed

et al[18], all of the isolates belonged to phylogenetic
group 3 except one, which belonged to group 4.
By origin, 22 of the 26 isolates were from foreign-born
cases (84.6%) of nine different nationalities, the most frequent being Peruvians and Ecuadorians (42%). The
remaining four Beijing isolates corresponded to autochthonous cases (Table 1).
The drug susceptibility tests showed that 23 of the 26
isolates were pan-susceptible, two were isoniazid-resistant, and one was multidrug-resistant (Table 1).
Genotyping analysis

The IS6110-RFLP analysis revealed 21 different genotypes (9-22 IS6110 copies). Seven isolates (26.9%) were
grouped in two clusters of three and four cases each.
Nineteen isolates (73.1%) were unclustered and considered orphan cases (Figure 1A). The isolates involved in
cluster 2 (C2) shared an identical IS6110-RFLP pattern
with those involved in the Gran Canaria outbreak [14].
The MIRU-15 analysis identified 18 different genotypes
among the Beijing isolates. Thirteen isolates (50%) were
grouped in five clusters of two or three cases. The
remaining isolates corresponded to orphan cases (Figure
1B). If we compare RFLP and MIRU-15 data, it is noteworthy that two representatives of cluster 1 (C1), defined
by RFLP, were split by MIRU-15, and three of the clusters
defined by MIRU-15 grouped isolates that had been considered orphan by RFLP. Only the C2 cluster defined by
RFLP remained intact after MIRU analysis. Regarding the
isolates clustered in C2, which shared the RFLP pattern
with the isolate involved in the Gran Canaria outbreak,
we also pursued to compare the MIRU-15 data. With this
aim, a selection of Gran Canaria outbreak isolates, sharing also the susceptibility pattern with those form
Madrid, were analyzed and an identical MIRU-15 type
was shared by the representatives from Madrid and Gran
Canaria.
After observing the low discrimination of MIRU-15,
five new VNTR loci (QUB11a, QUB3232, QUB18,
VNTR3820, and VNTR4120) were added; they were all
selected due to their high discriminatory values in different studies focused on Beijing isolates [19,20]. The discriminatory power of this MIRU-15+5 set was markedly
higher than that of MIRU-15, and was even higher than
that of RFLP. Twenty-five different genotypes were identified from the 26 isolates analyzed. Four of the five
MIRU-15 clusters were sub-divided by MIRU-15+5 (Figure 1C), and only the C1 cluster defined by MIRU-15
remained intact.

ability according to different features: nationality of the
cases (6 nationalities), drug susceptibility (2 resistant and
6 susceptible), number of IS6110 copies (9-22) and phylogenetic group (groups 3 and 4) (Table 2). The strain
responsible for the outbreak on Gran Canaria Island was
also included (isolate no. 1). To widen the geographic setting to the Mediterranean area and to increase both the
number of Beijing representatives analyzed and the number of isolates involved in clusters, we included to the
Spanish Beijing representatives, eight additional Beijing
isolates (9-16) from Tuscany, Italy (Table 2). As controls,
we included the virulent reference strain H37Rv and a
non-Beijing representative orphan strain.
A wide range of intracellular growth rates was detected
among the Beijing isolates assayed (Figure 2). Two isolates showed the highest intracellular growth rates, which
differed significantly (P < 0.05) from the others. There
were no significant differences in growth rate among the
remaining isolates, including control strain H37Rv and
the non-Beijing orphan strain. No correlation was found
between the epidemiological status of the isolates (clustered/unclustered) and the intracellular growth rates. The
isolate responsible for the outbreak on Gran Canaria
Island was included, although it did not show increased
intracellular replication.
ii) Cytokine production

We studied the immunoregulatory profile of cytokines
secreted in THP-1 cells infected with six isolates selected
as representatives of the different intracellular growth
rates in the previous assay, including H37Rv. In all cases,
the infection by MTB increased the TNF-α production
compared to the values observed in the non-infected control. The TNF-α production dynamics along the infection
differed among the isolates analyzed. Four isolates

induced a peak level of TNF-α at day 1 after infection,
and this was followed by a rapid decrease in secretion
(Figure 3A). The other two isolates were those that had
the highest growth rates in the THP-1 assay. In these isolates, TNF-α production followed a different pattern,
namely, production of TNF-α was contained from the
start of infection, and was significantly lower than that
induced by the remaining isolates at day 1 after infection.
TNF-α levels in these isolates continued to decrease
throughout the infection (Figure 3A).
The IL-10 secretion profiles in THP-1 cells infected
with all the Beijing isolates were similar to the noninfected controls at early stages of infection; IL-10 production was not detected up to day 1 after infection (Figure 3B). However, from this point, the IL-10 production
dynamics differed among the isolates analyzed with peak
levels occurring at day 4. IL-10 levels subsequently
decreased in all of the isolates except two, in which production increased until infection resolved (Figure 3B).
These two isolates corresponded to those which contained production of TNF-α and showed the highest
growth rates in THP-1-infected cells. Thus, a correlation
was found between intracellular replication, production
of TNF-α, and the immunoregulatory response through
IL-10 in THP-1 infected cells.
Both of the strains with a differential behaviour in the
THP-1 model corresponded to South American orphan
cases: one belonged to phylogenetic group 4 and was isoniazid-resistant, and the other belonged to phylogenetic
group 3 and was pan-susceptible and displayed the lowest
number of IS6110 copies (nine).
The Beijing isolate responsible for the TB outbreak on
Gran Canaria Island was not distinguishable from other
isolates. It had an average intracellular growth rate and

assignation of alleles. In these cases we could only estimate that the number of repetitions was higher than 20 (> 20). When we observed products
differing in size in groups of isolates with more than 20 repetitions, we sub-labeled them > 20a, > 20b, > 20c and > 20d.

did not control TNF-α levels at early stages of the infection.
When we considered the cluster/orphan status of the
isolates, analysis of intracelullar growth rates and
cytokine expression profiles did not reveal a correlation
between cluster/orphan status and infective behaviour in
the THP-1 model.

Discussion
The worldwide distribution of the Beijing lineage has
been well documented [6-8], being this genotype highly
prevalent (70-80% in total isolates) in East Asia (China,

Korea, Japan, etc). However, the proportion of Beijing
strains in Western Europe is low. In two countries of the
Mediterranean area, Italy and Spain, the marked increase
in the number of immigrants in recent years has led to an
increase in the numbers of TB cases that can be attributed to imported strains. In Madrid (Spain) and Tuscany
(Italy) during the period 2004-2006, slightly more than
40% of all cases of TB were detected in immigrants
[15,21]. We characterized the genotypic and phenotypic
features of the Beijing lineage in a setting where it is not
frequently isolated and where it is mostly detected in
immigrant cases.

* Isolates from Tuscany.

Spoligotyping, sequencing of pks15/1, and analysis of
the presence of the RD105 region revealed a low representativeness of this lineage in our population, as previously described in Central and Western Europe [8,9,22].
These studies also showed that Beijing strains in our area
are mainly found in immigrants (ie, around 85% of our
isolates were from immigrants, mostly Peruvians and
Ecuadorians). This is consistent with the results of studies
which report that the Beijing lineage was also imported to
Europe via South America [23,24].
The Beijing lineage is generally considered to be associated with drug-resistant phenotypes, although this may
not be true for all geographic settings [7,8] and most of
the Beijing strains in our study were susceptible. In fact,
drug-resistant but also pan-susceptible strains have been
associated with TB outbreaks [25] and it has recently
been proposed that mainly atypical variants of Beijing
strains are those linked to resistance [26].
IS6110-RFLP based genotyping was performed in order
to establish a molecular epidemiological profile for the
Beijing strains in the Spanish sample. Nineteen representative patterns of the Beijing genotype have been
reported, and most of them have a high IS6110 copy
number (15-26) [6,27]. The wider range of IS6110 copy
numbers-- 9 to 22--alerts to the existence of Beijing iso-

lates without a high number of IS6110 copies. The RFLP
patterns of a 5-year population based sample enabled us
to define two clusters including 7 of the 26 Beijing isolates
of the study (26.9%); the first cluster contained three
Ecuadorian immigrants and an autochthonous case, and
the second contained three autochthonous patients. The
members of the latter group shared an identical IS6110RFLP pattern with the one involved in the TB outbreak
on Gran Canaria Island in the 1990s [14]. In our study,
MIRU-15 was less discriminatory (13 of 26 isolates in five
clusters) than RFLP. Recently, new hypervariable loci
have been evaluated to increase the discriminatory
capacity of the 15-loci VNTR typing method in the Beijing lineage [19,20,28,29]. A selection of them together
with the 15-loci set, increased the discriminatory power
to values even higher than those of RFLP.
The distribution of the Beijing lineage in different geographic areas and its ability to disseminate suggest that
this phylogenetic lineage is better adapted to infect and
cause TB in humans than other genetic lineages of MTB.
It has been associated with high virulence and rapid
growth in both in vitro and in vivo infection models
[10,11,30]. These features are considered to be behind the
success of Beijing strains, which is a consequence of their
control over the immune response [12].

Figure 2 Intracellular growth rate in differentiated THP-1 cells. Cells were infected with 16 Beijing isolates, the control strain H37Rv, and a nonBeijing strain (C). Intracellular growth was expressed as the growth rate (Y Axis), ie, the slope of the function of log10 CFU values during the infection
period. CFUs were determined 3 hours after infection and at days 1, 4, and 7. Results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the three independent experiments per strain. Asterisks indicate isolates with significantly higher intracellular growth rates (P < 0.05).

We attempted to characterize the infective features of
the Beijing isolates in our sample by assaying a selection
of isolates. We enriched the sample to be assayed in the
infectivity model with additional Beijing isolates from
another setting (Tuscany, Italy) in the Mediterranean area
that had features, namely clustered strains, which were
underrepresented in our area. As the Beijing lineage was
the only genotype showing a steady expansion in Tuscany
with frequent clustering (involving immigrants and
autochthonous patients) [15], we included several isolates
from this area in our sample.
To characterize the infective features of the Beijing isolates, an in vitro infection model using differentiated
THP-1 cells was applied, which has been considered a
good macrophage model [31-35] and which validity was
proved after demonstrating that THP-1 cells differentiated with PMA express CD14, an antigen considered a
marker for macrophages [36]. This model is also a good
alternative for evaluation of the infectivity of MTB
[10,37,38].
Although the number of isolates in our study is small to
draw general conclusions, an interesting finding was that
the isolates showed heterogeneous infective behaviour,
with a wide range of intracellular growth rates. Two iso-

lates showed the highest growth rates and stood out significantly from the others.
We tested cytokine production in the in vitro infections, focusing on TNF-α and IL-10 as the main representatives of the Th-1 and Th-2 responses. In our model, the
levels of cytokines always increased after infection, indicating that the assay, although activated by the addition of
PMA, is not saturated. It allowed a measuring window to
identify different infective behaviours among the strains
analyzed. Indeed, it allowed us to efficiently measure the
increases, in or maintenance or contention of cytokine
production after infection caused by specific strains,
which was our aim. We observed that infection with the
isolates with the highest intracellular replication levels
elicited the lowest TNF-α levels in THP-1-infected cells.
At early stages of infection, these isolates induced significantly lower TNF-α production than the other isolates,
and maintained this level until the end of infection, thus
indicating failure to correctly induce the cytokine-dependent Th1-type protective immune response. Other
authors have also observed a wide range of intracellular
replication rates among Beijing isolates and an inverse
association between intracellular replication levels and
TNF-α production [30,39].

Figure 3 Cytokine production by differentiated THP-1 cells infected with strains representatives of different intracellular growth rates. Levels of TNF-α (panel A) and IL-10 (panel B) were determined in culture supernatants 3 hours after infection and at days 1, 4, and 7. Data are expressed
as the mean ± standard error of three independent experiments per strain. Asterisks indicate significantly different (P < 0.05) cytokine production. Control: Non-infected control cells.

Furthermore, low-virulence strains are associated with
a more vigorous immune response with high levels of
type 1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-12) [10,13,40]. These
data suggest that the infective advantage of Beijing strains
should not be considered as an intrinsic feature of the lin-

eage, but as a characteristic of certain representatives.
These findings are highly relevant, as the outcome of the
infection is related to the ability of MTB to regulate the
induction of cytokines that are essential for the development of an efficient immune response [41]. As shown by

Alonso et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:151
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/151

our study and others, the virulent Beijing representatives
induced high production of proinflammatory cytokines,
which is quickly controlled, thus decreasing their levels
and giving rise to a more effective infection. Phenol glycolipid (PGL), has recently been proposed as a virulence
factor in Beijing strains [12]. This molecule can inhibit
the release of key inflammatory effector molecules in
vitro and has been considered responsible for the hypervirulent phenotype of Beijing strains, both in murine and
rabbit infection models [12,42]. The different sub-groups
of the Beijing lineage have recently been shown to contain different percentages of PGL-producing strains [18];
therefore, other factors could determine the hypervirulence of certain Beijing strains. As most of the isolates in
our study belonged to sub-group 3, it was not possible to
explore in depth the relationships between infectivity and
PGL production. However, isolates belonging to subgroup 3 displayed different intracellular growth rates.
The only representative belonging to sub-group 4 (with
the highest percentage of PGL-producing strains) showed
the highest intracellular replication levels. Therefore,
according to Reed et al [18], it would be very interesting
to evaluate PGL production in these isolates to determine
whether their hypervirulent phenotype (high intracellular
replication rates, low production of TNF-α) could correlate with the synthesis of this complex glycolipid.
Some studies have analyzed the relationship between
intracellular growth and transmissibility [40,43], and concluded that the extensive spread of an MTB strain correlated with its high capacity to replicate, which is
considered a marker of virulence. We studied intracellular replication levels of clustered and orphan strains, and
observed no significant differences in growth rates or
TNF-α production. In addition, the two isolates with the
highest growth rates were orphan isolates. Therefore, virulence features are not always associated with clustered/
orphan status.
Clustered/orphan status could be a consequence of
bacterial factors, although epidemiological features must
also be taken into consideration. In this sense, it is interesting to mention our findings for the isolates corresponding to the strains involved in the Gran Canaria
outbreak. The three patients infected with this strain had
lived on Gran Canaria Island before arriving in Madrid,
and there was a three-year interval between each diagnosis. This cluster seems more likely to be a coincidental
finding in Madrid of three cases infected on Gran
Canaria Island than a recent transmission in Madrid.
Other than these cases, no secondary cases involving this
genotype have been found since the last one (2006),
which is the opposite of the explosive spread of the same
strain on Gran Canaria Island. The lack of secondary
cases by this genotype after its first detection in Madrid

Page 8 of 12

could suggest that epidemiological features more than
bacteriological features (virulence, transmissibility, infectivity) could have been responsible for the Gran Canaria
outbreak. Consistent with this explanation, the representative of this cluster did not show any replicative advantage or control over the immune response, and, therefore,
this strain should not be considered especially virulent or
transmissible.

Conclusions
In summary, we provide an outline of the genotypic and
infective features of Beijing isolates identified in Spain
and Italy. We show the low representativeness of this lineage in the study population, the association between the
lineage and immigration, and the lack of association with
resistant phenotypes. The infective profile of the Beijing
isolates was markedly heterogeneous, suggesting the existence of certain highly virulent representatives in a nonhomogeneous lineage. In our sample, we did not find a
correlation between virulence and phylogenetic group or
resistance. A correlation between in vitro infectivity and
the clustered/orphan status of the isolates was not found,
which could reflect the complex process that infection/
transmission is with a potential role for patient-related
factors (economical, social, epidemiological aspects). The
Beijing strain which was extensively transmitted on Gran
Canaria Island displayed a completely different epidemiological behaviour in Madrid, and did not show a highly
infective phenotype in vitro. Various factors, both bacterial and epidemiological, seem to be behind the success
and higher prevalence of Beijing strains compared with
the other genetic lineages of MTB. The specific role that
these factors could play in different contexts must be clarified before establishing general assumptions about the
Beijing lineage.
Methods
MTB strains

Clinical samples were processed according to standard
methods and grown in Lowenstein-Jensen slants (Becton
Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland, USA). During the period
2002-2007, we received for genotyping a total of 2391
MTB cultures from two population-based studies in
Spain between 2004 and 2008 [44,45]: 1872 isolates were
from five urban areas in Madrid (6,081,689 inhabitants)
and 519 were from Almeria (south-eastern Spain 646,633
inhabitants).
We also included, exclusively for the infectivity assays,
eight Beijing isolates from a previous study performed
from 2002 to 2004 in Tuscany (central Italy, 3,600,000
inhabitants) [15].

Identification and genetic characterization of Beijing
strains

Spoligotyping was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Isogen, Netherlands). The Beijing
genotype was assigned on the basis of the spoligotype. In
particular, isolates with spoligotype patterns characterized by deletion of spacers 1-34 were defined as "typical"
Beijing, whereas isolates with additional deletion of one
or more of the last nine spacers were defined Beijing-like
according to the criteria of the international database
SpolDB4 [22].
To confirm this identification of Beijing isolates by spoligotyping and also to refine the genetic characterization
of the Beijing isolates, the pks15/1 gene and thegenomic
deletions RD105, RD181, RD150, and RD142 were analyzed.
An intact pks15/1 gene has been reported to be a
marker of the Beijing lineage [4,17], whereas a 7-bp deletion has been found for non-Beijing isolates. We purified
DNA using standardized methods [46] to verify the
marker by amplification and DNA sequencing [4] using
an ABI-PRISM 310 sequencer (Lab Centraal B.V., Haarlem, NL).
The genomic deletions RD105, RD181, RD150, and
RD142, which sub-classify the Beijing lineage, were identified by PCR using primers and conditions described
elsewhere [5].
Molecular typing methods

DNA extraction and restriction fragment length polymorphism typing with the insertion sequence IS6110
(IS6110-RFLP) were performed according to standard
methods [46]. Computer-assisted analysis of IS6110 fingerprints was carried out using Bionumerics 5.1 software
(Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium). Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat
typing (MIRU-VNTR) was performed by amplifying the
15 MIRU-VNTR loci as described elsewhere [47], with
some modifications [48]. The number of repetitions in
each locus was calculated by applying the corresponding
conversion tables (P. Supply, personal communication).
The MIRU type was defined after combining the results
for the 15 loci in the following order: MIRU4, MIRU26,
MIRU40, MIRU10, MIRU16, MIRU31, Mtub04, ETRC,
ETRA, Mtub30, Mtub39, QUB4156, QUB11b, Mtub21,
and QUB26.
Five additional loci were added to the MIRU15 set:
QUB11a and QUB18 [19,20], QUB3232 [19], and
VNTR3820 and VNTR4120 [28,49], which were selected
based on the high polymorphism found for the Beijing
clade when applying these loci [28]. They were all amplified using simplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
primers described elsewhere [19,28,50]. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in the amplification reac-

Page 9 of 12

tions for VNTR3820 and VNTR4120 (8%) and QUB11a,
QUB18, and QUB3232 (12%). The sizes of the PCR products were calculated after electrophoresis in 2% agarose
gels (MS8 agarose; Pronadisa, Madrid, Spain) for 17.5
hours at 45 V (for products under 800 bp) or 22 hours (for
larger products). Assignation of alleles was based on table
sizes kindly provided by Dr. Tomotada Iwamoto (Microbiology Dep., Kobe Health Institute, Japan) and on data
published elsewhere [19,20,28,49].
In certain cases, the large size for some products
obtained at loci QUB11a, VNTR3820, and QUB3232 did
not allow accurate assignation of alleles. In these cases,
we only could estimate that the number of repetitions
was higher than 20 (> 20). When we observed products
differing in size in groups of isolates with more than 20
repetitions, we sub-labeled them > 20a, > 20b, > 20c and
> 20d.
For the analysis by MIRU-VNTR of the isolates sharing
RFLP pattern with the strain involved in the Gran
Canaria outbreak (analyzed in Hospital Miguel Servet,
Zaragoza), only the 15-loci format was applied and not
the expanded set of five additional loci, because these
have not been validated for interlaboratory comparisons
due to low interlaboratory reproducibility.
Cluster analysis

Genotypic patterns were analyzed using Bionumerics 4.6
(Applied Maths, Belgium). Dendrograms were generated
using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic
averages (UPGMA) and the Dice coefficient or the categorical coefficient for IS6110-RFLP and MIRU-15 analysis, respectively. RFLP clusters and orphan status were
defined for isolates sharing identical fingerprints after
analyzing the patterns for the 2391 MTB isolates from the
population-based sample. MIRU clusters were defined
for isolates sharing identical patterns.
Susceptibility test

Susceptibility testing with isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was performed using
the mycobacterial growth indicator SIRE system (Becton
Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland, USA).
Cell cultures

The human promonocytic cell line THP-1 was obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (TIB-202;
Manassas, Virginia, USA). Cell cultures were maintained
in modified RPMI 1640 + L-glutamine (Gibco, Grand
Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY), 10 mM HEPES, and 50 μg/ml
gentamicin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Cultures were
maintained at 7-10 × 105 cells/ml and incubated at 37°C
in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. In order to ensure
that we are working with a macrophage model, THP-1

Alonso et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:151

cells were differentiated to adherent macrophages by the
addition of 200 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 3 days at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Cell infection

Cells were infected as described elsewhere [10], with
slight modifications. Briefly, differentiated THP-1 cells
seeded in 24-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates were
washed and the medium was replaced to remove PMA
and gentamicin 2 hours before the addition of bacteria.
Cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 2-10
bacteria per cell and incubated for 3 hours at 37°C in 5%
CO2. After incubation, monolayers were thoroughly
washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove extracellular bacteria and fresh medium was added. To evaluate the bacterial growth, supernatants were aspirated and
monolayers were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P40 (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at 3 hours and days 1,
4, and 7 after infection. Serial 10-fold dilutions of cellular
lysates were plated on Middlebrook 7 H11 plates and
incubated for 3 weeks at 37°C in 5% CO2, and colonies
were counted. Intracellular growth was expressed as the
growth rate, which is the slope of the function of log10
CFU values throughout the infection period (3 hours and
days 1, 4, and 7). Three or more independent experiments
were performed for each assayed strain.
Cytokine analysis

Culture supernatants from control and infected THP-1
cells were harvested after 3 hours and on days 1, 4, and 7,
frozen at -70°C, and assayed using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences, Lincoln Park, NJ)
to measure levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
and interleukin 10 (IL-10).
Statistical analysis

Three independent experiments were performed per
strain. The means and standard errors were determined
for each measurement in both intracellular growth and
cytokine production. One-way analysis of variance with
repetitive measures was used to determine P values,
which were adjusted using the Bonferroni method. All
the comparisons were carried out using the program
SPSS 17.0.
