Abstract
Background: Sessile bivalves of the genus Mytilus are suspension feeders relatively tolerant to a wide range of
environmental changes, used as sentinels in ecotoxicological investigations and marketed worldwide as seafood.
Mortality events caused by infective agents and parasites apparently occur less in mussels than in other bivalves
but the molecular basis of such evidence is unknown. The arrangement of Mytibase, interactive catalogue of 7,112
transcripts of M. galloprovincialis, offered us the opportunity to look for gene sequences relevant to the host
defences, in particular the innate immunity related genes.
Results: We have explored and described the Mytibase sequence clusters and singletons having a putative role in
recognition, intracellular signalling, and neutralization of potential pathogens in M. galloprovincialis. Automatically
assisted searches of protein signatures and manually cured sequence analysis confirmed the molecular diversity of
recognition/effector molecules such as the antimicrobial peptides and many carbohydrate binding proteins.
Molecular motifs identifying complement C1q, C-type lectins and fibrinogen-like transcripts emerged as the most
abundant in the Mytibase collection whereas, conversely, sequence motifs denoting the regulatory cytokine MIF
and cytokine-related transcripts represent singular and unexpected findings. Using a cross-search strategy, 1,820
putatively immune-related sequences were selected to design oligonucleotide probes and define a species-specific
Immunochip (DNA microarray). The Immunochip performance was tested with hemolymph RNAs from mussels
injected with Vibrio splendidus at 3 and 48 hours post-treatment. A total of 143 and 262 differentially expressed
genes exemplify the early and late hemocyte response of the Vibrio-challenged mussels, respectively, with AMP
trends confirmed by qPCR and clear modulation of interrelated signalling pathways.
Conclusions: The Mytibase collection is rich in gene transcripts modulated in response to antigenic stimuli and
represents an interesting window for looking at the mussel immunome (transcriptomes mediating the mussel
response to non-self or abnormal antigens). On this basis, we have defined a new microarray platform, a mussel
Immunochip, as a flexible tool for the experimental validation of immune-candidate sequences, and tested its
performance on Vibrio-activated mussel hemocytes. The microarray platform and related expression data can be
regarded as a step forward in the study of the adaptive response of the Mytilus species to an evolving microbial
world.

essential for mining very large data sets [1,2]. Whenever
complete transcript sequences and gene structure information are not available, misidentification and erroneous annotation can easily occur. In fact, the greatest
challenge in biology today is the precise delineation of
genes and protein networks able to explain physiological
and pathological phenotypes [3-5].

innate immunity, especially those living in fluctuating
marine systems [6-9]. Filter-feeder bivalves such as mussels, oysters and clams typically harbour a community of
commensal, opportunistic and pathogenic organisms
composed of endoparasites such as Mytilicola and Urastoma, protozoans such as Bonamia, Haplosporidium
Marteilia, Perkinsus spp., bacteria of the genus Nocardia
and Vibrio, Herpes and enteric viruses. Microbial species
take part in the biogeochemical cycles and some of
them are expected to play a probiotic role in their typical hosts. The common rod-shaped Vibrios (> 60 Gram
negative heterotrophic species) well exemplify associations ranging from mutualistic to pathogenic in aquatic
animals [10-12]. V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, V.
vulnificus and other nine Vibrio species cause mild or
severe syndromes in humans while other halophilic
Vibrios occurring in brackish and marine habitats can
greatly affect molluscs, crustaceans and fish (e.g. V.
tapetis, V. alginolyticus, V. splendidus, V. pectenicida, V.
harvey, V. penaeicida, V. anguillarum). Often triggered
by environmental factors such as temperature, salinity
or pollutants, elements of such microbiota may invade
and colonize the host and eventually lead to disease outbreaks and mortality, especially in larvae, spat and juveniles of natural and farmed bivalves [13-15]. Compared
to oyster and clams, no apparent mortality and fewer
pathologies have been reported in mussels [16,17]. It is
more likely that Mytilus spp. are a reservoir of infective
agents for aquatic organisms and humans, since, for
instance, they tolerate significant amounts of V. alginolyticus, V. parahemolyticus and other vibrios [18]. In fact,
comparative and advanced understanding of the earlyinduced host responses may sustain and improve the
aquaculture production in many coastal regions worldwide [17,19].
Immunocompetent mollusc cells, at least the circulating hemocytes, and a variety of molecular effectors provide a rapid and robust line of defence against potential
pathogens. Once activated by the interaction between
pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and
pathogen recognition receptors (PRR), such cells display
chemotactic and chemokinetic reactions, participate in
encapsulation and melanization, carry out phagocytic or
lytic killing. These events are made possible by the concerted action of transmembrane and soluble lectins,
Toll-like and virus sensing receptors, hydrolytic enzymes
and proteolytic reaction cascades, short-lived cytotoxic
by-products and antimicrobial peptides (AMP) [20-25].
According to morphological observations and flow cytometry, bivalve hemocytes are heterogeneous and very
dynamic cells of 7-10 μm size which can be classified
into large granulocytes (eosinophilic) most active in phagocytosis and ROS production, large hyalinocytes with
intermediate activity, small non-phagocytic semigranular

Page 2 of 19

cells (basophilic) and the less abundant blast-like hyalinocytes [26-28]. As Mytilus hemocytes respond to interleukin 1 (IL 1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and to
opioid peptides (the endogenous messengers between
the nervous and the immune system) they may be part
of an ancient monokine-like network [29,30]. Also relevant to the use of mussels as biosensors of coastal pollution [31] the interdependence of cell processes
modulated by chemical contaminants and infective
agents requires additional study [32,33].
The sequence data available for bivalve species are
slowly but steadily growing, especially through EST collections [4,8,34]. A set of 1,714 cDNA probes of M. galloprovincialis was arranged to investigate the
transcriptional signatures of pollutants [35] but more
work has subsequently been devoted to EST sequencing,
also using technologies which provide very large
amounts of short reads more difficult to annotate [36].
A double set of 5’ and 3’ ESTs of M. californianus,
42,354 in total, was used to investigate the influence of
the tidal cycle on mussel physiology [7]. As a result of
laboratory treatments performed with environmental
pollutants, bacterial antigens and viral-like polynucleotides, 18,788 high-quality ESTs of M. galloprovincialis
are now organized in a structured collection of 7,112
transcript sequences [37], named Mytibase and including most of the ESTs publicly available for the Mediterranean mussel (19,575 ESTs at Oct 2010).
In the absence of genomic information, this knowledge base offered us the unique opportunity to outline
the available mussel immunome and develop a new
microarray platform. In the following sections we present the most relevant Mytibase clusters and singletons
related to mussel immunity and the validation of a species-specific Immunochip with hemocyte samples of
Vibrio-injected mussels.

Results and Discussion
Identification of immune-related Mytibase sequences

The Mytibase descriptions report BLAST similarity
searches, structured Gene Ontology vocabulary (GO)
and identifiable protein features of the Interpro database
(IPR) [38]. The latter, in particular, supported the characterization of unknown or poorly predicted sequences,
and integrated the meaning of a substantial fraction of
the mussel transcripts.
Not surprisingly, the Mytibase sequences (MGCs) are
often defined by multiple IPRs with the notable exception of 588 ESTs codifying the mussel AMP that could
only be recognized by similarity to prototype sequences
of mytilin, myticin, mytimycin and defensin. Table 1
illustrates in decreasing order of abundance the first 15
of 1753 redundant IPRs present in the MGCs and the
known mussel AMP. The protein motifs represented in

Mytibase point to cell processes which are not restricted
to the immune system as only 15% of the total IPRs
directly refer to immunity. Nevertheless, the abundance
of transcripts identifying AMP precursors or including
domains such as Complement C1q (IPR001073) and the
related Tumour Necrosis Factor-like (IPR008983), Ctype lectin (IPR001304) and Fibrinogen, alpha/beta/
gamma chain, C-terminal globular subdomain
(IPR002181/IPR014716) definitely confirm that the
Mytibase EST collection is particularly rich in immunorelated transcripts. Conversely, about 41% of the listed
IPRs are exclusive of single clusters and singletons, with
uncommon and intriguing protein motifs exemplified by
IPR001398 (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, 4
ESTs in 3 clusters) and IPR012916 (RED-like protein, 6
EST in 1 cluster). The IPRs mentioned are easily found
in Mytibase as Interpro key words.
Since the genome of M. galloprovincialis is not available and sequence data are still limited, we applied a
multiple search strategy to identify in Mytibase a relevant set of immune-related sequences. A low-stringency
tBLASTn search allowed the extraction of 309 mussel
sequences related to immune system processes
(GO:0002376) and 1,021 sequences similar to those

indexed in the multispecies catalogue ImmunomeBase
(download permitted by C. Ortutay et al., Finland).
Searches based on key words and manual screening
yielded an additional 973 inputs and supported the final
selection of 1820 mussel sequences, which can be
regarded as an operational set and the starting point for
the progressive authentication of immune-related candidates by transcriptional analyses and gene studies. Additional file 1 describes the selected MGCs and updates
their functional annotation whereas the following paragraphs illustrate by abundance and putative function the
most relevant ones to the mussel immunity.
Transcripts identifying antimicrobial peptides

Almost ubiquitous in the living species but highly
diverse in structure and biological activity, host defence
peptides interact with negatively charged cell membranes, lead to microbe killing and modulate both the
innate and inducible antimicrobial responses in mammals [39]. Four groups of AMP are known in mussels:
defensins, mytilins myticins and mytimycins [40,41].
The cationic and amphipatic structure of the mature
peptides is stabilized by 4 intrachain disulphide bonds (6
in mytimycin) according to a unifying tridimensional
motif [42]. Mytibase includes the full length precursor
sequences of all the mussel AMP with some new variants: they are reported as mature peptide sequences in
Figure 1.
Myticins are subdivided in A, B (96 aminoacid precursor) and the polymorphic type C (100 aminoacid precursor) [43]. Searching tBLASTn similarities to prototype
sequences, we identified in Mytibase many precursors of
myticin C (A7DWV6, 124 ESTs), myticin A (P82103, 88
ESTs) and myticin B (P82102, 55 ESTs). Robust nonsynonymous SNPs analysis allowed us to split the
sequence cluster of myticin A into 5 subgroups named
A, A2, A3, A4 and A5, confirmed by 23, 38, 2, 21 and 4
sequence traces of high-quality, respectively (the latter
three groups present indels in the 3’-UTR region).
Mytilin precursors are more heterogeneous in length
ranging between 97 and 105 residues, and can be easily
differentiated from the myticin precursors due to a different cysteine pattern. Similarly, we identified mytilin A
(P81612, 5 ESTs), mytilin B (Q9Y0B1, 111 ESTs), mytilin C (Q5XWD7, 127 ESTs), mytilin D (B3VT96, 9
ESTs). We could also extend the sequence of Mytilin
G1 (MGC00423, 14 ESTs) [41] and we propose
MGC00659 (11 ESTs) as Mytilin F, namely a new mytilin component.
The defensin precursors identified in Mytibase are
MGD1 (P80571, 20 ESTs), MGD2b (Q9U6U0, 5 ESTs)
and three new sequences proposed as MGD3, MGD4,
and MGD5. Due to the presence of a stop codon just
after the 8th conserved cystein, defensins MGD3 and

mussel AMP family includes new sequences indicated by an asterisk (*). Identical and similar (PAM250) residues are reported in dark and light
grey, respectively.

MGD4 are shorter than the others whereas MGD5 is
the longest with 97 aminoacid residues.
Only one Mytibase EST (Mg_Nor01_39J03) corresponds to the mytimycin described in M. edulis
(P81614) and four other sequences grouped from 4, 4, 4
and 3 ESTs may be regarded as new mytimycin variants.
Curiously, two of these ESTs (Mg_Nor01_12C12,
Mg_Nor01_39B01) display a long insertion in the 5’
UTR and a signal peptide with maximal cleavage probabilities between positions 18-24 from ATG. cDNAs
normalization was essential to reveal the rare mytimycin
ESTs whereas the other more abundant AMP sequences
can be easily and mainly attributed to hemocyte libraries
prepared from immunostimulated Italian and Spanish
mussels, without evidence of preferential geographical
distribution (see in Mytibase the EST composition of
Hae01-Hae05 and NOR01 libraries). All mussel AMP
(27 clusters) and one hydramacin-like transcript
(MGC2887) have been included in the Immunochip.
Transcripts containing C1q and Tumour Necrosis Factorlike domains

The overlapping C1q (IPR001073) and TNF-like
(IPR008983) domains have probably evolved by divergence from an ancient recognition molecule whose
diversification could have started with urochordates and
cephalocordates [44,45]. The large family of proteins
with a C1q domain support many biological processes,

from complement activation, modulatory immune functions, apoptotic cell clearance to coagulation, embryonic
development and tissue homeostasis [46].
In mammals, the 18 polypeptide chains composing the
complement subcomponent C1q are characterized by a
short N-terminal region, a collagen-like Gly/Pro-rich
tract and a C-terminal tulip-like structure of globular
C1q domains (gC1q) also found in ficolins and other
proteins. The C1q binding to immunoglobulins within
immunocomplexes initiates the classic complement cascade and pathogen elimination. In the presence of Ca
ions, the interaction of self and non-self ligands with
charged gC1q residues causes gC1q reorientation and
bending of the collagenous region. The activation signal
is then transmitted to serine protease precursors (C1r,
C1s) which, in turn, promote the proteolytic complement cascade and formation of a membrane attack complex [47]. Overall, the modularity and versatility of
pattern recognition confirm the essential role of gC1q in
both innate and acquired immune responses.
Several MGCs display sequence similarity to C1q,
TNF, precerebellin, collagen and emilin proteins.
Searching the TNF-like domain IPR008983 in Mytibase,
we identified 146 transcripts, most of which are also
characterized by the C1q domain IPR001073. Hidden
Markov model analysis allowed the recognition of 22
additional C1q-containing sequences and the C1q motif
was confirmed by manual validation in all 168 cases,

Venier et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:69

without evidence of a true TNF domain. To illustrate
their molecular diversity, a selection of the most divergent C1q-containing MGCs is reported in Figure 2.
Many of them are similar to a sequence highly
expressed in the mantle of the oyster Pinctada fucata
[48] and some are very abundant, for instance
MGC0284 with 99 out of 109 ESTs originating from
hemocyte cDNAs [49]. In addition to the C-terminal
globular domain, most of the predicted C1q proteins of
M. galloprovincialis (163-293 aminoacid residues) have a
short N-terminal signal peptide but lack central collagen-like repeats; hence, they should represent secreted

Page 5 of 19

gC1q receptor proteins expected to elicit chemotaxis
and pathogen lysis via more ancient complement pathways [50]. The abundance and molecular diversity of the
C1q-containing transcripts of M. galloprovincialis suggest pathogen-induced expansion of lectin-like PRR: the
identification of related gene sequences will allow a
comparison with the 32, 52 and 75 C1q gene models
reported in Homo sapiens, Danio rerio and in the
amphioxus Brachiostoma floridae, respectively [45,51].
The new microarray platform includes 162 of these
mussel transcripts and also a few mussel transcripts
similar to the complement component C3 (MGC07073

total sequences identified in Mytibase. This highly diversified non redundant subset was produced with NCBI BlastClust (-p F -L .5 -b T -S 40).
The cladogram is based on the Neighbor-Joining method (1000 bootstrap replicates). The evolutionary distances were computed by using the
JTT substitution matrix (number of amino acid substitutions for each of the 406 sites).

respectively) and a Membrane attack complex/perforin/
C9 (IPR001862, MGC00636) expected to be involved in
the pathogen lysis.
Additional lectin-like and receptor-related transcripts

Protein-carbohydrate recognition is crucial to many cell
processes and host-pathogen interactions. Lectins are
membrane-associated and soluble proteins with specific
carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) which can
either facilitate mutualistic interactions between host
and microbiota or initiate innate and adaptive immune
responses [52-54]. Acting as recognition receptors, lectins promote opsonization, phagocytosis and the activation of the complement system [25]. Structural and
functional features distinguish eight to fifteen lectin
groups largely related to immunity: C-type, S-type or
glycan-binding galectins, I-type specific to sialic acids
and glycoseaminoglycans also containing an Ig-like fold,
pentraxins, fucolectins, fibrinogen-like lectins, ficolins,
tachylectins and slug agglutinin, chitinase-like lectins,
and orphan lectins. Transmembrane calnexins and soluble calreticulins support trafficking, sorting and maturation of glycoproteins whereas lectins localized in the
plasma membrane or released into the extracellular
matrix and body fluids mediate a broad range of processes including cell adhesion, cell signalling, pathogen
recognition and endocytosis. Compared to more ancient
lectins acting in the quality control of glycoproteins,
extracellular lectins such as ficolins have evolved independently in the vertebrate and invertebrate lineages.
The evolutionary radiation of these molecules

emphasises the importance of the glycan code and lectin-ligand interactions in the immune responses and
apoptotic cell clearance [55,56].
Table 2 summarizes in decreasing abundance the lectin-like sequences identified in Mytibase by searching
archetype lectin domains (IPRs). A total of 148 MGCs
(429 ESTs) share the descriptive term ‘lectin’ as Interpro
key-word. The most abundant and heterogeneous group
refer to C-type lectins (IPR001304) originally named to
reflect the importance of Ca+ in sugar binding. Many
are similar to the nacre protein perlucin from Haliotis
laevigata [57], while others remind of mammalian proteoglycans, type II receptors expressed particularly on
macrophages and dendritic cells. For instance, among
9 MGCs the consensus MGC04167 is the most similar
to the macrophage mannose receptor, protein involved
in the glycoprotein endocytosis and antigen presentation, whereas 13 MGCs display similarity to the human
DC-SIGN CD209 antigen [53]. Regardless of some conserved residues (e.g. cysteine and glycine) the remarkable sequence diversity of the C-type lectins expressed
in mussels confirms them as candidate PRR (Figure 3).
As a matter of fact, many of the Caenorhabditis elegans
proteins containing a C-type lectin domain (278 genes)
support pathogen-specific responses [58].
The second abundant lectin-like group recalls fibrinogen and fibronectin proteins and ficolins. Like the CRD
of the mannose-binding lectins, the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (IPR002181) of ficolins has a bouquetlike structure which binds the carbohydrate residues of
foreign and apoptotic cells (hence, pathogen opsonization,
phagocytosis and clearance of dying cells) or in association with specific serine proteases (SP) initiates the proteolytic complement cascade and pathogen lysis [25,59].

Figure 3 Multiple alignment of 87 Mytibase sequences identified as C-lectins (IPR001304). The SMART consensus terms for the CLECT
domain (SM00034) are shown at the bottom. Four cystein residues are entirely conserved (positions 12, 105, 123 and 138 in the multiple
alignment). Other conserved (75%) residues are W5, A8, L19, W51, G53, G64, W66, W68, W118, D120, I137, C138 and E139. Positions with at least
50% of conservation are also shadowed.

Species-specific expansion of fibrinogen-related proteins
(FREPs) has been reported in the snail Biomphalaria
glabrata and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae [5,60]. In
the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, a protein containing
the fibrinogen-like domain, but devoid of the hemagglutinating activity typical of vertebrate ficolins, acts as

negative regulator of the prophenoloxidase system (proteolitic cascade similar to that of the complement system)
and interferes with the transformation of quinone compounds to melanin [61].
Other MGCs point to galectins (IPR000922), I-type
lectins (IPR013151) able to bind carbohydrate ligands

Venier et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:69
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/69

via immunoglobulin-like domains, GH18 chitinase
enzymes (IPR001223), L-type lectins (IPR005052) entailed
in the intracellular protein sorting and P-type lectins
(IPR009011), transmembrane proteins involved in the
transport of lysosomal enzymes from the Golgi complex
and the cell surface to lysosomes. For instance, chitinases
are glycosyl hydrolases widely expressed from cnidarians
to mammals, able to degrade the polysaccharide b-(1-4)poly-N-acetyl D-glucosamine and confer protection
against chitin-containing pathogens and parasites [62,63].
Mytibase is also rich in sequences with WD-40 repeats
(IPR011046) and Leucin Rich Repeats (LRR, IPR001611).
The modular organization of WD and LRR domains of
vertebrate proteins sustains the diversity and plasticity
of the apoptosome and inflammasome complexes in
response to microbial products and metabolic stress,
with the latter commonly signalled by ROS, nucleic
acids, cathepsin and other molecules released by
damaged cells [64,65]. In detail, the ligand binding to
the carboxy-terminal LRR region of cytosolic receptors
of the NOD-like family (NALPs/NLRs) can trigger
receptor clustering, recruitment and activation of initiating caspases, release of IL-1R and IL18 citokines, inflammation and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis).
Although many MGCs refer to nucleic acid binding
proteins (IPR012677, IPR012340) or RNA/DNA binding
helicases (IPR014021), further study is necessary to
assign them an antiviral function typical of intracellular
NOD-like and RIG-like helicase receptors or some
membrane-bound TLRs [66]. With the possible exception of MGC02873, a Piwi-like singleton suggestive of
silencing and regulative events in germ cells and hematopoietic stem cells, and putative RNA helicases of the
DEAD-box family (IPR014014), we could not identify in
Mytibase the core siRNA machinary Dcr-2, r2d2, AGO2
responsible for antiviral responses in Drosophila [67].
Keeping in mind the 222 and 72 TLR gene models
identified in the genome of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Branchiostoma floridae [51,68], respectively, the
occasional presence in Mytibase of TLR-related
sequences (IPR000157, IPR004075) is disappointing. In
fact, only MGC03952, MGC06978, MGC07535 and few
other LRR-containing sequences display fragmentary
similarity to human, fish and invertebrate TLR proteins.
In the human TLRs, extracellular LRRs are arranged to
recognize specific PAMPs whereas the intracellular Toll/
Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain activates downstream signalling pathways. According to a recent comparative overview, the identification of authentic
invertebrate TLRs cannot rely on the sequence homology and requires functional studies [69].
Present in Mytibase are also putative Ig-like and
MHC-related surface antigens (IPR013783, parent
domain), sequences with a thyroglobulin domain

Page 8 of 19

(IPR000716) typical of Insulin-like Growth factor binding proteins and HLA class II invariant chain, and
G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (IPR000276) involved in
the transduction of various signals and accounting for
about 3% of human genes [70].
Other MGCs are similar to von Willebrand Factor type
C (IPR001007) found in plasma proteins promoting
adhesion and thrombus formation at injured sites, Fasciclin-like proteins (IPR000782), Toll-InterLeukin Receptor
(IPR000157), Speract/scavenger receptor (IPR001190),
receptor-binding alpha macroglobulins (IPR009048),
mannose-6-phosphate receptor (IPR009011) and TNF
receptors (IPR001368: MGC05090, MGC06564).
Transcripts involved in signalling and regulative networks

Not restricted to the innate immunity, cell signalling
against fungal, bacterial and viral antigens occurs in
insects through the Toll, Imd, Jak-STAT and P13K/Akt/
TOR pathways. The first two are similar to the vertebrate TLR/IL and TNF signalling pathways, and interact
with distinct NFkB factors to induce the expression of
AMP and other molecules, whereas the inhibition of the
nutrient signalling P13K/Akt/TOR can restrict viral
replication by cell autophagy and reallocation of the
resources from growth to immune defences [67].
Related to Toll/IL and TNF signalling are MGCs
putatively identifying the LPS-induced TNF alpha factor
or LITAF (IPR006629, 9 MGCs), TNF receptor associated
factor TRAF (IPR008974, 4 MGCs), the adapter molecule
MyD88 (MGC03566, MGC07770), Pellino which is
known to associate with the kinase domain of the Pelle
Ser/Thr kinase (MGC02650), NF_kB_inhibitor Cactus
(MGC03934), a NFkB inhibitor-interacting Ras-like protein (MGC06766) and the transcription factor NFkB/Rel/
Dorsal (IPR000451, IPR011539; MGC05614, MGC07242).
Definitely, many MGCs include the ankyrin repeat
(IPR002110, 50 MGCs) typical of regulatory proteins
but insufficient in itself to provide function recognition.
Conversely, putative mussel kinases and phosphatases
(e.g. IPR000340, IPR002290, IPR008343, IPR015731)
support the existence of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signalling, whereas the EF-hand signature (IPR011992) and putative small G proteins
(IPR003579, IPR003577, IPR005225) denote calcium
regulated pathways. Putative zinc finger proteins
(IPR000315, 49 MGCs), transcription factors bZIPlike (IPR004827), LIM-type (IPR001781), Jun-like
(IPR002112), p53/RUNT-type (IPR012346) and repressors of transcription (IPR011991) reinforce the idea of
multiple signalling pathways in mussels.
Interactions between protein kinase C, FAK and Src
protein tyrosine kinases occur during the integrinmediated spreading of Lymnaea stagnalis haemocytes [71]
and robust intracellular signalling is essential to

Venier et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:69
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/69

cytoskeleton remodelling, cell adhesion and migration of
PAMP-activated haemocytes [26,72,73]. Although more
than 60 MGCs contain a DNA-binding domain and some
of them include the SH2 domain (IPR000980), there is no
proof in Mytibase of a mussel JAK/STAT pathway, the
main signalling system for a wide array of mammalian
cytokines and growth factors. Nevertheless, the remarkable
presence of a mussel Macrophage Migration Inhibitory
Factor (3 MGCs), transcripts recalling Platelet-Derived
Growth Factor (MGC01828, MGC07226), interferoninduced proteins (IPR009311, IPR004911), an interleukin
enhancer binding factor (MGC05350), an interleukin-1receptor-associated kinase (MGC00477) and G-protein
coupled chemokine-like receptors, altogether evoke a regulatory humoral network able to reinforce mussel immunity. Unquestionably, Mytibase does not contain an IL17
homologue, found instead expressed in oyster hemocytes
following bacterial stimulation [74].
Finally, MGCs denoting histone proteins (IPR005819,
IPR009072), deacetylase (IPR000286, IPR003000) and
acetyltransferase (IPR015418) enzymes confirm the
importance of chromatin remodelling and histone modifications in the regulated transcription of effector genes.
Transcripts related to oxidative stress and chaperon
proteins

Scavenging and enzymatic activities protect the living
cells from various stress factors, from endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced for instance by the
mitochondrial respiratory chain to the oxidative burst
consequent to pathogen recognition at the cell surface
[75,76]. Partial or complete coding sequences of M. galloprovincialis super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase,
glutathione transferase, peroxisomal thiolase and polyamine oxidase have been reported [77-80]. In Mytibase,
numerous MGCs putatively identify enzymes such as
amine oxidases, dehydrogenases, peroxidases, mitochondrial oxidases and reductases. In addition to SOD
(IPR001424, IPR001189, 4 MGCs) and glutathione peroxidases (IPR000889, 5 MGCs) many mussel sequences
are featured by the thioredoxin fold/domain (IPR012336,
IPR013766), typical of proteins regulating the redox
state of cellular thiol groups such as the thioredoxin-like
reductases (MGC09082).
Interestingly, more than 30 MGCs indicate heat shock
proteins of different sizes (HSP 20, 40, 70 and 90 Kd)
and related binding factors (MGC06041, MGC03865,
MGC04512), mostly known to be modulated following
immunostimulation [81-83].
Transcripts identifying proteases, protease inhibitors and
proteasome components

Proteases of various subfamilies and related inhibitors
are essential in organism growth and development.

Page 9 of 19

Proteolytic reactions typically occur in the complement,
coagulation and ProPO cascades, during apoptotic cell
death, antimicrobial peptide synthesis and degradation
of pathogen components within the lysosomal, cytosolic
and extracellular compartments.
For instance, the insect clip-domain SP can act as
cofactor or negatively regulate the melanization
response, with a repertoire of 45 and 68 genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti, respectively [5].
Cleavage of viral and host factors operated by granuleassociated SP (granzymes) slows down viral replication
and induces the apoptotic elimination of infected mammalian cells [70]. Caspases of the cysteine protease
family also act in the proteolytic cascade of the apoptosis and, via NFkB signalling, regulate inflammatory
responses in Drosophila [84].
Specific enzyme inhibitors are expected to modulate
the same biological processes but also inhibit pathogen
growth and invasive behaviour. In fact, trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor levels correlate with the plant resistance to pathogens, and in the basal metazoan Hydra
magnipapillata the bactericidal activity of a kazal-type
SP inhibitor possibly compensates the absence of migratory phagocytic cells [85,86].
In Mytibase, as much as 57 and 14 domains denote
proteases/proteinases/peptidases and their inhibitors,
respectively. Many MGCs indicate inherently secreted
serine-type endopeptidases of the chymotrypsin/Hap
family (IPR001254, 18 MGCs), SP inhibitors with Kazallike repeats (IPR002350, 14 MGCs) or BIR repeats
(IPR001370, 12 MGCs), with the latter belonging to the
Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) family [84]. Other MGCs
point to cysteine caspase-like peptidases (IPR002398, 6
MGCs), astacin-like zinc metallopeptidases (IPR001506,
8 MGCs) and related inhibitors (I2, I8, I14/I15 hirudin/
antistatin, I19, I29, I32, serpin and Tissue Inhibitors of
MetalloProteases among others).
More than 60 MGCs denote ubiquitin, ubiquitinrelated and proteasome-related components and give
emphasis to intracellular processes oriented towards the
pathogen elimination [87].
Transcripts identifying lysozyme

Recognized in 1922 as an antibacterial molecule and
abundant in various animal secretions, lyzozyme hydrolyzes 1,4-beta-linkages in peptidoglycan and chitodextrin
structures. In flies and other invertebrates, lysozyme
expression and activity increase after exposure to bacteria, and the species-specific gene number partly
depends on the use of bacteria as food resource [5]. Upregulation of the mussel lysozyme, with increased percentage of hemocytes expressing lysozyme mRNA, was
observed at 2-3 days post-injection of Vibrio anguillarum or Micrococcus lysodeikticus [88] whereas

Venier et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:69
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/69

maximum expression occurred after 3 hours in hemocytes immunostimulated in vitro [75]. In Mytibase, the 8
MGCs denoting lysozymes can mainly be classified in
types C and G: among them, MGC02986 is similar to a
C-type lysozyme described in insects but not yet
reported in molluscs.

Table 3 Total number of differentially expressed genes
(over↑ under↓) in hemocytes sampled at 3 and 48 hours
from mussels injected with live V. splendidus

Owing to the continuous growth of the GenBank/UniProtKB/SwissProt databases, recurrent similarity
searches and manual validation of the emerging similarities guided the progressive selection of 1,820 MGCs to
be confirmed as components of the mussel immunome.
Probes of 54-57 nucleotide length (plus 652 unrelated
human probes) have been designed using the 3’ end
transcript region templates and spotted in four replicates to prepare a new DNA microarray platform,
namely a M. galloprovincialis Immunochip.
Taking advantage of a large immunostimulation trial
conducted in vivo on mussels from three different
European regions [89] we selected and processed hemolymph samples collected at 3 and 48 hours after the
injection of 10 million exponentially growing Vibrio
splendidus cells into the adductor muscle. Total RNA
was purified from two hemolymph pools (N = 10) per
time point, and from paired saline-injected control mussels sampled at 3 and 48 h (N = 40, one unique reference pool). As the amplified Cy3/Cy5-labeled targets
were competitively dye-swap tested on the mussel
Immunochip, the reciprocal hybridizations of a target
pair on quadruplicated probes yielded 8 fluorescence
signals per probe (16 values per time point).
Looking at the total hybridization data set, 21.8% of
the mussel probes gave significant fluorescence (median
fluorescence values averaged per probe resulting above
the background, i.e. average BG*2St.Dev.) with a range
of 13.5-27.7% per individual array and average values of
17.2% and 26.4% lighted spots at 3 and 48 hours,
respectively. These percentages reasonably relate to the
number of differentially expressed genes (143 and 262,
respectively) estimated by permutation from the absolute level and standard deviation of the replicates (SAM
analysis, Table 3 and Additional files 2, 3 and 4). Soon
after the immune stimulation, the over-expressed genes
are consistently more numerous than the underexpressed (106 vs. 37 at 3 h), whereas later in time their
proportion roughly equals (124 and 138 at 48 h). Converting the log2 (test/control) values by the relative fold
change of expression, they range over two orders of
magnitudes from +7.3 to -8.9 (at 3 h) and from + 7.6 to
-9.6 (at 48 h).
Hierarchical clustering of the Immunochip profiles
clearly shows the resemblance between biological

replicates (3.1 - 3.2 and 48.1 - 48.2), greater differences
between the time points of 3 h and 48 h, and interesting
discriminant signals such as those related to LITAF and
IAP-like apoptosis inhibitors (Figure 4). The general
AMP down-regulation detected in the hemocytes of
Vibrio-injected mussels (for instance 4.7-6 fold downregulation of defensin MGD1b at 3-48 h after challenge)
confirms previous qPCR data [89]. Similarly, putative
acute phase response proteins (apextrin) and the macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF cytokine) were
under-expressed. Conversely, probes pointing to Allograft inflammatory factor 1, SOD, small HSP20, plasminogen as well as various recognition receptors and
molecules supporting intracellular signalling (e.g.
MyD88) or cytoskeleton remodelling/motility (e.g. actin,
myosin) were commonly up-regulated (Additional file
4). Compared to the early response, after 2 days we
detected a significant expression of proteases and protease inhibitors, LITAF (TNF signalling) and sequences
suggesting various cell functions (Additional file 3).
In general, no consistent trends could be defined for
the C1q-like and lectin-like molecules. Due to their
abundance and high sequence diversity, further study is
necessary to understand their constitutive and PAMPinduced expression in mussel hemocytes.
Based on the Immunochip hybridization data, the
molecular pathways and gene functions mapping out
the mussel hemocyte response to the Vibrio injection
are modelled in Figure 5. Functionally similar to dendritic cells or macrophages, the mussel hemocytes display a
pleiotropic response to the bacterial attack. Interacting
with bacterial PAMPs, versatile and redundant recognition receptors undergo conformational changes, oligomerization or clustering. The subsequent activation of
cross-talking signal transduction pathways adjusts the
biochemical cell machinery towards the expression of
specific gene sets and key effector molecules (in bold,
on coloured field). Pathogen-induced oxidative burst
and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
also sustain the inflammasome activation and intracellular signalling. Eventually, the endolysosomal and

proteasome systems, secretory pathways and whole cell
behaviour are recruited to achieve the pathogen killing.
Overview of the mussel response to live Vibrio splendidus

Figure 4 Hierarchical clustering of the Immunochip profiles
referring to 3 and 48 h post-injection of live V. splendidus. Two
mussel groups with 8 replicates per time point have been analyzed
(R-package software). Scale of the expression values and probe ID
are indicated. For space reasons, only instructive parts of the
clustered data are reported.

The most ancient defences of the living organisms are
based on neuropeptide and protein hormone receptors,
receptor kinases and PRR (mainly TLRs, lectin-like,
NLRs and RIG-like families) able to signal the danger
and increase the expression of various inflammatory and
effector molecules [90-92]. In view of the most recently
sequenced invertebrate genomes, the pleiotropic innate
immune responses could be described as a coordinated
system of elements rapidly evolving and expanding the
ability for pathogen sensing/targeting, and evolutionary
conserved regulatory factors which finely adjust basic
cell processes and direct the development and performance of the immune cells [5,51,93].
Ancient signalling pathways like those of MAPKs and
NFkB are not exclusive of the immune responses and,
not solved by standard sequence searching, the identification of invertebrate interleukine homologues (or molecules with functions analogous to the specialized
signalling provided in vertebrates by interleukins and
cytokines) makes new exploratory approaches necessary
[9,74,94].
Although the hemolymph cells are fundamental in the
mussel immunity, it is not clear if cells other than
hemocytes contribute to the complex spectrum of rapid
innate responses to potential pathogens. Consistent with
a more general view linking immunity to metabolism
and other body processes, typical immune genes and
proteins should also be expressed in ‘non-immune’ cells,
tissues and organs [2,41,95-97]. For instance, the expression of C1q/TNF-like molecules (MGC0284) has been
detected in various tissues, with hemocytes showing the
greatest levels, and throughout the development of M.
galloprovincialis [49].
Similar to cells of the vertebrate monocyte/macrophage lineage, PAMP-activated immunocytes achieve
pathogen elimination essentially through chemotaxis,
phagocytosis, and cytotoxic processes [30]. In the Mediterranean mussel, agranular hemocytes are cells able to
divide as they show replication-dependent chromosomal
damage [98] whereas the heterogeneous and abundant
granulocytes can be regarded as differentiated cells,
mostly phagocytic and able to release antimicrobial peptides [41]. Accordingly, distinct hemocyte subpopulations appear to respond to potential pathogens with
specific patterns of gene expression [88,99].
In addition to the host response, pathogen-related and
physico-chemical factors are other main determinants of
disease onset and mortality in aquacultured bivalves.

changeable habitats (including the infected hosts)

Figure 5 Modelling the putative transcriptional hemocyte response to the Vibrio injection. The model outlines PRR, interrelated signalling
pathways and cell processes significantly modulated at 3 and 48 h post-treatment. Various bacterial PAMPs and DAMPs are indicated in pink.
The gene functions represented on the Immunochip are indicated in bold according to sequence similarities/identities: framed bold characters
on red, green and yellow fields indicate over-expression, under-expression and heterogeneous trends, respectively, of specific Immunochip
probes at 3 h (left half) and 48 h (right half). Other gene functions not represented in Mytibase have been introduced to recall specific molecular
pathways. Similarities resulting from InterproScan Analysis are reported in brackets whereas an asterisk indicates annotations based on manual
inspection of relevant similarities. All the acronyms with related extended names are reported in the List of Abbreviations.

depend on the overall nutritional versatility of these bacteria, chemico-physical conditions for growth but also
on the expression of hemagglutinins or lectins mediating
the interaction with host cells and active secretions able
to inhibit or disrupt the host defence reactions such as
proteases, pore-forming hemolysins, ciliostatic and
hemocyte-killer toxins [100-102]. As suggested for
V. harvey, the modulation of signalling pathways essential to the antimicrobial immune response is an additional way to attack and escape the host response [103].
Testing the Immunochip performance with hemocytes
sampled at 3 and 48 h from Vibrio-injected mussels
revealed a general AMP downregulation, possibly related
to the toxicity of live bacteria and contrasting the
enhanced response to the stimulus obtained with heatkilled bacteria [43,75]. According to quantitative real
time PCR assays performed on the hemolymph cells, the
injection of control mussels with saline solution did not

affect the expression of immune-relevant genes, namely
mytilin B, myticin B, defensin, lysozyme and HSP70
[89]. The increase in transcriptional changes from 3 to
48 h and the slight prevalence of down-regulation signals at 48 h in the hemocytes of mussels injected with
10 million potentially infective V.splendidus cells mark
an incoming functional decline. Indeed, a not negligible
fraction of the Vibrio-injected mussels (22%) showed
very slow or unapparent reactivity at 48 h (hence, considered close to death and discarded) whereas no mortality was observed at 3 h or in the control mussels
injected with the saline solution only. As Spanish and
French mussels injected in parallel with equal doses of
live Vibrio cells in their respective locations did not
show signs of distress [89] we suppose that seasonrelated life history factors may underlie the overall reaction of these mussels to the injected bacteria. The
delayed (48 h) over-expression of a number of proteases

Venier et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:69
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/69

and stress proteins supports the functional hypothesis.
Timing and complexity of the mussel immune response
as well as the immunostimulation protocol (following
shell notching, small mantle wounds may have attracted
the hemocytes and induced their degranulation far from
the adductor muscle) could also explain the progressive
AMP down-regulation observed in the hemocytes of the
Vibrio-challenged mussels. The HSPs (HSPs 20.6, 70
and 90 in particular) showed instead opposing expression trends with only a couple of probes for small HSPs
down-regulated at 48 h post-challenge. These stressinducible protein chaperons probably support prosurvival pathways but their multiple roles and complex
expression patterns suggest further study [99,104]. In
the same hemocyte samples, lectin-like and fibrinogenlike adhesion/recognition molecules showed heterogeneous expression trends whereas the frequent upregulation of mussel genes relating to the cell shape and
motility points to chemotactic and phagocytic hemocyte
behaviour. The enhanced expression of LITAF and persistent MIF down-regulation in response to the injected
bacteria encourage us to search regulatory mussel
monokines with new immunostimulation trials and
approaches other than DNA microarray testing.
The samples tested on the Immunochip exemplify
only two temporal stages of the multi-step response to a
reference dose of live V. splendidus cells. The observed
transcriptional changes apparently mark the hemocyte
activity against the Vibrio cells with a mounting inflammatory response (3 h) and a shift towards a more general stress condition (48 h). A previous equal treatment
of M. galloprovincialis with live V. splendidus, caused a
dramatic increase in living intra-hemocyte bacteria in
less than an hour, suggestive of intense phagocytosis,
and a subsequent gradual decrease with only a few
viable bacteria at 24 h post-injection [105]. Recruited
against active bacteria, the total counts of three distinct
hemolymph cells (ialinocytes, small and large granulocytes) almost halved at 3 h post-injection and, after 48 h
were still below the normal levels. Full understanding of
the complex and dynamic response of M. galloprovincialis to the bacterial attack requires further study.
The great number of deep sea vent mussel transcripts
made available during manuscript submission [106] and
the launch of a new InterProScan Sequence Search interface (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan) will probably speed up the cross-species identification and
validation of immune-related genes of marine bivalves.
A partial comparison between Mytibase and the DeepSeaVent database (http://transcriptomics.biocant.pt:8080/
deepSeaVent) rescued 5,261 annotated protein sequences
expressed in both M. galloprovincialis and Bathymodiolus azoricus [106]. New BLASTN queries performed with
the MGC transcript sequences significantly modulated at

Page 13 of 19

3 and 48 h in the Vibrio-injected mussels against the
75,407 transcript sequences of Bathymodiolus azoricus
confirmed the robustness of the Mytibase annotations
(see Additional files 2 and 3). Such similarity searches
also ascertained a not negligible sequence diversity of
putative homologues (only 75 to 91% identical nucleotide
positions in M. galloprovincialis and B. azoricus transcripts coupled by BLASTN e-value equal to 0.0) and
the absence of typical AMP (the e-values obtained by
querying the Mytibase AMP ranged from 0.97 to 5e-04).
These findings, as well as previous comparative analysis
of large EST sets from M. californianus and M. galloprovincialis [7,37], support the use of species-specific DNA
microarrays.

Conclusions
The great molecular diversification of pathogen binding
molecules such as the insect Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule [107], snail FREPs [60], sea urchin TLRs
[68] as well as the individual variant patterns reported
for sea urchin 185/333 molecules [108]] and mussel
myticins [43,109] emphasize the emerging complexity
and divergent evolution of the invertebrate immune systems. Filter-feeding bivalves such as the Mytilus species
commonly interact with a ‘sea’ of microscopic living
forms, and can reveal interesting adaptations to coevolving invaders and environmental changes. As many
proteins involved in the immune responses also participate in basic cell processes, evolutionary adaptations differ between and within taxa and the Mytilus genomes are
not yet available, the use of species-specific DNA microarrays represent a rational choice for studying transcriptional profiles and co-expression landscapes, and to
validate many immune-related candidate molecules.
In fact, Mytibase includes almost all the domains featuring the innate PRR, i.e. C-type lectin and Ig-like
domains, LRRs (and pyrin) domain, nucleotide-binding
and Toll-Interleukin receptor domains, caspase recruitment and helicase domains [110], and reports abundance and diversity of the C1q/TNF-like, lectin-like and
AMP mussel transcripts. Using the protein domains as
instructive identifiers of sequence homology and other
bioinformatics tools, we have designed 1,820 immunecandidate probes, organized them into a M. galloprovincialis Immunochip and tested this new DNA microarray
with haemolymph samples exemplifying the early and
late response to live V. splendidus cells. From one fifth
to one fourth of the ImmunoChip probes gave significant fluorescence signals, respectively, and indicated
both the modulation of various cell processes and a very
specialized hemocyte transcriptome. Accordingly, the
Immunochip could be confidently used to expand the
validation of candidate probes on hemocytes and also in
other mussel tissues. The putative relational map

Venier et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:69
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/69

resulting from the Immunochip data certainly requires
further study. In the meantime, a good number of Mytibase sequences relevant to the mussel immunity such as
for instance the fibrinogen-like peptides are the object
of new studies [111,112].

Methods
Identification of immune related mussel sequences in
Mytibase

A multiple search strategy guided the extraction of putative immune-related sequences from Mytibase, the mussel
transcript database [37]. We used 2,915 Gene Ontology
(GO) sequences associated with UniProt Knowledgebase
(UniProtKB) below the node GO:0002376-Immune system
processes [113] and 4,216 sequences downloaded from the
multispecies ImmunomeBase [2] to seek related mussel
transcripts by tBLASTn similarity search (cut-off 1.0E-4).
A working list of 1,233 keywords relating to mussels and
innate immunity also supported the extraction of MytiBase sequences. Finally, BLAST similarities, gene ontologies and protein features reported in Mytibase were
manually screened to confirm the core set of immunerelated mussel transcripts.

using unrelated human sequences as templates. The
designed probes were custom synthesized (Europe Services Invitrogen), arranged and deposited (BioRobotics
MicroGrid II, Digilab, Genomic Solutions) on derivatized glass slides (MICROMAX Glass Slides: SuperChipTM I, Perkin-Elmer) at 50% relative humidity. The
resulting species-specific Immunochip includes two
equal arrays, each one organized in 16 subarrays and
containing 4×1,820 mussel probes, 652 unrelated probes
in multiple replicates and 112 alignment spots. Probe
fixation on the slide was performed by UV cross linker
(Stratagene) at a total power of 300 mJ. Slides were
rinsed once in 1% SDS, 3× SSC for 1 min at room temperature, twice in distilled water for 5 min at room temperature, dried in laminar flux chamber and stored at
room temperature under vacuum.
Mussel challenge with Vibrio splendidus

Selected immune sequence groups, mainly identified in
Mytibase by textual search of Interpro domains [114]
and/or BLAST similarity searches [115] were evaluated
in more detail. The raw sequence traces identifying
AMP and those containing the molecular signature of
C-type lectin (IPR001304) and C1q (TNF-like)
(IPR001073) were manually cleaned to perform multiple
sequence alignment and compute phylogenetic trees by
the Neighbour Joining with Bootstrap test. To multialign
and validate the identification of AMP precursors and
C1q domain containing sequences, we used different
editors: Muscle [116], BioLign/BioEdit [117] and Jalview
[118]. The C1q signature was confirmed by sequence
homology search based on profile hidden Markov models (HMMER3) [119] whereas SignalP was used for prediction of signal peptide cleavage sites [120].

Native mussels of commercial size (6.8 ± 0.7 cm lenght)
from one outlet of the Venice lagoon (Italy, water temperature of 24-25°C) were acclimatized for one week in
sea water collected at flood tide (32 psu, 22°C) and fed
with Isochrisis galbana. Following careful shell notching,
0.1 ml of exponentially growing bacteria (10 7 Colony
Forming Units of V. splendidus LGP32 in TrypsinCasein-Soy medium) were injected into the posterior
adductor muscle. One ml of hemolymph was withdrawn
from individual mussels at 3 and 48 h post-injection
and 10 hemolymph/group were pooled [89]. Hemolymph samples were similarly collected from paired
control mussels injected with NaCl-enriched PBS (PBSNaCl). Following centrifugation at 800x g, 4°C for
15 min, the pelleted hemocytes were re-suspended in
1 ml Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and immediately stored
at -80°C. Basically, two biological replicates per time
point (3.1 and 3.2; 48.1 and 48.2) each one representing
10 individual hemolymphs were processed for hybridisation on the Immunochip in dye-swap combinations with
a unique reference composed by all the hemolymphs
sampled in parallel at 3 and 48 h from the control
mussels (N = 40).

Probe design and Immunochip preparation

RNA sample processing and microarray analysis

One thousand and 820 oligonucleotide probes were
designed with OligoArray 2.1 [121] on the selected
MGCs according to the following requirements: 56.7
average length (54-57 range), 300 bases of distance
between the oligo 5’ end and transcript 3’ end, 10-80%
CG content, 70-92°C melting temperature with 65°C
and 60°C as thresholds for cross-hybridization and hairpin formation, respectively. Additional 38 oligonucleotides (56-mers) with no virtual hybridization against the
whole mussel EST collection were similarly designed

Total RNA from pooled hemolymph of treated and control mussels was extracted and additionally purified with
high molar LiCl. RNA concentration and quality were
ascertained by using the NanoDrop® ND-1000UV spectrophotometer and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (microcapillary electrophoresis on RNA 6000 Nano LabChips, Agilent
Technologies). Equal amounts of 4 pooled hemolymph
samples, representing 40 mussels injected with PBS-NaCl,
were mixed to define one unique reference sample to be
competitively hybridized on the Immunochip.

Hemolymph mRNA was linearly amplified from total
RNA with the Message-Amp™ II aRNA Amplification
kit (Ambion): 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP modified nucleotides were incorporated into the aRNA during the
in vitro transcription reaction, then mono-functional
NHS-esters of Cy3 or -Cy5 dyes (CyDye Post-Labeling
Reactive Dye Pack, Amersham GE Healthcare) were
resuspended in DMSO and covalently coupled to the
aminoallyl-aRNA probes for 1 h at room temperature in
the dark [122]. Following purification (Gene Elute PCR
Clean-up kit, Sigma-Aldrich) and UV-quantification, 500
ng of both reference and test aaRNAs were combined
and ethanol-precipitated. Cy3/Cy5-coupled samples
were re-suspended in 18 μl of hybridization buffer (5x
SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS), denaturated for 3 min
at 70°C and competitively hybridised to the Immunochip
for 24 h at 48°C in humidified dual-slide chamber (HybChamber, GeneMachines). Slides were first conditioned
for 12 h at 48°C in a solution of 5x SSC, 100 ng/μl salmon sperm ssDNA, 5x Denhardt’s solution and 0.1%
SDS). Reference and test samples were then simultaneously hybridised in dye-swap crossed combinations on
the 2 identical arrays of the same slide. The slides were
sequentially washed at room temperature with mild
shaking in buffer: 1x SSC, 0.2% SDS; 0.1x SSC, 0.2%
SDS; 0.2x SSC (4 min each) and 0.1x SSC (3 min), with
final drying by air flow.
Microarray data analysis

Immunochip fluorescence signals were scanned using two
lasers (633 nm and 543 nm) at 5 μm resolution with a GSI
Lumonics LITE dual confocal laser scanner. Image processing and signal quantification were performed with the
software ScanArray Express® (PerkinElmer). Normalisation of the fluorescence signals was performed by using
the total and LOWESS (Logfit) algorithm with MIDAS
(MIcroarray Data Analysis System, http://www.tm4.org/
midas.html) [123]. The log2 test/reference ratio of all the
normalised fluorescence values was computed and the
genes differentially expressed in the test sample versus
control sample were identified by means of the Significance Analysis of Microarrays available from the Stanford
University, CA (SAM software package v3.0, One-class
analysis with 200 minimal permutations and FDR < 2%)
[124,125]. Similarities among the Immunochip profiles
were assessed by hierarchical clustering of the Pearson
correlation similarity matrix (J-Express v2.1) [126].
