Abstract
Background: Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is a major forage crop. The genetic progress is slow in this
legume species because of its autotetraploidy and allogamy. The genetic structure of this species
makes the construction of genetic maps difficult. To reach this objective, and to be able to detect
QTLs in segregating populations, we used the available codominant microsatellite markers (SSRs),
most of them identified in the model legume Medicago truncatula from EST database. A genetic map
was constructed with AFLP and SSR markers using specific mapping procedures for
autotetraploids. The tetrasomic inheritance was analysed in an alfalfa mapping population.
Results: We have demonstrated that 80% of primer pairs defined on each side of SSR motifs in M.
truncatula EST database amplify with the alfalfa DNA. Using a F1 mapping population of 168
individuals produced from the cross of 2 heterozygous parental plants from Magali and Mercedes
cultivars, we obtained 599 AFLP markers and 107 SSR loci. All but 3 SSR loci showed a clear
tetrasomic inheritance. For most of the SSR loci, the double-reduction was not significant. For the
other loci no specific genotypes were produced, so the significant double-reduction could arise
from segregation distortion. For each parent, the genetic map contained 8 groups of four
homologous chromosomes. The lengths of the maps were 2649 and 3045 cM, with an average
distance of 7.6 and 9.0 cM between markers, for Magali and Mercedes parents, respectively. Using
only the SSR markers, we built a composite map covering 709 cM.
Conclusions: Compared to diploid alfalfa genetic maps, our maps cover about 88–100% of the
genome and are close to saturation. The inheritance of the codominant markers (SSR) and the
pattern of linkage repulsions between markers within each homology group are consistent with the
hypothesis of a tetrasomic meiosis in alfalfa. Except for 2 out of 107 SSR markers, we found a similar
order of markers on the chromosomes between the tetraploid alfalfa and M. truncatula genomes
indicating a high level of colinearity between these two species. These maps will be a valuable tool
for alfalfa breeding and are being used to locate QTLs.

Background
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is the most cultivated forage
legume, with about 32 millions hectares over the world
[1]. Its agronomical interest is based on its high protein
content, suitable feeding value and favourable environmental balance (perenniality and no nitrogen fertilizer
required). However the genetic progress in this species is
slow because of its autotetraploidy [2], with 2n = 4x = 32
[3,4], its allogamy and the synthetic structure of the varieties. The development of a genetic linkage map would be
a significant breakthrough, either to map candidate genes,
to search for QTL of agronomical traits, or to make
marker-assisted selection. Such analysis requires working
on cultivated material, either in terms of genetic background or ploidy level.
In the past years, low density linkage maps were obtained
on diploid forms of the Medicago sativa species complex
[5-7]. The parental plants originated from CADL plants
(Cultivated Alfalfa at the Diploid Level, diploid plants
produced from cultivated tetraploid alfalfa) [6] or from
natural populations, the crosses being made at the subspecific level [5,7]. All these maps comprised from 89 to
153 RFLP, RAPD or isozymes markers, and spanned from
467.5 cM [7] to 659 cM [6]. A denser map based on a cross
between M. coerulea and M. quasifalcata, was published in
2000 [8] and covered 754 cM for a haploid genome, with
868 markers (mainly RAPDs and RFLPs). A linkage map
of tetraploid alfalfa was constructed with 82 RFLP markers, using two backcross populations of 101 individuals,
and covered about 470 cM, with 7 homology groups only
[9]. The number of polymorphic RFLP markers is clearly a
limiting factor to the development of a saturated map at
the tetraploid level in alfalfa.
Until recently, mapping procedures in autopolyploids
plants were based on SDRF (single-dose restriction fragments) segregation in mapping populations analysed as
pseudo-test crosses [10,11]. Genetic maps were obtained
in autotetraploid species such as potato [12,13], alfalfa
[9], tea [14], rose [15], birdsfoot trefoil [16] and in
autooctoploid species such as sugar cane [17-19] and
strawberry [20]. Recently, theoretical studies were published to analyse gene segregation and to perform the
mapping in autotetraploid species [21-24] or even autooctoploid species [25]. All types of markers can be used: a
dominant marker present in one parent in single dose
(simplex or SDRF) or double dose (duplex), a dominant
marker present in both parents (double simplex), and
codominant markers (Figure 1). It is now possible to
develop a map in autotetraploid species, based on all
codominant or dominant markers, and to calculate linkage between pairs of markers, either in coupling phase or
in repulsion phase. The software TetraploidMap, released
in 2002 [26] is suited for this type of calculation. A

method aiming at ordering the markers into a linkage
map of autotetraploid species using simulating annealing
was also proposed [27], but no specific software is presently available.
In autopolyploid species, two facts are usually unknown:
(1) does the whole genome show a tetrasomic inheritance, or do some parts of the genome have a disomic
inheritance ? (2) what is the frequency of double-reduction ? Indeed, two sister chromatids could segregate in the
same gamete after formation of a tetravalent during meiosis. Consequently, double-reduction creates new types of
gametes and modifies the probabilities of each type of
gametes in a segregating population [28-30]. Its frequency
can be calculated by TetraploidMap software on codominant markers.
In this article, we report the construction of a genetic map
for each of the parents of an F1 population obtained by
crossing one individual from each of the Magali and Mercedes alfalfa cultivars and using the mass-revealed dominant AFLP markers together with codominant
microsatellite (SSR) markers. We have used a set of SSRs

identified in the EST database of Medicago truncatula and
mapped on M. truncatula Recombinant Inbred Lines
(Huguet et al., unpublished results) to construct alfalfa
genetic maps. In the recent years, M. truncatula, an annual,
diploid species of the Medicago genus, was chosen as a
model species for the legume family [31,32]. A genetic
map was recently developed using an F2 population [33]
and preliminary evidence was given that diploid M. sativa
and M. truncatula genetic maps were aligned. Considering
the phylogenetic proximity of M. truncatula and alfalfa, we
used these EST-based SSR, and some other SSR markers
published in M. truncatula ( [34], Santoni et al. unpubl.)
or M. sativa [35], to build alfalfa linkage maps and to align
all genetic maps.
Based on 599 AFLP and 107 SSR markers, we identified,
for both parents, 8 groups of 4 homologous chromosomes each. The total length of the maps covered between
88 to 100% of the genome. We have numbered the
homology groups of alfalfa as for M. truncatula [8,33].

Results
Mapping population
Alfalfa is an allogamous species with a strong inbreeding
depression. Consequently, plants are highly heterozygous
and selfing gives rise to either self-sterility or lethal allelic
combinations or very "weak" plants. Homozygous lines
cannot be obtained and F2 populations may suffer from a
genetic bias induced by the death of some genotypes. So
our mapping population is a set of 168 F1 individuals
from the cross between Mercedes4.11 used as female parent and Magali2 used as male parent.
AFLP markers
Using 27 AFLP primer pairs, a total of 599 polymorphic
markers were scored on the mapping population (Table
1). Most of them segregated as simplex (Figure 1), but a
large number of markers had other segregations, mainly
duplex or double-simplex. Among all AFLP markers, the
percentage of distorted markers reached 34.8%.
Table 1: Segregation of polymorphic AFLP markers in alfalfa F1
mapping population from Mercedes4.11 × Magali2. Simplex and
duplex markers were present in one parent, in 1 and 2 doses,
respectively. Double-simplex markers were present in both
parents in 1 dose. Among each type of marker, the number of
distorted markers (P < 0.05) is indicated.

SSR markers
Transfer of SSR to alfalfa
The SSR primer pairs mainly originated from M. truncatula: 35 among those developed by Santoni et al. ( [34] and
unpubl.), 1 published by Diwan et al. [35] and 187
obtained by Huguet et al. (unpubl. data). Nine SSR primer
pairs were developed from an alfalfa genomic library [35]
and tested on diploid and tetraploid alfalfa.

The amplification and polymorphism among the 2 parents were tested for these 232 primer pairs (Table 2). Only
19% of the primer pairs (44) gave no amplification. Over
the 81% of primer pairs (187) that gave amplification,
34% (78) were monomorphic and 47% (110) were polymorphic between Magali2 and Mercedes4.1. So far, only
87 pairs have been used for genotyping in the mapping
population.
Inheritance of SSR markers
With the 87 primer pairs (Table 3), 318 alleles (= bands)
were scored, 284 of them being polymorphic in the mapping population. The parental genotypes were determined
from the segregation of alleles at each locus using the
"Findgeno" procedure from TetraploidMap software. The
monomorphic bands were excluded from segregation
analyses as a monomorphic allele is present at least in triplex dose in a parent. For 43 loci, the parental genotypes
were determined, and the coefficient of double reduction
(α) was not significantly different from 0 (Table 4). For 20
loci, α was significantly different from 0 but the genotypes
of the parents were also found under the absence of double reduction (Table 4). For 24 loci (Tables 5, 6), the
parental genotypes could not be determined. The amplification of more than one locus was suspected from the
visual reading of the gels (a large gap between groups of
alleles was interpreted as the presence of 2 different loci,
Figure 2) and from the segregation of alleles in the mapping population (i.e. the presence of individuals with
more than 4 bands, or individuals with 3 alleles from the
same parent). From 21 primer pairs, 41 polymorphic loci
were identified, and their segregation was analysed (Table
5). The genotypes of the parents were determined, with
double reduction for only 6 loci. Finally for 3 primer pairs
(Table 6), a multilocus segregation was evidenced, but it
was not possible to group the alleles in loci with an
expected segregation. For these 3 primer pairs, the bands
were treated as dominant markers to determine the parental genotypes (Table 6). For the loci that showed significant double-reduction (in Tables 4 and 5), all the F1
genotypes could have been formed without double-reduction. So the segregation of these markers in F1 is not different from segregation distortion.

Over the 104 polymorphic SSR loci with codominant segregation, the average number of alleles per locus in both

parents was 2.9, and the average number of polymorphic
alleles per locus was 2.6. These figures must be compared
to 8 allelic positions in 2 autotetraploid parental genotypes. The number of polymorphic alleles was 183 in
Mercedes4.11 (1.8 alleles per locus), and 188 in Magali2
(1.8 alleles per locus). A large number of 'null' alleles were
identified as shown in Tables 4, 5, 6.
Map construction
All markers (simplex, duplex, double-simplex AFLPs and
multi-allele SSR loci) except the distorted double-simplex
AFLP markers were used to build maps. The map
construction was performed in 3 steps. First, TetraploidMap calculated a χ2 test of independence between markers, which led to 8 homology groups for each parent. Then
within each homology group, TetraploidMap determined
the linkage phase, recombination rate and LOD score
between markers, whatever their dose. Linkage groups
(i.e. chromosomes) within homology groups were manually identified using the linkage phase information. In
both Mercedes4.11 and Magali2, for each homology
group, 4 linkage groups were found, except for homology
group 5 in Magali2 which had only 3 linkage groups.
Finally, for each linkage group, the recombination rates
and LOD scores were entered in the JoinMap software
[36]. The order of the markers was calculated and the
maps were drawn. For Mercedes4.11 (Figure 3), the map
length was of 3045 cM, with 339 marker positions and an
average distance between markers of 9.0 cM. The map of
Magali2 (Figure 4) covered 2649 cM, with 350 marker
positions and an average distance between markers of 7.6
cM. In both maps, the distorted markers were spread over
the genome.

The repulsion linkages were distributed among each pair
of chromosomes within one homology group, and this
was observed for each homology group (figure 5, example
for homology group 8 in Magali2).
Twenty four SSR primer pairs out of 87 gave multi-locus
profiles. All the loci obtained with one primer pair were
mapped close together (i.e. MTIC12-1 and MTIC12-2 in
group 2, MTIC135-1 and MTIC135-2 in group 8 of

Magali2, etc.), except MTIC77-1 and MTIC77-2 which
were mapped on group 8 and 3, respectively.
Composite map
The large number of polymorphic SSR loci made it possible to build a composite map, based on the recombination rate and LOD score for each pair of SSR markers in
each homology group. Instead of 8 chromosomes per
homology group for both parents, a single linkage group
was obtained. The total length of the map (figure 6)
reached 709 cM, with 107 loci. Conflicting linkages
occurred in group 4, so this chromosome was split in 3
parts. The average distance between markers was 6.6 cM.

Discussion
The development of a dense genetic linkage map in cultivated tetraploid alfalfa is the first step in understanding
the genetic control (QTLs) of traits of agronomic interest.
Agronomic traits are not well evaluated in wild M. sativa
because of its prostrate growth habit, so the dense map
obtained in wild diploid M. sativa [8] can hardly be used
for QTL detection of agronomic traits. As in other heterozygous species, and especially in autotetraploid ones [21],
we used a F1 population for mapping. Indeed, even if a F2
generation could be a valuable tool in terms of number of
recombination events, a selfing generation could lead to
genetic skewing through the death of some inbred plants.
We chose easy to use handy PCR markers: AFLPs and SSRs.
AFLPs, because they are mass-revealed, help in covering
the whole genome. SSRs mainly originated from EST
databases of M. truncatula, are codominant, locus-specific
and portable. They were previously mapped in this model
species, and thus allow the analysis of synteny between
the two species, alfalfa and M. truncatula.
Marker diversity and segregation in the mapping
population
A large number of polymorphic markers were obtained
for each AFLP primer pair. Among the two parents of the
mapping population, almost 50% of the SSR primer pairs
revealed polymorphism. It is noteworthy that the SSR loci,
which gave amplified but monomorphic bands over the 2
parents of the mapping population, may reveal polymorphism in other genetic backgrounds, so the observed

variability in our experiment is only an underestimated
value of the extent of the variability existing within alfalfa
cultivars.
Interestingly, the two parents of the mapping population
shared the same characteristics: the number and
proportion of simplex, duplex, double-simplex and distorted AFLP markers and the number of SSR alleles (1.8
alleles per locus and per parent).
A large number of null alleles were found with SSRs, possibly arising from mutations in alfalfa compared to M.
truncatula in the sequences that match the SSR primers.
The number of null alleles using SSR primers directly
developed in alfalfa should be lower. Indeed, there was
only one null allele in this mapping population for each
of both SSR markers developed in alfalfa (AFct32 and
AFct45). In Prunus [38] and sugar beet [39] a large number
of null alleles were also identified when using SSR markers from different species.
Some SSR primer pairs (21 over 87) gave multi-locus
amplification in alfalfa; this was also observed in soybean
[37], Prunus sp [38], Brassica sp [39], sorghum [41],
mungbean and lablab [42]. Multi-locus amplification was

evidenced from allele segregation in the mapping population. This can result from the duplication of zones of
genome during the evolution between M. truncatula and
M. sativa.
Mapping in alfalfa
Using the AFLP and SSR markers, distorted or not, we
identified 8 groups of homologous chromosomes in each
parent, each but one group with 4 chromosomes. The
homologous status of the chromosomes was established
by the codominant SSR loci and the repulsion linkages.

We obtained longer and more saturated maps with AFLPs
and SSRs (662 and 761 cM for the haploid genome in
Magali2 and Mercedes4.11, respectively) in the tetraploid
cultivated alfalfa than in the previously published
research with only RFLPs (470 cM for the haploid
genome) [9]. Furthermore our map lengths were close to
what was obtained in diploid alfalfa [8], with 754 cM.
We propose a portable reference map built with only SSR
loci. It spans 709 cM for the haploid genome, covering
94% of the genome of diploid alfalfa [8]. The average distance between markers is 6.6 cM. A limited number of SSR

markers spread on the whole genome can be chosen to
build maps in other populations.
The dense maps including AFLPs will be valuable for an
accurate QTL analysis in our population. The composite
SSR map will be useful to compare QTL position in different populations.
As in published diploid and tetraploid alfalfa maps [43],
we have found that AFct32 and MTLEC2A markers were
mapped on the same chromosome (group 3) and AFct45
on another chromosome (group 8).
Autotetraploidy in alfalfa
Codominant markers are adequate tools to test the
autotetraploid structure of the genome [22]. This study is
the first demonstration of the tetrasomic inheritance of

chromosomes in alfalfa, using SSR markers. This
autotetraploidy pattern is confirmed by the repulsion
linkages between markers belonging to all homologous
chromosomes. Recently in alfalfa, a preferential chromosome pairing at meiosis was found with RFLP markers in
a F1 population [44]. We can hypothesize that this result
originates from a choice of mapping population parents
that are genetically distant (a non-dormant genotype of
M. sativa and a very dormant genotype related to M.
falcata).
In our study, some loci showed a significant double reduction frequency. Nevertheless, genotypes only originating
from double-reduction were not found. The doublereduction obtained here is not different from a segregation distortion. The rate of double-reduction in alfalfa is
presumably low, so its detection would require the

analysis of a large population. This result is in accordance
with the observation of meiosis in alfalfa, which shows a
low proportion of tetravalent formation [45]. Nevertheless, in mapping procedures, double reduction cannot be
taken into account [23].
Segregation distortion
The segregation distortion reached 35% over the AFLP
markers. The double-simplex and the duplex were more
frequently distorted than the simplex markers. For the
SSRs, considering the loci showing significant double
reduction as distorted loci, the proportion of distortion
was 25% (26 loci over 104). These rates of distortion are
similar to that obtained in M. truncatula [33] or in diploid
alfalfa [5-7]. But in tetraploid alfalfa, Brouwer and Osborn
[9] obtained a segregation distortion of only 5.5% for the
simplex RFLP alleles, and stated that the autotetraploidy
could reduce the effect of deleterious alleles that cause distorted segregation. However, the restriction of the segregation distortion analysis to the simplex alleles could result
in an optimistic view of the distortion. The random repartition of the distorted markers over our maps showed that
no alfalfa genome region was particularly distorted contrarily to the situation in the M. truncatula genome [33].

Transfer of SSR markers
More than 80% of the SSR markers initially developed in
the legume model species M. truncatula gave amplification products in alfalfa. This capacity to give rise to amplification in these species is not surprising since they belong
to the same genus. Indeed, such transfers have already
been reported across annual and perennial species of Medicago genus for 4 markers [43] and very recently for 89%
of a set of 455 primer pairs developed from EST of M. truncatula [46]. The transfer of SSR markers among species
within some genera has already been obtained in Glycine
sp [37], Prunus sp [38] and Brassica sp [39], in the three
cases with SSRs isolated from genomic DNA. The high
level of SSR transferability allows the use of a large
number of SSRs from public M. truncatula EST on alfalfa.
Comparison with M. truncatula map
Over the 94 SSR loci mapped on both M. sativa and M.
truncatula, all but 2 were gathered in the same groups (T.
Huguet, unpublished data) suggesting that no major chromosome rearrangement had occurred since the species
differentiation. Unexpected mapping was obtained for (1)
MTIC272 was mapped in group 3 of M. truncatula but
group 6 in Magali2 and (2) MTIC77-1, a marker only
present in Magali2 was mapped in group 8, although
MTIC77-2 was mapped in group 3 in both parents as in
M. truncatula. Eight SSRs could not be mapped, due to
insufficient linkage with other markers (MTIC35,
B21E13-1, B21E13-3, MTIC77-3, MTIC84-1, MTIC230
and MTIC356). Some SSR markers that were not mapped
in M. truncatula because of the absence of polymorphism
in mapping populations, were mapped in alfalfa: MTIC95
(group 1), MTIC7 (group 3), MTIC94 (group 4),
MTIC289 and MTIC471 (group 7).

The order of SSR markers along chromosomes is very well
conserved between tetraploid alfalfa and M. truncatula (T.
Huguet, unpubl. data). The cases of misalignment can be
explained by a lack of accuracy in the recombination rate
estimation. Indeed a recombination rate has a standard
error which varies with the size of the mapping population, the recombination rate and the type and phase of the
pairs of markers [21]. In autotetraploid species, for a F1
mapping population of 168 individuals, the standard

Figure linkage map of Mercedes4.11, homology groups 1 to 4
Genetic 3
Genetic linkage map of Mercedes4.11, homology groups 1 to 4. Mercedes4.11 is the female parent of a F1 mapping
population in tetraploid alfalfa. Each box contains the homologous chromosomes of one group. The groups were numbered
similarly to M. truncatula (T. Huguet, unpublished data) and diploid M. sativa (G. Kiss, pers. comm.). The chromosomes within
each group were arbitrarily numbered from 1 to 4 and are orientated as in M. truncatula. When JoinMap software split the map
of one chromosome in 2 or 3, each linkage group was named by the number followed by a letter. The number to the left of the
chromosomes refers to the genetic distances (Kosambi cM) from the top. The number to the right of the chromosomes refers
to the marker names. The SSR markers are in upper-case and the AFLPs in lower-case letters. AFLP markers followed by "d"
had a distorted segregation. When several SSR loci came from a single primer pair, their names were composed of the name of
the primer pair followed by a number.

error of a recombination rate of 0.2 is 0.03 for two simplex
markers and 0.07 for a simplex and a duplex, both in
coupling phase. This synteny is a very positive point for
the future use of M. truncatula genomics for genetic studies
in cultivated tetraploid alfalfa.
The comparison of the alfalfa maps with that of M. truncatula using the SSR markers indicates that chromosomes
1, 2, 6 and 8 are well covered with markers regularly
spaced all along M.
truncatula
homologous

chromosomes, but clearly more markers are needed on
group 4, and on the upper parts of groups 3, 5 and 7.
We were surprised to note that the haploid genome map
length in a F2 population of M. truncatula was about 2
times larger than our map on tetraploid alfalfa (1225 vs
709 cM), although DNA content of haploid genome was
1.5 times less in M. truncatula than in tetraploid alfalfa
[47].

Genetic linkage map of Mercedes4.11, homology groups 5 to 8. See legend in Figure 3.

Conclusions
We have obtained genetic linkage maps of cultivated tetraploid alfalfa using a combination of AFLP and SSR markers, with length and marker density close to saturation.
Their comparison to M. truncatula maps through the common SSR markers reflects the synteny between these two
species. The inheritance of the codominant SSR markers
indicates a true autotetraploidy of alfalfa, with complete
random pairing of chromosomes at meiosis. The orders of
the markers on the chromosomes are very similar. The use
of such maps to identify QTLs for agronomical traits is in
progress in our laboratory.

Methods
Mapping population
The two parental plants were selected within the numerous alfalfa varieties bred in France. One originated from
the Provence type cultivar Magali, and was named

Magali2. This genotype was previously used in a diallel
crossing design [48] and has high general combining ability for forage digestibility and plant height. The other
plant, Mercedes4.11, originates from the high yielding
Mercedes cultivar, and was kindly provided by B. Bayle,
from Limagrain Genetics company. It was selected after 2
cycles of selection for increased disease (Verticillium
alboatrum), pest (Ditylenchus dipsaci) and lodging resistance. In year 1999, the two plants were manually crossed,
with Mercedes4.11 as the female parent. The flowers were
castrated before stamina dehiscence, and the style was
cleaned with alcohol at 70% to remove any pollen grains.
The pollen of Magali2 flowers was harvested on a brush
and applied on the style of female plant. A total of 236
seeds was harvested. In year 2000, a subset of 168 plants
out of 230 germinated seeds, was randomly taken to represent the F1 mapping population.

Genetic linkage map of Magali2, homology groups 1 to 4. Magali2 is the male parent of a F1 mapping population in
tetraploid alfalfa. See legend in Figure 3. In group 4, the linkage group numbered "3/4" indicated that it was linked to both chromosomes 3 and 4.

DNA extraction
Young leaflets were harvested on each plant, and DNA
was extracted using a standard CTAB (hexadecylatrimethylammoniumbromide) procedure [49].

performed at 85 W, for approximately 3 h 30 min, on a 38
× 53 cm gel apparatus. The gel was subsequently placed
for 3 h at 75°C in a gel dryer and exposed to a Kodak
Biomax MR X-ray film for 2–5 days.

AFLP markers
AFLP analysis [50] was performed with the Gibco Brl kit
AFLP™ Analysis System I, as recommended by the
manufacturer, with some modifications designed to
optimize the readability of the gels. Pre-amplification
products were diluted 1:10 in water instead of 1:50. For
some primer pairs, selective amplifications were performed with 33P-labeled EcoRI selective primers as
recommended by Gibco Brl. Reaction products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel
with a 1X TBE buffer with 7 M urea. Electrophoresis was

For primer pairs analyzed without 5'end-labeled EcoRI
primer, products from selective amplifications were separated on denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels as
above and visualized using a silver staining method [51].
Each AFLP marker was identified by the last 2 nucleotides
of the two primers, followed by a number according to the
size of the band. Only polymorphic bands were scored.
Three cases of polymorphism were considered: bands
present in Magali2 and absent in Mercedes4.11, bands
absent in Magali2 and present in Mercedes4.11, and

bands present in both parents and segregating in the population. Twenty-seven AFLP primer pairs were used to
genotype the whole population.
Microsatellite markers (SSRs)
The 232 SSR loci tested originated from 3 sources: 10 SSR
markers published by Diwan et al [35], 35 from a SSRenriched bank made on the model species M. truncatula (
[34], S. Santoni, unpublished data), and 187 SSR markers
developed in M. truncatula from the public EST database
(T. Huguet, unpublished data).

For SSR markers published by Diwan et al [35], PCR reactions were performed as described by the authors and
amplification products were visualized using a silver
staining method. For the other SSR loci, PCR products
were revealed using silver staining method or a LI-COR
IR2 automated sequencer. For silver staining, PCR reac-

tions were performed in a final volume of 20 µl in a MJ
Research model PTC-100 thermocycler. The reaction
buffer contained 37.5 ng of template DNA, 0.2 mM of
each deoxynucleotide, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 µM of each
primer, and 0.5 unit of Platinium Taq DNA polymerase
(Gibco Brl). An initial Taq polymerase activation step of 4
min at 94°C, followed by a step of 35 cycles with 30 sec at
94°C, 1 min at 55°C and 1 min at 72°C, plus a final elongation step of 7 min at 72°C were performed. The PCR
products were then separated on denaturing
polyacrylamide sequencing gel as for AFLP markers. For
the sequencer, 3 primers were used: the primer pairs (0.4
µMeach) with one primers synthesized with a M13 forward or reverse primer sequence on the 5'-end, and one
IRD-labelled M13 primer (0.4 µM). The M13 primer was
added to the PCR product during the first few cycles of
amplification. The labelled M13 primer was incorporated
in subsequent cycles, thus labelling the PCR products. The

other PCR conditions were the same as for silver staining.
The amplification products were separated on 6.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (LI-COR) as recommended by
LI-COR.
From test experiments on the 2 parental plants plus 2 F1
plants, we classified the markers as showing no amplification (or a non specific amplification showing a multibanding profile), showing amplification but with a monomorphic profile, and showing amplification with polymorphic profiles. The whole mapping population was
then genotyped for 87 of these SSR loci.
Marker detection and inheritance
We used the "Findgeno" subroutine from the TetraploidMap software [26]. It gives the segregation type for each
marker. The distorted AFLP markers were thus identified.
For the SSR markers, the autotetraploid inheritance was
tested. The software identifies the parental genotypes,
from the phenotypes of the parents and of the F1 plants at
each locus, without or with double reduction. For 24 loci,
the number of alleles exceeded 4 for some F1 individuals,
and the gels patterns clearly indicated that 2 or 3 loci were
amplified (Figure 2). In these cases, several loci were
scored for each primer pair and the segregation was analysed as described above. The locus names were thus composed of the name of the primer pair followed by a
number (i.e. MTIC84-1 and MTIC84-2). When the
parental genotype identification failed, the alleles amplified by the primer pairs were scored as dominant markers.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/3/9

The alfalfa map was accepted if the χ2 test in JoinMap was
low, and so, some AFLP markers were excluded.
A composite map was built with only the SSR loci. The
SSR previously assigned to the groups of homologous
chromosomes, and the recombination rates between pairs
of loci were used to build the map of each group using
JoinMap. Three parameters of JoinMap were changed:
"the number of maximum linkages to show per locus"
was decreased from 2 to 1, "use linkage with REC smaller
than" was changed from 0.40 to 0.49 and "LOD larger
than" was changed from 1 to 0.5.
The cover of the maps was calculated by the ratio between
the length of our maps and the length of the dense map of
diploid alfalfa [8] (754 cM).

Author's contributions
BJ carried out the statistical and mapping analyses and
drafted the manuscript, SF carried out most molecular
analyses, TH, GC and SS provided information on M.
truncatula SSR markers and contributed to the comparisons of alfalfa and M. truncatula maps, PB gave technical
advice and contributed to the design of the study, CH
coordinated the study and contributed to the discussion.
All authors read and approved the manuscript.

Map construction
The "Cluster" subroutine of the TetraploidMap software
was used to create groups of markers that do not segregate
independently. We wanted to obtain 8 groups with many
markers, according to the number of base of chromosomes in alfalfa. We had to ask for 9 to 11 groups, as 1 to
3 of the groups had very few markers, and so had to be
discarded. All the markers were included, distorted or not,
except the AFLP markers present in both parents that did
not segregate in 3:1 ratio.

Then for each homology group, the linkage for each pair
of markers was analyzed ("Twopoint" subroutine). The
markers can be unlinked, linked in a coupling phase or
linked in a repulsion phase. A linkage was considered only
if the LOD score was above 2. From the linkage analysis,
the markers that composed each linkage group (chromosome) in each homology group were identified. The
Twopoint procedure produced an output file containing
the recombination rate and the LOD of each pair of
markers. The order of the markers on each chromosome
was determined using JoinMap 3.0 software [36], using
the ouput file of the Twopoint procedure. We used the
Kosambi distance, and the default parameters of JoinMap.
