Phylogenetic screen for important RNA structure
motifs in the HIV-1 genome

Background
Several HIV-1 RNA structures play important roles in
viral replication. We showed that despite sequence
divergence among virus isolates, certain structural
motifs such as the TAR hairpin are conserved [1]. The
structure of the complete 9kb HIV-1 RNA genome was
determined via SHAPE-technology in 2009, which
revealed many new structural motifs [2]. We speculate
that important RNA structures are conserved despite
sequence variation, and we used the SHAPE-derived
RNA structure model to screen for new structured RNA
signals.
Materials and methods
Sixteen hairpin motifs scattered along the HIV-1 RNA
genome were selected and evaluated in silico for structural
conservedness. As reference sequence we used the HIV-1
NL4-3 strain that was analyzed by SHAPE [2]. The most
prevalent sequences for HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, and D, as
well as SIVchimp in the Los Alamos database were chosen
as the ‘prototype’. This prototype sequence was analyzed
with the mfold program and the predicted structure was
compared to that of the NL4-3 reference. Four hairpin
motifs revealed only minor structural variations in subtypes A-D and SIVchimp and were analyzed in further
detail using the HIV sequence compendium 2010 with up
to 34 sequences per subtype. All sequence variations were
evaluated for maintenance of the structure. To investigate
the impact of the 4 hairpin motifs on HIV-1 replication,
silent codon changes were introduced into the full length
molecular clone HIV-1 LAI, either per individual hairpin
or all 4 combined.

Results
Only 4 of the 16 HIV-1 RNA structures are well-conserved in the HIV-1 subtypes and SIVchimp. Three
hairpin candidates are positioned within the reverse
transcriptase gene, one is located in the Nef/3’LTR overlap. Based on the HIV-1/SIV full length sequences in
the HIV sequence compendium 2010, we could show
that the majority of reported sequence variations maintained the RNA structure. We introduced silent codon
changes to destabilize the RNA hairpins for each of the
4 motifs, which was confirmed in silico by mfold predictions. Pilot cell culture experiments indicate that the
mutation of individual RNA motifs has little impact on
the virus replication rate, but the combined structure
alterations in 4 regions affect the HIV-1 fitness.
Conclusions
It is likely that many yet undisclosed structured RNA
signals reside in the HIV-1 RNA genome. Our strategy
is to first map the RNA structures that are phylogenetically conserved among the HIV/SIV isolates, followed by
a mutational test of the respective structures. Of the
important motifs, follow-up studies should reveal the
role played by the RNA signal in HIV-1 replication.
