Abstract
Gene regulation in higher organisms is achieved by a complex network of transcription factors
(TFs). Modulating gene expression and exploring gene function are major aims in molecular biology.
Furthermore, the identification of putative target genes for a certain TF serve as powerful tools for
specific targeting of rational drugs.
Detecting the short and variable transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in genomic DNA is an
intriguing challenge for computational and structural biologists. Fast and reliable computational
methods for predicting TFBSs on a whole-genome scale offer several advantages compared to the
current experimental methods that are rather laborious and slow. Two main approaches are being
explored, advanced sequence-based algorithms and structure-based methods.
The aim of this review is to outline the computational and experimental methods currently being
applied in the field of protein-DNA interactions. With a focus on the former, the current state of
the art in modeling these interactions is discussed. Surveying sequence and structure-based
methods for predicting TFBSs, we conclude that in order to achieve a sound and specific method
applicable on genomic sequences it is desirable and important to bring these two approaches
together.

Introduction
A complex network of gene regulatory signals allows each
cell in both single- and multicellular organisms to flexibly
respond to environmental factors. In 1967, Ptashne realized that gene expression is regulated by protein switches
that bind to target sequences in the DNA [1]. Understanding the mechanisms underlying sequence-specific binding
of proteins to DNA and the resulting gene expression,
holds great promise for targeting numerous diseases
through rational drug development [2].
The sequencing of whole genomes alongside with experimental studies of the control of gene expression has

revealed some fundamental mechanisms. Each gene is
regulated by at least one, but often multiple transcription
factor (TFs). The TFs bind to specific transcription factor
binding sites (TFBSs) within the regulatory regions (promoters) of the genes. The functional arrangement, i.e. the
presence, combination, and order of the TFBSs in a regulatory region, form promoter modules [3] that control the
spatial and temporal expression of genes [4].
The analysis of individual TFBSs can provide important
clues in deducing regulatory networks in a cell and the
functional context of specific genes. Over time, several
experimental methods have been developed for studying

TFBSs. In vitro analysis is complicated by two facts typical
of TFs: TFs usually bind to multiple target sequences with
varying affinity and they often regulate multiple genes. In
silico analysis is not straight-forward either, but presents a
necessary extension to current in vitro methods. The main
obstacles are that TFBSs are often located in non-coding
DNA, degenerate in their sequence, and relatively short
(5–12 nucleotides). Searching for such low-information
content sites within huge amounts of genomic DNA using
computational methods typically yields a large number of
randomly occurring false positive sites. Reducing the
number of these false positives has been the goal of many
efforts. Currently, most successful sequence-based algorithms are context-sensitive and account for the presence
of other TFBSs [5], relative positioning to transcription
start site (TSS) [6], and evolutionary conservation of functional regulatory elements [7]. Seen from a structural
point of view, the recognition of a nucleotide sequence by
a DNA-binding protein is determined by the interactions
between the DNA base pair (bp) edges and the amino acid
side chains. Structure-based methods use either statistical
information obtained from structural data, or models for
representing the steric and chemical complementarity, for
evaluating the affinity of a protein-DNA complex [8].
Research during the past decades has focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying protein-DNA interactions and aiming towards expressing these using general
sets of rules. First attempts to define such a recognition
code arose in 1976 through the work of Seeman and
Rosenberg [9], who identified a specific pattern of hydrogen bond (H-bond) acceptors and donors on the DNA bp
edges. More detailed studies of protein-DNA structural
complexes soon concluded that the interactions could not
be explained by a simple one-to-one correspondence
[10,11]. However, specific amino acid-base preferences
do exist [12,13], which comes as no surprise given their
chemical and structural characteristics.
Current sequence-based algorithms and structure-based
models will benefit from a mutual integration, when the
primary aim is to develop fast and reliable prediction
methods for TFBSs and an understanding for how DNA
recognition is facilitated. Experimental techniques for
studying protein-DNA interactions and the physical characteristics of such interactions will be explained in the first
two sections. In the final section, accurate computational
modeling of the binding sites of regulatory proteins will
be discussed in the light of experimental and theoretical
implications.

nation of binding sites for transcription factors are important for creating a sound description of each TFBS.
There are a several methods available for producing interaction data. Nitrocellulose-binding assay [14], electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) [15], enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [16], DNase 1 footprinting
[17], DNA-protein crosslinking (DPC) [18], and reporter
conducts [19] are examples of in vitro techniques that are
used for determining DNA binding sites and analyzing the
difference in binding specificity for different protein-DNA
complexes. They are all currently in use, but suffer from
major drawbacks: they are not suited for high-throughput
experiments and information on optimal vs. suboptimal
protein binding sites is lost.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a recent
microarray-based assay developed for genome-wide determination of protein binding sites on DNA [20]. Systemic
evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX)
[21] and Phage Display (PD) [22] represent another type
of experiments and offer a high-throughput possibility to
select high-affinity binders, DNA and protein targets
respectively. Both SELEX and PD suffer from the same
drawback, the fact that the multitude of sequences
obtained from these experiments are all good binders, but
it is hard to say anything about their relative affinities. The
assumption that the best binders occur more frequently,
from purely statistical reasons, is commonly adopted. The
differences between individual mutants have to be measured one at a time by other and more laborious methods
(discussed above).
In 1999, Bulyk et al. presented dsDNA microarrays for
exploring sequence specific protein-DNA binding [23].
The major advantage over the methods discussed above is
that it is a high-throughput method resulting in data with
associated relative binding affinities, which is of high
importance in protein-DNA interaction studies.
Finally, there is X-ray crystallographic and NMR spectroscopic data providing a base for studying the structural
details of protein-DNA interactions. Protein-DNA complexes have successfully been co-crystallized [24], and the
data has been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
and Nucleic Acid Database (NDB). Each complex is a 3D
representation of all intermolecular interactions participating in protein-DNA recognition, however, the experiments are very time-consuming.

Characteristics of protein-DNA interactions
Experimental methods
In order to be able to analyze differences and commonalities of how binding takes place, examples of binding sites
are required. Experimental methods used in the determi-

Characteristics of C-G and T-A base pairs
Characteristics of C-G and T-A base pairs Intermolecular H-bonds (dotted lines) in the C-G and T-A bp, stabilize the DNA double helix. The bp edges form a pattern of
H-bond acceptors and donors that can be recognized by
amino acid side chains of proteins. This pattern is unique for
each bp (C-G, G-C, T-A, and A-T) in the major groove (up),
whereas it is only possible to distinguish a C-G bp (top) form
an T-A bp (bottom) in the minor groove (down) [9]. H-bond
acceptors and donors are indicated by outward and inward
pointing arrows respectively. The letter M is the methyl
group of the base T and HR is a ring hydrogen donor. The

backbone is independent of the bp sequence and thus not
involved in the specificity of sequence recognition. Only
the edges of the bp are exposed in the grooves of the helical DNA, where they form a pattern of H-bond acceptors
and donors [9] that can be recognized by the amino acid
side chains, see Figure 1 for an illustration. Specific recognition of DNA has to rely on the interactions with these
exposed patches. TFs typically contain a DNA-binding
domain and one or multiple interaction domains that
bind to other TFs. It is common to group the TFs into families according to the structure of these DNA-binding
domains [26], where each family employs a different
mechanism for recognizing the DNA sequence of the target site [12].
The energetics and mode of protein-DNA interactions differ from those of protein-protein interactions. The main

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/2/1/3

differences are that the protein-DNA interfaces are much
more polar, have many more intermolecular H-bonds,
and a higher abundance of buried water molecules
[27,28]. The most important biochemical interactions in
protein-DNA complexes are van der Waals contacts, Hbonds, and water-mediated contacts [29]. About twothirds of all contacts are non-specific and made with the
sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, leaving one-third
of all interactions for the specificity [30]. Nonspecific
interactions (protein-DNA backbone) are extremely
important for the overall stability of the complex, and are
mainly mediated through van der Waals contacts. About
two-thirds of the specific interactions (protein-DNA base
edges) involve complex H-bond patterns [29]. The distribution of H-bonds clearly demonstrates particular amino
acid-base preferences, but no generalizable code can be
deduced [13]. It is important to note that each amino acid
can interact with more than one bp simultaneously, and
several different amino acids can interact with the same
bp. Interdependence between both bases and amino acids
is an important feature of the interaction scheme. Very
specific contact patterns can be achieved in this way and
enable subtle but crucial differences in binding affinities
[31].
Water molecules act as contact-mediators and space-fillers
at the protein-DNA interface and play a key role in complex formation. As suggested in [32], an atomic description of water molecules at the interface is required for a
complete formulation of protein-DNA interactions.
Important water bridges can be identified in crystal structures or using molecular modeling [33].
The helical DNA structure is often distorted when bound
to a protein [34,35]. Enforced bending of the DNA strand
occurs through kinks at the base steps, leading to unstacking and unwinding of the helix. Several types of structural
changes have been detected, including shift, slide, twist,
rise, roll, and tilt [36]. The stiffness of the DNA helix is
determined by the background bp composition [37], i.e.
C-G bp are more rigid since they have one additional Hbond compared to A-T bp. The side chains of the protein
are flexible and can re-arrange upon complex formation
in order to achieve complementarity.

Computational methods
Computational approaches present an attractive solution
for modeling and discovering TFBSs on a genomic scale.
Several different computational approaches for predicting
TFBSs have been explored, which has lead to considerable
progress during recent years. The main approaches are
sequence and structure-based, where the difference is that
sequence-based methods consider only the primary structure of DNA, whereas structure-based methods aim at
describing the physical and chemical complementarity

between a TF and its binding site. We will now briefly discuss some selected sequence and structure-based computational methods for predicting TFBSs.
Experimentally verified binding sites can be used for constructing a consensus sequence motif of the binding site of
a TF. A consensus sequence can be obtained from a multiple alignment of known binding sites [38], and can be
used for scanning genomic sequences in the search for
TFBSs [39,40]. However, methods using scoring matrices
for describing the binding sites [41,42] offer great advantages over consensus sequence methods. Position specific
scoring matrices (PSSMs) are based on experimentally verified binding sites and represent the relative distribution
and conservation of all nucleotides in the binding site.
PSSMs exist for almost all types of TFBSs [43] and are
widely used for predicting binding sites [41]. For an excellent review on PSSMs, see [44]. Table 1 is an illustration of
a consensus sequence and a PSSM for an example TFBS.
Sequence logos can be used for graphically describing the
PSSMs [45]. The main advantage of PSSMs is that a qualitative measure can be obtained rather than the yes/no type
of answer obtained from consensus models. Accounting
for interdependence [46] between bases in the TFBS is not
trivial, thus treating the binding energy contribution of
each position in the binding site as independent ("independent binding hypothesis") is a frequently adopted
approximation [47]. However, some improvement in performance has been achieved using higher order PSSM
models [48,49].
False positive hits are detected with high frequencies [50],
when using consensus or PSSMs for scanning genomes for
putative binding sites. Bringing genetic context into the
models has improved the specificity of the prediction
methods. Limiting the search to predicted promoter
regions [6,51], combining a set of functionally related TFs
[4], and searching for their co-abundance has increased
the specificity significantly [40]. The inclusion of spacingrules between the TFs [52], limitations of the number of
each contributing TF [53], and combinatorial aspects of

TF positioning [54,55] has further reduced the number of
false hits.
Several TFs bind their target sequences as homo- or heterodimers, leading to co-occurring binding sites. The
number of nucleotides in the gaps between the two halfsites may vary, even for the same TF binding to two different sites [56]. Accounting for varying half-site spacing in
computational search algorithms is not trivial, nevertheless essential. Synergy, or cooperative binding is another
reason for co-occurring motifs. Per definition, classical
cooperative binding is when protein-protein interactions
lead to a more efficient control of the promoter. Biological
experiments have shown that synergistic activation can
also occur when two regulatory proteins have no physical
contact [57]. Computer simulations indicate that this
might be an effect of the protein first binding changing the
tension in the DNA strand [58]. Several computational
methods predicting TFBS have been developed that take
such putative synergy effects into account. BioProspector
[59] and Co-Bind [5] are examples of methods that can be
used for discovering co-occurring motifs.
Computational de novo discovery of overrepresented
motifs has been used for finding putative and functionally
related TFBSs. Detecting short and degenerate binding
sites in genomic sequences is a very hard task. Limiting the
search to promoters and conserved non-coding regions
where TFBSs are enriched [60] has improved the performance. Gibbs Sampling [61], Ann-SPEC [62], and LOGOS
[63] are examples of algorithms that have proven helpful
in detecting TFBSs [64,65]. Further improvement has been
made by assuming that co-expressed genes are co-regulated [66], at least to some extent. Inferring co-expression
in order to detect overrepresented motifs in regulatory
sequences has frequently been adopted [67,68].
Phylogenetic footprinting is a computational method
commonly applied as a filter for pointing towards conserved, possibly functional regions of non-coding regulatory sequences [7,69]. Several successful examples have

been reported [70,71], and the computational methods
have been reviewed in [72,73].

vide valuable insights into the physical interactions at an
atomic level.

Alongside with an increasing number of genomic
sequences, the amount of structural information on protein-DNA complexes has been increasing rapidly. Careful
structural analyses of protein-DNA complexes obtained
from PDB and NDB have identified the characteristics of
such interactions [13,27,29]. Examination of the relationship between amino acid sequence conservation and role
in DNA sequence recognition in protein-DNA complexes
has revealed a strong correlation across all protein structural families [74,75].

Conclusion

Structure-based models offer promising extensions to the
sequence-based models. These provide a way to qualitatively analyze DNA deformation, cooperativity, and other
structural properties of protein-DNA interactions. There
are mainly two categories of structure-based approaches.
The first one is based on statistical potentials and the second one on potentials obtained from molecular mechanics simulations. Statistical potentials are derived from
systematic analysis of structural protein-DNA complexes.
Pairwise potentials are extracted from distributions of Cα
atoms around DNA bases of known protein-DNA complexes, which reflect the statistical occurrence of specific
interactions. They have proven to be sufficiently sensitive
to evaluate the affinities of sequences obtained in a combinatorial fashion by threading them onto the fold of the
original complex [8,76]. Computer simulations have been
used to derive free-energy interaction maps between pairs
of bases and amino acids [77,78], which can be used for
prediction of TFBSs in a similar fashion as described
above. In order to fully address structural flexibility of
both protein and DNA, and interaction redundancy,
intensive computation is needed. Observing processes
during appropriate simulation periods and accounting for
whole-system interactions are the two main limiting factors. Despite the required computing power, free energies
have been analyzed in larger biological systems, see [79]
for a review. Encoding the structural properties of specific
DNA sequences and using these in combination with
sequence-based methods can improve the specificity of
the predictions [28,80].
The direct interactions between amino acids and DNA
bases are mainly specific hydrogen bonds, which are fairly
well understood. The non-specific interactions, constituting the majority of all interactions involved, are less well
understood yet nevertheless, indications exist that these
will provide important clues in understanding the complete picture of protein-DNA recognition. Structure-based
approaches for modeling protein-DNA interactions are
expensive regarding computing power, however, they pro-

Protein-DNA interactions have been under intense
research during recent years, which has resulted in numerous valuable finding as well as computational methods
for the prediction of TFBSs. While sequence-based methods are amenable to analyses on a whole-genome scale,
the computational costs for structure-based methods are
currently still prohibitively high. The required computation time ranges up to several days for one single proteinDNA complex, due to the complexity of the interactions.
At the same time, structure-based methods provide deep
insights into the mechanisms and features of the proteinDNA interaction. These insights allow us to validate – or
falsify – some of the assumptions and approximations
underlying some of the sequence-based methods.
Sequence-based algorithms also provide a fast and flexible
system for analyzing and reducing the search space in
genomic sequences, whereas computationally intensive
structure-based approaches can then be used in a final
step with the specificity needed for a final evaluation of
the predicted binding sites.
We hence observe both a need and a recent tendency to
use structure-based methods for validation of sequencebased methods. We conclude that advanced sequencebased methods and detailed structure-based methods will
make a strong combination in the search for putative
binding sites for regulatory proteins in genomic
sequences.
