Abstract
Background: Ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductases (FNRs) are flavoenzymes that catalyze the
electron transfer between NADP(H) and the proteins ferredoxin or flavodoxin. A number of
structural features distinguish plant and bacterial FNRs, one of which is the mode of the cofactor
FAD binding. Leptospira interrogans is a spirochaete parasitic bacterium capable of infecting humans
and mammals in general. Leptospira interrogans FNR (LepFNR) displays low sequence identity with
plant (34% with Zea mays) and bacterial (31% with Escherichia coli) FNRs. However, LepFNR
contains all consensus sequences that define the plastidic class FNRs.
Results: The crystal structures of the FAD-containing LepFNR and the complex of the enzyme
with NADP+, were solved and compared to known FNRs. The comparison reveals significant
structural similarities of the enzyme with the plastidic type FNRs and differences with the bacterial
enzymes. Our small angle X-ray scattering experiments show that LepFNR is a monomeric enzyme.
Moreover, our biochemical data demonstrate that the LepFNR has an enzymatic activity similar to
those reported for the plastidic enzymes and that is significantly different from bacterial
flavoenzymes, which display lower turnover rates.
Conclusion: LepFNR is the first plastidic type FNR found in bacteria and, despite of its low
sequence similarity with plastidic FNRs still displays high catalytic turnover rates. The typical
structural and biochemical characteristics of plant FNRs unveiled for LepFNR support a notion of
a putative lateral gene transfer which presumably offers Leptospira interrogans evolutionary
advantages. The wealth of structural information about LepFNR provides a molecular basis for
advanced drugs developments against leptospirosis.

Background
Ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductases (FNRs) are flavoenzymes that catalyze electron transfer between NADP(H)
and the iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin (Fd) or flavin
mononucleotide-containing flavodoxin [1]. These
enzymes are normally present as monomeric proteins in
plastids, bacteria, mitochondria, and apicoplasts of intracellular parasites, where they catalyze the reaction
described in equation (1), using noncovalently bound
FAD as a prosthetic group.
2 Fd(Fe+2) + NADP+ + H+2 Fd(Fe+3) + NADPH

(1)

Depending on the primary energy source of the organism
the reaction catalyzed by FNR can be driven toward one of
the directions indicated by the double arrow in equation
(1). In heterotrophic bacteria and eukaryotes, the catalysis
is driven toward ferredoxin reduction providing reducing
power for a wide range of metabolic pathways [1,2].
Structural information is available for FNRs from plastids
(maize leaf [3], spinach [4], pea [5]), cyanobacteria (Anabaena [6]) and bacteria (Azobacter vinelandii [7],
Escherichia coli [8] and Rhodobacter capsulatus [9]). Topologically, there is a number of similarities within the two
structural domains of FNRs of a different origin. The protein core, composed of a αβ-sandwich with a 5-strand βsheet surrounded by 5 α-helices, is strongly conserved
among FNRs. Structural differences however, appear in
the size and conformation of the loops on the protein surface [10]. FAD binding site is located between the protein
domains and has been described in detail by Bruns & Karplus [4].
The binding of the prosthetic group to FNRs from different sources is structurally different. The crystal structures
of enzymes from plastids and cyanobacteria have FAD
molecule in an extended conformation, while those from
others prokaryotes are bended toward themselves and
establish hydrogen bond interactions between the adenine and the isoalloxazine [1,11].
Sequence alignments of FNRs from different organisms
revealed conservation profiles in close agreement with
above discussed structural differences. A sequence alignment of plants, bacteria and algae FNRs reveals that the
overall homology between enzyme primary structures is
not so high, although amino acid sequence conservation
between plant enzymes, for example, is significantly better (Fig. 1).
Leptospira interrogans is a spirochaete parasitic bacterium
known to infect humans and mammals including cattle,
dogs, pigs, horses and its natural carrier hosts, rodents.
Quite surprisingly, according to phylogenetic analysis,

Leptospira FNR (LepFNR) has been recently suggested to
belong to the plastidic class FNRs [1]. The low identity in
primary structure with the members of plastidic FNRs
(Fig. 1), makes LepFNR an interesting target for structural
and biochemical analysis aiming to better understand the
structural grounds of the high catalytic efficiency of these
oxidoreductases. In addition, the structure of LepFNR provides structural basis for the design of efficient and specific drugs dedicated to leptospirosis treatment.
In this work we submitted LepFNR to both structural and
biochemical analysis. The crystal structures of LepFNR,
presented here, reveal the molecular basis of recognition
and binding of both prosthetic group FAD and substrate
NADP+ by the enzyme. Structural comparison of LepFNR
with other FNRs, both from plant and bacterial origin,
demonstrated more structural similarities of LepFNR with
plant enzymes than with the bacterial FNRs. Small angle
scattering experiments prove that LepFNR is a monomeric
enzyme in solution. Finally, our biochemical data indicate that the LepFNR has a high enzymatic activity similar
to those reported for the plastidic class enzymes and, considerably different from bacterial flavoenzymes which display lower turnover rates.

Results and discussion
Overall quality of the X-ray models
The quality of the LepFNR crystal structure, refined to 2.4
Å resolution, is fine as judged by stereochemical and
refinement parameters (Table 1). Overall topology of the
LepFNR molecule has the canonical FNR fold [10], which
consists of two well defined domains, although several
unique structural features were found in LepFNR 3D structure. The N-terminal domain forms a 6-stranded antiparallel β-barrel, and harbors the FAD binding site. The Cterminal domain folds as a αβ-sandwich with a 5stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices (Fig. 2). A
unique feature present in LepFNR structure is the small
helix formed in the loop 76–91 (highlighted in Fig. 2).
This region has been previously identified as an important
docking site of ferredoxin binding, mediated by its positively charged amino acid residues [11]. Although being
exposed to solvent, this protein-protein recognition site
has low mobility as judged from B-factors analyses (Fig.
2). Highly flexible regions of the protein are mostly confined to the surface loops (Fig. 2a).

Two out of the four molecules present in asymmetric unit
of LepFNR crystal jointly coordinate a metal ion via two
glutamates and one histidine residues, as shown in Figure
2b. This metal binding site is unique and has not been
previously observed in any other FNR crystal structures.
FNRs are known to function as monomeric proteins [11],
however it has been recently suggested that two FNR isoforms from Arabidopsis thaliana are capable of dimer for-

oligomeric state of LepFNR in solution by small angle Xray scattering.

X-ray scattering curves at the protein concentration of 3

therefore we used scattering data measured at 10 mg/ml to

parison of SAXS data with crystallographic structures of
LepFNR monomers and dimers using CRYSOL reveals
that LepFNR forms monomers in solution (Fig. 3a and
Table 2). Analysis of the distance-distribution p(r) function (Fig. 3b) led us to conclude that the protein has a
maximum dimension Dmax of 6.50 ± 0.50 nm, compatible with a FNR monomer. The value of 2.13 ± 0.50 nm for
Rg calculated from the distance distribution function is in
a good agreement with the estimate derived from the
Guinier analysis of 2.16 nm. Furthermore, a structural
superposition of the ab initio low-resolution envelope of
the protein with the high-resolution X-ray structure of the
LepFNR monomer (Fig. 3c) leaves no doubt that the protein is indeed a monomer in solution.
Our results on LepFNR monomeric form obtained from
solution X-ray scattering diverge from the results of the
recent crystallographic studies of Plasmodium falciparum
FNR [13]. In the latter protein, two oxidized cysteine residues form a covalent bond joining two molecules in a
dimer. The cysteine residues involved in the bridge is
highly conserved over the plasmodial FNRs, but not in
plant and homologous FNRs [13]. LepFNR, on the other
hand, exhibits higher sequential identity with plant FNRs
and does not contain cysteine residues in the position
required to form the intermolecular disulfide bridge. This
analysis strongly suggests that metal mediated LepFNR
dimerization, observed in the crystal structure, is induced
by crystallization effects and do not represent a physiologically relevant oligomeric state of the protein.

FAD binding site
Crystal structure analysis reveals that unlike in usual
prokaryote FNRs, LepFNR accommodates the FAD molecule in an extended conformation between the two
enzyme domains (Figs. 2a, 2c and 2d). Adenosine portion
of FAD is less restrained and more disordered as could be
concluded from LepFNR crystallographic B-factors analysis. An increased disorder of adenosine portion of FAD as
compared to the whole molecule is common for plastidic
class FNRs [4].

The flavin group of FAD is tightly bound to FNR binding
cleft through strong hydrogen bonds (Figs. 4a and 4b).
The main chain atoms of Ser97, Ile115, Lys117 and Leu95
interact directly with flavin moiety creating the core of the
binding site (Fig. 4b). Ser97 and Tyr96 also interact to flavin group via their side chains, adding to a stereochemical
environment able to bind and tightly fix the FAD molecule. It is interesting to note that although Ile115 plays an
important role in flavin recognition and interacts with the
flavin group through a strong hydrogen bond (2.66 Å in
length), this residue is not conserved in FNRs (Fig. 1).
Similarly, Lys117 is only partially conserved in FNR family and is present in approximately half of the FNRs shown
in the alignment (Fig. 1). Crystal structure analysis reveals,
however, that both residues participate in FAD recognition and binding through their main chain groups, and,
therefore, evolutionary restraints on the specific amino
acid type have been lost at these positions.
The adenosine group also participates in a rich hydrogen
bond network through its pyrophosphate portion.

figures were prepared using PYMOL[38].
Cys134, Arg94, Ser135 and Val133 are at hydrogen bonding distances to pyrophosphate group strongly anchoring
it to LepFNR cleft. This results in a low mobility of adenosine group in LepFNR structure. Adenosine ribose is also
involved in strong hydrogen bond interaction with
Asp119 as judged from a short 2.71 Å length of this bond.
This is a particular feature of LepFNR since this residue is

not conserved over FNR family. At variance, this aspartate
is replaced by a hydrophobic leucine residue in plastidic
FNRs and by an alanine in some bacterial FNRs, so that
this additional hydrogen bond in adenosine binding
pocket appears to be new in FNR structures. The phenol
ring of the carboxyl terminal tyrosine (Tyr314) and the
flavin group are practically coplanar maximizing π-orbital

overlapping, as have been observed in all plastidic class
FNRs [11], resulting in a large portion of the isoalloxazine
moiety shielded from the bulk solution. This structural
feature, together with the extended FAD conformation,
has been implicated in the high catalytic efficiencies displayed by the plastidic FNRs [1,11].
Structural comparison between plant and bacterial FNRs
reveals an important and distinguished feature among
them. Plastidic FNRs have a common motif SLCV(K/R)(R/
L
Q)( /A). In LepFNR this region is less conserved (113-EFIIKRDN-120) but still contains both basic amino acids
(Lys and Arg) close to the FAD binding site. In all plastidic
FNRs previously known, FAD is bound in an extended
conformation and its adenine interacts with a tyrosine residue belonging to a typical cluster always present [1]. Surprisingly, in LepFNR FAD acquired a different
conformation in which its adenine moiety interacts with
Phe130 (Fig 4b). The latter amino acid is not conserved in
other plastidic FNRs and resides on the protruding sheetloop-sheet interacting with the 2'-P-AMP region of FAD.
This structural motif is missing in all bacterial class FNRs.
Moreover, in the bacterial enzymes the basic residues are
replaced by the hydrophobic isoleucine and leucine residues that accommodate the bended FAD in the cleft
between the N and C-terminal domains. Taken together
this evidence provides an explanation why FAD molecule
binds to LepFNR in an extended conformation, typical for
plant FNRs, and not in a bended form observed in bacterial FNRs, further highlighting structural and sequence
similarities between Leptospira FNR and its plant
homologs.

LepFNR·NADP+ complex crystal structure
LepFNR·NADP+ crystal structure, refined to 2.70 Å resolution, revealed moderate structural changes when compared to LepFNR crystal structure (Fig. 5a). Statistics of the
model is given in Table 1. The high quality of electron
density maps, allowed the unambiguously positioning of
the NADP+ molecule noncovalently bound to the C-terminal domain of LepFNR.

Small, but distinct, structural rearrangements could be
identified upon NADP+ binding. Tyr247 changes its sidechain conformation and bends toward the NADP+ in LepFNR·NADP+ crystal structure, thus facilitating interactions between adenine phosphate and its side chain
hydroxyl group. This feature was also observed in the crystal structure of Anabena FNR [14]. NADP+ binding also
causes changes in Arg245 conformation, which also is
part of the NADP+ binding site (Fig. 5b). NADP+ molecule
is attached to LepFNR C-terminal domain by a network of
hydrogen bonds (see Fig. 4b). Similarly to FAD binding,
the adenine portion of NADP+ is tightly bound to LepFNR. In opposite, the nicotinamide group has an
increased mobility, as indicated by crystallographic B-factors. At atomic level, adenine moiety makes water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Gly277, Gly281, Met278 and
Ile248 main chain atoms. The ribose group also interacts
with Ser234 and forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds
with Ala232. The phosphate group is anchored by the
hydrogen bonds with Arg245 and Arg235. All residues
mentioned above have their counterparts in the already
identified crystal structures of pea and Anabaena FNRs
complexed with NADP+ [5,14]. At variance, in LepFNR the
nicotinamide portion of NADP+ makes water mediated
hydrogen bonds with Asp119, Arg41 and Glu210. Lysine
117 also interacts to NADP+ by a hydrogen bond with oxygen of phosphate group, as indicated in Figure 4b.
The overall structural adjustments induced by NADP+
binding in LepFNR structure are modest, and RMSD deviations between NADP+ bound and NADP+-free states are
of 0.453 Å as calculated for Cα positions only. Structural
superposition of the 3D models using their N-terminal
domains shows a maximum displacement of 1.0 Å
between respective Cα positions in these two models,
which is confined to the C-terminal helices region. The
superposition of the structures is given in Figure 5.
Enzymatic activity
As shown in Table 3, LepFNR has a high diaphorase activity, reaction commonly used to characterize FNRs [11].
Similarly, LepFNR exhibited Km for NADP+ which is identical to the one obtained for the pea (P. sativum) enzyme
(Table 3). The kcat/Km for LepFNR is circa 75% with respect
to that of the latter FNR. These steady state kinetic studies
reveal that the LepFNR enzyme has high affinity for

NADPH. The affinity for NADP+ was determined by difference absorption spectroscopy after successive addition of
the nucleotide. The LepFNR enzyme has a Kd for NADP+ of
43 µM, which is in the same range of the affinities
observed for the P. sativum enzyme and other reductases
(Table 3 and ref [11]). These data are in agreement with
the suggested affinities for NADPH deduced from steady
state kinetic studies.

Conclusion
Crystal structures of LepFNR reveal a typical plastidic type
reductase, analogous in its folding architecture to the
enzymes found in plant and cyanobacteria, in spite of displaying an important divergence at primary structure
level. The typical FAD and NADP+ binding domains are
well conserved among them and the amino acids involved
in prosthetic group and NADP+ binding have a high
degree of structural conservation. Our analysis reveal several distinct key features of this structure: 1) The FAD molecule is bound in an extended conformation and the

adenosine moiety is interacting with a different aromatic
residue than in all other plastidic reductases; 2) The
poorly conserved amino acid fragment 113-EFIIKRDN120 still contains both basic amino acids that participate
in the FAD binding; 3) The carboxyl terminal amino acid
is a tyrosine, that is planar to the isoalloxazine at 3.6 Å distance. All these features of the LepFNR are found in enzy-

matically highly efficient reductases and are in a good
agreement with the biochemical data we have obtained
for this enzyme.

reveals a number of important similarities in the model of
substrate binding between these two enzymes. The adenosine part of NADP+ and the 2'phosphate group of the substrate are in equivalent positions in these two structures.
In both models the nicotinamide reactive part of substrate
is not positioned in a productive form and was found too
far from the isoalloxazine to allow electron transfer [this
work and ref 14]. The position observed for the Anabaena
FNR·NADP+ complex is somewhat different than the
observed in LepFNR·NADP+ crystal structure. A sequence
of three steps for the coenzyme recognition and binding
mechanism has been proposed to explain the different
conformation obtained in the Anabaena FNR·NADP+
complex [15]. Here, the position adopted by the NADP+
nicotinamide bound to the LepFNR enzyme may represent another intermediate before the productive binding
of the substrate.

An interesting outcome of our analysis is that the binding
of the substrate to holoenzyme produces not only a rearrangement of some of the residues involved in its binding
but also a moderate but indubitable conformational
change in the carboxyl terminal domain. This structural
rearrangement can help to explain the strong negative
cooperativity that has been observed for the ferredoxin
and NADP+ binding [16].

symmetry between the four molecules in asymmetric unit
was applied in all refinement steps. The crystal structure of
LepFNR·NADP+ was solved by molecular replacement
using LepFNR refined structure. Statistics of the refined
models are presented in Table 1.

After an initial crystallization screening, the crystals were
grown in a condition with 30% PEG 3350, 0.3 M ammonium fluoride, pH 6.5 [17]. Better crystals were obtained
in the optimized condition containing 27% PEG 3350, 50
mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.0 at 291 K. Crystals of LepFNR
bound to NADP+ were obtained by co-crystallization in
conditions similar to those described above. NADP+ was
added prior to crystallization trials.

Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements and data
analysis
SAXS is a fundamental tool in the study of biological macromolecules in solution, which permits to study the lowresolution structure of proteins in near physiological environments [29,30]. SAXS data for LepFNR molecular shape
reconstruction were collected at the small-angle scattering
beamline of the LNLS at the protein concentrations of 3
and 10 mg/ml. The wavelength of the incoming monochromatic X-ray beam was λ = 0.148 nm. A 1D X-ray position sensitive detector (PSD) was utilized to record the
scattered intensity as a function of the modulus of the
scattering vector q (q = 4·π·sin(θ/λ), where θ is half the
scattering angle). The parasitic scattering from air and
beamline windows was subtracted from the total measured intensities. The sample-to-detector distance (1155.1
mm) was adjusted in order to record the scattering intensity for q values ranging from 0.1 <q < 3 nm-1. Radii of
gyration Rg was evaluated by two methods, Guinier (ln
I(q) x q2)28 and by the indirect Fourier transform program
GNOM [31]. The distance distribution function p(r) was
also computed by this program. The molecular mass of
the LepFNR in solution was estimated by comparison of
the extrapolated forward scattering I(0) with that of a reference solution of bovine serum albumin with a known
molecular mass of 66 kDa. Dummy Atom Models
(DAMs) were generated ab initio using the program GASBOR [32]. The LepFNR crystallographic structure was
superimposed onto the DAMs using SUPCOMB [33].
CRYSOL [34] was used for comparison of high-resolution
models and the data derived from experiment.

Data collection and processing
A complete diffraction dataset from a single LepFNR crystal was recorded at MX1 beamline of Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) [18,19]. The synchrotron
radiation wavelength of 1.42 Å was chosen to optimize
both the diffraction efficiency of the protein crystal and
the synchrotron-radiation flux at this medium energy synchrotron [20,21]. A single crystal was transferred to 5 µl of
the mother liquor supplemented with 1 µl ethylene glycol. The crystal was flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at
100 K prior to data collection. Images were processed and
integrated using MOSFLM [22]. Scaling was carried out
with SCALA, from CCP4 suite [23].

The LepFNR·NADP+ complex diffraction data was collected from a crystal flash-frozen following the same procedure. The dataset was collected at Rigaku Ultra X18
rotating anode, operating at Cu Kα wavelength radiation,
which was equipped with Osmic Confocal mirror optics
and a MAR345 image plate detector. Images were indexed,
integrated and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA (CCP4
suite). The statistics of data reduction for both crystals are
given in Table 1.
Structure solution and refinement
Attempts to solve LepFNR by molecular replacement were
carried out using both Anabaena FNR (PDB entry
1OGJ[15]) and maize root FNR (PDB entry 1JB9[24]).
Maize root FNR resulted in a better initial model and was
used to further refinement. The structure was improved
prior to molecular replacement using CHAINSAW (CCP4
suite) and employed as a search model in molecular
replacement procedure using PHASER [25]. The molecular replacement was able to find four independent protein

Enzymatic activity measurements
FNR-dependent diaphorase activity was determined by a
published method [35]. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 3 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 0.3 mM NADP+, 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, and 1 mM potassium ferricyanide. After
the addition of ~20 nM LepFNR, the reactions were monitored spectrophotometrically by following potassium ferricyanide reduction at 420 nm (ε420 = 1 mM-1·cm-1). The
experiments have been conducted at 30°C.

Determination of the dissociation constant of the
LepFNR·NADP+ complex
Difference absorption spectroscopy was used to evaluate
the dissociation constant of the LepFNR·NADP+ complex.
The experiment was performed essentially as previously
described [2] with a solution containing 35 µM LepFNR in
50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, which was titrated at 25°C with
the substrate.
