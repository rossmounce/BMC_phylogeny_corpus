Abstract
We describe two patients who did not experience a viral rebound after cessation of HAART which was initiated for
progressive disease. CD4 T-cell count remained stable in one patient and progressively declined in the other,
despite apparent viral control. We failed to identify any immune activation or genetic markers that could offer an
explanation for this unusual “secondary controller” status. But their viruses are clearly less fit compared to viruses
from rebounders.
Introduction
Highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has
improved life expectancy and quality of life of HIV
infected patients [1]. However, so far it is not possible
to “cure” HIV infection mainly because latent reservoirs
persist even in patients who are on effective combination treatment [2]. Cessation of HAART results in viral
rebound within days or weeks and pre-treatment levels
of viral load (VL) are typically reached within one year
after treatment interruption [3,4].
In 2008 we identified a patient who, after stopping
HAART, had a VL below the detection limit of 1,6log
for more than 2 years. After searching the data base of
1,700 HIV infected patients under follow-up at the clinic
of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, another patient
was identified, who spontaneously controlled VL after
cessation of HAART for at least 6 months. We labeled
these two patients “secondary controllers” (SC) as
opposed to “elite controllers” (EC) who spontaneously
control viral replication but are treatment naive.
Comparison between SC and “rebounders”
Methods

In order to identify correlates of SC status, we compared
clinical characteristics, viral factors, genetic traits and
immune activation markers in the two SC and patients
who rebound after treatment cessation. We used the

following criteria to define SC and rebounders: (1) being
HIV-1 infected for at least 3 years; (2) HAART started
in the chronic progressive phase; (3) HAART discontinued for the first time; and (4) VL below the detection
limit of 1.6log at treatment interruption. Pregnant
women taking HAART to prevent mother-to-child
transmission and patients who started treatment in the
acute phase of infection were excluded. SC were defined
as patients who met the above criteria and who kept
their VL below 3log for at least 6 months after treatment cessation. In order to make sure that the SC were
not taking antiretroviral drugs, plasma samples were
tested for the presence of protease inhibitors (PI) and
non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors at the
Bioanalytical Laboratory of the Catholic University of
Louvain.
The following parameters were assessed: HIV subtype,
CD4 count, VL and number of days on HAART and
were compared in SC and rebounders. In addition, we
evaluated plasma markers of immune activation, including: neopterin; beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) (Demiditek,
Germany); soluble CD14 (sCD14) (R&D, United Kingdom); and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Lonza, Belgium).
These measurements were done on stored plasma samples taken before starting HAART (T1), during HAART
(T2) and 6 months after stopping HAART (T3). Soluble
markers in plasma were measured instead of activation
markers on cells (Roberts AIDS 2010), because at our
clinic only plasma samples of patients are stored.
In order to assess viral factors, the SC provided 100
ml of blood for purification of CD4+ T-cells. One part

was used to extract DNA, as described elsewhere [5], for
sequence analysis of Gag, Pol and Env. The other part
was used to cultivate the virus [6].
In addition, we evaluated the relative replication capacity of P1. To assess viral fitness phytohemagglutinin
(PHA) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) from 3 healthy donors were infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 10-3 with the viruses, IIIB and
BAL as reference strains (NIH, Germantown, MD), and
with virus isolated from SC patient 1 and from 4 different rebounders. P24 concentrations were measured by
ELISA over time.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of ITM and the Ethics Committee of the University Teaching Hospital in Antwerp. Informed consent
was obtained from all patients.
Results

When searching our database on 1700 patients in regular follow-up, we found that a total of 160 patients had
stopped HAART for the first time, after a mean of 25
months of successful viral suppression. Treatment was
stopped under medical guidance, mostly because of toxicity and/or because the patient wanted a drug holiday.
At least two VL measurements after treatment cessation
were available for 124 patients, which enabled us to
classify them as “rebounders” or “SC”. Median time to
rebound (VL > 3log) was 7 weeks and median time to
re-starting treatment was 4.5 months. Sixty-eight
patients remained off treatment for at least 6 months.
By that time all but 2 patients (the SC) had a VL that
exceeded 3log. Both SC were negative on the drug
assays.

Case presentations
Patient 1 was diagnosed with HIV infection in 1985. In
1993 he started treatment with AZT, when his CD4
count was 228/μL. VL testing was unavailable at that
time and no plasma samples from 1993 were available
at the clinic in Antwerp. The first VL measurement
dated from 1999 when the patient was already taking
AZT monotherapy. It was 3.4 log and a PI based
HAART regimen was started and continued till 2001,
when the patient was switched to Nevirapine and 2
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI’s). He
took this combination till treatment interruption in
April 2005, when his CD4 count was 458/μl. In July
2005 the VL was 3.9log but from October 2005 until
now it remained below the detection limit. The CD4
count, however, has been decreasing to 205/μL in February 2010 but the patient refuses to be restarted on
treatment.
Patient 2 was found to be HIV positive in 1997, but
was probably infected since 1991. In 1998 her CD4

Page 2 of 5

count was 377/μL and her VL 4.6log. She was started
on HAART with a PI based regimen. In 1999 she
switched to Nevirapine and 2 NRTIs. Treatment was
stopped in March 2006. The VL remained undetectable
after treatment interruption, though in April 2009 there
was a blip in the plasma VL of 2,9log, which was
detected with the Cobas ampliprep/cobas Taqman
(Roche, New Jersey, USA). The patient is still off treatment with a stable CD4 count above 1000/μL.
Table 1 summarizes the main clinical findings of the
two SC and the 66 rebounders. All clinical parameters
of SC, including VL before HAART and time on
HAART, were within the range of the rebounders.
Patient 2 carried HLA B3501, which is rather associated
with rapid progression. Both SCs were homozygous for
wild type CCR5. They also show similar levels of plasma
immune activation during and after stopping HAART,
as compared to the rebounders.
Virus measured as p24 in culture supernatant of purified CD4+ T-cells from patients under HAART, typically emerges after 3 to 6 days. In contrast, in patient 1
it emerged on day 21, while in patient 2 virus culture
failed despite three attempts. In 2009, however, the latter patient had a blip in plasma virus suggesting that the
virus is not completely defective. Moreover the
sequences of Gag, Pol and Env in the two SC did not
show any obvious defects, and no CD8 T-cell associated
escape mutations could be detected. Remarkably, phylogenetic analysis of env from patient 1 revealed the presence of two related but distinct viruses. Both viruses
were lacking the lentivirus lytic peptides (LLP) 1 region,
but could still be cultured.
Autologous viruses from patient 1 could be cultured
making it possible to investigate whether the virus of
this patient was less fit in comparison to reference
strains or virus of 4 different rebounders. Figure 1
clearly shows that the virus of the SC replicates less as
compared to the reference strains and viruses of
rebounders since the amount of p24 produced in PHA
stimulated PBMC remains much lower over time in
comparison to viruses of rebounders and the reference
strain.

Discussion
We identified two HIV-1 infected patients with an
exceptional clinical course after stopping HAART. One
patient kept stable and high CD4 T-cell counts for more
than 4 years after treatment cessation, while the other
patient had progressive disease with decreasing CD4 Tcell counts. Such discrepancy of evolution has also been
described in elite controllers [7-9].
To our knowledge there is only one previous study
that had identified patients who maintained an undetectable viral load for several months after treatment

Figure 1 Relative replication fitness. The relative replication
fitness was determined in PHA blasts from 3 healthy donors by
measuring the p24 production produced by HIV reference strains
BAL and IIIB or patient viruses (P1 is secondary controller, P5-P8 is
from rebounders). (A): p24 production in ng/ml in donor 1. (B): p24

cessation. Skiest et al mentioned 2 patients who had an
undetectable viral load for 6 months after treatment was
stopped as part of a study on the effects of treatment
interruption. However, they just mention them without
comparing them with patients whose viral load
rebounded [10]. We are aware of only one study that
has explored factors predictive of “non-rebounder” status [11]. Bedimo et al defined non-rebounders as

Page 4 of 5

patients who had a VL below 3,7log at least 6 months
after treatment interruption while we defined SC as
patients who had a VL below 3log. In Bedimo’s cohort
27% of patients were non-rebounders and peak VL prior
to HAART was predictive of non-rebounder status. In
contrast, the SC we identified had a VL prior to starting
HAART that was in the range of VL of rebounders
which we defined as having a VL > 3 log 6 months after
HAART cessation. In our study VL before HAART
initiation seemed thus not to be associated with control
of viral replication after treatment cessation.
One possible explanation for the SC status is that
deleterious mutations have been induced in the virus by
HAART. However, sequencing of the major structural
genes of the 2 available viruses did not reveal any
obvious defects. Virus could be cultivated in patient 1
only, but patient 2 had a spontaneous “in vivo” blip. We
hypothesize that these replication competent viruses are
less fit and/or are kept under control by the patient’s
immune system. Indeed, as shown in Figure 1, virus
from patient 1 was less fit than the viruses from rebounders and the two reference strains BAL and IIIB. The
fact that the virus from patient 2 could not be cultivated
in vitro under conditions that easily allow virus growth
in all other patients is also an implicit proof of lower
fitness.
Markers of immune activation are more disturbed in
patients with rapid progression and closer to normal in
EC [12,13]. Neopterin and b2 microglobulin have also
been shown to predict disease progression, especially in
late stage HIV-1 infection [14-16]. However, we did not
find any differences between SC and rebounders, in
levels of immune activation before initiating therapy,
during therapy and after treatment cessation, suggesting
that immune activation does not play a role in SC
status.
Research on EC is very active because these patients
may give clues for novel approaches to the development
of a preventive HIV vaccine. Research on immune function in the secondary controllers in this study is
ongoing; as we believe that they might provide new
insights about correlates of protection and be useful for
the development of therapeutic vaccines.

Authors’ information
EVG is a postdoc at the Institute of Tropical medicine. During her PhD she
was trying to develop a therapeutic vaccination against HIV based on
dendritic cells electroporated with mRNA encoding HIV Gag. In this studies
patients on HAART were vaccinated with these DC. After vaccination it is the
goal that they stop treatment and control the virus. Therefore these patients
are so special because they can do it without vaccination. If we can find out
why than we know to which parameter we have to look for protection in a
therapeutic vaccination. AB, EF, GV are clinicians. EF is really working in the
clinic and seeing patients. AB and GV are more interested in research. For EF
is it also important if we can unravel why these patients control the virus
after treatment interruption, maybe more patients can go on drug holiday.
