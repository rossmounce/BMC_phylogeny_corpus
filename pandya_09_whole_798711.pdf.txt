Abstract
Background: A low genetic diversity in Francisella tularensis has been documented. Current DNA based
genotyping methods for typing F. tularensis offer a limited and varying degree of subspecies, clade and strain level
discrimination power. Whole genome sequencing is the most accurate and reliable method to identify, type and
determine phylogenetic relationships among strains of a species. However, lower cost typing schemes are
necessary in order to enable typing of hundreds or even thousands of isolates.
Results: We have generated a high-resolution phylogenetic tree from 40 Francisella isolates, including 13 F.
tularensis subspecies holarctica (type B) strains, 26 F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (type A) strains and a single F.
novicida strain. The tree was generated from global multi-strain single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
collected using a set of six Affymetrix GeneChip® resequencing arrays with the non-repetitive portion of LVS
(type B) as the reference sequence complemented with unique sequences of SCHU S4 (type A). Global SNP based
phylogenetic clustering was able to resolve all non-related strains. The phylogenetic tree was used to guide the
selection of informative SNPs specific to major nodes in the tree for development of a genotyping assay for
identification of F. tularensis subspecies and clades. We designed and validated an assay that uses these SNPs to
accurately genotype 39 additional F. tularensis strains as type A (A1, A2, A1a or A1b) or type B (B1 or B2).
Conclusion: Whole-genome SNP based clustering was shown to accurately identify SNPs for differentiation of
F. tularensis subspecies and clades, emphasizing the potential power and utility of this methodology for selecting
SNPs for typing of F. tularensis to the strain level. Additionally, whole genome sequence based SNP information
gained from a representative population of strains may be used to perform evolutionary or phylogenetic
comparisons of strains, or selection of unique strains for whole-genome sequencing projects.

Background
Francisella tularensis, a Gram-negative bacterium, is the
causative agent of tularemia and a Category A select agent.
F. tularensis is divided into three subspecies (subsp.): tularensis (type A); holarctica (type B); and mediasiatica [1,2].
Tularemia caused by type A strains occurs only in North
America, whereas tularemia caused by type B strains
occurs throughout the northern hemisphere. Together
these two species account for the majority of cases of
tularemia worldwide. F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica
includes strains predominant in central Asia [3]. F. novicida has been suggested to be a subspecies of F. tularensis
based on genetic similarity [4,5], but is still formally recognized as a distinct species. F. novicida has been isolated
from North America and Australia, and rarely causes
human disease even though it can cause a lethal infection
in the murine model of disease [3,6].
Current DNA based genotyping methods for typing F.
tularensis offer a varying degree of power to discriminate
subspecies, clades and strains [2,7,8]. Two clades, A1 and
A2, within F. tularensis subsp. tularensis have been
reported based on multiple subtyping methods including
multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis
(MLVA), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and
multi-locus sequence typing [2]. Clades within A1, A1a
and A1b, have been identified by PFGE [9]. A limited
degree of variation has been observed within type B
strains by all methods. MLVA currently provides the highest degree of strain discrimination for F. tularensis, however it is limited in its ability to perform evolutionary
analyses and to estimate relationships among very closely
related strains [10].
Development of high-resolution genotyping methods for
F. tularensis can ideally be met by whole genome sequencing of multiple strains. Whole genome sequencing is the
most accurate and reliable method to identify and discriminate strains of a species, especially those species with
a high degree of genome homogeneity. Genomic
sequence information of several type A and B strains is
now available http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/ent
rez?db=genomeprj&orig_db=&term=Fran
cisella%20tularensis&cmd=Search. F. tularensis has a single
circular chromosome with genome size of ~1.89 Mb. Naturally occurring plasmids have not been reported for F.
tularensis strains so far. A low genetic diversity in F. tularensis has been documented. Based on whole genome
sequencing, the genetic variation between the type B live
vaccine strain (LVS) and two other type B strains, FSC200
and OSU18, is only 0.08% and 0.11% respectively. F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strain FSC200 is a virulent strain of
European origin whereas F. tularensis subsp. holarctica
strain OSU18 is a virulent strain isolated in the United
States. A higher genetic variation of 0.7% has been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/213

reported between a type B (LVS) and type A (SCHU S4)
strain [11]. Global single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) information, based on whole genome sequencing,
offers several advantages over existing typing methods
because each individual nucleotide may be a useful
genetic character. The cumulative differences in two or
more sequences provide a larger number of discriminators
that can be used to genotype and distinguish bacterial
strains. Strain genotypes that are built upon SNP variation
are highly amenable to evolutionary reconstruction and
can be readily analyzed in a phylogenetic and population
genetic context to: i) assign unknown strains into wellcharacterized clusters; ii) reveal closely related siblings of
a particular strain; and iii) examine the prevalence of a
specific allele in a population of closely related strains that
may in turn correlate with phenotypic features of the
infectious agent [12]. SNPs also provide potential markers
for the purpose of strain identification important for
forensic and epidemiological investigations.
Previously, we reported an Affymetrix GeneChip® based
approach for whole genome F. tularensis resequencing and
global SNP determination [13]. We now report the whole
genome sequence and global SNP data from 40 Francisella
strains using this approach. Twenty six F. tularensis type A
(20 A1 and 6 A2), thirteen F. tularensis type B and one F.
novicida strain were used for phylogenetic SNP analysis
and identification of high-quality SNPs for use as typing
markers. Based on our global analysis of 40 genomes, we
were able to identify a series of SNPs at various levels of
hierarchy. We used these SNPs to develop and validate a
low-cost PCR-based assay for typing and discriminating F.
tularensis isolates.

Methods
Francisella strains
Francisella strains used for whole genome sequencing are
listed in Table 1. Strains used for evaluation of diagnostic
SNP markers are shown in Table 2. All strains were identified as either type A or type B by glycerol fermentation or
PCR. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis using PmeI was performed for CDC strains to characterize type A strains as
either A1, A2, A1a or A1b [14]. Ribotyping, using the
Dupont Qualicon RiboPrinter and PvuII restriction
enzyme, was used to characterize USAMRIID type A
strains as A1 or A2 (USAMRIID, unpublished method).
Francisella genomic DNA
Genomic DNAs of F. tularensis reference strains LVS and
SCHU S4 were obtained from Dr. Luther Lindler of Global
Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System of
Department of Defense. Genomic DNA was isolated from
the strains in Table 1 and Table 2 using the QIAamp DNA
mini kit or Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,

Genomic DNA samples were stored at -80°C.
F. tularensis custom resequencing array set
The basis of the Affymetrix GeneChip® resequencing by
hybridization and the details of the design of F. tularensis
GeneChip® set has been described earlier [13]. Briefly, the
design is primarily on the basis of the DNA sequence of
strain LVS (GenBank Accession: AM 233362) serving as a
reference and complemented with unique sequences of
SCHU S4 (GenBank Accession: AJ 749949). A total of
1,764,558 queryable bases were identified for resequencing by hybridization after exclusion of ~9.22% of repetitive sequence from the design. This sequence was tiled
onto a set of six CustomSeq 300 K GeneChips® by Affymetrix, Inc., (Santa Clara, CA). This design provides approximately 91% of the F. tularensis double stranded genome
sequence information from holarctica (type B) and tularensis (type A) subspecies. The whole genome resequencing
was performed in duplicate for all query strains.
Whole genome amplification, resequencing assay and raw
data acquisition
Francisella genomic DNA amplification, DNA fragmentation, labeling, hybridization and acquisition of raw data
was carried out exactly as described earlier [13].

Processing of raw data with bioinformatic filters
Hybridization of a whole-genome sample on an Affymetrix® resequencing array platform can lead to incorrect
basecalls due to a number of systematic effects that are less
prevalent when the sample consists of a purified PCR
product. We have developed bioinformatic filters to
account for most of these predictable adverse effects. Our
bioinformatic filters consist of a set of Perl scripts that
operate on the CHP files generated by GSEQ software and
produce a list of high-confidence SNP calls from the larger
raw set of SNPs calls present in those files. The scripts are
available for download from our website http://
pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/compare_genomics/
snp_scripts.html. Each filter serves to reduce the number
of candidate SNPs. The output of one filtering step
becomes the input for the next. The detailed descriptions
of these filters have been reported [13].

Briefly, the quality filter implemented in GSEQ software
initially eliminates SNP calls that have been assigned low
quality scores based on the difference in signal intensity
between the highest intensity probe pair and the next
highest intensity pair at a particular locus. The first filter
applied is the "low homology filter" which identified
regions that performed poorly as a result of deletions in
the sample relative to the reference sequence. The base
calls from the CHP files from GSEQ software are scanned
to identify regions of adjacent positions that are rich in

no-calls and SNP calls. SNP calls that occur within the
defined low homology region are removed from the list of
high-confidence SNP calls. The next script is referred to as
the alternate homology filter. The alternate homology
effect is caused by the sequences in the query DNA sample
capable of hybridizing with high efficiency to more than
one probe pair at a locus on the array. When a locus contains two strongly hybridizing probe pairs, the GSEQ software may make a SNP call, a reference base call or a nocall ("N"), depending on the relative signal strengths of
the probe pairs. The alternate homology filter identifies
SNP calls that may have arisen as a result of this effect
based on the difference in binding energy between the
alternate (SNP) sequence and the reference sequence. If
the difference between these two binding energies is =
11.5 kcal/mol, the SNP call is assumed to be an artifact of
the alternate sequence homology, and it is removed from
the list of high confidence SNP calls. The remaining SNP
calls are then put through the footprint effect filter. The
artifact called the footprint effect is caused by the occurrence of a real SNP in a query sample that results in a
destabilizing effect on 25-mers in the immediate vicinity
of the SNP. The footprint effect filter algorithm assumes
that a genuine SNP is most likely to cause spurious SNP
calls at locations within 10 bases on either side of the genuine SNP. Any SNP call that occurs more than 10 base
positions from the nearest neighboring SNP call is
assumed to be valid, and any SNP call that has one or
more neighbors within 10 base positions is subjected to
the filter. Since any number of consecutive SNP calls
within 10 base positions of each other may occur in the
data, this filter is implemented as a recursive algorithm.

For each list of consecutive SNP calls that each lies within
10 bases of its neighbors, the algorithm identifies the SNP
call having the highest quality score. That SNP call is
accepted as valid, and its immediate neighbors are
removed from the list of high confidence SNP calls. This
action may break the original list of neighboring SNP calls
into two separate lists. All resulting lists are processed
recursively in the same way, until all of the SNP calls have
been accepted or rejected. This algorithm is implemented
in the RemoveFootprintEffect.pl Perl program. All the
above filters are applied to individual data sets generated
for any sample, following which a final filter referred to as
the replicate combination filter is applied. The replicate
combination filter generates the list of common SNPs
present in both the experiments.
Phylogenetic clustering, selection of SNP markers and PCR
primer design from multistrain global Francisella SNP
collection
We generated a phylogenetic tree from the resequencing
data by considering only those locations at which a SNP
occurred in one or more of the forty strains. For each
strain, we constructed a sequence containing the base calls
at each of the locations at which a SNP was found in some
strain(s). This resulted in forty sequences, each containing
19,897 base calls (including no-calls) which were used for
the phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the MrBayes program, version 3.1.2 [15-17].
The program was run for 200,000 generations, using a
haploid model. The root of the resulting tree was inferred
by midpoint rooting. The resulting tree is reported as a
cladogram and as a phylogram. A phylogenetic tree (Addi-

tional File 1) was also generated from the same data using
the dnaml (maximum likelihood) program of the PHYLIP
package version 3.6 [18].
Node pairings which discriminated between subspecies or
clades were selected for the development of diagnostic
typing assays. Criteria used to select SNP locations for the
assay were:
1. The SNP location must cleanly differentiate the two
nodes of interest. Within each of the nodes, all of the
member strains must share the same base call at the
location, and the two nodes must differ at the location.
2. The sequences downstream of the SNP location
must be in sufficient agreement among all strains from
both nodes so that an appropriate primer can be chosen from the consensus sequence (the consensus at the
primer location may not contain "N" calls or any conflicting base calls).
3. The primer sequences must have melting temperatures within a specific limited range (60°C to 70°C).
4. The predicted PCR product size must be within the
range 150 to 500 bp.
We developed a set of programs to identify candidate SNP
locations for the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay. SNPTree
uses the phylogenetic tree and the multi-FASTA files from
the resequencing experiments as input, assigns arbitrary
node numbers to all nodes in the tree, and produces a set
of multi-FASTA files, one for each node in the tree, of the
consensus base calls for each node. The consensus call is
"N" unless all members of a particular node share the
same base call at that location. The program also produces
a set of files, one for each node, listing the base calls that
occur at every SNP location, for all SNP positions detected
within the entire set of 40 samples (19,897 locations). The
program CompareNodes uses the SNP list files for any
two nodes and produces a list of SNP locations that
cleanly differentiate the two nodes (described above). The
program CreatePrimer3 uses a list of discriminating SNP
locations and the multi-FASTA files for two nodes, and
creates an input file for the Primer3 program [19].
CreatePrimer3 also chooses the 5'-forward primers, which
are constrained by the locations of the SNPs. The Primer3
software [19] is then used to identify appropriate 3'reverse primers. The Primer3 program enforces the last
three criteria listed above. This process resulted in the
design of a large number of primers for candidate SNP

used was selected manually by identifying primers distrib-

uted over the entire genome. The programs SNPTree,
CompareNodes and CreatePrimer3 were developed at the
J. Craig Venter Institute specifically for this study and are
freely available for download ftp://ftp.jcvi.org/pub/soft
ware/pfgrc/SNPTree/SNPTreePackage.tar.gz. These programs along with our bioinformatic filter pipeline can easily be adapted for other bacterial model systems for whole
genome resequencing and SNP phylogeny using the
Affymetrix resequencing array platform.
Primer3 software was used to design discriminating PCR
primers based on the set of discriminating locations identified. Three primers were designed at each discriminating
location: a 5'-forward primer with the node X call in the 3'
position; a 5'-forward primer with the node Y call in the 3'
position; and a single 3'-reverse primer. A base call at the
discriminating location is determined by two PCR reactions where one of the two yields a lower cycle threshold
(Ct) value. The RT-PCR primers used are shown in Additional File 2.
Real-time PCR assays for F. tularensis typing
Real-time PCR assays to identify F. tularensis subspecies
and clades were developed using SYBR® Green (BioRad,
Hercules CA) which binds all dsDNA molecules, emitting
a fluorescent signal of a defined wavelength (522 nm).
Reactions were performed in 20 μl volume and contained
80 pg of genomic DNA (0.01 ng/μl), 150 nM of forward
and reverse primers and 10 μl of iQ SYBR® Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules CA). Reaction components were
mixed in a V-bottom thin wall PCR 96-well plate (BioRad,
Hercules CA). Real-time PCR was performed using the
iCycler iQ (BioRad, Hercules, CA) with the following thermal cycling parameters: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 5 min,
60 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 68°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds, 95°C for 1 min and finally
55°C for 3 min. The fluorescence was measured at 72°C
in the cycle program. A cycle threshold (Ct) was automatically generated by the iCycler iQ Version 3.0a analysis
software for each amplification reaction (BioRad, Hercules CA). Melt curve analysis was performed to verify that
no primer dimers formed.

Results
Whole genome resequencing of strains
Previously, we reported an Affymetrix Inc. GeneChip®
array based whole genome resequencing platform for F.
tularensis. Our whole-genome sequencing by hybridization approach made use of a set of bioinformatic filters to
eliminate a majority of false positives and indicated a base
call accuracy of 99.999% (Phred equivalent score 50) for
type B strain LVS [13]. The base call accuracy was determined by comparing the base calls remaining after the
application of our filters to the published sequence of the
LVS strain. The bioinformatic filter programs may be

compare_genomics/snp_scripts.html. Two type A strains,
WY96 3418 and SCHU S4 showed base call accuracies of
99.995% and 99.992% with Phred equivalent scores of 43
and 41 respectively [13]. We used this approach to collect
whole-genome sequence and global SNP information
from 40 Francisella strains. Table 1 shows the list of strains
analyzed in this study. Twenty six type A (20 A1 and 6 A2),
thirteen type B and one F. novicida strain were resequenced.
The base call rate and number of SNPs for F. tularensis A1,
A2 and type B strains are shown in Figure 1 and Additional File 3. The base call rate for all forty strains was in
the range of 83.04% to 97.92%. This range improved to
92.43% - 97.92% when the F. novicida strain FRAN003
(base call rate of 83.041% and total SNPs 12407) was
excluded. The whole genome resequencing call rate was in
the range of 94.62% to 97.62% for A1 strains, 92.43% to
97.41% for A2 strains and 94.04% to 97.92% for type B
strains. Overall, type B strains displayed the highest average base call rate of 95.97% ± 1.06% and A2 displayed the
lowest with 94.40% ± 0.64%. The average base call rate for
A1 strains was 95.87% ± 0.64%. The total number of SNPs
for all forty strains ranged widely from 15 to 12,407. As
expected FRAN003, the F. novicida strain, displayed the
highest number of SNPs (12,407) compared to the F. tularensis reference (LVS + SCHU S4) sequence. The wide
range in SNP differences was reduced almost by half, 15
to 6543, when the F. novicida sequence was excluded.
F. tularensis type B strains displayed the lowest number of
SNPs, ranging from 15 to 2915. As expected, LVS strains
(LVS and FRAN004) showed the fewest SNP positions
(15-16) when compared to the reference sequence. The
genomes of all other type B strains, except for FRAN024,
contained 497 - 605 SNPs, when compared to the reference sequence. FRAN024 showed a significantly higher
number of SNPs (2915) compared to other type B strains.
FRAN024 is a Japanese holarctica strain. It has been
reported that the F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates
from Japan are unique, being somewhat intermediate to
F. tularensis subsp. tularensis and the other F. tularensis
subsp. holarctica isolates [20,21]. A1 strains showed the
highest number of SNPs when compared to the reference
sequence with a range of 5929 to 6543 whereas A2 strains
displayed a range of 4732 to 5469 SNPs. The average
number of SNPs for A1 strains was 6362 ± 161 and 5096
± 281 for A2 strains.
Whole genome phylogenetic clustering of strains and SNP
analysis
The cladogram and phylogram generated from the wholegenome resequence SNP data of all 40 Francisella strains is
shown in Figure 2. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/213

clustering of the strains into the two subspecies, type A
and type B, with further separation of strains within clusters. F. novicida (FRAN003) was distinct from type A and
type B and formed its own phylogenetic group. Nodes
(including internal nodes and leaf nodes) of the phylogenetic tree were assigned numbers by the SNPTree program. All type A strains emerged from node 4, whereas all
type B strains emerged from node 50. The type A strains
were divided into two primary sub-nodes, node 39 and
node 5, corresponding to clades A2 and A1 respectively.
A1 strains further subdivided into node 8, node 23, and
node 5, corresponding to clades A1a and A1b and the
MA00-2987 strain, respectively (Table 1). SCHU S4, the
laboratory type A strain, fell within the A1a clade (node
8). Type B strains also divided into two clades based on
nodes 52 and 64; these clades are referred to here as B1
and B2, respectively. The Japanese holarctica isolate
FRAN024 formed its own phylogenetic group. Subsections of the phylogenetic tree at higher resolution, representing the type A1 (excluding MA00-2987), A2 and B
strains (excluding FRAN024) are shown in Figure 3.
Within type A nodes, strains originating from distinct geographic locations (WY96 3418, CA02 0099, UT02 1927,
KS00 1817, MA00 2987, AR01 1117, OK00 2732) with no
known link to one another were clearly resolved by whole
genome SNP based phylogenetic clustering (Figure 3,
Table 1). This method also showed high potential for differentiating between closely related F. tularensis strains.
The A1a strains, SCHU S4, FRAN023, FRAN031,
FRAN032, FRAN026, FRAN030, and FRAN033 all originate from the same temporal location (Ohio) in the
1940's (Figure 3, Table 1). FRAN031 and FRAN032 could
not be distinguished on the basis of SNPs, suggesting they
may represent the same strain. Similarly, the A1b strains,
FRAN005, FRAN006, FRAN007, FRAN008, FRAN009,
FRAN010, FRAN014, and FRAN015 all derive from cottontail rabbit from one state park in Illinois, with 5 or
fewer SNP differences distinguishing these strains (Figure
3, Table 1). The A2 strains, FRAN001, FRAN027 and
FRAN028, were considered likely derivatives of the avirulent strain 38 (Jellison); SNP based phylogenetic clustering confirms this assumption (Figure 3, Table 1).
Within type B nodes, strains from Russia and North America were associated with node 64 (B2 strains), whereas
only strains derived from North America (B1 strains) were
associated with node 52 (Figure 3, Table 1). Overall, all
unique type B strains (FRAN029, OR96 0246, OR96
0463, FRAN025, KY99 3387, CA99 3992, FRAN012, IN00
2758, KY00 1708 and MO01 1673) were resolved using
whole genome SNP analysis.
Table 3 summarizes the SNP content for each of the major
nodes identified in our phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2).

Figure genome SNP based phylogenetic analysis of Francisella strains
Whole 2
Whole genome SNP based phylogenetic analysis of Francisella strains. Phylogenetic analysis of resequenced Francisella strains. The whole-genome resequencing data was pared down to those base positions at which a SNP call occurred in
one or more of the forty strains. These sequences were used to generate a phylogenetic tree using the MrBayes program as
described in methods. This tree was then displayed as a cladogram (A) and as a phylogram (B) using the TreeView program
http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html. Distinct clustering of type A and type B strains was observed. Both type
A and B strains were further discriminated within the clusters. In the cladogram, the percentage values on the branches are the
probabilities of the partitions indicated by each branch. The numbers shown in red are node numbers of significant nodes that
are referenced in the manuscript. In the phylogram, the branch lengths are proportional to the mean of the posterior probability density, and a scale bar is given to relate the branch lengths to their numeric values.
The differentiating SNPs and maximum SNP separation
numbers are indicators of the diversity within each node,
as these represent SNP differences between members of
the node (rather than SNP differences relative to the reference genome). The differentiating SNPs are the number of
locations at which two or more member strains have differing base calls. Maximum SNP separation is the maximum number of SNP differences that are found between
any two members of the node. As expected, the SNP diversity is greatest within subspecies (type A and type B) and

decreases within clades; B1, A1a and A1b strains showed
the least diversity (maximum SNP separation of 76, 75
and 38, respectively). Typing methods have previously
revealed less diversity within type B than type A strains
[2,21-23]. Similarly, our data show less diversity among
type B isolates, with a maximum SNP separation of 602
when the Japanese holarctica strain FRAN024 is excluded
from this analysis (B*). However, when all type B isolates,
including the Japanese holarctica strain FRAN024, are
included in the analysis, our data indicates a similar level

of diversity for types A and B (maximum SNP separation
of 2779 and 2833, respectively).
The presence of a large number of differentiating SNPs
within each phylogenetic node suggests that a deeper level
of discrimination can be achieved by identifying SNPs
unique to individual strains. The smallest number of differentiating SNPs within a phylogenetic node was 71 (A1b
strains). The phylogram (Figure 2B) indicates that the
closest clade pairings are between A1a/A1b and B1/B2
which is quantitatively in agreement with the SNP differences as shown in Additional File 4. Phylogenetic analyses
performed by two independent approaches (Bayesian in
Figure 2 and maximum likelihood in Additional File 1)
showed some differences only at the level of minor clades
in the trees. These did not affect the subsequent analyses.
Typing assays based on high quality global SNP markers
Node pairings that discriminated between F. tularensis
subspecies or within subspecies were selected for the
development of SNP diagnostic typing assays (Figure 2).
The four node pairings were node 4 and node 50, node 52
and node 64, node 39 and node 5, and node 8 and node
23 for discrimination of type A vs. type B, B1 vs. B2, A2 vs.

A1 and A1a vs. A1b, respectively. A SNP location was
selected to differentiate between two nodes in the tree
when all strains belonging to one node contain the SNP
call and all strains belonging to the other node contain the
reference call at that location. The location of the 32 in silico identified diagnostic SNP markers in the F. tularensis
LVS genome are shown in Figure 4. Fourteen SNP loci
were in the forward strand, sixteen in the reverse and two
loci were in non-coding intergenic regions. The discriminating nodes, SNP location, locus name, gene symbol
with product and the role category is described in the
Additional File 5.
To show that SNPs can be used as diagnostic markers for
typing of F. tularensis subspecies and clades, RT-PCR
assays were designed. Initially, seven F. tularensis strains
were used to screenthe 32 RT-PCR discriminatory SNP
positions for the ability to distinguish type A vs. type B, A1
vs. A2, A1a vs. A1b, and B1 vs. B2. Preliminary results
indicated 5 out of 9 primer sets (684048, 917759,
1014623, 1136971, 1581977) distinguished type A and
type B, 3 out of 9 primer sets distinguished A1 and A2
(521982, 1025460, 1507435), 2 out of 5 primers sets distinguished A1a and A1b (518892, 1574929) and 3 out of

Total SNPs are locations at which a SNP occurs in one or more strains in the node (if the same SNP occurs in more than one strain, that location
is counted only once). Common SNPs are locations where all strains in the node share the same base call, which is different from the reference call
on the resequencing platform. Unique SNPs are locations where just a single strain in the node has a base call that differs from the reference
sequence. Differentiating SNPs are locations at which at least two strains in the node have different base calls. Maximum SNP separation is the
number of base calls separating the two most distant members of the node. Differentiating SNPs and maximum SNP separation are both indicators
of the degree of diversity within the node. The detection of diversity is limited by the extent to which our sample set is representative of the
variability within each clade in nature. Refer to Figure 2 for the details of strain clustering.

9 primer sets distinguished B1 and B2 (299153, 470635,
1011425). The two primer sets from each group displaying the largest difference in Ct values (shown in bold)
were pursued further (1014623, 1136971, 521982,
1507435, 518892, 1574929, 299153 and 470635). To
determine the robustness of these discriminatory SNP
positions, an additional 39 F. tularensis strains (23 type A,
16 type B) (Table 2) were examined.
The data for 4 primer sets (1014623, 521982, 299153 and
1574929) is shown in Figure 5. These assays are hierarchical in nature. The first primer set determines whether a
strain is type A or type B based on SNP 1014623. In type
A and type B strains, this nucleotide position is T and C,
respectively. A strain identified as type B can be further
typed as B1 or B2 based on SNP 299153 (G in B1 strains
and T in B2 strains). Similarly, strains identified as type A
can be classified as A1 or A2 based on SNP 521982 (T in
A1 strains and C in A2 strains) and A1 strains further characterized as A1a or A1b by SNP 1574929 (G in A1a strains
and C in A1b strains).
As shown in Figure 5, the type A and type B SNP assay
clearly distinguished between the 23 type A and 16 type B
strains. The 23 type A strains were then subdivided into 15

A1 and 8 A2 strains and the 15 A1 strains were subsequently further sub-divided into 8 A1a and 7 A1b strains.
For all 23 type A strains, the classification of strains as A1,
A2, A1a or A1b by diagnostic SNP typing corresponds
with PmeI PFGE typing results (Table 2) [14], emphasizing the power and the utility of this simpler methodology
for classification of type A clades.
Type B strains were also resolved into B1 and B2 clades
based on a single SNP. As these clades were newly identified by our SNP based phylogenetic clustering, resequenced B1 (KY00 1708 and MO01-1673) and B2 (LVS,
OR96 0246) strains were included as positive controls. Of
the 16 type B strains tested, nine isolates were classified as
B2 and 7 isolates were classified as B1. Isolates from Russia (RC 503), Spain (SP03 1782 and SP98 2108) Finland
(SP03 1783) and the US were identified as B2 by this
assay, whereas isolates from Canada and the US were
identified as B1, providing evidence for geographic clustering of type B isolates based on this SNP marker. In summary, this work shows the potential for development of
SNP typing markers based on a relatively small number of
"complete" genome sequences. For future work, it will be
important to define a set of SNPs that could be used for
high-resolution discrimination to the strain level.

Discussion
Whole genome comparative analysis and collection of
high-confidence global SNPs from multiple strains of a
given bacterial species has a number of applications in
both basic and translational research. Our study was
undertaken with an objective of providing the scientific
community with whole-genome sequence and SNP information from multiple strains of F. tularensis, enabling
rapid advancements in our understanding of basic and
applied biology of this organism. F. tularensis has been
recognized as a causative agent of tularemia for almost a
century [24] and is classified as a category A biodefense
agent. We have collected nearly complete (~91%) genome
sequence and global SNP information from forty Francisella strains using our whole genome high-density resequencing array platform [13]. All the sequence and SNP
information is publicly available to the scientific community from Biodefense and Public Health Database (BioHealthBase) at http://www.biohealthbase.org/GSearch/
home.do?decorator=Francisella. BioHealthBase is a Bio-

informatics Resource Center (BRC) for biodefense and
emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases that is supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID). The data can also be obtained from our
web
site
at
http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/
compare_genomics/francisella_genotyping.html
or
through the JCVI ftp server at ftp://ftp.jcvi.org/pub/data/
PFGRC/Ft_DataRelease/. This multi-strain high-quality
nearly complete genome sequence and global SNP information provides a unique opportunity to perform comparative genome analysis between F. tularensis strains,
thus contributing towards a better understanding of pathogenicity and evolutionary relationships of this species.
We have used this information to build a robust whole
genome based phylogeny that enabled the identification
of SNP discriminatory markers. We further validated high
quality global SNP markers for typing of F. tularensis subspecies and clades as a proof of concept that these markers
may be used for future development of high-resolution
typing methods.

Previous reports have suggested that greater genetic diversity exists among type A as compared to type B strains [2].
Our whole genome SNP based analysis of 12 type B isolates from North America and Russia appears to confirm
this observation. However, SNP data obtained after inclusion of a Japanese type B strain (FRAN024) indicated a
similar level of SNP diversity in type A and type B strains
(Table 3). Sufficient SNP diversity was observed among
type B strains to generate an internal structure in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) as well as to resolve all unique
strains. The single F. novicida isolate in our study,

FRAN003 (U112), had the lowest base call rate
(83.041%) and the highest number of SNPs (12,407)
among our samples. The low base call rate is a likely
reflection of the sequence divergence between the F. novicida strain (U112) and the reference sequence on our resequencing chips. Rohmer et. al[11]. have reported a
nucleotide sequence identity of 97.8% between the LVS
and F. novicida U112 genomes. The differences in these
two approaches may be due to the fact that array-based
resequencing is sensitive to sequence divergence, and performs best with samples that are homologous with the ref-

erence sequence. In our global SNP phylogenetic analysis,
F. novicida (U112) is well separated from the F. tularensis
isolates (Figure 2B).
A number of molecular approaches have been used to better understand the diversity of Francisella [2,21,25-27].
New subdivisions within F. tularensis subspecies have
been revealed by these approaches. Differing methods
provide differing resolution as most of the methods sample only a subset of the whole genome in order to assess
relationships among different isolates [2]. MLVA is considered to provide the highest discriminatory power (i.e.
strain level) [2,21,28]. PFGE typing has been used to identify four distinct type A genotypes, A1a, A1b, A2a and A2b
[9], not previously observed by MLVA typing. PFGE typing
combined with epidemiologic data revealed that the
observed genetic diversity among type A strains correlated
with differences in clinical outcome and geographic distribution. A1b strains were associated with significantly
higher mortality in humans as compared to A1a, A2 or
type B strains. Type B strains display little or no genetic
diversity by PFGE [14] and a number of other molecular
methods [2,10,21-23].
Comparative whole-genome sequence analysis provides
the highest level of discrimination among different
strains, but has not been widely used due to the high cost
of this method. Keim et al [2] have shown a wholegenome SNP phylogeny of Francisella using ~8000 syntenic SNPs from the published whole genome sequences
of seven strains. Use of only two type A and two type B
genomes was sufficient to reveal that type A strains differ
greatly from each other unlike type B strains. More
recently, the phylogenetic structure of F. tularensis has
been reported based on whole genome SNP analysis of
thirteen publicly available genome sequences; 29,774
SNPs were used in this analysis [4]. In this study, we have
constructed a phylogenetic profile of forty Francisella
strains based on whole genome sequences. This to our
knowledge is the first report of a phylogenetic model
based on nearly complete genomes of multiple strains of
F. tularensis using Affymetrix resequencing arrays.
We have demonstrated that resequencing data may be
used to generate high-resolution phylogenetic trees based
on global SNPs. The advantage of this sequence-based
approach is that SNP based phylogenetic trees can be used
for evolutionary analyses. The comparative analysis based
on the phylogenetic relatedness of strains can provide significant insights into the varying degree of phenotypes
and ecotypes of an organism. The total number of complete genomes required to achieve an optimum phylogenetic profile from the multiple strains of an organism will
be determined by the degree of plasticity of the genome.
Adequate phylogenetic relationship can be determined

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/213

with a sufficient number of genomes from diverse isolates
of an organism and the whole genome comparative analysis of such related strains can provide real biological
insights into the adaptation and evolution of a species.
Such phylogenetic-based comparative analysis can capture genomic differences of very closely related strains and
provide valuable information for the development of
rapid molecular sequence based assays, capable of discrimination to the strain level.

Conclusion
The whole genome resequencing array platform provides
sequence and SNP information from multiple strains for
any infectious agent with an available whole genome
sequence. Multi-strain whole genome sequence data
allows one to build robust phylogenetic models for an
organism based on global SNPs. Whole genome SNP
based phylogenetic trees can guide meaningful comparative analysis of strains to better understand the biology of
an organism as well as in translational research such as in
developing high resolution economical SNP based typing
assays. We have collected whole genome sequence and
SNP information from forty strains of Francisella to construct a global phylogeny. Our data shows a good correlation with the previously published reports using limited
genomic sequence information and also provides higher
strain resolution. We used the whole genome SNP phylogeny to identify informative SNP markers specific to major
nodes in the tree and to develop a genotyping assay for
subspecies and clades of F. tularensis strains. Less diverse
type B strains could even be discriminated into two clades,
B1 and B2, based on a single SNP. Our whole genome
SNP based phylogenetic clustering shows high potential
for identifying SNP markers within F. tularensis capable of
discriminating to the strain level. This finding should
greatly facilitate the rapid and low-cost typing of F. tularensis strains in the future.
