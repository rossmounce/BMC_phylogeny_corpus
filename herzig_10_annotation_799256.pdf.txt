Annotation and classification of the bovine T cell
receptor delta genes
Carolyn TA Herzig1,4*, Marie-Paule Lefranc2, Cynthia L Baldwin1,3

Abstract
Background: gδ T cells differ from ab T cells with regard to the types of antigen with which their T cell receptors
interact; gδ T cell antigens are not necessarily peptides nor are they presented on MHC. Cattle are considered a “gδ
T cell high” species indicating they have an increased proportion of gδ T cells in circulation relative to that in “gδ
T cell low” species such as humans and mice. Prior to the onset of the studies described here, there was limited
information regarding the genes that code for the T cell receptor delta chains of this gδ T cell high species.
Results: By annotating the bovine (Bos taurus) genome Btau_3.1 assembly the presence of 56 distinct T cell
receptor delta (TRD) variable (V) genes were found, 52 of which belong to the TRDV1 subgroup and were comingled with the T cell receptor alpha variable (TRAV) genes. In addition, two genes belonging to the TRDV2
subgroup and single TRDV3 and TRDV4 genes were found. We confirmed the presence of five diversity (D) genes,
three junctional (J) genes and a single constant (C) gene and describe the organization of the TRD locus. The
TRDV4 gene is found downstream of the C gene and in an inverted orientation of transcription, consistent with its
orthologs in humans and mice. cDNA evidence was assessed to validate expression of the variable genes and
showed that one to five D genes could be incorporated into a single transcript. Finally, we grouped the bovine
and ovine TRDV1 genes into sets based on their relatedness.
Conclusions: The bovine genome contains a large and diverse repertoire of TRD genes when compared to the
genomes of “gδ T cell low” species. This suggests that in cattle gδ T cells play a more important role in immune
function since they would be predicted to bind a greater variety of antigens.

Background
T lymphocytes can be subdivided into at least two types
based on the expression of either the ab or gδ T cell
receptor. Although both perceive antigen, they differ in
the types of antigens with which they react. ab T cell
receptors react with antigenic protein peptides in the
context of self major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
proteins while gδ T cell receptors may react with proteins but this does not involve MHC presentation. They
also react with autologous molecules on cells [1-6] as
well as nonproteinaceous molecules [7]. The gene repertoires that code for the gδ T cell receptor chains and
the T cell receptor gamma (TRG) and delta (TRD) gene
locus organizations have been extensively described for
humans and mice but to a lesser extent for the artiodactyls which includes ruminants and swine. These latter

are “gδ T cell high” species because of their high levels
of gδ T cells in circulation ("gδ T cell low” species exhibit much lower levels of gδ T cells in circulation). It is
clear that while both ab and gδ T cells have large and
diverse T cell receptor gene repertoires [8-14], “gδ T cell
high” species have a TRD gene repertoire that is much
more extensive than that in the “gδ T cell low” species
[15-21]. The bovine (Bos taurus) locus organization and
TRD gene repertoire are the subject of this work.
T cell receptor delta and beta chains are encoded by
the rearrangement of variable (V), joining (J) and diversity (D) genes making them more complex than the
T cell receptor gamma and alpha chains which lack
D gene products. In all mammals evaluated the genes
encoding the T cell receptor beta and gamma chains are
found at the T cell receptor beta (TRB) and TRG loci,
respectively. The genes that encode the T cell receptor
delta and alpha chains are found at a single chromosomal location with the TRD genes embedded within the

T cell receptor alpha (TRA) locus. For both humans and
mice these are located on chromosome 14 and encompass over 1 megabase (Mb) for the combined TRA/TRD
locus [13]. The TRD locus embedded within the TRA
locus spans approximately 60 kb in humans and 275 kb
in mice. The loci comprise TRDV genes (two in humans
and five in mice), followed by TRDD genes (three in
humans and two in mice), TRDJ genes (four in humans
and two in mice), a single TRDC gene and an additional
TRDV gene that is located 3’ of the TRDC gene in an
inverted transcriptional orientation [10,14]. In addition,
five and ten functional TRAV/DV genes (that rearrange
to either TRDD or TRAJ) have been identified for
humans and mice, respectively, and these are found
upstream of the embedded TRD locus [10,14].
Limited evidence derived from analysis of cDNA
clones from cattle, sheep and swine, as well as limited
germline information for sheep, suggests that the general organization of the bovine TRA/TRD locus does
not differ greatly from that of humans and mice [17,20].
It also suggests that a much larger repertoire of TRDV
genes exists for cattle, as well as for the other “gδ T cell
high” species sheep and swine [15,17,20,21]. Indeed,
recent mapping of the bovine TRA/TRD locus identified
over 100 TRDV and over 300 TRAV or TRAV/DV genes
in cattle [22]. For cattle, four genes belonging to three
different small subgroups (TRDV2, TRDV3 and TRDV4)
have been identified that are orthologous to those same
subgroups in sheep [17,23]. In contrast, while the bovine
TRDV1 genes have been found to be related to the
single TRDV1 gene that occurs in humans, expansion of
the TRDV1 subgroup accounts for the larger number of
TRDV genes in the “gδ T cell high” species [15,17,20-22].
The swine and sheep TRDV1 subgroups have been estimated to contain at least 31 and 40 genes, respectively
[15,21] while the bovine TRDV1 subgroup has been
reported to contain at least 37 genes [20]. However, current knowledge about ruminant and swine TRD genes is
predominantly based on cDNA evidence rather than on
genomic DNA. Because of this, it has been unclear
whether the large number of cDNA TRDV1 sequences is
the result of multiple genes or polymorphisms among
animals; thus, there has been no clear way to classify and
name these transcripts. By annotating the bovine genome
Btau_3.1 assembly, here we demonstrated the presence of
56 TRDV genes, 52 of which belong to the TRDV1 subgroup. We also proposed TRDV1 sets to classify the
bovine and ovine TRDV1 genes based on their phylogenetic grouping.
The existence of multiple D and J genes also contributes to diversity of possible T cell receptor delta chain
amino acid sequences since a particular TRDV gene is
expected to be able to recombine with any D and J
gene. The region of the protein derived from the V-D-J

Page 2 of 19

gene rearrangement is known as the complementarity
determining region 3 (CDR3), while the CDR1 and
CDR2 loops are germline-encoded by the TRDV gene.
The V-D-J gene rearrangement involves recognition of
the recombination signal (RS) sequences for subsequent
DNA cleavage by the enzymes RAG1 and RAG2 [24]. T
cell receptor delta chain sequence diversity is augmented
by junctional flexibility and the addition of N and P
nucleotides. RS flank the V, D and J genes and are composed of highly conserved heptamer and nonamer
sequences separated by either a 12 base pair (bp) spacer
(located 5’ of TRDD and TRDJ genes) or a 23 bp spacer
(located 3’ of TRDV and TRDD genes). Since the conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences and spacer
lengths have been found to be important for efficient
recombination [25] they were also evaluated here.
Finally, recent evidence demonstrated that diversity of T
cell receptor delta chain sequences is amplified by the
occurrence of multiple TRDD genes within a single
CDR3 [20,26]. Thus we also evaluated TRDD gene
usage by analyzing cDNA sequences and report those
findings here.

Results
Gene structure and genomic organization of bovine
TRD genes

Here we set out to annotate and classify the bovine
TRD genes. Prior to the initiation of the studies
described here many cDNA sequences representing
TRDV1 gene transcripts had been reported [16-20,27]
but the actual number of functional bovine TRDV1
genes and their sequences was unknown. As a result it
was not possible to differentiate between cDNA
sequences derived from distinct genes and those that
represented polymorphisms of the same gene among
animals. Furthermore, the existence of TRDV2, TRDV3
and TRDV4 genes had been demonstrated [17], along
with the TRDJ and TRDD genes [20], but their numbers
and placement within the bovine genome had not been
definitively described.
The exon-intron structures of TRDV genes (Figure
1A) and of the single TRDC gene (Figure 1B) were
determined. A TRDV gene encompasses a coding region
of approximately 560 bp and comprises two exons. The
first exon, L-PART1, is 49, 55 and 37 bp in length for
TRDV1/TRDV2, TRDV3 and TRDV4, respectively. The
second exon, V-EXON, is between 271 and 335 bp in
length for TRDV1, and is 299, 293 and 309 bp long for
TRDV2, TRDV3 and TRDV4, respectively. The TRDC
gene encompasses a coding region of 1282 bp comprising three exons. RS sequences were identified, as
expected, adjacent to the 3’ end of each V-EXON (Figure 1A) while the termination codon was at the 3’ end
of TRDC exon 3.

Table 1 summarizes the proposed functional (or Open
Reading Frame [ORF]) TRD genes that were identified
within the bovine Btau_3.1 assembly. Most genes were
identified within regions that were not placed on a chromosome (i.e. were found on ChrUn). However, it is
expected that, like in primates and rodents, these genes
are all located within the TRA/TRD locus which in cattle
is on chromosome 10. The bovine consensus gene set
(known as GLEAN) was used to identify gene prediction
models of TRD genes. Where applicable, GLEAN numbers are listed in Table 1, along with the Bovine Genome
Scaffold identification number, location and orientation.
It should be noted that the orientation of each contig
individually, as well as in relation to other contigs, is not
definitive at this point for the bovine Btau_3.1 assembly.
All putatively functional (or ORF) genes (as determined
based on criteria described in Methods) are shown. Based
on analysis of flanking and intronic genomic sequence it
was determined that many of these gene models might
represent the same genes although they were found more
than once. It is possible that this is due to an anomaly in
the Btau_3.1 assembly, although it cannot be ruled out
that those gene models do indeed represent duplicated
genes that are present in the genome. 67 TRDV1, three
TRDV2, two TRDV3 and one TRDV4 genes were identified; after consideration of multiple gene models that
might be representative of a single gene we propose the
presence of 52 TRDV1, two TRDV2, one TRDV3 and
one TRDV4 genes. The number of TRDV2, TRDV3 and

TRDV4 genes is fairly consistent with what has been previously reported [17,20], although evidence for two
TRDV3 genes has been presented by others [20]. In addition to the TRDV genes, five TRDD genes, three TRDJ
genes and a single TRDC gene were identified, also consistent with previous reports [17,20].
The number of functional TRD genes among mammalian species is compared in Table 2. All species evaluated have genes for at least three TRDV subgroups. It is
notable that humans have only a single TRDV1 gene
(the mouse genes most closely related to human
TRDV1 are named TRDV2-1 and TRDV2-2) while the
TRDV1 subgroup in cattle and other artiodactyls are
large, multigene families. Because of the disparity in
numbers of TRDV1 genes in the human and cattle genomes, organization of their TRA/TRD loci cannot be
compared. Furthermore, additional assembly of the
bovine genome is required in order to definitively determine the size of the TRA/TRD locus, to refine the gene
organization, and to evaluate duplication events that
resulted in the large TRDV1 subgroup. Schematic representations for regions in which three or more TRDV
genes were identified are shown (Figure 2A). Schematics
are shown to scale and gene orientation is as indicated,
based on the Btau_3.1 assembly. As in other species, a
single TRDC gene (see Figure 2B) as well as one TRDV
gene located downstream of TRDC in an inverted transcriptional orientation (named TRDV4 in cattle) were
identified [17]. In some cases multiple gene models

were found to represent the same gene (see Table 1, as
indicated above, and Figure 2) and therefore subsequent
analyses were performed after removing redundant
sequences. It is likely that the occurrence of redundant
sequences is a result of assembly anomalies; however, it
is also possible that these duplicated TRDV genes are in
fact present within the bovine genome.

Deduced amino acid sequences of the 56 TRDV genes
identified here were initially aligned using ClustalW2
[28]. Alignments were refined in BioEdit according to
the IMGT unique numbering for the V-DOMAIN [29],
visualized with Jalview [30] and are shown (Figure 3A)

all predicted to be functional (or ORF) and found on chromosome 10, although many of them were unplaced in the Btau_3.1 assembly.
Multiple TRDV genes were identified in two or three gene prediction models, as indicated, and labels correspond to those used in Table 1.
However, evidence suggests that in each case only a single gene is represented. Genomic organization is shown in those cases when three or
more TRDV genes were found within a single scaffolded region. TRA genes are not shown although in many cases occur among the TRDV
genes. In addition to some TRDV1 genes, the schematic includes TRDV2-1 on ChrUn.158 (no other TRDV genes are included in the schematic).
(B) Genomic organization of the five TRDD genes, 3 TRDJ genes and the single TRDC gene is shown, along with TRDV4 and TRAC. Gene
designations, orientations and Bovine Genome Scaffold identifications are as indicated. The determination of TRDV gene orientation was based
on the assembly of the Bovine Genome Scaffolds, it is possible that some scaffolds were assembled in an incorrect orientation individually and/
or in relation to other scaffolds. Diagrams are shown to scale with base pair increments beneath the schematics. With the exception of TRAC,
TRA genes are not shown. TRDV2-2 and TRDV3 are not shown because those genes were identified on scaffolds lacking additional TRDV genes.

Figure 3 TRDV gene sequences. (A) TRDV deduced amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW2 using the default parameters and
visualized with JalView. Analysis included all non-redundant genomic sequences (see Table 1 for GLEAN identification numbers). IMGT unique
numbering for V-DOMAIN [29,32] is indicated above the alignment and conserved cysteines are indicated below the alignment. (B) IMGT Collier
de Perles [33] are shown for TRDV1 (based on TRDV1a, GLEAN_22158), TRDV2-1 (no glean identification), TRDV3-1 (no glean identification) and
TRDV4 (GLEAN_19724) and were determined using IMGT/V-QUEST [32]. The CDR-IMGT lengths are indicated.

CDR, as indicated. TRDV1 genes reported here are temporarily designated TRDV1a - TRDV1bp until the entire
chromosomal sequence has been assembled. TRDV1
genes encode CDR1 that range in length from five to
ten amino acids (except for TRDV1o which encodes an
18 amino acid long CDR1) while TRDV2, TRDV3 and
TRDV4 genes all encode CDR1 that are seven amino
acids in length. In contrast, most CDR2 of TRDV1,
TRDV2 and TRDV3 genes were three amino acids in
length, except for four of the TRDV1 genes as noted
below, while that of TRDV4 was five amino acids long.
In all but two cases (TRDV1bc and TRDV1w), TRDV1
and TRDV2 genes encode a QXS motif in the CDR2.
Interestingly, TRDV1f, TRDV1ae, TRDV1ar and
TRDV1o (see Figure 3A) all contained a deletion which
spans the last FR2 amino acid to the fifth FR3 amino
acid, resulting in a lack of CDR2 in those genes. An
identical deletion had also been found in the sheep
TRDV1S29 gene [15]. Also, the RS of TRDV1bg and
TRDV1bj were found to occur farther downstream than
those of the other TRDV1 genes identified here, resulting in a putative transcript that extends 15 (for
TRDV1bg) or 12 (for TRDV1bj) amino acids beyond the
conserved 2nd-CYS 104, as opposed to extending only
three or four amino acids which is the case for the
other TRDV1 genes. Because of the unusual nature of
those six genes, until their expression by gδ T cells is
validated they will be considered ORF instead of functional as defined by IMGT [31]. 2D structure graphical
representations of TRDV1, TRDV2, TRDV3 and TRDV4
genes (Figure 3B) were generated using IMGT/VQUEST [32] and the IMGT/Collier-de-Perles tool program [33]. The CDR1 and CDR2 loops are indicated in
red and yellow, respectively. The amino acids 1st-CYS
23, CONSERVED-TRP 41, hydrophobic amino acid
(Leu) 89 and 2nd-CYS 104, which are conserved in all
four TRDV subgroups, are shown with letters in red.
As for sheep, genes in the bovine TRDV1 family share
many characteristics including a 20 amino acid long
highly conserved leader region and the YFC motif found
in the 3’ end of FR3 (see Figure 3A). However, bovine
TRDV1 genes described here were further classified into
eleven sets by constructing a phylogenetic tree using the
neighbor-joining method allowing us to compare them
to equivalent human, mouse and ovine sequences
(Figure 4). The grouping of ovine TRDV1 genes by this
method corresponded with what had been previously
described [15]. The tree shows grouping of bovine
TRDV1 gene sequences into eleven sets, as indicated,
and the percentage interior test values (based on 1000
replicates) are shown for each set. Classification was
further supported based on CDR characteristics used to
classify ovine TRDV1 genes [15] (Table 3). Previously
described characteristics used to classify TRDV1 genes

Page 8 of 19

included CDR1 length (five, seven, nine or ten amino
acids), the chemical characteristics of the amino acid at
position 57 (within CDR2) and the presence or absence
of Trp 107 in CDR3. The number of TRDV1 genes evaluated here that occur within each set is also shown
(Table 4) with set 1 being the largest and set 4 being
the smallest. While some sets can share the same features reported in Table 3 (i.e. sets 5 and 8, 4 and 6) the
classification of TRDV1 genes into those separate sets is
supported based on the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4)
and additional sequence features (data not shown).
When bovine TRDV1 RS (total of 52 sequences) and
ovine TRDV1 RS (total of 12 sequences) were evaluated,
a high level of sequence conservation was observed both
among and within species, as depicted in the sequence
logos shown in Figure 5A. When the RS of bovine
TRDV4 orthologs were compared (including those for
human TRDV3, mouse TRDV5 and ovine TRDV4) a
similarly high level of sequence conservation was
observed among species (Figure 5B). In contrast, comparison of the remaining TRDV RS (those for bovine
TRDV2 and TRDV3, ovine TRDV2 and TRDV3, mouse
TRDV1, TRDV2 and TRDV4, human TRDV1 and
TRDV2) revealed conservation in only the heptamer and
nonamer sequences (Figure 5C). This is consistent with
the lack of relatedness of these genes as determined
based on sequence analysis (refer to Figure 4). Overall,
sequence conservation was observed within the RS heptamer and nonamer of all TRDV genes, regardless of
species (compare Figure 5A, Figure 5B and Figure 5C).
TRDD and TRDJ gene analysis

Genomic locations, sequences and RS of bovine TRDD
and TRDJ genes were also determined (Table 1 and
Additional File 1) and confirmed what had been
reported previously [20]. Evidence for five TRDD genes
was found and deduced amino acid sequences for all
three open reading frames are shown in Additional File
1. Additional putative TRDD genes were identified
based on potential RS (data not shown); however, subsequent cDNA sequence analyses provided little or no evidence that those putative TRDD genes were valid and
thus they are not presented. Three TRDJ genes were
found and their nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences are also reported in Additional File 1. Alignments comparing bovine, ovine, swine, human and
mouse TRDJ gene nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences are shown (Figure 6A and Figure 6B). A phylogenetic tree (Figure 6C), constructed using the neighbor-joining method to evaluate the relatedness of the
above sequences, reflected the alignment.
Bovine, human and murine 5’D-RS and 3’D-RS of TRDD
genes and J-RS of TRDJ genes were evaluated for sequence
conservation (data not shown). Despite a low number of

bovine (bo) genomic TRDV sequences identified here and the previously classified ovine (ov), murine (mo) and human (hu) TRDV sequences
(described in Methods). Bovine TRAV (GenBank accession number BC148926) was included in the analysis and was used to root the tree. The
optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 5.37540770 is shown. Complete deletion to eliminate gaps was performed and the final dataset
included a total of 207 positions. Eleven phylogenetic sets are indicated along with the percentage interior branch test value based on 1000
replicates for each set.

sequences used in the comparisons (because few TRDD
and TRDJ genes exist in the genomes of those species)
there appeared to be conserved heptamer and nonamer
sequences among the RS for all species evaluated.
Although heptamers were found to vary, as expected, they
all contained the 5’ CAC (or 3’ GTG for 5’D-RS and J’RS)
consensus sequence which has been found to be critical

for recombination [25]. Nonamers generally contained the
previously reported consensus sequence ACAAAAACC
[34] (or GGTTTTTGT for 5’D-RS and J’RS) although this
was found to be less conserved. This is consistent with
findings that the nonamer sequence requirements are less
rigid than those for the heptamer sequence in order to
obtain efficient recombination [25].

cDNA analysis as evidence for TRD gene usage

Prior to these studies the number of TRDV1 genes
found in the bovine genome, and their sequences, had
not been resolved. Therefore, it was impossible to classify cloned TRDV1 sequences based on their encoding
genes. Furthermore, TRDV1 genes are highly polymorphic but the subgroup also contains genes that differ
by only one or three nucleotides in their coding regions
(for example TRDV1aa and TRDV1bn, TRDV1v and
TRDV1as). Therefore, it has been very difficult to differentiate between expressed TRDV1 sequences with
regard to whether they represent the same or different
genes. Here we classified previously-identified TRDV1

cloned cDNA sequences based on several criteria which
included their relative placement in trees based on
nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, specific
sequence characteristics and percent identities based on
nucleotide sequence alignments (data not shown).
Results are summarized in Table 5 with the provisional
IMGT nomenclature, corresponding genes and TRDV1
sets (as defined in Figure 4 and Tables 3 and 4)
indicated.
In some cases it was impossible to classify TRDV1
cDNA sequences definitively, because some TRDV1
genes share very high sequence identity; those cases are
indicated in Table 5. Furthermore, in 20 cases (see

Herzig et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:100

for (A) bovine and ovine TRDV1 genes (52 and 12 sequences, respectively). (B) bovine TRDV4 and its ovine, human and murine orthologs
(TRDV4, TRDV3 and TRDV5, respectively; four sequences) and (C) remaining human, murine and bovine TRDV genes (human TRDV1, TRDV2;

lengths are indicated. Logos were generated using WebLogo3 [45].

Table 5) no corresponding TRDV1 genes could be identified although cDNA sequences were found to have features characteristic of particular sets, as indicated. It is
possible that no corresponding genes were found
because additional TRDV1 genes are present in the
bovine genome but were not identified in this study due
to gaps in the analyzed regions of the Btau_3.1 assembly. Only cDNA sequences that differed from potential

corresponding gene sequences by six or fewer nucleotides were classified; however, it remains possible that
those cDNA sequences are not in fact representative of
the genes indicated. Overall, corresponding genes were
identified for most cDNA sequences (35 out of 55
sequences), although 36 of the 52 predicted TRDV1
genes reported here lacked cDNA confirmation and
those genes were found to be distributed among all sets.

sequences, using bovine (bo) genomic TRDJ sequences identified here and previously classified ovine (ov), swine (sw), human (hu) and murine
(mo) TRDJ sequences (described in Methods) are shown with identities indicated by a dot (.) and gaps indicated by a dash (-). The NeighborJoining method [47] was used to infer evolutionary history of the above mentioned sequences. The optimal tree (C) with the sum of branch
length = 2.43145392 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000
replicates) are shown next to the branches [48]. The Maximum Composite Likelihood method [49] was used to compute evolutionary distances.
Complete deletion to eliminate gaps was performed and the final dataset included a total of 42 positions.

Last, for the sake of completeness we note that cDNA
evidence for bovine TRDV2, TRDV3 and TRDV4 genes
reported here has already been demonstrated [17] and
has been confirmed [20].
Identification of the TRDD genes within the bovine
genome allowed us to evaluate TRDD gene usage in
cDNA sequences that had been previously sequenced in
our laboratory. CDR3 of 73 TRDV1, 17 TRDV2, 17
TRDV3 and 36 TRDV4 containing sequences were analyzed (Table 6). All D genes were represented in transcripts containing genes of the four TRDV subgroups. P
nucleotides were observed flanking untrimmed TRDD
regions and extensive N-regions were frequently found
between TRDD regions. Some cases were ambiguous
because nucleotides could be attributed to either P- or
N-region but also to the presence of more than one

TRDD gene. Therefore, we applied the criteria that at
least six nucleotides of a particular TRDD gene must be
present to claim usage of that gene with reasonable confidence. Examples of TRDD gene usage with nucleotide
and deduced amino acid sequences are shown (Figure
7). These demonstrated the incorporation of one to five
TRDD genes within a single CDR3. Only cases in which
the order of TRDD genes in the CDR3 corresponded to
that found in the genome were retained.

Discussion
In order to evaluate and characterize the bovine T cell
receptor delta gene repertoire and their genomic organization we annotated the TRD genes in the Btau_3.1
assembly. Here we describe the existence of two
TRDV2 genes, as well as a single gene each for

Figure 7 TRD rearranged CDR3 sequences and TRDD gene usage. TRD rearranged CDR3 nucleotide sequences, and their corresponding
deduced amino acid sequences, derived from cDNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were aligned to demonstrate TRDD usage.
Germline TRDD sequences are shown above representative TRDV1, TRDV2, TRDV3 and TRDV4 sequences containing between one and five TRDD
genes. TRDD genes are shaded and gene usage was determined by the presence of at least six nucleotides of a particular TRDD gene. Sufficient
cDNA sequence was analyzed to determine TRDV gene usage; however, the sequences shown here have been truncated after the 2nd-CYS 104
and at the beginning of the TRDJ gene.

TRDV3 and TRDV4. We confirmed the presence of
three TRDJ and five TRDD genes [20] and evaluated
TRD junctional diversity incorporating these genes.
Furthermore, we described the existence of 52 TRDV1
genes (46 of them functional and six of them ORF),
evaluated them for their sequence characteristics and
further classified them into eleven sets based on

phylogenetic analysis. As for other mammals, the
bovine TRD locus was found embedded within the
TRA locus and thus TRDV1 genes were distributed
amongst the TRAV genes. Indeed, there were a number of genes for which assignment to the TRAV or
TRDV group was ambiguous. It is important to note
that the presence of TRAV/DV genes is certain and

Herzig et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/100

has been reported [17] but the ability of TRDV or
TRAV genes (as defined based on sequence characteristics) to rearrange with either TRDD or TRAJ must
be determined experimentally and will be evaluated in
future studies. Evaluation of the genes contained
within the TRA/TRD locus was reported [22] following
the initial submission of this work with overall findings
similar to those discussed here.
The question remains as to whether or not the findings reported here represent the complete TRD gene
repertoire because of the gaps in the Btau_3.1 assembly.
The presence of additional TRDV1 genes is almost certain because of extensive gaps in this region although it
is unlikely that additional TRDD or TRDJ genes are present in the genome since that region is fully scaffolded
and has been carefully evaluated for the presence of
additional genes. That region also contains TRDV4 and
its analysis is likely definitive. In addition, previous
cDNA evidence supports the existence of only two
TRDV2 genes [17] and is consistent with our findings.
The existence of two TRDV3 genes has been reported
[20] but is not supported by our findings which may be
due to gaps in the genome assembly. Even with gaps,
locus organization can be assisted by comparison to
other species. Indeed, all mammals studied have genes
that are closely related to human TRDV1 with some
being distributed among the TRAV genes. The bovine
TRDV4 gene is located downstream of the single TRDC
gene in inverse orientation, as found for the human
TRDV3 and mouse TRDV5 genes. It is notable that
there is significant sequence conservation among the
orthologous bovine TRDV4, human TRDV3, mouse
TRDV5 and ovine TRDV4 genes as well as their entire
RS. This suggests that they derive from a common
ancestral gene that appeared before the separation of
these species. By comparison, there are no human or
mouse genes that are equivalent to bovine TRDV2 or
TRDV3. The enormous expansion of the TRDV1 repertoire that has been observed for cattle, sheep and pig
[15,21] is striking when compared with the single
TRDV1 gene found in human (and its two orthologs in
mouse) and thus does not assist us in predicting the
extent of the possible missing information.
TRDV1 gene subgroup expansion is also striking when
compared with other TRDV gene subgroups which, even
in artiodactyls, are found to contain only one or two
members. While the number of TRGV genes found in
each species does not vary considerably [31,35,36],
expansion of the TRDV1 genes in bovine, sheep and pig
is consistent with them being “gδ T cell high” species,
implying that this increase in antigen receptor diversity
permits them to be stimulated by and to respond to
more types of antigens. The presence of fewer TRDV
genes in “gδ T cell low” species, such as humans and

Page 15 of 19

mice, suggests that these species evolved so that gδ
T cells play a less important role in their immune function. Sequence conservation among bovine TRDV1 RS
(including the 23-bp spacer sequences), supports the
concept that the large TRDV1 subgroup arose from
multiple duplication events. Many bovine TRDV1 genes
share high percent identities, indicating that in some
cases this subgroup is not as diverse as the number of
individual genes might suggest. For example, some
TRDV1 sequences differed by as few as four (TRDV1m
and TRDV1s), three (TRDV1v and TRDV1as) or even
one (TRDV1aa and TRDV1bn) nucleotide in their coding regions even though all were determined to be distinct genes based on analysis of the flanking genomic
sequences. However, it cannot be ruled out that some of
these gene models represent the same gene but do not
appear as such due to sequencing and/or assembly
anomalies. The question of why numerous and highly
similar TRDV1 genes have been maintained in the
bovine genome is compelling and studies to evaluate
their functions will be pursued.
Based on phylogenetic sequence analysis and gene features, we subdivided the bovine TRDV1 genes into eleven sets. Each set corresponds to intraspecies gene
duplications of ancestral genes that were present before
the separation between bovine and ovine species. We
also assigned bovine cDNA sequences to germline genes
identified in this work (see Table 5). Of 55 previously
identified TRDV1 cDNA sequences evaluated, 20 could
not be assigned to a germline gene, possibly because of
gaps in that region of the genome assembly. Of the 52
TRDV1 genes identified in this study, cDNA evidence
existed for only 16. It is possible that, because a majority
of the previously identified TRDV1 cDNA sequences
were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
[16-20], the remaining TRDV1 genes that lack cDNA
verification might be expressed in other tissues that
have not been evaluated. It is also possible that other
factors, such as age or immunological experience, might
impact the expression of particular genes and thus prevented verification of those genes. Future studies will
focus on specifically amplifying individual TRDV1 transcripts in order to verify that they are functional and to
determine whether they are expressed in an age and/or
tissue dependent manner.
The potential importance of the role of the T cell
receptor delta rearranged CDR3 is evident instudies
evaluating the binding of the T10 and T22 antigens
[26,37,38] by murine gδ T cells since antigen recognition
by the CDR3 was found to be autonomous, that is, not
dependent on the TRDV gene associated with it [39]. It
could be reasoned that, because the genomes of humans
and mice lack the extensive TRDV repertoirethat has
been observed in artiodactyls, thiswould be compensated

Herzig et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/100

for by diversity of the genes that rearrange to form the
CDR3 (i.e. TRDD and TRDJ genes). Moreover, because
many bovine TRDV1 amino acid sequences are very
similar, structurally it might be expected that their
ligand binding regionsincluding CDR3 would also need
to be as diverse as that in humans and mice. Humans
have three TRDD and four TRDJ genes while mice have
two TRDD and two TRDJ genes. With the exception of
the human TRDJ genes, these numbers all fall short of
the five TRDD and three TRDJ genes identified in cattle.
We demonstrated here that in cattle the TRD CDR3
contained combinations that include between one and
five TRDD genes and would range in length from nine
to 37 amino acids. With the exception of TRDD4, the
germline bovine TRDD genes predominantly encode
glycine and the hydrophobic residues valine and tryptophan, with the neutral residues threonine and tyrosine
being encoded to a lesser extent (see Additional File 1).
This is reminiscent of findings for the equine VH CDR3
loops in which a higher proportion of glycine and lower
proportion of cysteine content was identified when
sequences were compared with those from humans,
sheep and pigs [40]. As was suggested for equine VH
CDR3, this indicates that bovine TRDV CDR3 loops
have increased flexibility and are therefore better suited
to recognize a large number of antigenic conformations.
Considering this, it is unlikely that CDR3 diversity in
mice and humans compensates for their less diverse
TRDV repertoire and, in fact, it seems that cattle have
more scope for antigen binding on all levels.
If the highly diverse CDR3 is indeed the main structural component involved in antigen recognition, then
the TRDV gene products might be most important for
interactions with co-receptors or antigen presenting
cells, whatever their nature may be. While the interactions between gδ T cell receptor and the antigens that
they bind are still largely unknown, it has been demonstrated that for ab T cell receptor the CDR1 loops
(which are germline encoded) are involved with binding
peptide as well as MHC. The CDR2 loops (also germline
encoded) bind only MHC. The TRDV CDR1 in cattle
exhibited diverse lengths and were generallyfound to be
five to ten amino acids long as for mouse and human
TRDV, TRBV and TRAV CDR1. Thisdiverse bovine
TRDV CDR1 repertoire may contribute to antigen binding in contrast to what has been reported for murine gδ
T cell recognition of T22 as described above. It was
found that bovine TRDV1 CDR2 were either only three
amino acids long or absent completely (e.g., TRDV1f,
TRDV1ae, TRDV1ar and TRDV1o) in contrast to TRBV
CDR2 lengths of five to seven amino acids in mammals.
It is yet to be determined whether the TRDV1 genes
lacking CDR2 are functional, however, if they are found
to be so this lackof, or abbreviation of, the CDR2

Page 16 of 19

inbovine TRDV1 genes is logical since gδ T cells are not
MHC-restricted.

Conclusions
Based on annotations of the bovine genome we identified the TRD genes including 56 TRDV genes, five
TRDD genes, three TRDJ genes and the single TRDC
gene and described their organization within the TRD
locus. Furthermore, we report that the TRDV1 subgroup
contains 52 genes, indicating that this subgroup underwent expansion as has been found for sheep and swine.
Also, because this large gene subgroup has been maintained in the bovine genome this indicates a unique role
for these genes in gδ T cell biology.
Methods
Genome Annotation

In conjunction with the Bovine Genome Sequencing
Consortium http://genomes.arc.georgetown.edu/
bovine/, manual annotation of the T cell receptor
delta genes was performed using the Apollo Genome
Annotation and Curation Tool, version 1.6.5 [41] and
the bovine genome assembly Btau_3.1 [42]. First, a
BLAST search of bovine T cell receptor delta cDNA
sequences against the Bovine Official Gene Set
(GLEAN) was performed in order to identify predicted
gene models. These were then analyzed using the
Apollo software and the following actions were performed where applicable: (i) models were checked for
correct exon-intron structure, (ii) initiation and termination codons were identified where applicable and in
other cases 5’ and 3’ ends were set based on RS and
splice sites, (iii) exons were either added or deleted if
it was determined that the coding region in the predicted model was incorrect, (iv) predicted gene models
were split when a single model encompassed more
than one gene or merged when two models coded for
a single gene and (v) RS were identified for TRDV,
TRDD and TRDJ genes. Predicted gene models identified from the BLAST search were considered pseudogenes, and were not included in subsequent analyses,
when premature stop codons or frameshifts occurred
in areas where the sequence integrity was deemed adequate. Furthermore, predicted gene models were considered Open Reading Frame (ORF), as defined by
IMGT [31] if the coding region had an open reading
frame but the sequence structure differed significantly
from known TRDV sequences; ORF gene models were
included in subsequent analyses. Following annotation,
predicted gene model identity and classification were
verified using BLAST searches and IMGT/V-QUEST
[32]; only gene models that were unambiguously identified as TRDV genes, and not TRAV/DV genes, based
on those results were included in subsequent analyses.

Sequence analyses

Nucleotide sequences were aligned and analyzed using
BioEdit version 7.0.5.3 [43]. Exon-intron structure schematics were based on alignments of cDNA and genomic
DNA sequence using SIM4 [44] and visualized with
LalnView http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/lalnview.
html. GLEAN numbers of the annotated bovine gene
sequences used in sequence analyses are reported in
Table 1. Published T cell receptor delta sequences,
derived from cloned RT-PCR products, were submitted
to GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/
index.html; see Table 5 for accession numbers) and
assigned to TRDV genes identified here. CDR3 sequence
data described in Table 6, from bovine TRD rearranged
genes, are available upon request. Rearranged CDR3
lengths were determined from positions 105 to 117, that
is, between the 2nd-CYS 104 and J-PHE 118 of the
FGXG motif, according to the IMGT unique numbering
for V-DOMAIN [29]. The accession numbers of additional sequences used in analyses are as follows: human

html; [28]) and the default parameters and were visualized using JalView [30]. IMGT unique numbering was
determined for the V-DOMAIN [29] and TRDV secondary structures were evaluated and displayed as IMGT
Collier de Perles [33] as determined using IMGT/VQUEST [32]. Sequence logos were generated using
WebLogo3 [45].
Phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic analyses were performed using nucleotide
sequences, unless otherwise indicated, of functional (and
ORF) TRDV and TRDJ genes. TRDV sequences were
truncated to include the V-REGION (IMGT amino acid
positions 1 through 108) and comprised those from
bovine (identified here in Btau_3.1), human, mouse and
ovine (see accession numbers above). TRDJ sequences
were truncated to include sequence between the RS (5’
end) and splice site (3’ end) and comprised those from
bovine (identified here in Btau_3.1), human, mouse,
ovine and swine (see accession numbers above).
Phylogenies were constructed in MEGA4 [46] using
the neighbor-joining method and the p-distance model
for nucleotide sequences. Phylogenies were tested using
an interior branch test or bootstrap analysis, as indicated, with 1000 replications.
cDNA analysis

Bovine TRDV cDNA was obtained as described in previous studies [16,17]. Briefly, blood was collected via
jugular venipuncture into heparin and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells were isolated via density gradient
centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque™ PLUS (GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Animal use complied with federal
guidelines and had IACUC approval. Pelleted cells were
resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed
following reverse transcription (RT) and using primers
designed to specifically amplify TRDV transcripts as
previously described [16,17]. In addition, amplification
of TRD rearranged CDR3 was performed using a common reverse primer called TRDC-rev (5’-CTC CTT
CAC CAA ACA AGC GAC G-3’) and the following forward primers: TRDV1S1S2-for (5’-GCA GAT AAA
TCC ATC AGC CTC ACC-3’), TRDV1S3-for (5’-CAC
AGA ACT CCA TCA GCC TCA CC-3’), TRDV1S4-for
(5’-TCA CGT AAA GCC ATC AGC CTC ATT-3’),
TRDV2-for (5’-GGA AAA AAA ATC ATC AGC CTC
ACC-3’), TRDV3-for (5’-TAC AAA CCC AAC CAA
ATG CTG AAA-3’), TRDV4-for (5’-AGC ATG AGC
CAA AAA ACC TTC CAC-3’). PCR products were analyzed on TAE agarose gels and cloned into the pCR2.1
vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s

protocol. cDNA clones were sequenced commercially
(GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ) in order to verify the
insert identity and for subsequent sequence analysis.
