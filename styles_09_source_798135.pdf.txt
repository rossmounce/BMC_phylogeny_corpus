Abstract
Background: Alu elements are a family of SINE retrotransposons in primates. They are classified
into subfamilies according to specific diagnostic mutations from the general Alu consensus. It is now
believed that there may be several retrotranspositionally-competent source genes within an Alu
subfamily. In this study, subfamilies falling on the AluYi and AluYh lineages, and the AluYg6
subfamily, are assessed for the presence of secondary source genes, and the influence of gene
conversion on the AluYh and AluYi lineages is also described.
Results: The AluYh7 and AluYi6 subfamilies appear to contain multiple source genes. The novel
subfamilies AluYh3a1 and AluYh3a3 are described, for which there is no convincing evidence to
suggest the presence of secondary sources. The mutational substructure of AluYh3a3 can be
explained completely by inference of single master gene. A complete backwards gene conversion
event appears to have inactivated the AluYh3a3 master gene in humans. Polymorphism data suggest
a larger number of secondary source elements may be active in the AluYg6 family than previously
thought.
Conclusion: It is clear that there is considerable variation in the number of source genes present
in each of the young Alu subfamilies. This can range from a single master source gene, as for
AluYh3a3, to as many as 14 source elements in AluYi6.

Background
Alu elements, a family of non-autonomous SINE retrotransposons in primates, are approximately 300 bp in
length, and have proliferated to over one million copies
[1] in the human genome, comprising approximately
11% of the genome by mass [2]. Alu elements comprise
two similar monomers derived from 7SL RNA in the common ancestor of primates and rodents [3].
The majority of these elements were generated 35–60 million years ago (mya) during the peak of Alu retrotranspositional activity [2], which has subsequently reduced to

the current, relatively low level. Despite their high copy
number, only a relatively small number of Alu elements
are capable of generating new copies [4]. This has led to
the generation of a collection of Alu subfamilies of differing ages, characterised by diagnostic mutations [5]. These
correspond to mutations present within the source genes
that gave rise to each subfamily.
The term "source gene" is used to describe an Alu element
which is both transcriptionally and retrotranspositionally
active, and therefore capable of producing daughter elements. For a long time, Alu elements were believed to folPage 1 of 12

low a master gene pattern of expansion [2], whereby only
one, or very few, elements are retrotranspositionally competent. Consequently, elements were grouped into subfamilies, elements within which share diagnostic
mutations inferred to have occurred within the master
gene. Currently, Alu elements are grouped into three
groups of differing ages, AluJ, AluS and AluY. The elements
derived from AluY, as discussed here, are still actively retrotransposing, and are therefore less divergent than the other
groups. Subfamilies derived from AluY, such as AluYi6,
have arisen recently, therefore elements belonging to these
subfamilies have not diverged extensively from the subfamily consensus sequence. It is therefore possible to identify all members of these subfamilies through identification
of AluY elements with the relevant diagnostic mutations.
Although the master gene model of proliferation appears
to be true for some lineages, such as AluYe [6], it cannot

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/102

be true for the whole of Alu due to the presence of many
currently active source genes, each of which has given rise
to a "young" Alu subfamily. The most extreme alternative
to the master gene model is the transposon model, where
every individual Alu element is capable of producing
daughter elements. The investigation of young Alu subfamilies has led to the development of models of their
expansion [7-9], which fall somewhere between these two
extremes. For example, it has been reported previously,
using a network phylogenetic approach, that approximately 10–20% of elements within a young Alu subfamily
may operate as secondary source genes [7]. It is impossible to use traditional phylogenetic reconstruction methods to infer relationships between Alu elements, as, with
their very high copy number, many elements in a young
Alu subfamily share a consensus sequence, therefore the
relationships between these elements could not be
resolved. CpG transition mutations occur at six times the

rate of other types of mutations in Alu sequences due to
spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine [10]. This results in homoplasy, which can lead to the
inference of invalid phylogenetic relationships between
sequences. Through multiple alignment of 480,000 Alu
sequences, which were divided into groups based on the
overrepresentation of individual mutations, it has been
estimated that there may be at least 143 Alu source genes
in total. This number would require many active elements
to be present within each of the currently-defined subfamilies [11].
This study analyses the source gene composition of the
AluYi and AluYh lineages of retrotransposons, and the
influence of gene conversion on the mutational substructure of the subfamilies falling on these lineages. The activity of a source gene is suggested by the presence of groups
of elements with shared combinations of mutations, particularly those groups with elements demonstrating presence/absence
polymorphism.
The
presence
of
polymorphic elements sharing specific mutations is indicative of the activity of a secondary source element, as polymorphic elements have recently retrotransposed and are
therefore unlikely to have accumulated such mutations in
parallel. AluYi6 is described as an example of a subfamily
which appears to possess numerous secondary source elements, and a novel subfamily, AluYh3a3, is presented as a
subfamily which appears to have followed the master
gene model of expansion.

Results and Discussion
The number of source elements contributing to young Alu
subfamilies appears to vary widely among lineages. The
AluYh lineage appears to have split into two, which share
three diagnostic mutations in addition to those of AluY.
There is evidence for master gene expansion within the
AluYh lineage, as mutations appear to have accumulated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/102

progressively in one subfamily. This provides further evidence that the master gene model remains consistent with
the pattern of proliferation in some young Alu subfamilies. The AluYi lineage provides an alternative perspective, with evidence for multiple secondary source
elements simultaneously contributing to the proliferation
of the AluYi6 subfamily. This is suggested by the presence
of multiple elements within a subfamily sharing a set of
specific mutations, which suggests these mutations were
present in the source element rather than occurring multiple times in parallel. The hypothesis is supported by the
presence of polymorphic elements which share additional
mutations from the AluYi6 consensus. This suggests that
these mutations were present in the source gene which
gave rise to these elements, rather than happening multiple times in parallel. However, using the genome trace
archives to identify polymorphisms cannot conclusively
determine whether or not an element which appears to be
fixed is polymorphic, as individuals in which the element
is absent may not be represented in the archives. It is
therefore possible that the number of polymorphic elements, and therefore potentially the number of secondary
source elements, has been underestimated. Gene conversion appears to have influenced the structure of mutations
observed in both lineages, in one case, resulting in the
inactivation of a putative master gene. These results are
discussed in detail for the AluYh and AluYi lineages
below.
The AluYh lineage
AluYh7
The elements of the AluYh9 subfamily [13] all share only
seven diagnostic mutations, therefore this subfamily will
be referred to as AluYh7 (figure 1). The subfamily is
human-specific and contains 20 elements [see additional
file 1], of which 16 have been previously reported as
AluYh9 [13]. This subfamily appears to have arisen very
recently, as at least half of the elements are polymorphic
for presence or absence, and 9 of the elements are identical to the subfamily consensus. The level of divergence of
the remaining 11 elements is very low, with elements possessing either 1 or 2 point mutations from the consensus.
Of the two elements which possess the nine diagnostic
mutations of AluYh9, one is polymorphic for presence or
absence. This makes it likely that these additional two
mutations are shared due to retrotransposition rather
than parallel mutation or gene conversion, a non-reciprocal recombination process that affects Alu elements, so
there may be two active source genes in this small subfamily.

The only evidence for proliferation on this lineage prior to
the acquisition of all seven diagnostic mutations of
AluYh7 is of an element with three of the seven diagnostic
mutations, "AluYh3", which appears to have generated

two derivative lineages, one of which is AluYh7. The second shares these three diagnostic mutations with AluYh3,
along with an additional mutation (figure 1).
AluYh3a1
It can be assumed that this subfamily is derived from the
putative "AluYh3" intermediate along this lineage (figure
2), and this subfamily will therefore be referred to as
AluYh3a1, although it is possible that these three mutations from AluY occurred twice independently, this is
more unlikely. All four of the diagnostic mutations for
this subfamily are found in the left half of the element
(figure 1). AluYh3a1 appears to have originated before the
divergence of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, as there
are instances of elements of this subfamily present in the
gorilla whole genome shotgun sequence. There are also
instances of AluYh3a1 present in the orangutan genome,
where there are at least three elements present. These elements are not found in humans. However, the subfamily
appears to be absent from the available genomic data for
two species of gibbon (Hylobates concolor and Namascus
leucogenys). If the available gibbon sequence data are representative of the whole genome, this would suggest the
AluYh3a1 subfamily originated between around 10 and
16 million years ago.

The subfamily has proliferated quite extensively in
humans and chimpanzees, and many elements are shared
between the two species. There are 98 elements with all
four AluYh3a1 diagnostic mutations present in humans
[see additional file 2], and 73 in chimpanzees [see additional file 3].
A complete gene conversion event has occurred in
chimps, where there is an AluYh3a1 present in the chimpanzee (DC7), but an older AluSq element is found at the
orthologous locus in the human genome (figure 3). This
is likely to be a forward gene conversion event in the
chimpanzee rather than a backwards event in the human
due to the high similarity between DC7 and the shared
element DC8/DY83, which is likely to have provided the
template. There are other examples of possible complete
gene conversion events occurring between species-specific
Alu elements, where pairs of elements share numerous
mutations. However, as the putative gene conversion
events would be occurring between two species-specific
elements, it cannot be proven that the mutations are not
shared due to parallel mutation.
In addition, patterns of mutations suggest multiple partial
and "almost complete" gene conversion events have

occurred. Comparison of elements shared by humans and
chimpanzees reveals that ancestral nucleotides have been
introduced at diagnostic positions in one species. This
may be either due to partial gene conversion or back
mutation. In two cases, all four diagnostic sites possess the
ancestral nucleotide in one species, but this is likely to be
due to partial gene conversion, rather than complete, as
the orthologues share mutations outside the putative gene
conversion tract (figure 4). In the case of AluYh3a1, the

diagnostic mutations are clustered within a 64 bp region.
It is therefore reasonable that a partial gene conversion
tract, which on average cover around 50–100 bp [2,18],
would result in ancestral nucleotides being introduced at
all four sites.
There are further examples of likely partial gene conversion events resulting in between 1 and 3 diagnostic mutations. Once again, mutations are shared between

sequences is consistent with a hypothesis of 14 independent mutational events. Given the relatively small size of
this subfamily, however, this may be indicative of a secondary source element. The greatest number of elements
sharing a pair of mutations is 5, which is, again, possibly
due to the presence of a secondary source element possessing these two mutations, but could be due to parallel
mutation. For this reason, levels of polymorphism were
not assessed for this subfamily.
AluYh3a3
There is a small subfamily which appears to have been
derived from AluYh3a1 (table 1), but beyond this, there is
no evidence for substructure within the AluYh3a1 subfamily to indicate the activity of further secondary source
elements. Therefore, it is possible that the remaining elements in this subfamily have been produced by the activity of a single source (master) gene. Alternatively, there
may be several source elements, which do not possess
mutations, or perhaps only a single CpG mutation, which
alone would not provide enough evidence to suggest the
activity of a secondary source gene.

orthologues on either side of the putative tract, but no
mutations are shared within it.
There is no compelling evidence from the sequence data
for this subfamily to suggest that secondary source elements have contributed to its proliferation. The greatest
number of elements sharing a particular mutation within
a species is 14 of the 98 elements. However, this mutation
is a CpG transition, which is likely to have occurred many
times in parallel. The 98 sequences in this subfamily differ
from the consensus sequence by 2.622 mutations, on
average, at non-CpG sites. This represents a difference of
0.01107 mutations per base. If we assume that CpG sites
are six times as likely to change as are non-CpG bases,
then, using the binomial distribution, we calculate that
the probability that a given CpG base in the sequence
would be mutated in 14 or more of the sequences is
0.532%. We assume that effectively all these mutations
would be the C to T and the G to A changes associated
with CpGs. There are 44 CpG bases in the sequence, each
of which has a chance of 0.532% of being mutated in 14
or more of the sequences. Thus, we calculate that the
probability that at least one of these 44 would be mutated
in 14 or more of the 98 sequences is approximately 44
times this, or more than 20%. Thus this site mutated in 14

The derivative subfamily, named AluYh3a3, contains a
characteristic 19 bp deletion near the 3' end, between
positions 242 and 260. This subfamily is very small, comprising only three elements in humans [see additional file
4], and 11 elements in chimpanzees [see additional file 5].
However, large deletions in Alu elements are rare and so
the presence of the deletion in these elements, in addition
to the four diagnostic mutations of AluYh3a1, is good
enough evidence to consider this a unique subfamily,
rather than due to parallel deletion. In addition to the 19
bp deletion, 10 of the 11 chimpanzee elements also contain a diagnostic point mutation. Two of the elements are
shared between chimpanzees and humans.
Although AluYh3a3 consists of a very small number of
elements, there is a considerable amount of substructure
in this subfamily. The pattern of shared mutations can be
explained under the master gene model, without the inference of secondary source elements, as there appears to
have been a progressive accumulation of mutations (figure 5). The putative master element would be either DB2
or DB3, as these two elements possess all of the shared
mutations. However, neither of these two elements is
shared between chimpanzees and humans. The orthologous locus in humans is a perfect unfilled site for DB2,
showing a single copy of the TSD. The orthologous locus
in humans to chimp DB3 is a filled site containing an
AluSx element. It is therefore possible that DB3 is the master gene for the AluYh3a3 subfamily, but the locus has
undergone backwards gene conversion in humans (figure
6). Gene conversion has been reported to be more likely
between spatially close Alu elements [19], and the human

single mutation includes copies with further shared mutations. H = human, C = chimp, G = gorilla, UN = unknown, Y = yes.

DB3 orthologue is found in a region with numerous
highly similar AluSx elements (possessing the characteristic 20 bp deletion) in the vicinity that could have provided
the gene conversion template. Presence of this deletion
might have made gene conversion more likely between
this AluSx element and AluYh3a3, which contains a 19 bp
deletion, as the sequences would be of similar length.
Inactivation of the master gene by gene conversion would
also explain why there are fewer elements of this subfamily in humans compared with chimpanzees. This is
more likely to be a backwards gene conversion on the
human lineage rather than a forward gene conversion in
the chimpanzee, as the site is unfilled in the orangutan
genome. AluSx currently mobilizes at only very low frequency [20], and therefore is more likely to have been
introduced to this locus in humans by gene conversion
rather than retrotransposition.
AluYh3a3 is also present in the gorilla, however, the
orthologous locus to chimp DB3 is unavailable to deter-

mine whether or not this is the original founder element.
There are four copies of AluYh3a3 in the available gorilla
genomic data, all of which are gorilla-specific.
No AluYh3a3 elements appear to be polymorphic in
either humans or chimpanzees by examination of the
trace archives. This may indicate that the subfamily is no
longer proliferating, or individuals with polymorphic elements may not be represented in the archives. This is more
likely for the chimpanzee sequences, as fewer individuals
have been sequenced.
AluYi6
The AluYi6 subfamily, which has six diagnostic mutations
from the AluY consensus, has been reported to be present
in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas [14]. 123 elements
belonging to this subfamily have been published, 104 of
which possess all six diagnostic mutations [14]. In this
study, 237 Yi6 elements were identified in humans [see
additional file 6]. The sequences of these elements show
patterns of shared mutations consistent with the activity

only contain very few elements, such as those with 254A
and 251T mutations (5 elements), may not be the product
of secondary source genes, as the mutations may simply
be shared due to parallel mutation. Polymorphism data,
however, suggest the former is more likely.
It was shown previously that three of the elements found
in humans were shared with the chimpanzee [14]. Analysis of the chimpanzee genome reveals that Yi6 has proliferated quite extensively in the chimpanzee following its
divergence from humans. 91 Yi6 elements were found to
be present in the chimpanzee genome [see additional file
7], of which 13 are shared with humans. Only three of the
chimpanzee elements are identical to the AluYi6 subfamily consensus. Two of the previously identified derivative subfamilies (Yi6.1 and Yi6.2) were found in both
humans and chimps, suggesting a time of origin prior to
the human-chimp divergence. A novel chimp-specific
subfamily was also identified, the consensus for which
has two additional diagnostic mutations (175A, 200A)
relative to the AluYi6 consensus. 31 of the 91 chimpanzee
Yi6 elements belong to this novel subfamily. In chimpanzees, at least three AluYi6 source genes appear to be currently active from looking at polymorphism data,
containing the 151T mutation, the 175A and 200A mutations, and the 57T mutation.

of potentially many secondary source elements. 3 derivative subfamilies, designated Yi6.1, Yi6.2 and Yi6.3 have
already been reported, and have all been shown to be polymorphic, and therefore currently active [14]. The pattern
of shared mutations in the AluYi6 subfamily indicates
there may be as many as 14 source elements operating in
humans (table 2). These potential 14 source genes fall on
only 3 lineages, as each possesses one of three mutations:
151T, 57T or 254A (figure 7). Polymorphism data suggest
that this isn't indicative of three "master genes", but does
indeed represent the activity of many source elements.
Some of these small Yi6 derivative subfamilies contain a
considerable number of elements (for example, there are
36 elements with the 57T mutation), whereas others contain very few. The potential derivative subfamilies which

Two of the elements that were found to be shared between
humans and chimps in the original study were also found
in the gorilla [14], suggesting the subfamily arose before
the divergence of gorillas from chimpanzees and humans,
approximately seven million years ago. Yi6 does appear to
have undergone some proliferation along the gorilla lineage, with at least one gorilla-specific element present in
this species. AluYi6 appears to be absent from the orangutan, with no evidence of the subfamily in the orangutan
pre-ensembl shotgun assembly. This suggests the subfamily is less than 10 – 13 million years old [21,22].
Gene conversion, a non-reciprocal recombination process
commonly affecting Alus, has also operated in the AluYi6
subfamily. There is evidence for a complete gene conversion event, as there is an AluYi6 element present in the
chimp (DQ59), and an older Alu belonging to the AluY
subfamily present at the orthologous locus in humans.
Difference in retrotransposition rate between humans and
chimpanzees
The rate of retrotransposition has been shown to have
increased along the human lineage since the divergence
between humans and chimpanzees [23], with most
young Alu subfamilies that are present in both species
reaching larger copy numbers in humans than chimpanzees. The observations of copy number of subfamilies in
the AluYh and AluYi lineages generally support this, with
subfamilies reaching a higher copy number in humans

Out of the 98 human elements, 41 are human-specific.
In addition, fewer copies of AluYi6 are found in chimpanzees relative to humans. AluYh3a3 is unusual in that
it has proliferated to a greater extent in chimpanzees
than humans. However, this has been shown to be due
to inactivation of the master gene along the human lineage some time into the past, thereby preventing further
proliferation of the subfamily.
AluYg6
AluYg6, a subfamily previously investigated in detail
(Styles and Brookfield, 2007), was also assessed for the
presence of polymorphic elements which might indicate
the activity of secondary source genes (table 3). Polymorphic elements belonging to the derivative subfamilies
Yg6a2 and Yg5b3 were identified, revealing that these subfamilies are at least 30% and 26% polymorphic, respectively. Polymorphic elements matching the AluYg6
consensus sequence was also identified. In addition to
polymorphic elements with the Yg6a2 and Yg5b3 consensus sequences, polymorphic elements were identified
with the diagnostic mutations for each of these subfamilies along with an additional shared mutation in each
case. Three of the five AluYg6a2 elements, and two out of
seven of the AluYg5b3 elements, with the additional
mutation, were found to be polymorphic. The presence of
polymorphic elements with additional shared mutations
suggests that the number of source elements in the AluYg6
subfamily is higher than previously thought, and may be
at least 5.

Conclusion
It is clear that there is considerable variation in the number
of source genes present in each of the young Alu subfamilies. Evidence from patterns of shared mutations and
polymorphism data suggest that multiple source genes are
actively retrotransposing in the AluYh7 and AluYi6 subfamilies, the latter of which may contain up to 14 source
elements. The data presented here support the hypothesis
that neither the master gene model nor the transposon

model is valid for all young Alu subfamilies. There is not
sufficient evidence to suggest the presence of secondary
source genes contributing to the proliferation of AluYh3a1.
The small AluYh3a3 subfamily appears to have followed
the master gene model of proliferation in both humans and
chimpanzees, with its substructure easily explained without
the need to infer the activity of secondary source elements.
Polymorphism data suggest the presence of several secondary source genes contributing to the proliferation of the
AluYg6 subfamily. Gene conversion appears to have operated in the AluYh3a1, AluYh3a3 and AluYi6 subfamilies,
with partial gene conversion introducing ancestral mutations at diagnostic sites, and both forward and backward
complete gene conversion replacing Alu elements with
those belonging to other subfamilies. In the case of
AluYh3a3, such an event has resulted in inactivation of the
putative master gene in humans.

Methods
Sequence data
A BLASTN search [12] of the human genome sequence,
using default parameters, was performed using the consensus sequences of the AluYh9 [13] and AluYi6 [13,14]
subfamilies, obtained using RepBase Update [15]. The
searches yielded 1426 and 1277 Alu elements, respectively, which were manually examined for the presence of
diagnostic mutations specific to AluYh9 and AluYi6.
Those which possessed the diagnostic mutations of AluY,
and at least seven of the additional diagnostic mutations
of the AluYh9 subfamily, and at least four of those for
AluYi6, were extracted. It was not required that elements
possessed all diagnostic mutations for each subfamily, as
back mutation can introduce ancestral nucleotides at
diagnostic sites. In each case, following the extraction of
elements with the necessary diagnostic mutations, the
remaining hits in the BLAST search corresponded to AluY
elements. The search using the AluYh9 consensus revealed
only two elements with all nine diagnostic mutations,
with the majority of elements sharing only seven. This
subfamily will be referred to as AluYh7. Many Alu elements were identified using the AluYh7 consensus
sequence, which shared three of the diagnostic mutations
of the subfamily, and an additional point mutation. These
elements will be referred to as AluYh3a1 (figure 1). This
sequence was then used as a query for a BLAST search. ElePage 10 of 12

ments from the AluYh7, AluYh3a1, and AluYi6 subfamilies were extracted. A custom Perl program was used
to identify any mutations that had occurred in each element relative to the corresponding subfamily consensus.

1000 bp of flanking DNA was extracted 5' and 3' of each
element, to enable the identification of orthologous
regions in closely-related species. Each of the extracted elements and its flanking sequence were submitted as a
query for a BLAT [16] analysis of a related genome (chimpanzee or human) to elucidate complete gene conversion
events. Orthologous regions were aligned using ClustalW
[17]. In most cases, a gap was present in one species corresponding to the region in which the Alu, and one copy
of the target site duplication (TSD), were found in the
other species. In some cases, an Alu element of an older
subfamily was present at the orthologous position, indicative of a gene conversion event.

Polymorphism
The NCBI human and chimpanzee genome trace archives
were used to assess whether or not each element is polymorphic for presence or absence. This can be seen where
the flanking DNA is present in the trace archive, with only
one copy of the TSD, and the corresponding Alu is absent.
