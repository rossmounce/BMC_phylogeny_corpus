Abstract
Background: Traditionally the rapid origin of megadiverse species flocks of extremely closely
related species is explained by the combinatory action of three factors: Disruptive natural selection,
disruptive sexual selection and partial isolation by distance. However, recent empirical data and
theoretical advances suggest that the diversity of complex species assemblages is based at least
partially on the hybridization of numerous ancestral allopatric lineages that formed hybrids upon
invasion of new environments. That reticulate speciation within species flocks may occur under
sympatric conditions after the primary formation of species has been proposed but not been tested
critically.
Results: We reconstructed the phylogeny of a complex cichlid species flock confined to the tiny
Cameroonian crater lake Barombi Mbo using both mitochondrial and nuclear (AFLP) data. The
nuclear phylogeny confirms previous findings which suggested the monophyly and sympatric origin
of the flock. However, discordant intra-flock phylogenies reconstructed from mitochondrial and
nuclear data suggest strongly that secondary hybridization among lineages that primarily diverged
under sympatric conditions had occurred. Using canonical phylogenetic ordination and tree-based
tests we infer that hybridization of two ancient lineages resulted in the formation of a new and
ecologically highly distinct species, Pungu maclareni.
Conclusions: Our findings show that sympatric hybrid speciation is able to contribute significantly
to the evolution of complex species assemblages even without the prior formation of hybrids
derived from allopatrically differentiated lineages.

Background
Recent empirical data and theoretical advances suggest
that the diversity of complex species assemblages is based
at least partially on the hybridization of numerous ancestral allopatric lineages that formed hybrids upon invasion
of new environments [1-5]. A growing amount of studies
show that cytoplasmatic (mitochondrial or chloroplast)
gene phylogenies of recent diverse species radiations often
conflict with phylogenies based on numerous nuclear
genes [3,5-9]. Theoretical arguments as well as empirical

evidence from hybrid zones predict that in newly colonized habitats the effect of transgressive segregation, i.e.
the generation of extreme traits in hybrid populations,
may lead to a drastically increased phenotypic variation.
This effect may in turn serve as a substrate for evolution of
novel adaptive traits [2,10-12]. These arguments in combination with an increasing body of evidence showing
that species resulting from interspecific hybridization are
common in plants [13] and highly probable in animals
[5,7,9-14] gave rise to hypotheses about a prominent role

of hybridization for the evolution of adaptive radiations
[6]. Both, the initial formation of hybrid swarms of originally allopatric populations meeting in a newly colonized
habitat ("hybrid swarm origin hypothesis") as well as secondary hybridization of in situ diverged lineages ("syngameon hypothesis") could possibly explain the rapid
formation of megadiverse species flocks. The scenario
may either involve secondary localized hybridization, i.e.
hybridization of parapatric ("microallopatric") lineages
within the geographical range of the primary radiation, or
alternatively hybridization of sympatrically diverged lineages. Distinguishing between these two alternatives is central for the understanding of the processes that lead to the
evolution of megadiversity. The first alternative predicts
that increased species richness due to hybridization is
dependent primarily on the spatial scale and the accompanied possibility to establish localized metapopulations.
The second alternative predicts that hybridisation can aid
the build-up of diversity even under fully sympatric conditions. Several studies, some published, some in preparation support the hybrid swarm origin hypothesis for some
species assemblages endemic to comparatively large areas
[3-5,8] but a critical evaluation of the syngameon hypotheses rests on the ability to test for sympatric hybrid
speciation.

eter, because there are no migration-barriers along the
shore, and because the lake is isolated from nearby river
systems by cataracts of its outflow, allopatric scenarios for
the origin and diversification of the flock were ruled out.
However, in the light of the aforementioned methodological drawbacks of mitochondrial phylogenies, both the
monophyly-hypothesis for the Barombi flock and the
relationships among its 11 endemic species are worth to
be reevaluated.
The ability to score thousands of amplified fragmentlength polymorphisms (AFLPs) has created a powerful
possibility for the phylogenetic reconstruction of rapidly
originated species flocks. It has been successfully applied
to a limited number of taxa belonging to the Lake Malawi
and Lake Victoria haplochromine species flocks and
revealed previously undetectable phylogenetic patterns
including those supporting the hybrid swarm origin
hypothesis [4,18,19]. In this study, we tested hypotheses
about sympatric speciation with a focus on hybridization
by applying a combination of mitochondrial DNAsequencing and AFLP-genotyping as well as a set of
recently proposed analytical tools [20] to the phylogenetic
analysis of a complete and complex species flock.

Results
However, despite increasing evidence for sympatric speciation, uncontested examples remain rare and rarely go
beyond the formation of single species-pairs [15,16]. In
addition, evidence for sympatric speciation of complex
species-assemblages is often based on mitochondrial phylogenies of limited taxon-sampling. This is problematic as
mitochondrial phylogenies or those based on few nuclear
loci may obscure true species phylogenies either due to
introgressive hybridization among already established
species or due to incomplete lineage sorting during rapid
speciation. Hence it is not surprising, that studies applying several nuclear markers occasionally yield phylogenetic hypotheses about the origin and pattern of
sympatric species assemblages which contrast with mitochondrial hypotheses. As a consequence of the uncertainty about phylogenetic relationships among members
of complex species flocks questions about the processes
that contribute to sympatric speciation remain difficult to
test due to the lack of appropriate model systems.
Until recently the phylogeny of mitochondrial lineages of
the cichlid species flock of crater lake Barombi Mbo
(Cameroon) [17] was considered as one of the best examples for sympatric speciation [15]. According to this phylogeny which was based on haplotypes of single
specimens, the monophyly of the 11 endemic species suggested strongly that they had formed after a single colonisation by a riverine founder species, Sarotherodon galilaeus.
Because the lake's conical basin is only 2.15 km in diam-

Mitochondrial phylogenetic inferences
We obtained a DNA sequence-alignment with 2553 bp
including two complete mitochondrial genes, NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) and cytochrome b
(cytb), partial proline tRNA as well as from part of the
control region from all Barombi species (two samples per
species) and relevant S. galilaeus populations (one to two
samples per population). 2191 sites of the alignment were
constant, 198 variable characters were parsimony-uninformative and the number of parsimony-informative
characters was 164. Empirical base frequencies in this data
set were A = 0.2721; C = 0.3271; G = 0.1268; T = 0.2740.
Bootstrapped Maximum Parsimony (MP), Maximum
Likelihood (ML) and Neighbour Joining (NJ) trees all
recovered identical 50%-majority rule consensus-trees
(figure 1). As the sistergroup to the monophyletic
Barombi flock a Sarotherodon galilaeus clade was recovered
which includes all west African populations except S. galilaeus sanagaensis which emerged as the sistergroup to all
other ingroup taxa. Within the Barombi Mbo flock four
lineages were recovered with high bootstrap support, one
containing the predators of genus Stomatepia, one combining the fine-particel feeders of the genus Sarotherodon,
one consisting only of the dwarf zooplanctivore Myaka
and one containing the macro-invertebrate or eggfeeding
sistertaxa of the genus Konia plus the highly specialized
spongivore Pungu. For taxa represented by more than one
sample, all conspecific samples grouped together except
those of the morphologically merely distinguishable S.

caroli and S. linnellii. A rough time estimate as deduced
from the ultrametric tree (chronogram) [21] derived from
non parametric rate smoothening (NPRS) of bootstrapped ML-distances suggests that all four lineages
almost simultaneously came into existence, which must
have taken place approx. 1 myr years ago. Soon after this
primary radiation, the divergence of the Pungu haplotypes
from Konia took place, while all other clades radiated into
several species much later. A 94 sample data set with only
cytochrome b and partial proline tRNA sequences (3 to 7
samples for the Barombi taxa, and 1 to 7 for all other;
1212 bp with 1003 constant characters, 59 parsimonyuninformative and 150 parsimony-informative characters) confirmed the previous findings for the Barombi
flock and suggests that lineage sorting between the four
large clades is complete (for a Neighbour Joining Tree see
Additional File 1). However, between species within the
clades lineage sorting was only complete for a subset of
taxa (Pungu, Myaka, Konia ssp, S. lohbergeri and S. steinbachi), but not within Stomatepia ssp., S. caroli and S.
linnellii.
AFLP based phylogenetic inferences
The phylogenetic reconstruction based on the same individuals and using 22 restrictive primer combinations with
3489 AFLP size fragments (3004 variable) confirmed the
monophyletic origin of the Barombi Mbo flock and the
monophyly of the Stomatepia and Konia clades (figure 1).
However, several other phylogenetic groupings were
recovered with high bootstrap support, which contrasted
conspicuously with the mitochondrial phylogenetic
hypothesis. S. gal. multifasciatus and S. gal. "Niger" were
recovered as sistergroups to the clade containing all other
ingroups including S. gal. sanagaensis. Within the Barombi
flock Pungu is now sistergroup to a Sarotherodon subclade
(S. steinbachi and S. lohbergeri), Myaka is sistergroup to the
other Sarotherodon subclade consisting of the pelagic species S. caroli and S. linnellii. The Konia clade is resolved as
the sistergroup to the rest of the flock. In contrast to the
unresolved basal topology in the mitochondrial tree, the
two species from Lake Ejagham are resolved as a monophylum which is the sistergroup to the geographically
closest S. galilaeus population from the river Cross. An
additional data set with 3 selective amplifications but 80
samples recovered only three supraspecific nodes with
moderately high bootstrap support, the monophyly of the
Barombi flock, Konia and the node containing the rest of
the Barombi flock without Pungu. The latter was placed
intermediate between the two well supported nodes.
Testing for sympatric reticulate speciation
Both the Shimodaira-Hasegawa and Templeton's test confirmed significantly the difference for the alternative tree
topologies for each sequence and AFLP data sets, respectively (figure 1). These discordant phylogenies suggested

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/5

strongly that hybridization among previously evolved lineages had taken place and that at least one taxon of the
Barombi Mbo flock, Pungu maclareni, is the result of speciation by hybridization. By identifying the clades which
contain taxa with discordant phylogenies we hypothesized that traces of three ancient hybridization events are
still detectable in the multilocus AFLP data. To test for the
presence of the respective phylogenetic signal for these
three hypothetical ancient syngameons in the large AFLP
data set, we used the recently developed method of
Canonical Phylogenetic Ordination (CPO) [20]. In addition, this method is useful for differentiating between
contributions to variation in the observed AFLP character
pattern that were generated by the segregation of ancestral
polymorphisms inherited from a common ancestor due
to incomplete lineage sorting rather than by the contribution of derived characters of hybridizing lineages. This, as
the contribution to the variation that is assignable to the
phylogenetic group uniting the common ancestor of the
hybridizing lineages (coded as phylogenetic variables) is
partialled out in the CPO separately from the contribution of the phylogenetic groups characterizing the derived
lineages that may have hybridized (see also Methods
section).
All phylogenetic groups detected either by the mitochondrial or the AFLP data set, or formulated according to the
three hypothetical syngameons were coded as phylogenetic variables and their explanatory value for the variance
in the AFLP data set was tested (table 1). As a result,
almost all supraspecific clades which were not conflicting
among the two data sets were recovered as contributing
significantly to the variation in the data set. Conflicting
clades, which were either found in the mitochondrial or
AFLP phylogenetic hypothesis, yielded non-significant
results except for the AFLP based nodes uniting (1) all S.
galilaeus and lake taxa without S. gal multifasciatus and S.
gal "Niger" and (2) the node of the AFLP based hypothesis
of the monophyly of the Lake Ejagham sister pair. Of the
three hypothetical syngameons, the one uniting Pungu
with its potential ancestor clades represented now by the
Konia ssp and S. steinbachi and S. lohbergeri contributed significantly to the variation in the AFLP data set, whereas
the other two did not.
As a final test for the putative hybrid origin of Pungu, a
tree-based method as outlined in Seehausen [6] was performed in order to test for homoplasy excess introduced
by this potential hybrid taxon in the AFLP-data set (figure
2). Only the removal of Pungu resulted in far outlying
higher support values for the respective nodes, whereas all
other removals resulted in much lower values (Fig. 2). In
addition, the other nodes tested were not affected by the
removal of Pungu. Interestingly, the removal of several
other taxa produced far outlier values in other nodes.

Box-plots of the distribution of %-bootstrap support values for the nodes uniting the two Konia species (Figs. 2a) or Sarotherodon lohbergeri and S. steinbachi (Figs. 2b) after iterative removal of single species or taxon groups. Values are based on 2000
bootstrap replicates in the AFLP-based tree reconstruction using the Link et al algorithm [48]; they are based on either the 32sample/2355 loci dataset for the S. lohbergeri/S. steinbachi split or on the 80 sample / 530 loci dataset for the Konia split. Outside
(*) and far outside values (°) are plotted as asterisks and circles, respectively. Arrows denote far outside values resulting in a
distinctly higher bootstrap support for the two clades after exclusion of Pungu maclareni. n refers to the number out of 18 maximum possible removal experiments. Removal of Pungu did not result in outside or far outside bootstrap support values for any
other node out of 30 nodes tested (Additional information concerning far outside values yielded for other nodes see Additional File 2).

However, these removals concerned part of the two hypothetical syngameons that were not supported significantly
in the CPO, which were therefore not explicitly tested. The
removal of Konia dikume resulted in an increased bootstrap support for the clade uniting Konia and Pungu in the
analysis of the 530 loci data set and an accompanying
though weaker signal in the S. caroli/S.linnellii clade. The
removal of S. caroli resulted in a distinct although weak
increase of the bootstrap support for the Myaka/S. linnellii
node, the exclusion of both Myaka and Konia eisentrauti

increased the bootstrap support for the S. linnellii/S. caroli
node. Finally, the removal of S. mariae increased the support for the S. pindu/S. mongo split strongly. Among the
riverine populations of S. galilaeus, the removal of S. gal.
"Meme" increased strongly the value for the clade uniting
the S. gal. "Cross" specimen with the two endemic species
from Lake Ejagham (Details in Additional File 2). These
additional findings suggest that the comparative phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA and AFLP data alone was not sufficient to uncover all possible hybridization events.

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that the sympatric origin of a
diverse and complex species flock was aided substantially
by reticulate evolution among lineages that emerged in a
much smaller primary radiation. Our data suggest that at
least one out of 11 taxa of the species flock in Lake
Barombi Mbo, Pungu maclareni, is the result of speciation
by hybridization. On the other hand, conflicts among
mitochondrial and nuclear data sets as well as results of
the homoplasy excess tests suggest that in the course of the
evolution of the flock hybridization must have taken
place among several additional Barombi taxa, too.
According to the ultrametric time-calibrated tree ("chronogram") based on the well supported phylogeny of mitochondrial haplotypes in the lake, the primary radiation in
Barombi Mbo resulted into the almost instantaneous split
into four distinct lineages approximately one million
years ago. The accumulation of numerous apomorphic
characters that support these mitochondrial lineages suggests strongly that they represented reproductively isolated species at that time. Only in an advanced stage of
species flock formation and after considerable time had
elapsed, their cohesion was broken partially by hybridization events between these lineages. However, according to
the chronogram the ancestral mitochondrial clades that
contributed, for example, to the hybrid origin of Pungu
continued to accumulate apomorphic characters well after
the origin of Pungu. This suggests that the species status of
the ancient hybridizing lineages in terms of sufficient
reproductive isolation must have allowed for their ongoing genetic cohesion and accompanied coalescence of
haplotypes before additional speciation events took place.
Traditionally the rapid origin of megadiverse species
flocks of extremely closely related species was explained
by the combinatory action of three factors: Disruptive natural selection, disruptive sexual selection and partial isolation by distance [22-24]. Although introgression among
species is known for many fish species [7,9,25-27] and
although reticulate evolution and hybrid origins of species are well documented in plants [14], it is only of recent
that hybridization has been proposed to play a major role
in generating diversity in animals in general [27-30] and
in "explosive" speciation in species flocks in particular [6].
Especially in newly colonized habitats with increased ecological opportunities, secondary hybridization of primarily diverged lineages may provide rapidly sources of
heritable advantageous variation by producing additional
adaptive diversity through recombination of functional
genotypes. Interestingly, the species with the most likely
hybrid origin in Lake Barombi Mbo, Pungu maclareni, represents an ecologically highly specialized ecotype. Both its
peculiar dentition and the accompanying hypertrophic
jaw-muscles are unique not only in Barombi Mbo but in

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/5

cichlids in general [31]. Accordingly, one putative second
species with a hybrid genome in the lake, Konia dikume,
ranks among the most unusual cichlids as it is the single
species which is able to exploit chironimid larvae in the
almost oxygen-free deep water due to its extremely high
haemoglobin concentration in its blood [32]. In the light
of our findings we hypothesize that hybridization produced these extreme phenotypes by transgressive segregation which allowed the exploitation of extreme niches.
This supports the notion that speciation by hybridization
is not only able to produce additional random variation
but may significantly increase the ecological complexity in
a rapidly evolving species community by providing
extraordinary genetic opportunities. If indeed transgressive segregation of hybrid genotypes plays a major role in
the evolution of evolutionary novelties, members of complex species-assemblages with unusual ecological adaptations should predictably turn out to be of hybrid origin
more often than species with common adaptations.

Methods
Taxon sampling, collection of samples and deposition of
vouchers
We obtained genetic data from relevant Sarotherodon galilaeus populations and from all species endemic to crater
lakes Barombi Mbo and Ejagham, which are related to S.
galilaeus. Oreochromis niloticus and Sarotherodon melanotheron were used as outgroups based on published information and pilot-study data confirming their outgroup
status with respect to S. galilaeus and the investigated species flocks.

Adult specimens from Lake Barombi Mbo were collected
by UKS during field visits to the lake in 2001 and 2002
and from Lake Ejagham in 1994. Identification to species
is according to Trewavas et al. [33] and was straightforward except for Sarotherodon caroli and S. linnellii. Black
adult breeding males of the S. caroli/S. linnellii-phenotype
from the deepwater were identified as S. caroli, whereas
golden males from the shallow inshore area were identified as S. linnellii. Fin-clips were taken from the right pectoral fin in the field directly after collection and preserved
in 96% Ethanol p.A.. Samples from additional specimens
belonging to different populations of Sarotherodon galilaeus and outgroups were either collected by UKS in the
field in Cameroon or donated by others. Vouchers are
deposited in the ichthyological collection of Bavarian
State Collection of Zoology (ZSM). Of few S. galilaeussamples, only photographs of the specimens are available
and are deposited in the ZSM, too. Informations about
specimens and their species identifications, geographic
origin, accession numbers and information about which
specimens were sequenced and AFLP typed in different
data sets are provided in Additional file 3.

Molecular Methods
DNA Preparation
DNA samples were isolated from approx 10 mm2 fin tissue with the DNeasy™ Tissue Kit (Qiagen). DNA-quality
was visually inspected under UV-light on a 0.8% agarosegel stained with ethidium bromide. For subsequent AFLPanalysis only samples with a clearly visible high-molecular band were used. DNA-concentration was determined
using the VersaFluor-Fluorometer-System (BioRad) using
the stain Picogreen® dsDNA Quantitation Kit (Molecular
Probes). All samples were adjusted to 60 ng/µl.
Mitochondrial DNA Amplification and Sequencing
Two different data sets were assembled, one long data set
with approx. 2550 bp including the complete NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), the complete cytochrome b (cytb) gene and part of the proline tRNA, and
finally, one part of the control region. For this long data
set only two samples per species were used, but a short
data set with more individuals but only the cytochrome b
and the partial proline tRNA genes was generated, too.
ND2 was PCR-amplified using the primers "ND2Met" 5'CATACCCCAAACATGTTGGT-3'"ND2Trp" 5'-GTSGSTTTTCACTCCCGCTTA-3'; a second fragment containing the
cytb, proline and threonine tRNAs and the 5'-end of the
control region was amplified with the primers "L14725"
5'-TGACTTGAAAAACCATCGTTG and "H16498" 5'-CCTGAAGTAGGAACCAGATG [34] ; internal sequencing
primers were the newly designed "cytL640" 5'-CACGAAACCGGATCAAAC-3' for cytochrome b and "L71" 5'TACCCCTAGCTCCCAAAGCT-3'7 for the 5'-end of the
control region. PCR was performed by using a PTC 220
DYAD thermocycler (MJ Research) in a 25 µl reaction volume using the Expand PCR system (Roche Diagnostics)
with 25 pmol of each primer, 20 pmol of dNTPs, 12.5
pmol MgCl2 and 0.88 units of Taq polymerase. PCR
parameters were 94°C for 4 min, 35 cycles with 94°C for
1.5 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1.5 min, followed by a
final elongation at 72°C for 3 min. PCR products were
cleaned by using MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and their DNA-concentration adjusted to 100 ng/
µl. PCR-Products were then used as templates for cyclesequencing reaction using the "Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit" (Applied Biosystems)
with each of the PCR primers or internal primers. Cycle
parameters were the following: 94°C, 2 min; 25 cycles of
94°C, 20 s; 52°C, 10 s; 60°C, 4 min. The sequenced product was filtered through Sephadex-G50 fine (Fluka)
packed spin columns (Amersham) to remove unincorporated dye terminators, primers, and salts, and finally dried
in a speed-vac. These products were resuspended, electrophoresed and analysed with an ABI PRISM™ 377XL-96
automated sequencer using a 4.25 % polyacrylamid gel
(BioRad). Electrophoretic information was transcribed to

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/5

sequence data using the program Genescan (PE Applied
Biosystems).
Individual sequence files were edited and contigs assembled using Sequence Navigator™ (PE Applied Biosystems).
Homologous protein-coding regions (ND2, cytb) were
aligned manually and confirmed by translating DNA data
into amino acid sequences in BioEdit [35]. The short fragment of the control-region was first aligned with default
settings in Clustal W as implemented in Sequence Navigator™. No indels larger than 1 basepair (bp) were detected
and alignment therefore was straightforward. All
sequences were tested for an anti-G bias characteristic of
the mitochondrial DNA to confirm that we have collected
genuine mitochondrial DNA data [36]. Sequence data
have been deposited in GenBank (for accession numbers
se Additional File 3).
Amplified Fragment-Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs)
We followed the original protocol of the AFLP-method
[37] using the AFLP™ Plant Mapping Kit (Applied Biosystems) with slight modifications of the accompanied protocol: Restriction and ligation were carried out in a single
step under standardized conditions in a thermocycler (2 h
at 37°C and 8 h at 16°C). 1,5 µl of the preselective amplification product were used in only 10 µl total reaction volume of the selective amplifications. The restriction
enzymes used were EcoRI and MseI. Primer sequences for
preselective PCR were GACTGCGTACCAATTCA and GATGAGTCCTGAGTAAC. An additional two bases were
added to the 3' end for selective PCR. Analogous to the
mitochondrial data set we assembled two datasets. For the
long one in total 22 primer pairs were used in the following combinations and fluorescent dye-labelling (MseIprimer/ EcoRIDYE): TC-CAFAM, AT-CAFAM, AC-CCNED, TACAFAM, AA-CTFAM; AA-GGJOE; AC-CAFAM; AA-CAFAM; AGCAFAM; AA-CGJOE; AC-CTFAM; AG-CTFAM; AT-CTFAM; AGGGJOE; TC-CTFAM; TA-GGJOE; AG-ACNED; AT-ACNED; AGCCNED; AC-ACNED; AT-CCNED; TA-CGNED. For the short
data only the five primer pairs TC-CAFAM, TA-GGJOE, ACCAFAM, AC-CCNED, AT-CAFAM were used but typed for 80
individuals (see Additional File 3).

Selectively amplified fragments were separated on 6%
LongRanger polyacrylamid gels (FMC BioProducts) with
an ABI PRISM™ 377XL-96 sequencer. Fluorescent signals
were detected using the GENESCAN software (Applied
Biosystems) with internal size standard (GS-500 ROX;
Applied Biosystems). The fluorescent threshold was set to
50 units and the correct identification of ROX-marker
bands by GENESCAN was checked for all
electropherograms.
Bands between 100.5 bp and 499.5 bp were scored in a
first step for presence or absence using the software

Binthere (developed by N. Garnhart and available
through the T. Kocher laboratory http://hcgs.unh.edu.
The program generates aligned spreadsheets from GENESCAN-sized AFLP-data by assigning each sized fragment to
a size-class of user-defined distance to the next size-class.
Using a spreadsheet routine, fragments were inferred in a
second step to be homologous if they differed by no more
than 1.00 bp, and if the scoring procedure identified the
same size-classes whether scored from small to large sizefragments (forward) or vice versa (backward). Size-classes
with inconsistent allocation of fragments according to forward and backward scoring were excluded, as well as adjacent size-classes differing by less than 0.35 bp, which
corresponds to the double standard deviation of 0.15 bp
of the sequencer [38]. As a result of this procedure a final
0/1 data-matrix for all scored individuals was prepared.
All samples of the same primer combination were run on
same gel for the 33 specimen dataset and on two gels for
the 80 taxon dataset. Single unsuccessful amplifications
were repeated and fitted to the data matrix using the sizeclass assignment criteria as outlined above.

10 random stepwise additions of taxa for 33 sequence set
and simple addition for the 94 sequence set; gaps in the
control region treated as a 5th character). Non-parametric
bootstrapping with 1000 (ME or MP analyses) or 100
(ML) pseudoreplicates was used for testing the robustness
of the inferred trees. Tree topologies using the HLRT settings under ME were not different from topologies gained
with AIC settings (data not shown).

Phylogenetic Analyses
Mitochondrial Sequence Data
MrModeltest 1.1b [39], a simplified version of David
Posada's "Modeltest 3.06" [40] was used to perform hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (HLRT) and to calculate
approximate Akaike Information criteria (AIC) to determine the optimal nucleotide substitution models for the
dataset. If the two tests did not select the same model, we
chose AIC over HLRT, as AIC is a useful measure that
rewards models for good fit but imposes a penalty for
unnecessary parameters [41,42], which may cause erroneous phylogenetic conclusions especially in Bayesean phylogenetic analyses [43]. For the 33 sequence dataset the
HLRT selected the HK+I+Γ model (α = 0.2781; proportion
of invariable sites = 0) a transition/transversion (Ti/tv)
ratio of 8.5662 was calculated. The AIC selected the
HKY+I+ Γ model (α = 0.9468; proportion of invariable
sites = 0.4264) with a transition/transversion ratio of
8.6616. For the 94 sequence dataset, the HLRT selected
the GTR+ Γ model (α = 0.4014; proportion of invariable
sites = 0), whereas AIC selected the GTR+I model (proportion of invariable sites = 0.5817). Empirical base frequencies in the data 2553/1212 data sets were A = 0.2443/
0.2440; C = 0.3264/0.3261; G = 0.1443/0.1446; T =
0.2581/0.2852.

AFLP Data
We used PAUP* [44] to calculate the skewness parameter
g1 [47] to test for adequacy of phylogenetic signal in the
0/1-data set. g1 calculated from 1000000 random trees
revealed significant non-random structure under the parsimony optimality criterion in the 22 restrictive amplifications for the complete data set: g1 -0.805, 33 samples,
3004 variable sites out of 3489 scored); g1 values were
lower in the 3 restrictive amplifications data set used for
some homoplasy excess tests (see below): g1 -0.298, 80
samples, 717 variable sites out of 859 scored. 2355 and
530 loci respectively were parsimony informative within
Sarotherodon galilaeus sensu lato (excluding Oreochromis
niloticus and Sarotherodon melanotheron). "Pruned" data
matrices using only those parsimony informative sites
were constructed for Principal Canonical Ordination and
homoplasy excess tests (see below) in order to account for
noise in the data potentially introduced by the distant
outgroup. Pairwise genetic distances were calculated from
the binary data-matrix with two different algorithms: One
developed by Link et al. [48] as implemented in
TREECON v.1.3b [49], which is based on shared and
unique characters and ignores shared absence. This algorithm is adequate for AFLP data, since noise in the data
may often be created by weak signal intensities and hence
absence of band-detection despite a possible weak presence of signal. Alternatively, we calculated pair-wise distance matrices with the restriction-site program RESTDIST
within the PHYLIP 3.6A2 package [50]. Trees were constructed from the Link et al.-distances with the neighbour
joining (NJ) algorithm as implemented within TREECON
or from the RESTDIST-distances using the Fitch-and-Margoliash-algorithm [51] with unconstrained branch length

The AIC settings were subsequently used for Maximum
Likelihood (ML) analyses and to estimate ML distances
for minimum evolution (ME) analyses in the program
PAUP* 4.0b1.0 (PPC/Altivec) [44] and for the 94
sequence dataset in Treefinder [45]. Maximum Parsimony
(MP) analyses were conducted with heuristic searches
(TBR branch swapping and MULTREES option effective;

A LRT [46] as implemented in PAUP* was performed with
the respective 33 sequence ME tree under the AIC model
assumptions with (-ln L = 6770.47061) and without (-ln
L = 7120.92833) molecular clock enforced. Overall constancy of rates of evolution was rejected (chi2 = 701.0154,
df = 32, p = 0.001). To date cladogenetic events in the
absence of rate constancy, the nonparametric rate
smoothing (NPRS) method [21] as implemented in Treefinder [45] was used to construct an ultrametric tree
("chronogram") using the bootstrapped 33 sequence ML
derived tree-topology and associated bootstrapped
branch lengths as input.

(b) Numbers at nodes in the mtDNA-chronogram refer to bootstrap-values of the ML (above) and MP (below) tree reconstructions. The absolute time scale above the tree is based on the maximum

mitochondrial data or the Templeton's Wilcoxon signedrank test [53] for AFLP-data (both as implemented in
PAUP*).
In order to test for the presence of a phylogenetic signal
that possibly reflects reticulate events in the AFLP-data,
two methods were applied.

First, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed using CANOCO 4.0 [54]. This method has previously been used successfully for testing the effect of treelike hydrogeographic data and supplementary ecological
data on microsatellite allele-frequencies in freshwater
fishes [55], as well as an alternative to traditional phylogenetic comparative methods [20]. A presence/absence
matrix with the 2355 AFLP-characters which were parsimony-informative within the Sarotherodon galilaeus-clade

(S. galilaeus sensu lato and lake endemics) provided the
data-matrix to be tested. Phylogenetic hypotheses derived
from mtDNA- and AFLP-analyses as well as hypothetical
syngameons as derived from the conflict between the two
data-sets were translated into a phylogenetic matrix by
assigning binary indicator variables, each coding for the
membership of investigated samples to phylogenetic
groups (e.g. nodes in phylogenetic trees or hypothetical
syngameons) [20,54]. 9999 full model Monte Carlo (MC)
permutations were used to test whether a given phylogenetic group as coded by the indicator variables and identified by automatic forward selection of variables was
significantly related to the AFLP-data pattern.

Second, a tree-based method as outlined in Seehausen [6]
was performed in order to test for homoplasy excess introduced by potential hybrid taxa in the AFLP-data as suggested by the mtDNA-AFLP-phylogeny conflict and the
CCA. Theoretically, hybrid taxa are overall intermediate to
the parental taxa because they carry a mosaic of parental
characters. Consequently, the inclusion of a hybrid taxon
into a multilocus based phylogeny estimate introduces an
excess of homoplasies and therefore conflict in the subset
of clades that contributed to hybridization. Removal of
the putative hybrid taxon should therefore decrease the
amount of homoplasies and hence increase support for
those nodes that unite descendants from taxa which gave
rise to a hybrid taxon. In contrast, removal of a nonhybrid taxon should not affect support for the respective
nodes. We computed Link et al bootstrap-supports (2000
replicates) for the nodes uniting Sarotherodon steinbachi
and S. lohbergeri in the 2355 loci data with n = 16 experiments (each taxon removed once). Analogous support
values for the node uniting the Konia eisentrauti and K.
dikume were computed with the 530 loci data set with n =
14 experiments, because bootstrap support in the larger
data set was always larger than 98.85% and identical runs
yielded values differing by more than 1.15 % (data not
shown). By reducing the number of loci but increasing the
number of samples we obtained a meaningful distribution of bootstrap support values for that node.
