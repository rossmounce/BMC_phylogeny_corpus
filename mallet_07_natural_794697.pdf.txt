Abstract
Background: To understand speciation and the maintenance of taxa as separate entities, we need
information about natural hybridization and gene flow among species.
Results: Interspecific hybrids occur regularly in Heliconius and Eueides (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in the
wild: 26–29% of the species of Heliconiina are involved, depending on species concept employed.
Hybridization is, however, rare on a per-individual basis. For one well-studied case of species hybridizing
in parapatric contact (Heliconius erato and H. himera), phenotypically detectable hybrids form around 10%
of the population, but for species in sympatry hybrids usually form less than 0.05% of individuals. There is
a roughly exponential decline with genetic distance in the numbers of natural hybrids in collections, both
between and within species, suggesting a simple "exponential failure law" of compatibility as found in some
prokaryotes.
Conclusion: Hybridization between species of Heliconius appears to be a natural phenomenon; there is
no evidence that it has been enhanced by recent human habitat disturbance. In some well-studied cases,
backcrossing occurs in the field and fertile backcrosses have been verified in insectaries, which indicates
that introgression is likely, and recent molecular work shows that alleles at some but not all loci are
exchanged between pairs of sympatric, hybridizing species. Molecular clock dating suggests that gene
exchange may continue for more than 3 million years after speciation. In addition, one species, H. heurippa,
appears to have formed as a result of hybrid speciation. Introgression may often contribute to adaptive
evolution as well as sometimes to speciation itself, via hybrid speciation. Geographic races and species that
coexist in sympatry therefore form part of a continuum in terms of hybridization rates or probability of
gene flow. This finding concurs with the view that processes leading to speciation are continuous, rather
than sudden, and that they are the same as those operating within species, rather than requiring special
punctuated effects or complete allopatry. Although not qualitatively distinct from geographic races, nor
"real" in terms of phylogenetic species concepts or the biological species concept, hybridizing species of
Heliconius are stably distinct in sympatry, and remain useful groups for predicting morphological, ecological,
behavioural and genetic characteristics.

Background
The importance of natural hybridization between species
Recently, major strides have been made in understanding
the genetics and ecology of the species boundary in animals. The discreteness, and "reality" of species is being
eroded both below and above the level of species. Below
the species level, forms are known which remain distinct
in spite of potential or actual gene flow. Examples are:
host races in phytophagous insects [1,2] and other parasites [3-5], and ecologically or sexually divergent coexisting forms of animals as diverse as sea anemones [6],
cicadas [7] fish [8-10], dolphins [11] and killer whales
[12]. There is perpetual doubt about the status of related
forms which replace one another geographically. New
molecular evidence, coupled with revised species concepts
has led to taxonomic inflation whereby many readily
identifiable taxa, formerly regarded as subspecies within
polytypic "biological" species have been upgraded to full
species status [13], in spite of abundant hybridization in
contact zones. Above the species level, we are beginning to
appreciate that hybridization, while rare on a per-individual basis, is a regular and probably important occurrence
in nature [14-17]. On average, at least 10% of animal species and maybe 25% of plant species are known to hybridize in nature, although the fraction of species that
hybridize may be much higher in rapidly radiating groups
[18].

ical species concept [23,24]. However, "... taxa that remain
distinct despite gene exchange have in fact been classified
as separate species even by the originators of the biological species concept. Thus there is a clash between two
views of species; one is based on the pattern of gene flow,
and the other on the maintenance of a cluster of phenotypes ... stable to invasion by foreign genes" [23]. To
understand the maintenance of separateness and evolution of species, we need to understand facts about hybridization and gene flow between clusters of phenotypes in
nature.
As a part of this movement, many studies have now been
done on hybrid zones [23,26,27] and on host races
[1,2,28]. However hybrid zone studies have concentrated
on parapatric zones of hybridization where hybrids are
abundant enough to sample easily. Under the biological
species concept, hybridization in such zones is between
geographic races, and arguably demonstrates a failure to
complete speciation, rather than giving many clues to speciation or species maintenance. In addition, host races can
be argued not to be "good species", and therefore could be
viewed as having little relevance to interspecific hybridization. Furthermore, even when species that hybridize in
sympatry are accepted to be "good species", it could be
argued that this is unimportant because no gene flow
results; the hybrids may be too sterile or inviable to produce any offspring. Although it is difficult to obtain adequate sample sizes, it would be useful to have more
studies of natural hybridization between taxa generally
recognized as species, between which natural hybrids are
very rare, usually much less than 1%, compared to parental forms from the same area, as well as investigations into
back-crossing to parental species.

In the past, hybridization was viewed as a secondary phenomenon of little or no evolutionary importance (e.g. ref.
[19]: 133). Associated with this view was the idea that
actual intermediate stages of speciation could be seen
only rarely in nature [20,21], because hybrids were unnatural. This in turn led to a strong emphasis on speciation
due to geographic isolation, especially rapid speciation
via the "founder effect" [19]. Hybrid zones between differentiated parapatric species or subspecies were therefore
interpreted as zones of secondary contact: differentiation
was assumed to have occurred in allopatry. Hybridization
was even defined by Mayr as "the crossing of individuals
belonging to two natural populations that have secondarily come into contact" (ref. [19]: 110). Alternatively,
hybrids and hybridization can be viewed as natural intermediate stages of a gradual process of differentiation, possibly in sympatry or parapatry, rather than as unnatural
secondary phenomena [14,18,22,23].

Here, we review natural interspecific hybridization in a
particularly well studied group, neotropical butterflies of
the subtribe Heliconiina. Our survey contributes to a reappraisal of the nature of species and speciation. We investigate whether a group of sexual and dioecious animals
obey the same fundamental laws of gene flow and introgression as plants and bacteria. Building on a firm base of
systematic, genetic, and ecological work on Heliconius and
their relatives, these data give unrivalled information on
the continuum between polymorphisms, races, semi-species, and species in nature.

Since the evolutionary synthesis, a dominant definition of
species in evolutionary biology has been the so-called
"biological species concept" [19-21]. Under this concept,
members of the same species "actually or potentially
interbreed" [19], whereas members of different species
cannot do so. Although other, competing definitions of
species exist [24,25], most recent studies of speciation
claim to have been elaborated and tested using the biolog-

Natural hybridization between species of Heliconius and
Eueides
Heliconius and related genera are currently classified as
subtribe Heliconiina in the Heliconiinae, a subfamily of
Nymphalidae [29-32]. Their bright colours and rampant
morphological diversification of geographic races within
species and between species have led them being highly
prized by collectors, and a good representation of speci-

mens is found in museums and private hands worldwide.
The Heliconiina are distasteful to predators, and their
diverse colour patterns are explained as adaptations for
warning colour and Müllerian mimicry. They mimic other
butterfly groups, particularly the Ithomiinae, but a substantial fraction mimic unrelated species within the Heliconiina [33,34]. Detailed studies on ecology, behaviour,
systematics, mimicry, genetics and speciation of this
group have been carried out [29,35-39]. Scattered reports
of natural hybrids between Heliconius species have
appeared [40-47], but this is the first attempt to collate
and analyse all known cases of interspecific hybridization
across the Heliconiina. We here review hybridization for
the whole subtribe, and report many new hybrids, including previously undocumented examples within the genus
Eueides.
We put the hybrids into their phylogenetic context.
According to morphological [29,32] and molecular evidence [30,31] on the phylogeny of Heliconius, the subtribe can for our purposes be divided into a number of
sub-groups (Fig. 1). There is a basal group of small genera
(Philaethria, Agraulis, Dione, Podotricha, Dryadula, Dryas).
The genus Heliconius and allies form the bulk of the group,
consisting of Eueides and Heliconius sensu lato as sister taxa.
Heliconius sensu lato consists of four major groups. First
there are the "basal species" consisting of two small segregate genera (Neruda and Laparus) close to Heliconius sensu
stricto. Some molecular data suggest that these two genera
nest within Heliconius sensu stricto, but other loci and morphological data suggest they may fall outside Heliconius
[30,32]; these two lineages are therefore shown provisionally as a polytomy with the two major sensu stricto lineages
from the base of Heliconius in Fig. 1. The third group is the
melpomene-cydno-silvaniform group, consisting of three
probably monophyletic subgroups: (i) the wallacei/burneyi
and xanthocles/hecuba subgroup (ii) a "silvaniform" subgroup, in which atthis, hecale, ethilla, ismenius, numata, and
pardalinus are mainly Müllerian mimics of the yellow and
brown "tiger pattern" Ithomiinae, while besckei and elevatus have red and yellow more typically heliconiine mimicry patterns; (iii) a melpomene subgroup containing
Heliconius melpomene and H. cydno, as well as a handful of
segregate "species" – timareta, tristero, heurippa, and pachinus – which are probably most closely related to cydno.
The final, erato-sara-sapho group also consists of two parts
– the erato subgroup and the sara/sapho/charithonia subgroup (Fig. 1).

hybrid specimens on which Table 1 is based are available
from Additional File 1. To save space, we display only
hybrids; pure forms are illustrated in several useful books
which cover the genus [44,48,49]. Detailed lists of known
hybrid specimens, discussions of the specimens, laboratory evidence for hybridization, and estimates of frequency in the most abundant forms are given in
Additional File 2. Raw mtDNA divergence data [30] are
given in Additional File 3. A full database of Additional
File 1 is provided as downloadable comma-delimited text
in Additional File 4.
Hybrids are unknown from the basal genera of the Heliconiina, or from Neruda, Laparus and the basal group of
Heliconius, all of which consist of distantly related species
highly divergent from one another at mtDNA (Fig. 1). As
many of these species are well known and common, the
complete lack of hybrids among basal Heliconiina seems
unlikely to be due to sampling bias. All known hybrids
belong to the three major recent radiations: Eueides, and
the melpomene-cydno-silvaniform and erato-sara-sapho
groups of Heliconius. There is a strong negative correlation between mtDNA divergence and the numbers of
hybrids found in the wild (Fig. 3). Backcross hybrids are
mainly known in cases of hybridization between the less
divergent hybridizing pairs (Fig. 3). Given mtDNA
sequence evolution of ~ 2%/My [50], this hybridization
and backcrossing suggests the possibility of continued
introgression up to 3–4 million years, and sometimes
more, after initial divergence (Figs. 1, 3).

Results and Discussion

Existence and geographic relations of hybridizing species
It is clear from our data that interspecific hybridization
regularly occurs within Eueides and Heliconius. In a few
cases the parents of obvious hybrids are in doubt, for
example within Eueides or the silvaniforms (Additional
Files 1, 2). It is even possible that a few of the more recent
hybrids were "manufactured" in captivity for sale to
unwary collectors. Yet the majority of specimens we cite
here are natural interspecific hybrids of known parentage.
We have good evidence for this from many different collectors, and from a large geographic range, including
many collections occurring before insectary breeding
became widely practised in the 1980s. Although we have
uncovered a substantial number of previously unknown
hybrids, previous authors have come to similar conclusions about some of the few specimens known previously
(Additional File 2). In many cases, we now have laboratory crossing and molecular evidence for hybridization or
introgression (Additional File 2)

thonia × H. peruvianus, the hybridizing taxa are parapatric.
We consider these to be species pairs operationally on the
grounds that intermediates are rare in areas of contact
compared with parental forms (Additional File 2)
[37,46,51-55].
The most abundant hybridizations are between very
closely related species or sister taxa, for example between
H. melpomene and H. cydno. However, there is plenty of
evidence for hybridization between non-sister species, for
example between H. numata and other silvaniforms and
H. melpomene. Hybridization of ismenius, hecale, atthis,
melpomene and cydno in insectaries by Gilbert [47] & JeanPierre Vesco (Additional File 1) confirm that such non-sister hybridization is possible and indeed leads to viable
backcrossing. Similarly, H. erato hybridizes with its sister
species H. himera wherever the two meet, but also with the
more distantly related H. charithonia (Fig. 1). The Eueides
hybrids involving isabella and vibilia and at least two other
species each must also logically involve some non-sister
hybridization.
Hybridization and introgression between species is often
associated with rapid adaptive radiation on islands; for
example in the Darwin's finches on the Galapagos, the

Hawaiian silverswords (Compositae) or Hawaiian Drosophila, the birds of paradise in New Guinea, cichlids in
African lakes, or fish colonists of glacial lakes in the
Northern Hemisphere. This study shows that hybridization is not just a feature of island radiations: Heliconius is
a highly successful genus in the mainland and lowlands of
the continent with the most diverse biota on earth. However, hybridizing species are all within Eueides and the two
major "non-basal" groups of Heliconius. These are the
three monophyletic groups that appear to be radiating
most rapidly compared with less speciose sister groups
within the subtribe (Fig. 1); thus, hybridization in Heliconius is most likely a general feature of relatively recent
radiations, and is not restricted to islands.
Frequency of hybridization as a fraction of the population
It is clear that the frequency of hybridization is low on a
per-individual basis, as in birds: "Hybrids form in only a
very minute percentage of the individuals in all the species
mentioned, and I know of no case in which the occurrence
of hybrids has resulted in a blurring of the border line
between these species" ([21]: 262). On the other hand, as
Mayr admitted, such statements contain a tautology: "The
definition of hybridization as 'the crossing of individuals
belonging to two different species' results in circular argu-

Figure 3
A graphical representation of the species boundary
A graphical representation of the species boundary.
The numbers of natural hybrids known between pairs of species (from Table 1) are plotted on a logarithmic scale against
the average uncorrected DNA divergence estimated from
data for 1569 bp of mtDNA [30]. If backcrosses are also
known from wild specimens, a halo around the point is
shown. Comparisons reflect only species that have zones of
overlap; average distance measures are given in Additional
File 3. There are no known hybrids between species groups,
and no estimates of divergence have been included for intergroup comparisons (Neruda and Laparus are here treated as
part of the melpomene-cydno-silvaniform group to which they
are closest in mtDNA divergence). A least-squares exponential fit of the species data alone is shown. (To display species
pairs which lack known hybrids on the log-linear plot, they
have been assigned 0.1 hybrids each, but the fitted line is
based on a non-linear regression with untransformed data).
Because the comparisons are non-independent, especially
where branches of the same phylogeny or even the same
species are used twice, a simple statistical analysis is not
appropriate (under an assumption of independence, there is
a highly significant negative correlation between in rates of
hybridization and genetic distance: N = 180, P = 0.0022,
although the proportion of the variance explained is not high,
r2 = 5%, because of the large number of species pairs for
which no hybrids are known). Intraspecific hybridization also
approximately fits this scheme; smaller square points in blue
represent the equivalent numbers of intraspecific hybrids in
world collections (not used in curve fitting). These were estimated by counting the numbers of intraspecific hybrids
(between morphologically divergent subspecies) in the 2001
catalogue of the W. Neukirchen collection, and dividing by
the fraction of total interspecific hybrids in the Neukirchen
collection over the total known worldwide.
ment because the decision whether or not to include two
populations in the same or in two different species may
depend on the occurrence of hybridization" ([19]: 111).
Obviously, hybridization and gene flow must be rare

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/28

whether the biological species concept or even a characterbased criterion of species is used, because a total "blurring
of the border line" would result in a single species being
recognized. Although hybrids must be rare, it is not circular to estimate how rare they are. Mayr ([19]: 114) estimated that only one out of 60,000 specimens of birds
(across all species) was a true interspecific hybrid. In the
birds of paradise, about 30 hybrids were found in 100,000
skins [21], or 0.03%. These values seem about right for
Heliconius as well. Morphologically detectable hybrids
between H. erato and H. himera form 9.8% of the population in the centre of the best-studied hybrid zone [46], but
this is an unusually high rate, and occurs only between
two species that replace one another across an extremely
restricted hybrid zone. For the most abundantly hybridizing pair of fully sympatric species, Heliconius melpomene
and H. cydno, the fraction of hybrids in natural sympatric
populations is usually of the order of 0.05% or less (Additional File 2).
Frequency of hybridization as a fraction of species
Although hybrid individuals are rare, the frequency of
hybridization per species is high. In all, 16 recognized species out of 46 Heliconius sensu lato are involved in hybridization, or 35%. (The "sensu lato" count includes Laparus
and Neruda, but excludes Eueides). Species designations
are based on Lamas' checklist [56], except that we here
consider H. hewitsoni and H. pachinus as separate species
from H. sapho and H. cydno respectively. The parapatric
Heliconius cydno, H. pachinus, H. heurippa, H. timareta and
H. tristero may all be considered to form part of a single
species, as could H. hortense + H. clysonymus, and H. sapho
+ H. hewitsoni. If these changes are made, hybridization
involves 13 species of a total of 40, giving 33% of species
hybridizing. For Eueides, 5 out of 12 species are involved
in hybridization, a fraction of 42%. Overall, there are 73
species of Heliconiina, of which 21 species hybridize, considering cydno, and clysonymus and sapho group species as
separate, giving 29%: with the species lumped, 18/67 species hybridize, or 27%. Thus, at least a quarter of all Heliconiina species are involved in natural interspecific
hybridization.

The fraction of heliconiine species that hybridize in nature
is higher than for animals as a whole (~ 10%), and similar
to that of British vascular plants (~ 25%) [18]. However,
many smaller groups have higher fractions of hybridizing
species than animals as a whole, such as the North American Papilio [57], the American warblers, ducks and birds
of paradise [18], similar to or exceeding that of the Heliconiina. Even these high rates of hybridization are bound
to be underestimates, since there may be many cases in
which extremely rare hybrids have remained uncollected,
and because hybridization is often hard to detect via morphology in closely similar pairs of species.

Factors affecting rates of hybridization
It is often said that hybridization between species is distributed patchily among taxonomic groups. According to
Mayr ([21]: 260–263, [19]:126–127), natural hybrids in
birds are more commonly found in highly dimorphic species such as ducks, game birds, and birds of paradise, that
are commonly polygamous or have lekking sexual behaviour. Mayr argued that the short contact period between
mates in these species led to more "mistakes". However,
this cannot explain high rates of hybridization in the
American warblers [18], nor in Heliconius, whose males
and females mate few times, on average [29,35]. Prager &
Wilson [58] used a molecular clock argument to propose
that amphibians and birds could remain compatible
enough to hybridize for over 20 million years, whereas
mammals lose their capacity for hybridization after only
2–3 million years. These authors argue that regulatory
gene evolution of intrinsic barriers to hybridization has
occurred more rapidly in mammals than in birds or
amphibia. However, from broader taxonomic surveys
[18], there are few differences between several major taxa
in propensity to natural hybridization. The fractions of
species known to hybridize in the wild seem not very different among birds, European mammals or European butterflies (9%, 6%, 11%, respectively) [18]. The minor
variation among these large surveys is likely to reflect differences in bias or average times of divergence, rather than
fundamental differences in regulatory gene action.

A number of biases that affect the per-species estimates of
hybridization rate may inflate the apparent heterogeneity.
Firstly, colour patterns or other morphology may differ
strongly between species in both sexes. This is the case in
many brightly coloured birds and butterflies, and it is
especially a characteristic of mimetic butterflies such as
Heliconius. Hybrids will then be more detectable than
among drab, relatively uniform taxa. Several other probable examples of such biases have already been given [18].
Thus the apparently high fraction of species hybridizing in
ducks, birds of paradise, American warblers, as well as the
Heliconiina may not be unusual, or due to the effects of
polygamy, but is likely to be closer to the true value
because of the greater detectability of hybrids these
groups. Sister species will more frequently differ in colour
pattern than in drabber groups of comparable size where
hybrids would often remain undetected.
On the other hand, it would certainly be surprising if there
were no heterogeneity in hybridization among phylogenetic lineages, which could be due to differences in the
average ages of sister taxa and speciation rate, as well as
inherent effects of the rates of buildup of incompatibilities in different taxa. Within a lineage such as the Heliconiina, the main factor is probably the age of taxa and
correlated effects on species compatibility. This seems to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/28

be the case here, where no hybrids are known among the
older taxa in the "primitive genera" (Figs. 1, 3), and
hybridization is restricted to the three most recently diversified groups: genus Eueides, the erato-sara-sapho group and
the melpomene-cydno-silvaniform group within the genus
Heliconius.
Is hybridization natural?
Mayr [19] argued forcefully that hybridization in the wild
was normally due to a "breakdown in isolating mechanisms", particularly after human disturbance of the species' normal habitat. Although this view arises from a
somewhat dated view of "isolating mechanisms" as traits
beneficial to the species as a whole [59], the argument that
hybridization is less intense in pristine habitats is still
prevalent today. Clearly, humans might alter habitats in
ways which could increase or decrease levels of hybridization. There are frequent conservation concerns when
introduced taxa hybridize with native relatives [60,61].

In Heliconius, most hybrids are so rare that we cannot for
certain say whether they are becoming commoner as a
result of habitat alteration. However, many of the hybrid
specimens recorded here were collected in the last century
or early this century, long before the major episode of
rainforest destruction accompanying widespread deployment of the axe and chainsaw. Human activities in rainforests can boost the growth of Passiflora foodplants in
light gaps, and can greatly change the densities of Heliconius, and have probably done so since people arrived in the
Americas. However, perhaps one of the clearest examples
of human-associated habitat change is the case of a pair of
species that probably hybridized more frequently in prehistoric times. The denuded area in Costa Rica now separating Heliconius cydno (Atlantic slopes and lowlands)
from H. pachinus (Pacific slopes and lowlands) should
have been suitable for both species. Today the central plateau of Costa Rica lacks suitable rainforest biotopes due to
the spread of the capital city of San José in the centre of the
probable contact zone [55].
The pair between which we have most hybrid specimens
recorded consists of Heliconius cydno and H. melpomene.
Even though the species overlap extensively, H. cydno is
normally found in small lightgaps or in the understory of
lowland tropical forest, and is commoner in uplands to
about 1800 m than melpomene. Heliconius melpomene, on
the other hand, is commoner at lower elevations and in
more open habitats, such as at the margins of rivers, in
savannahs, or scrubby second growth [62,63]. Forest
destruction might therefore tend to improve life for melpomene, while causing H. cydno to retreat. However, while
there will have been changes of distribution, and possibly
even a temporary increase in contact due to invasion of
melpomene into habitat with declining populations of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:28

cydno, there would always have been plenty of contact
between the two species in Central America, western
Colombia and Ecuador, and in the valleys and slopes of
the Andes. An increase in patchy "edge" habitat might
have caused hybridization rates between the two species
to have changed, but overlap and resultant hybridization
almost certainly occurred regularly without human intervention.
The species with the next highest numbers of hybrid specimens, Heliconius himera and H. erato, are found together
only in very narrow zones of overlap. Again, there are habitat differences between the species: H. himera is found in
higher and drier environments than its close relative erato
in southern Ecuador and northern Peru [45]. Contacts
with hybridization are found in three areas (Additional
File 1; [36]). Near Rodríguez de Mendoza in N. Peru, we
do not know the exact source of the H. himera that hybridizes with the commoner H. erato (they probably originate
from the Río Marañon drainage near Chachapoyas) so it
is unclear whether habitat disturbance has been to blame.
In the other two contact zones, in ravines and gallery forests in southern Ecuador and along the Río Marañon in
northern Peru, it is likely that contact was more, rather
than less extensive before transition zone forests were
felled for agriculture. Here, the species are today restricted
to steep forested ravines [36,45].
In most other cases of hybridization in the heliconiines
there is no obvious reason why hybridization should be
solely a result of human interference, even though
human-wrought changes in the neotropics have been
extensive over the last century. In summary, nothing in
the ecology or distribution of any of these species leads
one to believe that hybridization started only recently,
and only as a result of human habitat disturbance.
A general law of speciation? The species boundary as an
exponential failure law
Is there any evidence for a well-demarcated species
boundary in these butterflies? If species have a discrete
"reality" of reproductive isolation, we might expect a
sharp discontinuity in reproductive isolation between
geographic races and species. In Fig. 3, we plot numbers of
hybrids known between pairs of races or pairs of species
against mtDNA divergence. Rates of hybridization (measured by numbers of hybrids) between species are negatively correlated with the degree of genetic divergence.
Assuming that molecular evolution is relatively clock-like,
this implies that the frequency of hybridization is related
to the time since divergence. This relationship extends
even to intraspecific levels. Divergence between members
of the same species is usually less than about 1.8% for this
region of mtDNA (Fig. 3), and the fitted line therefore predicts even more hybrids between geographic races in col-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/28

lections than between species, as indeed is observed (Fig.
3). In heliconiine butterflies, "reproductive isolation"
between populations and between species is not only
approximately continuously distributed, but also the
effect of genetic divergence between species predicts this
relationship.
Although the exact form of the relationship between
genetic distance and hybridization probability is not clear
from the noisy data available in Fig. 3, the curve is more
or less continuous. An increasing failure to hybridize with
genetic divergence might be expected to follow an "exponential failure law", the probability distribution that predicts failure of simple mechanical or other devices, such as
light-bulbs, with time. An exponential line of fit is plotted
in the fitted curve of Fig. 3, and similar log-linear effects of
genetic divergence on gene flow occur in transformation
experiments with bacteria [64]. An illusion that species
are completely reproductively isolated can also be
explained by this exponential law: hybrids become too
rare to be detected once divergence has proceeded a long
way, even though the underlying exponential probability
distribution from which hybrids are sampled is actually
continuous.
Rather than demonstrating a special effect applying only
to eukaryotic, sexual species for which reproductive isolation has some meaning, our data shows that heliconiines
approximately follow a log-linear compatibility failure
law similar to that found in normally asexual prokaryotes.
The chief difference is slope: Bacillus exchange genes at a
thousandth of the within-strain rate even when chromosomal DNA differs by as much as 20% [64]; in heliconiines, natural hybridization becomes vanishingly rare (i.e.
falls bellow the single-hybrid "veil line") beyond about
8% mtDNA divergence (Fig. 3). The difference in slope is
not surprising in view of the large differences in biology:
failure of bacterial transformation might be due to a lack
of uptake of foreign DNA by the bacterial cell wall
(although apparently this is not the case in Bacillus), or to
a failure of the DNA to integrate into the host genome. In
heliconiines, failure to produce hybrids depends on
behaviour and the probability of mating, and on the fitnesses of hybrid zygotes. Nonetheless, although mechanisms for gene exchange are very different, leading to
different slopes, there is an underlying similarity of the
species boundary in terms of overall shape and continuity
in these very different taxa.
Evolutionary importance of hybridization
Heliconius interspecific hybrid females that have been
studied in the laboratory are often sterile, while hybrid
males are fertile (Table 1) [47,65,66]. These are examples
of Haldane's rule, in which the heterogametic sex (the
female in Lepidoptera) suffers greater inviability or steril-

Page 9 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:28

ity than the homogametic sex (the male in Lepidoptera)
[67]. The H. erato × H. himera, H. pachinus × H. cydno and
H. heurippa × H. cydno hybrids are exceptions that are fertile in both sexes [55,68]. Although female sterility is a
characteristic of hybrids between species such as H. cydno
and H. melpomene [47,65,69], Haldane's rule sterility has
recently been found between geographic populations
considered members of the same species, and even
between different populations of the same subspecies
(Heliconius melpomene melpomene [70]), indicating that
even hybrid sterility is not an infallible characteristic of
species [71].
In all of the laboratory hybridizations of Heliconius studied to date, male hybrids are fertile, even where female
hybrids are completely sterile, or sterile in one direction
[47,65,66,70]. The presence of backcross hybrids in the
wild in a number of these species indicates that introgression may occur, largely in pairs of less divergent species,
but even in some rather divergent species. There is clear
evidence for natural backcrossing in eight pairs of Heliconius species (Fig. 3), representing around 62% of the 13
least divergent hybridizations. In contrast, none of the five
most divergent species hybrids show evidence of backcrossing. In the laboratory, backcross broods between
cydno and melpomene and between erato and himera are fertile, and can be used to introduce genes from one species
to another [47,66,72]. Although the initial hybridization
can be difficult due to strong assortative mating, genes
from hecale, atthis, ismenius, melpomene and cydno in the
melpomene-cydno-silvaniform group can apparently be
mixed together at will in the laboratory (Additional Files
1, 2; [47]). The similarity of allelic frequencies at some
loci, and the strong differences at others in H. himera and
H. erato can be explained by selective gene flow at some
loci [51]. Two recent studies [54,55] have demonstrated
sharing of some, but not all molecular markers between
Heliconius melpomene, Heliconius cydno, and H. pachinus.
For example, in both studies, similar or identical haplotypes were found at the autosomal gene Mpi, while the
same species were entirely distinct at the sex-linked gene
Tpi. In both studies, also, mitochondrial DNA showed no
evidence of introgression, as expected due to Haldane's
rule sterility of females. These patterns are best explained
by selective introgression at only some genomic regions
[54,55].
In Heliconius, very similar mimetic colour patterns appear
in related, non-sister species, even though closest relatives
usually differ in colour pattern [30,33,37]. For example,
apparently homologous "ray" mimicry patterns appear in
Amazonian melpomene, timareta, and elevatus, and also the
"radiosus" forms of H. pardalinus [41]. Possibly, the rayed
pattern is ancestral; but, if so, this would require red
forewing bands in extra-Amazonian melpomene, and in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/28

heurippa, tristero, and besckei to have repeatedly evolved in
parallel in the different lineages. Multiple parallel evolutionary events may be possible on the Heliconius genetic
background, but given that DNA introgression occurs, it
does not seem unlikely that the occasional hybridization
and backcrossing we document has led to transfer of alleles suitable for different mimetic environments. Under
this scenario, some of the diversity of mimicry rings
achieved by Heliconius lineages could be due to their ability to exchange fully formed colour pattern adaptations
between closely related species [73,74]; in Gilbert's metaphor, hybridization supplies Heliconius species with an
interspecific "shared toolkit" of mimicry genes [47]. In
addition, because colour pattern is often involved in mate
choice [38,39,75], hybridization can lead to new colour
pattern combinations which may promote hybrid speciation [76]. This scenario is particularly plausible in Heliconius heurippa [66].
An important practical consequence of introgression is
that conflicts between morphological or molecular characters in phylogenetic reconstruction may sometimes be
explained by gene transfer as well as by parallel evolution
and errors in phylogeny estimation. A "true" bifurcating
phylogeny of closely related species may not exist, except
as an artificial consensus of gene genealogies [54,77,78].
Available multi-locus studies now strongly suggest that
introgression selectively affects only certain parts of the
genome [54,55,79-82]. In Heliconius, the above prediction
that horizontal transfer of adaptive colour pattern genes
has occurred will become testable when genes affecting
colour pattern are characterized at the molecular level
[75,83].
Species continuous with infraspecific forms
Another important lesson from data on hybridization is
that species, or at least the entities to which the term "species" is normally applied, may not be completely reproductively isolated, and that speciation does not
completely close down gene flow. With time, reproductive
barriers will often become more complete, but they may
remain leaky in related species, and introgression, even
between non-sister taxa, may persist at low levels for many
millions of years after speciation. A strict interpretation of
the biological species concept might lump all species
between which hybrids are known, but this radical solution would require uniting virtually the entire melpomenecydno-silvaniform clade of Heliconius, many of the Geospiza
Darwin's finches, and many species and even genera of
ducks, game birds, birds of paradise, orchid genera,
among others. Furthermore, if gene flow is our criterion,
rather than hybridization, occasional gene flow via horizontal gene transfer is found across even larger systematic
divides, especially at the base of the tree of life where it
seems to have triggered important adaptive innovations

Page 10 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:28

[84]. Yet hybridizing taxa can usually coexist, diversify,
radiate and have distinguishable ecologies, sexual behaviour, and genetics, as we expect for species, in spite of this
occasional gene flow. Selective gene exchange of this kind
now seems likely to be relatively common whenever the
weak introgressive pressure expected between species is
more than balanced by sufficiently strong disruptive selection (although potentially quite weak in absolute terms)
keeping some parts of the genome distinct. This clearly is
the case in Heliconius: we know of no populations where a
pair of hybridizing species form a panmictic hybrid
swarm, even though introgression is seen regularly and
very likely contributes in important ways to adaptive evolution and speciation.
If the above argument from hybridization against a strict
reproductive isolation concept is accepted, it seems clear
also that most variants of the phylogenetic species concept
will also fail. Given the possibility of gene flow between
species taxa, the phylogeny will often be reticulate, even
with non-sister taxa, for some while after speciation. A
monophyly-based species concept will not do, nor will a
concept based on genealogical concordance at multiple
loci apply, at least strictly. Instead we are forced to accept
that the taxa we name are "unreal" phylogenetic units
whose species designations are merely useful because we
can tell the clusters of genotypes we call species apart
when they overlap, and because they predict distinct morphology, ecology, and behaviour [85]. Such species may
have no real species-level phylogeny (except an artificially
imposed consensus tree); instead the true reality is that
different parts of the genome may have truly different
genealogies.
Calling these taxonomic units species might seem unsatisfying to a purist. However, heliconiine species names such
as those of the taxa enumerated in Table 1 have been relatively stable since the biosystematic work of Emsley and
Brown in the 1960s and 1970s [29,86]. They are also concordant with mate choice, colour pattern, host plant
choice, and other ecological parameters known to differ
between the species that hybridize [62,63,87]. We have no
doubt that, in spite of their leaky boundaries and continuity with infraspecific categories, these heliconiine species
taxa and the names applied to them will continue to be
useful because the forms they circumscribe are identifiable and because they successfully predict divergent biological traits about which scientists wish to communicate.

Conclusion
Interspecific hybrids are regularly found among Heliconiina (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in the wild: overall,
26–29% of the species are involved, depending on species
concept. Hybrids are restricted to the two most recently
radiated "crown" genera, Heliconius and Eueides, where

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/28

they involve 33–35% and 42% of species, respectively.
These are among the highest recorded per species hybridization rates for any organism [18]. Based on a molecular
clock, reproductive isolation can often remain incomplete
for more than 3 million years after speciation. Hybridization is, however, rare on a per-individual basis. For one
well-studied case of species hybridizing in parapatric contact (Heliconius erato and H. himera), phenotypically
detectable hybrids form around 10% of the population,
but for most species in sympatry, hybrids usually form less
than 0.05% of individuals. In a few cases for which we
have detailed information, backcrossing occurs in the
field and fertile backcrosses have been verified in insectaries, which indicates that introgression is likely. Furthermore recent molecular work shows that alleles at some
but not all loci are shared between H. cydno and H. melpomene, a pair of sympatric, hybridizing species [54,55].
Hybridization between species of Heliconius appears to be
a natural phenomenon; there is no evidence that it has
been enhanced by recent human habitat disturbance.
There is a roughly exponential decline in the numbers of
natural hybrids with genetic distance both between and
within species, suggesting an approximation to a simple
"exponential failure law" of compatibility as found in
some prokaryotes. Geographic races and species that coexist in sympatry therefore form part of a continuum in
terms of hybridization rates or probability of gene flow.
Although not qualitatively distinct from geographic races,
nor "real" in terms of phylogeny or lack of hybridization,
species must by definition be identifiable via some loci
that are stably divergent in sympatry. Named heliconiine
species remain useful for predicting significant differences
in morphological, ecological, behavioural and genetic
characteristics, even though they regularly hybridize and
exchange genes. This finding concurs with the view that
processes leading to speciation are continuous, rather
than sudden, and that they are the same as those operating within species, rather than requiring special punctuated effects or complete allopatry. Furthermore, the
transfer of adaptive genes is possible, and may play an
important role in adaptation and speciation.

Methods
Detection and definition of "hybrids"
Data and photographs of specimens noted here from literature records, museums, and private collections were
collated into a database (Additional Files 1, 4). A few
other interspecific Heliconius hybrids may still exist in
smaller public and private collections not visited by us.
However, we believe our extensive international coverage
is adequate for the purpose of documenting the extent of
hybridization across the genus.

Closely related species of Heliconius usually belong to distinct mimicry rings [30,33,37], suggesting that a shift in
mimicry plays a role in speciation and the maintenance of
specific distinctness thereafter [35,37,38]. Therefore,
putative hybrids between such species are mostly easy to
identify. Having located potential hybrid specimens, we
use morphological criteria, coupled with knowledge of
intra- and interspecific Heliconius genetics [72,83,88-93]
to decide whether they constitute hybrids or intraspecific
variants. This is not always easy. Hybridization or introgression between species can cause difficulties in defining
the species themselves, let alone their hybrids and intergrades. We here define the term "hybrids" and "pure species" operationally via morphology, molecular genetic
data where available, and knowledge of the colour pattern
genetics: "pure species" are usually known from hundreds
of individuals, and, in heliconiines, their biology will usually be documented. Even if rare, a pure species is often
numerous in some areas, and only rarely is polymorphic
within any one area (exceptions to this rule exist: for
example H. numata and H. cydno exhibit local mimetic
polymorphisms [94-97]). "Hybrids" are highly unusual
phenotypes from well outside the normal range of variation of known species that are most easily interpreted as
progeny of crosses between two known species because of
a combination of traits from each. First generation (F1)
hybrids are readily distinguished providing the parent
species are sufficiently distinct in morphology. Colour
pattern differences often depend on relatively few loci:
this is the case for the geographic forms of Heliconius melpomene, H. erato, and H. numata [83,88,89,98] as well as
between H. erato and H. himera [37,45,90,92] and
between H. melpomene and H. cydno [47,72,98]. If there
are backcrosses, they and F2 progeny can potentially recreate the full range from parental phenotypes to F1-like
"obvious" hybrids [72]. Therefore, we use the designation
"F1" to mean that the phenotype could have been produced as a first generation cross (though it may sometimes actually have been produced by a backcross or F2),
and by "backcross" we mean all other hybrids that do not
have the F1 phenotype [46]. Since hybridization is usually
very rare for any pair of species, it is likely that almost all
"F1s" are actually first generation hybrids, and most "backcrosses" are offspring of actual F1s backcrossed to a parental species (although some backcrosses will be missed
among "F1s" and among "pure" specimens).
A number of interspecific hybridizations have now been
studied in insectaries, giving evidence useful both for
establishing the likelihood of hybridization, and to demonstrate the potential range of phenotypes. The detailed
series of crosses between H. erato and H. himera, and
between H. cydno and H. melpomene have been mentioned
above. Several other hybridizations have also occurred,
more or less accidentally, in insectaries. A major series

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/28

involves Heliconius ismenius, H. hecale, H. melpomene, H.
cydno and H. pachinus [37,47,99]. In another example,
Jean-Pierre Vesco (pers. comm.) obtained hybrids
between a male H. hecale from Costa Rica and a female H.
atthis from W. Ecuador. The F1 hybrid males were successfully backcrossed to females of both parents: H. atthis, H.
hecale, and also outcrossed to a third species, H. melpomene (which itself had some colour pattern elements
obtained by hybridization with H. cydno). Vesco reports
that many of the female hybrids were sterile, so the crosses
were obtained only via backcrosses with male hybrids
(Vesco's photos are obtainable via Additional File 1).
Speciation requires genetic divergence, but there is always
the possibility that alleles now common in one species
remain as low frequency ancestral polymorphisms in a
sister species. It is therefore hard to differentiate rare
ancestral polymorphism, potentially augmented by mutation, from polymorphisms introduced by introgression
(i.e. hybridization and back-crossing). We use two major
criteria to decide whether a specimen is a hybrid. First,
specimens showing two or more presumably independent
hybrid characteristics strongly implicate hybridization as
a cause. If rare ancestral alleles or mutation-derived phenocopies of genetic traits in another species are present in
the absence of hybridization, it is very unlikely that two or
more such traits will be found in the same individual provided that genetic loci coding for the variation are independent; for example, if each putatively hybrid trait has
frequency 0.1% (a generous estimate for the frequency of
the commonest hybrid phenotypes, for example the frequency of red forewing bands putatively from Heliconius
melpomene within Heliconius cydno – see Results and Discussion), two such traits should be found at a frequency
of one in a million, and three traits at a frequency of only
one in a billion. In true hybrids, on the other hand, hybrid
traits will normally be found together. In the cases were
hybrids are reasonably common and easy to produce
(within the Heliconius erato or H. melpomene groups, for
example), analysis of genetic architecture confirming such
independence of characteristics has been carried out in the
laboratory, and in some cases molecular studies have also
confirmed
the
existence
of
introgression
[46,54,55,72,73,88,90]. Normally, we identified hybrids
by means of comparisons of their external phenotype,
using laboratory crosses as a guide where these are available, but in some of the commonest cases of interspecific
hybridization we have molecular genetic evidence of
hybrids, as detailed in Table 1 and Additional File 2.
As well as the correlation of hybrid phenotypes within
individuals, we also use correlations between the location
of capture of hybrids and the geographic distributions of
putative parental species and races as supporting evidence
for hybrid status. For instance, the existence of red mel-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:28

pomene-like forewing bands in specimens otherwise similar to H. cydno might be due to ancestral polymorphism,
because the two species are sister taxa (Fig. 1). However, a
putative hybrid between Heliconius cydno and H. melpomene would be highly unlikely in Brazil or the Cauca
Valley of Colombia because only melpomene is present in
Brazil, and only cydno in the Cauca Valley. If on the other
hand, potential hybrid variants are due to hybridization,
such phenotypes should be present only in extra-Amazonian areas where both H. cydno and H. melpomene are
present and where the latter has a red forewing band (as
in fact they are). This geographic aid to hybrid identification is further enhanced because the species acting as parents of hybrids consist of as many as 30 very strongly
divergent geographic races distinguished by colour pattern.

inherited mitochondria is prevented at an earlier stage of
speciation than for nuclear loci [38,57,65,70]; the latter
may transferred between species by backcrossing of male
hybrids.

Authors' contributions
James Mallet conceived the idea, collated and analysed
most of the data, and wrote the majority of the text. Margarita Beltrán performed the majority of the molecular
work for the phylogenetic analysis of Fig. 1. Walter Neukirchen and Mauricio Linares helped to collate major
groups of hybrid specimens from world Museums, and
also from Linares' and especially Neukirchen's own collections, and made substantial contributions to writing the
paper.

Additional material
The potential for fraudulent hybrids manufactured in
captivity
A possible consequence of the interest that these rare natural hybrids now generate on the international butterfly
market is that there is a financial incentive to offer captivebred hybrid specimens for sale with fraudulent locality
labels. Bred hybrids seem most likely from the late 1980s
onwards, when "butterfly houses" and commercial breeding facilities in the tropics supplying livestock became
more widespread. The specimens tabulated and figured
here were largely collected before this time. We can be certain that the older specimens are genuine, since multiplegeneration Heliconius culture was unknown before the
1950s, and practised only by a handful of academic Heliconius biologists before the 1980s. Post-1980s specimens
could be more dubious, and we have used only specimens
whose provenances seem impeccable; we have visited key
sites in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Panama, and have personally communicated with some of their collectors
(León Denhez, Diego Torres, and Rodrigo Torres in the
Cali area, Ernesto Schmidt-Mumm and Jean François LeCrom in Bogotá, José Urbina in Otanche, and Adolfo Ibarra
in México).
Mitochondrial DNA divergence
DNA sequence information has been obtained for almost
all species of Heliconiina [30,31,100]. In this paper we
use data from 1569 bp of mitochondrial DNA of the genes
CoI, tRNA-leu, and CoII [30] to estimate genetic divergences. Mitochondrial sequences in Lepidoptera are a particularly useful standard for genetic divergence both
within and between species, for two reasons. Firstly, there
is thought to be no recombination between mitochondria, due to unisexual inheritance; thus genetic divergence
is unlikely to be affected by occasional introgression. Secondly, in Heliconius, as in many Lepidoptera [67], hybrid
females are often sterile, an example of Haldane's rule.
Haldane's rule will ensure that introgression of maternally
