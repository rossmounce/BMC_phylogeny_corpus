Abstract
Background: GPR17 is a G-protein-coupled receptor located at intermediate phylogenetic
position between two distinct receptor families: the P2Y and CysLT receptors for extracellular
nucleotides and cysteinyl-LTs, respectively. We previously showed that GPR17 can indeed respond
to both classes of endogenous ligands and to synthetic compounds active at the above receptor
families, thus representing the first fully characterized non-peptide "hybrid" GPCR. In a rat brain
focal ischemia model, the selective in vivo knock down of GPR17 by anti-sense technology or P2Y/
CysLT antagonists reduced progression of ischemic damage, thus highlighting GPR17 as a novel
therapeutic target for stroke. Elucidation of the structure of GPR17 and of ligand binding
mechanisms are the necessary steps to obtain selective and potent drugs for this new potential
target. On this basis, a 3-D molecular model of GPR17 embedded in a solvated phospholipid bilayer
and refined by molecular dynamics simulations has been the first aim of this study. To explore the
binding mode of the "purinergic" component of the receptor, the endogenous agonist UDP and two
P2Y receptor antagonists demonstrated to be active on GPR17 (MRS2179 and cangrelor) were
then modeled on the receptor.
Results: Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that GPR17 nucleotide binding pocket is similar
to that described for the other P2Y receptors, although only one of the three basic residues that
have been typically involved in ligand recognition is conserved (Arg255). The binding pocket is
enclosed between the helical bundle and covered at the top by EL2. Driving interactions are Hbonds and salt bridges between the 6.55 and 6.52 residues and the phosphate moieties of the
ligands. An "accessory" binding site in a region formed by the EL2, EL3 and the Nt was also found.
Conclusion: Nucleotide binding to GPR17 occurs on the same receptor regions identified for
already known P2Y receptors. Agonist/antagonist binding mode are similar, but not identical. An
accessory external binding site could guide small ligands to the deeper principal binding site in a
multi-step mechanism of activation. The nucleotide binding pocket appears to be unable to allocate
the leukotrienic type ligands in the same effective way.

Background
Adenine (ATP, ADP), uracil (UTP, uridine 5'-diphosphate,
UDP) and sugar nucleotides (e.g., UDP-glucose and UDPgalactose) are universal and phylogenetically-ancient signaling molecules involved in a multitude of biological
processes, from embryogenesis to adult homeostasis.
Actions of extracellular nucleotides on target cells are
mediated by specific membrane receptors: the ligandgated P2X channels, and the G protein-coupled P2Y receptors, which are widely distributed in human tissues [1].
P2Y receptors have recently attracted a lot of interest from
the scientific community, since they belong to the 7-transmembrane (TM) rhodopsin family of G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs), which are the target of more than 60%
of currently marketed drugs [2]. Besides the already characterized GPCRs, the recent publication of the human
genome has revealed the presence of more that 100
"orphan" GPCRs, i.e., receptors responding to yet-unidentified endogenous ligands. Due to the crucial roles of
GPCRs in human pathophysiology, their "deorphanization" is believed to unveil novel biological targets for drug
discovery. Of interest for the purinergic field, several
orphan GPCRs are closely structurally and phylogenetically related to the P2Y receptor family (see also below).
Eight distinct P2Y receptors are currently recognized: the
P2Y1,2,4,6,11,12,13,14 receptors [1]. The missing numbers in
the P2Y1–14 sequence represent GPCRs cloned from nonmammalian vertebrates or receptors for which a functional response to nucleotides has not yet been
convincingly demonstrated. Pharmacologically, P2Y
receptors can be subdivided into (1) adenine nucleotidepreferring receptors mainly responding to ADP and ATP.
This group includes human and rodent P2Y1, P2Y12, and
P2Y13, and human P2Y11; (2) uracil nucleotide-preferring
receptors. This group includes human P2Y4 and P2Y6
responding to either UTP or UDP; (3) receptors of mixed
selectivity (human and rodent P2Y2, rodent P2Y4 and,
possibly, P2Y11); and (4) receptors responding solely to
the sugar nucleotides UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose
(P2Y14) [1]. From a phylogenetic and structural (i.e., protein sequence) point of view, two distinct P2Y receptor
subgroups characterized by a relatively high level of
sequence divergence have been identified [1,3,4]. The first
subgroup includes P2Y1,2,4,6,11 subtypes and the second
subgroup encompasses the P2Y12,13,14 subtypes. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the cloned
P2Y receptors has shown that the human members of this
family are 21 to 48% identical. The highest degree of
sequence identity is found among the second subgroup of
P2Y12,13,14. Due to wide involvement in regulation of
physiological phenomena, dysfunctions of nucleotides
and their receptors have been associated to various

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/263

human diseases, including immune and ischemic/inflammatory conditions (ibidem).
Cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cysteinyl-LTs, such as LTC4, LTD4
and LTE4) are inflammatory lipid mediators generated by
5-lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid acting
through G protein-coupled CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors
and implicated in bronchial asthma, stroke and cardiovascular diseases [5].
Recent data highlight the existence of a functional crosstalk between the nucleotide and the cysteinyl-LT systems.
Both types of mediators accumulate at sites of inflammation, and inflammatory cells often co-express both P2Y
and CysLT receptors. In rat microglia, the brain immune
cells involved in response to cerebral hypoxia and trauma,
activation of P2Y1 and CysLT receptors mediates corelease of nucleotides and cysteinyl-LTs [6], which might,
in turn, contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In human monocyte/macrophage-like cells,
CysLT1 receptor function is regulated by extracellular
nucleotides via heterologous desensitization [7], and, in
the same cells, montelukast and pranlukast, two selective
CysLT1 receptor antagonists [5], functionally interact with
P2Y receptor signaling pathways [8]. Challenge of human
mast cells with pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-4
induced a yet-unidentified elusive receptor responsive to
both LTC4 and UDP [9]. Finally, there are close structural
and phylogenetic relationships between the P2Y and
CysLT receptor families. Both P2Y and CysLT receptors
cluster together into the "purine receptor cluster" of
GPCRs, which also includes a large number of "orphan"
receptors still awaiting identification [10]. Among these
receptors, Nonaka and co-workers identified GPR87 as
the closest receptor to the P2Y12,13,14 subgroup [11]. These
authors also identified four TM motifs which are fully
conserved in both GPR87, P2Y12,13,14, CysLT1 and CysLT2
receptors and are not found in other GPCRs [11]. Based
on these structural relatedness, they hypothesized that all
these receptors should respond to both nucleotides and
cysteinyl-LTs. However, while P2Y12 was found to be promiscuously activated by both nucleotides and CysLTE4
[11], GPR87 was subsequently reported to specifically
respond to lysophosphatidic acid and not to be activated
by either ATP, UDP or UDP-glucose [12]. This suggests
that the presence of specific structural motifs may be necessary but not sufficient to unequivocally define the pharmacological specificity of a given receptor.
Another member of the "purine receptor cluster"
(GPR17), seemed particularly attractive to us, since it is
located at intermediate phylogenetic position between
P2Y and CysLT receptors and is the closest receptor to a
common ancestor which also originated the P2Y12,13,14
and CysLT1 and CysLT2 (Figure 1).

GPCR responding to two unrelated families of non-peptide signalling molecules and represents a previously
unexplored therapeutic target for brain ischemia.

relationships between GPR17, P2Y and CysLT receptors.

On this basis, we have recently cloned and deorphanized
GPR17; we demonstrated that its heterologous expression
in a number of different cell lines results in the appearance of highly specific responses to both uracil nucleotides (e.g., UDP) and cysteinyl-LTs [13]. Agonists
response profile of GPR17, as determined in vitro by
[35S]GTPgammaS binding, was different from those of
already known CysLT and P2Y receptors, with EC50 values
in the nMolar and μMolar range, for cysteinyl-LTs and
uracil nucleotides, respectively.
Several established P2Y and CysLT antagonists, namely,
the P2Y1 selective antagonist 2'-deoxy-N6-methyladenosine 3',5'-biphosphate (MRS2179), the P2Y12/13 antagonist
N(6)-(2-methyl-thioethyl)-2-(3,3,3-trifluoropropylthio)beta, gamma-dichloromethylene-ATP (cangrelor), and
the CysLT1 antagonists montelukast and pranlukast were
found to be able to counteract GPR17 activation in vitro
[13]. Both human and rat GPR17 are highly expressed in
organs typically undergoing ischemic damage, i.e., brain,
heart and kidney. Based on this and on the demonstration
that both cysteinyl-LTs and nucleotides massively accumulate in ischemic brain [6,7] we also analyzed the role
of GPR17 in a model of focal brain ischemia in the rat. In
vivo inhibition of GPR17 achieved by either pharmacological agents able to counteract its in vitro activation (i.e.,
montelukast or cangrelor) or by the intracerebral injection
of an anti-sense oligonucleotide specifically designed to
knock down this receptor, dramatically reduced ischemic
damage, suggesting GPR17 as the common molecular target mediating brain damage by nucleotides and cysteinylLTs. Thus, GPR17 is the first fully characterized "hybrid"

The possibility of interfering with cerebral ischemia progression has obvious relevant implications for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches for
management of human stroke. Based on the data summarized above, it can be anticipated that selective GPR17
antagonists may represent a novel class of neuroprotective
agents able to counteract damage evolution [13]. Moreover, we anticipate that new chemical entities targeting
both components of this dualistic receptor may prove
extremely more effective than "standard" antagonists,
thus leading to the development of novel dualistic pharmacological agents with previously unexplored therapeutic potential. However, none of the pharmacological
agents utilized in the Ciana et al. study are really selective
for GPR17, since montelukast is also active at CysLT1
receptors [5] and, conversely, cangrelor also inhibits
P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptors [14,15]. On the other hand, the
design and synthesis of selective GPR17 antagonist ligands would greatly benefit from the knowledge of receptor three-dimensional (3-D) structure and from the
definition of its ligand binding mode. GPCRs are characterized by highly conserved structural topology, consisting of the seven TM helices bundle (TM1-7), the eighth
amphipathic helix (H8), an extracellular N-terminus
region (Nt), a cytoplasmic C-terminus tail (Ct) and three
extracellular (ELs) and intracellular (ILs) loops connecting helices [16,17].
These structural features are shared among protein
sequences that have very low similarity with the only 3-D
structure so far known, i.e. bovine Rhodopsin (bRh)
[18,19].
Nevertheless, bRh-based homology modeling combined
with dynamic simulations and experimental data have
been successfully used to investigate the ligand-receptor
features of several GPCRs: this procedure has been demonstrated to be useful for rational drug design [20,21].
Since 1995, many studies have focused on ligand binding
mode and on the design of selective nucleotide analogues
for other nucleotide receptors, starting from P2Y1 [22-24].
Site-directed mutagenesis has been applied to the elucidation of P2Y receptor structure and ligand binding modalities. Some positively charged residues in TM 3, 6, and 7
of the P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors have been shown to be crucial for receptor activation by nucleotides [25,26]. They
probably interact with the negative charges of the phosphate groups of nucleotides, since it is known that the
receptor ligands are nucleotidic species uncomplexed to
magnesium or calcium. Actually, the eight P2Y receptors
identified so far have a H-X-X-R/K motif in TM6. The

P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors share a Y-Q/
K-X-X-R motif in TM7, whereas another motif, K-E-X-X-L
is found in P2Y12, P2Y13, and P2Y14 receptors [1,4]. More
recently, for P2Y12, P2Y13, and P2Y14 receptors, one additional lysine residue in EL2 has been suggested to be particularly important for nucleotide binding [27]. It would
be interesting to assess if the same aminoacid residues
proposed to be important for nucleotide binding in P2Y
receptors are also involved in binding of GPR17 to purinergic ligands. The present work was specifically aimed at
modeling the 3-D structure of GPR17, with the goal of
designing new and selective ligands by defining the binding mode of its endogenous agonist UDP and of two
nucleotide-derived compounds, such as MRS2179 and
cangrelor, which have been reported to act as antagonists
at this receptor (see above and Ciana et al., 2006).

Results and Discussion
The structure of the receptor
As a first step to the rational design of selective GPR17 ligands, a homology model of human GPR17 (hGPR17) was
built using as a template the X-ray crystal structure of bRh
obtained at 2.20 Å resolution and deposited in the protein
data bank as 1U19 (see also Methods) [19]. The sequence
identity shared by hGPR17 and bRh is only 21% (data not
shown), that is the same order of magnitude shared by
bRh and other related nucleotide receptors for which
modeling has been successfully applied for a long time.
The sequence of GPR17 consists of 339 aminoacids, corresponding to the human receptor sequence in its shorter
isoform [GPCRDB: Q13304-2].

Multiple alignment of GPR17 with P2Y receptors, CysLT
receptors and bRh, reported in Additional file: Figure 1
[see Additional file 1], showed the existence of two conserved cysteines among the various sequences (Cys104
and Cys181 in GPR17) which are conserved in the great
majority of GPCRs. The corresponding cysteines in bRh
form a disulphide bridge; this structural feature was
assumed also for GPR17.
The receptor has an additional pair of cysteines which are
conserved in all the P2Y and CysLT receptors; these two
residues are positioned at the end of the Nt (Cys23) and
at the middle of the EL3 domain (Cys269), respectively
(see also below). Interestingly, these residues are not
present in bRh. It has been demonstrated by site-directed
mutagenesis and ligand affinity data that corresponding
cysteines in P2Y1 form a disulphide bridge which is
important for receptor activation [28]. Figure 2 shows a
detail of the multiple sequence alignment of GPR17, bRh,
all the P2Y and CysLT receptors highlighting the formation of a second putative disulphide bridge. In agreement
with our previous studies suggesting functional and phylogenetic relationships between GPR17, P2Y and CysLT
receptors [13], we included this additional disulphide
bridge into the 3-D model of GPR17.
The initial structure obtained from homology modeling
was topologically close to the template; polar hydrogens
were added and optimization of sidechains was run in
cycles in which the backbone was kept fixed.

The locally minimised structure has been then embedded
in a fully hydrated phospholipidic bilayer (dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-choline, DPPC, hydrated with water), as
described in Methods.

The stability of the molecular assembly was monitored by
following the total energy of the system and by the rmsd
of the C-α atoms trend as a function of time as shown in
the Additional file: Figure 2 and Additional file: Figure 3
[see Additional file 1].

The bRh X-ray file derived from the crystal asymmetric
unit reports 66 water molecules associated with both
chain A and chain B. These molecules are localized in the
vicinity of highly conserved residues and in the retinal
pocket, and they are probably involved in the regulation
of the activity of bRh-like GPCRs [29].

The final picture of the protein after 10 ns of MD is shown
in Figure 3 and in Additional file: Figure 4 [see Additional
file 1]. The global structure of the protein remained quite
similar to the initial one, although the structural domains
were unrestrained.

In addition to the water molecules considered as explicit
solvent, we have taken into account also all the solvent
molecules from the pdb file free from stereochemical hindrances.

As expected, the TM helical domains and the ELs and ILs
regions showed markedly different dynamics behaviour,
as reported in Figure 4, where the root mean square (rms)
fluctuations are reported versus the residue number.

The first part of the molecular dynamics simulation is a
simulated annealing (SA, see Methods for details concerning the warming-cooling cycles), in which the motion of
helices is restrained; the root-mean-square difference
(rmsd) for backbone atoms and sidechains between the
initial model and the final structure is 2.80 Å.

Among the loop regions, IL1, IL3 and EL1 were the most
rigid, whereas EL2 moved towards the TM bundle and displayed a new network of contacts. As expected, the Nt and
Ct regions were by far the most mobile regions. The
arrangement of α-helices underwent little changes during
the MD simulation, with the exception of TM7, which
showed a mobility higher than other TM domains, as
showed in Additional file: Figure 5 [see Additional file 1],
but its rmsd value was never higher than 1 Å.

Most of the water molecules that we included according to
the X-ray data actually diffused into the solvent layer, with
the exception of a few of them which remained inside the
transmembrane bundle for the entire simulation time.
These water molecules (labelled as Wat6808, Wat6809,
Wat6812, Wat6813, Wat6814, Wat6815, Wat6816,
Wat6817, Wat6822) were always close to the helical bundle due to the formation of favourable interactions with
sidechains of the protein.
At the end of SA cycles, the mobility of some structural elements of the protein were considerably high, as shown by
data in Table 1.
The structure of the protein-lipids-solvent system derived
from the SA simulation was used as input for 10 ns of
molecular dynamics (MD, NPT ensemble, T = 310 K, see
Methods).

To ensure that the mobility of TM7 was not due to a loss
of the α-helix structure but was indeed due to an intrinsic
property of the protein domain, results were compared
with those obtained with a "trial" run, performed by
applying selective harmonic restraints to the interhelical
H-bond distances of TM7 (see Methods for details). The
need to apply local restraints to the α-helix backbone, in
order to avoid a loss in secondary structure of TM7, has
been previously found in other rhodopsin-based homology models of GPCR [30,31]. This probably arises because
GPCR models are always obtained from the rhodopsin Xray structure, where TM7 is stabilized by retinal, its bound
ligand. However, in a recently published paper, Deflorian
and co-workers reported that in their MD simulations of
thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor models (THR-R1
and THR-R2), no restraints were required to preserve the
α-helical secondary structure of the TM segments [32].
Comparison between MD simulations, performed with
and without distance restraints, showed a mobility (rmsd
of C-α atoms) similar for both simulations: near to 1.5 Å
for the whole protein (Additional file: Figure 3) [see Additional file 1] and near to 1 Å for TM7 (Figure 5).
The number of the H-bonds observed during the MD simulations and the number of residues with α-helix geometry were comparable, as reported in Additional file: Figure
6 and Additional file: Figure 7, respectively [see Addi-

toyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline bilayer compared the
conformational dynamics of the TM peptide with those of
Alamethicin in either methanol or water. It was concluded
that in either the bilayer or in methanol, there was little
change from the initial helical conformation of the peptide C-α rmsd, while in water there were substantial
changes of rmsd accompanied by a loss in α-helix structure for some regions [33]. For further information about
the mobility and topology of GPR17, see Additional file
Figure: 3, Additional file: Figure 4 and Additional file: Figure 5 [see Additional file 1].
The architecture of the helical bundle and the organization of the most interesting helices is described in the following subchapter.

tional file 1]. This suggests that the observed mobility of
TM7 does not impair either the α-helix topology or the
global packing of the helical bundle. On this basis, and
due to the proved stability of the trajectory, the subsequent runs were performed without the use of any "artificial" constraints but simply employing an explicit
membrane environment closer to native conditions. Earlier studies have indeed shown that the mobility of α-helices embedded in membrane models is lower than the
mobility of α-helices in water or methanol. For example,

values of rmsd as a function of time obtained in two different
simulation protocols, i.e., with NOE distance restraints
(Condition 1, 6 ns, in black) or without NOE distance
restraints (Condition 2, 10 ns, in red).

Interhelical interactions
The main intermolecular contacts formed during the MD
run and likely contributing to receptor function are
described in detail in Table 2 and compared with those
assumed to be relevant for the "parent" receptor bRh and
for related purinergic receptors [27,30,23,34,35] (Table
3). For Table 3, the Ballesteros and Weinsten numbering
system has been adopted [36]. For time evolution plots,
see Additional file: Figure 8 and Additional file: Figure 9
[see Additional file 1]. We report below some of the most
interesting observations emerged from this analysis.

The spanning of TM3 across the helical bundle seemed to
divide the receptor in two well distinct regions characterized by different features. A first hydrophilic region
encompassing TM1, TM2 and TM7 contained all the water
molecules derived from crystallized bRh. As in bRh, starting from Arg87 and proceeding along the whole length of
the protein, multiple hydrogen/ionic interactions
between TM1, TM2, TM3 and TM7 stabilized the helix
pack. Arg87, Asp41, Ser287, Asn289, Asp293, Asn114,
Asp77, Asn49, Ser118, Tyr297, Lys303, Glu330, Asn67,
Lys327 and five water molecules (Wat6817, Wat6815,
Wat6816, Wat6809 and Wat6812) contributed to the formation of the internal polar network (Table 2). In addition, Ser118 could also interact with either Wat6814 or
Wat6816, thus participating to the continuous H-bond
network described above (Table 3). This residue (position
3.39) is conserved as a OH-bearing aminoacid in many
GPCRs, including P2Y and CysLT receptors. In bRh, this
position is occupied by alanine and the OH group is provided by a water molecule involved, together with a
sodium ion, in receptor activation [29] (Table 3). A second hydrophobic region, where aromatic residues are predominant, encompassed TM4, TM5 and TM6. Here, the
aromatic residues Tyr112, Tyr116, Tyr120, Tyr251,
Phe203, Phe203 and the highly conserved sub-pocket
formed by Phe201 (5.47), Phe244 (6.44) and Phe248
(6.48) constituted an aromatic cluster between TM3, TM5

(Tyr112, Tyr116 and Tyr120) faced the hydrophobic cavity delimited by TM5 and TM6. The first two residues are
conserved in most P2Y and CysLT receptors, but not in
bRh, and they are probably involved in stabilization of the
interhelical interactions, as suggested by our dynamics
simulation.
The outmost part of TM3 seemed to be permanently
engaged in a conserved disulphide bridge with EL2
involving the Cys104 and Cys181 residues, which is an
essential structural constraint for most GPCRs, as already
mentioned above [18] (Table 3). This disulphide bridge
constrained the whole structural organization of the protein. The bending of EL2 caused the formation of a plug
that shields the extracellular side of the protein from the
transmembrane space. In bRh, as in many other GPCRs,
this plug seems to prevent the outing of embedded ligands. In P2Y1, the role of this disulphide bridge has been
further investigated through mutagenesis data confirming
its importance for receptor trafficking to the membrane
[28].

Within TM3, a ionic binding is likely to occur between
Asp128 and Arg129. These two charged aminoacids are
positioned at the intracellular end of TM3, and belong to
the highly conserved D(E)-R-Y(W) motif (Table 3). In
bRh, the corresponding salt bridge (Glu134-Arg135),
together with the interaction between Arg135 (3.50) and
Glu247 (6.30) is believed to keep the receptor in its inactive state [37]. Alignment of GPR17 with bRh, did not
reveal any corresponding acidic residue in the TM6 of
GPR17. In analogy with P2Y and CysLT receptors, at position 3.50, GPR17 displays a basic residue instead of an
acidic one (Table 3). However, we observed that, during
the simulations, Arg129 can form a stable ionic binding
with the Glu330 belonging to the Ct of the protein.
As in bRh, in GPR17, a hydrophobic pocket formed by
Ala233 and Met236 accommodates the Asp128-Arg129
ionic couple (indicated as D128-R129 in Table 3) of the
D-R-Y motif [38].
An additional H-bond between Arg3.50 and a generic Hbond acceptor at position 6.34 have been proposed for all
members of the P2Y12-like subfamily [27]. In GPR17, as

move away from TM3 thereby starting the activation process [40].

TM6 contains the H-X-X-R/K motif typical of all P2Y
receptors and conserved among few related receptors,
including CysLT receptors (Table 3). Experimental data
demonstrates that, in P2Y1, both histidine (His277) and
lysine (Lys280) are essential for ligand recognition and/or
receptor activation [3,25]. In particular, Lys280 (6.55)
coordinates the phosphate moiety of nucleotide ligands,
while His277 (6.52) is probably implicated in agonistmediated receptor activation [26,31,39]. In our GPR17
model, these two crucial residues are His252 and Arg255.
The first engaged polar contacts with residues from EL2;
the second is the best candidate residue for nucleotide
binding. Experimental data from mutagenesis studies will
help confirming this hypothesis.

Intracellular regions
The abundance of hydrophilic and charged residues of the
intracellular domains results in the formation of a complex weave of polar interactions: this is not discussed in
detail here, due to its minor relevance to the purpose of
the present study.

Our MD simulation also showed that TM6 engaged only
few interactions with other helices (the same was
observed for TM4, that is characterized by a high content
in hydrophobic residues). However, as outlined above,
TM6 contains the putative critical motifs for binding, suggesting that this helix may maintain a dynamic behaviour
needed to evoke receptor activation without constraints
from the other helices. In fact, in bRh, TM6 is believed to

Extracellular regions
Despite the length and the flexibility of the Nt, we
observed a pronounced structural stabilization after an
initial significant conformational change. This resulted in
the formation of a typical β-hairpin running nearly parallel to the horizontal plane of the membrane. This secondary structure faced a second beta strand present in EL2, but
oriented in the opposite direction, forming a plug that is
commonly believed to be critical for receptor activation
mechanism [41]. The relative position of these two β-hairpins was strongly influenced by the presence of the disulphide bridge. Despite the relatively low sequence identity
between bRh and GPR17, this typical organization of the
EL2 and Nt regions appeared to be conserved.

As for the helical domains, we report below some of the
intramolecular interactions observed in the extracellular
part of the protein during our MD simulation.
Residues from Gly10 to Leu17 in Nt and from Val173 to
Leu182 in EL2 were involved in the formation of two
slightly distorted β-hairpins. The sidechain of Gln174 in
EL2 pointed toward the Nt, forming a H-bond with the
backbone of Leu11 in Nt, and directly connecting the two
β-strands. Furthermore, the backbone of Gln174 and
Asn176 were in H-bond contact with Gln22 in the first βhairpin.
Glu21 in Nt was bound to Asn31 and Asn95 belonging to
TM1 and TM2, respectively. Thr13 in Nt was bound to
Ser196 and Arg105 of TM3, which, in turn, interacted
with the peptide carbonyl of several residues located close
to the extracellular end of TM4. Asn14 and Ser16 of the βhairpin were bound to Ser196 and Glu103, respectively.
Gln183 pointed towards the interhelical space and
appeared to be involved in a H-bond network running all
along the helical bundle.
All the interactions reported above, together with other
intra-chains interactions, form a compact, highly structured, extracellular plug encompassing both EL2, EL3 and
Nt. This region is believed to restrain conformational
changes for the resting state and control binding mechanisms during receptor activation.
All these structural evidences suggest that, in GPR17, the
region formed by the EL2, EL3 and the Nt would play a
critical role in receptor activation and ligand recognition,
at least as an "accessory" pocket, favouring the access of
small ligands to the deeper principal binding site (see
below), in a multi-step mechanism of activation. In this
context, EL1 appears to play a minor role because of its
limited length and predominant hydrophobic nature.
Involvement of extracellular domains in nucleotide recognition has been suggested for the first time by Moro and
co-workers for P2Y1. These authors proposed the existence
of two meta-binding sites and a path of access of the ligand to the principal intracellular binding sites [42]. Furthermore, in P2Y1, some charged residues believed to be
critical for receptor function in EL2 and EL3 have been
successfully probed throughout mutagenesis combined
with ligand affinity measurements [26,27,34]. These
experiments confirmed the above hypothesis and, at the
same time, support our finding and conclusions.
Definition of the binding site
A general configuration of the binding sites for all known
P2Y receptors was proposed based on docking and mutagenesis studies [27,35]. It is commonly assumed that, in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/263

these receptors, the phosphate moiety of nucleotide ligands can be accommodated in a positively charged pocket
formed by three residues. It has been also proposed that
the nucleotide binding mode is specific and slightly different between the two subgroups of the family. For
P2Y1,2,4,6,11, residues surrounding the phosphate chain
are all located in transmembrane domains and correspond to 3.29, 7.39 and 6.55. In the case of P2Y12,13,14,
two of these three residues (6.55 and 7.35) belong to TM6
and TM7, respectively; the third one is a lysine which is
located in EL2, in the vicinity of the conserved cysteine
[27]. At variance from this model, binding of UDP-glucose to P2Y14 has been recently reported to be quite different from that of UDP to P2Y6 [31]. Indeed, two basic
sidechains found essential for the agonist binding site in
P2Y6 and all previously known P2Y receptors were not
involved in P2Y14 and are absent in the GPR17 sequence.
Multiple alignment with P2Y family members shows that
GPR17 possesses only one of these three basic residues, in
particular, residue 6.55 corresponding to Arg255 and
belonging to the H-X-X-R motif typical of all P2Y receptors. Residues 3.29 and 7.39 correspond to Gly108 and
Ser283, respectively; the first residue cannot display
sidechain interactions, but is able to enhance the flexibility of the chain. The role of the EL2 has been also investigated in several P2Y receptors. The lysine which is present
in the EL2 in P2Y12,13,14 is not conserved in GPR17, but,
interestingly, is conserved in CysLT1.
It has been also proposed that an acidic residue, located
two positions ahead of the conserved cysteine, would play
an important role in ligand recognition. This critical residue is aspartic acid in P2Y1,2,4 and corresponds to Glu174
in P2Y14, a receptor where an additional glutamic acid on
EL2 (Glu166) seems to participate to the stabilization of
the ligand-receptor complex.
GPR17 lacks the charged residues close to this conserved
cysteine: the nearest ones (Arg186 and Glu187) are
shifted toward the Ct end of EL2 in the direction of TM5.
Interestingly, glutamic acid in EL2 is conserved as it is in
CysLT receptors.
Due to the relatively low identity between GPR17 and
related receptors sharing both endogenous and synthetic
ligands, sequence analysis does not provide an exact definition of ligand binding mode, despite the increasing
knowledge on the arrangement of nucleotides in ligandreceptor complexes of P2Y receptors. The characterization
of the binding site of cysteinyl-LTs are even more ill
defined.
Mutagenesis studies on P2Y1 receptor suggest that residues
3.29 and Asp204 (EL2) are involved in the receptor acti-

vation caused by ligand binding [26,28]. The role of this
pair of charged aminoacids has been postulated also for
P2Y6, where residue 3.29 is involved in an ionic interaction with Glu179 (in EL2) and this is crucial for the retention of receptor ground state conformation. The
phosphate interaction with the sidechain of Arg103 is
supposed to destabilize the ion pair Arg103-Glu179 and
this mechanism could take part in receptor activation
[30].
Our GPR17 model indicates a different and specific distribution of charged residues in the area corresponding to
the nucleotide binding pocket of P2Y receptors suggesting
that ligand-mediated activation may be different from
that described for P2Y6 (see also below). In GPR17, ligand
recognition (and receptor activation) is not mediated by
the interplay of a ionic couple stabilizing the reciprocal
EL2 and TM3 positions. The positively charged residue
nearest to 3.29 in TM3 of GPR17 is Arg105, which is conserved as a positively charged residue also in all P2Y receptors, except for P2Y12. In our model, Arg105 was likely to
form stable interactions with Tyr13, Tyr172 and Ser196
sidechains.
Conversely, in GPR17, the putative negatively charged
counterpart of the 3.29 residue corresponds to Gln183,
which was likely to form persistent H-bonds with Tyr116,
Ser196 and His192.
As a conclusion, detailed architecture of interactions
between TM3, TM5, TM6 and EL2 showed that, in GPR17,
a different and specific distribution of residues could stabilize the position of EL2 over TM domains, thus suggesting a slightly different mechanism of receptor activation
(see also below).
The bound agonist and antagonist ligands
The overall picture of the agonist-receptor complex was
obtained by means of MD runs of 3 ns starting from the
best-docked configuration of one of the natural ligands of
GPR17, i.e. UDP.

In the 3-D arrangement of 7TM receptors, the binding
pocket that Delos [43] (see Methods for more details)
spotted as the most probable one which best accommodates the agonist ligand corresponded to the already well
documented "nucleotide binding site" [35]; as expected
on the basis of the poor conservation of sequences, the
interatomic connections were different.
The putative arrangement of the UDP molecule is displayed in Figure 6. A multitude of possible interactions
held the diphosphate moiety in place. The guanidine
group of Arg255 (6.55) seemed to form an ionic bond
with both the α and β-phosphates, with a shorter distance

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/263

to the α-phosphate. Furthermore, the β-phosphate
seemed to form a network of H-bonds with the hydroxyl
groups of Tyr185 (EL2), Tyr112 (TM3) and Tyr262 (EL3)
and to interact with the sidechain (N1) of His252 (TM6).
Gln183 (EL2) was bound to both the α-phosphate and βphosphates: as a consequence, Gln183 did not seem to
coordinate the three tyrosines as in the unbound receptor.
In addition to the directly bound Gln183, another residue
belonging to EL2, namely Gln171, pointed toward the
intracellular space and kept its sidechain close to the
phosphate chain in the pocket. Sidechains of His192
(TM5), Tyr116 (TM3), Ser196 (TM5), Tyr251 (TM6) were
also within the binding pocket. The most important interaction of the agonist phosphates seemed to occur with
Arg255; however, interaction with His252 (whose total
charge was in our case assumed to zero) could be as
important.
On the opposite side of the helical bundle, the uridine
ring was coordinated by residues from TM7 and TM1.
Namely, the 4-O of uracil was likely to interact with the
hydroxyl groups of Ser283 (TM7) and Tyr38 (TM1),
whereas its 3-NH group seemed to interact with Ser287
(TM7). These polar interactions were the only ones
present in the aromatic subsite hosting the uridine ring.
Mostly hydrophobic contacts were instead observed
within the pocket: these involved Tyr251, Phe111,
Phe248, Tyr112. An additional intramolecular H-bond
was formed between Asn176 in EL2 and Ser283 in TM7,
involving the OH group of serine and NH2 group of asparagine.
Although holding some peculiar features, the overall configuration of the agonist ligand agreed with the general
configuration predicted in previous computational papers
for P2Y receptors, including the P2Y6 receptor that shares
the common agonist UDP with GPR17 [30]. Analogies
concern the involvement of the conserved residues Ser283
(7.43), Tyr38 (1.39) and Phe111 (3.32) in the coordination of the nucleobase and the electrostatic interaction
between the conserved Arg255 (6.55) and the phosphate
moiety. Ser7.43 was also involved in the binding of the
uracil group of UTP in P2Y2 and P2Y4, in the binding of
the adenine group of MRS2179 (see also below), and, in
general, of the nucleobase in P2Y receptors. The same residue has also been described as essential for the activation
of P2Y1 [35].
In our model, the sugar moiety of UDP established only a
few specific interactions with 7TM regions. The most
important interaction engaged by the ribose involved the
2'-OH group of the sugar, that, during the MD simulation,
shifted from Asn114 (3.55) to Thr286 (7.42); conversely,
the 3'-OH pointed to TM6, but was not directly involved

in any specific H-bond. In the most representative UDP
structures of the whole MD simulation, the ribose clustered in a Southern (S) conformation, while the starting
configuration was Northern (N). The shift from (N) to (S)
conformation seemed to proceed in parallel to the shift of
the 2'-OH group of the agonist ligand from TM3 to TM7.
This allowed the ribose to assume the conformation
required to hold the phosphate and the uracil groups in
the proper position for a stable receptor binding.
Although, for GPR17, further experimental investigations
are necessary to confirm this issue, similar data were
reported for the ribose group of UDP-glucose in binding
to P2Y14. For this receptor, the 2'-OH group was bound to
Asn3.35 in the (N) ribose conformation or to Asn7.45
and Ser7.42 in the (S) conformation, while the 3'-OH
group never interacted with the receptor [31]. In the case
of P2Y1,2,4,11 receptors, the (N) conformation of the
pseudo-rotational cycle of the sugar enhanced the binding
of adenine and uracil agonists [44]. In the case of P2Y6,
the ribose group of UDP established specific interactions
with the TM residues and this was related to the stabilization of the final active (S) conformation of the ribose. This

unique profile of UDP binding in P2Y6 differs from the
typical (N) conformation of uracil (and adenine) nucleotides in other P2Y receptors.
We then modeled two adenine nucleotide P2Y receptor
antagonists that have been previously shown to interact
with GPR17 [13]: MRS2179 and cangrelor.
The ribose-modified nucleotide analogue MRS2179, a
selective P2Y1 receptor antagonist, binds to the same binding pocket of endogenous ligands on this receptor. In
analogy with P2Y1, our docking experiments suggested
that MRS2179 and UDP occupy a common region also on
GPR17. The final picture of the bound antagonist is
reported in Figure 7. The phosphate moiety was anchored
to the same Arg255 residue that bounded to UDP by electrostatic interaction, but in a middle position between the
two phosphate chains, as previously described for binding
of MRS2179 to P2Y1 [35]. In addition, both the 3' and 5'
phosphate chains were stabilized via H-bonds with many
other residues in the binding pocket. The 3'-phosphate
group formed a H-bond with the sidechain (N1) of

Page 12 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:263

His252 (TM6); the OH group of Tyr116 (TM3) interacted
with the same oxygen atom of the 3'-phosphate group.
The NH2 group of Gln183 (EL2) was H-bounded to the 3'phosphate of MRS2179. The 5'-phosphate group was
bound to the OH groups of Tyr185 (EL2), Thr175 (EL2)
and Tyr251 (TM6). It is noticeable that, in the case of the
antagonist, two solvent molecules (Wat6789 and
Wat6808) were bridging the interaction of the phosphate
groups with Asn279 (TM7) and Tyr262 (EL3), respectively. The adenine group of MRS2179 is likely to offer
several nitrogen acceptor atoms to residues able to form
H-bonds: in our model, the N7 was connected to Arg87
(TM2), the N6 interacted with Ser7.43 (TM7), the N1
interacted with Asn114 (TM3) and, finally, the N3 interacted with the backbone of Phe111. Here again, the
hydrophobic residues Phe111 and Phe248 accommodated the nucleobase.
Cangrelor (previously known as ARC-69931MX [1]) is a
potential anti-thrombotic agent due to its ability to counteract ADP-induced activation of platelet P2Y12 receptors
responsible for platelet aggregation. Cangrelor is also a
potent antagonist at the P2Y13 receptor subtype [15] and,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/263

as recently reported by us, at human and rodent GPR17
[1]. Its ability to potently prevent the progression of
ischemic injury in a rat model of focal brain ischemia [13]
also highlights this compound as a potential anti-stroke
agent. Since no data on the binding mode of this antagonist at either P2Y12 or P2Y13 receptors are available, we
decided to investigate its interaction with GPR17 by
means of MD simulations. The configuration of the
GPR17-cangrelor complex docked in the nucleotide binding pocket after 6 ns of MD is shown in Figure 8.
As in the case of UDP and MRS2179, a main driving interaction involved the phosphate groups (in particular the αphosphate) and the basic Arg255 residue. Cangrelor
accommodated the triphosphate chain between helices
TM3, TM5, TM6 and TM7 and pointed to the extracellular
space extending towards the EL2 residues. Due to the
length of the phosphate containing chain, cangrelor conformation was more influenced by residues in extracellular loops with respect to smaller ligands, such as MRS2179
and UDP. An additional basic residue (Arg186) from EL2
was bound to the phosphate chain. Furthermore, four
polar residues from EL2 (Asn176 and Thr175) and TM7

(Asn279, Thr282) directed their sidechains towards the
transmembrane region and contributed to the stabilization of the complex by forming H-bonds with the phosphate chain.
Due to the anchoring of its phosphate groups from the
extracellular side, cangrelor adenine moiety occupied a
region between TM3 and TM7, but its orientation in the
pocket differed from that of MRS2179. The amino group
pointed towards the extracellular side as a result, which
has never been proposed for adenine nucleotides docked
at the P2Y receptors (see also below). In detail, the pyrimidinic ring faced TM1, TM2 and TM7, allowing the N1
and N6 nitrogen atoms of the ring to form H-bond interactions with Tyr38 and Arg87, while the imidazole portion of the molecule was directed towards TM3, TM5 and
TM6 and was H-bound to the Gln183 sidechain of EL2.
The adenine ring substituents, i.e., the 3,3,3-trifluoropropylsulfanyl and the 2-methylsulfanylethylamino chains
elongated to a deeper region within the helical bundle
and the extracellular side of the protein, respectively, thus
extending to a receptor region which is inaccessible to
small nucleotides such as UDP and MRS2179. Finally, the
ribose moiety was positioned between TM3, TM5, and
TM6, was surrounded by Tyr112 (TM3), Tyr116 (TM3),
His252 (TM6), Arg255 (TM6), Gln183 (EL2) and

(Tyr185) and formed several H-bond interactions with
their sidechains.
Our model also revealed some important differences in
the interaction of GPR17 with ligands' adenine moiety.
According to previous modeling studies on P2Y1 [27,35],
basic residues in 3.29, 7.39 and 6.55 coordinated the
phosphates of adenine ligands such as MRS2179 and
related compounds. Moreover, residue 7.36 was H-bound
to N6 and N7, whereas residue 7.43 was H-bound to N1.
Finally, highly conserved residues in 1.39 and 2.53 contributed to the stabilization of the adenine ring. In the
case of GPR17, the 7.36 residue is an arginine, which
seemed involved in a persistent ionic interaction with a
glutamic acid in 1.31, an acidic residue which is not
present in any other P2Y receptors. This pair is likely to
form a bridge between TM7 and TM1 close to the binding
cavity, thus stabilizing the helical bundle. In GPR17,
another basic residue in 2.60 (Arg87) replaces the 7.36
residue facing the binding pocket which is present in the
other P2Y receptors. Arg87 formed a H-bond with the adenine N6 of both ligands and also acted as a H-bond donor
for adenine N7 of MRS2179. Interestingly, in the absence
of ligands, Arg87 formed a salt bridge with Asp41. This
pair belonged to the hydrophilic network between TM1,
TM2, TM3 and TM7, suggesting that, in GPR17, the Arg87

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:263

residue could play a significant role in ligand-mediated
activation mechanism. Also in the case of GPR17, for both
MRS2179 and cangrelor, our data highlighted a particularly important role for residue 6.55 in phosphate coordination. For time evolution plots of the main interactions
observed between GPR17 and docked ligands during MD
see Additional file: Figure 10, Additional file: Figure 11
and Additional file: Figure 12 [see Additional file 1].
The network of H-bonds between GPR17 polar residues of
TM1, TM2, TM3, TM7 and water remained stable throughout the MD simulation.
Overall, the main functional regions for receptor binding
in UDP, MRS2179 and cangrelor overlapped: atoms N1 in
uridine and N9 in adenine were superimposed. The 3'phosphate group of MRS2179 and the α-phosphate group
of UDP and cangrelor overlapped, while the ribose
approximately occupied the same spatial regions at the
centre of the helical bundle. In summary, for the natural
ligand UDP, the uracil ring pointed toward TM1 and TM2,
while also binding to TM7, TM3 and TM1. The diphosphate moiety was bound to TM3 and TM6 and pointed
toward TM5, TM6 and EL2. For MRS2179, the adenine
ring was bound to TM7 and TM3 and pointed toward helices TM1 and TM2. The phosphate moiety was bound to
TM3, TM7, TM6 and EL2, with the 5'-phosphate pointing
towards EL2 and the 3'-phosphate pointing towards TM5
and TM6. Finally, also for cangrelor, the adenine ring was
positioned between TM3 and TM7, while the phosphate
chain was comprised between TM3, TM5, TM6 and
extended towards EL2.

Conclusion
The dynamic simulations of a natural purinergic ligand
and of two strong purinergic antagonists suggest that the
agonist/antagonist binding modes to the new nucleotide
receptor GPR17 are comparable, and that the topology of
the binding site is the same. The agonistic or antagonistic
nature of the different ligands cannot be determined from
the analysis of the binding mode, since the binding site
itself appears to be shared by both nucleotide agonists
and antagonists. The binding region corresponds to the
well described nucleotide binding site of the other P2Y
receptors, at least for some crucial interactions (e.g., with
residue 6.55). Some important differences were, however,
noticed, since only one of the three basic residues that are
typically present in the binding pocket of P2Y receptors is
conserved in GPR17. Thus, the so called "nucleotide binding site" is not defining a single binding mode and surely
not a unique configuration of nucleotides bound to it.
Recent developments show heterogeneity in the modalities of nucleotide binding also among the already known
members of the P2Y receptor family [31]. For example, for
P2Y14, it has been suggested that two of the basic residues

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/263

(6.55 and 7.35) that have been previously involved in
binding to nucleotide phosphates, are instead bound to
the hexose moiety of sugar-nucleotides. Moreover, initial
docking and MD experiments suggest that, in a similar
way to P2Y1 [42], there may be an additional "accessory"
binding site also on GPR17, in a region located at the
interface between the extracellular environment and the
helical bundle. Here, some key aminoacids in EL3 and in
Nt could drive the efficacy with which small ligands are
guided into the helical bundle, and could consequently
affect receptor response. Interestingly, in our previous
[35S]GTPgammaS binding studies, we noticed a marked
species difference in the potency of some purinergic agonists and antagonists between the rat and human receptor
[13]. At present, we have no obvious explanation to
explain this difference. However, despite the absence of
marked sequence changes between the two receptors,
there are indeed qualitatively important differences in single aminoacid residues belonging to the EL3 and Nt, in
the receptor region highlighted above. Future mutagenesis
studies guided by these species differences will help clarifying the relative importance of this receptor region in
both ligand binding and receptor activation.
GPR17 has been also reported to bind to cysteinyl-LTs
[13]. Our model suggests that neither the dimensions nor
the dynamics of the receptor with or without ligands will
accommodate the leukotrienic ligands in the nucleotide
binding site. Therefore, a first clear hint coming out from
this work is that this dual receptor most probably has a
dual binding mechanism, according to the chemical
entity that is going to bind. Based on our modeling, we
hypothesise that leukotrienic ligands may extend well
beyond the nucleotide binding pocket, therefore also
involving the extracellular loops. This conclusion is consistent with our previous experimental data with
[35S]GTPgammaS binding [13]. In 1321N1 cells heterologously expressing hGPR17, blockade of the cysteinyl-LT
binding site with the CysLT antagonists montelukast or
pranlukast did not abolish the response to uracil derivatives. In a similar way, blockade of the nucleotide binding
site with either cangrelor or MRS2179 still permitted the
response to LTD4. Moreover, incubation with both LTD4
and uracil derivatives, utilized at concentrations corresponding to their EC50 values, resulted in an augmented
response with respect to responses induced by each agonist alone [13]. Globally, these data suggest that two distinct binding sites, or at least two binding modes (one for
nucleotides and the other one for cysteinyl-LTs), are
present on GPR17. We envisage that the elucidation of
this second binding site for cysteinyl-LTs in GPR17 will
help designing novel "hybrid" dual antagonists of previously unexplored therapeutic potential. This could be
achieved by the rational design of a dual ligand carrying
structural elements from two distinct classes of ligands.

This approach would also meet the requirements of the
current lead-discovery strategy that aims at the development of compounds that can simultaneously target different biological pathways. This approach can be
advantageous in the case of complex mechanisms of
action for which the blockade of a single mechanism fails
to sort the desired effect [45].

Methods
Homology modeling
The aminoacidic sequences of bRh, hGPR17 and pharmacologically related P2Y and CysLT receptors were obtained
from Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL database at the ExPaSy server
[46]. Multiple sequences alignment was performed using
the on-line available Clustal W program accessible
through the European Bioinformatic Institute [47,48]. For
the homology modelling, we selected the sequence of the
shortest isoform of hGPR17 [GPCRDB: Q13304-2], that is
339 aminoacid-long and lacks the starting Nt 28 residues
that are present in the full-length isoform. We chose not
to take into account the initial portion of the Nt domain
since all the experimental data that are available on
GPR17 have been obtained with the pharmacologically
active shortest isoform of hGPR17 [13]. Moreover, the
packing of the receptor was not influenced by this dope.
In addition, there are evidences that, in all GPCRs, the Nt
domain includes several glycosylation sites, thus making
the results of the 3-D modeling even more speculative.
The alignment between hGPR17 and bRh sequences to the
NEST [49] module of the Jackal package 1.5 was imported
to obtain an initial approximate 3-D structure of GPR17.
The model was built using the X-ray crystallographic coordinates of the bRh structure at 2.2 Å [19], deposited at the
RCSB Protein Data Bank [50], as a template [PDB: 1U19].
The crude initial model was topologically close to the
template. However, since, with respect to bRh, GPR17 has
an additional pair of cysteines which is conserved in all
P2Y and CysLT receptors, the existence of an additional
extracellular disulphide bridge was assumed, and this presumptive bridge was added via computer graphics, by
linking the two conserved Cys23 and Cys269 residues in
the Nt and EL3, respectively.
Molecular dynamics simulations
The 3-D molecule was locally minimized in vacuo by constraining the backbone of the helices in order to give a first
optimization of the rough geometry derived from homology modeling.

The model of DPPC in the liquid-crystalline phase proposed by Tieleman and Berendsen [51,52] was then used
to reproduce the membrane environment. The system
consisting of 128 lipids and 3655 water molecules, available on-line and completed with its relative simulation
parameters [53], was used as the initial configuration.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/263

The structure of hGPR17 was manually inserted in the
centre of the 128 lipid bilayer, in such a way that the principal axes of the helical bundle was parallel to the membrane axis (z) and perpendicular to the membrane plane
(xy), and the extracellular and intracellular loops were at
the lipid interface. Twenty eight lipid molecules overlapping with the receptor were removed and the system was
solvated with the spc216 water model [54] provided in
the Gromacs package [55,56].
Additional solvent molecules were included into the system at the water positions reported in the interior of the
1U19 crystallographic structure of bRh. Our receptor
model was first superimposed to both chain A and chain
B, including the already observed 66 water positions; the
36 non-overlapping internal water molecules were kept in
their position.
The resulting system consisted of 339 aminoacid residues,
100 DPPC molecules, 6384 water molecules (6348 of
which were external and 36 internal), for a total of 27544
atoms in a rectangular box of 61 × 61 × 67 Å.
The final ensemble was submitted to energy minimization cycles, followed by simulated annealing in order to
lead the system to a more favourable energetic condition
before starting the pure MD simulation.
During all these simulation steps, the backbone of the
seven TM helices, the helix 8 domain and the structured
EL2 motifs were constrained to maintain the overall
arrangement of the helical bundle and the structural conserved organization of EL2.
The protocol by which the assembly was prepared for the
MD run was composed of separated cycles as described
below. For the earlier minimization steps, the steepest
descent algorithm was applied. Only one or two components of the system were allowed to move in each stage,
while the remaining components were fixed. The minimization sequence of the various component of the system
was the following: first the lipids, then the water, then
both lipids and water, and finally the whole system. The
latter was further minimized using the conjugate gradient
algorithm, and then a first run of 200 ps of MD simulation
at 5 K was performed. At the end of this first minimization
and relaxation protocol, a simulated annealing procedure
was performed as follows. The system was heated from 5
to 500 K in 240 ps, then cooled from 500 to 300 K and
reheated to 500 K in 200 ps. The heating-cooling process
was repeated six times; after that, the system was brought
back to 5 K. The global duration of the simulated annealing protocol was 1660 ps, during which the backbone of
all α-helices and EL2 were potentially restrained using a
force constant of 1000 (kJmol-1nm-2). The analysis of the

Page 16 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:263

dynamic behaviour of the assembly was performed on the
energetically minimized structure obtained above. The
system was reheated up to 310 K in 400 ps and kept at this
temperature for further 240 ps by using a force constant of
100 (kJmol-1nm-2). Ten ns of dynamics simulation were
then performed without any constraints in order to
explore conformational changes of the receptor protein
under constant standard conditions. The reliability of the
MD simulation methodology was then compared with
the results obtained from a "trial" run performed applying
NOE distance restraints to the interhelical H-bond distances for 3 ns. In particular, the restraints were applied
for the distances between the backbone carbonyl oxygen
atom of the residue "n" and the backbone NH-group of
the residue "n+4" of TM7, with the exception of the prolines. After the first 3 ns, the restraints were removed and
the MD simulation was continued for further 3 ns without
any restraints.
Ligand simulations
The interactions between GPR17 and three nucleotide ligands (UDP, MRS2179 and cangrelor) were investigated by
means of MD simulations.

The average structure of the system taken during the time
frame from 3 to 6 ns of the MD was used for the ligandreceptor simulations. The three ligands were docked into
the spatial region corresponding to the putative nucleotide binding pocket for P2Y receptors. To ensure that the
starting ligand/receptor complex configurations were
energetically favourable, docking experiments were conducted on the average structure of MD described above.
Briefly, the average structure was initially submitted to a
binding-cavity search using the Sitefinder tool included in
the Delos package [43]. A transmembrane region spatially
overlapping to the nucleotide binding pocket suggested
for the other nucleotide-activating receptors was found on
GPR17. UDP was docked in the pocket with the same orientation expected for nucleotide-receptor complexes: the
docked ligand together with the sidechains of the residues
within 4.5 Å distance were then locally minimized. Docking experiment were performed using the docking tool for
rigid ligands included in the Delos package. The standard
simulated-annealing protocol provided in the Delos package was used for the docking protocol. The charge state of
the ligands was computed using the converter software
VEGA [57] with the standard Gasteiger-Marsili's method
[58]. The best energy scoring obtained by UDP and consistent with our previous hypothesis on ligand orientation
was used as a starting configuration for the MD run.
MRS2179 and cangrelor starting configurations for MD
were instead defined via superimposition with the final
UDP placement and then re-docked into the putative
binding pocket using Delos. Ligand's superimposition
and the starting coordinates of the ligands were obtained

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/263

using Moe [59]. Ligands topology were obtained from the
automatic server PRODRG [60,61] using the standard
Gromacs forcefield. The ligands were inserted into the
binding pocket mentioned before and the systems were
prepared for the MD simulations using a stepwise protocol. First, the systems were gradually minimized via the
steepest descent allowing the various components to
move individually with the following order: solvent and
lipids, sidechains, the whole systems. The conjugate gradient method was then applied to improve the energy content of the systems. The three ligand-receptor-membrane
complexes were heated to the simulation temperature of
310 K in 300 ps and the three MD runs were started using
the general conditions defined for this study and
described below. For UDP and MRS2179, 3 ns of MD run
were computed; for cangrelor the MD run was extended to
6 ns.
Computational details
MD simulations were run on a Linux cluster Blade with
Xion processors. All minimization steps, MD simulations
and analysis were curried out using the Gromacs 3.3 package [55,56]. All the MD simulations were performed using
the standard Gromacs force field; the periodic boundary
conditions were applied in all three x, y and z dimensions.
The isothermal isobaric NPT ensemble (constant number
of particles, pressure and temperature) was applied. Each
component of the system was separately coupled to a temperature bath at 310 K, with a coupling constant τt of 0.1
ps. The pressure coupling was set as independent in the x
and y directions (semi isotropic coupling), with a constant pressure of 1 bar and a coupling constant τp of 1 ps.
A 2 fs time step was used for the integration of the equations of motions and all bond distances involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using LINCS [62].
Coulombian interactions were treated with the PME
model and a twin range of cut-off radius of 1.8 nm for
both the electrostatics and the van Der Waals interactions
was used. Configurations were saved for every 1 ps for
analysis.
