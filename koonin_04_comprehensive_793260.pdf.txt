Abstract

Genome Biology 2004, 5:R7

information

Conclusions: The KOG analysis reveals a conserved core of largely essential eukaryotic genes as well as major diversification and
innovation associated with evolution of eukaryotic genomes. The results provide quantitative support for major trends of
eukaryotic evolution noticed previously at the qualitative level and a basis for detailed reconstruction of evolution of eukaryotic
genomes and biology of ancestral forms.

interactions

Results: We examined functional and evolutionary patterns in the recently constructed set of 5,873 clusters of predicted
orthologs (eukaryotic orthologous groups or KOGs) from seven eukaryotic genomes: Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Encephalitozoon cuniculi.
Conservation of KOGs through the phyletic range of eukaryotes strongly correlates with their functions and with the effect of
gene knockout on the organism's viability. The approximately 40% of KOGs that are represented in six or seven species are
enriched in proteins responsible for housekeeping functions, particularly translation and RNA processing. These conserved KOGs
are often essential for survival and might approximate the minimal set of essential eukaryotic genes. The 131 single-member, paneukaryotic KOGs we identified were examined in detail. For around 20 that remained uncharacterized, functions were predicted
by in-depth sequence analysis and examination of genomic context. Nearly all these proteins are subunits of known or predicted
multiprotein complexes, in agreement with the balance hypothesis of evolution of gene copy number. Other KOGs show a variety
of phyletic patterns, which points to major contributions of lineage-specific gene loss and the 'invention' of genes new to eukaryotic
evolution. Examination of the sets of KOGs lost in individual lineages reveals co-elimination of functionally connected genes.
Parsimonious scenarios of eukaryotic genome evolution and gene sets for ancestral eukaryotic forms were reconstructed. The
gene set of the last common ancestor of the crown group consists of 3,413 KOGs and largely includes proteins involved in genome
replication and expression, and central metabolism. Only 44% of the KOGs, mostly from the reconstructed gene set of the last
common ancestor of the crown group, have detectable homologs in prokaryotes; the remainder apparently evolved via duplication
with divergence and invention of new genes.

Background

Comparative analysis of genomes from distant species provides new insights into gene functions, genome evolution and
phylogeny. In particular, the comparative genomics of
prokaryotes has revealed previously underappreciated major
trends in genome evolution, namely, extensive lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [1-7]. To
efficiently extract functional and evolutionary information
from multiple genomes, rational classification of genes based
on homologous relationships is indispensable. The two principal classes of homologs are orthologs and paralogs [8-11].
Orthologs are defined as homologous genes that evolved via
vertical descent from a single ancestral gene in the last common ancestor of the compared species. Paralogs are homologous genes, which, at some stage of evolution, have evolved by
duplication of an ancestral gene. Orthology and paralogy are
intimately linked because, if a duplication (or a series of
duplications) occurs after the speciation event that separated
the compared species, orthology becomes a relationship
between sets of paralogs, rather than individual genes (in
which case, such genes are called co-orthologs).
Correct identification of orthologs and paralogs is of central
importance for both the functional and evolutionary aspects
of comparative genomics [12,13]. Orthologs typically occupy
the same functional niche in different organisms; in contrast,
paralogs evolve to functional diversification as they diverge
after the duplication [14-16]. Therefore, robustness of
genome annotation depends on accurate identification of
orthologs. A clear demarcation of orthologs and paralogs is
also required for constructing evolutionary scenarios, which
include, along with vertical inheritance, lineage-specific gene
loss and HGT [5,7].
In principle, orthologs, including co-orthologs, should be
identified by means of phylogenetic analysis of entire families
of homologous proteins, which is expected to define orthologous protein sets as clades [17-19]. However, for genomewide protein sets, such analysis remains extremely laborintensive, and error-prone as well. Accordingly, procedures
have been developed for identifying sets of likely orthologs
without explicit referral to phylogenetic analysis. These procedures are based on the notion of a genome-specific best hit
(BeT), that is, the protein from a target genome that is most
similar (typically in terms of similarity scores computed using
BLAST or another sequence-comparison method) to a given
protein from the query genome [20,21]. The assumption central to this approach is that orthologs have a greater similarity
to each other than to any other protein from the respective
genomes. When multiple genomes are analyzed, pairs of
probable orthologs detected on the basis of BeTs are combined into orthologous clusters represented in all or a subset
of the analyzed genomes [20,22]. This approach, amended
with additional procedures for detecting co-orthologous protein sets and for treating multidomain proteins, was implemented in the database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/2/R7

(COGs) of proteins [20,23,24]. The current COG set includes
approximately 70% of the proteins encoded in 69 genomes of
prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes [25]. The COGs have
been used for functional annotation of new genomes [26-29],
target selection in structural genomics [30-32], identification
of potential drug targets [33,34] and genome-wide evolutionary studies [4,13,35-38]. Sonnhammer and co-workers independently developed a similar methodology for identification
of co-orthologous protein sets from pairwise genome comparisons and applied it to the sequenced eukaryotic genomes
[39].
A central notion introduced in the context of the COG analysis
is that of a phyletic pattern, that is, the pattern of representation (presence-absence) of analyzed species in each COG
[13,20]. Similar concepts have been independently developed
and applied by others [40,41]. The COGs show a remarkable
scatter of phyletic patterns, with only a small minority represented in all sequenced genomes. A recent quantitative study
showed that parsimonious evolutionary scenarios for most
COGs involve multiple events of gene loss and HGT [7]. Both
similarity and complementarity among the phyletic patterns
of COGs, in conjunction with other information, such as conservation of gene order, have been successfully employed to
predict gene functions [13,42,43]. The comparison of phyletic
pattern has been formalized in set-theoretical algorithms and
systematically applied to the computational and experimental analysis of bacterial flagellar systems, which demonstrated
the considerable robustness of this approach [44].
We recently extended the system of orthologous protein clusters to complex, multicellular eukaryotes [25]. Here, we
examine the phyletic patterns of KOGs in connection with
known and predicted protein functions. In-depth analysis of
some of these KOGs resulted in prediction of previously
uncharacterized, but apparently essential, conserved eukaryotic protein functions. We also reconstruct the parsimonious
scenario of evolution of the crown-group eukaryotes by
assigning the loss of genes (KOGs) and emergence of new
genes to the branches of the phylogenetic tree and explicitly
delineate the minimal gene sets for various ancestral forms.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic, genome-wide
examination of the sets of orthologous genes in eukaryotes.

Results and discussion
KOGs for seven sequenced eukaryotic genomes:
functional and evolutionary implications of phyletic
patterns
Eukaryotic KOGs were constructed on the basis of the comparison of proteins encoded in the genomes of three animals
(Homo sapiens [45], the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster
[46] and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [47]), the
green plant Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) [48], two fungi
(budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [49] and fission
yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [50]) and the

Common phyletic patterns of genes that otherwise were not
suspected to be functionally linked might suggest the existence of such connections and prompt additional analysis

refereed research

During the manual curation of the KOG set, the KOGs with
unexpected patterns were scrutinized in an effort to detect
potential highly diverged members from one or more of the
analyzed genomes. Some of these unexpected patterns might
indicate that a gene is still missing in the analyzed set of protein sequences from one or more of the species included;
reports of newly discovered genes have appeared since the
release of the initial reports on genome sequences of complex
eukaryotes, for example, as a result of massive sequencing of
human cDNAs [54], exhaustive annotation of the Drosophila
genome [55] and comparative analysis of closely related yeast
genomes [56]. The unexpected phyletic patterns seem, however, largely to reflect the extensive, lineage-specific gene loss
that is characteristic of eukaryotic evolution [57]; on many
occasions, this scenario is supported by the presence of
orthologs in other eukaryotic lineages and/or in prokaryotes
(Table 1). However, interesting exceptions to the multiple loss
explanation might exist as exemplified by the ATP/ADPtranslocase, which is present in Arabidopsis and Encephalitozoon and could have evolved via independent HGT from
intracellular bacterial parasites ([58] and Table 2).

reports

The phyletic patterns of KOGs reveal both the existence of a
conserved eukaryotic gene core and substantial diversity. The
'pan-eukaryotic' genes, which are represented in each of the
seven analyzed genomes, account for around 20% of the
KOGs, and approximately the same number of KOGs include
all species except for the microsporidian, an intracellular parasite with a highly degraded genome [51]. Among the remaining KOGs, a large group includes representatives of the three
analyzed animal species (worm, fly and humans) but a substantial fraction (approximately 30%) are KOGs with

reviews

Figure 1 shows the assignment of the proteins from each of
the analyzed eukaryotes to KOGs with different numbers of
species, TWOGs and LSEs. The fraction of proteins assigned
to KOGs tends to decrease with the increasing genome size,
from 81% for S. pombe to 51% for the largest, the human
genome. (For reasons that remain unclear, but might be
related to its intracellular parasitic lifestyle, E. cuniculi has a
relatively small fraction of conserved proteins that belonged
to KOGs: approximately 60%.) The contribution of LSEs
shows the opposite trend, being the greatest in the largest
genomes, that is, human and Arabidopsis, and minimal in the
microsporidian (Figure 1). A notable difference was observed
between eukaryotes in terms of their representation in KOGs
found in different numbers of species. While the three unicellular organisms are represented mainly in the highly conserved seven- or six-species KOGs, a much larger fraction of
the gene set in animals and Arabidopsis is accounted for by
LSEs, and by KOGs found in three or four genomes. These
include animal-specific genes and genes that are shared by
plants and animals but not by fungi and the microsporidian
(Figure 1). The large number of KOGs in the latter group (700
KOGs represented in Arabidopsis and at least two animal
species) is notable and probably results from massive, lineage-specific loss of genes during eukaryotic evolution (see
below).

comment

microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi [51]. The procedure for KOG construction was a modification of the one previously used for COGs [20,24] and is described in greater
detail elsewhere ([25]; see also Materials and methods). An
important difference stems from the fact that complex
eukaryotes encode many more multidomain proteins than
prokaryotes and, furthermore, orthologous eukaryotic proteins often differ in domain composition, with additional
domains accrued in more complex forms [3,45]. Accordingly,
and unlike the original COG construction procedure, probable orthologs with different domain architectures were
assigned to one KOG and were not split if they shared a common core of domains. In addition to the KOGs, which consisted of at least three species, clusters of putative orthologs
from two species (TWOGs) and lineage-specific expansions
(LSEs) of paralogs from each of the analyzed genomes were
identified ([25,52]; see also Materials and methods). In most
of the analyses discussed below, KOGs and TWOGs are
treated together, unless otherwise specified.

2). As can be envisaged from their presence in diverse eukaryotic taxa, including the 'minimal' genome of

interactions

Known and new functions of single-member, paneukaryotic KOGs

refereed research

The distribution of KOGs by the number of paralogs in each
genome is shown in Figure 3. The preponderance of lineagespecific duplication of conserved genes, that is, intra-KOG
LSEs, in multicellular eukaryotes is obvious. Cases when a
single gene in yeast or, particularly, Encephalitozoon, has two
or more co-orthologs in animals and/or plants are most common in KOGs, whereas the reverse situation is rare. These
observations support the notion of the major contribution of
LSE to the evolution of eukaryotic complexity [52]. However,
131 KOGs are represented by a single ortholog in all genomes
compared (Table 2) and a substantial number of KOGs have
one member from a majority of the genomes (data not
shown). Recent theoretical modeling of the evolution of paralogous families has suggested that, in general, ancient protein families tend to have multiple paralogs [5,63]. Therefore,
whenever a KOG has a single member in all or most species,
this should be attributed to selection against duplication of
this particular gene. A prominent cause of such selection
could be the involvement of the respective gene products in
essential multisubunit complexes, such that imbalance
between subunits leads to deleterious effects [64].

deposited research

Figure 2 shows the distribution of known and predicted functions of eukaryotic proteins among 20 functional categories
for the entire set of KOGs and, separately, for KOGs represented in six or seven species and the animal-specific KOGs.
Compared to the functional breakdown of prokaryotic COGs
[25], the prevalence of signal transduction is notable among
eukaryotes. This feature is particularly prominent in animalspecific KOGs, whereas the highly conserved set is comparatively enriched in proteins that are involved in translation,
transcription, chaperone-like functions, cell cycle control and
chromatin dynamics (Figure 2). The large number of KOGs

for which only general functional prediction was feasible, and
those whose functions remain unknown, even among the subset that is represented in six or seven eukaryotic species,
emphasizes that our current understanding of eukaryotic
biology is seriously lacking with even in respect of the functions of highly conserved genes.

leading to concrete functional predictions [42,59-61]. The
pair of KOG5324 and KOG4246 is a case in point that has not
been described previously. The initial observation that these
KOGs share the same unusual pattern of presence-absence in
eukaryotes, and have similar phyletic patterns in prokaryotes,
with a ubiquitous presence in archaea, prompted a more
detailed examination of the multiple alignments of the
respective proteins and the conservation of the (predicted)
operon organization in archaea and bacteria (Table 2 and
data not shown). The combination of clues from these analyses suggests that the two proteins interact in a still uncharacterized pathway of RNA processing, which also includes RNA
3'-phosphate cyclase (KOG3980)) [62] and cytosine-C5methylase (NOL1/NOP2 in eukaryotes; KOG1122). The proteins in KOG3833 and KOG4528 are likely to represent novel
enzyme families, possibly a kinase-phosphatase pair (E.V.K.
and L. Aravind, unpublished data). Notably, these predicted
new enzymes are present in animals and E. cuniculi but not in
Arabidopsis or yeasts. In contrast, KOG3980 is present in all
analyzed eukaryotic genomes except for Arabidopsis,
whereas KOG1122 is pan-eukaryotic. These differences in the
phyletic patterns of the components of the predicted pathway
are concordant with the patterns in eukaryotes in that.

The small, regulatory subunit

forms a pan-eukaryotic
KOG3044, which is a paralog
of KOG0861 (the only
recent duplication in
KOG3044 is seen in
vertebrates). In contrast,
another paralog, the small
subunit of DNA polymerase
ε, is represented in animals,
fungi and the early-branching
protozoan Plasmodium, but
not in plants or
Microsporidia. Thus, the
history of this polymerase
subunit apparently involved
inactivation of the
phosphatase (or nuclease)
inherited from archaea, with
subsequent duplications at
early stages of eukaryotic
evolution [123]

the proteins of this KOG

(missing in humans and

Distribution of the KOGs by the number of paralogs in each of the
analyzed eukaryotic genomes. The species abbreviations are as in Figure 1.

Encephalitozoon, and as shown by comparison with the
knockout phenotype data (Table 2 and see below), these paneukaryotic KOGs are of particular biological importance. For
the great majority of these KOGs (113 of the 131), the function
has been experimentally determined or confidently predicted
to a varying degree of detail using computational methods
(Table 2). However, around 20 KOGs from this set remained
uncharacterized at the time of this analysis and, for all but two
of these, substantial functional inferences could be drawn
through a combination of sequence-profile analysis, structure
prediction and genomic-context analysis of prokaryotic
homologs (Table 2). Some of these predicted new functions
are variations on well-known themes, such as two predicted
PP-loop ATPases, which are probably involved in novel,
essential RNA modifications (KOGs 2522 and 2316) or two
predicted E3 components of ubiquitin ligases (KOGs 0396
and 3800). Other predicted functions appear to be completely new, such as proteins in KOG3176 and 3303 which are
likely to be essential components of eukaryotic replication
and/or repair systems. Each of these uncharacterized but
ubiquitous and largely essential eukaryotic genes is an attractive target for experimental studies.
Examination of the experimentally characterized and predicted functions of pan-eukaryotic, single-member KOGs
leads to interesting conclusions. Nearly all the functionally
characterized KOGs in this set consist of proteins that are
subunits of known multiprotein complexes (Table 2). The
most prominent of these are the complexes involved in rRNA
processing and ribosome assembly, such as the recently discovered rRNA processosome and the pre-40S subunit, as well
as the spliceosome, and various complexes involved in
transcription (Table 2). Accordingly, this set of KOGs is markedly enriched for proteins involved in various forms of RNA
processing, assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles
and transcription. In addition, KOGs in the single-member

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/2/R7

pan-eukaryotic set include subunits of molecular complexes
that are not directly related to RNA processing, such as the
proteasome, the TCP-1 chaperonin complex [65] and the
TRAPP complex involved in protein trafficking [66]. Altogether, more than 80% of the yeast proteins in the paneukaryotic, single-member KOGs belong to known macromolecular complexes included in the MIPS database [67], as
compared to around 64% for all yeast proteins in the KOGs,
which is a moderate but statistically highly significant excess
(data not shown). This preponderance of multiprotein complex formation among the single-member pan-eukaryotic
KOGs is fully compatible with the balance hypothesis [64].
The most unexpected observation regarding the single-member, pan-eukaryotic KOGs, is probably that in 14 of these proteins, the only detectable domain was the WD40 repeat
(Table 2). This is particularly notable because WD40-repeat
proteins, which are extremely abundant in eukaryotes and are
present in several prokaryotic lineages as well [68], are not
generally known to form well-defined, one-to-one orthologous relationships. The WD40 proteins in the pan-eukaryotic
KOGs listed in Table 2 are exceptions, which is probably due
to their unique and essential roles in the assembly of RNAprocessing complexes. It has recently been demonstrated
that, in S. cerevisiae, seven of these proteins are subunits of
the 18S rRNA processosome, or at least are involved in ribosomal assembly [69,70]. Taking these results together with the
unusual phyletic pattern, it seems possible to predict with

reviews

With some notable exceptions, such as the WD40 proteins,
the KOGs in the single-member, pan-eukaryotic set show
remarkable patterns of evolutionary conservation: they are
either (nearly) ubiquitous in the three kingdoms of life, for
example, RNA polymerase subunits, or are universally conserved in eukaryotes and archaea but missing in bacteria,
such as most of the proteins implicated in RNA processing
(Table 2). Thus, it appears that elaborate molecular machines
central to the functioning of the eukaryotic cell have evolved,
largely from ancestral archaeo-eukaryotic components, at the
onset of eukaryotic evolution, and both loss and duplication
of the respective genes have been strongly selected against
throughout the rest of eukaryotic evolution.

contributions from both lineage-specific gene loss and HGT
to genome evolution, with the relative likelihoods of these
events remaining uncertain [5,7]. The possibility of substantial HGT between major lineages of eukaryotes can
apparently be safely disregarded, providing for an unambiguous most parsimonious scenario that includes only gene loss
and emergence of new genes as elementary events.

interactions

Some crucial aspects of the phylogenetic tree of the eukaryotic crown group remain a matter of contention. The consensus
of many phylogenetic analyses appears to point to an animalfungal clade and clustering of microsporidia with the fungi.
However, a major uncertainty remains with respect to the
topology of the animal tree: the majority of studies on protein
phylogenies support a coelomate (chordate-arthropod) clade

information

Assuming a particular species tree topology, methods of evolutionary parsimony analysis can be used to construct a parsimonious scenario of evolution, that is, mapping of different
types of evolutionary events onto the branches of the tree.
With prokaryotes, the problem is confounded by the major

We then compared the distributions of evolutionary rates for
different functional categories of KOGs (Tables 3,4 and Figure 4b). Although all the distributions substantially
overlapped, there was a statistically highly significant difference between the evolutionary rates for proteins with different functions (Tables 3,4 and Figure 4b). The slowestevolving proteins are those involved in translation and RNA
processing, the fastest-evolving ones are involved in cellular
trafficking and transport, whereas components of replication
and transcription systems have intermediate evolutionary
rates (Tables 3,4 and Figure 4b).

reports

Genome-wide analysis of protein evolutionary rates shows a
broad range of variation [71]. Here, we investigate the variation of evolutionary rates among the ubiquitous KOGs represented in all seven analyzed genomes and the connection
between the evolutionary rate and protein function in the
KOG set. The characteristic evolutionary rate of each KOG,
which included a member(s) from Arabidopsis, was determined by measuring the mean evolutionary distance from
Arabidopsis (the outgroup in the phylogenetic tree; see
below) to the other species. Even among the KOGs that
include all seven species and, accordingly, appear to represent the conserved core of eukaryotic genes, the evolutionary
rates differ by a factor of 20 between the fastest- and the slowest-evolving KOGs. Excluding 5% of the KOGs from each tail
of the distribution still leaves almost a fourfold difference in
evolutionary rates (Figure 4a).

*Only the KOGs that included a member(s) from Arabidopsis were
analyzed; the evolutionary rates are the average distances between the
Arabidopsis representative in the given KOG and the proteins from
other species (see Material and methods for details). The functional
categories are designated as in Figure 5.

[72-74], whereas rRNA phylogeny and some protein family
trees point to the so-called ecdysozoan (arthropod-nematode) clade [75-78]. We treated the phyletic pattern of each
KOG as a string of binary characters (1 for the presence of the
given species and 0 for its absence in the given KOG) and
constructed the parsimonious scenarios of gene loss and
emergence during evolution of the eukaryotic crown group
for both the coelomate and the ecdysozoan topologies of the
phylogenetic tree. For the purpose of this reconstruction, the
Dollo parsimony approach was adopted [79]. Under this
approach, gene loss is considered irreversible; thus, a gene (a
KOG member) can be lost independently in several evolutionary lineages but cannot be regained. This assumption is justified by the implausibility of HGT between eukaryotes (the
Dollo approach is not valid for reconstruction of prokaryotic
ancestors).

-

In the resulting parsimonious scenarios, each branch was
associated with both gene loss and emergence of new genes,
with the exception of the plant branch and the branch leading
to the common ancestor of fungi and animals, to which gene
losses could not be assigned with the current set of genomes
(Figure 5a,b). There is little doubt that, once genomes of
early-branching eukaryotes are included, gene loss associated
with these branches will become apparent. The principal features of the reconstructed scenarios include massive gene loss
in the fungal clade, with additional elimination of numerous
genes in the microsporidian; emergence of a large set of new
genes at the onset of the animal clade; and subsequent substantial gene loss in each of the animal lineages, particularly
in the nematodes and arthropods (Figure 5a,b). The estimated number of genes lost in S. cerevisiae after its divergence from the common ancestor with the other yeast species,
S. pombe, closely agreed with a previous estimate produced
by a different approach [57]. The switch from the coelomate
topology of the animal sub-tree to the ecdysozoan topology
resulted in relatively small changes in the distribution of
gains and losses: the most notable difference was the greater
number of genes lost in the nematode lineage and the smaller
number of genes lost in the insect lineage under the ecdysozoan scenario compared to the coelomate scenario (Figure
5a,b).
The parsimony analysis described above involves explicit
reconstruction of the gene sets of ancestral eukaryotic
genomes. Under the Dollo parsimony model, which was used
for this analysis, an ancestral gene (KOG) set is the union of
the KOGs that are shared by the respective outgroup and each
of the remaining species. Thus, the gene set for the common
ancestor of the crown group includes all the KOGs in which
Arabidopsis co-occurs with any of the other analyzed species.
Similarly, the reconstructed gene set for the common ancestor of fungi and animals consists of all KOGs in which at least
one fungal species co-occurs with at least one animal species.
These are conservative reconstructions of ancestral gene sets
because, as already indicated, gene losses in the lineages
branching off the deepest bifurcation could not be detected.
Under this conservative approach, 3,413 genes (KOGs) were
assigned to the last common ancestor of the crown group

information

The functional profiles of the gene sets that were lost in different lineages showed substantial differences (Table 5). Thus,
for example, in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of
the animals, the greatest loss among genes assigned to
functional categories was seen in amino acid and coenzyme
metabolism; in contrast, in the fly and the nematode, more
substantial degradation was observed among transcription
factors and proteins with chaperone-like functions. Genes for
proteins involved in RNA processing and translation are, in
general, not heavily affected by loss except in the highly
degraded parasite E. cuniculi. On many occasions, the switch

(Figure 5a,b). More realistically, it appears likely that a certain number of ancestral genes have been lost in all, or all but
one, of the analyzed lineages during subsequent evolution,
such that the gene set of the eukaryotic crown group ancestor
might have been close in size to those of modern yeasts. In
terms of the functional composition, the reconstructed core
gene set of the crown-group ancestor resembled more the
highly conserved KOGs than the animal-specific KOGs (Figure 3) in being enriched in housekeeping functions such as
translation, transcription and RNA processing (data not
shown).

from the coelomate to the ecdysozoan topology replaces two
independent, parallel losses in the insect and nematode
clades with a single loss at the base of the ecdysozoan branch,
although, on the whole, trees based on gene content support
the coelomate topology [74]. In particular, the ecdysozoan
topology, unlike the coelomate topology, implies early loss of
several genes involved in translation, transcription and repair
(Table 6). Notably, a large fraction of genes lost in each lineage has only a general functional prediction or no prediction
at all (Table 5). This emphasizes the paucity of our current
understanding of lineage-specific gene sets.
As noticed previously during the analysis of the genes lost in
S. cerevisiae after its divergence from the common ancestor
with S. pombe, functionally connected genes tend to be coeliminated during evolution [57]. The present study generalizes this conclusion as many functionally coherent groups of

co-eliminated KOGs become apparent (Table 5). Importantly,
different branches of the same complex systems tend to be
eliminated in parallel in different lineages, for example,
largely non-overlapping sets of genes for proteins of the
ubiquitin-proteasome-signalosome systems are lost in the
fungal-microsporidial lineage and in the nematodes (Table
6). It seems likely that elimination of these genes reflects
independent trends for simplification of regulatory processes
in these lineages.
An interesting trend seen in these data is the deterioration of
the mitochondrial ribosome, which occurred in several
eukaryotic lineages and appears to have been partly parallel
(as it occurred independently in fungi-microsporidia and in
animals) and partly consecutive: early loss in the ancestral
animal line was followed by elimination of additional genes
for ribosomal proteins in individual lineages (Table 6). C.

Evolutionary relationships between eukaryotic and
prokaryotic orthologous gene sets
The prokaryotic COGs and eukaryotic KOGs were identified
in separate genome comparisons, although an overlap existed
because both sets included the unicellular eukaryotes, namely
two yeasts and the microsporidian. To identify the
prokaryotic counterparts of the KOGs, the sequences of the
eukaryotic proteins included in the KOGs were compared
using the RPS-BLAST program to the position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) constructed for all prokaryotic COGs

An exhaustive analysis of the patterns of gene loss is beyond
the scope of this work. It seems clear that it has potential of
improving our understanding of eukaryotic evolution and

gene groups.

might have a 'minimal' mitochondrial ribosome [80]; the

([81] see Materials and methods for details). The results were
checked manually and also by comparing the assignment of
proteins from unicellular eukaryotes to each of the orthologous gene sets. Altogether, probable orthologous relationships were established between 2,456 eukaryotic KOGs and
TWOGs (44% of the total) and 1,516 prokaryotic COGs. A
more detailed breakdown of the relationships between
eukaryotic and prokaryotic orthologous gene clusters could
reveal important evolutionary trends. Figure 6a compares the
occurrence of prokaryotic counterparts for the entire set of
eukaryotic KOGs and its subsets conserved at different levels.

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/2/R7

Clearly, the reconstructed gene set of the common ancestor of
the crown group and, particularly, the pan-eukaryotic KOGs
are enriched in ancient KOGs (those with prokaryotic
counterparts) as compared to the full KOG collection. In contrast, among KOGs that are inferred to have evolved in individual lineages within the crown group, a significantly lower
fraction has detectable prokaryotic counterparts (Figure 6a).
Early evolution of eukaryotes is known to have involved
duplication of ancient genes inherited from prokaryotes [82],
and this was apparent in the KOGs against COGs comparison.
Although one-to-one relationships were predominant, in
around 30% of cases, two or more eukaryotic KOGs
corresponded to the same prokaryotic COG (Figure 6b). This
indicates extensive duplication of ancestral genes at early
stages of eukaryotic evolution; moreover, a substantial fraction of these genes have undergone repeated duplications,
resulting in a one-to-many relationship between prokaryotic
and eukaryotic orthologs (Figure 6b).
An in-depth analysis of the relationships between eukaryotic
and prokaryotic orthologous gene clusters should include an
attempt to decipher their evolutionary history, that is,
classification of the C/KOGs represented both in eukaryotes
and prokaryotes into: those that have been inherited from the
last universal common ancestor; the archaeo-eukaryotic
subset; and those that are shared because of HGT between
bacteria and eukaryotes at various stages of eukaryotic evolution. This analysis is beyond the scope of the present work.
Perhaps the principal message to stress here is that, using a
fairly sensitive sequence comparison method, prokaryotic
homologs could be detected for only some 44% of the eukaryotic KOGs, and this fraction increased to around 54% for
those genes that could be traced to the last common ancestor
of the crown group (Figure 6a). This observation emphasizes
the major amount of innovation that accompanied the emergence and early evolution of eukaryotes; even those KOGs for
which prokaryotic counterparts will be eventually identified
through more sensitive sequence and structure comparison
apparently experienced rapid evolution during the
prokaryote-eukaryote transition.

Phyletic patterns of KOGs and dispensability of yeast
and worm genes
There are 860 KOGs with at least one representative from
each of the seven analyzed genomes. In accord with the
'knockout rate' hypothesis [83], which has been largely supported by recent, genome-wide analysis of gene conservation
[38,84], it could be expected that these highly conserved
genes were essential for the survival of eukaryotic organisms.
This appears particularly plausible given the near-minimal
eukaryotic gene complement of the microsporidian. The
prediction was put to the test using the recently published
functional profile of the yeast S. cerevisiae genome, which
includes the data on the growth rates of homozygous deletion
strains for 96% of the open reading frames (ORFs) in the

As noticed previously, the complexity of domain architecture
of proteins in some orthologous sets increases with increasing
organismic complexity; this phenomenon has been dubbed
domain accretion [3]. With the KOG set in hand, we sought to
assess the extent of accretion quantitatively by using the data
on the presence of domains from the CDD (conserved domain
alignments database) collection in each of the KOG members.
The results summarized in Table 7 show a relatively small but
statistically significant excess of domains in proteins from
multicellular organisms compared to the orthologs from
unicellular organisms. Furthermore, among the multicellular
eukaryotes, human proteins have the greatest complexity of
domain architectures, followed by Drosophila and

interactions

When the phyletic patterns of the KOGs were superimposed
on the data on gene dispensability (with essential genes operationally defined as those whose deletion had a lethal effect in
a rich medium) [85], it was found that 45% of the essential
genes were conserved in all seven species and 25% were represented in six species (typically with the exception of E.
cuniculi); 15% of the essential yeast genes had no orthologs in
the other analyzed genomes (Figure 7a). In a striking contrast, among non-essential genes, only 16.5% were represented in all compared genomes and 28.5% had no detectable
orthologs (Figure 7a). The reciprocal comparison is equally
illustrative: essential genes composed 18.5% of the entire set
of yeast genes but 35% of the genes (KOGs) represented in all

In C. elegans, much as in yeast, essentiality of genes appears
to correlate with strong evolutionary conservation, as already
noticed in the recent genome-wide study on inhibition of
worm gene expression by RNA interference (RNAi) [86]. We
compared this dataset, which covers around 86% of C. elegans genes, to the phyletic patterns of the respective KOGs.
Of the essential worm genes, 38% were conserved in all seven
compared species and 19% were conserved in six species (Figure 7b). In contrast, only 6% of the non-essential C. elegans
genes were represented in seven species and 7% were conserved in six species (Figure 7b). Thus, there seems to be a
strong and robust connection between a gene's essentiality
and its tendency to be conserved in evolution over a wide span
of taxa; this connection was established using two
independent datasets from biologically extremely different
model organisms.

For an additional set of around 15% non-essential yeast
genes, knockout results in a measurable retardation of growth
[85]. Unexpectedly and in contrast to the result obtained with
the essential genes, we failed to observe a correlation between
the magnitude of a gene's knockout effect on yeast growth and
the phyletic pattern (data not shown). This seems to indicate
that the measured effect on yeast growth might not translate
into an effect on fitness that the loss of the ortholog of the
given gene has in distant species.

seven species. This translates into a statistically highly
significant dependence between a gene's (in)dispensability
and conservation over long evolutionary distances. The probability of the set of highly conserved genes being so enriched
for essential genes as a result of chance was estimated at
<<10-10. Notably, an even greater enrichment for essential
genes was seen among the KOGs that were represented by
one, and only one, ortholog in each of the seven analyzed
genomes: of the 131 such KOGs, 98 (75%) included an essential yeast gene (Table 2). Such preponderance of essential
genes could be expected because, in this set of KOGs, the
indispensability of the respective function could not have
been masked by the presence of paralogs.

For a given pair of species the numbers in each cell below the diagonal represent, from top to bottom: the number of KOGs in which the average
number of detected domains from the CDD collection (cut-off E = 10-3) in the proteins from the species to the left is greater than that for the
species to the right; the number of KOGs with equal average number of domains; the number of KOGs in which the average number of domains is
greater for the species to the right (for example, D. melanogaster has a greater number of detected domains than H. sapiens in 470 KOGs, the same
number in 3,214 KOGs, and a smaller number in 805 KOGs). The numbers above the diagonal are the statistical significance of the difference, P(χ2).

Arabidopsis (Table 6), in agreement with preliminary results
reported previously. Among the unicellular eukaryotes,
Encephalitozoon had by far the least complex domain architectures (Table 6), which reflects the general genome reduction in this intracellular parasite.

Conclusions

The present analysis of KOGs provides quantitative backing
for many trends in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes that
previously have been noticed on the general, qualitative level.
The important quantities reported here include the size of the
conserved core of eukaryotic genes, the conservative reconstructions of ancestral gene sets, the numbers of genes that
appear to have been lost and gained in individual eukaryotic
lineages, and the extent of correlation between gene dispensability and evolutionary conservation, which is reflected in

phyletic patterns. In addition, we evaluated the range of variation of evolutionary rates of genes in different functional categories and obtained statistical support for the important
evolutionary
phenomenon
of
domain
accretion.
Furthermore, we observed that only a minority of eukaryotic
KOGs have readily detectable prokaryotic counterparts,
which emphasizes the extent of innovation linked to the origin of eukaryotes and subsequent major transitions in
eukaryotic evolution, such as the origin of multicellularity
and the origin of animals.
The case study of the KOGs that are represented by just one
member in all eukaryotic genomes compared shows the
potential of KOGs for functional prediction by inferring the
probable functions for almost all KOGs in this set that had
remained uncharacterized. This analysis also revealed
unexpected facets of evolution of widespread and essential

information

For the analysis of domain accretion, conserved domains
from the NCBI CDD database were detected in the eukaryotic
proteins that belonged to the KOGs by using the RPS-BLAST
program [81] with an E-value cut-off of 0.001. Domains with
biased amino acid sequence composition, which tend to produce a high false-positive rate in RPS-BLAST searches, were
excluded from the analysis.

interactions

The parsimonious evolutionary scenario, which included
gene losses and emergence of KOGs mapped to the branches
of the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree, was constructed by using
the DOLLOP program of the PHYLIP package [97]; this
program is based on the Dollo parsimony method, which
assumes irreversibility of character loss [79].

refereed research

During KOG annotation, proteins that are currently annotated as 'hypothetical' or 'unknown', or otherwise had a vague
or suspect annotation, were subject to additional sequence
analysis, which included iterative sequence similarity
searches with the PSI-BLAST program [92], RPS-BLAST
searches for conserved domains [80], and additional domain
architecture analysis using the SMART system [95]. To estimate sequence evolution rates, multiple alignments of KOGs
were constructed using the MAP program [96] and the
pairwise evolutionary distances were calculated with the
maximum likelihood method under the PAM model by using
the PROTDIST program of the PHYLIP package [97]. When a
KOG included more than one member from the given species,
the paralog with the greatest average similarity to proteins
from other organisms was selected to represent the species in
the given KOG. Since A. thaliana is the most likely outgroup
species for the analyzed set of eukaryotes, distances from the
Arabidopsis representative to proteins from all other species
were averaged to estimate the characteristic evolutionary distance for the given KOG. Data from KOGs with excessive variability of the distances between A. thaliana and other species
(standard deviation to mean ratio > 0.5) were discarded. As
the divergence times for all KOGs are presumed to be the
same (and equal to the time elapsed since the last common
ancestor for the eukaryotic crown group), the mean evolutionary distance in a KOG is a measure of the KOG's evolutionary rate.

deposited research

A more detailed description of the procedures employed for
this purpose is presented elsewhere [25]. The protein sets for
all eukaryotic species, with the exception of C. elegans and H.
sapiens, were from the genome division of the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The protein
sequences for C. elegans were from the WormPep67 database
and the human sequences were from NCBI build 30. Briefly,
the KOG construction protocol included: First, the detection
and masking of common, repetitive domains using the RPSBLAST program and the PSSMs for the respective domains
from the CDD collection [81]; second, all-against-all comparison of protein sequences from the analyzed genomes using
the BLASTP program [92], with masking of low sequence
complexity regions using the SEG program [93]; third, identification of triangles of mutually consistent BeTs; merging
triangles of BeTs with a common side to form preliminary
KOGs; forth, adding members of co-orthologous sets missed
at previous step using the COGNITOR procedure [24]; fifth,
manual examination of each candidate KOG, aimed at eliminating the false positives incorporated into the KOGs by the
automatic procedure and inclusion of false negatives that
were missed originally; sixth, assignment of proteins containing promiscuous domains masked at the first step to Fuzzy
Orthologous Groups (FOGs), named after the respective
domains (when a sequence assigned to a KOG contained one
or more masked domains, the sequences of these domains
were restored); and finally, examination of the largest preliminary KOGs, which included numerous proteins from all or
several genomes by using phylogenetic trees, cluster analysis
with the BLASTCLUST program [94], comparison of domain
architectures, and visual inspection of alignments. As a result,
some of these preliminary KOGs were split into two or more
smaller final KOGs.

reports

Materials and methods

Annotation of KOGs included critical assessment of the annotations available through GenBank, other public databases
and the primary literature and additional, in-depth sequence
analysis aimed at detection of previously unnoticed homologous relationships. The annotated functions of KOGs were
classified into 23 categories (see legend to Figure 3), which
were adapted from the functional classification previously
used for COGs [24] by including several specific eukaryotic
categories.

reviews

The current KOG set includes proteins from seven genomes
whose sequences were available as of 1 July, 2002. The
genomes of the mouse [87], the fugu fish [88], the Anopheles
mosquito [89], the urochordate Ciona instestinalis [90] and
the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum [91] have
become available since then but were not included, partly
because of problems with protein annotation for some of
these genomes, and partly due to the time-consuming and
labor-intensive nature of KOG analysis. Inclusion of these
and other newly sequenced genomes should proceed at a
faster rate once the system itself is established, and will enable further, deeper studies into the functional and evolutionary patterns of eukaryotic life.
