Abstract
Background: The development of specialized appendages involved in sperm transfer in the males
of julid millipedes is an extreme case of specialized, complex structures differentiating in a very
advanced phase of post-embryonic development. Here, a non-systemic metamorphosis affects the
external morphology and the internal anatomy of a trunk double segment only.
Presentation of the hypothesis: We hypothesize that during early (possibly embryonic)
development a segmental marker is produced that remains unexploited throughout late embryonic
and early post-embryonic development, until, activated by a systemic signal, it finally determines the
release of a segmentally localized but anatomically major change.
Testing the hypothesis: Key to testing the hypothesis are (1) the identification of both the
putative segmental marker involved in the localization of the legs to be eventually metamorphosed
into gonopods and the systemic signal activating it, (2) the identification of the cell population from
which the gonopods are built, and (3) a longitudinal study of the marker's expression throughout
late embryonic and, possibly, post-embryonic development.
Implications of the hypothesis: Proving the validity of this hypothesis would demonstrate the
existence of a cryptic developmental module that will be activated only months, or years, after it
has been first laid down during early development. This study also opens a window onto the very
poorly explored domain of late expression of developmental genes and molecular control of late
developmental events.

Background
Translation of positional information into the localized
expression of anatomical structures is not limited to the
embryonic phase of development, or to a metamorphosis
systemically affecting the whole animal body. The development of specialized appendages (gonopods) involved
in sperm transfer in the males of julid millipedes (Diplopoda, Julida) [FIG. 1] is an extreme case of specialized,
complex and highly species-specific structures differenti-

ating in a very advanced phase of post-embryonic development. This occurs through a metamorphosis that
deeply affects external morphology and internal anatomy
of the trunk diplosegment bearing the eighth and ninth
pair of legs, while leaving unaffected the sections of the
trunk that both precede and follow it. We propose to call
this kind of dramatic post-embryonic transformations
confined to a circumscribed body district non-systemic metamorphosis.

although a later reinforcement of the signal through novel
expression is probable; (2) this marker remains unexploited throughout late embryonic and early post-embryonic development, until it finally determines the
transcription of genes or the activation of gene products
that release a segmentally localized but anatomically
major change.

Other examples of non-systemic metamorphosis are
offered by the development of a new kind of appendages
replacing the second and third pair of legs lost by some
larval pycnogonids a few instars earlier [1], and by the
transformation of the forelegs of cicadas, from the robust
digging tools of the nymph into the generalized walking
legs of the adult.
In the case of male Helminthomorpha (the large millipede clade that includes the julids), this metamorphosis is
limited to one or very few non-terminal serially homologous elements in an otherwise morphologically homogeneous series of trunk segments. In females, no special
feature develops at any time at the corresponding location. In some julid species, this localized change is partially reversible, with the occurrence of the peculiar
phenomenon called periodomorphosis [2,3]: cyclically,
mature males with fully-developed gonopods moult into
'intercalary' males, with these limbs regressed to a condition similar to the small scale-like appendages of the last
instar preceding sexual maturity, but resume the condition of reproductive adults with fully-developed gonopods within one or a few more moults.

Presentation of the hypothesis
The precise localization of the metamorphic event eventually giving rise to the millipede male gonopods, with the
accompanying changes in the overall arrangement of the
internal organs in the corresponding segments [FIG. 2],
must depend on the strict localization of a positional
marker.
We hypothesize that (1) a segmental marker is produced
during early (possibly embryonic) development,

That this position is marked since early post-embryonic
development is suggested, in particular, by the conservation of the position across the Helminthomorpha, in spite
of the diversity in post-embryonic segmentation schedules, both as number of segments already formed at
hatching and, more conspicuously, as number of segments that are visibly added at each post-embryonic
moult, a figure that in some lineages also varies intra-specifically. Thus, although, in principle, a previously
unspecified position could subsequently acquire its distinctive identity through signals from sources localized
elsewhere in the body, this seems unlikely to occur during
millipede post-embryonic development.
The positional mark may be provided by the sustained
transcription of a key factor, perhaps assisted by trithoraxlike proteins [4], or by the localized expression, determined by an earlier factor, of components of a signal
transduction pathway, which make tissues competent to
respond to a subsequent non-localized signal, as for
instance a hormone.

Testing the hypothesis
It seems sensible to start the search for a positional marker
by a candidate gene approach. The segmental position of
gonopods would perhaps suggest that one of the posterior-group Hox genes is involved. At present, due to the
incomplete expression data for posterior Hox genes in
helminthomorph millipedes, the only term of comparison would be the pill millipede Glomeris marginata [5],
where the Hox complex respects standard collinearity.
This is of limited interest, however, as male pill millipedes
do not possess gonopods, although they differentiate, at
late post-embryonic instars, the terminal leg-pair as
claspers (telopods).
Position and nature of the specified organs might suggest
to focus on Abdominal-B (Abd-B), as this gene is consistently involved in the specification of sexual structures in
animals as different as spiders [6], nematodes [7] and
mammals [8]. The expression pattern of Abd-B has not
been studied in the only helminthomorph millipede, the
polydesmoid Oxidus gracilis, for which data on Hox gene
expression are available [9]; nevertheless, in this species
the anterior border of expression domains of the other
posterior-class Hox genes is known to occur, embryonically, at positions anterior to those of the gonopods.

In the juliform millipede Nopoiulus kochii (Gervais, 1847) (Blaniulidae), the eighth and the ninth pair of trunk
appendages are typical legs since their first appearance in the III post-embryonic instar and so remain in the IV
instar (A, D, G), and only turn into short, scale-like appendages with the moult to the V instar (B, E, H). With a
further moult, the millipede, now in its VI post-embryonic instar, becomes an adult with two pairs of bulky, complex gonopods

In parallel with establishing the molecular nature of the
putative segmental marker involved in the localization of
the legs to be eventually metamorphosed into gonopods,
and identifying the signal that activates it (or releases its
suppression), key to testing our hypothesis are (1) the
identification of the cell population from which the gonopods are built, followed by (2) a longitudinal study of the

marker's expression throughout late embryonic and, possibly, post-embryonic development.
No study is available on the origin, localization, proliferation and differentiation of the cell population eventually
giving rise to the gonopods in any millipede. The possible
occurrence of small clusters of set-aside cells, comparable
to insect histoblasts, should be considered. While their

existence would reinforce our suggestion for an early positional specification, this would also open alternative scenarios as to the mechanism involved.

This study can also open a window onto the very poorly
explored domain of late expression of developmental
genes and molecular control of late developmental events.

To date, millipedes have been proved to be difficult subjects for the study of development. The few classic studies
of their embryonic development [e.g., [10,11]] have been
extended by gene expression work on pill millipedes
[6,12] and by the already mentioned, very limited account
on Oxidus [9]. Post-embryonic stages of helminthomorph
millipedes are difficult to handle experimentally, because
of the heavily calcified armour that covers their body,
often completely, and also because of the disturbance to
histochemical procedures caused by the diversity of
repugnatory substances they produce.

Implications of the hypothesis
Proving the validity of this hypothesis would demonstrate
the existence of a cryptic developmental module that will
be activated only months, or years, after it has been first
laid down during early development and also the existence of positional markers whose information can even
be used repeatedly (periodomorphosis), following morphogenetic reversals of a magnitude and significance only
comparable to the loss and regeneration of major body
parts.
In evolutionary perspective, this change cannot be
equated to the change from the thoracic legs of a caterpillar to the thoracic legs of a butterfly, because in the latter
case it is the adult appendage which is phylogenetically
conservative, while the larval leg is evolutionarily more
derived. In the helminthomorph millipede, what is conserved is the appendage found in the early developmental
stages, followed by metamorphosis into a derived one.
The evolution of gonopods is thus recapitulative, in so far
as the development of the derived condition of the
appendages is preceded by the full development of the
primitive condition of the same structures. It is not easy to
explain this costly developmental pathway in terms of
adaptation. Generally, the legs that are to become gonopods are functionally lost (transformed into scale-like
appendages) within one or two moults. On the other
hand, an uninterrupted series of typical leg pairs, including those that will later metamorphose into gonopods, is
observed since the first post-embryonic instar in a species
(Pachyjulus flavipes) that hatches with more than twenty
leg pairs, rather than the more usual three pairs only [2].
Thus, gonopod evolution in millipedes possibly represent
a case of developmental constraints, whose precise nature
needs be investigated at molecular level.

The final version of this paper has benefited from the insightful comments
offered by two anonymous referees. Ongoing research on non-systemic
metamorphosis in N. kochii is supported by a grant from Italian Ministry of
University and Research to A.M.
