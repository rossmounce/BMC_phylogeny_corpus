Ornithodoros porcinus in Madagascar and new
insights into tick distribution and taxonomy

Abstract
Background: African Swine Fever Virus has devastated more than the half of the domestic pig population in
Madagascar since its introduction, probably in 1997-1998. One of the hypotheses to explain its persistence on the
island is its establishment in local Ornithodoros soft ticks, whose presence has been reported in the past from the
north-western coast to the Central Highlands. The aim of the present study was to verify such hypothesis by
conducting tick examinations in three distinct zones of pig production in Madagascar where African Swine Fever
outbreaks have been regularly reported over the past decade and then to improve our knowledge on the tick
distribution and taxonomy.
Results: Ornithodoros ticks were only found in one pig farm in the village of Mahitsy, north-west of Antananarivo
in the Central Highlands, whereas the tick seemed to be absent from the two other study zones near
Ambatondrazaka and Marovoay. Using 16SrDNA PCR amplification and sequencing, it was confirmed that the
collected ticks belonged to the O. porcinus species and is closely related to the O. p. domesticus sub-species
Walton, 1962. ASFV was detected in 7.14% (13/182) of the field ticks through the amplification of part of the viral
VP72 gene, and their ability to maintain long-term infections was confirmed since all the ticks came from a pig
building where no pigs or any other potential vertebrate hosts had been introduced for at least four years.
Conclusions: Considering these results, O. porcinus is a reservoir for ASFV and most likely acts as vector for ASFV in
Madagascar, but its apparent restricted distribution may limit its role in the epidemiology of the disease in
domestic pigs.

Background
African Swine Fever (ASF) is one of the most serious
diseases in domestic pigs. It is caused by a DNA virus of
the Asfarviridae family and usually results in acute haemorrhagic fever in susceptible animals with possibly up
to 100% mortality in naïve pig herds [1]. No treatment
or vaccine is currently available, and control is essentially based on preventive sanitary measures and a better
knowledge of the epidemiological patterns [1,2]. ASF is
enzootic in most sub-Saharan countries and its propagation is considered to be a major risk for other countries.

Several introductions have been reported in the past in
West Africa, Europe and the Americas, as well as more
recent re-emergences of the disease in the Indian Ocean
and the Caucasus [2,3].
ASF is highly contagious and is transmitted by direct
contact between infected pigs and susceptible ones or
by contact with infectious secretions/excretions. The
virus is highly resistant in tissues and the environment,
contributing to its transmission over long distances
through swill feeding and fomites (e.g., contaminated
material, vehicles or visitors to pig premises). In addition, African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) can be transmitted by soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros, which
may either colonise pig pens in domestic areas or mammal burrows in the wild [4-6]. Considering their capacity to replicate and to maintain the virus over the years

and to transmit the virus “from tick-to-tick” during mating and development stages [7-10], they are also considered excellent reservoirs of ASFV, just like wild African
suids (e.g., warthogs, bush pigs and giant forest hogs).
Enzootic ASF has been closely linked to the existence of
Ornithodoros tick hosts interacting with wild suids, with
O. moubata and O. porcinus ticks from the O. moubata
species complex in East and Southern Africa [5,11], with
O. erraticus in the Iberian Peninsula [6] and perhaps
with O. sonrai in Senegal [12].
ASFV was probably introduced into Madagascar in
1997-1998, from the south-eastern coast of Mozambique
to the south-western part of the island, with a subsequent and rapid spread to other regions [13,14]. This
epizootic disease devastated more than half of the
domestic pig population in Madagascar, with severe economic consequences for the local pork meat market
[14]. It then evolved into an epi-enzootic pattern, with
different hypothetical causes such as the adaptation of
ASFV to local resistant pig populations or its establishment and persistence in native bush pigs and local
Ornithodoros ticks, supplemented by the lack of reliable
sanitary measures to control AFSV epizootic foci. The
existence of bush pigs has been confirmed in forested
areas of north-western, southern and eastern regions of
Madagascar [15], which are considered particularly
interesting interface areas for investigating the links
between the ASFV sylvatic and domestic cycles. For
ticks, specimens from the O. moubata species complex,
formerly identified as O. moubata, were known to be
present in human houses from north-western coast to
Central Highlands of Madagascar and suspected of
transmitting human relapsing fever [16-21]. Then, based
on morphological descriptions from Walton [22], Uilenberg compared these ticks to some specimens more
recently collected in pig pens and concluded that both
actually corresponded to the O. porcinus species [23].
Finally, during the epizootic phase in 2000 following
ASFV introduction, O. porcinus was collected in pig
pens in the Antananarivo region, suggesting a possible
close contact between this tick and infected pigs and a
potential persistence of ASFV in O. porcinus tick hosts
[24]. To date, no more investigations have been conducted, except the preliminary testing of 271 domestic
pig sera in 2006 using an ELISA test to detect anti-O.
moubata saliva antibodies [25,26]. This test detected
1.1% of positive sera and 39.1% of sera were considered
doubtful, near Marovoay, Ambatondrazaka and Antananarivo (Ravaomanana and Vial, unpublished data).
The aims of the present work were: (i) to confirm the
current presence of O. porcinus in pig pens in Madagascar and to better understand its geographical distribution patterns; (ii) to clarify its taxonomy and determine
its phylogenetic relationships to known African

Page 2 of 9

Ornithodoros species and subspecies; and (iii) to detect
natural long-term infections by ASFV in the Malagasy
O. porcinus and to evaluate its potential role in ASFV
domestic cycle of transmission in Madagascar.

Methods
Study zones and periods for field investigations

Three study zones (Antananarivo, Ambatondrazaka and
Marovoay) (Figure 1) were selected and tick examinations in pig pens were conducted during the dry season
from July to December in 2006 (Marovoay) and 2007
(Antananarivo and Ambatondrazaka). Only four additional farms were visited in 2008 in the Antananarivo
zone to investigate the local distribution of O. porcinus.
The three zones had large pig populations (from 8% in
the Ambatondrazaka zone to 40% in the Antananarivo
zone of the total Malagasy pig population) and ASF outbreaks had been regularly reported on farms, with an
estimated incidence ranging from 15.2% to 42.5%,
depending on the area (Costard, personal communications). Pig production systems varied from traditional
small farms in the Marovoay and Ambatondrazaka
zones to more industrialised practices for commercial
purposes in the Antananarivo zone.
The Marovoay zone consists of a dry and hot tropical
coastal zone, characterised by a dry climate throughout the
year. The presence of O. porcinus (formerly O. moubata)
has been reported on the west coast from Mahajunga to
Morondava since the 18th century by Drury and confirmed
by many authors in the first half of the 20 th century
[16-21]. However, more recent investigations suggested
their quasi extinction since the 1950 s, at least from Soalala
to Mahajunga [24,27].
The Ambatondrazaka zone consists of a wet and hot
tropical coastal area. The climate is characterised by
rainfall throughout the year, especially from December
to March. The presence of soft ticks has never been
demonstrated in this zone.
The Antananarivo zone consists of highlands characterised by a high-altitude climate, with a hot and wet
season from October to February and a dry and cold
season from March to September. Although altitude is
usually considered unsuitable for the presence of
Ornithodoros ticks [28], specimens of O. porcinus were
found inside human and animal houses from the 1960 s
to 1980 s in Mahasolo, 150 km from Antananarivo
[23,27], and in 2000 in Mahitsy, Andralanitra and Tsinjoarivo, north-west of Antananarivo and south of Antananarivo, respectively [24].
Tick collections in pig pens

In the Marovoay and Ambatondrazaka zones, a random
cluster sampling by villages was conducted. The sample
size (i.e., the number of farms to be examined in each

village of the study zone) was determined using the
“Detection of disease” module of the WINEPISCOPE
2.0. software (free download at http://www.clive.ed.ac.
uk/winepiscope). It was based on the estimated total
number of pig farms and the estimated proportion of
pig farms to be detected as infested by O. porcinus, with
a confidence interval of 95%. The villages examined for
tick presence were selected from a preliminary farm
census taken in 2006 in the three study zones for
domestic pig sampling and were, as much as possible,
homogenously distributed within each study zone. An
estimated prevalence of infestation of 30% was used
based on previous studies conducted on Ornithodoros
ticks colonizing pig farms in Spain and Africa [5,6]. For
the Antananarivo zone, we targeted pig farms that were
known to be infested in 2000 [24]. Random sampling
was then conducted in the Arivonimamo village (Figure
1). For the three study zones, one quarter of pig farms
that were included in the random sampling were previously detected positive or doubtful using the anti-tick
ELISA test in 2006. Finally, if the presence of O. porcinus was confirmed, local investigations were conducted
around infested farms in order to determine local tick
distribution patterns and the size of tick foci.
Ticks were manually extracted from accessible crevices, small holes and external structures of pig pens,
whereas deeper fissures were examined using a portable
gasoline-powered vacuum cleaner adapted for burrowdwelling ticks [29]. The content of the collected dust
was laid out in a white tray and exposed to the sun in
order to collect Ornithodoros soft ticks that are photophobic [30]. Live ticks were placed in small plastic
boxes, each of them containing a wet piece of filter
paper to maintain a relative humidity suitable for tick
survival. In the laboratory, ticks were stored at -80°C
until analysis.

belonging to the O. moubata species complex according
to the PCR protocol described by Vial [32]. Positive
samples were then tested for ASFV infection using a
nested PCR that amplified part of the VP72 gene and
that was described by Basto [33]. All PCR products were
detected by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel in TAE
1x buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.3)
and stained with ethidium bromide.
Phylogenetic analyses

To determine phylogenetic relationships of collected
ticks and to confirm ASFV infections, some 16 S rDNA
and VP72 PCR products were directly sequenced using
an ABI PRISM 3730xl DNA analyser (Cogenix Meylan,
France). Sequences were edited and manually aligned
using Seaview software [34]. Phylogenetic trees based on
molecular sequences were constructed by applying the
neighbor-joining (NJ), the parsimony (P) and the maximum likelihood (ML) algorithms of the Phylip software
package, using 1000 bootstraps (BS) with random
sequence addition [35]. Single deletion was treated as a
fifth base. VP72 amplified sequences were compared to
the complete sequence of the gene available for the
reference ASFV strain BA71V (M34142 in GenBank).
For 16 S rDNA alignment, the soft tick Argas persicus
from the Argasinae sub-family was used as the outgroup
(L34321 in GenBank). Available 16 S rDNA sequences
of African specimens from the O. moubata species complex were included to refine phylogenetic relationships
of Malagasy ticks, especially the reference sequences for
O. moubata sensu strict Murray, 1877 (L34328 in GenBank), O. porcinus porcinus Walton, 1962 (L34329 in
GenBank) and O. porcinus domesticus Walton, 1962
(L34330 in GenBank) published by Black [36].

Results
Presence of O. porcinus in Malagasy pig pens

Molecular analyses on ticks

O. porcinus ticks collected during the study, as well as
specimens available from previous samplings in 2000,
were identified according to morphological features, sex
and developmental stage [22,23]. After three washings in
1% PBS, a tick homogenate was obtained for each specimen by crushing the tick in 1 ml of MEM supplemented
with 50 U/ml of penicillin, streptomycin and fungizone
in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Tick homogenates were frozen twice at -70°C overnight and then vortexed, to facilitate DNA accessibility before storage at -70°C.
For molecular use, tick homogenates were centrifuged
and DNA extraction was carried out on 200 μL of the
supernatant using Phenol Chloroform [31]. In order to
test the integrity of the extracted DNA, 16 S rDNA of
each tick was amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using primers designed specifically for ticks

O. porcinus was confirmed in one farm located in
Mahitsy (18°45’3’’S, 47°20’47’’E) in the Antananarivo
zone (Figure 1 Figure 2). Four other farms were examined in its 20-2000 m periphery without finding any
other ticks (Table 1). No tick was found in the nine
additional farms that were visited in the Arivonimamo
village from the same zone neither among the 70 farms
examined in the two other zones (Table 1). In the first
zone, it was no more possible to take samples in the
Andralanitra and Tsinjoarivo villages because of the
recent destruction of the pig premises. In the Marovoay
and Ambatondrazaka zones, sampling was incomplete
due to ASF foci occurring during the study period and
that prevented to finish field investigations for biosafety
reasons. As a result, 40 pig pens were visited in the
Marovoay zone instead of the 42 expected, with a confidence level ranging from 90% for Andranofasika to 95%

pig pens were accessible for tick examination instead of
the 35 expected, with a confidence ranging from 92% to
95% and decreasing to 88% for Bejofo.
Molecular identification and phylogeny of Malagasy
O. porcinus

Three 16 S rDNA sequences from ticks collected in
2000 in Mahitsy and three from the same location in
2007-2008 were produced. The amplified sequences
were identical among ticks from 2000 (HM588698 in
GenBank) and 2007-2008 (HM588699 in GenBank),
respectively. 273 bps were aligned with available published sequences for phylogenetic analysis. Ninety-four
sites were variable and 44 were parsimony informative
for the whole dataset (differences at one site represented
in at least two different sequences). Within the O. moubata species complex, 50 sites were variables and 22
were parsimony informative. Malagasy ticks from 2000
and 2006-2008 differed by only one substitution. NJ,
P and ML trees had the same configuration. The consensus tree from the ML method is shown on Figure 3.
The monophily of the O. moubata species complex and
the distinction of O. moubata sensu stricto and O. porcinus were supported by 100% BS values. O. p. porcinus
and O. p. domesticus were differentiated with a 89% BS

Page 6 of 9

support. Specimens from South Africa and Zimbabwe
that were named O. porcinus fell into the O. moubata
sensu stricto group with a 60% BS support. Malagasy
ticks were likely related with the reference specimen
of O. p. domesticus with a 57% BS support, and to
Tanzanian ticks collected in the 1980 s and, more
recently, in 2003.
Detection of ASFV natural infection in Malagasy O.
porcinus

Using PCR amplification of the VP72 virus gene, ASFV
infection was detected in 13 ticks out of 182 positive
ones for 16 S rDNA. All stages and sexes were found to
be infected. Two out of 21 tested ticks (9.52% with 95%
CI [8.94-10.09]) were positive in 2000 and 11 out of 161
(6.83% with 95% CI [6.34-7.32]) in 2007-2008. The
sequencing and the alignment of 243 bps from two
amplified fragments (HM588697 in GenBank) confirmed
the detection of ASFV since they showed 100% homology with VP72 amplified from BA71V.

Discussion
In this present study, O. porcinus was found on a traditional pig farm in Mahitsy in the Antanananarivo zone
(Madagascar), confirming previous results related to the
presence of O. porcinus on the island. The fact that

ticks were found in the same pig pen after an interval of
seven years, whereas they were absent from other neighbouring farms, suggests their high propensity to establish stable focal tick populations and their low dispersal
capacity. These characteristics have been reported for
several Ornithodoros tick species and are linked both to
their endophilous lifestyle and their ability to feed
rapidly on their hosts (a few minutes to one hour, at
least for nymphs and adults) [28,30]. These ticks colonize nests, burrows and caves of vertebrate animals or
cracks and crevices in human and livestock habitats.
They reduce possible exposure to unfavourable external
conditions by rapidly detaching from their vertebrate
hosts before these hosts leave the habitat, and by
remaining in their underground sheltered habitat. If
potential hosts are absent from the habitat, these ticks
are also able to survive for several years without feeding,
provided the microclimate of their habitat is sufficiently
suitable [30].
Our investigations also confirmed that O. porcinus
from Madagascar can be infected by ASFV since natural
infections with ASFV were detected in about 8% of tick
specimens collected from the Mahitsy farm. Since 2004
until now, the owner of this farm has abandoned pig
production since any pigs he has introduced in these pig
buildings systematically died from ASFV. Thus the
detection of infections in ticks collected in 2000 and
then in 2007 from the same pig premises without any
introduction of potentially infected pigs (the only confirmed susceptible vertebrate hosts for ASFV with wild
suids) for at least three years suggested the capacity of
long-term persistence of AFSV in Malagasy O. porcinus.
This is in agreement with previous surveys conducted
on African Ornithodoros tick vectors concerning virus
persistence in the same individuals or among tick populations through transovarial and veneral transmissions
[8,9]. For the first time, there is field evidence that O.
porcinus in Madagascar is a natural reservoir for ASFV
that most probably also acts as a competent vector.
Experimental transmission studies are needed to verify
these assumptions.
Furthermore, we were able to clarify the phylogenetic
status of O. porcinus ticks that colonise pig pens in
Madagascar. As previously suggested by Uilenberg [23],
these ticks belong to the O. p. domesticus sub-species
Walton, 1962, although they share some morphological
and genetic characteristics of the closely related O. p.
porcinus Walton, 1962. They are phylogenetically very
close to Tanzanian soft ticks that transmit Borrelia duttonii, the agent responsible for human tick-borne relapsing fever in this region [37]. This result suggests that
the same O. porcinus ticks may be able to maintain and
transmit both a human pathogen and an animal pathogen by shifting vertebrate hosts, depending on their

Page 7 of 9

availability in their habitat. This is a typical strategy of
indiscriminate host feeders to increase the amount of
potential hosts and may be interpreted as an adaptation
to their endophilous lifestyle [30].
Finally, the distribution range of O. porcinus seems to
be limited to tiny heterogeneous populations in Madagascar, since ticks were only found in one village of the
Central Highlands and seem to be absent from the Morovoay and Ambatondrazaka zones. If such a restricted
geographical range is confirmed, the epidemiological
role of O. porcinus in the persistence of ASFV in Malagasy domestic pigs may be low. These distribution patterns confirm past studies indicating the quasi
extinction of this tick since the 1950 s from the northwestern part of the country and the existence of a
remaining isolated pocket in the centre of the island
today [24,27]. However, they are not consistent with
previous serological anti-O. moubata ELISA tests conducted in 2006, which suggested the presence of
Ornithodoros ticks in the three study zones. The intrinsic specificity of this test [26,38] and its reliability for
the specific Malagasy situation with the O. porcinus species have been questioned. Our target sample size was
also not met but the maximum risk to not detect an
infested farm did not exceed 12%. In addition, our sampling effort might not have revealed tick presence if the
real proportion of infested pig pens was lower than the
expected prevalence of 30% established as the threshold
in this study. However, this threshold corresponds to
the lowest margin that has been observed in endemic
African countries and Spain [5,6]. Many interrelated factors may explain the restricted distribution of O. porcinus in Madagascar. Cool to hot temperatures from the
Marovoay and Ambatondrazaka zones are suitable for
the survival and the development of O. porcinus but the
traditional open buildings typically used for pig rearing
in these regions may not provide appropriate habitats
for endophilous and photophobic soft ticks [28,30].
Conversely, under the harsh and apparently unfavourable climatic conditions of the Central Highlands in the
Antananarivo zone, O. porcinus may survive and complete its development cycle in the traditional closed pig
buildings encountered in this region, which maintain
suitable darkness and humidity for soft ticks and buffer
external climatic variations. Locally, the frequency of pig
building disinfections using Cresyl (effective acaricide, in
addition to its antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal
properties), as mentioned by some farmers, may prevent
tick establishment. Further investigations on probable
recent climate changes in Madagascar and anthropogenic effects such as the increasing use of insecticides
for controlling plague or malaria, or the improvement of
hygiene in households should also be encouraged in
order to identify other factors that might have promoted

consistent and permanent modifications in the distribution patterns of O. porcinus in Madagascar.

Conclusions
Our examinations of Malagasy pig farms confirmed the
presence of a soft tick belonging to the O. porcinus
domesticus sub-species Walton, 1962 on the island, at
least at one site, and its natural long-term infection by
ASFV. The role of this argasid tick in virus maintenance
and probably transmission in endemic areas seems to be
relevant. However, for unknown reasons, its distribution
range in Madagascar seems to have considerably
declined over these last decades. Only small scattered
infested foci may remain, which might moderate the
role of this soft tick in the observed persistence of
ASFV in Malagasy domestic pigs since its introduction
more than ten years ago.
