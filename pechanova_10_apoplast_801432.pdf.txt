Abstract
Background: Riverine ecosystems, highly sensitive to climate change and human activities, are characterized by
rapid environmental change to fluctuating water levels and siltation, causing stress on their biological components.
We have little understanding of mechanisms by which riverine plant species have developed adaptive strategies to
cope with stress in dynamic environments while maintaining growth and development.
Results: We report that poplar (Populus spp.) has evolved a systems level “stress proteome” in the leaf-stem-root
apoplast continuum to counter biotic and abiotic factors. To obtain apoplast proteins from P. deltoides, we
developed pressure-chamber and water-displacement methods for leaves and stems, respectively. Analyses of 303
proteins and corresponding transcripts coupled with controlled experiments and bioinformatics demonstrate that
poplar depends on constitutive and inducible factors to deal with water, pathogen, and oxidative stress. However,
each apoplast possessed a unique set of proteins, indicating that response to stress is partly compartmentalized.
Apoplast proteins that are involved in glycolysis, fermentation, and catabolism of sucrose and starch appear to
enable poplar to grow normally under water stress. Pathogenesis-related proteins mediating water and pathogen
stress in apoplast were particularly abundant and effective in suppressing growth of the most prevalent poplar
pathogen Melampsora. Unexpectedly, we found diverse peroxidases that appear to be involved in stress-induced
cell wall modification in apoplast, particularly during the growing season. Poplar developed a robust antioxidative
system to buffer oxidation in stem apoplast.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that multistress response in the apoplast constitutes an important adaptive
trait for poplar to inhabit dynamic environments and is also a potential mechanism in other riverine plant species.

Background
Riverine ecosystems, characterized with rapid and dramatic environmental changes caused by fluctuating
water levels and siltation, harbor a number of plants,
including many species of the fast growing, ecological
pioneers such as perennial poplar (Populus spp.; [1-5]).
These species have a dramatic influence on ecosystem
cycles. However, we have little understanding of how
plants have adapted to such dynamic environments and

cope with a variety of continually changing biotic and
abiotic stressors while maintaining growth and
development.
Leaves, stems, and roots in plants form an integrated
physiological unit that receives stress signals and produces metabolic responses to control whole plant
growth and development. Communication within the
integrated physiological unit occurs through a continuum of symplast and apoplast [6]. Intracellular space
of the symplast is composed of cellular cytoplasm connected through plasmodesmata. Apoplast, on the other
hand, constitutes extracellular, aqueous space outside
the plasma membrane including cell walls, spaces
between cells, and xylem [6-8]. Thus, the apoplast

represents a highly dynamic compartment serving as a
continuum from roots through the stem to leaves and is
potentially important as a bridge that perceives and
transduces signals from the environment to the
symplast.
Proteins secreted into apoplast might contribute to
biotic and abiotic stress response as a first line of
defense. A variety of these proteins have been identified
in apoplast of several plants [8-20]. Such proteins predominantly represent functional categories associated with
cell wall metabolism, defense, and programmed cell
death. However, these studies have focused on annual
plants that are not native to riverine ecosystems and
have been conducted under controlled environments.
A few apoplast studies in perennial plants at the molecular level include xylem sap proteome from apple,
peach, pear, poplar, as well as identification of the leaf
apoplast antioxidative system in response to pox virus in
plum [21-24]. Although these studies provide a basic
understanding of protein composition in the apoplast of
mainly horticultural species, they are limited in scope of
the study, genomic resources (e.g., lack of whole genome
sequence), protein source of tissues, developmental
stages of trees (juvenile only), environmental conditions
(mainly artificial controlled environments), and techniques. Consequently, there is a lack of a systems level
understanding of the apoplast proteome and its function
in riverine plant species. Thus, our goal was to elucidate
a comprehensive and systems level apoplast proteome in
riverine P. deltoides under normal conditions in addition
to identifying apoplast defense mechanisms poplar has
developed to respond to water and pathogen stress,
which are among the most important stress factors in
riverine ecosystems.

Results and Discussion
Extracting protein-containing poplar apoplast fluid

Obtaining a population of representative apoplast proteins from various tissues in poplar without symplastic
contamination is technically challenging. We used a
pressure-chamber method for leaves and a water-displacement method for stems to extract protein-containing apoplast fluid. To evaluate whether leaf
apoplast extracts were contaminated with symplastic
contents, we performed the following analyses as credible indicators of contamination. First, thin sections
from pressurized and control leaves were examined
using a light microscope. No ruptured cells were
observed in the vicinity of stomata and within the vasculature (Figure 1A). Second, the 2-D PAGE protein
profiles from leaf apoplast and whole leaf tissue were
compared, and no similarity was observed in their protein patterns (Figure 1B). For example, the large subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), which

Page 2 of 22

is symplast specific [25], was abundant in whole leaf
tissues, whereas it was undetectable in the apoplast.
Third, an immuno blot analysis was conducted for
both symplast and apoplast protein samples. Using
antibodies against the symplast proteins rbcL and
malate dehydrogenase [25-27], both proteins were
detected in whole-leaf tissue extracts, but not in apoplast proteome (Figure 1C). Finally, concentrations of
macro and micro nutrients were significantly (p <
0.001) lower in leaf apoplast than in whole leaf extract
(Figures 1D and 1E), which is consistent with previous
findings [28]. We would have expected to observe
similar amounts of nutrients in symplast and apoplast
if the cell membrane had ruptured due to applied pressure. We can conclude from these observations that
the extracted apoplast proteins from poplar leaves
were devoid of symplastic contamination, confirming
previous observations that pressurization of cotton
(Gossypium hirsutum) and cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) leaves for apoplast fluid extraction did not
result in symplast contamination [28-30]. We did not
verify whether water-pressure of stems to obtain apoplast proteins caused contamination of the apoplast
content from symplast, because the applied water pressure by gravity was considerably less than the pressure
applied to leaves via pressure chamber.
Systems level protein composition of poplar apoplast

To capture the most representative apoplast proteins in
a growing season, we characterized the leaf and stem
apoplast proteomes under normal conditions during a
period (April-June) in which trees experienced active
growth, transition, cessation of primary growth, and variation in temperature, precipitation, day length, and
pathogen infestation (Figure 2A and 2B). Some of these
factors are related and likely synergistic in a natural
environment. Using both gel-based (2-D PAGE) and
gel-free (2-D LC MS/MS) proteomic approaches, we
identified 144 unique proteins in leaf apoplast (Figure
2C) and 135 unique proteins in stem apoplast (Figure
2D), totaling at 247 proteins (Figure 2E). A previously
published poplar root apoplast data (gel-based only)
contained 97 proteins [22], thus totaling the number of
unique proteins in the root-stem-leaf apoplast continuum at 303 (Figure 2F). Leaf apoplast proteins were
mainly associated with cell wall metabolism (most abundant), stress/defense, and proteolysis (Figure 2G and
additional files 1, 2 and 3: Figure S1A, and Tables S1
and S2), whereas stem apoplast proteins were mainly
associated with stress/defense (most abundant), cell wall
metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism (Figure 2H
and additional files 1, 4, and 5: Figure S1B, and Tables
S3 and S4). One major difference between the two proteomes was that a substantial portion of stem apoplast

proteome (18%), but a small portion (4%) of leaf apoplast, was associated with metabolism of carbohydrates.
The SignalP [31] and SecretomeP [32] algorithms predicted that a substantial number of apoplast proteins
(62% root, 57% stem, and 80% leaf) follow a secretory
pathway (Additional files 2, 3, 4 and 5: Tables S1-S4;
[22]), suggesting that they are secreted to the apoplast.
Staining with a specific glyco-dye revealed that 25 proteins (30% of gel-based proteins) in leaf apoplast were
glycosylated (Additional files 2 and 6: Table S1 and Figure S2A), which perhaps improves protein solubility,
enhances thermal stability in hot summers (Figure 2B),
provides protection from proteolysis, and modulates
protein-protein interactions in apoplast [33-36]. Staining
the gels with specific phospho-dye ProQ Diamond indicated that cysteine-rich repeat secretory protein 38
(POPTR_1698s00200.1) and thaumatin-like protein
(POPTR_0018s10490.1) in leaf apoplast were potentially
phosphorylated (Additional file 6: Figure S2B). This was
supported with NetPhos 2.0 [37] predictions that there
were six phosphorylation sites on thaumatin-like protein
and 12 sites on cysteine-rich repeat secretory protein 38.
These results indicate that the leaf-stem-root apoplast
continuum in poplar contains diverse proteins that
appear to be post-translationally modified and involved
in important functions such as cell wall metabolism,
stress/defense, and carbohydrate metabolism.
Apoplast-controlled response to water stress

Poplar often experiences flooding and drought stress in
riverine ecosystems [1,3,4], and our experimental trees
went through flooding and drought cycles (Figure 2B).
To determine whether apoplast is involved in mediating
water stress (flooding/hypoxia or drought) in poplar, we
identified signature proteins associated with flooding
and drought. Our leaf and previously published root
[22] data contained alcohol dehydrogenases in addition
to a number of important glycolytic enzymes in stem
and root apoplasts (Figure 3). This indicates anaerobic
respiration, and therefore some reliance of poplar on
glycolysis and ethanolic fermentation for energy
production.
Although poplar is subject to frequent oxygen deficits
(hypoxia) annually due to flooding and sedimentation,
they show tolerance with minimal effect on growth and
survival [1,3,5,38,39]. To maintain energy generation
under flooding, trees switch mitochondrial respiration to
alcoholic fermentation in roots and stems, resulting in significantly increased ethanol biosynthesis [38,40,41]. Unlike
flood-intolerant tree species, ethanol does not accumulate
in roots of flood-tolerant tree species (e.g., poplar) due to
effective transport from roots in the apoplast to leaves
where it is efficiently converted to acetyl-CoA via alcohol
dehydrogenase and used in leaf metabolism [38,40,42-46].

Page 5 of 22

Consistent with these previous studies, transcripts of alcohol dehydrogenase were abundant year-round in poplar
leaves (Figure 4, additional files 7, 8 and 9: Figures S3 and
S4B, and Table S5, black module). In contrast, alcohol
dehydrogenase gene was induced upon flooding along
with the activation of its protein in poplar roots [38,43].
Poplar leaves and roots contained different alcohol
dehydrogenases (Figure 3), which phylogenetically fall
into different clades (Additional file 10: Figure S5):
POPTR_0005s06140.1 and POPTR_0002s07290.1 in leaf
apoplast, POPTR_0008s16150.1 in root apoplast, and
POPTR_0002s07290.1 in root transcriptome upon flooding. Thus, we hypothesize that poplar has evolved alcohol
dehydrogenases optimized for ethanol biosynthesis in
roots and for ethanol catabolism in leaves.
Sucrose and starch constitute the main carbohydrate
reserves in poplar roots and stems [47], and a steady
supply of carbohydrates from these reserves and leaves
to hypoxic roots in poplar maintains alcoholic fermentation [38]. Carbohydrates appear to be effectively cycled
within the leaf-stem-root continuum via symplast and
apoplast in flood-tolerant tree species to meet the carbon demands of tissues [38,41,48]. Sucrose synthase
(POPTR_0018s07380.1), an important regulator of sink
strength in poplar [49], is present in stem apoplast (Figure 3 and 5, and additional files 2, 3, 4, 5 and 11: Tables
S1-S4 and S6), indicating sucrose hydrolysis and a
potential channeling into the glycolysis/fermentation
pathway. Invertase, which is involved in the primary
mechanism of aerobic sucrose hydrolysis, is suppressed
under flooding, while sucrose synthase is upregulated to
catabolize sucrose in poplar [38]. Supporting this view, a
constitutively expressed alpha-amylase is present in leaf
apoplast (Figure 3 and 4A, and additional file 9: Table
S5, blue module) and is perhaps involved in starch
hydrolysis after mobilization of carbohydrate storage
reserves. During flooding, flood-tolerant tree species
maintain low starch levels in leaves, but high starch
levels in roots [42,50]. Increased sucrose synthase
expression via overexpression in poplar was associated
with maintaining height growth and biomass accumulation, as well as elevated levels of cellulose synthesis (Figure 5 and additional file 11: Table S6) and deposition in
the xylem secondary cell wall, resulting in thick cell
walls and improved wood density [49]. Indeed, sucrose
synthase was among the highly expressed genes in
poplar tension wood which is cellulose enriched, suggesting sucrose synthase involvement in stress response
[51]. Anoxic rice plants [52] and hypoxic wheat roots
[53] showed a high level of sucrose synthase activity and
abundant cellulose deposition in the secondary cell walls
of wheat, which was postulated to be important for
increasing mechanical stability of roots under hypoxia.
When the amount of sucrose synthase was reduced in

(Additional file 8: Figure S4B). However, a strong relationship between flooding and ABA signaling has yet to
be established. Since flooding exerts stress, carbohydrates are also likely channeled via sucrose synthase to
cellulose biosynthesis and its deposition into xylem secondary cell walls of poplar roots and stems for
reinforcement.
Response to drought stress

As poplar displays an overall sensitivity to drought, it
has evolved ways to cope with intensities and frequencies of water limitation in riverine ecosystems during
summers [3,4]. To determine whether transcripts of
stress-related apoplast proteins respond to water stress
(drought), we applied moderate (-0.49 MPa) to severe
(-1.26 MPa) cyclical water stress to P. deltoides in a controlled environment. Transcripts of apoplast proteins

such as pathogenesis-related protein 8 (POPTR_
0012s01160.1), acidic class III chitinase (POPTR_0
015s05990.1), cationic peroxidase 1 (POPTR_0016s
14030.1), isoflavone reductase-related protein (POPTR_
0009s12090.1), and class IV chitinase (POPTR_0013s
12870.1) accumulated in leaves of poplar upon water
stress (Figure 4B and additional file 12: Table S7). Our
year-round transcript analysis showed that genes encoding for pathogenesis-related protein 8 (red module),
acidic class III chitinase (brown module), and cationic
peroxidase 1 (brown module) were activated during the
growing season (Figure 4A and additional files 7, 8 and
9: Figures S3 and S4C, and Table S5) when trees normally experienced drought (Figure 2A and 2B). These
proteins are stress/defense related and appear to be
secreted (Additional files 2, 3, 4 and 5: Tables S1-S4),
perhaps suggesting their role in poplar apoplast to
decrease the risk of pathogen and insect infestation
under drought.
Our poplar apoplast data (Figure 5 and additional files
2, 3, 4, 5 and 11: Tables S1-S4 and S6) contained ascorbate peroxidase 1 (POPTR_0009s02070.1), methionine
synthase (POPTR_0009s15490.1), mangrin/allene oxide
cyclase (POPTR_0004s10240.1), heat shock protein 70-3
(POPTR_0010s21280.1), DnaK-type molecular chaperone hsp70 (POPTR_0008s05410.1), blight associated p12
(POPTR_0018s10730.1), and Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (POPTR_0005s04590.1) that are responsive to
drought (Additional file 12: Table S7). These proteins
fall into the stress/defense functional category, except
for methionine synthase which is involved in other
metabolic processes. Heat shock proteins are considered
as molecular chaperons involved in various processes
including refolding of damaged proteins and protection
against denaturation under drought [57]. The presence
of methionine synthase and SAM synthase (Figure 3)
indicates ethylene biosynthesis in poplar stem apoplast.
Mangrin/allene oxide cyclase is involved in jasmonate
biosynthesis [58], and existence of this enzyme in poplar
root apoplast indicates the biosynthesis of jasmonate.
Ethylene and jasmonate are widely involved in signaling
biotic and abiotic stress (Figure 5 and additional file 11:
Table S6). Ethylene likely plays a role in poplar shoot
senescence (sacrifice of some of the current year’s
shoots) during hot and dry periods of low stream flow
in summer that we often observed in our experimental
P. deltoides trees. Shoot senescence is a common phenomenon in poplar [4] and perhaps reduces transpirational demand enabling the remaining shoots to
maintain a favorable water balance.
Apoplast-mediated response to biotic stress

Poplar has to cope with biotic stress, particularly the
prevalent leaf fungal rust Melampsora in riverine

Pechanova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:674
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/674

ecosystems. Melampsora infects leaves via the apoplast
[59]. To explore whether transcripts of stress-related
apoplast proteins respond to pathogen challenges, we
infected the poplar clone NM6 (P. nigra x P. maximowiczii) with Melampsora medusae f. sp. deltoidae
(Mmd) and Melampsora larici-populina (Mlp). Mmd
infection caused partial pathogen growth with macroscopic leaf necroses, whereas Mlp infection resulted in
the formation of many uredinias on the leaf epidermis
[60], suggesting that NM6 is more resistant to Mmd.
Each transcript showed a distinctive profile over time
after the infection (Figure 4C-E). The amplitude of gene
expression was much higher following the Mmd infection, indicating an active defense response resulting in
reduced fungal growth. Conversely, relatively weak or
delayed gene expression occurred following the infection
with Mlp. The difference perhaps reflects the variation
in pathogenicity and host.
Transcripts of leaf apoplast proteins such as acidic
class III chitinase, thaumatin-like protein, blight-associated protein p12, cationic peroxidase 1, and cysteinerich repeat secretory protein 38 accumulated following
Melampsora infection (Figure 4C-E). While the poplar
leaf apoplast contained three different acidic class III
chitinases (POPTR_0015s05990.1, POPTR_0014s08860.1,
POPTR_0015s06000.1), only a single chitinase (POPTR_
0015s05990.1) was detected in stem apoplast (Additional
files 2, 3, 4 and 5: Tables S1-S4). Three different class
IV chitinases (POPTR_0019s12360.1, POPTR_0013s
12870.1, and POPTR_0019s12350.1) were also detected
only in poplar leaf apoplast (Additional files 2, 3, 4 and
5: Tables S1-S4). Transcripts of acidic class III chitinase
(POPTR_0015s05990.1) increased in abundance when
poplar (P. trichocarpa x P. deltoides ’Beaupre’) was
challenged with M. larici-populina (Additional file 12:
Table S7). Moreover, transcripts encoding acidic class
III chitinase (POPTR_0015s05990.1) and PR-8
(POPTR_0012s01160.1) rapidly increased in abundance
when water stress (drought) was applied (Figure 4B and
additional file 12: Table S7), suggesting a broader role of
these proteins in stress response.
Chitinases and b-1,3-glucanases (POPTR_0016s05800.1,
POPTR_0001s26210.1, POPTR_0006s04670.1, POPTR_0
001s26210.1) were found together in poplar leaf and stem
apoplast (Additional files 2, 3, 4 and 5: Tables S1-S4) and
other plant species [11,14,15,17,21,24]. Chitinases are
often co-induced with antifungal b-glucanases (PR-2 proteins), acting synergistically to limit fungal growth via
degrading chitin and glucan of fungal cell walls [61-64].
These PR proteins likely mediate defense responses via
activation of a signaling pathway through released elicitors
from fungal cell walls into apoplast [65-68]. Furthermore,
chitinases and b-glucanases appear to act synergistically
with thaumatin-like proteins that can bind to b-1,3-

Page 9 of 22

glucans for hydrolysis [69,70]. The poplar thaumatin-like
protein (POPTR_0018s10490.1) was present in two abundant isoforms in only leaf apoplast (spots 87 and 88; additional files 1 and 2: Figure S1A and Table S1). Genes of
these thaumatin-like proteins were activated in response
to infection of poplar leaves with Mlp (Additional file 12:
Table S7). While transcripts of blight-associated protein
p12 (POPTR_0006s19310.1) were activated by Melampsora infection (Figure 4C-E and additional file 12: Table
S7), another poplar apoplast blight-associated protein p12
(POPTR_0018s10730.1) was upregulated by drought
(Additional file 12: Table S7), suggesting that both family
members are involved in stress response. Transcripts of
these poplar apoplast proteins along with pathogenesisrelated protein 8 (POPTR_0012s01160.1), hevamine
(POPTR_0015s05980.1, a chitinase; [71]), and NtPRp27
(POPTR_0001s30680.1, POPTR_0009s09750.1) were
abundant during the growing season and showed similar
expression patterns (Figure 4A, additional files 7, 8 and 9:
Figures S3, S4 D and S4E, and Table S5, red, brown, or
green module), indicating co-regulation by water stress
and pathogens. Some of these proteins and their homologs
(e.g., chitinase and b-glucanase) in plants were regulated
by ethylene (Figure 5 and additional file 11: Table S6;
[13,67,72,73]) whose biosynthesis likely occurs in poplar
apoplast (Figure 3). Thus, we postulate that poplar has
developed an apoplast defense mechanism against pathogens by activating pathogenesis-related proteins under
abiotic stress in riverine ecosystems.
Cell wall modification in apoplast

As plant cell walls are modified in response to stress
[74], we determined the extent to which apoplast proteins are involved in stress-induced cell wall modification in poplar. Eighteen different peroxidases (POX)
were detected in poplar root, stem, and leaf apoplast,
and virtually all of them were predicted to be extracellular (Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 13: Figure S1,
Tables S1-S4, and Figure S6; [22]), indicating an abundant and diverse presence of peroxidases in the poplar
apoplast. The poplar leaf apoplast POX gene
(POPTR_0016s14030.1) was up-regulated in response
to water stress (Figure 4B) and Melampsora infection
(Figure 4C-E), implying a broader role in defense.
The poplar leaf apoplast peroxidases (POPTR_0016s
14030.1, POPTR_0014s14000.1) closely clustered
(Additional file 13: Figure S6) with defense-related peroxidases POX8.1, POX22.3, POC1, pod2, pod4, PO2,
POD1, and swpb4 [75-79]. Cationic peroxidase POC1
accumulated in the apoplast and cell walls of xylem
vessels where it was involved in pathogen-induced lignification [80-82]. Lignin deposition in leaf cell walls
was observed at infected sites following the interaction
between Melampsora and poplar [59]. Moreover,

Pechanova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:674
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/674

transcripts of POPTR_0016s14030.1 and POPTR_
0014s14000.1 showed a similar expression pattern and
were only abundant during the growing season in
poplar leaves (Figure 4A, additional files 7, 8 and 9:
Figures S3 and S4C, and Table S5, brown module).
These two peroxidases are likely involved in stressinduced lignification during the growing season in
poplar leaf apoplast. Their role in defense may include
reinforcement of cell walls to restrict pathogen invasion via oxidative cross-linking of monolignols, polysaccharides, and proteins such as proline-rich
glycoprotein present in the poplar apoplast (POPTR_
0006s18230.1; additional file 2: Table S1).
The majority of the stem apoplast peroxidases
(POPTR_0005s14190.1, POPTR_0003s21640.1, POPTR_
0003s21620.1, POPTR_0003s21610.1, POPTR_0001s
05050.1, POPTR_0001s04850.1, and POPTR_0003s
21660.1) that are all anionic (pI < 7) clustered together
in the phylogenetic tree (Additional file 13: Figure S6).
Some of these peroxidases in the same cluster were also
detected in leaves (POPTR_0005s14190.1, POPTR_
0001s05050.1, and POPTR_0003s21660.1) along with
two leaf-specific (POPTR_0007s05100.1 and POPTR_
0016s05860.1) or root-specific proteins (POPTR_0005s
14190.1 and POPTR_0003s21660.1). Transcripts of four
peroxidases (POPTR_0003s21660.1, POPTR_0149s
00200.1, POPTR_0005s14190.1, and POPTR_0007s
05100.1) showed year-round expression (Figure 4A,
additional files 7 and 9: Figure S3 and Table S5,
pink and yellow modules). Melampsora infection
induced transcription of one particular peroxidase
(POPTR_0001s04850.1) in poplar (Additional file 12:
Table S7). The related peroxidases PO3, prxA3a, and
PXP3-4 in poplar have been proposed to serve as key
enzymes for lignifications [59,83-91]. Other poplar peroxidases in the same cluster (PO1 and PO2) are suberization-specific [90], and wound-inducible peroxidases
are involved in suberization to help tissue healing [92].
Thus, we anticipate that these apoplast peroxidases are
involved in lignification and suberization in poplar
stems.
Four poplar apoplast peroxidases (POPTR_0015s
00580.1, POPTR_0017s06550.2, POPTR_0007s02580.1,
and POPTR_0004s14240.1) closely clustered (Additional
file 13: Figure S6) with a poplar peroxidase (CWPO-C)
that is proposed to play a role in lignification [88,89].
CWPO-C, whose transcripts are constitutively expressed
in the developing leaf and shoot xylem, oxidizes sinapyl
alcohol, a component of poplar lignin along with coniferyl alcohol. Transcripts of three peroxidases
(POPTR_0017s06550.2, POPTR_0007s02580.1, and
POPTR_0004s14240.1) were expressed during leaf development (Figure 4A, additional files 7 and 9: Figure S3
and Table S5, turquoise and yellow modules). One

Page 10 of 22

peroxidase (POPTR_0007s02580.1; 718485) appears to
be responsive to drought and pathogens, as well as
auxin and abscisic acid (Figure 5 and additional file 11:
Table S6). As this particular peroxidase is an important
hub, we predict that it plays an important role in mediating biotic and abiotic stress in poplar. Consequently,
these four poplar apoplast peroxidases are probably
involved in lignin polymerization in the apoplast of
developing roots, leaves, or stems. Taken together, these
observations indicate that poplar possesses a large number of peroxidases in the root-stem-leaf apoplast continuum to modify cell wall structure in response to stress.
Antioxidative capacity of poplar apoplast

Metabolic reactions, stress-induced processes, and oxygen presence are expected to produce reactive oxygen
species (ROS) such as superoxides and H 2 O 2 in apoplast. Actively lignifying xylem tissues, particularly in
stems during the growing season, sustain H2O2 production for cross-linking of lignin precursors by peroxidase
involvement, increasing the apoplast oxidative load
[83,93-96]. ROS were also increased in response to
pathogen attack, leading not only to enhanced signal
circulation that activates downstream antimicrobial proteins and phenolic compounds, but also to peroxidasedependent cell-wall lignification, preventing pathogen
penetration [97-101]. However, we do not have an
understanding of how poplar counters oxidative stress
in the apoplast.
Superoxide dismutase (POPTR_0011s01280.1,
POPTR_0005s04590.1, and POPTR_0013s03160.1),
ascorbate peroxidase (POPTR_0009s02070.1 and
POPTR_0016s08580.1), monodehydroascorbate reductase (POPTR_0006s11570.1), and peroxiredoxin
(POPTR_0019s04070.1) were present in poplar stem
apoplast (Figure 5 and additional files 2, 3, 4, 5 and 11:
Tables S1-S4 and S6). Two superoxide dismutases
(POPTR_0011s01280.1 and POPTR_0005s04590.1) were
the only antioxidant enzymes present in leaf apoplast
(Additional files 2 and 3: Tables S1 and S2). Transcripts
of one superoxide dismutase (POPTR_0005s04590.1)
showed a year-round expression in leaves (Figure 4A,
additional files 7 and 9: Figure S3 and Table S5, yellow
module). These specialized antioxidant enzymes and
low-molecular weight antioxidants such as ascorbate
and glutathione are particularly involved in buffering
oxidation [101-104]. Although none of these enzymes
were detected in the poplar root apoplast [22], thioredoxin (POPTR_0005s25420.1) in the root apoplast
might play a role in the regeneration of peroxiredoxin
[105].
We anticipate that superoxide dismutase in poplar apoplast reduces superoxide ions into H 2O2 which is then
reduced to H 2 O by ascorbate peroxidase [96,106,107].

Pechanova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:674
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/674

One of the superoxide dismutases (POPTR_0005s04590.1)
was responsive to drought in poplar [108], while the other
one (POPTR_0013s03160.1) was responsive to Melampsora (Additional file 12: Table S7). Knockdown of an
extracellular high-isoelectric-point superoxide dismutase
in poplar accelerated maturation, ROS accumulation, and
lignification in the secondary cell walls with a number of
developmental disturbances such as reduced growth, thinner stems, smaller leaves, and shorter and thinner xylem
fibers and vessels [109], indicating the importance of
superoxide dismutases in stress response and plant development. The presence of monodehydroascorbate reductase in the poplar apoplast indicates the regeneration of
ascorbate for continuous removal of H2O2. Other antioxidant enzymes detected in stem apoplast include glyoxalase
I (POPTR_0009s01280.1; additional file 4: Table S3) that
removes methylglyoxal, a toxic by product of carbohydrate
and amino acid metabolism [110,111], and glutathione Stransferase (POPTR_0483s00220.1 and POPTR_0002s
20890.1; Figure 5 and additional files 4 and 11: Tables S3
and S6) that detoxifies xenobiotic compounds [112-114].
These observations suggest poplar has a robust apoplast
antioxidative system.

Conclusions
Our study shows that poplar has developed a diverse
apoplast proteome in the leaf-stem-root continuum.
Such a complex proteome appears to play a major role
in mediating water, pathogen, and oxidative stress, suggesting that a systems level mechanism has evolved in
poplar apoplast allowing encounters of multiple stresses
while maintaining growth and development over many
years. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for
developing a systems level understanding of how the
extracellular matrix mediates multistress responses in
plant species of riverine ecosystems under fluctuating
environmental conditions.
Methods
Apoplast fluid extraction

All sampled Populus deltoides trees were naturally growing along Sand Creek within the Tombigbee River system MS, USA (33° 27’ 45” N; 88° 49’ 12” W), for which
weather data have been regularly collected and archived
by Mississippi State University http://ext.msstate.edu/
anr/drec/weather.cgi. Three sexually mature male trees
(15, 25, and 30 years old) were selected for leaf apoplast
analysis. We used a bucket truck with a hydraulic
extending and elevating winch to reach the upper crown
of ~25-m-tall trees. For stem apoplast analysis, twenty
different male and female sexually immature trees with
ages ranging from 3 to 6 years old were sampled. For
leaves, a pressure chamber (Soilmoisture Equipment,
Santa Barbara, CA) was used to extract apoplast fluid.

Page 11 of 22

The instrument contained a pressure-safe vessel
attached to a pressure gauge. Current-year shoots with
expanding and fully-expanded leaves (Figure 2A) were
sampled separately from each tree in May-June, 2007.
Shoots from each tree were collected between 8:00 AM
and 9:00 AM daily (except weekends) and kept on ice.
This fixed sampling time took into account that apoplast proteins and their corresponding transcripts might
show circadian variation as many genes do in Arabidopsis thaliana [115]. In the laboratory, individual leaves
were cut at the base of petiole, and cut surfaces were
rinsed with sterile water. The leaf lamina was then
placed into the pressure chamber with the petiole protruding outside. Using an ultra high purity compressed
nitrogen gas, pressure was slowly increased within the
chamber to 300 psi (2 MPa) at which apoplastic fluid
started to exude. Pressure below 300 psi did not produce any extract. Exuding apoplast fluid was collected
for one minute into a sterile tube that was placed on ice
and contained 500 μl of cold two-times concentrated
protein extraction buffer (1.8 M sucrose, 1 M Tris-base,
0.1 M Na2-EDTA, 0.2 M KCl, 4% b-mercaptoethanol,
pH 8.7). The first drop of the extract was discarded to
avoid contamination from broken cells at the cut site.
Each tube was filled with 500 μl of apoplast fluid to
make the final volume 1 ml. 100-200 μl of apoplastic
fluid were extracted from each leaf. Collected extracts
were immediately subjected to protein extraction. Three
replications of apoplast fluid per tree were obtained in
tubes for gel-based and gel-free protein analyses. Multiple tubes within a replication were pooled during protein extraction.
For stems, a water-replacement method was used to
extract apoplast fluid. Stems of size 40-90 cm in length
and 1-4 cm in diameter were collected between 8:00
and 9:00 AM in April-June, 2007 and kept on ice. In the
laboratory, short sections (2.0-2.5 cm) of the bark at
both stem ends were removed. The stem ends were
then rinsed with deionized water. Plastic tubing was
attached to the upper stem end over the exposed tissue
and sealed with Parafilm to avoid leakage. The bark at
the site of cut of the lower end of the stem was tightly
wrapped with Parafilm to avoid contamination from
phloem. Stems were positioned vertically, and deinonized water was applied to the tubing attached to the
upper stem end. Exudate flowing from the bottom end
was collected into sterile tubes placed on ice for several
minutes. The first drop was discarded. Depending on
the stem size, 1-5 ml of apoplast fluid mixed with water
was collected from an individual stem. Apoplast fluid
was filtered with sterile 0.2 μm syringe filters (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) to remove particulate matter,
pooled, and either frozen at -80°C or immediately used
for protein extraction. Three replications of apoplast

Pechanova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:674
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/674

fluid from all the stems were obtained in tubes. Pooled
sap was concentrated on Amicon Centriplus YM-3 filters (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) to 1/30 of
original volume. Proteins were precipitated by adding
four parts of 12.5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.1% b-mercaptoethanol in 100% acetone [116]. Precipitation was
carried out at -80°C overnight. Proteins were sedimented by centrifugation at 6,000× g for 10 min, and the
pellet was washed three times with ice-cold 80% acetone
and once with 100% acetone and stored at -80°C.
Protein extraction and gel-based protein analysis

Total proteins were extracted from apoplast fluid using
a phenol-based procedure with modifications [117]. For
each replication of protein extraction, apoplast fluid
from five tubes was pooled, and five milliliters of Trissaturated phenol (pH 8.0) were added. After 10 min of
shaking, homogenate was centrifuged at 6,000× g for 20
min, and the phenol phase was carefully removed. Proteins were precipitated from phenol phase using five
volumes of precipitation solution (0.1 M ammonium
acetate and 1% b-mercaptoethanol in methanol). Precipitation was carried out overnight at -70°C. Precipitated
proteins were collected by centrifugation at 6,000× g for
10 min and washed three times with cold precipitation
solution and three times with cold 80% acetone. Each
wash was followed by centrifugation at 6,000× g for 5
min. Following the last acetone wash, protein pellets
were air-dried and stored at -20°C. Approximately 25-30
leaves were used to obtain 2.5 ml of apoplast fluid,
which produced 200-250 μg of protein. The same protocol was used for extracting total proteins from whole
leaves, except that two additional extractions of proteins
from the phenol phase were carried out in order to
remove interfering substances richly present in leaf
tissue.
For resolving leaf apoplast proteins, two-dimensional
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) was
employed as previously described [118]. Protein spots
were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant
Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Gels were scanned
with VersaDoc 3000 imager (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with
PDQuest (Bio-Rad). Three replications of 2-D gels were
performed per tree, totaling nine gels. The landmark
semi-automatic method was used to create a match set
using all nine 2-D images, and the resulting master
image was used for annotation of spots. Correct matching of all spots was manually inspected. The master
image included protein spots present in all three poplar
trees as well as spots that were present in at least two
replications of gels per tree. Reproducible protein spots
were subjected to downstream proteomic analyses.
For resolving stem apoplast proteins, the leaf apoplast
protein procedure was followed. However, the amount

Page 12 of 22

of proteins (570 μg) was only sufficient for a large format 2-D gel (14 cm × 18 cm × 1.5 mm). Proteins were
therefore visualized by Deep Purple Total Protein Stain
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The gel was
scanned using the Typhoon 9410 imager (Amersham
Biosciences).
For protein spot picking, in-gel digestion, and MS/MS,
we followed a previous procedure [118], except that protein identification was conducted by searching against
the poplar database http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1_1/
Poptr1_1.home.html. We were unable to identify three
abundant protein spots in leaf apoplast (83, 87, and 88).
Thus, we had to have N-terminal sequencing conducted
by Cambridge Peptides [http://www.cambridgepeptides.
com; additional file 14: Table S8]. The sequences were
then searched against the poplar protein database using
BLASTP, and the best matching similar protein was
considered as the corresponding protein. The N-terminus sequence AGIAIYWGQNNN (spot 83) was present
in two poplar proteins (POPTR_0015s05990.1 and
POPTR_0012s01160.1). Thus, both proteins had to be
included in our data set.
Gel-free protein analysis

Two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (2-D LC ESI/MS/MS) was used to analyze
apoplast protein mixtures from leaves and stems. Frozen
protein pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate and 4 M urea (Fraction 1). The
remaining un-dissolved proteins were further dissolved
in 50 μl of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate and 8 M urea
(Fraction 2). Protein concentration was determined
using 2-D Quant Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots
of 200 μg of proteins were subjected to in-solution
digestion. First, proteins were reduced by adding 1/10
volume of 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubating
for 1 h at room temperature. Alkylation was performed
by adding 1/10 volume of 100 mM iodoacetamide and
incubating for 30 min at 30°C in the dark. Before digestion, both protein samples (Fraction 1 and 2) were
diluted (4X and 8X, respectively) with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate to reduce urea concentration. HPLCgrade acetonitrile was added to each sample for a final
concentration of 5%. Sequencing-grade modified trypsin
(Promega, Madison, WI) was then applied to a final substrate/trypsin ratio of 50:1. Digestion was carried out at
37°C for 12-16 hours.
The peptide mixture was acidified with concentrated
acetic acid and desalted with a peptide macro-trap
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Michron BioResources, Auburn, CA). Peptides were lyophilized with a
SpeedVac (LABCONCO, model LYPH-LOCK 6, Kansas
City, MO) and stored at -80°C. Immediately before mass
spectrometry, the peptides were resuspended in 20 μl of

Pechanova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:674
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/674

0.1% formic acid and 5% acetonitrile. Four replications of
samples (both containing Fraction 1 and Fraction 2) were
analyzed.
Following a previous procedure [119] with a slight
modification, 2-D LC ESI/MS/MS was performed using
ProteomeX Workstation (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose,
CA) that included the Surveyor auto sampler and the
Surveyor HPLC unit coupled directly in-line with LCQ
Deca XP Plus - Electro Spray Ionization (ESI) ion trap
mass spectrometer capable of MS/MS (in time) analysis.
For the first dimension, peptides were separated on a
strong cation exchange (SCX) BioBasic column (0.32
mm × 100 mm) (ThermoElectron, San Jose, CA). The
following five-steps were used to elute peptides from
SCX column: 0, 10, 23, 37, and 700 mM ammonium
acetate (all in 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid). For
the second dimension, peptides were loaded directly
onto BioBasic C18 reverse phase column (100 mm ×
0.18 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid and 5%
acetonitrile. The following acetonitrile gradient in 0.1%
formic acid was applied to elute the peptides: 5-10% for
1 min, 10-30% for 19 min, 95% for 7 min, 5% for 10
min. Total elution and spectra collection time was 37
min. The mass spectrometer Data Dependent method
including dynamic exclusion was designed to have four
scan events: one MS scan (m/z range: 300-1700) and
three MS/MS scans of three most intense ions detected
in MS scan. Collected spectra were processed with BioWorks 3.1 SR1 software (ThermoFinnigan). TurboSequest was used for protein identification by matching
the experimental masses of parent and fragmented ions/
peptides to those in the poplar protein database. The
search parameters were that 1] peptide mass tolerance
(precursor ion) was set at 1.4 amu, 2] two internal cleavage sites were allowed for trypsin, and 3] group Scan
was set at 7, minimum Group Count at 1, and minimum Ion Count at 15. Charge State and MSn level were
set as Auto (peptide, 2.50; fragment ions, 0.00; ion series, B and Y). The following modifications were considered: C = 57.05 (differential) for carbamidomethylation
of cysteins by iodoacetamide and M = 32.0 (differential)
for oxidation of methionines. All accepted peptides had
to be fully tryptic, had a ΔCn ≥ 0.08, and had the minimum cross correlation (Xcorr) value of 1.9 (+1 charge),
2.2 (+2 charge), and 3.75 (+3 charge). We only considered hits with at least one unique peptide as positive
identifications. Single peptide identifications were
accepted only if the peptide was a unique identifier and
had occurred in all four replications of protein samples.
Protein identification and sequence informatics

Sequences of matched/identified poplar proteins
were further used in BLAST searches against UniProt
Knowledgebase http://www.uniprot.org or the NCBI

Page 13 of 22

non-redundant database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
blast using the BLOSUM62 algorithm. An E-value cutoff of 1.0 × e -5 was used to find similar proteins in
other plant species. A similar protein with the highest
degree of sequence similarity was considered as the protein identity/similarity. If several poplar proteins
matched to the same gel spot and their sequences produced the same BLASTP output (e.g., the same best
matching similar protein, but with a different degree of
sequence similarity to poplar protein), we only considered the hit with the highest Mascot score, which was
always the 1st rank hit. Identified poplar proteins were
assigned putative biological function based on Gene
Ontology Annotation [120] of their most similar proteins from other species or based on literature. For easy
interpretation, the annotated proteins were then clustered into general biological categories that were identified based on common terminology used in literature.
Poplar protein sequences were also screened for the presence of signal peptides using SignalP [31,121] and for
non-classical signal peptide using SecretomeP [32].
Phosphorylation sites on proteins were predicted using
NetPhos 2.0 [37]. Protein identifications were submitted
to the Protein Identifications (PRIDE) database, accession numbers 14841-14844.
Determining post-translational modifications

Five hundred micrograms of leaf apoplast proteins from
one of the sexually mature P. deltoides trees were separated by 2-D PAGE as described above. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Pro-Q Diamond and
Pro-Q Emerald 488 to detect phosphorylated and glycosylated proteins, respectively. In both cases, manufacturer’s (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) staining
protocols were followed, and gels were scanned using
the Typhoon 9410 imager. Gels were subsequently poststained with SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad,
CA) for visualizing total proteins and re-scanned with
the Typhoon 9410 imager.
Microarray experiments

To determine year-round gene expression patterns corresponding to leaf apoplast proteins throughout leaf
development, three independent replications of leaf tissues at each collection period were sampled from the
upper crown of one of the sexually mature P. deltoides
trees 2 h after sunrise and kept on ice. We used one
genotype to have a uniform data set, because gene
expression often significantly varies among poplar genotypes. We confirmed the results of our microarray
experiments via qRT-PCR using two other sexually
mature P. deltoides trees. Tissue collections were conducted in September 2005, December 2005, February
2005, March 2005, March 2006, April 2006, May 2006,

Pechanova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:674
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/674

and June 2006, spanning the development of leaves and
four seasons, as well as overlapping with the timing of
sample collection for apoplast proteome analysis. Leaves
were preformed and enclosed in terminal vegetative
buds in September, December, February, and March
(Figure 2A; [122]). Leaves began unfolding from terminal buds late March, and this process continued by late
May when leaves became fully expanded and mature
(Figure 2A). Thus, we reorganized the samples based on
leaf development, beginning with September and ending
with June. We conducted array experiments in two 12chip sets. The first set included September 05, December 05, February 05, and March 05, whereas the second
set consisted of March 06, April 06, May 06, and June
06. Thus, the March samples (6 independent sampling)
provided an overlap between the two sets. We used the
poplar arrays from the same batch, and followed the
same protocol executed by the same person.
Total RNA was isolated using a hot-borate extraction
method [123], followed by DNase I digestion and cleanup using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A
total of 3 μg of total RNA from each sample was used
to synthesize the double-strand cDNA using the Onecycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
After cleaning-up the double-strand cDNA using the
Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA),
the biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized from the double-strand cDNA via in vitro transcription using the
Genechip IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix). cRNA (20 μg)
was fragmented at 94°C for 35 minutes. Fifteen micrograms of the fragmented cRNA were used to hybridize
each Genechip Poplar Genome Array (Affymetrix) in
Genechip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) at 45°C
for 16 hr. The arrays were washed using the Genechip
Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) and then scanned
using the Genechip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). Microarray data were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) GSE24349.
Quality control (QC) assessment, data processing, and
statistical analysis of array data were conducted in R
[124] using packages from the Bioconductor project
[125]. QC assessment using affycoretools [126] showed
that a block effect existed between the first set of samples (September, December, February, and March) and
the second set of samples (March, April, May, and June)
even after processing the arrays with the GCRMA algorithm [127]. In addition to background-correction and
summarizing the multiple probes into one probe set
value, GCRMA does a quantile normalization between
arrays, but no normalization method can completely
remove some block effects. In these cases, the block
effect must also be accounted for in a statistical model.
A one-way ANOVA for time was performed, taking the

Page 14 of 22

correlation due to block into account, using the limma
package [128]. The limma model was fit using all 61,413
probe-sets on the array because it uses an empirical
Bayes correction [129] that helps to improve power by
borrowing information across genes. Expression values
for each time point (adjusted for batch effects) were
pulled for the model for the 139 probe sets matched to
our leaf apoplast proteins of interest (see below).
Expression patterns over time were represented as the
log2 fold-change of each time point to the baseline time
point (September), and hierarchical clustering was performed on the 139 probe sets corresponding to 139 leaf
apoplast proteins. To determine which of these clusters
represented co-expressed modules, we used the
“Dynamic Hybrid” algorithm from the dynamicTreeCut
package [130]. A total of nine modules were found with
deepSplit = 2. However, two of the modules had extremely similar expression patterns and were merged into
one module (yellow, Figure 4A).
Matching proteins to microarray probe sets

Affymetrix’s poplar genome array contains over 61,000
probe sets that were designed from UniGene Build #6
(March 16, 2005; Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides
only), GenBank® mRNAs and ESTs (April 26, 2005; all
Populus species), and the predicted gene set v1.1 from
the Populus genome project (May 4, 2005; P. trichocarpa). The annotation information for the probe sets
provided by Affymetrix is primarily based on UniGene
and GenBank IDs, not DOE Joint Genome Institute’s
gene model names or protein/transcript IDs, because
probe sets are based on the sequence data available at
the time. However, our knowledge of which sequences
actually uniquely represent a particular gene and which
sequences may be common to related genes (i.e., annotation) is constantly changing. Therefore, there can be
complex, many-to-many relationships between probe
sets and Gene Models.
To find the “best” probe set on the array for each of
our 144 proteins of interest from leaf apoplast, we used
two other annotation sources: the PopARRAY database
http://aspendb.uga.edu/poparray; February 4, 2009] and
a custom annotation of the Affymetrix poplar array
kindly provided by K-H. Han and J-H. Ko at Michigan
State University (January 9, 2009). Using both sources, a
total of 253 probe sets mapped to our 144 leaf apoplast
proteins. We additionally used the PopARRAY database
to reverse map the 253 probe sets to poplar gene models, and 212 mapped to only one gene model. We refer
to these 212 as “unique-hit” probe sets whereas the
other 41 are “multi-hit” probe sets. We used the following criteria to select one “best” probe set for each of our
proteins. If one unique-hit probe set was found in both
sources, we used it. If more than one unique-hit probe

Pechanova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:674
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/674

set was found in both sources, we used one with the
lowest raw p-value from the ANOVA model. If no
unique-hit probe set was found in both sources, we
used the source that had a unique-hit probe set. If more
than one unique-hit probe set in that source, we used
the one with the lowest raw p-value from the ANOVA
model. If no unique-hit probe sets were found in either
source, we used multi-hit probe sets following the same
criteria. Using these criteria, we were able to find
unique-hit probe sets for 118 proteins, multi-hit probe
sets for 21 proteins, and no matching probe sets for 5
proteins.
Validation of microarray results

Validation of randomly selected seven genes in the
microarray data was conducted via qRT-PCR using
leaves from two other sexually mature P. deltoides trees
(Tree 1 and Tree 2). Three replications of leaf tissues at
each collection were sampled monthly from March to
October 2 h after sunrise. Total RNA was isolated as
previously described, and the first-strand cDNA was
synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA in a total of 20-μl
reaction mixture as described by Hsu et al [131]. qRTPCR was conducted using the Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix Kit (ABI, Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) and the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (ABI,
Applied Biosystems) with a run mode of “Standard
7500”. Gene specific primers (Additional file 15: Table
S9) were designed according to available sequences from
the poplar database http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1_1/
Poptr1_1.home.html. Since we used the primers on P.
deltoides cDNA, the amplicons were sequenced and a
BLAST analysis was conducted against the poplar genome database to confirm the gene IDs. The P. deltoides
UBIQUITIN (UBQ) transcript was used as an internal
standard. Each qRT-PCR reaction mixture contained 0.5
μl of cDNA template, 5 μl of SYBR Green Mix, 0.25 μl
of 10 μM forward primer, 0.25 μl of 10 μM reverse primer, and 4 μl of ddH2O. The PCR was programmed to
run an initial incubation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by
95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min for a total of 40
cycles. A dissociation curve analysis was conducted after
each run to verify the specificity of amplicon and the
formation of primer-dimers. A standard curve was generated by log [cDNA] (represented by the amount of
total RNA used in the real-time reaction) versus the
crossing point value using a series of dilutions of the
first-strand cDNA. The ratio between the expression
levels of each transcript and UBQ for each sample was
calculated using the relative quantitative analysis method
based on a formula for the standard curve assay. Each
assay was repeated at least three times. Then, these
expression data were compared with those first elucidated from our microarray analysis. Linear regression

Page 15 of 22

was used in which the qRT-PCR ratios (amount of target gene/amount of UBIQUITIN) were used as predictors of normalized microarray intensity values
(transformed with log2) for each respective gene. This
analysis was performed separately for Tree 1 and Tree 2.
Water stress experiments and transcript analysis

P. deltoides ’WV94’ plantlets were transferred from tissue culture in November 2006 to leach tubes containing
peat, vermiculite, and perlite in a 2:2:1 ratio, and initially
fertilized with Osmocote, bone meal, gypsum, and dolomite at 12, 4, 4, and 0.5 ml/L, respectively. The transplants were grown in a mist bed for two weeks, and
then transferred to greenhouse (26/21°C day/night) with
a photoperiod of 14-16 h. After 12 weeks, plants were
transplanted to 3.8 L containers using the same potting
media, and placed in greenhouses (19°C/day with no
supplemental lighting). Plants were fertilized with Peter’s
20-20-20 at 300 ppm per month. Plants were grown
until they reached an average height of 81.1 cm. A total
of 20 plants were used for the cyclical water stress
(drought) experiment, which commenced on 4/13/2007
and concluded on 5/14/2007. Water stress included 4
cycles in which water was withheld from plants for a
period, and then watering was resumed. 10 plants were
sampled after two cycles of drought, and 10 were
sampled after 4 cycles of drought. Of the 10 plants, four
were controls and six were water stressed. A completely
randomized design was used in greenhouse. Pre-dawn
water potential measurements were taken each night.
During cycles 1 and 3, plants were watered again after
water potential measurements indicated that plants were
experiencing moderate water stress (< 0.05-1.0 MPa).
During cycles 2 and 4, partially-expanded leaves were
sampled when the water potential measurements indicated that the plants, on average, were under a moderate level of water stress. Water was then withheld from
the plants until water potential measurements indicated
that the plants were under severe water stress (< 1.0
MPa). Partially-expanded leaves were collected from
each plant, and watering was resumed. The total number of samples collected after 4 cycles was 32 (4 control
samples, 6 moderately-stressed samples, and 6 severelystressed samples per cycle, i.e., cycle 2 and 4).
Total RNA was extracted from 32 partially expanded
leaf samples, using the Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit
(Sigma). An on-column DNase I treatment (Sigma) was
conducted during the RNA extraction according to the
provided protocol. cDNA synthesis was conducted using
a SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for
qRT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided. One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA
synthesis in a 20-μl reaction mixture. After cDNA
synthesis, all cycle 2 control plants were pooled, all

Pechanova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:674
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/674

cycle 2 moderately-stressed samples were pooled, and all
cycle 2 severely-stressed samples were pooled. The same
was also done with the cycle 4 samples, resulting in a
total of six samples for real-time qRT-PCR.
Following the selection of genes of interest based on
the annotation of stress-related pathways from leaf apoplast proteome, qRT-PCR was used to compare the
expression of 16 genes across the six samples. Amplification reactions (25.0 μl) were carried out using iQ ™

SYBR® Green Supermix according to instructions provided by Bio-Rad Laboratories. Each reaction contained
a cDNA template (1.0 μl), SYBR ® Green supermix
(12.5 μl), sterile water (8.5 μl), and the appropriate forward and reverse 5 μM primer pair (1.5 μl each). An
actin gene (ACT) expressed at a constant rate across tissue types was used as a control to normalize the data
for differences in input RNA and efficiency of reverse
transcription between the samples. PCR amplification
reactions were performed in triplicate. The thermal
cycling conditions took place on the StepOne™ Plus Real
Time PCR detection system (Applied Biosystems) and
included 3 minutes at 95°C, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15
seconds, 55°C for 20 seconds and 72°C for 20 seconds,
1 minute at 95°C, 80 cycles at 55°C for 10 seconds with
the temperature increasing by 0.5°C after each cycle and
then a hold at 4°C until plates were removed from the
machine. The forward and reverse primers that were
used to detect gene expression are shown in additional
file 15: Table S9.
Data analysis was carried out using StepOne™ Software
(Applied Biosystems). Cycle threshold values that were
flagged because they did not meet default QC requirements were removed from the analysis. Relative gene
expression, or fold-change, was calculated for each gene
with the cycle control sample used as the reference
sample. Therefore, gene expression in the control always
equaled 1. Values greater than 1 represent up-regulation,
and values less than 1 represent down-regulation. Fold
change minimum and maximum calculations were based
on one standard deviation.
Pathogen challenge experiments and transcript analysis

Individual trees of the hybrid poplar clone NM6 (Populus nigra X Populus maximowiczii) were initially
obtained from in vitro grown plantlets and then transferred to a growth chamber with the following environmental conditions: 26°C/22°C day/night, 16-h day, 60%
relative humidity, and 100 μmol m-2 s-1 light intensity.
Plants were fertilized every other week with 20:20:20 N:
P: K (1 g/L). Leaves LPI 8 and LPI 9 (leaf plastochron
index, [132]) were used for all experiments from 1 m
tall poplar trees (16 fully expanded leaves). Inoculation

Page 16 of 22

of leaf discs with Melampsora was conducted as
previously described [133]. Briefly, disks of 2 cm in
diameter were inoculated on the abaxial side with
M. medusae f. sp. deltoidae or M. laricipopulina at a
density of 1,000-3,000 spores (in 0.01% Tween) per cm2.
After inoculation, the disks were kept on wet paper in
large Parafilm sealed Petri dishes (22 cm × 22 cm) and
incubated in a growth chamber at 18°C with a long
photoperiod. Control disks were sprayed with Tween
0.01%. Samples for pathogen quantification and transcript analysis were collected at different time points
over 10 days after inoculation. Tissues were collected
from four biological replicate trees and processed separately for each treatment and time point.
Leaf disks were taken at specified intervals and frozen
in liquid nitrogen. 100 mg of ground leaf-disk powder
were used for either DNA or RNA extractions. Total
genomic DNA preparation was performed by using the
Plant DNeasy Kit (QIAGEN) following manufacturer
instructions. Pathogen growth was quantified as
described previously [133]. Amplifications were performed using a Stratagene Mx3000p apparatus (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and 1× QuantiTect
SYBR® Green mixture (Qiagen).
RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit by following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was treated
with a DNase I, and complementary DNA was synthesized from the RNA samples (500 ng) for single strand
conversion to cDNA using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, SuperScript™ II) and oligo-dT primers. Resulting
samples were not treated with RNase H, and cDNAs
were diluted at 5 ng/μl. We selected the genes of interest based on the annotation of stress-related pathways
from leaf apoplast proteome. Gene specific primers
(Additional file 15: Table S9) were designed according
to available sequences from the NCBI Entrez Nucleotide
database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and from the
poplar genome database. Amplifications were performed
using a Stratagene Mx3000p apparatus (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and 1× QuantiTect SYBR
Green mixture (Qiagen). Primer specificity was tested
on NM6 genomic DNA (P. trichocarpa, P. Nigra,
P. maximowiczii) and used at a concentration of
0.6 μM. Each PCR reaction had a 25-μl volume and
contained 0.6 μM of forward and reverse primers, 10 ng
of cDNA as template, and 1× master mix solution
(Quanti Tect Tm Sybr @ Green PCR Kit, Qiagen inc.,
Valencia, CA). Using the SYBR Green amplification
mode in Stratagene’s software, PCR cycling conditions
were 15 min incubation at 95°C, followed by 40 successive cycles (94°C for 15 sec, annealing and extension
between 57°C and 65°C for 2 min, depending on the primer set and target gene). Primer efficiency and number

Tissues from pressurized and control leaves of three
mature trees were fixed in half-strength Karnovsky’s
fixative (2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde)
with phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.2; [131]). Samples
were then rinsed in distilled water and dehydrated in a
graded ethanol series. Leaf pieces were infiltrated and
embedded in Paraplast Plus (Oxford Labware, St. Louis,
MO) using CitriSolve (Fisher Scientific, Houston, TX) as
a transitional fluid. Serial 8 micron sections were cut
with an American Optical 820 rotary microtome (Fisher
Scientific, Houston, TX) and were stained with saffranin
and fast green. All the thin sections were examined for
ruptured cells in the vicinity of stomata and within the
vasculature on an Olympus BX60 light microscope
(Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA).

stored at -70°C until analysis commenced and were
thawed immediately before use. Congruently, three samples of whole leaves were harvested from each tree for
nutrient analysis. Leaf samples were dried at 50°C for 48 h
and ground into a fine powder. Two hundred milligrams
of leaf tissues were placed in a porcelain crucible, placed
in a furnace, and ashed at 500°C for 4 h. The samples
were then allowed to cool to room temperature. Ash was
gently mixed with 1 ml of hydrochloric acid and deionized
water solution (1:1 v/v) and allowed to dissolve for 1 h.
Subsequently, liquid was decanted through 2 mm and
1 mm screens, respectively, for 1 h, and the solution was
collected. Nutrient concentrations (Ca, K, Mg, Na, P, Cu,
Fe, Mn, and Zn) from the whole leaf extract and the undiluted apoplast fluid were determined spectrophotometrically using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission
spectrophotometer (Thermo Jarrel Ash Iris Advantage
ICP, Houghton, MI). There were three technical replications taken from each of the three biological replications.
Concentrations were estimated for leaf (mg/g) and apoplast fluid (mg/l). Apoplast fluid density was estimated to
be approximately one based on three mass measurements.
Leaf and apoplast fluid nutrient measurements were then
converted to a standard unit of parts per million (ppm). A
mixed general linear model was used to compare the concentrations between the fixed tissue type effect and the
random biological repeat (tree) effect.

Immunoblot analysis

Abscisic acid analysis

Protein samples extracted from leaf apoplast fluid and
whole leaf tissue of three sexually mature trees were
resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer [62.5 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 10% (v/v) glycerol; 2% (w/v) SDS; and
720 mM b-mercaptoethanol] and quantified with the 2-D
Quant Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Fifty micrograms of
total proteins from each sample were separated on SDSPAGE using 4% stacking and 12% separating polyacrylamide gels. Protein samples were subsequently blotted
onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
using a semi-dried electro-transferring blotter (Owl
Separation Systems, Portsmouth, NH). The rbcL (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit) and malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) proteins, which
are symplastic [25], were detected using the ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (Amersham Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Monoclonal
primary antibodies for rbcL (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan)
were used in a dilution ratio of 1:5,000 for hybridization.
A dilution ratio of 1:7,500 was used for cMDH (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

Three independent leaf samples (#9-11 from the base of a
shoot) from the upper crown of a sexually mature tree
were collected 2 h after sunrise at each collection time
from April to July in 2007. One gram (fresh weight) of
leaves was ground into powder which was then freezedried using a SpeedVac (LABCONCO, model LYPHLOCK 6). 100-150 mg (dry weight) of sample was used for
determining the concentration of abscisic acid by following the procedure detailed in Destefano-Beltrán et al [137].

of molecules were determined using the No-Ct-Linear
Regression of Efficiency (LRE) from fluorescence and Ct
values [134]. Gene expression was presented as fold
change observed between treatments relative to control
samples based on a modified Livak and Schmittgen
[135] calculation (2 -ΔΔCt ) to introduce efficiency (E).
Internal control gene-stability measure was evaluated for
poplar actin, elF4, ubi10, gadph, and cdc2 following a
previously described normalization method (Additional
file 16: Figure S7; [136]).
Light microscopy

Nutrient analysis

Three replications of 1.5 ml leaf apoplast fluid per sexually
mature tree were used for nutrient analysis. Extracts were

Phylogenetic analysis

Full-length (predicted) alcohol dehydrogenase protein
sequences were retrieved from the poplar database
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1_1/Poptr1_1.home.html.
New poplar IDs were obtained from http://www.phytozome.net/poplar (Version 2.0 of the poplar assembly
and annotation). Arabidopsis full-length (predicted)
alcohol dehydrogenase proteins were obtained from the
Arabidopsis database http://www.arabidopsis.org by conducting protein-protein BLAST using the protein
sequence for poplar apoplast alcohol dehydrogenases.
At2g47140 was used to root the tree. To construct the
phylogenetic tree for peroxidases, protein sequences of
peroxidases for other species were obtained from NCBI
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Short sequences were

Pechanova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:674

excluded. For creating multiple alignments and constructing and visualizing the phylogenetic trees, we followed the procedure outlined in Hsu et al [131].
Construction of regulatory networks and pathways

Unique poplar protein identification numbers from
shoot and leaf apoplast were compiled with those from
root apoplast [22]. These proteins (144 from leaf, 135
from stem, and 97 from root) were imported into
Pathway Studio (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville, MD).
These protein IDs were associated to homologs based
on a poplar-to-Arabidopsis mapfile. Briefly, this file
was created by blasting poplar proteins against the
Arabidopsis genome. Appropriate homologs were
selected based on best e-value and greatest similarity.
After import, 165 proteins from root, stem, and leaf
tissues were successfully matched with proteins
described in the ResNet Plant Database 2.0. A pathway
was then constructed based on established connections
in ResNet Plant Database 2.0 with other proteins,
small molecules, treatments, and plant processes. The
initial pathway was extremely large and had many
pathway branches not connected with physiological
process of pertinence to our study. Thus, pathway
thinning was conducted. First, plant processes not
related to stress response were discarded. Second, connections were discarded if our proteins were not
directly in the connection or upstream (e.g., direct
connection between treatment and plant process). A
final re-analysis of the pathway was conducted to
ensure all objects were still connected to the main
pathway. Any objects that became disconnected
because of the previous two thinning regimes were
subsequently deleted. Finally, proteins were positioned
and color coded based on the tissue(s) in which they
occurred.
