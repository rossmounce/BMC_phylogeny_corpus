Abstract
Background: Molecular phylogenetics and phylogenomics have greatly revised and enriched the
fungal systematics in the last two decades. Most of the analyses have been performed by comparing
single or multiple orthologous gene regions. Sequence alignment has always been an essential
element in tree construction. These alignment-based methods (to be called the standard methods
hereafter) need independent verification in order to put the fungal Tree of Life (TOL) on a secure
footing. The ever-increasing number of sequenced fungal genomes and the recent success of our
newly proposed alignment-free composition vector tree (CVTree, see Methods) approach have
made the verification feasible.
Results: In all, 82 fungal genomes covering 5 phyla were obtained from the relevant genome
sequencing centers. An unscaled phylogenetic tree with 3 outgroup species was constructed by
using the CVTree method. Overall, the resultant phylogeny infers all major groups in accordance
with standard methods. Furthermore, the CVTree provides information on the placement of
several currently unsettled groups. Within the sub-phylum Pezizomycotina, our phylogeny places
the Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes as sister taxa. Within the Sordariomycetes, it infers that
Magnaporthe grisea and the Plectosphaerellaceae are closely related to the Sordariales and
Hypocreales, respectively. Within the Eurotiales, it supports that Aspergillus nidulans is the earlybranching species among the 8 aspergilli. Within the Onygenales, it groups Histoplasma and
Paracoccidioides together, supporting that the Ajellomycetaceae is a distinct clade from
Onygenaceae. Within the sub-phylum Saccharomycotina, the CVTree clearly resolves two clades:
(1) species that translate CTG as serine instead of leucine (the CTG clade) and (2) species that have
undergone whole-genome duplication (the WGD clade). It places Candida glabrata at the base of
the WGD clade.
Conclusion: Using different input data and methodology, the CVTree approach is a good
complement to the standard methods. The remarkable consistency between them has brought
about more confidence to the current understanding of the fungal branch of TOL.

Background
Fungi make up one of the major Eukaryotic kingdoms
besides the Plantae and Animalia. These heterotrophic
organisms possess a chitinous cell wall and grow as single
cells or as multicellular mycelium made of hyphae.
Although some species are not capable of forming specialized reproductive structures and propagate solely by vegetative growth, many fungi reproduce sexually and
asexually via spores. To date, around 70 000 fungal species have been described while the total number of species
has been estimated at 1.5 million [1,2].
Since the early 1990s, the introduction of molecular characters has drastically revised the traditional fungi phylogenetic system based on morphology, physiology and sexual
states. Numerous works have addressed cladistic relationships among all major groups of the kingdom [2-5].
Molecular characters have shown great power when morphological characters are convergent, reduced, or missing
among the taxa. So far most fungal molecular phylogenetic inferences have been established on alignment of
single or several orthologous gene loci [3,6]. When multilocus data are investigated, the commonly adopted methods are gene concatenation and consensus tree analysis
[4]. Since more genes provide more phylogenetic information, many recent phylogenomic studies tried to infer
phylogenies for various organisms by combining large
datasets of aligned genes (or ESTs) [7-9]. For example,
Robbertse et al [10] and Fitzpatrick et al [4] built phylogeny from large datasets of protein-coding genes of 17 and
42 genomes, respectively.
These methods have achieved great success in the last two
decades. However, some well-documented stochastic or
systematic errors in tree reconstruction often lead to
incongruent results [11,12]. Furthermore, their applications depend on manual selection of many parameters
and fine adjustments of sequence data. For example, at
least at some stages, the standard methods select and process genes (and sites) to avoid systematic errors [11]. These
problems broach a question of principle: the phylogeny
based on sequence alignment needs an independent verification in order to put the fungal TOL on a more secure
footing. Recently, methods based on other strategies such
as gene content, gene order and the distribution of oligonucleotides or peptides have been proposed to infer phylogenies (see [12] and references therein), which have
made the verification feasible.
We have constructed a kingdom-wide fungal phylogenetic
tree for 82 sequenced genomes using an alignment-free
composition vector (CV) method [13-16]. The method
has previously been successfully applied to prokaryotic
and viral phylogenies [16,17]. It uses whole-genome data
of organisms and excludes artificial selection of genes and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/195

sites. In this report we will compare in detail our phylogenetic inferences with those inferred from standard methods. We will show the striking consistency between them
and discuss the relationships among controversial lineages. Since our method reconstructs the fungal phylogeny
with independent input data and methodology, the
CVTree is a strong independent verification and complement to, but not a substitution for the traditional alignment-based analysis.

Results and discussions
Higher-level phylogeny
Basal splits and the Dikarya
Figure 1 represents the CVTree of the 82 sequenced fungi.
The organisms are grouped into 5 phyla or subphyla at the
highest level, with the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota
forming a monophyletic group Dikarya. Because currently
available genomes in Chytridiomycota (2 strains of the
same species, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), Microsporidia (Encephalitozoon cuniculi only) and Mucoromycotina (2 genera of the same family, Rhizopus oryzae and
Phycomyces blakesleeanus) lack diversity, it is inappropriate
to fully discuss the relationships among these clades until
more organisms are sequenced. The following discussion
will focus on the Basidiomycota and Ascomycota.
The Basidiomycota
The phylum Basidiomycota consists of 3 subphyla: Agaricomycotina, Pucciniomycotina and Ustilaginomycotina.
Except for Malassezia globosa, the 11 Basidiomycetes are
classified into 5 classes, 7 orders, 7 families, 8 genera and
9 species in the scheme of the NCBI taxonomy. M. globosa
is marked as Ustilaginomycotina incertae sedis in the NCBI
taxonomy browser [18]. The CVTree places it as sister
taxon to Ustilago maydis (Figure 1, block H). This topology
is supported by recent analyses of rDNA data and concatenated single-copy orthologous proteins [19,20].

Although each of the three subphyla is widely accepted as
monophyletic group, their relationships are not wellresolved [3]. Previous cytological, biochemical and
molecular analyses [2,21] have suggested a topology like
(Pucciniomycotina, (Agaricomycotina, Ustilaginomycotina)). With highly restricted taxon sampling in the Pucciniomycotina and Ustilaginomycotina, the CVTree
recovers the same topology, but the bootstrap value is
rather low (Figure 1, blocks in blue). Broader taxon sampling in each subphyla and further investigations are necessary to address this difficult question.
The Ascomycota
The 65 Ascomycetes come from three subphyla: the Pezizomycotina, Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina.
Although the monophyly of the Taphrinomycotina has
not been fully agreed [22-25], the fission yeasts Schizosac-

The CVTree recognizes 4 class-level clades within the Pezizomycotina: the Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes. They all come from the
well-supported "Leotiomyceta" clade but their relationships have not been well resolved [26]. Lutzoni et al [2]
placed the Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes as sister clades in their four-gene analysis. However, subsequent works based on single- and multi-gene(s) found
that it was the Leotiomycetes rather than Dothideomycetes that should be sister to the Sordariomycetes and they
formed a clade [4,10,25,26]. Our CVTree confirms the latter topology (Figure 1).

charomycetes (Taphrinomycotina) have been widely
taken as a basal lineage of the Ascomycota [2,3,5,25]. Our
results support the early divergence of Schizosaccharomyces
and a close relationship between the Pezizomycotina and
Saccharomycotina (Figure 1). In the current dataset,
organisms from the Taphrinomycotina and Saccharomycotina come from only one order in either subphylum, so
it is proper to focus our higher-than-order level discussion
on the relationships within the subphylum Pezizomycotina, where we have 39 organisms distributed in 4
classes.

Figure 1
The CVTree of 82 fungi
The CVTree of 82 fungi. The CVTree of 82 fungi. This
tree is obtained with K = 7. Bootstrap values (100 bootstrap
replicates; [see Additional file 3] and [13] for details) are
reported as percentages. Strain names are given only when
more than one organism in that species appeared in our
dataset. Blocks colored in red, blue, green, yellow and purple
correspond to the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromycotina and Microsporidia, respectively.
Major groups in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are distinguished by alternate red and blue colors, respectively.

Although many accept the close relationship between the
Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes, the relationships
among the Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes-Leotiomycetes clade were less clear. At least
three hypotheses have been proposed: (1) the Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes-Leotiomycetes group
together to the exclusion of Eurotiomycetes [26]. (2) The
Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes-Leotiomycetes
group together to the exclusion of Dothideomycetes
[4,10,25]. (3) The Dothideomycetes and the Eurotiomycetes form a clade that is sister group to the Sordariomycetes-Leotiomycetes clade [4,10]. By including in their
analyses only one species (Stagonospora nodorum) of
Dothideomycetes, both Fitzpatrick et al [4] and Robbertse
et al [10] reported conflicting results: depending on the
tree construction model used, their results supported
either hypothesis (2) or (3). By contrast, the current work
adds in four more species (i.e., Cochliobolus heterostrophus,
Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Mycosphaerella fijiensis and
Mycosphaerella graminicola) and our result unambiguously
places the Dothideomycetes sister to Eurotiomycetes, supporting hypothesis (3) (Figure 1, block A and B).
Within the Sordariomycetes, Hypocreales and Sordariales
are two well-supported order-level clades. However, it is
uncertain in which order M. grisea (family Magnaporthaceae) should be placed (e.g. both Index Fungorum [27] and NCBI taxonomy browser [18] categorize it
as Sordariomycetes incertae sedis). The CVTree suggests

Page 3 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:195

that it is closely related to the Sordariales (Figure 1, block
D). This placement concurs with some recent phylogenomic analyses [3,4,10,28]. Similarly, the order-level classification of two Verticillium species (family
Plectosphaerellaceae) is not fully resolved either. Our tree
places the Plectosphaerellaceae sister to the Hypocreales
(Figure 1, block D), and this relationship is supported by
the 4-gene phylogeny of Zhang et al [28] as well as Index
Fungorum. Index Fungorum categorizes the family into
the subclass Hypocreomycetidae, which includes in the
Hypocreales. Regarding the other three classes, none of
them have more than two ordinal members, so the orderlevel relationships within them could only be trivial.
Lower-than-order-level phylogeny
Comparing to higher-level relationships, there have been
more disagreements regarding the classification of taxa
lower than order. This was partially caused by the difficulty to recognize various sexual states of one and the
same species. Even the International Code for Botanic
Nomenclature (Article 59) [29] permits to give anamorph
a separate name from the corresponding teleomorph.
However, molecular characters are capable to reveal more
definite relationships.

In our dataset there are 7 orders (i.e., the Schizosaccharomycetales from the Taphrinomycotina; the Eurotiales,
Hypocreales, Onygenales, Pleosporales and Sordariales
from the Pezizomycotina; and the Saccharomycetales as
the unique order in the Saccharomycotina) in which the
number of sequenced organisms is greater than two.
Within the Pleosporales, the relationships among the 3
organisms are less controversial: P. tritici-repentis and C.
heterostrophus are from the family Pleosporaceae while S.
nodorum is from the Phaeosphaeriaceae (Figure 1, block
B). In what follows we discuss the phylogeny within the
other 6 orders one by one.
The Schizosaccharomycetales
All the three organisms in this order belong to the genus
Schizosaccharomyces. Before whole-genomes were available for members of the Schizosaccharomyces, their phylogenetic relationships were inferred from mitochondrial
genomes [30]. Mitochondrial phylogeny shows that
Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Schizosaccharomyces octosporus are more closely related to the exclusion of Schizosaccharomyces japonicus. The CVTree recovers the identical
topology from whole-genome data (Figure 1, block F).
The Sordariales
In our analysis the order Sordariales is represented by 3
species: Chaetomium globosum, Neurospora crassa and
Podospora anserina. According to the NCBI taxonomy they
belong to the Chaetomiaceae, Sordariaceae and Lasi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/195

osphaeriaceae families, respectively. Previous analysis
based on LSU rDNA (and other genes) have shown that
many traditional families in this order do not form clades,
e.g., the Chaetomiaceae and Lasiosphaeriaceae are paraphyletic groups [28,31,32]. Despite such inconsistency,
recent 18S rDNA and phylogenomic analyses agreed that
the relationships among the three species are ((C. globosum, P. anserina), N. crassa) [3,4,25,28,33]. Our CVTree
phylogeny supports this topology as well (Figure 1,
block D).
We mention in passing that so far the rice blast fungus M.
grisea has been denoted as Sordariomycetes incertae sedis,
i. e., not being designated to an existing order. From the
CVTree and papers just cited above it comes out as
((Hypocreales, Plectosphaerellaceae), (M. grisea, Sordariales)), hinting on the feasibility of putting this species in
a new order.
The Eurotiales
In the order Eurotiales all sequenced organisms are
Aspergillus species, including Neosartorya fischeri, the teleomorph of Aspergillus fischerianus. The CVTree phylogeny
(Figure 1, block A) of the 8 species is identical to the
recent result of 30-gene phylogenomic analysis by Rokas
et al (2007) [34] and to that shown in the BROAD-FIG
Aspergillus Comparative Database [35]. In all of these
trees A. nidulans is the basal lineage while in the previously widely accepted LSU rDNA phylogeny by Peterson
(2000) [36] it did not ([see Additional file 1], Figure
S1(a)). Another difference between Peterson's result and
ours is the placement of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus terreus: the former gave that A. niger was sister taxon to the
Aspergillus oryzae-Aspergillus flavus clade and A. terreus
diverged early. In contrast, our result supports the sister
relationship of A. terreus and the A. oryzae-A. flavus clade
and the early divergence of A. niger.
The Onygenales
In our dataset there are 4 species with 11 strains belonging
to the Onygenales. The two Coccidioides species as well as
Uncinocarpus reesii form one clade and the three Paracoccidioides as well as Histoplasma capsulatum form the other.
Deeper in the tree, these two clades are sister taxa (Figure
1, block A). For a long time, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis
was considered an imperfect fungus. In recent years, it has
been considered a member of the family Onygenaceae
and placed in a common group with C. immitis, H. capsulatum and U. reesii [37]. More recently, a clade distinct
from Onygenaceae has been proposed as a new family
Ajellomycetaceae to encompass Histoplasma and Paracoccidioides but not C. immitis and U. reesii [38,39]. The current work supports the suggestion of the Ajellomycetaceae
by placing the Onygenaceae as its sister group.

The Hypocreales
In the Hypocreales and Saccharomycetales, taxonomy
shows inadequate resolution and conflicts with current
phylogeny derived from standard methods, i.e., some traditional families and genera turn out to be non-monophyletic. We discuss phylogeny of these two branches in
the following two sections.

Although the molecular phylogenetic studies have helped
in solving many problems that morphology could not,
the classification of many members of Hypocreales, especially Fusarium spp. and Trichoderma spp. are far from being
settled [40,41]. Regarding the 7 organisms in our dataset
in the order, the key difference between the CVTree (Figure 1, block D) and NCBI taxonomy ([see Additional file
1], Figure S1(b)) is the position of Fusarium oxysporum. In
the NCBI taxonomy, it is placed in the group mitosporic
Hypocreales, while Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium
graminearum belong to the family Nectriaceae. In the
CVTree, however, the three species form the Nectriaceae
clade: F. oxysporum is grouped with F. verticillioides and F.
graminearum is sister taxon to them. The monophyly of
the clade is supported by Index Fungorum [27], which
classifies F. oxysporum into the Nectriaceae. Moreover, the
same topology can be found at BROAD-FGI Fusarium
Comparative Database [42].
The Saccharomycetales
The Saccharomycetales is a unique order in the Saccharomycetes which in turn is a unique class in the subphylum
Saccharomycotina according to Hibbett et al (2007) [5].
These species have been studied extensively and some
members are model organisms. Two distinct events in
their evolutionary history have been well-documented:
(1) some species have undergone whole-genome duplication more than 100 million years ago. They form the socalled WGD clade; (2) some species translate CUG codon
into serine instead of leucine. They form another branch
called the CTG clade. Any reasonable phylogeny should
clearly resolve the two clades among yeasts. The CVTree
does.

Our current dataset includes 23 organisms from Saccharomycetales, as compared to 19 in Fitzpatrick et al (2006)
[4] and 12 in James et al (2006) [3]. Therefore, we are in a
position to perform a more detailed comparison of the
CVTree with other phylogenies.
Within the Saccharomycetales, Yarrowia lipolytica is the
early-diverging lineage and the other organisms consists
of two groups covering the WGD and CTG clade, respectively (Figure 1, block E). This is a common feature of the
12-, 19 and 32-organism trees. Within the CTG clade, the
CVTree gives a structure identical with that of Fitzpatrick

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/195

et al [4] if Pichia stipitis is not included in. Our tree places
P. stipitis and D. hansenii as sister taxa. This placement is
consistent with the result of the 94 single-copy genes analysis [43], which suggests a close relationship between D.
hansenii and P. stipitis to the exclusion of C. lusitaniae (Figure 1, block E). Our results further confirms two features
in the CTG clade [4]: (1) Candida guilliermondii is closely
related to Debaryomyces hansenii to the exclusion of Candida lusitaniae and (2) Lodderomyces elongisporus is closely
related to Candida parapsilosis and is likely to be its sexual
form.
The other group further splits into two clades by an
ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) event. The
WGD clade includes six Saccharomyces sensu stricto species
and two Saccharomyces sensu lato species (Saccharomyces
castellii and C. glabrata). The ladderized topology within
the Saccharomyces sensu stricto organisms is consistent with
previous phylogenomic results [44-46]. So far the base of
the WGD clade has not been confidently resolved. Some
proposed that S. castellii diverged from the Saccharomyces
sensu stricto species earlier than C. glabrata by comparing
synteny among species and multi-gene analysis [4,47].
However, other phylogenomic analyses argued that C. glabrata diverged earlier [4,44,45]. According to the CVTree,
C. glabrata is the likely basal lineage of the WGD clade
(Figure 1, block E).
The monophyly of Kluyveromyces waltii, Saccharomyces
kluyveri, Eremothecium gossypii and Kluyveromyces lactis is
unsettled either. Some authors suggested that the four species are paraphyletic but they together with the WGD species constitute a clade [46,48]. For example, Kurtzman
(2003) [46] proposed a topology like (((WGD, (K. waltii,
S. kluyveri)), K. lactis), E. gossypii). In contrast, others proposed that the 4 species themselves form a clade [4,45].
The CVTree supports the monophyly of the four yeasts
and the sister-relationship between this clade and the
WGD group (Figure 1, block E).
The relationships among these 4 organisms are again controversial. Although many works agreed that (K. waltii, S.
kluyveri) should be closer to each other, the grouping of E.
gossypii and K. lactis are not widely accepted. Kurtzman
[46] and Suh et al [48] proposed that they are paraphyletic, while Jeffroy et al [45] and Fitzpatrick et al [4]
suggested that they form a clade and placed this group as
sister branch to the (K. waltii, S. kluyveri) clade. The
CVTree, unlike studies mentioned above, places K. lactis
and (K. waltii, S. kluyveri) as sister group to the exclusion
of E. gossypii (Figure 1, block E). As different materials and
methods give controversial results, more genomes and
analyses are required to confidently resolve this incongruence.

Conclusion
To the best of sequenced fungi available, we have inferred
their phylogeny using the alignment-free composition
vector method and discussed their relationships. The
above detailed comparison has shown remarkable consistency between the CVTree and the recent results of
standard methods, the consistency actually holds at all
levels. We can now give an overall picture of the CVTree
phylogeny: the Microsporidia is placed in fungi and the
Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are resolved as sister taxa
that together constitute a clade named Dikarya. Moreover,
we also investigated the position of the kingdom by adding gene repertoires of animals, plants and Protozoans.
Our results suggested the sister-relationship between
fungi and the animal-choanoflagellate clade (data not
shown). In the Ascomycota, 3 subphyla are recognized:
the Taphrinomycotina is the early-diverging group; the
Pezizomycotina includes 4 clades from the "Leotiomyceta" and the Saccharomycotina encompasses the WGD
and CTG clades. In the Basidiomycota, monophyly of
three subphyla are supported as well.
The novelty of this work can be viewed from the following
four aspects: First, the CVTree uses different data from
standard methods. Standard methods construct trees
using subsets of proteomes or rRNAs as input data. The
number is from one to a few hundred. By contrast, the CV
method uses all the information of nuclear protein-coding genes. In addition, as we have explained in Introduction, most of the standard multi-gene analyses manually
select genes and sites from input data. In contrast, our
approach does not need such adjustment, thus circumvent the ambiguity of choosing genes and sites.
Second, the CVTree uses an independent methodology to
automatically construct phylogenetic tree. In standard
methods, the alignment algorithm, evolutionary model
and numerous parameters are needed to be selected and
set case-by-case according to the heterogeneity of input
data. So far there is no general rule to guide these selections and settings. By contrast, the string-counting strategy
of CVTree minimizes arbitrary factors in tree construction.
It has only one parameter K ([see Additional file 2] and
Methods) and the construction process is automatic. Furthermore, the algorithm is rapid comparing to many
standard methods. For instance, it takes only about 1 hour
to construct one 82-organism tree on a computer of 2.3
GHz CPU and 4 G RAM for various K values. ([see Additional file 2]).
Third, the CVTree gives novel and stronger supports to the
results of standard methods through remarkable consistency between them. We note that such consistency not
only confirms the validity of our methods but also
strongly support the fungi phylogeny based on the stand-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/195

ard methods because such supports come from an independent input dataset and methodology. The supports
from CVTree put the current understanding of the fungi
phylogeny on a more secure footing. Current kingdomwide fungi phylogeny has been established on numerous
works, each of which investigated a major or minor group
and contributed a piece (i.e., local phylogeny) to the
whole picture. These works constructed local phylogenies
using different input data, site selection strategies, alignment algorithms, evolutionary models and parameters. In
other words, the kingdom tree was assembled from local
phylogenies that complied with different criteria. However, the feasibility of assembling these pieces together is
not self-evident and needs validations. Our CVTree provides such a proper support because all of the relationships therein are inferred under the same criteria.
Whenever a group is supported it is reinforced by a "global" picture.
Fourth, novel phylogenetic findings of this work. To the
best of our knowledge, the CVTree is so far the only successful kingdom-wide fungi phylogeny constructed by a
strategy other than the standard methods. Besides consistency, the current study has shed light on many controversial cases. For example, the CVTree suggests that
Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes are sister clades
using broader species sampling than previous works
[4,10]; that M. grisea and the Plectosphaerellaceae group
with the Sordariales and Hypocreales, respectively
[3,4,10,28]; that the Ajellomycetaceae is a distinct clade
from the Onygenaceae [38,39]; and that A. nidulans is the
earliest diverged among the 8 aspergilli [34,35]. In all of
the above examples, contradictions are found between
researches done in different periods and it is interesting to
note that the CVTree tends to support more recent results.
CVTree's support to a certain relationship actually adds
weight to it.
The CVTree is robust, to a certain degree, to variations of
gene models used in genome annotation: (1) Our experiments showed that randomly adding or dropping â¤ 30%
proteins from the whole gene products rarely changed
major relationships in the tree ([see Additional file 3]).
(2) The gene models of some fungal genomes have been
changed rapidly because of lacking of evidences of transcripts and these changes have been reflected in different
versions of genome annotation. This enable us to test the
topological stability of the CVTree by using different versions of genome annotation to construct trees. We downloaded multiple annotation versions of some organisms,
i.e., two versions of M. grisea and two of F. graminearum
and used their combinations to construct trees. Our
results showed that all possible combinations generated
identical topology ([see Additional file 3] for details).
However, the stability was not absolute and differences in

Page 6 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:195

gene annotations might alter the tree topology. We found
an example (A. niger) that different gene annotations of
the same species led to two slightly different positions, but
it did not affect other species in the tree ([see Additional
file 3]).
As a method in development, the current CVTree has
some restrictions: (1) The relationship between the
branch length of CVTree and that of alignment-based tree
is currently unclear. Our simulation experiments have
revealed that distance between two CVs is proportional to
traditional evolutionary distance when substitutions
between two sequences are rare (data not shown). However, because the distance between two CVs is not estimated from site substitutions, the branch length of the
CVTree in general does not have simple relationship with
the traditional evolutionary distance. As a result we currently can not compare the CVTree with alignment-based
tree at the level of scaled branch length. Therefore the current work constructs unscaled tree and only discuss topological relationships. (2) The CVTree may suffer from
long-branch attraction and amino acids composition bias.
The core of the CV method lies in that it provides an alternative way to construct the distance-matrix. Once the
matrix is established, the following tree construction process is performed by NJ method. Many have reported that
long-branch attraction and amino acids composition bias
may affect the NJ tree topology [49,50]. However, it is not
clear how and to what extent the matrix construction
process is affected by these errors. (3) Our method is
based on whole-genome data, so its sampling scope is
restricted by the number of sequenced genomes.
Having been successfully applied to the prokaryotic
branches of the TOL, the present research extends the
CVTree method to the Eukaryotic kingdom of fungi and
provides independent verification of traditional phylogenetic approaches. Further study to cover the whole TOL
including all Eukaryotic branches is underway.

Methods
The CVTree method
The composition vector method used in this study has
been described in previous publications [13-15] so we
only give a brief account here. An organism is represented
first by a raw composition vector whose components correspond to the number of various overlapping K-peptides
(for a fixed K) in the collection of all protein products
encoded in the genome. These 20K components are put in
lexicographic order. In order to highlight the shaping role
of selective evolution, the components of a CV are then
modified by subtracting a statistical background reflecting
the viewpoint of the neutral theory of evolution that
mutations happen randomly at molecular level. Our substraction procedure is based on a (K - 2)-th order Markov

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/195

prediction and therefore the minimum K starts from 3.
The dissimilarity of two species is measured by a correlation distance derived from the corresponding modified
CVs. Finally, from the distance matrix thus obtained, a
neighbor-joining tree is produced by the PHYLIP package
[51]. In the CVTree construction the fixed peptide length
K controls the resolution of the method. The best choice
of K depends on the length of input genomes. Our experiments revealed that K = 6 and 5 are the best for prokaryotes and viruses, respectively [13,17]. For fungi, we
constructed trees of K = 3 to 10 and evaluated their robustness by 100 bootstrap replicates ([see Additional file 2]
and Figure 1). Since the K = 7 topology shows better bootstrap values than others, our discussions in this study are
mainly based on it.
Fungal and outgroup genomes
The collection of protein products from 82 fungal
genomes was used in this study (Table 1). We relied on
the genome annotations provided by the corresponding
sequencing project with A. niger being the only exception.
This species was annotated in house ([see Additional file
3] and Table 1) by BGF [52,53], an ab initio gene prediction tool developed in our laboratory. The last column
"Source" in Table 1 indicates the origin of the data:
BROAD Institute Fungal Genome Initiative (BROAD-FGI)
[54], Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI)
[55], National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) ftp-site [18], Resources for Fungal Comparative
Genomics (RFCG) [56] and Fungal Genome Research
website (FGR) [57]. A protist choanoflagellate (Monosiga
brevicollis) and two metazoans (Caenorhabditis elegans and
Drosophila melanogaster) genomes were included as outgroup. The RFCG data used in this study covers all the fungal species which were used in Fitzpatrick et al (2006)
analysis [4] except for Candida dubliniensis because its
sequences are not available at RFCG.
Fungal phylogeny references
In order to integrate the multi-laboratory efforts in fungal
molecular phylogeny and taxonomy, an Assembling the
Fungal Tree of Life (AFTOL) project was launched in 2002
[58]. As a preliminary but successful outcome of AFTOL,
Hibbett et al. have published a higher-level fungal phylogenetic classification [5]. It is a classification as more than
two lower taxa belonging to a higher taxon may be juxtaposed in this scheme and seven Linnaeus ranks (kingdom,
subkingdom, phylum, subphylum, class, subclass, and
order) are used. It is phylogenetic as well because emphasis has been put on each included taxon being a monophyletic group.

This classification allows us to use terms of taxonomy
when analyzing phylogenetic relationships. However, it is
worth noting that our work concerns phylogeny, but not

taxonomy. Accordingly, taxonomic terms such as "higherlevel" or "class-level" clades, "three subphyla" and "the
order Sordariales" should be understood phylogenetically. In other words, taxa in this study are not used as
labels of hierarchical taxonomic ranks but only as names
of clades. Higher or lower levels actually mean major or
minor clades. A clade being called a class or an order
merely means that it forms a monophyletic branch and
has been named in that way in some previous publications.

The present study infers phylogenetic relationships from
whole-genome data of fungi without using sequence
alignment. We use the Hibbett et al paper [5] as a major
reference to phylogenetic classification at higher-thanorder levels. When it comes to compare the branching pattern of originally juxtaposed taxa we refer to recent phylogenetic studies that utilize the standard methods.

Acknowledgements
Regarding phylogeny at lower-than-order levels, we used
the following three publicly accessible databases as references. Index Fungorum [27] provides an up-to-date phylogenetic classification of fungi. Focusing on the
Ascomycota, Myconet [59] regularly updates its classification. Another popular taxonomy database is NCBI taxonomy browser [60], which integrates classifications from
various sources and gives useful information as well. If at
a certain node the resolution is not high enough or when
discrepancy between the CVTree phylogeny and current
classification was found, we refer to recent publications
for more information.
