Abstract

Results: From a whole-genome comparative analysis of eleven Salmonella, three Escherichia coli and
one Shigella strain, we inferred the relative time of insertion of putative horizontally acquired (PHA)
genes in three Salmonella strains on different branches of the S. enterica phylogenetic tree.
Compositional analysis suggests that most of the PHA genes are still undergoing an amelioration
process and shows a clear correlation between time of insertion and the level of amelioration.

Under this assumption the E. coli and Salmonella enterica
lineages have each gained and lost more than 3 megabases
(Mb) of novel DNA since their divergence.
DNA sequences of recent HGT events can deviate strongly
from the genome background composition while older insertions have often lost their donor-specific sequence signature
[3]. Generally, each genome exhibits a reasonably constant
background sequence composition; however, some genes,
traditionally considered part of the core-gene dataset, such as

information

The divergence of Salmonella and Escherichia coli lineages
from their common ancestor has been estimated to have
occurred approximately 100-140 million years (Myr) ago
[1,2]. Using models of amelioration to estimate the time of
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events it has been previously
shown [3] that the entire E. coli chromosome contains more
than 600 kb of horizontally transferred, protein-coding DNA.
The same authors estimated the HGT rate to be 31 kb per million years, which is close to the point mutation frequency.

Background

refereed research

Conclusion: The results show that older insertions include almost all functional classes. However,
very recent horizontal transfer events in the Salmonella lineage involve primarily prophage elements
that are shared only between very recently diverged lineages; despite this, the prophage sequence
composition is close to that of the host, indicating that host adaptation, rather than amelioration,
is likely to be the source of the compositional similarity. Almost half of the PHA genes were
acquired at the base of the Salmonella lineage, whereas nearly three-quarters are shared between
most S. enterica subspecies. The numerical distribution of PHA genes in the Salmonella tree
topology correlates well with the divergence of the major Salmonella species, highlighting the major
impact of horizontal transfer on the evolution of the salmonellae.

deposited research

Background: DNA sequences that are shared between closely related organisms while being
absent from their common ancestor and from sister lineages of that ancestor are likely to have
been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Over time, the composition of those sequences tends
to become more similar to the compositional signature of their host (amelioration).

Vernikos et al.

rRNA and ribosomal protein-coding genes, often deviate
compositionally from the genome background sequence composition mainly due to specific, well-preserved functional
constraints rather than their alien origin (although some of
them can be horizontally acquired [4,5]). In those cases the
effect of the amelioration over time is expected to be trivial
since strong selection applies.
Base composition and specifically G+C content is known to be
related to phylogeny [6]. Consequently, closely related organisms tend to have similar G+C content; for example, the average G+C content of E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella lineages
is approximately 50%, 51% and 52%, respectively, while for
the Gram-positive Staphylococcus and Streptococcus lineages the average G+C content is 33% and 38%, respectively.
Usually horizontally acquired genes are introduced into a single lineage, and, therefore, the acquired DNA sequence will be
limited to the descendents of the recipient strain and absent
from closely related ones. For example, Salmonella Pathogenicity Island (SPI) 1, a 40 kb island carrying a type-III
secretion system that enabled the invasion of epithelial cells
is present in both Salmonella species, S. bongori and S.
enterica, while it is absent from the genome of E. coli. Consequently SPI-1 represents an ancient HGT event that took
place close to the divergence of the two genera (E. coli and
Salmonella) [7]. On the other hand, SPI-2, which is important
for systemic infection, is a mosaic of two independent acquisitions [8]: the tetrathionate reductase (ttr) gene cluster, a 15
kb region (present in S. bongori and S. enterica); and a 25 kb
region encoding an additional type-III secretion system
(present only in S. enterica). Consequently, using a reference
tree topology, HGT events can be distributed into increasing
depth phylogenetic branches; moreover, we can infer their
relative time of insertion, that is, the most ancient branch in
the tree topology that shares a putative horizontally acquired
(PHA) gene present only in descendant lineages. Based on
this principle, Daubin and Ochman [9] identified sequences
unique to monophyletic groups at increasing phylogenetic
depths, and studied the characteristics of sequences with no
detectable database match (ORFans) using E. coli MG1655 as
a reference genome.
A key step in inferring the relative time of insertion of PHA
genes is the construction of phylogenetic trees that will capture reliably the evolutionary history of the organisms at
hand. rRNA genes have been extensively used as molecular
chronometers for inferring the phylogeny and building tree
topologies [10]. However, it has been shown that even these
traditionally core components of the cell can be horizontally
transferred [4,5]. Consequently more reliable phylogenies
can be built based on approaches exploiting larger sequence
samples, for example, whole-genome sequence [11,12]. Moreover, homologous recombination might well complicate the
inference of the true evolutionary history of the genomes
under study [12,13]. Many closely related bacteria exchange a

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R100

significant amount of DNA sequence via homologous recombination through highly similar patches throughout their
genome sequence [14]. Therefore, different regions within
those genomes might well have different evolutionary histories that cannot be reliable captured by phylogenies relying
on a single tree topology [12].
In the following section, we describe a comparative analysis
between eleven Salmonella, three E. coli and one Shigella
strain in order to infer the relative time of insertion of putative HGT events in three strains of the S. enterica lineage by
implementing a whole-genome sequence based alignment to
construct the phylogenetic tree topology of the organisms
under study. The relative time of insertion is inferred taking
into account the most parsimonious sequence of events, that
is, allowing for deletions or independent acquisitions in some
of the descendant or ancestral branches. Moreover, we discuss and analyze data suggesting that prophages in the Salmonella lineage are shared only between very recently
diverged lineages but that their sequence composition is very
similar to their host's. Finally, we describe the implementation of G+C content, the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) [15]
and high order compositional vectors [16] in order to monitor
the amelioration process over time.

Results
Time distribution of PHA genes
In order to construct the tree topology that best describes the
phylogenetic history of the strains studied in this analysis, we
implemented the neighbor joining (NJ) [17] and the maximum likelihood (ML) [18] methods. Interestingly, all four
substitution models for the NJ method (with and without the
γ-correction) and the ML method resulted in identical tree
topology (Figures 1 and 2). These data suggest that, using
whole-genome sequence information, the true phylogeny of
the organisms at hand can be captured reliably (see Discussion for more details).
For each of the three query genomes we inferred the total
number of PHA genes, as well as their relative time of insertion (Additional data files 1-3). The results are summarized in
Table 1 and Figure 2. Using each of the three query genomes,
on the branches prior to nodes 1, 2 and 3, we inferred similar
numbers of PHA genes for the corresponding relative time of
insertion (for the sake of simplicity, from this point on we will
refer to the branch prior to node X as branch X). The different
number of PHA genes is principally due to small differences
in the number of genes in each genome (insertions, deletions,
gene remnants) as well as differences in the genome annotation. From this point on we assign on branches 1, 2 and 3 the
intersection of the respective number of genes determined on
each branch using each one of the three query genomes. Overall, this reciprocal FASTA analysis suggests that approximately 2,500 orthologous genes form a core gene dataset
shared by all the 11 Salmonella strains; this number reduces

Inferred1
Inferred relative time of insertion of putative horizontally acquired genes, using Typhi CT18 as the query genome. The reference tree topology, based on
whole-genome sequence alignment, is shown in the upper section of the figure, with the pseudo-code describing the algorithm for inferring the relative
time of insertion shown at the bottom. Node 1 predates the Bongori-Arizonae-Enterica lineage. Node 2 predates the Arizonae-Enterica lineage. Node 3
predates the S. enterica lineage. Nodes descendant of node 3 are inferred relative to the query genome: node 4[TS] (Typhoidal Salmonella) predates the
Typhi-Paratyphi A lineage, and node 4[NTS] (non-Typhoidal Salmonella) predates the Typhimurium-Enteritidis-Gallinarum lineage. Node 5[STY] (STY: S. typhi)
predates the CT18-TY2 lineage, node 5[SPA] (SPA: S. paratyphi A) predates the SARB42 - AKU_12601 lineage, and node 5[STM] (STM: S. typhimurium)
predates the SL1344-DT104-LT2 lineage. (Note on node 6, relative to LT2: for a fully resolved tree, that is, with fully bifurcating topologies, polytomies,
for example, trichotomies, are not allowed. Although Typhimurium LT2 and DT104 are assigned in the same node (node 6), with SL1344 in an apparently
separate branch under node 5[STM], the three Typhimurium strains are very close phylogenetically; moreover, there are no genes restricted on branch 6,
that is, genes shared between LT2 and DT104 that are absent from SL1344. For these reasons, throughout this analysis, node 6, relative to LT2, is ignored
and node 5[STM] is considered to be the Typhimurium lineage-specific node.)

determined on each branch using one of the three query genomes; the same applies for genes assigned to branch 4[TS].

On branch 4[TS], which predates the Typhi-Paratyphi A divergence, overall, 24% of genes have unknown functions, 26%
encode cell surface-related components, 11% are remnants/
pseudogenes and 24% are related to pathogenicity or adaptation (Additional data file 5). Also on this branch are the CDSs
of a previously uncharacterized 8.5 kb genomic island (GI;
position 2,187,521-2,195,992 bp; Additional data file 6) of
very low G+C (36.29%) content that encodes 16 CDSs
(STY2349-STY2364 in CT18) of unknown function without
significant similarity to previously annotated CDSs. Furthermore, this novel GI does not have any of the 'classic' GIrelated features, for example, direct/inverted repeats, an
integrase gene or insertion adjacent to an RNA locus. Details
about the composition of this putative GI and other genes
assigned to branch 4[TS] will be discussed in the following
section.

In a previous study, Thomson et al. [22] provided data showing that many prophage structures present in Typhi CT18 are
predicted to be Typhi-specific, further suggesting that these
bacteriophages have a level of specialization for their host and
play a key role in generating genetic diversity in the S. enterica lineage. Moreover, the same authors suggested that Typhi
has indeed a unique pool of prophage elements that distinguish it from other serovars, in contrast with the Salmonella
specific SPIs, which show a wider distribution within the Salmonella lineage [23].

Implementing a classification of 14 functional classes (listed
in Figure 2), we were able to assign each of the PHA genes,
with a given relative time of insertion, into one of the 14 colorcoded functional classes. The results are summarized, via pie
charts assigned to each branch, in Figure 2. Overall, from this
functional classification, it is clear that PHA genes on
branches 1-3, branch 4[TS] (Typhoidal Salmonella) and
branch 4[NTS] (non-Typhoidal Salmonella) show a wide distribution over almost all the 13 functional classes (for example,
cell-surface, regulation, central metabolism, pathogenicity),
while gene remnants/pseudogenes are mainly restricted to

Functional analysis of PHA genes

refereed research

On branch 3 (S. enterica lineage), there are 249 inferred PHA
genes. On this branch are found SPIs that are restricted to the
S. enterica lineage, such as part of SPI-3 (3' end), part of SPI10 (fimbrial-sef operon), SPI-6, SPI-16 and SPI-17. Finally, on
more recent branches, that is, branch 5[STY] (STY: S. typhi),
branch 5[SPA] (SPA: S. paratyphi A), branch 5[STM] (STM: S.
typhimurium) and strain-specific genes (relative to each of
the three query genomes), we have inferred a significant
number of putative HGT events, which are mainly dominated
by CDSs that belong to annotated prophage structures (discussed in more detail below).

The functional analysis of the PHA genes assigned to recent
branches (branches 5[STY], 5[SPA], 5[STM] and strain-specific) is
in line with a previous study focused on E. coli MG1655 showing that Insertion Sequence (IS) elements and prophage remnants represent mostly very recent insertion events in
MG1655 [21]; the same study suggests that very few acquired
DNA sequences are maintained for more than 10 Myr in the
genome of E. coli MG1655. In the current study, no complete,
intact prophage structures inserted at the base of the Salmonella lineage are present in all 11 Salmonella strains, nor are
there any prophages inserted in the S. enterica lineage that
are shared between the Typhi, Paratyphi A and the
Typhimurium strains. Using Typhi CT18 as a query genome,
on branch 5[STY], 67% (231) of CDSs belong to prophage structures, while 93% (71) CT18-restricted CDSs are of phage origin. Similarly, in the case of Typhimurium LT2, 57% and 98%
of genes that are on branch 5[STM] and LT2-restricted, respectively, belong to annotated prophage structure. In the lineage
of Paratyphi A, 85% of CDSs acquired on branch 5[SPA] are of
phage origin; interestingly, there are no SARB42-specific
CDSs relative to Paratyphi A AKU_12601.

deposited research

The cob operon of S. enterica, which encodes vitamin B12
biosynthesis, has been previously shown to be horizontally
acquired in the Salmonella lineage following its divergence
from the E. coli lineage [19,20]. In a later study, Lawrence and
Ochman [3] showed, using a model of reverse amelioration,
that the cob operon was probably introduced into the Salmonella lineage 71 Myr ago. The current analysis assigned the
cob operon to branch 2, which predates the divergence of S.
arizonae from the S. enterica lineage. Based on the data available, we can infer that the divergence of S. arizonae from the
S. enterica lineage occurred approximately 100-71 Myr ago,
and further suggest that the 120 inferred PHA genes assigned
to branch 2 have an absolute time of insertion of the same
order of magnitude.

reports

This analysis revealed a surprisingly high number of 434 PHA
genes inserted at the base of the Salmonella lineage (branch
1). Based on two independent previous studies [1,2] the divergence of the E. coli and Salmonella lineage occurred approximately 100-140 Myr ago. Consequently, putative HGT events
on branch 1 represent ancient insertions, close to the divergence of these two lineages and include 76 coding sequences
(CDSs) of 'ancient' SPIs, such as SPI-5, SPI-4, a part of SPI-2
(ttr-region), SPI-9, SPI-1 and a part of SPI-3 (magnesium
transport ATPase - mgt region).

Moreover, CDSs that belong to annotated structures of

Daubin and Ochman [9].

Vernikos et al.

Generally, in microbial genomes, some PHA genes are
retained over long evolutionary distances and, therefore,
contribute to species diversification [24,25], while PHA genes
that might be detrimental, or not advantageous, for the host
are rapidly removed [21,26]. Horizontally acquired DNA is
more likely to be deleted than are native, core genes; for
example, prophage structures often harbor direct repeats
forming their endpoints (that is, attL and attR) that can, via
homologous recombination, be used to efficiently remove
those 'parasitic' elements. Furthermore, some prophage
genes can be detrimental (for example, the N gene of bacteriophage λ), neutral (for example, integrases) or advantageous
(for example, immunity repressors) [26]. Based on this
model, parasitic-detrimental DNA sequences (for example,
prophage elements) are removed before killing the cell [26].
This bias of deletion over insertion [27] can equilibrate HGT
events, and this is further supported by the comparable
genome size of closely related genomes [28]. Overall, the current study suggests that, indeed, prophage structures cannot
be retained for a long time in the Salmonella lineage, while
complete, intact prophage structures represent very recent
insertions in the Typhi, Paratyphi A and Typhimurium lineages, which, based on their impact (detrimental, neutral or
advantageous) on the host, will eventually be retained or
removed from those genomes.

Compositional analysis of PHA genes
The aim of the compositional analysis in this study was to
determine if there is any clear trend for genes assigned to relatively old branches in the reference tree topology to show
sequence composition closer (compared to more recent insertions) to the average composition of the host genome, thus
supporting the effect of amelioration as a time-dependent
process. It should be noted that because this analysis is
focused on the effects of the amelioration in the Salmonella
lineage, which diverged fairly recently from E. coli and the
rest of the enteric bacteria, we expect to identify, if any, mild
effects of the amelioration on the sequence composition of the
gene datasets under study. For example, Daubin and Ochman
[9], applying a similar approach on a much broader phylogenetic sample (the γ-Proteobacteria), showed a strong correlation between the G+C content and different phylogenetic
depths in their reference tree topology.
As a starting point for the compositional analysis of PHA
genes, we applied the alien_hunter algorithm, which implements the interpolated variable order motifs (IVOMs)

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R100

method [16], to the three query genomes, and performed a
benchmarking analysis of its sensitivity versus the inferred
relative time of insertion of PHA genes; the results are summarized in Figure 3. Overall, it can be concluded that the sensitivity of this HGT prediction method correlates strongly
with the relative time of insertion. Indeed, in all the three
query genomes, regression analysis showed a correlation
(0.45 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.75) between the sensitivity and the relative time
of insertion. For example, PHA genes inserted at the base of
the Salmonella lineage (for example, on branch 1) can be
identified with a false negative (FN) rate of 0.55 while more
recent insertions have a much lower FN rate of 0-0.2. It is
worth noting that the high sensitivity of alien_hunter on very
recent branches is in contrast with the drop in the IVOMs
score distribution (Figure 4); the majority of the PHA genes
assigned to these branches belong to prophage structures
and, consequently, their clustering and not their composition
should mainly explain the high sensitivity of this algorithm on
these branches. It is important to mention that the analysis of
the sensitivity of this algorithm relies on the assumption that
all the PHA genes identified in the current analysis are true
horizontally acquired genes and the conclusions drawn about
its performance are specific for this set of PHA genes.
Using the G+C content, both overall and codon position specific, as well as higher order compositional biases implementing the IVOMs method, we were able to monitor the
amelioration process versus the relative time of insertion of
PHA genes (Figures 4 and 5). Using Typhi CT18 and Paratyphi A SARB42 as query genomes, this analysis revealed that
there is a clear correlation (R2 = 0.98 for branches 1-3, R2 =
0.65 for branches 1-4[TS]) between the G+C content or the
IVOMs score of PHA genes and the relative time of their
insertion on the earlier branches; however, this strong correlation seems to 'break down' in the case of very recent putative
HGT events, that is, insertions that took place after the divergence of Typhi and Paratyphi A lineages (Figures 4 and 5). For
example, genes assigned to branches 1 and 2 show average
G+C content of 51.4% and 50.6%, respectively, close to the
average gene G+C content of 53.2% and 53.3% (for CT18 and
SARB42, respectively). The same observation becomes much
clearer when calculating higher order compositional biases
(Figure 4). Based on the IVOMs score, genes on branches 1
and 2 have average scores of 0.06 and 0.063, respectively,
while more recently acquired genes, that is, on branches 3 and
4[TS], have scores of 0.072 and 0.093, respectively; the average, genome-wide IVOMs score in Typhi CT18 is 0.059.

Interestingly, branches descendant of nodes 4[TS] and 4[NTS]
are dominated by genes of phage origin (57% to 98% of genes
at the given relative time of insertion; Figure 2). For example,
on branch 5[STY], 67% of Typhi CT18 genes assigned to this
branch belong to one of the six prophage structures present
both in Typhi CT18 and TY2. On branch 5[STY], the G+C content of SPI-7 and the phage-related gene is 50.87% and
51.98%, respectively. In a previous study, it was shown that
the last common ancestor of Typhi existed 15,000-150,000
years ago, during the human hunter-gatherer period [30];
consequently, PHA genes assigned to branch 5[STY] have a
time of insertion of the same order of magnitude. Similarly, in
Typhimurium LT2, there are two prophage (Fels-1, Fels-2)
structures that represent very recent acquisitions (LT2-specific), and are absent from the other two Typhimurium
strains. CDSs of these prophage elements have an average
G+C content of 53.57% and 52.94%, respectively, while their
CAI value is 0.307, very close to the LT2 genome average CAI
of 0.313.

deposited research

Codon usage analysis revealed that genes on branch 4[TS]
show a bias towards A+T rich codons (Additional data file 7).
For example, the 'AAA' codon is overrepresented in CDSs of
this branch, compared to its average frequency in the
genome; the AAA codon (encoding lysine) has been previously shown to be overrepresented in highly expressed genes
[15]. To test further whether genes on this branch deviate
compositionally due to their highly expressed pattern, rather
than their alien origin, we performed a CAI analysis (summarized in Table 2). It can be clearly seen that genes on branch
4[TS] deviate compositionally from the genome background
composition, more likely due to their alien origin, rather than
their high rate of expression, representing the 'left ear' in the
'rabbit-like' codon bias versus CAI plot described in [29].
Indeed, genes on branch 4[TS] show an average CAI value of
0.221, significantly lower (p value = 4.95 10-13) than the average gene CAI value (= 0.31) and much lower than the CAI values of highly expressed genes, for example, the genes
encoding for ribosomal proteins (CT18, 0.554; SARB42,

reports

PHA genes assigned to branch 4[TS] on the Typhi-Paratyphi A
lineage show a very strong compositional deviation, indicated
both by their very low G+C content of 43.3% (gene average:
53.2%) and the IVOMs score of 0.093 (genome average:
0.059). Furthermore, the codon-position specific G+C content of genes assigned to branch 4[TS] deviate strongly (GC1 =
49%, GC2 = 37%, GC3 = 43%; Figure 6) from the expected
values (GC1 = 59%, GC2 = 41%, GC3 = 56%, respectively) based
on the three linear equations provided by Lawrence and Ochman [3] (see equations 13, 14 and 15 therein). The G+C content of the second codon position is generally very
constrained to similar values across species [3], given that
most possible nucleotide substitutions would result in a
change in the encoded amino acid residue (non-synonymous
substitutions). Interestingly, genes assigned to branch 4[TS] in
the Typhi-Paratyphi A lineage also show a significant deviation in this compositionally well-conserved codon position,
possibly suggesting a distantly related donor genome.

Overall, using any of the three query genomes (CT18,
SARB42, LT2), this analysis indicates that very recent acquisitions, for example, on branches 5[STY], 5[SPA], 5[STM], seem to
have been 'ameliorated' to an equal degree as acquisitions on
older branches, for example, branches 1 and 2; moreover, in
the case of the LT2 genome, strain specific acquisitions (see
the LT2 branch) show sequence composition very close to the
genome composition. Very recent acquisitions are expected to
deviate strongly from the host backbone composition, unless
the donor is very close compositionally to the host. Amelioration, a time-dependent process, can not have significantly
affected their sequence composition, which should still reflect
mostly the donor rather than the host specific compositional
signature. However, recent acquisitions identified in this
study either show very close composition to the host backbone composition (for example, PHA genes on the LT2
branch have an average G+C content of 53.26%, very close to
the gene average G+C content of 53.33%), or deviate compositionally to an equal degree as PHA genes acquired on older
branches (for example, the G+C content of PHA genes in
CT18 on branches 1 and 5[STY] is 51.4 and 51.3, respectively).
Similarly, the G+C content of PHA genes in SARB42 on
branches 2 and 5[SPA] is 50.6% and 50.2%, respectively.

reviews

A similar observation can be made for Typhimurium LT2.
More specifically, there is a very strong correlation (R2 =
0.89) between G+C content or IVOMs score and the relative
time of insertion, which breaks-down on branches descendent of node 3 (Figure 4 and 5). More specifically, the average
G+C content of genes assigned to branches 1, 2 and 3, is
51.5%, 50% and 49.6%, respectively, while for genes on
branch 4[NTS], the average G+C content is 49.7%. Similarly,
using the IVOMs method, the corresponding scores for the
four branches are 0.059, 0.066, 0.069 and 0.064,
respectively.

related enteric outgroup genomes: Erwinia carotovora
SCRI1043 (EMBL: BX950851) [31], Yersinia enterocolitica
8081 (EMBL: AM286415) [32] and Y. pseudotuberculosis
IP32953 (EMBL: BX936398) [33]. Less than 5% of the 434
PHA genes inferred to have been acquired on branch 1 have
orthologous genes present in this distant outgroup (data not
shown). These data suggest that the majority (>95%) of the
434 PHA genes most likely represent true HGT events that
occurred quite early in the evolution of the Salmonella lineage, rather than deletion events in the E. coli lineage.

reviews

The aim of this analysis was to study the distribution of PHA
genes in a time-dependent manner, that is, to infer the relative time of insertion based on the reference tree topology,
throughout the Salmonella lineage, applying an extensive
comparative analysis between eleven Salmonella, three E.
coli and one Shigella strain. The selection of four genome
sequences that form an outgroup of the Salmonella lineage
was made in order to differentiate more reliably gene loss
from gene gain, two mechanisms that could explain the
presence of a gene in one lineage and its absence from a sister,
closely related lineage. However, because the E. coli and Salmonella lineages represent very closely related, sister lineages, the 434 PHA genes inferred to have been acquired at the
base of the Salmonella lineage might equally represent deletion events in the E. coli lineage subsequent to the common
ancestor with Salmonella. To investigate further this

cal tree topologies, inferring the same phylogenetic history
for the query genomes at hand. However, care should be
taken when interpreting whole-genome sequence based phylogenies, since extensive HGT events, homologous recombination or other homoplastic events might well obscure the
true phylogenetic histories of the genomes under study [12],
whose phylogenies may, therefore, be more efficiently
described using phylogenetic nets rather than single tree
topologies [11,34,35]. It is worth noting that whole-genome
based phylogenetic approaches capture the 'overall' phylogenetic signal based on whole chromosome sequences. In the
case of very closely related organisms, for example, strains of
the same serovar, minor differences in terms of gene content
(for example, prophages, GIs) cannot be reliably represented
in the 'overall' phylogenetic signal. In other words, whole
genome-based phylogenies focusing on a wide range of
strains may suffer from low resolution in the case of very
closely related genomes. Moreover, mobile elements may
show similarity on the sequence level (for example,
prophages) but differ on the structural level (that is, different
phage types). Relying on sequence information only, these
seemingly similar mobile elements will bias the relatedness of
closely related strains (for example, the three Typhimurium
strains used in this study).
The reason why we pursued a comparative rather than a compositional based approach (that is, defining PHA genes based
simply on their compositional deviation, but ignoring their
distribution throughout the lineage of interest) was the fact
that compositional based approaches frequently underestimate the true number of HGT events [3], either due to the
amelioration process, in the case of ancient insertions, or due
to compositionally similar donor genomes, in the case of new
insertions. The current comparative analysis suggests that
approximately 30%, 25% and 28% of protein-coding
sequences in Typhi CT18, Paratyphi A SARB42 and Typhimurium LT2, respectively, represent putative HGT events. The

distribution of these PHA genes on different branches of the
reference tree topology reveals that approximately 35% to
40% of them were acquired at the base of the Salmonella lineage (branch 1), very close to its divergence from E. coli,
reflecting perhaps the acquisition of genes that enabled the
exploration of new niches, for example, the acquisition of
SPI-1, which enabled Salmonella to invade epithelial cells
[36]. Moreover, 20% of those genes were acquired at the base
of the S. enterica lineage (branch 3); overall, 60% to 70%
were inserted after the divergence of the Salmonella from the
E. coli lineage and prior to the divergence of the S. enterica
subspecies. This suggests that approximately 60% to 70% of
the putative HGT events are probably shared between most of
the subspecies of the S. enterica lineage.
Based on the functional classification of genes assigned to
branches 1, 2 and 3 that predate the S. enterica lineage, it
becomes evident that, generally, genes within almost all functional classes, for example, regulation, energy metabolism,
cell surface, and virulence-related, have been horizontally
acquired. Moreover, genes on branches 1, 2 and 3 show a
significant correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.70.92) in the percentage of the corresponding functional
classes. For example, there is a fairly constant percentage of
genes encoding cell-surface structures (18% to 28%), genes
related to pathogenicity and adaptation (22% to 29%) and
regulatory elements (4% to 8%). Furthermore, the percentage
of genes with unknown function ranges from 8% to 18%,
while fragmented gene remnants (pseudogenes) account for
6% and 11% on branches 3 and 4[TS], respectively, with almost
no pseudogenes (<0.1%) on branches 1 and 2. The increased
number of genes acquired at the base of the S. enterica lineage that have been inactivated suggests that some of these
early acquired functions are no longer necessary, and are
being lost in these serovars. The increased number of pseudogenes (11%) in the Typhi-Paratyphi A lineage that are absent
from the Typhimurium lineage supports a genome degrada-

information

For the 15 genomes analyzed in this study (Table 3), we implemented a whole-genome sequence based alignment
approach. Whole genome sequence alignments were made
using the MAUVE algorithm [39]. For the construction of the
reference tree topology we implemented modules of the
PHYLIP package, version 3.65 [40]. More specifically, we
used the DNADIST module, which uses nucleotide sequences
to compute a distance matrix, under four different models of
nucleotide substitution: those of Jukes and Cantor [41] and
Kimura [42], the F84 model [18,43], and the model underlying the LogDet distance [44]. For the first three models we
used also the γ-based method for correcting the rate heterogeneity among sites. We also used the NEIGHBOR module,
which implements the NJ method of Saitou and Nei [17], and
the DNAML module, which implements the ML method for
DNA sequences [18], using the γ-based method. In order to
compare the tree topologies obtained, we used the TREEDIST
module, which computes tree distances using either branch
lengths or node topologies. For the γ-based method, we
determined the α parameter from the datasets, using the
TREE-PUZZLE method [45]. The trees obtained were drawn
using the TREEVIEW software [46].

Overall, the current analysis has shown that the impact of
amelioration, a time-dependent process, is still detectable
even in fairly recent HGT events, for example, that occurred
100-140 Myr ago. Moreover it sheds more light on the relative
time of insertion of HGT events in the Salmonella lineage,

Conclusion

Materials and methods

deposited research

If we take into account both the absence of complete, intact
prophage structures from old branches (1-3, 4[TS] and 4[NTS]),
and the significant compositional similarity of those
prophage-related genes to the host sequence composition,
when the effects of the amelioration process are expected to
be mild, it would be tempting to speculate that prophage elements in the Salmonella lineage have undergone an adaptation to specific serotypes. However, this hypothesis does not
explain why anciently inserted prophages, for example, those
inserted at the base of Salmonella lineage prior to the divergence of S. bongori and S. arizonae from the S. enterica, have
not been retained in descendent lineages, for example, the
Typhi, Paratyphi A and Typhimurium strains. Perhaps
anciently inserted bacteriophages at the base of the Salmonella lineage carried genes that were either neutral or detrimental, providing no profound advantage to the host, and
over time the host has lost those parasitic elements via a deletion process that has left behind molecular fossils of those elements. This observation is further supported by the absence
of pseudogenes on very old branches, that is, branches 1 and
2; perhaps the ongoing time-dependent process of deleting
redundant or detrimental DNA sequence has already
removed a much higher proportion of pseudogenes on very
old branches, compared to recent ones, further suggesting
that genome degradation is still a continuous process in the
Salmonella lineage [26].

The prophage elements present in the Salmonella lineage
show a very close sequence composition to the host-specific
background composition, strongly suggesting that those parasitic elements have specialized and adapted to their hosts,
playing a key role in driving bacterial evolution [22], or even
speciation itself, supporting the notion of 'evolution in quantum leaps' introduced by Groisman and Ochman [38]. Overall, the distribution of PHA genes in the Salmonella lineage
coincides strongly with the divergence of the major Salmonella species, underlining the major impact of horizontal
transfer on the evolution of the salmonellae.

reports

Whether this last observation is related to an ongoing genome
degradation process that over time removes redundant or
detrimental DNA sequences, equilibrating the horizontal
influx of genes and maintaining a fairly constant genome
sequence size, still remains to be clarified. Perhaps the study
of the very recently acquired prophage elements that seem to
account for the majority of the strain or serovar specific genes
[22,37], and their impact (detrimental, neutral, advantageous) on the evolution, life-style and host adaptation of the
Salmonella strains might shed more light on the underlying
principles of the observed genome degradation process.

reviews

The compositional analysis of the inferred PHA genes indicates that there is indeed a strong correlation between the
time of insertion and amelioration towards the host-specific
genomic signature. In other words, anciently horizontally
acquired genes have ameliorated more towards the host composition, compared to more recent acquisitions. However,
even HGT events inferred to have inserted at the base of the
Salmonella lineage still preserve some of their donor genome
sequence signature, as indicated by their overall and codonposition specific G+C content, suggesting that these genes are
still undergoing the amelioration process. On the other hand,
in the case of very recent acquisitions that represent mostly
insertion of prophage elements, it seems that their sequence
composition is already much closer to the host background
composition, presumably not due to the amelioration process, since they have been acquired fairly recently, but rather
due to an adaptation to the specific sequence signature of the
their host.

against each of the other fourteen genomes (Table 3). We took
the following approach in order to infer the orthologous genes
in each pair of genomes compared: Each CDS (a) from the
genome (A) was searched, using FASTA [47], against the
CDSs of the other genome (B). If the top hit covered at least
80% of the length of both sequences with at least 30% identity, a reciprocal FASTA search of the top hit sequence (b) was
launched against the CDSs of the first genome. If the reciprocal top hit was the same as the original query CDS then (a)
and (b) are considered orthologous genes of (A) and (B). In a
second step, in order to validate the results, we performed a
BLASTN and TBLASTX comparison between the 15 genomes,
visualized using ACT [48] to curate ambiguous cases, for
example, gene remnants (pseudogenes), IS elements and
phage-related CDSs, and to check for a syntenic relationship
among the putative orthologs.

Relative time of insertion of PHA genes
In order to differentiate more reliably gene loss from gene
gain (HGT), we used a genomic dataset of three E. coli and
one S. flexneri strain that forms the outgroup lineage in our
reference tree topology. For example, a gene that is present in
the Salmonella lineage and absent from E. coli MG1655 might
well be either a true HGT in the former or deletion in the latter. However, if, for example, the same gene is also present in
E. coli EDL933 and E. coli CFT073, then we can infer more
reliably that this event probably represents a deletion (in E.
coli MG1655) rather than a true HGT in the Salmonella lineage. Conversely, a sequence that is confined to one lineage is
more likely to have been horizontally acquired than to have
been deleted independently from multiple lineages [21]. A
pseudo-code of the algorithm applied in order to infer the relative time of insertion of PHA genes, using Typhi CT18 as a

query genome, is described in Figure 1. The same approach
was followed using Paratyphi A SARB42 and Typhimurium
LT2 as query genomes. The table embedded at the bottom of
Figure 1 summarizes the parameters used in this study to differentiate gene loss from gene gains events, assuming a maximum parsimony evolutionary model. For example, in the
case of CT18, a gene X that has no orthologue in the four outgroups and the S. bongori genome but has orthologs in the
other nine genomes is more likely to have been acquired on
branch 2 (node 2 assignment in Figure 1). Similarly, a gene X
in CT18 that has orthologs only in the four outgroup genomes
is more likely to represent an independent HGT event in
CT18, rather than the result of multiple deletions in the other
ten genomes (CT18 assignment in Figure 1).

Compositional analysis
In order to monitor the level of amelioration with respect to
the inferred relative time of insertion for each gene in each of
the three query genomes, we calculated the overall as well as
the codon-position specific G+C content. Furthermore, to
increase the sensitivity of capturing compositionally deviating genes, for example, genes that do not deviate in terms of
G+C content but show higher order compositional bias, we
implemented the IVOMs method [16]. To differentiate highly
expressed from horizontally acquired genes that deviate compositionally, we also performed a CAI analysis, measuring the
adaptation of each gene to the codon usage of a reference set
of highly expressed genes, proposed by Sharp and Li [49].

tive time of insertion. Additional file 2 lists the 1,271 PHA
genes identified in the S. typhimurium LT2 genome and their
relative time of insertion. Additional file 3 lists the 1,011 PHA
genes identified in the S. paratyphi A SARB42 genome and
their relative time of insertion. Additional file 4 shows the
core gene dataset. The Venn diagram illustrates the orthologous genes shared between all the 11 Salmonella strains (bold
circle in the middle) and the genomes of E. coli MG1655, E.
coli EDL933, E. coli CFT073 and S. flexneri 2a 301. The
number highlighted in bold, represents the total number of
orthologues genes (core genes) shared between the 15
genomes used in this study. Additional file 5 provides a summary of the functional classification of genes assigned to
branch 4[TS], relative to the Typhi-Paratyphi A lineage, using
14 functional classes. The color code for each functional class
is detailed at the bottom left of this file. Additional file 6
shows the novel genomic island. The ACT screenshot is of a
tBLASTX comparison between five selected Salmonella
genomes (from top to bottom): S. typhi CT18, S. paratyphi A
SARB42, S. typhimurium LT2, S. enteritidis PT4 and S. gallinarum 287/91. Regions within the five genomes with
sequence similarity are joined with red colored bands representing the matching regions. The putative GI that is present
in Typhi and Paratyphi A genomes is illustrated as a white
box. Above the genome of Typhi CT18, the G+C content graph
is plotted, with a 0.5 kb sliding window. Additional file 7
shows the codon usage difference of CDSs assigned on branch
4[TS] relative to the average codon usage in Typhi CT18. Positive values in the Y axis indicate overrepresentation (bluecolored bars) of certain codons in CDSs of this branch relative
to the average codon usage and vice versa.
