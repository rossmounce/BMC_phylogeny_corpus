Abstract
Background: Cancer cells are characterized by massive dysegulation of physiological cell functions with
considerable disruption of transcriptional regulation. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling can be utilized for early
detection and molecular classification of cancers. Accurate discrimination of functionally different tumor types may
help to guide selection of targeted therapy in translational research. Concise grouping of tumor types in cancer
maps according to their molecular profile may further be helpful for the development of new therapeutic
modalities or open new avenues for already established therapies.
Methods: Complete available human tumor data of the Stanford Microarray Database was downloaded and
filtered for relevance, adequacy and reliability. A total of 649 tumor samples from more than 1400 experiments and
58 different tissues were analyzed. Next, a method to score deregulation of KEGG pathway maps in different tumor
entities was established, which was then used to convert hundreds of gene expression profiles into corresponding
tumor-specific pathway activity profiles. Based on the latter, we defined a measure for functional similarity between
tumor entities, which yielded to phylogeny of tumors.
Results: We provide a comprehensive, easy-to-interpret functional cancer map that characterizes tumor types with
respect to their biological and functional behavior. Consistently, multiple pathways commonly associated with
tumor progression were revealed as common features in the majority of the tumors. However, several pathways
previously not linked to carcinogenesis were identified in multiple cancers suggesting an essential role of these
pathways in cancer biology. Among these pathways were ‘ECM-receptor interaction’, ‘Complement and
Coagulation cascades’, and ‘PPAR signaling pathway’.
Conclusion: The functional cancer map provides a systematic view on molecular similarities across different
cancers by comparing tumors on the level of pathway activity. This work resulted in identification of novel
superimposed functional pathways potentially linked to cancer biology. Therefore, our work may serve as a starting
point for rationalizing combination of tumor therapeutics as well as for expanding the application of wellestablished targeted tumor therapies.

Background
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death [1]. If segregated by age, cancer, has even surpassed the mortality
of heart diseases and has become the deadliest disease
in the world, with 12.7 million new cases and 7.6 million deaths worldwide [2]. Furthermore, due to the steadily increase in aging and expansion of the world’s

population an ongoing increase also in the burden of
cancer is predicted for the next decades [2]. Nevertheless, since the year 1990, cancer death rate continuously
declined despite increasing numbers of new cancer cases
[1], indicating the improvements in diagnostics and
development of novel more effective therapies. Therein
gene expression profiling made a considerable contribution. This technology can be used to classify diverse
types of tumors [3,4] and predict outcome of patients
[5-7] as well as response to chemotherapies [8,9].

Several studies utilized global transcriptome and genome
profiling to identify phenotypically similar cancers
[10-12]. Segal et al. successfully introduced a module
map for cancers [11], consisting of gene sets that act in
concert to carry out specific function. More recently, a
meta-analyses tool for different cancer tissues was established [10]. All of these studies revealed associations
between molecular profiles and biological behavior of
different tumors, without a detailed integration of regulated genes and signaling pathways. Utilization of these
functional associations to place global transcriptome
data in a biological context might significantly improve
the limited knowledge about common molecular
changes across different tumor types.
Here, we employed an extensive functional genomics
approach to analyze gene expression profiles of the complete human cancer related microarray datasets from the
Stanford Microarray Database [13]. Our aim was to
develop a functional cancer map focusing on signaling
and metabolic events across multiple cancer types to provide a deeper understanding of common and distinct
molecular mechanisms leading to carcinogenesis. This
novel approach provides a systematic and unbiased view
on cancer development by investigating signaling pathways and functional networks in an easy-to-interpret
way. In addition, we demonstrate tumor phylogeny based
on semantic aggregated profiles by identifying tumor
mechanisms of individual tumor entities from publically
available gene expression data. Our analysis revealed
important signaling pathways commonly dysregulated in
several tumor entities. These results could serve as a
starting point for the efficient combination of tumor
therapeutics as well as for expanding the application area
of well-established tumor therapies.

Methods
Gene expression data

Gene expression data were obtained from microarray
experiments, downloaded from the Stanford Microarray
Database [13]. Ignoring cell line and time course experiments, we collected a dataset of 1402 human two-color
cDNA microarrays corresponding to 58 discrete tissues
types and about 15000 individual genes. Screening for
tumor relevant information in our dataset resulted in 836
tumor arrays, which could be assigned to 33 tumor tissue
types defined as tumor entities in our analysis. Additionally 16 tumor classes were allocated to tumor entities
representing the tumor differentiation and developmental
origin of the tissue, e.g. tumor entities ‘Prostate Tumor,
Grade T2b’, ‘Prostate Tumor, Grade T3a’ and ‘Prostate
Tumor, Grade 3b’ were assigned to the tumor class ‘Prostate’. Downloaded microarray experiments had been analyzed against diverse human controls [13]. In order to
avoid divergence due to diverse control data sets, we

Page 2 of 10

filtered all tumor classes for common applied controls
used in the respective microarray experiments. We always
used those data with the largest number of individual
datasets with the same one control per tumor class for
further evaluation. All other data were discarded. Finally
our dataset was reduced to 649 microarrays belonging to
28 tumor entities respectively 16 tumor classes, which
were analyzed with the R Project statistical software [14]
to identify differentially expressed genes as follows:
Initially the raw data were loaded into R, invalid cDNA
probes removed (e.g. flag ‘contaminated’ or ‘failed’) and a
background correction was applied. After the calculation
of the log2 fold changes relative to the control RNA the
quantile normalization was applied to each experiment. In
all these initial steps we made use of the ‘limma’ R package
[15]. Next, we calculated the variance as well as mean for
each gene within the corresponding tumor entities. Moreover, the pooled variance for each gene was calculated to
identify global outliers. Pooled variance was defined as
weighted mean of the variances within each tumor entity
and weighted by the relative sizes of the respective entity.
Genes (426 in total) with a pooled variance of all genes
greater than the third interquartile range of the pooled
variance (3iQR = 0.038) were defined as outliers and
excluded from further analysis, to ensure the comparability and correct technical bias due to heterogeneity of the
dataset. Additionally, tumor entity specific outliers were
eliminated by considering those genes whose variance
were greater than the 3iQR of the corresponding tumor
entity; depending on tumor entity between 364 and 1053
genes were excluded from the dataset.
A gene was considered upregulated (respectively
downregulated) if it had a M-value > 1.0 (resp. < -1.0)
and a p-value smaller than 0.01 in a one sided one-sample t-test. This procedure defined between 391 and 1433
up- and between 424 and 2150 downregulated tumor
associated genes (figure 1a). Note: Although the p-values
produced this way are merely used as a score and are
not interpreted as type-1 error rates, it might be interesting to assess the significance of the individual tests.
We therefore performed an FDR correction using “p.
adjust” and provided the list of multiple testing corrected p-values in the additional files (Additional file 1).
Functional data

Metabolic reaction and signaling event information were
acquired from the PATHWAY database of the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [16].
These pathway maps and pathway modules are categorized into metabolism, genetic information processing,
environmental information processing, cellular process,
organismal systems and human diseases in several
organisms. Our analysis was based on the KEGG v47
and comprises 210 human pathway maps in XML file

format corresponding to 6 categories and 32 subcategories. The data are publically available and can be
accessed from the FTP ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/. The
KEGG pathway data were parsed by a Perl [17] script
using the XML::simple module, resulting in 10001 genepathway relations belonging to 208 pathway maps and
4186 unique genes (figure 1b).
Integration of gene expression and functional data

For each tumor entity - KEGG pathway pair, we tested
whether the set of genes that are differentially expressed

in the given tumor entity is enriched in the set of genes
belonging to the given KEGG pathway. Testing was performed using an one-sided exact Fisher test. This
resulted in a 28 tumor entities × 208 KEGG pathways
matrix containing the p-values of each test.
To get a better overview, we implemented a Python
[18] script, using the PIL module, to visualize significant
enriched KEGG pathway maps (p < 0.05) within the
tumor entities into a clear structured functional cancer
map (figure 1c) (figure 2). The same procedure as
described here for the set of all differentially expressed

genes can be applied to the set of upregulated resp.
downregulated genes separately. The corresponding
functional cancer maps are given in the additional files
(Additional file 2, Additional file 3). Note: A separately
generated functional cancer map without prior filtering
for outlier genes (pooled variance and tissue specific
variance) was added to the additional files (Additional
file 4).
Literature Mining

Using the web-based tool PubMatrix [19] for literature
mining of PubMed [20], we analyzed our significantly
enriched KEGG pathway maps against an assortment of
tumor associated terms to identify pathways previously
mentioned in context to cancer. Tumor associated keywords used in the PubMatrix searches included “Neoplasm”, “Tumors”, “Tumor”, “Benign Neoplasms”,
“Neoplasms, Benign”, “Benign Neoplasm”, “Neoplasm,
Benign”, “Cancer”, “Cancers” and “neoplasms[mesh]”.
PubMatrix is limited to 10000 results for each search
and modifier terms. All search results can be found in
the additional files (Additional files 5).
Calculation of tumor phylogeny

In a second step, we used the binarized functional cancer map (1 respectively 0 representing significant resp.
non-significant entries) to calculate a similarity score
between tumor entities. The similarity between two
tumor entities T1 and T2, was quantified by calculating
the Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient [21] of corresponding
columns in the binarized functional cancer map. This
coefficient is a statistical measure of agreement for qualitative items.
We calculated the quadratic agreement matrix among
the tumor entities. The result was visualized with the R
function heatmap [22]. Euclidean distance average linkage hierarchical clustering [23] was chosen for the dendrogram included in the plot (figure 3). Visualizations of
the tumor similarity matrices with respect to upregulated and downregulated genes are given in the additional files (Additional file 6, Additional file 7).

entity to a KEGG pathway map is symbolized by the diameter of
the spot, the greater the diameter the more significant enriched is

schema is supported by the color gradient on the left side.

In order to investigate individual and conserved signaling and metabolic events in tumor progression, we analyzed a dataset of 649 human two-color cDNA
microarray tumor samples obtained from the Stanford
Microarray Database [13]. These samples covered 28
different tumor entities which were further categorized
into 16 tumor classes (table1). Analyzing these gene
expression profiles revealed a total of 10385 genes differentially expressed in at least one of the tumor entities. Among highly conserved differentially expressed

genes were apolipoprotein (APOH), previously not mentioned in context with cancer, T cell receptor beta constant 1 (TRBC1) a widely undescribed gene and also not
associated in context with cancer and alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP), a major plasma protein reported to be associated
with several carcinomas [24-26]. Furthermore Orosomucoid 2 (ORM2) another plasma protein whose specific
function has not yet been determined and not linked to
carcinogenesis was found to be regulated in 25 tumor
tissues. Furthermore, two genes were identified to be
regulated in 24 tumor tissues, inter-alpha (globulin)
inhibitor H2 (ITIH2), a gene involved in extracellular
matrix stabilization and related to prevention of tumor
metastasis [27-29] and the functionally undefined gene
KIAA0101 which is associated with hepatocellular and
thyroid carcinoma [30,31].

respectively 493765 tumor associated publications were
ranked at the top. Taking into count highly enriched
KEGG pathway maps, among the KEGG pathway map
‘Cell cycle’ in KEGG class ‘Cellular Processes’, the
‘Nucleotide excision repair’ (174594) in ‘Genetic Information Processing’ as well as ‘Wnt signaling pathway’
(21699) in ‘Environmental Information Processing’ were
highly linked to tumor publications. In contrast, highly
enriched KEGG pathway maps ‘ECM-receptor interaction’ (4), the ‘Complement and Coagulation cascades’
(35) and the ‘PPAR signaling pathway’ (238) were mostly
undescribed. The complete search results can be found
in the additional files (Additional file 5).
Exposing tumor phylogeny

Literature Mining

Further use of the functional cancer map was made to
calculate tumor phylogeny by laying down new starting
points for the efficient combination of tumor therapeutics as well as for expanding the application area of wellestablished tumor therapies. We postulated that tumor
entities with comparable significantly enriched KEGG
pathway maps demonstrate comparable activation of biochemical processes and, thus, biochemical behavior. As a
measure of closer or distant relationship between two
tumor entities we applied the Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient
[21] to the binarized functional cancer map data. Analyzing phylogeny between diverse tumor entities, highest
concordance was found between tumor entities within
the same tissue class. The tumor tissue ‘Conventional
Renal Cell Carcinoma, Grade 2’ and ‘Conventional Renal
Cell Carcinoma, Grade 3’ showed the highest concordance  = 0.77, followed by ‘Breast Carcinoma’ and
‘Breast Carcinoma Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Grade 2’
( = 0.74) and ‘Breast Carcinoma Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Grade 2’ and ‘Breast Carcinoma Invasive Ductal
Carcinoma, Grade 2’ ( = 0.70). Examining the tumor
entities belonging to different tumor classes, ‘Breast Carcinoma Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Grade 2’ and ‘Adenocarcinoma, Pancreas, Grade II’ ( = 0.69) displayed the
most functional similarity. Also, high similarity in biological behavior was found between ‘Conventional Renal
Cell Carcinoma, Grade 2’ and ‘Adenocarcinoma, Pancreas, Grade II’ ( = 0.63) as well as ‘Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Peripheral Blood, Grade Pre-B’ and ‘Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia Bone Marrow, Grade Common’
( = 0.61) (figure 3).

To evaluate the significantly enriched KEGG pathway
maps in context of published literature to tumor progression already described and mostly unknown we utilized the web-based tool PubMatrix [19]. The ‘Cell
cycle’ pathway was the most cited pathway with focus
on tumor progression displaying more than 1000000
search results per modifier terms in total. Furthermore,
‘Melanoma’ and ‘Acute myeloid leukemia’ with 718282

Discussion
Despite comprehensive gene expression sets available on
multiple human tumor entities, only few studies have
attempted to assess and compare biological behavior of
the tumors on the basis of functional microarray analysis and evaluation of commonly deregulated and conserved genetic signaling and metabolic events.

Exposing functional mechanisms

Focusing on deregulated genetic signaling events across
multiple tumors as well as metabolic events in tumor
progression, we analyzed the differentially expressed
genes in context of the functional categories as well as
signaling and metabolic pathway maps provided by the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
[16]. After assigning the KEGG data to gene expression
data, a total of 141 KEGG pathway maps were significantly enriched and revealed four well conserved subcategories among the tumor entities: ‘Cell Growth and
Death’, ‘Signaling Molecules and Interactions’, ‘Immune
System’ and ‘Immune System Diseases’. The most highly
conserved KEGG pathway was ‘Cell adhesion molecules
(CAMs)’ (p value ranging between 5.58e-13 and 0.01)
which is significantly enriched in 26 tumor entities, followed by the KEGG pathway map ‘Asthma’ (1.37e-12 0.01), ‘Cell cycle’ (1.42e-09 - 0.02) and ‘Hematopoietic
cell lineage’ (1.07e-7 - 0.04) in 25 tumor entities. ‘Antigen
processing and presentation’ (2.59e10 - 0.02), ‘ECMreceptor interaction’ (7.11e-9 - 0.04), ‘Complement and
coagulation cascades’ (1.66e-15 - 0.03) and ‘Graft-versushost disease’ (9.37e-10 - 0.04) KEGG pathway maps were
found to be significantly enriched in 24 tumor entities.
As a result, we generated a functional cancer map to
visualize this large amount of multiple functional tumor
data into a clearly structured compendium (figure 2).

Krupp et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2011, 4:53
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/4/53

Moreover, previous analyses focused on individual
mechanisms or did not compose tumor-specific gene
expression information into detailed, structured maps,
impeding a systems view on cancer. However, in particular this kind of information could potentially guide
medical research in the context of new applications and
novel combinations of existing chemotherapeutics.
Therefore, we here present gene expression information
of tumors according to pathway activity profiles deemed
to better reflect biological behavior. Our analysis of multiple tumor entities using these activity profiles resulted
in a clearly structured functional cancer map (figure 2).
Note: Due to experimental variation, wrong annotation,
and simplifying model assumptions, our pathway signature almost surely fails to identify all active cellular processes in the respective experiment/cancer type [32]. But
this is not the goal of the present work, our goal is to
identify and distinguish relevant features of multiple
tumor tissues; we demonstrate that the proposed analysis is sensitive enough for this purpose.
Exposing functional mechanisms

As a proof of principle and supporting our approach, we
found well documented biological events such as cell
cycle and apoptosis to be highly conserved among the
diverse tumor entities. These findings confirmed the
reliability of the generated functional cancer map.
Deregulated balance between proliferation and cell
death represents a pro-tumorigenic mechansim in
human carcinogenesis [33]. Both activation of proliferative signals and an inhibition of death process, leading
to survival and consecutively to proliferation, may contribute essential steps in the progression to cancer in
affected cells. Among highly enriched pathways in multiple tumors were ‘Cell cycle’, ‘Signaling Molecules and
Interactions’, and ‘Cell Growth and Death’ summarizing
genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis,
demonstrating that key tumorigenic features of tumor
development were identified by our analysis. Furthermore multiple functional pathways within the categories,
‘Immune System’ and ‘Immune System Diseases’ summarizing genes involved in immune response and
immunological changes were also highly enriched in
almost all tumor entities. Changes in these processes
have been extensively documented to be involved in
cancer development and growth [34-38]. Whenever normal body cells turn into tumor cells, various antigens on
their surface change and were constantly secreted into
the circulatory system. The so called tumor antigens
were recognized by the immune system and cytotoxic T
cells, natural killer cells and macrophages were advised
to catch and eliminated the cell that undergo malignant
transformation. A disturbed immune surveillance may
lead to an increased tumor growth [34,38].

However, besides extensively studied and repeatedly
documented signaling pathways highlighted in our analysis several pathways were found to be commonly
enriched among differentially regulated genes which
have not been clearly attributed to tumorigenesis. Thus,
our work identified key roles of additional signaling
pathways in cancer biology. Deregulations or mutations
in the molecules involved in the ‘Cell Cycle’ and ‘ECMreceptor interaction’ pathway, preserving the physical
link between extracellular matrix and actin cytoskeleton,
are also closely connected to tumor progression [39].
Besides the ‘Cell Cycle’ pathway, the ‘ECM-receptor
interaction’ pathway interacts with the ‘Cell adhesion
molecules (CAMs)’. This balance between cell adhesion
and extra cellular molecules is essential for normal cell
survival, imbalance between those pathways leads to
detaching cells from the extra cellular matrix and therefore enhance metastasis [40,41]. However, the ECMreceptor interaction and mechanisms of focal adhesion
were not in the focus of biomedical research on cancer
mechanisms. Over the past decades, the majority of cancer related genetic studies were focussed on genes
involved in transcription and cell cycle control. This is
reflected in a tenfold higher number of abstracts containing the search terms ‘cancer and cell cycle’ than
‘cancer and extracellular matrix or microenvironment’
(122 594 vs. 20 287 articles) when entered in a PubMed
query. This may be due to the fact that the plethora of
biological functions of ECM proteins has been underestimated for a long time. For a long time functional
properties of the extracellular microenvironment and
matrix was believed to be restricted to form the “glue”
between cells, responsible for simply to maintain shape
and coherence of tissues and organs as well as a reservoir of body fluids. In the last decade the microenvironment gained increasing attention for many other
processes including tumorigenesis [42] e.g. the breast
microenvironment plays an important and complex role
in hepatocarciongenesis. Therefore, cancers are currently
regarded as heterogeneous multicellular entities containing cells of multiple lineages who interact with one
another, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and soluble
molecules in their vicinity are dynamic. Overall, these
interactions favour cancer cell proliferation, movement,
differentiation, and ECM metabolism, while simultaneously restricting cell death, stationary polarized
growth, and ECM stability [43]. However, the microenvironment is also essential to key processes such as
angiogenesis. Another important factor is the appreciation that cell migration, matrix and tissue remodeling
are not unique properties of cancer cell growths but
instead are tightly regulated programs normally utilized
during development and in adult tissues responding to
acute tissue injury [43]. Reciprocal interactions between

Krupp et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2011, 4:53
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/4/53

responding “normal” cells, their mediators, structural
components of the ECM, and genetically altered neoplastic cells regulate all aspects of tumourigenicity. An
additional role was suggested for complex interaction of
the extra cellular tumour stroma with (mesenchymal)
stem cells involved in cancer growth [44]. Thus, demonstrating that functional pathways involved in ECM formation and loosening of focal adhesions are
differentially regulated in almost all cancer entities, our
results clearly advocate for enhanced efforts in unravelling molecular mechanisms of cancer development influenced by these pathways.
Almost no studies were published on the functional
pathway of ‘Complement and Coagulation cascades’.
Few studies demonstrated a potential role of individual
genes within this pathway in cancer development. Some
members of the complement system can be modulated
by the antifibrinolytic protein, activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa), by inactivating the
anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a and C5a and dysregulation of
those genes has been implicated in tumor growth
[45,46]. In addition a link between the haemostatic system and both tumor stroma and metastasis has been
noticed in animal and in vitro models. The relationship
between cancer and blood coagulation has been
described on a diverse pathophysiological level. Cancer
development and growth was shown to go along with
hypercoagulable state and predisposes to activation of
platelets and thrombosis, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis interfering with tumor cell biology, tumor growth,
angiogenesis and metastatic process. However, the
detailed molecular mechanisms of anti-coagulants such
as warfarin on cancer remain elusive [47,48]. Given the
strong enrichment of differentially regulated genes
linked to the functional pathway of complement and
coagulation, our data suggested that it may be worth to
further elucidate exact underlying molecular mechanisms as they may hold key regulatory mechanisms in
cancer development and growth.
Another promising candidate for further evaluation
was the highly conserved PPAR signaling pathway. It is
known that the peroxisome proliferation-activated
receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway regulates a multitude
of genes important for diverse cellular functions including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, immune
response and apoptosis. Once activated, PPARgamma
will preferentially bind with retinoid X receptor alpha
and signal antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and prodifferentiation pathways in several tissue types. Since
ligands and other agents influencing this pathway have
revealed anticancer effects in a variety of human cancers
[49,50] efforts to target this signaling pathway should
certainly be intensified given the broad range of tumors
with deregulated PPAR signaling.

Finally, we noticed an enrichment of genes invovlved
in the functional pathways “Diabetes type I” and “gluycolysis/gluconeogesis”. Besides our data several clinical
reports support a synergism between Diabetes mellitus
and cancer development. Konishi I et al. reported a correlation between a diabetic pattern of the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test OGTT and hepatocarcinogenesis and
considered it a significant risk factor for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C virus [51].
Also Huo et al. found that Diabetes mellitus independently predicts decreased survival in HCC patients [52].
Finally, El-Serag et al. reported that Diabetes mellitus is
associated with an increased risk for HCC [53]. Interestingly the PPARgamma activators are utilized for the
treatment of diabetes mellitus pointing towards a congruent signaling in of PPAR pathway and diabetes signatures [50].
In summary, there is accumulating evidence for a
synergy between diabetes mellitus and an increased risk
for and decreased survival of patients with HCC. Our
data suggests that important interactions may be identified by analyzing the enriched functional pathways of
“Diabetes type I” and “gluycolysis/gluconeogesis” previously not extensively studied in context of cancer.
Exposing tumor phylogeny

We introduced a measure of profile similarity by which
tumor entities were structured based on semantic aggregated profiles, which means significant, individual tumor
mechanisms calculated out of gene expression data, into
a dendrogram (figure 2). In order to get a measurement
for genetic distance and thus to estimate the affinity
between the diverse tumor entities, we applied the
Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient [21] to our binarized functional cancer map and clustered the distant relation
matrix (figure 3). Predominant clustering of the tumor
entities to their corresponding tumor class is indication
for the robustness of the tumor phylogeny.
Notably, examining downregulated genes and clustering of the tumor entities by means of KEGG pathways,
we found our sample to almost perfectly cluster according to the germ layer of the tissue of tumor origin.
However, this finding needs to be further analyzed and
applied to robust statistical testing [54,55].

Conclusion
Multiple tumor entities have been analyzed for signaling
and metabolic events in tumor progression and composed into a functional cancer map. The resulting
detailed, structured map should lead to a more systematic view on common and individual tumor mechanisms.
This work lead to the identification of novel superimposed functional pathways closely linked to cancer biology. Among these pathways were ‘ECM-receptor

interaction’, ‘Complement and Coagulation cascades’,
and ‘PPAR signaling pathway’. Furthermore tumor phylogeny was calculated with respect to their biological
behavior. Both, the functional cancer map paired with
the indication for tumor phylogeny could serve as a
starting point for the efficient combination of targeted
tumor therapeutics as well as for expanding the application area of well-established tumor therapies.
