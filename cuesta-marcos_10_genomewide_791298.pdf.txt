Abstract
Background: Considerations in applying association mapping (AM) to plant breeding are population structure and
size: not accounting for structure and/or using small populations can lead to elevated false-positive rates. The
principal determinants of population structure in cultivated barley are growth habit and inflorescence type. Both
are under complex genetic control: growth habit is controlled by the epistatic interactions of several genes. For
inflorescence type, multiple loss-of-function alleles in one gene lead to the same phenotype. We used these two
traits as models for assessing the effectiveness of AM. This research was initiated using the CAP Core germplasm
array (n = 102) assembled at the start of the Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP). This array was
genotyped with 4,608 SNPs and we re-sequenced genes involved in morphology, growth and development. Larger
arrays of breeding germplasm were subsequently genotyped and phenotyped under the auspices of the CAP
project. This provided sets of 247 accessions phenotyped for growth habit and 2,473 accessions phenotyped for
inflorescence type. Each of the larger populations was genotyped with 3,072 SNPs derived from the original set of
4,608.
Results: Significant associations with SNPs located in the vicinity of the loci involved in growth habit and
inflorescence type were found in the CAP Core. Differentiation of true and spurious associations was not possible
without a priori knowledge of the candidate genes, based on re-sequencing. The re-sequencing data were used to
define allele types of the determinant genes based on functional polymorphisms. In a second round of association
mapping, these synthetic markers based on allele types gave the most significant associations. When the synthetic
markers were used as anchor points for analysis of interactions, we detected other known-function genes and
candidate loci involved in the control of growth habit and inflorescence type. We then conducted association
analyses - with SNP data only - in the larger germplasm arrays. For both vernalization sensitivity and inflorescence
type, the most significant associations in the larger data sets were found with SNPs coincident with the synthetic
markers used in the CAP Core and with SNPs detected via interaction analysis in the CAP Core.
Conclusions: Small and highly structured collections of germplasm, such as the CAP Core, are cost-effectively
phenotyped and genotyped with high-throughput markers. They are also useful for characterizing allelic diversity
at loci in germplasm of interest. Our results suggest that discovery-oriented exercises in AM in such small arrays
may generate a large number of false-positives. However, if haplotypes in candidate genes are available, they may
be used as anchors in an analysis of interactions to identify other candidate regions harboring genes determining

target traits. Using larger germplasm arrays, genome regions where the principal genes determining vernalization
sensitivity and row type are located were identified.

Background
Association mapping (AM) (also known as linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping) is a powerful and promising
tool for gene detection in crop plants (reviewed by [1]).
AM has been used in cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare
subsp. vulgare) (reviewed in [2]) and its wild progenitor H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum [3-5]. A key consideration
in AM is population structure, which may cause spurious
correlations and lead to an elevated false-positive rate
[6,7]. In cultivated barley there is a high level of population structure and the major factors determining it are
growth habit and inflorescence type [4,8-11].
The major components of growth habit are sensitivity
to vernalization and photoperiod, and these environmental signals are associated with tolerance to low temperature (reviewed by [12] and [13]). In general, maximum
cold tolerance is achieved in genotypes with winter
growth habit during the vegetative growth stage. Transition to a reproductive growth stage is triggered by vernalization and/or long photoperiod. In contrast, the
flowering time of spring habit varieties is not accelerated
by vernalization. Spring growth habit types may vary in
their response to photoperiod, but they all have a limited
capacity to tolerate low temperature stresses. Varieties
with facultative growth habit can be either fall- or springplanted since they are not vernalization sensitive. They
can be as cold tolerant as winter types [14]. The photoperiod sensitivity of the facultative growth habit class
varies, although sensitivity to short photoperiod is advantageous from the standpoint of delaying the vegetative to
reproductive transition [15] and thus ensuring the maximum capacity for low temperature tolerance [16].
Three loci (VRN-H1, VRN-H2 and VRN-H3) interact
in an epistatic fashion to determine vernalization sensitivity. Vernalization sensitivity occurs only in one of the
possible allele combinations at these loci: Vrn-H2_vrnH1vrn-H1vrn-H3vrnH3 [17]. Deletion of part or all of
the genomic region encoding three zinc finger-CCT
domain (ZCCT-H) transcription factors accounts for the
vernalization-insensitive (recessive) alleles at the VRNH2 locus [14,18-21]. Deletions spanning putative ciselements in the intron I are the functional polymorphisms at VRN-H1 accounting for the vernalization-insensitive (dominant) alleles [14,21,22]. HvFT1 corresponds
to the VRN-H3 locus and associations between intron I
haplotypes and dominant/recessive alleles have been
described [23,24].
Genes determining photoperiod response (PPD-H1
and PPD-H2) and low temperature tolerance (FR-H1

and FR-H2) were first reported as QTL. PPD-H1 affects
flowering time under long-day conditions whereas PPDH2 affects flowering under short photoperiods [15].
HvPRR7 encodes a pseudo-response regulator and corresponds to PPD-H1 [25]. The basis of the recessive
late-flowering (long-day insensitivity) phenotype is a
SNP mutation affecting a conserved residue in the CCT
domain [25]. HvFT3 is the determinant of PPD-H2
[24,26]. Delayed flowering under short-day conditions (a
recessive phenotype) is due to gene deletion [24,26,27].
FR-H1 is coincident with VRN-H1, but it is not yet
resolved if cold temperature tolerance is a pleiotropic
effect of the VRN-H1 [28]. One or more members of a
cluster of HvCBF genes is (are) the candidate(s) for the
FR-H2 locus [29-31].
The two-rowed and six-rowed inflorescence types
refer to the number of fertile florets per rachis node in
the barley spike. The presence of a recessive allele at the
VRS1 locus is sufficient to cause the wild type tworowed barley to become six-rowed barley (Lundqvist et
al. 1997). Multiple loss-of-function mutations in the
HvHOX1 gene (VRS1) cause a cessation of suppression
of lateral-spikelet development and thus lead to the
(recessive) six-rowed phenotype [32].
Previous attempts to use genome-wide AM to identify
loci determining growth habit [4,10] have identified significant associations with SNP markers in the vicinity of
some of the determinant genes but not the genes themselves. Cockram et al. [8], using a limited marker data
set and passport data on growth habit found significant
associations only when they used specific insertion/deletion (InDel) and SNP markers in the VRN-H1 and VRNH2 genes. Most of the associated markers were designed
based on the functional polymorphisms of VRN-H1 and
VRN-H2.
In this report we describe, in essentially chronological
order, the results of genotyping, phenotyping, and analyzing the resulting data from barley germplasm sets
varying in size and composition. This research was conducted under the auspices of the Barley Coordinated
Agricultural Project (CAP) [10]. The starting point for
this project was the formation a small core collection (n
= 102) of reference accessions contributed by each of
the ten participating breeding programs, the CAP Core.
The CAP Core was genotyped with SNP markers (primarily EST-based) implemented in three 1,536-plex oligonucleotide polymorphism arrays (OPAs) [33,34]. At
the same time - in order to fully characterize genes
involved in morphology, growth and development - a

Cuesta-Marcos et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:707

subset of 12 genes were re-sequenced or genotyped in
the CAP Core. Functional polymorphism assays were
based on re-sequencing of target genes in the germplasm array and based on these results, genotyping for
specific SNPs and InDels. The CAP Core was phenotyped for inflorescence type and vernalization sensitivity
under long-day greenhouse conditions. The SNP, functional polymorphism, and phenotype data were used for
AM and analysis of interactions. Larger arrays of breeding germplasm were subsequently genotyped and phenotyped under the auspices of the CAP project. This
provided 2,473 accessions phenotyped for inflorescence
type and 247 accessions phenotyped for vernalization
sensitivity. The SNP and phenotype data from the larger
populations were then used for AM and analysis of
interactions. Our objective was to empirically assess the
effects of population size, population type, and analysis
of interactions on detection of genes determining the
principal germplasm groups of barley.

Results
Vernalization sensitivity and inflorescence type

In the greenhouse, under unvernalized and long-day
photoperiod conditions, 91 of the 102 accessions flowered between 32-69 days after planting (Additional File
1). These genotypes are vernalization-insensitive and are
therefore of spring or facultative growth habit. Eleven
accessions did not flower within 150 days, at which
point the experiment was terminated. These 11 genotypes are vernalization-sensitive and have winter growth
habit. The 102 CAP Core accessions are comprised of
55 two-rowed and 47 six-rowed genotypes (Additional
File 1). All of the two-rowed accessions but one
(Charles) are vernalization-insensitive. In the six-rowed
group, there are 37 vernalization-insensitive and 10
vernalization-sensitive genotypes.
Re-sequencing and genotyping the VRN-H, PPD-H, FR-H
and VRS1 loci

Detailed information from the re-sequencing of 12 genes
from the VRN-H, PPD-H, FR-H and VRS1 loci is presented in Additional files. The number of alleles and/or
amplicon sizes, as well as number of haplotypes for
each of the resequenced genes, is shown in Table 1.
Sequences of the non-primer portion of each amplicon
were deposited with GenBank and accession numbers
are given in Additional File 2. Additional File 3 shows
the gene-specific primers used for PCR amplification
and fragment sequencing. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic
cluster analyses are shown in Additional file 4. Detailed
description of the results from the re-sequencing of the
12 genes can be found in Additional File 5.

and intron 1 of VRN-H1 from the 102 accessions
revealed the five previously characterized intron 1 deletion types (Additional file 6) [14,21,22,35]. Comparison
of the intron 1-deletion types and the haplotypes
showed that some haplotypes have more than one deletion type. Sixty-seven accessions had complete deletions
of the three tightly linked ZCCT-H genes at VRN-H2.
Seventeen accessions - six with spring and 11 with winter growth habit - contained all three of the ZCCT-H
genes. Eighteen vernalization-insensitive genotypes contained just the c form of the ZCCT-H gene family but
had complete deletions of the a and b forms. Sequence
alignment of the proposed functional polymorphism in
HvFT1 intron 1 from accessions varying in growth habit
revealed that the proposed functional polymorphism
[23] does not account for phenotypic variation in
growth habit in the CAP Core germplasm. The vernalization-sensitive cultivar Strider (EU007830), with a
recessive VRN-H3 allele, showed the intron 1 haplotype
hypothesized to lead to a dominant VRN-H3 allele. The
alignment revealed a C/T promoter SNP (927th nucleotide in EU007830), which better differentiated the
dominant (T) and recessive (C) alleles at this locus.
Alignment of the full length (1192 bp) HvHOX1 gene
from the 102 genotypes revealed nine SNPs and seven
haplotypes. Six of these haplotypes correspond to previously described alleles [32]. Four six-rowed accessions
have a novel VRS1 haplotype. Because this novel recessive allele cannot be explained by simple mutation of
any previously-described dominant alleles, we designate
this allele vrs1.a4 (Additional File 7). The deduced polypeptide sequence of vrs1.a4 does not correspond to any
of the reported recessive VRS1 alleles and sequencing
additional promoter regions (data not shown) did not
reveal causal polymorphisms that could explain the
recessive (loss of function) phenotype conferred by vrs.
a4. The 14 deficiens accessions in the germplasm array
all have the Vrs1.b2 allele.
Linkage Disequilibrium and Population Structure

The average extent of LD is aproximately 0.7 cM when
considering the entire germplasm array (Figure 1).
Within the spring two-rowed group (n = 55) it is
approximatetly 7 cM. Within the spring six-rowed (n =
33) it is ~ 0.2 cM. In the case of the winter six-rowed
(n = 17), only pairwise comparisons whose r 2 value
equals 1 have a p-value below than 0.001. Therefore, for
this group the LD threshold was set at an r2 value of 1
and no estimation of the extension of LD was possible.
Using STRUCTURE 2.2 [36] we identified four subpopulations, the sub-population to which each accession
belongs, and the percentage of admixture of each line.
The four sub-populations roughly correspond to winter
six-rowed, spring six-rowed, and two groups of spring

two-rowed genotypes. One group of spring two-rowed
genotypes is comprised of Baronesse, eight Baronessederived genetic stocks (BISON), and four other varieties
with Baronesse in their parentage. The first two components in the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) confirmed this division by row type and growth habit, but
no subgroups within the spring two-rowed genotypes
were detected (Figure 2). These results are similar to
those reported by [37], who performed a PCA analysis
with a subset of 95 accessions of the CAP Core. There
is a degree of admixture, with some accessions appearing in sub-populations that do not correspond to their
growth habit or row type. For example, Charles (winter
two-rowed) is clustered with the spring two-rowed;
OWB-Dominant (spring two-rowed) is clustered with
winter six-rowed; 88Ab536 and 88Ab536-B (winter sixrowed with Morex parentage) are clustered with spring
six-rowed; and Washford, Belford, Steptoe and OWBRecessive (spring six-rowed) are clustered with winter
six-rowed.
Comparison of the first two axes of the PCA of the 102
CAP Core accessions and the PCA of the 2,473 CAP I, II
and III sets shows a similar distribution of the lines (Figure 2). PCA of the latter three CAP sets shows the same
pattern of division between row type and growth habit as
the CAP Core. In both cases, the degree of admixture is
higher among lines with the same growth habit than it is
among lines with the same row type.
Association Analysis

Growth habit and inflorescence traits are the main
determinants of population structure in the CAP Core
and including population structure in the model used
for AM will diminish the ability to detect the genetic
determinants of these traits. We therefore tested four
models for AM: simple marker/trait regression (M),
accounting only for the kinship of the individuals
(M+K), correction by population structure (M+Q), and

correction for population structure and also for the
relatedness of the individuals (M+Q+K).
With each of the four analyses, we found BOPA SNPs
associated with growth habit (or vernalization sensitivity) located in, or closely linked to, the principal genes
determining growth habit (VRN-H1, VRN-H2 and VRNH3) and inflorescence type (VRS1) (data not shown).
The number of these significant associations - initially
considered as false positives - was lower for the M+Q
+K analysis compared to M+Q or M+K analyses and
much lower compared with only M. Even with the M
+Q+K analysis (Figure 3) without a priori knowledge of
the roles of the genes in determining the two phenotypes, significant SNPs would not always have been the
first choices for more detailed analyses: a large number
of significant associations were found throughout the
genome and many of these were as significant, or more
significant, than those associated with the VRN-H and
VRS1 loci.
The BOPA markers included 10 SNPs in the VRN
genes that we designed based on re-sequencing: five for
VRN-H2, two for VRN-H1 and three for VRN-H3. However, BOPA markers for VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 were not
included in the association analysis because the contrasting phenotypes encoded by these genes are the consequence of gene presence vs. deletion (VRN-H2) or
insertion/deletion (VRN-H1). Due to the coding of the
deletion alleles as missing data, these loci fell below the
quality threshold for selecting suitable markers for AM.
In order to have markers in high LD with the
described functional polymorphism(s) in the VRN-H and
VRS1 loci, we developed genotype assays based on our
re-sequencing data and conducted a second round of
AM. In this second round, we also included “synthetic
markers” that summarize the dominant/recessive nature
of the allele type based on the re-sequencing information and on a priori knowledge of gene function
(VRN1_AT, VRN2_AT and VRS1_AT). The results

Analysis of Interactions

Since vernalization response is controlled by the epistatic
interaction between VRN genes [12,14,23] and at least
one other gene (INT-C) interacts with VRS1 to determine
row type [38,39], we tested for interactions between significant markers detected in the M+Q+K genome-wide
association analysis. For each trait we selected all markers
with p-values below a threshold of 0.20 (after a false discovery rate multitest adjustment). Based on this criterion,

196 markers were selected for inflorescence type and 59
for vernalization sensitivity. These significant markers
included the synthetic markers for allele type VRN1_AT,
VRN2_AT for vernalization sensitivity and VRS1_AT for
row type. For all possible two-way combinations of markers for each of the two traits, we performed likelihood
ratio tests (LRTs).
For vernalization sensitivity, the interactions between

combinations, showed a remarkable increase in the -log
p score compared with the others (Table 2). Two of the
significant interacting markers were VRN1_AT and
VRN2_AT. We also found similar values of -log p for
interactions between VRN2_AT and HvZCTT_Hc_P80
with two markers on chromosome 2H: 1_0012 and
1_0624 at consensus map positions 58.9 cM and 59.2
cM respectively. Both have identical distributions of
alleles within the CAP Core.
Ten two-way interactions, out of the 19,110 possible,
predicted perfectly the row type in the CAP Core. Of
these, four interactions involved the allele type
VRS1_AT. The markers involved in these interactions
are on chromosomes 1H (1_0111, position 101.5 cM), 2H
(1_0213, position 86.6 cM), 4H (2_0680, position 26.2
cM), and 5H (1_0899 position 59.2 cM) (Table 2). To
determine if these loci (or linked loci) are determinants
of the two-rowed vs. six-rowed phenotype, we examined
the SNP allele type in the Oregon Wolfe Barley mapping
population [34]. The parents of this population are tworowed (OWB-dominant) and six-rowed (OWB-recessive)
and the allele types at the four markers in these two
accessions fits the same pattern as observed for the CAP
Core and a larger population of CAP lines (see next

section). However, in the OWB doubled haploid mapping
population, the only locus with a perfect association with
inflorescence type is VRS1. Six additional interactions
also predicted perfectly the row type (Table 3). All of
these interactions involved a marker located on 1H
(2_0475, 3_0546, or 2_0550) with the same markers that
interacted with VRS1_AT (1_0111 and 2_0680) or
located close to them (1_0287, 2_1037, and 1_1512).
Detailed information about the SNP markers detected in
the interaction analysis can be found in Additional File 8.
Genome-wide association analysis using larger
populations

In order to assess the effects of population size on
detection of genes known to determine vernalization
sensitivity and inflorescence type, we conducted genome-wide association analyses for row type in the 2,575
accessions represented in the CAP Core, CAP I, CAP II,
and CAP III germplasm sets (see Methods) phenotyped
for this trait (Figure 3B) and the 247 winter and facultative lines from the Oregon State University barley breeding program (OSU CAP I, OSU CAPII and OSU CAP
III, see Methods) phenotyped for vernalization sensitivity
(Figure 3D). All these lines and accessions had been
genotyped with BOPA 1 and 2.
For inflorescence type, there were significant associations on chromosomes 2H and 1H (Figure 3B), and these
associations correspond to the same regions identified in
the CAP Core using the allele type marker of VRS1 and
interaction analysis. The significant markers on 2H are in
the vicinity of VRS1; the most significant marker was
1_0213. The most significant marker on 1H was 3_1319.
The allele type at each of these four loci is fixed in 99% of
the two-rowed accessions (n = 1,070, 1,068, 1,065 and
1,052, respectively, out of a total of a 1,071 in the CAP I, II
and III sets) (see Methods). There was no pattern for allele
type in the six-rowed germplasm. For example, the alleles
fixed for the two-rowed accessions are present in the following frequencies in the six-rowed accessions: 17%
(1_0111), 45% (1_0213), 22% (2_0680) and 80% (1_0899).

Cuesta-Marcos et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:707
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/707

For vernalization sensitivity, there were significant associations on chromosomes 2H, 3H, 4H and 5H (Figure 3D).
These associations were found in the same genome
regions as in the CAP Core, except for those found in 2H.
Regarding the two loci on 2H detected in the interaction
analysis in the CAP Core (1_0012 and 1_0624) we found
that in 189 of the 247 accessions from this winter/facultative breeding germplasm have the same haplotype.

Discussion
SNP and haplotype diversity in target genes

Molecular analyses of 12 genes from seven loci known to
be involved in the genetic determination of growth habit
and inflorescence type - the two major traits causing
strong population structuring - from a unique set of 102
barley accessions revealed high sequence diversity and
complex haplotypes. For VRN-H1, VRN-H3, and VRS1 the three genes where we had sequence information from
the full set of 102 genotypes - we found 10, 39, and nine
SNP sites, which resulted in eight, seven, and seven haplotypes, respectively. Using a subset of the core set - 26
spring, two facultative, and two winter growth habit
accessions - also revealed high nucleotide diversity at six
loci: VRN-H2 (10 SNPs and four haplotypes of HvSNF2),
PPD-H1 (20 SNPs and six haplotypes of HvPRR7), PPDH2 (7 SNPs and 3 haplotypes of HvFT3), and FR-H2 (19
SNP and five haplotypes for HvCBF3, 17 SNP and six
haplotypes for HvCBF6, eight SNP and six haplotypes for
HvCBF9). Identification of these haplotypes in markerassisted breeding programs will require the use of multiple SNPs per gene, or alternative assays.
Multi-locus haplotypes define growth habit classes

Even more genetic diversity was found when we considered multi-locus haplotypes of loci involved in the regulation of growth habit. Functional polymorphisms in,
and epistatic interactions between, the three VRN-H and
two PPD-H loci have been reported [12,14,23,27]. Based
on the proposed functional polymorphisms, we determined multi-locus haplotypes of the three VRN-H and
two PPD-H loci and found 16 of the possible 32-allele
combinations (Additional File 1). Thirty-two out of the
85 spring growth habit cultivars had “spring” alleles at
all five loci, while 41 spring growth habit genotypes had
recessive (winter) vrn-h3 (HvFT1) and “spring” alleles at
the other four loci. The abundance of the winter vrn-h3
allele in cultivated spring growth habit germplasm was
unexpected since allelic variants at the VRN-H3 locus
were previously reported only in exotic barley genotypes
[17]. Seven out of 11 winter growth habit genotypes had
“winter” alleles at the five loci. In total, vernalizationinsensitive (spring and facultative growth habit) genotypes had 13 multi-locus haplotypes and vernalizationsensitive (winter growth habit) genotypes had three. Our

Page 8 of 14

results show that a large number of single-locus and
multi-locus haplotypes are involved in determining flowering time and thus growth habit.
Effect of population structure and linkage disequilibrium
on association analysis

The CAP Core is a limited sample of heterogeneous germplasm. The array is comprised of accessions representing a
range of growth habit, row type, usage and origin. However, this set is representative of the array of lines usually
used in barley breeding programs of North America. The
distribution and the number of lines in each group defined
by the PCA analysis follows the same pattern in the CAP I,
II and III sets and in the CAP Core (Figure 2). We used
row type and growth habit (as measured by flowering time
of non vernalized plants under long photoperiod) as models for genome-wide association analysis for several reasons. These phenotypes exemplify two different genetic
scenarios. In the case of row type, there are multiple SNPs
in the VRS1 gene that lead to the loss of function phenotype. The genes determining vernalization sensitivity interact epistatically and the functional basis is known. The
two phenotypes can be scored unequivocally. Finally,
growth habit and row type are the two traits considered
world-wide to define germplasm structure in barley. Even
after accounting for structure in the CAP Core, we were
able to identify markers associated with the two traits
because there was some degree of admixture.
The limited admixture between the three subgroups
representing combinations of growth habit and row type
(spring two-rowed, spring six-rowed, and winter sixrowed) is likely due to the tendency of geographically dispersed breeding programs to limit germplasm exchange.
Accessions from the same structure group will have a
more similar history of selection for genomic regions that
control row type and growth habit than accessions from
other groups. Within each structure group, accessions
from any given breeding program will also tend to be
more similar. As a consequence, the extent of LD is longest in germplasm of the same growth habit/row type
group. However, the extent of LD within each group was
reduced by the fact that accessions within each group
came from different programs. The reduced estimated
extension of LD in the winter six-rowed group may also
be due to the small sample size (33 individuals). Barley, a
self-pollinated species, is reported to have a sufficiently
high level of LD that, with sufficient marker coverage,
association mapping should be effective [2,11,40]. In the
case of the CAP Core, we found an average extension of
LD of 0.7 cM. Since the average marker density is 0.6 cM
and we have markers (SNPs and/or resequencing-based
assays) in the candidate genes responsible of the target
traits, we would expect genome-wide association mapping
to be effective.

Cuesta-Marcos et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:707
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/707

However, the estimated extension of LD in any germplasm array must be taken cautiously, since the estimated values are averaged within each chromosome.
There are individual cases of high r2 values between distant loci (up to 100 cM in the same chromosome and
even in different chromosomes) and also other cases
where LD decreases abruptly within a few hundreds of
bp (Figure 1).
Genome-wide single marker association analysis

In the CAP Core we found significant associations for
SNPs located in the regions of the genome where the
target genes are located (Figure 3A and 3C). However,
we also found other significant associations at alpha =
0.05, after multi-test adjustment, for 140 row type and
seven vernalization sensitivity markers in other regions.
Therefore it would be difficult to identify VRS1 and the
VRN-H genes based on these results. Without a priori
information regarding the locations of the target genes,
it would be very difficult to differentiate the true associations from the spurious ones in the CAP Core.
Including “synthetic” allele type markers for VRS1 and
VRN-H2 we obtained more highly significant associations than with any SNP marker. This is especially relevant in the case of VRS1, where some SNPs were
located within the candidate genes (Figure 3A and 3C).
In the case of VRN-H1, although some SNP markers
from the determinant genes were also included, two
other BOPA markers showed p-values comparable to
the allele type marker (Figure 3C). However, these marker loci mapped 10 and 20 cM from VRN-H1. Even
though these BOPA makers are in LD with the functional polymorphism they would not identify VRN-H1
without prior knowledge of this gene’s location and
function.
Analysis of interactions

In addition to the significant interaction between the
two markers for the functional polymorphisms in VRNH1 and VRN-H2, we found a highly significant interaction for VRN-H2 with two markers located on the short
arm of chromosome 2H (Table 2). No genes or QTLs
for winter vs. spring growth habit are reported in this
region, but one allele is predominant at both loci in the
vernalization-sensitive accessions in the CAP Core (all
11 accessions), and OSU CAP I, II and III (96 out of
116 lines). The fact that the same allele was also present
in a considerable number of vernalization insensitive
(facultative) lines of the OSU CAP I, II and III (93 out
of 129) suggests that this region could play a role in any
of the multiple aspects of winter growth habit (e.g. low
temperature tolerance or photoperiod sensitivity) since
these are target traits in the OSU breeding program. A
member of the CBF gene family (HvCBF8) cosegregates

Page 9 of 14

with this locus in the consensus map. Other members
of the CBF gene family are implicated in low temperature tolerance [28,41,42], but no direct effect of HvCBF8
on cold tolerance has been reported.
Regarding row type, we found a perfect association for
the interaction between allele type marker VRS1_AT
with four other markers (one each on chromosomes 1H,
2H, 4H and 5H) (Table 3). All four markers are located
in regions where other loci related to row type have
been described [43]. These include VRS3 [44] on the
long arm of chromosome 1H, VRS2 [45] and int-b [46]
on the short arm of 5H. The marker in 2H co-locates
with VRS1 in the consensus map [34]. The marker in
4H maps to the reported position of INT-C [39,47].
Alleles at these four marker loci follow a consistent pattern in the parents of the OWB population (OWB_Dominant (six-rowed) and OWB-Recessive (two-rowed)).
However, there is no correlation between alleles at these
four regions and the row type in the DH progeny after
one cycle of recombination (even marker 1_0213 on 2H
is monomorphic in this population segregating for row
type). Therefore, genes in these regions are not causal
for row type, but have reached a high degree of fixation
in two-rowed vs. six-rowed germplasm. INT-C is an
excellent example, where a specific dominant allele is
necessary for the commercial six-rowed phenotype, but
dominant or recessive alleles are found in cultivated
two-rowed germplasm.
Results of AM from larger populations

Using 2,575 lines we found significant associations in
the same regions on chromosomes 2H and 1H that we
detected using the CAP Core. Regarding 2H, these
results confirm that the extension of LD in barley, even
in highly structured germplasm, is sufficient to detect
associations with markers in LD with a gene, such as
VRS1, where different loss-of-function mutations lead to
the same phenotype. The most significant markers are
located in a 5 cM interval around VRS1 and one of
them (3_0900) is located within the coding region of the
gene, although it is not the marker with the highest significance (Figure 3B). On chromosome 1H we found
significant markers in the same region we identified
using interaction analysis and the CAP Core data. These
associations may correspond to VRS3 [44] or to a gene,
or genes, that interact with the transcription factor
encoded by VRS1. VRS3 has not been characterized phenotypically or genetically in the CAP germplasm and
none of the annotations for significant EST-based SNPs
correspond to obvious candidate genes (HarvEST:
http://www.harvest-web.org/). The CAP Core interaction
analysis, and the analysis of the full set identified associations on chromosome 5H in the vicinity of INT-B.
On chromosomes 3H, 6H and 7H significant

Cuesta-Marcos et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:707
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/707

associations were found in both analysis. There are no
obvious candidate genes for these associations. Therefore, with the exception of INT-C (chromosome 4H),
the two approaches identified the same regions.
In the case of vernalization sensitivity, using 247
accessions we found significant associations on chromosomes 4H and 5H at the same regions identified using
interaction analysis based on the 102 accessions in the
CAP Core (Figure 3B and 3D). These associations correspond to the locations of VRN-H2 and VRN-H1, respectively. As described by [48], the most significant
associations may not always correspond to candidate
genes. There is no obvious candidate for the 2H associations, which differed in position between the two
analyses.

Conclusions
Small, highly structured collections, such as the CAP
Core, are generally not considered ideal for association
mapping. The failure to find meaningful associations
between the target traits and single SNPs could be due
to a number of factors including: (i) small sample size,
(ii) phenotypes resulting from epistatic interactions, (iii)
abrupt decay of LD around, or within, genes, (iv) multiple SNPs leading to the same phenotype, (v) the functional basis of allelic diversity is not due to SNPs, (vi)
multiple haplotypes for candidate genes whose definition
requires the use of multiple SNPs within each gene (vii)
SNP ascertainment bias. We found that AM in the CAP
Core was effective for locating genes involved in the two
phenotypes - growth habit and row type - that determine the principal germplasm groups of barley only
when synthetic markers based on allele re-sequencing
were included and an analysis of interactions was
employed. These analyses identified potential candidate
interacting genes for both phenotypes. When we
extended the analyses to larger populations, we identified the same genome regions. The cost of genotyping,
together with the intensive computing requirements for
AM, would make it difficult for most breeding programs
to use this approach for detecting associations for phenotypes showing more complex inheritance. Our results
suggest that breeding programs may be able to make
effective use of smaller germplasm arrays for AM, provided they have a functional polymorphism data for
anchor loci and use interaction analysis. The results can
be useful guides for deeper exploration of significant
associations in larger germplasm arrays.
Methods
Plant materials and phenotype evaluation

The 102 barley accessions (Additional File 1) represent key
varieties, variety candidates and genetic stocks of interest
to the 10 breeding programs participating in the USDA-

Page 10 of 14

CSREES Barley CAP http://www.barleycap.org. This germplasm collection is referred to as the CAP Core.
The vernalization sensitivity of the CAP Core was
measured based on the method of [21]. All plants were
grown under greenhouse conditions, without vernalization. A constant 16 h light/24 h photoperiod was provided using supplemental high intensity lighting. The
temperature was maintained at 18 ± 1.5°C day and
night. The number of days from seedling emergence to
flowering - Zadock’s scale developmental phase 9 and
49, respectively [49] - were scored for each plant. The
experiment was terminated 150 days after planting, and
plants that had not flowered were assigned a value of
150 days to flowering. Inflorescence type of each accession was recorded based on the number of fertile florets
per rachis node and is hereafter referred to as tworowed or six-rowed (Additional File 1).
The effects of significant markers obtained in the
interaction analysis (see below, Association mapping and
interaction analysis) were validated in other germplasm
arrays of Barley CAP breeding lines. These germplasm
arrays, hereafter referred to as the CAP I, II and III
datasets, consist of breeding lines, elite lines, and cultivars submitted by participants in the Barley CAP http://
www.barleyCAP.org. The flowering time results were
validated in 247 accessions from the Oregon State University breeding program that were included in the CAP
(referred as OSU CAP I, II and III). The inflorescence
type results were validated using CAP I, II, and III lines
from nine breeding programs (2,473). These dataset are
available from The Hordeum Toolbox http://thehordeumtoolbox.org/. The Oregon Wolfe Barley Population
[33], genotyped with a subset of the SNP markers used
for the CAP Core BOPA1 and BOPA2 - (see below,
Genotyping), was also used for validation of the inflorescence type results.
Re-sequencing and genotyping the VRN-H, PPD-H, FR-H
and VRS1 loci

A segment of the HvBM5A gene (VRN-H1) - from the
promoter CArG-box through partial intron 1 - was resequenced in all 102 accessions of the CAP Core. Multiple primers were designed to span all known intron 1
deletion types of HvBM5A. At the VRN-H2 locus, we
genotyped all 102 accessions for the presence or absence
of each of the three ZCCT-H genes, and a 3’ UTR InDel
in the SNF2P gene. SNF2P is tightly linked to the
ZCCT-H genes [18,20]. We then re-sequenced the
region flanking the 3’ UTR InDel of SNF2P from a subset of 30 accessions (26 spring, two facultative, and two
winter accessions). The lines in this subset are shown in
Additional File 1. The full-length of HvFT1 (VRN-H3)
was re-sequenced from ten accessions and a 1.6 kbp
promoter region was re-sequenced in the remaining 96

Cuesta-Marcos et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:707
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/707

accessions (Additional File 1). The PPD-H1 allele type
was determined based on the CCT domain SNP in
HvPRR7 described by [25]. In addition, we sequenced a
1.4-kbp region flanking the CCT domain in HvPRR7
from the same subset of 30 accessions used for deeper
characterization of SNF2P. The PPD-H2 locus was genotyped as a dominant marker based on the presence/
absence of the HvFT3 gene and the long-day insensitive
alleles were re-sequenced from 26 spring accessions in
the subset of 30 (Additional File 2). We re-sequenced
the tightly linked HvCBF3, HvCBF6, and HvCBF9 genes
(located at the FR-H2 locus) from the subset of 30
accessions as described by [30]. A 3’ UTR InDel of
HvCBF6 was genotyped in all 102 accessions. The fulllength HvHOX1 gene (VRS1) was re-sequenced from all
102 accessions.
Each PCR fragment was directly sequenced as
described in [50]. At least two independent PCR fragments were sequenced when a polymorphism unique to
only one accession was found. Sequences of the non-primer portion of each amplicon were deposited with GenBank and accession numbers are given in Additional
File 2. All genotyping PCRs were replicated at least
twice to validate allele scores. Additional File 3 shows
the gene-specific primers used for PCR amplification
and fragment sequencing. Sequence analyses were conducted using GeneDoc version 2.6 [51] and MEGA version 4.0 [52].
Marker development for association mapping (AM)

For AM, we converted the nucleotide polymorphism
and genotyping results found in the VRN-H, PPD-H,
FR-H, and VRS1 loci of the 102 genotypes into 66 binary
markers. When a polymorphism site gave triple values e.g. a SNP with three possible nucleotides or an InDel
with three alleles - the minor allele was converted to
missing data.
The dominant/recessive VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 allele
types were determined based on [14,21,35]. Alignment
of a 668 bp VRN-H1 (promoter region through partial
intron 1) sequence revealed 10 SNPs, which we defined
as markers VRN-H1_SNP1-10. According to the intron
1 deletion type we assigned dominant/recessive VRN-H1
alleles to the 102 accessions (marker VRN-H1_AT). Presence or absence of the ZCCT-Ha/b gene cluster determined the dominant or recessive VRN-H2 allele phase,
respectively (marker VRN-H2_AT). The presence/
absence of the ZCCT-Hc locus was scored as marker
ZCCT-Hc_PA. The 3’ UTR InDel polymorphism of
SNF2P was scored as marker SNF2P_INDEL. Alignment
of 1600 bp of the VRN-H3 promoter region revealed 39
SNP sites (markers VRN-H3_SNP1-39). The dominant/
recessive allele phases of PPD-H1 and PPD-H2 were
determined based on [25] and [24], respectively. The

Page 11 of 14

PPD-H1 and PPD-H2 genes were genotyped as a CAPS
marker and as a presence/absence dominant PCR marker, respectively, and converted to markers PPD-H1_AT
and PPD-H2_AT. From the FR-H2 locus we genotyped
a 3’ UTR InDel in the HvCBF6 gene and the data were
used as marker CBF6_INDEL. Alignment of the 1192 bp
of HvHOX1 (VRS1) - promoter region through 3’ UTR revealed nine SNPs (markers VRS1_SNP1-9). Dominant/
recessive VRS1 allele type was determined according to
[32] and converted to marker data VRS1_AT. We identified a novel allele at VRS1 in four six-rowed accessions
(Sussex, Wysor, Nomini and Belford) that was not
described in [32]. We classified these four six-rowed
accessions as two-rowed for the marker VRS1_AT due
to the sequence similarity of this novel six-row allele
with the two-row allele (see Results). Markers developed
following the dominant/recessive allele type at the VRNH1 and VRS1 loci (VRN-H1_AT and VRS1_AT) are
also called as “synthetic” markers in this publication.
Genome-wide, mostly EST-based, SNP markers were
developed as described in detail in Close et al. (2009).
Three 1536-plex pilot Oligonucleotide Pool Assays
(POPA1, 2 and 3) were designed and used to genotype
the 102 accessions using the Illumina GoldenGate BeadArray SNP detection platform [34]. Based on the resequencing data, we designed and included SNPs from
the growth habit-related genes and VRS1 in POPA3
(Additional File 9). A subset of the POPA1, 2, and 3
markers were used to design Barley OPAs 1 and 2
(BOPA1 and 2) [34]. The CAP I, II, and III breeding
lines were genotyped with BOPA 1 and 2. The POPA 1,
2 and 3 genotyping assays were conducted at the Southern California Genotyping Consortium at the University
of California, Los Angeles by Joe DeYoung and Maricel
Almonte. The BOPA assays were conducted at the
USDA-ARS Regional Genotyping Laboratory at Fargo,
North Dakota by Shiaoman Chao. Genetic map position
of the POPA (and BOPA) markers were determined
based on a consensus map employing marker segregation data from three double haploid barley mapping
populations [34] (HarvEST: http://www.harvest-web.org/
). SNP markers with unknown position and/or more
than 10% missing data and/or Gentrain scores below 0.6
were excluded from all the analyses.
Population structure and relatedness of individuals

Population structure in the CAP Core was determined
with STRUCTURE 2.2 [36] using the linkage model and
markers whose positions are defined in the consensus
map (HarvEST: http://www.harvest-web.org/). For the
calculation of population structure, markers with Minor
Allele Frequency (MAF) below 0.05 were excluded. The
program was run five independent times for each value
of the maximum population number (K = 1 to K = 7)

with 25,000 burn in and 25,000 MCMC iterations. For
each run, an estimated logarithm of the probability (ln
Pr(X|K) was calculated. After determining the most
probable number of subpopulations, the program was
run again with 100,000 burn in and 100,000 MCMC
iterations in order to obtain the population structure
matrix (Q matrix). This matrix defines the estimated
membership of each individual to each population,
expressed in proportion, and was used to correct for
population structure in further analysis. Principal Components Analyses (PCA) were also used to determine
population structure using SNP data and SAS v9.1
PROC PRINCOMP (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
The Loiselle coefficient [53] was used to calculate the
relatedness between individuals (relative kinship) using
SPAGeDi 1.2 [54]. Two thousand polymorphic, randomly selected, SNPs from POPA1 and POPA2 were
used in the analysis. Negative values of the coefficient
between two individuals, which mean that the two individuals are less related than two random individuals,
were set to zero. A matrix with the relative kinship coefficients (K matrix) was used to correct for relatedness of
individuals in further analyses.
Linkage disequilibrium

TASSEL 2.1 http://www.maizegenetics.net[55] was used to
calculate the LD parameter r2 and corresponding p-values
(two-sided Fisher’s exact test). For the calculation of LD,
markers with Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) below 0.05
were excluded. The extent of LD was calculated for each
chromosome for the whole set of 102 accessions, and also
for the different groups of growth habit and inflorescence
type: spring two-rowed (54 accessions), spring six-rowed
(33 accessions) and winter six-rowed (17 accessions). The
calculation was based on the approach described by [56].
We calculated r2 values between all unlinked loci and,
separately, r2 values for the loci in the same chromosome.
For each chromosome, r2 with p-values below 0.001 were
plotted against genetic distance (cM), and a second-degree
smoothed loess curve with 90% confidence limits was fit
using SAS PROC LOESS (SAS v9.1). The SAS macro
bctrans [57] was used to perform a Box-Cox power transformation [58] of the unlinked r 2 values in order to
approximate a normal distribution. The parametric 95th
percentile of the distribution was used as a threshold to
consider that LD was likely caused by genetic linkage. The
intersection of the Loess curve and its confidence bands
with a baseline drawn at the threshold value was considered to estimate the extent of LD, with confidence intervals, for each chromosome.
Association mapping and interaction analysis

Genome-wide association analysis was performed using
TASSEL 2.1. Four models were tested: (i) only markers as

Page 12 of 14

a fixed factor (M), (ii) markers as a fixed factor and the
population structure defined by the Q matrix as a co-variate (M+Q), (iii) markers as a fixed factor and the genetic
background as a random polygenic effect with a variance
covariance structure defined by the K matrix (M+K), and
(iv) markers as a fixed factor, the Q matrix as covariate
and genetic background as a random polygenic effect
(M’+Q+K). A False Discovery Rate multi-test adjustment
[59] was performed on the results and markers that
showed a p-value below 0.2 in the M+Q+K model were
selected for an analysis of interactions. To find the interactions that best explained the phenotypic data, we performed a likelihood ratio test (LRT) subtracting the -2 log
likelihood for the model that included the two markers
being tested, their interaction and the population structure
from the model that included only the population structure. Since these tests are for fixed effects parameters, -2
log likelihood for the models was estimated using the maximum likelihood method (ML) of SAS PROC MIXED
(SAS v9.1). The asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic is a c2 with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of fixed-effect parameters between the
two models. Validation of the results of AM analysis of
row type in the CAP I, II and III sets was done using TASSEL 2.1 and a M+Q+K model. Population structure was
determined by means of PCA using SAS PROC PRINCOMP and relatedness of individuals was corrected using
a the K matrix calculated with TASSEL 2.1.
