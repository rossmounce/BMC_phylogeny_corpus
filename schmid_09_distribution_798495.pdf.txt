Abstract
Background: HIV-1 viruses are highly capable of mutating their proteins to escape the
presentation of CTL epitopes in their current host. Upon transmission to another host, some
escape mutations revert, but other remain stable in the virus sequence for at least several years.
Depending on the rate of accumulation and reversion of escape mutations, HIV-1 could reach a
high level of adaptation to the human population. Yusim et. al. hypothesized that the apparent
clustering of CTL epitopes in the conserved regions of HIV-1 proteins could be an evolutionary
signature left by large-scale adaptation of HIV-1 to its human/simian host.
Results: In this paper we quantified the distribution of CTL epitopes in HIV-1 and found that that
in 99% of the HIV-1 protein sequences, the epitope distribution was indistinguishable from random.
Similar percentages were found for HCV, Influenza and for three eukaryote proteomes (Human,
Drosophila, Yeast).
Conclusion: We conclude that CTL epitopes in HIV-1 are randomly distributed, and that this
distribution is similar to the distribution of CTL epitopes in proteins from other proteomes.
Therefore, the visually apparent clustering of CTL epitopes in epitope maps should not be
interpreted as a signature of a past large-scale adaptation of HIV-1 to the human cellular immune
response.

Background
The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a highly
adaptive virus, capable of rapidly evolving its proteins to
escape cellular immune responses and antiretroviral drugs
(reviewed in [1] and [2]). This ability of the virus to rapidly adapt to its host has raised the question what level of
adaptation to the whole human population the virus will
eventually be able to reach. Currently there is no consensus on this point: on the one hand there are studies that
indicate that the current HIV-1 sequences contain signatures of global adaptation [3-8], while on the other hand
the virulence of the virus [9,10] as well as its predicted

number of cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitopes have remained
constant over time [11].
An alternative way to study viral adaptation would be to
look for tell-tale signatures of accumulated escape mutations in the virus. Yusim et. al. [12] suggested that the clustering of CTL epitopes is such a signature. They observed
that regions in the virus with a low density of CTL
epitopes were more variable than regions with a high
epitope density. Moreover, these variable regions had a
lower level of epitope precursors than the conserved
regions, and contained fewer amino acids that were suitaPage 1 of 15

ble to serve as anchor residues for MHC binding. This led
to the hypothesis that HIV-1 had escaped CTL epitopes
predominantly in the variable protein regions, and that
large-scale adaptation of the ancestral HIV-1 sequence to
the human host (or prior to that to the chimpanzee host)
had resulted in the clustering of CTL epitopes that is
observed in current-day HIV-1 sequences.
Another, more proximate hypothesis for the clustering of
epitopes was forwarded by Lucchiari-Hartz et. al. [13].
Based on the analysis of proteasomal degradation products in HIV-1, they showed that the epitope precursors
(and thus epitopes) occur preferentially in the more
hydrophobic regions of HIV-1 NEF and RT proteins. They
concluded that the clustering of epitopes is a generic feature of proteins, depending on the clustering of hydrophobic amino acids.
In this paper we tested whether CTL epitopes and hydrophobic amino acids in HIV-1 are significantly clustered,
and compared the distribution of predicted epitopes in
HIV-1 and other viruses to that of eukaryotes which are
not under selection pressure to escape the cellular
immune response. We discovered that for all tested protein sequences more than 95% of the epitope distributions, and more than 98% of the hydrophobic amino acid
distributions were likely to be random distributions. Secondly, we discovered that there is a large amount of variation in the epitope distribution within HIV-1 proteins,
similar to the amount of variation observed in eukaryote
proteins of an equal length. Both findings suggest that the
distribution of CTL epitopes in HIV-1 is similar to that of
other proteins, and that the apparent clustering of CTL
epitopes on HIV-1 epitope maps should not be interpreted as an indicator of past HIV-1 adaptation.

Methods
CTL epitope predictions
There are several algorithms [14-17] available that can
predict the location and binding specificity of CTL
epitopes in protein sequences. In this study we use the
MHC-pathway model [14], which allows us to screen all
possible peptide fragments of 14 amino acids within a
particular protein for their ability to be correctly processed
by the proteasome and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), and presented by the MHC class I
molecules. Peptide fragments that can be correctly processed by all three steps are subsequently marked as CTL
epitopes (Fig. 1). An extensive analysis of the quality of
these predictors can be found in the methods section of
Schmid et. al. [11]. A brief synopsis is that 81–97% of the
predicted CTL epitopes are indeed CTL epitopes [18,19].

The threshold values for the proteasome and TAP predictors (Fig. 1) were derived by applying the MHC-pathway

Figure 1
Schematic of the MHC-pathway model

14 amino acids is slided across a protein. Each of these '14
mers' consist of a N-terminal flanking region of 1 amino acid,
a 9 mer epitope candidate and a C-terminal flanking region of
4 amino acids. Beneath the 14 mer, the parts of the peptide
are marked which are used by the MHC, TAP or proteasome
predictors. Applying the 14 mer to the MHC, TAP and proteasome predictors results in three different scores. Only if
each of these scores is higher than a fixed threshold, the
epitope candidate is predicted to be a CTL epitope for the
MHC allele under consideration.

model to a large bacterial protein data set and selecting
the threshold values which corresponded to the estimated
specificity of the proteasome (33%) and TAP (76%) [20].
For the MHC-binding predictions we used the default
threshold of -2.7, which corresponds to an IC50 threshold
of 500 nM [21,22]. The predictors used in this paper are
available through a web interface (http://www.iedb.org
2006-01-01 version), and consist of an immunoproteasome cleavage predictor, a TAP transport predictor and 34
different MHC class I alleles binding predictors (18 for
human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A alleles and 14 for HLAB alleles). Based on our previous work with these predictors [11], we excluded the A*3002 and the B*0801 MHC
class I binding predictors for being too unspecific or specific, respectively.
Describing epitope clusters
CTL epitopes are traditionally defined by their amino acid
sequence, the start and end-point of the sequence mapped
onto a reference sequence, and the MHC class I allele that
they bind to. Based on this definition, a natural way to visually present CTL epitopes is an epitope map (Fig. 2).
However, for the statistical study of the clustering of CTL
epitopes it is more practical to reduce the position of a
particular epitope to a single point. In this paper we have
opted to use the C-terminal amino acid of CTL epitopes to
position an epitope in a protein sequence, as the C-terminal amino acid is the most defining property of an
epitope: amino acid substitutions at the C-terminal have
a large effect on proteasomal cleavage, TAP transportation
and MHC binding [23,24] (Fig. 1). One effect of this

predictors).

transformation is that epitopes are only defined by their
position in a protein, and no longer by the MHC allele(s)
that they bind. Thus, epitopes that only differ in the MHC
that they bind to will be reported as a single epitope.
Although this transformation makes it possible to perform a clustering analysis on the spatial distribution of
CTL epitopes, it might destroy an evolutionary signature
that is contained in the number of MHC alleles that bind
to individual epitope precursors. We discuss this in the
final section of the paper.
Clustering methods
Methods to describe the degree of clustering of sequential
events or spatial locations have been developed in a large
number of scientific fields, ranging from astronomy to
ecology and economics. These methods consider two features of a clustering: the 'intensity' and the 'grain'. The
intensity reflects the difference in object density between
the rich and poor regions, and the grain describes how frequently rich and poor regions alternate [25]. In this paper
we will use two methods: the cumulative binomial probability (CBP) method [26], and the Hopkins and Skellam
index (H&S) [25,27].

Regarding the cumulative binomial probability method
(CBP) [26]: this method can be used to determine
whether a particular amino acid lies in a region that is
rich, poor or neutral in epitope density (Eq. 1). For example, to determine whether a particular amino acid is
located in an epitope-rich region, one first counts the
number of epitope C-terminals (e) in a window of size w,

and then, based on the average epitope-density in the protein (f), one calculates the chance of finding e or more
epitope C-terminals in a window of that size (i = e, i = e +
1, i = ...,i = w). If this chance P falls below a certain threshold (0.05 in this paper), all amino acids in that window
are marked as belonging to an epitope-rich region. The
same approach can be used to determine which amino
acids belong to epitope-poor regions. The CBP method
makes it possible to objectively determine the location of
epitope-rich and epitope-poor regions in a protein. These
locations can be plotted to generate a CBP profile (see Fig.
3).

Regarding the Hopkins and Skellam index (H&S) [25,27]:
this method is based on the observation that in a fully random distribution (of an infinite size), the distance from a
starting point to the nearest object of interest is not influenced by the presence or absence of such an object at the
starting point. In an over-dispersed distribution, the presence of an object at the starting point will mean that the
nearest object is on average further away than when starting at a random location, while in a clustered distribution,
the reverse is true. The ratio is calculated as the sum of
squared distances from a random point to the nearest
object (dr) to the sum of squared distances from a random
object to the nearest object (do). When the number of dr

Example of the cumulative binomial probability profiles of 3 HIV-1 NEF protein sequences. Each profile features
the position of predicted epitope C-terminals in the protein sequence (black dots), a running average of the C-terminal density

(accession number: AJ233029) has a low probability to arise from a random distribution of CTL epitopes, based on the Hopkins and Skellam index of clustering, but less so according to the CBP method. (Panel A, CBP: prich = 0.0056, ppoor = 0.0062;
H&S: p = 0.015. Panel B, CBP: prich = 0.06, ppoor not computable for a window size of 15 or smaller (see Methods); H&S: p <

and do measurements are not equal, the sum of squared
distance of dr and do should be divided by the number of
dr measurements (n) and do measurements (m), respectively. The ratio will be a number (R) between 0 for perfectly over-dispersed distributions, and infinity for fully
clustered distributions (Eq. 2). In this way the distribution
of epitopes within a protein can be characterized by a single ratio. In this paper we normalized the range of the

H&S index in such a way that the index runs from 0 to 2,
rather than from 0 to infinity, by translating any score
above one to 2 - (1/score).
Both the CBP method and the H&S index take into
account the 'intensity' and the 'grain' of epitope distributions and correct for the epitope density of the protein.
One difference between the two methods is that the latter
gives a higher clustering score to coarse grained distribuPage 4 of 15

(see results, section 'No clustering of epitopes').

Statistical testing
The significance of both clustering measures can be tested
with permutation tests [28-30]. Permutations are created
by randomizing the positions of the epitope C-terminals
in the protein that is under scrutiny. The p-value of the test
is the fraction of cases in which the randomized sequence
has an equal or more extreme outcome than the original
sequence. In the case of the CBP method the outcome was
measured as the fraction of the protein that is part of an
epitope-rich region (or epitope-poor region, when studying those). In the case of the H&S index, the outcome was
measured as the absolute difference of the index score
from 1.0 (the expected score for a random distribution).
Hydrophobicity
In order to determine whether hydrophobicity is clustered, we calculated the clustering of the top 4 hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Ile, Phe, and Trp, according to both
the HPLC pH 7.4 scale [31] used by Lucchiari-Hartz et. al.
[13], and the consensus scale [32]), with the CBP method
and the H&S index. This is somewhat different from the
more common approach of calculating the running average hydrophobicity and setting one or two thresholds to
determine the hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas of a
protein, (as was done in the study of Lucchiari-Hartz et. al.
[13]). However, it has the advantage that we can use the
same method for determining epitope clustering and
hydrophobic amino acid clustering.
Data sets
The public data sets used in this paper originate from a
variety of sources. Pre-aligned HIV-1 and HCV data (size:
13093 and 8886 proteins, respectively) were downloaded
from
the
Los
Alamos
laboratories
(http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov, http://www.hcv.lanl.gov), and the
influenza data set (size: 47194 proteins) was downloaded
from Biohealthbase (http://www.biohealthbase.org,
under Influenza Virus, Database Search, Sequence), by
selecting for all available proteins from human influenza
type A, B or C. A Human [33] (IPI.human.prot, size:
72082 unique proteins), Drosophila (size: 23694 unique
proteins), and a Yeast proteome (size: 5863 unique proteins) were downloaded from Integrate http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/integr8/. All data sets were downloaded
on 13 Aug 2008.

The public HIV-1 and HCV data sets are already curated,
and do not contain multiple clones from one isolate, or
multiple sequences from a single person. Furthermore,
very similar groups of sequences (based on phylogenetic
tree analysis) are also reduced to a single sequence. In all
three eukaryote proteomes, only unique protein
sequences are used.

Results and discussion
Imprints of immune evasion in HIV-1
HIV-1 is capable of maintaining escape mutations to CTL
epitopes in the absence of immune selection pressure of a
MHC-matched host [35,36], and thus escape variants of
HIV-1 can become the consensus HIV-1 sequence [3,4].
Escape variants with a low fitness cost or compensatory
mutations revert slowly or not at all [8,37], and could
quickly accumulate in the virus [4,36]. Fig. 4A sketches the
fast spread of a non-reverting escape variant in a hypothetical transmission network. Even though the hosts which
carry an MHC allele that can bind to the CTL epitope are
not optimally positioned in the transmission network, it
only takes a few transmissions before the majority (54%)
of the hosts carries the escape variant of the virus.

Yusim et. al. [12] studied the apparent clustering of CTL
epitopes in HIV-1 epitope maps, and found a negative correlation between CTL epitope density and sequence variability in HIV-1. Based on the paucity of epitope precursors
and suitable MHC anchor residues in the variable protein
regions, Yusim et. al. [12] concluded that the lack of
epitopes in the variable regions was a signature of
immune evasion of the virus. The conserved protein
regions were assumed have more constraints related to
protein function, and the virus would have fewer viable
options to generate escape variants in these regions [12],
because the escapes made in these conserved regions
would carry a higher fitness cost [38,39]. As a result,
Yusim et. al. [12] argued that the accumulation of escape
mutations would be slower, and reversion of escape mutations faster in conserved protein regions than in variable
regions. These ideas are depicted in Fig. 4B. This difference
in the rate of accumulation of escape mutations between
the variable and conserved protein regions is expected to
result in a clustering of CTL epitopes once the virus has
accumulated a substantial number of escape mutations.
Taken together, Yusim et al. [12] concluded that the
apparent clustering of CTL epitopes in epitope maps was
a signature of a large-scale adaptation of HIV-1 to the
human population.

CTL epitope can rapidly become the consensus sequence if reversion of the escape happens little or not at all. Of the 50 hosts
(circles), only 5 hosts (filled circles) carry an MHC allele that can bind the epitope. The black circles represent hosts that are
infected by the escape variant of the virus, but lack the relevant MHC allele. Grey lines represent transmission of the wildtype
virus, whereas black lines represent transmission of the escape variant. (B) Schematic of the accumulation of escapes in the variable protein regions. When escape mutations occur more often, or reversion happen more slowly in variable protein regions
(gray shaded areas), and the number of accumulated escape mutations is large enough, a clustering of CTL epitopes (plotted as
arrow-delimited lines) is to be expected. One underlying assumption is that the variable and conserved protein regions are
larger than a few amino acids in size [12].

Clustering in epitope maps
The first reports that the CTL epitopes of HIV-1 occurred
in clusters [39-41] were published only a few years after
the discovery of HIV-1 CTL epitopes themselves [42,43].
However, the degree of clustering of CTL epitopes has
never been tested rigorously, perhaps because the method
by which epitope positions are visualized in epitope maps
strongly suggests that a clustering exists (Fig. 2). Here we
list a number of reasons why epitope maps may give an
unjust impression of clustering:

1. The epitope map is a compilation of the CTL
epitopes found in a large number of sequences. Amino
acid variants of the same epitope are all depicted at the
same position of the reference sequence, but never
occur simultaneously in a single HIV-1 sequence.

2. CTL epitopes that have not been mapped precisely
to their minimal length can end up occurring more
than once on the epitope maps as N- or C-terminal
extended versions of an epitope.
3. Epitope precursors are expected to be generated at
roughly 25% of the positions in a protein [20]. The
large polymorphism in MHC class I alleles makes it
likely that a single epitope precursor binds to multiple
MHC alleles [44]. Therefore, the absence or presence
of an epitope precursor at a certain position results in
either zero or many epitopes reported at that position.
4. CTL epitopes on the maps are vertically ordered to
be non-overlapping. This representation results in
empty corridors between large slanted towers of

Page 6 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:184

epitopes. The corridors need not correspond to
epitope-poor regions, but are a visual effect of the representation.
All four reasons listed amplify the difference between
epitope-rich and epitope-poor regions, with the result that
a strong clustering of CTL epitopes appears to exist. Most
of these reasons have already been listed by the scientists
maintaining the epitope maps at http://www.hiv.lanl.gov,
but the suggestive effect on epitope clustering is not mentioned explicitly. We removed these amplifications by
using CTL epitope predictors (removing 2.) on a persequence basis (removing 1.), and by only plotting their
C-terminal position (remove 3. and 4.). This transformation results in a binary pattern of epitope C-terminal positions: each position being either an epitope or a nonepitope (see Fig. 2, Methods). Although necessary for a
meaningful analysis of the clustering of CTL epitopes, the
transformation could potentially destroy an evolutionary
signal if HIV-1 has evolved to have fewer MHC alleles
binding per epitope precursors in certain protein regions.
We will consider this option in the discussion.
We use epitope predictors rather than lists of known CTL
epitopes, as the predicted epitopes are less influenced by
an 'attention bias' than experimentally defined CTL
epitopes. An attention bias can be caused by researchers
focusing on hot topics or building on previous work.
Assarsson et. al. [45] showed that as a result of this bias,
certain protein regions in Influenza are mistakenly classified as CTL epitope-rich or poor.
Epitope predictors, such as the MHC-pathway algorithm,
predict proteasomal cleavage, transporter associated with
antigen processing (TAP) and MHC class I binding [14]
for all peptide fragments within a protein. Those fragments that can be processed by each of these steps are predicted to be CTL epitopes (see Fig. 1). As the MHCpathway algorithm has been tested extensively [21] and
has proven to have a high reliability [18,19] (see Methods), it allowed us to avoid a possible 'attention bias' in
HIV-1 protein regions or strains.
No clustering of epitopes
We applied two distinct methods of measuring distributions to the epitope distribution of HIV-1 proteins. The
first method divides proteins into epitope-rich, epitopepoor, and neutral regions, based on the cumulative binomial probability (CBP) [26] of having e or more amino
acids predicted as an epitope C-terminal in a window of
size w (Eq. 1). The second method is the Hopkins and
Skellam (H&S) index [25,27], which compares the average distance from an epitope to its nearest epitope with
the average distance from a random amino acid to the
nearest epitope within proteins (Eq. 2). Both methods are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/184

subjected to permutation tests in order to establish per
protein the significance of its distribution of CTL epitopes.
A more extensive discussion of these methods and the permutation testing is available in the Methods section.
Using both the CBP method and the H&S index, we find
protein sequences in HIV-1 with CTL epitope distributions that are likely to be random, as well as distributions
that are likely to be clustered. We visualized a few of these
protein sequences using CBP profiles (Fig. 3), as well as a
sequence in which the positions of the CTL epitopes were
randomized. Note that each of the four visualized
sequences, including the randomized one, contain
epitope-rich and/or epitope-poor regions. Thus, the mere
presence of epitope-rich or epitope-poor regions in a protein does not need to imply that adaptation has occurred
in that region.
We analyzed the predicted CTL epitope distribution in a
data set of 11017 HIV-1 proteins from the Los Alamos
HIV-1 Sequence compendium with the CBP method, and
found that in 99% of these sequences the fraction of
epitope-rich regions was not significantly different from
random (p < 0.001, permutation test). Only 158
sequences had a larger fraction of epitope-rich regions
than likely to arise in a random distribution of CTL
epitopes. These 158 sequences predominantly occurred in
two specific HIV-1 proteins: HIV-1 VPU (79×) and HIV-1
ENV (74×). Changing the window size w from 15 to 9 or
23 shifted the number of significant sequences towards
VPU or ENV, respectively, but did not affect the overall
lack of significantly clustered CTL epitopes. Similar to
what we found for the epitope-rich regions, only 153
sequences in HIV-1 had a larger fraction of epitope-poor
regions than expected, most of which occurred in VPU
(135×).
The H&S index gives a similar result as the CBP method:
only 68 HIV-1 protein sequences (0.6%) had a predicted
epitope distribution that is significantly more clustered
than expected from a random distribution, and most of
these occurred in the VPU protein (55×). The distribution
of CTL epitopes in the predicted ancestral HIV-1 clade B
sequences [34] (green dots, Fig. 5B) is also not significantly different from random. The fact that we found HIV1 ENV and VPU to be the proteins in which some sign of
clustering occurred would not be what one expects if the
clustering would be due to adaptation. The GAG protein
would have been a more obvious candidate, both for its
early presentation on the cell surface [46] and its immunodominant CTL epitopes [47].
There is a remarkable large variation between sequences
of the same protein in both the CBP and the H&S methods. Sequences range from being devoid of epitope-rich

protein regions to having 20% of their amino acids
belonging to an epitope-rich region in the CBP method
(Fig. 5A). The same holds for epitope-poor regions (data
not shown). Sequences range from a highly clustered to a
moderately over-dispersed H&S index score (Fig. 5B),
even when reducing the data set to specific HIV-1 clades
(data not shown). Apparently, even within closely related
sequences, relatively small amino acid differences can
cause large variations in the degree of CTL epitope clustering, up to a degree that the H&S index score variation for
most of HIV-1's proteins is similar to that of randomized
proteins of the same size. The POL and TAT proteins displayed less variation than expected for their protein size.

A comparison of the three eukaryote proteomes revealed
that their CTL epitope distributions are remarkably similar to each other. In all three proteomes there is a steady
trend towards clustered epitope distributions with
increasing protein size (Fig. 6B, grey line). It could be that
these significant proteins contain more structural motifs
and repeating elements that the other proteins, and that
these motifs influence the epitope distribution [49,50].
The percentage of significantly clustered sequences (H&S)
is a few percentage-points higher than in the viruses
(Human: 1.9%, Drosophila: 3.4%, Yeast: 1.9%, at a p <
0.001, permutation test), but is still only a small percentage of all sequences.

When comparing the significantly clustered sequences
predicted by both methods, we find an overlap of 21%.
While this is significantly higher than the expected overlap of 1.4% (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.0008), the two methods are often in disagreement whether a sequence is
significantly clustered. This could be due to the difference
in how both methods valuate the 'grain' of a pattern (i.e.
how frequently rich and poor regions alternate). The H&S
index valuates coarse-grained clusters (Fig. 5) above fine
grained clusters, whereas the CBP method does the opposite.

An overlay of HIV-1 on the human proteome shows that
the H&S clustering scores for HIV-1 proteins fall within
the range of scores for human proteins (Fig. 7). The variation within HIV-1 proteins spans about the same range as
proteins of comparable size in the human proteome. This
is surprising, as the sequences within HIV-1 proteins are
closely related to each other, and would therefore be
expected to have a smaller range of clustering scores (for
the POL and TAT protein this seems to be partially true).

Comparison between species
Although CTL epitopes in HIV-1 are typically randomly
distributed (Fig. 5), a direct comparison of the CTL
epitope distributions between virus and eukaryote proteomes might reveal a difference between both groups
that is due to immune selection pressure. We included
two additional virus sequence data sets in the analysis,
namely the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Influenza, and
picked three eukaryote proteomes: the human Homo sapiens, fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster [48] and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. The latter two are proteomes
that normally do not come into contact with the human
antigen presentation pathway, and should therefore not
be adapted to it.

The distribution of predicted CTL epitopes in HCV and
Influenza was similar to that of HIV-1. The vast majority
of sequences featured a random distribution of CTL
epitopes (> 99%), and a large amount of variation in H&S
clustering score per protein, just as seen in HIV-1 (Fig.
6A). Although in all three viruses some proteins tended
towards clustering, and others towards over-dispersion of
epitopes, we have not been able to detect a pattern in
these tendencies. One difference between the viruses was
that the small fraction of significantly clustered sequences
was somewhat higher in HIV-1 (0.6%) than in HCV
(0.01%) and Influenza (0.00%), but as we are comparing
many related copies of only a small number of proteins,
this difference could well be due to chance.

Summarizing, the CTL epitopes of > 99% of HIV-1, HCV
and Influenza sequences were found to be randomly distributed. A comparison between viral and eukaryote proteomes showed no qualitative differences in the epitope
distribution between the two groups that would point
towards the adaptation of viruses to the human host.
No clustering of hydrophobic amino acids
An alternative hypothesis on epitope clustering that was
forwarded by Lucchiari-Hartz et. al. [13], challenged the
idea that the distribution reflected the adaptation of HIV1 to its new host, and suggested that the clustering of CTL
epitopes merely mirrored the clustering of hydrophobic
amino acids. As the proteasome, the TAP, and many of the
MHC alleles favor hydrophobic amino acids at or near
their C-terminal end [20,51,52], a clustering of hydrophobic amino acids would result in a clustering of epitope
precursors, and subsequently results in a clustering of CTL
epitopes.

Our results thus far dispute the idea that CTL epitopes are
clustered, as we found the epitope distribution in the vast
majority (> 99%) of protein sequences to be not different
from a random distribution. Therefore we wondered if
hydrophobic amino acids are truly clustered in proteins,
and repeated our clustering analysis for hydrophobic
amino acids. By taking the four most hydrophobic amino
acids (Leu, Ile, Phe and Trp [31,32]), we could construct
binary maps similar to the transformed epitope maps of
Fig. 2.

Figure 7
An overlay of HIV-1 proteins on top of the human proteome
An overlay of HIV-1 proteins on top of the human proteome. The degree of clustering of CTL epitopes in proteins is
determined by the H&S index and plotted against protein length. Significantly clustered sequences are denoted in yellow dots
for the human proteome, and in red dots for HIV-1 (p < 0.001, permutation test). The index scores of HIV-1 fall within the
range found in human proteomes, suggesting that the epitope distribution pattern of HIV-1 is not extraordinary.

We found that nearly 100% of the protein sequences in
HIV-1 had no significant clustering of hydrophobic
amino acids in their primary structure (Fig. 8C). The biophysical community is somewhat divided on this point:
depending on the method used and the subset of proteins
studied, both random [53] and non-random distributions
[49,54] have been reported. We agree that some signs of
non-randomness is to be expected in the distribution of
amino acids in proteins, as common protein structures
like a helices, and β sheets have a certain periodicity in
their use of hydrophobic amino acids [49]. However,
because we find so few proteins in which hydrophobic
amino acids are significantly clustered, it seems safe to
conclude that the effect of protein structure on the distribution of hydrophobic amino acids is rather subtle.
As was shown previously by Lucchiari-Hartz et. al. [13],
hydrophobic amino acids and the location of epitope Cterminals in HIV-1 correlate. This is visible in CBP profiles
(Fig. 8A, 8B, black and grey lines), and statistically confirmed in the overlap between sequences with significantly clustered epitope distributions and significantly
clustered hydrophobic amino acid distributions in the
human proteome (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.0001, n =
69685). Summarizing, we find that epitope-poor regions

correlate with hydrophilic regions, but that neither
epitopes nor hydrophobic amino acids are distributed in
a way that is significantly different from a random distribution.

Conclusion
We showed that the vast majority (>99%) of HIV-1, HCV
and Influenza proteins has a predicted CTL epitope distribution that is indistinguishable from a random distribution (Fig. 5). Additionally, the distribution of
hydrophobic amino acids in these proteins is also likely to
be random (Fig. 8C). These findings cast doubt on two
recent hypothesis in which it was argued that the clustering of CTL epitopes in HIV-1 proteins is the product of
virus adaptation [12], or the result of clustered hydrophobic amino acids [13], respectively.
To further investigate if there was any sign of evolution in
the distribution of CTL epitopes in viruses, we compared
three virus proteomes to the proteomes of Human, Drosophila and Yeast (Fig. 6). We found that the epitope distribution in HIV-1 proteins, as measured by the Hopkins
& Skellam index score, is not extraordinary and falls
within the range of proteins of comparable size in the
human proteome (Fig. 7). Remarkably, the variation in

epitope distribution that exists for any HIV-1 protein
when sampling the virus from many hosts, is as broad as
the whole range of distributions found between all
eukaryotic proteins of a comparable size as the sampled
HIV-1 protein. Such a large amount of variation in
epitope distributions is not what one would expect if HIV1 has been undergoing large-scale adaptation to the
human population. If HIV-1 had been globally accumulating the same CTL epitope escapes in its variable protein
regions [12], the distribution of CTL epitopes within HIV1 viruses should be converging towards one particular distribution.

The transformation that we applied to analyse the spatial
distribution of CTL epitopes in proteins (discussed in section 4.2 and 5.2) could have destroyed one possible fingerprint of HIV-1 adaptation, namely that in its variable
regions, HIV-1 has adapted to select for epitope precursor
to which only a limited number of MHC alleles can bind
[12]. We found that, compared to a random distribution,
a larger fraction of epitope precursors is predicted not to
bind to any of the 32 studied MHC alleles (33%) than
expected. Furthermore, the number of epitope precursors
that bind to 1, 2 or 3 MHC molecules is underrepresented,
whereas the number of epitope precursors that bind to 4

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:184

or more MHC molecules is over-represented in HIV-1.
This pattern of under- and over-representation strongly
suggests that the number of MHC alleles that can bind to
a particular amino acid sequence is clustered. However,
this pattern is not only observed for HIV-1 proteins, but
also for HCV, Influenza, and the Human proteome (Fig.
9), which suggests that the clustering of MHC alleles over
epitope precursors reflects patterns in the binding preferences of MHC alleles, and not as much a fingerprint of
HIV-1 adaptation to its human host.
Whether or not HIV-1 is currently adapting to the human
population is debated in the literature, and investigated
with the help of a variety of methods [3-10,12]. We have
previously reported that HIV-1 did not show any largescale adaptation to the cellular immune response over the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/184

last three decades [11], using HIV-1 population sequence
data sets and CTL epitope predictors. In this paper we
show that the distribution of predicted CTL epitopes in
HIV-1 appears to be random, and is similar to the distribution of CTL epitopes in organisms that are not under
selection pressure to escape the human antigen presentation pathway. Therefore we conclude that the visually
apparent clustering of CTL epitopes in epitope maps
should not be interpreted as a signature of a past largescale adaptation of HIV-1 to the human cellular immune
response.

Figure 9
MHC alleles are clustered over epitope precursors
MHC alleles are clustered over epitope precursors. A
single epitope precursor will be predicted to bind somewhere between 0 and 32 HLA molecules (as for 32 MHC
alleles there are SMM binding predictors available). In a situation where MHC alleles are randomly distributed over
epitope precursors, each MHC allele has a chance to bind to
an epitope precursor with the same chance as the specificity
of that MHC allele (which for a threshold of IC50 500 nM
ranged from 0.5% to 13% of the epitope precursors). Given a
random distribution, 18% of the epitope precursors are
expected to bind to none of the available MHC alleles, 33%
to bind a single MHC allele, and 49% to bind 2 or more MHC
alleles (black line). In contrast with the random distribution,
the predicted distribution for HIV-1 shows a higher percentage of epitope precursors that bind no epitope precursors,
fewer than expected epitope precursors that bind between 1
and 3 MHC alleles, and more than expected epitope precursors that bind to 4 or more MHC alleles (red line). Not only
HIV-1, but also HCV, Influenza, and the Human proteome
follow this pattern.
