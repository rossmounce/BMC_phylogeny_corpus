Abstract
Background: The Tax proteins encoded by human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and
type 2 (HTLV-2) are transcriptional activators of both the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) and
cellular promoters via the CREB and NFkB pathways. In contrast to HTLV-1, HTLV-2 has been
classified into four distinct genetic subtypes A, B, C and D defined by phylogenetic analysis of their
nucleotide sequences and the size and amino acid sequence of their Tax proteins. In the present
study we have analysed and compared the transactivating activities of three Tax 2A and one Tax
2B proteins using LTR and NFkB reporter assays.
Results: We found that with the exception of the prototype Tax 2A Mo protein, the other two
Tax 2A proteins failed to transactivate either the viral LTR or NFkB promoter in Jurkat and 293T
cells. Loss of activity was not associated with either expression levels or an alteration in subcellular
distribution as all Tax 2 proteins were predominantly located in the cytoplasm of transfected cells.
Analysis of the sequence of the two inactive Tax 2A proteins relative to Mo indicated that one had
six amino acid changes and the other had one change in the central region of the protein. Mutations
present at the amino and the extreme carboxy termini of Mo resulted in the loss of LTR but not
NFkB activation whereas those occurring in the central region of the protein appeared to abolish
transactivation of both promoters. Analysis of the transactivation phenotypes of Tax 1, Tax 2A Mo
and Tax 2B containing mutations identified in the present study or previously characterised Tax
mutations showed that domains required for LTR and NFkB activation are very similar but not
identical in all three Tax proteins.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that loss of activity of two Tax 2A proteins derived from different
isolates is associated with multiple amino acid changes relative to Mo in domains required for the
activation of the CREB or CREB and NFkB pathways and that these domains are very similar but
not identical in Tax 2B and Tax 1. The loss of Tax function in 2A viruses may have implications for
their biological and pathogenic properties.

Background
HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are closely related human retroviruses which have a preferential in vivo tropism for CD4 +
and CD8 + T lymphocytes respectively. HTLV-1 is the
causative agent of adult T cell leukaemia (ATL) and a neurodegenerative disorder, tropical spastic paraparesis or
HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM) [1-4]. In contrast, the role of HTLV-2 in human disease is less clearly
defined; however increasing evidence suggests that infection may also be associated with rare lympho-proliferative
and neurological disorders [5-7].
In addition to the essential retroviral proteins Gag, Pol
and Env, HTLV encodes a number of regulatory and accessory proteins that modulate viral gene expression and play
important roles in viral pathogenesis. The most widely
studied of these is the transactivating protein Tax [8]. Tax
is known to alter cellular signalling pathways by interacting with a number of cellular transcription factors including activating transcription factor/c-AMP response
element-binding protein (ATF/CREB) and NFkB. Specifically Tax enhances transcription of the viral genome by
interacting with CREB/ATF which increases its affinity for
conserved binding sites within the LTR and cellular promoters. With respect to the NFkB pathway, cytoplasmic
Tax acts by binding the IKK γ which induces the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB-α, the inhibitor of NFkB,
thereby allowing the NFkB complex to migrate to the
nucleus and induce gene expression.
The different subtypes of HTLV-1 encode Tax proteins
(Tax 1) of equal lengths. In contrast, HTLV-2 has four distinct genetic subtypes, A, B, C and D, defined by phylogenetic analysis of their nucleotide sequences and the size
and amino acid sequence of their Tax proteins. The Tax
proteins of HTLV-2 (Tax 2) vary in length, with Tax 2B and
-2C having similar lengths to Tax 1, 356 and 353 amino
acids respectively, although the C-terminal sequences of
these proteins are divergent [9,10]. Tax 2A lacks a 25
amino acid C terminal sequence having a stop codon
which truncates the protein at amino acid 331. HTLV-2D
encodes a Tax protein of 344 amino acids that as yet
remains uncharacterised [11]. Studies comparing the relative transactivation functions of Tax 1 and Tax 2 indicate
that, with the exception of Tax 2A, there are no significant
differences in transactivation activities via CREB and
NFκB pathways between the Tax proteins of these two
viruses and suggest that Tax 2B may have the same pathogenic potential as Tax 1 [12].
Several studies have identified functional domains in Tax
1 which are required for NFkB and LTR activation. These
regions include activation domains at the amino and carboxy termini, a CREB binding domain and zinc binding
domain within the first 60 amino acids [13,14]. Tax 1 and

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/20

Tax 2 contain nuclear localization signals (NLS) at the
amino terminus between amino acids 1–60 [15] and 1–
40 [16], respectively, and nuclear export signals (NES)
located between amino acids 188 and 202 [17,18]. Using
mutations previously characterised in Tax 1, Tax 2A was
found to contain similar but not identical functional
domains as Tax 1 [19]. Various studies reported that Tax 1
shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and
depending on the cell line is predominantly located in the
nucleus [20,21]. A recent study has shown that in contrast
to Tax 1, Tax 2A and Tax 2B are predominantly found in
the cytoplasm of either a HTLV-2 infected cell line or cells
transfected with Tax 2 expression plasmids [22]. Using
chimeric plasmids containing domains from Tax 1 and
Tax 2 it could be shown that amino acids 90 to 100 are
involved in the cytoplasmic localization of Tax 2.
In a previous study we reported that some Tax 2A proteins
exhibit poor transactivation of both the CREB and NFkB
pathways and this appeared to be related to decreased levels of Tax 2A expression [12]. The aims of the present
study were firstly, to examine the ability of different Tax
2A proteins to transactivate the viral LTR and a NFkB promoter in relation to expression levels, sequence variation
and sub-cellular distribution and secondly, to determine
if Tax 2A and Tax 2B have similar functional domains. We
show that two Tax 2A proteins were non-functional relative to the prototype 2A Mo protein in either Jurkat or
293T cells. Loss of activity was not correlated with Tax 2A
expression levels or altered sub cellular distribution but
appears to be due to the presence of amino acid changes.
We identified previously uncharacterised mutations in the
non-functional Tax 2A proteins that result in either defective LTR and NFkB activation or defective LTR but not
NFkB activation. These mutations resulted in similar but
not identical transactivation phenotypes in Tax 2B.

Results
Transactivation phenotypes of Tax 2A Lor and Gar
In the present study we examined the transactivation phenotypes of two Tax 2A proteins Lor and Gar and compared
this with the prototype 2A isolate, Mo. Lor was derived
from a HTLV IIA infected cell line and Gar was derived
from cultured PBMCs from a HTLV-2/HIV-1 co-infected
patient (W. Hall unpublished). All Tax coding sequences
were cloned in the same expression plasmid and were
tagged with a HIS tag to allow the simultaneous detection
of all Tax proteins. A HTLV-1 LTR-LUC reporter was used
in this study to assess the activity of Tax 2 proteins as previous studies have shown that there is no significant difference in the ability of Tax 2 proteins to activate the LTR
from either HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 [19]. Functional assays
were performed in Jurkat cells as these cells are lymphocytes and represent the natural targets of HTLV in vivo.

In initial studies we employed well characterised Tax
mutants in our assays as had been reported in other studies. Specifically we tested the transactivation activities of
the Tax 2A Mo mutants designated M22 (S130A/L131F),
which was shown in previous studies to result in LTR but
not NFkB activation, and M47 (I319R/L320S), which was
shown to abolish activation of the LTR by Tax 2A Mo
while not affecting NFkB activation [13,14]. These
mutants displayed the expected transactivation phenotype (Table 1). Similar results were also obtained with the
Tax 2B M22 and Tax 2B M47 mutants. Tax 2A Lor and Gar
failed to transactivate either the viral LTR or NFkB promoters in Jurkat and 293T cells compared to the prototype
Tax 2A protein Mo or Tax 2B (Figure 1A and 1B, respectively). Wildtype Mo was repeatedly found to activate the
LTR and NFkB promoters less efficiently than Tax 2B, for
example 60% and 40% in Jurkat cells and 40% and 20%
in 293T cells, respectively. Mo, Lor, Gar and Tax 2B were
all expressed at similar levels in 293T cells (Figure 1C).
Sub cellular localisation of Tax 2 proteins
A previous study demonstrated that Tax function was
related to its sub-cellular localisation, with the highest levels of LTR and NFkB activity being observed when Tax was
predominantly located in either the nucleus or cytoplasm,
respectively [22]. We sought to determine if the intracellular distribution of Lor and Gar was altered compared to
that of Mo and Tax 2B. Immunofluorescence studies
showed that Gar and Lor were found predominantly in
the cytoplasm but also appeared as intense specks in the
nucleus of 293T cells (data not shown) and Cos 7 cells
and displayed a similar intra cellular distribution as Mo
and Tax 2B (Figure 2). These results clearly indicate that
the sub cellular distribution of Lor or Gar was not contributing to their loss of activity.
Sequence analysis of Lor and Gar Tax proteins
The sequences of Lor and Gar were determined and compared to that of Mo. Lor had six amino acid changes spanning the entire protein at positions G21D, L87I, P92L,
T204A, W248R and L308V (Figure 3B). Gar only contained one amino acid change at position Y144C. G21D
and L308V are located in a domain previously found to be
involved in LTR activation while L87I and P92L are close
to a domain previously found to be involved in the cytoplasmic localization of Tax 2 proteins (Figure 3A) [19,22].
W248R and Y144C are located in the central region of Mo
which was shown in previous studies to be important in
the activation of both CREB and NFkB pathways by Mo
[19].
Ability of Tax 2A mutants to transactivate the HTLV-1 LTR
and NFkB promoters
Initially site directed mutagenesis was used to sequentially
replace each mutation present in Lor with the correspond-

ing wildtype Mo residues starting from the amino terminus (Table 2; L1 to L5). Activation of both the LTR and
NFkB promoters was only restored in Lor L5 when the
mutation at position W248R was replaced by the corresponding wildtype Mo residue indicating that this position is critical for Tax 2A activity. Lor L6, which contains
all the mutations found in Lor except for W248R, failed to
activate the LTR while displaying wildtype levels of NFkB
activity. All Lor mutants were expressed at similar levels
(Figure 4). Insertion of individual mutations found in Lor
into Mo showed that most mutations and particularly
G21D, L87I, and P92L substantially reduced the ability of
Mo to transactivate the LTR and without affecting NFkB
activity (Table 3). Analysis of the subcellular location of
mutant proteins in Cos 7 cells using immunofluorescence
did not reveal any discernable alterations in their distribution relative to wildtype Mo (data not shown). The mutation L308V did not appear to affect the ability of Mo to
transactivate either promoter. One mutation at position
T204A appeared to enhance the ability of Mo to activate
both the LTR and NFkB promoters to levels above those
obtained with Tax 2B. This mutant was expressed at a similar level to wildtype Mo (Figure 4). As expected the mutation at position W248R abolished the ability of Mo to
activate either the LTR or NFkB promoters. However this
mutant appeared to be expressed at a lower level than
wildtype Mo or other Mo mutants (Figure 4). Insertion of
the only mutation found in Gar Y144C into Mo abolished
its ability to activate either the LTR or NFkB promoters. To
determine if the residue at position Y144, and not only
the mutation Y144C, is important for Mo activity an
arginine instead of a cysteine was introduced at this position. Mo Y144R displayed the same phenotype as Y144C
indicating that this position is important for Mo activity
irrespective of which residue is present. Insertion of
Y144C into Tax 1 only reduced its activity while W248R
abolished both LTR and NFkB activation by Tax 1. While
Tax 1 W248R was expressed at a similar level to Tax 1 WT,
Tax 1 Y144C was very poorly expressed (Figure 4).
Transactivation phenotypes of Tax 2B mutants
Given the high degree of homology between Tax2A and
Tax 2B we sought to compare functional domains in both
proteins by introducing the mutations found in Gar and
Lor into Tax 2B (Table 4). In a similar manner to its effect
on Mo and Tax 1, W248R abolished the ability of 2B to
activate either the LTR or NFkB promoters and similar to
its effects on Tax 1 Y144C appeared to only reduce the
activity of Tax 2B. However the introduction of an
arginine instead of a cysteine at this position (Y144R) into
Tax 2B abolished its activity indicating that this position
is important for function but may depend on the amino
acid present. Mutations at positions G21D, L87I, P92L
and L308V appeared to have similar effects on Tax 2B
activity as they had on the activity of Mo in as much as

they substantially reduced LTR activation while not affecting the activation of NFkB. As was previously noted
wildtype Mo was found to activate the CREB and NFkB
pathways less efficiently than Tax 2B (Table 3). This difference was abolished by the introduction of the mutation

T204A into Mo. An alanine occurs naturally at this position in Tax 2B, the mutation of which to a threonine
(A204T) results in similar transactivation activities as Mo
(Table 4). This indicates that this residue is responsible for
the differences found in the activities of both proteins. All

Jurkat cells were co-transfected with 250 ng of the indicated Tax 2
plasmids, 1 ug of the LTR or NFkB luciferase reporters and 50 ng of
the control Renilla plasmid pRL TK. After 24 hrs, the cells were lysed
and reporter activities were measured using a Turner 20/20
Luminometer. Firefly reporter activities were normalised using Renilla
luciferase values. Normalised values for mutant Tax proteins were
calculated as a percentage of the wildtype Mo or Tax 2B values which
was set at 100%.

Tax 2B mutants, including 2B A204T (data not shown),
were expressed at levels similar to wildtype Tax 2B except
for W248R which appeared to be poorly expressed in a
manner similar to Mo W248R.

Discussion
Even though Tax 1 and Tax 2 share approximately 70%
homology, previous studies comparing the activities of
Tax 1 and Tax 2 proteins have shown that functional differences exist between the two proteins and suggest that
this could account at least in part for differences in the
pathogenic properties of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 [23]. Specifically Tax 2A was reported to be unable to induce micronuclei formation or to activate the ICAM-1 promoter in T
cells compared to Tax 1 [24,25]. Furthermore while all Tax
proteins inhibit p53 activity, Tax 2A was found to do so
less efficiently than either Tax I or Tax 2B [26]. In transformation studies, Tax 2A was found to transform primary
human T cells with the same efficiency as Tax 1 and while
Tax 2A and Tax 2B could transform Rat-1 cells they did so
less efficiently than Tax 1 [27]. Other studies showed that
in contrast to Tax 2, Tax 1 suppressed hematopoiesis in
transduced CD34+ progenitor cells and suggested that this
may be attributed to its ability to upregulate the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21cip/waf1 promoter more efficiently than Tax 2 [28,29]. In addition Jurkat cells that
constitutively express Tax 1 were shown to inhibit the
kinetics of cellular replication to a higher degree compared to Tax 2 [30]. In the present study we investigated
the ability of two Tax 2A proteins Lor and Gar to transactivate the LTR and NFkB promoters in relation to expression levels, sequence variation and sub cellular location
compared to Tax 2A Mo and Tax 2B. Lor and Gar failed to
activate either promoter compared to Mo or 2B
eventhough the expression levels of all Tax 2 proteins
were similar. Compared to Mo, we identified six amino
acid changes in Lor spanning the entire protein and one

After 24 hrs the cells were lysed and reporter activities were

mutation in Gar located in the centre of the protein. Lor
was derived from a HTLV-2A infected BJAB cell line which
was positive for p24 production by FACS analysis (data
not shown) indicating that the mutations present were
not affecting the function of Rex. It was not possible to
determine if the amino acid changes in Lor arose during
culture or if they were present in the original virus. A previous study found that compared to Mo the prevalence of
amino acid changes in some functional Tax 2A proteins
was low (1–2%) [31] which is similar to that found in the
non-functional Lor protein. The Tax cDNAs in that study
were derived from non-cultured PBMCs obtained from
infected individuals thus eliminating the possibility that
the mutations arose as a result of cell culture. Examination
of those Tax 2A sequences revealed that they included
only one of the mutations described in the present study,
at position T204A which appears to be present in most
Tax 2A sequences.
In the present study most of the individual mutations
appeared only to affect the ability of Mo to activate the
LTR and had little affect on NFkB activation. The amino
terminal mutations are located in previously described
functional domains in Tax 1 and Tax 2 proteins including
a nuclear localization signal, zinc finger domain and more
recently a domain in Tax 2 between amino acids 90–100
shown to be involved in the cytoplasmic location of Tax 2
proteins [13,14,16,22]. However analysis of the subcellular location of mutant proteins using immunofluorescence did not reveal any discernable alterations in their
distribution compared to wildtype Mo. We found that all
Tax 2 proteins were predominantly located in the cytoplasm and also to a lesser extent in the nucleus. These
results agree with a recent study where they also found
that in contrast to Tax 1, Tax 2 proteins are predominantly
found in the cytoplasm [22]. Two mutations in the central

Jurkat cells were co-transfected with the indicated Tax plasmids
together with 1 ug of the LTR or NFkB luciferase reporters and 50 ng

region of Tax 2A at positions 144 and 248 appeared to
abolish both LTR and NFkB activation indicating that
these mutations may disrupt an essential functional or
structural domain involved in the activation of both pathways by Mo. The mutation at position W248R resulted in
defective LTR and NFkB activation both in the presence of
other mutations in Lor and when it is introduced singly
into Mo. The replacement of this mutation with the corresponding wildtype residue in the Lor mutant L6 restored
a wildtype NFkB phenotype but resulted in defective LTR
activation. The overall phenotype of L6 was probably due
to the combined effects of the other Lor mutations present
in the L6 protein which individually were found to substantially reduce LTR activation by Mo without affecting
activation of the NFkB pathway. A mutation in close proximity to 248, at position 258, was described in previous
studies to abolish Tax 2A activity while Tax 1 containing
this mutation failed to transactivate NFkB but retained the
capacity to transactivate the HTLV-1 LTR [13,19]. In the
present study insertion of the mutation at position 248
into both Tax 1 and 2B also abolished their activity indicating that this mutation may disrupt a shared functional
or structural domain required for activation of both pathways by all three Tax proteins. As opposed to its effects on
Mo, the mutation at position Y144C only reduced the
ability of Tax 2B and Tax 1 to activate the LTR and NFkB
promoters indicating that this domain is not as critical in
Tax 1 and 2B for activity as it is in Mo. However the insertion of the amino acid arginine instead of the hydrophobic amino acid cysteine at this position abolished Tax 2B
activity. It is not clear why the expression of some Tax

Jurkat cells were co-transfected with either wildtype Tax 2B or Tax 2B
mutants together with 1 ug of the LTR or NFkB luciferase reporters
and 50 ng of the control Renilla plasmid pRL TK. After 24 hrs the cells
were lysed and reporter activities were measured using a Turner 20/
20 Luminometer and firefly reporter activities were normalised using
Renilla luciferase values. Normalised values for wildtype Mo and
mutant Tax proteins were calculated as a percentage of wildtype 2B
values which was set at 100%.

mutants, such as Mo W248R and Tax 2B W248R, was substantially reduced compared to the corresponding
wildtype proteins. This is in contrast to the expression levels of Lor and Lor mutant proteins L1–L4, which were not
affected by the presence of W248R. Wildtype Mo was
repeatedly found to activate both the LTR and NFkB promoters less efficiently than Tax 2B. However this difference was abolished by introducing one mutation at
position T204A into Mo which resulted in similar or
slightly higher levels of activity to those obtained with
wildtype Tax 2B indicating that depending on sequence of
both proteins, Mo and Tax 2B display equivalent levels of
activity. These results differ from a previous study carried
out in our laboratory which found that compared to Tax
1 and Tax 2B some Tax 2A proteins including Mo were
unable to activate the CREB pathway in Jurkat or 293T
cells [12]. We speculate that these differences may be
related to the poor expression of Tax 2A proteins reported
in that study and possibly to differences in experimental
conditions.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study shows that compared to
Mo, certain Tax 2A proteins are non-functional and that
loss of activity is clearly associated with the accumulation
of amino acid changes and not with levels of expression or
alterations in sub-cellular localisation. Failure of Tax 2A
mutants to activate either the CREB or NFkB pathways or
both, was previously reported to be related to an inability

suggests that the prevalence of mutations in Tax 2A proteins which inactivate both pathways may influence the
pathogenic properties of certain HTLV-2A viruses.

Location of mutations found in Tax 2A proteins
Location of mutations found in Tax 2A proteins. (A) Schematic representation of functional domains in Tax 2A Mo. These
regions include CREB binding domains at the amino and carboxy termini, domains important in CREB and NFkB activation
flanking a domain found to be important in NFkB activation [19], a domain involved in the cytoplasmic localisation of Tax 2
proteins [22], a nuclear localisation domain (NLS) [16] and a nuclear export signal (NES) [18]. Mutations which give rise to the
loss of activation of CREB alone, NFkB alone or CREB and NFkB pathways by Mo are indicated. (b) Relative position of amino
acid changes found in Lor and Gar.

a single antibody, Tax coding sequences were amplified by
PCR using reverse primers that contained an additional
sequence for six histidine (HIS) residues before the stop
codons. For cloning purposes all primers contained 5' and
3' EcoRI restriction enzyme sites. Tax 2A Lor was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA extracted from an HTLV2A infected BJAB cell line. Gar was amplified from
genomic DNA extracted from cultured PBMCs from a
HTLV-2/HIV-1 infected individual and Mo was amplified
from a plasmid construct supplied by P.L. Green. Tax 1
and Tax 2B coding sequences were amplified from the corresponding pFLAG constructs as described previously
[12]. Purified PCR products were cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pCAGGS using EcoRI. The
nucleotide sequence of all constructs was determined
using the BigDye Terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The HTLV-1 LTR luciferase plasmid were
described previously [12] and NFkB activation was determined using pNF-kB-Luc (Stratagene).

Jurkat cells were seeded in 60 mm dishes and co-transfected with either 1 ug of HTLV-1 LTR, or NFkB firefly luciferase reporters together with 250 ng of the indicated Tax
expression plasmids and 50 ng of Renilla luciferase
reporter pRL-TK. Reporter activities were measured using
the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) 24
hrs after transfection as described previously. Briefly, cells
were lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer and firefly and Renilla
luciferase activities were measured using a Turner 20/20
Luminometer. Reporter activities were normalized using
Renilla luciferase values. To determine and compare Tax
expression levels in cells transfected with wildtype or
mutant plasmids, 293T cells were seeded on 60 mm
dishes and co-transfected the next day with 250 ng of the
indicated plasmids. Cells were lysed after 24 hrs using 1×
passive lysis buffer. Lysates was analysed by western blotting and Tax proteins were detected using an anti-HIS
antibody (Invitrogen). Blots were also probed with antiTubulin (Calbiochem) as a loading control.

Indirect immunofluorescence
Cos 7 cells were seeded on two well chamber slides twenty
four hrs before transfection with 150 ng of the indicated
Tax expression plasmids. Twenty four hours after transfection cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and
permeabilized in 0.2% Tween 20/PBS. Non specific binding was blocked using 5% rabbit serum or swine serum for
1 h at room temperature and incubated with the anti-HIS
antibody (Invitrogen; 1:400) for 2 h at room temperature.
After washing in PBS, cells were incubated with rabbit
anti- mouse FITC for 1 h at room temperature. Following
a washing step the nuclei in cells were stained using DAPI
(Sigma 1 ug/ml) and slides were mounted in Vectashield.
