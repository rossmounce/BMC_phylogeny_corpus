Abstract
Background: An extremely low level methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) belonging
to ST45, circulates among intravenous drug users in the Zurich area. This clone can be
misinterpreted as an MSSA by phenotypic oxacillin resistance tests, although it carries a
staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element encoding a functional mecA gene and
it produces PBP2a.
Results: This clone carried a new 45.7-kb element, termed SCCmecN1, containing a class B mec
complex (mecA-ΔmecR1::IS1272), a truncated Tn4003 harbouring the dfrA gene, and a fusB1 gene,
conferring methicillin, trimethoprim and low level fusidic acid resistance, respectively. In addition
to the two insertion site sequences (ISS) framing the SCCmec, a third ISS (ISS*) was identified within
the element. SCCmecN1 also harboured two distinct ccrAB complexes belonging to the class 4
subtype, both of which were shown to be active and to be able to excise the SCCmecN1 or parts
thereof. Slight variations in the SmaI-PFGE pattern of the clinical MRSA isolates belonging to this
clone were traced back to differences in the sizes of the SCCmec J2 regions and/or to a 6.4-kb
deletion extending from ISS* to the right end ISS. This latter deletion led to a variant right SCCmecchromosomal junction site. MRSA clones carrying the shorter SCCmec with the 6.4-kb deletion
were usually ciprofloxacin resistant, while strains with the complete SCCmecN1 were cotrimoxazole resistant or had no additional resistances. This suggested that the genetic backbone of
the host S. aureus, although identical by PFGE pattern, had at some stage diverged with one branch
acquiring a sulfonomide resistance mutation and the other ciprofloxacin resistance.
Conclusion: This description of the structure and variations of SCCmecN1 will allow for quicker
and easier molecular detection of this clone and monitoring of its spread.

Background
Injection drug user (IDU) populations throughout certain
areas of Europe and North America have become major
risk groups associated with the epidemic spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [1-5]. The
transmission of MRSA clones through both communityand healthcare-associated routes is responsible for the

high incidence of soft tissue infections and increases in
severe infections such as endocarditis and bacteremia in
IDUs [6-8]. Such a clonal dispersal led to MRSA becoming
endemic in the Zurich IDU population, where in 2003
24% of all MRSA isolates collected at the University hospital of Zurich belonged to a single, so called "drug clone"
[9]. Dissemination of this clone to IDU populations in

other, geographically distinct regions of Switzerland has
also been recently reported, indicating that it has a capacity for spreading and colonizing new populations [10].
Clinical detection of MRSA can be complicated due to vast
strain-to-strain differences in the expression of methicillin
resistance. Difficulties arise from strains expressing lowlevel but heterogenous resistance, that upon exposure to
β-lactams segregate highly resistant subpopulations
resulting in therapy failure [11]. Misdiagnosis of such
strains with very low, phenotypically susceptible, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) is a major problem necessitating the use of molecular detection methods.
Epidemiological classification of MRSA strains is important for monitoring their prevalence and spread, and relies
on molecular typing of both their core genomic background and the type of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) they harbour. SCCmec is the
chromosomally integrated resistance element which carries the mecA gene, encoding the alternate penicillin-binding protein PBP2a, which confers methicillin resistance.
There are currently six main types of SCCmec, differentiated according to their combinations of mec complex,
containing the mecA gene and various portions of its regulatory genes mecR1 and mecI, and ccr complex containing
recombinases specific for the chromosomal integration
and excision of the SCCmec. Further sub-typing is based
on the presence of certain additional genes or resistance
determinants within the J (so called junkyard) regions J1,
J2 and J3 of the element [12]. A number of non mecAencoding SCC elements, sharing some common features
with various SCCmecs, have also been discovered in
methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) or coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains [13-18].
Identification of the Zurich drug clone was based on a
characteristic pulsed field gel SmaI restriction pattern and
the presence of a unique, previously uncharacterised SCCmec element which was termed SCCmecN1. In addition to
methicillin resistance, all drug clone isolates were shown
to be resistant to trimethoprim and most were resistant to
sulfamethoxazole or to ciprofloxacin. MLST typing
revealed that the representative isolate of this clone, MRSA
CHE482, belonged to sequence type ST45, a genotype that
has been associated with epidemic MSSA and low level
oxacillin resistant MRSA, which seem to have high colonization and circulation capacities [19].
All the drug clone isolates have low oxacillin resistance
levels, with MICs between 0.5 and 4 μg ml-1, which can
make them difficult to detect by phenotypic tests. Except
for the detection of the mecA gene, genotypic tests, which
rely on identifying known features of SCCmecs [20,21] or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/62

SCCmec-chromosomal junctions [22] (X. Schneider,
unpublished), have also failed to identify this clone [9].
To facilitate accurate molecular identification of this clone
this manuscript presents a detailed description of the
novel SCCmecN1 and describes the SCCmec variability
observed so far between different isolates.

Results and Discussion
Mapping of SCCmecN1
The size of SCCmecN1 in CHE482 was estimated to be
45.7-kb, based on a series of overlapping long range PCR
products amplified with primers shown in Figure 1 and
listed in Table 1. This is larger than the community-associated SCCmec type IV (21–25-kb), type V (27.6-kb) and
type VI (approximately 22-kb) elements, falling within
the range of the classical hospital associated SCCmec types
I-III which range in size from 34–67 kb [23]. Loci of interest within SCCmecN1 were then further mapped and
sequenced.
mec complex typing
SCCmec typing [20] results suggested that the mec complex did not contain mecI and PCR using primers spanning IS1272 and ΔmecR1 and sequencing over the gene
junction then confirmed the presence of a class B mec
complex (mecA-ΔmecR1-IS1272).
ccr typing
No ccr complex could be detected using the multiplex PCR
for ccr types 1 to 3 as described by Ito et al. [21], however
with ccr type 4-specific primers C1 and C2, a weak amplificate was produced [9]. Further sequence analysis revealed
that this SCCmec contained two complete ccrAB loci
which are both similar to ccrAB4 from strain HDE288, a
pediatric clone isolated in Portugal carrying a type VI SCCmec element [24,25]. Therefore specific primers to identify
the drug clone ccrAB4-1/-2 genes were designed (primers
27 and 28). One of the loci, ccrAB4-1, was located at the
usual ccrAB position downstream of the mec complex at
the border of the J1 region. The other recombinase complex, ccrAB4-2 was located within the J3 region (Figure 1).
Sequence alignments of ccrAB4-1CHE482, ccrAB4-2CHE482,
ccrAB4HDE288 and ccrAB4ATCC12228 genes showed that all
four loci were different, with ccrA4 genes sharing between
85.2% and 89.4% similarity with each other and ccrB4
sequences sharing between 94.3% and 92.9% similarity.
Nucleotide sequence similarities of these four ccrA4 genes
and ccrA genes from complex types 1–3, and of the four
ccrB4 genes with ccrB genes from complexes 1–3, are
shown by phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). For these alignments the sequence of ccrB4HDE288 was adjusted because
the database sequence is truncated as the result of an adenine deletion at nt position 1325; leaving it 99-aa shorter
than ccrB4-1CHE482 and 100-aa shorter than ccrB4-2CHE482.

By adding back this adenine we could compare the whole
length sequences.
The phylogenetic trees show that ccrAB4-1CHE482, ccrAB42CHE482, ccrAB4HDE288 and ccrAB4ATCC12228 (S. epidermidis)
form a distinct ccrAB4 cluster. The presence of two complete ccrAB4 loci in the CHE482 SCCmec indicated that
SCCmecN1 had been composed from at least two different
complete or partial SCC elements. Other such mosaic or
composite SCC elements have been described previously
[13,26,27], however this is the first SCCmec found to contain two copies of the same ccr complex.
Due to the presence of both a class B mec complex and
ccrAB4, the CHE482 SCCmec would be most closely
related to SCCmec type VI. However, due to a number of
unique features, including the presence of a second ccr
locus and additional antibiotic resistance determinants, it
appears to be a distinct subtype of this group that we are
provisionally calling SCCmecN1.

Additional resistance determinants
In addition to mecA, the resistance genes dfrA and fusB1,
encoding trimethoprim and fusidic acid resistance,
respectively, were also found on SCCmecN1. The dfrA gene
shared 100% nucleotide identity with dfrA from pSK1
(X13290.1), which confers high level trimethoprim resistance [28]. dfrA is carried on Tn4003, a generally plasmidencoded composite transposon with the genetic organisation IS431-rep-IS431-orf140-dfrA-thyE-IS431 [28]. We
speculate that Tn4003 had jumped into the SCCmec-associated IS431, hypothesised to be a hotspot for the integration of resistance determinants [29,30] (Figure 1).
However, it had lost the rep gene (replication protein) and
one of its flanking IS431 elements, leaving Tn4003 truncated (IS431-orf140-dfrA-thyE-IS431).

The fusB1 gene, found within the J1 region of SCCmecN1,
was identical to the hypothetical fusidic acid resistance
gene SAS0043 from the methicillin-susceptible strain
MSSA476 [14], located on the 22.8-kb SCC-like element

SCC476, in MSSA476. The SCC476 ccrAB genes, however,
are most similar to the type 1 ccr complex from S. hominis.
The fusB1 gene in CHE482 conferred only low level
fusidic acid resistance of 6 μg ml-1.
SCCmec boundaries
The boundaries of the SCCmec element were sequenced
using the primers 2, 3, 13 and 14 and compared to reference sequences of SCC476 from MSSA476 and SCCmec
type II from N315 (Figure 3). SCCmecN1 had integrated at
the same position within the attBSCC sequence at the 3'
end of orfX as all previously described SCCmec and SCC
elements. The ends of SCCmecN1 contained the characteristic direct and degenerate-inverted repeats found at the
ends of SCCmec types I-IV and SCC476. Integration site
sequences (ISS) with the consensus sequence 5'-(GANGCNTATCATAANTN)-3 [23] were present at both boundaries. A third ISS sequence (ISS*) was also identified about
6.4-kb upstream from the right end junction.
Drug clone variability
Analysis of PFGE profiles of all drug clone isolates characterised by Qi et al. in 2003 [9] revealed that there were

small variations in size in the 208-kb SmaI band containing mecA. Therefore the SCCmec of CHE482 and a selection of three other drug clone strains (ZH4, ZH43 and
ZH81, Table 2) were cured using plasmid pSR3-1. The
SmaI band carrying SCCmec was slightly larger in CHE482
and ZH81 than in ZH4 and ZH43 before curing, whereas
after curing the resulting patterns were identical in all four
strains (Figure 4A). This indicated that there was variability, presumably within the SCCmec.
SCCmecN1 variation
Using the long range overlapping PCR products, variations in the SCCmec elements of strains CHE482, ZH4,
ZH43 and ZH81, were compared. Fragment sizes between
primers 6 and 4 varied by 100 to 200 bp, and between
primers 7 and 9 from 1000 to 1500 bp. The variation in
the hypervariable region between the mec complex and
ΔTn4003 (primers 6 and 4) could be due to different
numbers of direct repeats units (dru) [31] as found in
SCCmec VT compared to the WIS SCCmec V [32]. Amplification between fusB1 and the right SCCmec junction produced a 6.4-kb larger end fragment from CHE482/ZH81
than from ZH4/ZH43.

Phylogenetic relatedness of selected ccrA and ccrB nucleotide sequences
Phylogenetic relatedness of selected ccrA and ccrB nucleotide sequences. The following genes were used: ccrA1 and ccrB1* from
strain NCTC10442 [DDBJ:AB033763]; ccrA2 and ccrB2 from MRSA252 [EMBL:BX571856], MW2 [NCBI:NC_003923], SCCmec IIE [EMBL:AJ810120]; ccrA3 and ccrB3 of 85–3907 [DDBJ:AB047088]; ccrA4 and ccrB4* from HDE288 [GenBank:AF411935]; ccrA4 and ccrB4 of ATCC12228 [GeneBank:AE015929]; ccrC in WIS [DDBJ:AB121219]. The ccrB genes from
NCTC10442 (ccrB1*) and HDE288 (ccrB4*) are truncated; for comparison we have reconstituted them by adding an adenine at
the site of the frameshifts. The evolutionary relationships are shown by the length of the branches and the scale of the tree
indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per 100 bases. Alignment was done using ClustalW and tree constructed with
Multalign, Lasergene 6.0. Type 4 ccrA genes are framed in red and and type 4 ccrB genes in green.

Sequencing in from the right junctions showed that the
ends of CHE482/ZH81 were identical to each other with
no significant similarity to any database sequences (data
not shown) but they were different to those of ZH4/ZH43
(Figure 3). The latter sequences of ZH4/ZH43 were identical to the end of SCC476. In contrast, the left end chromosome-SCCmec junction sequences were identical in all
drug clones analysed.

however, was highly resistant and resistance was not lost
upon curing (Table 3), therefore resistance in this strain
was probably additionally caused by a mutation in the
chromosomal elongation factor G, EF-G (fusA) [33]. Since
both ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole resistance are
chromosomal, the SCCmec variants found in the Zurich
drug clones are very likely associated with different,
closely related genetic backgrounds.

Antibiotic resistance variability
SCCmec variability also appeared to correlate with other
strain differences. Strains ZH4 and ZH43 which had identical SCCmecs, were also both ciprofloxacin resistant;
meanwhile CHE482 and ZH81, which share identical
SCCmecs, were ciprofloxacin susceptible (Table 2). There
was also variation in fusidic acid resistance levels. Most
strains had relatively low fusidic acid resistance. ZH43,

ccr activity
CHE482 was cured using either pME21 (ccrAB4-1) or
pME22 (ccrAB4-2). Resulting isolates were screened for
methicillin, trimethoprim and fusidic acid susceptibility
and for amplification of a PCR product spanning the
former SCCmec-chromosomal junctions (primers 1 and
14, Figure 1). Both ccrAB4-1 and ccrAB4-2 were functional
and able to excise SCCmec even though their ccrA and ccrB

Chromosome-SCCmec junction sequences
Chromosome-SCCmec junction sequences. The borders of strain CHE482 were aligned with the sequences of the three drug
clones, ZH4, ZH43, ZH81, the cured drug clone, strain N315 (type II SCCmec), MSSA476 (SCC476)and ISS*. Light green boxes
indicate the orfX region and its integration sequence site, ISS. Yellow shading highlights differences between the SCCmec ends.
Direct and indirect repeats are indicated with arrows. The red letters represent the similarity of the inverted repeats. attBSCC** and ISS** consensus sequences were taken from Ito et al. [23].

amino acid sequences differed by 11.3% and 4.6%,
respectively. This is consistent with the finding that several different ccrAB loci from type IV SCCmecs were all
shown to be active, despite varying up to 3.7% in their
amino acid sequences [34].
Excision variants
CHE482 was cured using pSR3-1 [35], the resulting strain
ME21 was sensitive to oxacillin, fusidic acid and trimethoprim (Figure 1, Table 3). During curing experiments with
pME21 and pME22 we discovered that there were also
many strains that had not been completely cured. One set
of cured CHE482 variants maintained a fragment of 6.4kb, and sequencing confirmed that this fragment was the
portion between the ISS at the right junction and ISS*.
This indicated that excision of the main SCCmec fragment
containing all three resistance determinants had occurred
through recombination between the ISS at the left junction and ISS*.

ccrAB4-1 and its predicted promoter were also cloned into
the E. coli-S. aureus shuttle vector pAW17 to produce the
recombinant plasmid pME15. Attempts to cure CHE482
of its SCCmec element using pME15 resulted in another
partially cured set of variants which had maintained
fusidic acid resistance but lost oxacillin and trimethoprim
resistance (CHE482Δ, Figure 1B). Analysis of these strains
by PFGE, showed that the SCCmec-containing band had
become smaller but not to the same extent as the completely cured strain ME21 (Figure 4B). These results indicated that only a portion of the SCCmec, containing mecA
and dfrA, had been lost. PCR mapping identified the loca-

tion of the missing portion and sequencing over the excision sites revealed that excision was likely to be mediated
by homologous recombination across regions of high
nucleotide sequence similarity surrounding the two ccr
loci, as no additional ISS sequences were found. It
appeared that recombination between the two ccr regions
resulted in the deletion of a 22-kb fragment containing
ccrAB4-1, the class B mec complex and ΔTn4003. This
recombination left an SCC-like element of 23.7-kb, which
contained one ccrAB complex (ccrAB4-2) and the fusidic
acid resistance determinant (Figure 1B). This truncated
SCC is similar in size to the MSSA476 SCC476 which also
contains fusB1 and a ccrAB locus, although in SCC476 the
ccr genes are most similar to ccrAB type 1.
Therefore we have identified three possible excision variants, two resulting from the presence of three ISS, as has
been seen in SCCmec type IV strains [26], and the third
variant caused by recombination between regions of high
sequence similarity.

Conclusion
The general structure of SCCmecN1 (ccrAB4-2, dfrA, class B
mec complex, ccrAB4-1, fusB1) was distinctly different
from already published SCCmec types. Several regions of
variability were found between different clinical drug
clone isolates, especially in the right-end region where the
presence or absence of a DNA fragment framed by ISS
sequences was detected. Nevertheless this clone can now
be identified by its resistance profile and its combination
of class B mec complex and ccrAB4 complex sequences,
thus allowing easier epidemiological identification.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Bacterial strains and plasmids are listed in Table 2. The
four clinical MRSA isolates CHE482, ZH4, ZH43 and
ZH81 were clones associated with intravenous drug users
in the Zurich area. Apart from the type strain CHE482,
strains were selected from the epidemiological study in
2003 based on their PFGE patterns and resistance profiles
(Table 2) [9]. Growth was at 37°C in Luria Bertani broth
(Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA). Strains harbouring the temperature-sensitive plasmids pME21 or pME22
were propagated at 30°C in the presence of 10 μg ml-1 tetracycline and those with plasmid pME15 were grown at
37°C in the presence of 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin.
Susceptibility testing
The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics were determined by Etest on Mueller-Hinton agar
plates (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) according to
the manufacturer's instructions (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). Disc diffusion of oxacillin, cefoxitin, fusidic acid
and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were done according to CLSI [36] on Mueller Hinton agar plates. Penicillinase production of cefoxitin-induced cells was assayed by
nitrocefin hydrolysis and PBP2a production by the MRSA
screen agglutination test from Denka Seiken (Tokyo,
Japan) [37].
SCCmec typing
SCCmec types I through IV, ccr types 1 to 3, and ccr type 4
from the pediatric clone HDE288, were identified by PCR

as described by [20,21], and [38], respectively. A specific
PCR was established to identify the drug clone ccrAB4-1/2CHE482 using primer pair 27 and 28 (Table 1).
Localization of dfrA and mecA
SmaI digested chromosomal DNA was separated by
pulsed field gel electrophoresis, PFGE [39] and hybridised
sequentially [40] with a mecA (primer pair 18 and 19) and
a dfrA probe (primer pair 20 and 21) (Table 1).
Cloning of the ccrAB genes of CHE482
Each of the two ccrAB complexes identified in strain
CHE482, including their own promoter, were cloned into
the BamHI site of the temperature-sensitive plasmid
pYT3, using primers 22 and 24 for ccrAB4-1CHE482 and
primers 25 and 26 for ccrAB4-2CHE482. The resulting plasmids pME21 and pME22, respectively, were electroporated into RN4220 and then transduced by Φ80α into the
MRSA clinical isolates to be cured of SCCmec. The ccrAB41CHE482 was also cloned into the E. coli-S. aureus shuttle
vector pAW17, using the primers 22 and 23 (Table 1). The
resulting plasmid pME15 was then electroporated into
RN4220 and transduced into the MRSA to be cured of
SCCmec.
Curing of SCCmec
Curing of SCCmec was done by the method of Katayama
[35] using either the temperature-sensitive plasmid pSR31 containing ccrAB type 2 recombinase genes, or plasmids
pME21 (ccrAB4-1) or pME22 (ccrAB4-2). Curing with
plasmid pME15 (ccrAB4-1) was done by transducing the

pooled and plated on LB agar containing kanamycin,
grown overnight, and screened by replica plating for loss
of oxacillin resistance on 1 μg ml-1 oxacillin.

Sequence analysis
Sequencing was performed with an ABI PRISM BigDye
Terminator Cycle sequencing reaction kit (US Biochemicals, Cleveland, Ohio) and an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California).

Sequence assembly was accomplished using the DNAStar
sequence analysis package (Lasergene 6.0).
Sequencing of the SCCmec-chromosome junctions of four
drug clones was done by direct chromosomal sequencing
[41] of the original and cured clones using primer 2. This
nucleotide sequence provided the template for the design
of primers 14, 13 and 3 (Table 1) over the chromosomeSCCmec junctions.
Mapping of SCCmec
To estimate the size of the CHE482 SCCmec, long range
PCR amplification of six main fragments was performed
using the polymerase TaKaRa Ex Taq (TAKARA BIO INC.,
Shiga, Japan). PCR was done as described by the manufacturer's recommendation. Primer pairs utilised were: 1 and
5; 4 and 6; 4 and 8; 7 and 9; 10 and 11 and 12 and 14
(Table 1). Amplified PCR fragments were run against
molecular weight markers (Marker II, Fermentas International, Ontario, CA; 1 kb+, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) on a
0.5% agarose gel.
Nucleotide sequence accession number
The sequences of ccrAB4-1CHE482 and ccrAB4-2CHE482 have
been deposited in the GenBank (NCBI) database under
accession number [GenBank: EF126185] and [GenBank:EF126186] respectively.
