Evidence for maintenance of sex determinants
but not of sexual stages in red yeasts, a group of
early diverged basidiomycetes
Marco A Coelho, Paula Gonçalves and José P Sampaio*

Abstract
Background: The red yeasts are an early diverged group of basidiomycetes comprising sexual and asexual species.
Sexuality is based on two compatible mating types and sexual identity is determined by MAT loci that encode
homeodomain transcription factors, peptide pheromones and their receptors. The objective of the present study
was to investigate the presence and integrity of MAT genes throughout the phylogenetic diversity of red yeasts
belonging to the order Sporidiobolales.
Results: We surveyed 18 sexual heterothallic and self-fertile species and 16 asexual species. Functional pheromone
receptor homologues (STE3.A1 and STE3.A2) were found in multiple isolates of most of the sexual and asexual
species. For each of the two mating types, sequence comparisons with whole-genome data indicated that synteny
tended to be conserved along the pheromone receptor region. For the homeodomain transcription factor,
likelihood methods suggested that diversifying selection acting on the self/non-self recognition region promotes
diversity in sexual species, while rapid evolution seems to be due to relaxed selection in asexual strains.
Conclusions: The majority of both sexual and asexual species of red yeasts have functional pheromone receptors
and homeodomain homologues. This and the frequent existence of asexual strains within sexual species, makes
the separation between sexual and asexual species imprecise. Events of loss of sexuality seem to be recent and
frequent, but not uniformly distributed within the Sporidiobolales. Loss of sex could promote speciation by
fostering the emergence of asexual lineages from an ancestral sexual stock, but does not seem to contribute to
the generation of exclusively asexual lineages that persist for a long time.

Background
In eukaryotes sexual reproduction is an almost universal
trend [1,2], a fact that underlines its importance both
for individual fitness and long-term survival of species
[3]. Fungi in particular have evolved a rich repertoire of
mating strategies and sex-determining systems that has
no parallel in other eukaryotic lineages [4-6]. Sexual
identity in fungi is always established in the haploid
stage [7] and determined by specialized genomic regions
called mating type (MAT) loci [8]. In general, fungal
MAT loci encode transcription factors that regulate the
expression of determinants of sexual identity/compatibility, such as peptide pheromones and pheromone

receptors belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor
family [9].
In Ascomycota, and possibly also in Mucoromycotina
and Chytridiomycota, the MAT loci occur in two alternate forms that determine two mating types or sexual
compatibility groups [6,10-12]. This constitutes the socalled bipolar mating system. However, in Basidiomycota,
two functional classes of genes can be found within MAT
loci: in addition to transcriptional regulators (homeodomain transcription factors - HD1/HD2), the genes encoding pheromones and pheromone receptors (P/PR) are
also located in the genomic regions that determine sexual
identity. This formed the basis for the existence of a
more complex mating system in some basidiomycetes. In
this system two classes of MAT genes (HD1/HD2 and
P/PR) are located in two genetically unlinked MAT loci
(henceforth designated as HD and PR loci, respectively)

[9,13]. This system is called tetrapolar, because four different mating types are generated after meiosis. Irrespective of whether the mating system is bipolar or
tetrapolar, mating identity and compatibility are generally
determined in basidiomycetes at two levels. First, mating
and cell fusion occurs when individuals carry different
alleles of genes encoding small lipopeptide pheromones
and PR [14,15]. Following fusion of compatible partners,
progression through the sexual cycle depends on a second compatibility checkpoint that relies on the formation
of a heterodimeric homeodomain transcription factor
(HD1/HD2) encoded also at the MAT locus [16,17]. The
homeodomain transcription factor is only active after cell
fusion because dimerization is restricted to HD1 and
HD2 subunits that originate from genetically different
individuals [18,19]. One additional relevant aspect of the
tetrapolar system is that MAT loci are often highly polymorphic bringing forth species with many allelic forms
that can produce up to thousands of mating types
[16,20-23]. Remarkably, in basidiomycetes with many
mating types (viz. mushrooms), the control of cell-cell
attraction and fusion by P/PR signalling has been abandoned [21] but it is still essential for the development
and maintenance of the dikaryotic state. In addition, a
third MAT system, designated pseudo-bipolar, was
recently found in members of the red yeast genera Rhodosporidium and Sporidiobolus, that belong to an early
diverged lineage of basidiomycetes [24,25]. In both bipolar and pseudo-bipolar systems only two mating types are
found but in the latter some characteristics of tetrapolar
systems are also present, like the occasional occurrence
of recombination within the bipolar MAT locus [24].
Among the diversity of mating systems found in fungi,
various types of self-fertility (or homothallism) have also
evolved [26]. In those cases, heterothallism (mating
occurs only between compatible individuals carrying different MAT alleles [16]), is replaced by the ability of a
single clone to form sexual structures and reproduce
sexually.
In addition to the various modes of sexual reproduction, asexual reproduction is also a conspicuous process
of fungal propagation. This suggests that for fungi the
advantages of sex, namely the promotion of adaptive evolution and the more efficient elimination of deleterious
mutations [27], may in many instances be insufficient to
counterbalance its disadvantages, normally associated
with energy and time costs of sexuality [28]. The reasons
why sexuality can be facultative in fungi seem to be
related to the availability of mitotically formed spores
and other modes of asexual propagation [29]. However,
although the ability to reproduce mitotically in fast and
efficient ways acts potentially as a strong evolutionary
promoter of asexuality [30], available evidence indicates
that asexuality is a derived character. Firstly, asexual

Page 2 of 14

species are clearly a minority (approximately 17% of all
known fungal species are asexual). Secondly, asexual species very often have phylogenetically close relatives capable of sexual reproduction [31,32].
In this study we focused our attention on a basal lineage
of basidiomycetes that is notorious for the co-existence of
sexual and asexual species, the red yeasts of the order
Sporidiobolales. This order is classified in the subphylum
Pucciniomycotina, the earliest diverged lineage of basidiomycetes [33], whose most notable members are the rust
fungi. A classical and presently much debated rule in fungal nomenclature imposes that asexual and sexual fungi
are classified separately, in different species and genera
[34]. For example, in the order Sporidiobolales sexual
species are classified in the genera Rhodosporidium
and Sporidiobolus whereas asexual forms are classified in
Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces [35]. Therefore, the coexistence in the same phylogenetic group of very closely
related species of sexual and asexual taxa with similar ecological and physiological properties raises several questions:
(i) are asexual species truly asexual having thus no traces of
MAT genes in their genomes? (ii) alternatively, have asexual species formed recently and therefore still exhibit
(traces of) sex related genes? (iii) is mating type imbalance
possibly giving rise to asexual lineages? (iv) is asexuality
contributing to speciation by giving rise to new species that
derive from extant sexual stocks? These questions were
addressed in this study by surveying the presence and
integrity of MAT genes in an expanded set of red yeast
species. In order to get some additional insight in the evolution of MAT loci in the Sporidiobolales, we also compared gene content and organization around MAT genes
between opposite mating types and across different species.

Results and Discussion
Updated phylogeny of the Sporidiobolales

We investigated a group of 43 red yeast species representing the phylogenetic diversity in the order Sporidiobolales.
These species are classified in four genera, two sexual Rhodosporidium and Sporidiobolus - and two asexual Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces. An updated molecular
phylogeny of the Sporidiobolales based on the concatenated alignment of the complete ITS region (ITS1, 5.8S
and ITS2) and the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA is
shown in Figure 1. Three statistically well-supported
clades were observed. Although such organization was
somewhat anticipated in previous studies (e.g. [35,36]), the
incorporation of more taxa, including species not yet formally described, and the combination of ITS and D1/D2
data, improved the resolution of the present analysis.
Whereas clade A included only species of Rhodosporidium
and Rhodotorula, which are characterized by the absence
of forcibly discharged spores (ballistoconidia), clade C contained only species of Sporidiobolus and Sporobolomyces

Figure 1 Phylogeny of the Sporidiobolales. Molecular phylogeny based on a concatenated alignment of the ITS region (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2)
and the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA. Mating types (MAT A1 and MAT A2), asexual and self-fertile strains are designated as A1, A2, As and Sf,
respectively. Circles before each strain depict the type of PR gene: yellow, STE3.A1; blue, STE3.A2; white, not detected; half-coloured circles,
simultaneous detection of STE3.A1 and STE3.A2. For each species, the type strain is highlighted in boldface. A, B and C are three statistically wellsupported clades (see text for details). Abbreviations of generic names: Rhodosporidium (R.), Rhodotorula (Rh.), Sporidiobolus (S.) and
Sporobolomyces (Sp.). Asterisks indicate instances where the original mating type designation was altered to match the molecular identity of the
strains (see Additional File 1). Species not yet formally described are indicated by inverted commas. The tree was rooted with sequences of
Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae and Leucosporidium scottii (see methods). Branch lengths are given in number of substitutions per site. Bootstrap
values (>50%) from 1000 replicates are shown.

that are able to form ballistoconidia. At variance with
clades A and C, clade B included representatives of the
four genera, which indicates that the traditional classification separating genera based on the ability to form ballistoconidia is not supported at the molecular level. It is also
evident from Figure 1 that in all three clades, sexual and
asexual species are completely intermingled.
Pheromone receptor genes as molecular markers of
mating type identity

Multiple HD1/HD2 alleles were found in red yeast species, and phylogenetic analyses suggested that allele
diversification occurred only after each species was
formed [24]. In addition, HD1/HD2 genes of different red
yeast species were found to be highly divergent precluding their utilization for mating type screening purposes
over a wide phylogenetic range. On the contrary, phylogenetic analyses of the PR alleles (STE3.A1 and STE3.A2)
of both M. violaceum and S. salmonicolor, revealed
ancient trans-specific polymorphisms [24,37] as expected
for genes maintained under long-term balancing selection [38]. Since only two PR alleles were present in each
species examined so far, and the presence of each allele
correlated in all cases with mating behaviour [24,39], PR
genes can be advantageously used as markers for mating
type at the molecular level across a broad range of red
yeast species.
All heterothallic red yeast species within the order Sporidiobolales were originally described as having a bipolar
mating behaviour. Such studies involved only standard
crossing tests and strains were therefore arbitrarily
assigned to either MAT A1 or MAT A2 within each species. PR genes were first identified in R. toruloides and
were named STE3.A1 and STE3.A2 in accordance with the
mating type of the strains in which they were initially
characterized [39]. After the identification of the
sequences of the PR genes in S. salmonicolor and S. johnsonii, it became clear that as a result of the original arbitrary assignment of mating types, each STE3 allele was
associated with strains of the opposite mating type, (e.g.
STE3.A1 was found in S. salmonicolor and S. johnsonii
MAT A2 strains, [24]). To avoid future confusion, we previously renamed the mating type designations of these two
species to match the molecular data [24]. Here we investigated at the molecular level the current mating type designations of the heterothallic species included in this work.
To that end we employed a PCR-based approach with
degenerate primers that specifically amplified STE3.A1 or
STE3.A2 alleles. In approximately half of the heterothallic
species analysed (R. sphaerocarpum, R. azoricum, S. ruineniae, S. pararoseus and S. longiusculus) the incongruences
previously observed for S. salmonicolor were also detected,
and in these cases the mating type designations were

Page 4 of 14

altered so as to match the molecular identity of the strains
(Additional File 1). It should be noted that in R. sphaerocarpum and S. ruineniae only the STE3.A1 allele could be
identified (Figure 2 and Additional File 1). Nevertheless,
the fact that the STE3.A1 allele was only found in strains
that mated as MAT A2 suggested that the STE3.A2 allele
is most probably present in MAT A1 strains, but the set of
primers that we used failed to amplify it. For R. babjevae
we investigated 25 strains (Additional File 1). Previously,
mating studies had identified five strains as MAT A1, four
strains as MAT A2 and two strains as self-fertile. The
remaining 14 strains were found to be sexually impaired
and thus considered asexual. The molecular characterization of PR alleles confirmed for the sexual strains the
results obtained with standard crossing tests. It also
showed that one of the self-fertile strains (VKM Y-2911)
contained both receptor alleles and that 11 asexual strains
belonged to MAT A1 and three to MAT A2. Both mating
types were present in strains isolated in Russia (six strains),
Argentina (five strains) and Japan (two strains). However,
the six strains isolated in Portugal belonged solely to MAT
A1. Using tester strains with good mating abilities and five
asexual strains for which the molecular determination of
mating type had been obtained, we repeated crosses and
confirmed that these strains do not mate in culture.
Pheromone receptor genes in asexual species

We subsequently investigated the presence of PR homologues (STE3.A1 and STE3.A2) in 16 asexual species classified
in the genera Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces (Figure 1
and Additional File 1). Amplification of STE3.A1 and/or
STE3.A2 alleles was successful in 11 species among the 16
examined (Figure 1). When multiple strains were available
for a species, both PR alleles were normally detected, signalling the presence of the two mating types in natural populations of these presumably asexual species. However, an
interesting exception was found for the sibling species
Rh. glutinis and Rh. graminis. Whereas all six strains of
Rh. glutinis possessed the STE3.A1 allele, all four strains of
Rh. graminis exhibited the STE3.A2 allele (Figure 2 and
Additional File 1). These two species are also closely related
to the heterothallic species R. babjevae. In contrast to
R. babjevae, only a limited number of strains of Rh. graminis and Rh. glutinis have been isolated worldwide [40], all of
which were included in the present study. For these three
species, inter-species mating has been tested, but was not
observed [41]. It is tempting to speculate that asexuality in
Rh. graminis and Rh. glutinis might be related to a strong
but relatively recent mating type imbalance. Nevertheless, a
larger sampling of both species would be required to accurately determine the mating type distribution and frequency
and to elucidate if sex occurs in nature by looking for footprints of recombination, as done previously for other

asexual fungi [42]. Moreover, it is important to note that
mating type imbalance does not lead necessarily to asexuality as demonstrated in C. neoformans [43,44].
Next, we investigated the integrity of PR genes in asexual species. To this end, the complete genes were
sequenced. We found that none of them showed hallmarks of degradation and that a protein sequence could
be readily obtained by conceptual translation in all cases,
suggesting that these genes encode functional proteins.
We also inspected the PR genes in the recently released
genomes of the presumptively asexual species Sporobolomyces sp. IAM 13481 (STE3.A1) and Rh. graminis WP1
(STE3.A2) (formerly designated as R. babjevae), available
at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI). Again, intact and
complete sequences of the PR genes were identified.
Therefore, our results suggest that asexuality in red
yeasts is not ancient, which is consistent with other studies that have shown that in presumed asexual ascomycetes, mating type genes are present and apparently

functional [45,46]. It is also possible that some supposedly asexual species have retained a cryptic sexual stage
that is difficult to induce in the laboratory.
In contrast to these observations, for five asexual species (Rh. mucilaginosa, Rh. pacifica, “Rh. pinicorticis”,
“Rh. pyritica” and Sp. odoratus) no PR alleles were found
(Figure 1 and Additional File 1). With the exception of
“Rh. pinicorticis” and Sp. odoratus, the remaining species
are closely related to each other and belong to a lineage
of clade A that includes also R. sphaerocarpum and Rh.
dairenensis. The phylogenetic analysis of STE3.A1 from
R. sphaerocarpum and STE3.A2 from Rh. dairenensis,
suggested that the amino acid sequences of these PR
genes are unusually divergent (Figures 1 and 2). Therefore, it is conceivable that the lack of amplification in the
remaining species is due to more divergent but still functional sequences. A similar explanation might apply for
the amplification of R. sphaerocarpum STE3.A1 in only
one out of six MAT A1 strains investigated.

For Rh. araucariae PYCC 4820 two PR alleles (STE3.A1
and STE3.A2) were detected (Figures 1 and 2, Additional
File 1). However, the nucleotide sequence of the STE3.A2
allele in this strain differed from homologous sequences of
conspecific strains of the same mating type (CBS 6031 and
CBS 7797; 87% identity). Surprisingly, the STE3.A2 allele
of Rh. araucariae PYCC 4820 was found to be 100% identical to the STE3.A2 gene of “Rh. hamamotoiana” PYCC
4724. Contrary to the other strains of Rh. araucariae, cells
of strain PYCC 4820 formed a slender projection that
resembled a conjugation tube, although actual conjugation
between cells of the same strain or with cells of the other
strains of Rh. araucariae was not observed. It seems plausible that the phenotype of PYCC 4820 is due to the presence of MAT alleles of both mating types (including the
P/PR), as a result of a past hybridization event between
the two species. However, incompatibilities at other loci,
like for example the HD locus, are perhaps impairing progression through the sexual cycle, as no dikaryotic mycelium or teliospores were observed.
Pheromone receptor genes in self-fertile species

In homothallic species, a single strain can complete the life
cycle without the need for a complementary mating partner. Although several mechanisms of homothallism have
been put forward in fungi [26], the most common explanation for this sexual behaviour is that these species have
both MAT alleles in a single genome and can therefore
form sexual structures alone. In this study we searched for
the presence of both PR alleles in three species from clade
B that contain only self-fertile strains - R. fluviale, R. lusitaniae and S. microsporus - but only STE3.A2 alleles were
found. Although we could not rule out that the absence of
amplification of STE3.A1 alleles was due to mutations in
primer target sequences, we deem this explanation less
likely in this case, since STE3.A1 alleles were identified and
sequenced in closely related species of clade B, like R. azoricum and Rh. colostri. We hypothesize that for these three
species self-fertility could be due to compatibility at the
HD locus despite homozygosity at the PR locus. If confirmed, such a situation would parallel that found in the
corn smut pathogen Ustilago maydis, in which diploid
strains that are homozygous at the PR locus but heterozygous at the HD locus are able to produce teliospores that
germinate and undergo meiosis in a way that is indistinguishable from that of the heterozygous diploids at both
MAT loci [47]. A similar self-fertile phenotype is originated
in C. neoformans when either the a sex inducer gene
SXI1a (HD1) is introduced into a cells or the a sex inducer
gene SXI2a (HD2) is introduced into a cells [48,49]. Nevertheless, whereas the diploid strains of U. maydis only produce incipient hyphae because maintenance of filamentous
growth also requires heterozygosity at the PR locus [47],
for the self-fertile yeast species studied we found extensive

Page 6 of 14

hyphal growth. Therefore, this also raises the possibility
that in self-fertile red yeast species, the PR locus may be
self-compatible either by constitutive activation of the
pheromone receptor or by an autocrine signalling loop to
produce a permanent signalling pathway. Interestingly,
examples of mutations supporting both hypotheses have
been reported in laboratory [50-52]. Some heterothallic
species of red yeasts also include a few self-fertile strains
(viz. R. kratochvilovae CBS 7436, R. babjevae VKM Y-2911
and S. johnsonii CBS 5470). In most of those cases we
found that both PR alleles were present (Additional File 1)
suggesting that self-fertility in red yeasts can be attained by
different molecular mechanisms.
Phylogenies of pheromone receptors

Using partial sequences of STE3.A1 and STE3.A2 alleles
we compared the evolutionary history of the two PR
whose trans-specific phylogenies indicate that their divergence dates back to the origin of sexuality in basidiomycetes [24,37,53]. Phylogenies based on the protein
sequences of the PR genes were constructed separately for
each receptor (Ste3.A1 and Ste3.A2) in order to maximize
the quality of the alignments (Figure 2). In spite of general
concordance between rDNA and PR trees, three conflicts
were detected in the Ste3.A1 tree. These cases correspond
to the placement of R. diobovatum, R. paludigenum and
R. sphaerocarpum outside their respective groups, by comparison with rDNA and Ste3.A2 trees (Figures 1 and 2).
However, it should be noted that bootstrap values in the
Ste3.A1 tree tended to be lower than those obtained for
the Ste3.A2 tree and that therefore these conflicts might
be due to poor resolution in the Ste3.A1 tree.
Structure of the MAT A1 and MAT A2 genomic regions
encompassing the alternate pheromone receptors

We have previously observed in a restricted number of red
yeast species that genomic regions around the PR locus
exhibited synteny breaks, gene inversions and sequence
divergence between the two mating types as a result of
apparent partial suppression of recombination, while synteny was well conserved across species when MAT regions
of the same mating type where compared [24,39]. Here we
set out to assess whether these observations also held true
for the expanded set of red yeast species presently under
scrutiny. Taking advantage of whole-genome data of Sporobolomyces sp. IAM 13481 (MAT A1) and Rh. graminis
WP1 (MAT A2), we assessed the synteny around the PR
genes in red yeast species belonging to clades A, B and C
(Figure 1 and Additional File 2). PCR primers anchored
on the 3’ end region of the genes flanking the STE3.A1
(RibL18ae and RibL6/RNAPOL) and STE3.A2 (LSm7 and
RibL6/RNAPOL) yielded almost always an amplification
product between 2.5 to 3.0 kb, consistent with a gene
organization identical to that found in the genomes of

the STE3.A2 gene in Rh. graminis WP1 were compared
(Figure 3). In Rh. graminis WP1 we identified two identical
putative pheromone precursor homologues (RgRHA1.A2
and RgRHA2.A2), similar but not syntenic to the RHA2.A2
gene of R. toruloides MAT A2 strains (Figure 3) [39]. The
regions upstream of RgRHA2.A1 and RgRHA2.A2 were
identical. A shorter sequence of approximately 280 bp was
also identical and was detected downstream of RNAPOL in
an inverted orientation (Figure 3). This suggests that
an additional copy of the pheromone precursor gene may
have existed at this genomic location similarly to that
found in MAT A1. Notably, MAT A1 pheromone genes
in S. salmonicolor and R. toruloides were found to be
embedded in conserved inverted repeats [39], a situation
earlier documented in the basidiomycete human pathogen
C. neoformans [54]. These repeats are likely maintained by
intra-allelic gene conversion to ensure maintenance of
gene function in face of the absence of meiotic recombination characteristic of these regions [55,56].

Sporobolomyces sp. IAM 13481 and Rh. graminis WP1
(Figure 3). Sequencing of the complete intervening regions
confirmed the suspected synteny within the same mating
type across the majority of the species (Additional File 2).
However, for some species, like MAT A1 strains of
R. paludigenum, gene order seemed to have been disrupted since no amplification products were obtained
even when using different combinations of primers for the
more conserved flanking genes. Another interesting exception was S. ruineniae CBS 5811, where a MAT A2 pheromone precursor homologue similar to the RHA2.A2 of
R. toruloides [39] was found between RibL18ae and RibL6
instead of the STE3.A1 gene usually present at this location (Additional File 2). This indicates that the STE3.A1
gene has been relocated to a different and presently
unknown genomic location in this species.
We next examined a larger genomic region of the MAT A1
and MAT A2 loci. To do so, 50 Kb regions encompassing

Figure 3 Synteny between MAT A1 and MAT A2 PR loci in different species. The structure of the MAT A1 and MAT A2 PR loci (~50 kb) is
shown for Sporobolomyces sp. IAM 13481 and Rhodotorula graminis WP1 and compared with shorter homologous regions of S. salmonicolor and
R. toruloides. MAT A1 and MAT A2-specific genes are depicted in yellow and dark blue arrows, respectively, showing the direction of transcription.
Genes enclosed in box A are flanking the STE3.A1 gene in most members of Sporidiobolales and those in box B are usually flanking the STE3.A2
gene. Orthologous genes in boxes A and B have the same colour. Genes shared by Sporobolomyces sp. and Rh. graminis are shown in gray,
while others are shown in white. Yellow lines or bars connect, respectively, genes or syntenic blocks that are in the same orientation, while pink
lines or bars indicate inversions. Asterisks in the MAT region of Rh. graminis indicate three identical repeats of ~280 bp (the repeat located
downstream of the RNAPOL gene is inverted in relation to the other two).

Our comparison of the gene content of the MAT genomic regions shows that gene content is similar despite
the phylogenetic distance between Sporobolomyces sp.
and Rh. graminis (Figures 1 and 3) and that apparently
functional copies of each allele have been retained in
both MAT loci. This is in contrast to genes encoded in
sex chromosomes of diploid organisms, for which degeneration and loss of one functional copy frequently occurs
[57]. Maintenance of both alleles in fungal sex-determining regions, including the MAT loci of red yeasts, is most
probably related to the fact that fungi commonly occur
as haploids in the environment, and thus gene degeneration or loss is very likely to be detrimental. However,
gene order seems to have been deeply altered during
mating type divergence and many gene blocks were
found in inverted positions, probably restraining recombination between opposite MAT regions (Figure 3). On
the contrary, within the same mating type, the analysed
regions were found to be highly syntenic even between
more distantly related species (Figure 3).
Diversity and evolution of homeodomain transcription
factors

We have previously observed that the HD1/HD2 alleles of
some red yeasts are much more divergent than the correspondent PR genes [24], and therefore less suitable for
comparisons involving more distantly related species.
Nevertheless, we aimed to ascertain if the genes encoding
these transcriptional regulatory factors appear to be functional within a more expanded group of red yeasts including sexual and asexual strains and species and to evaluate
their pattern of evolution. To this end, partial sequences
of HD1/HD2 alleles were obtained for six species and their
phylogeny is shown in Figure 4. In clade A, formed by
S. johnsonii and S. salmonicolor, the topology of the HD1/
HD2 tree conflicts with the rDNA (Figure 1) and Ste3
(Figure 2) trees because S. johnsonii CBS 2634 harbours
an HD1/HD2 S. salmonicolor-type allele and the converse
situation occurs for S. salmonicolor strains CBS 1012, CBS
4474 and IHMT 2446/96 (Figure 4a). Such discrepancies
suggest that the two species are not fully genetically isolated and that mating with exchange of HD1/HD2 alleles
is still possible. In clade B, the lack of strict species-specificity of HD1/HD2 alleles is also evident for the complex
R. babjevae - Rh. glutinis - Rh. graminis. Our observation
that pheromone precursor genes seem to encode very
similar or even identical peptides in closely related species,
possibly precluding discrimination between species prior
to cell fusion is also in line with this. For example, only
synonymous substitutions were detected when analyzing
the RHA2.A1 genes encoding the tandem pheromone
peptides from different strains of S. salmonicolor and
S. johnsonii (Additional File 3). This results in the

Page 8 of 14

production of identical peptide pheromones, a circumstance that is likely to facilitate interspecies mating.
Judging from available data, a geographic structure for
HD1/HD2 allele distribution seems to be lacking since
strains of Rh. glutinis from different regions have the same
HD1/HD2 alleles and in Rh. graminis different alleles were
recovered from the same region (Figure 4a and Additional
File 1). For most of the species studied each strain had a
unique HD1/HD2 allele although in Rh. glutinis four
strains shared the same HD1/HD2 allele. For two strains
of R. babjevae (VKM Y-1310 and CBS 9072) it seems that
a recent recombination event between the two MAT
regions gave rise to strains with different PR alleles that
share the same HD1/HD2 allele, consistent with the proposed pseudo-bipolar system [24] (Figure 4a). Although
the phylogenies and diversity of HD1/HD2 alleles in S. salmonicolor and S. johnsonii suggested that such events
were likely to occur albeit at low frequency, they had been
thus far detected only in laboratory crosses [24].
Allele divergence as inferred by branch length seems to
be lower for the species in clade A, solely composed of
sexually competent strains, than in clade B, which is dominated by asexual strains (Figure 4a). Adaptive changes in
protein-coding genes may be detected by comparing the
number of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN)
substitutions per site, with the ratio ω = dN/dS providing a
measure of selection at the protein level. We used seven
codon-site models of variable ratios of ω across site, as
implemented in PAML version 4.0 [58], to investigate the
evolutionary constraints acting on the N-terminal domain
of HD1 alleles, which is known to define mating specificity, as well as the initial part of the homeodomain motif.
This analysis was done separately for each clade, and for
clade B it involved sexual and asexual species and sexual
and asexual strains within a species (R. babjevae), whereas
clade A was composed solely of sexual strains (Figure 4).
Detailed descriptions of the models, likelihood ratio statistics and parameter estimates for each dataset are given in
Additional File 4. R. diobovatum was excluded because it
was too divergent from the remaining species in clade B,
presenting dS > 2.0 in most pairwise comparisons. We
found that the HD1 gene evolves faster in clade A than in
clade B given the averaged values of ω for the two clades
(0.504 vs. 0.172, respectively) obtained from model M0
(one ratio), which assumes a single ω for all codons in the
sequence. However, synonymous substitution rates were
significantly higher in clade B than in clade A (P < 0.001,
Mann-Whitney U-test), indicating that in clade B, the
HD1 gene may be under fewer functional constraints, possibly due to a lower strength of codon usage bias associated with changes in the level of gene expression [59].
For the dataset of clade A, models M2a (selection) and M8
(beta&ω), which allow for positive selection at a subset of

Figure 4 Diversity of HD1/HD2 alleles and evolution of HD1 in two different clades of red yeast species. (a) Phylogeny of the HD1/HD2
alleles in two groups of red yeasts. Abbreviations of generic names are as in Figure 1. Strains belonging to the same species are indicated by
boxes of the same colour after strain numbers: Clade A - S. salmonicolor (green) and S. johnsonii (light green); clade B - Rh. glutinis (red), R.
babjevae (pink) and Rh. graminis (light pink). R. diobovatum formed a more divergent group external to clade B. Sexual (MAT A1/A2), asexual and
self-fertile strains are indicated as “A1/A2”, “As” and “Sf”, respectively, after strain numbers. Circles before each strain depict the type of
pheromone receptor genes (yellow, STE3.A1; blue, STE3.A2). White stars in tree branches symbolize premature stop codons detected in the
corresponding HD2 alleles. Branch lengths are given in number of substitutions per site. Bootstrap values (>50%) from 1000 replicates are shown.
(b) Posterior probabilities of site classes for codons along the N-terminal and HD domains of the HD1 gene, obtained under model M8 (beta&ω)
for the clade B dataset. The first six categories are collapsed into one, represented as ω < 0.26 (purifying selection) as well as the categories
seven to ten that are represented as 0.26 < ω < 0.92. (c) Posterior probabilities obtained for the dataset of clade A under the model M8. The
first 5 categories are collapsed into one (ω <0.26) as well as the categories six to ten (0.26 < ω < 0.93). Sites for which the posterior probability
for the site class of positive selection (with ω > 1) exceeds 0.80 are inferred to be under diversifying selection and are indicated by asterisks (see
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 in Additional File 4 for details).

sites, fitted the data better than the null models M1a
(nearly-neutral), M7 (beta) and M8a (beta&ωs= 1), which
do not allow for positive selection (Supplementary Tables
S1 and S2 in Additional File 4). Parameter estimates under
model M8 (beta&ω) for the dataset of clade A suggest that

~ 22% of the sites are under diversifying selection (ω > 1)
with ωs = 1.97. These sites were found within the regions
determining MAT specificity, in accordance with previous
observations [24]. Nevertheless, the average ω along the
N-terminal region was < 1, as also observed in other

Coelho et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:249
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/249

systems such as the S-loci of plants [60,61]. Additionally,
sites within the homeodomain motif exhibited low ω (ω <
0.26) indicative of strong purifying selection. The posterior
probabilities obtained under model M8 for the different
site classes (see Supplementary Table S1 in Additional
File 4) are shown in Figure 4. For the clade B dataset
(R. babjevae, Rh. glutinis and Rh. graminis), positive selection models did not fit the data better than the models
implying neutral evolution indicating that positive selection is not driving the evolution of the HD1 gene in this
clade (see Supplementary Table S2 in Additional File 4).
Moreover, model M8a (beta&ωs= 1) where an extra site
class was constrained to have ω = 1, seems to fit the data
better than other models (Supplementary Table S2 in
Additional File 4) consistent with the identification of
relaxed purifying selection [62]. This may be a consequence of loss of sexual competence in Rh. glutinis, Rh.
graminis, and in several strains of R. babjevae. In line with
this, stop codons were found in N-terminal regions of the
HD2 gene of Rh. graminis CBS 3043 and R. babjevae CBS
2366, which is asexual. In Rh. glutinis CBS 2367 a dinucleotide repeat (CT)13 insertion followed by a premature
stop codon most likely renders this gene non-functional.
Although C-terminal truncations of other HD proteins,
including Sxi1a in C. neoformans [44], did not affect their
functionality, the early stop codons found in asexual
strains of red yeasts are located in the N-terminal region
of the protein, thus presumably originating very short
(non-functional) proteins devoid of homeodomain motifs.
For the HD1 gene, no stop codons were found in the analysed regions and the evolution of the homeodomain
motif seems to be dominated by purifying selection in
species of both clades. While this may suggest that HD1
proteins have additional roles that do not require heterodimerization (a possibility so far poorly explored in basidiomycetes), another possibility is that this gene is losing its
mating specific role in species of clade B as a consequence
of relaxed functional constraints. Therefore, it seems possible that the sequence divergence of the HD1/HD2 genes
examined here is governed both by diversifying and by
relaxing selection, and that this may be either the cause or
the consequence of loss of sexual competence by individual strains.
Our results suggest that loss of sex might not occur uniformly across the Sporidiobolales. Different molecular evolution patterns may be related with distinct selective
constraints acting on different species. S. salmonicolor and
S. johnsonii exemplify a case of strictly sexual red yeasts
whose HD1/HD2 alleles exhibit low dS values possibly due
to some form of constraint on synonymous substitutions
like codon bias [63,64] (Figures 4), but where allele specific
regions are evolving under positive selection. The study of
maintenance or loss of sex in red yeast could benefit from

Page 10 of 14

a larger population sampling that would allow to look for
genetic footprints of recombination [42]. Nevertheless,
even fungi shown to be purely clonal from a population
genetic perspective (viz. Penicillum marneffei), also present
MAT genes in their genomes [65], suggesting that sex has
been lost only recently.

Conclusions
We examined 216 strains belonging to 32 species of the
Sporidiobolales and found apparently functional PR
homologues for most strains, irrespective of their sexual
or asexual status. In addition, we observed that all asexual
species have phylogenetic close relatives that mate well in
laboratory conditions and we think it is likely that asexual
red yeasts have lost the ability to cross, although this has
not (yet) resulted in the degeneration or loss of MAT
genes in most cases. However, we detected mutations
likely driving loss of function in HD2 homologues in some
asexual strains here investigated, which seems to be consistent with relaxed selection as a consequence of loss of
sex.
Taken together, our results suggest a fuzzy separation
between sexual and asexual red yeast species, illustrated by
the existence of asexual strains within sexual species and
by the conservation of MAT regions in asexual species.
The co-existence of sexual and asexual reproduction in
red yeasts probably facilitates the emergence of asexual
lineages. For example, Rh. glutinis and Rh. graminis seem
to derive from populations of a heterothallic R. babjevaelike ancestor that have independently lost the ability to
mate. Notably, sexual reproduction in the latter species
seems to be lost easily, as many of the R. babjevae strains
we investigated were unable to mate.
Several authors have argued that most asexual fungi are
evolutionary dead ends awaiting extinction [29,66,67].
This fits well with our observations in red yeasts since we
did not find evidence among extant species for ancient
events of loss of sexuality. Instead, we uncovered abundant
substantiation for frequent and recent such events, leading
in some cases to the isolation of lineages and eventually to
speciation but never to the generation of exclusively asexual phylogenetic lineages that persist for a long time.
Methods
Strains and mating tests

The list of strains studied and relevant information pertaining to them is given in Additional File 1. To study
sexual compatibility, pairs of 2-4 day-old cultures were
mixed on corn meal agar (Difco), incubated at 18 °C 22 °C for 1 week and examined microscopically using
phase-contrast optics for production of mycelium with
clamp connections and teliospores (globose and thickwalled resting structures that are the site of karyogamy).

PCR detection and sequencing of MAT A1 and MAT A2
pheromone receptor genes and the conserved
surrounding regions

Diagnostic PCRs with degenerate primers for STE3.A1 and
STE3.A2 alleles were carried out to directly identify the PR
genes and (re)assign the molecular mating types in most of
the studied red yeast strains (Additional Files 1 and 5). For
some selected strains the amplification products were purified and sequenced with the same primers (Additional File
1). However, this approach failed to yield amplification products for some of the species. In these cases, STE3.A1 and
STE3.A2 alleles were detected by long range PCR using primers based on the available sequences of the more conserved genes flanking the STE3.A1 in Sporobolomyces sp.
IAM 13481 (genes RibL18ae and RibL6 or RNAPOL) and
STE3.A2 in Rh. graminis WP1 (genes LSm7 and RibL6 or
RNAPOL) (Additional File 5). The amplification products
were subsequently sequenced by primer-walking (Additional File 5). This latter approach was also used to confirm
if synteny in the immediate vicinity of the PR genes in
MAT A1 and MAT A2 strains was maintained across an
expanded set of red yeast species (Additional Files 2 and 5).
For each yeast species, PCR reactions, cycling conditions
and primer sequences are specified in Additional File 5.
PCR amplification and sequencing of HD1/HD2 region
and the RHA2 pheromone precursor gene

Using the HD1/HD2 sequences of S. salmonicolor and
Sporobolomyces sp. IAM 13481 [24], a Blastn search was
performed in the NCBI Trace Archive database of Rh. graminis WP1 and the sequences corresponding to positive
hits were assembled. The genome of Rh. graminis WP1
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Rhoba1_1/Rhoba1_ 1.home.html
was employed to confirm the assembled region, which is
located in scaffold 16 (base positions 15900-16300). The
deduced HD1 and HD2 protein sequences of Rh. graminis,
S. salmonicolor and Sporobolomyces sp. IAM 13481 were
aligned and the conserved regions were used to design
degenerate primers (MC118 and MC120) to amplify and
sequence the corresponding N-terminal and intergenic
regions of the HD1/HD2 genes in several strains of R. babjevae, Rh. graminis, Rh. glutinis and R. diobovatum (Additional Files 1 and 5). GenBank accession numbers are
listed in Additional File 1. The RHA2 gene was amplified
in selected S. salmonicolor strains using primers (MC040
and MC073) that anchored on the STE20 and KAP95
flanking genes. The amplification products were subsequently sequenced by primer-walking. For PCR reactions,
cycling conditions, primer sequences and GenBank accession numbers see Additional File 5.
Sequence data and phylogenetic analyses

For the species tree, PCR amplification and sequencing
was done as previously described [41]. Sequences of both

Page 11 of 14

regions were concatenated and subsequently aligned
using ClustalW 1.4 [68] included in the BioEdit software
[69]. The phylogenetic tree was inferred by Maximum
Likelihood (ML) with PhyML [70]. FindModel, a web
implementation of ModelTest [70,71], was used with the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the model
that best fit our data. The General Time Reversible
model with a discrete gamma distribution was chosen
(GTR+G; shape parameter = 0.1947). Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae (DQ366868/AY877416) and Leucosporidium scottii (AF0700419/AF444495) were used to root
the tree. For the HD1/HD2 tree (Figure 4), nucleotide
sequences were aligned with MUSCLE [72] since it produced a better alignment for such highly divergent
sequences. The phylogenetic tree was also inferred by
ML based on the TN93+G+I model (shape = 2.0446;
pinv = 0.0524). Protein sequences of the PR (Ste3A1 and
Ste3A2) were deduced from the DNA sequences after
removal of putative introns, either manually or using
AUGUSTUS software [73]. ProtTest [74] with Akaike
information criterion (AIC) was used to select the model
that best fit our data and phylogenetic trees were inferred
with maximum likelihood (ML). The MtREV+G+F
model (shape parameter = 1.198) [75-77] was chosen for
the Ste3A1 tree and the WAG+G+F (shape parameter =
1.0496) [76-78] was selected for the Ste3A2 dataset.
Microbotryum lycnhidis-diocae pr-MatA1 (EF584742)
and pr-MatA2 (ABU62846) were used to root Figure 2
trees. Bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 replicates for all trees. GenBank accession numbers of the
novel sequences are listed in Additional File 1 and raw
phylogenetic data (alignments and tree files) is included
in Additional File 6.
Estimation of the evolution rates of 5’ end and
homeodomain regions of the HD1 gene

The region of the HD1 gene corresponding to the 5’end
and the initial part of the homeodomain motif was amplified and sequenced for the strains indicated in Additional
File 1, which lists also GenBank accession numbers. The
deduced protein sequences were first aligned with MUSCLE [72] and then poorly aligned regions and regions containing indels were removed. The resulting alignment was
used to obtain the corresponding nucleotide (codonbased) alignment. Likelihood-based tests were used to
investigate the type of evolutionary pressure acting on the
sequenced region of the HD1 gene, using the CODEML
program within PAML software (version 4.4) [58]. The
analyses were carried out using two separate datasets corresponding to clade A (S. salmonicolor and S. johnsonii,
sexual) and clade B (Rh. glutinis and Rh. graminis, asexual;
R. babjevae and R. diobovatum, sexual but several strains
of the former are asexual). Synonymous substitution rates
(dS) were estimated for each dataset by comparing rates

Coelho et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:249
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/249

between taxa in all possible combinations (runmode = -2
in PAML). Since dS values obtained from R. diobovatum
were > 2.0 in several pairwise comparisons, strains of this
species were removed from subsequent analyses. MannWhitney U-test was used to examine whether or not the
dS pattern differed between both clades. The tree files
used as an input file for CODEML were produced by
Maximum Likelihood (ML) with PhyML [70] and using
FindModel with AIC to select the model that best fit each
dataset [T92+G (shape parameter = 1,085) for clade A and
TN93+G+I (shape = 1.135; pinv = 0.164) for clade B].
Codon-based likelihood analysis was conducted under
seven site models [79,80] implemented in CODEML, and
their main characteristics are described in Supplementary
Methods (Additional File 4). To verify which models fit
the data better, likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were performed by comparing twice the log-likelihood difference
(-2 two nested models usingΔl) between two nested
models using a c 2 distribution, with the number of
degrees of freedom (df) equal to the difference in the
number of parameters between models [81]. To examine
whether or not the analysed region evolves under positive
selection, models that allow a class of codons with positively selected sites (i.e. dN/dS or ω > 1 in models M2a
and M8) were compared with their nested neutral models
(M1 and M7, respectively), using 2 df. [81,82]. In addition, comparison between models M8 and M8a (1 df)
also allowed testing for evidence of positive selection and
to eliminate the potential identification of relaxed purifying selection [80] (see Supplementary Methods in Additional File 4). According to the LRTs, when the positive
selection models fitted the data significantly better that
the neutral models, the identification of sites evolving
under positive selection was obtained by Bayes empirical
Bayes (BEB) calculation of posterior probabilities (pp) for
site class implemented in models M2a and M8 [83].
Codon sites with ω > 1 and ω < 0.25 and pp values > 80%
were considered to be under positive or purifying selection, respectively. Likelihood ratio statistics and parameter estimates for the two datasets are listed in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 (Additional File 4).
