Abstract
Background: The ultimate phenome of any organism is modulated by regulated transcription of many
genes. Characterization of genetic makeup is thus crucial for understanding the molecular basis of
phenotypic diversity, evolution and response to intra- and extra-cellular stimuli. Chickpea is the world's
third most important food legume grown in over 40 countries representing all the continents. Despite its
importance in plant evolution, role in human nutrition and stress adaptation, very little ESTs and
differential transcriptome data is available, let alone genotype-specific gene signatures. Present study
focuses on Fusarium wilt responsive gene expression in chickpea.
Results: We report 6272 gene sequences of immune-response pathway that would provide genotypedependent spatial information on the presence and relative abundance of each gene. The sequence
assembly led to the identification of a CaUnigene set of 2013 transcripts comprising of 973 contigs and
1040 singletons, two-third of which represent new chickpea genes hitherto undiscovered. We identified
209 gene families and 262 genotype-specific SNPs. Further, several novel transcription regulators were
identified indicating their possible role in immune response. The transcriptomic analysis revealed 649 noncannonical genes besides many unexpected candidates with known biochemical functions, which have
never been associated with pathostress-responsive transcriptome.
Conclusion: Our study establishes a comprehensive catalogue of the immune-responsive root
transcriptome with insight into their identity and function. The development, detailed analysis of CaEST
datasets and global gene expression by microarray provide new insight into the commonality and diversity
of organ-specific immune-responsive transcript signatures and their regulated expression shaping the
species specificity at genotype level. This is the first report on differential transcriptome of an unsequenced
genome during vascular wilt.

Background
Living cells have evolved to perceive and integrate different signals from their surroundings and to respond by
modulating the appropriate gene expression. Expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) provide an invaluable resource for
analysis of gene expression associated with specific
organs, growth conditions, developmental processes and
responses to various environmental stresses [1-3]. It
bridges the gap between the genome sequences and gene
function. ESTs have been useful for intra- and intergenomic comparisons, gene discovery, generation of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), cloning of genes from
MStag peptide sequences, transcript pattern characterization, identifying splice variants, erroneous annotations in
the genome database and incomplete prediction of gene
structure [4,5]. Further, the transcriptome of cells and
organs comprise a focused set of transcripts that fulfills
discrete but varied cellular functions. The analyses of
organ specific transcriptome provide additional information about localization of gene function and pathway
compartmentalization. Whereas the transcriptome
research is quite advanced in animals, yeast, bacteria and
reference plants like Arabidopsis and rice [6-10] there is
relatively less information in crop plants.
Legumes are valuable agricultural and commercial crops
that serve as important nutrient sources for human diet
and animal feed. About one third of human nutrition
comes from legumes and in many developing countries,
legumes serve as the only source of protein. Many secondary metabolites in legumes have been implicated in
defense and are of particular interest as novel pharmaceuticals [11]. Five tribes constitute the family fabaceae, of
which one representative genus each from four tribes have
been used to generate ESTs [4,12,13]. However, the tribe
ciceri having a single genus Cicer, remained as the understudied legume. Chickpea, the most important member of
the genus Cicer, represents the world's third important
pulse crop. It is grown on about 10 mha area worldwide
and the global production exceeds 8 million tons [14]. In
many water-deficient regions of the world, it serves as an
important protein-rich food and an increasingly valuable
traded commodity. Chickpea has one of the highest nutritional compositions of edible legume and does not contain any specific major anti-nutritional factor, rather it is
used in herbal medicine. Despite the importance of chickpea in the study of plant evolution, its role in nutritional
requirement in humans, and stress adaptation, nothing is
known about the genes responsible for these traits-primarily because it is recalcitrant to genetic analysis. Unlike
genetically tractable plants such as tomato, maize and
Arabidopsis, chickpea produces a limited number of seeds.
Furthermore, its genome is large (732 Mbp) as compared
to Arabidopsis (125 Mbp). Consequently, chickpea has
remained outside the realm of both modern genome-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/415

sequencing initiatives and large scale functional genomics
studies. Currently available completely annotated plant
genome sequences make it possible to study the genomes
of agriculturally important genetically complex crop
plants such as chickpea by comparing the ESTs derived
from them. Only very recently, attention has been given
from both genomics and proteomics perspect to this
important food legume [15-19]. Because of its evolutionary position as a key node within legumes as well as its
nutritional and medicinal significance to humans, chickpea is ideally suited for genomic prospecting.
Transcriptional programs that regulate development and
stress response are exquisitely controlled in space and
time. Elucidating these programs that underlie development is essential to understand the acquisition of cell and
tissue identity. Root in higher plants is a highly organized
structure that plays a key role in nutrient acquisition and
water uptake besides its primary function of mechanical
support to the plant. Nevertheless, it is essentially the
entry point for the soil borne pathogens into the plant
body. Of the soil borne root pathogen, vascular wilt is the
most important disease. Vascular wilt caused by Fusarium
is ubiquitous evolutionarily and effects crop plants across
families. In particular, chickpea wilt, is widespread in
occurrence and on an average causes substantial loss of 10
to 15% in production every year worldwide. During the
infection process the fungus invades roots and spreads
systemically through the host's vascular system, breaking
down the cell walls to form gels that block the plant's
transport system thereby causing yellowing and wilting
symptoms. In general, the wilt symptoms appear as chlorotic spots on the lower leaves followed by discoloration
and necrosis. Vascular discoloration occurs from the roots
to the young stems, followed by a yellowing and wilting
of the leaves before final necrosis [20]. When uprooted
the stem is split vertically and internal discoloration is visible in pith and xylem [21]. The susceptible genotypes
take less than 25 days for wilting whereas the resistant
ones do not show any symptoms of wilting upto 60 days.
In the present study, two genotypes JG-62 and WR-315
were used which are known to be susceptible and resistant
to Fusarium wilt, respectively. The localization of the fungus was limited in the resistant cultivar while extensive
colonization occurs in susceptible one by fourth to fifth
day post infection. Externally the extent of mycelial colonization is manifested in the form of browning of the
roots after 72 hours in the susceptible genotype while no
such discoloration is evident in the resistant one.
To understand the regulatory networks and metabolic
pathways governing genotype-specific cellular responses
towards different signals, we have initiated ESTablishing
CaUnigene dataset and a genome-wide analysis of gene
expression in this food legume. As a first step towards this,

we have developed ESTs and stress responsive transcriptome of chickpea, as a basis for future transcriptome and
proteome comparisons of genetic mutants, pathogeninfected and/or environmentally challenged plants. A
total of 6272 high quality ESTs were identified, functionally annotated, computationally analysed and classified
into different functional categories. Of the 2013 Unigenes, 807 were identified as previously uncharacterized.
In addition, we have developed a cDNA based microarray
chip and examined the global state of gene expression in
the chickpea root during vascular wilt to identify the
potential innate immune responsive candidates involved
in the complex regulatory network that may function in
this organ. These transcriptional signatures often predict
previously unknown cellular functions. ESTablished set of
pathostress-responsive organ-specific unigenes and the
putative differentially expressed genes identified from the
present study will provide a foundation for future investigation of the expression and function of the genes and
proteins to build the interactome map at system level of
chickpea and other legumes. In addition, gene mining of
these databases, aided by microarray chip, can be used to
select candidate genes involved in plant immunity. In the
future, it will also be interesting to compare the spatial
and temporal transcriptional complexity that underlies
organ-specific innate immune response in other multicellular organisms.

Results
Chickpea EST database
In an attempt to construct a functional EST dataset for discovering subset of genotype dependent, organ specific and
extra and intra cellular stimuli responsive genes expressed
in chickpea, in this study we have constructed two suppression-subtracted cDNA libraries, one from vascular
wilt susceptible genotype (JG-62) and the other from
resistant genotype (WR-315). The source of RNA for each
library was root and collar tissue from the 25-d-old chickpea seedlings challenged with wilt pathogen, Fusarium
oxysporum ciceri race 1, vs control tissue. In total, 6955
ESTs were generated and sequenced from the two libraries
out of which 2908 were from susceptible and 4047 from
resistant genotypes. Although no chimeric sequence was
found but about 9.8% of the sequences were discarded
due to low quality of the sequence, short sequence length,

sequence from other organellar origin or the absence of
the insert and the remaining 6272 ESTs were considered
for sequence assembly (Table 1). The high quality ESTs
that passed the base calling, appropriate length, vector
masking and mitochondrial filters were assembled into
contigs using CAP3 program [22]. The 6272 high quality
sequences had an average read of 366 bp and a cumulative
length of 2.29 Mbp. Of the total 6272 ESTs, 1040 were
found to be classified as singletons whereas 5232 assembled into 973 contigs (Table 2). The additional information about contigs and singletons is given in additional
file 1 and 2 respectively. The redundancy of clones in the
contigs ranged from 2 to 230. The total contigs and singletons comprised a non redundant chickpea unigene (CaUnigene) set of 2013 different transcripts (see Additional
file 3). 3.9% of the unigenes (79) contained more than 10
sequences per contig. Of the total high quality ESTs, 1202
were specific to susceptible genotype whereas 2168 were
specific to resistant genotype and 2902 were common to
both (Figure 1). The abundance of transcripts, shapes or
results in a genotype specific function in response to stimuli in a given space and time. Absence of chimeras, high
percentage of good quality sequences and good average
insert size suggested that the libraries were of high quality
(Table 1).
Functional annotation and classification of chickpea ESTs
In order to understand the function of immune-responsive ESTs, the entire set of 2013 CaUnigenes were annotated on the basis of similarities to the known or putative
ESTs in the NCBI database. Using the best hits found by

using gene function databases like GO http://www.gene
ontology.org, metacyc http://www.metacyc.org and COG
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG. However, the classification of transcripts is only tentative, since the biological
function of many genes identified has not yet been established experimentally. The distributions of ESTs into
diverse functional classes as shown in additional file 3 are
described below.

sequences and were sorted into various functional categories as shown in Figure 2. We were able to assign function

homology (NSH) class. In addition, 18.33% and 3.47%
of the unigenes matched with hypothetical and unknown
proteins respectively. Genes were assigned to the func-

Genes involved in regulatory pathways (cell signaling and
transcription and RNA processing and modification)
Genes involved in cell signaling, transcription and RNA
processing are known to regulate many cellular responses
in an organism. Our data showed the presence of different
types of protein kinases in both susceptible and tolerant
chickpea genotypes. While serine/threonine protein
kinase (contig86), Serine/threonine protein kinase active
site (CaF1_JIE_03_A_05) and somatic embryogenesis
receptor-like kinase were present only in the susceptible
genotype; flag-tagged protein kinase domain of putative
MAPKKK and protein kinase (CaF1_WIE_51_C_11) were
found in the resistant one. Protein kinases are involved in
disease response via a signaling cascade presumably conserved in plants, insects and mammals [23] while somatic
embryogenesis related kinases are associated with brassinosteroid signaling pathway that plays a key role in plant
defense [24]. The EST data revealed many components of

calcium signaling such as calmodulin, calcium dependent
calmodulin independent kinase, CIP kinase and calcium/
calmodulin-regulated receptor-like kinase in both the
genotypes indicating an elaborate role of calcium signaling in immune response. The subsets of 14-3-3 proteins
were also identified in both susceptible and resistant genotypes. For example, contigs 527, 568, 947 and singletons
CaF1_WIE_13_A_05, CaF1_WIE_55_G_01 representing
14-3-3 gene family were present in the resistant genotype
while the other member of this gene family, contig 133,
was present only in the susceptible one. 14-3-3 has earlier
been shown to interact with fusicoccin, the fungal toxin
that causes membrane hyperpolarization through activation of plasma membrane H+ATPase [25]. Other pathostress-responsive signaling components identified are
WD40-like protein, response regulator receiver, and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. While WD40 and LRR
proteins were found in both the genotypes, response regulator receiver was exclusive to the susceptible genotype.
The LRR proteins are known to play role in defense signaling [26]. While WD40-like proteins are reported to be
involved in varied functions including organogenesis
[27]; vacuolar trafficking [28] and light signaling [29],
their role in immune response is not known.
The potentially increased activity of various signaling
pathways is associated with differential expression of
many families of transcription factors during plant pathogenesis [30-32]. The functional class of transcription associated genes, in this study, constituted about 3.58% of the
total ESTs that comprised families of transcription factors
including zinc finger, MYB, BEL1-like homeodomain
transcription factor, homeodomain leucine zipper HDZ3,
G-box binding PG2, Zinc finger GATA-type, putative AP2binding protein, bHLH and WRKY. While exploring the
source of the ESTs coding for these transcription factors,
an important and noteworthy observation was that a particular class of transcription regulators showed predominance or was specific to either susceptible or resistant
genotype. For example, Myb and HDZ classes were predominant, whereas, PR related transcription factor and
WRKY were exclusive to the resistant genotype. On the
other hand BEL1-like homeodomain transcription factor,
NOT2/NOT3/NOT5 and G-box binding protein PG2 were
found only in the susceptible genotype. This data suggests
that interplay of a broad spectrum of transcription factors
possibly regulates multiple signaling cascades during
immune-stress.
Various RNA binding proteins have potential to modulate
gene expression and might be involved in processes like
RNA metabolism, mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis,
transport and translation. We observed the presence of
dead box RNA helicase, pre-mRNA processing ribonucleoprotein binding region, splicing factor 3B subunit 10

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/415

and RNA-binding region RNP-1 during vascular wilt of
chickpea. All these genes were more abundant in resistant
genotype. While dead box RNA helicase was reported to
be involved in development and stress responses [33], the
role of splicing factor and RNA-binding region RNP-1 in
pathostress is yet to be established.
Genes involved in translation, post translational
modifications and protein turnover
Cellular processes like translation, post translational
event and protein turnover are crucial for cell survival
under different developmental stages and varied environmental conditions. In the present study, this class constituted about 8.84% of ESTs and comprised predominantly
the ribosomal proteins apart from some translation initiation factors. Genes encoding major ribosomal proteins
such as S6, S8, S9, and L24/L26 were found both in susceptible and resistant genotypes. Translation factor SUI1
homolog and eukaryotic elongation factors (EF-1 and
EF-2) play a pivotal role in protein biosynthesis. Their
presence in CaUnigene set is indicative of their role in
immune response.

A particularly sensitive, rapid and reversible response to
environmental stimuli or to a programmatic change in
cell state is the post-translational modification of specific
proteins. In our study, 4.27% of the CaUnigenes correspond to proteins involved in protein modifications and
turnover. The presence of cysteine proteinases and cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases more predominantly in resistant genotype indicate their role in
pathostress responses. The presence of heat shock protein,
DnaJ is interesting as it has been shown to be involved in
different environmental stresses including high temperature and salinity treatment [34]. Our results revealed the
presence of a wide range of proteins involved in protein
turnover that include ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2,
ubiquitin-protein ligase, 20S proteasome alpha 6 subunit,
F-box protein and protein disulphide in both the genotypes. In plants, ubiquitin/proteasome pathway of protein
degradation has been implicated in defense [35]. These
results suggest that regulated protein synthesis, modification and protein turnover may play central role in enabling plants to alter their proteome to maximize their
chances of survival under adverse conditions.
Genes encoding nucleotide binding proteins
In our study, GTP binding proteins were found to be the
major class of nucleotide binding proteins in susceptible
as well as resistant genotypes. The stress-responsive predominant GTP binding proteins were of Ras, Rab and Ran
type. ESTs encoding ras-like small monomeric GTP-binding protein and GMPase were present in the susceptible
genotype while Rab, RAB7C, GTP cyclohydrolase and
RabGAP/TBC were found only in the resistant one. How-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:415

ever, ESTs encoding Ras small GTPase and RAB1X were
identified in both the genotypes. GTP binding proteins
are reported to be associated with a wide range of growth
and developmental processes [36] besides their role in
plant defense [37].
Genes involved in metabolism
Developmental changes and stress responses are often
correlated with or result in adjustments in various metabolic pathways. The functional class of metabolism comprised of about 14.56% of the unigenes and represented
the largest class apart from NSH and hypothetical proteins. The genes present in this class represented several
biochemical pathways such as carbohydrate, fatty acid,
energy and protein metabolism besides nitrogen and
nucleotide metabolism. The genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism comprised alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH),
glyceraldehyde3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), enolase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase,
malate dehydrogenase, phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) carboxylase and triosephosphate isomerase and were present
in both the genotypes. Most of these enzymes are known
to show altered expression in response to stress [38,39].
Though very little is known about the direct role of these
proteins in defense, many such enzymes are involved in
maintaining metabolite pool that may drive the metabolic processes to overcome such stresses. Polygalactouronase inhibiting protein (PGIP) was present in both the
susceptible and resistant genotypes. The PGIPs are cell
wall proteins, which act against fungal polygalactouronases that are important pathogenecity factors [40].
Besides their classical function, they also form long chain
oligogalactouronides and facilitate the activation of plant
defense responses [41]. We observed the presence of 1,3glucanase, a PR 2 family protein [42], which was earlier
shown to be expressed in response to pathogen infection
[43].

The genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, for example, acyl
Co-A synthetase and acyl Co-A binding proteins were
found to be present in both the genotypes. The enzyme
acyl Co-A synthetase has been shown to be induced in
response to compatible and incompatible interactions
between Xanthomonas and Capsicum annum [44], while
Acyl Co-A binding proteins play an important role in
intracellular transport and formation of acyl Co-A pools
[45]. ESTs encoding desaturases in the CaUnigene set
showed varied substrate specificity between the two genotypes. For example, oleate and sterol desaturases were
found in the susceptible genotype and putative desaturase-like protein was present in the resistant one. Desaturases catalyze the formation of double bonds in lipids
thereby increasing the lipid fluidity, which might be
required as an adjustment associated with membrane stability under progressive wilting. ESTs corresponding to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/415

other lipid metabolism genes such as serine C-palmitoyltransferase, was also found to be present in stressed tissues. Identification of sterol metabolism related enzymes
such as sterol methyl transferases and oxysterol binding
proteins suggest the occurrence of lipid modifications
during pathostress. Presence of HMG Co-A reductase
which catalyzes the synthesis of mevalonate, a specific
precursor of plant defense metabolite sesquiterpene phytoelexins, is indicative of its role in cell defense.
Several amino acids act as precursors for the synthesis of
specialized metabolites, during varied cellular adaptations. ESTs encoding enzymes involved in amino acid
metabolism, for example, arginine decarboxylase, aspartate aminotransferase, and cysteine synthase were identified in both the genotypes. Recent evidence suggests that
arginine decarboxylase, involved in putrescine biosynthesis, is induced in response to various environmental
stresses [46,47]. Proline dehydrogenase and many proline-rich proteins were identified in resistant genotype.
Proline dehydrogenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in proline degradation and serves important functions in stress
responses [48].
Nucleotide metabolism related genes such as nuleoside
diphosphate kinase (NDK), adenine nucleotide translocator and polynucleotide phosphorylase were also identified in both the genotypes. Previously, it has been shown
that the overexpressing NDK provides higher ability to
eliminate H2O2, indicating its potential role in the management of reactive oxygen species under stress [49].
Genes involved in cellular transport and homeostasis
Stress-induced reorganization and spatial distribution of
many key metabolites in plants require efficient transport
machinery. It is well known that Arabidopsis has diverse
array of genes for multi-efflux transport and response to
stress signals, and rice has more secondary transporter
genes for carbohydrate and nutrient transport [50]. Various transport associated genes were identified in this
study. Of these, clathrin adaptor complexes and putative
polyol transporter protein 4 were expressed in the susceptible genotype while multidrug resistance protein, Sec Y
protein, ABC transporter family protein, Ctr copper transporter, SKS3 copper ion binding protein showed expression only in the resistant genotype. Although few of these
transport associated proteins showed genotype specificity,
others like general substrate transporter, intracellular
chloride channel, phosphate transporter 5, were representative of both the genotypes. ABC transporters and
multidrug resistance genes are known to function in plant
defense [51,52], while the role of other above mentioned
genes in plant defense is yet to be discovered. The chloride
channel was reported to be activated by CDPK in guard
cell [53] whereas the chloride transporter has been found

Page 6 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:415

to be involved in hypo-osmotic turgor regulation [54].
Further, polyol transporter was shown to be expressed
during maturation of common plantain companion cells
[55], though its role in plant defense remains to be ambiguous. These results suggest that transport of both organic
and inorganic substances may play a crucial role in
immune response.
Genes involved in hormone responses
Salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene play
key roles in developmental regulation and stress
responses through cross communicating signal transduction pathways. These hormones accumulate in response
to pathogen infection and in turn lead to the activation of
distinct sets of defense related genes [56]. We observed
presence of ethylene signaling pathway genes, for example, ethylene responsive transcoactivator and putative ethylene response protein in the susceptible genotype while
ethylene receptor was present only in the resistant genotype. Coronatine-insensitive 1 and BRU1 precursor which
are associated with JA and brassinosteroid pathways
respectively, were specific to the resistant genotype. In
addition, we found auxin signaling related proteins, of
which, auxin-responsive SAUR was found in both the genotypes but auxin-regulated dual specificity cytosolic
kinase was present only in the resistant genotype. Aux/IAA
protein, auxin-induced protein IAA12 and auxin-induced
putative aldo/keto reductase family protein were found
specifically in the susceptible genotype. Our future efforts
would be the investigation of their possible role in plant
immunity.
Genes involved in cell cycle and DNA metabolism
Cell division and cell cycle progression in plants is often
altered in response to various environmental stresses [57].
Many cell division and cell-cycle related proteins, for
example, putative kinetochore, cell division protein FtsZ
and cdc2MsF identified in this study were predominant in
the resistant genotype suggesting pathostress responsive
alterations of cell cycle in chickpea. Genes involved in
DNA replication and repair like DNA repair protein RadA,
putative polyprotein and putative gag-pol polyprotein
were identified from susceptible genotype while putative
helicase was common in both the genotypes. These findings are interesting because very little is known about the
role of such genes in plant immune responses.
Genes involved in development and cytoskeletal
organization
The genes involved in development and cytoskeletal
organization account for 1.24% of the total CaUnigene
set. The candidate genes involved in development were
those encoding enzymes associated with fruit ripening
and senescence, and several storage proteins like albumin
and agglutinin. Most of the genes in this class were identi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/415

fied in both the susceptible and resistant genotypes, however agglutinin was specific to the resistant one. While
there have been reports on association of the processes of
plant defense and senescence [58], the involvement of ripening related proteins has never been implicated in
immune responses. Seed storage proteins like germin and
albumin have been shown to be involved in stress
responses [59], however, role of agglutinin in plant
immunity is not known.
Cytoskeleton is thought to contribute to the establishment of effective barriers at the cell periphery against
pathogen ingression. Substantiating this phenomenon,
several structural proteins were identified that include
actin, microtubule bundling polypeptide, and beta tubulin, besides genes associated with cytoskeletal reorganization like actin-depolymerizing factor and putative spindle
disassembly related genes. Although actin was present in
both the genotypes, actin-depolymerizing factor and
putative spindle disassembly related genes were specific to
resistant genotype.
Genes involved in cellular redox and energy metabolism
The oxidative burst is one of the earliest cellular responses
following successful pathogen recognition. Several
enzymes involved in oxidative burst were identified in
both susceptible and resistant genotypes that include peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase
and quinone oxidoreductase. Apoplastic generation of
superoxide or its dismutation product, hydrogen peroxide, has been shown in response to a variety of pathogens
[60]. These enzymes restrict the ROS-dependent damage
and may lead to the activation of plant immune response
[61].

Energy production has an impact on the overall metabolic
state and the energy supply is the key factor for the maintenance of cell intactness under various stress conditions.
We observed the presence of genes encoding different proteins involved in ATP biosynthesis like alternative
NAD(P)H dehydrogenase and putative ADP, ATP carrierlike protein in susceptible genotype. However, alternative
oxidase 2b and NADH dehydrogenase were identified in
the resistant genotype only. Nevertheless, vacuolar H+ATPase subunit A and ATP synthase beta subunit were
common to both genotypes. While the involvement of
these proteins in abiotic stress, energy conservation and
maintenance of redox potential is well established [62],
their exact role in plant immune response is yet to be elucidated.
Genes involved in secondary metabolism
Most secondary metabolites of phenyl propanoid pathway, including lignins, isoflavonoid-phytoalexins and
other phenolic compounds are instrumental in plant's

ability to enforce successful defenses against invading
pathogens. In this study, several genes were identified that
are associated with biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.
The important enzymes in this category include phenyl
ammonia lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and chalcone-flavonone isomerase-1 which were
found in both compatible and incompatible interactions.
These enzymes are known to modulate plant defense
response against invading pathogens and insects [63,64].
Some of the secondary metabolism related genes, for
example, squalene epoxidase was found to be specific to
susceptible genotype whereas pterocarpan reductase and
oxysterol-binding family protein were specific to the
resistant one. Other members of this class are caffeic acid
O-methyltransferase II, isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase,
squalene monooxygenase 2, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase and dihydroflavonol reductase. Earlier studies
have shown that transgenic rice plants overexpressing
dihydroflavonol reductase can provide tolerance to biotic
and abiotic stresses [65]. Caffeic acid O-methyltransferase
catalyzes a key step in lignin biosynthesis [66], thereby
giving protection against pathogen attack.
Defense and stress responsive genes
Pathogen attack is often accompanied by the accumulation of elevated levels of transcripts of disease related proteins, the PR genes. The ESTs encoding proteins
implicated in stress and defense responses account for
3.18% of the total unigene set. Most dominant candidates
among the defense responsive genes were disease resistance response protein DRRG49C and PR10. Other genes
identified include those encoding chitinase, non-specific
lipid transfer proteins, thaumatin and pathogenesisrelated protein. The involvement of these proteins in
plant defense responses is well known [67]. One of the
important observations was that DRRG49C, thaumatin
and pathogenesis-related protein were expressed only
during incompatible interaction which may lead to
increased tolerance to pathogen attack. Also, we found the
presence of ESTs encoding proteins like dirigent and
harpin-induced 1 in the resistant genotype, implying their
role in pathostress response. Dirigent protein has recently
been shown to be involved in lignification and hence
imparting disease resistance [68]. Many other stress
induced proteins, for example, extensin, universal stress
proteins, aquaporin, annexin, cold acclimation responsive protein BudCAR4 and metallothionien were also
identified as more abundant in the resistant genotype
implicating their involvement in pathostress response
besides their key role in abiotic and other stresses [69,70].
Comparison with other legume genome and EST databases
To investigate how many of the chickpea ESTs from this
study are highly orthologous to other legume ESTs, we
performed a comparative analysis of our CaEST dataset to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/415

publicly available dataset comprising ESTs from Arachis
hypogea, Cajanus cajan, Pisum sativum, Robinia pseudoacacia, Lotus japonicus, Medicago trunculata, Glycine max and
Phaseolus vulgaris. Except Phaseolus and Robinia, these databases were inclusive of root ESTs. The highest number of
common orthologous ESTs was found to be present in
Pisum sativum, although, Cajanus cajan and Arachis hypogea
also showed higher similarity with CaUnigenes. The percentage of chickpea ESTs that matched to Pisum sativum
was 88.8% and 79.43% at DNA sequence identity of 
80% and 90%, respectively. A total of 87.6% and 83%
Cajanus cajan ESTs and 85.89% and 55.54% of Arachis
ESTS were common with CaUnigenes. Chickpea and
Pisum show close phylogenetic affliations, both being
representatives of galegoid, a group of cool season legumes [71] and is reflected in their sequence similarities.
However, high sequence similarity with Arachis and Cajanus came as a surprise since these legumes are phylogenetically distant relatives of Cicer and belong to tropical
season legumes (phaseoloid). The comparative analysis of
chickpea ESTs with that of Glycine max showed homology
of 80.32% and 31.54%. Interestingly, Medicago and Lotus
showed more divergent trend with only 58.02% and
30.50% and 43.31% and 14.25% ESTs respectively, having counterpart in CaUnigene set. A recent phylogenetic
study based on penalized likelihood analysis [72] indicated that Medicago, Lotus and Cicer are closer and fall in
the same galegoid clade, however, the divergence/difference in the pattern of ESTs may be attributed to the fact
that gene expression is shaped by cellular environment
besides ecological niche of the corresponding organism.
Chickpea ESTs showed lesser homology with Robinia pseudoacacia and was about 12% and 3.92% at DNA sequence
identity of 80% and 90%, respectively. This can be due to
the fact that Robinia is a perennial tree while chickpea is
an annual herb. Detailed comparative analysis of ESTs is
shown in Table 3. Thus the current study documents substantial conservation as well as genome divergence
amongst legume crops and in future can facilitate cross
species analysis of gene function.
Identification of chickpea specific transcripts and
enrichment of CaEST
In an attempt to identify the genotype-specific transcript
signatures in chickpea, we performed a blast analysis of
CaUnigene. Of the total 2013 CaUnigenes, about 18.22%
sequences that belong to NSH group represented potential chickpea specific sequences. To verify whether these
sequences were indeed chickpea specific, TBLASTX was
used for comparing them to the EST_others database.
Nearly 64% of the NSH class of CaEST dataset did not
show any significant match thereby confirming that these
ESTs represent unique chickpea sequences. Thus this dataset represents 234 novel chickpea specific ESTs, which
were never reported earlier. Further, we compared our

TBLASTX with e-value cutoff of 10-10 showed that 532 unigenes from the CaUnigene set of 2013 had a significant
match, while the remaining 1483 did not have any counterpart. Thus, 73.67% of our CaUnigenes represent new
chickpea genes yet unidentified. Full length sequencing of
these unigenes and their expression analyses may provide
further insight into the species-specific functions of these
genes.
Comparative stress responsive transcriptome reveals
canonical and non-canonical genes
Although a number of studies have catalogued stressresponsive genes against different environmental conditions into various functional classes, comparative genomics of stress-responsive transcriptome is still lacking. To
investigate the comparative biology of stress-responsive
transcriptome at organismal level with the currently available data, we compared the CaUnigenes with previously
reported stress-responsive genes from other organisms.
We classified genes known to be involved in multi-stress
responses as ubiquitous, while those found to be specific
to Fusarium infection were categorized as canonical. All
other genes, which have never been implicated in any
stress, were designated as noncanonical (Figure 3A). We
found that around 516 genes are ubiquitous, suggesting
broad similarities in stress responses across most of the
organisms and confirming cross communicating pathways playing role in different kinds of stresses. However,
only 41 genes were found to be canonical all of which
showed an overlap with ubiquitous class. A significantly
large number of genes (649) were found to be noncanonical. This difference in the pattern of immune-responsive
root transcriptome may be attributed to the fact that the
gene expression in an organism is shaped by the cellular
environment and the epigenetic factors. Metabolism was

one of the most abundant functional class in all the three
groups (Figure 3B), suggesting that any stress response
results in the alteration of the metabolic pathways of an
organism. A few of the metabolic enzymes found to be
expressed in response to multiple stresses represented in
the ubiquitous category included S-adenosylmethionine
decarboxylase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, and copper amine
oxidase [38,73-75]. Cell signaling related genes also
formed an important class that included leucine-rich
repeat receptor-like kinase and multiple bridging factor
among others [76,77]. As expected, many canonical genes
belonged to functional class of cellular redox, defense and
signaling; included Cationic peroxidase 2, chitinase and
14-3-3 protein [78]. Our data on immune responsive transcriptome and comparative analysis thereof provide evidence for molecular diversity vs. commonality in gene
expression profile at organismal level. The comparative

Page 9 of 21

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:415

analysis revealed few canonical genes, several ubiquitous
genes across different stresses while most of the genes
were found to be non-cannonical. An interesting observation was that apart from metabolism, most of the noncanonical genes belonged to the functional classes of
translation, posttranslational modifications, transcription, and signaling suggesting the occurrence of new, yet
undiscovered immune response pathways. This study
thus provides a comprehensive catalogue of non-canonical immune responsive genes or might suggest their species specificity with new insight into their identity and
function.
Identification of gene families
To assign CaUnigenes from this study to putative gene
families, we used single linkage clustering. The individual
contigs and singletons were combined into a single dataset which was then compared to itself using TBLASTX with
an e-value cutoff of 1e-15. Sequences with overlapping
BLAST reports were assigned to a putative gene family.
Altogether, we identified 209 gene families ranging in size
from 2 to 29 members (see Additional file 4). This analysis gives insights into following three areas: firstly, it identifies the genes that are likely to cross hybridize during the
microarray hybridizations. Secondly, it helps in assigning
possible function to genes that had no significant homology to known proteins or belonged to class of UF but clustered with proteins of known function. For example, gene
family 23 had two members of which one showed homology to CAP protein while the other showed homology to
hypothetical protein. Similarly, one of the members of
gene family 32 showed homology to cinnamoyl-CoA
reductase, while the other two belonged to NSH class.
Also, one member of gene family 124 showed homology
with phosphoesterase but the other did not have any significant match. Therefore, on the basis of the family to
which such genes either of NSH or UF belong, possible
function can be assigned to them and further verified by
comparing sequence alignment of these sequences with
representative members of the known gene family.
Thirdly, the identification of gene families provides a base
for uncovering and understanding the biological rationale
of functional novelty and partitioning following gene
duplications. Towards this, it was interesting to note that
in several cases the distribution of different members of
the same gene family varied between the genotypes. For
example, histone deacetylase HDT1 (contig212) was
found to be specific to susceptible genotype while the
other member of the same gene family represented by
contig713 was present only in the resistant genotype. This
was also the case with methionine sulfoxide reductase A,
where contig152 and contig555 were specific to susceptible and resistant genotypes respectively. Putative esterase

(contig454, CaF1_JIE_22_A_09) also showed the same
trend. This opens up a new area for finding out whether
presence of different gene family members leads to genotype specific response to a particular kind of stress.
Analysis of genotype-specific SNPs of chickpea
SNPs between genotypes/haplotypes once discovered are
extensively used for many applications for instance generation of very dense genetic maps, to construct the specific
genotypes required for quantitative genetic studies, to
enhance understanding of genome organization and
function and address fundamental questions relating to
evolution. SNPs can also be used for genome-wide linkage
disequilibrium and association studies that assign genes
to specific functions or traits. Furthermore, transcriptassociated SNPs can be used to develop allele-specific
assays for the examination of cis regulatory variation
within a species [79]. In the present study, SNPs were
identified between JG-62, a susceptible and WR-315, a
resistant genotype of chickpea to vascular wilt. A total of
279 contigs (28.67% of the total) contained at least one
sequence from both the genotypes and were mined for
potential SNPs. We identified 262 SNPs which were further classified into high and low quality SNPs depending
upon the number of sequences from each genotype showing the same base change (see Additional file 5). Highquality SNPs were confirmed by two or more sequences
from each genotype showing the same base change, while
low-quality SNPs were confirmed by one sequence from
one genotype and at least two from the other. Thus, we
identified 136 high-quality and 126 low-quality SNPs. In
the present analysis only base pair mutations were taken
into consideration and among these transitions (73.3%)
were more common than transversions (26.7%). Within
the transitions, occurrence of both adenine to guanine
and cytosine to thymidine base changes were found to be
almost equal. The maximum number of SNPs were
present in contigs that comprised of highly abundant
ESTs, for example, contig 722 represents the most abundant contig and maximum number of SNPs were present
in this contig. Similarly, contig 680 and 575 also had high
percentage of SNPs and were also very abundant as far as
total number of ESTs in these contigs is concerned.
Immune responsive gene networks in root transcriptome of
chickpea by microarray analysis
To study the transcriptional remodeling in immune
response during vascular wilt, we have developed cDNA
microarray using CaEST clones of the subtracted cDNA
libraries from susceptible and resistant genotypes. Root
tissue sample from WR-315 (resistant genotype) harvested at 24 h post Fusarium infection was used to evaluate
the expression profile during early phase of incompatible
interaction. We used indirect labeling of cDNAs following
TSA protocol that incorporates flourscein and biotin

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:415

labeled dUTP into the nascent cDNA from the target RNA
instead of Cy3 and Cy5 modified nucleotides since it is
known to negate any dye bias during the microarray
experiment [80-82]. The transcript level for each cDNA
was calculated as the average intensity of four data points
from duplicate spots of two replicate slides. We used a
fold cut off of 2.5 and Students t-test with P-value  0.05
ranking with false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing
corrections to identify differentially expressed genes. A
total of 257 differentially expressed unigenes were found
to be associated with the early signaling pathway, of
which 107 were induced and 150 repressed during incompatible interaction (see Additional file 6). Further, to identify co-expression kinetics amongst the differentially
expressed genes, we applied hierarchical clustering analysis to the transcriptome data set that grouped the genes in
two clusters based on their positive and negative fold
change. Cluster 1 represents repressed genes while cluster
2 comprised of genes induced at 24 h post Fusarium infection. Almost all the 23 functional classes are represented
in these two clusters but differed in the type of the representative genes and their relative abundance (Figure 4).
Moreover, the transcriptional response to immune sensitivity of genes involved in major biological processes and
molecular functions showed different dynamics within
repressed vs. induced gene clusters. The detailed expression level has been highlighted in additional file 6. The
repressed gene cluster is enriched for genes affecting translation, ribosome structure and biogenesis, while the
induced cluster is dominated by genes encoding hypothetical proteins, metabolism and miscellaneous groups.
Genes involved in metabolism GO category are over-represented in both cluster 1 and 2, but the magnitude of
over-representation is higher for cluster 1 than cluster 2.
UF, NSH and Miscellaneous categories notably formed a
major group of overrepresented genes.
Genes involved in translation, ribosome structure and
biogenesis form the largest functional category in cluster
1 that includes genes for ribosomal proteins, translation
initiation and elongation factors. Several genes encoding
proteins involved in post translational modifications and
protein turnover, for example, protein disufide isomeraselike protein and ubiquitin were also grouped in cluster 1.
Many of these genes have previously been implicated in
specific stresses in different organisms [83,84]. In the
repressed set of genes other major functional classes
included metabolism, hypothetical proteins, cellular
redox state and transcription. These include genes encoding cytochrome P450, thioredoxin, superoxide dismutase
and glutathione-S-transferase that are known to play critical role in plant stress [85-87]. Many carbohydrate
metabolism genes like GAPDH, triosephosphate isomerase and malate dehydrogenase precursor were downregulated. Earlier reports showed altered expression of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/415

GAPDH during plant stress [38], however the specific
function of this enzyme during stress is not known. Moreover GAPDH has also been known to act as an essential
component of transcriptional activator complex regulating histone expression [88]. We also observed defense
related genes like chitinase 1 and PR10, and secondary
metabolism genes like chalcone synthase and isoflavone
3'-hydroxylase to be repressed during Fusarium infection.
These genes are known to be associated with pathogen
stress [63,64].
In contrary, genes encoding hypothetical proteins, metabolism and miscellaneous groups form the dominant functional class in cluster 2. The induced set of metabolic
genes include some carbohydrate metabolism genes like
ADH1, FBF, aldolase and pfkB-type carbohydrate kinase
family protein of carbohydrate metabolism and oleate
desaturase involved in lipid metabolism. The role of these
enzymes in plant immunity has not yet been defined and
hence will be of great interest in future. Post-translational
modification and protein turnover related genes like
cystatin, Sec61beta and ubiquitin extension protein were
also induced consistent with the notion that damaged or
partially denatured proteins need to be degraded to prevent the accumulation of protein aggregates. Many such
genes are involved in regulating protein metabolism in
response to stress [89,90]. Other cell stress induced genes
include classical phenylpropanoid pathway genes like
chalcone reductase and chalcone--flavonone isomerase 1.
Role played by these genes during cell defense is a well
known phenomenon [64]. Many signaling related genes
like serine/threonine protein kinase, leucine-rich repeat
transmembrane protein kinase to name a few were
induced attesting their role in plant defense.
More than thirty percent of the repressed and induced
gene clusters represented NSH and hypothetical proteins
those do not have known cellular roles, these can now be
annotated as being involved in immune response pathway.
Expression analysis of selected ESTs by RNA blot analysis
To confirm the differential expression of immune-responsive genes, four highly abundant genes in our CaEST dataset showing induced gene expression were selected for
RNA blot analysis. The results showed that all four ESTs
had a strong induction in root tissue at 24 h post infection
and the level of gene expression corroborated to that of
microarray analyses (Figure 5, see Additional file 6). The
genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase and pfkB-type
kinase, showed a very high expression suggesting that the
carbohydrate metabolic pathways are altered in response
to vascular wilt. A disease resistance response gene for
defense signaling also showed upregulation indicating its
role in immune response. The expression level of a fungal

gene FOXY, found to be highly adundant both in susceptible and resistant genotypes was consistent with that of
microarray data. This gene encodes a transposable element and its induction during plant-pathogen interaction
is of interest for the study of such elements and their
involvement in immunity vs. disease.

Discussion
EST sequencing is likely to make its greatest impact on
understudied genomes where full genome sequence
projects may not be undertaken in near future. Although

as of February, 2009 GenBank contained over 45,71,266
entires for the ESTs from plants, most publicly available
ESTs are derived from different organs and developmental
stages, while the species-specific EST dataset, let alone the
genotype-specific ESTs are negligible. Very recently, the
focus has been given towards the SNP and copy number
variation as a basis for species specific genomic signatures.
A recent study in Arabidopsis has revealed one million
SNPs in a total population comprising different ecotypes
[91]. Further, 78,373 in rice and 65,83,583 in humans
were found to be associated with the coding sequences,

fact that responses in the susceptible and resistant genotypes to pathogen stress are largely quantitative and kinetically controlled. It is known that resistant genotype
shows immediate response upon pathogen infestation
which is of high amplitude, in contrarary, the susceptible
genotype shows late response [92]. Further, among the
entire set of ESTs, 40% represented the sequences of hypothetical proteins or unknown proteins or showed no significant homology to the previously identified genes or
proteins in the NCBI database. These ESTs may represent
unique chickpea sequences. It is of interest that the Fusarium infection of chickpea causes substantial changes in
the expression of numerous unknown transcripts yet to
assign a cellular function.

SNP/. The regulation of gene expression is an important
mechanism, which controls cellular processes and it is
conceivable that the functional transcripts resulted from a
controllable transcription and posttranscriptional processes may shape the specificity at genotype/haplotype
level.
In an attempt to understand the molecular basis of
immune response in chickpea during vascular wilt, the
transcriptional changes were monitored by EST sequencing approach. The sequences reported in this study have
enriched the collection of ESTs in this food legume which
would form a basis in our understanding of plant metabolism, development and adaptation to pathogen stress.
These data are particularly important, at least in part, due
to the fact that there are only 7464 chickpea EST
sequences available currently in the NCBI database and
we have doubled the number. This would broaden the
current chickpea database for further functional studies.
Although a large percentage of ESTs (46.27%) was common to both the susceptible and resistant genotypes, a significant percentage of ESTs was specific to each of them.
The percentage of unigenes specific to susceptible genotype was 19.16%, while that of resistant genotype was
34.56% (Figure 1) indicating the possible divergence in
immune signaling pathways. The occurrence of almost the
double the number of ESTs in the resistant genotype as
compared to the susceptible one may be attributed to the

Comparative abundance of ESTs in resistant and
susceptible genotypes
Analysis of EST frequency comprising a contig and the
source of the contig provides an insight with respect to the
spatial expression level and biochemical functions even
without subsequent microarray analysis. In most of the
cases and within statistical limitations [93], the abundance of a specific transcript in the EST dataset serves as a
measure of gene expression. Therefore, we identified and
compared relative abundance of ESTs in different contigs
to unravel the transcript signatures, which might determine the genotype-specific immune response. Contigs
having ESTs from a single genotype were designated as
specific. Of the 973 contigs, 433 were found to be specific
to the resistant genotype, 261 to the susceptible genotype,
and 279 contigs represented both the genotypes. While
looking at the abundance of ESTs, we observed that the
genes involved in the pathways that could be employed in
cell defense, were represented more in resistant genotype
than susceptible one. In this context, the gene encoding
transaldolase that is involved in pentose phosphate pathway was found to be associated with the resistant genotype. Expression of this gene may be explained to the
possible need of NADPH required for biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites like PR proteins. Similar was
the case with enolase, a glycolytic enzyme, involved in the
formation of phosphoenol pyruvate, which contributes to
the formation of aromatic amino acids via shikimic acid
pathway [94]. Aromatic amino acids act as primary substrates for phenylpropanoid pathway. Many genes
involved in phenylpropanoid pathway, for example, chalcone reductase, chalcone synthase, and isoflavone reductase were more abundant in resistant genotype. These are
canonical genes well known for their definitive role in
defense pathways [66,67]. Many other stress related genes
were also found to be more abundant in resistant genotype. Some of the examples are putative imbibition protein, aquaporin, and DNAJ-like protein. Although
aquaporin is known to be induced in response to abiotic
stresses [95] its role in patho-stress remains to be investi-

gated. Plant pathogenesis related genes like cationic peroxidase, disease resistance related protein DRRG 49C,
pathogen and wound-inducible antifungal protein CBP20
and pathogenesis related protein were also represented
more in the resistant genotype. Cationic peroxidase has
been shown to be associated with incompatible plantpathogen interaction [96]. It is known that ECM/cell wall
modifying enzymes play important role against invading
pathogens. Genes encoding many such enzymes, for
example, callose synthase was present in the resistant genotype. Furthermore, brassinosteroid regulated protein,
BRU1 was present more in the resistant genotype.
Domain search of BRU1 showed that it has xyloglucan
endotransglycosylase activity and is involved in cell wall
remodeling. Selenium binding proteins were found to be
more abundant in the incompatible genotype suggesting
their possible role in imparting plant disease resistance.
Studies have shown that overexpression of a homologue
of mammalian selenium binding protein in rice results in
enhanced resistance to blast fungus and bacterial blight
[97]. Nonaspanin, an endomembrane protein, involved
in intracellular vesicular trafficking was present specifically in the resistant genotype. Further, presence of ESTs
encoding proteins like narbonin, cupin domain protein
and AKIN gamma specifically in the resistant genotype is
indicative of their possible role in pathogen stress. While
narbonin is known to be a seed storage protein [98],
cupin domain proteins have diverse functional roles in
seed germination, seedling development and modification of cell wall carbohydrates [99], however, their role in
pathogen stress is yet to be elucidated.
It was intriguing that most of the genes reported, earlier,
to be involved in auxin signaling pathway were specific to
susceptible genotype, thereby suggesting a possible role of
auxin signalling in compatible plant-pathogen interaction. Such genes included auxin-induced putative aldo/
keto reductase family protein, aux/IAA protein and putative auxin-induced protein. However, auxin responsive
SAUR protein was present in both the genotypes but with
a much higher frequency in susceptible one. Auxin-regulated dual specificity cytosolic kinase was the only auxinresponsive gene found in the resistant genotype. A contemporary study has suggested the involvement of auxin
signaling pathway in the susceptibility of a plant to pathogen attack [100]. Many other ESTs were also found to be
more redundant in susceptible genotype. These include
ESTs encoding chlorophyll a/b binding protein, cystatin
and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) aminotransferase. Cystatin belongs to cysteine proteinase inhibitor
superfamily and has been reported to have antifungal
activity [89]. BCAA aminotransferase serves in detoxification mechanism that maintains the pool of free branched
chain amino acids at low and non toxic levels under dehydration [101]. Fusarium grows in the vascular system of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/415

the plant and the mycelial growth of the fungus may cause
blockage of vascular tissue, which mimics the symptoms
of dehydration and therefore, may lead to the accumulation of BCAA aminotransferase. Interestingly, we found
many genes that have never been implicated in plant
stress response, for example, deoxyhypusine synthase
(DHS), which was found to be present in the susceptible
genotype. Recent studies have shown that the silencing of
DHS delays ripening in tomato [102]. Ripening often
leads to weakening of cell wall and by doing so it may predispose a plant to pathogen attack. Of very highly abundant contigs with total number of ESTs exceeding 20,
thereby inferring their strong role in stress response, we
found that genes encoding putative extensin, putative
senescence-associated protein and RNA-binding region
RNP-1 were more abundant in resistant genotype. On the
other hand, genes encoding pfkB-type carbohydrate
kinase known to be involved in preservation of intracellular adenylate pools and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 were
more abundant in the susceptible genotype.
Next, it was of interest to find out the relationship
between the genotype specific EST abundance with their
expression pattern during incompatible interaction. Comparison of microarray expression data with the origin of
the respective genes revealed the following three types of
correlations. Firstly, genes specific to or more abundant in
the resistant genotype like those encoding chalcone
reductase, DRRG 49C, cytochrome P450, cytochrome
P450 monooxygenase CYP83G1, peroxidase, putative
kinetochore protein, GOS11 and serine/threonine kinase
showed induction during incompatible plant pathogen
interaction. Secondly, genes which were represented only
in the susceptible genotype did not show any significant
expression in the incompatible interaction. These
included drought responsive element binding protein,
Calcium-binding EF-hand, Targeting for Xklp2 and Protein kinase TonB box. Thirdly, many genes which were
either absent or represented to a lesser extent in the resistant genotype but abundant in the susceptible one were
found to be downregulated and included putative ripening related protein, putative ADP, ATP carrier-like protein,
probable pyridoxal biosynthesis protein PDX1 and triosephosphate isomerase.
Identification of putative new regulators of plant immune
response
Although biological processes including immune
response are controlled by intricate regulatory networks of
gene expression that is thought to be regulated by many
regulatory genes, only few such genes have been reported
till date. While exploring the gene expression patterns during chickpea-Fusarium interactions, we identified several
novel regulatory genes specifically showing differential
expression of transcripts, which strongly suggests putative

functions for them in plant immune response. These
include ESTs encoding putative protein kinase APK1A,
SAR DNA-binding protein-1, BEL1-like homeodomain
transcription factor, NAC domain containing protein,
RabGAP/TBC and GTP-binding protein. Protein kinase
cascades are critical for regulating plant defense systems
against various kinds of pathogens and operate as efficient
signal transmission networks linking extracellular stimuli
with intracellular targets. The upregulation of APK1
strongly suggests its possible role in defense signaling.
This protein was identified in Arabidopsis, however, its
role has not yet been identified [103]. The expression of
BEL1 and SAR DNA-binding protein-1 was found to be
downregulated. BEL transcription factor plays role in pattern formation in ovules [104], SAR DNA binding protein
is known to have multifunctional roles in chromatin
organisation and ribosome biogenesis [105] while NAC
domain protein is implicated in developmental processes.
Thus, it will be of great interest to elucidate their role in
plant immunity. The expression of RabGAP/TBC and
GTP-binding protein was induced at 24 h after Fusarium
infection suggesting their possible involvement in plant
defense. A gene of RabGAP class has been shown to be
involved in spermatogenesis in rats [106], however, there
is no report regarding their role in immune response.
These results support the existence of different regulatory
systems that operates in vascular wilt inducible root specific immune gene expression during plant defense. This
divergence may be attributed to the specific interaction of
a host to one of the specific pathogen of many that it
encounters.

Conclusion
Genetic make up of any organism results from a subset of
genes that it inherits. The regulated expression of genes is
tightly controlled and shaped by the transcription
machinery of the cell. Therefore, development of genotype dependent organ specific kinetically controlled functional ESTs, identification of gene families and their
associated transcriptomic and proteomic studies would
reveal more and more yet unidentified sense and antisense transcripts; and transcript associated SNPs. This
approach would essentially unravel the molecular basis of
specificity at individual level that ultimately dictates the
cellular physiology leading to the phenome variation.
Our study is directed towards creating a gene resource
(CaEST database) of chickpea for the systematic analysis
of genotype-dependent organ-specific stimuli-responsive
gene signatures that would provide an initial platform for
gene discovery and functional genomics of this third most
important but understudied food legume. This approach
may be used in future to dissect diverse and overlapping
biochemical pathways encompassed by the identified
transcripts at individual level. This will also be important

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/415

in long-term efforts to develop faithful, quantitative models for plant processes. The efficiency of subtracted genotype specific immune responsive EST sequencing is
especially reflected in the number of new genes identified
in this study, which is still moderate in size. A total of
2013 unigenes are reported that characterize the immune
responsive transcripts of this important legume, of which
approximately twelve percent represent new chickpea
genes hitherto undiscovered. Our discovery of a large
number of SNPs in expressed sequences should allow the
genetic mapping of many genes underlying agricultural
characteristics in chickpea. Although WR315 and JG62
may be presumably quite similar to one another at the
nucleotide sequence level, we find they are equally different to each other in their transcript profile. In addition,
the use of this approach in our present study led to the
identification of 807 genes of unknown function now
assigned to the immune response pathway with an organ
specific localization, opens up a new area of investigation
wherein the combining of our CaUnigene dataset with
other databases can be used to draw relationships at system level. The results identified a set of 649 non-cannonical stress responsive genes which has never been
associated with immune response. Further, homology
search of the derived amino acid sequence data from the
present study provides a firm indication of a number of
components of the root to which function is still to be
ascribed. The ESTs identified in this study represent the
major attempt so far to define chickpea transcriptome.
The microarray analysis of immune-responsive transcriptome uncovers new regulators of host-pathogen interaction. Assigning a functional role to each of these new
immune regulators will be challenging and quite valuable
in order to know the physiological significance of plant
immunity. Nevertheless, the sequence information of
chickpea is unavailable and the number of functionally
annotated ESTs is low at this time, as this number
increases, the transcriptome data will be proven even
more useful. The recent identification of immune responsive genes from other organisms would eventually lead to
develop a comparative species-specific immune responsive transcriptome in which this report becomes one of
the first attempts. This is an initial attempt in the direction
that will be expanded upon during future transcriptomic
studies of plant processes. Our future efforts will focus
onto enriching CaUnigene database and increasing the
number of analyzed genes thereof, with an aim to draw a
complete functional map of organ specific stimuli responsive transcriptome at individual level. Further, we will
focus onto identifying the dynamics associated with the
organ specific transcriptome towards cells metabolic and
regulatory pathways at different physiological conditions
shaping the phenome diversity.

Methods
Plant material and in planta infection
The chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) seeds were sterilized with
70% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl2 followed by repetitive
washing in autoclaved water. The seedlings were grown in
sterile conditions in glass tubes containing MS basal
medium solidified with 0.6% agar in an environmentally
controlled growth room and maintained at 25 ± 2°C, 50
± 5% relative humidity under 16 h photoperiod (270
mol m-2 s-1 light intensity). Fusarium oxysporum ciceri race
1 was grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 28°C. The
3-week old seedlings were inoculated with Fusarium spore
suspension at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml while the
control plants were treated with water. Root and collar
(root and shoot junction) tissue was sampled as experimental material, harvested at 6, 12, 24, 48 h and 5 days
after inoculation and stored at -80°C after quick-freezing
in liquid nitrogen.
Construction of cDNA libraries
Two suppression subtracted cDNA libraries were constructed, one from a susceptible (JG-62) and the other
from a resistant (WR-315) genotype using PCR select
cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech, CA). Total RNA was isolated by GITC method as described earlier [107] from
uninfected seedlings (used as driver) and Fusarium
infected seedlings (used as tester) collected at different
time points as mentioned above and subsequently combined. The poly (A)+ RNA from the pooled total RNA was
purified by using Dyna beads oligo (dT) (Dynal biotech,
USA). The cDNAs were cloned into pGEMT vector
(Promega, Wisconsin) and transformed into E. coli cells
(DH5Í). The individual clones were picked up and grown
in deep well plates in 2× YT media containing ampicillin
(75 g/ml) at 37°C for 16-18 hours under shaking at 250
rpm. All individual clones were stored in 96 well U bottom plates by mixing 220 l of grown culture and 30 l of
80% glycerol for long term storage.
Sequencing, processing and assembly of ESTs into contigs
Plasmid DNAs from both the subtracted cDNA libraries
were isolated and purified by Perfectprep Plasmid 96 Vac
Direct bind kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Eppendorf, Germany). The quality of the plasmid
DNAs was analyzed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis
and the good quality plasmids having appropriate DNA
concentration and free from any mix up were selected for
sequencing. The individual plasmids were sequenced
using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin
Elmer, Applied Biosystems) with M13 forward and reverse
primers for 5' and 3' single pass sequencing respectively,
in ABI Prism 3700 sequencer (Applied biosystems, CA).
Sequence base calls were made using Phred [108] with a
quality cutoff of 15. Vector filtering was performed using
the cross match program (P. Green, http://boze

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/415

man.mbt.Washington.edu/phrap.docs/phrap.html) followed by trimming of low quality sequences. The
sequences were individually inspected for chimeras, short
reads, E. coli and mitochondrial sequences which were
subsequently removed. The processed ESTs with 100
bases or longer were assembled into contigs by CAP3 programme using standard parameters [20]. The final assembly of contigs and singletons constituted the chickpea
gene index. All EST sequences have been submitted to
GenBank [GenBank: GR911733 to GR918004].
Blast analysis, annotation and comparison
The EST contig and singleton sequences were annotated
for homology using BLASTX and BLASTN algorithms
against non redundant protein and nucleotide databases
respectively. For BLASTX, an e-value cut-off of 10-15 was
used and the sequences with e-value below this cutoff
were then subjected to BLASTN analysis with e-value cutoff of 10-20. In addition, BLASTN was used to compare the
chickpea sequences from this study to a database of legume sequences. This database included sequences of Lotus
japonicus (gene index release 3.0); Medicago trunculata
(gene index release 8.0); Glycine max (gene index release
12.0) and Phaseolus vulgaris (gene index release 1.0) from
The Institute for genomic Research (TIGR; Quackenbush
et al, 2001) and Arachis hypogea, Cajanus cajan, Pisum sativum and Robinia pseudoacacia available from NCBI taxonomy browser http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/
taxonomyhome.html. The following criteria were used in
stand-alone BLASTN comparison: (1) exact match bp =
11; (2) e-value  10-5 and (3) DNA identity  80% and
90%. Further, TBLASTX (with e-value cutoff of 10-15) was
used for comparing chickpea sequences to GenBank's
EST_others database for the identification of chickpea specific sequences. Sequences were additionally functionally
characterized in the context with the Gene Ontology
(GO), Metacyc and COG. Cross species comparison of
stress responsive transcriptome was carried out by searching each gene of unigene set against all classes of the stress
responsive gene entries in the GO database http://
www.geneontology.org. Genes which had a match in
more than one group of stress responsive genes were categorized as ubiquitous and those which were earlier known
to be involved in Fusarium stress as found from the fungal
responsive group in the GO database were categorised as
canonical. Remaining of the genes which did not show
any match in any of the stress responsive gene groups in
the GO database were classified as non canonical.
Identification of gene families using single-linkage
clustering
In order to identify gene families, the chickpea contigs
and singletons were combined into a single dataset.
TBLASTX with e-value cutoff of 10-15 was used to compare
the dataset against itself. Sequences with at least one

Page 16 of 21

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:415

sequence in common in their BLAST reports were combined into a putative gene family as described. [109].
Identification of SNPs
For the identification of SNPs, the ace file output of CAP3
programme was used as input to the PolyBayes SNP detection program along with the base values assigned by
Phred for each of the contigged sequences. Perl scripts
were used to parse the PolyBayes output file. The cutoff
value for the probability of SNP was put at 0.99. Only base
change mutations were considered in order to avoid any
discrepancy in the results due to any error in the alignment. The SNPs were further divided into high-quality if
minimum of two sequences from each genotype showed
the same base change and low-quality if minimum of two
sequences from one genotype and one from the other
showed the same base change.

cDNAs were mixed and hybridized to the microarray
slides in hybridization chambers (Corning, USA) at 65°C
water bath for 16 hours. The slides were washed for 10
minutes in 0.5× SSC and 0.01%SDS, 10 minutes in 0.06×
SSC and 0.01%SDS and for 5 minutes in 0.06× SSC. The
slides were subsequently processed for replacement of
flourscein with Cy3 and biotin with Cy5 as per manufacturer's instructions. The experiment was carried out in
duplicate.

Construction of cDNA microarray
The cDNA microarray setup consisted of 8098 probes corresponding to 2013 unigenes. The cDNA clones from
both susceptible and resistant libraries were amplified by
performing colony PCR (1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5
units Taq DNA polymerase [Applied biosystems, USA],
0.5 mM dNTPs [Fermentas, Canada], 0.2 M M13 primer
[Sigma], 20 ng of template DNA) in 96 well format. The
PCR amplified products were purified using Perfectprep
PCR clean up kit as per manufacturer's instructions
(Eppendorf, Germany). The quality of the PCR products
was checked on 1.0% agarose gels. Five microlitres of the
PCR products were reorganized on the 384-well printing
plates with 5 l of 100% DMSO and printed in duplicates
on the poly-L-lysine coated slides (Sigma) using a high
throughput arrayer (Arrayer ESI, SDDC2) followed by UV
cross linking. The spiking and other controls such as
DMSO, SSC, water and previously cloned chickpea genes
like 18S rRNA and actin were also printed at different
locations in the chickpea microarray which were used as
negative and positive controls.

Scanning and data analysis
Micraoarrays were scanned using Scan array 5000 scanner
(PerkinElmer, MA) to produce two separate tiff images.
Spot finding and quantification of the spots were done by
using Scan array express software (PerkinElmer, MA).
Spots appearing bad due to poor morphology, high local
background and bubbles were flagged off and were
excluded from further analysis. Spots with both channel
intensities less than 500 were also filtered out. Spots were
quantified using an adaptive method. Avadis software
(PerkinElmer, MA) was used for further data transformation which consisted of background correction and normalization. For background correction, local background
intensity of each spot was subtracted from its foreground
intensity value. Due to non linearity of the data, intensity
dependent Lowess normalization was applied. Cy5/Cy3
signal ratio was also calculated. Although, indirect TSA
labeling was performed to generate the flourscent labeled
probe that obviates the need for control dye swap experiments, initially dye swap experiment was performed for
checking the reciprocity of the gene signals that showed
high correlation between the original and dye swap slides.
Cross slide one class t-test with Benjamini and Horchberg
FDR multiple correction was performed on the four replicate data points for each clone. P-value of 0.05 and fold
induction of 2.5 was used as a limit for statistically significant differences in the expression. The resulting differentially expressed gene list was uploaded for hierarchical
clustering.

Sample preparation, labeling and microarray
hybridization
In order to find out the differential gene expression during
chickpea-Fusarium incompatible interaction, root tissue
sample were collected from Fusarium infected WR 315
seedlings after 24 h of infection. Water treated WR 315
plants were taken as control. Two biological replicates
were done. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, CA). 6 g of the total RNA was used for cDNA
synthesis using indirect TSA labeling and detection kit
Micromax (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA). The RNA isolated
from uninfected and infected tissue was labeled with
flourscein and biotin, respectively. The labeled cDNA was
purified using microcon YM 100 columns (Millipore,
Bedford, MA). The purified flourscein and biotin labeled

RNA gel blots
Validation of the microarray results was done by northern
analysis of a few transcripts. For this, total RNA was
extracted from root tissue of water treated and Fusarium
challenged plants collected at 24 hours after treatment
using trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 20 g of RNA was denatured in 50% formamide, 17% formaldehyde, and 10%
MOPS buffer (200 mM MOPS, pH7.0, 50 mM sodium
acetate and 1 mM EDTA) at 65°C for 5 min and was separated on 1.2% agarose gel containing 22 M formaldehyde in MOPS buffer, transferred to GenScreen plus
membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences) by
downward capillary blotting in 20× SSC. The DNA probes
were prepared by random primer labeling and purified by
passing through Sephadex G-50 column as described in

Sambrook et al., 2001 [105]. After 2 hrs of prehybridization in 0.3 M Nacl, 5% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate
and 1% SDS, at 42°C, the radiolabeled probe was added
and hybridization was carried out at the same temperature
for 16-18 h. After stringent washing, the blot was exposed
to X ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY).
