Abstract
The leech Myzobdella lugubris is widespread in the Lake Erie Watershed, especially Lake St. Clair.
However, its role in pathogen transmission is not fully understood. In this same watershed, several
widespread fish mortalities associated with the Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSV) were
recorded. Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia is an emerging disease in the Great Lakes Basin that is
deadly to the fish population, yet little is known about its mode of transmission. To assess the
potential role of M. lugubris in VHSV transmission, leeches were collected from Lake St. Clair and
Lake Erie and pooled into samples of five. Cell culture and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) were used to determine the presence of the virus and its identity. Results
showed that 57 of the 91 pooled leech samples were positive by cell culture for VHSV and 66 of
the 91 pooled leech samples were positive by RT-PCR for the VHSV. Two representative virus
isolates were sequenced for further genetic confirmation and genotype classification. VHSV
detected within M. lugubris was homologous to the Great Lakes strain of VHSV genotype IVb. This
is the first record of the VHSV being detected from within a leech, specifically M. lugubris, and
suggests the potential of M. lugubris being involved in VHSV transmission.

Findings
The Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV), genotype IVb, is a recent invader to the Great Lakes Basin
(GLB) and has been associated with mortalities in a
number of freshwater fish species [1-4]. These recent
widespread mortality events in the GLB have raised questions concerning potential routes of virus transmission.
Certain leech species have been incriminated as potential
vectors for fish viruses, such as, Piscicola salmositica for
Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus in the sockeye
salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka Walbaum [5] and P. geometra
for Spring Viraemia of Carp Virus in the case of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus [6]. In a previous

study, the leech population in Lake St. Clair, Michigan
was found to be dominated by Myzobdella lugubris Leidy,
1851 (Rhynchobdellida: Piscicolida) [Schulz CA, Thomas
MV, Fitzgerald S, Faisal M: Leeches (Annelida:
Hirudinea) Parasitizing Fish of Lake St. Clair, Michigan.
Submitted]. Myzobdella lugubris is an intermittent, haematophagous feeder, with an extraordinary wide host range
[7-9] and therefore it is a good candidate leech to contribute to pathogen spread among susceptible host species. In
this study we collected attached M. lugubris from fish collected from two sites in the Lake Erie watershed, where
VHSV Type IVb was first isolated, and subsequent fish
mortalities have taken place over the last few years [1].

Leeches were collected on five separate dates, within the
months of May and June 2008, from a site in Anchor Bay,
Lake St. Clair (42°37'54.60"N, 82°45'54.60"W) and a
site
in
western
Lake
Erie
(41°46'00.74"N,
83°24'58.09"W) (Figure 1). Fish species from which M.
lugubris was collected included the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus Rafinesque), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus
grunniens R.), rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris R.), yellow
perch (Perca flavescens Mitchill), and walleye (Sander vitreus M). Due to the intermittent feeding nature of Myzobdella lugubris, samples collected during this study were not
separated according by fish species mentioned above or
by specific location.
Detached leeches were tentatively identified as M. lugubris
in the field and were stored in one liter bottles containing
lake water. Overall, 456 leeches were removed and
divided into 91 pools of ~five leeches. Leeches remained
alive until returned to the laboratory, where their identity
was confirmed as M. lugubris according to the accepted
morphological criteria [9,10]. Each leech was briefly
immersed into absolute ethanol for surface disinfection,
rinsed several times in sterile water, and then sectioned
into ~100 μg pieces. Samples were homogenized using a
Biomaster Stomacher (Wolf Laboratories Ltd, Pocklington, York, UK) at the high speed setting for 2 min and
then diluted with Earle's salt-based minimal essential

medium (MEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to produce a
1:4 dilution (w/v) of original tissues. Homogenized leech
contents were removed with a sterile transfer pipette, dispensed into a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 5500 rcf for 20 min in the IEC Multi RF
Centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).
Supernatants were immediately used for virus isolation.
Virus isolation was performed according to the standard
protocols detailed in the American Fisheries Society Blue
Book [11] and the OIE [12], using the Epithelioma papulosum cyprinii (EPC) cell line [13]. Inoculated 96-well plates
containing EPC cells grown with MEM (5% fetal bovine
serum) were incubated at 15°C for 7 days, and were
observed for the formation of cytopathic effects (CPE).
Second and third blind passages were performed and
assessed for the presence of VHSV.
Thirteen of the 91 pooled samples of leech homogenates
caused CPE on EPC in the form of focal areas of rounded,
refractile cells which progressed to full lysis of the cell
monolayer. When a second passage was performed on
negative samples, four additional samples exhibited CPE.
A third passage raised the number of positive samples to
57 out of 91 pools. It is possible that the virus was present
in higher titers in the samples which were positive in the
first passage of cell culture.

Figure gel
Agarose gel showing the bands from RT-PCR, used for the detection of VHSV (811 base pair). Pooled leech samples (#66, 69, 71, 75, 79, 80, 83-86, and 90) are representative VHSV-positive samples. The marker (M) used was 1.0 kb plus
(Invitrogen).

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was then performed on all positive and negative third passage pooled leech samples. Total RNA was extracted from
inoculated cells using a QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit.
Reverse transcription was accomplished by a two-step
protocol using the Affinity Script Multiple Temperature
Reverse Transcriptase RT-PCR™. The primer set used in
this assay was recommended by the Office de International Epizootics for detection of a 811 base pair sequence
of the VHSV nucleocapsid (N) gene: 5'-GGG GAC CCC
AGA CTG T-3' (forward primer) and 5'-TCT CTG TCA CCT
TGA TCC-3' (reverse primer) [12]. Amplicons of 811 base
pairs were amplified in 66 out of the 91 samples (Figure
2), including 56 out of the 57 cell culture positive samples, as well as ten additional samples that never formed
CPE on EPC. Also, sample #65, which produced CPE on
EPC, was negative by RT-PCR. After initial detection of
VHSV Type IVb via RT-PCR, additional confirmation of
positive samples was performed by the United States
Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services
Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.
The RT-PCR products of two representative VHSV-positive
samples were purified with the Promega Wizard® SV Gel
and PCR Clean-up System and were then submitted to the
MSU Research Technology Support Facility. The two
sequences were aligned by BL2SEQ [14] and the aligned
contig was used for multiple alignments performed by
ClustalW [15]. The phylogenetic analysis of the VHSV
leech strain with 19 nucleoprotein encoding genes from
other species of rhabdovirus was done by using bootstrap
test of phylogeny in MEGA 4 [16]. The Neighbor-Joining
algorithm was chosen to create the phylogenetic dendrogram containing 1000 bootstrap samplings.

the VHSV IVb-MI03 strain, the index strain of the Great
Lakes VHSV (GenBank:DQ427105).
Our findings shed light on the potential role leeches may
play in VHSV transmission. While this study does not confirm that Myzobdella lugubris does indeed transmit the
virus to susceptible hosts, this is the first time that VHSV
(of any genotype) has been isolated from leeches, or other
invertebrates. Myzobdella lugubris is an intermittent, generalist species; therefore the detection of VHSV within M.
lugubris may pose a threat to VHSV-susceptible host species, not only in the Great Lakes basin, but also in other
watersheds to which infected M. lugubris may be transferred.
