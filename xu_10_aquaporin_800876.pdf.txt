Aquaporin 1, a potential therapeutic target for
migraine with aura
Guang-Yin Xu1,2, Fen Wang1, Xinghong Jiang1, Jin Tao1*

Abstract
The pathophysiology of migraine remains largely unknown. However, evidence regarding the molecules participating in the pathophysiology of migraine has been accumulating. Water channel proteins, known as aquaporins
(AQPs), notably AQP-1 and AQP-4, appears to be involved in the pathophysiology of several neurological diseases.
This review outlines newly emerging evidence indicating that AQP-1 plays an important role in pain signal transduction and migraine and could therefore serve as a potential therapeutic target for these diseases.
Introduction
Migraine is a chronic, paroxysmal, neurovascular disorder that can start at any age, and affects up to 6% of
males and 18% of females in the general population [1].
Two major forms of migraine exist: migraine without
aura and migraine with aura. An often debilitating, unilateral, throbbing headache typically characterizes
attacks of migraine without aura. This type of headache
which may last 4 to 72 hours is aggravated by physical
activity, and is accompanied by autonomic symptoms
such as vomiting, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia [2]. However, the attack may also be preceded by
premonitory symptoms (prodrome) in some patients. In
one third of migraineurs, the headache phase is preceded or accompanied by transient focal symptoms of
neurologic aura (migraine with aura). These are usually
visual but may also involve sensory disturbances, speech
difficulties, and motor symptoms [1].
Much progress has now been made in elucidating the
mechanisms underlying the aura and headache phases
of migraine attacks [3]. The migraine aura is thought to
be caused by “cortical spreading depression” (CSD), a
wave of intense neuronal activity that slowly progresses
over the cortex and is followed by a period of neuronal
inactivity. Elevated extracellular levels of potassium and
glutamate might be crucial for the initiation and propagation of CSD. During the headache phase, activation of

the trigeminovascular system (TGVS) plays a crucial
role. The TGVS consists of the meningeal and superficial cortical blood vessels that are innervated by the trigeminal nerve, which projects into the trigeminal
nucleus caudalis in the brainstem, which in turn, projects to higher-order pain centers (Figure 1). Evidence
from animal experiments suggests that CSD might activate the TGVS, potentially linking the mechanisms for
aura and headache [3]. Although the mechanisms of the
aura and headache are relative well understood, hardly
is anything known about how migraine attacks are
initiated. Such knowledge is important to design effective, well-tolerated and prophylactic treatments. Genetic
factors may have the possibility to play an important
role in migraine by lowering the trigger threshold for
migraine attacks. Genetic research in the field of
migraines has mainly focused on the identification of
genes involved in familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), a
rare monogenic subtype of migraine with aura. The
main clinical reason for this validity is that the symptoms of aura and headache are similar, apart from the
hemiparesis associated with FHM, and that most
patients with FHM also have attacks of common
migraine [2]. Three genes for FHM have been identified:
CACNA1A (FHM1), encoding the pore-forming a1-subunit of voltage-gated neuronal Cav2.1 (P/Q-type)
calcium channels, ATP1A2 (FHM2), encoding the a2subunit of glial cell sodium-potassium (Na+-K+) pumps,
and SCN1A (FHM3), encoding the pore-forming a1subunit of voltage-gated neuronal Nav1.1 sodium channels [3-5]. With the identification of these genes, it
seems that the FHM- and likely other common types of

associated with the release of neurotransmitters and metabolites,
which are thought to be the underlying cause of the migraine aura.
These neurotransmitters may also activate perivascular trigeminal
nerve endings, resulting in activation of the trigeminovascular
system (TGVS), and subsequently, the trigeminal nucleus caudalis
(TNC), which conveys signals to the thalamus en route to the
somatosensory cortex. In addition, activation of the TGVS induces
meningeal neurogenic inflammation, which could result in the
central sensitization.

migraine- are disorders of disturbed ion transport, or
ionopathies, has gained increasing acceptance. However,
direct convincing evidence that the CACNA1A,
ATP1A2, or SCN1A gene is involved in common forms
of migraine is largely lacking. Moreover, the precise
mechanism by which these mutations cause FHM is
unknown currently. It is also not clear whether the
mutations represent a gain or loss of function. It is,
therefore, to identify new potential therapeutic targets
to gain insight into the triggering mechanisms of
migraine attacks.
Aquaporins (AQPs), a family of water channel proteins,
became a very hot area of research in biochemistry and
molecular cell biology, with increasing physiological, medical, and biotechnological implications. The characteristics,
tissue distribution, functions and some pathophysiological
implications of individual AQPs are briefly presented
below and references of detailed reviews on each topic are

The aquaporins are small hydrophobic membrane proteins. They selectively transport water and some small
solutes across plasma membranes in mammals, plants,
and lower organisms [6]. To date, 13 different subtypes
of mammalian AQPs (AQP-0-12) have been identified
with differing tissue distributions that appear related to
their functional roles in water-transporting [7-10]. Most
authors consider that out of these, seven are aquaporins
(AQP-0, AQP-1, AQP-2, AQP-4, AQP-5, AQP-6, and
AQP-8), four are aquaglyceroporins (AQP-3, AQP-7,
AQP-9, and AQP-10), whereas AQP-11 and AQP-12 are
“superaquaporins” or subcellular AQPs since they have
unusual NPA (Asn-Pro-Ala) motifs [11,12]. AQP-11 is a
271-amino-acid protein in which the second NPA motif
is conserved but the first motif is substituted by NPC
(Asn-Pro-Cys) in both mice and humans [13]. AQP-12
is a 290- or 295-amino-acid aquaporin that is closely
related to AQP-8 in humans and to AQP-0 and AQP-6
in mice [14]. The first NPA motif in AQP-12 is substituted by an NPT (Asn-Pro-Thr) motif in both species.
Recently, AQP-6, AQP-8, AQP-11, and AQP-12 were
named “unorthodox” AQPs (Figure 2A) [15], whose
functions are currently being elucidated. The majority of
studies would characterize AQP-6 as a unique, Hg 2+and low-pH-activated, multipermeable channel. Mouse
AQP-8 increases urea but not glycerol permeability,
whereas human AQP-8 is neither urea nor glycerol
permeable [13]. In contrast, there is still no evidence for
significant transport of water, glycerol, urea, or ions,
contradicting a recent report that found significant
water permeability of AQP-11 when AQP-11 was reconstituted into liposomes [16]. Furthermore, the significance of AQP-12 is completely unknown, and AQP-12
has not been characterized functionally [13]. There is a
considerable body of information about AQP structure
from electron and x-ray crystallography and molecular
dynamics simulations [11,17,18], demonstrating AQP
monomers (~30 kDa) containing six membranespanning helical domains surrounding a narrow aqueous
pore (Figure 2B). The helices of each AQP-1 monomer
that is positioned on the outside face of the tetramer are
hydrophobic, whereas those that are placed towards the
centre of the tetramer are hydrophilic. AQP monomers
are super-assembled in membranes as tetramers (Figure
2C), which are similar to many ion channel family members, such as potassium channels and cyclic nucleotidegated (CNG) channels [19,20]. Unlike ion channels,
however, the channel for water permeability does not
reside at the fourfold axis (the centre of the tetramer).
Instead, each monomer contains a channel (Figure 2C).

genetic manipulation of rodents and the identification of
humans with altered aquaporin genes have provided
considerable insights into aquaporin-related physiology.
For example, the AQP-1 or AQP-4 deficient mice have
impairments in urinary concentrating ability [24,25],
cerebral fluid balance [26], corneal fluid balance [27],
hearing [28], and water transport in the lungs [29,30].
Defective secretion in salivary and submucosal glands
[31,32] and altered lung fluid transport [31] have been
shown in AQP-5 knockout mice. Defects in AQP-2 have
been shown to be linked to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [33,34]. These examples demonstrate that AQPs are
required for normal water homeostasis, and are likely to
be important players in a variety of human diseases.

A., This phylogenetic tree shows the relationship of the thirteen
water channel proteins in mammals (AQP-0-AQP-12). The
assignments in the phylogenetic tree roughly correlate with
permeability characteristics. The aquaporins are generally permeated
only by water. The aquaglyceroporins are permeated by water and
small solutes such as glycerol. The unorthodox were recently named
as AQP-11 and AQP-12 were previously named superaquaporins or
subcellular AQPs and AQP-6 and AQP-8 were previously named
aquaporins. B, The monomeric structure of the aquaporin-1 (AQP-1)
is shown with membrane-spanning helices numbered 1-6 displayed

shown in purple and light blue, and the carboxy-terminal half is
shown in red and pink. Loops B and E, which fold into the
membrane to form the pore, are labeled, as are the conserved NPA
motifs (shown in light grey). Portions of loops B and E form ahelices, and are therefore shown as rods. The arrow highlights the

AQPs are expressed in various tissues including urinary, respiratory, digestive, and nervous systems [21], and
they provide the molecular basis for water transport in
the tissues. AQP channels facilitate bi-directional water
transport across the plasma membrane in response to
osmotic gradients created by solute movement. Water
permeation through AQP channels is characterized by
sensitivity to mercurial agents like HgCl2 [21,22] and
tetraethylammonium (TEA) [23]. Most of AQPs (except
for AQP-4 and AQP-7) are sensitive to HgCl 2 . The

AQPs in the CNS appear to be of great physiological and
pathological importance, especially given the rigid physical constraint that is imposed by the bony cranium. However, current knowledge of aquaporin expression and
function in the nervous system is very limited. Generally,
AQPs are involved in water movement in nervous tissue;
nevertheless, recent data would suggest the involvement
of AQPs in neurotransmission. Several studies have
reported the expression of AQP water channels, AQP-1,
AQP-4, and AQP-9 in the brain [9,35,36], and AQP-4
and AQP-9 in the spinal cord [37]. AQP-4, the predominant water channel in the central nervous system, is
mainly expressed in astrocytes throughout the brain and
spinal cord [38]. AQP-4 plays a role in cerebral edema,
glial cell migration and neuroexcitation [39]. However,
mechanisms of AQP-4 modulation of cortical spreading
depression (CSD) remain unclear. AQP-9 is found in a
subset of astrocyte processes that form the glia limitans
[36] and specialized ependymal cells in the brain and
spinal cord [37].
Brain AQP-1 is mainly expressed in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF)-facing membranes of the ventricular choroid
plexus, where it regulates the formation of CSF presumably due to its functions as a water pore and ion channel
[40]. Interestingly, various neuropathological conditions
involve the up-regulation of AQP-1 expression in the
CNS. Upregulation of brain AQP-1 expression is found
in Alzheimer patients [41], Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[42], traumatic brain injury patients, and human hemangioblastomas. In all cases, the elevated AQP-1 expression
seems to occur in astrocytes residing in diseased brain
tissue, even though these astrocytes and other glial cells
do not normally express AQP-1. The possible roles of
increased expression of AQP-1 in the etiology of different
neuropathological conditions are still unknown, but it is
likely that AQP-1 up-regulation may contribute to edema
and cyst formation-typical outcomes in most of these
pathological conditions. Unfortunately, the mechanisms

Xu et al. Molecular Pain 2010, 6:68
http://www.molecularpain.com/content/6/1/68

that control AQP-1 gene expression in the CNS, under
normal or pathological conditions, are still poorly understood. However, Kim et al [43] showed that the thyroid
transcription factor-1 up-regulates AQP-1 synthesis and
thus facilitates CSF formation in the brain. Moreover, in
CNS, hypertonicity induces AQP-1 synthesis via extracellular signal-regulated kinases, p38 kinase, and c-Jun
terminal kinase [44].
In the spinal cord, AQP-1 is also expressed in the
ependymal cells lining the central canal, but more
robustly in the sensory fibers of the superficial laminae
of the dorsal horn [45-47]. Considering the expression
of AQP-1 in the dorsal horn, it has been suggested that
AQP-1 has a role in physiological pain sensation, known
as nociception. Two groups [48,49] showed recently that
AQP-1-deficient mice are less sensitive to noxious thermal stimuli or capsaicin (the pungent component of
chili peppers which also activates nociceptive skin afferents), and even in human dorsal horn with neuropathic
pain [50]. However, Shields et al. [46] provided evidence
against this role. They reported that AQP-1-null mice
did not have altered nociception. The possibility for
relating AQP-1 and nociception at spinal cord level,
remains speculative.
AQPs in peripheral sensitization of nociception

A growing body of evidence showed that AQPs appear to
be involved in the peripheral sensitization of nociceptors.
AQP-1 is expressed in small afferent sensory nerve fibers
in the peripheral nervous system. In research published
by Oshio’s group, both the small neurons and small afferent nerve fibers in normal mouse dorsal root ganglion
were shown the co-localization of AQP-1 and capsaicin
receptor (TRPV1) [51]. The TRPV1 receptors have the
function of transmitting the painful stimuli in vivo [52].
Furthermore, recent studies showed that thermal inflammatory pain perception was greatly reduced in AQP1-/mice evoked by bradykinin, prostaglandin E2, and capsaicin as well as reduced cold pain perception [53]. Nav1.8
currents and expression were significantly reduced in
AQP1 -/- mice DRG neurons. The reduction in Nav1.8
currents would contribute to the impairment in repetitive
AP firing and to the accelerated adaptation observed in
AQP-1-deficient DRG neurons. In addition, immunoprecipitation studies and single molecule tracking indicated
a physical interaction between AQP-1 and Nav1.8. These
data provide a physical and functional link between
AQP-1 expression and Nav1.8 function, and implicate
the involvement of AQP1 in DRG neurons for the perception of inflammatory thermal pain [53]. Interestingly,
GFAP-positive, injured Schwann cells in the peripheral
nervous system (PNS) are known to express AQP-1 [54],
but not AQP-4, a protein abundant in spinal cord astrocytes [55]. AQP-2 expression was not detectable either in

Page 4 of 8

the spinal cord or in the dorsal root ganglia of naive rats.
However, AQP-2 expression was dramatically increased
in small-diameter dorsal root ganglia neurons in response
to chronic constriction injury treatment [56]. These data
support the hypothesis that AQP-1 and AQP-2 might
be involved in pain processing under inflammatory and
neuropathic nerve injury conditions. However, the
detailed mechanisms of such roles warrants to be further
investigated.
AQP-1 in migraine pathophysiology

The major symptom of migraine, the headache pain, is
mediated by neuronal activity along the trigeminovascular pathway. Activation and sensitization of primary afferent neurons (PANs) in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) is
the first step in driving this nociceptive pathway. Using
immunofluorescent staining, Shields et al. have described
that AQP-1 is heavily expressed in a population of small
diameter primary sensory neurons of TG, and co-localized with a marker of peptidergic nociceptors, substance
P [46]. In addition to the dorsal root ganglion, the
expression of TRPV1 in rat TG was detected recently
[57]. Furthermore, the co-localization of 5-HT1B receptors with substance P was also identified in the human
TG [58].
Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate
that AQP-1 might be co-expressed with TRPV1 receptors,
substance P, or 5-HT1B receptors in the neuronal cells and
small diameter afferent nerve fibers of trigeminal ganglion
and their connecting structures, thus involved in the
pathophysiology of migraine. This hypothesis is highly
supported by our recent results that AQP-1 is coexpressed with calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), a
nociceptive marker, in TG neurons (Figure 3A). Given
that migraine represents a chronic neurological disease,
we hypothesized that in a model of migraine AQP-1
expression would be elevated. Indeed, in wild type mice,
epidural KCl evoked repetitive CSDs induced up-regulation of AQP-1 expression at both mRNA (Figure 3B) and
protein levels (Figure 3C) in upper cervical dorsal horn, a
key component in the migraine pathway. The AQP-1
expression remained unaltered in TG in a mice model of
perioral acute inflammatory pain although the AQP-2
expression was remarkably increased in small-sized neurons and Schwann cells [56]. The intracellular redistribution of AQP-2 was also observed in this animal model.
These data support the idea that AQP-1 upregulation in
TG might be disease specific. To further determine the
role of AQP-1, we found that the deficiency of AQP-1
(mice kindly provided by Dr. Alan Verkman from University of California, San Francisco) significantly decreased
the firing frequency of upper cervical dorsal horn neurons
(Figure 4). In addition, silencing the mouse AQP-1 gene
in vivo using a viral RNA interference approach abolished

the elevated avoidance to light of migraine model, which
models the photophobia often observed in patients with
migraine (data not shown). These observations point to
the hypothesis that AQP-1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for migraine [59].

Conclusions
Migraine is among the more debilitating diseases, and
current treatment modalities are unsatisfactory in more
than half of the patients [3]. More specific, well-tolerated,

and effective methods of prophylaxis are desired. AQPs
represent just one of many exciting potential therapeutic
targets. Other possible candidates include NOTCH3, the
causative gene for CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), and SLC1A3, encoding the EAAT1
(excitatory amino acid transporter and glutamate transporter [3]. The development of genetically sensitized
mouse models has more or less opened up a completely
new field for migraine research. Whereas previous

facilitate research into increased sensitivity to migraine
triggers and metabolic homeostasis. In addition to treatment of acute attacks, a better understanding of the
mechanism of migraine attack triggers will help in the
development of specific preventive therapies.
