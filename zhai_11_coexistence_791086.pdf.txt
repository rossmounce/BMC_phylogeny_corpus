Abstract
Pigs are often co-infected by different viral strains from the same virus. Up to now, there are few reports about coexistence of different porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) strains in China. The aim of this study was to evaluate it in
Chinese swine herds. 118 PCV2 positive DNAs isolated from diseased pigs identified by classic PCR were redetected using a modified differential PCR assay. The results indicated that co-existence rates of PCV2 were 32.2%
(38/118) in diseased pigs and 0% (0/41) in asymptomatic pigs. Four PCV2 complete genomes were cloned from
two co-infected samples and their nucleotide (nt) identities were 95%-97.3%. The phylogenetic analysis showed
that four PCV2 strains were divided into different genotypes, PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2d and PCV2e, respectively. In
addition, co-existence were not detected in 41 serum samples from healthy pigs but PCV2 single infection (31.7%,
13/41) existed. These data revealed that the co-existence of different strains of PCV2 might contribute to the
development of more severe clinical symptoms for pigs. This is the first report confirming the co-existence of
different PCV2 strains in Chinese swine herds. Meanwhile, this study could help us to understand new infection
and prevalence forms of PCV2 clinically.

Findings
Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), a small but powerful
virus, is the major etiological agent of porcine circovirus
associated diseases (PCVAD), which is involved in postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS),
porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), congenital
tremors type II (CT), reproductive failure [1-5].
PCV2 belongs to a member of the genus Circovirus of
the family Circoviridae, which possesses a small, circular, single-stranded DNA genome (1767/1768 bp) [2].
According to the present definition of PCV2 genotypes,
PCV2 are divided into five genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b,
PCV2c, PCV2d, PCV2e) [6,7], and their genomic
nucleotide (nt) sequences differ by approximately 5%.
The circular genome of PCV2 encodes two major open

reading frames (ORF): ORF1 (945 bp) encodes the replicase protein involved in viral replication [8], ORF2 (702/
705 bp) encodes the immunogenic capsid protein
[6,7,9]. PCV2a and PCV2b have been reported in Europe
and Asia, but PCV2b was not detected in North America prior to the year of 2004. In 2005, PCVAD outbroke
in Canada [10,11] and in the United States [12], respectively. An emerging genotype, PCV2b, was considered as
an important pathogen of that murrain. Since 2008, a
third genotype (PCV2c) was reported in Denmark with
only three sequences to date [6,13]. However, in China,
in addition to PCV2a and PCV2b prevalence, another
two genotypes (PCV2d and PCV2e) were also detected
[7].
At present, PCV2 were frequently detected in Chinese
swine herds, but no data reported on the co-existence of
different PCV2 strains. Therefore, the goal of this study
was to obtain information about the PCV2 co-existence
in Chinese swine herds.
118 PCV2 positive DNAs isolated from clinical diseased pigs suffering from PMWS and PRDC between
2008 and 2009 were identified by classic PCR and stored

at -30°C freezer until use. Moreover, to detect whether
co-existence of PCV2 occurred in healthy pigs (about
60-day old) or not, 41 DNAs were isolated from 41
serum samples in two healthy pig farms of the Zhejiang
province. Due to the same signature motif for PCV2a
and PCV2e and the same/similar signature motif for
PCV2b, PCV2c and PCV2d, the previous differential
PCR assay [14] was minor modified, which was involved
in the design of one communal upstream primer and
two different downstream primers. In this study, the
detection primers for PCV2a and PCV2e were FPCV2ab (5’-CAGTTCGTCACCCTTTCCC-3’) and RPCV2a (5’-GGGGGACCAACAAAATCTC-3’), while the
detection primers for PCV2b, PCV2c and PCV2d were
F-PCV2ab and R-PCV2b (5’-GGGGCTCAAACCC
CCKCWC-3’). PCV2 differential PCR reactions were
performed on each sample in a 25 μl reaction mixture,
which contained 0.5 μl of μM upstream primer, 0.5 μl
of μM downstream primer, 12.5 μl of 2 × master mix
(containing 0.1 U Taq DNA Polymerase μl -1 , 0.4 mM
each dNTPs, 2 × Taq buffer) (Lifefeng Inc., Shanghai,
China), 8.5 μl of sterile water, and 3 μl of sample DNA.
DNA amplification was initiated by preheating for 5 min
at 94°C, followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for 15 s, 60°C for
20 s, and 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension for 10 min
at 72°C.
To determine the complete genomic sequences from
co-infected samples, primers (F-PCV2SacII and RPCV2SacII) were used as described previously [15] to
amplify the complete genome of all PCV2 genotypes.
The PCR products, approximate 1.76 kb, were purified
by BioDev Gel Extraction System A kit (Beijing, China)
and ligated into vecter pBST-II (TIANGEN Inc., Beijing,
China). The positive pBST-PCV2 recombination plasmids were sequenced by T7, T3 and PCF1096 (5’-GGATATTGTAKTCCTGGTCG-3’) primers, respectively.
Considering having difficulty in obtaining sequenes of
different PCV2 genotypes from the same PCR product,
initially, only partial gene of open reading frame 2
(ORF2) was sequenced by using primer PCF1096 for
those positive recombination plasmids. When genome
sequences of ORF2 were different from each other, plasmids were then sequenced by T7 and T3 primers.

Sequences generated in this study were deposited in
GenBank (accession no. GQ359003, GQ359004,
GU001709 and GU001710), meanwhile, their nt identities were determined using the Clustal W alignment
program (DNASTAR software). Phylogenitic tree based
on neighbour-joining methods was constructed by
MAGE version 4.0. Recombination event was evaluated
by recombination detection program (RDP) 3.34
software.
118 PCV2 positive DNAs were identified by differential PCR assay, and the results showed that 36 samples
contained PCV2a/2e-single infection, 44 samples contained PCV2b/2c/2d-single infection, and 38 samples
(32.2%) were positive for co-existence. However, co-existence were not detected in 41 samples from healthy pigs
but PCV2b/2c/2d-single infection (13/41) occurred.
To primarily determine co-existence types of PCV2,
the differential PCR products were submitted to sequencing company (HuaDa Gene) and directly sequenced
using F-PCV2ab primer. Sequencing results of 38 coinfected samples showed that co-existence genotypes
were PCV2a-PCV2b (12/38), PCV2a-PCV2d (15/38) and
PCV2e-PCV2d (11/38), respectively. In addition, 13
PCV2b/2d PCR products from healthy serum samples
were also sequenced and PCV2 genotypes were identified as PCV2b (5/13) and PCV2d (8/13). Interestingly to
us, PCV2c genotype was not detected in this study. To
further confirm the co-existence of different PCV2 genotypes, four full-length clones (named as GX0841a,
GX0841b, BJ0901a and BJ0901b) were obtained from
the samples of GX0841 and BJ0901. Sequence identities
were 95%-97.3% among them (Table 1). GX0841a and
BJ0901a strains had the same genome organizations
(ORF1: from nt 51 to nt 995; ORF2: from nt 1735 to nt
1034), while GX0841b and BJ0901b had distinct genome
structure, (ORF1: from nt 51 to nt 995; ORF2: from nt
1734 to nt 1033) and (ORF1: from nt 51 to nt 995;
ORF2: from nt 1734 to nt 1030), respectively. In other
words, their differences mainly lay in the position and
size (702 bp for GX0841a, GX0841b and BJ0901a; 705
bp for BJ0901b) of ORF2 in the whole genome (Figure
1A). Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome showed four strains were divided into four different

genotypes, PCV2a (GX0841a), PCV2b (GX0841b),
PCV2d (BJ0901b) and PCV2e (BJ0901a) (Figure 1B).
Moreover, we also evaluated their identities of nt and
amino acids (aa) among ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3, the
sequence alignment results showed that the identities of
ORF2 (87.3%-94.6% for nt and 83.3-93.6% for aa) (Figure 2) were lower than ORF1 (97%-99% for nt and
98.7%-99.7% for aa) and ORF3 (97.5%-98.7% for nt and
91.4%-95.2% for aa) (data not shown). In addition, we
could not find significant recombination breakpoints
from different PCV2 genotypes isolated co-infected samples by sequence alignment and RDP (data not shown).
Differential PCR was developed for the first time by
Hesse et al. [14], at that time, they designed primers
only to detect PCV2a and PCV2b not PCV2c and

PCV2d. In this study, co-existence rates were (32.2%,
38/118), which was much higher than that 25% (24/97)
in their study (p < 0.05, c2 test). The reason might be
that differential PCR was modified and optimized, which
could increase PCV2 detection rates (such as new genotypes: PCV2c and PCV2d). In the present study, there
was PCV2b- or PCV2d- single infection detected in
healthy pigs, which was the similar to the first report on
PCV2 infection in a high-health Canadian swine farm
[1]. The above data indicated that pigs co-infected by
PCV2 multiple genotypes or strains displayed more
severe lesions, which was similar to the previous study
[16]. However, Opriessnig et al. [17] confirmed there
was no significant difference in virulence between
PCV2a and PCV2b but prior to infection provides heterologous protection. This might imply the co-existence
mechanism of multiple PCV2 strains is confusing.
Although four PCV2 genotypes (2a, 2b, 2d, 2e) have
been determined in Chinese herds in the previous study
[7], however, in the present study, it is the first time
confirmed that the co-existences of PCV2a-PCV2b,
PCV2a-PCV2d and PCV2d-PCV2e. PCV2c, as a distinct
genotype, was only reported in Denmark rather than
other countries and regions [6,13]. In this study, it was
not still detected in Chinese swine herds, which was
similar to the results in the previous study [7]. To some
extent, we could think that there were different PCV2
genotypes on different pig farms, different regions, and
even different time [13]. Isolations of two PCV2 fulllength clones from the same sample was a time-consuming process. Therefore, it should be necessary for us
to design genotype-specific primers for amplifying the
complete genomes of different genotypes in the future.
PCV2 mainly evolves by mutation and/or recombination. In comparison to GX0601 strain from 2006 in
China, BJ0901a strain from 2009 in China had 12 nt
substitution, while, in comparison to TJ strain from
2002 in China, BJ0901b strain from 2009 in China had
31 nt substitution. In this study, BJ0901a (4 × 10-3) and
BJ0901b (4.4 × 10 -3 ) had higher nt substitution rates
than the estimated (1.2 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year) by
Firth et al. [18]. Co-existence of different PCV2 genotypes in the same pig could contribute to PCV2 recombination. There were no significant recombination
breakpoints detected in this study, although putative
recombination breakpoints were identified previously
[14,19-23]. Here, some recombination events were questioned, due to possible artifacts. In fact, the bulk of
PCV2 complete genome deposited in GenBank have
been obtained by PCR amplifying using multiple primers
from PCV2 genome conserve regions. In this study, the
full-length of PCV2 from co-infected samples were
amplified by PCR using a pair of primers, which could
avoid artificial recombination events generating. In

addition, nt sequencing of complete PCV2 genome
obtained through rolling-circle amplification assay could
overcome this problem [24,25].
In conclusion, this is the first time demonstrating coexistence of different PCV2 genotypes or strains in
China. This study could help us to better understand
molecular epidemiology and new infection forms of
PCV2. Modified differential PCR method saved some
time than before, which could fasten the detection process of PCV2 multiple genotypes clinically. Moreover,
the presence of multiple genotypes in the same pig
should be taken into consideration when obtaining
molecular epidemiology of PCV2. Co-existence

mechanism of multiple PCV2 strains or genotypes
should have been elucidated through more studies.
