Identification of a spliced gene from duck
enteritis virus encoding a protein homologous to
UL15 of herpes simplex virus 1
Hongwei Zhu, Huixin Li, Zongxi Han, Yuhao Shao, Yu Wang and Xiangang Kong*

Abstract
Background: In herpesviruses, UL15 homologue is a subunit of terminase complex responsible for cleavage and
packaging of the viral genome into pre-assembled capsids. However, for duck enteritis virus (DEV), the causative
agent of duck viral enteritis (DVE), the genomic sequence was not completely determined until most recently.
There is limited information of this putative spliced gene and its encoding protein.
Results: DEV UL15 consists of two exons with a 3.5 kilobases (kb) inron and transcribes into two transcripts: the
full-length UL15 and an N-terminally truncated UL15.5. The 2.9 kb UL15 transcript encodes a protein of 739 amino
acids with an approximate molecular mass of 82 kiloDaltons (kDa), whereas the UL15.5 transcript is 1.3 kb in
length, containing a putative 888 base pairs (bp) ORF that encodes a 32 kDa product. We also demonstrated that
UL15 gene belonged to the late kinetic class as its expression was sensitive to cycloheximide and phosphonoacetic
acid. UL15 is highly conserved within the Herpesviridae, and contains Walker A and B motifs homologous to the
catalytic subunit of the bacteriophage terminase as revealed by sequence analysis. Phylogenetic tree constructed
with the amino acid sequences of 23 herpesvirus UL15 homologues suggests a close relationship of DEV to the
Mardivirus genus within the Alphaherpesvirinae. Further, the UL15 and UL15.5 proteins can be detected in the
infected cell lysate but not in the sucrose density gradient-purified virion when reacting with the antiserum against
UL15. Within the CEF cells, the UL15 and/or UL15.5 localize(s) in the cytoplasm at 6 h post infection (h p. i.) and
mainly in the nucleus at 12 h p. i. and at 24 h p. i., while accumulate(s) in the cytoplasm in the absence of any
other viral protein.
Conclusions: DEV UL15 is a spliced gene that encodes two products encoded by 2.9 and 1.3 kb transcripts
respectively. The UL15 is expressed late during infection. The coding sequences of DEV UL15 are very similar to
those of alphaherpesviruses and most similar to the genus Mardivirus. The UL15 and/or UL15.5 accumulate(s) in the
cytoplasm during early times post-infection and then are translocated to the nucleus at late times.

Background
Duck enteritis virus (DEV), also known as Anatid herpesvirus-1 (AHV-1), is an important pathogen of birds
of the order Anseriformes, including ducks, geese and
swans, causing the acute contagious disease duck viral
enteritis (DVE) or duck plague (DP), which results in
substantial mortality and reduction of egg production in
domestic as well as in wild waterfowl [1,2]. DEV was
classified as an unassigned virus within the family

Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, China

Herpesviridae according to the Eighth International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [3]. Evidence from recent phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence or the predicted amino acid sequence
suggests that DEV was closely related to the genus Mardivirus or Varicellovirus and might represent a single
cluster within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae [4-8].
The genomic sequence of DEV was determined and
analyzed recently and the presence of more than 78 different open reading frames (ORFs) was predicted [8].
A terminase-related, protein-encoding gene homologous
to HSV UL15 was predicted based on the homology
analysis of theses ORFs and those of their homologous

counterparts from other herpesviruses. The UL15 is a
rarely occurring spliced gene in herpesviruses and consists mostly of two exons [9-15]; however, there are
three exons in UL15 homologue from the channel catfish herpesvirus [16]. UL15 is highly conserved among
members of the family Herpesviridae, which implies the
functional significance of this protein [9]. The amino
acid sequence of UL15 shares homology with the large
subunit of the terminase complex of bacteriophage T4,
particularly with respect to the two nucleotide-binding
motifs of the ATP-binding domain known as Walker A
and Walker B domains [16,17], which suggests UL15 is
ATP binding as demonstrated for gp17 and other phage
terminases [18].
Within the infected cells, UL15 and at least other six
proteins (UL6, UL17, UL25, UL28, UL32 and UL33) are
involved in viral DNA cleavage and packaging [19-25].
In accordance with the defined role as a terminase subunit, the UL15 protein is presumed to localize or colocalize with other subunits primarily within the nucleus
of infected cells. Indeed, HSV-1 UL15 is transported
from intranuclear space at 6 h post-infection (h p. i.)
into the nucleus at 12 h p. i. and localizes to the replication compartments where cleavage and packaging proteins might be recruited to process the viral DNA, as
indicated by immunofluorescence assay [21,26]. In addition, the ORF45/42 gene product, a UL15 homologue in
varicella-zoster virus (VZV), also shows nearly exclusive
nuclear localization in infected cells [14]. In contrast to
its HSV-1 homologue, cells transiently transfected with
ORF45/42 showed only weak nuclear staining, which
suggests the formation of a protein complex, or at least
a heterodimers, by UL15 homologues and other putative
terminase subunit(s). Such a terminase complex has
been studied extensively in HSV-1 [27-29] and in
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [30].
In DEV, the UL15 transcript feature and its encoding
product were analyzed merely on the basis of the
sequence alignment with its counterparts from other
herpesviruses. Little is known about this, or at least possible, spliced gene and its product in DEV-infected cells
or DEV virion. Therefore, we describe the identification
and characterization of the putative UL15 transcript and
its encoding protein in DEV-infected cells, which provides data to aid the classification of DEV within the
Herpesviridae family and provides clues for better
understanding the possible role of UL15 in DEV
infection.

Results
UL15 is a spliced gene with two transcripts

Nucleotide sequence of the putative DEV UL15 gene
was determined, annotated and deposited in GenBank
(accession numbers EF524094 and EF203707) previously

by our laboratory. The UL15 gene of DEV is assumed to
consist of two coding exons separated by an intron that
contains ORFs UL16 and UL17 transcribed in the orientation opposite to that of UL15 [8]. To confirm this
assumption, RT-PCR was carried out with RNA isolated
from DEV-infected CEF cells with specific primers covering the putative splice site. As expected, a 786 bp
DNA product was observed by electrophoresis in agarose gel (Figure 1A). The fragment was cloned and
sequenced, and the splice site was located. The genomic
sequences at the exon-intron boundaries were found to
read 5’- GCATTGACAGgtacttgtct-3’ and 5’-aacaactaagAGTTTGCGAG-3’ (intron sequences are indicated in
lowercase letters) as donor and splicing acceptor
sequences respectively (Figure 1B), conforming to the
consensus of the GT-AG rule [31].
The UL15 transcript was determined by northern blot
analysis of total RNA isolated from mock-infected or
DEV-infected cells. The results demonstrated that UL15
is transcribed with a predominant transcript of 2.9 kb
and a less abundant transcript of 1.3 kb when hybridizing the blot with probes P898 and PC696 (Figure 2A). We
believed that the 2.9 kb transcript corresponded in size
to the UL15 transcript, while the 1.3 kb transcript corresponded in size to the predicted UL15.5 transcript.
Sequence analysis of DEV UL15

The complete nucleotide sequence of the UL15 transcript is 2882 bp in length according to the 5’- and
3’-RACE, and the putative coding region is 2220 bp in
length, encoding a 739 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 82.1 kDa. The UL15.5 transcript
is 1290 bp in length with an 888 bp ORF that encodes a
32.1 kDa protein. The transcription start site (TSS) of
UL15 is 612 bp upstream from the putative start codon
ATG and that of UL15.5 is 352 bp upstream from the
ATG codon. Promoters as well as TATA box elements
of UL15 and UL15.5 were predicted at the 5’-cDNA end
(Figure 2B). In addition, a consensus polyadenylation
site (5’-AATAAA-3’) was present 18 bp downstream
from the UL15 stop codon. 14 bp downstream, this signal is 12 adenine residues, as indicated by 3’-RACE
sequencing (Figure 2B); this polyadenylation site could
define the 3’ ends of both the UL15 and UL15.5 transcripts. The UL15 gene locus was thus drawn accordingly (Figure 2C).
As shown in Table 1, homologues of the DEV UL15
gene product are conserved among subfamilies of the
Herpesviridae. UL15 shares a high level of amino acid
sequence identity (32.9 - 62.3%) and similarity (50.3 75.2%) with nine other typical herpesviruses, as indicated
by sequence alignments. Furthermore, two putative
nucleotide-binding motifs, resembling the Walker A
motif (GXXGXGKT/S, where X is any amino acid) and

in the absence of these metabolic inhibitors; as a control, b-actin mRNA was insensitive to CHX or PAA
(Figure 5A). Similar to the finding from RT-PCR, the
UL15-specific immunoreactive bands were detected only
in the absence of drug inhibitors, as shown by western
blot (Figure 5B). Taken as a whole, treatment with CHX
or PAA inhibited transcription and expression of UL15
in infected cells, suggesting that the UL15 gene is transcribed and expressed as a late gene during DEV infection in CEF cells.

To characterize the expression of the UL15 gene in
infected cells, western blot was performed on the DEV
infected or pcDNA-UL15 transfected CEF cell lysates
using the UL15-specific antiserum developed in rabbits.
We found that the antiserum could react with an
82 kDa protein in DEV-infected CEF cell lysates, but
not in uninfected cell extracts (Figure 6A). The protein
was detectable at 6 h p. i. and the reactive band became
stronger with time up to 24 h p. i. (Figure 6B). Further,
the antiserum could react, although weakly, with a
second polypeptide with molecular mass of 32 kDa
(Figure 6A), confirming the expression of the 1.3 kb
transcript indicated by northern blot. We believe that
this minor protein represents the UL15.5 of DEV. We
also examined the DEV virion for its reactivity with
anti-UL15 antiserum. As shown in Figure 6C, we were
unable to detect UL15 in the prepared DEV virions,
whereas the major capsid protein VP5 was detectable
when reacting with McAb 1B5. In addition, transfection
of the pcDNA-UL15 plasmid into CEF could also result
in the expression of UL15 (Figure 6D).

the Walker B motif (ZZZZD or ZZZZDE, where Z is a
hydrophobic amino acid) exist within the UL15 ORF.
These two characteristic motifs were found to read
261VPRRHGKT267 and 354LLFVDE359, and fit neatly with
those from typical subfamilies Alphaherpesvirinae (HSV1), Betaherpesvirinae (HCMV) and Gammaherpesvirinae
(EBV), bacteriophage T4, bacteriophage P7 and bacteriophage HK97 (Figure 3).
Result from phylogenetic tree based on UL15
sequences of 23 herpesviruses showed that the DEV and
other members in the Alphaherpesvirinae are clustered
within a monophyletic clade with 100% bootstrap.
Although the branch pattern of DEV UL15 shows
distinctive character, its phylogenetic relationship in
alphaherpesviruses, however, is still closely related to
Mardivirus (Figure 4).
UL15 is expressed late during infection

To determine which kinetic class UL15 gene belongs to,
RT-PCR was performed to detect UL15 and chicken
b-actin mRNAs respectively in the presence of CHX or
PAA. The result showed that the UL15 mRNA was not
detected in DEV-infected cells in the presence of CHX
or PAA, while the RT-PCR product could be amplified

Subcellular localization of the UL15 protein

Subcellular distribution of DEV UL15 was determined
by immunofluorescence assay of the DEV-infected CEF
cells with anti-UL15 serum. As shown in Figure 7A, the
fluorescence signals accumulated in the cytoplasm,

predominantly in the perinuclear region of the cells in
the early infection stage at 6 h p. i. At 12 h p. i. and
24 h p. i., however, the fluoresence signals localized
mainly at the nucleus within the infected cells. Interestingly, at 24 h p. i., aggregation of fluorescence was
observed occasionally within the nucleus (J and L in
Figure 7), which might represent the so-called replication
compartments where viral DNA synthesis occurs, which
has been observed in HSV-1 [32]. In addition, specific
fluorescence was limited to the cytoplasm rather than
in the nucleus in pcDNA-UL15 transfected CEF cells
(Figure 7B), which may indicated that the UL15 and/or
UL15.5 protein(s) could not transport through the nuclear
pore, or possibly that the protein(s) retained in the
cytoplasm as a result of interacting with certain cellular
protein(s). Specific fluorescence signal was not detected in
any assay in the mock-infected cells or pcDNA3.1 (+)
transfected cells.

Discussion
It is common that eukaryotic DNA viruses encode genes
containing introns that require mRNA splicing. However,
the vast majority of transcripts are not spliced in viruses
from the Herpesviridae. To our knowledge, aside from
DEV UL15, there are four spliced UL15 homologues

have been experimentally characterized in HSV-1, VZV,
RCMV, Tupaia herpesvirus (THV) and Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) until now [9-12,14]. Remarkably in
these five gene locus and other predicted homologues,
we have noticed that although the coding sequences of
UL15 homologues are conserved among herpesviruses,
the ORFs and their arrangements between the exons are
somewhat complex. In HSV-1, VZV and DEV, the intron
contains two ORFs, UL16 and UL17, which have an
orientation opposite to that of the UL15 gene [9,14]; in
RCMV, the region between R89 (a UL15 homologue)
exon 1 and exon 2 was found to contain five additional
genes, r90, R91, R92, R93 and R94, the latter four are
transcribed in the opposite orientation; in BoHV-4, the
intron carries ORFs 30 - 33 in the opposite direction to
UL15 homologues. It seems likely that the feature of
gene arrangements within the introns is subfamily-specific within the Herpesviridae. This phenomenon might be
the result of an evolutionary event: the terminase-related
UL15 coding sequence remained conserved for its importance in herpesvirus biology, while genes within the
intron evolved via recombination and gene transfer
between virus and vertebrate hosts since these events are
common in herpesviruses [33]. In this interpretation, the
fact that the pattern of ORF organization within the DEV

Figure 5 Kinetic class analysis of DEV UL15. DEV-infected CEF
cells were harvested at the indicated time post-infection, followed
by mRNA detection by RT-PCR (A) or protein detection by western
blot (B). The procedures were done with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide
(CHX) or with 300 μg/ml phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) or without
metabolic inhibitor as the control. Chicken b-actin mRNA or protein
was used as an internal control.

UL15 intron is very similar to that of the corresponding
regions of other alphaherpesviruses is another piece of
direct evidence that DEV is a member of the subfamily
Alphaherpesvirinae, which is in accordance with pervious
findings [4,6,7,34].
Two transcripts were detected using three different
DIG-labeled DNA probes derived from the UL15 RTPCR product as indicated by northern blot (Figure 2A).
Although choosing probes from the putative UL15 ORF
could not exclude the possibility that either detected
transcript was the result of overlapping transcripts adjacent to the UL15 gene or transcribing from the UL15
intron, subsequent results from full-length cDNA mapping by RACEs showed that both transcripts were most
likely expressed by UL15, which is in good agreement
with the two polypeptides detected by the UL15
antiserum. Thus, we believe that the 2.9 kb and 1.3 kb
transcripts are analogous to the UL15 and UL15.5 of
HSV-1, respectively. Besides, the 1.3 kb transcript hybridized with the probes PC 696 , which might suggest
the C-terminal location of the UL15.5 transcript.
Furthermore, pairwise alignment of DEV UL15 with
HSV UL15.5 suggested the 295 residues of the DEV
UL15.5 coding sequence, with its translation initiation
site, might be located at Met445 within the DEV UL15
exon II. However, considering this methionine is not

Page 6 of 12

absolutely conserved among the herpesviruses family
[16], whether this methionine is indeed an initiation site
or translation of UL15.5 initiates at another site(s)
requires further study. Interestingly, another four
methionine residues (Met 449 , Met 455 , Met 457 and
Met 462 ) are present at this region only 4-17 residues
downstream Met445, it is possible that when this site is
mutated, another specific methionine might be utilized
to translate a migrating version of UL15.5. In HSV-1,
UL15.5 is dispensable for viral growth in the infected
cell and its specific function during infection remains
unknown, though several possible explanations for its
origin and role have been discussed [26]. As for DEV
UL15.5, further study is required to elucidate whether
this gene is essential for DEV infection in vitro and in
vivo, which will be a hint to specify the role(s) of
UL15.5 itself as well as the C terminus of exon II concerning the largely identical sequences of the two.
In herpesviruses, there are several viral proteins participating in processing and packaging of viral DNA, among
which UL15 homologue is a presumed terminase subunit
with a potential role in the cleavage of progeny DNA [35].
The presence of the Walker A and Walker B box motifs in
DEV UL15 might imply its corresponding role considering
the following two facts: first, these two motifs fit well with
the well characterized catalytic subunit (gp17) of the bacteriophage T4 terminase (Figure 3), similar position and
distance between the motifs will ensure the correct formation of the nucleotide-binding site of an ABC (ATPbinding cassette) domain. Second, the role of the Walker
A motif in viral genomic DNA cleavage in herpesvirus had
been suggested by Przech et al., They found that HSV-1
point-mutated in the Walker A motif within the UL15
exon I failed to cleave viral DNA concatemers and the
HSV-1 mutant exhibited growth defects [35].
To date, the taxonomic status of DEV is not clearly
defined within the Herpesviridae in ICTVdb [3],
although considerable evidence suggests it is a novel
member or a member of the Mardivirus genus within
the Alphaherpesvirinae [4,7,8]. As a genome-wide function-conserved protein among viruses within the Herpesviridae, the DNA packaging-related UL15 is believed to
be inherited from a common ancestor by the Alpha-,
Beta- and Gamma-herpesviruses [33,36]. This feature
makes UL15 an ideal molecular genetic marker for phylogenetic construction and taxonomy within the family.
For this reason, the UL15 protein has been widely chosen as one of the markers to characterize the evolutionary relationship of a certain virus within the family
Herpesviridae [37-39]. As indicated from the tree based
on deduced UL15 amino acid sequence, it is preferable
to group the DEV as a member of Mardivirus genus,
which is in accordance with the majority of the earlier
findings [4,6,7].

(+)-transfected cells were harvested at the indicated time post transfection, and analyzed by western blotting using antiserum to UL15. The
positions of molecular mass markers (in kDa) are indicated at the left.

As a component of terminase, UL15 is presumed to
interact with replicating DNA and preassembled capsids
to cleave and encapsidate the viral DNA. Thus, there
exists at least a transient association of DEV UL15 with
the capsids. However, UL15 was not detected in the
purified DEV virion by western blot (Figure 6C). Two
possibilities might account for the failure of UL15 detection. One is that UL15 is not a component of the DEV
virion. The other is that it represents a virion component in a so low abundance that it is undetectable by
the method used in this study. We would like to infer
that the protein is present in the intranuclear capsid
precursor however diminished in the mature virion.
Theoretically, a mixture of procapsids and A-, B- and
C-capsids are present in the DEV virion we have prepared, among which the C-capsid is the predominant
type. Furthermore, only a trace amount of UL15 is
present in procapsids, A- and B-capsids, whereas the
protein might not be present in the more mature DNAcontaining C-capsids, as demonstrated in its counterpart

HSV-1 [40,41]. Therefore, it is possible that UL15 exists
in the sucrose density gradient-purified virion, but at
such a low abundance that it is not detectable by western blot. Analysis of the virion by more sophisticated
techniques, such as immunoelectron microscopy, is
needed to confirm this assumption.
Cytoplasmic nuclear transport of UL15 and/or UL15.5
was observed within the DEV-infected cells, which is
consistent with the nuclear localization of the protein
homologues observed in HSV-1 and VZV-infected cells
[14,21]. These findings are in line with the fact that the
UL15 homologue is a potential terminase subunit since
viral DNA cleavage and encapsidation also take place
within the nucleus. Interestingly, in HSV-1, UL15
expressed alone displayed efficient nuclear localization
[26]; however, findings from VZV ORF45/42 transiently
transfected cells as well as those from DEV UL15 in this
study suggest that the protein is unable to localize to
the nucleus in the absence of any other viral protein.
This is not surprising as the UL15 ORF of HSV-1

(NLS) [21], whereas no similar NLS is predicted in
either DEV UL15 or VZV ORF45/42 protein. Besides,
ORF 29a/29b, another UL15 homologue from BoHV-4
does not contain a similar NLS sequence either. Hence,
we tend to assume that the newly synthesized UL15 is
localized in the cytoplasm due to the lack of NLS in
DEV-infected cells, whereas transport into the nucleus
when coupled with other viral and/or cellular protein(s)
that contain NLS to form a protein complex, allowing
the nucleus targeting of the protein. Further studies are
needed to determine the protein(s) required for the
cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking of UL15 within DEV
infected cells.

Conclusions
DEV UL15 is a spliced gene that encodes two products
encoded by 2.9 and 1.3 kb transcripts respectively. The
UL15 is expressed late during infection. The DEV UL15
coding sequences are very similar to those of alphaherpesviruses and most similar to the genus Mardivirus.
The UL15 and or UL15.5 accumulate(s) in the

cytoplasm during early times post-infection and then are
translocated to the nucleus at late times.

Methods
Cell culture, virus propagation and purification

Chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells were prepared
and maintained in Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, MA, USA) supplemented
with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS; JRH Biosciences, KS,
USA), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and
100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary or secondary cells
were used to propagate DEV Clone-03, a CEF-adapted
vaccine strain [6]. Cells infected with DEV were maintained in DMEM containing 2% FBS. To prepare the
DEV virion, CEF monolayer was infected with DEV
Clone-03 at a multiplicity of infection (m. o. i.) of 10
plaque-forming units (p. f. u.)/cell. Cells and the DEVcontaining medium were harvested when more than
80% CPE developed, followed by 3 cycles of rapid freezing and thawing. The suspension was centrifuged at 4°C
for 30 min at 3,000 × g, 30 min at 5,000 × g and 30 min
at 8,000 × g to remove cell debris. The supernatant was
recovered and centrifuged at 4°C for 2 h at 140,000 × g.

The pellet was suspended in PBS and overlaid onto a
discontinuous sucrose density gradient (20% and 60%
sucrose in PBS) and centrifuged at 4°C for 2.5 h at
140,000 × g in a Beckman Coulter Optima™ L-100XP
ultracentrifuge equipped with a SW41Ti swingingbucket rotor (Beckman-Coulter, CA, USA). The virus
band was collected and diluted with PBS. The virion
pellets were finally collected after centrifugation at 4°C
for 2 h at 140,000 × g and suspended in PBS.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

CEF cells were infected with DEV Clone-03 at an m. o.
i. of 10. Total RNA was extracted from the infected cells
at 48 h p. i. with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction, followed by
reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia
virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA,
USA) and oligo(dT). The UL15 coding sequence was
amplified by PCR using the resultant cDNA and the
synthetic oligonucleotide UL15f as the forward primer
and UL15r as the reserve primer (Table 2). BamHI and
HindIII enzyme sites were incorporated into the forward
and reverse primer, respectively. In order to verify the
splice junction of the UL15 transcript, primers Psjf and
Psjr (Table 2) were used to amplify the splice junction
from the cDNA. Psjf is homologous to a sequence from
exon I, 428 bp upstream from the predicted splice junction and Psjr is antisense to a sequence from exon II,
located at a distance of 358 bp from the predicted splice
junction. The resultant RT-PCR product was then

cloned into the pMD18-T cloning vector (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China) and confirmed by sequencing. For kinetic
class analysis of UL15 gene, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide
(CHX; Sigma-Aldrich, MA, USA) or 300 μg/ml phosphonoacetic acid (PAA; Sigma-Aldrich, MA, USA) was
added to the medium 1 h before infection and maintained at this level for 6 h and 12 h, respectively. Samples with no metabolic inhibitor served as the control.
RT-PCR was then carried out with the same primers as
those used for the splice junction analysis with chicken
b-actin mRNA as the internal control.
Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogeny

Amino acid sequences of terminase orthologues from
herpesviruses and bacteriophages were retrieved from
the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) within the
ExPASy proteomics server (http://www.expasy.ch/).
Sequences were aligned using the ClastalW2 multiple
sequence alignment program with the GONNET 250
scoring matrix [42]. The sequences are as follows: DEV
(UniProtKB accession code C6ZD26), HSV-1(P04295),
HCMV (P16732), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, P03219), bacteriophage T4 (P17312), bacteriophage P7 (Q5XLR0)
and bacteriophage HK97 (Q9MCT1).
For phylogenetic characterization of DEV within Herpesviridae with respect to the UL15 protein, a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid
sequences of 23 deduced UL15 orthologues (Table 3) was
constructed. Briefly, A PHYLIP format-output alignment
was generated with the ClustalW2 program, with which a
phylogram was computed and constructed using PhyML
(version 3.0) software with the LG amino acid substitution
model. An approximate likelihood ratios test (aLRT)
as well as a non-parametric bootstrap support test
(100 replicates) was used for phylogenetic tree evaluation.
SeaView 4 was used for displaying and editing phylogenetic trees [43].
Northen blot

Approximately 20 μg of total RNA extracted from DEVinfected CEF cells was fractionated by electrophoresis in
a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto a positively
charged nylon membrane (Immobilon™-Ny+, Millipore,
MA, USA) by capillary blotting. A DIG High Prime
DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit I (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was used for
probe labeling and northern blot hybridization according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, an 898 bp
DNA fragment covering the UL15 splice junction site
was amplified by RT-PCR using primers P898f and
P898r (Table 2). In addition, the UL15 RT-PCR product
was digested Bgl II, generating a C-terminus of 696 bp.
These DNA fragments were purified, labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-11-dUTP and designated P898, and PC696,

in DIG Easy Hyb buffer followed by hybridization overnight with about 100 ng/ml labeled probes. Two 5 min
stringency washes with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS were performed at room temperature, followed by two 15 min
washes in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C. The hybridized
probes were immunodetected with anti-digoxigeninalkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate and were then
visualized with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP). The size of the mRNA
was calculated via the RNA size standard.

treated RNA using the 5’ RACE primer and gene-specific primers P15-5 for UL15 and P15.5-5 for UL15.5
(Table 2). The polyadenylation cleavage site of the
transcripts was determined with a 3’-Full RACE Kit
(TaKaRa, Dalian, China). RT was done on the total
RNA with the 3’ RACE adaptor prior to the PCR reaction with the 3’ RACE Outer Primer and gene-specific
primer P15-3 (Table 2). Occasionally, nested PCR was
used for poorly amplified products following the manufacturer’s recommendation. The RACE PCR products
were cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China), and the inserts were analyzed by sequencing.

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)

The 5’-end sequences of UL15 and UL15.5 transcripts
were mapped from the purified mRNA with a 5’-Full
RACE Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Briefly, total RNA
was isolated from DEV-infected CEF cells with an E.Z.
N.A™ Mag-Bind mRNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, GA,
USA), followed by mRNA purification using the MagBind oligo(dT) magnetic beads supplied with the kit.
About 250 ng of the purified mRNA was treated with
calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) and tobacco
acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) followed by ligation with
the 5’ RACE adaptor. RT-PCR was performed with the

Antibodies

To produce UL15-specific antiserum, a Bgl II and Hind III
digested encoding the C-terminal 232 amino acids of
UL15 exon II was inserted into the corresponding sites
downstream from the T7 promotor of the pET-30a vector
(Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The recombinant
plasmid, designated pET-UL15C232, was transformed into
Escherichia coli competent cells BL21 (DE3). His6-tagged
protein was expressed induced with 0.6 mM isopropyl-bd-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were then harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 3,000 × g. The pellet

Zhu et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:156
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/156

was solubilized, followed by binding to Ni-nitrilotriacetic
acid agarose beads (Invitrogen, CA, USA), extensive washing and elution, and the eluted protein was renatured by
dialysis. Finally, two male New Zealand white rabbits
(Laboratory Animals Center, Harbin Veterinary Research
Institute, Harbin, China) were immunized intramuscularly
with the purified protein. Serum samples were collected
when the ELISA titer reached 1:104. Mouse monoclonal
antibody (McAb) 1B5, raised against DEV UL19 (VP5),
was prepared in our laboratory previously. Mouse anti-b
actin antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St.
Louis, MO, USA).
Plasmid construction and transfection

The intronless UL15 RT-PCR fragment carrying BamH
I and Hind III sites was cloned into the pET-30a vector
(Merck KGaA, Germany), giving plasmid pET-UL15.
BamH I/Not I double digestion of pET-UL15 released
the full-length UL15 ORF, which was cloned directionally into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen, CA, USA)
under the control of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV)
promoter, generating plasmid pcDNA-UL15. Transient
expression of the UL15 gene product was achieved in
CEF cells transfected with pcDNA-UL15. Briefly, cells
that grew on a coverslip placed into a 6-well culture
plate (Corning, NY, USA) were transfected with 0.5 μg
of plasmid using the Effectene Transfection Reagent
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). UL15 expression was analyzed 24-48 h post transfection (h p. t.) with western
blot and indirect immunofluorescence assay.
Western blot

CEF cells were infected with DEV clone-03 in the
presence or in the absence of CHX or PAA. Otherwise,
CEF cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA-UL15
or pcDNA3.1 (+) plasmid in 6-well cell culture plates. At
different time points, cells were washed twice with PBS
then treated with cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH
8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min. After centrifugation
at 4°C, cell lysates were mixed with 5 × SDS sample buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 5% b-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue), boiled
for 5 min and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE). Fractionated proteins were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore,
MA, USA), after which the membrane was incubated in
blocking solution (0.1% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat dry
milk in PBS) at 4°C overnight, followed by reaction for
1 h at room temperature with the antibodies in appropriate dilution (1:200 for anti-UL15, 1:5,000 for anti-b
actin), washed extensively in PBST (0.1% Tween-20 in
PBS) followed by reaction for 2 h with 1:5000 diluted
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin

(Sigma-Aldrich, MA, USA). After several washes in PBST,
the bands were visualized by incubating the membrane in
freshly prepared DAB solution (2.5 mg of 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in 10 ml of Tris-HCl buffer,
pH 7.5) containing 0.03% H2O2.
Immunofluorescence

Secondary CEF cells were grown on Fluorodishes (WPI,
FL, USA.) and were either infected with DEV Clone-03
or transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA-UL15. At different
time point post-infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, MA, USA) for 20 min at
room temperature, followed by permeabilizing with 0.5%
Trixon X-100 for 10 min. For cells transfected with plasmids, this procedure was done at 24 h or 48 h posttransfection. After brief washing, cells were blocked in
10% horse serum to avoid high background levels, and
then incubated in 1:400 diluted UL15-specific antiserum
overnight at 4°C. The cells were rinsed extensively, and
then reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Sigma-Aldrich,
MA, USA) diluted 1:80. Nuclei were counter-stained with
4’-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich,
MA, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer.
Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed with
a Leica TCS SP5 microsystem (Leica, Mannheim,
Germany).
