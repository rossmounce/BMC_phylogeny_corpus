Abstract
Background: Mycobacterial pathogens are a major threat to humans. With the increasing
availability of functional genomic data, research on mycobacterial pathogenesis and subsequent
control strategies will be greatly accelerated. It has been suggested that genome polymorphisms,
namely large sequence polymorphisms, can influence the pathogenicity of different mycobacterial
strains. However, there is currently no database dedicated to mycobacterial genome
polymorphisms with functional interpretations.
Description: We have developed a mycobacterial database (MyBASE) housing genome
polymorphism data and gene functions to provide the mycobacterial research community with a
useful information resource and analysis platform. Whole genome comparison data produced by
our lab and the novel genome polymorphisms identified were deposited into MyBASE. Extensive
literature review of genome polymorphism data, mainly large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs),
operon predictions and curated annotations of virulence and essentiality of mycobacterial genes
are unique features of MyBASE. Large-scale genomic data integration from public resources makes
MyBASE a comprehensive data warehouse useful for current research. All data is cross-linked and
can be graphically viewed via a toolbox in MyBASE.
Conclusion: As an integrated platform focused on the collection of experimental data from our
own lab and published literature, MyBASE will facilitate analysis of genome structure and
polymorphisms, which will provide insight into genome evolution. Importantly, the database will
also facilitate the comparison of virulence factors among various mycobacterial strains. MyBASE is
freely accessible via http://mybase.psych.ac.cn.

Background
Mycobacteria are notorious for its two species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) and Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy,
respectively. In addition to M. tb and M. leprae, a number
of mycobacterial pathogens also cause human and animal
diseases, including Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), the
causative agent of classical bovine tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans), which causes Buruli
ulcers. The emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of
pathogenic mycobacteria has made the development of
better vaccines and new drugs and novel control strategies
a top priority.
The genome of M. tb H37Rv was the first mycobacterial
genome to be sequenced and was published in 1998 [1],
which was followed by the genome of M. leprae in 2001
[2]. The complete sequencing of these genomes greatly
contributed to the understanding of the unique physiology and pathogenesis of mycobacteria. With the development of DNA sequencing technologies in recent years, a
total of 18 complete mycobacterial genomes have been
available and deposited in public domains thus far. This
progress offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the virulence mechanisms of mycobacteria at the
molecular level, which offers insight into the development of potential control strategies.
One of the most significant findings in mycobacterial
research was from the genome-wide comparison between
virulent (e.g. M. tb H37Rv or M. bovis) and avirulent
strains (e.g. M. bovis BCG) [3]. This genomic comparison
unveiled large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs), usually
called regions of difference (RDs), which are believed to
be the major source of genomic diversity [4,5] and probably contribute to the phenotypic differences [6]. Some of
the LSPs/RDs have been shown be important for virulence
and pathogenicity. For example, RD1, which is deleted in
all BCG strains but is present in virulent strains of M. tb or
M. bovis, has been shown to be essential for M. tb virulence
[7-9]. The success of systematic genetic screening of mycobacterial mutants from different environments [10-13],
coupled with focused investigation into individual virulence genes, has contributed to the functional genomic
data of mycobacteria [14], which has provided useful
information in understanding the physiology and pathogenesis of this unique bacterial genus.
Currently, several public resources for mycobacterial
research are available, including the TB database [15],
which is an integrated platform of genomic data with special interest in microarray analysis; GenoList http://geno
list.pasteur.fr/, which focuses on the gene annotation of
six mycobacterial strains [16]; MycoDB from xBASE
[17,18], which provides search and visualization tools for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/40

genome comparison of mycobacteria; MycoperonDB
[19], which is a database of predicted operons in 5 mycobacterial species; MGDD [20], a mycobacterial genome
divergence database derived from an anchor-based comparison approach [21]; GenoMycDB [22], a database for
pair-wise comparison of six mycobacterial genomes; and
MtbRegList [23], which is dedicated to the analysis of
transcriptional regulation of M. tb. Although each of these
databases provides unique and useful information, none
are focused on LSPs, essential genes, and the relationship
between these and virulence. MyBASE was therefore
developed to meet these needs. In addition to providing a
platform for analyzing all published mycobacterial
genomes, MyBASE features important information on
genomic polymorphisms, virulence genes, and essential
genes. As such, MyBASE will help researchers to easily
explore and analyze data in a user-friendly and cross-referenced fashion, thereby facilitating functional genomic
studies. This will inevitably enhance our understanding
on the virulence mechanisms, genome structure, and
molecular evolution of mycobacteria.

Construction and content
Data sources and curation
MyBASE contains data from both our own experiments
and public resources. There are four main types of data: 1)
genome sequences with curated annotations, 2) genome
polymorphism data, particularly LSPs identified among
different mycobacterial genomes, 3) functional gene
annotations with a specific focus on virulence genes and
essential genes, and 4) predicted operons.

All complete genome sequences and original annotation
files were downloaded from NCBI ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/
genomes/Bacteria. Curations were made to clarify inconsistencies resulting from different annotations provided
by the original sequence providers. For Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) that were inconsistently designated [24], we refined the COGs using the algorithm
previously described [25].
We have recently used the NimbleGen tiling microarray
method for whole-genome comparison of 13 BCG strains
with subsequent confirmation by DNA re-sequencing
[26]. A total of 42 deletions were identified, four of which
are novel [26]. These novel deletions are believed to have
an impact on virulence or immunogenicity of the corresponding BCG strains [26]. All data and analytical results
were incorporated into MyBASE. In addition to our selfgenerated data, other polymorphism datasets, particularly
LSPs/RDs that were included in MyBASE were extracted
from public literatures. After the first usage of microarray
to study genome polymorphism in 1999 [3], a growing
trend emerged to generate systematic genome polymorphism data [27-29]. We performed an extensive literature

the gene of interest is found, users can check whether it is in a genomic polymorphic region, compare the selected genome

review to extract information about each LSP/RD from
original experiments. We found inconsistencies between
the nomenclature of LSPs (RDs) used by different groups
and so to avoid further confusion, we have kept the original nomenclature from each group. However, we have
provided the reference information and a hyperlink to the
PubMed entry for each LSP/RD dataset.
Virulence, essentiality and other functional annotations
of mycobacterial genes were extracted and corrected
through data mining of public resources [10-14,30]. Virulence of mycobacterial genes was evaluated by phenotypic
outcomes observed from animal and cellular models of
M. tb infections (e.g., mouse, guinea pig, macrophages,
etc.) for the corresponding mutants [14]. Recently, with
the success of genetic manipulation of mycobacterial
genes, a number of new virulence factors have been
uncovered [31-35]. Since the role of some of these genes
in pathogenesis are still in dispute [36,37], the annotations of experimental evidence for virulence have been
provided to facilitate further investigation.
Operons of mycobacterial genomes were predicted using
methods described by Alm et al. [38]. This method combines a comparative genomic approach with genome-specific distance models, and has shown some improvements
in operon prediction [39].
System design and implementation
MyBASE was developed using our established pipeline for
biological databases [40-44]. It consists of three hardware
components: a World Wide Web server, a database server,
and a server for sequence analysis. The system is based on
a MySQL relational database and the front end consists of
a set of JSP scripts running on a Tomcat web server. Hibernate, a high-performance object/relational persistence
and query service for Java, was used for system development. The search engine, Multi-genome Comparison
Viewer, was developed using Java. Genome Viewer was
implemented using CGView [45].

Utility and discussion
Database usage and the toolbox
All the data in MyBASE can be easily explored using the
toolbox. The keyword-based search engine enables a multiple keyword (e.g. gene name, COG number, etc.) search
across MyBASE, while the BLAST-based sequence search
engine allows user to quickly find similar genes to the
query.

LSP/RD data is a distinct feature of MyBASE. The Polymorphism-LSP/RD module was developed to explore and
mine the LSP/RD datasets. Users can search for a genomic
polymorphism region by its name (e.g. RD1), the name of
reference strain and query strain in the experiment, start/
end positions within its genome, or by literature informa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/40

tion. Users can also visualize the distributions of selected
RDs in the genome by using LSP/RD Viewer. RDs in the
same dataset are present in one solid line according to its
position along the genome (upper-left in Figure 1). Experimental information can be seen when users mouse over
the LSP/RD region. To keep the data content in MyBASE
most up-to-date, the "LSP/RD upload" module was
designed for the user to upload their own LSP/RD data to
MyBASE.
The Multi-genome Comparison Viewer (MCV) allows
users to rapidly align and compare mycobacterial genome
synteny by selecting an anchor gene of interest. This module is helpful for genome structure and evolutionary analysis of mycobacteria. Users can select any number of
genomes, zoom in or out and move upstream or downstream along the genome in the viewer. Genes in MCV
with the same color-coding are predicted homologs via
COG designation, while grey indicates that no homolog
was detected. More importantly, MCV also displays various featured annotations in MyBASE with different legends. Virulence factors, pseudogenes, and genes in an
operon or polymorphic region are all presented in this
graphic way. By clicking the gene, users can either reanchor the viewer with this gene or navigate to the
detailed gene information page.
Genome Viewer allows users to explore individual
genomes with customized featured annotations, which
include operons, LSPs/RDs, pseudogenes, and virulence
factors. In addition, users can visualize a particular segment of a genome by zooming in/out, rotating or defining
the start and end positions.
All data and tools in MyBASE are cross-linked. Users can
start from searching a particular gene, for example, esxA,
which is a virulence determinant that encodes a secretory
protein [6,46,47], and then search each functional module, including polymorphisms (LSPs/RDs) for related LSP
information. Furthermore, MCV and Genome Viewer can
be used to compare the genome structure among selected
genomes and to check other genomic features within the
corresponding segment, respectively. Using these tools,
we can see that esxA is located in RD1 and that its functional properties are represented by different legends.
Users may also begin from a polymorphism search and
then navigate to a gene page, MCV or Genome Viewer.
Overall, MyBASE forms a highly-integrated and inter-correlated platform for efficient utilization and exploration
of functional and comparative genomic data (Figure 1).
Future developments
The goal of MyBASE is to provide the mycobacterial
research community with a useful resource and analysis
platform for the functional and evolutionary investigation
of mycobacteria. Newly generated genomic data and funcPage 4 of 6

tional annotations by the research community will be
added to MyBASE periodically to keep the database up-todate. The functionality of the LSP search and viewer will
be enriched and enhanced. In addition, new tools, such as
software packages for phylogenomic study will be integrated. Finally, MyBASE also provides an opportunity for
the mycobacterial research community to standardize
nomenclature, data formats of gene, and polymorphism
annotations.
