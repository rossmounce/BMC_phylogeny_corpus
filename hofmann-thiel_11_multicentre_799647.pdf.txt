Mycobacteria assay for differentiation of
Mycobacterium spp. in clinical isolates

Abstract
Background: A new DNA line probe assay (Speed-oligo Mycobacteria, Vircell) has been launched for rapid
differentiation of Mycobacterium spp. from cultures. Compared to other line-probe assays, Speed-oligo
Mycobacteria covers a relatively limited spectrum of species but uses a simpler and faster dip-stick technique. The
present multi-centre, multi-country study aimed at evaluating the utility and usability of Speed-oligo Mycobacteria
in routine mycobacteriology diagnostics. Results from Speed-oligo Myobacteria were compared to those from
Genotype CM (HAIN lifescience, Nehren, Germany), another line-probe assay.
Methods: Speed-oligo Mycobacteria assay was performed in three main steps: 1) DNA extraction from cultured
material 2) PCR amplification of the target gene and an internal control and 3) hybridization of the PCR products
to specific probes by means of a dip-stick.
Results: Two hundred forty-two clinical isolates were recovered from consecutive positive mycobacterial cultures
at two German (IML Gauting, Bioscientia Ingelheim), one Czech (KLINLAB Prague), and at a Sudanese (Khartoum)
laboratory. All Mycobacterium species covered by the assay were reliably recognized. The rate of false positive
results was 1.2% and concerned only the species M. marinum and M. peregrinum. The identification rate, i.e. the
proportion of isolates which was correctly differentiated to the level of species or complex by the assay, differed
significantly among laboratories being 94.9%, 90.7%, and 75.0% at the study sites IML Gauting, KLINLAB Prague and
Bioscientia Ingelheim, respectively. This difference was caused by different spectra of NTM species encountered by
the laboratory centres in daily routine diagnostics.
Conclusions: Speed-oligo Mycobacteria assay was proved a rapid and easy-to-perform alternative to conventional
line-probe assays. The assay showed excellent sensitivity with regard to identification of genus Mycobacterium and
species/complexes covered by the test. However, due to its relatively limited spectrum of taxa, a varying
proportion of NTM may not be identified by the assay in daily diagnostics demanding further analyses. The only
significant shortcoming in terms of specificity was the misidentification of the clinically relevant species
M. marinum.

Background
Whereas tuberculosis (TB) still represents one of the
major public health problems in the non-industrialized
world, particularly in Africa, South/East-Asia and the
countries of the former Soviet-Union [1], its prevalence is
steadily declining in the fully industrialized world. Here

however, infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are becoming more and more relevant in
both, incidence and morbidity, partly due to the spread of
iatrogenic immunosuppression [2,3]. Since management,
treatment, and infection control measures differ dramatically between TB and NTM infections, a rapid and accurate differentiation between these entities is mandatory as
soon as a mycobacterial culture turns positive. Additionally, rapid identification of the most frequent NTM species
is desirable helping the clinical doctor to assess the relevance of the laboratory findings.

Most molecular genetic tests differentiating mycobacterial species fulfil this postulation including sequencing of
target genes like 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) [4,5], hsp65 gene
[6] or 16S-23S intergenic transcribed sequences (ITS) [7]
and commercial tests based on gene probes. Among the
commercial tests, the gene probe assay AccuProbe (GenProbe, San Diego) was the first one to be developed. The
limitation of this fast single-probe test is the relatively
small spectrum of Mycobacterium spp. [8,9]. With the
introduction of DNA line probe assays (LPA), the simultaneous differentiation of several mycobacterial species in
one single test has become possible. INNO-LiPA Mycobacteria v2 (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) and the GenoType Mycobacterium CM and AS (HAIN Lifesciences,
Nehren, Germany) are currently among the most widely
used LPAs. They have been evaluated extensively with different panels of mycobacterial species [8,10,12-15] and
proved easy-to-interpret, sensitive, specific, cost-effective,
and in excellent concordances with independent reference
methods such as sequence analyses of housekeeping
genes. On the other hand, they require higher turnaroundas well as hands-on-times than for example the Accuprobe
system.
Recently, a new LPA for the differentiation of mycobacterial species was introduced. The Speed - oligo Mycobacteria® assay (Vircell, Santa Fé Granada, Spain) uses PCR of
16S-23S ITS target sequences and subsequent hybridization to immobilized probes by means of a fast and easy dip
stick technique. It detects up to 12 different taxa represented by six specific probes on the strip covering a smaller
spectrum than other LPAs. A recent study assessed the
performance of the Speed-oligo Myobacteria assay from
cultures in a single laboratory in Spain [16] proving good
concordance (97.2%) to reference methods.
The spectrum and frequency of NTM may vary significantly between regions in Europe and the world [17-20]
having potential implications on the validity of the assay in
daily diagnostics. Therefore, a multi-centre and multicountry approach was initiated evaluating Speed-oligo
Mycobacteria for differentiation and identification of
Mycobacterium spp. from cultures in different settings of
routine mycobacteriology diagnostics.

Methods
Clinical isolates

Clinical isolates (n = 242) included in this study were
recovered from consecutive positive mycobacterial cultures originating from routine diagnostic services at four
laboratory centres after N-acetyl-cystein (NALC)-NaOH
decontamination. At the European centres IML Gauting,
Bioscientia Ingelheim (both Germany) and KLINLAB
Prague (Czech Republic), 59 (February-June 2010), 60
(June-September 2009), and 75 (February-July 2010) isolates, respectively, were obtained within the indicated

Page 2 of 7

time periods. At the laboratory in Khartoum (Sudan), 53
consecutive sputum samples from smear positive patients
(September-December 2009) were decontaminated using
(NALC)-NaOH [21], re-suspended in 1.0 ml phosphate
buffer (pH 6.8) and shipped to the IML Gauting for
growth detection using solid and fluid media (MGIT™,
Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Of these, 48
MGIT cultures turned positive with acid-fast bacilli and
were tested at the IML Gauting by the Sudanese coauthor.
Reference methods

All isolates were differentiated to the level of species by
routine differentiation methods. At all centres, Genotype
CM was the firstly used differentiation assay. In case of a
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) specific
band pattern, Genotype MTBC was performed. If Genotype CM yielded another species-specific band pattern the
resulting NTM species was assumed as correct–provided
that the identification result was in agreement with growth
characteristics and morphology of the isolate-and no
further tests were performed. If only genus Mycobacterium
was identified, Genotype CM was followed by Genotype
AS at study sites Bioscientia Ingelheim and KLINLAB Prague, and if necessary partial 16S rDNA sequencing, or
directly subjected to sequencing at study site IML Gauting.
Two Nocardia spp. were not differentiated to the level of
species. In cases of discrepant results by Genotype and
Speed-oligo assays, the isolate was re-assessed by sequencing for definite species identification.
Speed-oligo mycobacteria assay

For DNA extraction, a loop-full of bacteria from Loewenstein-Jensen (LJ) slant culture or bacterial sediments from
1 ml of liquid media were re-suspended in 300 μl Vircell
sample solution and incubated at 95°C for 60 min. After
centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g, the lysates were
directly used for PCR or stored frozen at − 20°C. For PCR
amplification, 15 μl of reconstituted ready-to-use PCR mix
(provided with the kit) was added to PCR tubes in a DNAfree and PCR amplicon-free pre-amplification area. Then,
10 μl of DNA sample was added and PCR amplification
(1 min 92°C, 40 cycles consisting of 10 s 92°C, 30 s 55°C,
30 s 72°C, 1 min 72°C) was started. The PCR product was
denaturated for 1 min at 95°C and immediately cooled on
ice for no more than 1 min. Then, 5 μl of PCR product
was added to 40 μl of pre-heated (55°C) running solution
in a 1.5 ml tube (post-amplification area). The Speed-oligo
strip was immediately inserted and results could be interpreted after 5 min of incubation at 55°C. Results were considered valid, when both internal control lines (PCL,
product control line; PCRCL, PCR control line) were positive. Speed-oligo Mycobacteria includes six specific probes
(TL1 to TL6) allowing for the identification of members of

Hofmann-Thiel et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:353
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/353

the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) (TL4) and frequently
encountered NTMs, i.e. M. avium/M. intracellulare/
M. scrofulaceum group (TL5), M. chelonae/M. abscessus
complex (TL1), M. kansasii (TL3), M. gordonae (TL2),
and M. fortuitum (TL6), each of them yielding individual
patterns (Table 1). According to the manufacturer, members of the MTBC can show weak TL3 signals in addition
to the MTBC specific TL4 probe. A genus specific probe
(TL7) additionally allowed for the identification of the
genus Mycobacterium.

Results
Two hundred forty-two clinical isolates were included in
the study (Table 2). They originated from four laboratory
centres, two in Germany, one in the Czech Republic, and
one in the Sudan. The reference methods used identified
77 isolates (31.8%) as members of the MTBC, 162 (66.9%)
as NTM and three (1.2%) as species of related genera (two
Nocardia spp., one Tsukamurella pulmonis).
Sensitivity and false results

Speed-oligo Mycobacteria yielded valid results for all 242
study isolates. Two hundred seventeen isolates (89.7%)
belonged to species covered by specific Speed-oligo
probes. They yielded the expected patterns and showed
complete concordance to the reference method (Table 2).
Twenty-five isolates belonged to species not covered by
specific Speed-oligo probes. Twenty-two of them (88.0%)
yielded correct results, i.e. 19 NTM isolates were identified
as Mycobacterium spp. and three isolates from other genera did not react with any TL probe.
Three NTM isolates (1.2%, one from each European
study site) yielded unspecific Speed-oligo signals leading
to misidentifications: two M. peregrinum isolates showed a
weak reaction with TL6 probe and were thus misidentified
as M. fortuitum; one M. marinum isolate reacted with
TL3 probe and was thus misidentified as M. kansasii.
Overall, the sensitivity of Speed-oligo Mycobacteria–
defined as the proportion of correct identifications of
isolates belonging to taxa for which the assay possesses
specific probes–was 100% for the genus specific probe

Page 3 of 7

TL7 (239 of 239 isolates) and 100% for the species/complex specific probes TL1-6 (217 of 217 isolates). The
rate of false results–defined as the proportion of test
outcomes leading to misidentifications of species–was
1.2% for species/complex specific probes (3 of 242
isolates).
Identification rate

Speed-oligo Mycobacteria identified the species/complex
of 217 out of 242 clinical isolates (89.7%). The spectrum of
mycobacterial species and consequently the outcome of
Speed-oligo Mycobacteria varied significantly from study
site to study site (Table 2). At IML Gauting and KLINLAB
Prague, 95.5% and 85.4%, respectively, of NTM isolates
belonged to species which were covered by Speed-oligo
probes. At Bioscientia Ingelheim this proportion was only
70%. Among Sudanese samples, it was 100% since the
only NTM species found was M. fortuitum which is covered by Speed-oligo Mycobacteria. Consequently, the
Speed-oligo identification rate, i.e. the proportion of clinical isolates differentiated to the level of species or complex, was relatively poor at Bioscientia Ingelheim (45 of 60
clinical isolates, 75.0%), good at KLINLAB Prague (68 of
75, 90.7%) and at IML Gauting (56 of 59, 94.9%) but excellent for the Sudanese isolates (48 of 48, 100.0%).
Comparison to results of Genotype CM

At all study sites, Genotype CM was used as primary
method for differentiation as soon as a mycobacteriological culture turned positive. Therefore, Genotype CM
results were available for all study isolates and allowed us
to compare them directly to Speed-oligo results (Table 2).
Of 77 MTBC isolates, all yielded identical results with
both assays. Further differentiation to the species level (76
MTB, one M. bovis BCG) confirmed the identifications by
both assays.
Concordance of the assays was 98.7% with respect to
140 NTM isolates belonging to species covered by
Speed-oligo Mycobacteria except the following two discrepancies: Genotype CM did not identify the species of
one M. intracellulare and one M. kansasii isolate and

the species level by Genotype CM whereas 58 of 140 isolates were only assigned to groups or complexes of species by Speed-oligo Mycobacteria.
Twenty-two NTM isolates belonged to species not
included in Speed-oligo Mycobacteria. Eleven of them were
differentiated to the species level by Genotype CM yielding
M. xenopi (n = 7), M. malmoense (n = 1), M. marinum (n =
1), and M. peregrinum (n = 2). The remaining NTM isolates belonged to the taxa M. celatum, M. flavescens,
M. montefiorense, M. lentiflavum and M. simiae and were
identified neither by Genotype CM nor by Speed-oligo
Mycobacteria.
Overall, Genotype CM would have been theoretically
able to differentiate 228 out of 242 isolates. However, it
differentiated 226 of them correctly resulting in a sensitivity of 98.7% (Speed-oligo: 100%). None of the Genotype
CM tests performed lead to misidentification of the species being better than that of Speed-oligo Mycobacteria.
Genotype CM yielded identification rates of 97.3% (73 of
75 isolates), 94.9% (56 of 59 isolates), and 81.7% (49 of 60
isolates), at KLINLAB Prague, IML Gauting, and Bioscientia Ingelheim, respectively.
Evaluation of work processes and time required

Speed-oligo Mycobacteria has been assessed as easy to
perform by the laboratory staff at each of the European
centres. In particular, the availability of a ready-to-use
PCR mix as well as the dip-stick technique was considered
a significant simplification of laboratory work processes.
At the IML Gauting the total assay time of Speed-oligo
Mycobacteria (when handling five strains) was measured
to 3 h composed of 1 h 10 min for DNA extraction, 10
min for pre-PCR steps, 1 h 30 min for PCR amplification
and 10 min for hybridization by dip-stick technique.
Cumulative hands-on-time was estimated to 25 min.

Discussion
Speed-oligo Myobacteria has been developed for the
rapid differentiation of mycobacterial species from cultures. Its major advantage consists in its simple dip stick

technique which is directly applied to denaturized
amplification products. The dip stick procedure is easy
to perform requiring only two pipetting steps thereby
decreasing the hands-on time as well as the risk of
cross-contaminations. Results can be obtained within
about 3 h with a total hands-on time of 25 min. By
comparison, the line probe assays Genotype Mycobacteria CM/AS and INNO-LiPA Mycobacteria require a
total time of 5-6 h with hands-on times of about 2 h
[8,13,22].
One of the major limitations of Speed-oligo Mycobacteria is that it differentiates only a relatively small spectrum of Mycobacterium species. This gives rise to lower
identification rates compared to similar LPAs like Genotype CM depending on regional differences regarding the
spectrum of encountered NTM species. Among our four
study centres, identification rates varied significantly. We
observed the best identification rate with the Sudanese
samples due to the fact that M. fortuitum was the only
NTM species found. Generally, M. fortuitum is considered one of the most frequent contaminants recovered
from clinical [23] and environmental specimens [24] in
Africa. Our Sudanese sputa were transported for approximately 1 week before they reached our laboratory. Probably, some of them were overgrown by M. fortuitum
during shipment biasing the species distribution in this
panel. Considering European laboratories, Speed-oligo
Mycobacteria showed a good identification rate of 94.9%
with isolates from IML Gauting being in the range
reported for INNO LiPA or Genotype CM assays in the
literature (88-96%) [13,22,25] and identical to that shown
for Genotype CM in the present study. By contrast, identification rates of Speed-oligo Mycobacteria decreased to
90.7% at KLINLAB Prague and 75% at Bioscientia Ingelheim while the rates of Genotype CM were significantly
better at these sites (97.3% and 81.7%). This was mainly
due to the species M. xenopi which is not covered by
Speed-oligo Mycobacteria. M. xenopi is increasingly
encountered throughout the world [17,18,20] reaching
relative frequencies of up to 26% of NTM isolates [20]. In
order to meet the demands of an identification system
covering the most frequent mycobacterial species,

Hofmann-Thiel et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:353
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/353

incorporation of a M. xenopi specific probe should be
considered by the manufacturer.
Compared to other line-probe assays, Speed-oligo Mycobacteria differentiates most of the species only to a level of
complexes or groups. Current guidelines do not demand
the differentiation of the species M. avium and M. intracellulare, although the discrimination to M. scrofulaceum
would be desirable [26]. However, the differentiation
between M. chelonae and M. abscessus is considered essential for decisions on the optimal regimen if treatment is
necessary.
Overall, all species included in the Speed-oligo Mycobacteria assay were reliably identified and yielded the
expected patterns. Among these isolates, Genotype CM
failed to identify one M. intracellulare and one M. kansasii
isolate. The latter showed an unspecific Genotype pattern
(bands 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 13) and was attributed to M. kansasii
sequevar VI-3 by sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA; this
sequevar of M. kansasii had been previously described to
be missed by Genotype CM [14]. Partial 16S rDNA
sequencing of the M. intracellulare isolate showed identity
to M. avium complex ATCC 35770 strain sequences corresponding to M. intracellulare serovar 18/MAC D [27].
Phylogenetically, M. intracellulare serovar 18 forms a
rather unique 16S rDNA pattern [28] and appears to be
only rarely isolated from human specimens [29]. To our
best knowledge, there are no published data regarding performance of Genotype CM.
Speed-oligo Mycobacteria yielded only three out of 242
isolates (1.2%) with false positive reactions. Cross-reaction
of M. peregrinum with TL6 has not been described so far
but can be explained by the relatedness of M. peregrinum
and M. fortuitum which both belong to the M. fortuitum
complex. Cross-reaction of M. marinum with the TL3
probe is in concordance with the observation by QuezelGuerraz et al. [16] and is already mentioned in the user’s
manual by Vircell Microbiologists. Potential misidentification of M. marinum as M. kansasii is certainly the major
shortcoming of the assay. M. marinum regionally reaches
relative frequencies of up to 2% of NTM isolates [17,19].
Although infection due to M. marinum clinically presents
with characteristic cuteneous lesions, misidentification
may cause confusion and unnecessary delay of definite
diagnosis.

Conclusions
Our aim was a multi-centre, multi-country evaluation of
Speed-oligo Mycobacteria to differentiate Mycobacterium
spp. from cultures. Two hundred forty-two clinical isolates
obtained at four laboratory centres were included. The
Speed-oligo Mycobacteria assay was found to represent a
rapid and easy-to-perform alternative to conventional lineprobe assays for laboratories that do not need to differentiate all NTM isolates to the species level. The test is very

Page 6 of 7

reliable recognizing species that are covered by specific
probes on the dip-stick. The rate of false positive reactions
among 242 isolates was as low as 1.2%. However, due to
the more limited spectrum of species covered by the assay,
a varying proportion of NTM in the diagnostic services
may not be identified. In some settings the differentiation
down to the species level might be required demanding
additional analyses.
