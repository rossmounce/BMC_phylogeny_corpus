Abstract
Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype appears to show varying geographic distribution.
Molecular epidemiological study of HBV in particular areas in Indonesia is still limited. This study
was aimed to identify the prevalence of HBV genotype/subgenotype and mutations in basal core
promoter (BCP) region in voluntary blood donors in Makassar, one of the biggest cities in east part
of Indonesia.
A total of 214 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive samples were enrolled in this study. HBV
genotype/subgenotype was identified by genotype-specific PCR method or direct sequencing of
pre-S region. Mutations in BCP were identified by direct sequencing of the corresponding region.
Results: HBV/B and HBV/C were detected in 61.21% and 25.23% of the samples, while mix of
HBV/B and HBV/C was found in 12.62% of the samples. Based on pre-S region, among HBV/B and
HBV/C, HBV/B3 (95.00%) and HBV/C1 (58.82%) were predominant. Interestingly, HBV/D was
identified in two samples (22.165.07 and 22.252.07). Complete genome sequences of two HBV/D
strains (22.165.07 and 22.252.07) demonstrated that both strains belong to HBV/D6, and the
divergence between the two strains were 1.45%, while divergences of both 22.165.07 and
22.252.07 strains with reference strain (AM422939/France) were 2.67%. A1762T/G1764A
mutation was observed in 1.96% and 5.36%, whereas T1753V mutation was found in 2.94% and
1.79% of HBV/B and HBV/C, respectively.
Conclusion: HBV/B and HBV/C are dominant in Makassar, similar to most areas in Indonesia.
Mutations in BCP which might be associated with severity of liver disease are less common.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health problem leading to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Approximately, two billion people in the world

have been infected by HBV [1]. The majority of acute HBV
infections are self-limiting, whereas chronic HBV infection can cause chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. It is well known that Indonesia has a

moderate to high endemicity of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection [2], due to the lack of proper health facilities or
poor economical status and less public awareness.
HBV, a member of the Hepadnaviridae, is a relaxed circular
double-stranded DNA virus, and is currently classified
into eight genotypes (A-H) based on a comparison of the
entire HBV genomic sequence [3]. HBV genotypes appear
to show varying geographic distribution. For instance,
HBV/A is prevalent in Europe, Africa, and India [4,5].
HBV/B and HBV/C are predominant in most part of Asia,
including China and Japan [4,6]. The HBV/D is common
in the Mediterranean area, the Middle East and India,
whereas the HBV/E is localized in sub-Saharan Africa [410]. The HBV/F and HBV/H is only identified in Central
and South America [4,11-13]. The HBV/G has been found
in France, Germany and United States [14-16].
Molecular epidemiological studies of HBV, either a
nationwide study or study on particular areas in Indonesia, have shown that HBV/B and HBV/C are the most prevalent genotypes in Indonesia [2,17-20], although HBV/A
and HBV/D have also been found in Eastern Indonesia,
such as Moluccas and Papua [19,20]. Particularly in South
Moluccas, the prevalence of HBV/D is high, ranging from
50–88% [20]. In the same study, analysis of 12 samples
from Makassar demonstrated that only genotype B and C
were found in the samples [20]. To date, there is no comprehensive study about HBV genotype prevalence as well
as the genetic analysis of HBV circulated in Makassar. In
this study, we have analyzed HBV genotype/subgenotype
and mutations in BCP region from voluntary blood
donors in Makassar, which is located in Wallace territory
and the biggest city in Eastern Indonesia.

Methods
Samples
Serum samples from 214 blood donors (age 18–64 years,
mean 30.9 ± 10.3 years, male/female 153/61) which were
positive for HBsAg were collected in the Blood Transfusion Unit, Red Cross Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, between February and August 2007. HBsAg was
determined by commercially available kit (AxSYM®
HBsAg, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA). Blood
samples were separated into sera and stored at -70°C until
use. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethic
Committee and informed consent was obtained from
each donor.
Viral DNA extraction and genotyping
HBV DNA was extracted from 200 μl serum using
QIAamp® DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and
50 μl eluted DNA was stored at -70°C until use. HBV genotyping was performed by PCR using genotype specific

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/128

primers as described by Naito et al. [21]. To avoid falsepositive results, instruction to prevent cross-contaminations were strictly followed, and results considered valid
only when they were obtained in duplicate. Pre-S region
was amplified by nested PCR using PCR Core System
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and two sets of primers as
previously described with minor modifications [22]. The
first round PCR was performed for 35 cycles of 95°C for 1
min, 46.7°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min. The second
round PCR was carried out similar to the first round PCR,
except with an annealing temperature of 44.6°C. Primers
PS1/PS2 and PS3/PS4 were used for the first and second
rounds PCR, respectively. The PCR products were purified
with Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA), directly sequenced employing an ABI
3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster
City, CA, USA) with the Big Dye Terminator V3.1 Cycle
Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using primers
P3 and P4. Multiple alignments of pre-S sequences were
done using the CLUSTAL W method [23]. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed using Neighbor-Joining method
[24] with Kimura's two-parameter [25] and 1,000 replicates of bootstrap resampling as implemented in MEGA
4.1 [26]. Subgenotypes were assigned as described previously [19,27,28].
Full sequencing of HBV genotype D
The complete genome of HBV was amplified as 7 overlapping fragments (fragment 1–7) using nested-PCR with Go
Taq PCR Core System (Promega). The list of primers and
PCR products are shown in Table 1. First and second
round PCR were performed for 35 cycles with same condition except for annealing temperature. The condition
was as follow: denaturation at 95°C (5 min), annealing at
48.1–57.4°C (30 s) for the first round and 46.1–57.4°C
(30 s) for the second round, and elongation at 72°C (1
min). PCR product was purified from agarose gel using
Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega),
according to manufacturer's protocol, and directly
sequenced. Percentage divergence of nucleotide sequences
among HBV genotype D strain was calculated using
MEGA 4.1 [26]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed similarly as in the pre-S sequences.
BCP Mutations analysis
BCP region was amplified by hemi-nested PCR using
HBPr86/HBPr7 and HBPr87/HBPr 7 for two rounds PCR
as previously described, with a slightly modified touchdown PCR [15]. The following cycling parameters were
used for PCR: denaturation at 95°C (30 s), annealing at
60.5–53.5°C (30 s) and elongation at 72°C (30 s). For the
first 15 cycles, the annealing temperature was 60.5°C; this
temperature was then reduced by 0.5°C per cycle, and
continued with constant annealing temperature for
another 30 cycles. The first and second rounds PCR were

found in one sample. From HBV genotyping based on
both genotype-specific PCR and pre-S sequence on 214
blood donors, it was shown that HBV/B was predominant
(131 samples, 61.21%), followed by HBV/C (54 samples,
25.23%), mix of HBV/B and HBV/C (27 samples,
12.62%), and HBV/D (2 samples, 0.93%) (Table 2).

Results

Full sequence of HBV genotype D
Since HBV/D is rare in this area, we interested to analyze
the complete genome of the two HBV/D strains
(22.165.07 and 22.252.07) found in the samples. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome, partial S, and pre-C/
C regions confirmed that the two viruses were HBV/D6
(Fig. 2). Percentage divergences of complete genome, preS/S, X, pre-C/C, and Pol genes among the two strains were
1.45%, 1.45%, 1.40%, 0.43%, and 2.19%, respectively.
Based on the complete genome, divergences of 22.165.07
strain with reference strains, AM422939 (France),
AB493846 (Papua), and AB493845 (Papua) were 2.67%,
1.44% and 2.03%, respectively (Table 3). Similarly,
another strain (22.252.07) showed 2.67%, 1.18%, and
1.90% divergences with those three reference strains.
Based on each gene, the two present strains demonstrated
high identity with AB493846 (Papua) in X genes, with
identity of 99.57–100.00%, but less homology with

HBV genotype prevalence
Of the 214 subjects enrolled in this study, 156 samples
(72.90%) could be genotyped by genotype-specific PCR,
whereas 58 samples (27.10%) could not. Based on this
method, it was found that 91 samples (58.33%) were
HBV/B, 37 samples (23.72%) were HBV/C, 27 samples
(17.31%) were mix of HBV/B and HBV/C, and one sample (0.64%) was HBV/D (Table 2). For 58 samples that
could not be identified by genotype-specific PCR, the preS region was amplified and directly sequenced. Of 58 samples, 40 samples (68.97%) were HBV/B, and 38 of those
HBV/B (95.00% of HBV/B or 65.52% of all samples) were
HBV/B3 and the other two isolates were HBV/B5 (Fig. 1,
Table 2). Seventeen (29.31%) of 58 samples were HBV/C,
which was divided into HBV/C1 (58.82% of HBV/C or
17.24% of all samples) and HBV/C2 (41.18% of HBV/C
or 12.07% of all samples). In addition, HBV/D was only

only 95.62% identity (Table 3).
Genetic variation in BCP region
In order to find out specific nucleotide substitution
among HBV in the subjects, BCP region was analyzed. Of
214 samples, 169 were positive for PCR and sequencing,
however 9 samples could not be analyzed due to incomplete data. BCP sequence of HBV/B (102 samples), HBV/
C (56 samples), and HBV/D (2 samples) were respectively
aligned. It was observed that overall nucleotide substitution was rarely occurred in all genotypes. Double mutation (A1762T/G1764A), one of significant mutations
associated with advanced liver disease including HCC,
was only found in 1.96% (2/102) of HBV/B (Fig. 3). Likewise, the double mutation was only observed in 5.36%
(3/56) of HBV/C (Fig. 3). Analysis of nucleotide at position 1753 showed that a T-to-V (A/G/C) mutation, which
also suggested having association with liver disease progression, was found as much as 2.94% (3/102) and 1.79%
(1/56) in HBV/B and HBV/C, respectively. None of these
mutations was identified in HBV/D (Fig. 3). However, a
G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 1896, which prevents
the production of HBeAg by introducing a premature stop
codon into the open reading frame of the pre-C region,
was found in both strains of HBV/D (data not shown).

Discussion
The present study demonstrates that HBV/B (61.21%) and
HBV/C (25.23%) were the most prevalent among HBsAgpositive blood donors in Makassar, South Sulawesi,
although HBV/D was also rarely found in the samples.
Analysis of pre-S sequence of 58 samples revealed that in
HBV/B the percentage of HBV/B3 was much higher than
HBV/B5. In HBV/C, on the other hand, HBV/C1 and HBV/
C2 were detected with similar frequency.
HBV/B3 is widely distributed in Indonesia, but has not
been reported in other countries, suggesting that HBV/B3

is indigenous to Indonesia [20]. The HBV types we found
in Makassar are similar to those reported in previous studies from several areas in Indonesia [2,17-19], but the frequencies are different to Papua and Moluccas in where
HBV/C is more dominant [19,20]. In addition, no HBV/A
was found in Makassar, although it was found in Balikpapan and Kupang [20].
Several studies have reported the prevalence of HBV genotype from blood donors in the southern Asian region. A
study from Thailand demonstrated that HBV/A, HBV/B
and HBV/C were detected among blood donors, where
HBV/C (89.3%) was the most prevalent compared to
HBV/B (7.4%) and HBV/A (0.5%) [29]. Although this
study did not identify the subgenotype, complete genome
analysis of HBV/C from Thailand and some other countries which are geographically close to Indonesia such as
Vietnam and Myanmar showed that most of HBV/C was
classified into HBV/C1 [28], whereas in Makassar HBV/C1
and HBV/C2 were dominant. On the other hand, analysis
of asymptomatic HBV carriers from the Philippines
showed that the prevalence of HBV/B, HBV/C, HBV/D,
mix of HBV/B and HBV/D, and HBV/A were 53.4, 21.4,
14.3, 7.1, and 3.6%, respectively [30]. In general, the percentage of HBV/B in the Philippines was similar to that in
Makassar, although it is not possible to compare the subgenotypes with the available data. However, all HBV/C
strains in the Philippines samples were classified into
HBV/C5, which is different with subgenotypes circulated
in Makassar (HBV/C1 and HBV/C2). A study from Malaysia using small number of healthy blood donors and
chronic hepatitis B carriers demonstrated that HBV/C,
HBV/B, and HBV/D were identified in the samples [31],
which is quite similar to our findings in Makassar.
Studies from India demonstrated that the distribution of
HBV genotype in blood donors was slightly different
between Eastern and Southern India. In Eastern India,
beside the major HBV genotypes transmitted in India such

as HBV/D (56.0%) and HBV/A (20.6%), quite high percentage of HBV/C (23.4%) was also found in the blood
donors [32]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that those
HBV/C strains that clustered with HBV/C found in SouthEast Asia including Indonesia were classified as HBV/C1
[32]. On the other hand, in Southern India, only HBV/D
(76.11%) and HBV/A (11.94%) were detected [33], similar to the HBV genotype distribution pattern in Northern
and Western India [5].
In China, HBV/C was detected in high percentage (68.0%)
from blood donors along with HBV/B (25.8%), HBV/A
(2.1%) and mix HBV/B and HBV/C (4.1%), although the

subgenotype was not identified in this study [34]. Thus, in
general, the distribution of HBV genotype from blood
donors in Makassar is different to that in India and China.
Prior to our study, in Indonesia HBV/D has only previously been found in Papua and Moluccas [19,20]. Therefore, we were interested to analyze the complete genome
of the two HBV/D strains (22.165.07 and 22.252.07)
found in our samples from Makassar. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome, partial S, and pre-C/C regions
confirmed that the two HBV/D strains were subgenotype
D6 (Fig. 2). The present HBV/D strains were then compared with two references recently published from Papua

(AB493846 and AB493846) and one reference which
found in France (AM422939). Based on the complete
genome, divergences between the present strains and
Papua strains (HBV/D6) were lower than the divergence
between the two strains and France strain (HBV/D3) (Fig.
2). Thus, it is confirmed that the HBV/D found in Makassar was the same with the HBV/D strains present in Papua
(HBV/D6) [19]. Because a previous study found HBV/D
strains in Moluccas were HBV/D1 and HBV/D3 [20], it is
possible that the HBV/D found in Makassar has been
imported from Papua, not Moluccas, even though Moluccas is very close to Makassar.

also host factors, and therefore needs further investigation.

Conclusion
HBV/B and HBV/C are dominant in Makassar, similar
with the HBV genotype distribution in most areas in Indonesia. Mutations in BCP which might be associated with
severity of liver disease are less common.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Authors' contributions
Many studies have demonstrated that HBV mutations,
including mutations in BCP region, are linked with the
severity and outcome of HBV infection [35-37]. Our
recent data also revealed that mutations in BCP were associated with clinical outcome of liver disease [38]. We
therefore looked for mutations in the BCP region. Double
mutation (A1762T/G1764A) was only found in 1.96% of
HBV/B (Fig. 3). Likewise, the double mutation was only
observed in 5.36% of HBV/C (Fig. 3). Analysis of the
nucleotide at position 1753 showed that a T-to-V (A/G/C)
mutation, which has also been associated with HCC
development [39], was found to be less frequent in both
HBV/B and HBV/C (2.94% and 1.79, respectively). None
of these mutations was identified in HBV/D (Fig. 3).
Hence, our results demonstrated that the frequency of
mutations in BCP in blood donors in Makassar was low.
In our previous study, we included 15 HBV-associated
liver disease samples from Makassar [38], and found that
the prevalence of T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations were 40.0% and 60.0%, respectively, suggesting that
those mutations were associated with severity of liver disease. Since both T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations
were less common in blood donors, the chance of developing severe liver disease might be relatively low in the
blood donors in Makassar.
In comparison, a study from Indian blood donors showed
that the occurrence of double mutation in BCP was
extremely high in HBV/C (72.4%) and relatively high in
HBV/A (24.1%) and HBV/D (21.5%) [32]. Another study
also reported that K130M and V131I substitutions, which
are corresponding to double mutation in BCP, from
Indian inactive carrier were generally high (36.0%) [40].
However, they found that the occurrence of other mutations suggested to have associated with HCC was low [40].
If BCP mutation is strongly associated with clinical outcome of liver disease including HCC, the incidence of
HCC must be high in India. In fact, the HCC incidence
was very low in India [41], thus the association of BCP
mutations as well as other mutations with severity of liver
disease might be not depend only on virus mutations, but
