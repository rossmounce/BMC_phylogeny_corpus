Abstract
The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is transmitted in the forests of Southeast Asia.
Symptomatic zoonotic knowlesi malaria in humans is widespread in the region and is associated
with a history of spending time in the jungle. However, there are many settings where knowlesi
transmission to humans would be expected but is not found. A recent report on the Ra-glai
population of southern central Vietnam is taken as an example to help explain why this may be so.

Background
A recent study on Plasmodium knowlesi malaria in Vietnam
failed to discover symptomatic P. knowlesi in the human
population [1]. In their study, the authors used P. knowlesi
PCR primers to re-examine blood samples collected during two large cross-sectional malaria surveys in the Ninh
Thuan province during 2004 and 2005. The population
screened was mainly of Ra-glai ethnicity, living in hilly,
densely forested areas with frequent overnight stays in the
jungle. There are many parallels with the population in
Sarawak Malaysian Borneo, where a large number of
human cases of zoonotic knowlesi malaria occur annually
[2,3]. The authors report that vectors of P. knowlesi are in
the area, but it is not known if there are macaques or
indeed if they carry P. knowlesi parasites [4]. Nonetheless,
all of the indicators suggest that human cases of P. knowlesi could occur in this population, which is, therefore,
worthy of screening.

Discussion
The authors reported that during their surveys 13.6% of
4,000 individuals screened were PCR positive for the
human-adapted malaria parasites, PCR for P. knowlesi was
not included. Of the positives, 210 were Plasmodium
malariae. Ninety-five of the 210 were selected for re-

screening with P. knowlesi PCR primers. Three samples,
two from children, two and three years of age respectively,
and one from a young adult were confirmed P. knowlesi
PCR-positive. One of the children remained positive with
time. The authors conclude that the prevalence of P. knowlesi is low and asymptomatic in this population. This finding is not surprising given that the authors re-screened
samples PCR-positive for P. malariae. Plasmodium malariae
and P. knowlesi are phylogenetically distinct, the one notable similarity is at the morphological level. Indistinguishable morphology between these parasites gave rise to
misdiagnosis and masking of symptomatic human cases
of P. knowlesi malaria in Sarawak often putting patients
lives at risk [3]. Therefore, to screen properly this important population in Vietnam for P. knowlesi infection, PCR
negative samples found during the primary screen, those
that were not amplified by falciparum, vivax, malariae or
ovale specific PCR primers, would have been more likely
to yield positive results for P. knowlesi. Of the three P.
knowlesi positives reported, one was negative by microscopy and the others were either P. vivax or P. vivax with P.
falciparum by microscopy. For this study, the authors used
P. knowlesi primers Pmk8 and Pmk9 published by the
Sarawak research group [3]. These primers have recently
been reported to cross-hybridize with a small number of

Plasmodium vivax isolates in a stochastic (random) manner [5]. Two of the three positive cases had microscopy
confirmed P. vivax. It is possible that the persistent infection reported was due to cross-hybridization with P. vivax,
an explanation that would better fit the biology of the two
parasites. Taken together with sampling and other problems involving non-specific human DNA amplification
reported by Van den Eede et al, this account of P. knowlesi
in Vietnam may not accurately represent the situation
there.

Conclusion
Persistent P. knowlesi infections, particularly in very young
children would indeed add interest to what is currently
known of P. knowlesi epidemiology. Cryptic knowlesi
infections were reported recently in Thailand [6], but
mostly as mixed infections with P. falciparum and P. vivax
and in areas where these human malaria parasites predominate. The cases of P. falciparum and P. vivax in
Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, are in decline, particularly in
areas where symptomatic P. knowlesi is reported. Plasmodium knowlesi remains zoonotic and by definition less
well-adapted to the human host. In areas where Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are prevalent, they would perhaps be expected to out-compete P. knowlesi in the human
host. It will be interesting to follow the incidence of symptomatic knowlesi malaria in neighbouring countries, particularly when the human-adapted parasites are in decline
and where humans continue to utilize forested areas with
known knowlesi transmission.
