Abstract
Background: Among the vast microbial genomic resources now available, most microbes are unculturable in the
laboratory. A culture-independent metagenomic approach is a novel technique that circumvents this culture
limitation. For the screening of novel lipolytic enzymes, a metagenomic library was constructed from compost, and
the clone of estCS2 was selected for lipolytic properties on a tributyrin-containing medium.
Results: The estCS2 sequence encodes a protein of 570 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular mass of
63 kDa, and based on amino acid identity it most closely matches (45%) the carboxylesterase from Haliangium
ochraceum DSM 14365. EstCS2 belong to family VII, according to the lipolytic enzyme classification proposed by
Arpigny and Jaeger, and it retains the catalytic triad Ser245-Glu363-His466 that is typical of an a/b hydrolase. The
Ser245 residue in the catalytic triad of EstCS2 is located in the consensus active site motif GXSXG. The EstCS2
exhibits strong activity toward p-nitrophenyl caproate (C6), and it is stable up to 60°C with an optimal enzymatic
activity at 55°C. The maximal activity is observed at pH 9, and it remains active between pH 6-10. EstCS2 shows
remarkable stability in up to 50% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethylformamide (DMF). The enzyme has
the ability to cleave sterically hindered esters of tertiary alcohol, as well as to degrade polyurethanes, which are
widely used in various industries.
Conclusions: The high stability of EstCS2 in organic solvents and its activity towards esters of ketoprofen and
tertiary alcohols, and in polyurethane suggests that it has potential uses for many applications in biotransformation
and bioremediation.

Background
Discovering microorganisms and their encoded enzymes,
and characterizing their interactions, are one of the
main purposes in studying microbial diversity. However,
it is commonly thought that only 1-10% of the total
microorganisms in most environmental samples can be
cultured under laboratory conditions. The study of
those remaining, known as “unculturables,” is important
to understand the genetic diversity, population structure,
and ecological roles of microbes and to find ways of utilizing them as a novel source of molecules with unique
properties [1]. In recent decades, the investigation by
function- and sequence- based screening of the entire

microbial genome collected directly from a specific
environment, the so-called metagenome, has gained
much attention as an approach to gather otherwise inaccessible information about microbial communities from
various environments as well as to obtain valuable
enzymes [2,3].
Composting is a biological decomposition and humification of organic matter by microorganisms. During the
thermogenic phase of the composting process, the temperature usually rises up to 80°C for a certain period,
and thermophiles belonging to genus Thermus or Bacillus have been isolated from such material [4,5]. Many
enzymes released by microorganisms, such as cellulases,
hemicellulases, proteases, phosphatases, arlylsulphatases,
and lipases, play key roles in the composting process
[6]. Therefore, most of enzymes have thermostable
characteristics.
Lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) and esterases (EC 3.1.1.1) are a/b
hydrolases that are produced by many microorganisms

as well as by eukaryotes. Lipases catalyze the hydrolysis
and synthesis of relatively long-chain triacylglycerols,
whereas esterases catalyze the reactions involving shortchain triacylglycerols [7,8]. Microbial lipases and
esterases classically have been classified into 8 families
(Families I-VIII). Recently, additional families were
described on the basis of the conserved sequence motifs
and biological properties of novel lipolytic enzymes discovered from metagenomic libraries from various environments, such as tidal flat sediment [9,10], surface sea
water [11], and deep sea sediment [12,13]. A lipolytic
enzyme contains a catalytic triad formed by Ser, His,
and Asp/Glu residues, and the Ser residue is usually
conserved in the GXSXG pentapeptide motif [14]. Some
of the known lipolytic enzymes are stable in various
organic solvents, have highly specific chemo-, regional-,
and enantioselectivity, and they may be used in the resolution of racemic mixtures and synthesis of pharmaceuticals and new surfactants by bioconversion of oils, fats,
etc. [7,15]. Interestingly, some esterases degrade polyurethane, which is a hydrophobic synthetic polymer. For
example, Comamonas acidovorans TB-35 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis encode esterases that can degrade
this polymer [16,17].
In this study, we report the screening of a metagenome library, constructed from compost, and the isolation of a unique thermostable lipolytic enzyme. We
identified the esterase as belonging to family VII, and
we describe the biochemical characterization of purified
protein.

to a polyurethane esterase from Delftia acidovorans
(Genbank:BAA76305). The catalytic triad of EstCS2 was
identified as Glu 363 -His 466 -Ser 375 (Ser 375 is contained
within the classical GXSXG pentapeptide motif at
amino acid positions 373-377), through multiple
sequence alignment with closely related homologues
[14,18]. Phylogenetic analysis of EstCS2 and other
lipases reveals that EstCS2 belongs to family VII (Figure
1)[13].
Cloning of estCS2, and overexpression and purification of
the enzyme

E.coli BL21(DE3) was transformed using a recombinant
plasmid constructed from pET-estCS2 and inserted
estCS2 sequences (pET-estCS2). Following induction, the
encoded EstCS2 was expressed in an active form in the
soluble fraction of the host cells. By purification on
nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin, EstCS2 was
purified at a 41% yield from the soluble fraction, and the
specific activity was increased to approximately 6-fold. By
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis under denaturing conditions,
the enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa.
The N-terminal sequence of EstCS2 was determined to
identify them. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of purified EstCS2 allowed the identification of 5 amino acid
residues, D60DREP65. The lipolytic activity of the protein
was confirmed by a zymogram on an indicator plate, as a
clear band corresponding to a size of 55 kDa.
Characterization of esterase EstCS2

Results
Screening of esterase clones and DNA sequence analysis

Screening a metagenomic fosmid library for esterasepositive clones was conducted by identifying the areas of
halo formation around bacterial colony margins on the
tributyrin agar plates. Ten of the positive clones were
identified among approximately 13,000 chloramphenicol-resistant recombinant clones, and one of these positive clones was selected for further study.
In order to find the gene encoding lipolytic activity
within the fosmid, subcloning of randomly digested DNA
fragments, generated by partial Sau3AI digestion of the
fosmid, and activity screening of the subclones, were performed. One open reading frame, designated estCS2, was
identified. DNA sequence analysis revealed that estCS2
consists of 1,713 bp that encode a protein of 530 amino
acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 63 kDa.
The amino acid sequence of EstCS2 exhibits 45%
identity and 58% similarity to a carboxylesterase from
Haliangium ochraceum DSM 14365 (Genbank:
ACY17267), 40% identity and 52% similarity to a carboxylesterase from Acidovorax delafieldii 2AN (Genbank:EER61780.1), and 39% identity and 52% similarity

Because the sequence of EstCS2 is closely related to the
polyurethane esterase from Deftia acidvorans TB-35,
polyurethane-degrading activity of EstCS2 was determined on an indicator plate containing poly(diethylene
glycol adipate)(poly DEGA). The purified EstCS2 formed
a clear zone on the indicator plate, indicating the
enzyme can hydrolyze poly DEGA. EstCS2 also formed
a clear zone on a lipolytic activity indicator plate containing tributyrin as the substrate (Figure 2).
Enzyme specificity with respect to the length of the acyl
chains in the substrate was investigated using p-nitrophenyl esters as substrates. The esterase showed highest
activity with p-nitrophenyl caproate (pNPC, C6) among
the p-nitrophenyl esters tested, while p-nitrophenyl esters
with long-chain acyl groups were not hydrolyzed efficiently. Results of measuring free fatty acids released
enzymatically, which was monitored by change in pH,
also showed that EstCS2 has high lipolytic activity toward
short chains, especially tributyrin (C4) (Figure 3).
Effect of temperature on the activity of EstCS2 was
investigated over a range of 10-80°C, and these experiments indicated that EstCS2 has an optimal activity at
55°C and exhibits 50% of the maximal activity at 80°C.

related proteins. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the program MEGALIGN (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Except EstCS2, protein sequences
for previously identified families of bacterial lipolytic enzymes were retrieved from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The units at the
bottom of the tree indicate the number of substitution events.

Thermostability data showed that EstCS2 is stable up to
60°C, but this stability decreases sharply at temperatures
above 70°C (Figure 4a). This activity at high temperatures is a common feature of thermostable enzymes
[19]. In order to determine the optimal pH for the esterase, we measured the activity of EstCS2 at various pH
values (pH 7-11), using pNPC as a substrate, at 25°C.

EstCS2 exhibited the highest activity at pH 9.0, and the
esterase was found to be stable within a wide pH range
(pH 6.0-10.0) (Figure 4b).

Na-deoxycholate, and CHAPS, slightly increased enzyme
activity, while 1% (w/v) SDS reduced the activity by
about 12%. The effects of divalent metal ions on EstCS2
activity were tested, which revealed that 1 mM CaCl2
slightly increases the activity (119%), and 10 mM FeSO4
is inhibitory.
To investigate the amino acid residues involved in catalysis, the inhibitory effect of various chemical modifiers
was examined. The activity of EstCS2 was inhibited by
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), as are other lipolytic enzymes that contain a serine residue in the active
site in a conserved pentapeptide GXSXG [20].
The effect of organic solvents on the activity of EstCS2

To test the effect of solvents on esterase activity, various
solvents were added to the enzyme reaction, at final
concentrations of 10, 20, and 50% (v/v) of the total
volume. In 10% (v/v) of water-miscible solvents (polar
solvents), with the exception of acetone, esterase activity
was either increased or retained stable. Addition of 50%
(v/v) DMSO did not affect esterase activity, while addition of 50% (v/v) methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, or acetonitrile decreased enzymatic activity
dramatically (Table 1).

EstCS2. (a) Enzyme activity was measured at each temperature

Hydrolysis of tertiary alcohol esters and ketoprofen ethyl

triacylglycerols and p-nitrophenyl esters.

The ability of EstCS2 to hydrolyze esters of tertiary
alcohols (TAs) was examined using linalyl acetate as a
substrate. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis
showed that EstCS2 converts linalyl acetate to linalool
(Figure 5). The ability of EstCS2 to cleave sterically
hindered esters of tertiary alcohol is remarkable. Enantioselectivity of EstCS2 was determined using racemic
(R/S)-ketoprofen ethyl ester as a substrate. The timedependent and substrate concentration-dependent
enzymatic assay revealed that EstCS2 simultaneously
hydrolyzes (R)-ketoprofen ethyl ester and (S)-ketoprofen ethyl ester, with a modest preference toward (R)ketoprofen ethyl ester (eep = -0.07%; ee%: enantiomeric
excess).

Discussion
We isolated a gene (estCS2) belonging to family VII
from a metagenome library constructed from compost.
Amino acid sequence analysis of EstCS2 exhibited the
conserved sequence motifs of esterase/lipase, GXSXG,
and putative catalytic triad composed of Ser245, Glu363,
His 466 . EstCS2 preferred short-chain p-nitrophenyl
esters as substrate, and it has optimal activity at pH
9.0 and 55°C. The enzyme is stable up to 60°C. This
suggests that EstCS2 is an esterase which originates,
most likely, from a thermostable microorganism in
compost soil.

EstCS2 formed a clear zone on an indicator plate containing poly DEGA, which is one of components of
polyester polyurethane. Therefore, EstCS2 seems to possess the ability to hydrolyze polyester polyurethane,
although further enzymatic studies of polyurethane
degradation are needed. The characterization of the
polyurethanase is important for future research aimed at
the development of new bioremediation techniques [21].
TAs and their esters are useful building blocks in
chemistry, and they are regarded as important compounds from natural products to pharmaceuticals [22].
TLC analysis indicated that EstCS2 hydrolyzes esters of
tertiary alcohol, such as linalyl acetate. Extensive amino
acid sequence analysis showed that EstCS2 has a GGG
(A)X motif, composed of G160GAF sequence. Lipolytic
enzymes that possess a GGG(A)X motif at an oxyanion
hole near the active site are active towards TAs, while
most lipolytic enzymes with the more common GX
motif cannot convert tertiary alcohol esters into TAs
[22-24]. EstCS2 can also hydrolyze (R/S)-ketoprofen
ethyl ester, with greater enantioselectivity for the (R)enantiomer. In pharmaceutical applications, ketoprofen
is one of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAID) with analgesic, antipyretic, and antiinflammatory effects and is known to inhibit the production of
prostaglandins. Specifically, (S)-ketoprofen is a main
compound associated with these effects, while the (R)ketoprofen has unwanted side effects. Therefore, in
order to use EstCS2 for the production of (S)-ketoprofen, (S)-specific enantioselectivity of EstCS2 would need
to be improved through a directed evolutionary method,
or structure-based rational design [25].
EstCS2 is stable in organic solvents. The discovery of
natural enzymes that are stable in organic solvents is
essential for their use in the chemical industry, but their
discovery should also be accompanied with the development of biological, physical, and chemical methods [26].
In summary, a novel thermostable esterase, EstCS2,
which belongs to family VII, was isolated from a compost metagenome library. EstCS2 has high stability in
organic solvents; it can degrade polyurethane and hydrolyze ketoprofen ethyl ester and tertiary alcohol ester.
These are very useful characteristics for biotechnological
processes. This study demonstrates that the metagenomic approach is a useful technique to discover novel
enzymes with potential for industrial applications.

Screening of the esterase gene from a compost
metagenomic fosmid library

Metagenomic DNA from compost soil was extracted as
previously described [27], and it was used to construct a
metagenomic library using the CopyControl™ fosmid
library production kit (Epicentre, USA), according to the

Kang et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:41
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/41

manufacturer’s instructions. Activity-based esterase/
lipase screening was performed to identify recombinant
clones with lipase activity. The transformants were
spread on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing
chloramphenicol (25 μg/mL), 1% (v/v) tributyrin (C4) as
a substrate, and 0.5% (w/v) gum arabic. Active colonies
producing clear halos on the plates were selected, and
the lipolytic genes were sequenced from the fosmids of
active colonies by a random shotgun sequencing
method. The open reading frame (ORF) of the esterase
was compared with reference sequences that were
retrieved from protein and nucleotide databases on the
Entrez server at the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sites/entrez/). Sequence similarity searches were performed using the BLAST 2.0 program, and multiple
alignments were conducted with highly similar
sequences with the CLUSTAL W program. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the MEGALIGN program (DNA STAR Inc., USA).

and separation was conducted at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/
min on a BioLogic DuoFlow Chromatography System
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The resulting protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels.
N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis

N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed
on proteins that had been separated by SDS-PAGE and
electrotransferred to PVDF membrane (Pro Blott;
Applied Biosystems, USA). The gel was electroblotted at
50mA, for 60 min using freshly prepared 10 mM 3(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer
at pH 10 and 10% (v/v) methanol (HPLC grade) in distilled water as a blotting buffer. Subsequently, the gel
was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue to confirm
effective transfer. After blotting, selected protein bands
were cut from the membrane, and N-terminal sequence
analysis was carried out using an automatic protein
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA).

Cloning and overexpression of the estCS2 gene

The putative esterase gene was amplified by PCR with 2
primers (5’-GGGCATATGATGCGAGCCGAGTTGC-3’
and 5’-GCGCTCGAGTGATTTTTGGGGATCT-3’; the
underlined sequences indicate the NdeI and XhoI recognition sites, respectively). PCR products were digested
with NdeI and XhoI, and then, they were ligated into
the pET-22b(+) vector (Novagen, Germany) that had
been digested with the same restriction enzymes. The
recombinant DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21
(DE3).
Transformants were cultured in LB liquid medium
containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) at 37°C. When the
optical density of the culture reached an absorbance of
around 0.6 at 600 nm, 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added for the induction of
protein expression, and the transformants were incubated for additional 18 h at 21°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min
and then resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM TrisHCl at pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl). The resuspended cells were disrupted by sonication, and the
crude cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 30
min; the supernatant, which constitutes the cell extract,
was withdrawn. The cell extract was applied to a column containing Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN GmbH, Germany). After washing with 25 column volumes of the
binding buffer containing 2 mM imidazole, bound proteins were eluted with binding buffer containing 250
mM imidazole. Eluted fractions were concentrated by
centrifugation at 500 × g at 4°C. Concentrated proteins
were loaded onto a gel filtration column, Superdex 200
10/300 GL (GE Healthcare, USA), equilibrated with 50
mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl,

Plate assay for degradation of polyurethane and
triglyceride

Activity of the EstCS2, to degrade polyurethane as substrate, was tested on an indicator plate. The polyurethane esterase indicator plate was prepared with a
sonicated emulsion of 0.5% poly DEGA in 20 mM TrisHCl at pH 8.0 [16]. The lipolytic activity indicator plate
contained emulsified tributyrin. A crude cell extract of
E.coli BL21(DE3)/pET22b, and purified EstCS2, were
transferred into holes in the plates, and each plate was
incubated for 5 h at ambient temperature.
Characterization of EstCS2

Substrate preference toward p-nitrophenyl esters (C2C18) was determined enzymatically by measuring the
amount of p-nitrophenol released by hydrolysis. Absorbance was continuously measured at 405 nm for 4 min,
using a DU800 spectrophotometer (Beckman, USA). As
a standard assay solution, a mixture (1:4:95, by vol) of
10 mM p-nitrophenyl caprylate (C8), ethanol, and 100
mM GTA buffer was used. One unit of enzyme activity
was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to release
1 μmol of p-nitrophenol per min at 25°C. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of
Bradford (Bio-Rad Protein Assay), using bovine serum
albumin as the standard. Substrate specificities toward
various triacylglycerols were measured by titrating free
fatty acid released by substrate hydrolysis. Substrates
were emulsified in a solution containing 10 mM NaCl, 1
mM CaCl 2 , and 0.5% (w/v) gum arabic solution. The
substrate emulsion (30 mL) was adjusted to pH 8.0 with
10 mM NaOH, and the reaction was initiated by adding
purified enzyme. The pH of the reaction was recorded

Kang et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:41
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/41

by a pH-stat (842 Titrando; Metrohm, USA), equipped
with thermostat and stirrer, at 25°C for 6 min. One unit
of esterase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
that liberates 1 μmol of fatty acid per min.
The optimum pH for enzyme activity was determined
at 25°C in 100 mM GTA buffer, in the pH range 4.011.0. pH stability of the esterase was determined by
incubating the enzyme in 100 mM GTA buffer (from
pH 4-11) for 16 h at 4°C, and residual activity was measured at 25°C. To determine the optimum reaction temperature, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min
at various temperatures (10-80°C). Thermostability of
the esterase was determined by preincubation for 1 h,
over a temperature range of 10-80°C, in 100 mM GTA
buffer (pH 9.0); subsequently, residual activity was measured at 25°C.
To measure the effects of detergents on the esterase
activity, aliquots of purified enzyme, mixed with various
detergents and metal ions, were incubated in 100 mM
GTA buffer (pH 9.0) at 30°C for 1 h. After incubation,
residual activity was measured under standard assay
conditions.
The effect of several inhibitors (at 1 mM, 5 mM, and
10 mM), such as PMSF, dithiothreitol (DTT), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 2-mercaptoethanol
were tested by incubation with the enzyme for 1 h at
30°C. The stability of the enzyme in the presence of
organic solvents was tested with 10%, 20%, and 50% (w/
v) of methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetone, and
dimethylformamide (DMF) by incubation of the enzyme
for 1 h at 30°C in various organic solvent dilutions.
Hydrolysis of linalyl acetate and ketoprofen ethyl ether
by EstCS2

The reaction mixture, containing rac-linalyl acetate (15
mg/mL) and the purified protein (10 mg/mL) in 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), was agitated on a rotary shaker (200
rpm) at ambient temperature. The reaction was stopped
by the addition of 4 volumes of ethanol, and insoluble
material was removed by centrifugation. Samples were
periodically withdrawn and analyzed by TLC using
Merck silica gel 60 F254, and petroleum ether:ethyl acetate (5:1) as an eluent. Compounds were visualized by
spraying with a solution of 5 g vanillin/L concentrated
H2SO4 and subsequently heating.
(R/S)-Ketoprofen alkyl ester was synthesized by a general method for esterification. (R/S)-Ketoprofen (12 g)
was solubilized in 100 mL of 100% ethanol in a roundbottom flask. H 2 SO 4 was then added as a catalyst for
esterification. The mixture was refluxed for 6 h at 70°C,
with stirring, for the synthesis of ketoprofen ethyl ester.
Sodium acetate (0.5 g) was added to quench the catalyst,
the residual alcohol was removed by vacuum

evaporation, and the esterified material was washed 3
times with aqueous 1 M NaHCO3 to remove unreacted
ketoprofen, sulfuric acid, and ethanol [28]. The hydrolytic activity, using the (R/S)-ketoprofen ethyl ester as
substrate, was determined at 30°C for 24 h with the purified enzyme (6 mg/mL) in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 1 volume of ethanol, and
insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The
resulting solution was then analyzed for conversion yield
and enantioselectivity by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The concentrations of (R/S)-ketoprofen ethyl ester, (R)-ketoprofen and (S)-ketoprofen
were determined using an HPLC system (Hitachi,
Japan). The column used was a chiral compound analytical column (Chirex Phase 3005; Phenomenex). Methanol containing 30 mM ammonium acetate was used as
the mobile phase. The column was run at a constant
flow rate (1.5 mL/min), and the eluent was monitored
