Differential roles of TGIF family genes in
mammalian reproduction

Abstract
Background: TG-interacting factors (TGIFs) belong to a family of TALE-homeodomain proteins including TGIF1,
TGIF2 and TGIFLX/Y in human. Both TGIF1 and TGIF2 act as transcription factors repressing TGF-b signalling.
Human TGIFLX and its orthologue, Tex1 in the mouse, are X-linked genes that are only expressed in the adult testis.
TGIF2 arose from TGIF1 by duplication, whereas TGIFLX arose by retrotransposition to the X-chromosome. These
genes have not been characterised in any non-eutherian mammals. We therefore studied the TGIF family in the
tammar wallaby (a marsupial mammal) to investigate their roles in reproduction and how and when these genes
may have evolved their functions and chromosomal locations.
Results: Both TGIF1 and TGIF2 were present in the tammar genome on autosomes but TGIFLX was absent. Tammar
TGIF1 shared a similar expression pattern during embryogenesis, sexual differentiation and in adult tissues to that
of TGIF1 in eutherian mammals, suggesting it has been functionally conserved. Tammar TGIF2 was ubiquitously
expressed throughout early development as in the human and mouse, but in the adult, it was expressed only in
the gonads and spleen, more like the expression pattern of human TGIFLX and mouse Tex1. Tammar TGIF2 mRNA
was specifically detected in round and elongated spermatids. There was no mRNA detected in mature
spermatozoa. TGIF2 protein was specifically located in the cytoplasm of spermatids, and in the residual body and
the mid-piece of the mature sperm tail. These data suggest that tammar TGIF2 may participate in spermiogenesis,
like TGIFLX does in eutherians. TGIF2 was detected for the first time in the ovary with mRNA produced in the
granulosa and theca cells, suggesting it may also play a role in folliculogenesis.
Conclusions: The restricted and very similar expression of tammar TGIF2 to X-linked paralogues in eutherians
suggests that the evolution of TGIF1, TGIF2 and TGIFLX in eutherians was accompanied by a change from
ubiquitous to tissue-specific expression. The distribution and localization of TGIF2 in tammar adult gonads suggest
that there has been an ultra-conserved function for the TGIF family in fertility and that TGIF2 already functioned in
spermatogenesis and potentially folliculogenesis long before its retrotransposition to the X-chromosome of
eutherian mammals. These results also provide further evidence that the eutherian X-chromosome has actively
recruited sex and reproductive-related genes during mammalian evolution.

Background
Homeobox genes are characterized by a conserved 180
base pair motif encoding a homeodomain with three
structurally conserved helices [1]. The TALE superfamily is distinguished by a three-amino-acid loop extension
(TALE) between helix 1 and helix 2 within the homeodomain [2,3]. The third helix is highly conserved playing

the major role in DNA binding site recognition [3].
TALE homeodomain proteins are critical transcription
factors for embryonic and early development [4,5]. TGIF
(named after transforming growth factor-b-induced factor or 5’-TG-3’ interacting factor) genes are members of
TALE superfamily, containing TGIF1, TGIF2, TGIFLX
and TGIFLY [2].
TGIF1 orthologues share a high similarity inside the
homeodomain between distantly related vertebrates [6].
TGIF1 is a Smad transcriptional co-repressor that negatively regulates TGF-b-activated gene expression in vertebrates [6,7]. In Drosophila, TGIF1 is a transcriptional

activator interacting with Mad and Smad2 [6]. In
humans, TGIF1 is highly expressed in the placenta and
other adult tissues such as liver, kidney and gonads [3].
Mutations in TGIF1 can cause holoprosencephaly
(HPE), a severe disease affecting forebrain and craniofacial development, associated with mental retardation [8].
Two isoforms of Tgif1 were identified by RT-PCR from
alternative splicing events that are specific to the mouse
[9]. Both alternative splice forms are functional as transcriptional repressors [9]. Mouse Tgif1 mRNA is initially
detected at E9.5 with the highest expression in the forebrain, the branchial arches, the otic pit, and the limb
buds but not in the heart [10]. Subsequently the expression is maintained at a higher level from then on in the
forebrain but declines throughout the whole embryo by
E14.5 [10,11]. However, Tgif1 knockout mice do not
have any abnormal phenotypes [10], possibly due to a
functional redundancy with Tgif2, since both occupy
similar spatial and temporal expression domains during
embryogenesis [10] and both are co-repressors for TGFb receptor activated Smads by interacting with histone
deacetylases (HDACs) [4].
TGIF2 shares similar DNA binding homeodomains to
TGIF1, suggesting both proteins are likely to bind the
same DNA sequence [4]. Human TGIF2 has 3 exons
which have the highest homology with TGIF1. There
are two alternative splicing forms of Tgif2 genes one of
which contains a retained intron within the second coding exon that occurs only in mice [9]. Both forms of
Tgif2 mRNA transcripts are present and functional as
transcriptional repressors in adult and embryonic tissues
in mice and have similar expression patterns [9]. TGIF2
is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with particularly high expression in the heart, kidney and testis, but
the transcript is almost undetectable in the brain and
prostate [12]. In the mouse, TGIF2 transcripts are highly
expressed in the nervous system at E12.5 and E15.5,
indicating this gene has a wide but well controlled
expression pattern during early embryo development
[10,13]. Both Tgif1 and Tgif2 are required for gastrulation in mice and act to limit Nodal signalling and L-R
axis specification [5].
In addition to the autosomal TGIFs described above,
orthologues exist on the eutherian mammal × and Ychromosomes, TGIFLX (transforming growth factor-binduced factor 2-like, X-linked) and TGIFLY (transforming growth factor-b-induced factor 2-like, Y-linked).
TGIFLY lacks the specific C-terminal residues shared by
TGIFLX, TGIF1 and TGIF2 [14]. The TGIFLX gene originated from autosomal TGIF2 by retrotransposition
[14], characterized by loss of introns, poly A tracts, and
flanking short direct repeats [15]. TGIFLX has 2 exons
with a 96 base-pair intron [14]. TGIF2 and TGIFLX
share high conservation both within the homeodomain

Page 2 of 13

and the C-terminus conserved region but show extensive variation outside these domains [14]. TGIFLX is
highly conserved between primates. There is an orthologue in mice, Tex1 (testis-expressed homeobox 1), [16],
indicating that the TGIFLX retrotransposition event
occurred at least 80 million years ago [14]. TGIFLX/
Tex1 expression is restricted to the adult testis [14,16].
Tex1 mRNA is detected in the spermatids in the seminiferous tubule and in some residual bodies, suggesting
that it may play a critical role in spermatogenesis [16].
Unlike TGIF1 and TGIF2, this gene is not expressed in
the brain, so it is unlikely to be involved in brain development [14].
X-linked genes are believed to evolve more rapidly
than their autosomal orthologues due to their hemizygosity in males [17,18]. The mammalian sex chromosomes emerged from an ancestral pair of autosomes
[19] and have received specific additions and deletions
in each lineage. A large number of genes on the X-chromosome have a role in mammalian spermatogenesis
[20,21]. Human TGIFLX maps to Xq21.3 in human [14],
within a region recently added to the X-chromosome in
the eutherian lineage [22] and is expressed in the testis
[14]. Homeobox genes expressed in the testis such as
TGIFLX and ESX1L are biased on the X-chromosome
[17]. Two forms of TGIF genes (Achintya &Vismay)
identified in Drosophila are crucial for spermatogenesis,
suggesting that there is an ultra-conserved function for
these genes in all animals [23,24].
To date, TGIFLX and its orthologues have only been
studied in eutherian mammals. Since marsupial mammals diverged from eutherian mammals between 130
and 148 MYA [25-27], we investigated whether this
gene was present in a marsupial, the tammar wallaby,
Macropus eugenii. We characterised TGIF1 and TGIF2
orthologues in the tammar, identified their chromosomal location(s), and examined their expression throughout development and in adult tissues.

Results
The absence of TGIFLX and identification of TGIF1 &TGIF2

Human TGIFLX (ENST00000283891) was used to
search all available genome databases to identify
TGIFLX-related sequences. An orthologue of TGIFLX
was identified from the horse but its chromosomal location is unknown. Horse TGIFLX shared high similarity
through the exons and both upstream and downstream
flanking sequences. Another orthologue was identified
from the mouse known as Tex1 which only shared partial similarity in the homeobox region. No orthologues
were identified from other species including the tammar,
platypus, chicken and fish (Figure 1A).
Owing to the absence of a TGIFLX orthologue in noneutherian mammals, the marsupials and monotremes,

another BLAST search was performed for its progenitor
gene TGIF2 and paralogue TGIF1 from various species
including reptiles, amphibians, fish and flies. It showed
orthologues of TGIF2 were present in all vertebrates
investigated. TGIF2 orthologues shared the same
upstream gene MYL9 in most vertebrates except fish
and the downstream gene SLA2 that was only present in
therians. The TGIF2 orthologues were poorly conserved
at the first exon (Figure 1B). No orthologue of human
TGIF2 was identified in the fly genome. The TGIF1
orthologues were identified in all species examined and
shared the same upstream gene MYOM1 (data not
shown) and downstream gene DLGAP1 (Figure 1C).
Characterization of tammar TGIF1 and TGIF2

Tammar TGIF1 and TGIF2 were amplified from adult
tammar testis by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)
with cross-species primers. The tammar full-length
TGIF2 cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 252 amino
acids, 15 amino acids longer than human and mouse
orthologues. The predicted tammar TGIF1 protein contains 269 amino acids, 3 amino acids shorter than
eutherian orthologues. Tammar partial genomic
sequences from NCBI http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.
cgi were retrieved by alignment with tammar TGIF and
used to confirm their genomic structure. Tammar
TGIF2 has 3 exons and the open reading frame spanned
all exons. The homeobox was located within the second
exon. Similarly, tammar TGIF1 also contains 3 exons
but the coding region only spanned exons 2 and 3.
Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of
various orthologues of the TGIF family from human
and tammar revealed that they were highly conserved
over the homeodomain and carboxyl-terminal conserved
domain (CCD) (Figure 1D). Both tammar TGIF1 and
TGIF2 contained a three-amino acid loop extension
(TALE) between the a1 helix and a2 helix, confirming
that tammar TGIF1 and TGIF2 belong to the TALE
super-family. The a3 helix was identical between human
and tammar TGIF1 and TGIF2. In addition, the region
containing the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
phosphorylation sites (TP & PPTP) close to the carboxyl-terminal conserved domain was identical in
human and tammar TGIF1/TGIF2. However, the region
outside the conserved domain had a very poor similarity
and identity, especially between human TGIFLX and
other orthologues (Figure 1D).
Full length protein sequence or near full-length protein sequence for TGIF1, TGIF2 and TGIFLX/Y homologues were retrieved from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov or Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org. There are
30 TGIF1 orthologues from various vertebrates and
invertebrates, 28 TGIF2 from various vertebrates and 8
TGIFLX/Y homologues from eutherians. Phylogenetic

analysis with PHYLIP program clustered these homologues into two main clusters TGIF1s and TGIF2s (Figure
2). TGIFLX/Y orthologues branched with the TGIF2s.
TGIF1 from all mammals including the tammar clustered tightly, with monotremes forming the most distant
branch. TGIF1 from reptiles, birds, amphibians and fish
formed other branches. Invertebrates including fly and
mosquito clustered as a single branch. The biggest
branch of the TGIF2 cluster was the eutherian group,
followed by the TGIFLX/Y cluster. Tammar and opossum TGIF2 formed a separate branch followed by
monotreme, bird and reptile.
Tammar BAC clones were identified by screening the
AGI tammar BAC library with the TGIF2 probe. The
BAC clone showing homology to tammar TGIF2
(67G20) was confirmed by PCR amplification. The clone
was mapped to the long arm of tammar chromosome 1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Figure 3).
Only one hybridization location was detected.
Tammar TGIF1 &TGIF2 mRNA distribution in the fetus and
developing gonads

RT-PCR was performed to investigate the expression
pattern of TGIF1 &TGIF2 in various fetal tissues during
organogenesis. Both TGIF1 &TGIF2 mRNA were
detected in all the examined tissues (Figure 4A). TGIF2
was ubiquitously expressed during early development.
Similarly, TGIF1 was also expressed in all examined
fetal tissues. TGIF1 and TGIF2 mRNA transcripts were
detected in gonads at all stages examined from the last
two days of the 26.5 day gestation to day 44 post partum (Figure 4B and 5).
Tammar TGIF1 &TGIF2 mRNA distribution in adult tissues

TGIF1 &TGIF2 expression was investigated in adult tissues including the adult testis and ovary. As in the
human, tammar TGIF1 was ubiquitously expressed in
most adult tissues except the pancreas, stomach and
epididymis. In contrast, TGIF2 was only expressed in
the adult gonads and was absent in all other tissues
except the spleen (Figure 4C and 5). To further confirm
our results, we performed semi-quantitative PCR (Figure
5). This further demonstrated that TGIF1 has a broader
expression pattern than TGIF2.
Tammar TGIF2 mRNA and protein distribution during
spermatogenesis

In the adult testis, using in situ hybridization TGIF2
mRNA was detected in the germ cells, predominantly in
a layer around the seminiferous cord lumen (Figure 6).
No mRNA staining was detectable in the Sertoli cells or
interstitial cells. There was strong TGIF2 mRNA staining in round spermatids when they were just newly
formed (step 2, [28], Figure 6A) and before transforming

into elongated spermatids (step 5, Figure 6B). After
round spermatids started to elongate, staining decreased
moderately but was still detectable in the cytoplasm of
elongating/elongated spermatids and spermatocytes
(step 7-8, Figure 6C; step 10, Figure 6D; step 12, Figure
6E). No staining was detected when elongated spermatids transformed into mature spermatozoa and were
released into lumen (step 14, Figure 6F).

TGIF2 protein was also restricted to the germ cells
during spermatogenesis. When round spermatids were
newly formed, TGIF2 protein was present and there was
strong staining in the cytoplasm of spermatids (step 2,
Figure 7A). After that, immunostaining decreased significantly to an almost undetectable level (step 7-11, Figure
7B-D). At late stages of spermatid transformation,
TGIF2 was detected to the cytoplasm of germ cells

surrounding the lumen (step 13, Figure 7E). When the
sperm tail was fully formed and released to the lumen,
TGIF2 protein was localized in the residual body and
the mid-piece of sperm tail (Figure 7F).
Tammar TGIF2 mRNA distribution during folliculogenesis

In the adult ovary TGIF2 mRNA was detected in the
granulosa cells and theca cells of the secondary follicles
and tertiary follicles (Figure 8A-C). There was no
mRNA detected in the primary follicles (Figure 8A) and
TGIF2 was almost undetectable in the Graafian follicle
(Figure 8D). There was no staining seen in the oocyte.

gonad stage (day 25 of gestation-d25), sexual differentiation stages
(days 2-3 post partum for the testis and days 7-8 for the ovary) and
at later stages of development (up to day 44 post partum). Tammar
TGIF1 and TGIF2 were detected at all stages; C). Expression of TGIF1
&TGIF2 was examined in various adult tissues. TGIF1 was broadly
expressed in most tissues and TGIF2 was specifically expressed in
the ovary, testis and spleen. PCR for 18S (100 bp) acted as a positive
control and “-ve” indicates template free negative control reactions.

TGIF1 and TGIF2 share the highest degree of homology
in the TGIF family. The characterisation of TGIF1 and
TGIF2 established that both genes have 3 exons in all
species except the orthologue of TGIF1 in Drosophila.
The conservation of TGIF1 and TGIF2 throughout the
exons, the UTR and flanking regions suggests the functional importance of these genes during evolution. The
X-linked TGIFLX is specific to the eutherian lineage and
arose after they diverged from marsupials and monotremes around 148 and 166 million years ago
respectively.
The entire tammar TGIF2 protein shared 71% amino
acid identity with human TGIF2 and only 33% similarity
with human TGIFLX. The high degree of conservation
over the homeodomain and TALE regions suggests that
TGIF1 and TGIF2 interactions via the homeodomain
may be similar in marsupial as in human and mouse
[4,5]. The third helix within the homeodomain, critical
for DNA binding, is the most conserved between
eutherian and marsupial orthologues, suggesting they
are likely to bind to the same DNA motif as identified
in the mouse [4,7]. Phylogenetic analyses showed that
the TGIFLX groups tightly with the TGIF2 branch, supporting the suggestion that TGIFLX originated from a
TGIF2 retrotransposition event [14,17] (Figure 9).
Both TGIF1 &TGIF2 are important for embryonic and
gonadal development

Marsupial TGIF1 and TGIF2 mRNA was expressed in
all embryonic tissues examined, as in mice [11,13]. Tammar TGIF2 mRNA was abundant in embryonic brain,
consistent with the high level seen in the murine
embryonic nervous system [13]. Tammar TGIF1 was
observed in all examined tissues, again consistent with
previous studies in mice, and there was abundant
mRNA expression in the brain [10,11]. In contrast,
mouse Tgif1 mRNA transcripts were restricted in the
brain from E15 indicating that Tgif1 may be involved in
cerebellum development and maturation [11]. The

Figure 5 Semi-quantitative PCR. Identical amounts of cDNA template were utilized to identify the exponential (log) phase of the PCR reactions
for TGIF1 and TGIF2 genes, while a 50 times cDNA dilution was used for amplification of the housekeeping gene 18S because of its high
expression. Six tissues, adult testis, ovary and spleen as well as developing gonads and forebrain, were used for the analyses. PCRs were stopped
at various cycles (15, 20, 25, 30, 35) to determine the exponential amplification phase.

overlapping expression of these two genes and the phenotype of the Tgif1 knockout mouse suggest that Tgif2
can compensate for the loss of Tgif1 during embryogenesis [10]. The ubiquitous expression of TGIF1 and
TGIF2 in the tammar similarly suggests that both
TGIF1 and TGIF2 may be functionally redundantly during marsupial embryogenesis.
Differential function of tammar TGIF1 and TGIF2 in adult
tissues

Tammar TGIF1 was broadly expressed in adult tissues
including the testis, in similar locations to those
described for the human and mouse [3,11]. Mouse Tgif1
is found in the nuclei of peripheral regions of tubules
such as spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes in
the adult testis [23]. Murine Tgif2 mRNA transcripts are
present and functional as transcriptional repressors in
adult and embryonic tissues and have similar expression
patterns [9]. Similarly, TGIF2 is ubiquitously expressed
in human tissues [12]. In contrast, tammar TGIF2 was
exclusively expressed in the adult testis, ovary and
spleen. The expression of tammar TGIF2 in adult gonadal tissues is instead similar to that of human TGIFLX

and mouse Tex1 that are expressed only in adult testis
and are thought to be involved in spermatogenesis
[14,16,17]. Marsupial TGIF2 was strongly expressed in
round spermatids but appeared to be down-regulated as
they transformed into elongated spermatids, identical to
the Tex1 expression pattern in mice [16]. Tammar
TGIF2 protein was strongly detected in early round
spermatids and in mature spermatids, and also detected
in the residual bodies, in line with Tex1 mRNA distribution in mice [16]. Since TGIFLX is undetectable in some
humans with abnormal spermatogenesis, TGIFLX is
likely to have a function in male reproduction and
development [29]. Therefore, the expression pattern of
marsupial TGIF2 and its specific localisation in the
germ cells during spermatogenesis suggests that TGIF2
has developed a specialised function in marsupial germ
cells.
The mRNA of tammar TGIF2 was examined in the
adult ovary and was detected primarily in the granulosa
cells in developing ovarian follicles, predominantly in
secondary and tertiary follicles, suggesting that TGIF2
may also function in folliculogenesis and the development of oocyte. This is the first examination of TGIF2

spermatocytes (C-E, step7-12). Image F indicates that there was no staining on the mature spermatozoa with arrows showing the sperm head

in ovaries of any mammal. TGIF2 was also detected in
the thecal cells, known to be critical for follicular function [30,31].
Evolution of the TGIF family from fly to human:
specialised function in sex and reproduction?

The mammalian X-chromosome is known to contain a
disproportionate number of genes involved in testis and
brain function [19,32]. This is thought to have evolved
due to direct selection of male advantage genes on the
hemizygous × [17]. Whether X-linked genes are more
likely to evolve testis functions or testicular genes are
more likely to be relocated to the × remains to be
tested. The marsupial X-chromosome is the smallest ×
in mammals and is most similar to the X-chromosome
of the therian ancestor [32,33]. In the eutherian lineage
the × has been expanded, mainly by the addition of two
large autosomal blocks from the therian ancestor. These
two large additions are autosomal in the marsupial and
non-mammalian vertebrate lineages [33-36]. TGIFLX
maps to the conserved region of the X-chromosome,

present in all therian mammals, but was absent on the
marsupial X-chromosome. Eutherian TGIFLX was not
part of the two large autosomal additions but arose via
retrotransposition, presumably from TGIF2 [14]. Once
on the eutherian X-chromosome it was exposed to positive selection that favours the evolution of male reproductive advantage genes [17,21], possibly leading to its
specialisation in the adult testis. The accelerated rate of
TGIFLX evolution therefore appears to be due its location on the × and its potentially redundant function
with its progenitor TGIF2 [17,37]. Despite the autosomal
location of tammar TGIF2, it too has a specialised role
in the adult marsupial in spermatogenesis and possibly
folliculogenesis. The conflicting expression profiles of
TGIF2 in adult marsupials and eutherians make it
impossible to determine if the ancestral TGIF2 orthologue was a broadly expressed gene in the adult or was
gonad-specific. There is good evidence that the × selectively retains translocated testis-specific genes that may
confer a male advantage [21,32,33]. Thus the ancestral
TGIF2 may have already had a function in mammalian

Figure 7 Immunohistochemistry of TGIF2 protein during spermatogenesis in the tammar adult testis. Each panel shows a seminiferous
tubule at different stages of the spermatogenic cycle. Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin (blue). TGIF2 protein (brown staining
indicated with arrow) is strongly detected in the cytoplasm of early round spermatids (A, step 2) and was much weaker or undetectable in the
later stage round spermatids (B, step 7). As round spermatids transformed into mature spermatozoa, staining decreased dramatically and was
almost undetectable in the elongated spermatids (C-E, step 9-13). F shows immunostaining in the residual body (top arrow) and mid-piece
(bottom arrow) of the sperm tail (step 14). Images boxed on the right bottom are the high resolution pictures from the corresponding part

spermatogenesis before a translocated copy moved to
the × in eutherians. Due to the new TGIFX orthologue
now fulfilling the testicular function, autosomal TGIF2
was able to diversify and take on broader functions in
the adult. This suggestion is supported by the similar
degree of functional specialisation in reproduction from
the autosomal copy of TGIF2 in marsupials, demonstrating that a location on the sex chromosome is not the
only the driving force behind the rapid specialisation of
this gene in spermatogenesis.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates that tammar TGIF1 had a similar expression pattern to that of eutherians [11], but
TGIF2 has a restricted expression pattern, very similar
to that of eutherian TGIFLX/Tex1. Since TGIFLX and
its orthologues are only present in the eutherian lineage,
the retrotransposition event resulting in its creation
must have occurred after the marsupial-eutherian divergence between 130 and 148MYA [25] but before ~80
MYA when the primate-rodent lineages split [14,17].

The germ cell specific expression of marsupial TGIF2 in
adult testes suggests it may have a role in spermatogenesis, similar to that of TGIFLX/Tex1 in eutherian mammals and of the TGIF genes in Drosophila. TGIF2
expression was shown for the first time in follicles and
oocytes so it is likely that it also has a role in folliculogenesis. Together these data suggest that there has been
an ultra-conserved function for the TGIF family in fertility and that TGIF2 already had specialised role in the
adult, in spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis long
before its retrotransposition in eutherian mammals.

Methods
Gene cloning and structure

Both TGIF1 and TGIF2 were initially cloned by RT-PCR
using cross-species primers (MeTGIFF1 and MeTGIFR1
for TGIF1, TF1 and TR1 for TGIF2) based on conserved
regions in the human, mouse and opossum genomes.
The resulting 554 bp PCR product (TGIF2) was
sequenced and then used to design tammar specific primers for 3’ and 5’ RACE to clone the full TGIF2 mRNA

of 30s, 95°C; 60s, 55°C; 120s, 72°C, in a 25 μl reaction
with GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, Wisconsin,

Genomic sequence of tammar TGIF1 and TGIF2 were
retrieved from the tammar wallaby genome trace
archives http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. These reads were
aligned with the full length cDNA sequence to determine the gene structure of TGIF2. This confirmed the

http://genome.ucsc.edu/. The conserved block of genes
surrounding these loci were identified in amniote species using the VISTA genome browser program http://
pipeline.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/gateway2. Blast was then performed in mouse, opossum, platypus, lizard, frog, fugu
and fly. Genomic sequence from these orthologous
blocks was also obtained from UCSC and aligned using
the LAGAN algorithm available on the mVISTA website
with default parameters http://genome.lbl.gov/vista/
mvista/submit.shtml except that TGIFLX orthologues
were aligned with PROLAGAN algorithm. In an attempt
to identify any TGIFX orthologues in marsupials or platypus we performed a low stringency BLAST using the
individual human TGIFX exons as well as a protein
BLAT. In each case no homology was found.
Searches for homologues of TGIF1, TGIF2 and
TGIFLX/Y were performed at NCBI http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov and Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org and
orthologues were found in eutherians, marsupials,
monotreme (platypus), birds and reptiles, fish and invertebrates (fruit fly and mosquito) (Additional file 1, Table

(ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, Wilmington, USA). 2 μg
of total RNA was DNase-treated with DNase I (Ambion
Inc., Austin, Texas, USA) for 30 minutes. 1 μg of
DNased RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligodT primer using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen, California,
USA).
PCR was performed in a 25 μl reaction with GoTaq
Green Master Mix, primers (meTGIF1F and meTGIF1R
for TGIF1, TF2 and TR1 for TGIF2) and first-strand
cDNA products. Amplification conditions were: 95°C
30s; 49.2°C 30s; 72°C, 30s for 35 cycles (TGIF1) and 95°
C 30s; 57°C 30s; 72°C, 30s for 35 cycles (TGIF2), or 25
cycles (18S). Samples were analyzed on a 2% agarose
gel. Furthermore, adult tissues (testis, ovary and spleen),
developing gonads (testis and ovary at day 1 after birth)
and embryonic tissue (forebrain at day 25 of gestation)
expressing both TGIF1 and TGIF2 were selected to validate that our PCR results were within the exponential
amplification phase of the PCR [38]. Briefly, same
amount of cDNA template was used for TGIF1 and
TGIF2 amplifications and 50 times dilution of cDNA
template was used for 18S amplification. PCRs were
stopped after a variable number of cycles (15, 20, 25, 30
and 35) to determine the exponential phase. For the
TGIF2 primers, 35 cycles was within the exponential
phase; for TGIF1 primers, 35 cycles almost reached the
plateau phase, but was still within the exponential
phase; for 18S primers, amplification had plateaued by
30 cycles, but was in the exponential phase after 25
cycles.
mRNA in situ hybridization

Antisense and sense RNA probes were prepared separately from a region including TGIF2 domain (~500 bp,
spanning nucleotides 178-732) of the tammar wallaby
transcript using SP6 and T7 polymerase respectively and
labeled with digoxigenin-UTP (Roche, Castle Hill, NSW,

Australia, Cat#10999644001). Tissues were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C rinsed several times
in 1X PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM
Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH 2PO4, pH = 7.4), embedded in
paraffin, sectioned at 8 um and placed onto polysine
coated slides (Menzel-Gläser, Germany). After dewax
and rehydration, the sections were washed several times
with 1X PBS, 0.1 M Glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100 and
freshly made triethanolamine (TEA) buffer (100 mM
triethanolamine, 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride, pH = 8.0),
and then were immediately pre-hybridized in prehybridisation buffer containing 10% Dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt’s solution, 4× SSC, 50% Deionized formamide, 2
mM EDTA and 500 μg/ml herring sperm DNA for 1
hours at 37°C. Hybridization was performed on each
section with 50-100 μl hybridization buffer containing
100 ng/ml of DIG-labeled RNA probe for 16-18 hours
at 42°C. Hybridization signals were detected immunologically with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG
antibody (Roche, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia, Cat#
11093274910) and visualized with NBT/BCIP (Roche,
Castle Hill, NSW, Australia, Cat# 11681451001) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissues were
counterstained with 0.1% nuclear Fast Red (Aldrich
Chemical Corp., Milwaukee, WI, USA).
Immunohistochemistry

Fresh tissues were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and treated as described above. Then tissue sections were dewaxed in histolene (Grale Scientific, VIC,
Australia) and rehydrated in a series of ethanol/water
solutions. Antigen retrieval was performed in boiling
sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05%
Tween 20, pH 6.0) for 20 minutes, sections were then
treated with 5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 20
minutes. The primary antibody (TGIF2 purified MaxPab

sections at 1:150 dilutions and incubated at 4°C overnight. Signal was amplified using the streptavidin/HRP
kit (DAKO, Australia, Cat# P0397), visualized with DAB
(DAKO, Australia, Cat# 1967), and counterstained with
hematoxylin.
BAC library screening and chromosomal mapping

To establish the chromosomal localization of TGIF2 in
the tammar, a BAC library was screened with a TGIF2
554 bp PCR product as a probe. Membranes were prehybridized for 2 hours in Church buffer (0.25 M
NaHPO4, 1 mM EDTA, 1% BSA and 7% SDS). 25 ng of
probe PCR product was labeled with the Amersham
Megaprime DNA Labeling System (GE Healthcare,
Rydalmere, NSW, Australia, Cat# RPN1606) with [a32
P] dCTP (10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer, Melbourne, VIC,
Australia) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Hybridization was performed at 65°C overnight. Filters
were washed with 2XSSC/0.1%SDS, 1XSSC/0.1%SDS,
and 0.1XSSC/0.1%SDS for 10 minutes each at 65°C and
autoradiographed at -70°C for 2-5 days [39]. BACs were
identified based on a duplicate spot pattern according to
the Arizona Genomics Institute protocol http://www2.
genome.arizona.edu/research/protocols.
Chromosome preparations were made from pouch
young testis cells according to standard methods with
minor modifications [40]. Chromosome fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) was performed as previously
described with minor modifications [41]. The BAC
genomic DNA was labeled with dUTP-digoxygenin
(DIG) by nick translation at 14°C for one hour and preblocked with tammar wallaby Cot-1 DNA prior to
hybridization. The probe was hybridized to tammar
metaphase chromosome spreads at 37°C overnight.
Hybridization was detected using mouse anti-DIG-FITC
antibody (Roche, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia, Cat#.
11207741910; 1/200). After hybridization, the chromosome preparations were stained with DAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector lab. Inc., Burlgamine, CA,
USA, Cat# H-1200) to visualize the chromosomes.
Images were taken using a Zeiss microscope.
