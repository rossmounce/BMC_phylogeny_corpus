Abstract
Recombination of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) has rarely been reported. In the present study, phylogenetic and
recombination analyses were performed on 134 complete HEV genomes. Three potentially significant recombination
events, including both intra-genotype and one inter-genotype, were identified by recombination detection analysis.
Recombination events I and II occurred intra-genotype and inter-genotype, respectively, among three isolates,
including the lineage represented by CHN-XJ-SW13 (GU119961, swine isolate), E067-SIJ05C (AB369690, human isolate),
and JJT-Kan (AB091394, human isolate), and lead to the recombinant swine isolate swCH31 (DQ450072).
Recombination event III occurred between the lineage represented by the NA1 (M73218) and K52-87 (L25595), which
resulted in the recombinant Xingjiang-1 (D11092). Our analyses proved that that recombination could occur between
human and swine HEV strains, double recombination events existed in HEV, and recombination event could happen
within ORF2 region of HEV. These results will provide valuable hints for future research on HEV diversity.
Findings
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a member of the genus Hepevirus, is a non-enveloped virus with a positives-stranded
RNA genome of approximately 7.2 kb in length (Reyes et
al., 1990). HEV is believed to be transmitted by the faecaloral route and its infection affects primarily young adults
and is generally mild [1,2]. The mortality rate of HEV
infection is higher among women, and hepatitis E virus
infection is highly prevalent among pregnant women
[3,4]. HEV and antibodies to HEV have been reportedly
found in a wide variety of animals, especially swine [5-8].
A hypothesis has arisen that zoonosis is involved in the
transmission of HEV.
The HEV genome has three partially overlapped open
reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 is located at the 5'-terminus of the genome and encodes non-structural proteins.
ORF2 is at the 3'-terminus of the HEV genome and
encodes the viral capsid protein which has three glycosylation sites. ORF3 overlaps with either ORF1 or ORF2 [9].

HEV isolates were divided into four distinct genotypes
according to sequence and phylogenetic analyses. Genotype 1 was previously believed to only infect humans, but
reportedly detected from a pig in Cambodia recently [10].
Genotype 2 has only been identified in humans in Mexico
and Africa (Nigeria, Chad). Genotype 3 is prevalent in
swine herds and humans all over the world. Genotype 4
HEV is mainly distributed in China, Japan, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Genotype 4 HEV has a wide host range,
being prevalent in humans, swine, and some other animals. These four types of virus are thought to comprise a
single serotype [9].
Recombination is a relatively common phenomenon in
positive-sense RNA viruses [11-13] and understanding
recombination can be helpful in unravelling the evolution
of pathogens and drug resistance. So far, two reports
revealed the presence of HEV recombination. However,
one of them was performed in 2005, when there were
only about 30 HEV strains with full genome available in
GenBank [14]; the other one was focused on the open
reading frame structure analysis [15]. In the present
study, therefore, we analyze the available complete HEV
genome sequences in GenBank in order to systematically
investigate the presence of recombination among HEV
strains.

The study sequences comprised all of the available
complete genome sequences of HEV from GenBank
dated November 2009. Sequences were firstly screened to
exclude patented and artificial mutants, and then aligned
in the ClustalW program. The alignment was manually
adjusted for the correct reading frame. The 5'-terminus
non-coding region (about 25 nt) is highly conserved
within all known 4 genotypes, therefore this region were
removed before re-alignment. The remaining 134 HEV
genomes were re-aligned to generate a phylogenetic tree
using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method in MEGA4 [16]
with the Kimura 2-parameter model (Fig 1). The genotypes of these HEV genomes based on the phylogenetic
tree were consistent with the genotype information from
the original sources. Detection of potential recombinant
sequences, identification of potential parental sequences,
and localization of possible recombination break points
were determined using the Recombination Detection
Program (RDP) [17], GENECONV [18], BOOTSCAN
[19], MaxChi [20], CHIMAERA [21], and SISCAN [22]
methods embedded in RDP3 [23]. A Multiple-comparison-corrected P-value cutoff of 0.05 was used throughout.
Three potentially significant recombination events
were found with a high degree of confidence judged by
the above-mentioned six recombination detection methods (Table 1). Fig 2A indicated the BOOTSCAN plot of
the double recombination events (event I and event II)
which lead to an interesting recombinant swCH31
(DQ450072). Event I belonged to intra-genotype recombination and happened between the lineage represented
by the strain CHN-XJ-SW13 (GU119961) as the major
parent and the strain E067-SIJ05C (AB369690) lineage as
the minor parent. CHN-XJ-SW13 is a Chinese genotype 4
strain which was isolated from pigs in Xinjiang province
of China, while E067-SIJ05C is a Japanese genotype 4
strain which was isolated from a Japanese patient who
had traveled to Shanghai of China before hepatitis E
onset. Event II belonged to inter-genotype recombination, which occurred between strain E067-SIJ05C as the
major parent and a genotype 3 strain JJT-Kan
(AB091394) as the minor parent that was isolated from a
patient with acute hepatitis in Japan. To confirm the
results, the relevant strains were analyzed by neighbor
joining trees using MEGA4 (Fig 2B, C, and 2D). Fig. 2B,
C, and 2D indicated the trees constructed on the recombinant region in event I, event II, and the non-recombinant regions, respectively. The recombinant strain
swCH31clustered closely with its three parental strains in
the three phylogenetic trees, respectively. The results
clearly indicate the existence of the double recombination
events between CHN-XJ-SW13, E067-SIJ05C, and JJTKan. A previous report indicated that DQ450072 not only

had a mosaic ORF structure but was putative inter-genotype recombinant [15]. The present study revealed that
this recombinant swCH31 was produced by both interand intra genotype recombination which occurred
among three potential parental strains belonging to two
different genotypes.
Recombination within the capsid gene has been suggested for other positive-strand RNA virus such as norovirus [24,25]. The recombination of the virus capsid gene
may play a key role in virulence, allowing new recombinants to evade immune response and possible viral
extinction. ORF2 of HEV encodes the capsid protein,
which contains the antigenic regions and partial nucleotide sequence of ORF2 is predicted to be well suited for
phylogenetic classification of HEV [26,27]. In the present
study, we detected that recombination event II occurred
within the capsid gene of HEV (Fig 2A), and such mutations in the capsid gene will produce a protein which is
better able to evade the host immune response, thereby
allowing higher viral titer and greater overall fitness.
Moreover, we should notice that recombination event II
happened between human (E067-SIJ05C) and swine
(CHN-XJ-SW13) HEV isolates. This suggested that
recombination of HEV can occurred between viruses
infecting different host species, which needs to be
recorded, as they have serious implications for the future
evolution of infectious agents.
Our analysis suggested that Xingjiang-1 (D11092) was a
potential recombinant between lineage NA1 (M73218) as
the minor parent and K52-87 (L25595) as the major parent (Fig 3A). Xingjiang-1 belonged to genotype 1 and was
isolated from the Xinjiang epidemic (1986-1988) of China
[28]. The two parental strains, NA1 and K52-8, were also
genotype 1 strains and isolated from Xinjiang of China in
different labs [29,30], suggesting that Xingjiang-1 may be
originated from recombination events during the HE outbreak in Xinjiang of China from 1986-1988. This recombination event was also confirmed by the phylogenetic
analysis based on the relevant strains (Fig 3B and 3C).
From the phylogenetic trees, we can see that the recombinant clustered closely with its minor parental strain NA1
and major parental strain K52-87 in Fig 3B and 3C,
respectively.
In our study, Uigh179 (D11093) was revealed to be a
potential recombinant (Additional file 1: Fig.S1), which is
consistent with a previous report [14]. However, the
potential parental strains of this recombinant were different between the present study and previous study. Van's
study didn't include the strain Xingjiang-1(D11092)
which was indicated to be one of the most probable
parental strains in the present study. The strain information of Uigh179 and Xingjiang-1 showed that the two
strains were sequenced in the same lab in Nihon Univer-

sity School of Medicine in 1992. Therefore, it should be
cared whether this recombination event non-naturally
occurred by sequencing error and/or contamination in
the lab. A genotype 3 HEV strains swJ13-1 (AB097811)
was also found to be a potential recombinant in the present study (Additional file 2: Fig S2). It was isolated from a
4-month-old pig in 2002 in Japan [31]. Our study sug-

gested this recombination event occurred between HEJA1 (AB097812) and swJB-H7 (AB481227). The potential
recombinant swJ13-1 and its parental strain HE-JA1,
which was isolated from a Japanese patient, were determined in the same lab and shared 99.0% sequence identity over the complete genome. The ORF2 and ORF3 of
the two strains were even identical to each other [31]. It is

therefore tempting to speculate that this recombination
event might happen non-naturally in the lab.
Taken together, we analyzed 134 non-redundant HEV
complete genomes using detailed phylogenetic and
recombination analytic methods and identified two
recombinants (swCH31 and Xingjiang-1), and swCH31
was proved to be produced by double recombination
events which occurred among three potential parental
strains belonging to two different genotypes. Moreover, it

should be noted that recombination could occur between
human and swine HEV strains, double recombination
events existed in HEV, and recombination event can happen within ORF2 region of HEV. Other two isolates
(AB097811 and D11093) may be potential non-natural
recombinants happened in the lab. The present study
could reminder us that recombination also contribute to
the genetic variety of HEV.
