Abstract
Background: Integrins are a functionally significant family of metazoan cell surface adhesion
receptors. The receptors are dimers composed of an alpha and a beta chain. Vertebrate genomes
encode an expanded set of integrin alpha and beta chains in comparison with protostomes such as
drosophila or the nematode worm. The publication of the genome of a basal chordate, Ciona
intestinalis, provides a unique opportunity to gain further insight into how and when the expanded
integrin supergene family found in vertebrates evolved.
Results: The Ciona genome encodes eleven α and five β chain genes that are highly homologous
to their vertebrate homologues. Eight of the α chains contain an A-domain that lacks the short
alpha helical region present in the collagen-binding vertebrate alpha chains. Phylogenetic analyses
indicate the eight A-domain containing α chains cluster to form an ascidian-specific clade that is
related to but, distinct from, the vertebrate A-domain clade. Two Ciona α chains cluster in lamininbinding clade and the remaining chain clusters in the clade that binds the RGD tripeptide sequence.
Of the five Ciona β chains, three form an ascidian-specific clade, one clusters in the vertebrate β1
clade and the remaining Ciona chain is the orthologue of the vertebrate β4 chain.
Conclusion: The Ciona repertoire of integrin genes provides new insight into the basic set of these
receptors available at the beginning of vertebrate evolution. The ascidian and vertebrate α chain Adomain clades originated from a common precursor but radiated separately in each lineage. It
would appear that the acquisition of collagen binding capabilities occurred in the chordate lineage
after the divergence of ascidians.

Background
Integrins are cell surface adhesion receptors which mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM), cell-cell and cell-path-

ogen interactions. Integrin receptors are structurally
elaborate and composed of non-covalently associated α
and β subunits. Integrins have a large extracellular

domain responsible for binding extracellular ligands, a
transmembrane domain and, a relatively small intracellular domain that interacts with the cytoskeleton and intracellular signaling pathways. Integrins integrate
information from the extracellular and cytoplasmic environments by transducing signals bidirectionally across the
plasma membrane. Hence, the binding of a specific ECM
ligand by an integrin may elicit the activation of intracellular signaling pathways, cytoskeletal reorganisations and
changes in cell adhesion or migration; and conversely,
alterations in the intracellular environment and signaling
can result in the activation or inhibition of ligand binding
by the extracellular domain of an integrin [1,2]. Consequently, integrins have fundamental roles in diverse physiological processes including: tissue morphogenesis and
remodeling [3], immune and inflammatory responses [4],
and regulation of cell growth, migration and differentiation [5].
Integrin ligands include ECM components such as laminins, fibronectin and collagens [2], cell surface intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) and plasma proteins
such as fibrinogen [4]. Since cell adhesion and the production of a collagen-based ECM are essential characteristics of metazoa, it is not surprising that integrins have
been detected throughout the multicellular animal kingdom, from the simplest and most primitive phyla (sponge
and cnidarians) [6] to higher vertebrates. In humans, 18 α
and 8 β integrin subunits combine to form 24 functionally distinct heterodimers [2].
Within the complement of 24 human integrin receptors,
distinct functional sub-divisions can be made on the basis
of ligand specificity and tissue distribution. A previous
study of integrin phylogeny [7] identified 5 α subunit
clades with vertebrate chains occupying 4 of these,
namely: laminin binding (α3, α6 and α7 – PS1 clade),
RGD tri-peptide binding (αV, αIIb, α5 and α8 – PS2
clade), and 2 vertebrate-specific clusters consisting of a
small clade comprising the α4 and α9 subunits and a large
αA-domain containing clade including both collagenbinding (α1, α2, α10 and α11) and leukocyte-specific
(αD, αE, αL, αM and αX) α subunits (I-DOM clade). The
αA-domain is structurally homologous to the module
identified originally in von Willebrand factor. The collagen-binding αA-domains contain an inserted α-helix
which appears to contribute directly to ligand binding. α
subunit integrin homologues from model invertebrates C.
elegans and D. melanogaster clustered in the laminin clade
(PS1) and the RGD binding (PS2) clade with remaining α
chains forming a drosophila-specific PS3 clade [7].
The α chain αA-domain, shared by all members of the IDOM clade, mediates ligand binding in a metal iondependant manner by way of a conserved, non-contigu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/31

ous sequence termed the metal ion-dependent adhesion
site (MIDAS) motif [8,9]. It is somewhat surprising that
no examples of collagen-binding (i.e. αA-domain-containing) integrins have been found in protostomes since
basement membrane and fibrillar collagens are essential
components of some of the most primitive invertebrates
such as the cnidarian, Hydra vulgaris [10,11]. The origin of
the I-DOM clade remains to be fully determined although
since the urochordate Halocynthia roretzi has at least one α
integrin containing an αA-domain [12] the limited evidence available to date suggests that it may be a chordate
invention. In contrast, all known β subunits have a conserved βA-domain (also known as the I-like domain) [13]
that must therefore have been present in the prototypic
metazoan β subunit.
Vertebrate β subunits have been resolved into three
branches by phylogenetic analysis, with a majority of
sequences falling into two well-supported clades [7]. The
two clades, termed β1 (β1, β2 and β7) and β3 (β3, β5, β6
and β8) included seven of the eight known subunits. In
the β1 clade, the β2 and β7 subunits are leukocyte-specific, whereas their common ancestor, the β1 subunit,
forms heterodimers with 12 of the 18 α subunits. Clade
β3 subunits are all specific to RGD ligand binding
integrins. The β4 subunit was positioned separately to
other vertebrate clades and contains a unique extended
cytoplasmic domain (~1000 residues), which makes
direct contact with intermediate filaments via type
fibronectin III repeats [14]. Protostome β subunits from
C. elegans and D. melanogaster were not found to cluster
with vertebrate sequences. Similarly, early deuterostome
sequences (sea urchin) formed lineage-specific clusters
with poor resolution amongst all invertebrate clades. A
recent study by Miyazawa and Nonaka (2004) presented
a phylogeny of integrin β subunits including novel
sequences from the urochordate Halocynthia roretzi. These
subunits are expressed on ascidian phagocytic blood cells
(hemocytes) but phylogenetic analyses positioned them
distal from vertebrate leukocyte β integrins in an ascidianspecific clade [15].
The recent sequencing of the genome of the ascidian Ciona
intestinalis [16], a urochordate and one of the closest
invertebrate relatives of vertebrates, provides a unique
opportunity to gain insight into the complete set of
integrins available in chordates prior to the large-scale or
genome duplication events that many believe were associated with the early stages of vertebrate evolution [17-20].
An early preliminary analysis identified candidate integrin
genes in the Ciona genome [21]. Here we have identified
and refined the sequences of 11 α and 5 β integrin subunits from the Ciona genome. Eight of the α chains contain
an αA-domain (also known as an I-Domain) that lacks
the collagen-binding α helix and these chains form an

ascidian-specific clade related to, but distinct from, the
vertebrate I-DOM clade. The remaining 3 α chains are predicted to bind laminins and RGD-containing motifs. Two
Ciona β chains cluster with the vertebrate β1 clade and the
remaining 3 form an ascidian-specific β clade. The majority of chains in ascidian-specific clades are expressed on
cells in the blood and are likely to be involved in innate
immunological processes. These novel data provide further insights into the mechanism of evolution of the vertebrate family of integrins, and specifically when and how
specific clades of integrin chains first arose. The differences between the ascidian and vertebrate complements
of integrins again emphasises how phyla and species
mould their genomes by the amplification of specific subsets of genes as part of the process of acquiring a stable
and successful phenotype.

Results
Obtaining refined protein sequences for integrins encoded in
the Ciona genome
The C. intestinalis genome database was searched for α and
β integrin genes and the sequences listed in Fig. 1A were
obtained. These sequences were already annotated and no
additional genes were obtained during extensive BLAST
searching of the Ciona genome using the 26 human
integrin chain sequences. The 12 annotated α chain
sequences recovered directly from genome database
clearly represented fragments of genes, whereas the five β
chain sequences represented a much more complete data
set (Fig. 1A). In order to generate more complete α chain
data, DNA flanking the predicted gene fragments were
downloaded and searched manually for putative "missing" exons. The search involved the identification of ORFs
based on their sequence being present in EST clones or
conservation of their translated sequence in comparison
with homologous genes. Eleven Ciona α chain genes were
confirmed by this process (Fig. 1B) with two of the JGI
predicted genes (ci0100152017 & ci0100152002 – Fig.
1A) proving to represent different regions of a single gene
(Fig. 2). The sequence refinement process was aided by
the fact that four of the Ciona α chain genes were very
highly conserved and had clearly radiated relatively
recently by a process involving tandem duplication. The
completion of one full-length gene sequence therefore
considerably simplified the elucidation of the exon structures of the remaining three genes since these were well
conserved (Table 1), which was not the case when comparing the gene structures of more distantly related
integrins (data not shown). The size and relative genomic
loci of these four genes (ci100152017, ci0100130149,
ci0100152615 & ci0100131399 – subsequently referred
to as α5–8) is presented in Fig. 2.

Sequence alignments and characterization
The sequences for the 11 Ciona α chains were aligned with
human homologues. An annotated version of this alignment is presented in Fig. 3,4,5. Eight of the 11 Ciona α
chains (α1–8) have a well conserved αA-domain including the essential residues that constitute the MIDAS motif
(Fig. 3). The position of the αA-domain insertion in the
human and Ciona chains is identical, indicating that all
these chains have arisen from a common progenitor.
However, all 8 Ciona chains lack 9–11 amino acid residues corresponding to the 'collagen binding' α-helical
domain present in the collagen binding (Hs_α1 & α10)
vertebrate α chains (Fig. 3). The Ciona α chains share all
other major features with their vertebrate homologues
across the alignment including the well-defined transmembrane and conserved intracellular interaction
domains (Fig. 3,4,5).

The sequences of the five Ciona β chains are also highly
conserved with respect to their vertebrate orthologues
including the MIDAS motif within the I-like domain, the
four EGF domains, the transmembrane domain, and the
intracellular interaction motifs and PTB-like domains
(Fig. 6 &7).
Phylogenetic analyses
The α chain analysis is presented in Fig. 8 in the form of a
maximum likelihood tree with supporting data from
1,000 neighbor-joining bootstrap replicates and Bayesian
analysis. Overall the inferred phylogenetic relationships
are consistent with a previous phylogenetic reconstruction
[7]. The clades identified by Hughes (PS1, PS2, and the
vertebrate I-DOM and α4/9) are all present (Fig. 8). Note,
the PS3 clade is not shown because it is specific to Drosophila. Ciona α9 and α10 cluster in the PS1 clade and
their position, separating the protostome and vertebrate
sequences, is as expected. In contrast, Ciona α11 clusters
with its ascidian orthologue (Hr_α2) in the PS2 clade but
at an anomalous position distal to the protostome
sequences. Only Neighbor Joining analysis (not shown)
produced the anticipated branching in this region of the
tree with protostome PS2 clade members being most distal. The remaining eight Ciona α chains (Ci_α1 to α8) all
have an αA-domain and form an ascidian specific clade
that includes the αA-domain containing H. roretzi α1
chain (I-DOM [ascidian] – Fig. 8).

The β chain analysis is presented in Fig. 9. Again, phylogenetic relationships are consistent with Hughes [7]. The
vertebrate clades β1 and β4 include Ciona orthologues
(Ci_β1 and β5 respectively). The vertebrate β3 clade has
no identified Ciona orthologue (Fig. 9). The remaining 3
Ciona β chains (Ci_2 to 4) form an ascidian specific clade
including H. roretzi β1 & 2 chains (Fig. 9).

Discussion
The urochordate C. intestinalis occupies a pivotal position
in the animal kingdom for understanding the evolution of
vertebrates. The Ciona genome provides an insight into
the basic set of genes available at the very beginning of
vertebrate evolution since the urochordates diverged just
prior to the widespread gene duplication processes that
are thought to have shaped and transformed the vertebrate genome [16].
The Ciona genome encodes 11 α and five β integrin
chains. As expected, some Ciona α chains cluster in the
PS1 laminin-binding clade (Ci_α9 & α10), and in the PS2
RGD-binding clade (Ci_α11 together with its ascidian
orthologue Hr_ α2 – see Fig 8). It is unclear why the urochordate members of the PS2 clade cluster in an anomalous position distal to the protostome sequences although
this suggests that the ancestral urochordate PS2 gene
underwent significant and rapid sequence changes after
divergence from the lineage leading to vertebrates. The
remaining eight Ciona α chains all contain an αA-domain

and, somewhat surprisingly, form an ascidian-specific
clade related to, but distinct from, the vertebrate I-DOM
clade. This phylogenetic relationship suggests the vertebrate and ascidian αA-domain containing clades arose
from a common progenitor but that this gene radiated
separately in both the ascidian and vertebrate lineages
after their divergence. Data supporting this hypothesis
includes: i) ascidian and vertebrate genes have the αAdomain inserted at the same location supporting the
notion of both lineages having a common progenitor
(Fig. 3); ii) all eight ascidian α chain αA-domains lack the
same 9–11 amino acids encompassing and adjacent to the
α-helical domain in the collagen-binding α chains (Fig.
3); and iii) at least four of the Ciona αA-domain-containing α chains (α5–α8) appear to have arisen very recently
as a result of tandem duplications within the ascidian
genome based on retained similarities in exon size (Table
1), their high level of sequence identity (Fig. 3,4,5 and 8)
and their genomic location (Fig. 2). The common
progenitor gene presumably evolved in deuterostomes,
possibly in the earliest chordates since the vertebrate and

locations and orientations of the four very closely related A-domain containing α integrin genes identified after sequence
refinement (Ci-α5–8, coloured red) together with the original five JGI-predicted gene fragments (blue) are indicated.

ascidian lineages of αA-domain α chains have radiated
entirely separately and no protostome orthologues have
been identified. The most likely function for the progenitor αA-domain-containing α chain involves the adhesion
of blood cells to complement-like proteins or the extracellular matrix. In the urochordate H. roretzi, the Hr_α1 αAdomain gene, together with the Hr_β1 & β2 genes, are
expressed on hemocytes and are thought to act as complement receptors [12]. A large number of EST's for Ciona
αA-domain-containing α chains have been found in
either blood cell or hemocyte cDNA libraries (Table 2).
Finally, the expression of half of the genes comprising the
vertebrate I-DOM clade is leukocyte-specific. In addition,
it would seem that the collagen-binding property exhibited by the other half of the I-DOM α chains was a late
functional acquisition of this vertebrate clade, perhaps
associated with an insertional mutagenic event creating
the collagen binding α-helix. It is noteworthy that Ciona
expresses progenitor forms for all three clades of vertebrate fibrillar collagens [22]. It is therefore apparent that
the early evolution of chordates did not require collagenbinding integrins. Functionally important interactions
between integrins and collagen triple helices must have
developed later in chordate evolution, possibly in the earliest vertebrates and co-incidental with the acquisition of
the collagen-binding helix.

The phylogenetic relationships of the Ciona and vertebrate
β integrin chains (see Fig. 9) emphasizes the pivotal position invertebrate chordates occupy with respect to understanding how vertebrates and their genes evolved.
Previous phylogenetic analysis has suggested that neither
protostome nor early deuterostomes (echinoderm) β
chain sequences cluster with their vertebrate orthologues
[7]. The clustering of a Ciona (Ci_β1) and a previously
reported echinoderm sequence (Sp_ βC) with the vertebrate β1 clade genes (Fig. 9) resolves more clearly how the
promiscuous vertebrate β1 chain and its paralogues have
evolved from a deuterostome-specific progenitor. In addition, the vertebrate β4 chain, which fails to cluster with
any other vertebrate genes, has a Ciona orthologue (Ci_
β5, Fig. 9) and must therefore have evolved prior to the
divergence of ascidians. It was not possible to determine
for certain whether the Ci_ β5 chain has the extended
intracellular C-terminal domain present in the vertebrate
β4 chain using either EST analysis or the search for exons
containing conserved ORFs. Nevertheless, direct translation of 10 kb of genomic sequence 3' to the predicted Cterminus of the Ciona gene revealed the presence of short
ORFs homologous to a domain present in the vertebrate
integrin β4 intracellular domain and shared by Na+-Ca2+
exchangers (data not shown). The remaining three Ciona
β gene sequences formed an ascidian-specific clade
together with two β chains from H. roretzi (Fig. 9).

As phylogenetic relationships between novel α and β
chains become defined, it is possible to start predicting
likely interactions based on the known dimerisation partners of close relatives (Fig. 10). For instance, the vertebrate
β1 chain dimerises with the laminin (PS1) and RGD
(PS2) clade α chains. It is therefore probable that the
Ciona β1 clade orthologue (Ci_β1) dimerises with the
Ciona PS1 and PS2 clade α chains (Ci_α9, α10 & α11; see
Fig. 10). Likewise, it has been established that the 2 β
chains from H. roretzi (Hr_ β1 & β2) dimerise with Hr_α1
[15] and it is therefore probable that the related Ciona β2–
4 chains partner Ciona α chains in the ascidian αAdomain clade (Ci_α1–8; Fig. 10). In H. roretzi, the β1, β2

and α1 chains are expressed on hemocytes [15] and it is
noteworthy that the Ciona orthologues (Ci_α1–8 & β2–4)
are also expressed predominantly in blood tissues based
on EST analysis (data not shown).
The phylogenetic relationships of integrin genes within
the vertebrate and invertebrate branches of the chordate
phylum provides new insights into the evolution of both
of these divergent lineages. The integrin gene complement
of the ascidian genome gives a strong indication of the
numbers and classes of integrin chains available to
organisms at the very start of vertebrate evolution. For α
integrins, it would appear that there was a minimum of

one laminin binding (PS1), one RGD binding (PS2) and
one αA-domain containing chain (Fig. 8). The novel
Ciona data therefore clearly indicate that radiation of vertebrate α chain genes took place after the divergence of
urochordates. The β chain phylogeny (Fig. 9) indicates
that the common progenitor of urochordates and
vertebrates had a minimum of one β1-like gene (that subsequently radiated in vertebrates) and a single Hs_β4/Ci_
β5 progenitor that radiated in neither lineage (Fig. 9). The
origins of the ascidian and vertebrate-specific β clades is
not resolved.
The ascidian lineage exhibits amplifications of subsets of
integrin genes to produce ascidian-specific classes of novel
integrins (Fig. 8,9,10). In particular, these novel integrins
appear to be expressed in blood (see above) and may be
involved in mechanisms associated with innate immunity. It has been proposed that the major metamorphic
transformations between ascidian larval and adult body
forms may be dependent upon innate immune responses
[23]. This suggestion would provide a plausible explanation of the requirement for an expanded set of urochordate hemocyte integrins although more generic
explanations, such as the preparation for a sessile life-style
under attack by pathogens, are also possible.

Methods
The complete sequences of the 26 known human integrin
genes were used to probe the Ciona intestinalis genome
and TIGR cDNA gene index (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
ciona4/ciona4.home.html and http://www.tigr.org/tdb/
tgi/cingi using TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST with cut-off
expectancy values of E = 1) to identify homologous genes
[16,24]. Ciona gene models were also detected using the
orthologue detection program InParanoid using a keyword search using 'integrin' as the query http://abi.mar
seille.inserm.fr/cgi-bin/karine/inparanoid-para[25]. To
identify all the integrin genes, reciprocal BLAST searches
of the Ciona, human and non-redundant databases were
used. Frequently, EST for the Ciona genes contradicted the
proposed gene models from JGI. In instances where an
EST clearly demonstrated the misplacement of exons in
the recovered JGI model, the protein sequence was corrected to reflect this. To detect missing exons not supported by EST data, genomic DNA flanking the sequence
of interest was retrieved and analysed using the GENESCAN [26]http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html and
GENEWISE [27]http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Wise2 gene prediction programmes. Modified sequences were checked by
aligning with respective human integrin profiles using
CLUSTAL X [28] and corrected coding sequences used for

subsequent analyses. Expression profiles for the Ciona
genes were obtained from the TIGR database (see above).
The α and β integrin sequences were aligned separately
using CLUSTAL X. The variable domain structure amongst
α integrins necessitated subdivision of the alignment
groups based on the presence/absence of an αA-domain.
Subgroups were aligned and then combined so that the
final alignment contained all the α integrins with a 200residue (approx) gap region corresponding to the αAdomain.

For phylogenetic analysis, gap-containing sites were
removed from each alignment and Maximum Likelihood
trees were inferred using PROML from the PHYLIP
package [29]. The JTT model of amino acid substitutions
was used with and without global rearrangements and
correction for rate heterogeneity (α value obtained from
TREEPUZZLE [30]). The topologies of the trees were
tested using two independent methods: Neighbour-joining bootstrap replicates and Bayesian tree inference using
PHYLIP and Mr Bayes programmes respectively [31]. The
accession numbers for protein sequences used in this
study are presented in Tables 3 &4.
