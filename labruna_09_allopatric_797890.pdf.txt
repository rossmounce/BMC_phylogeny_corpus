Abstract
Background: The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, economically impact cattle industry in tropical
and subtropical regions of the world. The morphological and genetic differences among R. microplus strains have
been documented in the literature, suggesting that biogeographical and ecological separation may have resulted
in boophilid ticks from America/Africa and those from Australia being different species. To test the hypothesis of
the presence of different boophilid species, herein we performed a series of experiments to characterize the
reproductive performance of crosses between R. microplus from Australia, Africa and America and the genetic
diversity of strains from Australia, Asia, Africa and America.
Results: The results showed that the crosses between Australian and Argentinean or Mozambican strains of
boophilid ticks are infertile while crosses between Argentinean and Mozambican strains are fertile. These results
showed that tick strains from Africa (Mozambique) and America (Argentina) are the same species, while ticks
from Australia may actually represent a separate species. The genetic analysis of mitochondrial 12S and 16S rDNA
and microsatellite loci were not conclusive when taken separately, but provided evidence that Australian tick
strains were genetically different from Asian, African and American strains.
Conclusion: The results reported herein support the hypothesis that at least two different species share the
name R. microplus. These species could be redefined as R. microplus (Canestrini, 1887) (for American and African
strains) and probably the old R. australis Fuller, 1899 (for Australian strains), which needs to be redescribed.
However, experiments with a larger number of tick strains from different geographic locations are needed to
corroborate these results.

Background
The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world
[1]. Infestations with R. microplus economically impact
cattle industry by reducing weight gain and milk production, and by transmitting pathogens that cause babesiosis
(Babesia bovis and B. bigemina) and anaplasmosis (Anaplasma marginale) [2,3]. The morphological and genetic
differences among R. microplus strains have been documented in the literature [4,5]. Although Londt and Arthur
[6] argued that morphological differences between these
strains are too slight to warrant species status, other results
provided opposing evidence [7]. These authors demonstrated that hybrids resulting from crossing R. (B.) microplus strains from South Africa and Australia were sterile.
Thus, R. microplus from South Africa and Australia might
be regarded as different species [8].
Contradictory results have been reported after the analysis
of different gene loci in R. microplus strains collected at different locations. It has been [9] found that the analysis of
ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences
resulted in similar divergence between Australian and
South African R. microplus strains and among tick strains
from Australia, Brazil, Kenya and South Africa. However,
a clear divergence in the acetylcholinesterase sequence
between Australian and African/Mexican strains of R.
microplus has been detected [10]. The mitochondrial 12S
rDNA divergence between American and African R. microplus strains is lower than the divergence between these
strains and the R. microplus from Australia and Nepal [11].
These results suggested that biogeographical and ecological separation between boophilid lineages may have
resulted in different species of ticks in America/Africa and
those from Australia, collectively known as R. microplus,
but being actually separate species [11]. To test the
hypothesis of the presence of different species in R. microplus ticks, herein we performed a series of experiments to
characterize the the reproductive performance of crosses
between ticks from Australia, Africa and America and the
genetic diversity of R. microplus strains from Australia,
Asia, Africa and America.

Methods
Tick crosses and fertility analysis
Tick crosses were conducted using strains originally determined as R. microplus from Argentina (ARG), Mozambique (MOZ) and Australia (AUS, Yeerongpilly strain)
(Table 1). In experiment I, calves were infested with larvae
of ARG and AUS, each strain separately infesting a cotton
sleeve (20 cm diameter) glued (Kamar heat detector adhesive, Kamar, Steamboat Springs, CO, USA) to the shaved
dorsum skin of two tick-naïve Holstein calves. After 12–
15 days of infestation, sleeves were opened and engorged

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/46

nymphs attached to the skin were manually removed
from each sleeve and held in an incubator at 34°C and
95% RH for molting. Emerged adults, less than 24 hours
from their ecdysis were then sorted to form the infestation
male × female crosses into new sleeves glued to the dorsum of the same calves from where engorged nymphs
were collected. Crosses were made with adult ticks from
the same strain (AUS × AUS, and ARG × ARG; homologous crosses), and with adult ticks from different strains
(AUS × ARG, and ARG × AUS; heterologous crosses)
(Table 2). Each cross consisted of 15–20 males and 20–30
females per sleeve. Two additional sleeves, each containing only 20–30 unfed females from each strain were prepared to be the control of virgin females for each strain.
All engorged females recovered from each sleeve (each
separate cross) were individually weighed and left in an
incubator at 25°C and 85% RH. The total egg mass produced by each female was weighed and its hatchability
was determined as described [12]. The egg production
efficiency (EPE) was determined as (weight of eggs/weight
of the engorged female) × 100 [13].
In experiment II, tick-naïve New Zealand rabbits were
infested with larvae from ARG, AUS, and MOZ strains
inside a cotton sleeve (20 cm diameter) glued to the
shaved dorsum skin of the rabbit. At 12–15 days postinfestation, sleeves were opened and engorged nymphs
attached to the skin were manually removed from each
sleeve and held in an incubator at 34°C and 95% RH for
molting. Emerged adults, less than 24 hours from their
ecdysis, were sexed to form the infestation male × female
crosses in sleeves glued to the dorsum of a calf. A total of
12 sleeves were mounted on the calf to encompass the
nine possible crosses between the three strains, as well as
three additional sleeves for virgin control females for each
strain (Table 3). Each cross consisted of 20–25 males and
25–30 females per sleeve, and procedures for recovery and
analysis of engorged females recovered from each sleeve
were as described for experiment I.
In order to verify successful reproductive compatibility
between strains, unfed larvae (20–30 days old) obtained
from the crosses (designated as F1 larvae) were used to
infest a calf for experiment I-F1 ticks, and another calf for
experiment II-F1 ticks (one sleeve used for infestation with
larvae generated from each separate cross). The resulting
engorged females were processed as previously described.
Feeding periods of ticks from each cross were compared
by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, whereas
engorged female weights and reproductive parameters
(which show normal distribution) were compared by the
Student t-test. Variables were considered significantly different if P < 0.05.

Phylogenetic analysis of tick mitochondrial 12S and 16S
rDNA
Specimens of sixteen strains of R. microplus from America,
Africa, Asia and Oceania and one strain of each R. annulatus and R. decoloratus from Africa were used for DNA
extraction and sequencing of mitochondrial 12S and 16S
rDNA (Table 1). One to three specimens from each strain
were analyzed. DNA was extracted from alcohol-preserved
specimens and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA was
conducted as described [14]. The PCR conditions for 12S
rDNA amplification were as described [15]. Amplified
PCR products were purified using Wizard PCR Preps DNA
Purification System (Promega Corporation, Madison,
Wisconsin, USA). The purified DNA was directly
sequenced at the IMyZA (Instituto de Microbiología y
Zoología Agrícola, INTA, Castelar, Buenos Aires, Argentina). Both DNA strands were sequenced and assembled
using BioEdit 7.05.3 software [16].

Multiple sequence alignments were done using Clustal W
[17]. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses
were conducted using MEGA version 4 [18]. Phylogenetic
relationships between sequences were assessed by neighbored-joining (NJ) method [19]. The NJ topologies were
examined using Tamura-Nei distances [20] and relative
support for the internal nodes was tested by bootstrapping over 1,000 replications [21]. Tamura-Nei distance
measures were used because this model corrects for multiple hits, taking into account the differences in substitution rate between nucleotides and the inequality of
nucleotide frequencies. It distinguishes between transitional substitution rates between purines and transversional substitution rates between pyrymidines. All
positions containing alignment gaps were eliminated
only in pairwise sequence comparisons. Ticks species of
the genus Haemaphysalis were treated as out-group.
Analysis of microsatellite polymorphism
Microsatellite polymorphism was analyzed in tick strains
from Argentina, Australia, Mozambique, India and New
Caledonia (Table 1). For Argentina, Australia and Mozambique strains, femalestrain 1 × malestrain 2 and femalestrain 2 ×
malestrain 1 homologous and heterologous crosses were
used. For each cross, egg masses from two separate crosses

England, UK). The reaction was terminated after a final
extension at 68°C for 5 min. Control reactions were done
using the same procedures, but without DNA added to
check contamination of the PCR reaction. PCR products
were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels to check the size
of amplified fragments by comparison to a DNA molecular weight marker (1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder, Promega).
Fragments were separated using an ABI 3730 automated
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc. Foster City, CA,
USA) and sized relative to a ROX-labeled internal size
standard (GeneScan-500LIZ, Applera, Norwalk, CT, USA).
The data were analyzed using program Peak Scanner
(Applied Biosystems).
For statistical analysis, a binary matrix was constructed by
scoring the different alleles from each microsatellite locus
as presence (1) and absence (0) of the PCR bands for each
cross. Based on the binary matrix, similarity matrixes were
calculated using Jaccard's and Dice's coefficients [23,24].
The similarity matrix was subjected to Sequential Agglomerative Hieratical Nested Clustering (SAHN) and dendograms were constructed employing the Unweighted Pair
Group Method of Arithmetic Averages (UPGMA) of
Sneath and Sokal [25] to group the progenies into clus-

ters. All the analyses were performed using statistical software package NTSYSpc version 2.01e [26].

Results
The crosses between Australia and Argentina or
Mozambique strains are infertile
Tick crosses were conducted between AUS, MOZ and ARG
R. microplus strains (Tables 2 and 3). Both homologous
and heterologous crosses of ARG and MOZ produced fertile offspring. AUS ticks produced a viable, fertile offspring
in homologous crosses. However, AUS females failed to
yield viable larvae in heterologous crosses. Even though
heterologous crosses of AUS males with ARG or MOZ
females produced viable offspring (mean egg hatching
varying from 15.6% to 53.6%), the resultant F1 hybrid
ticks were infertile in all cases (Table 4). In contrast, F1
ticks from heterologous crosses between ARG and MOZ
were as fertile as the F1 ticks from homologous crosses.
This result suggested a lack of genetic compatibility
between Australian ticks and strains from Africa and
America. It was interesting to note the lower weight and
feeding period of engorged AUS females, even in homologous crosses (Tables 2 and 4). Regardless of being fertile
or not, females from all crosses were significantly heavier

and showed feeding periods significantly shorter than
their corresponding virgin female controls.
The Australian tick strain is genetically more divergent
than Asian, African and American strains
Approximately 400 bp of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA
gene were successfully sequenced from specimens of R.
microplus representing 16 different strains from America,
Africa, Asia and Oceania. The analysis of 16S rDNA
sequences variation revealed very little genetic diversity
(0.0 to 0.3%) between American and African strains (Fig.
1). In contrast, genetic diversity at this locus was 1.3–1.6%
and 1.6–2.4% when these strains were compared to R.
microplus from Oceania and Asia, respectively (Fig. 1). For
12S rDNA, approximately 350 bp were sequenced from R.
microplus representing 15 strains from America, Africa,
Asia and Oceania. No differences were observed in 12S
rDNA sequences between American and African strains
(Fig. 2). However, when these strains were compared to R.
microplus from Oceania and Asia, the genetic diversity was
1.3–1.6%, and 1.6–2.5%, respectively.

The phylogenetic analysis of 16S sequences showed that
sequences of R. microplus from America form a clade with

African strains and the Taiwan (AY974232) sequence
(98% bootstrap support) whereas the strains from Australia, New Caledonia and Indonesia grouped together in
a different cluster (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, sequences of R.
annulatus from USA and Spain formed a third cluster with
R. microplus from India with a relatively high bootstrap
support (76%) (Fig. 3). The phylogenetic analysis of 12S
rDNA sequences was similar to the analysis of 16S rDNA
(Fig. 4). This analysis provided strong support for a clade
including R. microplus from America and Africa (98%
bootstrap support). The strains from Australia, New Caledonia and Indonesia formed another cluster with a relatively high bootstrap support (78%). Finally, a strong
support (99%) was found for a third clade containing R.
microplus from India and Nepal (AF150043). In this analysis, the R. annulatus 12S rDNA sequences grouped in a
separate cluster with a low bootstrap support (65%).
The analysis of microsatellite loci was conducted to provide additional evidences of genetic polymorphism
between tick strains using nuclear genome markers. In
these experiments, egg masses from two separate homologous and heterologous crosses were used and allele
number and size was determined for each locus (Table 5

and Additional file 1). The UPGMA clustering analysis of
microsatellite alleles obtained in the progenies of R.
microplus crosses showed that homologous and heterologous crosses involving AUS had lower similarity coefficients when compared to other homologous and
heterologous crosses between MOZ and ARG strains (Fig.
5A and 5B). Some microsatellite loci did not provide a
clear genotype for the MOZ × MOZ cross and in ticks from
India and New Caledonia (Additional file 1), probably
due to the presence of null alleles in these strains.

Discussion
This paper introduced a combined approach based on
biological and molecular tools to provide additional support for the hypothesis of the existence of at least two different tick species currently considered as R. microplus. The
most important evidences were provided by studies of
crosses between tick strains which showed reproductive
isolation of the Australian strain. Genetic analyses of
mitochondrial and nuclear genome markers were not
conclusive but provided support for the genetic diver-

of R. microplus show biological differences when compared to other R. microplus strains from Africa and America
[7]. In these studies, sterile progenies were obtained from
crosses between strains from Australia and South Africa.
In addition, the mean number of eggs produced by
engorged females of American strains is higher than that
obtained from Australian strains [27-30]. Furthermore,
the amount of the insect growth regulator fluazuron
required for complete growth inhibition in Australian tick
strains is lower than that required for the Argentinean
strains [31]. These results suggested that Australian R.
microplus differ from strains in America and Africa and
may have evolved into a separate species.

aFor Argentinean (ARG), Australian (AUS) and Mozambican (MOZ) strains, egg masses from two separate crosses were used for DNA extraction and genotyping following
published procedures (22). For homologous and heterologous crosses, femalestrain 1 × malestrain 2 and femalestrain 2 × malestrain 1 crosses were used. For India and New Caledonia
strains, pooled tick larvae and adult ticks were used for analysis, respectively. ND, not determined; Na, number of alleles; SR, allele size range.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted experiments to characterize the reproductive performance and genetic diversity of R. microplus strains from Australia, Africa and
America. The results clearly showed that tick strains from
Africa (Mozambique) and America (Argentina) have no
biological barrier for reproduction, being therefore the
same species. All the reproductive parameters were significantly reduced when the Australian strain was involved in
heterologous crosses suggesting the existence of a separate
species. The genetic analysis of mitochondrial 12S and
16S rDNA as well as nuclear microsatellite loci sequences
further suggested that strains from Africa and South America are conspecific. According to these analyses, ticks from
Australia, Indonesia and New Caledonia would be also
conspecific, different from the American-African strains.
While clustered in a different clade, support for a separate
species in India and Nepal was inconclusive. Interestingly,
the results of the microsatellite analysis suggested the
absence of transmission ratio distortion between paternal
and maternal alleles even in the offspring of the AUS
crosses with either ARG and/or MOZ strains, reducing the
possibility of parental genetic effects to explain strain
incompatibility.
It is well known that in the absence of males, Metastriata
females increase their feeding period, have smaller repletion weights and oviposit none or only few fertile eggs
when compared to females mated with conspecific males
[32]. In the present study, females from all crosses showed
feeding periods significantly shorter and significantly
higher repletion weights than the virgin female controls.
This result indicated that all crosses resulted in copula

regardless of being fertile or not and evidenced that AUS
females were attractive to ARG and MOZ males and vice
versa. Attractiveness and cross-mating between R. microplus and R. annulatus has been reported, resulting in sterile
hybrids [33], similarly to our results for heterologous
crosses with AUS ticks.
One possible drawback of this study is the use of the Australian Yeerongpilly strain, which has been kept in the laboratory for over 60 years [34]. This strain has been also
used in previous analyses of the reproductive success of
heterologous crosses [7]. However, while low reproductive performance could be ascribed to continuous maintenance of the strain in the laboratory, differences were not
observed in 12S and 16S rDNA sequences between the
Yeerongpilly strain, the other two Australian strains analyzed in this study (A and B; Tables 4 and 5) and those
reported by Murrell et al. [35]. Therefore, reproductive
isolation seems to be a factual character associated to the
strain and not a side effect of long-term laboratory maintenance.
Although mitochondrial 12S and 16S rDNA phylogenies
were constructed with sequences from multiple Australian
strains, the studies of the reproductive performance and
microsatellite polymorphism were conducted with a single Australian (Yeerongpilly) strain, a fact that should be
taken with caution when generalizing these results to Australian R. microplus in general. However, despite the limitations of the study, the results reported herein support
the hypothesis that at least two species exist under the
name R. microplus. These species could be redefined as R.

microplus (Canestrini, 1887) (for American and African
strains) and probably R. australis Fuller, 1899 (for Australian strains). After its description, R. australis was reported
in Africa. However, these records were synonymized
under R. annulatus. Interestingly, R. annulatus appeared
within the monophyletic clade of R. microplus in the 16S
mtDNA tree or as a paraphyletic branche in the 12S
mtDNA tree suggesting that the denomination of R. annulatus may needs revision. Currently, R. australis is regarded
as a synonym of R. microplus. Biological features reported
here, including the lack of fertile F1 progeny in heterologous crosses and smaller, significantly different weight of
engorged Australian (Yeerongpilly strain) females as well
as molecular findings involving different Australian
strains are clearly supportive of the hypothesis of a reproductive isolation between Australian and American/African ticks. We can not ascribe the Australian-IndonesianCaledonian specimens to that species until the finding of
its types and further morphological comparisons are conducted. It is also possible that other boophilid tick strains
may inhabit small areas of the South Pacific. This issue
warrants further studies by conducting detailed morphologic, genetic and reproductive studies with multiple tick
strains collected at different geographic locations and
cured from their endosymbionts which may affect tick
reproductive performance.

because many studies involving ecology and control of
cattle ticks performed on Australian tick strains considered as R. microplus may not be directly applicable to tick
strains in America or Africa.

It is important to note that the introduction of R. microplus
into Africa took place with animals from India, after the
epidemic of Rinderpest in the 19th century. Although it is
hypothesized that R. microplus entered into South America
along with Indian cattle, information is currently not
available to support this hypothesis. However, the introduction of R. microplus in Australia took place with animals from Indonesia (most probably cattle from Java
around 1870) [36] and then later into New Caledonia
with Australian cattle (Barré, pers. comm.). This fact is in
agreement with the reproductive and molecular findings
of this study: ticks from Indonesia, Australia and New Caledonia may be a different, reproductively isolated species.
As mentioned before, the strains from India and Nepal
may constitute a different species, closer to African and
American R. microplus, but adequate biological evidence is
lacking and molecular evidence presented herein are not
conclusive and/or may be the result of allopatric evolution. Detailed morphological, genetic and reproductive
studies of tick strains from Africa, America, Australia,
Indonesia, New Caledonia, India and Nepal would be
necessary before confirming the redescription and possible resurrection of other boophilid tick species. Nevertheless, until further studies are conducted, caution should
be taken in extrapolating results from studies on Australian ticks determined as R. microplus. These data have
important implications in the field of animal health,

Conclusion
The results reported herein provided biological and
genetic evidences of allopatric speciation in R. microplus
and suggested a reproductive isolation for AustralianIndonesian-Caledonian strains resulting in a different
species. These results support the hypothesis that at least
two different species have evolved under the name R.
microplus. These species must be redefined after careful
inspection of type specimens and further analysis of local
tick fauna, including studies with several tick strains from
each geographic location.
