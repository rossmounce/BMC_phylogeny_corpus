Correction
After publication of this work [1], we noted that we inadvertently failed to include the complete list of all coauthors. The full list of authors has now been added and the
Authors' contributions and Competing interests section
modified accordingly.
Competing interests
Financial support was provided by the National Modern Meat Caprine Industrial Technology System (nycytx-39), and the Integration and demonstration of
foot-and-mouth disease comprehensive prevention and control of national
technological support project (2006BAD06A17). Corresponding author is the
unique person responsible for these projects.
All authors belongs to the same research unit(Lanzhou Veterinary Research
Institute), so they have no conflicts of interest.
Authors' contributions
KZ: carried out most of the studies and drafted the manuscript. YS: Study coordination and preparation of the final report. JY, JH: amplified the complete B2L
gene. GW: Clinical investigation and sampling. HZ, ZL: consultation. XL: Idea,
the leader of the project.
All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
