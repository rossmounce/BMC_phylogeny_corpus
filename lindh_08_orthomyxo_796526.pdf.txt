Abstract
Background: Screening wild birds for viral pathogens has become increasingly important. We
tested a screening approach based on blood and cloacal and tracheal swabs collected by hunters to
study the prevalence of influenza A, paramyxo-, flavi-, and alphaviruses in Finnish wild waterfowl,
which has been previously unknown. We studied 310 blood samples and 115 mixed tracheal and
cloacal swabs collected from hunted waterfowl in 2006. Samples were screened by RT-PCR and
serologically by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) for influenza A (FLUAV), type 1 avian paramyxo-(APMV-1), Sindbis (SINV), West Nile
(WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) virus infections.
Results: FLUAV RNA was found in 13 tracheal/cloacal swabs and seven strains were isolated. Five
blood samples were antibody positive. Six APMV-1 RNA-positive samples were found from which
four strains were isolated, while two blood samples were antibody positive. None of the birds were
positive for flavivirus RNA but three birds had flavivirus antibodies by HI test. No antibodies to
SINV were detected.
Conclusion: We conclude that circulation of both influenza A virus and avian paramyxovirus-1 in
Finnish wild waterfowl was documented. The FLUAV and APMV-1 prevalences in wild waterfowl
were 11.3% and 5.2% respectively, by this study. The subtype H3N8 was the only detected FLUAV
subtype while APMV-1 strains clustered into two distinct lineages. Notably, antibodies to a likely
mosquito-borne flavivirus were detected in three samples. The screening approach based on
hunted waterfowl seemed reliable for monitoring FLUAV and APMV by RT-PCR from cloacal or
tracheal samples, but antibody testing in this format seemed to be of low sensitivity.

Background
Influenza A virus (FLUAV) is a member of the family
Orthomyxoviridae, naturally hosted by wild waterfowl. All
subtypes, composed by different combinations of the 16
hemagglutinin (HA) types and 9 neuraminidase (NA)
types, have been isolated from birds but lineages of certain viruses are occasionally established in non-avian
hosts including humans [1,2]. Most strains found in wild
waterfowl are of the low-pathogenic avian influenza
(LPAI) phenotype. Highly pathogenic (HPAI) phenotypes
of H5 and H7 subtypes have increasingly caused disease
outbreaks in poultry and the H5N1 type initially isolated
in China has spread throughout Asia and into Europe and
Africa infecting both poultry and wild birds [3]. The emergence of HPAI and the ecology of FLUAV in wild waterfowl have been reviewed elsewhere [4].
Occurence of influenza A viruses in wild birds has been
monitored since 2003 in the EU including Finland.
Although high prevalences of FLUAV in wild waterfowl
have been reported from other Northern European countries [5,6] the previous Finnish findings of FLUAV infected
birds are limited to a few viruses of the H13N6 subtype
isolated from herring gulls in 2005 (Jonsson et al., manuscript in preparation) and to the isolation of an untyped
FLUAV from a mallard in 1979 [7].
Newcastle disease (ND) in poultry is caused by type 1 of
the nine species (designated avian paramyxovirus 1–9) in
the genus Avulavirus, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae [8]. Avian paramyxovirus-1 (APMV-1) infects a wide
range of bird species of different orders causing disease of
varying severity. The strains are classified according to the
pathogenicity in chickens and the deduced amino acid
sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion protein into
lentogenic (mildly virulent), mesogenic (intermediate virulence) and velogenic (highly virulent) strains [9]. Similar
to FLUAV, velogenic strains of APMV-1 are suspected to
arise from lentogenic strains, derived from wild birds [10].
Based on genetic and antigenic analyses of isolates
obtained during several decades, the existence of at least
eight different genotypes (I-VIII) has been shown [11-15].
Spatio-temporal and host-species associations are often
seen inside these groups. Phylogenetic analysis based on
the F-gene separates APMV-1 strains into class 1 and 2
clades, and the later into two sublineages which comprise
the previously defined genotypes [16,17]. Lentogenic
viruses of class 2, genotype 1, are naturally hosted by wild
waterfowl and have an ecology resembling that of influenza A [18,19]. Class 1 viruses have also been recovered
worldwide, mainly from wild waterfowl, and are with few
exceptions of low-pathogenicity [12,19].
ND is regarded as one of the most important pathogens in
the poultry industry where it has a great economic impact.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/35

Four ND outbreaks have occurred in Finland [20-22], the
latest in 2004 when ND affected a flock of 12 000 turkeys
(Ek-Kommonen, unpublished results), which were consequently destroyed. The need for vaccination of poultry in
Finland was evaluated and Newcastle disease is currently
controlled without vaccines.
The role of waterfowl in some of the endemic zoonotic
virus infections has not been settled. In order to expand
the knowledge of their prevalences in the Finnish waterfowl population, flavi-and alphaviruses were included in
the study.
Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the genus
Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. It is known to cause
epidemics in humans in Northern Europe characterized
by fever, rash and polyarthritis [23]. The outbreaks appear
to occur at 7-year intervals; the latest being in 2002 with
600 serologically verified human cases in Finland [24]. A
high seroprevalence in resident birds can be seen one year
after an outbreak [25].
The family Flaviviridae consists of about 70 viruses, most
of which are arthropod-borne zoonotic agents. They infect
a wide variety of vertebrates including mammals, avians
and amphibians. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the
most important flavivirus in Europe, where it is endemic
in several countries and has a significant impact on public
health. The virus is maintained in ticks and wild vertebrates and transmission to humans occurs generally via
tick bites [26]. West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus endemic in Europe. Until recently, it was considered
an Old World virus infecting predominantly humans and
equines. Outbreaks of WN fever have been reported e.g. in
humans in Romania 1996 [27] and in horses in France
2000 [28]. Since the outbreak in New York started in
1999, the virus has dispersed throughout North and Central America and is now endemic in most US states and
Canadian provinces [29]. Disease in WNV-infected birds
varies from symptomless to death, corvids (family Corvidae) being the most sensitive to lethal infections [30].
Wild bird infections by WNV, Usutu virus and SINV have
been documented and birds are believed to be able to
transmit these viruses geographically over long distances
[31]. Migratory birds have also been shown to carry e.g.
TBEV-infected ticks [32].
In order to address this need of wild bird surveillance, we
chose to use an approach where hunters were recruited for
blood and swab sample collection. In total 310 blood
samples and 115 tracheal and cloacal swab samples were
collected and studied in year 2006. Our main interest was
to study the distribution of FLUAV and APMV-1 infections
in our wild waterfowl populations. As SINV and TBEV are
established zoonotic agents in Finland, the understanding

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/35

of their ecology and possible links to wild waterfowl was
also of special interest.
In this study, the circulation of both influenza A virus and
APMV-1 in Finnish wild waterfowl was documented and
isolated FLUAV and APMV-1 strains were genetically and
phylogeneticaly characterized.

Results
Antibody and virus detection
Antibodies to influenza A were detected by a commercial
competitive ELISA (FLUAcA). Out of 310 blood specimens, three samples, all from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), were positive (competitive percentages <45). Two
samples, one from a mallard and one from a common teal
(Anas crecca) were regarded as borderline (competitive
percentages 45–50). Examination of the 115 combined
tracheal and cloacal swab samples showed that 13 samples were positive when studied by the influenza A Mgene specific real time RT-PCR (cycle threshold -values
(Ct) 21.15–38.86); none of the samples were positive by
H5-or H7-specific real-time RT-PCR. After inoculation of
RT-PCR-positive specimen into embryonated eggs, 7
influenza virus isolates were successfully obtained. In

only one of the samples (A/mallard/Finland/12072/06)
could both antibodies (competitive percentage 48.8) and
viral RNA (Ct-value 32.2) be detected (Table 1).
In the screening for APMV infections, two samples, one
from a common teal and one from a mallard, had titers of
1:40 in the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test with
APMV/Ulster antigen. Of the swab specimens, 6 were RTPCR positive and from 4 of them, APMV-1 was successfully isolated in egg culture. Three of the isolates derived
from common teals and one from a common pochard
(Aythya ferina). None of the birds were positive in both
RT-PCR and HI (Table 1).
When tested for antibodies to SINV by HI, none of the
blood samples were found positive. Samples were not
studied for SINV infections by PCR. However, three samples, all from mallards, reacted positively with WNV antigens in the HI test. Two of them had low titers of >1:20
while one reached a titer of 1:6120. Consequently, the
sera were tested in parallel with TBEV antigen: the TBEV
antibody titer was lower for each sample, with titers
<1:20, <1:20 and 1:1280, respectively. None of the 100
studied swab samples were positive for flavivirus RNA by

size.
Subtyping and genetic characterization
By serological analysis, in HI test with subtype-specific
antisera, the influenza strains proved to be of the H3 subtype. Genetic analysis of the HA and NA gene sequences
verified them to be of the H3N8 subtype. Nucleotide
sequence alignments with the inner segment of the HA (nt
482–1166) and NA (nt 605–973) genes of the seven isolates showed that sequence identities between the isolates
and the characterized strain A/mallard/Finland/12072/06
ranged from 97.2% to 99.7%. Sequence comparison
revealed a close similarity (by BLAST) of the H3 gene to
strains isolated from ducks in Nanchang, China [GenBank: CY006015] (97% identity) and Denmark [GenBank: AY531031] (97% identity) (Figure 1, Table 2). The
closest similarity of the N8 gene was likewise to the Dan-

ish strain [GenBank: AY531032] (97% identity) and a
Norwegian strain [GenBank: AJ841294] (97% identity)
(Figure 2, Table 3). Both genes of A/mallard/Finland/
12072/06 clustered phylogeneticaly together with mainly
Eurasian strains.
Sequences of the F genes of the APMV-1 isolates revealed
that the isolates were of two different lineages (Figure 3,
Table 4): three isolates had a high similarity (98–99%
identity by BLAST) to strain FIN-97 [GenBank:
AY034801], a previous Finnish isolate, and to the North
American strain US/101250-2/01 [GenBank: AY626268],
of class 1. One isolate and one sample only positive by RTPCR were most similar to Far Eastern isolates [GenBank:
AY965079, AY972101] (99% identity) and had 96% similarity to strain Ulster/67 [GenBank: AY562991] representing class 2, genotype I.
The cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein has been generally used as an indicator for pathogenicity. Velogenic

strains possess at least two basic amino acids immediately
surrounding glutamine 114 while lentogenic strains lack
this domain [34,35]. Our strains had either the cleavage
site sequence SGGERQERLVG or SGGGKQGRLIG, both
typically found in lentogenic strains (Table 5).
The sequences obtained from the isolates described in this
study have been submitted to GenBank with the accession
numbers listed in Tables 2, 3, 4.

Discussion
The circulation of influenza A viruses in the Finnish waterfowl population in fall 2006 was shown in this study; no
viruses of the potentially highly pathogenic H5 or H7 subtypes could be detected. According to the M-gene realtime RT-PCR, the prevalence of influenza A viruses was
11.3% (n = 115) in all analysed birds, 16.3% (n = 55) in
all analysed mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and 5.4% (n =
37) in all analysed teals (Anas crecca). These values corre-

spond well with previous studies where extensive studies
on wild waterfowl in Sweden have shown a 14.5% prevalence of FLUAV during fall, when the prevalence appears
to be highest [36]. Although influenza A viruses replicate
mainly in the intestinal tract and are shed with feces to
wading waters [37], recently it has been suggested that at
least some of the HPAI strains are preferentially recovered
from tracheal specimen. Whether the viral RNA obtained
in our study was recovered from tracheal or from cloacal
specimen remains unknown as these were pooled
together. It is also noteworthy that the viral load estimated
by real-time RT-PCR varied considerably in the 7/13
FLUAV isolation positive samples: two samples were
strongly positive (Ct 21–24) while five samples were
much weaker positives (Ct >32, two of these Ct >37). The
prevalence of infection of FLUAV when studied by the
presence of specific antibodies by a commercial competitive ELISA was only 1.6% (n = 310). Screening of antibod-

The subtype diversity of circulating avian influenza viruses
in Europe and Asia during the past few years has been
extensive, as summarized by Alexander [38], however,
only one subtype (H3N8) was recovered in this study. In

a Swedish study based on material collected during the
years 2002–2004, 11 different HA subtypes and all 9 NA
subtypes were found [36]. Out of 129 isolates only 5 were
of the H3N8 subtype while in the North American study,
described by Krauss et al., viruses of the H3N8 subtype
were most commonly found (22.8% of isolates from
ducks) in the 16-year study [39]. Other recent H3N8 find-

ings have been reported from Denmark in 2003 [40] and
Norway in 2005 [41]. As we have not found any methodological reasons to explain the subtype homogeneity of
our findings, the results could be explained by the limited
time period of sample collection; birds were sampled during one hunting season of only a few months and from a
limited number of sampling sites; the material represented only few duck populations (Figure 4). It could also
be simply due to the seasonality of subtype prevalences.

All H3N8 isolates, except one from a teal, were derived
from mallards.
To conclude, of our 115 swab samples 13 were influenza
A RT-PCR positive and of those samples 7 viruses were isolated. In 2006 HPAI H5N1 viruses occurred widely in
birds in Europe [38] but were not reported from Finland.
Our results, with H3N8 as the only detected subtype, sup-

port the view that this subtype was indeed absent at that
time.
There have been occasional isolations of APMV-1 in Finland from birds representing different orders, e.g. pigeons
(Columbidae), pheasants (Phasianidae) and goosander
(Mergus merganser). Antigenic and genetic analysis of
viruses isolated from three outbreaks in pheasants in Denmark between August and November 1996, from a
goosander in Finland in September 1996, from an outbreak in chickens (Gallus gallus) in Norway in February
1997 and from an outbreak in chickens in Sweden 1997
indicate that they were all essentially similar. The results
are consistent with the theory that the virus was introduced to the different locations by migratory birds [42].
The latest outbreak in poultry occurred in July 2004 when
APMV-1 was isolated from turkeys (Meleagrididae) on a
farm in Finland. The pathogenicity index was verified by
VLA (Weybridge, UK) to be >0.7 and the virus was thereby
classified as Newcastle disease virus. The birds were
destroyed and the outbreak was handled accordingly.
Interestingly, ND was reported from two sites in Sweden
at the same time, but no connection to the Finnish outbreak was found. According to VLA reports (Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, UK), virus isolates from
all three sites were highly similar. The origin of the Finnish outbreak was never found but wild birds were suspected.
The prevalence of APMV-1 was 5.2% (n = 115) in our
study. Five of the six RT-PCR positive samples came from
common teal, although teals represented only 32.2% of
our material. One isolate derived from the only pochard
(Aythya ferina) sampled in this study. Two teals appeared
to be infected with both FLUAV and APMV-1.
Based on genetic characterization, our isolates clustered
into two distinct lineages (Figure 3). Three isolates (Fin/
12104/06, Fin/12119/06 and Fin/13193/06) were of class
1, which represents mainly avirulent viruses found worldwide from wild waterfowl, including the lentogenic strain
MC110/77 and velogenic strain 34/90 [12]. The global
distribution of the class 1 strains is also seen in the clustering of our isolates with geographically distant isolates.
Our isolates were obtained from different sites in North,
Central and South Finland, suggesting that viruses of this
lineage are dispersed through the country (Figure 4).
Interestingly, isolates obtained in a recent North American study [19] of APMV-1 in waterfowl and shorebirds
showed high sequence similarity (97–98%) to our class 1
isolates (data not shown).
Two isolates (Fin/12074/06 and Fin/12136/06) were of
class 2, genotype I, which includes Ulster-like viruses.
Finnish APMV-1 isolates have been previously character-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/35

ized [22], and this is the first time that viruses of genotype
I have been found (Figure 3). These two isolates were also
derived from different regions. Generally viruses of genotype I cause little or no disease in poultry, and derivatives,
e.g. Ulster2C/67 and Queensland/V4, have been used as
live vaccines in many countries. Avirulent strains have
been isolated worldwide in waterfowl but have occasionally been linked to virulent disease outbreaks, e.g.
1998–2000 in Australia [43].
Two basic amino acid pairs surrounding the fusion protein cleavage site usually indicate increased virulence [44].
Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the F-protein
cleavage site (109–119) showed all of the isolates to be of
avirulent type lacking the basic amino acids (Table 5).
Other paramyxovirus types (APMV-2-9) were not studied
but these findings show that type 1 avian paramyxovirus
is probably endemic in the Finnish waterfowl populations.
None of the samples were positive for Sindbis virus antibodies in the HI test. Previous studies in Finland have
demonstrated SINV antibodies in resident grouse (Tetraonidae) with a possibly cyclic pattern. The total prevalence
of SINV HI antibodies was 27.4 % in 2003 and dropped
down to 1.4 % in 2004 [25]. Wild tetraonid and passerine
birds have been suggested to play a role as amplifying
hosts and some migratory birds are known to be able to
distribute SINV over long distances [45,46]. In this study,
evidence of the involvement of wild waterfowl in the ecology of SINV was not found.
We found three mallard samples reactive against WNV
antigen in HI test, one of which had a significantly high
titer of 1/6120. The lower HI titers towards TBEV are suggestive for antibody specificity against a mosquito-borne
flavivirus, however these results require further confirmation by neutralization test [47]. Although previous studies
have shown serological evidence of West Nile virus infections in birds in Germany [48], Hungary [49], Poland [50]
and the UK [31], to our knowledge, mosquito-borne flavivirus infections have not been reported from Northern
Europe. It is possible that migratory birds arriving annually from endemic areas to Finland could carry and transmit mosquito-borne flaviviruses through ornithophilic
mosquitoes.
Finally, the involvement of hunters in the sampling of
wild waterfowl was found to be a suitable way to screen
birds. The percentage of different species in our material
(Table 6) correlates well with the percentage of the same
species in the nationwide waterfowl bag in 2006 (total
bag 552 600 individuals) [51]. For example, the four most
numerous species in our sample jointly represented 92%
of the birds in the nationwide bag, mallard (51%) and

Most of the sampled birds had presumably migrated from
the east (Russia) as only about 200 000 pairs of both mallard and teal are estimated to nest in Finland.

Conclusion
Circulation of both influenza A virus and APMV-1 in
Finnish wild waterfowl was documented in this study
with prevalences of 11.3% and 5.2%, respectively. The
subtype H3N8 was the only subtype of influenza A
detected while the APMV-1 viruses detected represented
two distinct genetic groups, class 1 and class 2, genotype
1. The results suggest that both the sampling and detection methods were effective, and the methods would
likely have detected e.g. HPAI H5N1 infections occuring
in poultry and wild birds in other European countries in
2006. Screening of antibodies was less efficient in detecting the prevalence of infection. Notably, serological evidence of flavivirus infection in wild waterfowl in Finland
was documented.

Methods
Sample overview
We tested 310 blood samples and 115 mixed tracheal and
cloacal swabs from birds representing 11 different species
belonging to the order Anseriformes. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were by number the best-represented species,
with 50.0% of the blood samples and 47.8 % of the swab
samples. Teals (Anas crecca) counted for 27.1% and 32.2%
of the respective sample types (Table 6). The samples were
collected by hunters during the annual duck hunting season preceding peak fall migration. All samples were collected during an 8-week time-period starting 20th August
2006. The blood sampling covered the whole country
while the swab samples were collected from three main
areas (Figure 4).

Sample collection
Hunters were asked to collect blood samples (preferentially from the heart) from hunted waterfowl on filterpaper strips and to enclose the dried samples individually
in airtight plastic bags. Samples were sent to the Department of Virology, University of Helsinki. The hunters were
asked to identify the species and mark the location and
date of collection for each sample. The samples were
diluted immediately upon arrival or stored at -20°C.
Approximately 1 cm2 of blood-stained filter paper was
sliced and blood was eluted in 1 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline with 0.2% bovine albumin serum to
a final concentration of approximately 1:10 [24,25]. Aliquots were stored at -20°C until tested.

Hunters and staff from the Finnish Game and Fisheries
Research Institute (RKTL) collected swab samples using
commercial nylon-flocked swabs which were placed in
tubes containing 1 ml Universal Transport Medium
(Copan Innovation, Brescia, Italy). Samples were kept frozen at -20°C until transferred to the laboratory at The
Finnish Food Safety Authority (Evira, Helsinki) where
they were stored at -80°C until tested. From each bird, tracheal and cloacal swab samples were taken and placed in
the same tube. A corresponding blood sample (collected
as described above) was available for each of the 115
mixed swab samples.
Serological examination
Blood samples were tested for antibodies to influenza A
with the commercial FLUAcA competitive ELISA Kit based
on the nucleocapsid protein (ID.VET, Montpellier,
France). Samples were inactivated for 30 minutes in a
+56°C water bath prior to testing. The competition percentages were calculated according to the manufacturer's
recommendations by dividing the sample OD measured
at 450 nm with the negative control OD and multiplying

Page 11 of 15

Virology Journal 2008, 5:35

the sum with 100. Percentages less than or equal to 45
were considered positive, percentages higher than or
equal to 50 negative and percentages between 45 and 50
borderline. Samples with a competition percentage less
than 55 were re-examined.
Blood samples were examined individually for antibodies
to APMV-1, SINV and flaviviruses by hemagglutination
inhibition test (HI). Prior to testing, for HI microtitration
with SINV and flavivirus antigens, the diluted serum samples were absorbed with kaolin and male goose erythrocytes. For microtitration with APMV-1 antigen the serum
samples were inactivated for 30 minutes in a +56°C water
bath.
Blood samples were screened for antibodies by HI test
using WNV, SINV and APMV-1/Ulster antigens. As all the
viruses in the flavivirus group are cross-reactive in HI,
West Nile virus-positive samples were further analysed in
a parallel HI test with both WNV and TBEV antigen. The
SINV, WNV and TBEV strains used were inactivated with
Tween-ether and APMV-1 with formaldehyde. Human
seropositive and seronegative sera were used as controls
for SINV, WNV and TBEV. For APMV-1 a positive turkey
serum was used as control. The HI was performed with
two-fold dilutions starting from 1:20. The protocol for the
detection of arbovirus antibodies by HI has been
described previously [52-54]. The protocol for the detection of APMV-1 infection was adapted from Council
Directive 92/66/EEC Annex III [55], with the exception
that rooster erythrocytes were used instead of chicken
erythrocytes. The APMV-1 controls and NDV/Ulster antigen were obtained from VLA (Weybridge, UK).

RNA extraction and RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from swab samples using semi-automated ABI PRISM™ 6100 Nucleic Acid PrepStation and
reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Influenza A viruses were detected by a real time RT-PCR
assay targeting the highly conserved matrix gene [56].
Samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values <40 were further
studied with a real time RT-PCR targeting the H5 and H7
genes [57]. In order to detect as many strains as possible,
two different primer pairs were used for APMV nucleic
acid amplification by RT-PCR (Table 7), described previously by Seal et al. [58] and Huovilainen et al. [22]. Both
primer pairs target the F-gene and include the fusion protein cleavage site.

RNA from 100 swab specimens were also studied by a
heminested RT-PCR. The primers are according to and
protocol adapted from the method described by Scaramozzino et al. [33] with minor modifications.
Virus isolation and characterization
All samples positive in the FLUAV matrix gene real-time
RT-PCR and in APMV-1 RT-PCR assays were subjected to
virus isolation attempts by inoculating swab specimen
into the allantoic cavity of four 8–10 day-old embryonated chicken eggs. The allantoic-amniotic fluids were
harvested from eggs with dead and dying embryos as they
arose and from all remaining eggs six days post-inoculation, and were tested for hemagglutinating activity.
FLUAV isolates were tentatively characterized by HI test
using subtype-specific polyclonal antisera obtained from
VLA.

The preliminary genetic subtyping was done by sequencing the both ends of RT-PCR products of HA and NA genes

as described by Hoffman et al. [59] and performing BLAST
searches with the obtained data. All isolates were serologically and genetically typed as H3N8 viruses and the HA
and NA genes of A/mallard/Finland/12072/06 were
amplified and sequenced with three overlapping primer
pairs (Table 7).
APMV-1 strains were amplified and sequenced using the
PCR primers targeting the F-gene [22,58]. The 208-nucleotide-long sequences covering the fusion protein cleavage
site were subjected to phylogenetic analysis and converted
to amino acid sequence. The basic amino acids surrounding the fusion protein cleavage site (109–119) were studied as pathogenicity markers (Table 5).
PCR products for sequencing were extracted using Mini
Gels, DNA Recovery Kit and BandPick™ (Elchrom Scientific, Cham, Switzerland). The sequencing reactions were
run on Applied Biosystems 3100 Avant capillary DNA
sequencer and using BigDye Terminator v3.1 chemistry
(Applied Biosystems). Reaction products were purified
using DyeEx 2.0 Spin Kit (Qiagen, Helsinki, Finland).
Sequence analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the nucleotide
sequences of full-length H3 and N8 genes. The middle
parts of the genes were analysed for all FLUAV isolates but
sequence from only one strain (A/mallard/Finland/
12072/06) was used for phylogenetic analysis as the
nucleotide sequence of all strains were highly similar,
though not identical. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis
on the partial F-gene (nt 4846–5053) of all APMV-1 isolates and the sequence obtained from one APMV-1 RTPCR positive sample, which failed to grow, was included.

The sequences were compared with published sequences
by search in EBI WU-Blast2 database [60]. For alignments
and phylogenetic trees the most closely related, according
to the BLAST-search, and more distant strains were chosen. Nucleotide sequences were managed within the
BioEdit [61], and aligned with ClustalX [62]. Phylogenetic
trees were generated by the neighbor-joining algorithm
within the PHYLIP 3.67 package [63] from 100 or 500
