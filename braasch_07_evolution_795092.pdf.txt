Abstract
Background: Coloration and color patterning belong to the most diverse phenotypic traits in
animals. Particularly, teleost fishes possess more pigment cell types than any other group of
vertebrates. As the result of an ancient fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD), teleost genomes
might contain more copies of genes involved in pigment cell development than tetrapods. No
systematic genomic inventory allowing to test this hypothesis has been drawn up so far for
pigmentation genes in fish, and almost nothing is known about the evolution of these genes in
different fish lineages.
Results: Using a comparative genomic approach including phylogenetic reconstructions and
synteny analyses, we have studied two major pigment synthesis pathways in teleost fish, the melanin
and the pteridine pathways, with respect to different types of gene duplication. Genes encoding
three of the four enzymes involved in the synthesis of melanin from tyrosine have been retained as
duplicates after the FSGD. In the pteridine pathway, two cases of duplicated genes originating from
the FSGD as well as several lineage-specific gene duplications were observed. In both pathways,
genes encoding the rate-limiting enzymes, tyrosinase and GTP-cyclohydrolase I (GchI), have
additional paralogs in teleosts compared to tetrapods, which have been generated by different
modes of duplication. We have also observed a previously unrecognized diversity of gchI genes in
vertebrates. In addition, we have found evidence for divergent resolution of duplicated
pigmentation genes, i.e., differential gene loss in divergent teleost lineages, particularly in the
tyrosinase gene family.
Conclusion: Mainly due to the FSGD, teleost fishes apparently have a greater repertoire of
pigment synthesis genes than any other vertebrate group. Our results support an important role
of the FSGD and other types of duplication in the evolution of pigmentation in fish.

Background
Coloration and color patterning of skin, scales, feathers,
and hair belong to the most diverse phenotypic traits in
vertebrates and have a plethora of functions such as cam-

ouflage, warning or threatening of predators, and species
recognition [1,2]. Coloration is the result of diverse pigments synthesized by pigment cells or chromatophores,
which are derived from the neural crest. There are noticePage 1 of 18

able differences in the number of chromatophore types
among vertebrate groups. Mammals and birds possess
only the brown to black melanocytes, while amphibians
and reptiles additionally have the yellow to red xantho-/
erythrophores and the reflecting iridophores. In teleost
fish, up to five different pigment cell types have been identified, with white leucophores and blue cyanophores in
addition to the aforementioned cell types (reviewed in
[2]). Some pigment cell types in teleosts are even further
partitioned into distinct sublineages that are under different genetic control [3,4].
The genetic basis of pigment cell development and differentiation is largely conserved between mammals and teleosts. Many genes such as Sox10, Mitf, Kit and Ednrb, some
of them first identified through the cloning of coat color
mutations in mice, have subsequently been found to be
involved in pigmentation in teleost fish as well [5-8].
Other genes with functions in pigmentation like slc24a5
were identified first in teleosts and later on in mammals
[9]. However, an important difference between teleost
fish and tetrapods has recently emerged from several studies on particular fish species. For some single copy pigmentation genes of tetrapods, two paralogous genes are
present in teleost genomes, possibly as the result of a fishspecific whole-genome duplication (FSGD) that occurred
~250 to 350 million years ago (mya) in a common ancestor of teleosts (reviewed in [10-13]). Examples of such
duplicated genes include sox10a and sox10b [14], mitfa
and mitfb [15,16], kita and kitb [17], csf1ra and csf1rb [18]
and pomca and pomcb [19], for which at least one of the
duplicates has been shown to participate in pigment cell
development in fish. These genes encode transcription
factors (sox10, mitf), signaling molecules (pomc) or cellsurface receptors (kit, csf1r) and are involved in neural
crest specification (sox10) or commitment of pigment cell
precursors to a particular chromatophore fate (mitf, kit:
melanophores; csf1r: xanthophores).
A major step in chromatophore differentiation is the biosynthesis of the pigment displayed by the respective type
of pigment cells. Although there are sporadic reports of
duplicated genes for pigment synthesis enzymes in specific teleost lineages [20-22], no systematic genomic analysis has been performed so far to determine the complete
set of duplicated pigmentation genes in fish and to better
understand how pigment synthesis pathways as a whole
have been affected by the FSGD.
In the present studies, we have analyzed genes involved in
the biosynthesis of the dark pigment melanin, which is
produced by melanophores [23,24], and of the pteridine
pigments synthesized in xanthophores (reviewed in [25]).
We find that the FSGD had a deep impact on the melanin
synthesis pathway, with three out of four enzyme-encod-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/74

ing genes being duplicates in teleosts. The pteridine synthesis pathway has been affected to a lesser degree by the
FSGD, with two of nine enzymes represented by two teleost-specific paralogs. Several cases of lineage-specific
duplication were also observed in the pteridine pathway.
In both pathways, genes encoding the rate-limiting
enzymes are duplicated in teleosts compared to tetrapods,
with different modes of duplication being involved.

Results
Phylogenetic analyses and synteny studies were applied to
the reconstruction of the evolution of genes involved in
pigmentation pathways in ray-finned fish. The combination of these complementary approaches is particularly
helpful to deduce the evolutionary history of gene families following gene and genome duplication events
(reviewed in [26]). Most genes duplicated during largescale and in particular whole genome duplications are
part of so-called paralogons, i.e., chromosomal blocks of
two or more duplicated (paralogous) genes ([18] and references therein). The detection of such paralogons helps
to draw conclusions on the origin of duplicated genes
when phylogenetic signals are not informative. In the
present study, sequence information from the genome
assemblies of five teleost species – two pufferfish species
(Tetraodon nigroviridis, Takifugu rubripes), medaka (Oryzias
latipes), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)
and zebrafish (Danio rerio) – and from diverse teleost
expressed sequence tag (EST) resources have been compared to data from tetrapods (human, mouse, chicken,
frog) and different invertebrate outgroups (urochordates,
sea urchin, fruitfly, nematodes). The results of these surveys are summarized in Table 1; accession numbers are
given in the Additional files [see Additional files 1, 2].
Gene duplications in the melanin synthesis pathway
Melanin, the dark pigment of melanophores, is synthesized from tyrosine within a specialized organelle, the
melanosome [23,24]. In mammals and birds, two types of
melanin are produced, the black to brown eumelanin and
the lighter pheomelanin, but in teleost fishes only eumelanin has been observed [1]. The eumelanin synthesis
pathway is presented in Figure 1. Disruption of melanogenesis leads to reduced pigmentation intensity culminating in complete albinism [27].
Tyrosinase gene family
Vertebrate melanin synthesis involves the members of the
tyrosinase gene family: tyrosinase (tyr), tyrosinase-related
protein 1 (tyrp1) and dopachrome tautomerase (dct; also
known as tyrosinase-related protein 2) [23,24]. Tyrosinase
(EC 1.14.18.1) promotes the first two rate-limiting steps
of melanin synthesis from tyrosine to DOPA and
DOPAquinone as well as two later steps. Dct (EC
5.3.3.12) converts DOPAchrome to DHICA, and Tyrp1 is

involved in the formation of indole-5,6-quinone carboxylic acid from DHICA (Figure 1). During the early evolution of the chordate lineage, an ancestral tyrosinase gene
was duplicated before the divergence of urochordates and
vertebrates leading to tyrosinase and a tyrosinase-related
gene. The latter one was subsequently duplicated in the
vertebrate lineage giving rise to tyrp1 and dct [28,29].
The phylogeny of the tyrosinase gene family in vertebrates
is presented in Figure 2a. For tyr and tyrp1, duplications
were observed in teleosts, while dct is present as a single
copy in teleosts just like in tetrapods. As shown previously, tyr was duplicated in teleosts during the course of
the FSGD after divergence from the more basal actinopterygian lineages of sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) and gar
(Lepisosteus platyrhynchus) leading to two tyr copies in Takifugu and cichlids [20]. Consistently, two tyr paralogs
were found in pufferfishes, stickleback, medaka and rainbow trout. In the zebrafish, however, only the tyra paralog
was detected, suggesting that tyrb has been lost. The two

tyr paralogs previously reported for the tetraploid rainbow
trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) [22] are – according to the
present phylogeny – the result of the FSGD rather than of
another round of genome duplication in the ancestor of
salmonid fishes [30,31]. Furthermore, synteny data also
provide strong evidence for the duplication of tyr during
the course of the FSGD. In human, TYR is found on chromosome 11q14-q21 and the (co-)orthologs of nearby
genes are also found in close proximity to the tyr paralogs
in pufferfishes, stickleback, medaka and zebrafish (Figure
2b). Most of these genes are present on one of the two paralogous chromosomal blocks (paralogons) in teleost
genomes, but two genes, grm5 and rab38, are also present
in duplicate. The presence of these paralogons in diverse
teleost genomes is consistent with the duplication of tyr
during the course of the FSGD. This is also in agreement
with previous studies showing that the tyr gene-containing chromosomes 13 and 14 from medaka as well as chromosomes 15 and 10 from zebrafish (Figure 2b) are
derived from the same protochromosome [32-34].

sequences suggests the duplication of tyrp1b during the
course of the FSGD [see Additional file 3]. This was also
confirmed by synteny data (Figure 2c), which are generally considered as more reliable than molecular phylogenies to reconstruct large-scale duplication history [26]: the
region of human chromosome 9p23 containing TYRP1 is
syntenic to two tyrp1-containing paralogons in medaka,
stickleback and zebrafish. Accordingly, the respective
medaka chromosomes 1 and 18 have been shown to contain large duplicated segments having been formed from
a same protochromosome by the FSGD [32].

Figure
brates 1
Eumelanin synthesis pathway and gene duplications in verteEumelanin synthesis pathway and gene duplications
in vertebrates. Eumelanin is synthesized from tyrosine
within the melanosome of melanophores. This requires
members of the Tyrosinase family (TYR, DCT, TYRP1) and
probably Silver (SILV). Three melanosomal transporters
(OCA2, AIM1 and SLC24A5) are crucial for proper melanin
synthesis. Red indicates duplications during the fish-specific
genome duplication.
Furthermore, our analysis demonstrated that tyr is not the
only gene found from the melanin pathway to be duplicated in fish. Two paralogs of tyrp1 were identified in
medaka, zebrafish, stickleback and fathead minnow
(Pimephales promelas), while only one complete tyrp1 paralog (tyrp1a) was detected in pufferfishes. In Tetraodon,
additionally a region in scaffold 13631 with partial but
significant sequence similarity to tyrp1b was found. However, some splice sites of this sequence are degenerated
and the putative coding sequence contains a stop codon.
We confirmed the presence of this stop codon by sequencing of genomic DNA [GenBank: EF183530], thus excluding the possibility of a sequencing error. Hence, this
sequence represents most likely a tyrp1b pseudogene.
In the phylogeny of the entire tyrosinase gene family
based on protein sequences (Figure 2a), the tree topology
is not consistent with a duplication of tyrp1 during the
FSGD. In contrast, a separate maximum likelihood phylogeny of vertebrate tyrp1 genes based on nucleotide

In zebrafish, the previously described paralog tyrp1b is
found on chromosome 1 in the present genome assembly
(Zv6) and was mapped to the corresponding linkage
group (LG) 1 [33]. The newly found tyrp1a paralog is
found in Zv6 on chromosome 11, but was not genetically
mapped so far. As a paralogous relationship between
zebrafish chromosomes 1 and 11 has not been reported
so far and since there are frequent discrepancies between
mapping data of zebrafish genes and their chromosomal
assignment in current genome assemblies ([35] and own
observations), we mapped tyrp1a using the radiation
hybrid panel LN54 [36]. The tyrp1a gene was assigned not
to LG 11 (as expected from Zv6 genome assembly analysis) but to LG 7 at a distance of 0.00 cR from marker
Z21714 with a LOD score of 27.4. However, a paralogous
LG1–LG7 relationship has also not been reported for
zebrafish so far. These data suggest the presence of a newly
identified paralogon in the zebrafish genome. Kitb,
another pigmentation gene duplicate that has its origin in
the FSGD [17], is found 3' of tyrp1b (Figure 2c). However,
this gene is not part of the tyrp1 paralogon, as kita is found
on LG 20 and not on LG 7 in zebrafish and the human KIT
is found on chromosome 4 and not on chromosome 9.
Silver
A later step in melanin synthesis from indole-5,6-quinone
carboxylic acid to eumelanin is presumably catalyzed by
the Silver protein (also known as Pmel17) [37,38] (Figure
1). A recent study identified two paralogs of silver (silv) in
the zebrafish [21]. We reconstructed the evolution of the
silv gene in the vertebrate lineage and additionally found
two paralogs of silv in both pufferfishes as well as in
medaka and stickleback, with a tree topology consistent
with a duplication in the course of the FSGD (Figure 3a).
This conclusion is once again strongly supported by synteny data (Figure 3b): human SILV is found on chromosome 12q13-q14, a region that is highly syntenic to
Tetraodon chromosomes 9 and 11, medaka chromosomes
5 and 7 and zebrafish chromosomes 11 and 23, which
contain the silv paralogons. As all these chromosomes
evolved from a same protochromosome through duplication during the FSGD [32-34,39], it is most likely that the
silv duplicates in teleosts stem from this event.

tyrp1 paralogons in stickleback, medaka and zebrafish. A tyrp1b pseudogene is found in Tetraodon (asterisk). Numbered bars
represent genes contributing to conserved synteny, genes that do not contribute to conserved synteny are not shown. Blue
bars indicate genes that are duplicated along with tyr or tyrp1b, respectively. Dotted lines connect orthologous genes. Kitb (grey
bars), another teleost-specific pigmentation gene duplicate [17] is found 3' of tyrp1b in the four teleost genomes but belongs to
a different paralogon (see text).

Melanosomal transporters
Three non-related genes, oca2, aim1 and slc24a5, encode
for transporter proteins residing in the melanosomal
membrane and being essential for melanin synthesis (Figure 1). Loss-of-functions mutations in these genes lead to
reduced melanin pigmentation in teleosts and mammals
[9,40-42]. In contrast to tyr, tyrp1 and silv, all three transporters are encoded by a single gene in the teleost species
analyzed [see Additional file 4].

Gene duplications in the pteridine synthesis pathway
The yellow to reddish pteridine pigments of xanthophores
are synthesized from GTP through the pteridine synthesis
pathway (Figure 4) (reviewed in [25]). The pteridine pathway is composed of three component pathways. The first
one leads to the de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin
(H4biopterin) from GTP. H4biopterin is a cofactor for
neurotransmitter synthesis and tyrosinase activity in
melanophores [25]. The second component is the regenPage 5 of 18

eration pathway of oxidized H4biopterin after it has acted
as cofactor [25]. The third pathway shares several steps
with the first one and leads to the formation of the yellow
pigments, sepiapterin and its derivatives, as well as probably to the reddish drosopterin, which is also found in teleost fishes, especially in poecilids [43].
GTP cyclohydrolase I and its feedback regulatory protein
The first, rate limiting step in pteridine synthesis is catalyzed by the GTP cyclohydrolase I (GchI; EC 3.5.4.16)
(Figure 4). GchI expression is an initial step for melanophore and xanthophore differentiation due to its involvement in the different component pathways [25]. Only one
gchI gene has been reported so far in vertebrates, including
the teleosts rainbow trout [44] and zebrafish [45]. The
present survey for gchI sequences in vertebrates, however,
revealed an unexpected diversity of gchI genes in teleosts
and amphibians (Figure 5). While a single gchI gene was
found in mammals and birds, two gchI genes were identified in frog, medaka, zebrafish, and fathead minnow, and
even three genes are present in pufferfishes and stickle-

back. Taking conserved syntenies into account, three
groups of gchI genes became obvious.
The first group, termed gchIa, is phylogenetically well
defined and includes the single gchI gene from mammals
and birds and one copy from frog and teleosts including
the known rainbow trout gene. All vertebrate gchIa
orthologs are found within a region of conserved synteny.
In rainbow trout, even two copies of gchIa are found,
which might be the result of the salmonid autotetraploidization event that occurred 25 to 100 mya [30,31]. Paralogs of other pigment synthesis enzymes in trout and/or
salmon (silv, gchfr, dhprb, pam; Figure 6,Table 1, [see Additional files 1, 2]) might also have resulted from this salmonid-specific genome duplication.
The second group of gchI genes, gchIb, consists of the second gchI gene from frog, the previously known zebrafish
gene and further teleost genes. The orthology of gchIb
genes is well supported by conserved syntenies between
frog and teleosts. The third group, gchIc, has been found

Figure 4
Pteridine synthesis pathway and gene duplications in vertebrates
Pteridine synthesis pathway and gene duplications in vertebrates. Pteridine synthesis contains three component pathways [25]: the de novo synthesis of H4biopterin from GTP (top line), the H4biopterin regeneration pathway (grey) and the synthesis of yellow pteridine pigments. The formation of orange drosopterin has not been elucidated yet in vertebrates. In
Drosophila, the clot enzyme is involved [53], which corresponds to the vertebrate Txnl5 protein. Asterisks indicate hypothetical reactions and question marks unidentified enzymes. Red indicates duplications during the fish-specific genome duplication,

so far only in pufferfishes, stickleback and the gilthead
seabream (Sparus aurata) and is also phylogenetically and
syntenically well defined.
How are the three gchI groups related to each other? We
confirmed by RHP mapping the chromosomal allocations
of gchIa and gchIb in the zebrafish genome assembly on
chromosomes 17 and 12, respectively. GchIa was assigned
to LG 17 at a distance of 0.00 cR from marker fc19b04
with a LOD score of 18.4. GchIb was mapped to LG 12 at
a distance of 0.00 cR from marker fc18g04 with a LOD
score of 15.3. As LG 17 and LG 12 do not seem to have
evolved by protochromosome duplication during the
FSGD [33] and due to the presence of gchIb in amphibians, the duplication that led to gchIa and gchIb seems to be
older than the split between ray-finned fishes and tetrapods. Both gchIa and gchIb genes are found in proximity to
members of the socs gene family: gchIa is linked to socs4 in
all vertebrates examined, gchIb to socs5 in frog and
zebrafish (Figure 5a). Socs4 and socs5 are the closest
related members within the socs gene family [46]. Therefore it seems most likely that gchIa/b and socs4/5 precursors were duplicated together, possibly during one of the
two earlier rounds of genome duplication having taken
place during the early evolution of the vertebrate lineage

(1R or 2R) [30,47,48]. Socs5 is also found in mammals
and birds within a syntenic region that resembles the gchIb
region of frog and teleosts (Figure 5b) suggesting that
gchIb was lost secondarily in these lineages. The human
regions containing GCHIA/SOCS4 and SOCS5 are found
on chromosomes 14 (Figure 5a) and 2 (Figure 5b), respectively, which were shown to contain many paralogous
genes that arose during the 1R/2R genome duplications
[48].
The origin of gchIc found in pufferfishes, stickleback and
gilthead seabream remains unclear. Genes surrounding
gchIc are not related to those of the other gchI regions and
the human orthologs of these genes are found on chromosome 19q13. The corresponding chromosomal region on
medaka chromosome 4 seems to be highly conserved in
gene order with pufferfishes and stickleback, but a large
gap is found in the medaka genome assembly between
pik3r2 and ankrd47 (not shown). Thus, gchIc might also be
present in medaka but absent from the current genome
assembly. However, no EST or shotgun trace sequence
from medaka was found that could represent gchIc. In
zebrafish, a less conserved chromosomal block is found
on chromosome 2. If gchIc genes arose as a paralog of
gchIa or gchIb as result of the FSGD, one would expect to

find gchIc on other chromosomes (Tetraodon: chr 14 or 3;
medaka: chr 24 or 8; zebrafish: chr 20 or 3) [32-34]. Thus,
there is no evidence that gchIc has been formed during the
FSGD and its relationships to the other gchI groups
remain elusive. It might be possible that gchIc arose by a
lineage-specific gene duplication or that it is also a remnant of earlier rounds of genome duplication in vertebrates that has been maintained only in some teleost
lineages.
The GchI enzymatic activity is regulated by the
H4biopterin-dependent GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback
regulatory protein (Gchfr) [49]. In most teleost species, a
single gchfr gene was found. In contrast, two gchfr genes
were identified in rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar) (Figure 6). The phylogeny suggests duplication of gchfr in the common ancestor of these salmonid
fishes, which fits well the salmonid autotetraploidization
event [30,31].

6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase
Subsequent steps of pteridine synthesis are catalyzed by
the 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (Pts; EC
4.2.3.12) and the sepiapterin reductase (Spr; EC
1.1.1.153) (Figure 4). In the guppy, pts expression correlates with the presence of xanthophore-based yellow color
patterns [50]. A single pts gene was found in all vertebrates
analyzed including teleosts [see Additional file 5a].

Sepiapterin reductase (Spr) catalyzes the next three steps
towards H4biopterin (as well as a step in the third component pathway; see below). We could identify only one spr
gene in tetrapods as well as in medaka and Tetraodon. In
zebrafish, stickleback and Takifugu, however, two spr
genes were found (Figure 7). Although the relationships
between spr genes are phylogenetically not fully resolved,
the genomic regions containing the duplicated teleost spr
genes are syntenic to each other as well as to human chromosome 2, where SPR is found (Figure 7b). Both teleost
spr genes are in close proximity to paralogs of smyd1. Additional duplicated genes are also found in these chromosomal regions. Furthermore, zebrafish chromosomes 5
and 8, which contain spra and sprb, respectively, evolved
from the same pre-FSGD protochromosome [33,34]. It is
therefore most likely that the spr duplicates found in some
teleost lineages are remnants of the FSGD.
Enzymes of the H4biopterin regeneration pathway
The H4biopterin regeneration pathway involves the
enzymes Pcbd (pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase/dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor
1 alpha (TCF1); EC 4.2.1.96) and Dhpr (Dihydropteridine reductase; EC 1.5.1.34) [25]. Pcbd is a bifunctional
protein having a function as a dimerizing co-factor of the
HNF1 homeobox transcription factors in addition to its
enzymatic activity. A transcriptional target of the Pcbd/
HNF1 complex is the tyrosinase promoter, pointing to a
particular importance for melanophore differentiation in
human [51]. In contrast to invertebrates, two pcbd genes,
pcbd1 and pcbd2, were found in tetrapods and teleosts
(Figure 8a), which is consistent with a previous analysis of
this gene family [52]. Thus, pcbd was duplicated early in
the vertebrate lineage, possibly during one of the two
rounds of genome duplication (1R/2R). Two copies of
pcbd1 were identified in Takifugu. While one copy
(located in scaffold 53) has the usual structure with four
coding exons, the other copy (scaffold 178) consists of a
single exon (Figure 8b). A polyA sequence downstream of
the stop codon and target site duplications indicative of a
retrotransposition event were detected (not shown). Furthermore, a mutation in pcbd1 from scaffold 178 turned
codon 31 into a premature stop codon (Figure 8b). Thus,
this pcbd1 copy most likely represents a "processed" pseudogene generated by retrotransposition of a pcbd1 mRNA.

based on 313 AA positions. The tree is rooted with Spr from fruitfly. Numbers at the branches denote bootstrap values (maximum likelihood/neighbor joining) above 50%. Groups are assigned according to synteny. (b) Synteny of spr regions in vertebrates. The human SPR region is syntenic to two spr paralogons in Takifugu (Tru), stickleback (Gac) and zebrafish (Dre). sprb
was possibly lost in Tetraodon (Tni) and medaka (Ola). Numbered bars represent genes contributing to conserved synteny,
genes that do not contribute to conserved synteny are not shown. Blue indicates genes that are duplicated along with spr. Dotted lines connect orthologous genes.

Several types of duplications have affected dhpr genes in
teleosts (Figure 9). First of all, while a single dhpr gene is
found in tetrapods as well as in pufferfishes, medaka and
stickleback, two dhpr copies are present in salmon, trout
and fathead minnow. The zebrafish genome contains
even three copies of dhpr. Two major clades of dhpr genes
become apparent in teleosts through phylogenetic analysis. The first clade, termed dhpra, consists of most of the
teleost sequences including pufferfishes, medaka, stickleback, the zebrafish sequence found on chromosome 14
and one copy each of salmon, trout and fathead minnow.
The second clade, dhprb, contains the second copy from
salmon, trout and fathead minnow as well as the two
zebrafish sequences found on chromosome 1 in scaffolds
64 and 67, respectively. These two zebrafish paralogs on
chromosome 1 obviously arose by duplication in the family Cyprinidae and encode putative proteins that show
82% sequence similarity. Both copies of dhprb, termed
dhprba (scaffold 64) and dhprbb (scaffold 67), could be
amplified by PCR and sequenced from zebrafish cDNA
with paralog-specific primer sets [GenBank: EF183528,
EF183529], excluding genome assembly artifacts. In the
zebrafish genome assembly, additional but partial
sequences of dhprba and dhprbb are present in scaffold 63

and scaffold 67, respectively. These sequences were not
included in further analyses.
The analysis of the dhpr-containing regions in vertebrate
genomes revealed that the two main clades, dhpra and
dhprb, might originate from the FSGD (Figure 9b): Genes
surrounding the human DHPR gene on chromosome 4
are found in vicinity to the teleost dhpra gene (Tetraodon:
chr 20; medaka: chr 10: zebrafish: chr 14) as well as on
another chromosome (Tetraodon: chr 18; medaka: chr 1;
zebrafish: chr 1). All these chromosomes evolved by
duplication of the same protochromosome during the
course of the FSGD [34]. Later on, dhprb was further duplicated in the lineage leading to zebrafish probably through
intrachromosomal gene duplication. This led to the formation of dhprba and dhprbb on chromosome 1, where
they are separated by approximately 1 Mb.
Enzymes involved in pteridine pigment synthesis
The third component pathway that leads to the formation
of the yellow pteridine sepiapterin and its derivatives
branches off from the first component pathway by hypothetical enzymatic reactions (Figure 4). Subsequent reactions require Spr (see above) and Xod/Xdh (xanthine

a single gene in teleost genomes [see Additional file 5b].
The biosynthetic pathway for the reddish drosopterin has
not been elucidated yet in vertebrates and only one
enzyme of the pathway in Drosophila, clot, has been characterized at the molecular level [53]. A single thioredoxinlike 5 gene, the vertebrate ortholog of Drosophila clot, is
found in tetrapods and teleosts as well [see Additional file
5c].
Finally, the switch between the H4biopterin and sepiapterin synthesis might be regulated by PAM (protein
associated with Myc), which is affected in the zebrafish
esrom mutant that has reduced yellow pigmentation [54].
The pam gene is single-copy in teleosts and tetrapods [see

Discussion
Duplication of pigmentation genes: molecular mechanisms
and evolutionary fates
In the present study, we have analyzed the two major pigment synthesis pathways in vertebrates, the melanin and

the pteridine pathways, with respect to gene and genome
duplications particularly within the teleost lineage. Seventeen vertebrate pigmentation genes were analyzed and
various modes of duplication were observed. On the one
hand, different rounds of genome duplication have
expanded several pigment gene families. Five clear cases
of FSGD-based duplications (tyr, tyrp1, silv, spr, dhpr) were
found (29%). Other duplications might be the result of
earlier rounds of genome duplication (1R/2R) [30,47] in
the vertebrate stem lineage (gchIa/b, pcbd1/2). In addition,
gene duplications generated by the recent salmonid-specific autotetraploidization [30,31] could be also detected
(silv, gchIa, gchfr, dhprb, pam). On the other hand, lineagespecific local gene duplications were also identified: the
duplication of dhprb in the zebrafish, the duplication by
retrotransposition of pcbd1 in Takifugu and possibly the
occurrence of gchIc in a common ancestor of pufferfishes,
stickleback and perciforms. Although the majority of
duplicated genes in vertebrate genomes were created by
whole genome duplications [55], lineage-specific duplications of pigmentation genes, which have also been found
for the urochordate Ciona intestinalis [29], seem to be a
common theme in chordate evolution. In conclusion, teleost fishes have a greater potential repertoire of pigment

synthesis genes than all other vertebrate groups. However,
entirely duplicated synthesis pathways are not observed,
and the function of both paralogs in pigmentation pathways remains generally to be demonstrated.

certain substrate [64]. Whether and how functional divergence of duplicated pigment synthesis enzymes has
occurred in teleosts will be an important focus of future
studies.

The impact of genome duplications on entire metabolic
pathways in the vertebrate lineage has been studied so far
only for the glycolysis [56]. Based on a similar approach
to that used in the present study, the authors showed that
none of the three rounds of genome duplication in the
vertebrate lineage (1R/2R/FSGD) led to a completely
duplicated glycolytic pathway in extant genomes. In total,
46% of the glycolytic enzymes in vertebrates were duplicated in teleosts due to the FSGD (11 of 24 enzymes) [56].
Here, 75% (3/4) of the melanogenic enzymes and 22%
(2/9) of the enzymes from the pteridine pathway were
found to be duplicated during the FSGD. Although the
value for melanogenesis seems to be elevated in comparison to pteridine synthesis and glycolysis, all differences
between the three pathways (glycolysis, melanogenesis
and pteridine pathway) are statistically not significant (χ2test, p > 0,05).

Evolution of the melanin synthesis pathway
The melanin synthesis pathway involves four enzymes.
Three of them were found to be duplicated in teleosts as
result of the FSGD. In the tyrosinase gene family, FSGDduplication was observed for tyr and tyrp1, while dct was
present as a single copy gene in all lineages analyzed.
However, the retention of tyrosinase gene family members after the FSGD is variable between the different lineages (Table 1). Tyra was lost in the zebrafish and tyrp1b in
the pufferfishes, while medaka and stickleback have
retained both copies of tyr and tyrp1. Thus, the tyrosinase
gene family is a good example for divergent resolution,
i.e., differential loss of gene duplicates in divergent lineages, a mechanism that might facilitate speciation [13,6567].

Generally, three different fates of duplicated genes are
observed (reviewed by [10]). In most cases, one duplicate
gets lost due to functional redundancy. This process of
non-functionalization was estimated to have occurred in
a range of 76% of FSGD duplicates in zebrafish [57] and
76 to 85% in the pufferfish lineage [33,39,58]. Here, for
pigmentation genes 71% (12/17) were found to be
reduced from two to one copy in teleosts after the FSGD
but before the split of Ostariophysii (zebrafish) and Neoteleostei (medaka, stickleback and pufferfishes). Including lineage-specific losses, the ratio of nonfunctionalization for pigment synthesis genes is 82% (14/
17) for pufferfish and medaka and 76% (13/17) for stickleback and zebrafish suggesting that pigment synthesis
genes do not deviate from the global trend. Two other
fates of gene duplicates might lead to the retention of both
copies within a genome. Either one copy obtains a new
function (neo-functionalization) or the original gene
functions are divided between the two duplicates (subfunctionalization). Recently, it was shown that combinations of both mechanisms are possible (sub-neo-functionalization) [59]. Asymmetric evolution, which might be an
indicator for neo-functionalization, has been observed for
many duplicated genes in teleosts [58,60,61] including
pigmentation genes [18]. Neo-functionalization of duplicated enzymes can lead, for example, to the evolution of
new substrate specificities [62] or even of entirely new
functions not associated with the enzymatic property
[63]. Subfunctionalization of duplicated enzymes might
occur at the level of gene expression leading, e.g., to tissuespecific expression ([56] and references therein) or at the
protein level, when a duplicate becomes specialized for a

Mutational disruption of melanin synthesis at different
steps of the pathway might lead to diverse forms of albinism [27]. Tyrosinase is the first, rate-limiting enzyme of
melanogenesis. In the zebrafish, loss-of-function in the
single tyr gene, tyra, leads to an albino phenotype [68]. In
the medaka, several albino mutants were identified that
are also affected in the tyra paralog [69]. Our data provide
evidence for the presence of tyrb in the medaka but the
functions of this paralog in teleosts remain unresolved.
No tyrb mutant is available at present in fish. The fact that
some tyra mutations in the medaka lead to a complete
albino phenotype [69] suggests that tyrb cannot substitute
for tyra. This is in agreement with functional studies of the
two tyr duplicates in the rainbow trout [22]: simultaneous
morpholino knock-down of both paralogs reduces pigmentation in the eye and the skin to the same amount as
knocking-down tyr paralogs separately. Since knock-down
of tyrb gene function in the rainbow trout leads to reduced
pigmentation in the eye and the skin [22], tyrb seems to be
involved in melanin synthesis too. Tyrosinase is involved
in several steps of melanogenesis (Figure 1), and it is
therefore possible that teleosts tyr paralogs might have
become subfunctionalized and specialized for individual
steps of the pathway.
There is so far no evidence supporting the functional
divergence of tyrp1 paralogs in fish. Mutation of tyrp1 in
mammals leads to reduced pigmentation [27]. No tyrp1
mutant has been identified in teleosts until today, possibly due to a functional redundancy of tyrp1 duplicates.
Interestingly, in the present study a putative regulator of
Tyrp1 function was also found to be duplicated in teleosts
as result of the FSGD: tyr duplicates in teleosts are genetically linked to duplicates of rab38 (Figure 2b). Rab38 is

thought to play a role in sorting Tyrp1 to the melanosome
in mice [70].
The duplication of the silver gene has been previously
described in the zebrafish [21]. Our study shows that this
duplication is indeed the result of the FSGD and that silver
has also been retained in duplicate in pufferfishes,
medaka and stickleback. In zebrafish, silva is expressed in
melanophores and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
of the eye, while silvb expression is restricted to the RPE
[21]. The expression of silv paralogs is similar to the
expression of duplicated mitf transcription factor genes
[15]. In mammals, Silv transcription is dependent on Mitf
[71,72]. It will be highly interesting to investigate the differential regulation of silv paralogs by Mitf duplicates in
different teleost lineages.
Due to the limited knowledge of gene functions it remains
elusive at present, whether there is a correlation between
excess of genes involved in melanin synthesis and the vast
diversity of coloration in fish. Functional experiments on
the divergence of pigmentation gene duplicates are currently carried out in our laboratory to elucidate this question.
Evolution of the pteridine synthesis pathway
The pteridine synthesis pathway has been less affected by
the FSGD than the melanin pathway, but several cases of
lineage-specific duplication were observed.

GchI is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of pteridine synthesis. In this analysis, we have observed an unforeseen
diversity of gchI genes in vertebrates. We could identify
two clades of gchI genes, gchIa and gchIb, which most
likely arose through genome duplication during early vertebrate evolution, as well as a third clade of unresolved
origin, gchIc, which is only found in some teleost species.
The GchI enzyme is required at the initial step of the synthesis of both H4biopterin and pteridine pigments (Figure
4). GchIa has been found in all vertebrate lineages and is
therefore most likely involved in H4bioterin formation.
GchIb is only found in those lineages that possess xanthophores: teleost fishes and amphibians. Furthermore, gchIb
from zebrafish, which is a paralog of the mammalian
gchIa (and not its ortholog as previously thought), is
expressed in the xanthophore lineage (but also in melanophores and neurons) [45]. We therefore propose that
gchIb plays a major role in the synthesis of pteridine pigments of xanthophores and that it was lost secondarily in
mammals and birds concomitantly to the loss of xanthophores in these lineages. Functional studies in teleosts and
amphibians will be necessary to test this hypothesis.
Spr is involved in both the de novo synthesis of H4bioterin
and the production of pteridine pigment after the split

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/74

between both component pathways (Figure 4). Interestingly, the spr gene is found to be duplicated as result of the
FSGD in zebrafish, stickleback and Tetraodon. It might be
possible that each of the spr paralogs has become specialized for one component pathway, but expression data for
duplicated teleost spr genes are not available at present.
Sprb paralogs might have been lost quite recently in
medaka as well as in Tetraodon after its split from Takifugu. This is a good example for the former observation
that anciently duplicated genes still can be lost after millions of years [55].
Finally, dhpr in zebrafish illustrates how different evolutionary scenarios can progressively shape pigmentation
gene families. After the duplication of dhpr in the FSGD,
both dhpr paralogs were retained in Ostariophysii
(zebrafish, fathead minnow) until dhprb was further
duplicated in the zebrafish lineage, while dhprb was apparently lost from pufferfishes, medaka and stickleback.
Evolution by genome duplication: the pigmentary system
The evolutionary significance of whole genome duplications is still widely debated. The two presumed rounds of
genome duplication early in the vertebrate lineage (1R/
2R) have been linked to an increase in phenotypic complexity and to the evolution of vertebrate-specific traits
such as the neural crest [30,47]. Several authors have suggested that the divergent evolution of duplicates generated by the FSGD might be involved in species diversity in
teleost fishes, which represent approximately 50% of all
vertebrate species (reviewed in [10-13]). However, these
hypotheses have been questioned based on the fossil
record [73]. In addition, a reduced probability of extinction in teleost fishes compared to other vertebrates probably due to the FSGD has been proposed, since
mutational robustness, increased genetic variation, and
increased tolerance to environmental conditions could be
by-products of genome duplication [74].

With regard to the pigmentary system, it has been previously suggested that the FSGD had a major importance for
the evolution of pigmentation genes in teleost fish [18].
The present study puts further evidence in this direction
by showing that pigment synthesis pathways (and the
melanin synthesis pathway in particular) have been
affected by the FSGD. Interestingly, the genetic repertoire
for color perception, i.e., the opsin gene family, has also
been expanded by duplications in the teleost lineage
[75,76]. It remains to be elucidated whether the diversity
and complexity of coloration observed in teleost fishes
compared to other vertebrate groups are causally linked to
the expansion of pigmentation gene families as result of
the FSGD. This FSGD might also have provided the
genetic raw material for the diversity of coloration within
teleosts since species-specific sequence evolution of dupli-

cated genes is a common mechanism in this group [61].
Furthermore, our study points out lineage-specific patterns of loss and retention of duplicated pigmentation
genes in teleosts. Divergent resolution of duplicated genes
might facilitate speciation events [13,65-67].

Conclusion
The present study shows that teleost fishes have a greater
repertoire of pigment synthesis genes than any other vertebrate group mainly due to the fish-specific genome
duplication but also as result of other types of gene duplications. Thus, pigmentation genes from teleosts offer an
excellent opportunity to study the effects of gene and
genome duplication on gene regulatory, protein-protein
interaction and metabolic networks (e.g., specification of
chromatophore fates, receptor-ligand interactions and
pigment synthesis, respectively) and their connections.
Future studies on functional divergence of duplicated pigmentation genes will reveal important insights into the
significance of gene and genome duplication for the evolution of vertebrate phenotypes.

phylogenies were chosen. These were either the closest
human paralog to the gene under investigation (in case of
larger vertebrate gene families) or invertebrate orthologs.
Final protein maximum likelihood phylogenies were
computed with PHYML [82,83] with 100 bootstrap replicates. Models of protein evolution and parameter values
were determined with ProtTest [84]. PAUP [85] was used
to obtain neighbor-joining bootstrap values of 10,000
replicates.
Synteny analyses
Syntenic relationships between human and teleosts
genomes within the chromosomal regions containing the
gene of interest were inferred using the Reciprocal Blast
Hit method [26].

Sequences of 15–20 genes surrounding the human
ortholog were used as initial queries for BLAST searches
against the five teleost genome assemblies at Ensembl
[77], followed by reciprocal BLAST searches of the best
hits against human and other teleost genomes.

Methods
Sequence database surveys
Nucleotide sequences of pigmentation genes from rayfinned fishes were identified using BLAST searches against
GenBank (nr and EST databases), the current genome
assemblies and Trace Archives at Ensembl [77] of
zebrafish (Zv 6), medaka (version 1), Tetraodon (version
7), Fugu (version 4.0), stickleback (BROAD S1) as well as
TIGR gene indices [78] of cichlids (Astatotilapia burtoni,
Haplochromis chilotes and Haplochromis sp. 'red tail sheller'), catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), rainbow trout and salmon. Usually the human
gene was used as query sequence. If necessary, coding
sequences were annotated manually from genome assemblies based on sequence homology to other species. In
some cases species-specific EST clusters were assembled.
Similarly, sequences from human, mouse, chicken, frog,
ascidian (Ciona intestinalis), sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus), fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) and nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) were obtained from GenBank or Ensembl under inclusion of information given in
ref. 29.
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic reconstructions
All nucleotide sequences obtained from BLAST searches
were loaded into BioEdit [79], translated into proteins,
and aligned using ClustalW [80] as implemented in
BioEdit. Alignments were carefully checked and ambiguously aligned regions were removed prior to phylogeny
analyses. Identical sequences were removed.

Larger draft neighbour-joining trees were obtained with
MEGA3 [81]. Based on these trees, outgroups for final

Radiation hybrid panel mapping
The zebrafish radiation hybrid panel LN54 [36] was used
according to the supplier's instructions (Marc Ekker, University of Ottawa) to map tyrp1a, gchIa and gchIb. The following primer sets were used: Dre-tyrp1a-ex1F: 5'ATGTTTGGACTTTATGGA GC-3', Dre-tyrp1a-ex1R: 5'GTCAAACCCGCTGTAGTTC-3' (annealing temperature

obtained RHVECTORs were submitted to the LN54 radiation hybrid map website [86] to get chromosomal positions.
Sequencing of Tetraodon tyrp1b pseudogene and
zebrafish dhprb genes
The Tetraodon tyrpb1 pseudogene was amplified from
genomic DNA and sequenced using primers Tni-ps-trp1bF1 (5'- AACCTGGACACAAAGCCTCAC-3') and Tni-pstrp1b-R1 (5'-ATGGTAGGAGAGAGCACGCAC-3') (TA:

Zebrafish (strain WüAB) total RNA was extracted from
various adult tissues using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen,
Karlsruhe, Germany). cDNA was synthesized with the
RevertAid TM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas
Life Science, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and pooled. Dhprb
sequences were amplified from the cDNA pool using paralog specific primer sets: Dre-dhprba-ex1F: 5'-CTCGTGAAGACAGAATGGCAG-3',
