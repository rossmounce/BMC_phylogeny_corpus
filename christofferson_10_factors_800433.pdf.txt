Abstract
Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is an arbovirus of public health importance in the genus Flavivirus, a group of
positive sense RNA viruses. The NS3 gene has a high level of substitutions and is phylogenetically informative. Likewise,
substitutions in the envelope region have been postulated to enable viruses to subvert immune responses. Analysis of
these genes among isolates from positive mosquitoes collected in Louisiana illustrates the variation present in the
regions and provides improved insight to a phylogenetic model. Employing a GIS eco-regionalization method, we
hypothesized that WNV pool positivity was correlated with regional environmental characteristics. Further, we
postulated that the phylogenetic delineations would be associated with variations in regional environmental
conditions.
Results: Type of regional land cover was a significant effect (p < 0.0001) in the positive pool prediction, indicating that
there is an ecological component driving WNV activity. Additionally, month of collection was significant (p < 0.0001);
and thus there is a temporal component that contributes to the probability of getting a positive mosquito pool. All
virus isolates are of the WNV 2002 lineage. There appears to be some diversity within both forested and wetland areas;
and the possibility of a distinct clade in the wetland samples.
Conclusions: The phylogenetic analysis shows that there has been no reversion in Louisiana from the 2002 lineage
which replaced the originally introduced strain. Our pool positivity model serves as a basis for future testing, and could
direct mosquito control and surveillance efforts. Understanding how land cover and regional ecology effects mosquito
pool positivity will greatly help focus mosquito abatement efforts. This would especially help in areas where abatement
programs are limited due to either funding or man power. Moreover, understanding how regional environments drive
phylogenetic variation will lead to a greater understanding of the interactions between ecology and disease
prevalence.
Background
West Nile Virus (WNV) is the most widely distributed
arbovirus in the world, occurring on all continents save
Antarctica [1]. Its lack of vector specificity compared to
other arboviruses has allowed it to use a wide variety of
mosquito species in its enzootic cycles [2]. WNV was
introduced into the United States in 1999 and from its
entry point of New York City it spread across the continental United States. Phylogenetic evidence traced this
strain to a similar strain isolated in Israel in 1998 [2]. In

2001 a new WNV strain appeared. In 2002, this genotype
became the dominant WN02 strain that was significantly
associated with an increase in numbers of human morbidity and mortality cases in the US. In fact, the number
of deaths from 1999-2001 were significantly less than the
number of deaths in 2002 alone, though whether this
association is due to direct virulence in humans or an
indirect result of the virulence in birds remains unclear
[1,3,4].
WNV is a member of the genus Flavivirus, a group of
positive sense RNA viruses. The genome is composed of
a single open reading frame that produces ten viral proteins: three structural proteins (capsid C, membrane
prM/M, envelope E) and seven non-structural proteins

(NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3 NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [5]. The
NS3 gene plays an important role in the replication of the
virus, encoding a protein with four functions: a serine
protease, a nucleoside triphosphatase, an RNA 5'triphosphatase, and a helicase [5]. Phylogenetic analyses of
WNV have most commonly utilized differences in the
envelope protein, but the capsid, prM protein, and nonstructural proteins have also been informative [4,6-12].
Analyses done on complete genomes have given similar
results to trees made from prM and envelope proteins [4].
To determine the genetic variability in Louisiana, the
envelope coding and NS3 coding regions were analyzed.
The NS3 gene has a high level of substitution and is phylogenetically informative [11] and mutations in the envelope region have been postulated to enable viruses to
subvert immune responses [13]. Analysis of these genes
would illustrate the variation present in Louisiana as well
as provide improved insight for our phylogenetic model.
Many phylogenetic studies have been geographically
focused [6,8,14,15]. Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) based "region" classifications were successfully used
to model WNV transmission risk in humans in northeast
Ohio where local environmental features to model transmission [16]. Employing a similar eco-regionalization
method, we hypothesized that WNV pool positivity was
correlated with regional environmental characteristics.
Further, we postulated that the phylogenetic delineations
would be associated with variations in regional environmental conditions.

Results
Positive Pool Predictors

The data used in the modelling study were from several
parishes in Louisiana during 2007. There were 611 positives reported by the Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, 165 in our target parishes. Classification
regions were constructed based on land cover data from
the Louisiana GIS Digital Map, May 2007(Figure 1). The
land cover of a parish was determined by the majority
rule. Ouachita and Caddo parishes are, for example, 5075% forest lands; East Baton Rouge is a majority developed area comprised mostly of the urbanized capital of
Baton Rouge [17]. Iberville Parish is classified as wetlands, defined as low lying areas saturated with moisture.
Before building the WNV model, we tested several factors via multinomial regression to determine whether
these were significant predictors of the mosquito species
found, regardless of WNV positivity. Interestingly, no factors (land cover, month) were significant for the 2007
data. Therefore, it was determined that no noteworthy
correlation existed between these variables and thus no
colinearity issues would arise by inclusion of all variables
in the model.

Page 2 of 8

The model originally included the effects of month,
mosquito genus and species; but through a stepwise
selection procedure, the variable species was not significant at the alpha = 0.05 level and thus eliminated from
the model. This is likely due to the overwhelming number
of Culex quinquefasciatus, which comprised over 61% of
the total pools (Ntotal = 3246) and 88% of the positive
pools (Table 1). This is consistent with earlier studies
where Cx. quinquefasciatus was found to be the most
abundant and likely epizootic vector for the virus [18,19].
In addition, all interactions were not significant and
therefore removed from the model.
Locations of isolates were coded according to land
cover. The model included land cover, genus, and month.
Type of regional land cover was a significant effect (p <
0.0001) indicating that there is an ecological component
driving WNV activity. Additionally, month was significant (p < 0.0001); and thus there is a temporal component
that contributes to the probability of getting a positive
mosquito pool. This trend can be seen in figure 2.
The pair wise differences in least squares means are
given in table 2 with Tukey adjusted p-values showing
where the significant differences lay. Forested lands are
clearly more likely to have a positive mosquito pool as
compared to developed areas and wetlands. Similarly,
August appears to be the month where a positive mosquito pool is more likely. August and July are eight and six
times more likely to see a positive mosquito pool than
June, respectively. Interestingly, August and July are not
significantly different from the months of SeptemberNovember. All months are significantly different from
June, which is the least likely month during the accepted
transmission season to have a positive pool; the odds of a
positive pool is over seven times more likely in July than
June. The overall trends of land cover and month are
shown together in Figure 2.
Phylogenetic Analysis

The phylogenetic tree resulting from the contiguous segment comprised of the envelope and NS3 sequences is
shown in figure 3. All samples are, unsurprisingly, of the
2002 lineage. However, there appears to be some diversity
within both forested and wetland areas. Particularly,
there is a possible small sub-group with samples 4893,
8441, and 3077. The samples from the wetlands show the
possibility of a distinctive group; in particular, sample
numbers 3766 and 3767. There is a clear delineation
between forest and wetland samples based on two nucleotide substitutions in the NS3 gene: an adenine to guanine at positions 5760, and a cytosine to uracil at position
6324., Samples were grouped as follows: Israel 1998 as the
root; the wetlands as a group; a small grouping of forest
samples; a NY99 group; and the remaining were grouped

together as representative of the North American 2002
clade. The between and within distances were computed
according to the Jukes-Cantor model (table 3). Genetic
diversity within Louisiana was modest when compared to
isolates from a wide geographic range. The genetic distances within the eco-regions (forest vs. wetlands) in
Louisiana were greater than the distances comparing
Louisiana and those strains from outside of Louisiana.
Table 4 identifies sample origins, classifications, and
accession numbers.

Discussion
In some locations, WNV positivity in mosquito pools
serves as a predictor for human cases [14]. Our findings
that the month of collection and eco-region were significant predictors of positive pools suggest that ecological
and temporal factors influence WNV activity and can
assist the public health sector predict or prevent cases of
human WNV infection. Mosquito abatement programs

are operated on a parish-wide basis, so any useful model
would ideally work for the parish as a whole. Therefore,
looking at the ecology of the parish as a whole- and even
grouping parishes into ecological regions or types- will
assist in determining a robust model as we did in our pool
positivity model, can be used at the very least, on a parish
level. Ideally, a model would serve the state as a whole,
focusing on regional activity.
Phylogenetic analysis will also help us better understand how the changes in the genome may lead to a
change in virulence. It is interesting that the statistical
model predicts positive pools in forested areas while the
phylogenetic study shows more diversity in the wetland
areas. It is also interesting that there is more genetic
diversity within Louisiana than without. That is, the
diversity when comparing between the wetlands and forests within Louisiana is greater than the diversity when
comparing the Louisiana isolates and those outside of the
state. This suggests that WNV evolution is not as con-

strained in Louisiana as compared to other locations as
has been suggested by others [20]. Further, some component of eco-regions could have an important role in
diversification. This could be due to a difference in bird
populations found in each of these ecologies, or it could
be a function of extrinsic, microhabitat conditions, such
as temperature or humidity which could exert a selection
pressure on the viruses.

Conclusions
The phylogenetic analysis shows that there has been no
reversion in Louisiana from the 2002 lineage which

replaced the originally introduced strain. Our statistical
model serves as a basis for future testing, directing mosquito control efforts and surveillance programs. Though
we believe our findings to be a significant start to a potentially long term project, it was not without its pitfalls. For
example, there is a confounding factor of spatial clustering of the ecologies tested. However, if the spatial component was the only source of diversity, thus discounting the
ecological diversity, we would not expect that the phylogenetic signature of the Southern Louisiana strains
should be markedly different in topology than the Northern Louisiana strains. The fact that the wetland strains
formed a distinct monophyletic group as compared to the
forest strains, which were characterized by a lack of phylogenetic structure, suggests the diversity seen within
these regions is the result of some other, perhaps ecological, characteristic.
Additionally, the specificity of the land cover classification needs to be more precise. This land cover generalization to parish is a good start to determine if further
investigation is garnered, and here we show that it is.
Understanding how land cover and regional ecology
effects mosquito pool positivity will help focus mosquito
abatement efforts. This would especially help in areas
where abatement programs are limited due to either
funding or man power. Moreover, understanding how
regional environments drive phylogenetic variation will
lead to a greater understanding of the interactions
between ecology and disease prevalence.

According to the mosquito surveillance data, there are
two primary species of mosquitoes that serve as possible
WNV vectors to people in Louisiana: Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus. There were twenty six species from eight genera captured and submitted for
testing. Of these, fifteen species were found to be positive
for WNV (Table 1).

Mosquito Trap Sites and Field Collection of Mosquitoes

Data was provided by parish mosquito control departments. Each parish operates independently with its own
trapping protocols and methods. Not all parishes actively
sampled throughout the year due to considerations of the
local mosquito activity levels. We therefore analyzed the
months that all target parishes had in common (JuneNovember), which captured the majority of the WNV
transmission period [21].
Mosquitoes were sexed and the females were pooled
according to genus and species; that is, one pool consisted of a single species. The pools were then homogenized and submitted to the Louisiana Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory (LADDL) at the Louisiana State
University (LSU) School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM).

LADDL is the state testing facility for mosquito pools for

Virus Detection and Sequencing

Pools were obtained from the LADDL at the LSU SVM.
Viral RNA was extracted from 140 Î¼l of the supernatant
from the mosquito pool homogenate using the QIAmp
Viral RNA Extraction Kit following manufacturer's
instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). One microliter of
the extracted viral RNA suspension was used as template
for the reverse-trascriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) using Superscriptâ¢ III RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) with the previously described protocol
[22]. Upon confirmation of the presence of amplified viral
DNA by gel electrophoresis, the remaining sample was
cleaned using Qiagen PCR Cleanup kit following manufacturer's instructions. Cleaned DNA was then sent to the
Gene Probes and Expression Systems Laboratories of the
Division of Biotechnology and Molecular Medicine at the
Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine
for sequencing. Sequencing was performed on a Beckman Coulter 8800 (Pasadena, CA) using the manufacturer's reagents and methods.

used for all tests; a stepwise selection process was
invoked to cull out non-significant effects from the
model. PROC GLIMMIX with a binary distribution specified was used to construct the model and obtain the odds
ratios, as well as to obtain differences in least squares
means for the effects of parish and month. PROC GLIMMIX is a useful alternative to PROC LOGISTIC when
wanting to obtain differences in least squares and/or
modeling random effects, which is not easily done in
PROC LOGISTIC. Predicted means and odds ratios are
the same between the two procedures. Confidence intervals and tests for significance will vary when random
effects are included the model in PROC GLIMMIX, but
there were no random effects modelled here [23].
Phylogenetic Analysis

The complete envelope (E) and non-structural protein 3
(NS3) genes were aligned separately for all successfully
recovered isolates as well as 24 reference strains, which
represented the Israel 1998 strain and isolates spanning
the contiguous United States and one Mexican isolate
[15]. Alignments and the creation of the E-NS3 contigs
were done using Vector NTI software and exported to
GeneDoc for trimming. Alignments were imported into
MEGA 4 and converted to MEGA format. Bootstrap
analysis (n = 1000) using maximum parsimony was performed and a tree produced. As the topologies of the E
and NS3 phylogenies were the same, our tree represents a
contiguous sequence of these two genes. The topology
tree was collapsed with a node confidence of 70%.
Genetic distances and means were also obtained using
Mega 4 [24]. Not all samples in the statistical model were
available for the phylogenetic analysis.
