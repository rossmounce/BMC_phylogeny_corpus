Coreceptor use in nonhuman primate models
of HIV infection
Silvana Tasca Sina, Wuze Ren, Cecilia Cheng-Mayer*

Abstract
SIV or SHIV infection of nonhuman primates (NHP) has been used to investigate the impact of coreceptor usage
on the composition and dynamics of the CD4+ T cell compartment, mechanisms of disease induction and development of clinical syndrome. As the entire course of infection can be followed, with frequent access to tissue
compartments, infection of rhesus macaques with CCR5-tropic SHIVs further allows for study of HIV-1 coreceptor
switch after intravenous and mucosal inoculation, with longitudinal and systemic analysis to determine the timing,
anatomical sites and cause for the change in envelope glycoprotein and coreceptor preference. Here, we review
our current understanding of coreceptor use in NHPs and their impact on the pathobiological characteristics of the
infection, and discuss recent advances in NHP studies to uncover the underlying selective pressures for the change
in coreceptor preference in vivo.
Introduction
Animal models have always been considered powerful
tools for studying the modality of transmission and
pathogenesis of human diseases, and for testing the
efficacy of novel drugs and vaccines. They afford opportunities to closely monitor the natural course of the disease, with frequent sampling of blood and tissue
compartments that are not easily amenable or accessible
in humans. Besides their use in elucidating the
pathogenic mechanisms of disease, appropriate animal
challenge models play key roles in basic vaccine discovery, potentially providing valuable information on the
immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccine concepts, and
advancing candidate vaccines into human clinical trials.
The challenge in establishing animal models for
HIV-1, however, is that the virus does not replicate in
most animal species tested [1]. The exceptions are
chimpanzee and gibbon apes [2,3], but experimental
HIV-1 infection of chimpanzees is typically non-pathogenic, with only rare animals developing AIDS-like
symptoms after prolonged incubation period [4-6].
Furthermore, these apes are endangered and costly to
maintain, limiting their use for research purpose [7].
The AIDS pandemic originally arose as a consequence

viruses (SIVs) from African non-human primate (NHP)
species to humans [8]. Phylogenetic analyses indicated
that HIV-1 and HIV-2 emerged following transmissions of SIVcpz from chimpanzee and SIVsmm from
sooty mangabeys (SM), respectively [9,10]. The similarities between SIV and HIV with respect to genomic
structure and biological features renders infection of
various macaque species with SIVs, or with chimeric
viruses containing both SIV and HIV sequences
(SHIVs), the most relevant animal models to study
HIV-1 infection and AIDS.

SIV infection of African and Asian monkeys and
coreceptor usage
Over 40 distinct SIVs are found naturally in African
NHPs [11]. Infection of natural hosts such as SMs,
African green monkeys (AGMs) and mandrillis with SIVs
is typically nonpathogenic despite sustained high levels of
virus replication [12-15]. Development of AIDS has only
been observed in one SM and in one mandrill, after
18-year-incubation, a period exceeding the normal lifespan of wild primates [16,17]. SIVcpz, the precursor for
HIV-1, however, is pathogenic in free-ranging chimpanzees. Infected chimps in the wild were 10-16 times more
likely to die in any year than those who remained
uninfected [18], challenging the prevailing notion that all
natural SIV infections are non-pathogenic. In contrast to
most natural infections, accidental or experimental

transmission of SIVs from SMs to Asian non-natural
NHP hosts such as rhesus macaques resulted in progressive infection and AIDS-like symptoms, giving rise to
SIVmac [19]. Indeed, Indian rhesus macaques (IndRMs;
Macaca mulatta) infected with SIVmac and chimeras
encoding the HIV-1 envelope or reverse transcriptase are
the best characterized and most widely used animal models of AIDS [20]. Although the tempo of virus replication
and disease progression in SIV infected IndRMs is significantly accelerated compared to human HIV infection, the
pathobiology and clinical symptoms of SIV and HIV
infection are remarkably similar [21]. Considerable efforts
have been made to understand the similarities and differences between pathogenic and non-progressive SIV
infections, with the hope of uncovering new host
defenses that will guide conventional AIDS vaccine development. But with a decrease in availability of IndRM,
alternative models of pathogenic infection, such as Chinese RMs, cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis),
and pigtailed macaques (PTMs, Macaca nemestrina) are
also being developed [20,22]. While SIVmac and SHIV
infection in Chinese RMs and cynomolgus macaques
appear to be more attenuated [23], PTMs are more susceptible, with cases of AIDS reported after experimental
infection with SIVsmm, SIVagm, SIVlhoest from l’hoest
monkeys, and SIVsun from sun-tailed monkeys [24-26].
The absence of the TRIM5a restriction factor that blocks
infection by inactivating incoming capsids in PTMs
explains the higher susceptibility of these NHPs to different SIVs [27-30].
Similar to HIV-1, most SIV strains use CCR5 as their
primary coreceptor [31-33], despite a paucity of CD4
+CCR5+ T cells in the natural hosts [34]. The notable
exception is the red capped mangabey. Due to a high
frequency of a 24 bp deletion in the CCR5 gene, SIVrcm
uses CCR2, a chemokine that is expressed at low levels
on CD4+ T cells but at higher levels on macrophages,
for entry [35]. Nonetheless, the coreceptor usage profile
of SIV is broader than that of HIV-1 in coreceptortransfected cell lines [36,37] and PBMCs [38]. Among
those reported to be used by SIV, some as efficiently as
CCR5, are chemokine receptors that include CCR3,
CCR4, CCR8, CXCR6/STRL33/Bonzo, various G-protein
coupled receptors (ChemR23, GPR1, GPR15/Bob,
RDC1, APJ), and the formyl peptide receptor FPRL1.
Whether these alternative coreceptor pathways play a
role in SIV infection and pathogenesis in vivo remains
to be fully elucidated, but two recent reports provide
some insights. In a study to examine the dynamics of in
vivo replication of the CCR2- and macrophage-tropic
SIVrcm in PTMs, expansion of coreceptor usage to
CCR4 was observed, and this was associated with selective depletion of memory CD4+ T cells [39]. More
recently, a novel 2 base pair deletion (Δ2) in the sooty

Page 2 of 9

mangabey CCR5 gene that resulted in a truncated CCR5
molecule has been identified. This mutant protein is not
expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV
entry in vitro [40]. But SIV prevalence was only moderately lower in homozygous CCR5Δ2 mutant animals
compared to heterozygous and wild type animals, and
plasma viral loads were moderately reduced (0.48 log10)
in CCR5Δ2 infected animals compared with wild type
animals, demonstrating that CCR5-independent entry
pathways are used by SIVsmm in naturally infected SMs.
In contrast to HIV-1, however, CXCR4 usage by SIVs
in models of nonpathogenic and pathogenic infection is
rarely observed. Only an isolate obtained from mandrills
(SIVmnd; [41]) and one from AGM (SIVagm.sab; [42])
were found to use this coreceptor in addition to CCR5
for entry, and expansion to CXCR4-use was documented in two studies of SIVsm/SIVmac infection. In examination of six SIV seropositive SMs with AIDS-defining
CD4+ T cell levels, variants with expanded coreceptor
usage that included CXCR4 and CCR8 were identified
in two mangabeys [43]. Emergence of the multitropic
(R5/X4/R8) variants coincided with severe CD4 decline
in the blood, lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid
tissue (GALT), but the infected mangabeys remained
clinically healthy for >8 years. Sequence comparison of
the multitropic SIVsmm variants to viruses isolated
prior to the change in coreceptor preference shows
amino acid substitutions and insertions in the V3 loop
that increase the overall net positive charge of this
envelope region. But genetic studies to demonstrate that
these changes in the V3 loop of SIVsmm are sufficient
to confer expansion to CXCR4 and CCR8 use are lacking. Expansion to CXCR4 usage has also been reported
in a SIVmac239 infected macaque [44,45]. Compared to
the inoculating virus, the lymph node derived variant
(SIVmac155T3) has a 10-fold reduction in CCR5 use
that is accompanied by acquisition of CXCR4 utilization.
Infection of RMs with SIVmac155T3 resulted in rapid
and profound circulating and lymph node CD4+ T cell
loss [46], similar to observations made in X4 SHIV
infected rhesus monkeys (see below). SIVmac155T3 harbors 22 amino acid differences in the envelope glycoprotein compared to the inoculating virus, SIVmac239,
including five substitutions and one insertion in the V3
loop [44], but the genetic determinant for expansion to
CXCR4 use of this virus remains to be determined.

Impact of coreceptor usage on SIV and SHIV
infection of Asian macaques
Because the differences in SIV and HIV-1 protein structures might limit the utility of the SIV/macaque model
to study the impact of genetic variations on disease outcome, SHIVs containing both SIV and HIV sequences
have been engineered. The use of SHIVs that express

Sina et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 9(Suppl 1):S7
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/9/S1/S7

the envelopes of diverse HIV-1 strains as inoculating
viruses increases the relevance of NHP models, as the
impact of HIV-1 envelope-determined properties such
as coreceptor usage on viral transmission, persistence
and pathogenesis can be assessed [47]. Furthermore,
pathogenic envelope SHIVs could facilitate direct clinical analysis of HIV-1 Env-based candidate vaccines.
Since most HIV-1 transmissions are initiated with R5
viruses, pathogenic and mucosally transmissible R5
SHIVs would be the preferred tools to assess and
advance these vaccine concepts. For these reasons, R5,
dual-tropic as well as X4 clade B [48-55], clade C
[56-60], clade A and clade E SHIVs [61,62] have been
constructed and assessed for cell and tissue tropism,
viral persistence, anti-viral immune responses and disease progression in NHPs. These SHIV constructs do
not readily induce disease in RMs. But through serial in
vivo passages and adaptation, several X4 [63,64], dualtropic [65,66], and R5 [54,67] subtype B envelope SHIVs
that induce AIDS have been generated. R5 subtype C
SHIVs that are highly replication-competent and mucosally-transmissible have also be obtained and are being
tested for pathogenicity [68]. Interestingly, while dualtropic SHIVs can use both CCR5 and CXCR4 efficiently
on coreceptor-transfected cell lines, they use almost
exclusively CXCR4 to enter and spread in cultured rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages [38,69,70].
The most extensively studied SHIVs thus far use the
CXCR4 coreceptor. X4 SHIVs can be transmitted intravenously (i.v.), as well as intrarectally (i.r.) or intravaginally (ivag) in RMs, demonstrating that there is no
intrinsic barrier to mucosal transmission and amplification of X4 viruses. The clinical course of X4 SHIV infection in NHPs, however, differs dramatically from that of
macaques infected with SIV and R5 SHIVs. Rapid and
severe depletion of CXCR4+ target T cells in the peripheral blood, thymus and secondary lymphoid tissues was
observed in X4 SHIV infected animals, with high sustained viremia and progression to disease in 12-30
weeks [63-65,71,72]. Similar to observations made in
RMs infected with X4 SIVmac155T3 [46], CXCR4+
naive CD4+ T cells that are enriched in secondary
lymph nodes were selectively depleted early in X4 SHIV
infected monkeys, with elimination of central memory
CD4+ T cells during post-acute infection [70,73].
Despite the severe and irreversible loss of CD4+ T cell
populations, plasma viral load remained high in the
inoculated rhesus monkeys, sustained by infected tissue
macrophages [74]. However, while HIV-1 macrophage
infection is generally associated with CCR5 use [75],
acquisition of macrophage tropism by X4 SHIV in latestage infected macaques is not accompanied by a change
in coreceptor usage [76]. In a study that followed the

Page 3 of 9

evolution of HIV-1 envelope over time in PT macaques
infected with X4 SHIVs [77], most isolates were also
found to maintain CXCR4 use. The exception was an
envelope protein obtained from the cerebral spinal fluid
of an infected macaque that developed severe CD4+ T
cell loss and AIDS. This brain-derived Env was found to
use CXCR4 very inefficiently, but was able to use
CCR2b, and to a lesser extent CCR3, STRL33 and APJ
to infect cells. Furthermore, this envelope protein did
not use CCR5, but mediate infection of macrophages.
Thus, even though CXCR4 is very rarely used by SIV, it
functions as an efficient receptor for SHIVs in
macaques.
In contrast to X4 SHIV, R5 SHIV infected IndRMs
experienced a variable but detectable plasma viremia,
with some developing a rapid progressor clinical course.
Furthermore, acute pathogenic R5 SHIV infection, similar to HIV or SIV infection [46,78-83], results in a more
gradual and moderate loss of CD4+ T cells in peripheral
blood and secondary lymphoid tissues, but dramatic
depletion of CD4+ effector memory T cells that reside
in extra-lymphoid immune effector sites such as the gut,
lung and genital tract [54,67,68]. Thus, differential target
cell selectivity of the two viruses [46,70], coupled with
the difference in tissue distribution of the CD4+ target
T cell subsets within the host [73,84,85], largely explains
the distinct pattern and sites of CD4+ T cell depletion
in RMs infected with X4 or R5 viruses. That this process
is inextricably linked to coreceptor usage was further
demonstrated in a study using isogenic SHIVs that differ
only in the gp120 V3 loop sequences and in coreceptor
preference [73]. Infection of RMs with pathogenic SIVs
and SHIVs of different coreceptor usage, therefore, recapitulates key features of HIV infection and pathogenesis
in humans: R5 SIV/SHIV infection induces a disease
course that is more similar to that which occurs during
most human infections with HIV-1, while X4 SIV/SHIV
infection reproduces the precipitous peripheral CD4+ T
cell decline observed in patients infected with X4 HIV-1
isolates or in late stage disease concomitant with the
emergence of X4 virus. Coreceptor directed targeting
results in dramatically different changes in the CD4 T
cell subset composition of X4 and R5 SIV/SHIV infected
animals, explaining the distinctive clinical courses
induced by each virus.

Coreceptor switch in R5 SHIV infected rapid
progressor macaques
In ~50% of HIV-1 subtype-B infected individuals, the
coreceptor usage of the virus changes from a preference
for CCR5 to a preference for CXCR4 over the course of
infection [86]. As noted above, expansion or switch to
CXCR4 use is rarely observed in SIV infection of RMs,
but several cases of tropism switch have been reported

Sina et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 9(Suppl 1):S7
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/9/S1/S7

in R5 SHIV infection. Coreceptor switching was documented during infection of RMs inoculated with R5
SHIVSF162P3N by the intravenous [87,88] and the intrarectal route [89]. The IV and mucosally infected macaques in which X4 virus evolved and emerged are rapid
progressors (RPs) that experienced high set-point viral
loads, undetectable or transient anti-viral antibody
response, and progression to AIDS within 3-6 months
post-infection. Viruses recovered from one of three RPs
inoculated with the CCR5-tropic SHIVAd8 lineage
viruses were also shown to acquire the capacity to use
CXCR4 [54]. Although rare, rapid disease progression
has also been reported in HIV-1 infected individuals
[90-93], many of whom were found to harbor X4 viruses
[94,95]. In contrast, while approximately 20% of SIVmac/SIVsm infected RMs become RPs, R5-to-X4 switching has not been documented in these rapid progressing
macaques [96,97]. As coreceptor usage by SIV is broader
than that for HIV-1, these findings lend further support
to the notion that the use of other seven-transmembrane receptor(s) besides CCR5 and CXCR4 may indeed
be relevant for SIV infection in vivo.
Consistent with findings in HIV-1 infected individuals
that acquire X4 viruses [98-100], sequence changes in
the V3 loop of envelope gp120 that increased the
net charge of this region determine the phenotypic
change from R5-to-X4 in R5 SHIV infected macaques
[54,87-89]. These include insertions of basic amino acids
upstream of the GPGR crown of the V3 loop, as well as
replacement of the serine residue at position 11 of the
V3 loop with positively charged amino acids, suggesting
that evolution pathways to acquisition of CXCR4 use
overlap in the two hosts. Similar envelope changes during disease progression in HIV-infected humans and
SHIV-infected macaques have previously been reported,
indicative of common selection pressures [101,102].
With regard to coreceptor switch, the observation that
the envelope V3 loop sequences required for tropism
switch in RP macaques are similar to those in infected
humans who usually have developed neutralizing antibodies is noteworthy, since it argues that humoral immunity may not be a main selection pressure for change in
coreceptor preference. Additionally, the V3 loop
sequence mutations that resulted in tropism switch in
R5 SHIV SF162P3N infected RP macaques differed from
those required to confer expanded CXCR4 use to the
parental SF162 envelope in tissue culture systems
[103-105], implying that the selective pressures for X4
virus evolution differed in vivo and in vitro. Because
both systems lack antiviral antibody response, this selection factor also cannot explain the difference in
sequence change required for adaption of the SF162
envelope to function with CXCR4 in vivo and in vitro.
Besides humoral immunity, changes in target cell

Page 4 of 9

populations during the course of infection has also been
proposed as playing a role in driving coreceptor switching [106,107]. Thus, it is conceivable that the need to
escape this selection pressure, while maintaining viral
fitness and efficient coreceptor usage on diverse tissue
cells of the monkey host, accounts for the difference
in sequence requirement for tropism switch in vivo and
in tissue culture systems. However, X4 virus emergence
in R5 SHIV infected RP macaque occurs at a time when
peripheral CD4+ T cell count is >200 per microliter
blood, suggesting that CD4+ target T cell limitation is
also not a main selection pressure for change in coreceptor preference. A lack of correlation between the
percentage of peripheral CCR5+CD4+ target T cells or
CCR5 genotype with development of CXCR4-using
viruses in HIV-1 infected individuals had also been
reported [108,109]. Further studies in this animal model
of coreceptor switch therefore may uncover novel selective pressures that lead to the evolution of CXCR4-using
HIV variants in some infected individuals.

Phenotypic characteristics of switch variants in R5
SHIV infected rhesus macaques
Similar to observations made in humans [110-112], the
evolutionary process in infected macaques transitions
through dual-tropic variants capable of using both coreceptors, albeit with reduced efficiency compared to the
inoculating R5 virus and the final X4 variant [113]. The
findings that SIVmac155T3 as well as the multitropic
R5/X4/R8 SIVsmm variants still function with the CCR5
coreceptor while expanding their coreceptor utilization
further illustrate the role of transitional intermediates in
the pathway to coreceptor switch in NHPs. Furthermore, more than one R5-to-X4 evolutionary pathways
were identified in some R5 SHIV infected RP macaques,
giving rise to distinct X4 and dual-tropic variants which
had a preference for CCR5 coreceptor (dual-R tropic) or
a preference for CXCR4 coreceptor (dual-X tropic)
[89,114]. Further characterization of these R5X4 intermediate viruses should provide a better understanding
of the costs and benefits associated with switch in vivo,
and properties of the transitional intermediates that
allow them to eventually outgrow and amplify.
Akin to HIV-1 infection in humans [115], the emerging dual-tropic and X4 viruses are highly susceptible to
antibody neutralization compared to the early or
co-existing R5 viruses, in particular to soluble CD4
(sCD4) and anti-V3 loop antibodies. In this regard, varying frequencies of X4 viruses have been reported
throughout the course of HIV-1 natural infection [116],
but their dominance is seen only towards the end stage
of disease. These findings, coupled with the observation
that dual-tropic and X4 virus evolution is observed in R5
SHIV infected RP macaques with undetectable antiviral

Sina et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 9(Suppl 1):S7
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/9/S1/S7

antibody responses, lend support to the notion that X4
emergence is the result, rather than the cause, of immune
failure [117-119]. Thus, while antiviral antibody response
may not be a main driving force for R5-to-X4 evolution,
it is a major obstacle to X4 emergence and expansion.
Interestingly, and consistent with reports for HIV-1
[120,121], V3 sequence changes that confer CXCR4
usage are also sufficient to determine increase sCD4 sensitivity of the virus [113], suggesting that the early steps
in the R5-to-X4 evolution process in the RP macaques
may require the same conformation changes that renders
the virus neutralization sensitive. Higher sensitivity of
viruses to neutralization with sCD4 and anti-V3 loop
antibodies implies greater exposure of the CD4 and
chemokine receptor binding sites that are usually sequestered away from the humoral immune response
[122-124], indicative of a more “open” and less constrained envelope conformation. As envelope structural
constraints have been suggested to limit the pathways
available for coreceptor switching [110,125,126], it is
tempting to speculate that an “open” and less constrained
envelope conformation would be more accommodating
for mutational changes that are required for tropism
switch, but which usually come with costs to the virus
because of fitness loss. Studies to monitor precisely the
events surrounding coreceptor switch in the R5 SHIV
infected RP macaques may provide insights into the
driving forces for the virus to undergo a conformation
change that exposes its receptor and coreceptor binding
sites.

Secondary lymphoid tissues are the sites of X4
virus evolution and emergence
Frequent samplings and tissue data are very limiting for
HIV-1 infection of humans, highlighting the usefulness
of the R5 SHIV monkey model in providing a detailed
picture of the dynamics and anatomic sites of viral tropism change. In this regard, frequent and extensive samplings of lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs in R5
SHIVSF162P3N infected RP macaques revealed different
tempo and tissue localization of the emerging dual-tropic and X4 variants [89,113]. X4 viruses are poorly
represented in the gut but are detectable in secondary
lymphoid tissues such as the axillary, Iliac, and inguinal
lymph nodes at the time of switch. This contrasts with
dual-tropic viruses, which were easier to detect and had
a much wider distribution, establishing infection in peripheral as well as mucosal lymphoid tissues. The greater
representation and presence of the dual-tropic viruses in
multiple tissue sites compared to the X4 virus indicated
dominance and generalized dissemination of the former
virus, and suggested that the dual-tropic switch event
took place earlier than the X4 switch. Moreover, analysis
of tissue samples collected at a time point that

Page 5 of 9

happened to capture a localized switch event in one
infected RP macaque showed emergence of X4 viruses
first in the inguinal lymph node [89]. Interestingly, in a
study that examined envelope evolution in DKO-huHSC mice infected with the CCR5-tropic isolate HIV1JRCSF, variants that could use CXCR4 in addition to
CCR5 emerged in one mouse, and V3 sequences indicative of CXCR4-use were compartmentalized in the
mesenteric lymph node [127]. As indicated above,
CXCR4+CD4+ naïve T cells that are preferential targets
for X4 viruses in acute infection are enriched in peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid tissues. Compartmentalization of these preferred targets for X4 viruses in
peripheral lymph nodes, therefore, contribute to the
regional evolution and selection of X4 viruses at these
sites. Evolution and localization of X4 viruses that are
neutralization sensitive in secondary lymphoid tissues
which are not frequently sampled, together with the fact
that immune selection against HIV appears to continue
until late in infection [118,128], could explain the observation of X4 emergence only in a subset of patients progressing to AIDS.

Concluding remarks
SIV and SHIV infection of RMs provide experimentally
attractive models to study the impact of coreceptor
usage on viral replication, CD4 T cell depletion and
disease. Recent development of a simian model of
coreceptor switching, based on the infection of rhesus
macaques with pathogenic R5 SHIV isolates, further
broadens the use of NHPs to study coreceptor switch
following intravenous and mucosal infection. The conditions, phenotypic characteristics as well as envelope V3
sequences required for coreceptor switch in R5 SHIV
infected macaques overlap with those reported in HIV-1
infected individuals, supporting the use of this model to
study the mechanistic basis and selective forces for
HIV-1 coreceptor switching in vivo. While this phenomenon has so far been documented only in a small number of R5 SHIV infected RPs who fail to mount or
sustain virus-specific antibody response, studies of these
animals are still important, for they allow examination
of the process of a generalized switch uncomplicated by
the selection pressure of antiviral immune responses. It
remains to be determined how broadly findings in the
SHIV-rhesus model of coreceptor switch relate to HIV
infection of humans. Moreover, although humoral
immune pressure may not be a main factor in driving
coreceptor switch in the RP macaques, its presence
could nevertheless shape or dictate the pathway of
R5-to-X4 evolution. Variations in host genetic factors
such as MHC, APOBEC and TRIM5 family of proteins
[129-131] could also play roles in restricting the mutational pathways to coreceptor switch in vivo. Thus, the

Sina et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 9(Suppl 1):S7

model could be improved by examining the process of
coreceptor switching in genetically-defined R5 SHIV
infected rhesus monkeys that have developed a neutralizing antibody response, to discern the impact of innate
and adaptive immune selection forces on the evolutionary pathways available for tropism switch.
