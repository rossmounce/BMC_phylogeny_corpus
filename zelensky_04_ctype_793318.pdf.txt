Abstract
Background: Members of the C-type lectin domain (CTLD) superfamily are metazoan proteins
functionally important in glycoprotein metabolism, mechanisms of multicellular integration and
immunity. Three genome-level studies on human, C. elegans and D. melanogaster reported
previously demonstrated almost complete divergence among invertebrate and mammalian families
of CTLD-containing proteins (CTLDcps).
Results: We have performed an analysis of CTLD family composition in Fugu rubripes using the
draft genome sequence. The results show that all but two groups of CTLDcps identified in
mammals are also found in fish, and that most of the groups have the same members as in mammals.
We failed to detect representatives for CTLD groups V (NK cell receptors) and VII (lithostathine),
while the DC-SIGN subgroup of group II is overrepresented in Fugu. Several new CTLD-containing
genes, highly conserved between Fugu and human, were discovered using the Fugu genome
sequence as a reference, including a CSPG family member and an SCP-domain-containing soluble
protein. A distinct group of soluble dual-CTLD proteins has been identified, which may be the first
reported CTLDcp group shared by invertebrates and vertebrates. We show that CTLDcpencoding genes are selectively duplicated in Fugu, in a manner that suggests an ancient large-scale
duplication event. We have verified 32 gene structures and predicted 63 new ones, and make our
annotations available through a distributed annotation system (DAS) server http://
anz.anu.edu.au:8080/Fugu_rubripes/ and their sequences as additional files with this paper.
Conclusions: The vertebrate CTLDcp family was essentially formed early in vertebrate evolution
and is completely different from the invertebrate families. Comparison of fish and mammalian
genomes revealed three groups of CTLDcps and several new members of the known groups, which
are highly conserved between fish and mammals, but were not identified in the study using only
mammalian genomes. Despite limitations of the draft sequence, the Fugu rubripes genome is a
powerful instrument for gene discovery and vertebrate evolutionary analysis. The composition of
the CTLDcp superfamily in fish and mammals suggests that large-scale duplication events played an
important role in the evolution of vertebrates.

Background
The superfamily of proteins containing the C-type (Cadependent) lectin-like domain (CTLD) is a large group of
extracellular proteins characterized by evolutionary flexibility and functional versatility [1,2]. Its members have
been extensively studied because of their involvement in
diverse physiological processes, and their ability to bind
selectively a wide variety of ligands. As the superfamily
name suggests, carbohydrates (in various contexts) are
primary ligands for CTLDs and this binding is Ca-dependent [3]. However, the fold has been shown to specifically
bind proteins [4], lipids [5] and inorganic compounds
including CaCO3 and ice [6-9]. In several cases, the
domain is multivalent and may bind both protein and
sugar [10-12].
Three studies using the whole-genome approach have
been published analyzing the distribution of the superfamily in C. elegans [13], D. melanogaster [14] and human
[15]. An early study [2] attempted to generalize findings
on vertebrate CTLD-containing proteins (CTLDcps), and
to classify them into groups. This classification included 7
groups and, although not sufficient to describe later
known CTLDcps even in mammals and other vertebrates,
has been widely used by CTLD researchers. The recent
work of Drickamer and Fadden [15] provided an updated
classification of human and mouse CTLDcps, based on a
comprehensive analysis of CTLDcps encoded by the
human genome; this comprises 14 groups. These wholegenome studies and genome annotation projects demonstrated the relative abundance of CTLDcps and importance of the domain.
Known fish C-type lectins
A number of fish CTLDcp sequences have been reported
separately in the literature and public sequence databases.
The best-studied and most distinct set are serum antifreeze
proteins (AFPs) from several cold-water-living species
[7,16,17]. These sequences consist mostly of just a CTLD,
and were classified as group VII members based on
domain architecture. A three-dimensional structure of the
sea raven antifreeze protein has been determined experimentally [18].

Apart from AFPs, several other soluble bony-fish CTLDcps
have been described: 5 isoforms of Salmo salar serum lectin (SSL) [19], three collectins from different Cyprinidae
carp family species [20], skin mucus protein AJL-2 [21]
and two C-type lectins (eCL-1 and eCL-2) from gills of
Japanese eel [22], two lectins from rainbow trout liver
[23], a carp lectin [24], goldfish lectin OL-1 (GI:
26000685, unpublished), and a liver lectin from Gillichthys mirabilis (long-jawed mudsucker), annotated as
"mannose receptor C" [25].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/51

Known membrane-bound CTLDcps from bony fishes
include a polycystic kidney disease protein 1 (PKD1)
orthologue from Fugu [26], a rainbow trout Kupffer cell
receptor homologue [27], and a set of putative killer cell
receptors (KLR) identified recently [28]. Although predicted coding sequences for CTLDcps from winter flounder (GI:28394504, unpublished) and medaka fish [29] do
not contain a recognizable transmembrane (TM) domain,
based on CTLD sequence and, in the case of the medaka
CTLDcp, domain structure, they should be assigned to
group II, as the absence of TM regions may be a result of
incomplete prediction.
The only known CTLDcp sequence from cartilaginous
fishes is a tetranectin homologue from reef shark cartilage
[30].
Fugu genome sequence
The Fugu rubripes genome, available since 2002 [31], is the
second vertebrate genome sequenced. It is 8 times smaller
than the human genome and is proving to be an effective
instrument in analyzing the human genome because of its
compactness, low content of repetitive elements and the
relatively large evolutionary distance between fish and
mammals, which is estimated to be about 430 Myr [32].

Currently three versions of the Fugu rubripes genome
assembly are publicly available. The second version of the
assembly (v.2), constructed from 4.1 million sequencing
reads (5.4 X sequence coverage), was reported in the original publication announcing the completion of the Fugu
rubripes genome sequencing [31]. The third version (v.3)
was released in August 2002, has slightly better coverage
(5.7X) and improved scaffold contiguity. Sequence data
for all three assembly versions can be downloaded from
the Joint Genome Institute web site [33]. The JGI site and
the EnsEMBL web site [34] are the two main portals to the
Fugu rubripes genome annotation. Although EnsEMBL and
JGI annotations and genome browsers are different, they
share the same gene and transcript structure predictions
created by the EnsEMBL pipeline.
Several analyses of the draft Fugu genome sequence targeting different protein families have been published
recently [35-39], which showed its usefulness for evolutionary and functional studies as well as gene discovery.
Here we present an analysis of the presence of the CTLD
superfamily in the draft assembly of the Fugu rubripes
genome.

Results
Comparison of assembly versions 2 and 3
At the time this study was started, annotation of the v.3
assembly was not yet published; hence, most of our analysis was done with v.2 of the assembly and later mapped

a All Fugu CTLDcps identified in this analysis are listed. Columns 3 and 4 contain stable identifiers for gene models in the v.2 and v.3 assembly
databases, respectively. Identifiers starting with ANUFRU and ANUFR2 belong to our predictions on the v.2 and v.3 assemblies, respectively, and
are underlined. EnsEMBL gene stable identifiers are given if the original predictions were used. Bolded members denote Fugu proteins matched with
novel human orthologues.

to the v.3 assembly. From our experience, there is no substantial difference between v.2 and v.3 assemblies in the
amount of sequence information and its quality, although
the v.3 assembly contains longer scaffolds due to more
extensive linkage. Despite very high similarity at the
sequence level, the v.3 assembly annotation contains no
history information that would provide links between
contigs, genes, and transcripts in the second and the third
versions of the assembly. None of the stable identifiers for
genes, transcripts or peptides from v.2 are present in v.3.
This information cannot be generated by usual procedures used in EnsEMBL (e.g. ID Mapping Application,
which is a part of EnsEMBL Java APIs) and has to be
obtained by sequence comparisons. This lack of correspondence creates difficulties for the sequence analyzer
and end point reader. To facilitate analysis and allow
comparison, references to feature identifiers for both of
the assemblies are given in Table 1.
Protein database searches
Due to almost complete lack of cDNA or EST sequences
for Fugu rubripes, most of the EnsEMBL gene structure predictions are based on homology with known protein
sequences from other organisms, mostly mammals. We
expected a significant fraction of CTLDcps to be conserved
between fish and human, and, therefore, to be predicted
correctly by EnsEMBL in the Fugu genome. So our first
approach to detecting Fugu CTLDcps was to search a
sequence database of predicted Fugu proteins with a hidden Markov model (HMM) for the CTLD. This search
returned 69 significant matches. Some of the identified
genes had a description assigned to them, apparently
derived from the description of the sequence they were
found to be homologous to. These descriptions, however,
could not be used as a reliable basis for assigning orthology and paralogy relationships. For example, a sequence,
which we later identified as an Endo180 orthologue
(SINFRUG00000058766 in v.2 assembly annotation) is
described as "80 KDA SECRETORY PHOSPHOLIPASE A2
RECEPTOR PRECURSOR PLA2", while another gene,
which we designated as an aggrecan orthologue
(SINFRUG00000069597 in v.2 annotation) was annotated as "ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY PROTEIN
(ALDP)". Therefore, we reviewed domain architecture and
sequence similarity matches for each of the sequences
found to verify phylogenetic relationships.
Homology detection
The results of Inparanoid [40] comparison (see Methods)
of all human to all Fugu CTLDcps were used to initially
cluster the set of Fugu proteins and detect approximate
orthology/paralogy links. Inparanoid has an important
advantage over phylogenetic tree reconstruction software,
as it does not require a multiple alignment of sequences
but creates a distance matrix of the local pairwise align-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/51

ments. This method assigned putative human orthologues to 25 Fugu proteins. Orthology relationships for
the other 44 sequences from the set were established by
individual analyses.
Revision of CTLDcp gene structure predictions
While analyzing phylogenetic relationships predicted by
Inparanoid, we discovered several systematic and sporadic mistakes in the EnsEMBL gene predictions. The most
widespread mistake was a failure to include exons encoding TM domains into gene structure prediction. Consequently, almost all EnsEMBL-predicted Fugu CTLDcps
were soluble proteins, whereas very few human CTLDcps
are. Simple comparison with the GenScan [41] features
overlapping the CTLD-encoding genes showed that
absence of TM domains is a result of coding sequence
(CDS) mis-prediction rather than a fundamental difference in Fugu CTLDcps. GenScan predictions, in turn,
could not be used as a basis for our analysis because they
sometimes contain regions that are absent from human or
mouse orthologues, and often merge neighboring genes.
Another general problem was observed with proteins that
had a previously unknown domain architecture (see
below). In such cases individual domains were split into
separate gene models.

In addition to these systematic problems, there were multiple sporadic ones. For example, our analysis of the Fugu
genome shows that, similarly to the human and mouse
genomes, the selectin cluster is well conserved and contains all three selectin genes in tandem (SELE, SELL,
SELP), located on scaffolds 1045 (32046â41921) and 166
(83937â93826) in the v.2 and v.3 Fugu genome annotations, respectively. However, the EnsEMBL annotation
contains a prediction of two overlapping genes (v.2:
SINFRUG00000085188 and SINFRUG00000085187; v.3:
SINFRUG00000123102 and SINFRUG00000123101),
one of which is located in the intron of the other (Figure
1).
To solve these problems, we had to manually revise the
predicted structure for all genes encoding proteins
detected by the protein-level searches, and correct them
using supporting evidence available in the EnsEMBL database, as well as additional evidence generated by us. The
latter included similarity features produced by genomewide GeneWise and BLAST searches with CTLD profiles
and sequences, transmembrane domain predictions, and
similarity matches to the complete sequence of supposed
human or mouse orthologues.
As the final stage of the CTLDcp identification process, we
performed a set of DNA-level comparisons to ensure that
the CTLD-containing loci that are not covered by
EnsEMBL-predicted genes, or for which transcript predic-

tions are wrong and, thus, not detectable by protein database searches, were not omitted from the analysis. This
"quality control" step led to identification of an additional set of 25 well conserved CTLDcps, which had both
new and known domain architectures, as well as additional individual CTLDs, which were merged with neighboring CTLDcp loci if appropriate.
Groups of Fugu CTLDcps
After all these searches, we had identified a set of 94 Fugu
rubripes loci encoding CTLDcps (Table 1), which in total

contain 173 individual CTLDs, including PTR/Link-type
CTLDs [42]. Fugu CTLDcps were named according to their
human orthologues, established on the basis of domain
composition and sequence similarities. Where more than
one homologue was present in Fugu, a name was produced by adding a suffix of the form "-FXX", where XX is
a sequential number of the paralogue, to the name of the
closest human homologue. Predicted CTLDcps that do
not have homologues among the known CTLDcps have
identifiers of the form ANZ000. A few of these novel genes
were orthologous to loci in other vertebrate genomes sup-

ported by expression data, but otherwise are un-characterized, and were assigned descriptive names (CBCP, Bimlec,
SEEC, CETM, NLSLH).

Fugu hyalectan genes is duplicated. One of the Fugu versican copies is split between two scaffolds in the v.2
assembly.

We have clustered Fugu CTLDcps using the classification
scheme for human CTLDcps based on domain composition; this comprises 14 groups [15]. Link/PTR-domaincontaining CTLDcps, apart from hyalectans, were placed
into a separate group. Among the Fugu CTLDcps that did
not have mammalian homologues we detected a distinct
group of soluble dual-CTLD sequences, which we have
called F1 (Figure 2). The remainder of the Fugu-specific
CTLDcps were assigned to the U (Unclassified) group.
Gene structure prediction for members of the U group is
the lowest in quality, due to lack of supporting evidence
apart from similarity to CTLD sequence profiles and GenScan predictions.

Group II
We found only one representative of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) family in Fugu (HML2), while in
human this family has 3 members encoded by a gene cluster on Ch 17 (ASGR1, ASGR2, HML2). The Fugu sequence
was identified as an HML2 orthologue by phylogenetic
analysis based on the alignment of CTLD sequences.
Another clearly identifiable member of group II is the
orthologue of scavenger cell receptor C-type lectin
(SRCL), which is duplicated in Fugu and is 50% identical
to the human SRCL. The rest of the group II Fugu CTLDcps
(DC-SIGN-F1 â DC-SIGN-F8, XLCMCL) do not have
clearly identifiable orthologues among known human
CTLDcps, although phylogenetic analyses based on CTLD
sequence alignment indicate that they are homologous to
members of the group II subgroup containing DC-SIGN,
Mincle and Dectin-2, which also appear as top hits in
BLAST searches. However, this subset of group II Fugu
sequences co-clusters in phylogenetic trees and is not
similar enough to any tetrapod sequence to establish
orthology. Four of the sequences (DC-SIGN-F2, DCSIGN-F3, DC-SIGN-F4, DC-SIGN-F5) are located in a
cluster on scaffold 75 in the v.3 assembly. Two members
of the subgroup (DC-SIGN-F1 and DC-SIGN-F6) have
unstable placements in phylogenetic trees, and may
appear on a branch containing human/mouse group V
sequences, if the latter are included in the alignment. This

All but two groups of human CTLDcps have detectable
representatives in the Fugu genome (Figure 3, Table 1). We
did not detect any orthologues for groups V (NK cell
receptors) and VII (lithostathine/Reg family). The member repertoire for most of the other groups is very well
conserved between Fugu and human. However, groups II
and III, which include some of the best-studied mammalian CTLDcps, have a significantly different member composition in Fugu. In summary:
Group I
All four members of the lectican group that are present in
human have orthologues in the Fugu genome. Each of the

Phylogenetic relationships between fish and human CTLDs
Phylogenetic relationships between fish and human CTLDs. A phylogenetic tree built on a ClustalW alignment of a
95% non-redundant collection of predicted Fugu CTLDs and known human and fish CTLDs. Link domains and group VI CTLDs
were excluded from the alignment. The tree was built by the neighbor-joining method with 100 bootstrap trials using the ClustalW program. PhyloDraw was used to draw the radial cladogram shown. Branches containing CTLDs from CTLDcps belonging to the same group are shaded; group numbers are marked. Lower case prefixes in the identifiers indicate taxonomic origin:
h â Homo sapiens, f â Fugu rubripes, zbrfs â Danio rerio (zebrafish), g â Gillichthys mirabilis, gldhs â Carassius auratus (goldfish), carp
â Cyprinus carpio (common carp), rsmlt â Osmerus mordax (rainbow smelt), slmn â Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon), wfldr â Pseudopleuronectes americanus (winter flounder), ahrng â Clupea harengus (Atlantic herring), servn â Hemitripterus americanus (sea
raven), jpeel â Anguilla japonica (Japanese eel), medak â Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka), c â Paralabidochromis chilotes (cichlid
fish).

association is, however, unstable and may be due to mistakes in CDS prediction or phylogeny reconstruction.
Alternatively, it is possible that these sequences are
homologous to the common predecessor of group V and
group II CTLDcps.
Group III
Although Fugu has two collectins, there are no orthologues for mannose binding proteins (MBPs) or pulmonary surfactant proteins (PSP), which are the best studied
members of the group in human. Both of the Fugu collectins (COLEC10, MGC3279) are well conserved compared with their human orthologues and co-cluster with
them in phylogenetic trees. No functional information is
available for the novel collectin MGC3279, which was discovered in a large-scale cDNA sequencing project and
maps to chromosome 2p25.3 in the v.31 NCBI assembly
of the human genome, but the exceptionally high level of
conservation between human and fish (~76% identity)
strongly suggests that it is functional and important in
both organisms. COLEC10 (collectin liver 1, CL-L1) was
originally reported as limited to birds and mammals [43]
based on the Zoo-blot analysis.
Group IV
As already mentioned, all three selectin genes found in
other vertebrates are present in Fugu and have the same
genome arrangement.
Group VI
We identified Fugu orthologues for all four human group
VI members: macrophage mannose receptor (MManR),
DEC-205 (CD205), phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R)
and Endo180. In addition, there are 5 sequences
(MManR-F1 â MManR-F5) showing high similarity to
members of the group, four of which do not contain the
minimal number of CTLDs (8) present in the known
group VI sequences (Figure 1). The fragments belong to at
least 3 group VI CTLDcps. Although the most parsimonious explanation of the presence of these fragments would
be that each of the genes encoding an eight-CTLD molecule (MManR, Endo180 and PLA2R) was copied in a chromosome or genome duplication event, phylogenetic
analysis indicates that all five sequences are paralogues of
the MManR gene, which, thus, appears to have been
duplicated several times.

There is one more potential group VI member in Fugu. A
GenScan-predicted DEC-205-FUSE gene, which was
assigned to the U group, encodes a large protein (~2000
residues) with multiple CTLDs clustered in two groups: 5
at the N terminus and 10 (7 in v.3 assembly) at the C terminus, with an LCCL domain [named after its presence in
Limulus factor C, cochlear protein Coch-5b2, and late gestation lung protein Lgl1; [44]] and a coagulation factor 5/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/51

8 C-terminal domain (discoidin domain, FA58C) lying in
the middle separating the two groups of CTLDs (see
Figure 2). EnsEMBL predictions in the DEC-205-FUSE
locus in both versions of the assembly contain a large (4
kb) intron in the region encoding LCCL, FA58C and 8
CTLDs at the center of the molecule. LCCL has been
observed in a combination with a CTLD in an invertebrate
protein [45], while FA58C has been found only in combination with LCCL, but not with a CTLD [46]. Although
there is no supporting cDNA or EST evidence for our predicted gene structure, the small intron sizes (e.g. LCCL is
separated by 135 bp from the downstream CTLD) and
well-conserved CTLDs, suggest that the prediction may be
correct if the corresponding region was correctly assembled. There is no orthologue for DEC-205-FUSE in the
human genome.
Groups VIII and IX
We have identified Fugu orthologues for all known
human members of groups VIII and IX. One member in
each of these groups is duplicated in Fugu (Layilin and
Tetranectin).
Group X
In addition to the PDK1 orthologue, which was identified
previously [26], there is at least one more putative group
X member, orthologous to a recently identified human
and mouse PKD1 homologue PKD1L2 [47]. It is interesting to note that the GenScan-predicted Fugu PKD1L2
sequence is very similar to the sequences of human and
mouse PKD1L2 cDNAs, even though the latter were
deposited in GenBank at the beginning of June 2003 â
after GenScan prediction. This example indicates that ab
initio GenScan predictions on the Fugu genome can be
very accurate.
Group XII
We found a single sequence resembling mammalian eosinophil major basic proteins (EMBPs) in Fugu (EMBPL).
Although the similarity between the mammalian and the
fish sequences is very low (~30% identity), several observations suggest that the Fugu EMBP-like sequence is an
orthologue of one of the two mammalian genes. First, the
overall domain architecture of the fish protein is similar to
that of the EMBPs. Although the fish CTLD has a neutral
pI (7.1), it is preceded by a 30-residue peptide with a predicted pI of 3.62, analogous to the longer acidic neck of
the mammalian EMBPs. In the existing classification [15],
the presence of the acidic neck is used as the defining feature of group XII distinguishing it from the other group of
single-CTLD soluble proteins (VII). Second, in the phylogenetic trees EMBPL usually appears on the same branch
as EMBPs (e.g. Figure 3), albeit with low bootstrap support. Third, the exon-intron structure of the CTLD region
is identical in fish and mammalian genes. Finally, the fish

Page 10 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:51

sequence has the same rare substitution in the fourth position of the WIGL motif as the EMBP sequences (discussed
in more detail below).
Group XIV
The thrombomodulin family is fully represented in Fugu,
with one gene duplicated (C1qRP). In addition, a novel
member of the family conserved between Fugu and mammals was identified, which we named CETM (for CTLD,
EGF, TransMembrane domain) (see Figure 2). Multiple
full-length cDNA and EST sequences from different tissues
found in nucleotide databases indicate that mammalian
CETM is ubiquitously expressed. The sequence of the
CETM CTLD contains a putative carbohydrate-binding
motif (EPN), which is normally associated with mannose
specificity.
Antifreeze-protein-like sequences
We identified two putative CTLDcp-encoding loci with
similarity to antifreeze proteins: AFPL-F1 and AFPL-F2
(antifreeze-protein-like), almost identical to each other
and positioned in tandem on scaffold 1930 in the v.2
assembly. In v.3 of the assembly, the AFPL-encoding
region was rearranged and one of the AFPL loci disappeared. The intron-exon structure of the CTLD-encoding
region is identical to the structure of the sea raven antifreeze protein gene [48] with three intron insertions
(upstream of C1, downstream of the WIGL motif, and
between C2 and C3 [49]), and very similar to the structure
of the Salmo salar serum lectins [19], where only the first
two splice sites are present. The Fugu AFPL gene expression is confirmed by an EST sequence BU806418, which
covers the whole predicted CDS.
Link domain containing CTLDcps
All link domain-containing proteins identified in mammals are represented in Fugu and often are highly conserved between fish and human (e.g. TSG-6, 72%;
Stabilin-1, 45% identity); we will consider them as a single group despite their different domain architectures. Predicted members of the CD44 family (CD44 and
lymphatic vessel endothelium-specific hyaluronan receptor (Lyve-1)), however, are much more divergent from
their human homologues, and it is not clear whether the
two loci found in Fugu are orthologues of the two human
genes or paralogues which arose by duplication of an
ancestral gene.

In a recently published comprehensive study of another
family of the Link group, the hyaluronan and proteoglycan binding link proteins (HAPLN), four homologues
were identified in vertebrates (mouse, human and partially zebrafish) each linked to one of the four lecticans
[50]. As all lecticans (i.e. group I) are duplicated in Fugu,
we were expecting to also find duplicate copies of all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/51

HAPLN members. However, orthologues of only three
HAPLNs were found (CRTL1, BRAL1, HAPLN3), two of
which are linked to hyalectans in the same way as in mammalian genomes (CRTL1 with Versican, BRAL1 with
Brevican). The state of the assemblies does not allow to
determine conclusively whether HAPLN3 is linked to
Aggrecan or not. Only two of the Fugu lectican gene duplications are accompanied by corresponding HAPLN genes:
Aggrecan-F1 is linked to HAPLN3-F1 and the CRTL1 paralogue is present downstream to Versican-F1 in two tandem copies (CRTL1-F1 and CRTL1-F2). In neither version
of the assembly could the HAPLN4 homologue be identified downstream to Neurocan or Neurocan-F1. Sequence
conservation levels within the HAPLN proteins compared
with their human orthologues is quite high (e.g. 76%
identity for CRTL1).
Fugu dual-CTLD CTLDcps
The members of this group are soluble proteins with two
or three CTLDs, which we initially characterized as fragments of putative macrophage mannose receptor paralogues. However, phylogenetic analysis showed that these
proteins constitute a separate group, with no mammalian
orthologues detectable in sequenced genome and protein
databases. The domain structure prediction is confirmed
by three zebrafish cDNAs (CAE17649, CAE17650,
CAE17651), which have the same domain organization,
although conservation between zebrafish and Fugu
sequences is only moderate (~30%). Another homologue
with the same domain structure and similarity to the F1
group members, which was returned as the top-scoring hit
by BLAST searches in the nrdb, is the SCARF2 protein
from a planarian Girardia tigrina [51]. A hypothetical
dual-CTLD protein from Drosophila (NP_609962), which
presumably corresponds to the single member of group B
in the Drosophila CTLDcp classification of Dodd and
Drickamer [14], was also detected as a F1 homologue by
BLAST.
Novel CTLDcps conserved between Fugu and mammals
Discovering novel superfamily members in existing database sequences is one of the most important and exciting
outcomes of a systematic computer-based study such as
this. We predicted putative Fugu orthologues for several
uncharacterized
mammalian
CTLDcps
(Bimlec,
MGC3279, KIAA0534, CETM, SEEC, CBCP, NLSLH) that
are well conserved between Fugu and mammals. Most of
the predictions were supported by mammalian cDNA
sequences from public databases, but for two of them
(NLSLH and CBCP) no full-length cDNA from any organism was found in DBs. The high level of genomic
sequence conservation over evolutionary time from fish
to human, as in the case of NLSLH, and the presence of
partial cDNA and EST sequences from rodents and
human, as in the case of CBCP, were strongly suggestive

Page 11 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:51

that the predictions are correct. The novel CTLDcps that
could be attributed to one of the 14 known groups have
been discussed in the preceding sections for the
corresponding groups; those that do not fit into the existing classification are described below.
A large (~2100 aa) proteoglycan (CBCP), containing a set
of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG) repeats
[52], which are homologous to the NG2 ectodomain [53],
a calcium-binding Calx-Î² domain [54] and a CTLD, is a
novel member of a protein family which had not been
reported previously to have members containing CTLDs;
examples of this family also include the human MCSP/
CSPG4 [55] and mouse FRAS1 [56] genes. The prediction
was supported by three overlapping but incomplete cDNA
sequences from human and mouse, high levels of conservation between human and Fugu (~50% identity), and the
compact structure of the predicted Fugu gene. CBCP has
been placed in a new CTLD group, XVII; its domain structure is shown in Figure 2. We have cloned a full-length
cDNA of mouse CBCP confirming the domain structure
predicted in this study (A.N. Zelensky, in preparation).
The CTLD of CBCP lacks Ca-binding residues, and its long
loop region is short, resembling that of the group V
CTLDs.
Another protein with a novel domain organization,
whose prediction is strongly supported by available
cDNAs, is SEEC (SCP, EGF, EGF, CTLD-containing protein) (see Figure 2), which is well conserved between
human and Fugu. Although not described in a publication, a full-length human SEEC cDNA (AK074773) was
sequenced in the NEDO high-throughput sequencing
project. The predicted Fugu SEEC is 63% identical to the
human sequence. The sperm-coating glycoprotein (SCP)
domain, which is present in a broad set of organisms from
yeast and plants to mammals, but whose function is
unknown [57], is rarely observed in combination with
other domains in proteins; in only one other known protein (from sea urchin) is it found together with an EGF
domain [58], and SEEC is the first example of a CTLD-SCP
combination. The potential Ca/carbohydrate-binding
motif (QPD) characteristic of galactose specificity is
present in the CTLD. SEEC has been placed in a new CTLD
group XVI.
A predicted protein named "novel L-selectin homologue"
(NLSLH) because its CTLD is most similar to selectin
CTLDs is duplicated in Fugu (NLSLH and NLSLH-F1) but
only moderately conserved (32% identity) between Fugu
and human. The putative human orthologue is located on
Ch1q25.1 about 18 Mb further from the centromere than
the selectin cluster and is supported only by EST
sequences (AA912157, AA889574), but not cDNAs. No
conserved domains except for the CTLD could be detected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/51

in the human and Fugu NLSLH loci so, if the predictions
are correct, NLSLH is a soluble single-CTLD-containing
protein. Carbohydrate-binding motifs are not present in
the NLSLH and NLSLH-F1 CTLDs.
Finally, a type I transmembrane protein Bimlec, whose
prediction is supported by a full-length human cDNA,
was placed in a new group XV.
Dating the CTLDcp duplications
We found 12 groups of unlinked Fugu-specific CTLDcp
paralogues (Table 1), and attempted to determine the
duplication dates using two approaches: (1) based on the
estimation of the number of synonymous nucleotide substitutions (Ks) in the coding sequences and (2) based on
the molecular clock hypothesis.

For all but two pairs of duplicated genes, Ks values estimated with four different methods (see Methods) were
between 1.5â2.5, which indicates a complete saturation
of the synonymous sites (Figure 4(A)). Ks values so high
cannot provide an accurate estimation of the duplication
age, but we can conclude with confidence that the
CTLDcp gene duplications are at least 150 Myr old, which
is the time required for complete saturation of silent sites
assuming a mutation rate of 2.5 substitutions/silent site/
billion years in fish [59]. If, however, Ks values presented
in Figure 4(A) and the silent mutation rate are close to correct, the corresponding duplication timeframe is predicted to be 300â500 Myr.
In order to date the duplications based on molecular clock
measurements, we aligned duplicated Fugu CTLD
sequences with their vertebrate orthologues present in
GenBank, and built linearized phylogenetic trees based
on the alignments. As human and mouse sequences were
invariably available, the divergence time between these
two species [96 Myr; 60] was used to calibrate the clock,
together with the divergence time between Actinopterygii
and Sarcopterygii [430 Myr; 32]. Symmetrical tree topology ((H, M) (F, F1)), expected for a Actinopterygian-specific duplication, was revealed by at least one phylogeny
reconstruction method we used for the following six
homologue groups (data not shown): brevican, neurocan,
MManR, SRCL, tetranectin and HAPLN3, with duplications dated 369, 284, 397, 377, 360 and 312 Myr, respectively. A typical tree with symmetrical topology is shown
for MManR in Figure 4(B). The other six alignments
(aggrecan, versican, layilin, attractin, C1qRP, CRTL1) produced trees with topologies suggesting a duplication predating the split between Actinopterygian and
Sarcopterygian. The portion of symmetrical topologies
(50%) in the CTLD set is similar to the ratio reported by
Taylor and coworkers in fish: 15 of 27 (55 %) [61], and 25

Discussion
Draft assembly limitations
A systematic study based on draft-quality whole-genome
data for an organism like Fugu rubripes has some limitations, as the genomic sequence is incomplete, fragmented
and sometimes misassembled, and the expressed
sequence information is scarce. On the other hand, many
of the genomes that are currently being sequenced will be
released and remain for sometime in the same state as the
Fugu genome data are now. Indeed, more than a year after
the initial release [31] very few improvements to the Fugu
genomic data [v.3 assembly and EST sequencing project;
[63]] have been published. Therefore, it is essential to
extract useful biological information from draft-quality
whole-genome sequences. Our study is such an attempt.

We have mentioned four limitations of the draft-state
assembly â incompleteness, fragmentation, misassembly
and lack of expression information. While the last might
appear the biggest problem, we found that ab initio predictions combined with manual curation and interspecies
comparison have proven to be very accurate (e.g. see
PKD1L example), thanks to the compactness of the Fugu
genome, smaller ratio between intron and intergenic
region sizes compared with mammalian genes, wealth of
data for comparative analysis etc. We do not expect that
sequencing the remaining 5% of the Fugu genome, which
is mostly heterochromatic regions, will lead to discovery
of many new CTLDcps. From the comparison of the Fugu
CTLDcp repertoire discovered by us and found in other
fish species independently, the only surprising omission
in our results is a MBP orthologue. MBP sequences have
been found in several other fish species. Their absence in
Fugu may represent a bona fide gene loss. As to the fragmentation, only a few of the CTLDcps are split between
scaffolds, namely versican and some MManR paralogues
(Figure 1). All of the fragmented genes are big, and in
most cases the fragments can be combined easily to reveal
the full sequence. Finally, misassembly signs were
observed in several CTLDcp loci while comparing two versions of the assembly. These showed as presence of
repeated regions in the v.2 assembly, which disappeared
in the v.3 assembly.
Two groups identified in higher vertebrates are not
detectable in Fugu
We could not detect CTLDcp representatives for groups V
(NK cell receptors) and VII (lithostathine) in the Fugu
genome. CTLDs in the members of these groups have lost
their carbohydrate-binding activities, and perform functions that have, apparently, evolved after evolutionary
separation of tetrapods from fish, or which are mediated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/51

by other proteins in fish. For example, group VII members
are secreted into the digestive tract â a system that is very
flexible evolutionally. Group V is probably one the
youngest and most rapidly evolving sets of CTLDcps; its
component members vary significantly even between
rodents and human, a phenomenon connected to the coevolution with the acquired immune system proteins that
group V CTLDcps interact with.
Our conclusion on the absence of group V CTLDcps in the
Fugu genome is at odds with the conclusions of two studies describing group V CTLDcp evolution in chordates. A
recent paper describes possible CD94 homologues (cichlid killer cell lectin receptor, cKLR) in bony fishes Paralabidochromis chilotes and Oreochromis niloticus, which are
encoded by a large multi-gene family with at least 10
members [28]. Another recent work described sequencing
of a CD94 homologue in a tunicate [64].
The decision by Sato et al. [28] to assign putative fish killer
cell receptors to group V rather than to group II was based
on several considerations, including gene structure,
absence of canonical Ca2+/carbohydrate-binding residues,
and phylogenetic analysis based on the CTLD alignment.
The latter consideration is mentioned as the most important one. However, as the authors themselves note, bootstrap values for placing cKLR on the group V branch, are
"low to moderate". Indeed, we found that in phylogenetic
trees built using different methods (maximum parsimony, distance estimation method with PAM matrix followed by neighbor-joining tree reconstruction, maximum
likelihood) from the ClustalW alignments of cKLR
sequences with group V and group II CTLD sequences
from Fugu, mouse and human, cKLR placement is unstable. As shown in Figure 5, on a tree built by the neighborjoining method we found cKLR on the branch containing
the Fugu-specific subset of group II CTLDcps (DC-SIGNF1 â DC-SIGN-F8), most of which do contain residues
required for Ca2+/carbohydrate binding. On a tree built by
the maximum parsimony method, we found cKLR on a
separate branch equally related to group II and group V
sequences (not shown). Also, a BLAST search with the
complete cKLR sequence (GI 31789959) in the nonredundant NCBI protein database returns members of the
ASGR subgroup of group II as top matches. Therefore, we
judge that sufficient support for assignment of cKLR to
group V is lacking and the question of the presence of the
NK-cell receptor family in fishes is still open.
As to the putative CD94 homologue from tunicates, it is
indeed more similar to CD94 than to any other CTLDcp.
However, the low level of sequence homology and the
lack of evidence for existence of group V CTLDcps in more
advanced taxa does not allow a confident statement that

the sequence from tunicates is a CD94 orthologue, rather
than a result of convergent evolution.

Expansion of the innate immunity CTLDcp groups in Fugu
Unlike pairwise unlinked duplications (see below), tandem duplications and other gene family expansions are
limited to two groups, namely the DC-SIGN subgroup of
group II and MManR. In mammals, members of these
subgroups play an important role in innate immune
responses. In particular, DC-SIGN is actively studied due
to its ability to bind and internalize a broad range of bacterial and viral pathogens, including HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (reviewed in [65]), while MManR is also
implicated in binding and phagocytosis of a wide range of
microorganisms [66]. Expansion of these groups, most
notably the DC-SIGN subgroup, in Fugu may reflect a
larger role for innate immunity in host defense in lower
vertebrates. Interestingly, multi-copy clusters comprising
at least 10 genes encoding close cKLR homologues were
identified in another cichlid fish species Oreochromis niloticus [28], which suggests another parallel between the
expanded DC-SIGN subgroup in puffer fish and cKLRs of
cichlids.

Relationships between fish, mouse and human group V and II

V and II CTLDs. Non-redundant set of CTLD sequences
from known human and mouse CTLDcps classified as groups
II and V, Fugu CTLDcps classified as group II, and putative
killer cell receptor from Paralabidochromis chilotes (cKLR)
were aligned with ClustalW. A consensus phylogenetic tree
was built from 100 bootstrap trials using the protdist (with
PAM distance matrix) and neighbor programs from the
PHYLIP package. Black triangle shows position of cKLR.
Bootstrap values higher than 40 are indicated.

There are no extra members, however, in the Fugu collectin group â another CTLD group directly involved in
innate immunity in mammals. Moreover, the mannose
binding protein (MBP), which is the best-studied mammalian collectin involved in lectin complement activation
pathway, was not detected by us. The absence of MBP
orthologues in Fugu is rather puzzling, as MBP sequences
have been found in several other fish species (Danio rerio,
Cyprinus carpio and Carassus auratus; [20]), and are well
conserved within the Cyprinidae carp family. The collectin
family is also present and expanded in the Urochordate
Ciona intestinalis with nine collectin genes identified in the
draft genome sequence [67], although it is not clear
whether one of these nine genes is an MBP orthologue.
Given the role of MBPs in complement activation in
mammals, and their presence and level of conservation in
the carp family, it is possible that the Fugu MBP orthologue does exist but is not covered by the draft genome
sequence. Complement-activating C-type lectins from
lower organisms have been identified but not completely
sequenced [68]; they have multiple CTLDs as in CPL-III
from the protochordate Clavelina picta [69] or lack the collagen domain and show more similarity to other CTLDcps
such as the glucose-binding lectin (GBL) from another
tunicate, Halocynthia roretzi [70].
Fugu dual CTLD molecules â a missing link between
vertebrate and invertebrate CTLDs?
Previous whole-genome studies of the CTLD superfamily
in two invertebrates [13,14] failed to identify any groups
of CTLDcps common to both invertebrates and

Page 15 of 22

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:51

vertebrates. A group of predicted dual CTLD-containing
proteins in Fugu (F1) may be the first vertebrate group that
has detectable homologues in invertebrates. Alternatively,
it is possible that none of the Fugu F1 group members are
in fact orthologous to the invertebrate sequences, as
sequence similarities are only moderate (~30% ID) and
the domain architecture is simple and could have evolved
independently in different lineages. However, several
observations suggest that at least F1 members from Fugu
and zebrafish and SCARF proteins from Girardia tigrina
evolved from the same predecessor. First, similarity levels
between fish sequences and between fish and planarian
sequences are about the same. It is unlikely that the fish
sequences are unrelated, which implies that F1 members
are evolving quickly, and only major structural features of
these molecules are under selective pressure [49]. Second,
the CTLDs of planarian and, in all cases at least one CTLD
of the fish dual-CTLDcps, contain residues characteristic
of Ca/carbohydrate binding. In vertebrates, ability to bind
carbohydrates is associated with the oldest CTLDcps
groups, and is considered to be an ancestral feature of the
CTLD. Indeed, both vertebrate CTLDcp groups that we
failed to find in Fugu (V and VII) have lost sugar-binding
properties. This is also the case for the antifreeze proteins
from fish and snake venom CTLDcps, which have only
been found in the corresponding clades. Third, similar
domain organization (two CTLDs, no transmembrane
domain) is also observed in two other known groups of
invertebrate CTLDcps: immulectins from various insect
species [71,72] and nine proteins from C. elegans, classified as group D1 by Drickamer and Dodd [13]. Despite
identical domain structure, none of these proteins shows
statistically significant homology to the fish F1 group
members or their putative homologues from planarian or
Drosophila. Altogether, this indicates that domain structure alone cannot establish an evolutionary link between
the fish and invertebrate sequences. Hence, the suggestive
link between the F1 group fish members and the planarian and Drosophila proteins is even more interesting.
CTLDcp classification update
The existing classification of CTLDcps is generally
accepted and popularly used in studies of the superfamily
and recently has been updated [15]. The classification
divides CTLDcps into monophyletic groups of proteins
with identical overall domain architecture based on a
combination of structural and phylogenetic information.
Although two previous large-scale studies [13,14] showed
it to be inapplicable for description of invertebrate CTLDcps, our analysis of the puffer fish genome indicates that
it is sufficient to describe the superfamily in all vertebrates, with only minor modifications and some
extensions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/51

Our newly discovered CTLDcps, with a few exceptions, do
not fit into the existing classification because of their
unique domain architecture. We propose several new
groups to accommodate the novel CTLDcps which have
been found in both higher and lower vertebrates and are
supported by cDNA sequences:
â¢ XV â Bimlec (type I transmembrane protein), which in
phylogenetic trees is not placed on the same branch as
group VIII sequences, has a distinct exon-intron structure
of the CTLD region and a neck not similar to the neck
region of the group VIII sequences;
â¢ XVI â SEEC, based on unique domain architecture;
â¢ XVII â CBCP, based on unique domain architecture;
Additional groups may be required for the sequences not
supported by sufficient expression data (NLSLH) and
other sequences from the "unclassified" group whose
presence in higher vertebrates is not clear. Also, clade-specific groups, such as fish antifreeze proteins (AFP), dualCTLD sequences (group F1) predicted by us and so far
identified only in fish, or snake venom CTLDcps which
lack orthologues in other vertebrates, are required.
It has been suggested previously [19,48] that AFPs belong
to group VII based on their domain architecture and exonintron structure. However, our phylogenetic analysis of an
alignment of CTLD sequences from all known human and
mouse CTLDcps and 26 different fish CTLD-containing
protein sequences identified by searching the NCBI protein database with BLAST, indicates that they constitute a
phylogenetically distinct group including all known soluble fish CTLD-containing proteins, except Cyprinidae collectins. As to the exon-intron structure, introns in the
group XII (EMBP) CTLDs are at exactly the same positions
as in group VII and AFP-like CTLDs, which suggests that
all three groups are closely related but does not allow classification of the fish AFP-like sequences to either of the
mammalian groups. Interestingly, just like most of the
AFPs, mammalian EMBPs contain an atypical WIGL motif
with a glycine in the fourth position, a substitution not
observed in any other mammalian CTLD we analyzed.
Taken together, these observations indicate that in a
broader evolutionary perspective the differences between
some of the groups including CTLDcps with a very similar
domain architecture (VII, XII and AFP; II and V) become
less distinct, which makes classification of the "intermediate" or "ancestral" sequences, equally related to more than
one group, problematic.

Selective duplication of the Fugu CTLDcp-encoding genes
and the whole-genome duplication hypothesis
The hypothesis that whole-genome duplications were one
of the main driving forces in vertebrate evolution, providing genetic material for increased diversity and progressive
development [73], and that there were two rounds of
whole-genome duplication in vertebrate phylogeny (the
2R hypothesis) [73,74], is actively debated [75,76]. A
more recent whole-genome duplication is suggested for
the Actinopterygian branch [61]. Ray-finned fish are the
most diverse group of vertebrates, and based on the initial
observation that each of the four human HOX gene clusters has two homologues in zebrafish [77] it was suggested
that they have undergone an additional round of a wholegenome duplication after the divergence from Sarcopterygian about 430 Myr ago [61]. Analysis of the genome
duplication in fish can give a picture of a duplicated
genome after 300â400 Myr of evolution and fill the gap
between the now generally accepted recent tetraploidizations in plants [78] and yeast [79] and the alleged more
ancient duplication(s) of the ancestral vertebrate genome.

Although many fish genes are indeed duplicated
[61,77,80-82], it is not clear whether the copies were created by a complete genome duplication (autopolyploidy),
merge of different genomes (allopolyploidy), regional
duplication, or simply a series of tandem duplications.
Attempts to show that ancient tetraploidization (has not)
occurred usually involve: (i) searching for an excess of paralogue groups where the number of members is double
the number of alleged duplications (i.e. 2 in case of Actinopterygian duplication, and 4 in case of vertebrate duplication, the "one to four rule") [74,76]; (ii) showing that a
statistically significant number of duplications took place
at approximately the same time by molecular clock estimation or synonymous substitution counting [83,84];
(iii) using phylogenetic methods to assess the relation
between duplication and speciation events [61]; and (iv)
showing that duplicated genes are arranged in paralogous
blocks on chromosomes (paralogons) [62,85,86]. We
used these approaches to analyze the nature of the
observed CTLDcp duplications in Fugu.
Our results clearly show that tandem gene copying is a
mechanism of CTLD family evolution and led to generation of three gene clusters: DC-SIGN-F2 â DC-SIGN-F5 (4
genes), CRTL1-F1 and CRTL1-F2, and AFPL-F1 and AFPLF2. Members of the two latter clusters are nearly identical
and may be an assembly artifact. Twelve other duplicated
genes are not linked in the current assembly and have
sequences much more diverged than tandem duplicates.
Of the 12 genes only MManR, which has 3 paralogues, is
present in more than two copies. We consider this is
important evidence in favor of a whole-genome duplication, as sporadic duplications cannot explain such a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/51

strong bias towards two-member paralogue groups.
Unfortunately, the results of duplication time estimations
are less conclusive as they give only a broad timeframe for
the possible duplication events of about 300â400 Myr. As
in the case of some other fish gene families reported previously [61,62,87,88], molecular phylogeny reconstruction performed by us often indicates that duplications
occurred before the divergence between fish and tetrapods. However, this could be an artifact of the method
caused by different selection pressures on duplicates.
Unfortunately, there is practically no overlap between vertebrate and invertebrate CTLD families, so we could not
use invertebrate sequences to refine phylogenetic analysis.
To conclude: phylogenetic relationships between CTLD
paralogues and estimated duplication time distribution
indicate that there was a burst in duplication activity in
the Fugu genome 300â400 Myr ago. While we cannot
determine definitively the nature of the duplications (tandem, regional or whole-genome), a pronounced bias in
the number of two-member paralogue groups strongly
suggests that there was a single large-scale or wholegenome duplication event in fish.
Another interesting observation is that CTLDcp genes
were either duplicated, or retained after a large-scale
duplication, in a pronounced selective manner. One
group (I) is duplicated completely, while in other groups
only partial duplications are found. Interestingly, group I
(lecticans), which in tetrapods contain four large (>2000
amino acids) proteins, very similar to each other in
sequence and domain structure, is a good candidate for
demonstrating the 2 R hypothesis. If the four lecticans
arose as a result of the alleged two rounds of the wholegenome duplication early in vertebrate history, the fact
that the family was also completely duplicated in fish and
retained after the duplication appears very non-random
and implies some functional explanation. In the human
genome, all four genes encoding lecticans are located on
different chromosomes (1, 5, 15 and 19), but it is not
clear whether they are linked in Fugu.
Another group that conforms to the 2 R hypothesis is
group VI, which in tetrapods has four members with
almost identical domain structure in mammals (Pla2R,
MManR, DEC-205 and Endo180). Though in the Fugu
genome we identified 7 group VI sequences, some of
which are fragmented (Figure 1), phylogenetic analysis
shows that only one member of the family (MManR) was
quadruplicated, while others are present in a single copy.
Both molecular clock and Ks-based methods date the
MManR duplications at approximately the same time as
other CTLDcp gene duplications. Phylogenetic trees, built
on alignment of the overlapping portions (Figure 1) of the
complete sequences and three largest fragments
(fMManR-F1, fMManR-F2, fMManR-F3) have symmetri-

cal structure, with fMManR-F1, fMManR-F2 and fMManRF3 forming a separate branch (Figure 4(B)). A wholegenome duplication, generating fMManR and fMManRF1, followed by tandem duplications of fMManR-F1, producing fMManR-F2 and fMManR-F3, can explain this
topology.

Conclusions
We have performed an analysis of the CTLD superfamily
composition in Fugu rubripes. Although the sequence
assembly is in the draft state and lacks physical mapping
information and native cDNA sequences that could be
used to make and verify gene predictions, the quality of
the data is good enough despite these limitations to
answer many important questions. Our study demonstrates that all but two groups of CTLDcps present in
mammals are also found in fish, that most of the groups
have the same composition as in mammals, and that the
missing groups are the evolutionarily most dynamic ones
involved in physiological processes that may be specific to
higher vertebrates. We also identified at least one distinct
fish-specific CTLD group, which could be the first known
vertebrate CTLD group also found in invertebrates.
The compactness of the Fugu genome makes it an
extremely convenient reference sequence for identification of new genes based on supporting similarity features,
and we were able to identify and predict the structure of
several new CTLD-containing genes highly conserved
between Fugu and human. The new sequences are supported by cDNA and EST sequences from databases and
have previously unknown domain architectures. We are
now characterizing some of these sequences experimentally. We also show that CTLDcp-encoding genes are selectively duplicated in Fugu, in a manner that suggests an
ancient large-scale duplication event in fish.

We used a multi-step approach to find genes encoding
CTLDs. First, a hidden Markov model (HMM) profile of
the CTLD was used to scan a FASTA database of EnsEMBLpredicted genes with the hmmsearch program from the
HMMER package [96]. To detect orthologues and paralogues, the set of Fugu sequences found was compared
with the 95% non-redundant set of sequences of human
CTLDcps that could be found in the Entrez proteins database, using the Inparanoid program [40]. All of the 25
orthology links detected by Inparanoid were checked
manually.
Because of systematic and sporadic errors in EnsEMBL
gene predictions, we had to manually revise the structure
of each of the 69 genes encoding proteins detected by the
HMM-based search. This was done using the Apollo
genome annotation software [97] connected to a local
installation of the EnsEMBL database. To facilitate annotation, several additional feature tracks were added to the
EnsEMBL database:
a) Similarity features detected by GeneWise [98] search of
Fugu scaffold sequences with a CTLD HMM built in a global alignment mode. This was done to detect well conserved CTLDs while avoiding many false positives.
b) Same as a), but with an HMM built in the local alignment mode; this was done to detect highly conserved fragmented CTLDs;

Methods
Corrected gene predictions are made available as a distributed annotation system (DAS) [89] resource [90], which
can be viewed in the EnsEMBL genome browser. The data
source names for predictions based on assemblies v.2 and
v.3 are fugu_ctld_1 and fugu_ctld_2, respectively.
Transcript sequences (in FASTA format) for the CTLDcpencoding genes created or modified by us (stable IDs starting with ANU) and their translations are also provided in
the additional file 1 and additional file 2, respectively.
Searches and gene annotations were done on version 2 of
the Fugu rubripes genome assembly [31] downloaded from
the EnsEMBL web site [91,92]. When the third version of
the assembly was released, we mapped gene annotations
onto it. Mapping was done on the basis of SSAHA [93]
matches in the v.3 assembly for exons predicted on the v.2
assembly. The v.2 assembly is currently accessible at the

c) Similarity features detected by a TBLASTN search of
Fugu scaffold sequences using all known human CTLD
sequences; this was done to detect CTLDs that are less
conserved;
d) ORFs encoding putative transmembrane (TM)
domains. To create this track a database of all possible
ORFs longer than 45 bp was produced and translated into
protein sequence using the EMBOSS programs. This was
then scanned with the TMHMM program [99] to detect
ORFs that encode putative TM domains.
To verify whether there are CTLDs that were not covered
by EnsEMBL gene predictions, we searched for all significant CTLD similarity features detected by GeneWise
which do not overlap with any of the genes analyzed in
the first stage. This step led to detection of 25 new CTLD-

coding genes, including most of the ones that have previously uncharacterized domain organization. At the next
stage we analyzed the loci with different CTLD similarity
features detected by genewisedb search with a local alignment HMM. Finally, the features identified by BLAST and
not overlapping with already detected genes were analyzed. This set of features mostly contained only partial
CTLD matches.

We translated both the new and already predicted gene
CDSs into protein sequences and performed another
Inparanoid comparison. Phylogenetic relationships were
analyzed with the programs from the Phylip package
[100]. ClustalW [101] guiding trees were used for quick
phylogeny estimation and in cases where a proper multiple alignment could not be made.

automate all stages of the analysis. Domain architectures
were analyzed with the SMART web service [103].

PKD1, polycystic kidney disease protein 1;
SEEC, SCP, EGF, EGF, CTLD;

To estimate the proportion of substitutions in synonymous sites, we aligned translated sequences of the duplicated CTLDcp-encoding genes with ClustalW, using either
whole sequence or sequence for the CTLD-encoding
region only, and built nucleotide sequence alignments
based on the protein alignments. Ks estimations were performed with four methods: Lynch and Connery [104] and
Li [105], both implemented in the ntdiffs package [104];
and Nei and Gojobori [106] and Yang and Nielsen [107],
both implemented in the yn00 program from the PAML
package.
Duplication dating using the calibrated molecular clock
approach was performed as in [83]. Alignments of CTLDcontaining regions of Fugu paralogues and their mammalian orthologues were made with ClustalW. The MEGA2
program [108] was used to build linearized trees from
Poisson-corrected distances, p-distances and Gamma-corrected distances by the neighbor-joining method with
1000 bootstrap samplings. The global clock was calibrated using divergence times 96 Myr and 430 Myr for
human-mouse and fish-mammal splits, respectively
[32,60,83].
