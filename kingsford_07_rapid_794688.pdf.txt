Background: In many prokaryotes, transcription of DNA to RNA is terminated by a thymine-rich
stretch of DNA following a hairpin loop. Detecting such Rho-independent transcription
terminators can shed light on the organization of bacterial genomes and can improve genome
annotation. Previous computational methods to predict Rho-independent terminators have been
slow or limited in the organisms they consider.

Rho-independent (also known as intrinsic) terminators are
sequence motifs found in many prokaryotes that cause the
transcription of DNA to RNA to stop. These termination sig-

nals typically consist of a short, often GC-rich hairpin followed by a sequence enriched in thymine residues [1]. The
importance of Rho-independent termination varies across
bacteria. In some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, a large

Results: We describe TransTermHP, a new computational method to rapidly and accurately
detect Rho-independent transcription terminators. We predict the locations of terminators in 343
prokaryotic genomes, representing the largest collection of predictions available. In Bacillus subtilis,
we can detect 93% of known terminators with a false positive rate of just 6%, comparable to the
best-known methods. Outside the Firmicutes division, we find that Rho-independent termination
plays a large role in the Neisseria and Vibrio genera, the Pasteurellaceae (including the Haemophilus
genus) and several other species. In Neisseria and Pasteurellaceae, terminator hairpins are
frequently formed by closely spaced, complementary instances of exogenous DNA uptake signal
sequences. We quantify the propensity for terminators to include these sequences. In the process,
we provide the first discussion of potential uptake signals in Haemophilus ducreyi and Mannheimia
succiniciproducens, and we discuss the preference for a particular configuration of uptake signal
sequences within terminators.

fraction of termination is mediated by the Rho protein or its
homologs (reviewed in [2]). In others, such as Bacillus subtilis, Rho homologs play a smaller role, and Rho-independent
termination is the norm.
Detection of transcription termination sites is key to understanding the operon structure of bacterial genomes. Understanding the operons, in turn, gives us strong hints about
gene function. Computational detection of termination signals is the only practical means of identifying large numbers
of terminators today, and few experimentally verified terminators exist outside of B. subtilis and E. coli. Several previous
computational methods [3,4] have relied on simple decision
boundaries to separate terminators from non-terminators
after training on experimentally known terminating and nonterminating sequences. Other studies have considered only
the hairpin portion of potential terminators [5,6]. Due to lack
of sequence data, previous systems (for example, [4,7]) have
tended to focus on E. coli or on only a portion of the nowavailable genomes.
We describe here TransTermHP, a computational method for
the rapid and accurate detection of these signals in genomic
DNA. TransTermHP searches genomic DNA for terminators
and assigns each candidate terminator a score related to the
likelihood that it arose by chance. We assess sensitivity and
specificity of our predictions using a set of experimentally
verified operons [3]. Our method achieves accuracy comparable with a recent method [3] while at the same time being
much faster and not dependent on a training set of known
terminators.
A previous system [8] by one of the authors of the current
study predicted terminators within intergenic regions by contrasting candidates with terminator-like structures that occur
within genes. Since the intragenic sequences were used as a
background signal, the system could not assign scores to
structures inside genes and its scores depended on the distribution of relatively rare terminator-like sequences inside
genes. TransTermHP uses a completely new, more general
model of background signal and a new scoring function that
makes it less sensitive to the accuracy of the genome annotation. TransTermHP is built around a new search algorithm
that employs dynamic programming to search genomes ten
times faster than the system of Ermolaeva et al. [8] and hundreds of times faster than the method of de Hoon et al. [3].
The algorithm can scan a 4 megabase genome in under 50
seconds on a single commodity processor.
Using the accuracy and speed of the new method we have
made predictions of Rho-independent terminators for 343
bacterial and archaeal genomes (comprising the complete
collection of finished prokaryotic genomes available from
GenBank). These predictions are available on the web and
represent the largest and most varied collection of putative
terminators available to date.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/2/R22

A recent paper [3] considered Rho-independent terminators
in the Firmicutes division of bacteria extensively and found
within them a large number of intrinsic termination signals, a
finding we corroborate. Outside the Firmicutes, we find that
15 organisms (from the Neisseria, Vibrio, and Psychrobacter
genera, the Pasteurellaceae, as well as Pseudoalteromonas
haloplanktis, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) also appear to employ intrinsic termination
for a large fraction of their termination signals.
It has been noted [9-11] for some organisms in the Neisseria
genus and the Pasteurellaceae that transcription terminators
often include DNA uptake signal sequences (USSs). These
uptake signals are short (approximately 9-11 nucleotides
(nt)), highly conserved sequences that occur repeatedly (generally ≥ 1,000 times) in a bacterial genome and that facilitate
the incorporation of exogenous DNA into the cells of naturally
transformable bacteria (see [12,13] for reviews). Many of the
termination signals predicted by TransTermHP in these
organisms include USS motifs within their hairpins. We
expand past analysis of this phenomenon to additional organisms and present evidence that this is not an artifact of the
prediction method nor a result of some other preference for a
hairpin configuration of USS sites: these organisms appear to
have co-opted the uptake signals for use in transcription termination. In addition, we propose a new USS motif for H.
ducreyi that has been overlooked by previous studies. Finally,
we discuss a bias in the configuration of USS motifs that form
hairpins.

Results and discussion
Algorithm to search for candidate terminators
TransTermHP searches whole prokaryotic genomes for
intrinsic terminators of the type depicted in Figure 1: a short,
low-energy hairpin followed downstream by a stretch of
thymine nucleotides (which are transcribed into uracils). The
15 bases on the 3' end of the motif are called the 'T-tail', while
the 15 bases on the 5' side are called the 'A-tail', as the same
sequence often functions as a terminator on both strands,
requiring the preservation of adenines at the 5' end (which are
the thymine residues of the T-tail at the 3' end on the opposite
strand). Due to the difference in stability of a G-U pairing versus the complementary C-A pairing in RNA, the hairpins
found on one strand of the genome will, in general, be different from those found on the opposite strand. Consequently,
the search algorithm described below is performed once for
each strand.
Every window of DNA of length six that contains at least three
thymines is examined to see whether it is the hairpin-proximal end of a tail of a potential terminator. The position adjacent to the 5' side of such a window is a candidate 'reference
position' for the 3' end of a terminator hairpin and the
sequence downstream of this position is the potential tail. The
first 15 bases of the potential tail sequence are scored using a

The above search procedure will find many terminators that
overlap. While some overlapping terminators may be of interest (as candidates for terminator/antiterminator pairs, for
example), others clearly are not. In particular, we remove
from consideration any terminator that is a subsequence of
another terminator with better hairpin and tail scores.
Because the hairpins of bidirectional terminators tend to be
flanked by stretches of adenines on one side and complementary thymines on the other, we also remove any terminator for
which the bottom half of the stem appears to be a hybridization between the two tails of a bidirectional terminator. Specifically, we discard any terminator that is a super-sequence
of another terminator and has five or more consecutive
adenines in the 5'-most half of the 5' side of the hairpin stem

The computed hairpin_score[i,j] gives the energy of the

the best hairpin adjacent to the reference position j. In other
words, the 5' endpoint is taken to be argmini
hairpin_score[i,j] where i ranges over the possible endpoints within a bounded distance of j. To reduce the number
of candidates that we must store, we keep only candidates
with tail score ≤ -2.5 and hairpin scores ≤ -2. In addition, we
discard any candidates with stems of length ≤ 4.

The energy of potential hairpin configurations adjacent to a
reference position can be found efficiently with a dynamic
programming algorithm similar to classic RNA folding algorithms [14,15]. The recurrence equation for this algorithm is
given below for completeness. The table entry
hairpin_score[i,j] gives the cost of the best hairpin structure for which the base of the 5' stem is at nucleotide position
i and the base of the 3' stem is at position j. The entry
hairpin_score[i,j] can be computed recursively as follows:

⎧ 0.9 xn −1
⎪
xn = ⎨
⎪
⎩ 0.6 xn −1

Since terminators are small structures, we are only interested
in values of hairpin_score[i,j] for which j - i + 1 is a small
constant. Hence, we need to keep only a small portion of the
table and thus the space used is constant relative to the size of
the genome. Because we fill at most a constant-sized table for
each nucleotide position the running time is asymptotically
linear in the number of candidate reference positions. For the
predictions below, we require the total extent of the stemloop structure to be less than 59 nt long. If j is a candidate reference position then j + 1 is likely to be one as well. By appropriately arranging the values of the hairpin_score[i,j] table
in memory, we can reuse the values computed for index j
when considering index j + 1, resulting in a further practical
increase in speed. We refer the reader to the available source
code for implementation details (Additional data file 1).

tail_score(s) = − ∑ xn

The function energy(i,j) gives the cost of pairing the nucleotide at i with that at j, and loop_pen(n) gives the cost of a
hairpin loop of length n. The hairpin's loop is forced to have a
length between 3 and 13 nt, inclusive, by setting
loop_pen(n) to a large constant for any n outside that range.
The constant 'gap' gives the cost of not pairing a base with
some base on the opposite stem and thus introducing a gap on
one side of the hairpin stem. The values for these costs for
evaluating the quality of hairpins (Table 1) are taken from
Ermolaeva et al. [8], where they were trained from a set of 70
previously known E. coli terminators [4]. The selection of
these values are the only instance of training, and the performance of TransTermHP is robust against other reasonable
choices of the parameters.

and five or more consecutive thymines in the 3'-most half of
the 5' side of the hairpin stem. To further discourage the A-tail
and T-tail regions of potential bidirectional terminators from
pairing, we require that the first base in the hairpin base closest to the T-tail not be a thymine.
In practice, our search procedure is very fast. It can search the
complete 4.2 megabases of the B. subtilis genome (including
intragenic regions) using a standard desktop machine in
under one minute. In contrast, on the same machine, a recent
method [3] took over two days to scan only the regions immediately downstream of genes. The speed of our search algorithm facilitates interactive experimentation and refinement
and permits predictions for many genomes to be undertaken.
Our specialized, dynamic-programming-based hairpin
search algorithm is the basis for TransTermHP's speed. While
this algorithm does not have the biophysical accuracy of more
advanced RNA folding programs (for example, [16,17]), such
accuracy is likely unnecessary for prediction of the short, generally high-quality hairpins that constitute transcription
terminators.

Function to evaluate the quality of terminators
The search process assigns a hairpin score H and a tail score
T to every potential terminator. From these values and
genomic context we compute a combined score as a measure
of the overall quality of the putative terminator. Previous
methods [3,4] have distilled a single score from the hairpin
and tail scores by using a linear combination of the two values, where the weights in the linear combination are the
result of a training process. Here, we take a different
approach to avoid training with limited data. We assign a
score Cgc(H,T), defined below, that is related to the probability of finding a terminator of equal or better quality in a random sequence and is a measure of how unlikely the structure
is to have arisen by chance.
Let Rgc(H,T) be the number of terminators with hairpin score
≤ H and tail score ≤ T found in a random sequence of length L
with GC content gc. We define the combined score as:
⎛ max{1, Rgc ( H , T )} ⎞
C gc ( H , T ) = ( −100 / log( L ))log ⎜
⎟.
⎜
⎟
L
⎝
⎠

(3)

Thus, if many terminator-like structures in random
sequences have both better tails and better hairpins than the
terminator under consideration, the terminator will receive a
low score. Rgc(H,T) is computed empirically using randomly
generated DNA sequences of length L = 20 Mb where each
base is drawn from a distribution so that the generated
sequence has expected GC content gc. The maximization in
the numerator ensures that the expression remains welldefined even if no terminator-like structure with hairpin
score ≤ H and tail score ≤ T is seen in the random sequence.
The -100/log(L) factor normalizes the scores to range
between 0 and 100. Ignoring this normalization, the com-

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/2/R22

bined score is the log of an estimate of the probability that a
terminator as good or better would occur at a given position
in a random sequence. In contrast to the scheme used in a
predecessor system [8], this combined score allows assignment of scores to structures inside genes, is monotonically
decreasing in each dimension, and smoothly handles candidates that occur in the real data less often than expected by
chance.
The function Cgc depends on the genome's GC content
because the expected distribution of hairpin energies and the
likelihood of a good T-tail vary with the frequency of G and C
nucleotides. We use the empirically computed intra- or intergenic GC-bias for the value of gc in Cgc depending on whether
or not the putative terminator occurs inside an annotated
coding region. To improve efficiency, Cgc is calculated approximately from a set of pre-computed tables.

Validation of predictions in B. subtilis
We ran TransTermHP on the complete genome of B. subtilis,
an organism for which Rho-independent termination is suspected to play a predominant role. For each gene, we take the
highest scoring terminator (according to equation 3) in the
region beginning 25 nt upstream of its stop codon continuing
until either the start of a gene on the same strand, or 500 nt
downstream of the stop codon, whichever is shorter. In the
case of terminators with tied scores, we choose the terminator
closest to the stop codon of the upstream gene.
To determine the sensitivity and specificity of our search procedure and scoring scheme and to facilitate comparisons, we
follow the testing methodology of de Hoon et al. [3], who provide a set of operons with experimental support [3] that they
use to derive examples of terminating and non-terminating
regions in B. subtilis. They take as positive examples those
regions annotated in this data set as having terminators. No
terminators should be found following genes that are internal
to an experimentally validated operon and do not have readthrough terminators following them. Any such region containing a predicted terminator is considered a false positive.
Using the most recent GenBank annotation, this yields 458
positive and 562 negative examples (which differs slightly
from the 463 positive and 567 negative regions reported by
[3], due to differences in annotations).
The percentage of regions where a terminator is experimentally expected for which TransTermHP finds a terminator is
shown in Figure 2 for various false positive rates. When TransTermHP is set at the extremely conservative false positive
rate of 0.7%, it finds a terminator in 77% of the positive
regions, suggesting that there is a set of exceptionally good
terminators for which prediction is easy. Sensitivity rapidly
rises, reaching 88% by the time the false positive rate has
increased to just 2.1%.

Terminator predictions for 343 organisms
We used TransTermHP to predict terminators for all the complete bacterial and archaeal genomes currently available from
GenBank (343 genomes at the time of this study). Because of
the greatly improved speed of TransTermHP, this requires
less than four CPU hours. Complete predictions and the best
terminator following each gene in each of the organisms are
available online [18].

information

It is interesting to note the apparent accuracy that TransTermHP achieves without significant training. One may have
assumed that other palindromic sequences (such as certain

We label as 'high confidence' those terminators with a score
greater than or equal to the cutoff necessary to achieve a 2.5%
false positive rate in B. subtilis (yielding an 88% true positive
rate). In the rest of this paper, we analyze high-confidence
terminators that we predict in organisms without experimentally determined terminators.

refereed research

de Hoon et al. [3] introduced a method to predict terminators
in which they learn a decision rule (line) separating terminators from non-terminators in the two-dimensional plane
where one axis marks hairpin energy and the other measures
the quality of the terminator tail. They report 93.95% sensitivity at 94.36% specificity after fitting the parameters of their
decision rule to optimize performance on this data set. TransTermHP performs comparably with no real training: TransTermHP achieves 93.0% sensitivity at 93.6% specificity. The
slightly higher numbers for the decision rule method may
result from over-fitting, and its performance may not generalize outside of the training set. Indeed, the 13 terminators
predicted by the decision rule method for regions in which
TransTermHP finds no terminator at this specificity tend to
have higher hairpin energies than other predictions, suggesting that their classification may be more affected by slight
changes in the learned hyperplane. (The average reported
hairpin energy of these 13 is -7.7 kcal/mol, while the average
hairpin energy of all terminators reported by de Hoon et al.
[3] in B. subtilis is -14 kcal/mol.)

At a false positive rate of 10%, TransTermHP is unable to find
any structures distinguishable from those found in random
sequence in 5% of the positive regions, and for any false positive rate < 100% there remain 3.3% of the positive regions
that do not contain a predicted terminator. It is possible that
these regions are incorrectly labeled, rely on other methods of
termination (for example, Rho-mediated), or have terminators outside of the search region (that is, far from the stop
codon of the final gene of an operon). Alternatively, terminators in these regions may be functionally constrained to be
weak terminators to enable occasional read-through, or it
may be that there are structures within these regions that
function well as terminators even though they cannot be distinguished from random sequences.

At comparable false positive rates, TransTermHP and the
decision rule method [3] make similar predictions following
87% of B. subtilis genes. For these genes, either both methods
predict no terminator is present in the downstream region or
the terminator predicted by de Hoon et al. [3] is contained
within the terminator predicted by TransTermHP (including
15 flanking nucleotides on either side of the hairpin). For 3%
of the genes, TransTermHP predicts a terminator where none
is predicted by the decision rule method, and for 5.8% of
genes each method predicts a different terminator. Hence,
while the methods agree on a large core of terminator predictions, they also complement each other with differing predictions for terminators following 544 genes.

classes of transcription factor binding sites) often found in
intergenic regions would contribute to a high false positive
rate. While some false positives may come from such signals,
their number does not seem to impact performance significantly. This makes sense from a mechanistic viewpoint: whatever other functions such a sequence has, if it looks like a
terminator, it will interrupt termination, and so such motifs
will be selected against in regions in which termination is
undesirable. While more advanced machine learning techniques may be helpful for improving performance, they do
not seem essential for eliminating false positives.

Due to a lack of large-scale experimental evidence, we are not
able to assess the sensitivity/specificity tradeoff for TransTermHP on genomes other than that of B. subtilis as discussed
above. However, as previously noted [3], those genes that are
followed by at least two convergently transcribed genes (that
is, → ← ←) are likely final genes in a transcription unit, and
so we expect to find a termination signal situated downstream
of them. We label these regions 'robust' tail-to-tail regions.
We use the percentage of such regions in a genome that contain a high-confidence terminator as a statistic that measures
both TransTermHP's sensitivity and the importance of Rhoindepenent termination in an organism. Unfortunately, we
cannot untangle the two: the discovery of few terminators in
these tail-to-tail regions may indicate a low importance of the
hairpin/uracil-tail motif in termination, or it may indicate
that the terminators are not sufficiently different from random sequences under our scoring scheme. Because of the
accuracy of TransTermHP in B. subtilis, we would expect the
former is true, but can not rule out the latter. The terminators
predicted in robust tail-to-tail regions for each of the organisms are available in Additional data file 2.
The apparent importance of Rho-independent termination
varies across the taxa of prokaryotes. A few previous studies
considered sufficiently many organisms from a phylogenetic
grouping to assess the relative importance of Rho-independent transcription termination for species in that grouping.
TransTermHP's predictions are in line with these previous
studies. Among our predictions, archaea generally do not
contain high-confidence terminators: averaged over the 27
archaeal genomes, only 11% of the robust tail-to-tail regions
contain them. This is in agreement with previous studies that
showed that hairpins are not over-represented following
genes in archaea [5,6]. That TransTermHP finds few terminators among these organisms is further evidence that it has a
low false positive rate at the high-confidence threshold.
A recent study [3] found intrinsic termination to be the dominant termination mechanism among Firmicutes, a finding
that our predictions confirm. Across the 56 Bacilli, on average
79% of the considered tail-to-tail regions contained a highconfidence terminator. Among the 7 Clostridia and 16 Mollicutes, fewer terminators were found (on average, 65% and
59%, respectively). Only 9 Firmicutes had high-confidence
terminators in fewer than 60% of their robust tail-to-tail
regions. Eight of these are Mollicutes; the ninth is the
Clostridium Moorella thermoacetica. In agreement with [6],
terminators were rarely found in Mycoplasma genitalium
(20%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (24%). However, no
Rho homolog is known to be present in these genomes [19],
and so either a novel terminator mechanism is used, or the
termination signals present in these organisms are weaker
and more similar to random sequences.
In addition, several non-Firmicutes have a high-confidence
terminator in a large fraction of their tail-to-tail regions

stop codon of the convergently transcribed gene is found, whichever is
longer. The region between two convergently transcribed genes
counts as two robust tail-to-tail regions (one for each strand) if both
genes are preceded by a co-directed gene. FTT is the percentage of
robust tail-to-tail regions containing a terminator, and NTT is the
number of robust tail-to-tail regions in each organism.

(Table 2), suggesting that Rho-independent termination
plays an important role. Organisms in the Neisseria and
Vibrio genera, the Pasteurellaceae as well as several others
listed in Table 2 employ Rho-independent termination extensively. All except F. nucleatum are proteobacteria. The distribution of stem lengths for the best, high-confidence
terminators following genes for six of these organisms are
shown in Figure 3, with the caveat that, because we focus on
high-confidence terminators, these distributions may be
skewed toward high-quality hairpins. The Neisseria genus
has, among these, the longest stems on average. Their long
stems, however, are accompanied by fewer thymines in their
tail regions. These long stem lengths (mode = 11) are necessary to accommodate the highly conserved uptake sequence
signals (see below) that are prevalent in these organisms.

Extended USS motifs

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R22

information

The USS sites in both Neisseria and Pasteurellaceae are often
found within a longer, imperfectly conserved motif [10,11]. In
H. influenzae, the extended motif follows the pattern:
aaAAGTGCGGTnrwwwwwnnnnnnrwwwww, where 'n' indicates any base, 'r' indicates {A,G} and 'w' indicates {A,T} (Figure 4a). In Neisseria, the extended motif is
aaatGCCGTCTGAAa. In H. ducreyi, we find that the extended
motif is AAGCGGTyrwwwwwnnnn followed by an overrepresentation of A and T residues until about 25 nt following the
3' end of the core motif (Figure 4b), but this pattern is more
weakly conserved. In all cases, these extended motifs begin
with a stretch of adenine residues, which, if a pair of USS
motifs is arranged into a hairpin in the +- configuration, will
cause the hairpin to be flanked by adenines on the 5' end and
thymines on the 3' end. Because the extended motifs are
apparent even among USSs that are not involved in hairpins,
we cannot directly conclude that because such a USS hairpin
is followed by a stretch of thymines, it is a terminator. However, a more extensive analysis does support the conclusion

interactions

We considered the highest-scoring, high-confidence terminator in the 500 nt downstream of each gene (beginning 25 nt
upstream of the stop codon), if one exists. For several organisms in the Neisseria and Pasteurellaceae groupings, we
found that a large percentage of these putative terminators
contain the known USS motifs (Table 3). Here, we say a terminator contains the motif if the motif or its reverse complement is present in the sequence consisting of the hairpin and
two flanking residues on each side. (Inclusion of the flanking
residues is necessary because the Pasteurellacae motif begins
with an AA dinucleotide and TransTermHP will not include

In N. meningitides Z2491, 81% of the USS instances within
intergenic regions that have a high-confidence terminator are
contained within a high-confidence terminator (though perhaps not the best one). Percentages are similar in the other
Neisseria. In H. influenzae, on the other hand, only 34% of
such USS sites are contained within a terminator. The other
Pasteurellacaea have similar low percentages (29% to 42%).

refereed research

Hundreds of copies of short, highly conserved DNA segments
(called USSs) aid some bacteria such as N. meningitidis and
Haemophilus influenzae in selectively incorporating homologous exogenous DNA [12,13,20-22]. These uptake signal
sequences have been found to frequently occur within transcription terminator hairpins [9-11,22]. Smith et al. [11]
examined N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae and note that, on small scales, the distance between copies of the USS is not randomly distributed but rather there is
an excess of copies of the motif on opposite strands within a
small distance of one another, thus forming a sequence that
may fold into a hairpin when transcribed into RNA.

Among Pasteurellaceae, the percentage of terminators containing known USSs is lower (between 17% and 29%). Though
P. multocida has a larger genome than H. influenzae (2.26
Mb versus 1.83 Mb), it has 37% fewer instances of the USS
motif, and fewer high-confidence terminators (17%) contain
the motif. Interestingly, the most common motif within highconfidence terminators in H. ducreyi (AAGCGGT) matches
the USS for the other Pasteurellaceae (AAGTGCGGT) except
for an excision of a GT dinucleotide sequence. This shorter
motif occurs 1,371 times in the genome (expected frequency is
140 occurrences), suggesting that it may also function as a
USS. Previous studies [10,23] failed to find any USS in H.
ducreyi due to this difference from the expected H. influenzae-derived motif. No previous study has reported on the
uptake signal sequences for Mannheimia succiniciproducens. Thus, in addition to quantifying their involvement in
intrinsic terminators, we report the first evidence of these signals in these species.

pairings between the A-tail and T-tail in its reported hairpin.)
In fact, approximately 55% of such terminators in the Neisseria contain an exact match to the known uptake signal
sequence (GCCGTCTGAA) for that genus. Approximately
40% of genes are followed by a high-confidence terminator,
suggesting that most operon ends contain a high-confidence
terminator, and thus many operons end with a terminator
that contains the USS motif.

Column N gives number of USS instances in the genome. Column R gives the number of genes followed by a high-confidence terminator, and column
G gives this as a percentage of the total number of genes. These genes are the most likely operon ends. Column U gives the number of these likely
operon ends for which the best high-confidence terminator contains at least one exact match to the USS motif or its reverse complement. Column
P gives this number as a percentage of the likely operon ends (P = U/G). (Because of the requirements for high-confidence terminators, the USS motif
likely pairs with a similar, but perhaps imperfect, USS motif on the opposite side of the hairpin stem.) A large fraction of predicted operon ends have
a terminator that contains a USS signal. For H. ducreyi the motif AAGCGGT is not known to be a USS; however, its prevalence in the genome and
similarity to the USS motif in other Pasteurellaceae lead us to conjecture that it functions as a USS. Only 1% of the likely operon ends in H. ducreyi
had a terminator containing the USS motif found in the other Pasteurellaceae.

that USS hairpins are maintained to promote transcription
termination.

Evidence that paired USS motifs function as terminators
We searched the genome of N. meningitidis Z2491 for closely
spaced (within 10 nt), oppositely directed instances of USS
sites. Such hairpin configurations of the USS sites occur most
frequently between oppositely oriented genes (tail-to-tail
regions, → ←, Table 4), and considering both the relatively
small number of tail-to-tail regions and their short total
length, these regions are enriched for hairpin instances. This
remains true even accounting for the varied distribution of
single USS motifs within each region type ('No. of USS' column in Table 4). The conservation of the extended motif on
either side of the hairpin also supports the conclusion that
these function as terminators. Looking at the reference strand
as recorded in GenBank, we see that the conservation of T and
A nucleotides flanking these hairpins follows the pattern
expected given the region in which the hairpin is found (Table
4). For example, those between two forward-directed genes
(forward tail-to-head regions, → →) have more conserved Ts
in their T-tail region on average, while for reverse tail-to-head
regions (← ←) the opposite is true and more nucleotides are
conserved in the A-tail. Both the A-tail and T-tail are enriched
for their respective nucleotides for hairpins in tail-to-tail
regions. The patterns are similar for the other organisms
listed in Table 3.
While overall there are about equal numbers of occurrences
of a USS motif and its reverse complement in all the genomes
in Table 5, there is a strong bias in the orientations of the USS
motifs located near each other in the Neisseria genus and a
similar, less pronounced bias in the Pasteurellacaea. This bias

was previously noted in H. influenzae [10] and N. meningitidis [11], and we observe it in N. gonorrhoeae and other Pasteurellacaea. In Neisseria, the configuration GCCGTCTGAA
closely followed by TTCAGACGGC (+- in Table 5) is far more
common than TTCAGACGGC closely followed by GCCGTCTGAA (-+ in Table 5) despite both arrangements forming highquality hairpins. This is likely because the +- configuration
places the AAAT at the 5' end of the extended motif into positions to form the A- and T-tails of the terminator. This is also
true in the Pasteurellacaea, in which the +- configuration
places the AAAA sequence at the 5' end of the extended motif
into the tail positions. The situation in these organisms is
more complex, however, as the +- configuration also causes
the long 3' ends of the extended USS motifs to interact. This
interference of the 3' ends of the extended motifs may be the
cause of the reduced bias in the Pasteurellacaea and perhaps
the lessened prevalence of the USS motif within terminators.
As expected, if the primary reason for nearby USS motifs is
development of terminator hairpins, consecutive instances of
the motif in the same orientation within 10 nt of each other
are rare (++ and -- in Table 5).
The number of the pairs separated by a given distance d is
plotted in Figure 5, and the proportion of those pairs in the +configuration is indicated. Spikes at separations of approximately 8 nt and approximately 19-22 nt reflect the best
arrangements to preserve the long 3' end of the extended USS
motif [11]. After a separation of about 30 nt, there is no bias
toward +- in any of the Pasteurellacaea. In H. ducreyi, 75% of
the 83 USS pairs spaced approximately 30 nt apart are in the
+- configuration. However, at distances approximately 25 nt
a majority of the pairs are in the -+ arrangement. One possible explanation for this is that the shorter H. ducreyi core

information

We have described a highly efficient, accurate computational
system for predicting Rho-independent transcription termination in bacterial genomes, and we have used this system to
predict terminators in hundreds of genomes for which no
such predictions were previously available. Our predictions
for 343 organisms are available on the web [18], and can be
downloaded in bulk, by organism, or they can be searched
based on score, genomic context, and features of their
sequence. Terminators downstream of specified genes can be
found as well. They represent the most complete set of terminator predictions yet available.

interactions

The bias in genomic context, conservation pattern of the
extended motifs, and the preference for an orientation that
creates good A- and T-tails support the notion that USS hairpin configurations are maintained to promote transcription
termination, and Table 3 quantifies the propensity for terminators to include USS signals. Evolutionary expediency may
be the reason for the co-location of these signals. The prevalence of so many copies of a short motif and its complement
(as required to ensure selective uptake) likely facilitates the
creation of many hairpins that can be co-opted for termination simply by point mutations to create a strong T-tail. By
reusing the USS, it is no longer necessary for there to be a

series of coordinated, complementary mutations for the
development of hairpin structures.

refereed research

motif is more dependent on the preservation of the full
extended motif, which itself is biased toward A and T residues
over a longer region. That hairpin USS pairs in H. ducreyi are
forced either to be separated by a long loop or to overlay the
GC-rich core motif with the AT-rich extended motif may
account for the lower percentage of terminators that contain
USS motifs in this organism.

the H. ducreyi motif with the H. influenzae motif. (An alternative alignment places position -4 in H. ducreyi across from position -6 in H. influenzae.)
Examining the frequencies, we can derive a consensus pattern as follows. We mark a position with a 'w' if more than 70% of the occurrences contain an A
or a T (expected frequency of an A or T = 60%). We mark a column with a 'y' or 'r' if more than 60% of the occurrences have a T or a C (for 'y') or A or
a G (for 'r'). The expected frequency for either case is 50%. The 'rwwwwnnnn' from positions +2 to +11 matches the previously identified extended motif
for H. influenzae, though the rwwww motif is not as clear. The subsequent 'nnrwwwww' from the extended H. influenzae motif is not exactly matched in H.
ducreyi but there is a general bias toward A and T residues extending to about +25.

Analysis of all hairpins of the GCCGTCTGAA...TTCAGACGGC and TTCAGACGGC...GCCGTCTGAA motif in N. meningitidis Z2491. Hairpins
were found by exhaustive search as described in the text. The pattern of conservation of nucleotides in the regions flanking the hairpins reflects that
expected if the hairpins are being maintained to function as transcription terminators. The 'No. of reg' column gives the number of intergenic regions
of positive length of each type. The 'No. of USS' column gives the number of USS instances (not necessarily paired) within each region type. The 'No.
of hairpins' column lists the number of hairpin configurations of USS motifs (separated by ≤ 10 nt) that overlap each type of region. (For intragenic
regions, we require that the hairpin be wholly contained within a gene.) The 'A-tail' column gives the average number of A residues in the five bases
preceding the first occurrence of the motif in the pair. The 'T-tail' column gives the average number of T residues in the five bases following to the
second occurrence of the motif in the pair.

The speed and accuracy of TransTermHP has facilitated the
discovery of a likely DNA uptake motif in H. ducreyi where
none was previously known. Though most USS signals are not
involved in termination, we have given more evidence that
some USS pairs within Neisseria and Pasteurellacaea are
maintained in hairpin configurations in order to affect transcription termination, and we have quantified the tendency
for terminators to include USS motifs.
TransTermHP is designed to detect the common, classic
intrinsic terminator motif: a hairpin stem followed by a polyU tail. The method may be less accurate in detecting those terminators that deviate from this motif, for example, by lacking

the uracil-rich tail. Given the high sensitive and specificity of
TransTermHP, if it is unable to find many high-quality terminators in an organism that lacks a Rho homolog, this may be
a hint that some variant of the intrinsic terminator motif is
used.
In addition to its immediate utility for accurately finding Rhoindependent terminators, we hope the method and accompanying software will be a useful starting point for developing
other improved systems for terminator prediction, investigations of structural properties of intrinsic terminators (in the
spirit of [5]), as well as related problems such as discovery of
anti-termination structures [24].

For the organisms listed in the table, the USS motif occurs with approximate equal frequency on each strand. The 'Total +' and 'Total -' columns give
the number of times the motif occurs on the reference strand as deposited in GenBank (+) and how many times it occurs on the complementary
strand (-). The '++' and '--' columns count the number of occurrences in which the motifs occurred on the same strand within 10 nt of each other.
As expected, since these configurations do not induce hairpins, they are relatively rare. The '+-' and '-+' columns give the number of occurrences of
the USS motifs on opposing strands separated by ≤ 10 nt. There is an overabundance of +- pairs, representing, for example, a preference for the
GCCGTCTGAA...TTCAGACGGC hairpin over the TTCAGACGGC...GCCGTCTGAA hairpin.
