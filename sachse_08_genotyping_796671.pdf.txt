Abstract
Background: The currently used genotyping system for the avian zoonotic pathogen
Chlamydophila (C.) psittaci has evolved from serology and is based on ompA sequence variations. It
includes seven avian and two non-avian genotypes. Restriction enzyme cleavage of the amplified
ompA gene and, less frequently, ompA sequencing are being used for examination, but, beside
methodological limitations, an increasing number of recently tested strains could not be assigned
to any established genotype.
Results: Comprehensive analysis of all available ompA gene sequences has revealed a remarkable
genetic diversity within the species C. psittaci, which is only partially covered by the present
genotyping scheme. We suggest adjustments and extensions to the present scheme, which include
the introduction of subgroups to the more heterogeneous genotypes A, E/B and D, as well as six
provisional genotypes representing so far untypable strains. The findings of sequence analysis have
been incorporated in the design of a new DNA microarray. The ArrayTube™ microarray-based
ompA genotyping assay has been shown to discriminate among established genotypes and identify
so far untyped strains. Its high specificity, which allows detection of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms, is due to the parallel approach consisting in the use of 35 hybridization probes
derived from variable domains 2 and 4 of the ompA gene.
Conclusion: The traditional genotyping system does not adequately reflect the extent of intraspecies heterogeneity in ompA sequences of C. psittaci. The newly developed DNA microarraybased assay represents a promising diagnostic tool for tracing epidemiological chains, exploring the
dissemination of genotypes and identifying non-typical representatives of C. psittaci.

Background
The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydophila (C.)
psittaci, the causative agent of psittacosis in birds and
humans, is a well-established pathogen responsible for

regular outbreaks of disease in psittacine birds and
domestic poultry [1], as well as cases of atypical pneumonia in exposed persons [2,3].

The current definition of the species C. psittaci includes
the former avian serovars of Chlamydia psittaci, but even
under the recently revised taxonomic classification of the
family Chlamydiaceae [4] it remains a heterogeneous taxon
in terms of host range and virulence. To facilitate epidemiological studies, strains of the agent were subdivided into
serovars A, B, C, D, E, and F on the basis of their immune
reaction with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)
recognising specific epitopes of the major outer membrane protein (MOMP). Each serovar was assumed to
exhibit more or less stringent host specificity [5-7]. Later
on, Sayada et al. [8] suggested restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP), i.e. PCR amplification of the ompA
gene with subsequent restriction enzyme analysis, for differentiation among C. psittaci isolates. Vanrompay et al.
[9] were able to demonstrate by comparison of serotyping
and PCR-RFLP that the serovars had genetic equivalents in
the corresponding genotypes, which were defined by their
restriction enzyme cleavage pattern. Thus, nine different
genotypes have been generally accepted to date, seven of
which are thought to predominantly occur in a particular
order or class of Aves and two in non-avian hosts, i.e. genotype A in psittacine birds, B in pigeons, C in ducks and
geese, D in turkeys, E in pigeons, ducks and others, F in
parakeets, WC in cattle, and M56 in rodents. In addition,
Geens et al. [10] suggested the introduction of genotype
E/B to represent a group of isolates from ducks. Most of
the avian genotypes have also been identified sporadically
in isolates from cases of zoonotic transmission to
humans.
While serotyping can be conducted with cultured strains
only, PCR-RFLP was also used with DNA extracted from
clinical samples [9]. However, there are obvious limitations as substantial amounts of a PCR amplicon are
needed to produce distinctive and reproducible RFLP patterns on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Related
genotypes tend to have quite similar patterns, which may
be difficult to distinguish, and typing results based on different enzyme patterns (e.g. AluI vs. MboII) may be contradictory. Genetically aberrant strains cannot be genotyped
using the above-mentioned PCR-RFLP procedure.
Sequencing of the ompA gene and alignment with type
strain sequences can also be used to identify the genotype
of C. psittaci strains [10,11], since genotype-specific sites
are located in the gene's variable domains (VD) VD2 and
VD4. However, all these approaches have been used in a
rather pragmatic manner, i.e. with the aim of working out
distinctive features of isolates for epidemiological purposes, while disregarding the scope of natural sequence
variability and avoiding a molecular definition of individual genotypes at the nucleotide level.
In this situation, DNA microarray technology can be
expected to provide added value because of its highly par-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/63

allel approach, which implies the potential to exploit
minor sequence differences at multiple sites for discrimination among samples [12]. Using the ArrayTube™(AT)
platform, we recently demonstrated that the performance
parameters of an AT microarray assay for species identification of chlamydiae were comparable to real-time PCR
in terms of sensitivity and superior in specificity [13]. This
prompted us to take further advantage of the AT technology's high discriminatory capacity [14,12], rapidity and
relatively low cost by exploring its suitability for ompA
genotyping analysis. However, we immediately realized
that a comprehensive analysis of currently known ompA
sequences was necessary before considering the definition
of specific probes for each genotype.
In the present study, we report the results of an extensive
investigation on sequence similarity among all available
ompA sequences from species of the genus Chlamydophila
and describe the development of a DNA microarray-based
assay for ompA genotyping of C. psittaci.

Results
Analysis of ompA sequences of Chlamydophila strains
The NCBI database was searched for ompA sequences by
repeatedly running BLAST queries with sequences from
already known entries. In the course of this process it
became evident that some C. psittaci sequences were more
similar to ompA of other Chlamydophila spp. than to any
genotype of C. psittaci, which is in line with earlier publications [15-17]. Therefore, we extended our analysis to
include all sequences from the genus Chlamydophila.

Comparison of all available GenBank entries revealed 63
unique sequences of ompA genes. The alignment of these
sequences was the basis for calculation of a sequence similarity matrix (see Additional file 1) and construction of a
split network graph (Fig. 1). These graphs are useful tools
for presentation of sequence similarity-based relatedness,
but are not designed to characterize phylogenetic relationships. We minimized distorting effects due to alignment
of differently sized sequences by excluding the shortest
items and selecting a 992-nt sequence window which contains all variable domains. The most striking feature of the
split network graph is the great diversity among ompA variants of C. psittaci, which clearly exceeds variations among
other species of the genus. While C. pneumoniae, C. abortus, C. pecorum, C. felis, and C. caviae each are located on a
single branch, several genotypes of C. psittaci form their
own separate branches. At least 12 distinct clades belonging to this species can be identified, of which only 5 can
be directly attributed to currently accepted genotypes, i.e.
C, D, F, M56, and WC. Another remarkable feature is the
ABE cluster, i.e. a grouping harboring the closely related
genotypes A, B, E, and E/B. Similarity of the underlying
ompA sequences is above 98% within the cluster and

higher than 99.4% within the clade of genotypes B, E and
E/B. To visualize these relationships, a magnified scale
was used for presentation in Fig. 1a.
The M56 and Mat116 sequences represent less closely
related side branches of the ABE stembranch. Strains of
genotypes C, D and F are all located clearly separated from
each other, and a number of strains not assigned to one of
the accepted genotypes (strains 1V, YP84, R54, 6N, and
CPX0308) are placed fairly isolated, forming their own
branches at considerable genetic distances from the established genotypes. Genotype F (represented by strain
VS225), as well as strains YP84 and R54, were found to be
side branches of the C. abortus branch.

As a result of this sequence analysis, we identified 20 individual type strains, each of which represents a unique
ompA sequence. The findings are summarized in Table 1.
In this classification, genotypes A, D and E/B can be further divided into subgroups, and the six strains at the bottom of the table represent untyped C. psittaci strains.
All in all, the present sequence analysis has shown that the
extent of intra-species variation goes beyond the area covered by currently accepted genotypes.
Selection of hybridization probes
Using the global alignment of ompA sequences (see Additional file 2), we selected a panel of 35 oligonucleotide

probes for identification of C. psittaci genotypes, which
are shown in Table 2. The probe binding sites are located
in VD2 and VD4 of the ompA gene. A compilation showing the number of mismatches between targets of genotypes and hybridization probes is given in Table 3. These
data can be used for two purposes: a) to identify the genotype of the target DNA, and b) to predict signal intensities because perfect matches between probe and target will
produce the strongest signals.
Optimization of microarray hybridization
To ensure the availability of sufficient amounts of target
DNA for hybridization against a set of covalently bound
oligonucleotide probes in a spatially accessible structure,
amplification was conducted as duplex PCR. Using primer
pairs VD1-f/VD2-r and 201CHOMP/ompA-rev, two biotinylated fragments containing VDs 1+2 and VDs 3+4,
respectively, were produced. The resulting amplification
products gave rise to hybridization signals at comparable
intensity levels for VD2 and VD4 probes. In contrast,
when PCR products comprising the entire ompA gene were
hybridized, signals generated by binding to VD4 probes
were significantly lower than those of VD2 probes (data
not shown). This bias was compensated by doubling
molar concentrations of the second primer pair in the
above duplex PCR. Biotin labeling of target DNA via the
use of 5'-biotinylated primers was preferred over internal
labeling using biotin-dUTP because of higher sensitivity
(data not shown) and lower cost.

To optimize the specificity of microarray hybridization,
we systematically studied the influence of hybridization
temperature (TH) and washing conditions. While hybridization patterns of the various genotypes were satisfactorily
discernible at TH = 60°C, stringency was insufficient as
indicated by poor resolution between signals of perfectmatch probes and one-mismatch probes (data not
shown). In contrast, the introduction of high-temperature
(50°C) and low-salt buffer wash steps after both the
hybridization reaction and incubation with the streptavidin-HRP conjugate led to high signal ratios of perfectmatch vs. one-mismatch probes, so that single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) could be detected (see next paragraph). This high-stringency wash protocol even allowed
TH to be lowered to 50°C in order to gain sensitivity.
Microarray hybridization of type strains
Type strains of C. psittaci genotypes A, B, C, D, E, E/B, F,
M56 and WC were examined using the AT ompA genotyping array. Barplots showing the distinct hybridization patterns are presented in Fig. 2. Comparison with
theoretically expected, i.e. calculated patterns, revealed
excellent agreement (data not shown) in all individual
cases. Notably, regarding type strain patterns in the light
of matching parameters given in Table 3, it could be confirmed that signal intensities of completely matching
probes were significantly higher than those pertaining to
probes having one or two mismatches to the target. For
instance, Fig. 3 (upper part) illustrates that the signal of
genotype B-specific probe VD2-03 with type B strain CP3
was more than 5 times stronger than with type E strain
CPMN, which has a single mismatch in the target
sequence. Conversely, the same applies to genotype E-specific probe VD2-04. Hybridization duplexes of targets and
probes differing in two nucleotides were more than 10
times weaker than their perfect-match counterparts (see
Fig. 3, lower part).
Microarray hybridization of field isolates
A group of 12 field strains of C. psittaci was examined
using the present AT microarray (Table 4). Genotypes
were identified from the pattern of hybridization signals
according to the matching scheme in Table 3. In addition,
all strains were ompA sequenced, and genotypes were
determined according to individual positions in the above
global alignment. PCR-RFLP results are also given for
comparison in Table 4. The findings of AT ompA genotyping are in complete agreement with the data of the other
two tests.

Discussion
The currently accepted system of genotyping for C. psittaci
strains has evolved historically from its serological predecessor. The fact that serotypes have genotype equivalents
[9], which has also been reported for, e.g., E. coli [14],

proved to be helpful in the transition to the more accessible DNA-based typing methods, which are easier to standardize. However, given the serological history, it is not
surprising that the ompA sequence analysis has revealed
two notable limitations of the present genotype classification, i.e. the lack of complete coverage of naturally occurring strains and a general imbalance resulting from
significant variations in genetic distances between individual genotypes. The latter reflects an inherent bias since
the ideal panel would include genotypes genetically equidistant from each other.
Given the described deficiencies, the question about the
usefulness of the present genotyping scheme inevitably
arises. For instance, does the close genetic relatedness

within the ABE cluster justify its subdivision into the four
genotypes A, B, E and E/B?
The authors are of the opinion that there are important
arguments in favor of maintaining the present classification and nomenclature, provided it is amended by a few
adjustments and extensions.
i) Despite the amazing genetic heterogeneity displayed by
ompA sequence database entries, it seems that the vast
majority of field strains belong to the ABE cluster. This is
indicated by several published studies [18,10,11,19], by
the data presented in Table 4 and also the long-term experience of the authors' laboratories (data not shown). The

small group of so far untyped isolates appears to represent
only a small proportion of naturally occurring strains.
ii) Each genotype should be defined by a representative
reference strain and its complete ompA sequence. While a
genotyping system based on a single gene may not appear
sufficiently comprehensive in the age of genomics, it
should be noted that ompA encodes the major protein
antigen of chlamydiae, and even the minor sequence variations including SNPs are mostly translated into different
amino acids (and, potentially, different epitopes). The fact
that genotype-specific antigens can be distinguished by
specific MAbs indicates that these differences do matter in
the context of immunogenicity, host preference, virulence
and, thus, epidemiological importance. This is why we
suggest maintaining the currently accepted genotypes,
including the closely related ones of the ABE cluster.

iii) To account for the natural variability of ompA
sequences in C. psittaci strains, emerging branches of
untyped isolates should become provisional genotypes
until their epidemiological relevance and representative
status are proven. To account for intra-genotype variability, we suggest that heterogeneous genotypes, such as A, E/
B and D, should be further divided into subgroups named
after a typical representative, e.g. A-VS1, A-6BC, etc. (see
Table 1). This approach will ensure openness and flexibility of the genotyping scheme.
iv) The amended genotyping scheme should be re-evaluated and overhauled when a sufficiently large number of
complete genome sequences of C. psittaci strains becomes
available.
If ompA genotyping of C. psittaci is to be conducted in the
framework of surveillance and monitoring studies, the
performance of PCR-RFLP will be insufficient because of

Illustration
Illustration of the specificity of the hybridization reaction on the AT microarray for genotyping of C. psittaci.
Alignments of target (ompA gene segments) and probe sequences are shown on the left-hand side, and the respective hybridization signals (including internal staining marker) are given on the right-hand side. Upper part: The signal generated by duplex
formation at genotype E-specific probe VD2-04 is reduced to approx. 20% when the target has a single mismatch, such as genotype B. This applies also to genotype B-specific probe VD2-03, when reacting with genotype E. Lower part: Signal is reduced
to less than 10% in the case of two mismatches on the target sequence.

its limited sensitivity and inability to characterize atypical
strains. As mentioned above, serological typing is limited
to only six serotypes, but is not amenable to highthroughput examination and it lacks a strictly molecular
basis. The real-time PCR procedure proposed by Geens et
al (2005) can be very sensitive and specific for identification of seven of the established genotypes, but it is rather

laborious and expensive because each sample has to be
examined in seven individual runs. Sequencing of the
complete ompA gene should serve as the gold standard for
genotyping of C. psittaci since the respective DNA
sequence contains all details necessary for genotype identification and the data can be stored in public databases to
be easily accessible to researchers and diagnosticians.

However, due to cost and labor intensiveness, it is not feasible at present to use DNA sequencing of this 1212-bp
gene as a routine procedure in all diagnostic laboratories.
Being more rapid and economical, the AT microarray
assay developed in the present study represents a powerful
tool for sequence-based, sensitive and reproducible highthroughput genotyping. In principle, the procedure consists in parallel probing of 35 different targets and, in view
of the recognition of minor nucleotide sequence variations including SNPs, amounts to re-sequencing the discriminatory regions in VDs 2 and 4 of the ompA gene.
Future use of the AT ompA genotyping assay will enable
diagnosticians in human and veterinary medicine to trace
epidemiological chains, explore the dissemination of the
various genotypes and other strains of C. psittaci, as well as
identify new representatives of this amazing pathogen.

Methods
Chlamydial strains
Genomic DNA of the following reference strains, each
representing a particular genotype, was used to generate
master patterns for the ompA genotyping assay:

VS1 (genotype A, from parrot, USA, 1985), CP3 (genotype
B, from pigeon, USA, 1957), GR9 (genotype C, duck,
Europe, year unknown), NJ1 (genotype D, from turkey,
USA, 1959), CPMN (genotype E, ferret/human, USA,
1934), VS225 (genotype F, parakeet, USA, 1991), all of
which were described in reference 5 and obtained from
the chlamydia strain collection of AFSSA, Maisons-Alfort,
France. Strains WS/RT/E30 (genotype E/B; isolated from a
duck, Germany, 2001, reference 10), WC (from cattle,
USA, 1990, reference 7) and M56 (from muskrat, USA,
1961, reference 7) were kindly provided by Daisy Vanrompay, University of Ghent, Belgium.

Conclusion
According to the data of ompA analysis, C. psittaci is genetically the most heterogeneous species of the genus
Chlamydophila. The traditional genotyping system should
be amended and extended because it does not adequately
reflect the extent of intra-species heterogeneity. Serology,
PCR-RFLP and real-time PCR are unable to discriminate
among all currently accepted genotypes and identify
strains of new types. While genotyping based on complete
ompA sequences should serve as gold standard, many of
the smaller laboratories may not be able to use it in routine diagnosis. The results of the present study have demonstrated that the newly developed DNA microarraybased ompA genotyping assay represents a promising diagnostic tool.

In addition, the field isolates given in Table 4 were examined in this study.
Sequencing of the ompA gene
The complete gene was amplified by PCR using primers
CTU (5'-ATG AAA AAA CTC TTG AAA TCG G-3') and
ompA-rev (5'-TCC TTA GAA TCT GAA TTG AGC-3') using
the following cycling profile: initial denaturation 96°C
for 60 sec, 40 cycles of 96°C/15 sec, 50°C/60 sec, 72°C/
60 sec, final extension 72°C for 60 sec.

Products were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels, and the
specific bands of approximately 1200 bp were excised
with a scalpel and DNA extracted using the innuPREP Gel
Extraction Kit (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). DNA
sequencing was carried out by cycle sequencing using the
BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit

(Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) according to
the instructions of the manufacturer. The following primers were used: CTU, VD1-f (5'-ACT ACG GAG ATT ATG
TTT TCG ATC GTG T-3'), VD2-r (5'-CGT GCA CCY ACG
CTC CAA GA-3'), CHLAGEN-1 (5'-CGG CTG CAT TCA
ACT TGG-3'), 201CHOMP (5'-GGI GCW GMI TTC CAA
TAY GCI CAR TC-3'), and ompA-rev. Nucleotide
sequences were determined on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
In silico analysis of ompA sequences
All available sequences of the ompA gene of C. psittaci were
downloaded for analysis from the database of the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
A total of 210 sequence entries were found (by the date of
manuscript submission). Of these, 89 sequences shorter
than 500 nt were excluded from further analysis for failing
to cover all four variable domains. Of the remaining 121
entries, 68 were found to belong to C. psittaci and 53 to
other Chlamydophila species. Only 25 sequences from C.
psittaci and 28 from other Chlamydophila spp. were found
to include the full coding sequence (CDS) of approximately 1212 nt. In contrast, 70 entries lacked terminal
parts of the CDS, but were retained because for some genotypes not a single complete sequence was available. All
items were included in a global ompA sequence alignment
using the program E-INS-I of the MAFFT package [20].

Classification was done first by visual inspection of the
alignment using Clustal X [21] and subsequently by calculating a sequence similarity matrix (see Additional file 1),
from which a split network graph was constructed (Fig. 1)
using the program SplitsTree4 [22].
Before starting the similarity matrix calculation, redundant items were removed, i.e. any sequence that could be
retrieved under another sequence was deleted, and only
unique sequences were kept. The sequences were brought
to identical length by cropping highly conserved 3' ends
in order to avoid distorted results due to alignment of differently sized sequences. Thus, the analyzed segment
comprised 992 nucleotide positions (median sequence
length 942 nt) including all four variable domains. The
final set contained 63 unique sequences.
Microarray design
The present array carries 35 oligonucleotide probes recognizing targets from VD2 and VD4 of the ompA gene of Cp.
psittaci. Nucleotide sequences of all probes are provided in
Table 2. The oligonucleotides had the following features:
average size 26 nt (22 – 30), melting temperature 60.3°C
(59.7 – 61.2), G+C contents 46.0 mol-% (37.0 – 59.0).
Each probe sequence was subjected to local BLAST analysis against all known C. psittaci ompA sequences to verify
the respective genomic target and rule out unwanted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/63

cross-reactions. Biotinylated oligonucleotide probes were
added to monitor the staining reaction, mark the corners
of the array and facilitate normalization of signal intensities. Each genotype probe was spotted four-fold, the controls 15-fold, thus bringing the total number of spots on
the array to 155. Fabrication of the AT microarrays was
described previously [12].
DNA extraction
Cell cultured strains were DNA extracted using the High
Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany).
Biotinylation PCR and AT hybridization
Target DNA was amplified and biotinylated by duplex
PCR using two pairs of ompA primers covering all variable
domains. Primer pair VD1-f and VD2-r (sequence as
above, but 5'-biotinylated) gives rise to a 418-bp product
which includes VD1 and VD2, whereas primers
201CHOMP and ompA-rev (sequence as above, but 5'biotinylated) defined a product of 570 bp covering VD3
and VD4. The temperature-time profile was: initial denaturation at 96°C for 60 sec, 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec,
50°C for 60 ssec, 72°C for 30 sec, and final elongation at
72°C for 240 sec.

Each 20-μl reaction contained 10 pmol of the first and 20
pmol of the second primer pair, as well as 1 mM each of
dNTP mix, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas, St.
Leon-Roth, Germany), 2 μl 10 × PCR buffer (Fermentas),
1 μl 50 mM MgCl2, and 1 μl of the DNA template.
The AT vessel was conditioned by washing with 500 μl
each of deionized water and Hybridization buffer 1
(Clondiag Chip Technologies, Jena, Germany) at 50°C for
5 min. All incubations were carried out upon slight shaking (550 rpm) on a heatable horizontal tube shaker (Thermomixer comfort, Eppendorf, Cologne, Germany). For
denaturation, 1 μl of the 5'-biotinylated PCR product was
diluted with 99 μl hybridization buffer in a separate tube,
heated at 95°C for 5 min and put on ice. After transfer
into the AT, hybridization was allowed to proceed at 50°C
for 60 min. The supernatant was then discarded, and the
array was washed consecutively with 500 μl 2 × SSC/
0.01% Triton X-100 (50°C, 5 min), 500 μl 2 × SSC (50°C,
5 min), 500 μl 0.2 × SSC (50°C, 5 min), and 500 μl 0.2 ×
SSC (35°C, 5 min). Vacant binding sites of the microarray
were blocked by incubation with a 2% solution of Blocking Reagent (Roche) in hybridization buffer at 30°C for
15 min. Subsequently, the AT was incubated with 100 μl
of a 1:5000 dilution (0.5 μg/ml) of streptavidin-peroxidase polymer (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) at
30°C for 15 min followed by three wash steps, i.e. 500 μl
2 × SSC/0.01% Triton X-100 (30°C, 5 min), 500 μl 2 ×
SSC (20°C, 5 min), 500 μl 0.2 × SSC (20°C, 5 min).

Finally, 100 μl of the peroxidase substrate Seramun Grün
(Seramun Diagnostica, Heidesee, Germany) were added.
Hybridization signals were measured using an ATR-01
transmission reader (Clondiag) and processed using the
Iconoclust software, version 2.3 (Clondiag).

M the average intensity of the spot, and BG the intensity
of the local background. Values range from 0 (no signal)
to 1 (strong signal).
PCR-RFLP genotyping
Extracted DNA was amplified by PCR using primers CTU/
CTL, and the product was subjected to restriction enzyme
digestion using AluI and MboII as described by Sayada et
al. [8]. Following agarose gel electrophoresis, cleavage
patterns were compared with those of the reference strains
for genotypes A, B, C, D, E and F.
