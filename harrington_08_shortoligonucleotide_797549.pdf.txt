Abstract
Background: The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains a diverse collection of bacteria, most of
which are unculturable by conventional microbiological methods. Increasingly molecular profiling
techniques are being employed to examine this complex microbial community. The purpose of this study
was to develop a microarray technique based on 16S ribosomal gene sequences for rapidly monitoring the
microbial population of the GI tract.
Results: We have developed a culture-independent, semi-quantitative, rapid method for detection of gut
bacterial populations based on 16S rDNA probes using a DNA microarray. We compared the
performance of microarrays based on long (40- and 50-mer) and short (16–21-mer) oligonucleotides.
Short oligonucleotides consistently gave higher specificity. Optimal DNA amplification and labelling,
hybridisation and washing conditions were determined using a probe with an increasing number of
nucleotide mismatches, identifying the minimum number of nucleotides needed to distinguish between
perfect and mismatch probes. An independent PCR-based control was used to normalise different
hybridisation results, and to make comparisons between different samples, greatly improving the detection
of changes in the gut bacterial population. The sensitivity of the microarray was determined to be 8.8 ×
104 bacterial cells g-1 faecal sample, which is more sensitive than a number of existing profiling methods.
The short oligonucleotide microarray was used to compare the faecal flora from healthy individuals and a
patient suffering from Ulcerative Colitis (UC) during the active and remission states. Differences were
identified in the bacterial profiles between healthy individuals and a UC patient. These variations were
verified by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing.
Conclusion: In this study we demonstrate the design, testing and application of a highly sensitive, short
oligonucleotide community microarray. Our approach allows the rapid discrimination of bacteria
inhabiting the human GI tract, at taxonomic levels ranging from species to the superkingdom bacteria. The
optimised protocol is available at: http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/microarrays/#protocols. It offers a high
throughput method for studying the dynamics of the bacterial population over time and between
individuals.

Background
The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains a complex
community of bacteria with up to 1 × 1012 bacteria per
gram of luminal contents [1]. Currently, the function of
GI tract bacteria in the maintenance of human health and
in some disease states is generating intense interest. The
microbiota is known to stimulate the immune system,
produce vitamins and short chain fatty acids, help the
digestive process and is involved in preventing colonisation by potentially pathogenic bacteria. It is estimated that
there may be as many as 1000 different bacterial species
within the human GI tract [2]. One of the main barriers to
the progress of research in this area is the unculturable
nature of many GI tract bacteria. However in the last decade, culture independent molecular profiling methods
have been developed. Many of these methods are based
on the 16S ribosomal gene which contains highly conserved nucleotides across all bacterial species, interspersed
with regions of sequences which are variable. Such methods include Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis
(DGGE) [3,4], Fluorescence in situ Hybridisation (FISH)
[4,5] and cloning and sequencing of 16S ribosomal gene
libraries [6]. While these methods have proven extremely
valuable, they are limited by the number of samples that
can be analysed and the time taken to process them.
DNA microarray technology is a potentially powerful tool
for rapid high throughput detection of thousands of 16S
ribosomal gene sequences and the provision of a profile
of microbial communities. One of the first described uses
of microarrays for detecting genes in an environmental
sample was the construction of an oligonucleotide microchip to identify key bacteria of the nitrifying genera [7].
DNA microarrays have also been developed to identify
selected bacteria from other environmental niches [8-11]
and to detect bacterial strains from the human gut
[12,13]. However the human gut microarray studies were
only able to detect a limited number of species and did
not provide information about the relative amounts of
bacteria found in different individuals. A diversity microarray consisting of 40-mer probes has been developed,
tested and optimised to detect a range of bacterial taxonomic hierarchies. This was used to study the adult
human GI tract [14] and to monitor the development of
the human infant intestinal microbiota [15].
Here we report the development and validation of a DNA
based microarray that uses 230 shorter 16S ribosomal
DNA gene-based probes, mainly 16–21-mer in length.
Our approach allows the rapid detection of a large range
of gut bacteria at various taxonomic hierarchies.

Local Research Ethical Committee (Ref 06-Q0102-91).
PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal genes
PCR products were amplified from either 5 ng faecal
genomic DNA or 5 ng pure bacterial culture genomic
DNA, using the Amp F and Amp R primers (Table 2).
These primers generated a product of approximately 1.5
kb length from the genomic DNA templates. As an internal positive control, 10 pg of purified Thermus thermophilus genomic DNA was added to each 50 μl reaction.
Reaction tubes contained 10 μl Phusion HF buffer
(Finnzymes, Finland), 200 μM dNTPs (Bioline, UK), 0.5
μM each primer, 0.5 U of Phusion DNA polymerase
(Finnzymes, Finland), 5 ng genomic DNA and deionised
water (dH2O) to 50 μl. The initial DNA denaturation step
was performed at 96°C for 4 min using a PCR sprint thermocycler (Hybaid, UK), followed by 15 cycles of 96°C for
1 min, 53°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min 10 s. A final
step of 72°C for 4 min completed the reaction. PCR products were purified using a Wizard PCR Purification Kit
(Promega Corporation, WI, USA) and eluted with 50 μl of
dH2O.
PCR detection of Enterobacteriaceae and bifidobacteria
Enterobacteriaceae (ENT183 and 424R) and bifidobacteria (InfL6 and Bif662-r) primer sequences used to determine the comparative nature of the microarray are listed
in Table 2. Reaction tubes contained 5 μl 10 × PCR buffer

(Amersham Biosciences, UK), 200 μM dNTPs (Bioline,
UK), 0.5 μM of either ENT183 and 424R or InfL6 and
Bif662-r, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences, UK), 5 ng faecal genomic DNA, and dH2O to 50
μl. PCR conditions for Enterobacteriaceae were: one cycle
at 96°C for 4 min, followed by five step increments
between 20 and 45 cycles of 96°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 30 s. PCR conditions for bifidobacteria were
one cycle at 96°C for 4 min, followed by 5 cycle advancements between 20 and 45 cycles of 96°C for 35 s, 57°C
for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. The analysis of gel images
obtained after running the PCR products on 1.5% agarose
gels was performed using the Phoretix V5.20 software
(NonLinear Dynamics Limited, UK).
DGGE analysis of faecal DNA
The variable V6-V8 region of 16S ribosomal gene was
amplified from faecal DNA using primers F-968 and R1401 and V3 region using F-341 and R-534 (Table 2). The
reaction mixture contained 5 μl 10 × HotMaster buffer
(Eppendorf, Germany), 200 μM dNTPs (Bioline, UK), 20
pmol each primer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 U HotMaster
polymerase (Eppendorf, Germany), 100 ng template
DNA and dH2O to 50 μl. Reactions were carried out in a
PCR machine (Hybaid, UK) with an initial denaturation
cycle of 94°C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for
20 s, 58°C for 10 s, 65°C for 20 s with a final extension at
65°C for 5 min. PCR products were verified by gel electrophoresis for single band products. DGGE analysis was per-

formed using the Ingeny PhorU-2 electrophoresis system
according to manufacturer's instructions (Ingeny International BV, The Netherlands), using 8% polyacrylamide
gels containing a gradient of 40–60% urea and formamide as denaturants. A solution of 100% denaturant is
defined as 40% vol/vol formamide and 7.0 M urea. PCR
amplicons were separated by electrophoresis at 80 V for
17 h and stained with SYBR Green (Molecular Probes)
(1:10000 in 0.5 × TAE). Gels were viewed on a Dark
Reader (Clare Chemicals, Colorado, USA) and photographed using DigiDoc software (Alpha Innotech, California, USA).
Sequencing of DGGE bands
Bands of interest were excised and soaked in 50 μl dH2O
to elute the DNA. Two microlitres of this sample was used
as template to reamplify the DNA fragment. The PCR reaction used the same HotMaster polymerase procedure as
described for the DGGE, except that the forward primer
lacked a GC clamp. PCR products were purified using a
Wizard PCR Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, WI,
USA) and the DNA sequenced with BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Corporation) using the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence matches were identified using BLASTn
[16] at the NCBI BLASTn website [17] during April 2008.
Design of microarray probes
The overall strategy was to design probes covering the
major bacterial groups and dominant species present in
the human GI tract, identified using both traditional culture based methods and molecular techniques [6,18-20].
Whenever possible, we designed at least two different
probes for the same bacterium to confirm probe specificity. Probes were aimed to cover as wide a range of taxonomic hierarchy as possible. The selection of strains
chosen for oligonucleotide design were based on their
availability in a culture collection and access to their complete, or near-complete (1,000 bp or greater) 16S ribosomal gene sequence. Bacterial 16S ribosomal gene
sequences were obtained via the NCBI Entrez-nucleotide
website [21], the Ribosome Data Project 8.1 website
[22,23] or from in-house sequencing.

Initially Array Designer 2.0 (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, USA) was used to help create pilot
microarrays to test optimum probe length, which consisted of 50-mer probes (see additional file 1), 40-mer
probes (see additional file 2) and short nucleotide probes
(mainly 16–21-mer) (see additional file 3). As well as specific bacterial oligonucleotides, random probes not
expected to bind to any 16S ribosomal gene sequences
were included in all three design platforms. Before experimental probe specificity testing, the probe sequences
were checked for predicted specificity at the NCBI BLASTn

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/195

website [17]. To perform this analysis, the low complexity
filter was removed before submitting sequences to the
BLASTn search. Short length oligonucleotides were also
designed to determine the hybridisation and washing
temperatures further, with zero, one and two base pair
mismatches against a bacterial strain. These mismatch
probes were designed by obtaining as many bifidobacterial 16S ribosomal gene sequences at the NCBI website
[21] as possible, together with the E. coli 16S ribosomal
gene for referencing nucleotide position. These were
aligned using the GeneDoc software [24], to identify
regions of nucleotide variation and similarity. The alignment was subsequently used to find areas where single
and duplicate mismatches occurred. A 15 nt dTTP spacer
was added to the 5' end of the short length oligonucleotides to allow labelled DNA to bind more easily to the
probe. The terminal 5' dTTP was amino-modified so the
oligonucleotide could be chemically coupled to the
microarray glass slide.
Specificity testing with genomic DNA from 17 pure bacterial cultures (Table 1) was initially used to evaluate performance of the three probe length variations (50-, 40mer and short oligonucleotides). Specificity was defined
as the total number of probes generating expected signals
only when their corresponding 16S ribosomal gene was
individually hybridised, divided by the total number of
probes on the microarray. We confirmed the optimum
hybridisation and washing temperatures through DNA
melting curves. Following a successful trial of the 52 short
nucleotide probes (see additional file 3), an expanded
microarray was developed that contained 230 short
probes (see additional file 4). This wide range of oligonucleotides was predicted with the Array Designer 2.0 software, identified via a literature search and from the
probeBase website [25,26]. They are categorised into the
following phylogenetic hierarchies: two universal, six
phylum, three class, ten order, two family, seventeen
genus and one hundred and sixty-two species. There were
also sixteen probes covering clusters of bacteria and
twelve controls.
Printing of microarray probes
Oligonucleotide probes for microarray printing were purchased from Operon (Operon Biotechnologies, Cologne,
Germany) and adjusted to 50 pmol μl-1 in Quantifoil 1×
spotting solution III (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena,
Germany). Probes were printed onto epoxysilane coated
glass slides (Schott Nexterion, Germany) in duplicate
using a Stanford Style microarray spotter [27]. Each probe
spot size was 100 μm when printed.

Epoxysilane coated glass slides were processed immediately prior to use. The slides were washed for 5 min in
0.1% Triton X-100 followed by two washes in 14 N HCl

(Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) pH 4.0, for 2 min. The slides
were placed in 100 mM KCl for 10 min, washed twice in
Milli-Q water for 1 min and immersed in blocking solution (50 mM ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) in
0.1 M Tris pH 9.0 at 50°C) for 15 min. Slides were transferred to a fresh solution of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min
and washed in 2× SSC, 0.2× SSC and Milli-Q water, each
for 5 min. The slides were spun dry at 290 × g for 10 min,
and then stored in the dark at room temperature until
required. Slides were agitated at 250 rpm during all the
steps and were not allowed to dry. All solutions were
made with Milli-Q water.

merged into 1 litre of wash solution containing 2× SSC
and 0.1% SDS, and then gently shaken for 5 min. Several
wash temperatures were tested, ranging from 65°C to
72°C for 40- and 50-mer probes and between 55°C and
66°C for shorter probes. Slides were gently agitated and
racks transferred to a solution of 1× SSC and shaken at
room temperature for 5 min at 250 rpm. This step was
repeated once. Slides were then washed twice as described
above in 0.2× SSC for 5 min and then spun dry at 290 × g
for 5 min at room temperature. This optimised protocol is
available at: http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/microarrays/
#protocols.

Fluorescence labelling of 16S ribosomal gene PCR
fragments
Purified aliquots (2 ng) of 16S ribosomal gene PCR products obtained using Amp F and Amp R primers from pure
bacterial cultures, or 200 ng of purified PCR product from
the amplification of 16S ribosomal genes from faecal
genomic DNA, were used as template for synthesis of Cydye labelled DNA products. The reaction contained 20 μl
of 2.5 × random primer/reaction buffer mix from the
Gibco Bioprime DNA labelling System (Invitrogen, UK).
The solutions were heated for 5 min and then cooled on
ice for 5 min. Subsequently 5 μl of 10 × dNTP mix (1.2
mM each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP; 0.6 mM dCTP; 10 mM Tris
pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0), 3 μl of 1 mM Cy5 dCTP or
Cy3 dCTP (Amersham Biosciences, UK) and 1 μl of Klenow enzyme were added. The labelling reactions were
incubated at 37°C for 5 h. The Cy3 and Cy5 reactions
were combined where appropriate, and a Qia-quick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen Ltd., UK) used to remove unincorporated Cy-dyes.

Scanning of microarray slides and data analysis
Slides were scanned using an Axon Genepix 4000A microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc., California) with a
scanning resolution of 5 μm. Image analysis was performed using Genepix Pro Version 5.0 (Axon Instruments,
Inc., California). The data from Genepix were then
exported to Excel for further processing. Microarray data
analysis was carried out as follows: The local background
signal was subtracted from the hybridisation signal of
each separate spot; all values below ten were converted to
ten to avoid negative values and the average of replicate
spots was taken. The average signal obtained for the negative control spots was deducted from all replicate spot values. Any resulting negative number was made positive by
converting to ten, which enabled further data analysis.
Ten was chosen because this value would be far below the
threshold of detection and would also not compromise
further data analysis. Each spot was then divided by the
total of all spots for the corresponding replicate. When
comparing results from human faecal samples, the value
from each spot was then divided by the average of all the
thermophile reference spots obtained from the previous
calculation. The resulting number represented the level of
binding to a particular oligonucleotide which corresponded to a particular type or group of bacteria. At least
two further microarray replicates were carried out to
obtain the final average level of spot binding. Spots for
which the average normalised binding intensity was equal
to, or greater than 0.1, were considered to be positive. Ttests were performed to confirm significant differences
between two samples.

Hybridisation and washing of epoxysilane coated glass
slides
First, 10 μl of concentrated labelling solution was added
to a mastermix of 1.5 μl 50× Denhardts solution, 2.25 μl
of 20× SSC, 1.125 μl of E. coli tRNA (10 μg μl-1) and 0.375
μl of 1 M HEPES, pH 7.0. Then, 10% SDS (0.375 μl) was
applied to the mixture and incubated at 100°C for 2 min.
The mix was left to stand at room temperature for 5 min,
centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant
transferred to a fresh tube. The microarray slide was
placed in a hybridisation chamber (GeneMachines, CA,
USA), labelling solution applied over the microarrays and
a glass coverslip gently lowered on top of the solution to
prevent it drying out. The slides were preheated on a hot
block at 70°C for 30 min. Hybridisations were incubated
for 15 h at 62°C, 63°C or 67°C for 40- and 50-mer probes
and for short probes, temperatures between 55°C and
58°C were used.

The slides were placed in a slide transfer rack for movement between different washes and then directly sub-

Minimum detection limits
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 cells
were used to establish the sensitivity of the designed
microarray. Cells were grown to an OD600 of 1.0 which
corresponds to 8.8 × 108 cells ml-1. The culture was diluted
in sterile PBS (8 gl-1 NaCl, 0.2 gl-1 KCl, 1.44 gl-1 Na2PO4
and 0.24 gl-1 KH2PO4 adjusted to pH 7.4) to provide a cell
density in the range of 8.8 × 108 to 8.8 × 103 cells per ml.
The dilutions were mixed with 1 g of fresh faecal sample
and the DNA was subsequently extracted from 0.4 g of

this mix. Furthermore, the serial dilutions were plated
onto XLD plates (Oxoid, UK) containing 100 μg ml-1
streptomycin in order to estimate the initial numbers of
viable bacteria. The extracted genomic DNA from the S.
Typhimurium spiked faecal samples was used as template
for PCR. In the subsequent microarray experiments, the
detection limit of the SAL455 probe was determined.
Microarray data
The microarray dataset has been deposited in the ArrayExpress database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress, accession number: E-MEXP-1395.

Results
Probe design, phylogeny and specificity
A series of experiments with different hybridisation conditions were conducted, to examine the performance of
microarrays with different probe lengths for detection of
faecal bacteria. For microarrays with 50-mer probes (see
additional file 1) and 40-mer probes (see additional file
2), we tested both hybridisation and washing temperatures ranging from 62°C to 72°C. A hybridisation temperature of 65°C combined with a first wash temperature of
72°C gave the best combination of signal intensity and
specificity (see additional files 1 and 2). However, the
level of specificity was variable. For most 50-mer probes
tested with individually labelled 16S ribosomal genes
from the seventeen reference strains (Table 1), the specificity ranged between order to species level, even though
the probes were mainly designed to be specific at the
genus or species level. A minority of the 50-mer probes
were totally non-specific. The use of 40-mer oligonucleotide microarrays improved specificity whilst giving taxonomic discrimination at a range of hierarchies. We
determined whether the addition of formamide to the
hybridisation solution improved fidelity, as this has been
reported to improve specificity [28]. Although the addition of formamide resulted in a general increase in signal
intensity, the specificity was in fact reduced (unpublished
data).

A short oligonucleotide (16-21-mer) pilot microarray
with 52 probes was used to investigate the effectiveness of
shorter probes. The validity of probes in the short pilot
microarray were first assessed by hybridising them against
individually labelled 16S ribosomal genes amplified from
pure cultures (Table 1) of the corresponding bacterial species, at various hybridisation and washing temperatures.
In general, specificity was achieved at either the species or
genus level (see additional file 3). The binding efficiency
of a target was highly dependent on the probe with some,
such as B. angulatum and B. pseud & catenulatum, giving
very low signals. After analysis of the specificity data, a
cut-off value of 0.1 was defined as showing the presence
of a specific bacterium, since below this value non-specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/195

signals were obtained when DNA from pure cultures were
tested. In general, the binding intensity (i.e. fluorescent
signal) of all the short oligonucleotides was lower than
the longer oligonucleotides. Nevertheless, the short oligonucleotides offered more accurate discrimination
between various bacterial taxonomic hierarchies. When
comparing the experimental microarray-based data versus
the BLASTn predicted specificity, the short probes showed
84% specificity, whereas the longer probes were less specific: 66% for 50-mer probes (see additional file 1) and
75% for 40-mer probes (see additional file 2).
In order to confirm the optimal hybridisation and washing conditions for the short probes, we performed DNA
melting curves. The labelled 16S ribosomal gene from a
pure culture of Bifidobacterium longum was hybridised to
the corresponding probes containing 0, 1 or 2 nt mismatches. This established that hybridisation at 58°C gave
the best discrimination (unpublished data). A range of
washing temperatures were examined and again confirmed that 58°C was most selective for hybridisation
(Figure 1 and Figure 2). As with the pure culture specificity
testing, hybridisations and washes at higher temperatures
resulted in greater specificity, but the intensity of the specific signal was reduced leading to increased noise.
To summarise, although short oligonucleotides generally
gave lower signals than long oligonucleotides, their
increased specificity facilitated a more accurate discrimination of bacterial groups at various taxonomic hierarchies. These findings were used to optimise the design of
a community microarray which contained 230 short oligonucleotides (see additional file 4) that were used for
analysis of human faecal samples.
PCR amplification of faecal genomic DNA
For the purpose of diminishing the chance of PCR generated mismatches, high fidelity Phusion polymerase was
used to amplify faecal genomic DNA by PCR. In order to
minimise PCR amplification bias, only 15 PCR cycles
were carried out. It has been reported that a 10 cycle PCR
detects the greatest diversity of bacterial species [29], but
15 cycles were necessary to generate a 1.5 kb band that
was visible in an agarose gel. This amplification procedure
should help to maximise the accuracy of microarray data,
since the DNA sequences and the proportions of 16S
ribosomal genes obtained will have undergone minimal
changes during PCR.
Design of the internal standard
The short oligonucleotide community microarray incorporated an independent PCR amplification control step.
For GI tract profiling, this was a novel approach which
allowed all experiments to share a fixed reference point
facilitating the comparison of data from any investigation.

(l) after hybridisation with fluorescently labelled 16S ribosomal DNA PCR products from Bifidobacterium longum. The error
bars represent the standard deviation.

For all hybridisations, the spot binding intensity from
Thermus thermophilus 16S ribosomal genes was used as the
control to normalise the data. T. thermophilus genomic
DNA (10 pg) was amplified in the same 50 μl PCR reaction as each faecal genomic DNA template. The T. thermophilus DNA did not hybridise to any other spots on the
microarray. This control spike allowed all data from replicate experiments to be normalised prior to comparison
between samples from the same or different individuals.
This novel approach enabled correlations of bacterial levels from separate experiments to be explored, providing
useful information on gut bacterial diversity.
Determination of the detection limit
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 was used to
establish the sensitivity of the short oligonucleotide community microarray. Absence of S. Typhimurium in a faecal
sample was initially confirmed by plating. Subsequently
the sample was spiked with various concentrations of S.
Typhimurium cells prior to DNA extraction. The presence
of S. Typhimurium at the correct levels in the spiked samples was confirmed by viable cell counts on XLD agar
plates (unpublished data). The SAL455 probe detected S.

Typhimurium in all samples which contained greater than
8.8 × 103 cells ml-1 (P < 0.05) (Figure 3). This detection
limit is impressively low when compared to the total gut
bacterial population of 1 × 1012 to 1 × 1013 cells g-1.
Profiling of microarray signals from human samples
The short oligonucleotide microarray was used to determine microbial diversity within faecal samples from three
healthy individuals, designated A, B and C (Table 3; Additional file 5). A hybridisation signal was recorded from
ninety-four probes. Labelled DNA from all three individuals hybridised to the B. longum group and B. bifidum
probes, indicating the presence of these organisms in the
samples. The highest levels were recorded from individual
A. Various representatives of the 'bacteroides' group were
successfully identified by the microarray. Four different
probes with specificity for B. putredinis DNA displayed the
highest intensity in sample A. B. thetaiotaomicron and B.
ovatus were also present in all three faecal samples. B. vulgatus was detected by the B. vulgatus1 & 2 probes. The levels of these bacteria among individuals varied for the two
oligonucleotides, probably because the B. vulgatus1 probe
had specificity to more uncultured microorganisms

between 55°C and 66°C. Perfect match probe intensity at each different temperature was then divided either by the 1 nt or 2
nt corresponding mismatch binding, and error bars represent the standard error.

(according to BLASTn predictions). The presence of B.
merdae, B. stercoris and Flexibacter spp. was identified in
some samples (see additional file 5).
A number of clostridial species were detected in all faecal
samples. Individual A had the highest levels of clostridia
belonging to Clusters XIVab and IV. The members of Cluster XIVa that were detected included Clostridium coccoides,
C. clostridiformes1, C. nexile and C. symbiosum. Bacteria
identified belonging to Cluster IV, the second major dominant clostridial group, included Clostridium leptum, C.
butyricium and C. paraputrificum. The Cluster III probe
revealed that some bacteria belonging to this group were
present in all samples.
Eubacteria were also identified, with most belonging to
Cluster XIVa. E. rectale was represented by two E. rectale
probes and both showed that individual A had the greatest number of this bacterium. E. ventriosum and E. halii
were also detected in all three samples. Enterobacteriaceae
were recorded from all three volunteers with individuals B
and C having the greatest amount and A the least. Ruminococci probes detected members of this genus including

R. lactaris and R. torques from Cluster XIVa and R. albus, R.
bromii, R. flavefaciens plus R. callidus and from Cluster IV.
Each Ruminococci probe produced different profiles for
the three individuals.
Streptococci were identified, with individual A showing
the highest level. There were three Streptococci probes
specific for different species, however each individual's
profile from these three probes were similar, indicating
that the oligonucleotides may only give specificity to the
genus level for this bacterial group. Members of the Verrucomicrobiales were present in high numbers in samples B
and C. The T. thermophilus levels were consistent throughout and as expected, the negative controls produced no
significant binding. The microarray data identified a
diverse bacterial community inhabiting the GI tract of the
three healthy individuals, and showed that the relative
composition of the population is host specific.

The short oligonucleotide community microarray was
used to investigate the bacterial community of a patient

no spike.

One sample was taken whilst the patient was suffering
from a relapse, and the second six months later during
remission. The results indicated a significant difference in
the bacterial community from this single individual at
two distinct times, and under different circumstances.
One of the most noticeable changes in the population
during the active disease phase, compared to remission,
was the elevated levels of bacteria belonging to Clostridia
clusters IV and XIV, particularly E. biforme, E. rectale and
the E. cylindroides Clusters. Other Clostridia such as
Clostridium Cluster I revealed no significant differences
between samples taken during the active disease phase
and remission. Of the ruminococci, only the R. flavefaciens
and R. albus & R. flavefaciens2 probes demonstrated large
increases during the active state. The Roseburia intestinalis
sub-cluster exhibited a 6.2-fold elevation in intensity,
while Rumin-Eubac-Clost Cluster levels increased by 1.9fold, the difference probably reflecting the broader specificity of the latter probe. During the disease state, Enterobacteriaceae and the Bifidobacterium longum group were
more abundant.

In addition to recording specific bacterial probes or
groups of bacterial probes increased in the active disease
phase compared to remission, other probes showed lower
intensities in the active disease phase when compared to
remission. In the case of 'Bacteroides', levels were reduced
more than 10-fold for some species. The greatest reduction in a single probe representing a bacterium was Prevotella enoeca2 where a 22-fold lower level was observed. At
both time points, there were some probes (F. prausnitzii,
Lactobacillales, the Veillonella genus and the universal oligonucleotides), where no significant differences were
observed between the two states.
The varying intensities of microarray signals reflect gross
levels of bacteria in faecal DNA from three healthy
individuals
A comparative PCR approach was used to determine
whether the different normalised microarray signal intensities from the three healthy volunteers reflected their true
abundance in the faecal genomic DNA. The PCR used one
primer with the same sequence as the B. longum group3

microarray probe and a second primer also specific to B.
longum (Table 2). Comparison of the microarray and PCR
data (Figure 5A) confirmed that individual A had significantly higher levels of B. longum, and that individual C
had the lowest levels of this bacterium (P < 0.05).
To further evaluate whether microarray data were valid, a
second PCR of human faecal DNA was performed using a
forward primer the same sequence as the
Enterobacteriaceae1 probe (Figure 5B) and second primer
specific to Enterobacteriaceae (Table 2). Relative values
obtained showed identical trends in the two techniques.
In contrast to the B. longum results, individual B had the
highest signal and A the lowest. All PCR amplification
profiles were significantly different from each other and
the microarray data exhibited a significant difference
between individuals A and B (P < 0.05). The microarray
method was unable to significantly distinguish between C
and A (P > 0.05), although the same trend, as observed in
the PCR results, was apparent. This suggests that the
microarray analysis discriminates effectively between
large variations in bacterial numbers among samples.
With further replicates, smaller differences between the
levels of bacterial 16S ribosomal genes that bind to the
same probe may also be distinguished.
Comparison of microarray data with results from
Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE)
DGGE is a genetic fingerprinting technique that separates
DNA on the basis of sequence variation into distinct

bands on a gel. The identity of the bacterial species associated with individual bands can be determined by the purification and sequencing of selected bands. This molecular
technique was used to profile the faecal microbiota from
the three healthy individuals and the UC patient during
both disease and remission phases. Using this approach
provided a comparison of data from the short oligonucleotide microarray with those from an established molecular profiling method.
Comparison of data from healthy individuals
Primers targeting the V6-V8 region of the 16S ribosomal
gene, were used to amplify a DNA fragment from the total
microbial community DNA in the three healthy individuals' samples used for microarray analysis. A large proportion of the DGGE bands in figures 6A and 6B were picked
and the identity of those which were successfully PCR
amplified and sequenced are shown in Tables 4 and 5. Six
bands were clearly identified as being derived from specific known organisms (Figure 6A; Table 4). Both the
microarray data and the DGGE showed that individuals B
and C carried Akkermansia muciniphila, a member of the
Verrucomicrobiales (Table 4, band 1). A band corresponding to this organism was absent in individual A,
consistent with the very low levels revealed using the
microarray. Eubacterium rectale was present at the highest
level in individual A according to the microarray data.
This was confirmed by DGGE, with a band in sample A
identified as E. rectale (Table 4, band 12). Signals from the
microarray indicated the low abundance of this organism

in samples B and C and a DGGE band representing this
organism was absent in samples from these individuals.
The DGGE band that closely matched R. faecalis (Table 4,
band 4), could not be directly related to the microarray
data as there was no unique probe for this organism.
Further experiments comparing DGGE results with the
microarray data were carried out using primers targeting
the V3 region of the 16S ribosomal gene. From a total of
ten bands sequenced, four corresponded to Bacteroides,
while many had highest sequence homologies to
unknown bacteria (Figure 6B; Table 5). The Bacteroides
species identified did not have corresponding species-specific probes on the microarray. A B. fragilis group oligonucleotide, which included specificity to B. fragilis, B.

thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. eggerthii and B. uniformis was present, and both the microarray and the
DGGE results suggest that individual B has lower levels of
bacteria from this group. The DGGE recorded the presence of a member of the Desulfovibrio genus in individual B (Table 5, band 6), but this result cannot be directly
compared to microarray data since the microarray only
had probes targeted for D. piger.
Comparison of data using the two samples from the UC patient
A similar DGGE analysis and comparison with the microarray data was undertaken for the two samples obtained
from the UC patient during the disease and remission
states (Figure 6A; Figure 6B; Table 4; Table 5). Sequence

V8 region was identified as E. rectale (Figure 6A; Table 4).
This band was only detected during the active disease
state. Similarly, the microarray data indicated that E. rectale was present in considerably higher levels in the active
disease phase (up to 7.2-fold increase) when compared
with remission. The fact that DGGE did not reveal an
equivalent E. rectale band in the remission sample probably reflects the relatively low sensitivity of this molecular
profiling method. Another DGGE band was identified as
Bifidobacterium longum and had elevated levels in the diseased state. Again this is consistent with data derived from
the microarray analysis. Interestingly, two of the DGGE
bands corresponding to unidentified bacteria most closely

matched 16S ribosomal gene sequences previously
detected in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (Figure 6A;
Table 4, bands 14 and 19).
DGGE separation of the V3 region of the 16S ribosomal
gene and the sequencing of selected bands revealed the
presence of 'Bacteroides' species (Figure 6B; Table 5). B.
fragilis and B. vulgatus bands that were detected in the
healthy individuals were absent in the case of the UC
patient. Very similar results were obtained using the
microarray, especially for the active disease state sample.
However, only the microarray analysis revealed that levels
of 'Bacteroides' species appeared to recover during remis-

sion. This difference probably reflects the greater sensitivity of the microarray-based approach. In summary, we
have shown there is a close correlation of results between
the microarray and DGGE technique when studying the
faecal bacterial population from three healthy individuals
and a patient with UC.

Discussion
In this study we have developed a short oligonucleotide
community DNA microarray for the detection of members of the human gut microbiota. Using this microarray
we identified differences within the GI tract bacterial com-

97

munity from healthy and diseased individuals. Data sets
were validated by analysis of the same samples using
DGGE and PCR.
Initially, 50-mer probes were tested and generally a 10%
sequence divergence was required to distinguish between
specific and non-specific hybridisation. Typically, when
stringent hybridisation and washing temperatures were
employed, a 4 nt difference was sufficient to differentiate
between genera but not species. For example, the Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum probe (BPSE1438) with 4 nt
difference to most other bifidobacterial 16S ribosomal

DNA genes, could not differentiate at the species level.
This was also true for the Bacteroides vulgatus probe
(BVUL1146) to Bacteroides fragilis 16S ribosomal DNA.
For 40-mer probes, a higher specificity was obtained with
as little as a single base difference required for species discrimination (for example the B. longum probe BLON451
to other bifidobacterial 16S ribosomal DNA genes),
although most probes required at least a 3 nt difference.
Previous reports have suggested that probes with large
numbers of mismatches or internal single nucleotide mismatches, exhibited higher specificities compared to mismatches in the first or last nucleotide of the probe [30].
Furthermore, avoiding runs of complementary nucleotides of 10–16 nt also increases specificity [31]. These
points were used in the design of both short and long oligonucleotide probes in our study.
Shorter oligonucleotides (16–21-mer) were also evaluated. Initially these probes were designed to be a uniform

length, as used in an earlier study [32], but this approach
was unsuccessful due to the large number of GI tract
microorganisms with similar 16S ribosomal gene
sequences. Instead, a compromise was made whereby a
47°C–52°C nearest neighbour melting temperature was
selected. In this case the minimum difference required to
distinguish bacteria was 1 nt. For example the B. angulatum 16S ribosomal gene product did not cross-hybridise
to the B. adolescentis probe, and this differentiation was
comparable to the result of an earlier study [33]. However,
a 2 nt difference was preferred as some probes selected for
differentiation between species with a single 1 nt difference only showed family level specificity.
Hybridisation of the 16S ribosomal gene PCR product
from 17 bacterial reference strains revealed that 84% of
oligonucleotides showed the predicted binding pattern.
As with other studies, the shorter length probes showed
higher specificity [34], but a much reduced signal strength

compared to longer oligonucleotides [30]. Lower specificity of the longer probes results from the higher melting
temperature probes (i.e. generally those with longer
nucleotide lengths) which are capable of capturing nonspecific targets, mainly due to their stronger affinities arising from the greater number of guanine and cytosine
bases in their sequences [35]. Shorter probes show a
higher specificity because less opportunity exists for nonspecific binding as a result of their reduced length and
lower melting temperature. Our short probes offered the
optimum choice for profiling the human GI tract community because less point mutations were required to achieve
the same or greater differentiation between bacterial

groups/species compared to 50- and 40-mer probes. The
final selection of our probes reflected a trade-off between
signal strength and fidelity. A cut-off value of 0.1 was
defined using pure culture bacterial DNA, below which
non-specific signals were generated. A similar approach
was developed for a study designed to detect sulphate
reducing prokaryotes [32]. T. thermophilus DNA was used
as an independent control to normalise data. Adding T.
thermophilus genomic DNA did not interfere with the PCR
amplification of bacterial 16S ribosomal genes from the
faecal genomic DNA. This was confirmed by DGGE analysis of the same faecal sample with or without a thermophile spike using DGGE primers targeting variable

region V6-V8 (unpublished data). This independent control offers a novel way to normalise gut profiling data and
allowed multiple experiments from different samples to
be compared.
Using the optimised microarray protocol, the detection
limit for the microarray is 8.8 × 104 bacteria per gram of
faecal sample (Figure 3) from a total population of
around 1 × 1013 bacteria per gram of faecal contents. This
is a very low detection limit showing greater sensitivity
than other techniques applied to the profiling of microbial communities. For example, DGGE can only detect
bacteria constituting more than 1% of the complete community and in the case of FISH the detection level is
around 1.0 × 106 cells [36]. Our detection limit is similar
to that reported for another oligonucleotide microarray
that has been designed to study the microbial community
of compost [37]. A good example of the differences in sensitivity in our study was the comparison of E. rectale levels
in the UC patient using DGGE and the community microarray. A similar combination of DGGE and microarray
profiling has been used by other authors with equal effectiveness [38,39]. The DGGE data confirms that the microarray probes for Verrucomicrobiales, E. rectale and B.
longum were specific. Analysis of the microarray and comparative PCR results indicated that the microarray binding
intensity showed very similar trends to the amplification
profile of the corresponding PCR, when using the same
sequence microarray probe as one of the PCR primers.
The optimised microarray procedure revealed differences
in the types and levels of bacteria present in faecal samples
from three healthy individuals. Data were generated for
Bacteroides, Eubacteria, Bifidobacteria, Clostridia, Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacilli, Ruminococci, Streptococci and
Verrucomicrobiales, all of which have previously been
identified in the human GI tract [6,40-42]. These findings,
together with validation and cross-referencing using other
molecular approaches, confirmed that our procedure can
be accurately used to study the GI tract microbiota. Further development, including the incorporation of additional specific probes, will enhance the use of this
microarray. One area where the coverage could be
improved is in the detection of bacteria such as Porphyromonas and Prevotella, which were barely recorded in this
study compared to previous findings [43]. This low level
of detection may reflect biases in the extraction of specific
bacterial genomic DNA or limitations associated with the
binding specificity of probes and PCR primers. Data from
the literature indicates that it is not always possible to predict the hybridisation characteristics of oligonucleotide
probes for species discrimination [44]. In this study we
maximised the chances of specificity by avoiding complementary runs of nucleotides, similar to another reported
approach [31].

It is estimated that more than one million Americans have
UC or Crohn's disease (CD), the two most common forms
of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) [45]. The inflammation in the bowel caused by IBD can be debilitating.
Literature suggests the disease may have genetic and
immunological factors, environmental influences and the
possible involvement of indigenous gut microbes [46-49].
In our study, two faecal samples from a UC patient were
taken six months apart. The community microarray
showed significant differences in the levels of Bacteroides,
Eubacteria and sulphate reducing bacteria. The sequencing of DNA bands separated by DGGE broadly confirmed
the microarray results. In this patient, bacterial population levels, especially from species such as Eubacteria,
were different in the disease and remission states. This
suggests that bacterial community instability may be a
cause or it may be a consequence of other factors in the
disease. Two of the biggest differences occurred in the levels of E. rectale and E. biforme. A large reduction in the levels of Bacteroides (and the sole Prevotella probe to give a
signal) in the disease phase was observed when compared
both to the remission phase of the same individual and to
the three healthy individuals. This trend has been identified by others [50]. Sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) have
been suggested as a possible causative agent of UC. However it is not clear whether it is the presence or levels of
these bacteria that is the cause of the disease, or a consequence of it. In one study the counts and carriage rates of
SRB between healthy and diseased individuals showed no
difference [51], while a second found them significantly
higher in IBD patients compared to healthy individuals
[49]. Our investigation also found that Desulfovibrio piger
was significantly higher in both the disease and remission
samples, compared to the samples from the healthy volunteers.

Conclusion
We have developed an oligonucleotide based microarray
for the rapid analysis of the gut bacterial community, giving an alternative means of profiling the human GI tract
bacterial population. We tested different length probes
and discovered that shorter oligonucleotides (16–21mer) showed the greatest specificity. We designed an
expanded short oligonucleotide microarray, comprising
of 230 probes targeting species or groups of GI tract bacteria. This microarray was highly sensitive and detected
less than 8.8 × 104 cells per gram of faecal contents. The
utility of the designed microarray was tested by profiling
gut microbial communities in healthy volunteers as well
as in a UC patient during active and remission states. The
microarray data were confirmed by cross referencing with
other established molecular methods, and showed a
diverse and dynamic community. Further probes will be
added to the microarray, to include new sequences that
have recently become available.
