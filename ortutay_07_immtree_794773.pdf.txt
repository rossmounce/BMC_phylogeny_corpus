Abstract
Background: The immune system, which is a complex machinery, is based on the highly
coordinated expression of a wide array of genes and proteins. The evolutionary history of the
human immune system is not well characterised. Although several studies related to the
development and evolution of immunological processes have been published, a full-scale genomebased analysis is still missing. A database focused on the evolutionary relationships of immune
related genes would contribute to and facilitate research on immunology and evolutionary biology.
Results: An Internet resource called ImmTree http://bioinf.uta.fi/ImmTree was constructed for
studying the evolution and evolutionary trees of the human immune system. ImmTree contains
information about orthologs in 80 species collected from the HomoloGene, OrthoMCL and EGO
databases. In addition to phylogenetic trees, the service provides data for the comparison of
human-mouse ortholog pairs, including synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates, Z values,
and Ka/Ks quotients. A versatile search engine allows complex queries from the database.
Currently, data is available for 847 human immune system related genes and proteins.
Conclusion: ImmTree provides a unique data set of genes and proteins from the human immune
system, their phylogenetics, and information for comparisons of human-mouse ortholog pairs,
synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates, as well as other statistical information.

Background
The immune system is a very complex machinery thet has
evolved and diversified over time. Numerous processes
are necessary for mounting adaptive and innate immune
responses to protect an individual from invading organisms and molecules. Acquired and congenital problems in
almost any part of the immune system can lead to diseases, many of which are very severe or even life threatening. The different processes and pathways of the immune
system have evolved gradually and become increasingly
complex. More ancient innate or intrinsic immunity has

been further complemented by adaptive processes, which
provide a specific response when required.
Although intensively studied, the evolutionary history of
this system is not well known. The evolution of certain
immunological protein groups of the human immunome
have already been studied. For example, five gene groups
of the NF-κB signaling pathway in vertebrates and insects
[1], or the evolution of the interleukin-1 protein family in
vertebrates [2] are extensively studied. To explore the
molecular evolution of the human immune system, a refPage 1 of 6

erence set of genes and proteins needs to be defined [3].
We have identified and collected genes and proteins
essential for human immunity and a genome wide investigation of the evolution of these genes has been carried
out [4]. Here, we describe a database for the evolutionary
trees of proteins in the human immune system (ImmTree)
[5]. ImmTree contains information for orthologs of the
human genes in 80 species, including all the major model
organisms from Eukaryota. The evolutionary relationships of the orthologs are presented as phylogenetic trees.
Further, ImmTree provides a unique data set for comparison of human-mouse ortholog pairs by the presented synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates of the
genes.

trees for most of the ortholog groups for the data from the
three independent databases. A simple neighbour-joining
method was applied if the ortholog group contained only
three taxa, otherwise bootstrap analysis was applied with
parsimony method, heuristic tree search, and 1000 replications. The number of bootstrap replicates was reduced
to 100 in the case of OrthoMCL ortholog groups where
more than 50 sequences were in the group. Similarly the
number of replicates was reduced even further, to 50,
where the number of sequences exceeded 100. This was
necessary due to computational time requirements, since
some OrthoMCL groups contain numerous paralogs. In
these cases, the tree constructing becomes very CPU intensive without any further phylogenetic advantage.

Construction and content

For a general overview of the ortholog groups, we generated a fourth tree. This tree represents protein sequences
from all the species in any of the three datasets. Moreover,
each species is represented by just one sequence, preventing the accumulation of identical sequences from multiple data sources. This way the large paralog groups from
the OrthoMCL database are represented by just a single
sequence.

Collecting human immune system related genes and
proteins and their orthologs
We collected from articles, textbooks and electronic
sources altogether 847 human genes that are involved in
immunology related processes, or which are essential for
the life of immunological cells and organs [4]. The variable chains of the immunoglobulins (Igs), B and T cell
receptors (BCRs and TCRs) and major histocompatibility
complexes (MHCs) were not included since these proteins
are not coded by conventionally structured genes but by
gene fragments. These gene fargments and their products
are already exclusively collected and listed in IMGT, the
international ImMunoGeneTics information system at
National Computer Centre of Higher Education [6] and
European Bioinformatics Institute [7]. ImmTree contains
the genes and proteins that are required for processing
these gene fragments. In the ImmTree database Entrez
Gene [8] identifiers were used to refer to genes. Protein
sequences were downloaded from NCBI GenBank [9].
Ortholog sequences are from the Eukaryotic Gene
Orthologs (EGO) [10], HomoloGene [11] and OrthoMCL
[12] databases. HomoloGene contains groups of
homologs for completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes,
while EGO has (tentative) ortholog groups of the eukaryotic sequences in the TIGR sequence database. OrthoMCL
contains sequences exclusively from 55 complete
genomes and therefore the number of sequences from the
different branches is limited. The releases used were EGO
version 9.0, released 15 February 2005; HomoloGene
build 50.1, released 25 July 2006; Ortho MCL version 1.0,
released 19 October 2005.

The nucleotide sequences of ortholog groups were taken
from EGO and the protein sequences from HomoloGene
and OrthoMCL. The sequences were aligned using ClustalW [13] with the default parameters. Phylogenetic trees
were reconstructed for all three type of ortholog groups
using the PAUP* program package [14] when the group
contained at least three sequences. We thus created three

The nucleotide sequences from the EGO database were
translated to amino acids to align the representative protein sequences from the three databases. The translation
was done in all six frames, and all six transcripts were
aligned with the human protein sequence using bl2seq
from the BLAST package [15]. Only the transcript with the
longest identical stretch with the human ortholog was
retained for further analysis. The protein sequences collected this way were aligned and phylogenetic trees were
constructed as described above.
Comparison of the human-mouse ortholog pairs
In 603 cases orthologs were present both in the mouse
and human genome in the HomoloGene database. These
pairs were further analysed in detail. The cDNA sequences
of the human and mouse genes were translated to protein
sequences and then aligned using the blast2seq program.
The corresponding cDNA sequences were aligned based
on the amino acid sequence alignment with proprietary
Perl scripts, some of which utilize modules from the Bioperl Project [16]. The estimates of synonymous mutations
per synonymous sites (Ks or dS) and of non-synonymous
mutations per non-synonymous sites (Ka or dN) values
were calculated [17]. Z values and the Ka/Ks quotients
describe the conservation of given genes since the humanmouse divergence.

Utility and Discussion
Database access and search
The ImmTree database can be accessed online [5]. The
service provides two search modes. The first search page is

Immunome Research 2007, 3:4

an interface for finding human genes by GenBank gi numbers, GenBank accession numbers, or UniProt [18] accession numbers. The other engine is for searching ortholog
groups by using more complex criteria (Fig 1A). The first
options concentrate on features of human genes and proteins. One can search for protein domains either by InterPro [19] id or name of the domain. Ontology queries are
based either on GeneOntology [20] ids or ontology keywords. In addition, keyword searches are possible for gene
identification. Also, some predefined categories like 'CD
molecules', 'complement system' or 'inflammation' can
be searched.
The second group of search options helps to identify features common for ortholog groups. The most basic option
is to search for organisms within an ortholog group either
by NCBI's Taxonomy [21] id or by the name of the taxon.
Ortholog groups can be searched also by their ancestor
taxa. Such complex searches can be performed, for example, only for 'genes which appeared earlier than Coelomata according to the EGO database' (94 result groups) or
'genes which emerged in the Bilateria group according to
the HomoloGene database' (41 result groups).
The third type of search option is based on the statistical
information of human-mouse ortholog pair comparisons.
Gene pairs can be found by the Ka/Ks quotient value or by
the Z value. Both these parameters refer to the conservation of sequences [22,23]. Is is also possible to combine
search options, for example, to search for the 'genes
related to the complement system which have a Ka/Ks
value less than 0.15' (5 result groups) or 'genes with the
keyword lectin which have a Ka/Ks value greater than 0.6'
(4 result groups).
Reports of results
All the search results are displayed in an interactive list
from which one can investigate details for each of the
identified ortholog groups (Fig 1B). Similarly to the gene
group search page, the results for a single ortholog group
are divided into three main parts (Fig 1C). The header of
the page presents details of the human gene. Sequences
are available via links to GenBank and UniProt. Evolutionary levels denoting the appearance of the gene are
shown based on the EGO, HomoloGene and OrthoMCL
databases and combined data. Then, the results of the
human-mouse ortholog comparison, including the values
for the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site (Ks, Ka), their quotient value (Ka/Ks) and
Z value, are presented. The evolutionary trees for the combined, EGO, HomoloGene and OrthoMCL datasets are in
the third section. Links for the trees for the four datasets
are also provided. The multiple sequence alignments and
the evolutionary trees are available in nexus format [24]

for download and can be visualized with the ATV (A Tree
Viewer) Java Applet [25].
Figure 2 presents the four phylogenetic trees for the
orthologs of the human membrane alanine aminopeptidase precursor. The differences of the ortholog definitions
in the different databases are clearly visible. The most
strict definition of an ortholog group is in the HomoloGene database (Fig 2A). There are sequences just from a
few species, and just a few paralogs in the dataset. Contrastingly, the tree for the EGO data (Fig 2B) contains
sequences from more species. EGO's definition of an
ortholog group is less strict and therefore the groups are
called tentative ortholog groups. Consequently the
sequences are usually more distant. Many OrthoMCL
groups (Fig 2C) contain lots of paralogs. OrthoMCL
includes proteins from only 55 selected genomes. Paralogs are presented if they appeared after the most recent
divergence of the included genomes. EGO and HomoloGene have sequences from a much broader species spectrum, and in addition they try to avoid the inclusion of
paralogs. In ImmTree all three datasets with the corresponding trees are provided, and the user can use any of
them according to their needs. For a more general overview, ImmTree provides a fourth tree (Fig 2D) to combine
the data from the three databases. In this tree, only one
sequence from each species is included. ImmTree thus
allows one to investigate how broadly spread genes are
among the taxa.

Conclusion
ImmTree is a new and unique data resource for exploring
the molecular evolution of the immune system. Although
excellent databases, such as The Adaptive Evolution Database (TAED) [26] or the Database of Evolutionary Distances (DED) [27] are available for studying molecular
evolution, they are general systems for all genes. It would
be hard to collect molecular evolution related data for the
immune system from them. ImmTree is a dedicated
resource considering the special needs of researchers of
evolution of the immune system. ImmTree facilitates queries according to the classic groupings of immune functions, such as humoral immunity, cellular immunity,
complement system. The database will be continuously
updated.
