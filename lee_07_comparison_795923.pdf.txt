Abstract
Background: Xp10 and OP1 are phages of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causative
agent of bacterial leaf blight in rice plants, which were isolated in 1967 in Taiwan and in 1954 in
Japan, respectively. We recently isolated the Xoo phage Xop411.
Results: The linear Xop411 genome (44,520 bp, 58 ORFs) sequenced here is 147 bp longer than
that of Xp10 (60 ORFs) and 735 bp longer than that of OP1 (59 ORFs). The G+C contents of OP1
(51%) and Xop411 and Xp10 (52% each) are less than that of the host (65%). The 9-bp 3'-overhangs
(5'-GGACAGTCT-3') in Xop411 and Xp10 are absent from OP1. More of the deduced Xop411
proteins share higher degrees of identity with Xp10 than with OP1 proteins, while the right end of
the genomes of Xp10 and OP1, containing all predicted promoters, share stronger homology.
Xop411, Xp10, and OP1 contain 8, 7, and 6 freestanding HNH endonuclease genes, respectively.
These genes can be classified into five groups depending on their possession of the HNH domain
(HNN or HNH type) and/or AP2 domain in intact or truncated forms. While the HNN-AP2 type
endonuclease genes dispersed in the genome, the HNH type endonuclease genes, each with a
unique copy, were located within the same genome context. Mass spectrometry and N-terminal
sequencing showed nine Xop411 coat proteins, among which three were identified, six were
assigned as coat proteins (4) and conserved phage proteins (2) in Xp10. The major coat protein, in
which only the N-terminal methionine is removed, appears to exist in oligomeric forms containing
2 to 6 subunits. The three phages exhibit different patterns of domain duplication in the N-terminus
of the tail fiber, which are involved in determination of the host range. Many short repeated
sequences are present in and around the duplicated domains.
Conclusion: Geographical separation may have confined lateral gene transfer among the Xoo
phages. The HNN-AP2 type endonucleases were more likely to transfer their genes randomly in
the genome and may degenerate after successful transmission. Some repeated sequences may be
involved in duplication/loss of the domains in the tail fiber genes.

Background
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a gram-negative
plant pathogenic bacterium that causes leaf blight in rice
plants, thus having a serious effect on rice production in
Taiwan, China, Japan, India, and South America [1]. Agrochemicals have been somewhat effective for disease control, although biological control using bacteriophages has
been considered [2]. In addition, phages that specifically
infect Xoo have been used to type Xoo hosts in the field
[3,4].
Among the Xoo phages are the lytic phages Xp10, Xp12,
OP1, and OP2, and the filamentous phages Xf and phiXo
[2-8]. Recently, the genomic sequences of Xp10 (44,373
bp, 60 ORFs), OP1 (43,785 bp, 59 ORFs), and OP2
(46,643 bp, 62 ORFs) were determined. Xp10 and OP1
both have linear genomes and share high degrees of similarity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels [2,6].
In contrast, OP2 has a circularly permuted and terminally
redundant genome, which differs in sequence from those
of Xp10 and OP1 [2,6,8]. Xp15 is a phage of X. campestris
pv. pelargonii; its genomic sequence (55,770 bp) is available in the NCBI database (AY986977).
We recently isolated a Xoo bacteriophage, Xop411, from
rice plants from a rice paddy near National Chung Hsing
University that showed serious symptoms of bacterial leaf
blight [9]. During our sequencing of the Xop411 phage
genome, the genomic sequences of Xp10 and OP1 were
published [2,6]. Since comparative analysis of several bacteriophages from a single species offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms that drive prokaryotic
genetic diversity [10], we compared the sequence of
Xop411 with those of Xp10, isolated in Taiwan in 1967,
and OP1, isolated in Japan in 1954 [2,4,6,7].

Results and discussion
Assignments of Xop411 genes
Assembly of over 450 overlapped sequences (over 6× coverage) of the Xop411 genome showed that it was linear
and consisted of 44,520 bp. The terminal sequence, 5'GGACAGTCT-3', is identical to the 9-bp 3'-protruding
sequence of Xp10 but was not observed in OP1 [2,6]. The
G+C contents of the three Xoo phages were similar, 52%
each for Xop411 and Xp10 and 51% for OP1 [6], but deviated from the 65% of Xoo [11]. The three phages showed
highly similar genomic organization and highly similar
protein products (Figure 1, Table 1). The Xp10 gene numbers were used for the corresponding genes (58) in
Xop411, with a two-part number assigned when an additional gene was present, for example 31.1 for the gene
between 31 and 32 (Additional file 1). Some genes,
encoding HNH endonucleases (underlined) or hypothetical proteins, were only found in Xop411 (p42.1, p55.1,
p57.1), Xp10 (p03, p04, p40, and p59) or OP1 (ORF15,

16, and 32), or were missing only from Xop411 (p05/
ORF3, p47/ORF47, and p50/ORF50), Xp10 (p27.1/
ORF26.1, p31.1/ORF31) or OP1 (p17/p17) (Figure 1,
Table 1). These findings indicate that numerous insertions/deletions have occurred in the Xoo phages. More
deduced Xop411 proteins shared higher degrees of similarity with Xp10 than with OP1 proteins. Only 15 Xop411
proteins, most located between p23 and p31, shared
higher identities with OP1 than with Xp10 proteins
(Table 1). These findings suggest that Xop411 is more
closely related to Xp10 than to OP1. Although sequence
information from more phages is required, discrepancies
in similarity indicate that geographical separation may
have limited lateral gene transfer between phages and
other sources.
Holin genes required for host lysis were not assigned for
Xp10 and OP1 [2,6]. These genes are usually small and
adjacent to the cognate lysozyme genes, with their protein
products usually containing at least one transmembrane
domain (TMD) and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain
[12]. In Xop411, p27.1 (98 aa, with one TMD at aa
25–47), located upstream of the previously characterized
lysozyme gene (p28) [9], was assigned as the putative
holin gene. However, since p27.1 overlaps with p28 by
104 bp and lacks a hydrophilic C-terminal domain, it is
unclear whether it encodes holin function. A corresponding ORF was identified in OP1, but the corresponding
region in Xp10 was assigned to the N-terminus of the lysozyme gene (Table 1).
The next best matched ORFs other than those from Xp10
and OP1
The deduced Xop411 proteins also share similarities with
proteins other than those of Xp10 and OP1, and proteins
encoded in five Xop411 regions are worth noting (see
Additional file 2): 1) The tail-related proteins p19 to p22,
encoded in a 5.9-kb region, share 33–44% identity
(55–63% similarity) with ORFs of the X. campestris pv.
pelargonii phage Xp15. 2) Proteins p26 to p28, encoded
in a 2.3-kb region and including tail fiber and phage lysozyme, show 33–48% identity to proteins from Chromobacterium violaceum. 3) Proteins p35 to p37, encoded in a
2.1-kb region, share 30–47% identity with proteins from
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 4) Proteins p38 to p41, encoded
in a 4.3-kb region, show 38–45% identity to proteins
from Burkholderia pseudomallei. 5) Protein p33 shares 60%
identity with a protein from Bradyrhizobium sp. In addition, Xop411 p08 (ClpP protease), p28 (lysozyme) and
p39 (DNA polymerase I) are similar to proteins from
Xylella fastidiosa (25–38% identity) and X. axonopodis pv.
citri (42% identity) (see Additional file 2). These data suggest that Xoo phages have actively participated in gene
transfer with several organisms. In contrast, the Xoo
genome did not contain homologues with significant sim-

ilarity (i.e. with expected values less than e-4) to the proteins of the three phages. Since the Xoo phages are lytic,
opportunities to exchange genetic material with the host
may have been rare.

endonuclease genes are present in the sequenced genomes
of coliphages RB16 (DQ023482-7), RB43 (NC_007023),
T1 [19], Rtp [20] and T5 [21] as well as in the lactophage
bIL170 [22].

Gene products related to endonucleases of the HNH
family
Members of the HNH endonuclease family are encoded
by free-standing ORFs between genes or within introns or
inteins in viruses, bacteriophages, and bacteria, as well as
in eukaryotic nuclear and organellar genomes [13]. Most
of these proteins are homing endonucleases involved in
the mobility of their own genes or of the introns/inteins
in which they are located [13-15]. These HNH proteins are
characterized by the motif His-Asn-His at the N-terminus
but share little overall sequence similarity and can be classified into 8 subsets [16]. Proteins of the second subset
usually consist of an HNN domain and an adjacent DNAbinding domain, AP2 (Pfam:PF00847) or IENRI
(Smart:SM00479), and are found primarily in phage
genomes [17,18]. For example, multiple copies of HNH

Xp10 and OP1 contain 7 (p03, p05, p17, p50, p53, p58,
and p60) and 6 (ORF 3, 31, 50, 53, 58, and 59) genes
encoding HNH endonucleases, respectively [2,6]. It was
suggested that i) these proteins conserve many functionally important residues which may preserve their ability to
bind DNA, ii) these genes may have populated the
genomes through gene duplication and/or transposition,
iii) their presence may account for the branched DNA
structures observed by electron microscopy following
denaturation and renaturation, and iv) one or more of
these HNH family proteins may be involved in domain
duplication of the tail fiber, which can alter the host range
(see below) [2,6]. The Xop411 genome was found to contain 8 (p17, p31.1, p42.1, p53, p55.1, p57.1, p58, and
p60) HNH endonuclease genes (Figures 1, 2). Using
Weblogo to analyze these 21 Xoo phage proteins, consen-

similarity was found.

sus sequences were generated for the HNH and AP2
domains (Figure 2) [23]. They could be divided into 5
groups (Figure 2A). The HNN domain was found in proteins of groups I (9 proteins, each with intact HNN and
AP2 domains), II (1 protein, with intact HNN and C-terminally truncated AP2 domains) and III (2 proteins, each
containing only an HNN domain but no AP2 domain),
whereas the HNH domain was detected only in the 3 proteins of group IV, which do not retain an AP2 domain. The
6 proteins in group V had degenerated, losing their HNH
domains and over half of the N-terminus of their AP2
domains. A phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of
50 conserved amino acids of the HNH domain of the 15
proteins in groups I to IV suggests that the HNH type
endonucleases may have arisen from an ancestor different

from that of the HNN type endonucleases (see Additional
file 3).
We found that all the HNN domain-containing proteins
of the Xoo phages have conserved Asp/His residues
flanked by two quasi-conserved boxes (HRLAWLL and
WP) at the N-terminus and three conserved boxes (DNR,
NLRE and EN) at the C-terminus, but do not have either
metal-binding cysteine-dyads (CX2C) or conserved GG
motifs (Figure 2A). The lack of a metal-binding motif suggests that these HNN type endonucleases may not require
zinc ion to function. Since most HNN-AP2/IENRI proteins are intron-encoded site-specific endonucleases [16],
the presence of multiple HNN-AP2 endonuclease genes in
all three Xoo phage genomes suggests that these genes,
like the homing-endonuclease genes (HEGs), are able to

self-duplicate in the genome. However, since no conserved sequences could be identified in the flanking
regions of these endonuclease genes and their genomic
locations varied among the three phages, it is likely that
transmission of these HNN-AP2 endonuclease genes was
sequence-independent.
The HNH domains of the group IV proteins, which share
higher degrees of similarity with the consensus HNH
domain, have two cysteine-dyads (CX2C) flanking the
conserved Asp/His residues, suggesting that zinc ion is
required for their function, as well as two boxes (DX2NL
and CH) on the C-terminal side of each domain (Figure
2A). These group IV proteins are similar to the HNH-type
protein (gp13) found in the lactophage bIL170, which has
two cysteine-dyads (CX2CX36CX2C) and no DNA-binding
motif [22]. As endonucleases of this type are present as
unique copies at the analogous positions of the Xoo
phage genomes (the right end), they may have specific
functions other than transposition, similar to the HNNAP2 type endonucleases.

The HNN-AP2 type endonuclease genes may not only be
able to transmit into multiple sites of the genome but may
also degenerate. For example, although the genes hegG
and hegJ are present in the genomes of three T5 phage
strains, our sequence analyses showed that full-length
genes are retained in the strains sequenced in France
(GenBank accession numbers AY692264) and Moscow
(AY543070), but that both genes had degenerated in the
T5 strain ATCC11303-B5 (AY587007). Specifically, a
short insertion disrupted hegG (AAX11946 and
AAX11947) and two point deletions caused frame shifts
in hegJ (AAX12048), suggesting that degeneration of HNH
endonuclease genes may occur after a deleterious insertion/deletion. In addition, one T4 HNH type Mob endonuclease gene, mobA, was found to have degenerated into
a pseudogene [24]. A cyclical model of gain and loss of
HEGs [25,26] has been used to deduce the possible evolutionary path of the I-SceI endonucleases of a self-splicing
group I intron in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the intron/
HEG of T-even-like phages [27,28]. For Xoo phages, however, the data may be better explained by a linear model
of gain and loss, in which functional alien endonuclease
genes would be fixed but start degenerating after success-

ful incorporation (Figure 3). For example, in Xp10, proteins p17, p50 and p58, each with intact HNH and AP2
domains, may represent endonuclease family members
that retain their functions; proteins p03 (with a complete
HNN domain but lacking the C-terminus of AP2) and p53
(retaining only the C-terminus of AP2) may represent proteins after different degrees of progressive degeneration;
and protein p05, which has only a small segment of a
highly degenerated AP2 domain, may represent a gene
product with the greatest extent of degeneration and the
most ancient HNH-AP2 endonuclease in the genome (Figure 3). Similar clues to gene degeneration were observed
in the HNH-AP2 endonuclease genes of the other two
phages (Figure 3).
Promoters and terminators
We found that the nucleotide sequences between the end
of p55 and the right end of the genome were highly variable in the three Xoo phages, with Xp10 and OP1 being
more similar to each other than either were to Xop411,
and segments with higher degrees of identity present at
different positions (see Additional file 4). Mosaicism of
the common segments suggests that these phages have
undergone numerous recombination events, possibly
during co-infections, resulting in gene rearrangements
and insertion/deletion. In Xp10, the intergenic region
between p57 and p58 separates the genes transcribed leftward and rightward and contains all six promoters
[6,29,30]. Based on a similarity search, we located putative promoters resembling those of Xp10 in Xop411 and
OP1. We found that the promoter sequences in Xp10 and
OP1 were highly conserved, but shared lower degrees of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/442

identity with the Xop411 promoters (see Additional file
5). In addition, Xop411 had five sequences located
between p56 and p57, and one sequence, P3, between
p57.1 and p58, whereas OP1 had four sequences located
between ORF57 and ORF58 and two, Pup and φP1, contained within ORF57 (see Additional file 4).
Similarity searches of the Xop411 and OP1 genomes for
the five predicted terminators of Xp10 [29] revealed four
corresponding sequences at analogous positions (Figure
1, Table 2). These predicted terminators in Xop411, TR2 to
TR5, each shared high degrees of identity with the respective analogous terminators in the other phages. However,
sequences similar to Xp10 TR1, which is thought to possess
a low efficiency of termination [29], were not found in
Xop411 and OP1, suggesting that such a low-efficiency
terminator may not be essential.
Domain duplications in tail fiber and implications in host
range
Japanese isolates of Xoo can be classified into four phagovars, based on their susceptibility to OP1, with host-range
mutants of OP1 capable of infecting different phagovars
[2]. Sequencing of the tail fiber genes from these phage
strains revealed that changes in host range are due to
duplications in at least one of three domains (domains 1,
2, and 3) in ca. 118 aa at the N-terminus (see Additional
file 6). This is similar to findings in other phages; for
example, the host range of T4 is expanded by duplications
of a small region of the tail fiber adhesin [31]. Amino acid
sequence alignments showed that OP1 possesses domains
-1-2-3-, Xp10 has domains -1-2-2-2-3- [2] and Xop411

exhibits domains -1-2-3-3-3- (see Additional file 6). Interestingly, while OP1 and OPh1 have the same domain
architecture (-1-2-3-) and no drastic changes in the surrounding amino acid residues, OP1 infects only phagovar
A whereas OP1h infects only phagovar B (see Additional
file 6) [2]. This finding suggests that these related Xoo
phages might use a complex structure, also containing
other component(s), to determine the host range, with
mutations in the latter component(s) altering the host
range. Further tests are needed to understand the host
ranges of Xop411 and Xp10.
In mouse minisatellite Pc-1, tandem repeats of
d(GGCAG)n, which can facilitate the formation of a telomere-like intra-molecular folded-back quadruplex structure, have been shown to be hotspots of recombination
during meiosis [32-34]. The genes encoding the tail fibers
of the Xoo phages contain many short repeats (see Additional File 7), including i) inverted repeats that are all
located outside the domains, which may be important in
the acquisition/loss of domain architectures, ii) direct Grich pentanucleotide (GGCAG) repeats at both ends of
domains 1 and 2, and iii) a direct G-rich octanucleotide
(CAGGCCGC) repeat flanking domain 3. It is currently
unclear whether the presence of these short direct repeats
can facilitate the duplication/deletion of the tail fiber
domains by recombination, as observed for mouse minisatellite Pc-1. Inoue et. al. proposed that the HNH-family
proteins may be involved in domain duplication via
recombination using Holliday junction structures as the
intermediates [2], but it is not clear if this is the mechanism occurring here.

Identification of virion proteins
SDS-PAGE separation of the Xp10 virion proteins resulted
in 6 major bands, three of which (p09, major head; p14,
major tail; p26, tail fiber) were identified [6]. SDS-PAGE
separation of the Xop411 virion proteins resulted in at
least 16 discrete bands: 15 (of MW 250, 200, 160, 105, 90,
78, 47, 42, 33, 31, 28, 22, 19, 13, and 11 kDa) on 12%
gels and 7 (of MW 250, 200, 160, 150, 105, 90, and 78
kDa) on 6% gels (Figure 4). LC MS/MS analysis (see Additional file 8) indicated that these bands contained 14 proteins, 9 from the virion and 5 from the host. The 250-,
200-, 150-, 78- and 42-kDa bands contain oligomers of
p09, the 41.5-kDa major capsid subunit, of 2 to 6 subunits. Oligomerization of p09 was also observed in Xp10,
but in the 140- and 165-kDa bands and in high MW materials in the gel wells. Xp10 p09 may be cleaved by a phageencoded protease, p08, generating a mature major head
protein of 283 aa, which is 170 aa less than the precursor
protein [6]. In contrast, our N-terminal sequencing of the
42-kDa band gave a sequence, TDITSK, showing that only
the N-terminal methionine was missing.

The head portal protein, p07, with a calculated MW of 47
kDa, was found in the 47- and 31-kDa bands, suggesting
that the unprocessed and processed forms co-exist in the
virions. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that the 31-kDa band
contained another protein, p26, which was identified as
the tail fiber in Xp10 [6]. N-terminal sequencing showed
that the 22-kDa band was p14, the major tail protein in
Xp10. The 13-kDa band was also a doublet, containing
p10 (phage conserved protein in Xp10) and p19 (tail protein). The 160-, 105-, and 11-kDa bands were identified as
p22 (tail protein), p18 (tail length tape measure protein),

proteins share higher degrees of identity with Xp10 than
with OP1 proteins, indicate that the two phages isolated
in Taiwan are more closely related to each other than they
are to OP1. Thus, geographical separation may have limited lateral gene transfers between phages and other
sources. However, our finding that more of the DNA
sequences are conserved by Xp10 and OP1 in the region
between p55 and the right end of the genome, a region
containing the predicted promoters, suggests that Xop411
has undergone sequence rearrangements and insertions/
deletions to a greater degree. The HNN-AP2 type endonucleases may have transferred their genes randomly and
begun degenerating after successful horizontal transmission, whereas the HNH type endonucleases, each with
one copy, were located within the same genome context.
Comparison of the host range and the architecture of the
duplicated domains in the N-terminus of the tail fiber
proteins suggests that the Xoo phages may need additional components for adsorption. Some of the repeated
sequences in and around the domains may be involved in
duplication/loss of the domains. We identified 6 more
proteins than those identified for Xp10, with p10 and p13
shown to be phage coat proteins.

and p13 (phage conserved protein in Xp10), respectively.
In summary, six more proteins than those identified for
Xp10 were found here, and the conserved proteins p10
and p13 in Xp10 were found to be phage coat proteins.
The 5 host proteins in the 4 bands were TonB-dependent
receptor FyuA (90-kDa), outer membrane protein MopB
and hypothetical protein XOO0584 (33-kDa), MopB and
colicin receptor protein CirA (28-kDa), and hypothetical
protein XOO4199 (19-kDa). Since the experiments were
repeated four times using virions freshly purified by ultracentrifugation, the consistent presence of these proteins
indicates that they were rather tightly associated with the
phage particles.

Conclusion

same G+C content and that more of the deduced Xop411

Bacteria, bacteriophages, and growth conditions
X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) was cultivated in Tryptic Soy
Broth or Agar (Bacto™) at 28°C and Escherichia coli was
grown in LB medium at 37°C. Ampicillin (50 μg/ml) was
added when necessary. The procedures described previously [9] were used for plaque assay, phage propagation
(using Xoo strain 21 as the host), purification of phage
particles, and isolation and restriction enzyme digestion
of phage DNA.
Sequence analyses
The purified phage DNA was treated in a HydroShear
(GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA). Fragments of 1.0 to 3.0
kb were isolated and ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK. Clones were randomly picked and subjected
to nucleotide sequencing (ABI 3700). To determine the 3'protruding terminal sequences (gap closure), the Xop411
genomic DNA was treated with or without Klenow
enzyme, using its 3'→5' exonuclease activity and ligated
using T4 ligase, and the ligation products were PCRamplified separately with a pair of primers annealed close
to the ends, followed by sequencing of the amplicons.
Thus the extra nucleotides, obtained from the PCR product amplified on the template that had not been treated
with Klenow enzyme, represented the 3'-protruding
sequence. A+T content was analyzed by using the program
available online [35]. DNA sequences were assembled
using the SeqMan program from the DNASTAR package
(DNASTAR, Madison, WI) and analyzed with NCBI software [36]. ORF was predicted using GeneMark. The nucle-

HNH endonucleases were identified by searching for conserved domains as well as similarities to the endonucleases identified in Xp10 [6]. The BLAST program was used
to search for nucleotide and amino acid similarities, and
phylogenetic analysis was performed using the parsimony
method (Phylip package ver. 3.66). Bootstrap values were
obtained for a consensus based on 1000 randomly generated trees using SEQBOOT and CONSENSE.
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and LC-MS/MS analysis
Phage particles purified by ultracentrifugation were mixed
with sample buffer, heated in a boiling water bath for 3
min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE separation in 12% or
6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were visualized by staining the gels with Coomassie brilliant blue,
excised from the gels and subjected to LC-MS/MS (ABI
Qstar System) analysis at the Biotechnology Center,
National Chung Hsing University.
N-terminal amino acid sequencing of proteins
The proteins from the Xop411 particles separated in SDSPAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Membrane strips containing the isolated protein bands were
excised and subjected to Edman degradation to determine
their N-terminal sequences (477A sequencer, PE Applied
Biosystems).
