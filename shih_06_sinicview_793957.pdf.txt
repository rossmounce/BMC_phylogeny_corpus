Abstract
Background: Deluged by the rate and complexity of completed genomic sequences, the need to
align longer sequences becomes more urgent, and many more tools have thus been developed. In
the initial stage of genomic sequence analysis, a biologist is usually faced with the questions of how
to choose the best tool to align sequences of interest and how to analyze and visualize the
alignment results, and then with the question of whether poorly aligned regions produced by the
tool are indeed not homologous or are just results due to inappropriate alignment tools or scoring
systems used. Although several systematic evaluations of multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
programs have been proposed, they may not provide a standard-bearer for most biologists because
those poorly aligned regions in these evaluations are never discussed. Thus, a tool that allows cross
comparison of the alignment results obtained by different tools simultaneously could help a
biologist evaluate their correctness and accuracy.
Results: In this paper, we present a versatile alignment visualization system, called SinicView, (for
Sequence-aligning INnovative and Interactive Comparison VIEWer), which allows the user to
efficiently compare and evaluate assorted nucleotide alignment results obtained by different tools.
SinicView calculates similarity of the alignment outputs under a fixed window using the sum-of-pairs
method and provides scoring profiles of each set of aligned sequences. The user can visually
compare alignment results either in graphic scoring profiles or in plain text format of the aligned
nucleotides along with the annotations information. We illustrate the capabilities of our
visualization system by comparing alignment results obtained by MLAGAN, MAVID, and MULTIZ,
respectively.
Conclusion: With SinicView, users can use their own data sequences to compare various
alignment tools or scoring systems and select the most suitable one to perform alignment in the
initial stage of sequence analysis.

Background
With exponentially increasing genomic sequences available in the public domain [1-5] comparative genomics
demonstrates its power to help biologists identify novel
conserved and functional regions in genomes [6-9]. Based
on the comparison of cross-species genomic sequences,
biologists can understand the evolutionary relationship of
genomic regions among species, discover conserved
regions between different genomes, such as yeast species
genomes [10], metazoan genomes [11], vertebrate
genomes [12], and mammalian genomes [13], discover
regulatory motifs in the yeast [14] and human promoters
[15] or identify potential conserved non-genic sequences
(CNGs) [16].
However, genomic sequences can be megabase long and
thus the traditional sequence alignment tools based on
dynamic programming would not work efficiently due to
their time and space complexities. To better tackle this
problem, several tools for genomic sequence alignment
have been proposed, such as pairwise sequence aligners
like MUMmer [17], GS-Aligner [18], Avid [19] and
LAGAN [20], and multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
programs like T-COFFEE[21], MAFFT [22], MultiPipMaker [23], MULTIZ [24], MLAGAN [20], MAVID [25],
and MUSCLE [26,27]. These alignment tools, however,
are heuristics based and do not provide any indication of
how far they are from an optimal solution. The comparisons of alignment tools using a set of benchmarking
sequences have also been conducted in recent years [2830]. We found that the majority of these tools usually fail
to generate consistent results especially in aligning divergent cross-species sequences. As a result, the more alignment tools there are available in the public domain, the
more confusion it creates for users to decide which tool is
most suitable to align their sequences.
Although the comparison results in [28-31] provide some
evaluations of several popular alignment tools, the conclusions may not be directly applicable to users'
sequences. Furthermore the user usually does not know
for sure whether those poorly aligned regions produced
by the alignment tools are indeed non-homologous or
just due to inappropriate tools or scoring systems used.
Consequently, if some homologous regions are unaligned, the estimated evolution distances of these
sequences may be inaccurate and therefore the constructed phylogenetic trees may be incorrect. Facing this
problem, the user may have to try different tools or scoring systems to evaluate the correctness and accuracy of
alignment results in the initial stage of sequence analysis.
On the other hand, new alignment tools are released continually. Users may want to compare these newly released
tools with those that they are most familiar with. Thus, it
is desirable and most useful to have a visualization system

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/103

that provides a direct and efficient method and can assist
users to cross compare and inspect alignment results
obtained by different MSA tools especially at the initial
stage of sequence analysis.
In recent years, a number of visualization tools have been
released in the public domain. These tools can be roughly
divided into two categories: integrated genome/sequence
browser and individual alignment result visualization. In
the former category, such as UCSC ENCODE project
[32,33], UCSC human genome browser [34], Ensembl
[35], ECR Browser [36,37], users can view alignment
results mapped onto the sequenced genomes. Some of
these browsers also provide registered users to submit
alignment results and see the conservation regions
between different genomes. In the latter category, the
tools are developed to visualize individual alignment
results. The VISTA-related tools are among the famous
ones that have been developed for several years [38].
mVISTA is a set of programs for comparing DNA
sequences from two or more species up to megabases long
and visualize these alignments with annotation information [39]. rVISTA (regulatory Vista) combines database
searches for transcription factor binding sites with a comparative sequence analysis [40,41]. GenomeVISTA compares users' sequences with several whole genome
assemblies [42,43]. Phylo-VISTA analyzes alignments of
multiple DNA sequences from different species while considering their phylogenetic relationships [44]. In general,
the VISTA family of tools provides users with a novel
graphical user interface (GUI) to view alignment results
from different viewpoints. In addition to the VISTA family, PipMaker [23,45], and zPicture [46] are also popular
visualization tools for sequence or genomes alignment
results. All of these tools are web-based with friendly user
interfaces, and allow users to easily visualize alignment
results with annotations. However, these tools are limited
solely to single alignment results. The capability of simultaneously comparing multiple results from different
alignment tools or different parameters of a scoring system, such as changing match rewards or mismatch penalties, is notably lacking.
In this article, we present a versatile alignment visualization system, SinicView (Sequence-aligning INnovative
and Interactive Comparison VIEWer), which enables users
to efficiently compare and evaluate assorted alignment
results obtained by different tools. SinicView for the
present calculates similarity of the alignment outputs
under a fixed window using the sum-of-pairs method and
provides scoring profiles of each set of aligned sequences.
Other scoring matrices, such as EMBOSS DNA scoring
matrix [47] and YASS [48], are also provided in SinicView
for users to select. Besides, users can also upload their
preferable scoring matrices to calculate the scoring profile

curves. Users can visually compare alignment results
either in graphic scoring profiles or in plain text format of
the aligned nucleotides. In addition, the information
about alignment gaps and sequence annotations is also
presented. The real-time juxtaposition of the visualization
results from different MSA programs would bring more
insights into the evaluation process. With SinicView, users
can use their own sequences to survey and compare various multiple alignment tools and thus to unveil their merits (and shortcomings). Moreover, the cross-tools
comparison can provide users more confidence in their
final alignment results especially for those poorly aligned
regions.

Implementation
There are three viewing sections in SinicView: Global
View, Detailed View, and Information View (including
annotations and gaps.) The Global View section shows
the whole percent identity plots that calculate the sum-ofpair scores based on one specified reference sequence. In
the Detailed View section, the panels show the whole percent identity plots of different alignment results individually. By observing the graphical results, it is much more

intuitive and straightforward to judge the consistency of
the alignment results. When the sliding window is less
than 100 base pairs, the Detailed View section will automatically switch from the curve-based plot to the display
of the detailed alignments in a colored text format where
identical characters are shown. The Information View section containing annotation and gap information is
stacked beneath the Detailed View section. SinicView also
provides several global comparison charts that can assist
biologists to choose the best alignment result among
those produced by the programs under consideration.
SinicView is implemented entirely in Java language to
ensure portability across major platforms and is accessible
with a web browser and Internet connection. The main
features of SinicView are summarized as follows:
1. Visualization of the scoring distribution of alignment
results in a curve-based graphic format;
2. Generation of the comparison charts using stacked-bar
and pie charts, which shows the distribution of the identical rates among various alignment programs for benchmarking purposes;

Two comparison charts can be generated by SinicView: the stacked-bar chart illustrates the proportion comparison of cross alignment results and the pie chart shows the proportion of different identical rates of an individual alignment result. The complete data of the charts are tabulated on the left.

3. Inclusion of a versatile manipulative functionality (gapdisplay toggling, drag-and-drop zooming/shifting, and
graphic/text display toggling);
4. Visualization of annotation information and display of
the phylogenetic trees provided by users in which the
drawing tree program uses the ATVtree [49];
5. Visualization of detailed text alignments results;
6. Capability to export the visualization results to portable
image files.
In what follows, we will introduce the characteristics and
functionality of SinicView in more detail.
Manipulative operations in SinicView
SinicView offers a series of manipulative and navigational
controls, such as zooming, shifting, and gap/annotation
toggling. As shown in Figure 1, SinicView displays the
alignment results obtained by three different MSA meth-

ods. The input sequences contain the orthologous regions
around the Stem Cell Leukemia (SCL) gene in five vertebrate species: human, mouse, chicken, pufferfish and
zebrafish. The buttons and text-field boxes of manipulative functions are located on top of the frame. Users can
manually input numerical values or click on the highlighted colored region in the Global View section that
specifies the zooming or shifting factors in a drag-anddrop fashion. When the highlighted region is clicked and
dragged, the equivalent of a shift action will be performed
and the display region can be resized by adjusting the edge
of the highlighted area.
SinicView can display more than one alignment result
obtained by different alignment programs (either pairwise or multiple ones.) The assorted mixed-color span
under the Global View panel shows among the alignment
tools used the preferred aligner, which generates comparatively better results on the spot. Each of the aligners is
denoted by a pre-defined color with the "performance
color" label right next to the name of the tool.

Figure 3

The detailed text display of the different alignment results. The matched identical sequences are labeled in red blocks.
Interestingly, all three results do not contain consistent matching alignments in this case.

Multi-panel functionality in SinicView
In the Detailed View section, the Percent Identity Plot
(PIP) panels show, from top to bottom, the similarity
curves of the alignment results obtained by different programs, along with the names of the alignment tools. In the
Information View section, the Gap & Annotation panels
(in pink and gray) display the information of annotations
provided by users, and gaps of aligned sequences. The
information and similarity ratios can also be displayed as
the current scan-line (i.e. cursor) moves. The boxes in
maroon denote the annotation area and the horizontal
line represents the original sequences interleaved with

inserted gaps (light gray areas.) The gap display can be
toggled on or off via the checkbox on the right.
Because different alignment results are usually of different
lengths, it is not plausible to compare these results basepair by base-pair. In SinicView, therefore, we let users
select one of input sequences as a reference and then calculate the sum-of-pair scores of each base pair in the reference within a fixed window. For example, each alignment
result in the PIP panels at the scan-line position corresponds to human sequence, selected as the reference in
Figure 1. When the user selects different sequences as the

reference, SinicView can demonstrate the variations
between the PIP curves of the alignment results.
Visualization of SinicView: comparison chart and textmode comparison
The functionality under the "Tools" menu, called "Comparison Charts", offers two types of charts for quick-andeasy evaluation of the alignment quality. The stacked bar
chart, in Figure 2, illustrates the distribution of the identical rates with the threshold over 40%. The pie chart, on
the other hand, displays the distribution of the identical
rates from 0 to 100 percent based upon a selected alignment program. The statistics on which these charts are
based can also be displayed in a tabulated text form.

SinicView also provides a plain-text view of the alignment
results in the Detailed View section when the sliding window size is less than 100 aligned base pairs. As shown in
Figure 3, the plain-text alignment results replace the percent identity curves and the fully identical bases in a column are labeled in red blocks. Thus, users can check the
correctness of detailed alignment results base pair by base
pair.
Installation and execution of the standalone SinicView
The applet version can be accessed via any JRE (Java Runtime Environment)-enabled browsers with Internet connection, thus making the installation and choosing the
right platform hassle-free. However, the ease of running
SinicView on-the-go cannot accommodate the bandwidth
requirement in case of huge amount of sequence data
involved. Hence, we have also implemented a standalone
application of SinicView, which is wrapped in JRE, for offline use.

The execution procedure of the standalone SinicView is
quite straightforward. Upon launch, the user will be
prompted three options. The first two are to read user's
Phylogenetic Tree files, an option, and MSA results from
the local disk.

Results
In what follows, we will introduce two examples to demonstrate how SinicView can assist users to analyze alignment results in the initial stage of sequence comparison.
The total alignment lengths in both of the examples are
few hundreds of thousands of base pairs and several millions of base pairs, respectively. The conservations of the
aligned sequences are different in each example. More
examples can be found in [50].
Example 1: SCL (Stem Cell Leukemia) gene
The Stem Cell Leukemia (SCL) gene plays a critical role in
normal processes that, when disrupted, can result in
leukemia. The SCL gene, also known as tal-1, encodes a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/103

basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is pivotal
for the normal development of all hematopoietic lineages, and is highly conserved between mammals and
zebrafish [51,52]. Previous analyses of the SCL genes in
five vertebrate genomes, including human, mouse,
chicken, pufferfish, and zebrafish, have revealed that the
SCL promoter/enhancer motifs are conserved in all five
species [51]. The alignment and visualization tools used
in their analyses included BLAST [53], PipMaker [45], and
DiAlign [54]. Shah et al. (2004) realigned these gene
regions in five species by a pairwise alignment tool,
LAGAN [20], and demonstrated the alignment result by
Phylo-VISTA [44]. In this paper, we also downloaded
these sequences and realigned them by the multiple alignment tools: ClustalW, MAVID and MLAGAN. The lengths
of the human, mouse, chicken, pufferfish, and zebrafish
sequences are approximately 100 kb, 65 kb, 67 kb, 22 kb,
and 8 kb, respectively.
Figure 4(a) shows the global view of the results obtained
by three alignment tools using the human sequence as the
reference. Generally speaking, the highest conserved
region located at 30 k bp of human sequence is all well
aligned by these three tools. But the highest identical rates
of the alignment by ClustalW are lower than those by
either MLAGAN or MAVID. Moreover, the total quantity
of the result obtained by MLAGAN is better than those by
both ClustalW and MAVID while the quantity of the result
obtained by ClustalW is better than those by the others, as
shown in Figure 4(b). Interestingly, when we selected the
zebrafish sequence as the reference, the result obtained by
ClustalW shows the highest conserved region located at
around 27.5 k bp whereas those by both MAVID and
MLAGAN show it at around 45.89 k bp, as shown in Figure 4(c). The comparison reveals that the region at around
27.5 k bp in the zebrafish sequence will be assumed the
homologous region by ClustalW. But according to MAVID
and MLAGAN, the homologous regions are located at
around 45.89 k bp rather than at 27.5 k bp. This ambiguous result may be caused by segmental duplication in the
sequences and by difference in alignment strategy. In this
case, more advanced or further inspections should be performed to either check the detailed alignment results in
both regions or realign these sequences by using other
pairwise or local alignment tools.
Example 2: The greater CFTR region
The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) gene is responsible for the cystic fibrosis disorder
that spans approximately 190 k bp of genomic DNA and
consists of 27 exons [55]. The greater CFTR region is
defined as a genomic segment of about 1.8 M bp on
human chromosome 7q31.3 containing the CFTR gene
and nine other genes, including TES1, CAV1, CAV2, MET,
CAPZA2, ST7, WNT2, GASZ, and CORTBP2 [12]. The

comparative analysis of this region in 13 vertebrate species has been reported in Thomas et al., 2003 [12] in
which the alignment tool used was BlastZ on PipMaker
Web server [45]. In this paper, we downloaded the

sequences of four mammalian species, including human,
baboon, dog, and mouse, from the NIH Intramural
Sequencing Center (NISC) Website [56]. However, the
original sequences had been updated in other genome

Browser. The lengths of these sequences are from 1.0 M bp

to 1.5 M bp. We realigned these sequences by MLAGAN,
MAVID, and TBA (kernel: MULTIZ) [24] and the total
number of bases of the final alignment results, including

gaps, are approximately 12 M bp, 11 M bp, and 7.5 M bp,
respectively.
Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the global PIP curves and their
detailed views of three alignment results, respectively. In
general, most of high identity regions are well and consistently aligned by these three programs. But those not as
high identities are not reported by TBA because the kernel
of this program, MULTIZ, is based on the local alignment
results by BlastZ. As shown in Figure 5(c), the stacked-bar
charts show the quality and the quantity of these alignment results where the average identical rates for TBA are
somewhat better than those for MLAGAN and MAVID
although the total number of aligned conserved regions
for MLAGAN is larger than those for the others.
For comparisons of these alignments from a functional
viewpoint, we downloaded the annotation of the human
sequence, including exons and repeats, from the Ensembl
Genome Browser [35]. The detailed comparisons of the
alignment results by different aligners demonstrated that
the alignments of noncoding regions are often inconsistent. But for the coding regions, the alignment results by
different aligners seem consistent and well-aligned.
Figures 6(a)â(b) show the detailed alignment results at
four different intervals. In Figure 6(a), we find that some
conserved regions are not aligned by TBA but identified by
MLAGAN and MAVID. This region is annotated by repeats
and implies that some repetitive elements were inserted
into these sequences of their common ancestor. However,
this conserved insertion event could not be observed by
using TBA. Although the kernel of TBA, MULTIZ, is known
not to align regions with repetitive elements, we still find
that some other regions with repetitive elements are
aligned by this program, as shown in Figure 6(b).

OK

OK

Generally speaking, the regions aligned by TBA usually
have higher identical rates than by others. As the frames
shown in red in Figures 6(c) and 6(d), the alignment of
these regions by TBA seems superior to those by others.
However, the kernel of TBA, MULTIZ, usually neglects to
align the regions with low conservations. Thus, some
lowly conserved regions may not be aligned by TBA.
Since each alignment tool has its own advantage and
reveals different alignment results, we therefore wonder
whether a better alignment result can be generated by
hybridization of these alignment tools.
Loading performance and platforms test
SinicView is implemented totally in Java. Theoretically, it
should be portable across different operating systems
(OSs) and platforms. To demonstrate interoperability on
real cases, we tested the applet and application versions of
SinicView on different platforms and OSs. As shown in
Table 1, both versions of SinicView seem to perform well.
Thus, users can use either the applet version or the standalone application of SinicView, according to their
requirements.

Besides, we also tested the loading performance of SinicView. Because the performance of an applet on the Web
is strongly dependent on the network bandwidth and traffic, the estimation of loading time may not be a fair comparison. Thus, in this part we only estimated the loading
performance of the standalone application of SinicView.
In general, the loading performance of a Java application
is dependent on the memory heap size. The default values
of the initial heap size and the maximum size of a Java Virtual Machine (java_1.4.2 version or higher) are 4 M
(mega) bytes and 64 M bytes, respectively. These values

Table 2: The loading performance of standalone SinicView The loading time of standalone SinicView by different sizes of input data
and initial and maximum memory heap sizes. The default value for the initial JVM heap size is 4 M bytes; maximum is 64 M bytes. For
the maximum 64 M byte heap size, the standalone SinicView can handle up to approximately 11 M byte alignment data. The
maximum value of the input data size is linear in the maximum heap size. We observe that the initial heap memory size has little
impact on the loading time. This result was benchmarked on a 3 GHz Pentium4 PC with 1 GB RAM.

java -Xms64m -Xmx128m -jar SinicView.jar,
where the parameters Xms64m and Xmx128m represent
that the initial heap size is 64 M bytes and the maximum
size is 128 M bytes, respectively. Thus, we used different
input data sizes, initial heap sizes, and the maximum sizes
to estimate the loading time of SinicView. As shown in
Table 2, using the default maximum heap size, 64 M
bytes, the standalone SinicView can handle up to approximately 11 M bytes alignment data. If the maximum size
is set up to 256 M bytes, the loading ability of input data
size could be over several dozens of mega bytes. Moreover, Table 2 shows that the maximum data size is dependent on the maximum heap size and the loading times are
linearly dependent on the sizes of input data. All performance test results were benchmarked on a 3 GHz Pentium4
PC with 1 GB RAM.

Discussion
Repetitive elements in sequence alignments
The eukaryotic genome is usually characterized by the
presence of repetitive DNA consisting of nucleotide
sequences of various lengths and compositions that occur
from a few times to thousands of times in the genome
either in tandem or in a dispersed fashion[57]. The repetitive fractions can be classified into two types of repeated
families: localized and dispersed [57,58]. Localized repetitive sequences usually occur as tandem arrays and they
are called tandem repetitive DNA. Dispersed repetitive
sequences are dispersed throughout the genome. In addition, there are moderately repetitive sequences, which are
usually transposable elements or processed pseudogenes
and are usually dispersed over the genome. Alu is the largest family of interspersed mobile elements (~300 bp) and
propagated to more than one million copies in primate

genomes. This type of repeat has been inserted into these
genomes within the last 65 million year period [58].
Because this type of repetitive elements only appears in
the primate genomes, when we align homologous
sequences of primate and non-primate genomic
sequences, these Alu inserted regions should not be
aligned. However, other interspersed elements may possibly have been inserted into the ancestral sequence of
mammalians. The regions of these repeats may be able to
align together between the sequences of different mammalians, as shown in Example 2. However, these regions
in the alignment results by different aligners are inconsistent. Since these repetitive elements in sequences could be
detected by RepeatMasker [59], the poorly aligned regions
may have to be checked whether they belong to repetitive
elements.
Comparative approach for alignment validity
As the comparison results using SinicView show, the
alignments of sequences using different MSA tools are
inconsistent. We begin to wonder whether the computational results obtained by different tools may in fact lead
to different findings. For identification of alignment correlation, a need for additional checks of alignment validity by using different tools and scoring systems has been
recognized in the literature [60]. Thus, a cross comparison
approach along with visualization could provide an efficient and easy way for general users to verify and validate
the alignment results as to whether the aligned regions are
reasonable and whether those poorly aligned regions are
indeed non-homologous.
How to decide on a "good" alignment result
Except evaluation of the alignment quality by comparison
charts in SinicView, how to decide on a good alignment
with biological meanings may need much more experiences and knowledge. Sometimes, this judgment depends
also on what kind of the biological problems users want

Page 11 of 15

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:103

to study. Here, we suggest some general rules for users to
judge the alignments by biological meanings.
In the coding regions, a triplet of adjacent nucleotides
constitutes a codon. Usually, the first two nucleotides are
identical between the two sequences and allow the third
one to be either identical or different. Thus, when the partial alignment results reveal the two-out-of-three regularity for each triplet, it may imply that the aligned regions
are potential coding regions. This alignment result should
be more biologically meaningful than those without the
two-out-of-three regularity.
From molecular evolutionary viewpoint, nature prefers
inserting or deleting considerable consecutive nucleotides
together to interspersed individual nucleotides [57]. Thus,
an alignment with consecutive gaps would be better than
those with interspersed gaps.
If one of the alignment sequences has been annotated, the
information is definitely useful for users to judge the
alignment results by different aligners.
Comparative environment to promote new alignment
tools
It is not easy to promote newly developed tools because
users usually cannot directly compare the new tools with
the traditional ones. With SinicView, users can compare
the alignment results obtained by different tools and
select an appropriate one for further analysis. Thus, if the
new tool can align more regions than those by the old
ones and can also indicate their statistical significances, it
will be welcomed and better received by the community.
We would like to make SinicView available to the community of computational biologists. In addition to helping
the user find a most appropriate alignment tool to use,
SinicView may also be used to check whether previously
obtained alignment results by different tools are worth a
re-investigation, and see if this revisit of alignment results
would lead to different conclusions.
Further possible enhancements for SinicView
The capability of fine-tuning parameters relevant to the
alignment process will be made available in a userfriendly interface. Furthermore, the ability to allow plugins of more alignment programs, in addition to the currently pre-selected ones, such as ClustalW, MAVID, MLAGAN, and GS-Aligner, will inevitably broaden the usage of
SinicView. The issue of the compatibility of the input and
output formats for each alignment tool also needs to be
resolved. For example, both MAVID and MLAGAN require
the phylogenetic tree data as input, but ClustalW does
not. The ordering of the outputs of these aforementioned
tools is usually switched without notice. Thus, to be able
to work under a unified comparison framework requires

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/103

further processing of these outputs. Besides, identifying a
standard-bearer mechanism is still a challenge in entrusting existing alignment programs. So far, we have used the
"sum-of-pairs" method to define the "identical rate" in
each alignment result. In the future, we may provide other
criteria for users to use to measure their alignment results,
in addition to what have been already provided in SinicView.

Conclusion
Deluged by the increasing number of completed genomic
sequences, biologists have encountered a challenge of
aligning more and much longer sequences from divergent
species. Thus, the need to align longer sequences, like
mega base-pair sequences or even genome-scale
sequences, and evaluate the alignment results becomes
more urgent. In this paper, we have presented a visualization tool for comparison of multiple sequence alignment
programs. With a standard simple protocol for the input/
output format, it is quite easy for users to upload their
own alignment programs to SinicView. The performance
of SinicView depends on the system's internal memory. In
a 64 M RAM JAVA environment, SinicView can load and
visualize several mega bases alignment results. Users can
easily perform sequence alignment by employing multiple alignment tools and visualize the results on the fly by
SinicView. More information can be found at [50].
