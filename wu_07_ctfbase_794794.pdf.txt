Abstract
Background: Comprehensive identification and classification of the transcription factors (TFs) in
a given genome is an important aspect in understanding transcriptional regulatory networks of a
specific organism. Cyanobacteria are an ancient group of gram-negative bacteria with strong
variation in genome size ranging from about 1.6 to 9.1 Mb and little is known about their TF
repertoires. Therefore, we constructed the cTFbase database to classify and analyze all the putative
TFs in cyanobacterial genomes, followed by genome-wide comparative analysis.
Description: In the current release, cTFbase contains 1288 putative TFs identified from 21 fully
sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. Through its user-friendly interactive interface, users can
employ various criteria to retrieve all TF sequences and their detailed annotation information,
including sequence features, domain architecture and sequence similarity against the linked
databases. Furthermore, cTFbase provides phylogenetic trees of individual TF family, multiple
sequence alignments of the DNA-binding domains and ortholog identification from any selected
genomes. Comparative analysis revealed great variability of the TF sequences in cyanobacterial
genomes. The high variance on the gene number and domain organization would be related to their
diverse biological functions and their adaptation to various environmental conditions.
Conclusion: cTFbase provides a centralized warehouse for comparative analysis of putative TFs
in cyanobacterial genomes. The availability of such an extensive database would be of great interest
for the community of researchers working on TFs or transcriptional regulatory networks in
cyanobacteria. cTFbase can be freely accessible at http://cegwz.com/ and will be continuously
updated when the newly sequenced cyanobacterial genomes are available.

Background
Deciphering and reconstructing gene transcriptional regulatory networks are important for better understanding

the fundamental cellular processes, such as cell division,
growth control and gene expression by which cells can
adapt to environment more effectively [1]. The most basic

components of transcriptional regulatory networks are
the transcription factors (TFs), TF binding sites at
upstream and downstream of the target genes and the target genes. Among them, TFs play the crucial role by
enhancing or inhibiting the target gene expression by
means of binding to the promoter sequences. Studies on
TFs are of extreme significance and can glean more information about the mechanism of transcriptional regulatory networks. Genome-wide analysis of completely
sequenced genomes have revealed that TFs account for a
large proportion of all encoded proteins [2-4]. Escherichia
coli was one of the best-studied organisms and was
revealed to have more than 271 TFs in its whole genome.
Despite the divergent domain organizations and sequence
identities, the TFs characterized to share a significant
degree of structural similarity of the DNA-binding
domain (DBD), which binds to the specific DNA region
[5]. TFs can be classified into several families based on
structure difference of DBD which include helix-turnhelix motif, Zinc fingers, Leucine zippers, and Basic-helixloop-helix, etc. Helix-turn-helix motif is the most common structure of DBD in prokaryotes [3,4,6]. Cyanobacteria are an ancient group of gram-negative bacteria,
which exhibit extraordinary diversity in physiological
properties, ecological niches and morphology [7]. They
survive in different environments, such as fresh and
marine waters and extreme conditions. Different member
of cyanobacteria shows a remarkable size variation ranging from about 1.6 to 9.1 Mb. For example, Prochlorococcus
sp. 1986 is only 1.75 Mb in genome size which is supposed to be one of the smallest genomes and most compact oxyphototrophic organisms discovered to date [8].
Nostoc punctiforme has a large genome size and complicated ecological niches which may suggest a relatively
sophisticated organization of this species [9]. Currently,
21 cyanobacterial genomes have been fully sequenced,
representing a wide range of species from unicellular to
filamentous ones. In addition, more than 20 members of
cyanobacteria are in the process of in-finishing or being
sequenced [10,11]. Such data resources undoubtedly provide an opportunity for genome-wide analysis of TFs in
cyanobacteria.
To date, only a few numbers of TFs in cyanobacteria have
been studied in detail. However, those studied provide
useful insights into the crucial roles of TFs in biology, and
further into their functions. NtcA, one of the extensively
studied TF that mediates global nitrogen control and regulates many genes involved in nitrogen assimilation, was
identified in all cyanobacteria [12]. FUR could regulate
iron assimilation and storage, and modulate the expression of genes involved in the response to different environmental stresses [13]. NtcB, another member of TFs,
was identified to activate nitrate assimilation [14]. In
order to make all the putative TFs in cyanobacteria availa-

ble to the scientific community and fill in the gap without
online databases, we present cTFbase, which will be a valuable resource for further research of TFs and transcriptional regulatory networks in cyanobacteria. Whole
genome comparative analysis revealed great variability of
the TFs in cyanobacterial genomes. The high variance on
the gene number and domain organization would be
related to their diverse biological functions and their
adaptation to various environmental conditions.

Construction and content
Collection of TFs
The amino acid sequences of the protein-encoding genes
of 21 cyanobacterial genomes were retrieved from the
IMG database (version 2.0). A number of bioinformatics
tools were used to identify the TFs (Fig. 1). The identification process included searching candidate TFs and their
verification. In the first step, three different methods were
performed to collect all possible TFs: (1) DBD assignment
by the SUPERFAMILY database (release 1.69) and Pfam
database (version 21.0)[15,16]. Varieties of DBDs were
extracted from both two databases. The hmmpfam program in the HMMER package [17] was used to predict the
domain(s) of a query protein sequence and those
sequences with an E-value below 0.01 were selected; (2)
BLAST search. An initial set of well characterized putative
TFs was obtained from the Swiss-prot/TrEMBL databases
(release 10.0) by a keyword search on the ExPASy molecular Biology server [18]. BLASTP searches were performed
using this set as a query with E-value < 1E-10. The searches
were iterated until no newly retrieved sequences belonged
to TF; (3) Scanning for helix-turn-helix motif. This process
is completed by the program Helixturnhelix implemented
in EMBOSS with the default parameters [19]. Results
obtained by above three methods were combined, and
duplicate records, which were identified on the basis of
locus tags, were removed. In the second step all the candidate TFs were manually checked and the false-positives
were removed based on domain assignment and sequence
similarity against main databases, such as Swiss-prot
(release 52.0) and Refseq (release 22). This work focuses
mainly on specific TFs that bind various regulatory elements. Hence, some general TFs, such as sigma factor,
which binds the core promoter of a gene, were also
excluded. Finally, we identified 1288 putative TFs from 21
cyanobacterial genomes, among which 404 genes have
not been annotated as transcriptional factor (including
neither shown the function of regulation, nor possessing
the helix-turn-helix motif) in its original annotation in the
IMG database. Some transcription factor databases such
as DBD also identified TFs from cyanobacterial genomes
[20]. However, we found more TFs (1288 items) from 21
cyanobacterial genomes than DBD database (version 2.0,
947 items) that was based on 17 genomes. Even if we
compared the TFs from these 17 shared genomes, there

are a number of discrepancies between them. First, DBD
method [20] aimed to collect all the proteins containing
DNA binding domain, which are sometimes not necessarily involved in the regulation of gene expression, such as
transposase, integrase, recombinase, or methyltransferase.
We found 191 curated TFs from the shared 17 genomes
that are not present in DBD database, and meanwhile
DBD also identified 128 putative TFs, which were considered as to be possible false positives in our method.
Detailed information can be found from the introduction
section of website. Second, DBD database was based on
domain assignments from the SUPERFAMILY and PFAM
HMM libraries, and predicted TFs from all eubacteria
(including cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic organisms
using the same benchmark. Here, several independent
methods as described above were applied to identify TFs
from cyanobacterial genomes, and special attention was
paid to those hypothetical proteins and cyanobacterialspecific proteins.
Implementation and web interface
The popular MySQL backend was used as the database
machine to store the results. Web interfaces for database

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/104

browsing and the browse result pages were developed
using PHP scripts. Through the cTFbase web system, the
following main functionalities are implemented in the
current release:
(1) To browse domain architectures of TFs. The repertoire
of TFs can be browsed and the domain architectures can
be viewed from a selected genome. It can also show the
special TF families and their related domain architectures
in one or all the cyanobacterial genomes;
(2) To identify the orthologs from the selected genomes.
The results of orthology relationships from multiple species was previously performed using the program
OrthoMCL [21];
(3) To browse the phylogeny of individual TF family.
Using the neighbor joining method, the phylogenetic tree
for each of the TF families was constructed based on the
whole TF sequences. The reasons for using the whole
sequences of TFs instead of their DBD motifs to perform
phylogenetic analysis was that the sequence of DBD motif
in specific family is well conserved and the length is quite

short, which may lead to very few deep nodes supported
by high bootstrap values;
(4) To search the database via protein ID, species or family;
(5) To perform a BLAST-based sequence similarity search.
Users can search their target sequences or identify
homologs in the database;
(6) To perform sequence alignment. The sequence alignment tool, MUSCLE [22], was implemented to enable
users to align amino acid sequences of DBDs within the
specific families;
(7) To link some useful references, including literatures
and databases;
(8) To download one (or all) specific TF sequence(s),
including proteins and/or their corresponding DNA
sequences, and phylogenetic trees in phylip format.
Furthermore, each entry provides the sequence itself and
detailed annotations, including basic information,
domain architecture assigned by Pfam database (version
21.0) and SUPERFAMILY database (release 1.69) and
sequence similarity against major databases (PDB collected by 11-March-2007, Swiss-prot release 52.0, Refseq
release 22 and DBD version 2.0). Through links to inner
section and other databases, it would be a platform in
which information on putative TFs in cyanobacteria has
highly integrated and will be a centralized warehouse for
the comparative genomic analysis. We expect that this
database will help to further understand the transcriptional regulatory networks of microbiology.

number of TFs in fresh water or soil cyanobacteria is still
significantly higher than that in marine cyanobacteria
(Fig. 2). Similar results were also found in the cyanobacterial signal transduction and restriction-modification system [24,25]. Fresh water or soil is considered as a less
stable environment than a marine ecosystem, with drastic
changes of temperature and light, abundant but inconstant nutrient resources and more potential hazards.
Therefore, the genome of fresh water or soil species
encodes multiple capabilities in order to survive in this
unstable environment and to have a long-term selective
advantage. TF should be one of such capabilities, because
it is essential for organisms to control the expression of
the target gene(s) to adapt for the environmental changes
effectively. For example, Nostoc punctiforme, a filamentous
nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, displays an extraordinarily wide range of developmental alternatives in vegetative
cell, physiological properties, and ecological niches,
including broad symbiotic competences with plants and
fungi [9]. Within its genome, a total of 172 putative TFs
were identified, representing the most abundant in all
sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. On the other hand,
Prochlorococcus, living in the oligotrophic open ocean and
regarded as one of the most compact oxyphototrophic
organisms [26], possesses a limited number of putative
TFs (usually less than 30). It is assumed that the main
driving force behind genome reduction within the
Prochlorococcus is radiation, which has been the selective
process favoring the adaptation of this organism to its
environment [27,28].
Several recent studies showed that many TFs from both
eukaryotes and prokaryotes contain additional domains
with distinct functions [5,29]. In support of this, a large

Utility and discussion
Comparison of TFs among different species of
cyanobacteria
Different from other prokaryotes, cyanobacteria exhibit
extraordinary diversities in physiology, ecological niches
and morphology. Genome-wide analysis of TFs undoubtedly helps to understand the relationship between cyanobacterial TF composition and their environmental
adaptation. Here, we found that the cyanobacteria living
in fresh water or soil has a larger amount of putative TFs
comparing to those living in marine water (The distribution of TFs in these 21 cyanobacterial genomes can be
seen in the statistics section of website). Given that the
genome size of the fresh water or soil cyanobacteria is
much larger than those of the marine species and it is well
known that growth in bacterial genome size is accompanied with the accumulation of paralogous protein families [23], we then calculated the relative number of TFs in
cyanobacteria. The results demonstrate that the relative

number of TFs were found to possess at least one other
domain besides DBDs among all the putative TFs in
cyanobacteria (Fig. 3). These additional domains imply
that these TFs might have other functions, which, in some
cases, were actually verified by the experimental
approaches [5,30]. Several TFs carry binding domains for
various substrates or ligands, such as cNMP_binding
(cyclic nucleotide-binding domain), LysR_substrate (LysR
substrate binding domain), Ada_Zn_binding (metal
binding domain of Ada), Fer4 (iron-sulfur cluster binding
domain), PAS and GAF. Several TFs encompass enzyme
domains with predicted catalytic roles, for example,
Aminotran_1_2 (aminotransferase class I and II), GGDEF
(diguanylate cyclase activity), HATPase_c (histidine
kinase-like ATPases), HisKA (histidine kinase domain),
Peptidase_S24 (peptidase family S24), Hpt (histidinecontaining phosphotransfer domain) and CbiC (precorrin-8X methylmutases). Otherwise, two kinds of repetitive
domains (WD40 and TPR), which are generally responsible for protein-protein interactions, were also found to be
associated with DBDs. It this study, however, we also
observation that nearly all of the uncommon domain
organizations were identified in the genomes of the fresh
water or soil cyanobacteria. Although it still needs further
proof, our observation suggests that the cyanobacteria living in fresh water or soil tend to have more complex
domain organizations of TFs in comparison with those in
marine species. The GntR family is an example for this
case. The most typical characteristic of this family is that it
consists of a single DBD named GntR at N-terminal. In
fresh water or soil cyanobacteria, GntR is also fused to several other domains, such as aminotran_1_2, UTRA and
FCD. Furthermore, a number of putative TFs (in AraC,
CopG, GerE, OmpR or Crp families) with uncommon
domain combinations that just appeared in fresh water or
soil cyanobacteria are fused to domains involved in signal
transduction (including PAS, GAF, Hpt, GGDEF HisKA
and HATPase_c). One possible explanation could be that
these phenomena are likely to be the results of the fresh
water or soil cyanobacteria's efficient response to the
physiological and environmental changes during longterm evolution.
Furthermore, we found that there were 12 putative TF
families were present in all cyanobacterial genomes.
Among them, four families (BolA, DUF387, SfsA and
DnaA) have nearly the same gene copies over the
genomes, which highlight the fundamental importance of
these families. They are presumably very ancient families
shared by the most recent common ancestor of cyanobacteria and may have not undergone lineage-specific expansions/loss or horizontal gene transfer. The remaining
eight families (OmpR, GerE, Crp, LysR, arsR, FUR, GntR,
Bac_DNA_binding) exhibit different distribution patterns
among various species. However, we found that a variety

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/104

of orthologous TFs in these families formed monophyletic
clades, which were strongly supported by their high bootstrap values (nearly 100% in several clades) of the constructed
phylogenetic
trees
mentioned
above
(phylogenetic trees could be queried on the website).
Within the families of FUR, Crp, LysR and GntR, only one
such branch is found, whereas two branches are observed
in GerE and OmpR phylogenies, respectively. ArsR and
Bac_DNA_binding phylogenies, however, do not have
any such branches. Previously, Brune et al. [2] and
Moreno-Campuzano et al. [31] identified the conserved
TFs among Corynebacterium and Firmicutes, respectively.
Here, we for the first time defined a minimal core of conserved TFs in cyanobacteria: the putative TFs in these nine

branches plus these four TF families mentioned above
(BolA, DUF387, SfsA and DnaA). These "universal" putative TFs mediate the functions of response regulators of
two-component systems (OmpR, GerE), global nitrogen
control (Crp), cell-cycle regulation (BolA), sugar fermentation (SfsA), chromosomal replication initiating and regulating
(DnaA),
general
metabolism
(GntR),
chromosome condensation and segregation (DUF387),
iron homeostasis control (FUR), CO2 fixation (LysR) and
so on. As the physiological function of most TFs in cyanobacteria is still unknown, this identified core set of conserved TFs might thus provide some guidance for further
investigations.

Conclusion
Currently, the cTFbase is limited to 21 cyanobacterial
genomes retrieved from IMG database and works as a centralized warehouse for the comparative genomic analysis
of putative TFs in cyanobacteria. Without regular update,
however, the database would quickly lose its advantages.
Therefore, we prepared to update its data on a regular
basis and our update policy is mainly based on following
three cases. First, the repertoire of TFs will be identified
and integrated into the database when newly completed
or draft cyanobacterial genomes are available. Second,
novel TFs verified by experiments will be also added into
the cTFbase. We encourage users to submit new TFs to our
database through the interactive web interface. Third, cTFbase will be updated periodically according to main databases, such as the Pfam and SUPERFAMILY database. Any
questions, comments and suggestions will be welcome,
which will be a useful feedback for future updating.
