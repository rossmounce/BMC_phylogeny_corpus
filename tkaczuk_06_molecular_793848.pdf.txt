Abstract
Background: Recently, HEN1 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana was discovered as an essential
enzyme in plant microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. HEN1 transfers a methyl group from Sadenosylmethionine to the 2'-OH or 3'-OH group of the last nucleotide of miRNA/miRNA*
duplexes produced by the nuclease Dicer. Previously it was found that HEN1 possesses a
Rossmann-fold methyltransferase (RFM) domain and a long N-terminal extension including a
putative double-stranded RNA-binding motif (DSRM). However, little is known about the details
of the structure and the mechanism of action of this enzyme, and about its phylogenetic origin.
Results: Extensive database searches were carried out to identify orthologs and close paralogs of
HEN1. Based on the multiple sequence alignment a phylogenetic tree of the HEN1 family was
constructed. The fold-recognition approach was used to identify related methyltransferases with
experimentally solved structures and to guide the homology modeling of the HEN1 catalytic
domain. Additionally, we identified a La-like predicted RNA binding domain located C-terminally
to the DSRM domain and a domain with a peptide prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) fold, but
without the conserved PPIase active site, located N-terminally to the catalytic domain.
Conclusion: The bioinformatics analysis revealed that the catalytic domain of HEN1 is not closely
related to any known RNA:2'-OH methyltransferases (e.g. to the RrmJ/fibrillarin superfamily), but
rather to small-molecule methyltransferases. The structural model was used as a platform to
identify the putative active site and substrate-binding residues of HEN and to propose its
mechanism of action.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt), single-stranded,
noncoding RNAs that have recently emerged as important
regulatory factors during growth and development in
Eukaryota. To date, miRNAs were described in animals,
plants, and viruses (reviews: [1-3]). miRNAs are processed
from longer precursor RNAs transcribed by RNA polymer-

ase II that form stem-loop structures, in which the mature
miRNAs reside in the stems. In animals, long primary
transcripts (pri-miRNAs) are first cropped in the nucleus
by an RNase-III homolog Drosha to release the hairpin
intermediates (pre-miRNAs) in the nucleus. Following
their export to the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subjected
to the second processing step, which is carried out by

another RNase III homolog Dicer. In plants that lack Drosha, it has been suggested that miRNA processing is executed by Dicer-like protein 1 (DCL1, also called CARPEL
FACTORY or CAF) (reviews: [4,5]). miRNAs down-regulate gene expression by binding to complementary
mRNAs and either triggering mRNA elimination or arresting mRNA translation into protein. Thus far, miRNAs
have been implicated in the control of several pathways,
including developmental timing, haematopoiesis, organogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation and possibly even
tumorigenesis (reviews: [6-8]). However, the mechanisms
of miRNA generation and function are still poorly understood and the molecular details are only beginning to be
revealed.

homolog when it was discovered [10]. Thus, apart from
generic features common to all MTases, the molecular
mechanism of specific interactions of HEN1 with its substrate RNA remains unknown. In particular, the threedimensional structure, the identity of potential catalytic
and substrate-binding residues, and the phylogenetic origin of HEN1-CTD have not yet been inferred. We have
therefore carried out bioinformatics analyses to collect the
possibly most complete set of HEN1 orthologs in current
sequence databases as well as to identify closest paralogs
amongst MTases with known structure and mechanism of
action. The results were used to construct a tertiary model
of the catalytic domain of HEN1 and to predict the architecture of the substrate-binding region and the active site.

HEN1 was identified as a gene that plays a role in the specification of stamen and carpel identities during the flower
development in Arabidopsis thaliana [9]. Mutations in
HEN1 resulted in similar defects to those observed for
mutations in CAF, suggesting that they are both involved
in miRNA metabolism [10]. Recently, it was found that
the product of HEN1 is a methyltransferase (MTase) that
acts on miRNA duplexes in vitro and methylates the last
nucleotide of both strands in the substrate [11]. It was
found that the methylation by HEN1 protects plant miRNAs against the 3'-end uridylation and the subsequent
degradation [12]. Both the 2'-OH and 3'-OH groups of
ribose on the last nucleoside were found to be essential
for methylation by the HEN1 protein, hence they are both
considered as the possible methylation sites, they may
also play a crucial role in the process of substrate recognition [11]. The 2'-OH group is the most commonly methylated target in RNA, while 3'-methylated ribonucleosides
have not been identified [13]. However, it remains to be
determined which of the OH groups of the last nucleoside
of the miRNA/miRNA* duplex is the target of methylation
by HEN1. Of note, HEN1 and its homologs analyzed in
this article are completely unrelated to a human gene
HEN1 that encodes a 20-kDa neuron-specific DNA-binding polypeptide (pp20HEN1) with the basic helix-loophelix (bHLH) motif.

Results and discussion

HEN1 is a long protein (942 aa), which was found to
comprise a putative double-stranded RNA-binding motif
(DSRM) in the very N-terminus and a C-terminal domain
(CTD, aa ~694–911), which exhibits significant similarity
to a group of uncharacterized protein from bacteria, fungi,
and metazoa [10]. These proteins are however much
shorter – they lack the DSRM and the long central region
of HEN1. HEN1-CTD was found to be related to the Rossmann-fold MTase (RFM) superfamily, suggesting that it is
responsible for the RNA MTase activity of this protein
[14]. It is noteworthy that sequences of HEN1 and its
homologs are so strongly diverged from other proteins
that initially HEN1 was not recognized as a MTase

Sequence analyses of HEN1
In order to identify orthologs of A. thaliana HEN1, we
used its full-length sequence as a query to search the nonredundant (nr) protein database using PSI-BLAST [15] as
well as genomic databases using tBLASTn [16]. A complete homologous sequences with significant similarity to
the entire query was found only in Oryza sativa (gi:
50510095). We also searched the EST and genomic databases using tBLASTn [16] and found sequences from several different plant species that covered various segments
of the query, but from which we could not assemble any
contiguous fragment that would cover the full-length protein. Only the HTG sequence from Lotus corniculatus var.
japonicus (gi: 17736840) displayed similarity to the
entire query sequence, but we decided to omit it from further analyses due to uncertainties in positions of intronexon boundaries (data not shown).

To identify domains in the primary structure of HEN1, we
carried out an RPS-BLAST search of the CDD database of
conserved domain alignments [17], which confirmed the
presence of the N-terminal DSRM, albeit with low score
(e-value 0.73, only 67.6% aligned) and the C-terminal
RFM domain (aa 690–940; best match to the UbiG MTase
family, e-value 6*10-05), but did not reveal any new
domains in the large central region. Therefore, we divided
the HEN1 sequence into a set of overlapping sequence
fragments < 500 aa and submitted it to the GeneSilico
protein structure prediction MetaServer [18] to carry out
predictions of secondary structure, protein order/disorder
and possible three-dimensional folds (see Methods for
details). Fragments of 100–200 aa with apparent similarity to conserved domains were resubmitted as individual
jobs.
Figure 1 summarizes the results of the primary structure
analysis of HEN1. The fold-recognition (FR) analysis supported the presence of the DSRM in the N-terminus (aa 1–
90) with significant scores (e.g. INBGU score 128.54,

PCONS2 score 1.974). Interestingly, immediately next to
the C-terminus of the DSRM (aa 91–200) we detected
another putative RNA-binding domain, namely the La
domain (a member of the wHTH fold) (PCONS2 score:
1.669). It is noteworthy that the founding member of the
La family specifically recognizes the 3'-OH group of a
poly-U end of RNA polymerase III transcripts [19], suggesting that the La domain in HEN1 could be involved in
the recognition of the 3'-OH group in the miRNA/
miRNA* duplex. In the region preceding the catalytic
domain (aa ~530–680), we identified a domain homologous to the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase)
family, confidently aligned by all FR servers to the FK506binding protein (FKBP) structure (e.g. PCONS2 score:
1.629). PPIases alter the orientation of peptide chains at
proline residues, thereby aiding proper protein folding
[20]. FKBP also participates in silencing and exhibits histone chaperone activity, but its PPIase domain was found
not to be essential for this function [21]. The FKBP-like
superfamily includes also the C-terminal domain of the
GreA transcript cleavage factor, a protein that acts by
inducing hydrolytic cleavage of the transcript within the
RNA polymerase, followed by release of the 3'-terminal
fragment [22]. However, it has been inferred that GreA
binds RNA using its N-terminal domain, while the C-terminal domain participates in protein-protein interactions
with the polymerase [23]. The predicted PPI-like domain
in HEN1 lacks the typical PPIase active site, in particular
the aromatic residue that provides a platform for binding
of the proline and Tyr residue that coordinates the substrate (e.g. W59 and Y82 in FKBP12). Thus, the function
of the PPI-like domain in HEN1 remains to be determined
experimentally. Finally, we predict that the central region
of HEN1 (aa 201–529) exhibits a pattern of helices and
strands typical for well-folded globular domains; however, we were unable to identify its relationship to any
known structures or conserved protein families.
To study the origin of the HEN1 enzyme, we carried out
additional searches of the non-redundant sequence database using only HEN1-CTD (aa 694–911), with a stringent e (expectation) value threshold of 10-20. The search
converged in the 4th iteration, revealing a family of
sequences with well-conserved regions along the entire
sequence. All sequences with scores below that threshold

were reported with significantly shorter alignments and a
preliminary visual analysis suggested that they lacked
many of the residues apparently conserved among the
close homologs of HEN1, they were also annotated as
involved in distinct processes (typically – methylation of
quinones), hence they were regarded as potential paralogs.
For the purpose of analyzing the orthologs of HEN1-CTD,
all sequences reported with the e-values better than the
threshold of 10-20 were retrieved and automatically
aligned using MUSCLE [24]. This initial alignment was
refined manually (as described in Methods) to remove
redundant sequences. Members of sequences from different phylogenetic lineages (see below) were used as queries
in additional tBLASTn searches of the dbEST database and
of finished and unfinished genomes, to identify additional members of the HEN1 family and also to refine
some of the sequences from the initial alignment, which
seemed to exhibit deletions due to overlooked exons etc.
The final set comprised 46 sequences, including 25 members from Metazoa, 4 from Fungi, 11 from Viridiplantae,
and 6 from Bacteria. Figure 2 shows the final multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) of the HEN1 family, which
was refined based on the results of structure prediction
and evaluation of the sequence-structure fit on the threedimensional level (see below).
To identify closest paralogs (and potential ancestors) of
HEN1, we converted the multiple sequence alignment of
the HEN1 family into a profile-Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) using HHpred [25] and we compared it with similar profile-HMMs pre-calculated for protein families collected in the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG)
database [26]. Interestingly, HHpred analysis suggested
that the closest relatives of HEN1 are not MTases acting on
nucleic acids, but enzymes acting on small molecules. The
top three matches that obtained significantly higher similarity scores than other families, were: COG2227 (UbiG,
"2-polyprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol methylase"; reported with e-value: 3.1*10-24),
COG2230 ("cyclopropane fatty acid synthase and related
methyltransferases", reported with probability evalue:1.8*10-21), and COG2226 (UbiE, "methylase
involved in ubiquinone/menaquinone biosynthesis",

at the top positions of the ranking.
From the results of the aforementioned PSI-BLAST search
queried with the HEN1-CTD we retrieved additional
sequences reported with e-values 10-20-10-30. We also carried out PSI-BLAST searches for all five aforementioned
closest paralogs of HEN1 to retrieve all or at least a substantial fraction of members of these lineages. We combined all these sequences with HEN1 orthologs and after
removing duplicates found by more than one search, we

clustered them based on the pair-wise BLAST similarity
scores using CLANS [27]. We tried different P-value
thresholds and found that the value of 10-5 produced bestresolved sequence "clans" corresponding to different
COGs (with very strong connections within each clan and
preferred connections between a few, but not all clans).
Figure 3 shows that the HEN1 clan is connected most
strongly to the UbiG clan (COG2227), mostly via the bacterial members of the HEN1 family. In agreement with the
results, the two next neighbors, closely related to UbiG,
are UbiE (COG2226) and CFA (COG2230), while TAM

dently more distantly related. Thus, the catalytic domain
of HEN1 appears to be a close relative of quinone MTases
and related small-molecule modifying enzymes (with
UbiG being the closest detectable paralogous family) and
only a remote homolog of other nucleic acid MTases.
Phylogenetic analysis of HEN1-CTD
The distribution of HEN1 family members among different phyla is quite unusual, suggesting that interesting
insights into its origin may be obtained from the inference
of its evolutionary history. Thus, based on the alignment
we calculated phylogenetic trees of the HEN1 family using
several different methods. Unfortunately, all traditional
approaches, including the neighbor-joining, maximum
parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods failed to
produce a tree with well-resolved branches and without

erratic grouping of sequences from distantly related species, possibly due to the long branch attraction (data not
shown). Therefore, we decided to study relationships
within the HEN1 family using methods that infer a
"fuzzy" picture of possible evolutionary connections. Figure 4 shows the phylogenetic tree of the HEN1 family generated with SPLITSTREE, using the split decomposition
method [28]. The largest branch comprises most of the
Metazoan members of the HEN1 family (including Craniata, Urochordata, Insecta, Arachnida, and Hydrozoa) with
the exception of Nematoda. The branch comprising members of three Caenorhabditis species (C. elegans, C. remanei,
and C. briggsae) groups together with Viridiplantae, but
seems to be connected to the main Metazoan cluster by
the intermediate location of Trichuris muris. Other main
branches are formed by Viridiplantae, Bacteria, and Fungi,

with the exception of Schizosaccharomyzes pombe, whose
position is unresolved.
We have also analyzed similarities within the HEN1 family by clustering them with CLANS [27]. We have experimentally found that the P-value threshold of 10-22
produced qualitatively best results. More stringent values
caused disconnection of the most diverged sequences,
while more permissive values, such as 10-5 used earlier for
the analysis of relation of HEN1 to other COGs, caused
over-compaction of the whole dataset into a single cluster
with only a few outliers. Figure 5 shows a representative
2D projection of "sequence clans" obtained after several
independent minimizations, starting with random distribution of sequences. This analysis reproduced all the
groupings corresponding to taxons outlined by the split
decomposition method, but also revealed additional
meaningful associations. Craniata, Urochordata, Insecta,
Hydrozoa, and Arachnida form a single central cluster,
surrounded by clusters of Viridiplantae, Fungi, Nematoda,
and Bacteria. Interestingly, this analysis revealed association of S. pombe SPBC336.05c with other fungal members
of the HEN1 family (C. neoformans, U. maydis and P. chrys-

osporium). The nematode T. muris appears much closer to
the central cluster than sequences from Caenorhabditis.
This suggests that the Caenorhabditis branch underwent
accelerated evolution and explains that its peculiar grouping with Viridiplantae in the SplitsTree reconstruction
(Figure 3) may be due to the "long branch attraction" artifact. Bacteria form a well-resolved, dense cluster, located
relatively close to the central metazoan cluster, but with
connections also to fungal and plant clusters. Finally, the
plant cluster comprises the main part (including A. thaliana HEN1) and three outliers, Lactuca sativa
(GI:22444817), Gossypium raimondii (GI: 48823357), and
Triticum turgidum (GI: 39729852).
The relationships between different eukaryotic lineages of
HEN1 are in general agreement with the topology of the
"Tree of Life". In Fungi they are present both in Basidiomycota (e.g. U. maydis) and Ascomycota (e.g. S. pombe),
but they appear to have been lost from many lineages, e.g.
Saccharomycotina. It is noteworthy that HEN1 orthologs
could not be detected in Archaea or in primitive Eukaryota
with fully sequenced genomes, such as Alveolata (e.g.
Plasmodium) or Euglenozoa (e.g. Trypanosoma). On the

other hand, the distribution of HEN1 homologs in Bacteria is very limited and quite erratic (only in Firmicutes –
Clostridium and Streptococcus, Cyanobacteria – Nostoc and
Anabaena and Actinobacteria – Kineococcus radiotolerans).
This distribution would suggest that HEN1 originated in
the common ancestor of Eukaryota, before the divergence
of the Viridiplantae and Metazoa/Fungi branches, and has
been transferred horizontally to Bacteria. However, the
sequences of bacterial members of the HEN1 family
appear to be more similar to the closest paralogous family
UbiG than the eukaryotic members (Figure 3). This suggests that HEN1-CTD could have evolved in Bacteria by
duplication of the UbiG-encoding gene and neofunctionalization of the second copy and only then was horizontally transferred to the ancestor of contemporary
Eukaryota. In order to fully understand the origin of
HEN1, it will be useful to characterize the molecular function of the short forms (lacking the N-terminal extensions
of A. thaliana HEN1) from Bacteria as well as from other
eukaryotic species (in particular animals and fungi).
Structure prediction of the HEN1-CTD
In the absence of an experimentally determined protein
structure, comparative modeling may provide a structural
platform for the investigation of sequence-structure-function relationships. This technique requires a homologous
template structure to be identified and the sequence of the
modeled protein (a target) to be correctly aligned to the
template. The C-terminal catalytic domain of HEN1
showed distant similarity to many different structures of
class-I MTases in standard database searches. It is known,
however, that despite the common fold and conserved
cofactor-binding site, different subfamilies of MTases
exhibit significant differences in the architecture of their
substrate-binding pocket and the active site (e.g. ref.
[29,30]). Thus, modeling of HEN1 based on a randomly
selected MTase structure could introduce large errors in
the functionally most important parts of the protein and
mislead the structure-based functional predictions.

In order to identify the optimal set of template structures
for modeling of HEN1, we used the fold-recognition (FR)
approach, which allows to assess the compatibility of the
target sequence with the available protein structures based
not only on the sequence similarity, but also on the structural considerations (match of secondary structure elements, compatibility of residue-residue contacts, etc.). As
mentioned earlier, the sequence of HEN1 CTD was therefore submitted to the GeneSilico protein fold-recognition
metaserver [18]. As expected, all FR methods reported
RFM structures as the potentially best templates. Interestingly, none of them reported any of the known RNA:2'OH MTase structures from the RrmJ/fibrillarin superfamily [31] or actually, any known RNA or DNA MTases,
on top positions of the ranking. Instead, all FR algorithms

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/6

suggested that the potentially best templates for modeling
of HEN1 (i.e. its closest homologs among proteins of
known structure) are either known small-molecule
MTases or uncharacterized proteins from the structural
genomics projects, which show strongest similarity to
small-molecule MTases. In particular, PDB-BLAST
reported 1 kpg (a mycolic acid cyclopropane synthase
Cmaa1 from Mycobacterium) with the score of 2*10-42,
FFAS [32] reported 1xxl (an uncharacterized protein YcgI
from Bacillus subtilis) with the score of: -44.1, mGENTHREADER [33] reported 1xxl with the score of 0.949,
SPARKS [34] reported 1vl5 (an uncharacterized protein
Bh2331 from Bacillus halodurans) and 1y8c (an uncharacterized, predicted MTase from Clostridium acetobutylicum)
with the score of -4.42 (these scores are not normalized as
each server uses a different evaluation system; see the individual references for details). Ultimately, the consensus
server Pcons2 [35] assigned highest scores (2.673-2.42) to
the small-molecule MTase structures 1xxl, 1vl5, and 1 kpg,
as potentially best templates for modeling of HEN1. This
result is in very good agreement from the profile-HMM
analysis, which suggested that HEN1 is most closely
related to small-molecule MTase families, including those
with unknown structures such as UbiE and UbiG (which
are thus unavailable for detection by the structure-based
FR). Thus, bioinformatics analyses strongly suggests that
HEN1 CTD exhibits sequence and structural features characteristic for the "small molecule" branch of the MTase
superfamily.
Comparative modeling of the HEN1-CTD
A comparative model of HEN1 was constructed based on
the alignments reported by fold-recognition methods,
using the "FRankenstein's Monster" approach [36](see
Methods). The C-terminal residues 912–942 were predicted to be disordered by DISOPRED [37] and PONDR
[38] (data not shown), and therefore they were omitted
from the analysis. The final model comprising residues
694–911 was constructed by iterating the homology modeling procedure (initially based on the raw FR alignments
to the top-scoring templates 1 kpg, 1vl5, 1y8c, and 1xxl),
evaluation of the sequence-structure fit by VERIFY3D,
merging of fragments with best scores, and local realignment in poorly scored regions. Local realignments were
constrained to maintain the overlap between the secondary structure elements found in the MTase structures used
as modeling templates, and predicted for HEN1. This procedure was stopped when all regions in the protein core
obtained acceptable VERIFY3D score (>0.3) or their score
could not be improved by any manipulations, while the
average VERIFY3D score for the whole model could not be
improved.

The refined alignment between HEN1 and the templates
is shown in Figure 6; the corresponding model obtained

the average VERIFY3D score of 0.352. Inspection of the
quality of the local structures using the COLORADO3D
server [39] revealed only one large region of poorly scoring residues: the insertion comprising aa 829–858 (data
not shown). This region is known to be variable in RFM
MTases (both on the sequence and the structure level) and
in the structures of many small-molecules solved to date
it was found to form a substrate-binding pocket. (J.M.B.,
L. Aravind, E.V. Koonin, unpublished data). Since template-based modeling of this insertion produced unsatisfactory models, we decided to model it de novo, using
ROSETTA [40,41]. The well-scored parts of the model (aa

region 829–859 was allowed to re-fold, using the
ROSETTA scoring function to identify physically sound,
low-energy conformations (see Methods for details). Figure 7 shows the superposition of representatives of the
five largest clusters (corresponding to the largest freeenergy minima), obtained from the analysis of 8000
ROSETTA decoys. The coordinates in the PDB format,
both for the initial model and for the alternative models
generated with ROSETTA are available as supplementary
data [see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Although the conformations of the region modeled de novo shows substantial differences, in all models they assume a partially
helical structure, which forms a wall of the potential substrate-binding site (see below). All analyzes of sequencestructure-function relationship described below, such as
the mapping of residue conservation onto the structure

were carried out for all five models. The results were qualitatively similar, hence for the sake of clarity we present
here the analysis for only the model with the best

Model-based identification of amino acid residues
important for substrate-binding and catalysis
Analysis of the sequence alignment of HEN1 homologs
(Figure 2) in the light of the model(s) reveals the functional role of conserved residues and suggests the potential mechanism of ligand-binding and catalysis (Figure 8).
Relatively easy to infer from the sequence alignment alone
is the binding site for the methyl group donor S-adenosylL-methionine (AdoMet), which is strongly conserved in
nearly all members of the RFM superfamily [42]. In HEN1
it comprises residues from motif I and the Gly-rich loop
(peptide 721-GCGSG-725), which provides the structural
framework for the binding pocket, motif II – D745 predicted to coordinate the 2' and 3'-OH groups of the ribose
moiety, and motif III – S778 predicted to coordinate the
N6 group of the adenine moiety. On the other hand, the
active site of RFM enzymes is typically conserved within
families, but not necessarily between families. Different
families often have different active sites, adequately to the
requirements of the reaction mechanism. For MTases acting on large molecules such as nucleic acids, the substratebinding site is even more difficult to predict, as it can vary
greatly even between members of the same family [42]. In
the absence of obvious close homologs with similar func-

tion (as it is in the case of HEN1), the structural context
greatly helps to infer the role of residues from motifs IVVIII.
The evolutionary information from the multiple sequence
alignment of HEN1 homologs was mapped onto the surface of the modeled HEN1 structure using the CONSURF
server [43]. Figure 9 reveals that conserved residues cluster
together in the cofactor-binding pocket, as well as in the
predicted substrate-binding site, formed by the common
motifs IV, VI, VIII, and the additional motif specific to
HEN1 (compare with Figure 2). Mapping of the electrostatic potential on the protein surface (Figure 10) reveals
that the conserved cofactor and substrate-binding pockets
are negatively-charged. On the other hand, there are adjacent positively charged patches on the HEN1 surface,
which may be involved in the binding of the negatively
charged RNA backbone, but they correspond to variable
region around motifs III and X. If A. thaliana HEN1 binds
its miRNA substrate using regions that are not conserved
among its orthologs, then its substrate specificity may be
different than that of other members of the HEN1 family.
However, highly conserved residues E796, E799, H800
(motif IV), H828, H832 (motif VI), and R858, H860
(HEN1-specific insertion) around the putative active site
suggest that at least the mechanism of methylation and
probably also the details of interactions with the methylated part of the substrate (e.g. the ribose ring) may be very
similar in all HEN1 homologs.

exposed part of motif IV of HEN1 at the bottom of the
putative substrate-binding pocket is characteristic for
small-molecule MTases. In particular, the peptide
EhhEHh, (where h indicates a hydrophobic or aromatic
residue) forms a small α-helix that is nearly perpendicular
to all other secondary structure elements, which is commonly found in small molecule MTases, but thus far has
not been identified in any nucleic acid MTase. Second, it
conforms to the consensus sequence XhhEHh found in
numerous small-molecule MTases, but is rather dissimilar
to motif IV of typical MTases acting on nucleic acids (e.g.
the (D/N/S)PP(Y/F/W/H) tetrapeptide of base MTases
[44] or the DXXX motif of ribose MTases [31]). However,
HEN1 contains an invariant Glu (E796) at the position
commonly occupied by a carboxylate residue that participates in catalysis in nucleic acid MTases (e.g. by stabilization of the cofactor and the target in the preferred
orientation and/or deprotonation of the substrate's
attacking group), but is rarely present in small-molecule
MTases.
The presumed catalytic pocket is also formed by conserved residues from motifs VI and X. Interestingly, the Nterminus of motif X in HEN1 reveals an invariant Arg residue (R701), which is located in a position similar to the
invariant Lys residue in "orthodox" ribose MTases (e.g.
K41 in VP39 or K38 in RrmJ). On the other hand, the surface-exposed C-terminal end of motif VI (located on the βstrand next to motif IV) is characterized by the pattern
TPNXE(F/Y)N, which bears no similarity to its counterparts in other MTase families. In particular, it does not
contain a Lys residue conserved and essential for catalysis

in "orthodox" ribose MTases (e.g. K175 in VP39), which
is proposed to position the hydroxyl oxygen toward the
cofactor methyl group [45,46]. Thus, the K-D-K triad of
residues from motifs X, IV, and VI found in "orthodox"
ribose MTases [29,45] is definitely not conserved in the
HEN1 family, although there is certain resemblance
between the chemical character of invariant residues
K175/D138 in VP39 and R701/E796 in HEN1.
Comparison of the putative active site of HEN1 with the
ribose MTases from the SPOUT superfamily is even more
difficult, as these proteins exhibit different folds and by
definition do not share any homologous residues. The catalytic mechanism of SPOUT MTases is also much less
understood than the mechanism of the RFM superfamily
members, in part because of the lack of structural information on enzyme-substrate interactions. Nonetheless,
several residues identified by the analysis of crystal structures and multiple sequence alignments have been found
to be indispensable for the ribose MTase activity [47-49].
In particular, it has been proposed that the invariant Arg
residue from one subunit in the SPOUT dimer (e.g. R145
in AviRb from S. viridochromogenes) is involved in steering
the 2'-OH group of the target ribose towards the cofactor
[48,49], in analogy to K175 in VP39 [46]. Here, we predict
an analogous role also for R701 in HEN1. Important for
the catalysis in SPOUT MTases are also two Asn residues
(N139 and N262 in AviRb) that probably make contacts
with the base of the methylated nucleoside. This role
could be fulfilled by T826 and/or N828 from motif VI in
HEN1.
Summarizing, we predict that the active site of HEN1
comprises R701 that orients the target hydroxyl group,
E796 that stabilizes the cofactor and/or aids in deprotonation of the attacking oxygen atom. Other invariant or
highly conserved residues of HEN1 such as T826 and/or
N828 may be involved in binding of other regions of the
substrate miRNA molecule (Figure 8). These predictions
can be tested by site-directed mutagenesis of the respective
residues.

Conclusion
It is remarkable that the predicted catalytic pocket of
HEN1 is different from the "K-D-K" active site triad of
known ribose 2'-O-MTases from the RFM superfamily, e.g.
VP39, RrmJ, or fibrillarin [29,31,45] even though these
proteins share the three-dimensional fold with the HEN1
CTD. The active site of HEN1 (as well as of the RrmJrelated MTases) is of course also different from the active
site of ribose 2'-O-MTases that belong to the unrelated the
SPOUT superfamily, e.g. TrmH [49]. This suggests that
ribose MTases evolved independently at least 3 times.
Such independent origin of a particular type of MTase has
been postulated also for enzymes that generate m7G in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/6

mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA [30,50,51], m1G in rRNA and
different positions of tRNA [52-54], and m2G in different
positions of tRNA [55,56]. Thus, convergent evolution of
the reaction specificity appears to be very frequent among
RNA MTases. Unfortunately, thus far crystal structures of
enzyme-substrate complexes are not yet available for comparison of any of these apparent functional analogs
among base MTases. Among ribose MTases, only a crystal
structure of a VP39-RNA complex [57] is available, which
has served as a template for functional analyses of other
members of the RrmJ/fibrillarin variety [29,58], as well as
unbound forms of structurally unrelated but functionally
analogous enzymes from the SPOUT superfamily (e.g.
[47,48]). Hence, until a high resolution structure of HEN1
or one of its homologs is obtained (preferably as a co-crystal with the RNA substrate), our model will serve as a convenient platform to study sequence-structure-function
relationships in this enzyme and its relation to other
MTases.
Our analyses reveal that HEN1 shares a number of structural features and most likely a closer phylogenetic origin
with small-molecule MTases rather than with other
known RNA MTases. The phylogeny of HEN1-CTD suggests that the ancestor of this protein family appeared
already before the divergence of plants and animals/fungi,
by duplication and subfunctionalization of a small-molecule MTase similar to UbiG. Perhaps the ancient HEN1CTD has been transferred to Eukaryota by horizontal gene
transfer from a bacterium.
It remains to be determined if the additional region
present only in the plant members of the HEN1 family
and composed of the DSRM domain, La-like domain,
unknown central domain, and PPI-like domain, is essential for the MTase specificity for the miRNAs and what is
the exact role of the individual domains. It is interesting
to note that this extension is present only in HEN1 from
A. thaliana and O. sativa and not in HEN1 orthologs from
other organisms. It can be speculated that DSRM and Lalike domains may be responsible for substrate binding by
the orthodox HEN1 from plants. So far, no miRNAs have
been identified in Bacteria. Besides, in miRNAs from C.
elegans or D. melanogaster no 2' or 3'-methylation was
found [11]. This suggests that the non-plant orthologs of
HEN1 may be involved in methylation of some other substrates, which is particularly relevant given that HEN1 has
apparently evolved from small-molecule MTases. Functional characterization of the short HEN1 orthologs, especially identification of their preferred substrates, and
mutagenesis of the putative RNA-binding domains of
plant HEN1 delineated in this work may shed the light on
the evolution of specificity determinants in this interesting family of enzymes. It would be exciting to elucidate

the evolutionary pathway leading from a small-molecule
MTase to a nucleic acid MTase.

Methods
Sequence database searches
The BLAST family of algorithms [15,59] were used to
search the non-redundant version of current sequence
databases (nr), the publicly available complete and
incomplete genome sequences, and the EST (expressed
sequence tag) database at the NCBI [60]. Fragments of
amino acid sequences (especially putative translations of
the DNA sequences) were assembled into contiguous
pieces using the sequence of A. thaliana HEN1 (GI
15638615) as a guide. The putative splicing sites were verified in reciprocal BLAST searches against the database
comprising sequences of HEN1 homologs. All sequences
were subsequently realigned using MUSCLE [24]. Manual
adjustments were introduced into the multiple sequence
alignment (MSA) based on the BLAST pairwise comparisons, secondary structure prediction, and results of the
fold-recognition analyses (see below).

The final alignments were used to generate a set of query
profile HMMs using HHmake from the HHsearch package
[25]. The profile HHMs corresponding to all COG, KOG
[61], PFAM [62], PDB70 [63], and CDD [17] entries were
downloaded from the home site of HHsearch [64]. Comparison of the profile HMMs (sequence+structure) was
carried out using HHsearch [25], with default parameters.

expressed as a spectrum ranging from -2 kT/e (deep red) to
+2 kT/e (deep blue). The AdoMet moiety is shown in a wireframe representation.
Sequence clustering
To visualize pairwise similarities between and within protein families we used CLANS (CLuster ANalysis of
Sequences), a Java utility that applies version of the Fruchterman-Reingold graph layout algorithm [27]. CLANS
uses the P-values of high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs)
obtained from an N × N BLAST search, to compute attractive and repulsive forces between each sequence pair in a
user-defined dataset. Three dimensional representation is
achieved by randomly seeding sequences in space. The
sequences are then moved within this environment
according to the force vectors resulting from all pairwise
interactions and the process is repeated to convergence.
Phylogenetic analyses
The refined multiple sequence alignment was used to calculate the phylogenetic tree of the HEN1 family using
SplisTree [65], which employs the split decomposition
model developed by Bandel and Dress [28]. The number
of amino acid replacements per sequence position in the
alignment was estimated using the JTT model [66]. Aiming at the determination of the sampling variance of the
distance values, 1000 bootstrap resampling of the alignment columns was exerted.
Protein structure prediction
Prediction of domains in the primary structure was carried
out using the NCBI Conserved Domain Search utility
[67]. Prediction of secondary structure, protein order/disoreder, solvent accessibility, and tertiary fold-recognition
was carried out via the GeneSilico meta-server gateway
(see [18] and [68] for details). Secondary structure predic-

tion was predicted using PSIPRED [69], PROFsec [70],
PROF [71], SABLE [72], JNET [73], JUFO [74], and SAMT02 [75]. Protein disorder was predicted using PONDR
[76] and DISOPRED [37]. Solvent accessibility for the
individual residues was predicted with SABLE [72] and
JPRED [77]. The fold-recognition analysis (attempt to
match the query sequence to known protein structures)
was carried out using FFAS03 [32], SAM-T02 [75],
3DPSSM [78], INBGU [79], FUGUE [80], mGENTHREADER [33], and SPARKS [34]. Fold-recognition
alignments reported by these methods were compared,
evaluated, and ranked by the Pcons server [35].
Homology modeling
The alignments between the sequence of HEN1 and the
structures of selected templates (members of the RFM fold
identified by Pcons) were used as a starting point for modeling of the HEN1 CTD tertiary structure using the
"FRankenstein's Monster" approach [36], comprising
cycles of model building by MODELLER [81], evaluation
by VERIFY3D [82] via the COLORADO3D server [39],
realignment in poorly scored regions and merging of best
scoring fragments. The positions of predicted catalytic residues and secondary structure elements were used as spatial restraints. This strategy has previously helped us to
build accurate, experimentally validated models of other
RNA MTases, including 16S tRNA:2'-OH MTase Trm7p
[83], sno/snRNA:cap hypermethylase Tgs1 [84],
tRNA:m5C MTase Trm4p [85], tRNA:m1A MTase TrmI
[86], tRNA:m2G MTases from Archaea [56] and Eukaryota
[87], and tRNA:m7G MTase TrmB [51]. Here, the refined
comparative model comprised regions that could not be
aligned to any of the templates and obtained unacceptably low scores in all models. Thus, they were re-modeled
using a mixed "comparative/de novo" protocol, which
has been successfully applied in the recent CASP6 competition to accurately model a variety of different proteins
[88].
De novo modeling
The insertion between motifs VI and VII (aa 829–858)
was modeled de novo using ROSETTA [40] in the context
of the rest of the HEN1 CTD modeled by homology (and
kept invariant during modeling of the insertion). Briefly,
fragment selection based on profile-profile and secondary
structure comparison with the ROSETTA database was
performed and 3 and 9 amino acids fragment lists were
generated for the re-modeled regions. Fragment assembly
was performed with default options and medium level of
side chains rotamers optimization. The set of 8000 preliminary models (decoys) was clustered and representatives of 5 largest clusters were selected as the final
structures.
