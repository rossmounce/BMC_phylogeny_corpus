Expression level, cellular compartment and
metabolic network position all influence the
average selective constraint on mammalian
enzymes
Corey M Hudson1* and Gavin C Conant1,2

Abstract
Background: A gene’s position in regulatory, protein interaction or metabolic networks can be predictive of the
strength of purifying selection acting on it, but these relationships are neither universal nor invariably strong.
Following work in bacteria, fungi and invertebrate animals, we explore the relationship between selective
constraint and metabolic function in mammals.
Results: We measure the association between selective constraint, estimated by the ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka)
to synonymous (Ks) substitutions, and several, primarily metabolic, measures of gene function. We find significant
differences between the selective constraints acting on enzyme-coding genes from different cellular
compartments, with the nucleus showing higher constraint than genes from either the cytoplasm or the
mitochondria. Among metabolic genes, the centrality of an enzyme in the metabolic network is significantly
correlated with Ka/Ks. In contrast to yeasts, gene expression magnitude does not appear to be the primary
predictor of selective constraint in these organisms.
Conclusions: Our results imply that the relationship between selective constraint and enzyme centrality is
complex: the strength of selective constraint acting on mammalian genes is quite variable and does not appear to
exclusively follow patterns seen in other organisms.

Background
The rate and manner of evolutionary change has long
been a matter of keen interest to biologists [1]. Kimura
provided theoretical underpinnings to molecular evolution by relating rates of sequence substitution, population parameters and mutation rates [2,3]. Thus,
Kimura’s neutral theory [4] predicts that mutations having no fitness effect will become fixed in a population at
a rate equal to the mutation rate. Such neutral mutations therefore provide a standard for measuring the
action of natural selection: regions changing more
slowly than neutral ones are inferred to be experiencing
purifying selection (e.g., selective constraint), those
changing more rapidly, adaptive evolution. While the

relative contributions of genetic drift, adaptive evolution
and purifying selection to population differentiation are
still debated, [5], there is general agreement that the
patterns of selection vary both across species as well as
among genes in the same species [6].
Regarding interspecific variation, Lynch and Conery
[7] argue that much of the variation in genome structure and content between species can be attributed to
differences in their effective population sizes (Ne). Small
effective population sizes limit the efficiency of purifying
selection and allow the occasional fixation of mildly
deleterious mutations. While some cross-taxa surveys
have reported patterns consistent with this hypothesis
[8-10], others have found that if one allows for reasonably frequent directional selection there is only a weak
relationship between Ne and selective constraint [11-13].
The second type of variation in selective constraint,
that between genetic loci in the same population, has

also been studied [14-16]. In particular, considerable
effort has gone into identifying factors that predict the
selection acting on a particular gene. One critical variable is expression level: mammalian genes expressed in
many tissues show stronger selective constraints than do
those expressed in only a few tissues [17]. Likewise, in
yeast, a high expression level is the primary predictor of
strong purifying selection acting on a gene [18], likely
because the selective cost of protein misfolding is especially large for highly translated proteins [16].
This association is also in keeping with Wagner’s theoretical analyses showing that gene expression is selectively costly in yeast [19]. However, as he notes, the
fitness cost of mis-expression is likely to be very different in multicellular organisms [19].
The influence of other factors on selective constraint
is also debated, with the evidence primarily coming
from studies in yeast [18,20-26]. The topic is confounded by the intercorrelation of many of these predictors [18]. Thus, some researchers report a significant
correlation between the fitness cost of gene knockouts
and those genes’ selective constraint [21,23], while
others have questioned this association [20,24]. There is
similar debate regarding whether the position of a gene
or protein in an interaction network influences selective
constraint.
Recall that in these networks genes or proteins are
nodes; relationships, such as protein interactions or
shared metabolites, are represented as edges between

nodes. Researchers have studied the association between
selective constraint and measures such as node degree
(the number of edges for a given node) and betweenness
centrality [a more global statistic measuring the number
of shortest paths passing through a node; [27-29]]. Significant associations between node importance and
selective constraint have been found in regulatory [30],
protein interaction [22], coexpression [31], and metabolic networks [32-34]. However, at least for protein
interaction networks, this association seems to be at
best quite weak [22,25,26].
Here we explore to what degree these patterns of constraint extend to mammals. Given the difference in lifestyle and effective population size between humans and
yeast, we hypothesized that mammals would have
evolved in a manner similar to Drosophila [34], where
there is a significant association between enzyme centrality and evolutionary constraint. We asked whether a
gene’s position in the human metabolic network (Figure
1) predicts the strength of the purifying selection acting
on it. Some previous analyses have calculated the protein divergence between two species, using their common divergence to control for the mutation rate [26].
However, only sampling two sequences offers somewhat
limited resolution in the estimation of selective constraint. Here we follow Greenberg, Stockwell and Clark
[34] by estimating the selective constraint acting on
each human enzyme by comparing it to its orthologs
from seven other eutherian genomes (chimpanzee,

macaque, mouse, rat, horse, dog and cow). We find that
genes encoding metabolic proteins evolve significantly
more slowly than other genes. Among those metabolic
genes, the encoded protein’s cellular compartment is
predictive of selective constraint. We also find a weak,
though statistically significant, negative correlation
between the betweenness of an enzyme in the metabolic
network and constraint.

Results
Orthology identification

To infer selective constraints for the set of annotated
human genes, we identified their orthologs in seven
other mammalian genomes using an approach that combines sequence similarity and gene order information
(Methods). We found 19,416 human genes with at least
one ortholog in these genomes. Among those genes, we
identified 13,928 sets of orthologs with between 6 and 8
members. Of the 1,496 genes annotated by Duarte et al.
[35] as belonging to the metabolic network, 1,190 are in
this ortholog set (Figure 2). A greater percentage of
genes in the metabolic network fell into our set of
orthologs than did genes from the genome at large (c2
= 47.9; P < 0.001; Figure 2B).
Metabolic and nonmetabolic genes differ in selective
constraint

The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (K a /K s : hereafter ω) for each set of orthologous
genes was estimated by maximum likelihood using
PAML 4.2 [Figure 2A; [36]]. This ratio can be interpreted as a measure of selective constraint: values near
0 indicate strong purifying selection, while values greater
than 1.0 suggest directional selection.
We hypothesized that metabolic genes would also be
under stronger selective constraint than the average
non-metabolic gene, so we performed three statistical
tests of this hypothesis. First, using a Mann-Whitney Utest (Wilcoxon two-sample test), we rejected the null
hypothesis that the median ω among metabolic genes is
no smaller than that of non-metabolic genes (i.e., a onetailed test, P = 0.035; Figure 2). Next, we performed a
similar test for unequal mean ω values between the two
groups. Given that neither distribution in Figure 2A
appears normal, we adopted a bootstrapping approach,
drawing 1,000,000 samples of size n = 1,190 from the
set of non-metabolic genes (n = 12,738) and calculating
these samples’ means. In no case was the mean value of
ω from the bootstrapped samples as small as the
observed mean value for metabolic genes (ωmetabolic =
0.1292, P < 10-6). We also drew 100,000 samples of sizes
n = 1,190 and of n = 12,738 and calculated the difference in their means. The absolute differences in the
mean values was never as large as that observed

Page 3 of 11

between the metabolic and non-metabolic genes (P <
10-5; Figure 2C).
Finally, we performed a more general analysis of the
distributions of ω in the two gene sets. To do so, we
first fit eight common distributions, the normal, gamma,
exponential, Cauchy, log-normal, logistic, Weibull, and
extreme value distributions, to the overall set of ω
values. We then assessed the quality of the fit of each
distribution to the data by analyzing the linear correlation between the ranked data and a Q-Q plot (Table 1;
see Methods). Out of the eight distributions, three, the
Weibull, gamma and exponential provide a visually good
fit to the ω values (Additional file 1, Figure S1). For
these three distributions, we compared a null model
where all genes shared the same distribution parameters
to an alternative where the metabolic and non-metabolic
genes were allowed to have distinct parameter values for
that same distribution. Using a likelihood ratio test, we
found that we could reject the null model of identical
distributions of ω for the metabolic and non-metabolic
genes for all three distributions (P < 10-6; chi-square distribution; Table 1). Collectively, these three analyses
allow us to firmly conclude that metabolic genes are
under greater selective constraint than are arbitrary
orthologous genes from these genomes.
Cellular compartments differ in the selective constraint
acting on their enzymes

We next investigated whether an enzyme’s tolerance for
amino acid substitutions depends on its subcellular localization. This analysis is somewhat less straightforward
than it might appear both because some reactions (and
hence their enzymes) occur in multiple compartments
and because some reactions have multiple isoenzymes.
As a result, different cellular compartments can contain
the same enzyme. However, the set of overlapping
enzymes is in general small and thus unlikely to weaken
the power of our analysis significantly (Figure 3). For
clarity, we defined proteins involved in transport reactions to be their own distinct category: such reactions
have their reactants and products in different
compartments.
The mean value of ω varies from 0.0935 in the
nucleus to 0.1735 in the peroxisome. To determine if
the differences in ω values are significant across compartments, we first clustered the compartments by mean
[UPGMA; [37]]. The resulting three groups, in order of
increasing ω, are: the Golgi apparatus and the nucleus,
all other compartments except the peroxisome, and
finally the peroxisome (Figure 3). We tested for significant pairwise differences between compartments in ω
using a Mann-Whitney U-test (Figure 3) at a significance level of a = 0.01 (to account for the inherent
multiple testing issues). The tests were conducted in a

the relative proportions of genes for which we cannot identify orthologs for the metabolic and non-metabolic genes (red and black,
respectively). These proportions are significantly different (c2 = 11.98, P < 0.001). C) After taking samples of size n = 1,190 and n = 12,738 and

observed difference in mean ω for metabolic and non-metabolic genes (P < 10-5).

nested fashion, such that groups for which we could not
reject the hypothesis of equal values of ω were compared to their nearest neighbors (c.f., the tree in Figure
3). This procedure allowed us to make seven comparisons, rather than the 56 possible pairwise comparisons.
We find that the distributions clustered with low ω
values (the nucleus and Golgi apparatus) are statistically
indistinguishable (P = 0.047). Those in the large intermediate cluster can be split among groups that are statistically indistinguishable including lysozyme and
transport compartments (P = 0.087), endoplasmic

reticulum and external reactions (P = 0.205), and the
cytosol and mitochondrial compartments, which are
both statistically distinct from each other (P < 0.01).
The peroxisome is also statistically distinct from the
remaining compartments (P < 0.01).
Network construction

We next explored the role of metabolic network structure in influencing selective constraint, using the metabolic network of Duarte et al. [35]. This network
includes information on reaction compartment and

directionality that were used to create a semi-directed
metabolic network where reactions are nodes. Two
nodes are connected by an edge if they share a metabolite. Note that because metabolites are compartmentspecific, edges do not connect reactions in differing
compartments. Edges are also disallowed if the two reactions in question are irreversible and the interconnecting
metabolite serves as a substrate in both reactions or a
product in both. The resulting network has 298,004
edges and 3,741 nodes, of which 2,264 have at least one
associated gene (Figure 1).

Figure 3 Hierarchical clustering of cellular compartments
based on selective constraint. Genes are split into nine groups
based on their subcellular location (see main text). The median box
plots show the distribution of ω values for each compartment - all
data, including outliers, are used in the analysis. Using the mean ω
values, we created a phenogram using the UPGMA algorithm
(branch lengths are arbitrary). Each branch is colored gold if a
Mann-Whitney U-test found that the distributions were significantly
different at P ≤ 0.01, and blue otherwise. For example, the
cytoplasm and mitochondria distributions are significantly different
(P = 0.01), but the lysozyme and transport groups show no
significant difference (P = 0.087). However, when the group formed
by the cytoplasm and mitochondria is compared to that formed by
the lysozyme and transporters, there is a statistically significant
difference (P < 0.001). The 4 Venn diagrams show the proportional
degree of overlap in genes among groups (sizes are not
comparable across nodes in the tree). In none of these cases is any
one set of reactions a superset of the other set of reactions.

Removal of currency metabolites

One of the implicit steps in preprocessing metabolic
networks is removing currency metabolites, such as
water and ATP that participate in numerous reactions.
Failing to remove such metabolites prior to analysis can
lead to an overestimation of connectedness between
reactions.
Rather than introducing an arbitrary cutoff to define
currency metabolites, we sought to use to the structure
of the network itself to identify them. Other authors
have defined and systematically removed currency metabolites from their networks based on their knowledge of
the metabolic system [38]. Unfortunately the definition
of currency metabolites is not consistent in the literature. Therefore, the network statistic we chose to identify currency metabolites is modularity. Newman [39]
defines a measure of optimal modularity, Q, as the quality of the subdivision of a network (measured as the
fraction of vertices within clustered subdivisions minus
the expected fraction of vertices with the same subdivisions in a randomly drawn graph) [40]. Huss and
Holme [38] introduce ΔQ, which is Q for the empirical
network minus the average Q of a number of random
networks. As we remove increasingly less common
metabolites, the ΔQ of most cellular components has a
well-defined maxima (i.e., what modular structure was
present in the network is eventually lost as more and
more metabolites are removed). Interestingly, when we
either consider the network as a whole or the reactions
of the cytoplasm alone, the resulting analysis does not
present such a well-defined maximal ΔQ (Figure 4;
Additional file 1, Figure S3), and we propose two reasons for this discrepancy. First, the large number of
reactions means that removing certain metabolites (such
as H + , responsible for half the edges in the network)
dramatically changes the network topology, yielding
instability in the modularity measurements (see Methods). Second, many of the reactions in the cytoplasm
are transporters. Because such transport reactions link
distinct modules (i.e., compartments) in the network, it
is expected that would they behave suboptimally in a
modularity analysis.

We investigated the relationship between two measures
of network topology and the selective constraint on the
genes associated with network reactions. The measures
of reaction importance were the node degree and the
betweenness centrality. Interestingly, there is a weak,
but statistically significant correlation of betweenness
centrality and ω (Figure 5: Spearman’s r = -0.279, P <
10-4), but no significant correlation between node degree
and ω (Spearman’s r = -0.029, P = 0.075). The network
with currency metabolites included shows no relationship between network position and ω (Spearman’s rdegree
= -0.03, P = 0.118, rbetweenness = -0.01, P = 0.587).
There could be several sources of error associated
with such an analysis of network structure and selective
constraint. One obvious one is the compartment-bycompartment differences in average selective constraint
already described. To explore the role of compartmentalization on this association, we examined the relationships between centrality and ω on a per-compartment
basis (Table 2), finding that four compartments had statistically significant association between degree and ω

and three had significant associations of betweenness
and ω. Oddly, we found a significantly positive association between these variables in the lysozyme.
Positive selection among the metabolic genes cannot
explain the associations seen

We found 52 sets of orthologous metabolic genes that
showed evidence for positive selection, spread across all
cellular compartments (ranging from 0.7% of mitochondrial genes to 6.4% of cytoplasmic ones; see Methods).
Excluding these genes did not alter our compartment
specific estimates of ω, the correlations between network statistics and ω or the significance of the differences in ω between compartments (data not shown).
There is a weak relationship between gene expression
and selective constraint

Using 4,105 genes in both our sample and the HUGE
Index [41] we found a weak statistical relationship
between ω and maximum expression level (r = -0.081; P
< 10-6 ). For metabolic genes this correlation is somewhat stronger (r = -0.089; P = 0.029). This relationship,
however, is weaker than the relationship we find
between network position and ω in metabolic genes,
implying that expression may not the dominant predictor of selective constraint in mammals in the same way
it is in yeast [18].

Discussion
Our conclusions that gene function, expression, cellular
localization and network position influence selective
constraint will individually come as little surprise to
researchers. This is especially true of our conclusion
that purifying selection acts more strongly on metabolic
genes than on genes from the genome at large: function
is a known correlate of rate of evolution [42-44].
While we find a significant correlation between reaction centrality (betweenness) and selective constraint in

the metabolic network, this result comes with several
important caveats. First, although it is reasonable to
interpret Ka/Ks as the level of selective constraint a gene
experiences, in fact, this statistic represents an average
evolutionary rate: in particular, two genes with the same
fraction of amino acid substitutions forbidden by natural
selection might have differing values of K a /K s if one
gene had undergone more adaptive amino acid substitutions. We have partly controlled for this effect by omitting orthologs with evidence of positive selection, but it
is not currently possible to completely remove this
effect. Another caveat is that the association of betweenness-centrality and (apparent) constraint disappears
when the currency metabolites are included. It is also
worth noting that node degree on its own is not predictive of constraint in mammals, similar to the lack of
association between these variables seen in E. coli [26].
We suggest one useful message to take from this result
is that the relationship that exists between selective constraint and betweenness centrality is dependent on the
manner in which the network is constructed. Special
care has been taken in justifying the removal of currency
metabolites across networks, however different removal
strategies produce different associations of centrality
and constraint (Methods).
From a more general perspective, it is also important
to recall that networks are only computational abstractions of a biological reality. To speak of an association
of betweenness and selection is therefore actually to
suggest that betweenness, a measurable quality, also
represents an underlying biological feature. In this work,
we have not directly demonstrated such a biological
association. Likewise, there is a difference between the
metabolic network associations seen here and those in
protein interaction networks. In protein interaction networks, the pairwise binding of proteins is directly
mediated by sequences, and natural selection can act to
maintain complementary sequences in two interacting

Hudson and Conant BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:89
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/89

proteins [45]. In metabolic networks, the relationship is
more tenuous; one assumes that central reactions are
required for proper function of the metabolic network
and hence enzymes catalyzing such reactions will be
under greater constraint. Even if this argument holds,
the constraint is on function and not specifically on
sequence. If an enzyme can maintain this function using
differing sequences, there might be no necessary association of sequence constraint and centrality.
When we break the metabolic network down by compartment, we do find associations between network centrality (degree or betweenness) and constraint in some,
but not all, compartments (Table 2). One lesson from
these complex results is that although it is intuitive to
consider the relationship between metabolic network
structure and selective constraint at a global level, differences in constraint among compartments may confound
global analyses. Likewise, the variation in constraint
among these compartment raises interesting questions:
it is unclear why enzymes from the Golgi apparatus and
nucleus should be more highly conserved than those
from the central group of compartments (Figure 3).
Strikingly, enzymes implicated in external reactions fall
within this central group, and are not distinguished by
having a uniquely fast or slow rate of substitution. This
result contrasts the findings by Liao et al. [46] and Julenius and Pedersend [47] that the intra-/extra-cellular
localization of a protein is highly predictive of its ω.
However, note that these authors considered all genes
in a given compartment, as opposed to the strictly metabolic ones analyzed here.
One potential explanation for these differences in constraint between compartments is that those compartments have different tolerances for misfolded proteins.
Protein misfolding appears to have a significant fitness
cost in yeast [16], and it is not unreasonable to hypothesize that the spatial organization of the nucleus [48]
might induce a particularly high cost for misfolded proteins. However, one observation that speaks against this
hypothesis is the weak association of constraint and
expression. Our results thus suggest that although gene
expression in some manner constrains mammalian protein evolution, it is less effective at doing so in mammals
than in yeast.

Conclusions
In general, we find that although the position of a mammalian gene’s product in the metabolic network and its
expression level are both associated with that gene’s
evolutionary constraint, neither factor is determinative.
Thus, unlike yeast, the forces that determine the selective constraint on mammalian protein-coding genes are
likely both to be complex and to vary between genes.

Methods
Orthology identification

Our method for orthology identification first detects
homologous genes using sequence similarity and then
uses gene order to resolve orthology [orthology and
paralogy are reviewed in [49]]. Specifically, we first conduct a pairwise homology search among all genes in G1
and G2 using GenomeHistory [50]. GenomeHistory hits
were filtered to exclude those with E-values greater than
10-10 (comparisons to chimpanzee and macaque) or 10-9
(all other comparisons) and amino acid sequence identity less than 50% (chimpanzee and macaque) or 45%
(all others). Cases where two homologous genes are
immediate neighbors on a chromosome (e.g., tandem
duplicates) are treated as a single locus. An initial ortholog pair A and B is inferred if three criteria are met:
• A is from G1 and B is from G2.
• The only homology of A in G2 is B and the only
homology of B in G1 is A.
• The synonymous divergence between A and B is
less than a threshold (Ks < 0.5 for the human-chimpanzee and human-macaque comparisons and <0.75
in all other cases).
Many genes in G1 and G2 will have multiple homologs and hence not fall into a one-to-one relationship.
Instead, we use this smaller set of one-to-one relationships to detect further orthologs. First, define C as the
immediate (left or right) neighboring gene of A and D
as the neighbor of B. If C and D are homologs, even if
they also show homology to other genes, they are
defined as orthologs. Importantly, now that C and D are
identified as orthologs, their other homology relationships are deleted. We repeat the procedure for identifying one-to-one pairs, no longer using criterion 3. The
entire process is repeated until no further orthologs are
identified [9].
Sequence alignment and quality control

We created a data pipeline using Bioperl 1.6 [51]. The
initial inputs were the set of gene orthologs determined
above: we found 19,416 ortholog sets for the 8 eutherian
mammal species. This set is made up of protein-coding
genes with no clear evidence of tandem duplication,
since duplication and subsequent functional specialization can alter measured selective constraints [52].
Human genes with orthologs in fewer than 5 other
mammals were excluded from analysis.
Given a set of orthologous genes from humans and
at least five other mammals, the corresponding amino
acid sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.6 with
default parameters [53]. We next performed several

Hudson and Conant BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:89
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/89

filtering steps to assure alignment quality. First, we
required that all possible pairs of sequences in each
alignment have pairwise percent identity (PID) of
≥40%. If any pair of sequences had a PID < 40%, then
the sequence with the lowest PID to a consensus
sequence was removed. The remaining sequences were
then realigned and their PID rechecked. Next, we
removed gap columns from the finished alignments. In
cases where this resulted in fewer than 50 aligned
amino acid columns, the sequences with the lowest
PID to the consensus sequence was removed and the
original sequences were realigned. This was done iteratively as long as there were still more than 5 sequences
to align. The result of these filtering steps was the
13,928 multiple sequence alignments used in the
remainder of our analyses.
Estimation of selective constraint

Using the above amino acid alignments, we inferred
codon-preserving nucleotide alignments and estimated
the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous rates (Ka/Ks
or ω) with the codeml package in PAML 4.2 [36]. We
assumed the sequences had evolved under previously
published mammalian phylogenetic relationships [54,55],
namely ((((human, chimpanzee), macaque), (mouse,
rat)),((horse, dog), cow)).
PAML model M0 was used to estimate the maximum
likelihood value of ω [56]. Recall that the synonymous
substitution rate is used as a proxy for the mutation
rate: the deficit or surplus of nonsynonymous substitutions relative to this value is then indicative of purifying
or diversifying selection.
Identification of metabolic genes under positive selection

With these same data, we used a site-specific model to
look for genes under positive selection. We compared
PAML models M1a and M2a, nearly-neutral and positive selection models, respectively [57]. M1a has two ω
parameters: ω0 < 1 and ω1 = 1. M2a has three ω parameters: ω0 < 1, ω1 = 1, and ω2 > 1. A likelihood ratio
test was used to determine if M2a was a significantly
better fit to the data than M1a, given that model M2a
has two more free parameters. Genes that had twice the
difference in log-likelihood greater than the critical c2
value (5.99; P < 0.05) were assumed to be under positive
selection.
Gene expression analysis

We collected expression levels for 4,105 genes by querying Affimetrix microarray data in the HUman Gene
Expression Index [HUGE Index; [41]].We then determined the maximum level at which a gene is expressed
in the 19 tissues, comprising 59 experiments in the
HUGE Index database.

Distributional fits

We tested whether the metabolic and non-metabolic
ortholog sets had differing values of ω using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test [58] as implemented in R.
Differences in ω between cellular compartments were
also analyzed with this test.
As discussed in the Results, because the data in question were visually skewed, we sought to confirm the
results of the Mann-Whitney test of differences in ω
between metabolic and nonmetabolic genes in two ways.
First, we bootstrapped samples of size n = 1,190 (the
number of metabolic orthologs in our dataset) from the
set of non-metabolic ω values and compared the sample
means to the actual mean ω of the metabolic genes. Second, to compare not only the means of the two sets of
genes but also their variability, we fit several probability
density functions to these data using the MASS library
in R [59]. The distributional parameters were estimated
by maximum likelihood: numerical optimization was
carried out using Nelder-Mead or Broyden-FletcherGoldfarb-Shanno methods for single and multi-parameter distributions, respectively [59]. We used these
estimations to calculate the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for Q-Q plots of quantile values versus observed
frequency (Additional file 1, Figure S1). The result of
this analysis was a list of distributional families ranked
in terms of the best fit of each distribution to the data
(Table 1).
We used a likelihood ratio test [LRT; [58]] to compare
the distributions of metabolic and non-metabolic ω
values. The null model requires the set of ω values from
both metabolic and non-metabolic genes to be drawn
from a single probability distribution. The alternative
model allows the metabolic and non-metabolic genes to
have differing values of the distribution parameters
(while still following the same distribution function). As
a result, the alternative model has twice as many free
parameters (2p) as does the null model, allowing us to
compare the difference in log likelihood between the
two models to a c 2 distribution with p degrees of
freedom.
Network properties

Modularity, degree, and betweenness estimates for the
metabolic networks were calculated using the igraph
library [60] in R. Modularity was estimated using the
Clauset et al. algorithm for detecting community structure [61]. Betweenness was calculated using the Brandes
algorithm [27,28,62].
Removal of currency metabolites

As discussed in the Results, and following Huss and
Holme [38], we defined currency metabolites as metabolites whose removal increased the effective modularity

Hudson and Conant BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:89
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/89

(ΔQ) of the network in question. Modularity is a measure of the degree to which nodes fit into distinct and
connected subunits [39]. Effective modularity is the difference between the maximum modularity of the graph
and the average maximum modularity of a number of
random graphs [38]. Removing currency metabolites
increases modularity, since it removes interconnections
between distinct subgraphs, while removing non-currency metabolites decreases modularity by isolating
reactions from their subgraph modules.
To calculate ΔQ we compared modularity (Q) [39] of
the graph to the average Q of 1000 randomly rewired
graphs. The Q for the graph minus the average Q of
these 1000 random graphs is ΔQ [38]. We thus ordered
the metabolites by the frequency with which they
formed edges, removed the most frequent metabolite
and calculated ΔQ. We then reordered the metabolites
and repeated this procedure until any further removal of
metabolites only decreased ΔQ.
We optimized ΔQ for three different types of networks. First, we used a noncompartmentalized network
(i.e., we removed compartmental metabolite designations
so that ATP in the cytoplasm is treated equivalently to
ATP in the mitochondria, Figure 4A). We next considered a network where we retained compartmental metabolite designations (where a specific metabolite may be
removed from one cellular component, but not another)
and optimized the global compartmentalized network
(Figure 4B; Additional file 2, Table S1). Finally, we optimized the modularity in each cellular compartment
individually (Additional file 1, Figure S3). Because the
compartmentalized network offered both improved biological intuition and better performance in our modularity analysis, it was used for all of the analyses presented
above. We note, however, this noncompartmentalized
network shows a weaker association of betweenness and
ω than does the compartmentalized one (rbetweenness =
-0.07, P < 10-4).

Additional material
Additional file 1: Supplemental figures. Figure S1 - Q-Q plots are for
8 common distributions. Weibull, gamma, exponential, logistic, normal,
extreme value, log-normal and Cauchy. The X-Y line is y = x. The x-axis
plots the theoretical quartiles for a statistical population from one of the
8 distributions, while the y-axis plots the data. Values that lie on the line
y = x are a good fit between the theoretical distribution and data. The
Weibull, gamma, and exponential distributions provide close visual fits to
the data (see Table 1 for the correlations). Figure S2 - Ortholog
identification. Homologous genes within and between genomes are first
identified based on a lack of within-genome paralogs in both genomes.
We then identify each pair of genes that are immediate neighbors of a
pair of orthologs and are also homologous. Because these genes have
other homologs in the other genome, they were not part of the initial
ortholog list. We now define them as orthologs, and at the same time,
remove any orphan genes that no longer show homology to genes in
the other genome not already in orthologous pairs. Using the new pairs,

Page 10 of 11

we repeat the process until no further orthologs are located. Figure S3 Maximum effective modularity for each compartment and for the total
cellular metabolic network. Effective modularity (ΔQ) on the y-axis is
maximized for each of the subcellular compartments, including
organelles, external reactions, and the cytoplasm by iteratively removing
each of the most common metabolites (the number on the x-axis). The
dashed horizontal line indicates the line corresponding to the ΔQ based
on 1000 random iterations (ΔQ = 0). The vertical line corresponds to the
points where the graph is maximized.
