Molecular modeling of the reductase domain to
elucidate the reaction mechanism of reduction of
peptidyl thioester into its corresponding alcohol
in non-ribosomal peptide synthetases

Abstract
Background: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multienzymatic, multidomain megasynthases involved
in the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically important nonribosomal peptides. The peptaibol synthetase from
Trichoderma virens (TPS) is an important member of the NRPS family that exhibits antifungal properties. The
majority of the NRPSs terminate peptide synthesis with the thioesterase (TE) domain, which either hydrolyzes the
thioester linkage, releasing the free peptic acid, or catalyzes the intramolecular macrocyclization to produce a
macrolactone product. TPS is an important NRPS that does not encompass a TE domain, but rather a reductase
domain (R domain) to release the mature peptide product reductively with the aid of a NADPH cofactor. However,
the catalytic mechanism of the reductase domain has not yet been elucidated.
Results: We present here a three-dimensional (3D) model of the reductase domain based on the crystal structure
of vestitone reductase (VR). VR belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily and is
responsible for the nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reduction of the substrate into its
corresponding secondary alcohol product. The binding sites of the probable linear substrates, alamethicin,
trichotoxin, antiamoebin I, chrysopermin C and gramicidin, were identified within the modeled R domain using
multiple docking approaches. The docking results of the ligand in the active site of the R domain showed that
reductase side chains have a high affinity towards ligand binding, while the thioester oxygen of each substrate
forms a hydrogen bond with the OH group of Tyr176 and the thiol group of the substrate is closer to the Glu220.
The modeling and docking studies revealed the reaction mechanism of reduction of thioester into a primary
alcohol.
Conclusion: Peptaibol biosynthesis incorporates a single R domain, which appears to catalyze the four-electron
reduction reaction of a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-bound peptide to its corresponding primary alcohol. Analysis
of R domains present in the non-redundant (nr) database of the NCBI showed that the R domain always resides in
the last NRPS module and is involved in either a two or four-electron reduction reaction.

Background
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multienzymatic, multi-domain megasynthases that are
involved in the synthesis of a remarkable array of commercially important nonribosomal peptides through the
sequential condensation of amino acid monomers [1-4].

Trichoderma virens peptaibol synthetases (TPS) are
important NRPS members that synthesize peptaibols,
which are a family of short chain length peptides (≤20
residues) that harbor a unique C-terminal alcoholic
group instead of a carboxyl group. Peptaibols form
right-handed alpha-helical structures that self-associate
into multimeric transmembrane channels. These channels conduct ionic species to disrupt the osmotic balance and promote cell death [5]. Peptaibols may also
induce resistance to pathogens in plants. For example,

exogenous peptaibol application activates a defense reaction in lima beans and reduces the susceptibility of
tobacco to tobacco mosaic virus [6].
Peptaibol is synthesized by the TPS assembly line
complex, which is a nonribosomal peptide synthase/
polyketide synthase (NRPS/PKS) hybrid system. Various
hybrid NRPS/PKS systems such as rapamycin, bleomycin, yersiniabactin and epothilone have already been
reported in the literature [7,8]. In TPSs that are composed of one PKS and eighteen NRPS modules, PKSs
always reside at the N-terminal end and initiate the
reaction [9]. PKSs possess three domains, b-ketoacylACP synthase (KS), acyl transferase (AT) and acyl carrier protein (ACP). In general, the KS domain catalyzes
the chain extension, the AT domain is responsible for
loading the starter and the ACP domain holds the growing macrolide, which is subsequently transferred to the
next module. NRPS modules are iterative, with one
module for one amino acid to build a peptide product.
Each module required for the addition of a single monomer consists of a condensation domain (C), an adenylation domain (A) and a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP,
also denoted as the thiolation domain (T)). The A
domain selects the amino acid and activates it as an
aminoacyl adenylate, after which it is transferred into
the -SH group of the 4’-phosphopantetheinyl arm
attached to the PCP domain [10]. The C domain, which
is present between every consecutive pair of the A
domain and the PCP, catalyzes peptide bond formation
between the upstream peptidyl-S-PCP and the free
amino group of the downstream aminoacyl-S-PCP, thus
facilitating the translocation of the growing chain into
the next module [11-13].
During biosynthesis, the growing chain remains covalently attached to the enzyme until it reaches its full
length, at which point the TE domain residing at the
last module releases a cyclic, branched-cyclic or linear
product [10,14]. An alternative termination scheme
involves reducing the tethered C-terminal residue by the
R domain at the end of a NRPS module, which results
in the release of a peptide with an alcoholic C-terminal
[15]. Such a reductase-mediated terminal modification
occurs in TPS. Wiest et al. [9] already proposed that the
TPS C-terminal end dehydrogenase domain plays a key
role in the reduction process of PCP-bound peptide to
generate a primary alcohol. However, the exact mechanism by which the R domain releases the primary alcohol
product has not been explored.
In this study, we identified the location of the R
domain that catalyzes reduction of the PCP-bound peptide to the corresponding primary alcohol in the 422
amino acid C-terminal linker region of TPS (Figure 1A).
To elucidate the function of the R domain, we initially
identified similar domains present in the synthases

involved in the biosynthesis of myxalamid, myxochelin,
glycopeptidolipid, lyngbyatoxin and Brevibacillus texasporus (BT) by using BLAST searches of the nr database.
The primary sequences of R domains from TPS and glycopeptidolipid show 60% sequence similarity. In order
to determine the reduction reaction catalyzed by the R
domain, which is common for the above synthase
families, we chose glycopeptidolipid having 20.5%
sequence identity with VR. Our modeling and refinement approach to explain the reduction reaction
mechanism is similar to the approach used by Zhou et
al. [16], who modeled a 3D structure of heparanase that
had only 20% sequence identity with its template xylanase (1BG4). They subsequently conducted molecular
dynamics (MD) refinement and tested the inhibitors targeting the heparanase model. We constructed a 3D
model of the R domain based on vestitone reductase,
which is a member of the SDR family for which the 3D
structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography. The
refined structure of the R domain was employed in the
docking simulation. Analysis revealed that Tyr176 and
Glu220 are the prime proton donors for the reduction
of thioester into the primary alcohol via an intermediate
aldehyde. Additionally, the reaction mechanism of the R
domain was clearly described herein.

Methods
Sequence analysis and domain prediction of TPS

The TPS protein sequence extracted from the NCBI
protein database (accession no. AAM78457) was submitted to NRPS-PKS, which is a database that predicts
the domain organization of nonribosomal peptide
synthetases and polyketide synthetases [17]. This program predicted all possible domains, including A, C, T,
ACP, KS, AT, and a 422 amino acid C-terminal linker
that are present in the TPS sequence. We believed that
the 422-amino acid C-terminal linker was the putative R
domain; therefore, we analyzed the sequence using the
Conserved Domain Database (CDD) search program at
NCBI [18], the Simple Modular Architecture Research
Tool (SMART) search program at EMBL [19] and the
Pfam search program [20]. A BLASTP search of the
TPS C-terminal linker against the nr database [21] was
conducted to identify previously characterized R
domains present in the multidomain proteins. Additionally, we inferred the phylogenetic tree of the ten characterized proteins using the neighbor-joining method
based on their CLUSTALX multiple sequence alignment
[22].
Threading analysis of characterized reductase sequences

A search was conducted to identify the possible folds for
the R domain (R domain from TPS and similar

domain) by the threading and fold recognition servers,
GenTHREADER http://www.psipred.net/psiform.html
[23] and PHYRE [24]. We opted for this approach
because we could not obtain any relevant template
structures or domains through the Pfam, SMART CDD,
or BLASTP searches against the PDB. Threading analysis revealed that the folds of the R domains belong to
the class extended SDR proteins family. The similarities
among the folds were verified with a combinatorial

extension (CE) program http://cl.sdsc.edu/[25]. The
curated sequences of the R domains were taken from
the GenTHREADER and PHYRE Programs, and multiple sequence alignment was performed using Tcoffee
http://www.tcoffee.org/ to identify the conserved regions
of the motif among these characterized proteins.

X) [26] were loaded into the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2008.10. The primary structure of the
2p4h and R domain were aligned and carefully checked
to avoid deletions or insertions in conserved regions and
corrected manually wherever necessary. A series of 10 R
domain models were independently constructed with
the MOE using the Boltzmann-weighted randomized
procedure [27] combined with specialized logic for the
handling of sequence insertions and deletions [28].
There was no difference in the number and organization
of secondary structural elements and no significant main
chain deviation among the 10 models generated for each
R domain. However, the model with the highest packing
score was selected for full energy minimization (MOE
packing score = -2.2612). The overall geometric and
stereo-chemical qualities of the final modeled structure
of the R domain were examined using Ramachandran
plots generated within the MOE and Verify 3D server
[29,30]. The structural stability was evaluated by a MD
simulation, while the reliability of the model was further
evaluated by docking simulation and binding analysis.

trichotoxin (1M24), chryospermin C (1EE7) and gramicidin (1NRM) [36-39]. The above substrates are ≈18-20
amino acids long and linear. For each substrate, we took
three, four (Figure 1C), five and six residues from the
C-terminal end of the above crystal structure because
only the final C-terminal residue is involved in the catalytic mechanism. In all of the ligand structures, we
replaced the C-terminal alcohol group with C(= O)
SNAc to smooth the protein-ligand docking process. It
should be noted that C(= O)SNAc (peptidyl-S-N-acetylcysteamine) mimics the 4’-phosphopantetheine moiety
of the PCP loaded with a substrate and has been used
successfully to characterize NRPS domains [40]. Partial
charges and hydrogens were added to protonated and
unprotonated molecules using Merck Molecular Force
Field 94× (MMFF94X), which is suitable for small druglike molecules [41]. All of the structures were energy
minimized using the conjugated gradient with the convergence criterion = 0.05 kcal/mol, ε = 1. We used these
ligands for docking of the R domain using the two different docking programs described below.

Structural refinement and stability evaluation by MD

(i) MOE-DOCK 2008.10

MD simulations were conducted using GROMACS 3.3.3
[31]. The R domain structure was inserted into a cubic
box maintaining a minimum of 10 Å between the box
edges and the protein surface. The resulting system was
solvated with simple point charge (SPC) water molecules
and then minimized with the GROMOS96 force field
using the steepest descent method [32]. Counter ions
were added to neutralize the system. The temperature
of the bath was set to 300 K and the coupling time constant was set to 0.1 ps [33]. The box pressure was maintained at 1 bar using 1 ps time constant and a water
compressibility of 4.5 × 10-5 bar-1. A cut off radius of 1
nm was used in the simulation for non-bonded interactions. After equilibrating the system, a 2-nanosecond
(ns) production simulation was conducted with a 1 femtosecond (fs) time step at a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 300 K.

A binding region is identified by a cluster of hydrophobic and hydrophilic alpha spheres; each of which marks
their own environments. Ligand atoms are matched to
the corresponding alpha spheres during the docking
process. The alpha spheres are used to calculate the
shape complementarity of small molecules fitting into
macromolecules, as well as the binding affinities of the
conformers. The above method may generate bound
conformations that approach crystallographic resolutions
[42]. The ligand explores the conformational space to
locate the most favorable binding orientation and conformation by aligning and matching all triangles of the
template points with compatible geometry, while the
protein atoms remain fixed. For each ligand, 100 poses
were generated and scored in an effort to determine the
favorable binding modes. An affinity scoring function,
ΔG, was employed to rank candidate poses. In addition,
we employed the triangle matcher method that generates poses in a systematic manner and more accurate
way than the alpha triangle method by aligning the
ligand triplet of atoms with the triplet of alpha spheres
in cavities of tight atomic packing. The docking process
accounted for the thioester carboxyl groups of ligands.
Poses from the molecular database for each ligand were
scored based on complementarity with binding pocket
alpha spheres.

Binding site selection and exploration

The Site Finder module of MOE 2008.10 was used to
identify the possible substrate binding pockets within
the newly generated 3D structure of the R domain.
Hydrophobic or hydrophilic alpha spheres served as
probes denoting zones of tight atom packing. These
alpha spheres were used as centroids for the creation of
dummy atoms used to define potential sites throughout
the docking process [34,35].

(ii) ASEDock
Reductase domain-ligand docking

The reductase substrates included linear peptides such
as alamethicin (1AMT), antiamoebin I (1GQ0),

Alpha Sphere based protein-ligand Docking (ASEDock)
is a novel fast-docking program written in scientific vector language (SVL) (MOE platform) and based on the

Manavalan et al. BMC Structural Biology 2010, 10:1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/10/1

alpha shape method. Ligand atoms have alpha spheres
within 1 Å. Based on this property, concave models can
be created and ligand atoms from a large number of
conformations generated by superimposition with these
points can be evaluated and scored by maximum overlap with alpha spheres and minimum overlap with the
receptor atoms. The ligand conformations were subjected to energy minimization using the MMF94S force
field [41] and when converged, reproduced the experimentally bioactive conformations. The scoring function
used by ASEDock is based on protein-ligand interaction
energies. The docking process took into account the
thioester group of the substrate. Poses from the molecular databases for each ligand were ranked based on Utotal. For each ligand, 500 conformations were generated
using the default systematic search parameters in the
ASEDock module. Five thousand poses per conformation were randomly placed onto the alpha spheres
located within the large receptor site. From the resulting
500,000 poses, the 200 poses with the lowest U total
values were selected for further optimization with the
MMF94S force field. During the refinement step, the
ligand was free to move within the rigid binding pocket.
Validation of the R domain ligand docking via VRvestitone docking

The two docking methods described above were used to
assess the validity of the docking predictions based on the R
domain-linear substrates (alamethicin, antiamoebin I, trichotoxin, chryospermin and gramicidin) by calculating possible bound conformations of the vestitone-VR. The crystal
structure of VR (2P4H, devoid of ligand) was retrieved from
PDB and the vestitone ligand was downloaded from PubChem for docking. Vestitone-VR docking poses were
obtained using MOE-Dock 2008.10 and ASEDock and then
compared with the original crystal structure reports.

Results
BLAST analysis of the C-terminal linker

The NRPS-PKS search predicted the following domains
for TPS: 18 A, 18 C, 18 T, KS, AT, ACP, and a 422
amino-acid-long C-terminal linker (Figure 1A). A
BLAST analysis of this C-terminal linker region revealed
a high similarity to several NRPS reductases from different sources, as well as other proteins such as male sterility protein and NADPH-dependent reductases. Among
1000 hits (proteins) obtained from the BLAST analysis,
ten (including our query, peptaibol) were previously
characterized, well-known R domains. While the
synthases that are involved in the biosynthesis of myxalamid, myxochelin A, BT peptide, lyngbyatoxin, peptaibols, glycopeptidolipid and gramicidin have been
experimentally shown to reduce their substrates to corresponding alcohol via a four-electron reduction

reaction [9,15,40,43-48], nostocyclopeptide, lys2 and
saframycin are known to reduce their substrates to corresponding aldehyde via a two-electron reduction
[49-51]. By using the neighbor-joining method, we
inferred the phylogeny between these characterized proteins. Figure 1B shows the cladogram, which suggested
that the TPS sequence is most closely related to the
characterized proteins. Additionally, all of these proteins
show the highly conserved GXXGXXG motif for
NADPH binding and the SYK catalytic triad, which is
represented by black and green asterisks (Figure 2A).
Threading analysis of the R domain

The lack of a crystal structure for any R domain from
the NRPS biosynthetic pathway and the high degree of
sequence divergence in this family prompted us to use
threading and fold recognition approaches. The GenTHREADER and PHYRE fold recognition prediction
servers were used for threading analysis because they
have the potential to reveal structural similarities in the
absence of a high degree of similarity among sequences.
All of the C-terminal linkers of the characterized proteins with differing lengths that were identified by the
NRPS-PKS program were analyzed using both fold
recognition servers (Table 1). The fold prediction hits
with the highest level of statistical significance corresponding to p-values lower than 0.0001 were labeled as
CERTAIN by the GenTHREADER server, while hits
having p-values between 0.0001 and 0.001 were labeled
as HIGH. We considered only those matches labeled as
CERTAIN or HIGH by GenTHREADER or having a
precision of 100% in the case of fold prediction by
PHYRE. All 10 sequences matched the structure of SDR
proteins in the PDB. These findings demonstrate that
the R domain present in the NRPS protein would adopt
a fold similar to that of the SDR family members in
other organisms. The structures were aligned consistently with all of the sequences by both servers and had
a maximum sequence identity and alignment with the
query sequences. Such high sequence identities were
chosen as structural templates for the R domains of the
NRPS proteins. The structure of the VR (PDB code
2p4h; 310 residues) and a dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase
(PDB code 1r6d; 322 residues) showed alignment with
most R domains. However, considering the alignment
length and length of the query sequence, 2p4h was
selected as a template for the R domain for further analysis. These results suggest that the R domains present
in NRPS proteins are likely to be around 300 amino
acids long. In addition, we used 2p4h as the baseline
point and superimposed it onto the PDB structures
listed in Table 1. The root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) ranged from 1.8 Å to 4.2 Å, indicating that all
of the structures have similar folds.

identical but relatively similar based on their properties. Small blocks: residues are somewhat conserved with respect to structure or function. The
absence of blocks indicates no appreciable structure/function conservation. Gaps in one sequence relative to the other are indicated by dashes.
The UCSF chimera visualization system was used to generate this figure [64].

Database search for multidomain proteins containing R
domains

Next, we performed a BLAST search for 10 characterized proteins against the nr database to identify multidomain proteins containing the R domain. We eliminated
single-domain proteins from the search results because
our query was a multidomain protein and the cutoff
amino acids length was ≥ 1000. Table 2 shows the program outputs categorized based on their classification in
the NCBI database. This result showed that 57% of the

R domains are present in NRPS and PKS gene clusters
as multidomains, 31% were hypothetical and putative,
and 12% were from other sources. Among the 252 multidomain proteins (Additional file 1), 226 proteins (92%)
contained putative R domains at their extreme C-termini end, which might be involved in the product termination, while a stretch of 100-120 amino acids was
present adjacent to the putative R domain at the Cterminal in the remaining 26 proteins. We collected
these 26 protein sequences from the NCBI protein

*The PDB IDs are listed for the structures that were aligned with these sequences during fold recognition analysis using the GenTHREADER and PHYRE servers. The results from GenTHREADER corresponding to
confidence levels of CERTAIN and HIGH are labeled as C and H respectively. Similarly, PHYRE results corresponding to a precision level of 100% are labeled as {100}. (-) indicates the absence of a particular fold.

database and analyzed them by CDD (Additional file
2). The results revealed that these regions had short
dehydrogenase (SD) domains with partial alignment,
and that the e-value cutoff was less than the standard
cutoff. These findings suggest that no other domain
flanks the R domain. An earlier report suggested that
the chemical structure of gramicidin A shows a fourelectron reduction of the respective thioester, and that
the second NADPH-dependent dehydrogenase LgrE,
which is encoded by 3 kb upstream of the gene, is
required to reduce an aldehyde intermediate into a primary alcohol product [47]. However, our analysis
clearly showed that there is no second reductive
domain like LgrE.
Homology modeling of the R domain

The R domain sequence has a low sequence identity
(~20.5%) with VR, for which the 3D structure is available in the PDB (Pdb code: 2p4h). Although this identity level is not enough for homology modeling, its
high similarity with VR (~44%), as suggested by our
threading analysis, enabled us to model the R domain.
The secondary structure of the R domain primary
sequence predicted by the PHD server is shown in
Additional file 3. The protein sequence features alternating a helices and b strands. The a helices account
for 31.5% of the residues, while the b strands account
for 16.5%. Specifically, the a helices are located at residues 13-26, 40-51, 66-69, 87-94, 122-133, 179-190,
219-227, 253-260, 280-289 and 300-312. The results
predicted by MOE were similar to those predicted by
the PHD server. The major difference among the predictions of PHD and MOE was that the MOE showed
additional two strands (53-55 and 62-64) and a helix
(146-149).
The alignment of the primary structure of the R
domain along with its template, 2p4h, was used to

construct the model (Figure 2B). Ten structures with
different side chain conformations were obtained from
the MOE-Homology model. These initial modeled structures were minimized by the coarse minimization procedure. The best energetic model with the highest packing
score from these 10 models was used for further analysis. The final model of the R domain is superimposed
with the template (2p4h) as shown in Figure 3A (left).
The R domain was characterized as a non-metallo-oxidoreductase and contained the conserved Ser, Tyr and
Lys (SYK) catalytic triad, which encompasses a Rossmann fold necessary for NADPH binding. It has been
proposed that Tyr hydroxyl is the proton donor involved
in the electrophilic attack on the substrate carbonyl in a
reduction reaction. Lys facilitates the proton transfer
from the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr to the substrate. Ser
participates in catalysis by stabilizing the reaction intermediates [52]. A comparison of our 3D model of the R
domain with its template VR revealed several interesting
structural differences. Two b strands (b3 and b11) and
two helices (a7 and a11) are lost in the R domain,
while the rest of the regions are identical with an RMSD
(Ca coordinates) value of 2.34 Å (Figure 3A (left)).
Evaluation of the reductase domain model

The final substrate-free model of the R domain was
examined for the distribution of F and Ψ angles using
Ramachandran plots generated within the MOE. The
evaluation indicated that only 4 of 320 residues (1.25%)
in the R domain are present in the outlying region, and
that these residues were located far away from the active
site of the model. Therefore, no further refinement of
the model was required. The 3D structure profiles of
both the R domain and 2p4h produced by the verify 3D
structure evaluation server are shown in Figure 3B. The
scores for nearly all residues in peptaibol were within
reasonable regions. All of the above tests demonstrate
that there is no structurally unreasonable region in the
modeled 3D structure of the R domain and that the
structure is satisfactory.
Structural refinement and stability evaluation

The modeled reductase structure was refined and
assessed for stability using MD simulation. The MD
simulation is useful for identification of potential problems that may lead to instability of the modeled structure. After minimization and equilibration (~360 ps), 2ns MD simulation was performed and data were collected for analysis. The potential energy (Epot) of the R
domain is shown in Additional file 4. The potential
energy decreases gradually from the start and then fluctuates around a flat basal line after ~1200 ps. The flat
basal line indicates that the system is energetically stable
after ~1200 ps. The RMSD value of the Ca atom

around 2.7 Å, with small fluctuations after about 800 ps.
These findings suggest that proteins remain stable after
reaching equilibrium. The RMSD between the initial
modeled structure and the final refined structure is
around 2.1 Å. The RMSD from the starting structure
for all backbone Ca atoms as a function of simulation
time is shown in Figure 4C. The modeled structure of
the R domain is stable with both Rossmann fold and Cterminal substrate binding. The refined structure was
further evaluated by the Procheck program [53] and the
results are shown in Figure 3C. Most (96.4%) residues
were found to fall in favored and additionally allowed
regions, while the remaining 3.6% of the residues fell

[26] is that our docking protocol is able to reproduce
their reported near-native VR-vestitone complex. Therefore, we believe that our protocol is reliable and we
used it in the subsequent docking calculations.

within the generously allowed regions. Thus, it is
expected that the structural quality of the R domain
model is sufficient for use in the investigation of protein-ligand docking.
Docking validation of known vestitone-VR complexes

To evaluate our docking simulation, the crystal structure
of VR (pdb code: 2p4h) and its ligand, vestitone, were
downloaded from Pubchem and used to conduct two
different docking simulations. The dominating clusters
from the MOE-Dock 2008.10 and ASEDock docking
simulations were found to have the same binding orientation when compared with the original VR crystal
structure reported by Shao et al. [26]. Because the VR
crystal structure does not contain the ligand, vestitone,
the authors docked the ligand in the active site, then
minimized the energy and elucidated the reaction
mechanism. However, the similarity between the present
docked poses and the residues reported by Shao et al.

The T domain in the final module transfers the substrates to the adjacent R domain through its 4’-phospopantetheine arm. Because the focus of this study was to
elucidate the reaction taking place inside the R domain,
and since the entire T domain is not involved in the
reaction process, we did not include the entire T
domain in our docking, but only its phosphopantetheine
arm mimic. The refined structure of the R domain was
employed in a docking simulation (MOE-Dock 2008.10)
with the linear substrates alamethicin, antiamoebin I,
trichotoxin, chrysopermin and gramicidin (Figure 1C).
These five linear substrates are close structural analogs;
therefore, it is not surprising that these ligands can be
found in the same binding site in the R domain. Considering that R domain docking of the linear substrates
employed an unbiased approach entirely independent of
VR docking of its vestitone substrate, the overlap of alamethicin, antiamoebin I, trichotoxin, chrysopermin and
gramicidin present in the reductase binding sites with
the vestitone site of the analogous region of the VR
crystal structure was found to be remarkable (Figure
4A). The coincidence of the substrate binding pockets
within the reductase and VR proteins, which are highly
dissimilar in sequence that recognizes structurally dissimilar substrates, in part validates the present R domain
model.
The pocket near the catalytic site, which is presumably
a substrate-binding site, is formed by loop a6-a7, loop
b7-b6, helices a6, a7 and a8, and strands b6, b9 and
b11. The amino acids that play a pivotal role in substrate recognition and catalysis are Ser145, Thr150,
Val151, Val155, Asn170, Tyr171, Glu172, Tyr176,
Leu177, Lys180, Asn210, Asp220, Asn221, Tyr224,
M241 and D246 (Figure 4B). A close-up view of the
peptidyl thioester substrates in the binding site (Figure
4A) shows an extensive spatial overlap of the predicted
best poses, despite the variety of docking methods
employed. The bound conformation of the ligand present in the R domain suggests that the thioester oxygen
atom of all of the substrates can form a strong hydrogen
bond with the OH group of Tyr176. Apart from these
common and important interactions for all ligands, the
other following interactions are possible: (i) The Nterminal amine group of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid1
(AIB1) of chryospermin forms a H-bond with the
COOH group of Glu172, (ii) Chryospermin establishes a

of Gln3 form a H-bond with the carboxamide side
chains of Asn242 and Asn221, respectively, and (xi) A
hydrophobic interaction of trichotoxin with Leu177,
Met241 and Val245.
The interaction energies (E int ) for the substrates
within the active site were calculated using the
AMBER94 force field (Table 3). The interaction energies
for the thioester carboxyl atoms were ≈ -38.911 kcal
mol-1. As expected, the simulations suggested that the
majority of the stabilization energy of the thioester oxygen atom in the receptor site is due to the hydrophobic
interaction or van der Waals forces between them, with
a lesser contribution from electrostatic interactions. In
addition, the final docked complexes were further verified for the reactivity of the substrate using the Oprea
topological rule [54]. All of the substrates within the
active site of the R domain showed that thioester is
reactive. To test the activity of the intermediate aldehyde, we deleted SNAc from all of the substrates in the
docked complex, and then conducted energy minimization. The results showed that the aldehyde of the substrate is reactive. These findings indicate that the R
domain is capable of conducting two steps in the reduction reaction. The MOE 2008.10 software was used to

Finally, we placed a NADPH in the R domain receptor
site by superimposing 1Y1P (which has one NADPH
molecule) onto the R domain, after which we minimized
the energy (Figure 4A). NADPH consists of three fragments, adenine monophosphate (AMP), nicotinamide
mononucleotide (NMN) and a phosphate (PO4) group.

Binding site comparison

The difference in the VR and reductase dockings and
the catalytic activities were further evaluated by detailed
analysis of the predicted binding sites using Computed
Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins (CASTp) analysis [55,56]. Based on the results of this analysis, the
binding site volumes without the various channels
extending from the surface of the protein surface were
estimated to be 2700 Å and 1733 Å for reductase and
VR, respectively. The volume difference among the R
domain and its template (VR) indicated a larger binding
site for the R domain; therefore, the R domain can
accept the substrate with the larger size.

Discussion
The sequence-structure alignment plays a major role in
providing reasonable and accurate structural predictions.
However, in the case of low sequence identity, MOE has
been employed to generate reasonable models for
unknown 3D structures [57]. Because our sequence identity was low, we utilized MOE for homology modeling.
The structural properties of the modeled R domain were
further assessed for stability using MD simulation. The
refined model generated during the MD simulation possessed satisfactory geometric parameters and was therefore
used in the investigation of the ligand-protein interaction.
Docking calculations are generally used to predict
ligand-protein conformations and help perform virtual
screening of compounds present in chemical databases
to identify therapeutic lead compounds [58-60]. Generally, the docking calculation is conducted when the location of the binding site is known or assumed. However,
no docking calculations take full advantage of the pharmacologically characterized ligands when selecting the
most feasible binding site. In the present study, two different docking approaches were employed to evaluate
probable reductase binding sites by performing docking
calculations using structurally linear, well characterized
ligands as molecular probes.
Despite the different protein sequences and cognate
substrate molecules, all ligand docking algorithms were
located on the optimal binding pocket for alamethicin,
trichotoxin, antiamoebin I, chrysopermin and gramicidin
within the R domain model that was superimposable
with the vestitone-VR docked structure (Figure 4A). The
complex obtained by docking analysis had a critical
hydrogen bond between the Tyr176-OH group of the
reductase catalytic site and the C-terminal end of thioester oxygen of the substrate. In addition, the Glu220
carboxylic group of the R domain was located within

Page 11 of 14

the H-bond distance to the thiol group of the substrate.
The protonation state of glutamic acid was stabilized
through a hydrogen bonding. Considering the H-bond
length, we found that Tyr176 was located at 2.6 Å from
Glu220, maximizing the process of proton stabilization
in Glu220 through a H-bond.
Further, our docking studies clearly indicated that the
R domain was not influenced by the substrate amino
acid chain. We have used five different substrates,
whose last amino acids (L-configuration) of each substrate are Trp, Pro, Val, Phe and ethanolamine (ETA),
respectively. Though they have different physiochemical
properties, they bind exactly the same orientation with
the R domain. Our findings are also supported by the
study conducted by Schracke et al. [47], in which the
substrate specificity of the R domain was evaluated by
synthesizing Leu12-Trp13-Leu14-Leu15-Gly16-S-CoA and
subsequently replacing Gly 16 with Leu, Ala, Asp, Phe
and Lys. They showed that R domain appears to be
unspecific for the substrates.
Because the substrate lengths were ≈18-20 amino acids,
we used the C-terminal end slots of 3, 4, 5 and 6 amino
acids (residues) for the docking experiment to determine
how many residues from the substrates could be accommodated in the active site of the R domain to catalyze the
reaction mechanism. We found that the final 4 residues
of the substrates bind in the active site, but that if there
are greater than 4 residues the slot overlaps with the
NADPH binding site. These results strongly imply that
only the final four residues bind in the same catalytic
site, while the remaining residues face away from the catalytic site and might be involved in the interaction with
the side chain of the modeled R domain.
A BLAST search for R domains and our sequence analysis of primary alcohol products that possess a single R
domain, such as myxalamid, lyngbyatoxin and peptaibols
[9,15,40,43-48] clearly indicated that the reduction reaction took place in a single R domain, and that there is no
other specific domain flanking the R domain. Based on
this analysis, we suggest that the R domain catalyzes the
reduction of acyl thioester into a primary alcohol product.
Further, our docking studies identified two amino acids,
Tyr176 and Glu220, which act as proton donors in the
catalytic site of the R domain and are highly conserved
among the characterized R domains (Figure 2A, marked
by green and red asterisks). Therefore, we propose the following reduction reaction mechanism (Figure 6). During
the first round of the reduction reaction, the substrate (e.g.
alamethicin) binds with the R domain (active site), after
which a hydrogen bond between the acyl thioester oxygen
of the substrate and the OH group of Tyr176 (present in
the active site) induces a partial carbonium ion characteristic in the thioester carbon. This facilitates the first
hydride transfer from the C4 atom of NADPH to acyl

Manavalan et al. BMC Structural Biology 2010, 10:1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/10/1

thioester, forming a thioacetal and a NADP+. The hydrolysis of the C-S bond in the thioacetal forms an aldehyde
bound to the Tyr176. Next, the phosphopantetheinyl sulfur (S-) accepts a proton from COOH group of Glu220
present in the active site, which results in the release of a
phosphopantetheine SH group, at which point the second
round of reduction can take place in the active site. However, before the second round of the reduction reaction,
the previous NADP + will be released and the second
NADPH will bind to the same Rossmann fold. During the
second round of reduction, Tyr176, which is the proton
donor of the carbonyl oxygen of the bound aldehyde, facilitates the second hydride transfer from NADPH, forming
and releasing a primary alcohol. During this step, Tyr176
acts as a general base that is critically involved in the catalysis, which is known to be a common function of Tyr
among all SDR family members [52]. It should be noted
that this type of four electron reduction of peptidyl thioester into a corresponding alcohol product has only been
briefly predicted by Read et al. [40] and Li et al [46]. Also,
similar to the R domain, there are two other enzymes, 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and
UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPDH), which can catalyze mechanistically related four-electron reduction (or
oxidation) reactions [61,62]. Thus our study indicates that
a terminal R domain may be responsible for the frequently
used reductive release mechanism in NRPS systems.
However, a few studies have reported that free aldehyde products such as nostocyclopeptide, lys2 and saframycin are observed soon after the first round of the
reduction reaction [49-51]. The basis for aldehyde
release has not yet been explored and very few modeling
reports are available to predict the reason for these findings. Although our modeling studies were not able to
identify the mechanism by which the intermediate aldehyde can be released or remain in the same R domain
and subsequently undergo a second round of reduction,
we attempted to predict the reason for the observed
behavior with the aid of threading analysis. Threading
analysis showed that the alcohol-forming R domain (e.g.,
glycopeptidolipid) had 20.5% sequence identity with the
selected template, 2p4h, while an aldehyde-forming R
domain (e.g. saframycin) showed only 15% sequence

Figure 6 Scheme of the reaction mechanism proposed for the
R domain. The two steps of the reduction reaction from the
peptidyl thioester to the primary alcohol are shown, and the roles
proposed for the key catalytic residues Tyr176 and Glu220 are
indicated.

identity with 2p4h. This prevents modeling of the aldehyde-forming R domain because modeling is generally
only feasible when the sequence identity is >20%
[16,63]. Additionally, the target-template homology
between the aldehyde-forming R domain (e.g. saframycin) and 1r6d was < 17%, which also makes modeling of
the aldehyde-forming R domain difficult. These findings
indicate that there may be a structural difference
between the alcohol- and aldehyde-forming R domains.
The only limitation at present is the lack of a suitable
template for modeling aldehyde-forming R domains to
explore their function. Further studies in this direction
are required to gain a complete understanding of the
aldehyde-forming R domains.

Conclusions
The results of receptor modeling and docking simulations demonstrate that, in NRPS proteins, the R
domain always resided at the extreme C-terminal end
that catalyzes the reduction of acyl thioester into its
primary alcohol via an aldehyde intermediate through
the four-electron reduction reaction. This four-electron
reduction reaction was clearly described herein. Our
study not only provides insight into the unknown TPS
reaction mechanism, but also serves a starting point
for identifying point mutations in active site residues
that can enhance the selectivity and activity of the
substrate.
