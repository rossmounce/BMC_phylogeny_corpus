Abstract
Background: Prolificacy is the most important trait influencing the reproductive efficiency of pig
production systems. The low heritability and sex-limited expression of prolificacy have hindered to
some extent the improvement of this trait through artificial selection. Moreover, the relative
contributions of additive, dominant and epistatic QTL to the genetic variance of pig prolificacy
remain to be defined. In this work, we have undertaken this issue by performing one-dimensional
and bi-dimensional genome scans for number of piglets born alive (NBA) and total number of
piglets born (TNB) in a three generation Iberian by Meishan F2 intercross.
Results: The one-dimensional genome scan for NBA and TNB revealed the existence of two
genome-wide highly significant QTL located on SSC13 (P < 0.001) and SSC17 (P < 0.01) with effects
on both traits. This relative paucity of significant results contrasted very strongly with the wide
array of highly significant epistatic QTL that emerged in the bi-dimensional genome-wide scan
analysis. As much as 18 epistatic QTL were found for NBA (four at P < 0.01 and five at P < 0.05)
and TNB (three at P < 0.01 and six at P < 0.05), respectively. These epistatic QTL were distributed
in multiple genomic regions, which covered 13 of the 18 pig autosomes, and they had small
individual effects that ranged between 3 to 4% of the phenotypic variance. Different patterns of
interactions (a × a, a × d, d × a and d × d) were found amongst the epistatic QTL pairs identified
in the current work.
Conclusions: The complex inheritance of prolificacy traits in pigs has been evidenced by
identifying multiple additive (SSC13 and SSC17), dominant and epistatic QTL in an Iberian × Meishan
F2 intercross. Our results demonstrate that a significant fraction of the phenotypic variance of
swine prolificacy traits can be attributed to first-order gene-by-gene interactions emphasizing that
the phenotypic effects of alleles might be strongly modulated by the genetic background where they
segregate.

Background
In the last few years, a major breakthrough in the understanding of the genetic factors that shape complex traits
has been the demonstration that, in several species, a nonnegligible fraction of the genetic variance is explained by
epistatic interactions. The recent identification of multiple
epistatic QTL controlling complex traits in mice [1-4],
chickens [5,6], and in model organisms such as yeast [7]
and Drosophila melanogaster [8,9] has been a major
achievement in the understanding of the genetic nature of
complex traits. In addition, the discovery that gene expression is modulated, amongst others, by a plethora of regulatory RNAs with diverse functions and properties has
added a new and thick layer of complexity in the subsequent identification of the polymorphisms involved in
these interactions, since many of them might reside in
non-coding regions [10].
In domestic species, traits relying on reproductive physiology, such as prolificacy and fecundity, have a notable
impact on the financial outcome of farming enterprises.
In pigs, prolificacy is a complex trait that displays a low
heritability and strong heterosis [11]. One-dimensional
studies have reported the existence of several QTL affecting litter size in pigs [12-16]. However, only one of the
reported QTL was significant on a genome-wide level (p <
0.05) [16], and there was a general lack of positional concordance amongst different genome scans [17]. More
importantly, these QTL studies exclusively dissected the
additive and dominance components of litter size, thus
neglecting the analysis of epistatic interactions that, paradoxically, are expected to explain a substantial portion of
genetic variation of reproductive traits [18]. In consequence, many unsolved questions concerning to the
genetic architecture of pig prolificacy still remain to be
answered. Which are the specific contributions of dominance and epistasis in modelling the phenotypic expression of this complex trait? If epistasis is important, which
are the dimensions, geometry and intricacy of the network
of interacting loci and which types of epistatic interactions
are more relevant? In a cross between two inbred mice
strains Peripato et al. [3] demonstrated the existence of
eight interacting QTL that explain almost 49% of the phenotypic variance of litter size in this cross. These results
highlighted the importance of non additive genetic variance as a fundamental component of prolificacy. Nevertheless, laboratory mice strains are usually bred in a very
stable environment, where fluctuations are kept to a minimum, and they have been the subject of an intense process of genetic selection without parallel in any other
mammal species. Moreover, mice belong to a different
superorder (Euarchontoglires) than most of mammalian
domestic species (Laurasiatheria), so it is reasonable to
expect that in these two distantly related taxonomic
groups the biology of reproduction can differ in many
instances.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/636

The relevance of the aforementioned questions led us to
analyse the genetic architecture of prolificacy traits in pigs.
In this way, we have performed an F2 intercross between
two distinct European and Asian breeds, the Iberian and
Meishan porcine breeds. Chinese Meishan is one of the
most prolific pig breeds of the world being an excellent
candidate population to perform these kinds of studies
[19]. Iberian is an autochthonous Spanish breed with a
very low prolificacy [20]. There is a very marked phenotypic difference for prolificacy traits between these two
breeds (around 7 piglets per parity), being 14.3 the mean
for the number of piglets born alive per parity of the Meishan breed [19] and 7.0 the mean for this trait of the Iberian
Guadyerbas strain [20]. Interestingly, the ancestors of these
breeds are assumed to have diverged at least 150,000 years
before present without subsequent introgressions [21]. In
consequence, it is reasonable to expect that these breeds
have evolved, since then, by following independent processes of artificial selection and genetic drift, thereby establishing different adaptive epistatic genetic complexes [22].
In the current work, we have performed both a onedimensional and a bi-dimensional genome-wide scans for
prolificacy traits by employing this Iberian by Meishan F2
intercross as a genetic resource. Our main objective was to
elucidate if epistasis makes a major contribution in shaping the phenotypic variability of prolificacy in pigs.

Results
Phenotypic data recorded in the F2 sows and linkage map
A description of the data and statistics of phenotypic
records of number of piglets born alive (NBA) and total
number of piglets born (TNB) in the F2 population is
given in Table 1. The phenotypic variance was 10.24 and
9.61 for TNB and NBA, respectively. The linkage map of
the 115 markers used in the QTL analyses is shown in
Table 2. Marker order and distances as well as average
chromosome lengths were in general agreement with
other mapping projects and the USDA genome database
http://www.animalgenome.org/pig/. Markers provided
coverage of the 18 autosomes, with intervals between
adjacent markers that were below 20 cM whenever possible. The average marker interval was 17.6 cM (sex-averaged map distance).

Position of the marker; 2 SSC, Sus Scrofa Chromosome

One dimensional genome scan for TNB and NBA
Results of the whole-genome scan using a single-QTL
model for TNB and NBA are summarized in Table 3. Two
genome-wide highly significant QTL were identified on
SSC13 (P < 0.001) and SSC17 (P < 0.01) at similar positions for both traits. In SSC13, the single QTL for NBA and
TNB were found at positions 50 and 55 cM, respectively
(Table 3), sharing an overlapping region located between
markers SW398 and SW2440. The most likely position for

the QTL found on SSC17 was at 22 cM for both traits
(Table 3).
Highly significant additive and dominance effects were
detected for the SSC13 and SSC17 QTL, although the
direction of these effects (Iberian vs. Meishan) depended
on the chromosome under consideration. For instance,
the QTL on SSC13 for NBA increased additively by 0.71 (±
0.18) piglets per copy of the Meishan allele and it had a
dominance effect of 0.69 (± 0.25) piglets. Conversely, the

Iberian allele was the one associated with an increase in
0.73 (± 0.19) piglets per copy for the QTL on SSC17.
Moreover, this QTL on SSC17 displayed a negative dominance effect (-0.82 ± 0.29). We estimated the degree of
dominance as the ratio d/a between the estimated dominance (d) and the absolute value of the additive effect (a).
Values of d/a larger than unity corresponds to overdominance, while a d/a ratio between 0 and 1 represents partial
dominance. In both cases (QTL on SSC13 and SSC17), the
estimated d/a values were consistent with a complete
dominance situation. Similar values of additive and dominance effects were obtained for the TNB QTL on SSC13
and SSC17 (Table 3), a result that is not surprising since
these two traits are highly correlated. Besides, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by these two single
QTL detected on SSC13 and SSC17 ranged from 2% to 3%
for both TNB and NBA.
Bi-dimensional genome scans for NBA and TNB
Identification of multiple interacting QTL for NBA and TNB
Results from the bi-dimensional genome scan for NBA are
shown in Table 4. Four bi-dimensional genome-wide
highly significant (P < 0.01) and five significant (P < 0.05)
epistatic interactions between QTL were found. We confirmed that all the observed epistatic interactions were
consistently detected across families rather than being the
consequence of a single sire effect, a feature that is particularly important when the number of founder males is
moderate or even small. The results obtained through the

likelihood ratio test were further confirmed by using other
approaches. First, a false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated based on the nominal P-values every 30 cM, with a
result of 0.018 for a P-value lower than 0.001. Moreover,
parametric bootstrapping confirmed the significance of
the results.
A graphical overview of the epistatic interactions for NBA
(red arrows) is shown in Figure 1. As much as twelve of
the 18 pig autosomes (1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15
and 18) were involved in these interactions, forming a
complex network with a non-radial geometry. This means
that a specific region did not interact simultaneously with
multiple loci, but with a very limited number of them
(usually interactions were one to one). For example, the
SSC12 region located at 11 cM, interacted significantly
with another SSC12 region at 89 cM (Figure 1; Table 4).
Similarly, two non-overlapping SSC6 QTL regions
showed epistatic interactions, one of them with QTL on
SSC1 and SSC7 (SSC6, 54-69 cM) and another one with
SSC14 (SSC6, 1-10 cM). As shown in Figure 1, other pig
chromosomes exhibiting more than one significant interacting QTL were SSC1 (at positions 76 and 153 cM respectively), and SSC7 (at positions 28 cM, and 107 cM). An
interesting feature of our analysis was that the highly significant NBA QTL identified in the one-dimensional
genome scan (SSC13 at 50 cM and SSC17 at 22 cM) did
not show any significant epistatic interaction with other
regions across the genome, meaning that its mode of

action is purely additive. In contrast, a NBA QTL found on
another region of SSC13 (73 cM) had significant epistatic
interactions with a QTL located at position 4 cM of SSC9.
Similarly, in mice, Peripato et al. [3] identified two significant QTL for litter size in a one-dimensional genome scan
(chromosomes 7 and 12) that did not emerge in the bidimensional analysis (chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 11, 14, 15
and 18). In the light of these results and ours, we could
conclude that there is a low concordance between the QTL
identified in one- and bi-dimensional genome scans. This
means that, in general, the additive and epistatic components of prolificacy traits encompass different sets of
genes.
With regard to the bi-dimensional genome-wide scan for
TNB, we found three genome-wide highly significant (P <

0.01) and six significant (P < 0.05) epistatic interactions
(Table 5; Figure 1). Thirteen out of the 18 pig autosomes
were involved in the epistatic QTL interactions for both
traits. However, the network of interacting QTL for TNB
was not identical to the one reported for NBA. In this
sense, only around one third of the QTL epistatic interactions detected in the current study were coincident in both
traits. This was an unexpected result since NBA and TNB
display a high genetic correlation (rg~ 0.9) and they are
expected to share a similar genetic architecture [11]. Moreover, the number of chromosomes displaying multiple
interactions was higher for TNB (SSC1, 7, 12, 13 and 14)
than for NBA. Notably, four epistatic QTL on SSC7
showed significant interactions with QTL located on SSC6
(60 cM), SSC13 (77 cM) and SSC1 (79 cM and 139 cM,
respectively). Other epistatic interactions involved two

overlapping regions of SSC13 with one region of SSC7
and one SSC9 QTL, a feature that demonstrates the
remarkable complexity and intricacy of these networks.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that if we would have
assumed a type 1 error α = 0.10, which corresponds to a
genome-wide critical value of 25.14 for the LR test, we
would have been able to detect 11 and 9 additional epistatic interactions between QTL across the genome for
NBA and TNB, respectively (results not shown).
Partition of the phenotypic variance explained by epistatic QTL
We estimated the proportion of the phenotypic variance
explained by epistatic genetic components for each TNB
and NBA significant epistatic QTL pair. This contribution
to the total phenotypic variance ranged from 3.26%
(SSC14-SSC15) to 4.04% (SSC12-SSC12) for TNB and
from 3.10% (SSC1-SSC6) to 3.62% (SSC9-SSC13) for
NBA. The relative contribution of epistasis to the total
phenotypic variance was estimated by adding the estimates of the partial epistatic effects of each epistatic interaction. The total phenotypic variance explained by the
joint genetic effects of all epistatic QTL pairs for NBA and
TNB was 37.6% and 42.4%, respectively. Nevertheless, we
would like to mention that this approach might lead to an
overestimation of the epistatic contribution because the
models employed in our analysis are exclusive [23]. We
have calculated the repeatability with a standard animal
model, resulting in an estimated value of 0.27 for both
TNB and NBA. This value should be considered as the

limit of the total variance explained by genetic effects. This
result evidences that our estimates of epistatic contributions are clearly overestimated but, in spite of this drawback, we think it is reasonable to assume that a significant
proportion of the phenotypic variance of prolificacy is
explained by the joint genetic effects of epistatic QTL.
Classification of epistatic effects for NBA and TNB
All four forms of epistasis (a × a, a × d, d × a and d × d)
were detected among the significant epistatic pairs. In
total, 9 a × a, 7 a × d, 11 d × a, and 16 d × d significant interactions were detected (Tables 4 and 5). For the SSC1-SSC6
(NBA) and SSC8-SSC14 (TNB) epistatic pairs, only one
type of epistasis was significant (d × d, and a × d, respectively); whereas, the remaining pairs presented two or
more types of epistasis, leading to more complex patterns
of interactions. We plotted the genotypic values expected
for each genotypic class (Figure 2), thus identifying 'dominance-by-dominance' and 'coadaptive' patterns of epistasis as described by Carlborg and Haley [18] and Carlborg
et al. [4]. The 'dominance-by-dominance' pattern of
epistasis was found in several epistatic QTL pairs and corresponded to interactions were a significant d × d effect
was found. In positive d × d interactions (Figure 2a), the
genotypic value of double heterozygotes I1M1-I2M2,
(being I = Iberian alleles and M = Meishan alleles for loci 1
and 2) was superior to that of simple heterozygotes (I1M1I2I2, I1M1-M2M2, I1I1-I2M2, and M1M1-I2M2); a pattern that
was reversed in negative d × d interactions (Figure 2b).

According to Carlborg and Haley [18], the 'coadaptive'
type of interaction occurs when positive a × a interaction
effect is significant. This form of epistasis leads to
enhanced performance of parental double homozygotes
(I1I1-I2I2 and M1M1-M2M2) in comparison to the hybrid
double homozygotes (I1I1-M2M2 or M1M1-I2I2). As an
example, we found this specific pattern of epistasis in the
NBA epistatic QTL pair SSC10-SSC15 (Figure 2c).
Additionally, we found another epistatic pattern where
only significant a × d and/or d × a effects were present.
These pairs of interacting QTL were included in a category
that we named 'additive-by-dominance' epistasis because
a × d and d × a interactions showed exactly the same pattern. In positive 'additive-by-dominance' interactions, one
locus is overdominant, neutral, or underdominant,
depending on the genotype at the second locus. Conversely, the second locus is additive, with the favoured
allele being dependent on the genotype at the first locus.
In negative 'additive-by-dominance' interactions, the genotypic values of homozygotes at one locus (_._I2I2 and
_._M2M2) deviate from what is expectable under an additive model only when the second locus is heterozygous
(I1M1-I2I2 and I1M1-M2M2, Figure 2d).
Finally, we considered as a separate category those QTL
pairs that could not be classified into any of the preceding
epistasis models. The main common feature of QTL pairs
gathered in this group was that they all had a significant a
× d or d × a epistatic term together with significant a × a
and/or d × d terms, leading to 'complex' patterns of interactions (Figure 2e). These complex patterns might be
explained by the existence of higher order interactions
involving more than two loci or simply because small
sample size for certain genotypic classes might lead to
inaccurate estimates of the epistatic effects.

Discussion
Identification of genome-wide significant QTL with
additive and dominant effects on pig prolificacy
In the single QTL analyses, we found two genome-wide
highly significant QTL located on SSC13 and SSC17
affecting NBA and TNB. So far, and to the best of our
knowledge, only one study has described a genome-wide
significant QTL (P < 0.05) detected at 88 cM on SSC15 for
NBA [16]. In the current work, the mode of gene action
strongly differed amongst QTL. For instance, the additive
effect detected for the SSC13 QTL stemmed from the Meishan breed, and determined an increase of 0.71 and 0.61
piglets for NBA and TNB, respectively. This result is in
agreement with the phenotypic differences observed
between the purebred parental lines. Conversely, beneficial alleles for the QTL found on SSC17 appeared to derive
from the Iberian breed, with increases of 0.73 and 0.68
piglets for NBA and TNB, respectively. These cryptic Iberian QTL alleles, which increase prolificacy, provide a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/636

compelling example of the complexity of the genetic
architecture of these traits. In addition, significant dominance effects were also detected for the two mentioned
QTL; however, the direction of the effects was complete
dominance for the QTL on SSC13, and recessivity for the
QTL at SSC17.
Our results confirm the existence of several previously
reported suggestive QTL for litter size in pigs. De Koning
et al. [13] described one suggestive QTL for TNB on SSC17
(43 cM) in an F2 cross between Meishan and commercial
Dutch lines. Bidanel et al. [24] reported a QTL for ovulation rate on SSC13 with a similar location (46 cM) and
effect (favourable dominant effect of the Meishan allele of
0.7 ova shed). The experiment of Bidanel et al. [24]
involved an F2 cross between the same Meishan population employed in our study and a Large White population.
Moreover, Cassady et al. [12] described a QTL for number
of stillborn piglets on SSC13 (101 cM), although its location is relatively distant to the one reported by us (50-55
cM). Other QTL for litter traits have been described on
SSC5, SSC6, SSC7, SSC8, SSC11, SSC14, SSC16 and
SSC18 [12-15,25]. However, and as mentioned above, the
majority of QTL reported in previous studies none
reached the genome-wide significant threshold while two
QTL identified in our study did. The most likely explanation for this discrepancy relies on the fact that most of previous experiments involved crosses between the Meishan
breed and other standard European pig populations, such
as Large White pigs, which have been shown to differ in
only three to five piglets born [26]. Moreover, standard
European breeds were strongly introgressed with Chinese
breeds in the 18-19th centuries and, in consequence, they
might not completely fulfil the assumptions and requirements of the F2 intercross design. Conversely, the Meishan
and Iberian breeds are highly divergent both at the phenotypic (about 7 piglets per parity) and genetic levels. In this
way, phylogenetic studies carried out with mitochondrial
DNA have revealed that the Iberian breed has never been
introgressed with Asian alleles [21]. Finally, the number of
available reproductive records was much larger in our
experiment (881 experimental data) than in previous
studies (between 200 and 400 experimental data) [1215,25].
Phenotypic variation of prolificacy traits is affected by a
complex network of epistatic QTL
The statistical evidence suggesting that epistasis might be
an important component of reproductive traits in mice [3]
led us to perform a bi-dimensional genome scan for NBA
and TNB. This analysis allowed us to demonstrate that
phenotypic variation of these traits can be strongly influenced by a complex network of interacting loci. In this
sense, this is the first study that shows genome-wide significant epistatic QTL affecting prolificacy in pigs. After
implementing the highly stringent Bonferroni correction

for multiple testing, as much as seven QTL interactions
remained significant at the 1% bi-dimensional genomewide level, whereas 11 were significant at the 5% genomewide level. Rather than identifying one or a few master
regions interacting with multiple loci (which would have
yielded a star-like geometry of interactions), we found
that most chromosomal regions interacted with a single
counterpart. However, almost all chromosomes in which
significant epistatic QTL were found participated in more
than one interaction. Five of the significant epistatic interactions detected had pleiotropic effects on both TNB and
NBA traits, whereas five were only related to TNB and
three to NBA. These surprising differences for two highly
genetically correlated traits [27], might be interpreted in
the light of the statistical values of the Likelihood ratio
obtained in the contrast between models and the stringent
bi-dimensional genome-wide threshold assumed. For
instance, the chromosome pair SSC10-SSC15 reached an
LR value of 29.41 (p < 0.05) for NBA and an LR value of
22.33 ("no significant") for TNB. Alternatively, there
might be a biological meaning behind the specific differences observed in the geometry of the NBA and TNB networks, thus indicating that although similar metabolic
and physiological pathways may be implicated in the regulation of both traits, other mechanisms may be operating independently.
Epistatic QTL for pig prolificacy display different types of
interactions
This genetic dissection of the epistatic component of prolificacy in pigs was completed with an analysis of the types
of interactions detected in the bi-dimensional genomewide scan. All the epistatic QTL had at least one significant
type of interaction (see tables 4 and 5). In total, nine pairs
showed additive by additive (a × a) epistasis, which in certain circumstances can have a 'nullification effect' because
epistasis might cancel out the effects of individual loci at
intermediate frequencies, making difficult to detect them
in a conventional one-dimensional genome scan [28].
Furthermore, seven pairs showed additive by dominance
(a × d) epistasis, eleven pairs showed dominance by additive (d × a) epistasis, and sixteen pairs showed dominance
by dominance (d × d) epistasis. All these forms of epistasis
contribute to heterosis [29]. It has been widely supported
that heterosis plays an important role in the genetic architecture of reproductive traits [11,12].

Several patterns of interactions among genotypes were
identified and classified according to Carlborg and Haley
[18] and Carlborg et al. [4]. Eight pairs were classified as
'dominance-by-dominance' and two pairs as 'coadaptive'
epistasis. The remaining QTL showed different patterns of
epistasis from those previously described in the literature
and were, therefore, grouped into two additional categories that we named 'additive-by-dominance' and 'com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/636

plex' epistasis. 'dominance-by-dominance' epistasis leads
to a deviated performance for the double heterozygotes
compared to single heterozygotes. Among the d × d interactions found in our study, six had positive sign (Figure
2a) and two had negative sign (Figure 2b). In positive d ×
d interactions, the genotypic value of the double homozygotes is superior to the simple heterozygotes. Conversely,
this pattern is reversed when the sign is negative. Coadaptive epistasis occurs when double homozygotes from the
same parental line show enhanced performance [18]. As
mentioned above, we only found two QTL pairs which
displayed this form of epistasis (Figure 2c). Coadaptive
epistasis is fundamental to interpret post-zygotic reproductive isolation [30-32]. In each parental population,
selection may have acted leading to fixation of different
alleles at the relevant loci regulating prolificacy in a way
that statistical epistasis is not apparent in either population. Second-generation hybrids (F2) exhibit combination
of alleles at different loci that were not present in any of
the parental breeds, leading to the disruption of "coadapted" gene pools and the appearance of new phenotypes.
The third category included two pairs where only a × d and
d × a effects were significant. We called this group 'additive-by-dominance' because the a × d and d × a interactions show the same patterns but with the roles of the loci
reversed (Figure 2d). Finally, we found QTL pairs which
show 'complex' patterns of interactions characterised by
having a significant a × d or d × a term together with significant a × a and/or d × d (Figure 2e). These interactions
yielded complex patterns in which the genotypic value for
a given genotype at one locus drastically changes depending on the genotype at the second locus.

Conclusions
In summary, the bi-dimensional genome scan of an Iberian × Meishan F2 intercross has allowed to demonstrate
that the genetic architecture of pig reproduction is mostly
built as a complex network of interacting genes rather
than being explained by the sum of the additive effects of
a yet to be defined number of loci. Individual epistatic loci
have moderate effects on the phenotypic variance of prolificacy and they are distributed in multiple chromosomal
locations. Moreover, they display several types of interactions that sometimes cannot be easily ascribed to well
defined models, thus suggesting the existence of additional interacting loci. In the next years, the fine mapping
and identification of the causal mutations that explain the
segregation of epistatic QTL in pigs will be a daunting but
fascinating task that will likely unveil many of the secrets
that underlie the biological grounds of complex traits.

Methods
Experimental design and phenotypic data
A three-generation F2 intercross between Iberian and Meishan pig breeds was generated to map prolificacy QTL.
Eighteen Meishan sows were randomly mated by artificial
insemination with three Iberian boars (Guadyerbas line) to
produce the F1 progeny in the INRA GEPA experimental
unit (Surgères, France). This F1 offspring was purchased
and transferred to NOVA GENÈTICA S. A. experimental
farm (Lleida, Spain) after weaning at 22-25 days of age. At
sexual maturity, eight F1 boars and 97 F1 sows were randomly selected to obtain an F2 progeny. The F1 sows produced only one litter and were slaughtered after weaning.
In total, 255 F2 reproductive sows were randomly selected
and mated to unrelated boars. They produced a total of
881 litters, i.e. 3.45 parities per F2 sow on average. The
number of piglets born alive (NBA) and the total number
of piglets born (TNB) were recorded at farrowing. Animals
were managed under standard intensive conditions; in all
cases, reproduction was carried out by artificial insemination. Protocols were approved by the Ethical and Animal
Care Committee at IRTA.
Microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism
genotyping
DNA was extracted from either frozen blood or tail tissue
using commercial protocols (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis). Purebred grandparents, F1 breeding pigs and the 255
F2 sows were genotyped for 115 markers: 109 microsatellites and 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Microsatellite loci were chosen based on their ease of scoring,
the absence of null alleles, their genomic location and
their informativeness. Microsatellite PCR products were
analyzed with the Genescan 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) in an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Single nucleotide polymorphisms markers in DBH, BMPR1β, PRLR and VCAM1
genes were analyzed with the SNapSHOT ddNTP primer
extension multiplex kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington,
UK) [33-36]. Moreover, two polymerase chain reaction
restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
markers were analysed: the MC1R gene G/A283 SNP was
genotyped by PCR-RFLP with NspI [37]. The PvuII estrogen receptor 1 polymorphism was genotyped following
Short et al. [38]. Linkage analysis was carried out by using
the 'build' option of the CRI-MAP 2.4 program [39].
Statistical analysis
NBA was considered to be the same trait across all parities
and the same criterion was applied to TNB. Two statistical
models were used to analyze the experimental data. The
first model was a one-dimensional QTL mapping performed using a regression approach [40], based on the following mixed model:

y ijkl = H i + O j + u k + p k + c aa + c d d + e ijkl

(1)

where yijk was the ijkth observation for NBA or TNB, Hi was
the ith year-season fixed effect, Oj was the jth order of parity
fixed effect, uk was the random polygenic effect of the kth
individual, pk was the random permanent environmental
effects for the kth individual, a was the QTL additive effect,
d was the dominance QTL effect and eijkl was the random
residual term; ca = pr(QQ) - pr(qq) and cd = 0.5pr(Qq) 0.5(pr(QQ) + pr(qq)), where pr(QQ) was the probability
of being homozygous of Iberian origin, pr(qq) was the
probability of being homozygous of Meishan origin and
pr(Qq) was the probability of being heterozygous. For
computational reasons, heritability (h2) and percentage
of permanent environmental effect (p2) were assumed to
be known. They were obtained from the posterior mode
of a previous Bayesian analysis. Estimates for h2 and p2
were 0.22 and 0.05, respectively. The analyses were performed at every centimorgan along the 2,017 cM of the 18
autosomes, by means of a likelihood ratio test (LR) comparing the models with and without the QTL effects.
Nominal P-values were calculated assuming a chi-squared
distribution of the LR test. Yet, nominal significance levels
cannot be used directly due to the large number of tests
performed. Hence, genome-wide significance levels were
calculated using a Bonferroni correction and assuming
independence between statistical tests every 30 cM. The
genome-wide critical values of LR test for level of significance associated with type I errors α = 0.10, 0.05, 0.01 and
0.001 were 13.36, 15.13, 18.27 and 23.22, respectively.
With regard to the two-QTL analyses, two different models were employed. The first model included the effects of
two non interacting QTL. The statistical mixed model was:
y ijkl = H i + O j + u k + p k + c a1a1 + c d1d1 + c a 2a 2 + c d 2d 2 + e ijkl

(2)
where a1 and a2 were the additive effects, d1 and d2 were the
dominance effects for QTL 1 and 2, respectively. The coefficients ca1, cd1, ca2 and cd2 were calculated as before for
locations 1 and 2.
The second model allowed for epistasis, i.e.:

y ijkl = H i + O j + u k + p k + c a1a1 + c d1d1 + c a 2d 2 + c d 2d 2 +
+c axa I axa + c axd I axd + c dxa I dxa + c dxd I dxd + e ijkl
(3)
where Ia × a, Ia × d, Id × a and Id × d were the additive × additive,
additive × dominance, dominance × additive and dominance × dominance epistatic interaction effects, respectively; ca × a, ca × d, cd × a and cd × d were the regression

coefficients calculated following Cockerham's model for
epistatic interactions [41,42], i.e.:
c axa = pr1(QQ)pr2(QQ) − pr1(QQ)pr2(qq) − pr1(qq)pr2(QQ) + pr1(qq)pr2(qq)
c axd = −0.5pr1(QQ)pr2(QQ) + 0.5pr1(QQ)pr2(Qq) − 0.5pr1(QQ)pr2(qq)
+0.5pr1(qq)pr2(QQ) − 0.5pr1(qq)pr2(Qq) + 0.5pr1(qq)pr2(qq)
c dxa = −0.5pr1(QQ)pr2(QQ) + 0.5pr1(QQ)pr2(qq) + 0.5pr1(Qq)pr2(QQ)
−0.5pr1(Qq)pr2(qq) − 0.5pr1(qq)pr2(QQ) + 0.5pr1(qq)pr2(qq)
c dxd = 0.25pr1(QQ)pr2(QQ) − 0.25pr1(QQ)pr2(Qq) + 0.25pr1(QQ)pr2(Qq)
−0.25pr1(Qq)pr2(QQ) + 0.25pr1(Qq)pr2(Qq) − 0.25pr1(Qq)pr2(qq)
+0.25pr1(qq)pr2(QQ) − 0.25pr1(qq)pr2(Qq) + 0.25pr1(qq)pr2(Qq)

The two-QTL analyses were performed using a full bidimensional genome scan. LR-tests comparing the models with and without the epistatic interaction effects
(model 3 vs model 2) were computed at 1 cM intervals
along the 2,017 cM of the 18 autosomes for each of the
two QTL, leading to a total of 2,069,595 regression analyses for both NBA and TNB. The values of h2 and p2 used in
this analysis were identical to those considered in model
1. The statistical contrast between models for evidence of
epistasis was carried out using an LR test with 4 degrees of
freedom in the numerator. As before, bi-dimensional
genome-wide levels of significance were calculated using
a Bonferroni correction assuming statistical independence
every 30 cM. The genome-wide critical values of LR test for
level of significance associated with type I errors α = 0.10,
0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 were 25.14, 26.68, 30.17 and 35.06
respectively. Confidence intervals for QTL location were
calculated using the Likelihood drop method [43].
Finally, we calculated the expected values of the nine genotypic classes using the Cockerham's F2-metric model
[42]. In addition, statistical significance was independently assessed by using an approach based on the False
Discovery Rate -FDR- [44], that was calculated based on
nominal P-values every 30 cM, as well as by employing a
parametric bootstrap method [45].
