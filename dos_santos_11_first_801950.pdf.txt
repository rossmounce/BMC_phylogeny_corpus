Abstract
Background: In Brazil dengue has been a major public health problem since DENV-1 introduction and spread in
1986. After a low or silent co-circulation, DENV-1 re-emerged in 2009 causing a major epidemic in the country in
2010 and 2011. In this study, the phylogeny of DENV-1 strains isolated in RJ after its first introduction in 1986 and
after its emergence in 2009 and 2010 was performed in order to document possible evolutionary patterns or
introductions in a re-emergent virus.
Findings: The analysis of the E gene sequences demonstrated that DENV-1 isolated during 2009/2010 still belong
to genotype V (Americas/Africa) but grouping in a distinct clade (lineage II) of that represented by earlier DENV-1
(lineage I). However, strains isolated in 2011 grouped together forming another distinct clade (lineage III).
Conclusions: The monitoring of DENV is important to observe the spread of potentially virulent strains as well to
evaluate its impact over the population during an outbreak. Whether explosive epidemics reported in Brazil caused
mainly by DENV-1 was due to lineage replacement, or due the population susceptibility to this serotype which has
not circulated for almost a decade or even due to the occurrence of secondary infections in a hyperendemic
country, is not clear. This is the first report of multiple lineages of DENV-1 detected in Brazil.
Keywords: Dengue virus type 1, multiple lineages, phylogeny, Rio de Janeiro

Findings
Dengue viruses (DENV) are the most important human
arboviruses worldwide, transmitted by mosquitoes of the
genus Aedes and currently it is estimated that 70 to 500
million dengue infections occur annually in 124 endemic
countries. Nearly 3.6 billion people (55% of world population) are at risk of contracting the disease [1]. The
rapid global spread of the four DENV serotypes (DENV1 to 4) in the last 50 years resulted in the dispersal of
genotypes associated with increased severity [2].
In Brazil, the State of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), in the
Southeast region (Figure 1A) has been important to the
epidemiology of dengue, with the introduction of
DENV-1 in 1986, DENV-2 in 1990 and DENV-3 in
2000 [3]. The latter was prevalent in the majority of
Brazilian States from 2002 to 2006 and, from 2007 to
2009 this serotype was displaced by DENV-2. In 2008,

the Southeast and the Northeast regions were responsible for approximately 80% of the cases reported in the
most severe epidemic in the country, where DENV-2
and DENV-3 were detected in 96.4% of the cases isolated. After a low or silent circulation, DENV-1 reemerged in the Southeast region in 2009 (Figure 1B)
and it was the serotype detected in 50.4% of the viral
isolations, displacing DENV-2 (30.5%) and DENV-3
(19.1%) [4].
DENV-1 falls into five distinct genotypes designated as
genotype I (Southeast Asia, China and East Africa), genotype II (Thailand), genotype III (Malaysia), genotype IV
(South Pacific) and genotype V (America/Africa) and
the existence of lineages with distinct geographic and
temporal relationships have been suggested [5,6]. Moreover, lineage turnover or replacements have become
more frequently common in phylogenetic studies. The
term “lineage” has been used non- officially to characterize those viruses clustered in clades in a taxonomic
level beneath genotype [7].

Neighbor-joining phylogenetic of ten complete envelope (E) gene sequences from DENV-1 isolated during two periods epidemiologically
distinct: 1986 (n = 2) when the serotype was first introduced and after its emergence in 2009-2011 (n = 8). The percentage of replicate trees in
which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. Black circles represent DENV-1
sequences generated in this study. DENV strains used were named as follows: GenBank accession number/country/year.

In this study, the phylogeny of DENV-1 strains isolated in RJ after its first introduction in 1986 and after
its emergence in 2009 and 2010 was performed in order
to document possible evolutionary patterns or introductions in a re-emergent virus. Phylogenetic studies may
constitute an important tool to monitor the introduction
and spread of viruses as well as to predict the potential
epidemiological consequences of such events.
The strains analyzed in this study belong to a collection obtained from acute phase human serum through
the passive surveillance system performed by the
Laboratory of Flavivirus, IOC/FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, from an ongoing Project approved by resolution
number CSN196/96 from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation
Ethical Committee in Research (CEP 274/05), Ministry

of Health-Brazil. To avoid mutations introduced by in
vitro passages of the virus in cell cultures we used
DENV-1 strains (n = 10; from 1986 [n = 2], 2009 [n =
3], 2010 [n = 4] and 2011 [n = 1]) extracted directly
from serum previously detected by RT-PCR or originally
isolated from cell culture when serum did not yield
enough volume for RNA extraction.
DENV-1 isolation was performed by inoculation into
C6/36 Aedes albopictus cell line [8] and isolates were
identified by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT)
using serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies [9]. RT–
PCR for detecting and typing DENV from serum was
performed as described previously [10]. For RT-PCR
and sequencing the viral RNA was extracted from
infected cell culture supernatant or directly from the

fact, the re-emergent DENV-1 was more closely related to
strains isolated in Singapore in 1990 and in 2005, suggesting a probable Asian origin. However, one strain isolated
in 2010 (15/BR/MS/2010) from a RJ resident who traveled
to Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Midwest region and one
strain recently isolated in 2011 in RJ (0122/BR/RJ/2011)
grouped together forming another distinct clade (lineage
III), grouping with strains isolated in 2007 and 2008 in
Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico, suggesting a Latin
American origin for those strains (Figure 1C).
In spite of the continuous low circulation in the country, the low percentage of identity of the newly isolated
viruses with those strains first introduced in the 80’s
suggest that the re-emergent DENV-1 did not evolved
locally but occurred probably due to new lineages introductions in the country (Table 1). The analysis based on
the E gene sequences from DENV-1 strains isolated in
the Northern region of Brazil from 2000 to 2008 available on GenBank support the idea that those viruses
could have been introduced earlier and their low or
silent circulation could be due to the prevalent DENV3/DENV-2 circulation during that time (unpublished
data). The circulation of more than one DENV-1 “lineage” has been described in Asia [6] and in the Americas
[7]. A previous study by Carrillo-Valenzo [11] recently
reported multiple viral lineages introductions for each
DENV serotype in Mexico with frequent lineage replacements. In fact, lineage replacements appear to be a more
common observation than long term lineage persistence
[12].
Lineage replacement occurs when an entire clade of
viruses that has persisted in a particular locality for a
period of time is not evident on a subsequent sampling,
indicating that it has dropped dramatically in frequency,
even experiencing extinction, and sometimes replaced
by a new clade of viruses [13]. Despite this, the evolutionary processes controlling these events are not fully
understood. Recently, it has been suggested that despite

patients serum using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions and
stored at -70°C for DENV typing and sequencing.
The sequencing reaction was performed by reverse
transcription using 5 μL of extracted RNA in 25 μL of
AccessQuick™ RT-PCR System (Promega Corporation)
and specific oligonucleotides primers which sequences
can be provided upon request, to amplify the C/prM/M/
E region of 2,325 bp. Amplification was conducted
using a Model 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified from using QIAquick
Gel extraction Kit or QIAquick PCR purification Kit
(Qiagen) and used as template for cycle sequencing.
Sequencing reactions were performed as recommended
in the BigDye Dideoxy Terminator sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems) and the products were analyzed
using an automated 3130 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences for the complete E gene (1,485
nucleotides) were deposited in GenBank (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
The sequences multiple alignment was performed
using CLUSTAL W (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) and
the phylogenetic analysis by MEGA 4 software (http://
www.megasoftware.net), using the “Neighbor-joining”
method, according to the Tamura-Nei model, with a
bootstrap of 1,000 replications. Strains representative
from the five genotypes available in Genbank (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were used for the comparison,
DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 strains were used as
outgroup to root the trees.
The results based on the analysis of the E gene
sequences have demonstrated that the DENV-1 strains
isolated during 2009/2010 in RJ and one isolated in the
State of Espirito Santo (ES) used for comparison purposes,
still belong to genotype V (America/Africa) previously
detected in the country, but grouping into a distinct clade
(lineage II) of that represented by earlier Brazilian DENV1 strains (lineage I) with a strong bootstrap support. In

the endemicity of a particular serotype in a specific geographic region for a long period, different viral clades
may be involved in that period [14]. It is known that the
introduction of new DENV serotypes/genotypes/lineages
is a major risk factor for dengue epidemics. In 2009/
2010, 1,471,390 dengue fever (DF) suspected cases and
665 deaths were reported in Brazil, with DENV-1 causing epidemics in most states [4,15]
It is not clear whether the explosive epidemic reported
in Brazil during 2009 and 2010 caused mainly by
DENV-1 was due to this lineage replacement. The
population susceptibility to this serotype which has not
circulated for almost a decade and the occurrence of
secondary infections in a hyperendemic country may
also have played an important role in the disease epidemiology,. In this scenario, the monitoring of DENV is of
great relevance to observe the spread of potentially virulent strains as well to evaluate its impact over the population during an outbreak.
Due to the Brazil’s geography and dengue epidemiology, along with the fact the country has important tourist regions, a larger sampling analysis is suggested to
better characterize those replacement events and lineage
introductions in the country.
