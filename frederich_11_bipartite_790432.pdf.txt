Bipartite life cycle of coral reef fishes promotes
increasing shape disparity of the head skeleton
during ontogeny: an example from damselfishes
(Pomacentridae)
Bruno Frédérich* and Pierre Vandewalle

Abstract
Background: Quantitative studies of the variation of disparity during ontogeny exhibited by the radiation of coral
reef fishes are lacking. Such studies dealing with the variation of disparity, i.e. the diversity of organic form, over
ontogeny could be a first step in detecting evolutionary mechanisms in these fishes. The damselfishes
(Pomacentridae) have a bipartite life-cycle, as do the majority of demersal coral reef fishes. During their pelagic
dispersion phase, all larvae feed on planktonic prey. On the other hand, juveniles and adults associated with the
coral reef environment show a higher diversity of diets. Using geometric morphometrics, we study the ontogenetic
dynamic of shape disparity of different head skeletal units (neurocranium, suspensorium and opercle, mandible and
premaxilla) in this fish family. We expected that larvae of different species might be relatively similar in shapes.
Alternatively, specialization may become notable even in the juvenile and adult phase.
Results: The disparity levels increase significantly throughout ontogeny for each skeletal unit. At settlement, all
larval shapes are already species-specific. Damselfishes show high levels of ontogenetic allometry during their postsettlement growth. The divergence of allometric patterns largely explains the changes in patterns and levels of
shape disparity over ontogeny. The rate of shape change and the length of ontogenetic trajectories seem to be
less variable among species. We also show that the high levels of shape disparity at the adult stage are correlated
to a higher level of ecological and functional diversity in this stage.
Conclusion: Diversification throughout ontogeny of damselfishes results from the interaction among several
developmental novelties enhancing disparity. The bipartite life-cycle of damselfishes exemplifies a case where the
variation of environmental factors, i.e. the transition from the more homogeneous oceanic environment to the
coral reef offering a wide range of feeding habits, promotes increasing shape disparity of the head skeleton over
the ontogeny of fishes.

Background
A primary aim of evolutionary biology is to explain the origin, structure and temporal patterns of phenotypic diversity. Many studies have proposed adaptive explanation for
phenotypic variation and have focused on the role of selection in shaping patterns of diversification. Divergent selection is expected to enhance adaptive differences through
time (evolutionary and ontogenetic scales). Selection may

occur at any life stage and be specific to one life stage, leading to the potential for stage-specific adaptation [1].
Despite its obvious importance, very little is known about
the role of ontogeny in adaptive divergence and rigorous
studies focusing on the variation of phenotypic diversity
over ontogeny in various zoological groups are needed.
Coral reef fishes represent one of the most diverse
assemblages of vertebrates, and moreover studies dealing
with their morphological diversity are numerous [2-10].
These studies have mainly focused on the adult stages and
fewer have addressed ecomorphological variation through
the ontogeny of reef fishes [e.g. [11,12]]. The majority of

coral reef fishes have a complex life-cycle with two distinct
phases: (1) a dispersive pelagic larval phase and (2) a
sedentary demersal adult phase associated with the coral
reef environment. The larval phase ends at reef settlement
[13]. In contrast to reefs, the open water environment is
thought be more homogenous, especially with regard to
the diversity of habitats. Conversely, intrinsic factors of the
coral reefs such as high productivity, high spatial and ecological complexity, and high trophic diversity may be
involved in promoting the high standing levels of fish
diversity [14]. It is thus surprising that quantitative studies
on the ontogeny of the radiation of coral reef fishes are
lacking. Such studies dealing with the variation of disparity, i.e. the diversity of organic form [15], over the ontogeny could be a first step in detection of evolutionary
mechanisms of diversification in these fishes. By studying
their ontogeny, via changes in shape with size (i.e. allometry), it is possible to gain a clearer understanding of the
timing of selective pressures in coral reef fishes [1].
To our knowledge, very little quantitative data exists on
adaptive allometry and on the ontogeny of shape diversification within zoological groups in general and fish
clades especially [but see [1,16,17]]. Zelditch et al. [18]
have focused on the dynamic of body shape disparity
over ontogeny in piranhas and highlighted that the disparity decreases significantly and substantially over ontogeny within this particular clade. Adams and Nistri [19]
investigated ontogenetic trajectories of foot morphology
in eight species of European plethodontid cave salamander and showed the disparity of adult foot morphology
was significantly lower than in juveniles. Two broad categories of factors have been suggested for explaining these
ontogenetic patterns of disparity [20]: the external or
“ecological” constraints such as the availability of ecological space [21,22], and the internal constraints such as
developmental, genetic or functional constraints
[18,23,24]. New studies in various taxa selected according
to their life-cycle and their ecological diversity are
needed. They should give further insights into the roles
of external and internal constraints shaping the levels
and patterns of disparity over ontogeny.
Including more than 300 species living in coral reef
environments, the damselfishes (Pomacentridae) represent one of the most successful radiations of coral reef
fishes [3,14,25,26]. Similar to the great majority of coral
reef fishes, they have a bipartite life-cycle. In the pelagic
environment, all damselfishes larvae feed on planktonic
copepods [27]. At the adult stage, three trophic guilds are
commonly recognized [25,28]: the pelagic feeders sucking
planktonic copepods; the benthic feeders grazing filamentous algae or biting coral polyps; and an intermediate
group feeding on planktonic prey, small benthic invertebrates and algae in variable proportions. Consequently,
we can consider that damselfishes have a higher trophic

diversity at their adult stage, and thus we can expect that
functional demands lead to an increase in morphological
disparity over ontogeny. Indeed, while all species might
be expected to be adapted to catch small planktonic prey
during the pelagic larval phase, adult damselfishes would
be expected to have specific morphological adaptations
allowing optimal prey catching and processing. For
example, planktivorous and algivorous species have muscles and skeletal shapes optimizing suction feeding and
grazing, respectively [3,4,29].
The evolution of damselfishes exemplifies a case of
reticulate adaptive radiation [3] in which morphological
divergence at speciation has been associated with the
repeated convergence on a limited number of ecotypes:
algivory, omnivory and planktivory. Among the Pomacentridae, algivory and omnivory have both arisen seven
times, planktivory four times, and feeding on scleractinian coral polyps twice [3,25,26].
The study of ontogenetic allometry can reveal differences in developmental patterns among species underlying
their morphological differentiation. How differences in
developmental patterns generate species divergence has
been successfully addressed in many groups, including trilobites [e.g. [30]], fishes [e.g. [17]], newts [e.g. [31]], reptiles
[e.g. [32]], rodents [e.g. [33]], primates [e.g. [34]] and
humans [e.g. [35]]. The pattern of ontogenetic shape
changes can be described by the allometric trajectory of an
organism plus the rate at which it proceeds along the trajectory [36]. Morphological divergence among taxa sharing
a common allometric trajectory could be due to changes
in the rate or the duration of development (i.e. rate and
event heterochrony [37]). Divergence could result from
the directional change in the allometric trajectories (i.e.
allometric repatterning [37]), coupled or not to alterations
in the rate and/or the timing of development. In the present study, we explore whether and how differences in
allometric trajectories can shape the ontogenetic dynamic
of morphological disparity in damselfishes.
We used geometric morphometrics to examine the
patterns of morphological diversification among damselfishes throughout their ontogeny. Four functional units
of the head skeleton were separately studied: the neurocranium, the unit «suspensorium and opercle», the
mandible and the premaxilla. All these skeletal units are
movable elements involved in prey catching [38]. The
aims of the present study were to: (1) test the hypothesis
that larval morphologies are more similar (less disparate) than the morphologies of juveniles and adults, (2)
compare the patterns of shape disparity, i.e. the distribution of shapes and the dimensions along which shapes
are most disparate, at different ontogenetic stages, (3)
compare ontogenetic trajectories to identify the evolutionary changes in developmental parameters (i.e. allometric patterns, rate of shape changes, amount of shape

changes undergone over the course of ontogeny) shaping the level and the pattern of morphological disparity,
and (4) explore the relationships between the developmental parameters, phylogenetic data and ecological
data.

Methods
Sample and data collection

Our study species belong to 6 of the most specious genera of Pomacentridae [25], the phylogenetic relationships
of which are illustrated on Figure 1. They represent
every trophic group known at the adult stage [25,28]:
zooplanktivorous species (Abudefduf sexfasciatus, Chromis sp and Dascyllus trimaculatus), algivorous species
(Stegastes nigricans, Chrysiptera brownriggii and Chrysiptera glauca) and species belonging to the intermediate group (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus pavo).
Within the intermediate group, D. aruanus is a mainly
carnivorous species feeding on planktonic and benthic
copepods [39] when P. pavo feeds on zooplankton and
filamentous algae [25]. A total number of 406 specimens
of damselfishes were analyzed (Table 1). The sample of
each species represents a complete ontogenetic series
from larval (i.e. larvae settling reef) to adult specimens.
The samples of two Chromis species, Chromis viridis (n
= 15) and Chromis atripectoralis (n = 21), were pooled
to build a single ontogeny referred as Chromis sp in this
study. These two very close species are named the blue
green damselfishes, differing only by the coloration of
the pectoral fin base [40]. All juvenile and adult specimens were collected by the authors in the lagoon or on
the outer reef slope at Toliara (Mozambique Channel,

Madagascar) in June 2004, October 2006 and November
2007; at Moorea Island (Society Archipelago, French
Polynesia) in June 2007; and at Rangiroa atoll (Tuamotu
Archipelago, French Polynesia) in July 2007 after being
anaesthetized by a solution of quinaldine. All larvae
were collected by the authors at Moorea Island and
Rangiroa atoll. Larvae were caught during settlement
events with a crest net (1.5 m wide × 0.75 m height ×
5 m length, 1 mm mesh net) fixed to the substratum
similar to one used by [41]. At Moorea Island, crest nets
were placed on the reef crest. At Rangiroa atoll, the
crest net was positioned in a hoa or channel through
which water entered the lagoon. Fish larvae captured in
crest nets during the night were collected at dawn.
Fishes were preserved in neutralised and buffered 10%
formalin for ten days and then transferred to 70% alcohol. All specimens were cleared and stained with alizarin
red S [42] in order to display the osseous skeleton.
One of us (B.F.) dissected fish heads and collected
two-dimensional anatomical landmarks (LMs) on lateral
views of the neurocranium, the unit «suspensorium and
opercle», the mandible and the premaxilla using a Leica
M10 binocular microscope coupled to a camera lucida.
Lucida images drawn on sheets were then scanned and
the x, y coordinates of LMs were digitized using TpsDig
(version 1.40). The configuration of LMs of each skeletal
unit used for the analysis is shown on Figure 2. Sixteen
homologous LMs were defined on the neurocranium, 12
on the unit «suspensorium and opercle», 12 on the
mandible and 6 on the premaxilla, forming four separate
data sets. Landmarks are described in [4] despite the
fact that the number of LMs used for defining the unit
«suspensorium and opercle» is lower than in our previous study of adult damselfishes [4] because some LMs
could not be easily and precisely discriminated in larvae.
The size of samples differed slightly between structures
because some units were damaged before or during the
dissection (Table 1).

Geometric morphometrics

We used Procrustes-based geometric morphometrics to
study shape variation and dynamics of shape disparity
throughout ontogeny [43-46]. For each skeletal unit, the
digitized landmark configurations were subjected to a
Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) in order to
remove non-shape variation (location, orientation and
scale) [47,48]. The “grand mean”, i.e. the consensus
shape of all specimens and shape variables were then
generated as partial warp scores (PWs) including both
uniform and non-uniform components [44,49]. The centroid size (CS) of the structure was also computed as
the square root of the sum of the squares of the distances from all LMs to their centroid [44]. Allometry
refers to the pattern of covariation between measures of

size and shape [36]. Age information is not available for
our specimens, so we use size as ontogenetic scale (i.e.
ontogenetic allometry).
1. Comparing models of ontogenetic allometries

The allometric patterns of shape variation were analyzed
using linear multivariate regression of PWs on log-transformed size (ln-CS) [48,50-52]. The null hypothesis that
shape develops isometrically was tested in all species
using TpsRegr (Version 1.34). The fit of the regression
models was evaluated by the explained variance of the
model and by a permutation test based on a Generalized
Goodall’s F-Test with 10,000 permutations.
Differences in allometric models among species were
tested by a MANCOVA, testing the null hypothesis of

homogeneity of linear allometric models. In these tests,
shape variables (PWs) are considered as dependent variables, size (ln-CS) as covariate and species is grouping
factor. As suggested by Zelditch et al. [53] and Webster
and Zelditch [37], two factors can explain differences in
allometric models: (a) the divergence of allometric trajectories and (b) the rate of shape changes. Consequently, we estimated and compared both factors plus
two other parameters: shape at settlement (i.e. the starting point of the ontogenetic trajectories) and the length
of the ontogenetic trajectory, which is a function of the
rate and duration of development. As these parameters
are estimated by linear multivariate regressions, they
assume a linear relationship between shape and ln-CS.

Plots of Procrustes distance from the mean larval shape
(see below), and the variance explained by the models
are used to assess the validity of log-linear models
(Goodall’s F-test). This is reasonable for our data
because the regression of shape on ln-CS explains a
large proportion (up to 88%) of shape variance for each
structure in every species (see Additional File 1).
1.a. Comparing larval shapes at settlement (starting point
of ontogenetic trajectories)

The samples of settling larvae are limited (≤ 10 specimens). Consequently, we used a standardized regression
residual analysis to estimate and compare larval shapes
at settlement [18,54,55]. From the multivariate regression of shape on ln-CS, the non-allometric residual fraction is standardized by Standard6 (IMP-software).
«Standardized» data sets of larvae with their respective
SL (see SLsettlement in Table 1), which are the predicted
shapes of the entire population at these sizes, are generated. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) were
performed using partial warp scores, followed by a posteriori tests of pairwise comparisons to test shape differences among species. The statistical significance of the
pairwise differences was tested by a resampling-based Ftest and the results of CVA assignment tests were also
examined. MANOVAs were performed using Statistica
8.1 (Statsoft 2007). Pairwise F-tests were done in
TwoGroup6 (IMP-software) and misclassification rates
were given by CVAGen (IMP-software).
1.b. Comparing ontogenetic trajectories in shape space

The differences in trajectories of shape changes were
analyzed by comparing the angle between the speciesspecific multivariate regression vectors using VecCompare6 (IMP-software). This test is described in detail in
[48,53] and was already exemplified in a previous study
of allometry in damselfishes [50]. Here, a within-species
vector is composed of all regression coefficients of the
shape variables (PWs) on the log-transformed CS. The
range of angles between such vectors within each species is calculated using a bootstrapping procedure (N =
400). This range was then compared with the angle
between the vectors of both species. If the between-species angle exceeds the 95% range of the bootstrapped
within-species angles, the between-species angle is considered significantly different, and thus the allometric
trajectories are different. Angles were computed pairwise
between allometric vectors, and the resulting interspecific dissimilarity relationships (angles) between the allometric trajectories were summarized with scatter plots
calculated using nonmetric multidimensional scaling
(NMDS). Differences between a reference shape (i.e. larval shape at settlement) and a target shape (i.e. adult
shape) can be illustrated with deformation grids (interpolating function “thin plate spline” or TPS [44]). Multivariate regression models of shape on size for each unit

Page 5 of 21

were used to show graphical illustrations of ontogenetic
allometries in each species. Deformation grids illustrating these ontogenetic allometries were obtained from
TpsRegr (Version 1.34).
1.c. Comparing rates of shape changes during ontogeny

The dynamics of shape change (developmental rate),
defined as the rate of shape changes per unit of size in
this study, was estimated for each species using the Procrustes distance (PD), the metric defining shape dissimilarity in the Kendall shape space [45]. PD between each
specimen and the average larvae were regressed on lnCS in all species separately. The rate of divergence away
from the average larval shape was compared among species using the slope of the regressions with Regress6
(IMP-software) ([for detailed explanations on this methodology, see [48,56]). Because the relationships between
PD and ln-CS are close to linear (see Additional File 2),
these can be statistically compared by ANCOVA.
1.d. Comparing lengths of ontogenetic trajectories

The length of the ontogenetic trajectories is used to
compare the net amount of shape change undergone
over post-settlement ontogeny in the eight species.
These lengths were calculated as the PD between the
average larval shape at settlement and at the maximum
adult body size. Confidence intervals are placed on these
lengths by a bootstrapping procedure detailed in [18].
Because our analyses are based on size-standardized
data, so the bootstrapping procedure also takes the
uncertainties of the regression into account. The calculations were done using DisparityBox (IMP-software).
We focused on the relationships between the studied
developmental parameters, phylogenetic data and the
diet of each species. Moreover, correlation analyses
(Pearson r) were used to test the relationships between
some developmental parameters, i.e. the dynamic of
shape changes or the length of ontogenetic trajectories,
and other species-specific characters, i.e. the pelagic larval duration (PLD) and the size variation undergone
during post-settlement growth.
2. Measuring and analyzing shape disparity

We used the same methodology as [18] to measure
morphological disparity (MD) at three ontogenetic
stages: (1) at the mean size observed at settlement
(Table 1), (2) at a common size of 60 mm SL for every
species and (3) at the species-specific maximum adult
body size (MAX SL). The intermediate size (60 mm
SL; at such a size, some species are already adults and
others are always at the juvenile stage) was arbitrarily
chosen to estimate the MD when fishes are already
settled on coral reef and when size difference among
species are eliminated. For these analyses, we used
“standardized” data sets, which are the predicted
shapes of the entire population (see Table 1) at these
stages.

Frédérich and Vandewalle BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:82
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/82

MD was calculated with the following equation:
d2 /(N − 1)
j

MD =
i

where dj = PD between the mean shape of species j
and the grand mean shape (i.e. consensus shape). N =
total number of species. The level of disparity among
the eight studied species was calculated for each skeletal
unit (i.e. disparity at the family level). Then, we calculated the disparity level at the three studied ontogenetic
stages within each trophic group. As only two species of
the intermediate group were studied (i.e. D. aruanus
and P. pavo), we could not calculate the disparity level
of this trophic group. Consequently, both species were
related to the two other trophic groups. As P. pavo
commonly grazes algae, it was grouped with algivorous
species. Conversely, D. aruanus was groupd with the
zooplanktivrous species. All the calculations were done
by DisparityBox (IMP-software), which also uses a bootstrapping procedure to place confidence intervals on
this measure. We refer to [18,48] for a detailed explanation of this methodology.
In addition to measuring the level of shape disparity,
we also examined its pattern of variation, i.e. the distribution of shapes and the dimensions along which shapes
are most disparate. This exploration is informative about
the dynamic nature of disparity. For example, larvae and
adults can have the same level of disparity but they can
occupy two different sub-spaces (hyperplanes, i.e. “flat”
surfaces of more than two dimensions embedded in
higher dimensional space) of the shape space. Biologically, this would mean that the patterns of variation
have been re-organized or re-structured to lie along very
different pathways. The structures of disparity in different ontogenetic stages can be compared by comparing
variance-covariance matrices. First, visual exploration of
shape variations in the sub-space defined by the first
two relative warps (Relative Warps analysis is equivalent
to a Principal Components Analysis [PCA] of shape
variables when the scaling factor a = 0, [49]) allow to
check if the three ontogenetic stages (i.e. settling larvae,
60 mm SL, MAX SL) share the same hyperplane. Then,
we used the program SpaceAngle (IMP-software) to
compute the angle between hyperplanes and determine
if the between-ontogenetic stages angle is no larger than
the within-ontogenetic stages range. This program
allows to specifically test if every ontogenetic stage
occupied the same subspaces of the morphospace.
SpaceAngle (IMP-software) used a method developed by
[57] based on PCA. See [48] for detailed explanations
on this approach but the angle between two subspaces
embedded in a common higher dimensional space can
be defined as the angle through which one subspace

Page 6 of 21

must be rotated to match the other. If the angle
between two subspaces (i.e. between-ontogenetic stages
angle) does not significantly differ from zero, we may
not reject the null hypothesis (H0) in which specimens
of two ontogenetic stages occupy the same subspace.
The significance of the angle was determined by a bootstrapping procedure (N = 400) similar to that applied
for comparisons of allometric vectors (see above). Relative warps analyses of standardized shape data at the
three ontogenetic stages were performed using PCAGen
(IMP-software) and the angles between subspaces
defined by the first two PCs were calculated by SpaceAngle (IMP-software).
Geometric morphometric analyses were performed
using computer programs from the TPS series (TpsDig
and TpsRegr), written by F.J. Rohlf (freely available at:
http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/) and the IMP series
(CVAGen, DisparityBox, PCAGen, Regress6, Standard6,
TwoGroup6, VecCompare, SpaceAngle), created by H.D.
Sheets (freely available at: http://www2.canisius.edu/
~sheets/morphsoft.html). TPS deformation grids were
generated in the program MORPHEUS (Slice, 1999;
http://www.morphometrics.org/morpheus.html. STATISTICA, version 8.1 (Statsoft 2005) was used for other
statistical analyses (i.e., MANCOVA and MANOVA)
and NMDS plots were generated using Matlab (The
MathWorks 2007).

Results
Comparing ontogenetic allometries

The post-settlement ontogeny of the cephalic region is
highly allometric in damselfishes. Shape variation in
each skeletal unit is significantly correlated with logtransformed size (ln-CS) (all p levels of the Generalized
Goodall’s F test < 0.05, see Additional File 1) and a
large proportion (up to 88%) of variation in total shape
change during damselfish post-settlement development
is explained by ontogenetic allometries.
The eight damselfishes show highly different allometric models. Indeed, interspecific differences in allometric models were highly significant for each structure
(MANCOVA, Table 2). MANOVA revealed significant
differences among species at the settlement stage (for

each skeletal unit, p < 0.0001). All pairwise comparisons
revealed statistically significant differences in larval
shapes (F-tests, p < 0.0015); thus all species differ significantly from each even after Bonferroni adjustments for
26 comparisons. Moreover, the CVA assignment rates
were high for each structure (from 91 to 98% depending
to the skeletal unit).
The differences in the allometric models of damselfish
species could also be attributed to their different rates
in shape changes, or to their allometric patterns (i.e. the
direction in which the ontogenetic trajectories point in

unit (Table 3). Although belonging to the same genus,
each angle between C. glauca and C. brownriggii was
low but significantly different from zero (Table 3). On
the other hand, the angle between D. aruanus and
D. trimaculatus was not significantly different from zero
for the neurocranium and the mandibule. The angle
between D. aruanus and P. pavo was not significantly
different from zero for the unit «suspensorium and
opercle». Pairwise comparisons of angles between allometric vectors of each skeletal unit were summarized in
the NMDS plots of Figure 3. The plot topology varied
according to each skeletal unit although some constants
were present. Chromis sp. is highly divergent from the
other studied species for the majority of skeletal units,
except for the neurocranium. According to the plot

trajectories for the (A) neurocranium, (B) the «suspensorium and opercle» unit, (C) the mandible and (D) the premaxilla. For each scatter plot,
Kruskal Stress values are below 0.05. Different icons are used to illustrate the diet of each species: white square, zooplanktivorous; black square,

topology, a parallelism between the allometric patterns
and the diet is present for the neurocranium, the mandible and the premaxilla (Figure 3A, C, D). Indeed, the
first axis allowed good discrimination between mainly
planktivorous and mainly algivorous species for the neurocranium and the mandible (Figure 3A, C). Concerning
the premaxilla (Figure 3D), mainly algivorous species
shared similar trajectories showing the highest values
along axis 2 although Chromis sp seemed to be an
exception. Finally, all large species (i.e. A. sexfasciatus,
D. trimaculatus, S. nigricans; Table 1) showed similar
allometric patterns for the unit «suspensorium and
opercle».
Using deformation grids, differences in allometric patterns among species are often visually striking (see
Additional File 3). However, at large-scale, some ontogenetic shape changes are common to all species. Adults
had shorter and higher neurocranium than larvae while
these differences are limited in the two Chrysiptera species and P. pavo. In all other species, the heightening is

mainly explained by the growth of the supraoccipital
crest (LMs 5-7). Adults showed higher opercle and suspensorium than larvae. The suspensorium of adults is
always shorter in its central part. Indeed, the distance
between the articulation of the palatin (LM 2) and the
two articulations of the hyomandibular (LMs 4, 5) is
always shorter in adults. All larvae had a maxillary process of the palatin (LMs 1, 2) rostro-dorsally directed
and an articulation quadrate-mandible (LM 8) behind a
hypothetical vertical bar passing through the articulation
of the palatin. The mandible of all larvae is less high
showing a shorter symphisis mandibulae than the adult
one. Except in Chromis sp., adults showed a shorter
dentigerous process of the premaxilla (LMs 1, 6) than
larvae. The ascending process of the premaxilla (LMs 1,
2) is always longer in adults.
For each skeletal unit, the dynamic of shape changes
(Procrustes distance Vs ln-CS) significantly differs
among species (ANCOVA, Table 4). Figure 4 displays
all rates of shape changes for each skeletal unit. Pairwise

although Chromis sp. and S. nigricans had the slowest
rates, and D. trimaculatus and P. pavo the highest ones.
The highest interspecific differences of developmental
rates were observed for the mandible and the premaxilla
in which Chromis sp had the significant lowest rate of
shape changes for both units. The two Chrysiptera species had the highest developmental rates for the premaxilla. The rate of development of these two species
was three times higher than the rate of Chromis sp. Dascyllus aruanus and P. pavo shared a lower developmental rate than both Chrysiptera but a higher one than A.
sexfasciatus, S. nigricans and D. trimaculatus. For the
mandible, A. sexfasciatus had a rate of shape change
higher than Chromis sp but lower than the developmental rates of the other species. In conclusion, the

among species and there was little evidence of a

hypothetical relationship between the rate of shape
changes and the diet of the species (Figure 4). For the
neurocranium, the unit «suspensorium and opercle»,
the mandible and the premaxilla, all studied species can
be subdivided in 2, 3, 3 and 4 groups, respectively. No
correlation existed between the rate of development of a
skeletal unit and the pelagic larval duration (PLD) of the
species (0.52 < p < 0.95 according to the skeletal unit),
nor between the developmental rate and the size variation undergone during the post-settlement growth of
the species (0.12 < p < 0.83 according to the skeletal
unit).
The length of ontogenetic trajectories differs among
damselfishes for each skeletal unit (Figure 5). These
lengths, expressed in Procrustes distance, are directly
proportional to the amount of shape changes undergone
by every species during growth. For the neurocranium,
A. sexfasciatus showed the longest ontogenetic trajectory

According to the confidence limits (95% CI) obtained by
the bootstrapping procedure, Chromis sp, D. aruanus, P.
pavo and S. nigricans could be differentiated statistically
from each other in pairwise comparisons, but they cannot be subdivided into mutually exclusive subsets by
length. So we regard them as having the same length.
Dascyllus trimaculatus had an intermediate length of
ontogenetic trajectory between these four species and
A. sexfasciatus. For the unit «suspensorium and opercle», the lengths of the ontogenetic trajectory of A. sexfasciatus and D. trimaculatus were significantly longer
than the other species. On the other hand, Chromis sp,
the two Chrysiptera species and S. nigricans underwent
the lowest amount of shape changes during growth. The
length of the ontogenetic trajectory of Chromis sp was
almost twice as short as the other seven studied species.

length. Chromis sp had the shortest length of ontogenetic trajectory for the mandible. For both mouthparts,
all other species did not show significant differences in
the length of ontogenetic trajectories. In conclusion,
these comparisons suggest that the length of ontogenetic
trajectory is a moderately variable developmental trait.
Indeed, all studied species can be subdivided into 4, 3, 2
and 1 group(s) for the neurocranium, the unit «suspensorium and opercle», the mandible and the premaxilla,
respectively. The amount of shape changes undergone
by each species is not correlated to the size variation
observed during the post-settlement growth, except for
the neurocranium (neurocranium r = 0.84, p < 0.01; suspensorium and opercle r = 0.66, p = 0.07; mandible r =
0.25, p = 0.55; premaxilla r = -0.16, p = 0.70). No correlation existed between the length of ontogenetic trajectory and the mean PLD of species (0.26 < p < 0.83
according to the skeletal units).

Comparing levels and patterns of shape disparity at three
ontogenetic stages

The shape disparity among species significantly increased
over ontogeny for each skeletal unit (Figure 6A). The
neurocranium and the mandible showed the most spectacular variation. Indeed, the neurocranium and the mandible shapes were respectively five and four times more
disparate at the adult stage (MAX SL) than at the larval
stage (settlement). The increase of shape disparity is the
lowest for the unit «suspensorium and opercle». Calculation of the levels of shape disparity at an intermediate
size, common for each studied species, revealed differences in the ontogenetic dynamic of disparity among
structures. The level of shape disparity for the neurocranium in fishes sizing 60 mm SL accounts for 64% of the
level of disparity at the MAX SL while, at the same intermediate size, the disparity of the premaxilla is 88% of the
maximal disparity. The two other skeletal units show
intermediate values: the disparity level of the unit «suspensorium and opercle» and the mandible at 60 mm SL
is 76% and 78% of the maximal disparity, respectively.
The shape disparity significantly increased over ontogeny within both main trophic groups (i.e. mainly zooplanktivorous and mainly algivorous species, Figure 6BC). Within each trophic group, the increasing of disparity is most important for the neurocranium, the mandible and the premaxilla. Conversely to zooplanktivorous
species, the group of mainly algivorous species did not
show significant variation of shape disparity of the unit
«suspensorium and opercle» over ontogeny.

limits are obtained by bootstrapping procedure (N = 400).

Frédérich and Vandewalle BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:82
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/82

The patterns of shape disparity also varied throughout
ontogeny. The distribution of shapes in the plane
defined by the first two relative warps shows that larvae
and adults do not occupy the same sub-space of shape
spaces (Figures 7,8,9,10), indicating a redistribution of
variance over ontogeny.
At settlement, the first two relative warps RW1 and
RW2 explain 54.7% of the total shape variance of the
neurocranium (Figure 7). Having the lowest scores on
the RW1 axis, the two Dascyllus species showed a
higher neurocranium than the others. The second component (RW2), explaining 11% of the shape variance,
highlights small differences in the shape of the supraoccipital crest and in the relative length of the orbital and
the post-orbital regions. The variance explained by RW1
and RW2 is higher at the size of 60 mm SL and at the
maximum adult body size (~72% of total shape variance)
(Figure 7). Three groups can be easily distinguished
along the RW1 axis at 60 mm, a first including the two
Chrysiptera species and P. pavo, a second grouping A.
sexfasciatus, Chromis sp and S. nigricans, and a third
including the two Dascyllus species. Pomacentrus pavo
and both Chrysiptera have a proportionally longer neurocranium. Abudefduf sexfasciatus and Chromis sp show
a larger supraoccipital crest than the other species of
the second group (RW2). At the maximum size, S. nigricans shares a more similar shape to the two Dascyllus
species allowing the clear distinction of three groups in
the shape space defined by RW1 and RW2. The two
Chrysiptera species, P. pavo and S. nigricans, have a
shorter and ventrally directed vomer (low RW1 and
RW2 scores, see LMs 1-2).
The shape variance of the unit «suspensorium and
opercle» is relatively low at the settlement stage (Figure
8). The two Dascyllus species have the lowest RW1
values and P. pavo the highest. Both Dascyllus species
show the narrowest opercle and the highest unit «suspensorium and opercle». The second component (RW2)
opposes S. nigricans, which shows a horizontal maxillary
process of the palatin, to A. sexfasciatus and Chromis
sp., in which this process is rostro-dorsally oriented. At
60 mm, the first component (RW1) directly opposes the
two Dascyllus species to the two Chrysiptera species
and P. pavo; A. sexfasciatus and S. nigricans occupy an
intermediate position (Figure 8). The second component
(RW2) allows the discrimination of Chromis sp. having
a lower suspensorium and a maxillary process rostrodorsally oriented. At the maximum size, S. nigricans has
a ventrally bent maxillary process of the palatin (-RW2)
(Figure 8).
At the settlement stage, the first two components
explain nearly equal amounts of variance of mandible
shape (RW1 = 39% and RW2 = 30%) (Figure 9). Only
Chromis sp. and S. nigricans show distinct shapes from

Page 12 of 21

the other species. Chromis sp. has the highest RW1
scores, revealing a lower mandible with a short retroarticular. Stegastes nigricans differs from the others along
RW2, showing a shorter angular in its ventral part. At
60 mm and maximum body size, the first two relative
warps seem to express almost the same percentage of
total shape variance and the same pattern of shape variation (Figure 9). For both stages, RW1 (~ 50% of the
total shape variance) mainly differentiates species
according to the height of the mandible and the length
of the symphisis mandibulae, distinguishing A. sexfasciatus and Chromis sp. from the other species. The second
relative warp (24% of the shape variance) distinguishes
the three herbivorous species (the two Chrysisptera and
S. nigricans) from P. pavo and the two Dascyllus by
their massive mandible (Figure 9).
The dynamic of the pattern of premaxilla shape disparity seems similar to that of the mandible (Figure 10).
At settlement stage, Chromis sp. shows a highly divergent shape along RW1 revealing a thin dentigerous process and an obtuse angle between the ascending and the
dentigerous processes. The second relative warp distinguishes A. sexfasciatus and S. nigricans from the two
Chrysiptera, the two Dascyllus species and P. pavo.
Indeed, the first ones have a shorter dentigerous process
and a longer ascending process than the others. The
pattern of shape disparity is the same for the intermediate and the adult stages (Figure 10). Chromis sp. is
highly divergent from all other species along RW1; and
A. sexfasciatus and the two Chrysiptera species are distinguished from the two Dascyllus species, S. nigricans
and P. pavo along RW2.
The calculation of the angles among sub-spaces
defined by the first two relative warps corroborates the
previous visual explorations (Table 5): larvae and adults
occupy different sub-spaces of morphospaces. For the
neurocranium, the angle between the sub-spaces of the
settlement stage and the maximum adult body size is
86° and thus largely higher than the ranges of the
within-hyperplane angles (64° for the settlement stage
and 14° for the maximum size). Consequently, these
hyperplanes are significantly distinct from each other in
the total shape space, revealing that the pattern of shape
disparity of larvae at settlement differs from that of
adults. The same conclusions can be drawn for (1) all
comparisons between the hyperplanes of settlement
stage and maximum adult size and for (2) all comparisons between the hyperplanes of settlement stage and
intermediate stage (60 mm) for each skeletal unit (Table
5). On the other hand, the results differ for the comparisons between the hyperplanes of 60 mm stage and maximum size stage according to the skeletal unit,
highlighting differences in the dynamics of the patterns
of shape disparity. For the neurocranium and the unit

Comparing hyperplanes of skeletal shape variation between the three studied ontogenetic stages (larvae at settlement, 60 mm SL and maximum SL). Results are
obtained by bootstrapping procedure (N = 400) using SpaceAngle. Angles are in decimal degrees. The angle between hyperplanes is considered significant (S) if
it exceeds the bootstrapped within-group variance at 95% confidence.

Eight specific allometric patterns exist for the premaxilla
and 7 for the other units (Table 6). In the shape space,
every species has its own ontogenetic trajectory. Only
the allometric vectors of the neurocranium and the
mandible in D. aruanus and D. trimaculatus point in
the same direction (Table 3). Both species are dissimilar
at each stage (i.e. larvae and adult) but have parallel
ontogenetic trajectories in the size-shape space, illustrating a case of lateral transposition where dissociation had
occurred in an earlier period of reef settlement. The
conservation of the same allometric pattern in these two
closely related species belonging to the same genus may
be explained by genetic similarities. More surprisingly,
the allometric patterns of the unit «suspensorium and
opercle» in D. aruanus and P. pavo reveal a third case
of parallel trajectories. All others show a total divergence of allometric trajectories (i.e. allometric repatterning). Generally speaking, the range of the divergence of
allometric patterns (9.9°-53.6°, Table 3) is similar to the
results obtained from other geometric morphometric
studies of different structures of the head skeleton in
vertebrates [31,33,35,59,60], except for the premaxilla
which is highly divergent (18.7°-101.3°). The angles
among the ontogenetic trajectories seem to be fairly
related to the diet (Figure 3). On the other hand, the
incongruence between allometric trajectories and phylogeny (Figures 1 & 3) may be linked to the reticulate

«suspensorium and opercle», the analyses show that the
shapes at 60 mm and at the maximum adult body size
occupy different sub-spaces. Conversely, the angle
between these hyperplanes is not significant for the
mandible and the premaxilla (Table 5); thus the patterns
of shape disparity are similar at these two ontogenetic
stages for both skeletal units.

Discussion
The level and the pattern of head skeleton shape disparity significantly vary throughout the post-settlement
ontogeny of damselfishes. The disparity level increases
over ontogeny both at the family level and within each
trophic group (Figure 6). Adults are more disparate in
shapes and occupy different sub-spaces of the total
shape spaces than settling larvae, implying reorganization of variance with growth. Although larval shapes are
more similar, they are already species-specific at the
time of the coral reef settlement probably due to differences in the larval growth and/or the pelagic larval
duration (Table 1). Indeed, all species do not have the
same age when they settle on the coral reef [58].
According to the study of developmental parameters,
the increasing disparity seems to be mainly due to the
divergence of allometric patterns. This parameter is
clearly not constrained: nearly every species has their
own allometric pattern for each skeletal unit (Table 3).

The figures represent the diversity of studied allometric parameters (i.e. larval shapes, allometric trajectories, rates of shape changes and lengths of allometric
trajectory) among damselfishes. As eight damselfish species were studied, 8 is a maximum stating that each species has a specific developmental parameter.

Frédérich and Vandewalle BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:82
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/82

adaptive radiation (i.e. evolutionary patterns characterized by rapid and repeated shifts between a limited
number of ecomorphological states) of damselfishes suggested by Cooper and Westneat [3]. Indeed, our data
probably illustrate successive allometric repatternings
allowing ecomorphological shifts during the evolution of
Pomacentridae. This result implied that the ontogenetic
trajectories of the damselfish species are evolutionarily
labile. The evolutionary changes seen in ontogenetic trajectories across the phylogeny may reflect the complex
interplay between developmental processes and selective
pressure that are more intense at various developmental
stages (e.g. reef settlement stage and/or adult stage)
[19]. The variability of the angles within the same genus
(e.g. Chrysiptera and Dascyllus) remains limited in spite
of some differences according to the species and the
skeletal units. In the two Chrysiptera species, the divergence of allometric trajectories is low for every studied
structure. On the other hand, the two Dascyllus species
show two identical allometric patterns. Likewise the
phylogenetic proximity of the genera Pomacentrus and
Chrysiptera suggested by molecular data (Figure 1) is
confirmed by the similarity of allometric trajectories.
Finally, a functional demand related to the head size
could explain the similarity of allometric patterns for
the unit «suspensorium and opercle» among the large
species: D. trimaculatus, A. sexfasciatus and S. nigricans
(Figure 3).
The length of ontogenetic trajectory and the rate of
shape change appear to be conservative developmental
parameters. Depending on the skeletal unit studied, 1 to 4
values have been highlighted for 8 species (Table 6). Thus
some species share the same length of ontogenetic trajectory or the same dynamics of shape change. However the
variation of both parameters could be underestimated by
our methodology. Indeed, having no age information on
the studied specimens, compensatory changes in growth
rate (defined as the relationships between age and size)
could not be explored. These two developmental parameters are not correlated to the duration of the larval
phase or the size variation of post-settlement ontogeny.
The reasons for such a low variability of these parameters
are not obvious. During settlement, the great majority of
damselfishes directly recruit to the adult populations and
thus directly use the same habitat of their congeners
[61,62] unlike other taxa which undergone one or some
habitat changes before their recruitment (e.g. Labridae,
Acanthuridae, Serranidae). Among the studied species,
only A. sexfasciatus deviates from this general trend: the
juveniles settle in micro-atolls of the fringing reef and
adults live on the barrier reef [61]. This consistent behavior pattern observed in pomacentrids could partially
explain the low inter-specific variability of the rate of
development. Both parameters are not related to diet and

Page 18 of 21

phylogeny. Intuitively, we hypothesized that planktivorous
species at the adult stage, thus having no ontogenetic
change of diet, undergo lower amount of shape changes
than herbivorous species but that is not verified. The ontogenetic shape changes that are related to a shift of feeding
strategies [38,50] and other functional demands might also
explain shape changes related to respiration [63] or sound
production [64].
Allometry is an important factor in modeling of the
head shape during the post-settlement growth of damselfishes. Our results reveal a higher degree of similarity at
reef settlement, followed by a significant spreading of
species within morphospace over ontogeny. Different factors could explain a closer similarity among settling larvae than among adults, including the internal (e.g.
functional and developmental) and external (e.g. ecological) constraints. The latter might seem predominant.
Indeed, as all larvae live in the pelagic zone of the ocean
[13], the shape similarity seems to be linked to a common
environment and very similar diets, exclusively composed
of copepod nauplii and adults [27]. On the other hand,
the lagoon and the barrier reef offer a multitude of
resources and feeding habits. Three major modes of feeding have been identified in Teleost fishes: sucking, biting
and ram feeding (for a review see [38]). These three
modes may be predicted from the functional design of
the damselfish head [3,4] although they possess skulls of
intermediate design that will also allow some opportunism in their diet [28,65]. The allometric patterns
detailed in the present study strengthen previous data
revealing an improvement of suction feeding system during damselfish ontogeny [50]. The main allometric shape
changes include: a heightening of the suspensorium and
the opercle, an elevation of the supraoccipital crest, a forward displacement of the mandibular articulation with
respect to the neurocranium, a mandible becoming proportionally shorter and a lengthening of the ascending
process of the premaxilla. Figure 8 summarizes the variation of trophic diversity and morphological disparity
throughout ontogeny of damselfishes, highlighted during
the present study and others [4,28,29,50,66,67]. As
demonstrated in other Teleosts such as Labridae [68,69]
and Centrarchidae [70], morphological (shape) diversity
may not always be an accurate predictor of biomechanical diversity. An overview of our previous studies dealing
with feeding habits [28] and trophic morphology
[4,66,67] in adult damselfishes shows that the higher
level of shape disparity corresponds to a higher level of
ecological and functional diversity in comparison to the
larval stage. Nevertheless, future studies will have to specifically test the relationship between the morphological
(shape) disparity and the mechanical disparity in damselfishes, as done by Hulsey and Wainwright [71] in labrids.
Although larval shapes are already species-specific, some

Frédérich and Vandewalle BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:82
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/82

Page 19 of 21

similarities suggest that settling larvae can be considered
as ram-suction feeders (see discussion in [50]). Adult
damselfishes show either a short neurocranium type (S.
nigricans, A. sexfasciatus, Chromis sp, both Dascyllus
species) or a more lengthened type (both Chrysiptera
species, P. pavo). The main character allowing the differentiation of grazing species is the presence of a ventrally
bent vomerian region (Figure 11). The other skeletal
shapes literally vary between the two main functional
constraints: suction feeding and grazing/biting (Figure
11). The pelagic feeders (A. sexfasciatus and D. trimaculatus) and the benthic feeders (both Chrysiptera species
and S. nigricans) show skeletal shapes optimizing suction
feeding (e.g. high suspensoria and opercles, short mandible) and grazing (e.g. robust mandible, short and massive
dentigerous process of the premaxilla, ventrally bent
maxillary process of the palatin, broad hyomandibular
allowing a large place for the muscle adductor mandibulae) respectively [3,4]. Species belonging to the intermediate group such as P. pavo have intermediate skeletal
shapes or their head is a mix of skeletal units typical of
suction feeding or grazing species. Among the pelagic

feeders, Chromis sp (i.e. Chromis viridis and C. atripectoralis, see Materials & Methods) showed some striking
divergences (Figures 3, 7,8,9,10). The shapes and the
short lengths of ontogenetic trajectories (Figure 4) are
suggestive of functional similarity with larvae. Furthermore our morphological and developmental data corroborate kinematic studies [72] showing that Chromis
viridis use ram-suction feeding to capture highly evasive
prey such as copepods. In summary, one main morphofunctional group can be recognized at the pelagic larval
stage and three at the demersal adult stage (Figure 11).

Conclusion
The present study describes qualitatively and quantitatively the diversification of the head skeleton during the
post-settlement growth of damselfishes. The morphological disparity of the head skeleton is higher at the adult
stage associated with the coral reef environment in comparison with the settling larval stage. At reef settlement,
larval shapes are already species-specific probably due to
differences in age. The process of diversification throughout the ontogeny of damselfishes is mainly explained by

the divergence of allometric trajectories in shape space.
The length of ontogenetic trajectory and the rate of
development seem to be more constrained developmental parameters. The bipartite life-cycle of damselfishes
exemplifies a case where the environment (i.e. the coral
reef) promotes the increasing shape disparity of the head
skeleton over ontogeny. Linked to different developmental parameters, we show adult head morphology diverged
on various phenotypes across species, suggesting that
functional demands for varied feeding strategy are more
intense in adults than in larvae. Our study demonstrates
that both selection and developmental processes have
influenced phenotypic evolution in this fish group.
