Evolution of trappin genes in mammals
Akira Kato1*, Alejandro P Rooney2, Yutaka Furutani1,3, Shigehisa Hirose1

Abstract
Background: Trappin is a multifunctional host-defense peptide that has antiproteolytic, antiinflammatory, and
antimicrobial activities. The numbers and compositions of trappin paralogs vary among mammalian species: human
and sheep have a single trappin-2 gene; mouse and rat have no trappin gene; pig and cow have multiple trappin
genes; and guinea pig has a trappin gene and two other derivativegenes. Independent duplications of trappin
genes in pig and cow were observed recently after the species were separated. To determine whether these
trappin gene duplications are restricted only to certain mammalian lineages, we analyzed recently-developed
genome databases for the presence of duplicate trappin genes.
Results: The database analyses revealed that: 1) duplicated trappin multigenes were found recently in the ninebanded armadillo; 2) duplicated two trappin genes had been found in the Afrotherian species (elephant, tenrec,
and hyrax) since ancient days; 3) a single trappin-2 gene was found in various eutherians species; and 4) no typical
trappin gene has been found in chicken, zebra finch, and opossum. Bayesian analysis estimated the date of the
duplication of trappin genes in the Afrotheria, guinea pig, armadillo, cow, and pig to be 244, 35, 11, 13, and 3
million-years ago, respectively. The coding regions of trappin multigenes of almadillo, bovine, and pig evolved
much faster than the noncoding exons, introns, and the flanking regions, showing that these genes have
undergone accelerated evolution, and positive Darwinian selection was observed in pig-specific trappin paralogs.
Conclusion: These results suggest that trappin is an eutherian-specific molecule and eutherian genomes have the
potential to form trappin multigenes.

Background
Trappins are a family of small secretory proteins that
possess an N-terminal transglutaminase-substrate (TGS)
domain and a C-terminal whey acidic protein (WAP)
domain [1]. The TGS domain consists of repeats of six
semi-conserved amino acids, KGQDPV, that act as
anchoring regions. In this case, the lysine or glutamine
residues of these regions are cross-linked with extracellular-matrix proteins by the action of transglutaminases,
which helps trappin molecules to become concentrated
at the site of action [2-4]. In contrast, the WAP domain
is a four-disulfide core region and is defined by eight
conserved cysteine residues. The WAP domain of trappin shows anti-proteolytic [4-6] and antimicrobial [7-9]
activities that allow it to act as an innate immune
defense molecule. In fact, trappin-2 displays antibacterial
activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [7-9]; it also has antifungal activity [9], and the

antimicrobial activity is independent of its antiprotease
function [9]. The most well characterized trappin is
human trappin-2, which is also known as elafin, skinderived antileukoproteinase (SKALP), elastase-specific
inhibitor (ESI), or protease inhibitor 3 (PI3) [1,10]. It
has strong inhibitory activity against leukocyte and pancreatic elastases and proteinase 3 [4-6], and shows antiinflammatory activity [11] as well. The antiproteolytic
and antimicrobial activities of trappin-2 are quite similar
to those of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI)
[12,13], which consists of two WAP domains with the
second WAP domain being highly homologous to the
WAP domain of trappin-2. Trappin-2 is expressed in
the trachea, lung, gut, epidermis, esophagus, vagina, and
oral epithelia [2,4]. In these tissues, the expression is
induced by proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a [14,15].
The number of trappin genes varies among mammalian species. For example, humans and sheep have a single trappin-2 gene [16,17], while pigs have at least six:
trappin-1, trappin-2, trappin-3, trappin-7, trappin-8,

and trappin-9 [18,19]. At the other extreme are the
mouse and rat, which lack trappin genes entirely [20],
though the guinea pig has genes for trappin-12 and its
derivatives caltrin II and seminal vesicle secretory protein (SVP), which lack TGS- and WAP-coding regions,
respectively [21,22]. Despite the variance in copy number between the different mammalian lineages, all trappin genes are encoded by three exons. Exon 1 encodes a
signal peptide, exon 2 codes for a TGS- and WAPdomains, and exon 3 encodes a 3’ untranslated region
[18,19,23]. While the exonic organization is highly conserved among various mammalian lineages, there is variation in the number of six-amino-acid repeats in the
TGS domain [18,19]. Due to a point mutation of splicing site, guinea pig trappin-12 exceptionally lacks
intron 2, which is present at the 3’ noncoding region of
the trappin gene [22]. A short interspersed element
(SINE) is found in intron 2 of the trappin genes of the
pig, wart hog, and collared peccary [18,19].
While we have mentioned several species that possess
multiple trappin genes, it is not known if (1) these are
exceptional cases or (2) trappin genes normally exist as
a multigene family. In an attempt to find the answers,
we analyzed genome databases developed by the Mammalian Genome Project http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/ and identified six trappin genes from the ninebanded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) genome. The
nine-banded armadillo belongs to the taxonomic order
Xenarthra. Because this lineage is believed to be one of
the most ancient lineages of placental mammals [24],
the analyses of armadillo trappin genes are quite interesting because the duplication and evolution of armadillo trappin genes are expected to have occurred
independently from other species. In contrast, we identified a single trappin-2 gene from the genome databases
of many species including the chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, bushbaby, dog, cat, horse, cow, European shrew,
European hedgehog, megabat, and microbat. This fact
suggests that trappin-2 is the ancestral form of trappin
genes, and trappin-null species such as mouse and rat
are exceptional. Finally, we identified anciently duplicated trappin-18 gene in Afrotheria such as the elephant
(Loxodonta africana), tenrec (Echinops telfairi), and
hyrax (Procavia capensis), and trappin-related genes in
chicken and opossum, suggesting that the gene family
originated as far back as more than 100 million years
ago.

platypus, birds (chicken and zebra finch), Xenopus, fish
(Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis,
Gasterosteus aculeatus, and Oryzias latipes), sea squirts
(Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi), insects (Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Aedes
aegypti), and Caenorhabditis elegans. Typical trappin
genes were identified only in the mammalian species
(Figure 1C-D). A single homologous gene was identified
in chicken, zebra finch, and opossum, and multiple
homologous genes were identified in platypus, (Figure
1A-B). The other species did not show any homologous
genes to trappins except for other WAP-coding genes
with a low homology (data not shown).
The presence of the SLPI gene was also analyzed using
the genome databases, and a single orthologous gene
was identified in all mammalian species except for the
guinea pig and the rabbit (Figure 1A). In contrast, there
are no clear direct orthologs for the SLPI gene in the
genome databases of chicken, zebra finch, and opossum,
and the trappin-homologous genes are also the most
homologous to SLPI. In platypus, the above-mentioned
trappin-homologous genes encode two-WAP-domain
proteins and may be the paralogs of the mammalian
SLPI gene.
The trappin-related genes in chicken, zebra finch, and
opossum have a single WAP-coding region but lack a
TGS-coding region. Only the WAP-coding region is
similar to trappin and the SLPI genes, but the other
flanking regions lack any significant similarity except for
a weak similarity in the signal-peptide coding regions
(data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of
the WAP domains of the trappin-related genes are
shown in alignment with those of mammalian trappin
and the SLPI genes (Figure 1B). The catalytically important Met residue (an asterisk in Figure 1, A and 1C) is
conserved in the opossum and platypus genes but not in
the chicken and zebra finch genes.
Platypus SLPI genes show a stronger identity with
trappin-2 (67%) than SLPI (55%) in the deduced amino
acid sequences. The phylogenetic analysis for trappin,
mammalian SLPI, platypus SLPI, and trappin-related
genes of chicken and opossum is shown in Figure 2A.
Trappin-related genes of chicken and opossum and platypus SLPI genes are not clearly categorized as trappin
or SLPI.

Results

We analyzed genome databases for various eutherian
mammals including human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, bushbaby, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, cow, European shrew, European hedgehog, microbat, megabat,
nine-banded armadillo, sloth, elephant, hyrax, and tenrec. Only mouse, rat, and rabbit lack trappin genes in

gene was used for the analyses. (B) Phylogeny of trappin genes. Noncoding region of the trappin genes that was used for the analyses. The
phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. The NJ
trees (left) with bootstrap values for both the NJ and MP methods and ML trees (right) are shown. Trappin genes with short nucleotide
sequences were not included in the analyses, because inclusion of short sequences reduces the reliability of the analyses when we removed all
the sites containing missing data and alignment gaps prior to the calculation (called the complete deletion in MEGA software). Bars indicate 10%
replacement per site. Species- or lineage-specific trappin multigenes are shaded in gray.

their genome databases, but the other species have at
least one trappin gene in their genome databases (Figure
3). All the newly identified trappin genes consist of
three exons like previously analyzed trappin genes: exon
1 encodes a signal peptide, exon 2 encodes the TGS and
WAP domains, and exon 3 encodes the 3’ untranslated
region (data not shown). We aligned the amino acid
sequences of the WAP domains of those genes, and
categorized them into two groups: the first group contained the catalytically important Met residue (asterisk
in Figure 1C) and was named trappin-2 (Met rule); and
the second group lacked the Met residue and was
named according to the order of discovery. Most animals have a single trappin-2 gene (Figures 1C and 3).

This finding suggests that the trappin-2 gene is the
ancestral form of the trappin genes. According to this
definition, the previously reported porcine trappin-8
should also be renamed trappin-2b as it also has the
Met residue. Tenrec trappin-18 also has the Met residue
at the catalytic site. However, the phylogenetic analyses
using nucleotide sequences of the noncoding regions
(introns, exon 3 and 5’ and 3’ flanking regions) clarified
that this gene is closely related with trappin-18 genes of
elephant and hyrax. Therefore we call this gene tenrec
trappin-18 as an exception to the Met rule.
The average nonsynonymous and synonymous distances were calculated on 150 bp WAP-coding regions
among the trappin-2 genes of the various species,

Figure 3 History of the evolution of trappin genes in mammals. Phylogeny of mammalian species with the time scale was generated based
on the works by Kumar and Hedges [31], Hasegawa et al. [48], Nishihara et al. [24], Hallstrom and Janke [49], and Arnason et al. [50]. Ranges of
the estimated dates for gene duplications are indicated by open boxes. Bayesian estimations of duplications using the nucleotide and the amino
acid sequences of trappin genes are indicated by arrows and arrow heads, respectively. The dates of duplication estimated by MEGA software
using single reference point are indicated by asterisks. The dates of duplications individually estimated by MEGA software for each species are
indicated by double asterisks. Mya, million years ago.

trappin paralogs except for trappin-2, and all trappin
genes (Table 1). In the WAP-coding region, the rate of
nonsynonymous substitutions is lower than that of
synonymous substitutions among trappin-2. The rates of
nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions are similar in the WAP-coding region among trappin paralogs
except for trappin-2. These results suggest that the purifying selection is operating on the trappin-2 gene in various eutherian mammals.
Identification of novel trappin multigene families in
armadillo and Afrotheria (elephant, tenrec, and hyrax)

Database analyses demonstrated the presence of six
trappin genes in nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), which were named trappin-2 and

trappins-13-17 (Figures, 1 and 3). Afrotherian species
such as the elephant (Loxodonta africana), tenrec (Echinops telfairi), and hyrax (Procavia capensis) had two
trappin genes, which were named trappin-2 and trappin-18 (Figures, 1 and 3). We also found two novel trappin paralogs from the bovine genome database, and
named them trappin-19 and trappin-20 (Figures 1D and
3).
Phylogenetic analyses of the noncoding regions of
trappin genes from several mammalian species are
shown in Figure 2B. All armadillo trappins-13-17 genes
form a single branch with armadillo trappin-2 gene.
Bovine trappin-19 and trappin-20 also share the same
branch with bovine trappin-2. These results suggest that
those genes are recently duplicated species specific

paralogs. On the other hand, Afrotherian trappin-18 is
divided near the root, suggesting that trappin-18 duplicated much earlier.
Estimations of the dates for the duplication of trappin
multigenes

A linearized tree was constructed by using the nucleotide sequences of trappin multigenes and the dates of
the duplications were calculated with MEGA software.
When the divergence time between Primate and Artiodactyla (96.2 Mya) was used as a reference point, the
date of the duplications of trappin genes of pig, cow,
armadillo, guinea pig, and Afrotheria (elephant, hyrax,
and tenrec) were calculated as 7.0, 8.8, 15.9, 79.0, and
161 Mya, respectively (asterisks in Figure 3).
We next calculated the date of duplications individually
for each species using the taxon pair that was most closely related to the node of interest as a reference point.
We found that some of the trappin gene subfamilies were
relatively young. For instance, when the divergence time
between sheep and cow (18.3 Mya) was used as a calibration point, the date of the duplication events giving rise
to the pig and bovine trappin gene families were calculated as 7.8 and 9.7 Mya, respectively. Similarly, when the
divergence time between human and armadillo (96.2
Mya) was used as a reference point, the date of the duplication event giving rise to the armadillo trappin gene
family was calculated as 15.5 Mya. On the other hand,
certain trapping gene subfamilies appear to be more
ancient. For example, when the divergence time between
primate and rodent (61.7 Mya) was used as a reference
point, the date the guinea pig trappin gene subfamily was
estimated to have originated 55.2 Mya, and when the
divergence time between elephant and tenrec (48.6 Mya)
was used as a reference point, the Afrotherian trappin
trappin gene subfamily was calculated to have originated
91.9 Mya (double asterisks in Figure 3).
We also estimated divergence times using the Bayesian method implemented in the BEAST software package [25]. The date of the duplications of trappin genes
of pig, cow, armadillo, guinea pig, and Afrotheria were
calculated as 3.3, 12.6, 11.4, 34.7, and 244 Mya (arrows
in Figure 3), respectively, when the nucleotide sequences
of trappin genes were used for the calculation. When

amino acid sequences were used for the calculation, the
date of the duplications of trappin genes of pig, cow,
armadillo, and Afrotheria were calculated as 49.7, 18.3,
50.9, and 154 Mya (arrowheads in Figure 3), respectively. Thus, the dates calculated for nucleotide and
amino acid sequence data are very different. The former
are similar to the dates generated using the linearized
tree method in pig, cow, and armadillo, and the latter
are similar to the dates generated using the linearized
tree method in Afrotheria. In pig, cow, and armadillo,
the protein-coding regions of trappin multigenes have
evolved rapidly (Table 2), and the dates calculated for
amino acid sequence data showed larger values. In
Afrotheria, since amino acid sequences evolve more
slowly than nucleotide sequences and are, therefore, less
prone to homoplasy over the long evolutionary time
frames being considered, it is reasonable to suspect that
the dates generated using nucleotide sequence data are
not as reliable as those generated from acid sequence
data for this particular study.
Synteny analyses around trappin genes

It has been demonstrated that the trappin-2 is mapped on
the WAP four-disulphide core (WFDC) domain locus
which contains a number of WFDC genes [17]. Moreover,
the conserved synteny of WFDC loci has been studied for
primates, rodents, and the dog [20,26]. To extend these
studies, we analyzed the genes neighboring trappins in
species that were included in our study. Most scaffolds
containing trappin genes were too short to analyze. However, we could analyze genes neighboring to horse trappin-2, megabat trappin-2, bovine trappins, hyrax trappin18 and elephant trappins (Figure 4A). As reported previously for the dog WFDC locus, the horse, megabat, and
bovine trappin genes flanked WFDC5 in opposed directions, whereas WFDC12 and WFDC15 were not found
between WFDC5 and trappin(s). The bovine trappin
genes were tandemly arrayed, suggesting that these genes
arose by tandem gene duplication. In contrast, hyrax and
elephant trappin-18 flanked WFDC5 in the same direction
and was mapped to the same locus as WFDC12. Harr Plot
analyses demonstrated that human WFDC12 is highly
homologous to the 5’-flanking region, exon 1, and intron 1
of hyrax trappin-18 (Figure 4C). Similar homology was
observed between human WFDC12 and elephant trapin18 (Figure 4D).
Recently, Hurle et al. found that primate trappin-2
contains a pseudogene for WFDC12 in intron 1, and
suggested that trappin-2 and WFDC12 have a common

except for Afrotherian trappin-18, which codes for a
WFDC12-like peptide in intron 1 (Figure 4B).

Accelerated evolution of TGS and WAP coding region
trappin multigenes in armadillo, cow, and pig and
positive selection of the WAP-coding region of pig
trappin paralogs

The average distances of the 5’-flanking region, exon 1,
intron 1, exon 2, intron 2, exon 3, and 3’-flanking region
among trappin multigenes for each species were calculated (Table 2, line A1-A7). In armadillo trappins, the
average Jukes-Cantor (JC) distance between the exon 2
regions was 0.235 (Table 2, line A4), which is 4.4 times
higher than that between the non-coding regions (0.054;
Table 2, line B1). When we calculated the average
Tamura-Nei (TN) distances with gamma correction, the
value between exon 2 (0.442; Table 2, line A4) was also
5.6 times higher than that between the non-coding
regions (0.079; Table 2, line B1). Fisher’s exact test
using the numbers of varied sites and common sites
between the exon 2 regions (39 varied sites in 201

common sites) and those between the non coding
regions (87 varied sites in 1691 common sites) demonstrated that the difference is significant (P < 0.01). A
similar difference was not observed in the other regions.
In cow, the average distances between the exon 2
regions were 0.167 (JC method) and 0.299 (NJ method)
(Table 2, line A4), and were 3.1 and 4.3 times, respectively, higher than those between the non-coding
regions (Table 2, line B1; P < 0.01, Fisher’s exact test).
In pig, the average distances between the exon 2 regions
(Table 2, line A4) were 12 and 16 times higher than
those between the non-coding regions when calculated
by the JC and TN methods, respectively (Table 2, line
B1; P < 0.01). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the average distances between the exon 2
regions (Table 2, line A4) and those between the noncoding regions (Table 2, line B1) of elephant, hyrax, and
guinea pig trappin genes. In pig, the average distances

between the exon 1 regions and between the intron 2
regions of different genes (Table 2, lines A2 and A5)
were also higher than those of the non-coding regions
(Table 2, line B1) (P < 0.01).
Next, we calculated distance values for synonymous
substitutions per site (ds) and non-synonymous substitutions per site (dn) for the signal peptide (pre peptide),
TGS, and WAP coding regions (Table 2, line C1-E3),
and compared against the average distance of the noncoding regions. In armadillo, dn of the TGS coding
domain (P < 0.05) and both ds and dn of the WAP coding domain (P < 0.01) were significantly higher than the
average distance of the non-coding regions. In cow, only
dn of the TGS and WAP coding regions were significantly higher than the average distance of the non-coding regions (P < 0.01). In pig, both dn and ds of the
signal peptide, TGS, and WAP coding regions were
higher than the average distance of the non-coding
regions.
To examine the presence of positive Darwinian selection, we compared dn and ds of the rapidly-evolved
coding regions using Fisher’s test. When the average
values in each species were used for the analyses, we
could not detect any statistically significant difference
between dn and ds of all the trappin multigenes. However, the pairwise comparison matrix of dn and ds on
the paralogs of each species demonstrated a dn/ds rate
of 3.3 for porcine trappin-2 vs. trappin-3, 4.9 for porcine trappin-2 vs. trappin-9, and 5.2 for porcine trappin-8 vs. trappin-9 (P < 0.05) (Table 3). Because
trappin-2 is the most conservative gene within the
trappin family and porcine trappin-8 is the closest
homolog of porcine trappin-2, these data indicate the
positive Darwinian selection of porcine trappin-3 and
trappin-9. Although the dn/ds rate between bovine
trappin-5 and other bovine paralogs are as high as 2.85.8, the differences were not statistically significant (P
= 0.07) (Table 3).

different, suggesting that artifacts due to errors or polymorphism are negligible. In the case for armadillo trappin genes, for example, the 129-bp WAP-coding regions
and the ~2.1-kb entire genes may contain less than 0.4
and 6-base sequence errors, respectively. Among armadillo trappin multigenes, the WAP-coding regions and
the ~2.1-kb entire genes have 8-50 and 96-165-base
substitutions, respectively. Thus, the sequencing errors
of genomic sequences with low coverage appear to be
negligible, although the caveat remains that we can not
negate a small number of possible errors.

Discussion
Evaluation of the quality of genomic sequence with low
coverage

The nucleotide substitutions between seven known
cDNAs and corresponding exons in the genome databases were calculated and shown in Table 4. Some of
these substitutions may have occurred as a result of
sequencing errors or site-specific polymorphism within
each species. Yet, we can still infer that the average
rates of sequencing errors are lower than the substitution rates. In low coverage genomic sequences of armadillo, rabbit, cat, and elephant, the average substitution
rates of the seven genes were 0.10-0.49%. In high coverage genomic sequences of cow and human, the average
substitution rates of the seven genes were 0.23 and
0.06%, respectively. These estimates are not substantially

Origin of trappin gene

Computer analyses of genome databases revealed that
typical trappin is a eutherian mammalian specific gene.
The typical trappin genes were found only in eutherian
mammals and not other species including Xenopus, fish,
sea squirt, insects, and C. elegans. The trappin-related
genes were found in chicken and opossum. The computer analyses also showed that most eutherian mammalian species have a single SLPI gene, and platypus has
multiple SLPI genes. The trappin-related genes of those
animals and platypus SLPI genes show strong similarity
with trappin in the WAP domain only, but all the other
regions have no significant homology. Therefore, these
genes may relate with the ancestoral WAP domain of
trappin. Interestingly, platypus SLPI showed higher

homology to the WAP domain of trappin-2 than that of
mammalian SLPI. This strongly suggests that the WAP
domain of trappin and SLPI share a common ancestor.
Trappin is a protein that consists of TGS and WAP
domains. SLPI is a two WAP-domain protein. The second WAP domain of SLPI and the WAP domain of
trappin-2 are quite similar in their amino acid sequences
and functions such as antiproteolytic and antimicrobial
activities, suggesting an ancestral relationship. However,
except for the WAP-coding regions, there is no significant homology in the nucleotide sequences between
trappin and SLPI. Interestingly, trappin genes are
known to have weak but significant similarity with other
TGS genes in introns, TGS-coding, and noncoding
regions (Figure 5) [27]. This mosaic pattern of homology
in trappin genes indicates that trappin genes originated
from the TGS gene and obtained a WAP domain possibly by exon-shuffling. Afrotherian trappin-18 codes for
a WFDC12-like peptide in intron 1 region, and the
other trappins contain a pseudogene for WFDC12 in
intron 1. These results support the hypothesis of Hurle
et al. [26] that trappin and WFDC12 are derived from a
common ancestral gene which codes for both trappin
and WFDC12.
Evolution of trappin genes in eutherian mammals

Nineteen species of eutherian mammals were analyzed
by a search for the presence of trappin genes within
their genome databases, and the results were combined
with those of previous experimental analyses of human
[17,23], pig [18,19], wart hog [19], collared peccary [19],
cow [28], sheep [16], and guinea pig [21,22]. In total, we
could compare the trappin genes from 24 eutherian
mammals (Figure 3). Within the 24 species analyzed, we
could isolate trappin genes from 21 species. A single
trappin-2 gene was found in 11 species, and multiple
trappin genes were found in 8 species. These results

indicate that trappin-2 is the most common and is an
ancestral form while the other trappins are specie-specific paralogs. We could not find trappin genes in three
mammalian species: mouse, rat, and rabbit. Our experimental analyses (data not shown) and the integrity of
the genome databases of mouse and rat suggest that
mouse and rat lack trappin genes in their genome [20].
In mouse and rat, other WAP-motif containing proteins
such as SLPI and SWAMs may compensate the function

of trappin. In the case of rabbit, it is not certain whether
rabbit really lacks trappin genes or rabbit has a trappin
gene that has not yet been analyzed by the genome
project.
By computer analyses of genome databases, we found
that the nine-banded armadillo as well as pig and cow
also have recently-duplicated trappin multigene. The
computer analyses of bovine genome databases also
revealed two novel trappin paralogs and the sequences
of the introns and flanking regions, which enabled the
detailed evolutional analyses of bovine trappin multigenes. As previously reported porcine trappin multigenes, the WAP-coding regions of the trappin
multigenes of armadillo and cow were shown to have
evolved under accelerated evolution. Only dn was accelerated in the WAP coding regions of bovine trappins,
and both dn and ds of the WAP coding regions were
accelerated in armadillo and porcine trappins. The
accelerated substitutions of non-synonymous sites of
WAP-coding regions may be explained by positive Darwinian selection or relaxation of functional constraints,
because we observed statistically significant positive
selection of the WAP coding regions of porcine trappin3 and trappin-9 but no significant difference between
dn and ds of other trappins (Table 3). However, the
question why synonymous substitutions are also accelerated can not be interpreted simply by the existence of
positive Darwinian selection or relaxation of functional
constraint. The mechanism whereby the synonymous
substitutions are accelerated must be clarified by future
studies.
The molecular clock and Bayesian analyses using the
nucleotide sequences estimated the date of duplication
as 11.4-15.9, 8.8-12.6, and 3.3-7.8 Mya for trappin multigenes of armadillo, cow, and pig, respectively. These
results are consistent with previous experimental analyses demonstrating that the collared peccary that was
separated from porcine 33 Mya [29,30], and sheep,
which was separated from bovine 19.6 Mya [31], do not
have trappin multigenes [16,19]. The findings of
recently-duplicated accelerated-evolved trappin multigenes in three individual species demonstrate that mammalian genomes have the potential to form trappin
multigenes in several million years. The selective pressure that formed the trappin multigenes may relate with
some pathogens, and the variety of amino-acid
sequences in the WAP-domain may contribute to the
acquisition of antimicrobial activities for a large spectrum of pathogens. Tissue distribution of trappin paralogs in pig and cow has been shown to vary among
genes: porcine trappin-2 is expressed in the trachea and
the large intestine, porcine trappin-1 in the small intestine, bovine trappin-2 in the epidermis and the tongue,
bovine trappin-4 in the trachea and the tongue, and

Page 11 of 14

bovine trappin-5 in the trachea [28]. Therefore, the
selective pressures might also affect the regulation of
the tissue-specific expression of trappin genes.
Our previous analyses revealed that guinea pig has a
trappin-12 gene [22] and two derivative genes, SVP [32]
and caltrin II [19]. SVP and caltrin II genes have significant homology with trappin including introns, noncoding region of exons, and flanking regions, but lack WAP
and TGS domains, respectively. The molecular clock
analysis estimated the date of the duplication of the guinea pig genes as 34.7-79.0 Mya. This date of duplication
is much earlier than those of pig, cow, and armadillo.
In Afrotherians we found two trappin genes, trappin-2
and trappin-18, whose date of duplication was estimated
as 91.9-244 Mya. This date is surprising, because it is
earlier than the date of the periods of divergence of the
major orders of eutherian mammals (70-10 Mya)
[24,31], and suggests that the duplication of trappin-18
occurred in the ancestors of the eutherian mammals
before the divergence of the species. In this context,
most species lack trappin-18, however, only Afrotheria
has retained the gene. The reason is still unknown, but
it is conceivable that trappin-18 increases resistance to
Afrotheria-specific pathogen. Another possible alternative explanation is that trappin-18 underwent substitutions at a faster rate per year than other trappin genes
and that lead to the duplication time being
overestimated.

Conclusions
• Typical trappin genes are only found in the genome
sequences of eutherians but not in those of other vertebrate species.
• Trappin-2 is the most widely distributed and is the
strongest candidate of the ancestral forms of trappin.
Recently-duplicated species-specific trappin paralogs are
present in the genomes of armadillo, pig, and cow, and
the non-synonymous sites of those genes have undergone accelerated evolution as a result of positive Darwinian selection or relaxation of functional constraint.
• Synonymous sites of recently-duplicated trappin
paralogs of armadillo and pig have also undergone
accelerated evolution by unknown mechanisms.
• The anciently-duplicated trappin-18 gene is only
retained in afrotherian species and is a fossil molecule
of the trappin gene family.
Methods
Isolation of trappin genes from various animal species

The genome database of various species (URL: http://
www.ensembl.org/index.html) [33] were screened using
the amino-acid sequence of human trappin-2. The
exon-intron organization was estimated by comparing it
with that of the human trappin-2 gene. The nucleotide

Kato et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:31
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/31

sequences of the trappin genes were deposited in the
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank DNA databases as third party
annotations (TPAs) under accession numbers BR000322
to BR000327 and BR000708 to BR000720.
Evaluation of the quality of genomic sequence with low
coverage

To evaluate the quality of genomic sequences with low
coverage, we compared known cDNA sequences with
those of corresponding exons in the genome databases.
We used cDNA sequences for SDHA, MDH2, ATP5B,
GAPDH, SDHB, CS, and IDH1 which was determined
by Kullberg et al. [34]. The corresponding exons of
armadillo (2 × coverage), rabbit (2 ×), cat (1.87 ×), elephant (2 ×), cow (7 ×), and human (Genome Reference
Consortium GRCh37 assembly) were isolated and the
numbers of nucleotide substitutions between the
sequences of cDNA and the genome databases were calculated for each species using MEGA software [35]. The
sequences used for the analysis are shown in Supplemental Table S1 (see Additional file 1).
Phylogenetic analyses

Nucleotide sequences of the WAP-coding regions of
trappin, SLPI, and trappin-related genes were used to
analyze their phylogenetical relationship. The introns,
exon 3 (noncoding exon), and 3’-noncoding regions
were used to analyze recent evolution of trappin genes
in eutherian mammals. The nucleotide sequences were
aligned using ClustalW software [36], and the best fit/
gap placement was confirmed manually. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed by the neighbor-joining (NJ)
method [37,38] and maximum parsimony (MP) method
[38] with 2,000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA software [35] or the maximum likelihood (ML) method
with 200 bootstrap replicates using PHYML [39] plugin

Molecular clock analysis and Bayesian divergence time
estimation

The introns, exon 3 (noncoding exon), and 5’- and 3’noncoding regions of pig, cow, armadillo, guinea pig,
and Afrotheria (elephant and hyrax) trappins were
aligned, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the
NJ method. A linearized tree was constructed and the
dates of the duplication events of trappin genes were
calculated by MEGA 3.1 using the divergence time
between Primate and Artiodactyla (96.2 Mya) [40] as a
calibration point for dating.
As an additional method to investigate divergence
times, we used the Bayesian method implemented in the
software package BEAST 1.4.8 [25]. To generate divergence times, the following nine fossil calibration points
were taken from the work by Benton and Donoghue
[40] and implemented as priors in the analysis of both
DNA sequence and amino acid sequence data: (1)

Kato et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:31
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/31

human-chimp: 6.5 Mya; (2) human-Macaque: 23.5 ± 0.5
Mya; (3) dog-cat: 43 ± 0.2 Mya; (4) cow-sheep: 18.3 ±
0.1 Mya; (5) cow-dog 96.2 ± 0.9 Mya; (6) human-cow:
96.2 ± 0.9 Mya; (7) human-armadillo: 96.2 ± 0.9 Mya;
(8) tenrec-elephant: 48.6 ± 0.2 Mya; (9) human-opossum: 124.6 ± 0.1 Mya. The chains were run until convergence was reached (i.e., until the effective sample size
for each parameter exceeded 200), which was 93 million
states for the DNA sequence data and 10 million states
for the amino acid sequence data. The HKY + gamma
model was used for the analysis of the DNA sequence
data, and the WAG model was used for the analysis of
the amino acid sequence data. For both sequence data
types, the birth-death speciation process was used as a
tree prior.
Calculation of nucleotide substitution rates

Nucleotide sequences were separated into the following
regions: the 5’-flanking region, exon 1, intron 1, exon 2,
the WAP-coding region of exon 2, intron 2, exon 3, and
the 3’-flanking region. These regions were aligned separately using ClustalW software. Jukes-Cantor (JC) distances [41] and Tamura-Nei (TN) distances [42] were
calculated using MEGA software [35]. For the calculation of TN distances, we estimated the gamma shape
parameter using MrBayes [43] plugin for Geneious software. Distance values for the synonymous substitutions
per site (ds) and non-synonymous substitutions per site
(dn) of the signal-peptide-coding region of exon 1,
TGS- and WAP-coding regions of exon 2 were calculated using the modified Nei-Gojobori (NG) method
[44]. Standard errors were computed using the bootstrap
method [45] with 2,000 replicates. Fisher’s exact test was
used for the statistical analyses [46].
Synteny and Harr plot analyses

Synteny of neighboring genes of the trappin genes was
investigated by surveying neighboring genes on horse
genome cont2.26764 (AAWR02026765), megabat genome cont1.168530 (ABRP01168531), cow chromosome
13 (DAAA02036736) [47], hyrax genome cont1.336045
(ABRQ01336046), elephant SuperContig scaffold_19,
human chromosome 20, mouse chromosome 2, rat
chromosome 3, and dog chromosome 24. Harr plot analyses were performed at a 23/40 nucleotide stringency
using Genetyx-win software (Genetyx Co., Tokyo).
