Background
Protein structural alignment plays a key role in defining
gold standards for a variety of bioinformatics applications.
These include homology assessment, phylogenetic tree
construction and multiple sequence alignment evaluation.

Our recent findings [1] however showed that superposition
methods are rather sensitive to structural variation. To
sidestep the problem of alignment variability, golden
standards are often derived from the more conserved and
‘trusted’ regions. It therefore remains unclear which

For 1qtq, the flexible alignment regions contain two PKC phosphorylation sites (‘SKR’ and ‘TDK’) in a helix and a
myristoylation site (‘GNKWCI’) in a coil region. (A) The ‘master-slave’ alignments with 1qtn as master, secondary structures

structural elements characterize alignment variability and
what functional information these discarded flexible
regions entail.

Methods
The dataset was taken from Pirovano et al. [1] and consists
of 565 proteins for which in total 2998 alternative crystal
structures with redundant sequences were available.
Structural alignments were made using DALI [2].

Results
In this study we shed more light on the structural features
and functional importance associated with flexible alignment regions. We observe that helices and coils constitute
the main source of alignment variability (around 60% and
30%, respectively), while strands appear to be more robust
(see Figure 1A). Additional alignment inspection shows
that many secondary structure elements are not consistently aligned thus giving rise to mismatches between
secondary structure types. Functional investigation using
Prosite [3] reveals that roughly 20% of all flexible
alignment positions correspond to functional sites (see
Figure 1B), similar to stably aligned regions. Interestingly,
post-translational modification sites are strongly represented and particularly phosphorylation sites are prominent. It is therefore unwarranted to assume that these
flexible regions only play a minor role in protein function.
An example of how the alignment of structural motifs
can be impacted by tiny structural variations is given by
Figure 2, which shows the alignment between a Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase and a Caspase-8.

Conclusion
Our results imply that the current ‘gold’ standard status of
structural alignment should be considered ‘silver’. Particularly our observation that helices are associated with
flexible alignment regions is at odds with currently used
alignment strategies. Moreover, given that functional
importance is spread evenly between stably and flexibly
aligned regions, we conclude that flexible regions cannot
be excluded from analysis of functionality in proteins. In
order to explore new strategies for homology detection,
phylogeny and alignment we propose that, as a first step,
more golden standards be developed that can more
comprehensively represent the structural, functional and
evolutionary signals.
