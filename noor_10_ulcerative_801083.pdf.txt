Abstract
Background: Previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and the development of ulcerative colitis
(UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our aim was to investigate any quantitative differences in faecal bacterial
compositions in UC and IBS patients compared to healthy controls, and to identify individual bacterial species that
contribute to these differences.
Methods: Faecal microbiota of 13 UC patients, 11 IBS patients and 22 healthy volunteers were analysed by PCRDenaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) using universal and Bacteroides specific primers. The data obtained
were normalized using in-house developed statistical method and interrogated by multivariate approaches. The
differentiated bands were excised and identified by sequencing the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes.
Results: Band profiles revealed that number of predominant faecal bacteria were significantly different between
UC, IBS and control group (p < 10-4). By assessing the mean band numbers in UC (37 ± 5) and IBS (39 ± 6),
compared to the controls (45 ± 3), a significant decrease in bacterial species is suggested (p = 0.01). There were
no significant differences between IBS and UC. Biodiversity of the bacterial species was significantly lower in UC
(μ = 2.94, s = 0.29) and IBS patients (μ = 2.90, s = 0.38) than controls (μ = 3.25, s = 0.16; p = 0.01). Moreover,
similarity indices revealed greater biological variability of predominant bacteria in UC and IBS compared to the
controls (median Dice coefficients 76.1% (IQR 70.9 - 83.1), 73.8% (IQR 67.0 - 77.5) and 82.9% (IQR 79.1 - 86.7)
respectively). DNA sequencing of discriminating bands suggest that the presence of Bacteroides vulgatus, B. ovatus,
B. uniformis, and Parabacteroides sp. in healthy volunteers distinguishes them from IBS and UC patients. DGGE
profiles of Bacteroides species revealed a decrease of Bacteroides community in UC relative to IBS and controls.
Conclusion: Molecular profiling of faecal bacteria revealed abnormalities of intestinal microbiota in UC and IBS
patients, while different patterns of Bacteroides species loss in particular, were associated with UC and IBS.

Background
Microbial populations in the gut are known to play an
important role in the health of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract and provide an efficient barrier against
invading gastrointestinal pathogens [1]. Little is known,
however, about the contributions of particular intestinal
species to health and disease. Irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two very different
disorders of the GI tract which share some common

symptoms such as pain and alteration of bowel habits.
The causes of UC and IBS are still not clear, but it is
generally accepted that both are multifactorial in origin,
and that host genetics [2,3], environmental factors [4,5]
and unregulated immune responses [6,7] are involved.
Moreover most studies suggest that the gut microbiota
is an important factor in the pathogenesis of both UC
and IBS.
A number of recent studies confirm the involvement
of gut bacteria in the aetiology of ulcerative colitis. For
example, HLA-B27 transgenic rats used as an animal
model for studying human inflammatory disorders do

not develop inflammation in the small or large bowels
when kept in a germ-free environment [8]. However
when germ-free HLA-B27 rats were reconstituted with
normal luminal bacteria they developed gut inflammation [9]. In humans, infectious diarrhoea caused by Salmonella, Shigella or campylobacter was followed by IBS
in seven to thirty per cent of patients [10,11]. The
instability of intestinal microbiota reported in IBS [12],
combined with the abnormal colonic fermentation [13],
and mitigation of IBS symptoms by controlling small
intestinal bacterial overgrowth by antibiotic therapy
[14,15], suggest that intestinal microbiota may also be
involved in IBS. Consequently, there is growing interest
in treating both IBD and IBS by influencing the composition and activities of the resident microbiota. For
example, a short term intervention with a symbiotic preparation revealed improvement in inflammation indices
in patients with active UC [16], and administration of a
probiotic mixture resulted in improved IBS symptoms
in a six-month controlled intervention study [17].
A number of publications have reported a decrease of
bacteria belonging to the groups Clostridium XIVa and
Clostridium IV in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD),
[18-20]. In another study a reduction of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii an important member of mucosa-associated Firmicutes was found to be associated with the
recurrence of ileal CD [21]. The authors also reported
that a secreted product of F. prausnitzii, had an immunomodulatory activity in vitro, and that oral administration of this bacterial species or its supernatant can
reduce the severity of experimental colitis in mice.
However, a better understanding of which bacteria or
bacterial populations are relevant to UC and IBS is an
important prerequisite if microbial interventions are to
be used in preventing or managing these conditions.
Few studies have investigated faecal microbiota of UC
and IBS patients using quantitative techniques under
comparable conditions. Such studies are technically difficult because more than 1000 bacteria species have
been reported in the human colon to date, and large per
cent of those bacteria remain uncultured [22]. Molecular
techniques overcome these difficulties by allowing complex bacterial communities to be characterised and
quantified. In the present study we have used the culture-independent technique, PCR-denaturing gradient
gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of the V3 region of the
16S rRNA gene, to investigate the gut microbiota of UC
and IBS patients as well as healthy controls. DGGE is a
powerful technique for studying the complex microbial
communities. It has been extensively used in studies of
gut bacteria, including those designed to better understand changes in gut microbiota due to environmental
disturbance [23]. DGGE has advantages over other
molecular approaches in that it is a high throughput,

relatively inexpensive method that allows detailed characterisation of predominant bacteria by cutting the individual bands, re-amplifying and sequencing, without the
need for a cloning procedure. The aim of the present
study was therefore to use this approach combined with
unique in-house developed method for normalisation of
DGGE data to investigate how bacterial populations differed between healthy people and those with UC and
IBS and identify the bacterial species which are responsible for these differences. Our results revealed abnormalities of intestinal microbiota in UC and IBS patients,
but also more interestingly we observed a loss of specific
Bacteroides species.

Methods
Subjects and sample collection

UC and IBS patients were recruited via the Gastroenterology Clinics at the Norfolk and Norwich University
Hospital (Norwich, UK). Healthy controls were recruited
through the Institute of Food Research (IFR) Human
Nutrition Unit (HNU). A total of 13 UC patients (6
males, 7 females), 11 IBS patients (4 males, 7 females)
and 22 controls with no gastrointestinal symptoms (5
males, 17 females), were recruited over a period of 13
months between June 07 - July 08. The median (range)
ages were 45 (23-64) years for UC group, 45 (25-64)
years for the IBS group, and 45 (21-61) years for controls. All patients were anonymous and in remission
when samples were collected. All UC patients had a disease activity score in the moderate to severe range when
recruited. Participants in the study provided written
consent prior to the completion of a health questionnaire. Infectious diseases and structural abnormalities of
the gastrointestinal tract were excluded in all subjects.
Each patient had a diagnosis of IBS (ROME II criteria)
or UC (Mayo Clinic criteria >2) [24] made by their clinician. Volunteers enrolled in the study had not taken
probiotics or prebiotics in any form in the previous two
weeks, and had not received any antibiotics within 4
weeks before providing their samples. Our study was
approved by the Institute of Food Research Human
Research Governance Committee (HRGC), East Norfolk
& Waveney Research Governance Committee and the
Suffolk Research Ethics Committee (Suffolk REC), project ref (06-Q0102-91).
The methods of sample collection and storage were
explained to the participants, and written notes were
given with the stool collection pots, biohazard bags, and
ice cube bags. Volunteers were asked to deliver the samples to the laboratory within 2 h of defecation.
Extraction of total DNA from stool samples

Bacterial DNA was extracted from 0.2 g aliquots of frozen
faecal sample using QIAamp Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, West

Noor et al. BMC Gastroenterology 2010, 10:134
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/10/134

Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The purity and concentration of the extracted DNA were
measured using a spectrophotometer at 260 and 280 nm
(ND, Nanodrop Technology, Wilmington, USA). The
integrity of genomic DNA was also visualized following
electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel.
PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes

DNA isolated from faecal material was used as a template in PCR amplification. PCR was performed using
universal primers, 341GC-f and 534-r which target the
variable V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. PCR was performed as previously described by Muyzer [25]. The
specific primers Bac32GC-f (5’-CGCCCGGGGCG
CGCCCCGGGCGGG GCGGGGGCACGGGGGGAAC
GCTAGCTACAGGCTT-3’) and 303-r (5’-CCAATGT
GGGGGACC-3’) were also used to amplify the V3
region of the bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides
group. The PCR products were checked on 1.5% agarose
gel to confirm that a single band of the expected size
was obtained. PCR products were then purified using
SureClean (Bioline, London, UK) and DNA concentration was again measured by spectrophotometer (ND,
Nanodrop Technology, Wilmington, USA).
DGGE

DGGE was performed using the D-Code system (BioRad Laboratories, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. DGGE with 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 40-58% linear denaturant gradient (100% denaturant
corresponds to 7 M urea and 4% deionised formamide)
was used. Sub-samples (150 ng) of each purified PCR
product were loaded onto the gel in duplicate. Each
sample was run on at least two different gels. Replication was performed so that any faulty or otherwise outlying lanes could be excluded from the subsequent data
analysis, without compromising the total number of
independent samples from which measurements were
available. In addition, a synthetic standard (SS) was
loaded in at least 4 positions onto each gel, in all cases
including the outermost lanes. The SS is a mixture of
different samples designed to produce a profile with a
high number of bands spread across the full length of
gel. The band positions were used as reference points in
the lane alignment procedure outlined below. DGGE
was performed at 60˚C and 50V for 18 hrs in 0.5X TAE
buffer. Gels were stained with SYBR green I (1:20000 in
0.5X TAE) and then visualised using a molecular imager
system (Pharos-FX-plus, BioRad, UK) with external laser
modules (BioRad, UK).
DGGE profile analysis

DGGE images were analysed by TotalLab120 software
for gel images (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK).

Page 3 of 9

This package was used to correct the gel images for
gross distortion, and to export a set of column vectors
representing the greyscale intensity of each lane.
All subsequent data analysis was carried out using
Matlab® version 6.1 installed with the Statistics and
Image Processing toolboxes (The Math Works Inc,
Natick, Massachusetts, USA). Routines for performing
within- and between-gel alignment were developed inhouse, as follows. The positions of the SS band maxima
were identified (by peak-picking) on all gels. To remove
any remaining band curvature resulting from experimental variation, polynomial fitting of the SS band positions within each gel was used to generate a correction
factor for all lanes on that gel. To achieve between-gel
alignment, piecewise linear interpolation was used to
stretch or shrink each block of data bounded by SS
bands, using the global mean of the SS band positions
as the index limits in each case. This procedure is similar to a previously reported method for aligning PCRDGGE gel profiles [26]. However we note that the inclusion of multiple replicate lanes per gel in the present
study substantially eases the task of registration.
After alignment, the data from each sample comprises
a single vector containing 1001 elements. This length
was chosen so that the indices map easily onto a 0 to 1
scale with increments of 0.001, corresponding to the
conventional “RF” scale used in DGGE. Note that the
original images all contained somewhat more than 1000
pixels along each lane. After visual examination of the
full data matrix (viewed as a greyscale image), it was
decided to truncate each lane to 731 elements corresponding to the RF range 0.09 - 0.82. The discarded
regions (from the top and bottom of the gels) were
found to be highly variable. A number of visually poor
quality lanes were also discarded. Finally, data from
each lane were scaled so that all elements were in the
range 0 to 1, to mitigate the effect of between-gel intensity variance.
The resulting [96 × 731] data matrix was processed by
the following multivariate methods: Partial Least
Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was carried
out to compress the raw data to a smaller number of
variables, and to look for evidence of grouping according to disease state ("Y” variable is the class membership). Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) was used to
obtain an optimal 2-dimensional representation of the
group structure [27]. All multivariate modelling was
implemented using leave-sample-out cross-validation
throughout.
Estimates of the numbers of discrete bands in each
lane were made by peak-picking subject to a userdefined threshold. Weighted biodiversity of dominant
microbiota was also calculated according to the Shannon index of diversity which simultaneously takes into

Noor et al. BMC Gastroenterology 2010, 10:134
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/10/134

account both the number of bands and the band intensities [28,29]. Similarity indices were calculated using
the Dice coefficient, with an appropriate tolerance (+/0.008) included on the Rf scale. Where duplicate (or
even triplicate) measurements existed for a given sample, these data were averaged before further statistical
analysis. Where parametric statistical tests are used, data
were assessed in advance for normality and equality of
variance.
Selected bands corresponding to the highest peak
maxima generated by PLS analysis were excised from
the gels, re-amplified, and sequenced using the corresponding V3 region primers. The sequencing reactions
were performed with BigDye v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems,
UK), and checked using DNAStar programme (SeqMan). Resulting DNA sequences were compared with
other 16s rRNA gene sequences in the GenBank database at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

Results
All samples were analysed using DGGE to determine
the biodiversity of gut microbiota of UC and IBS
patients, as well as healthy controls. The PCR product
contained a mixture of gene amplicons of the same size
from different bacterial species that could be separated
according to the sequence differences of the variable V3
region in the 16S rRNA gene. On DGGE, each sample
produced band patterns reflecting the predominant bacterial communities in the samples (Figure 1). Once
DGGE patterns were generated, all subsequent data

were aligned and normalised in Matlab. The effect of
the pre-treatment (alignment and normalisation) is illustrated in Figure 2 using the synthetic standards demonstrating that the method employed allows accurate
alignment of bands both within a single gel but also of
much pronounced variations in band positioning
observed when comparing profiles within different gels.
A number of different analytical techniques were then
applied to interrogate the data. First, the microbial
diversity was estimated by the numbers of bands present
in the DGGE patterns (Figure 1b). Controls showed
higher number of bands (45 ± 3) compared to UC (37 ±
5) and IBS patients (39 ± 6) indicating reduced diversity
of the predominant bacteria in both patient groups.
One-way ANOVA confirmed (p < 10-4) that the groups
do not have the same mean band count. The lower
band counts found in the latter groups indicate the possible absence or reduction in the abundance of specific
bacterial classes amongst their predominant bacteria
compared with healthy controls. The means were compared pairwise using a multiple comparison test. The

control group was found to differ significantly from both
the IBS and UC groups (at the p = 0.01 level, with Bonferroni adjustment). No significant difference was found
between the IBS and UC groups.
Similar findings are obtained from examination of the
Shannon indices, which make use of band intensity as
well as count data. One-way ANOVA again confirmed
(p < 10-3 ) a significant difference between the means,
with multiple comparisons indicating that the mean
Shannon index is significantly (at the p = 0.01 level,
with Bonferroni adjustment) higher in controls (μ =
3.25, s = 0.16) compared with the UC (μ = 2.94, s =
0.29) and IBS (μ = 2.90, s = 0.38) groups.
The pairwise similarity data were assessed using nonparametric, descriptive methods only, since independence and distributional considerations preclude the use
of standard techniques. The controls had a median similarity of 82.9% (IQR 79.1 - 86.7), followed by UC
patients who shared 76.1% (IQR 70.9 - 83.1) of their
predominant faecal bacteria. IBS individuals had median
similarity of only 73.8% (IQR 67.0 - 77.5).
PLS-DA was used to obtain a model for classifying
observations according to the disease state. Note that
the cross-validation implemented was leave-sample-out.
That is, replicate lane data were always grouped
together into the cross-validation segments, to prevent
over-fitting the model. The classification success rate
summarized across cross-validation segments is shown
in Figure 3a as a function of the number of PLS scores
used. The first local maximum in the success rate (of
~64% correct) is obtained from 4 PLS dimensions.
Further inspection showed that the majority of the
incorrect assignments were of the two disease states; in
other words, the model is most able to distinguish

between controls and disease, and less able to separate
the two disease states. A permutation test ("y-scrambling”) was carried out to assess whether this success
rate was likely to be a chance outcome (the range of
classification results obtained under the null hypothesis
are indicated by the bars on Figure 3a, from which we
estimate a p-value of < 10-6. We can conclude that there
is a strong evidence of grouping present in our data. To
obtain a visual illustration of the classification model,
PLS-DA was combined with CVA, since this provides,
by definition, the best 2-dimensional representation of a
3-group structure. In view of the success rate behaviour,
4 PLS dimensions were considered to yield a parsimonious model, and these scores were passed to the CVA
routine (again implemented in full leave-sample-out
cross-validated form). We see (Figure 3b) that both the
UC and IBS groups are readily distinguished from the
controls, supporting the premise that there are systematic differences in the microbial diversity particularly
between healthy and diseased (UC and IBS) volunteers.
The profiles of the IBS patients appear to be somewhat
more dispersed, possibly indicating even greater variation amongst their microbial populations, and consistent
with the band-count findings reported above.
An output of the PLS analysis is a set of “loading vectors”. The magnitudes of the vector elements can be
plotted as series of peaks, the heights of which indicate
the relative contribution of each band to the successive
separations between groups. Inspection of the PLS
scores (for conciseness, not shown) indicated that the
first PLS dimension is primarily responsible for separating the diseased from healthy individuals. Figure 4a
shows the mean of this vector obtained from all training
segments, alongside an image view of the full data

matrix (Figure 4b). Some of the top-ranked features are
peak-picked. The stability of the loading with respect to
the cross-validation is indicated by the solid greyscale
area, which shows the range obtained. The four topranked bands were consistent across all cross-validation
passes, hence these were selected for further experimental investigation, that is, they were excised from the gel
and sequenced. Analysis of the V3 region of the 16S
gene sequences revealed that the excised bands were all
members of the genus Bacteroides and Parabacteroides
(table 1). It is interesting that these bands were more
frequently observed in the healthy controls than in UC
and IBS (Figure 5), apart from one band (Bacteroides
vulgatus) which was found in the UC patients but not
in IBS patients.
In order to further investigate the observed differences
in bacteroides composition, we performed DGGE analysis using only the bacteriodes specific primers. Results
shown in Figure 6 indicate that there were differences in
the diversity of bacteroides species between the healthy
and the patient groups. The mean numbers of bands
detected in each sample were as follows: controls, μ =
14.0 (s = 3.3); IBS, μ = 14.3 (s = 2.9); and UC, μ = 11.9
(s = 2.9). Note, however, that these differences were not
statistically significant, possibly due to the relatively
small numbers of samples involved here. The median
similarities between bacteroides profiles were as follows:
controls, 58.8% (IQR 51.0 - 70.1); IBS, 55.2% (IQR
48.9 - 65.6) and UC, 36.4% (IQ 24.5 - 49.0).

Discussion
Previous studies have suggested that abnormalities of
the colonic microbiota occur in both UC and IBS
[30,31]. However the putative ability of certain bacterial
species to enhance gut health, and the practicality of
intervention strategies such as the use of prebiotics to
achieve this, remains uncertain and poorly understood.
Previous investigations of faecal or of biopsy-associated
bacteria have failed to identify particular pathogens or
bacterial groups linked to the altered microbial composition in UC patients relative to control subjects [30,31].
However the application of molecular profiling techniques allows characterisation of the unculturable bacteria
in the human colon, and in the present study has

enabled us to address this issue in greater detail. Using
this approach we have confirmed the existence of significant abnormalities in the predominant faecal bacteria of
UC and IBS patients in relation to controls, using qualitative and semi-quantitative DGGE analysis, isolation
and identification of the missing phylotypes.
DGGE is a semi-quantitative technique which provides
a snapshot of the predominant bacterial species in a
complex ecosystem such as human colon. Many of the
studies to date have monitored changes in DGGE patterns by comparing the presence and absence of bands,
or changes in the intensity of a single band on the same
gel [32]. Other studies have used pair-wise similarity
coefficients, based on common bands shared between
different samples [33]. The total band numbers in a
given sample, and their intensities, were combined to
assess differences between DGGE profiles [34,35]. However, human colon has a very complex bacterial community, often resulting in large number of bands, and
furthermore the co-migration of the same bands on different gels can often make accurate analysis of DGGE
data difficult [36]. In our study we have applied a careful
alignment method using the synthetic standards to accurately align bands between gels to mitigate experimental
variation. The duplicate runs on different gels have
given us additional confidence in the alignment

procedure. To obtain a semi-quantitative DGGE analysis, the total number of bands and their intensities were
included in our analysis after normalization.
Clinical and experimental observations have suggested
the involvement of intestinal bacteria in the pathophysiology of UC; however the mechanisms by which bacteria or disease-specific pathogen are involved in UC
have yet to be determined [37]. Our data showed significant differences in the predominant faecal bacteria in
UC patients relative to controls, suggesting a loss or
reduction of bacterial classes, leading to the possibility
of phylogenetic changes in these patients. This observation is consistent with other recent studies which
reported a 40% decrease of dominant bacteria in UC
patients [38]. Such a decrease might be a response to
environmental influences such as changes in diet or
drugs or to endogenous signals derived from inflammatory changes or the immune status.
In a previous study, the predominant faecal bacteria
of UC patients under remission were shown to be less
stable than those of healthy controls, and the results
revealed a host-specific pattern in relation to predominant bacteria in UC individual [39]. Studies based on
DGGE have shown small fluctuations of around 20%
in predominant bacteria in healthy controls [40]. Our
results indicated that healthy controls share around
78% of predominant faecal bacteria, suggesting that
this stability is a feature of a healthy gut. In contrast,
UC individuals shared only around 70% of their predominant bacteria, which indicates that a particular shift
of bacterial community might be a feature of UC
patients. IBS patients shared around 68% of gut predominant species, and thus also displayed an even more
diverse bacterial community amongst individuals, compared to controls. This observation indicates that
despite the absence of inflammatory activity, this
patient group is also disposed to changes affecting the
composition of their faecal bacterial community. The
reduced microbial diversity seen here with UC and IBS
patients is, in agreement with the findings of previous
studies. Martinez et al [39] demonstrated reduced bacterial diversity of faecal bacteria from patients with
active UC using a similar approach to that reported
here. Ott et al [28] also reported a reduction in bacterial diversity in tissue biopsies from UC and Crohn’s
disease patients using polymorphism analysis of amplicons of 16S rRNA. Our study has expanded our understanding of this phenomenon by undertaking
qualitative analysis of the missing genera.
The GI microbiota is also thought to play an important role in the development and persistence of IBS;
however, the numbers of detailed studies using cultureindependent profiling methods are limited. Using classical methods, Balsari et al. [41] reported qualitatively

Page 7 of 9

similar faecal bacteria in IBS patients and healthy controls, with some quantitative differences in the predominant bacteria. In contrast, our results show that the
microbiota of IBS patients is quantitatively different
compared to those of UC or the healthy controls, and
that the inter-individual variation in predominant microbiota composition was greatest amongst the IBS
patients. This observation might reflect the fact that IBS
is a poorly defined condition not associated with any
single, well defined biochemical, structural, or serologic
abnormality. Thus although we have based our diagnoses on Rome II (a symptom-based criterion) to identify IBS patients, we are still likely to be sampling IBS
patients from different sub-groups. Typical symptoms of
IBS vary from constipation to diarrhoea, and both may
be present at different times in the same patient. Therefore, it is sensible to assume that differences in intestinal
bacteria within the global IBS group could be associated
with the IBS subgroups. Such an interpretation is consistent with the observations of Malinen et al [30] who
used RT-PCR to analyse faecal bacteria of IBS individuals and reported changes in different bacterial spp.
related to IBS subgroups exhibiting different symptoms.
We did not attempt to differentiate the gut flora in IBS
subgroups since the total numbers of volunteers was
relatively small.
It has been shown by others that 3% of patients with
enteric infections can develop UC [42]. However, this
figure is much lower than the 10% who develop IBS
after infection [43]. Hence, it is interesting to note that
in the present study the predominant faecal bacterial
population from some IBS patients more closely mirrors
those of UC patients, and it would therefore be of interest to assess whether such patients might represent a
post-infection IBS sub-group, and if they are at a higher
risk of developing UC.
The members of the genus Bacteroides are one of the
most frequently represented bacterial species in the
human colon [44]. A few species, such as B. fragilis, are
considered to be human pathogens, but most are
thought to be normal commensal bacteria. In animal
models of IBD, supplementation of the normal intestinal
bacteria with a dose of Bacteroides vulgatus has been
reported to worsen the condition [45,46]. Furthermore,
it has been suggested that Bacteroides is involved in the
reoccurrence of UC after surgery [47], although this
study was small scale and so further evidence is needed.
In the present study, despite the fact that there was no
specific band found to be associated with UC or IBS
patients, we were able to establish that Bacteroides spp.
were most responsible for group discrimination. Surprisingly, and contrary to our expectations, our data
revealed that Bacteroides vulgatus, probably Bacteroides
ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis, and Parabacteroides sp.

were more commonly present at higher levels in healthy
controls than in UC or IBS patients.
In this context it is interesting that an earlier study
demonstrated that B. vulgatus can protect against
E. coli-associated colitis [48]. More recent observations
by Sydora et al. suggested that B. vulgatus plays a role
against the development of colitis [49]. Conte et al
(2006) found that amongst mucosal associated bacteria,
B. vulgatus occurrence was particularly low in patients
with UC, Crohn’s disease or with indeterminate colitis
[50]. A recent report by Takaishi et al (2008) also indicates that that the level of B. ovatus was reduced in UC
patients with active colitis [51]. B. ovatus has also been
reported to protect germ-free and conventional mice,
exposed chronically to dextran-sodium sulphate (DSS),
from bleeding, development of intestinal inflammation
and death [52].

Conclusions
In summary, our findings demonstrate that there are
significant alterations in the composition of gut microbiota in patients with UC and IBS compared to controls.
As has been reported previously, we were able to confirm the reduction of microbial diversity in these patient
groups. The reductions in some species of Bacteroides
and possibly Parabacteroides in both conditions suggest
a possible loss of protective role by this group of bacteria, rather than a specific organism playing a role in
the pathogenesis of UC and IBS. However, an explanation for such a putative protective mechanism is still
unidentified and requires further investigation.
