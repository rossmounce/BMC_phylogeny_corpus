A large scale comparative genomic analysis
reveals insertion sites for newly acquired
genomic islands in bacterial genomes

Abstract
Background: Bacterial virulence enhancement and drug resistance are major threats to public health worldwide.
Interestingly, newly acquired genomic islands (GIs) from horizontal transfer between different bacteria strains were
found in Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus suis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which caused outbreak of epidemic
diseases in recently years.
Results: Using a large-scale comparative genomic analysis of 1088 complete genomes from all available bacteria
(1009) and Archaea (79), we found that newly acquired GIs are often anchored around switch sites of GC-skew
(sGCS). After calculating correlations between relative genomic distances of genomic islands to sGCSs and the
evolutionary distances of the genomic islands themselves, we found that newly acquired genomic islands are
closer to sGCSs than the old ones, indicating that regions around sGCSs are hotspots for genomic island insertion.
Conclusions: Based on our results, we believe that genomic regions near sGCSs are hotspots for horizontal transfer
of genomic islands, which may significantly affect key properties of epidemic disease-causing pathogens, such as
virulence and adaption to new environments.
Keywords: switch sites of GC-skew, genomic island, evolution

Background
DNA strands in most prokaryotic genomes often experience strand-biased spontaneous mutations, especially in
protein coding regions, which occur preferentially in the
leading strand during DNA replication [1,2]. It has been
found that the directions of GC skew often change at
flanking regions around bacterial replication origins
[3-8]. Therefore, strand compositional asymmetry is
commonly used to identify locations of bacterial replication origins [3-7]. To date, strand asymmetry has been
widely studied with GC-skew analysis by calculating [GC]/[G+C] in the chromosome or protein coding regions
[9,10]., Additionally, bacterial genomes share many

other asymmetric features, such as gene density, strand
direction, purine content in genes, and codon usage
[11]. Most interestingly, many bacteria with strong evolution selection pressure display extremely biased GC
skew [12]. Correspondingly, GC-skew analysis is often
utilized as a method for measuring selection pressure of
different genome replication machineries [7,12,13]
While mutations generated during replication are an
important source of bacterial compositional asymmetry,
horizontal acquisition of foreign DNAs, known as genomic islands (GIs), also plays an important role. GIs can
affect compositional bias, by changing the GC content,
introducing new codon usage bias, and altering dinucleotide signature. GIs encode many different functions
and are thought to have played a major role in the
microbial evolution of specific host-recognition, symbiosis, pathogenesis, and virulence [14,15].
In genomes of human pathogens, pathogenicity islands
(PAIs) are the most significant GIs. They often contain
functional genes related to drug resistance, virulence,

and metabolism [16-18]. One such example, Vibrio cholerae pathogenicity island-2 (VPI-2) was found to
encode restriction modification systems (hsdR and
hsdM), genes required for the utilization of amino
sugars (nan-nag region), and a neuraminidase gene
[19,20]. These results suggest that VPI-2 might be an
essential region for pathogen survival in different ecological environments and hence increase virulence [19]. It
is thought that VPI-2 might have been acquired by V.
cholerae from a recent horizontal transfer [19,20]. Similarly, 89K genome island might have been the major factor for Streptococcus suis outbreaks, such as the one in
China in 2005 [21]. Therefore accurate identification of
GI regions is of utmost importance.
sGCS, switch sites of GC-skew, arises when the G/C
bias on the chromosome abruptly changes [22]. Because
GIs come from other bacteria probably with a different
G/C bias, the GIs can introduce new switch sites and
should theoretically be located adjacent to them. However, the relationships between switch sites and GIs
have not been previously investigated on metagenomics
scale. To illustrate the relationship between sGCSs and
GIs, we used V. cholerae, Streptococcus suis and Escheichia coli as an example (Figure 1). In this study, we
focus on the strategies for identifying GIs and switch
sites of GC-skew (sGCS) and propose a new term, putative GI (pGI), to denote abnormal G/C loci as GI insertion hotspots in bacterial genomes. With this new
terminology, we developed a novel comparative genomic
algorithm, based on genomic and evolutionary distance

between pGIs and sGCSs, to identify functional attributes that predict the potential locations for GI insertions. Furthermore, we provided strategies for
identifying new GIs in different groups of bacteria,
which might be potential pathogens for infectious
diseases.

Methods
Complete genomic sequences and their bias features

Complete bacterial genomes and annotation files were
downloaded from the NCBI database ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.
gov/genomes/Bacteria/. The features of the genomes (e.
g., organism names, lineages, chromosome topologies,
dnaA gene locations, GC contents, and GC coordinates)
were used in the comparative genomic analysis. Genome
bias switch signals were detected by signals of the GC
skews along the genomes, calculated by [G - C]/[G + C]
with window sizes of 100-kb and steps of 50-kb. Here,
sGCSs are defined as the sites at the cross point of GC
skew and the average GC content.
GIs and their physical distances

For each genome, we calculated GC content with a window size of 2000-bp and a step size of 1000-bp. In our
analysis, pGIs were usually > 5 kb. As controls, Pathogenity Island (PAI), PAI-like sequences overlapping with GIs
(candidate PAIs, cPAIs), and PAI-like sequences not overlapping GIs (non-probable PAIs, nPAIs) data were downloaded from the PAI database http://www.gem.re.kr/.

Figure 1 Relation between sGCSs and GIs. Three genome islands
in Vibrio Choleae N16961, Streptococcus Suis ZY05 and Escherichia
coli O157 were plotted with sGCSs.

The genomic distances between GIs and sGCSs were
calculated using their genomic coordinates. For each GI,
the distance to the sGCSs was determined by the nearest sGCS. To compare genomic distances between different species, instead of using physical distances, we
obtained relative distances by dividing them with the
length of each genome. This way, relative distances in
different genomes are on the same scale (0 to 1) and are
thus mutually comparable. GI homologues were
obtained by searching evolutionarily highly-correlated
bacterial genomes. GIs found in at least two strains
were selected for analysis. For each pair, the BLASTN
algorithm was used to evaluate their similarity. GIs with
≥ 80% overlap to each other were considered pairs of
homologues. Evolutionary distance between each pair
was obtained by the sequence similarity distance in the
HKY85 model using PAUP [23,24]. The matrix of distances was parsed to obtain a list of evolutionary distances. Next, correlations between evolutionary
distances between homologous GIs and their corresponding genomic distances were calculated with R. A
phylogenic tree was also constructed via the neighbor
joining method using PAUP.

Results
Identifying special features in bacterial genomes: switch
signals of GC skews and GIs

The dataset used for this study includes 1090 bacterial
chromosomes (from 1009 bacterial species) as samples
and 83 chromosomes (from 79 archaeal species) as controls. In a previous study, sGCSs were used to predict
origins (ori) or termini (ter) of replication, as well as
gene density and purine excess (C+T-G-A) [5]. It was
hypothesized that sGCSs may be important signals for
genome bias. In this study, we investigated sGCSs for
specific GC content-related genomic features, using 2kb sliding windows with 1-kb steps along the various
genomes. We found that most of the bacteria, such as
Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, contain

much fewer sGCSs in their genomes compared to
archaea (Table 1). For further comparison, we counted
the number of bacteria and Archaea with different numbers of sGCSs (i.e., 2, 4-8, and ≥ 10, Table 1). In the
bacteria group, most genomes contain less than eight
sGCSs and show a simplified switch model of compositional bias (e.g., Bacteroidetes (24/25, 96%) and Firmicutes (188/188, 100%)) (Table 1). However, in ancient
bacterial genomes, the number of sGCSs is seldom
fewer than eight. For example, six of seven Aquificae
strains have more than eight sGCSs, while 53% of Actinobacteria and 44% of Cyanobacteria have more than
eight (see Table 1).
The acquisition of foreign DNA may modify compositional bias, and GC content change is a predominant

outcome of this process. Another outcome of foreign
DNA insertion is the appearance of GIs, which may
change the virulence or function of the host strain
(Figure 1D). In this study, we calculated GC content
deviations for all the bacterial genomes. Then, we
searched the genomic sequence for GIs by identifying
the genomic segments with GC contents significantly
different from the mean value of the genome (i.e.,
greater than three times the standard deviation). From
all of the genomes analyzed, 20,541 GIs were detected,
according to the above criteria, with lengths from 2 to
80 kb, depending on the size of the sliding window
used.

GIs are located next to sGCSs

Bacterial genomes exhibit strong sGCSs signals, which is
easy to understand because the genomes of different
strains often share one replicon (Figure 2 AB). For a
better comparison, we aligned all the genomes at the
ori, and calculated relative genomic positions by dividing
them with the length of each genome. sGCSs and pGIs
were then plotted according to their relative genomic
positions. When aligned at the origin and marked with
relative distances, the genomes had an overrepresentation of sGCSs at 1/3, 1/2, and 3/4 marks. (Figure 2 AB).
Furthermore, we found that aside from their special distribution (Figure 2 A), sGCSs are closely correlated with

GIs. These GIs are thought to have come from lateral
gene transfer (LGT) events between different species but
not from vertical inheritance due to their different genomic features. Based on the correlation between sGCSs
and GIs, we suspect that sGCS regions are hotspots for
horizontal DNA transfer in bacterial genomes,
The diversified frequency of sGCSs and variation of
GC skews in different genomes usually indicate different
replication mechanisms. To investigate the relationship
between sGCSs frequency and replication mechanisms,
we separated the genomes in the study into several
groups according to their sGCS numbers. For example,
in most typical Firmicutes (i.e., gram-positive bacteria),
such as S. suis, replicons often display specific patterns
and can therefore be easily detected in the genome. Firmicutes’ sGCSs are most often located at the replication
ori/ter and the middle of the genomes. Therefore, the
number of sGCSs is usually two. In some strains used in
industry, such as Streptomyces avermitilis, the number
of sGCSs is often greater than two because these strains
employ different replication mechanisms. Furthermore,
in bacteria such as Yersinia pestis KIM and Y. pestis
91001, sGCS distributions vary significantly due to large
scale genome rearrangements, duplications, and insertions. Notably, we found that the appearance of GIs
near sGCSs is not impacted by these replication
mechanisms and rearrangements. After categorizing the
genomes according to their sGCS numbers, we found
that for all categories, GIs are highly enriched in the
sGCS flanking regions (Figure 2C).
Recently acquired GIs were found in a significant
number of pathogen isolates [21,25]. Example of such
PAIs are VSP I and II in V. cholerae, which are only
found in the Vibrio seventh pandemic. LEE, a wellknown GI in Escherichia coli O157, encodes structural,
accessory, effector, and regulatory molecules and is
located near to ter sites [25]. An additional 87-kb O
island 48 (OI-48) is found in O157:H7 strains, EDL933,
and Sakai, which is associated with tellurite-resistance.
Our analysis successfully identified these GIs, demonstrating the validity of our approach. Another example
of this type of recently acquired island is a 89-kb genome fragment in S. suis that contains zeta-toxin, a twocomponent signal transduction system, and three ABC
transporter cassettes [21]. Again, these islands with
genes related to the toxins and infectivity of pathogens
are all located near sGCSs, indicating the correlations
between GIs and sGCSs.
Based on a phylogenetic analysis, newer GIs are more
likely to occur closer to sGCSs

To identify the origins of the GIs examined, we clustered the 14,921 pGIs from the 1009 bacterial genomes
into 158 groups and then conducted a large-scale

Page 5 of 7

phylogenetic analysis. Our analysis revealed that the
evolutionary distances of GIs are highly correlated with
their genomic positions. Two distances, the physical distance between a pGI to the closest sGCS (Ds) and the
evolutionary distance (De) between two homologus pGI,
were calculated. For each homologue group, we plotted
these two distances. To study the correlation between
Ds and De, we performed regression analysis on the two
distances (Figure 3). For the genomes with two sGCSs,
we saw a clear pattern. The plot of Ds vs. De reveals a
positive correlation (correlation = 0.818) in 0-25% genomic regions and a negative correlation (correlation =
-0.762) 25-50% regions (Figure 3). These results show
that for the pGIs near sGCSs (0-50%), the correlation is
statistically significant. The results agree with recent
acquisitions of these genomic islands, which were horizontally transferred into the susceptible regions of the
genomes recently and are therefore closer to sGCSs.
However, when the distance of a pGI to the nearest
sGCS is greater than 25% of the distance in the genomes with two sGCSs, the correlation is reversed, (i.e.,
the evolutionary distance is reduced with the increasing
of the physical distance from the sGCS). This observation indicates that when GIs were inserted in genomic
regions far from sGCSs, positive correlations between
physical distances and evolutionary distances no longer
hold. However, we did not find clear patterns for genomes with more than two sGCSs.
The phylogenic analysis of all of the GI groups also
suggests the correlation between Ds and De. For example, the well-known toxin co-regulated pilus (TCP) GI,

Figure 3 Correlation between GI evolutionary distance and
relative genomic distance. For each GI group, relative genomic
distance and evolutionary distance were calculated. Along the
relative genomic distance, average evolutionary distance were
calculated. Average evolutionary distance was then plotted against
relative genomic distance to reveal the correlation between relative
genomic distance and evolutionary distance.

found in four strains (N16961, MJ-1236, M66-2, and
O395) is located at 43.40, 43.58, 44.64, and 49.07% in
the genomes, respectively. We used N16961 as a standard for normalization and obtained evolutionary distances for the other three strains (0, 0, 0.00002, and
0.0003). Again, we observed a strong correlation
between Ds and De, indicating that in highly conserved
genomes, the physical distances of GIs to sGCSs are
highly correlated with the evolutionary distances
between them.

Discussion
Virulence properties of particular strains within a species
are often associated with the presence of specific horizontally acquired genetic elements [21]. The Human
Haplotype Project has identified the vast majority of conserved genome fragments, which separate the human
genome into numerous blocks [26,27]. Recently, a similar
study on Y. pestis revealed that the mosaic structure of
these blocks also exists in bacterial genomes [28]. The
boundaries of the blocks are thought to be hotspots of
recombination and insertion. For example, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is located between such
blocks [29]. Our study sheds light on the hotspots in genomes for GI insertion using a large scale comparative
genomic method. Our results suggest that GIs are likely
to be inserted at the block boundaries of genomes of bacteria and other microbes, and sGCSs in these genomes
are common separation spots for such blocks.
Via a phylogenetic analysis of each pGI and its homologues, we obtained the evolutionary distance for each
pair of homologous pGIs. After studying the correlation
between Ds and D e , we found that they are positively
correlated in regions closer to sGCSs (0-25%), while the
correlation is reversed in more distal regions (25 - 50%).
The turning point is near 25% region for geomes with
two sGCSs. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is currently unclear but may be caused by genomic
rearrangements or deletions.
In human pathogens, many PAIs are found in GIs,
such as VSP I and II in V. cholerae. However, generally
speaking, PAIs and GIs refer to different genomic features. On the one hand, PAIs are sometimes evaluated
by sequence similarity in other species, and these PAIs
do not display abnormal GC content. Additionally, not
all GIs are associated with pathogens. For example, in E.
coli CTF073, none of the four abnormal GC content
regions matches PAIs. These PAIs are different from
typical PAIs due to special genomic rearrangement
mechanisms. According to our observations, only laterally transferred GIs and newly acquired GIs are found
near sGCSs. Notably, these types of horizontally transferred GIs were discovered in recent emerging infectious
diseases and proven to enhance virulence or adaption of

Page 6 of 7

such strains [21,30]. Therefore, GIs are of great importance in revealing the mechanisms of certain epidemic
diseases. From the observation that GIs are likely to be
inserted at genomic block boundaries, we propose that
important virulence factors, which are associated with
the outbreaks of many common diseases and/or
enhanced virulence can be found near sGCSs.

Conclusion
In this study, in order to do a large scale study on the
properties of genomic island, we used 1090 bacterial
chromosomes (from 1009 bacterial species) as samples
and 83 chromosomes (from 79 archaeal) as controls and
separated them into three groups (sCGSs < = 2; 4 < =
sCGSs < = 8; sCGSs > = 10) according to the number
sCGSs. Interestingly, most of bacteria genomes contain
less than 8 sCGSs, while archaeal genomes often contain
more than 8 sCGSs. We then searched the genomic
sequence for GIs by identifying the genomic segments
with GC contents significantly different from the mean
value of the genome and detected 20,541 GIs. We separated the GIs into different homolog groups and studied
the correlation between relative genomic distance and
evolution distance and found that sGCS regions are hotspots for horizontal DNA transfer in bacterial genomes.
Since this is the first time for such an important property
to be revealed by a large scale comparative genomic
method, we believe our finding is of great importance for
predicting both genomic island and their insertion sites.

Abbreviations
sGCS: switch site of genome GC skew; GI: genomic island; PAI: pathogenicity
islands; pGI: putative genomic island.
