Abstract
Background: Long alpha-helical coiled-coil proteins are involved in diverse organizational and
regulatory processes in eukaryotic cells. They provide cables and networks in the cyto- and
nucleoskeleton, molecular scaffolds that organize membrane systems and tissues, motors, levers,
rotating arms, and possibly springs. Mutations in long coiled-coil proteins have been implemented
in a growing number of human diseases. Using the coiled-coil prediction program MultiCoil, we
have previously identified all long coiled-coil proteins from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and
have established a searchable Arabidopsis coiled-coil protein database.
Results: Here, we have identified all proteins with long coiled-coil domains from 21 additional fully
sequenced genomes. Because regions predicted to form coiled-coils interfere with sequence
homology determination, we have developed a sequence comparison and clustering strategy based
on masking predicted coiled-coil domains. Comparing and grouping all long coiled-coil proteins
from 22 genomes, the kingdom-specificity of coiled-coil protein families was determined. At the
same time, a number of proteins with unknown function could be grouped with already
characterized proteins from other organisms.
Conclusion: MultiCoil predicts proteins with extended coiled-coil domains (more than 250 amino
acids) to be largely absent from bacterial genomes, but present in archaea and eukaryotes. The
structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins and their relatives are the only long coiled-coil
protein family clearly conserved throughout all kingdoms, indicating their ancient nature. Motor
proteins, membrane tethering and vesicle transport proteins are the dominant eukaryote-specific
long coiled-coil proteins, suggesting that coiled-coil proteins have gained functions in the
increasingly complex processes of subcellular infrastructure maintenance and trafficking control of
the eukaryotic cell.

Background
The coiled-coil was one of the earliest protein structures
described and first discovered in the two-stranded coiledcoil protein alpha-keratin [1]. Coiled-coils consist of two

or more alpha-helices winding around each other in a
supercoil, a simple yet versatile protein fold [2]. Mutations in coiled-coil proteins have been implicated in a
large variety of human diseases such as severe skin fragilPage 1 of 21

ity, muscular dystrophies, neurodegenerative diseases,
progeria, and cancer [3-10]. Spurred by medical interest,
the number of investigated long coiled-coil proteins in
yeast and animals has rapidly grown in recent years.
Recently, a database of all long coiled-coil proteins in the
model plant Arabidopsis was established to facilitate the
identification and characterization of long coiled-coil proteins in plants [11]. In contrast to eukaryotic organisms,
only few long coiled-coil proteins have been characterized
in prokaryotes. Examples include chaperonins and nucleases, secretion proteins, and cytadherence factors [12-15].
The foremost feature of coiled-coil domains appears to be
their ability to act as "cellular velcro" to hold together
molecules, subcellular structures, and even tissues. They
can act as protein-protein interaction motifs, for examples
as dimerization domains in transcription factors and
receptor kinases [16-18]. They function as "zippers" in
membrane fusion proteins [19], and as adapters between
molecules and solid state cellular structures, such as in
microtubule organizing centers, the nuclear pores and
lamina, actin- and microtubule-associated proteins and
cytoskeleton-associated E3 ubiquitin ligases [20-24].
Extracellular coiled-coil proteins include cell adherence
factors and surface receptors, vertebrate blood components such as apolipoproteins and fibrinogen-like clotting
factors, and extracellular matrix components such as laminins and cartilage matrix proteins forming tissue scaffolds in metazoa [25,26].
Besides associating with and interconnecting other molecules and macromolecular structures, long coiled-coil
domains exhibit a number of structural and mechanical
functions [27]. Typically, long coiled-coil domains form
rod-like tertiary structures [2] and assemble to dynamic
fibers, meshworks and scaffolds. Examples are the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton and nuclear lamina
[28]. Recent evidence suggests an important role for the
dynamic properties of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments
in neurodegenerative diseases [29]. Other coiled-coils act
as spacers, for example in the yeast spindle pole body
where the distance between the plaques is determined by
the length of the coiled-coil domain in the connecting
proteins [30,31]. Membrane-bound coiled-coil proteins
such as the spectrins and golgins form scaffolds for membrane structures within the cell [32,33]. In combination
with other functional domains, coiled-coil domains are
an integral part of molecular motors, such as the actin
motor myosin and the microtubule motors kinesin and
dynein [34]. Other coiled-coil proteins with ATPase and
GTPase domains often function in folding and repair, e.g.
as chaperonins in protein folding, and topoisomerases
and nucleases in DNA remodeling [35-37].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/66

On a primary structure level, amino acid sequences with
the capacity to form left-handed alpha-helical coiled-coils
are characterized by a heptad repeat pattern in which residues in the first and fourth position are hydrophobic,
and residues in the fifth and seventh position are predominantly charged or polar [38]. This pattern of hydrophobic
and polar residues interferes with sequence comparison
algorithms, which often lead to false predictions of homology between long coiled-coil proteins based on the low
complexity and repeat nature of the underlying sequence
motif. On the other hand, this repeat pattern can also be
used to predict coiled-coil domains in amino acid
sequences by computational means [39-42].
In the post-genomics era, such structure-prediction algorithms can now be applied to whole proteomes. Based on
the prediction algorithm COILS, roughly 10% of all proteins encoded by eukaryotic genomes contain coiled-coil
domains whereas prokaryotic genomes contain only 4–
5% [43]. Using the MultiCoil program, one in every 11
proteins in yeast was predicted to contain a coiled-coil
sequence [44]. However, these studies did not use a cutoff for domain length to determine coiled-coils. A minimum length of three to four heptad repeats is required for
the formation of a stable coiled-coil using synthetic peptides [45-47]. Using this minimum domain length of 20
amino acids (or about three heptad repeats), 5.6% of the
predicted ORFs in the fully sequenced Arabidopsis
genome were found to encode coiled-coil proteins [11].
In a comparative genomics approach, we determined the
coiled-coil content of 22 predicted whole proteomes
using the prediction pipeline and processing software
developed to create the ARABI-COIL database [11]. The
22 genomes analyzed included four archaeal genomes,
ten bacterial genomes (three gram-positive and seven
gram-negative species), and eight eukaryotic genomes
(two each for yeasts, invertebrates, mammals, and plants).

Results
Prediction and selection of coiled-coil proteins was performed using the MultiCoil algorithm [42] and the
ExtractProp processing software [11]. For the purpose of
this study, "long coiled-coil" proteins were defined
according to the parameters used to establish the ARABICOIL database and included all sequences with at least
one coiled-coil domain and minimum domain length of
70, two domains and minimum domain length of 50, and
three or more domains and minimum domain length of
30 [11].
Eukaryotic genomes contain higher percentages of long
coiled-coil proteins than prokaryotic genomes
Proteins predicted to form coiled-coil domains were
present in all genomes analyzed (Table 1, Figure 1) and

comprised between 2% and 8% of the total proteomes.
The most pronounced difference between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic genomes was in the percentage of genes per
genome predicted to encode long or multiple coiled-coil
domains. With increasing coiled-coil domain length cutoff, lower percentages of proteins were identified in bacterial genomes. With the exception of Bacillus subtilis, MultiCoil predicted no coiled-coil proteins with domains

longer than 250 amino acids in the bacterial genomes
analyzed. However, archaeal and eukaryotic genomes
contain proteins predicted to form coiled-coils of this
length. Strikingly, prediction of coiled-coil domains over
400 amino acids in length was completely absent in bacterial genomes, but present in eukaryotes as well as two
archaea, Sulfolobus solfataricus and Archeoglobus fulgidus.

of prokaryotic SMC proteins (Figure 2).

Archaea
Four archaeal genomes were included in this study and
tables with coiled-coil protein details are available in
additional file 1 (Archeoglobus fulgidus, Table S1; Methanococcus jannaschii, Table S2; Sulfolobus solfataricus, Table S3;
and Thermoplasma acidophilum, Table S4). 2–3% of the
genes in these archaea were found to code for coiled-coil
proteins. In contrast to eubacteria, all of the coiled-coil
size-classes analyzed are represented in this group, with
proteins predicted to form coiled-coils longer than 400
residues present in Methanococcus jannaschii and Archeoglobus fulgidus proteomes (see Figure 1).

cies. Three gram-positive bacterial genomes (additional
file 1; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Table S5; Bacillus subtilis,
Table S6; and Mycoplasma genitalium, Table S7), and seven
gram-negative bacterial genomes (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Table S8; Chromobacterium violaceum, Table S9;
Escherichia coli, Table S10; Heliobacter pylori, Table S11;
Chlamydia pneumoniae, Table S12; Borrelia burgdorferi,
Table S13; and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis, Table
S14) were analyzed.
The largest prokaryotic coiled-coil domains were identified in proteins of the SMC, Rad50, SbcC and MukB families. These proteins contain globular head and tail
domains separated by a coiled-coil rod with a hinge [48].
Figure 2 summarizes schematic diagrams of the domain
structures of the prokaryotic SMC and SMC-like proteins
identified in this study based on our coiled-coil prediction
data and conserved domains as identified through Conserved Domain Database (CDD) searches [49]. Figure 3
shows a summary of additional long coiled-coil proteins
with domains of at least 150 amino acids in length
present in prokaryotic genomes. A number of these proteins are involved in membrane events, such as chemosensing via methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins [50]
and membrane fusion and vesicle formation mediated by
AcrA, TolA, and incA proteins [51-53]. Others function as
adhesion proteins, for example the lambda phage side tail
fiber protein [54] and the hmw2 protein of the attachment organelle of Mycoplasma pneumoniae [15], or as
enzymes of the cell wall such as the NlpC/P60 proteins
[55].
Long coiled-coil domains cause clustering of unrelated
coiled-coil sequences
Sequences predicted to form long coiled-coil domains
were analyzed for family relationships and conservation
across species in an all-against-all approach using the
Smith-Waterman sequence comparison algorithm followed by clustering based on an adaptation of Kruskal's
minimum cost spanning tree algorithm [56,57].

In a pilot analysis to test the feasibility of the clustering
approach, all prokaryotic sequences meeting the aforementioned criteria for "long coiled-coil" proteins were
included in the clustering. Due to the larger number of
qualified sequences in the eukaryotic species, only the
longest domains (at least 250 residues in length) or
sequences largely covered by coiled-coil (at least 60% of
the sequence) were included in the combined pilot
sequence set comprising 527 unique sequences. A maximum P-score of 1.0e-20 was used as the critical threshold
when selecting only the most prominent sequence similarities in this test group. In all, 12,013 pair-wise P-score
values were selected, defining as many unique relationships from the 277,729 possible pair-wise relationships.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/66

Sequences were then grouped using Kruskal's minimum
cost spanning tree algorithm using the P-score value as the
edge weight for the selected P-score values. 166 independent non-overlapping sequence subsets (subtrees) were
defined in this manner. The largest grouping consisted of
270 sequences, representing over half of the sequences in
the pilot sequence set and including functionally distinct
families such as for example myosins, golgins, and SMC
proteins. Distinct clusters of long coiled-coil proteins
besides this large, heterogeneous group were formed by
the animal and yeast tropomyosins (two separate clusters), the laminins, the CASP/CDP-family and the nuclear
lamins.
Masking of coiled-coil domains before clustering
To prevent clustering based on the inherent coiled-coil
repeat similarities, amino acids predicted to form coiledcoil domains were computationally masked out before
being subjected to sequence similarity comparison (Figure 4). The clustering of the sequences with masked
coiled-coil domains yielded a much more accurate grouping of known long coiled-coil protein families such as the
myosins, golgins, and SMC proteins (Table 2). The largest
group of long coiled-coil proteins with 58 sequences comprised the myosin motor proteins. The laminins, CASP/
CDP, and nuclear lamins still exhibited the prior cluster
profile, however the tropomyosin clusters did not appear
after masking the coiled-coil domains. The coiled-coil
coverage for many of the tropomyosins was predicted as
100% in our analysis, effectively excluding this protein
family from the sequence comparison after masking.
Clustering analysis with masked coiled-coil domains
After determining the consistency of clusters formed after
masking coiled-coil domains with well-known coiled-coil
protein families such as the SMC proteins, myosins and
kinesins, we proceeded to cluster all 3576 predicted long
coiled-coil sequences from the 22 genomes. The clustering
algorithm was further improved to first preclude transitively similar sequences by requiring all sequences in each
cluster to satisfy the P-score threshold for all pair-wise
relationships within the cluster and secondly to identify
"bridge" sequences meeting these criteria for multiple
clusters (see Material and Methods for details). A P-score
threshold of 10e-06 was selected as the appropriate balance of sequence coverage and cluster discrimination.
Table 3 gives an overview of the sequences from each species contributing to the clustering analysis using the 1.0e06 P-score cut-off. The high number of species-specific
sequences found in rice is caused by retrotransposon
repeats in the rice genome containing predicted coiledcoil domains within a putative transposase ORF. Figure 5
shows the distribution of clusters among the different
kingdoms. Sequence annotation including species origin
provided further insight into functions and relationships

Largest clusters identified in a pilot analysis using all prokaryotic long
coiled-coil proteins and eukaryotic proteins with coiled-coil domains
longer than 250 amino acids or more than 60% coverage. Only
clusters with four or more members are listed. ROCK, Rhoassociated coiled-coil containing kinase [114]; ELKS/ERC1, Rab6interacting protein [115], SLAP, sarcolemmal-associated protein
[116]; DOC1, downregulated in ovarian cancer 1 [117]; CENP-F,
centromer protein F [118]. For species name abbreviations, see Table

eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic genomes (see Table 4).
Another group of conserved proteins with long coiledcoils comprised a number of eukaryotic Ser/Thr-kinases
and a homolog from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis
(sll0776 in Figure S1, additional file 2). However, proteins belonging to this cluster could not be found in any
other prokaryotic genome.
A number of smaller cluster were formed containing proteins with shorter coiled-coil domains close to the cut-off
for our analysis. One cluster comprised the translation initiation factor IF-2, containing the respective sequences
from Drosophila, E. coli, mouse, rice and yeast. Another
cluster with sequences conserved in prokaryotes as well as
eukaryotes contained the AAA+ family ATPase ClpB/
Hsp104 represented by plant, yeast and bacterial
sequences. This protein functions as a protease/chaperonin in eubacteria, plants and mitochondria [35]. Two
small clusters combined sequences from prokaryotes and
plant genomes. One cluster comprised mitochondrial
seryl-tRNA synthetases conserved in plant mitochondria
as well as archaea while the second cluster comprised the
PspA-like VIPP1 protein from plastids and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. VIPP1 is involved in thylakoid biosynthesis in both chloroplasts as well as cyanobacteria,

possibly acting in thylakoid membrane trafficking
[58,59].
Prokaryotic coiled-coil protein clusters
Prokaryotic clusters comprised membrane-bound proteins and signal transducers, as well as membrane-spanning transporters and secretion proteins such as the HlyD
family [60]. The only cluster specific to prokaryotes represented by more than ten sequences in this study comprised the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs;
Table 5; [50]). Smaller prokaryotic clusters contained the
aforementioned ABC-ATPases RAD50 and SbcC involved
in DNA repair and a highly conserved group of archaeal
proteins of unknown function (COG1340, represented by
NP_394939 in Figure 3).

Eukaryotic coiled-coil protein clusters
The main clusters formed by eukaryotic sequences only
(Table 6) were the eukaryotic motor proteins: the actin
motor myosin and the microtubule motor kinesin and the
related kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein KCBP
[34,61,62]. The proteins of the SMC5 and SMC6 families
formed a eukaryotic cluster instead of clustering together
with the condensin/cohesin SMCs 1–4 and the prokaryotic SMC proteins in our analysis (Figure 6B). Eukaryotic
RAD50 proteins clustered separately from prokaryotic
RAD50s as well, indicating a higher convergence of the
non-coiled-coil RAD50 ATPase domains as compared to
the SMC 1–4 head and tail domains. Additional larger
clusters included eukaryotic Ser/Thr-kinases and a family
comprised of the Retinoblastoma-associated protein
RBP95, Ring Finger Proteins 20 and 40, and yeast Bre1p
[63,64,23] (Figure S2, additional file 2, and Table S15,

additional file 3). Formin-related proteins associated with
growing actin fibers [65,66] were found in animal/yeast
and animal/plant cluster combinations. Smaller conserved eukaryotic clusters included a number of proteins
involved in vesicle transport, such as a Rab6 GTPase-activating protein involved in retrograde transport [67], the
golgin CASP [68] and the vesicular transport proteins
P115 (see Figure S3, additional file 2), autophagy protein
APG6 [69,70], and early endosome antigen (EEA1, [71])
homologs (see Figure S4, additional file 2).
Yeast, yeast-plant, and yeast-animal coiled-coil protein
clusters
Eukaryotic genomes included the baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces

pombe) as eukaryotic, unicellular organisms. Protein clusters found to be specific for yeast were typically small (one
sequence from each yeast genome, see additional file 4)
and comprised proteins involved in RNA export, such as
Gle1, [72] and Mlp1 [73], the spindle assembly checkpoint protein Mad1 [74], and GRIP-domain golgins
[75,76]. These proteins have known homologs in other
eukaryotic proteomes, which did not cluster together with
the yeast proteins, likely due to a high overall coverage
with coiled-coil sequences (e.g. up to 70% coiled-coil coverage for Mlp1/Tpr, up to 74% for MAD1, and up to 75%
for GRIP-golgins). Another functional group of yeast proteins were cell polarity proteins such as Spa2 and Tea1
[77,78]. Tea1 clustered together with a number of plant
sequences of unknown function containing Kelch repeats
[79] in combination with coiled-coil domains. Proteins
that were found in clusters specific to yeasts and animals
(Table 7) included the microtubule motor dynein as well
as proteins involved in endocytosis and microtubule
dynamics, such as intersectin, restin and cytoplasmic
linker proteins (CLIP) [80]. A number of myosin subclusters, for example myosin type II, was represented only by
yeast and animal but not plant sequences, consistent with
previous findings [81] (see Table 7 and Figure 6B).
Animal coiled-coil protein clusters
From the metazoan kingdom, genomes from nematodes
(Caenorhabditis elegans), flies (Drosophila melanogaster),
and mammals (Mus musculus and Homo sapiens) were analyzed. Clusters that appeared to be specific to animals
(Table 8) comprised a variety of proteins crosslinking
cytoskeletal components with membranes, such as spectrin- and periplakin-like membrane-actin and membraneIF crosslinkers [32,82], the plasmamembrane-scaffolding
Liprins [83], the family of Merlin and Ezrin/Radixin/
Moesin (ERM) proteins [84,85], and a number of Golgiand vesicle-associated proteins. Other groups comprised
centrosome-associated and mitotic spindle checkpoint
proteins. Type X myosins grouped together in a metazoan
cluster without plant or yeast sequences. Another animalspecific group contained coiled-coil proteins involved in
structural integrity such as the extracellular scaffolding

protein Laminin [26] and intermediate filament proteins
including the nuclear lamins and neurofilaments [86,87].
Smaller animal-specific clusters contained protein
sequences involved in cell attachment and motility,
embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and immune cell movement.
A number of the clusters containing animal sequences
were limited to mammalian sequences only (Table 9). The
hair fiber protein keratin was found to form the largest
group of proteins specific to mammals. Other mammlian
clusters comprised neurofilament proteins and crosslinkers of the actin cytoskeleton and were found to overlap
with clusters containing invertebrate sequences as well. A
number of smaller mammalian clusters (see additional
file 5, Table S17) contained sequences of unknown function which have so far only been characterized as autoantigens or cancer antigens. Smaller clusters included the
centrosomal protein Ninein, which is involved in anchoring microtubule minus ends [88], and a number of other
centrosomal proteins including TACCs, C-NAP1, and
Centriolin [89-91]. Other clusters included mammalian
reproductive organ-specific proteins, such as sperm tailassociated proteins and mammary gland-specific pro-

teins, vertebrate-specific transcription factors and coactivators such as the SOX proteins [92], and regulators of
endothelial cell motility and clotting factors in blood vessels.
Plant coiled-coil protein clusters
As representatives for the plant kingdom, a dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) and a monocot (Oryza sativa) plant
genome were analyzed. Clusters of long coiled-coil proteins specific to Arabidopsis and rice contained mostly
sequences of so far unknown function (Table 10). The rice
genome contains a large number of transposon-derived
ORFs which are predicted to contain coiled-coil domains,
therefore a large number of plant-specific clusters was represented by rice sequences only. These have been omitted
from Table 10. Plant-specific clusters represented by both
plant species analyzed included kinase interacting protein
1 (KIP1) and its relatives [93], the family of filament-like
plant proteins, FPPs [94], and a cluster of putative Zinc
finger transcription factors homologous to the x1 gene of
maize [95]. Smaller clusters (see additional file 6, Table
S18) included nuclear matrix constituent protein 1
(NMPC1) and relatives [96], and the chloroplast unusual
positioning 1 (CHUP1) actin-interacting protein [97].

for filament-forming prokaryotic coiled-coils. These
included Heliobacter pylori proteins previously suggested
as candidates for bacterial filament proteins [99].

may qualify for two or more overlapping cluster, e.g. resulting in prokaryotic SMCs clustering with different types of
diverged eukaryotic SMC proteins.

Several clusters showed overlap between the plant and
animal kingdoms (Table 11). These included a number of
kinesin subclusters, vesicle trafficking proteins, and Guanylate-binding proteins (Figure S5).

Discussion
The SMC proteins are the most widely conserved coiledcoil proteins
The most widely conserved family of long coiled-coil proteins found in our study comprised the SMC proteins.
Representatives from almost all species analyzed were
found in this cluster, with a few exceptions such as the
gram-negative bacterium E. coli. This is consistent with
previous findings that SMC proteins are present in eukaryotes as well as all gram-positive bacteria and nearly all
archaea, but only less than half of the gram-negative bacteria. It has been proposed that eukaryotic smc genes
evolved from archaeal precursors by two consecutive gene
duplications [48]. Bacteria without SMC proteins often
contain an SMC-related long coiled-coil protein involved
in chromosome segregation or DNA repair, such as MukB
or SbcC [98,13].

Metazoan mitotic motor proteins lack homologs in plants
The presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells is closely
linked with the presence of a motile cytoskeleton, in particular the mitotic structures necessary to orchestrate
nuclear division, and the endocytic pathway. Dolan et al.
[100] proposed a list of motility proteins involved in
mitotic processes as candidates for homology searches in
prokaryotes to determine their evolutionary origin. We
found 70% of the suggested proteins (Astrin, CENP-E,
Centrin, Dynein, Dynactin, Kinesin, Kinectin, MAD,
NuMA, Pericentrin) among the long coiled-coil proteins
identified in our analysis, however none of them clustered
together with sequences from archaea or bacteria. Interestingly, with the exception of the kinesins, we also could
not find any of these proteins clustering with plant
sequences. With the exception of dynein, kinesin and
MAD proteins, we could not find clustering of these
mitotic motility proteins with yeast sequences either.

The organization of mitotic microtubule nucleation and
the composition of the nuclear envelope in plant cells differ significantly from metazoan cells [101]. One hypothesis to explain these differences is the separate
development of specialized mechanisms to orchestrate
open mitosis in metazoan and plant lineages, leading to
the evolution of different nuclear envelope compositions,
targeting mechanisms, and mitotic spindle nucleation in
the plant and animal kingdoms. This model explains the
absence of many metazoan mitotic motility proteins in
plants as well as yeast, which undergoes closed mitosis,
and suggests that this group of proteins evolved after the
occurrence of open mitosis.
We could not find any plant-specific classes of coiled-coil
motor proteins, but noted kinesin subclusters largely represented by plant sequences only, indicating an expansion
of this group of motor proteins during plant evolution
(see Figure 6B). It has been noted before that Arabidopsis
contains a surprisingly large number of kinesins [102],
and it has been suggested that plant-specific kinesin subfamilies might be involved in stress responses or pathogen
defenses [103].
Differences and similarities in cytoskeletal and membrane
infrastructure between plants and animals
Besides the motor proteins (myosins, kinesins, dyneins),
membrane tethering and vesicle transport proteins appear

to be specific for eukaryotes in our clustering analysis,
indicating another major class of specialized coiled-coil
proteins that evolved after the formation of eukaryotic
cells. It has been previously suggested that the higher content of long coiled-coil domains in metazoa compared to
plants and protists indicates the presence of extensive
coiled-coil matrices in animal cells and tissues [25]. One
of the groups of coiled-coil proteins apparently absent in
plants and yeasts are the nuclear matrix and intermediate
filament proteins. No lamin sequences could be identified
from the plant genomes. Other differences we noted
between the plant and animal kingdoms are the lack of
membrane-cytoskeleton crosslinkers and scaffolding proteins, such as spectrin-like proteins and many actin- and
microtubule-associated proteins, in plant proteomes. This
might indicate differences in the overall organization and
networking of membrane systems and the actin and
microtubule cytoskeleton in plant and animal cells.
Differences in coiled-coil content between genomes
Earlier surveys of coiled-coil sequences in GenBank had
suggested that invertebrate genomes contain more coiledcoils than vertebrates, and that animal genomes contain
four times more "extended" coiled-coils (>75 amino
acids) than plant genomes [25]. While we could not find
such a difference for the overall coiled-coil content or the
group of proteins defined as "long" coiled-coils in this
study, we did note a significantly lower percentage of
coiled-coils longer than 250 amino acids in yeast as well
as plants compared to the animal genomes (see Figure 1).
On average, the yeasts contained one third of the percentage of coiled-coils present in vertebrate genomes with
domains longer than 100 and longer than 250 residues

(37% and 35%, respectively), whereas invertebrates contained about two thirds (60% and 73%, respectively). The
plant genomes, however, contained on average 57% of
the percentage of proteins with coiled-coil domains
longer than 100 amino acids, but only 22% of the coiledcoils with 250 amino acids and longer when compared to
vertebrates. An interesting observation is that the human
genome appears to contain more extended coiled-coil
proteins than the mouse genome. Our data suggests that
this is caused by the human proteome sequence set containing more unique long coiled-coil proteins without
homologs in other species (see Table 3), as well as more
redundant sequences in clusters (e.g. comparing counts of
human versus mouse sequences in clusters listed in additional file 5, Table S17).
Comparison with other genome-wide coiled-coil
predictions
Comparable with the Arabidopsis coiled-coil protein
database ARABI-COIL, this study takes a more restrictive
approach to identifying coiled-coil proteins than previous
genome-wide approaches to predict coiled-coil proteins
[44,43]. In contrast to the older studies, our prediction criteria included a minimum coiled-coil domain length corresponding to about three heptad repeats to eliminate
sequences with short stretches of predicted coiled-coils
unlikely to form stable structures [11]. Using these parameters, on average about 6.4% of all proteins in the eukaryotic proteomes and about 3.5% in the prokaryotic
proteomes (2.6% in archaea, 3.7% in bacteria) contained
coiled-coil domains. Our results were consistent with the
study of Liu and Rost [43] in that most eukaryotic
genomes contained more coiled-coil proteins than

prokaryotic genomes, and most bacterial genomes more
than archaea. The more restrictive parameters used here
resulted in predicting on average about 65–70% of the
number of proteins found in those previous studies. Liu
and Rost [43] further found an exceptionally high coiledcoil content in Heliobacter pylori with a higher percentage
than C. elegans, and an exceptionally low coiled-coil content in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our analysis was consistent with these previous observations and resulted in
5.6% coiled-coil for Heliobacter pylori versus 5.4% in C. elegans and only 1.8% in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the lowest percentage for all 22 genomes analyzed here.
Limitations of the prediction and clustering analysis
Discontinuous coiled-coil domain predictions
MultiCoil provides a more stringent coiled-coil prediction
than other programs such as COILS, resulting in less false
positive predictions. In tests on the PDB database of
solved protein structures, two-thirds of the sequences predicted by COILS did not contain coiled-coils [104]. By
comparison, the programs PAIRCOIL and MultiCoil perform significantly better [42]. Occasionally, however, the
increased stringency might lead to prediction of fragmented domains where continuous domains have been
experimentally verified, as evident in the case of the SMC
proteins (see Figure 2).

Selection of long coiled-coil proteins only
In this study, we focused on proteins potentially involved
in structural functions. As the emphasis was placed on
proteins with long or multiple coiled-coil domains, it is
possible that our selection criteria resulted in the exclusion of homologs of proteins with short stretches of
coiled-coil that barely qualified for the analysis. The selection criteria applied in this study have been shown to
exclude 97% of the known bZIP proteins from Arabidopsis [11]. Other examples we noted are the translation initiation factor IF-2, mitochondrial and prokaryotic seryltRNA synthetases, and the ClpB/HSP104 family of heatshock proteins. Members of these protein families failed
to meet the selection criteria for long coiled-coil domains,
making it difficult to draw conclusions for these protein
families from our clustering analysis. We therefore
focused our attention on clusters with mainly proteins
containing longer coiled-coils (>150 amino acids).
Effect of coiled-coil masking in the clustering analysis
When clustering sequences with long coiled-coil domain
in the pilot analysis, the majority of proteins with long
coiled-coil domains was grouped together in one large
cluster. Many of the proteins with unknown functions in
this group were annotated as "myosin-like", however only
about 20% of the proteins in the cluster actually con-

tained a myosin motor domain. In the other cases, the
only similarity to myosin was the presence of a long
coiled-coil domain similar to the myosin coiled-coil tail.
This illustrates the ease with which long coiled-coil
domains can lead to misannotations in databases with
annotations based on sequence similarity searches.
Masking the coiled-coil domains before sequence comparison and clustering significantly increased the specificity of the clustering analysis, however protein sequences
with high coiled-coil coverage were lost in the subsequent
clustering as the masking left little to no sequence for
comparison. Examples are the animal and yeast tropomyosins, many of which were predicted to contain 100%
coiled-coil coverage, paramyosin, and the plant cytoskeletal protein CIP1 with more than 80% coiled-coil coverage
[105].

Conclusion
Our genome-wide identification of coiled-coil proteins
and subsequent clustering provides data suggesting evolutionary conservation or uniqueness of coiled-coil proteins
among 22 fully sequenced genomes. We found SMC,
MukB, SbcC and Rad50 proteins to be the proteins with

the longest coiled-coil domains occurring in prokaryotes,
whereas eukaryotic proteomes also contained proteins
with stretches of coiled-coil longer than the SMC rod
domains. The high conservation of the SMC proteins and
their structural relatives involved in chromosome maintenance and repair demonstrates the universal importance
and conservation of DNA housekeeping mechanisms.
Long coiled-coil proteins specific to eukaryotes are predominantly involved in subcellular infrastructure maintenance and trafficking control. Table 12 gives an overview
of the functional classes of long coiled-coil proteins found
in our analysis and their representation in different kingdoms. The genomes of higher plants lack sequences coding for intermediate filament proteins. Many of the
known mitotic spindle associated coiled-coil motor proteins in animals lack homologs in plants, consistent with
the absence of a centrosomal microtubule organization
center in plant cells. However, the kinesin family of
microtubule motor proteins appears to have expanded
during the evolution of higher plants.
The repeat nature of the coiled-coil motif makes it difficult
to clearly determine sequence homology relationships

In summary, the modified FASTA files were used as input
for the MultiCoil application installed on the Linux Cluster of the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC, Columbus,
OH). The MultiCoil output was post-processed using the
previously described Java-based ExtractProp Suite [11]
and used to establish a database of coiled-coil prediction
data for each organism. The same coiled-coil selectivity
criteria applied to ARABI-COIL were used to select
sequences predicted to contain long or multiple coiledcoil domains. These criteria impose a minimum coiledcoil domain of 30 residues if at least three domains are
present in the translated reading frame, a minimum of 50
residues if at least two domains are present, and a minimum coiled-coil length of 70 residues if only a single
domain is present. Intra-domain gaps of less than 20 residues were considered contiguous for purposes of establishing domain length. The resulting data was converted
to XML and used to populate MySQL databases for each
genome.
Masking of coiled-coil domains
To eliminate interference of the coiled-coil repeat motif
with sequence homology analysis, coiled-coil domains
were "masked" before subjecting the sequences to SmithWaterman sequence similarity searches. Mask information was created based on the processed MultiCoil prediction data generated to populate the MySQL databases for
each genome. A Java-based program was applied to the
FASTA sequences selected for Smith-Waterman comparison to replace all amino acids predicted to be contained
in coiled-coil domains with the letter X, effectively masking coiled-coil domains.
Sequence similarity comparison
Smith-Waterman comparison was conducted using the
TimeLogic Smith-Waterman implementation at OSC and
the Blosum62 scoring matrix on all unique sequences in
the combined sequences set. Sequences with masked
coiled-coil domains were used as query on unmasked
sequence sets as target. A P-score cut-off of 1.0e-03 was
used as a threshold for selecting sequence similarity relationships. For sequences to be characterized as pair-wise
similar and recovered for use in the clustering analysis, the
P-score value must be less than this threshold based on
the query-target Smith-Waterman comparison.
Clustering analysis
After completing the pair-wise similarity calculation using
the Smith-Waterman algorithm and extracting sequence
pairs and associated P-scores, sequences were grouped
using a modified version of Kruskal's minimum cost spanning tree algorithm [57]. The algorithm creates and progressively merges sub-trees of a graph in building a
minimum cost spanning tree. In the algorithm, the
weights of edges in the directed graph were determined by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/66

the pair-wise P-score similarity value for the sequence as a
query relative to the related sequence as a target. An effective clustering can be achieved by using only P-score similarity values which are below a specified threshold,
effectively creating a disconnected series of related
sequences.
The clustering was tested in a pilot analysis on a combined
sequence set including 527 prokaryotic long coiled-coil
proteins and eukaryotic proteins containing extended
coiled-coil domains of at least 250 amino acids in length
or at least 60% of the protein sequence in a coiled-coil.
Edges with P-scores greater than 1.0e-03 to 1.0e-15 were
ignored when combining sub-trees in the algorithm. The
success of the clustering was estimated by observing the
clustering behavior of well-known coiled-coil protein
families, such as SMC proteins and myosins. After testing
the effects of masking the coiled-coil domains and optimizing cut-offs for P-scores during clustering, the complete coiled-coil sequence set containing 3576 long
coiled-coil proteins from the 22 genomes was processed
similarly. Different P-score thresholds were explored in
efforts to increase specificity in the multi-genome
sequence set while preserving comprehensive coverage.
Employing Kruskal's algorithm, the 3576 sequence set
resulted in 156 clusters covering 3567 sequences using a
threshold of 1.0e-03, 467 clusters covering 3551
sequences using a threshold of 1.0e-6 and 850 clusters
covering 3520 sequences using a threshold of 1.0e-15.
(For comparison, the same algorithm yielded 490 clusters
for the unmasked sequence set).
Even with the improved selectivity of the clustering demonstrated in the pilot investigation using masked coiledcoil sequences, the overall effectiveness of the resulting
clustering still required refinement to achieve sufficient
specificity. The use of Kruskal's algorithm for subset selection enabled transitively similar sequences to be included
in specific clusters. (Transitively similar sequences are
sequences in which sequence A is similar to sequence B
and sequence B is similar to sequence C thereby clustering
sequence A and C which would otherwise not belong to
the same cluster.) One drawback of this simplified clustering is that a given sequence need only be similar to at least
one other sequence in the cluster. This limitation resulted
in clusters containing sequences which, while closely
related to at least one other sequence in a cluster, were not
closely related to every sequence within the cluster.
The algorithm was consequently improved to specifically
preclude transitively similar sequences by requiring all
sequences in a given cluster to satisfy the P-score threshold
for all pair-wise relationships in the cluster. The new algorithm dramatically improved specificity, with the same
3576 masked sequence set generating 1213 non-overlap-

ping clusters covering 3567 sequences, 1263 non-overlapping clusters covering 3551 sequences, and 1384 nonoverlapping clusters covering 3520 sequences with the
improved algorithm for the same corresponding P-score
threshold values. The P-score threshold of 1.0e-06 was
selected as the appropriate balance of sequence coverage
and cluster discrimination required.

The interest in identifying sequences which qualified for
more than one cluster and bridged multiple clusters of
protein families drove a second modification of the clustering algorithm. By design, the modified Kruskal's algorithm created mutually orthogonal, non-overlapping
clusters while precluding transitively similar sequences
from populating the same cluster. The 'greedy' algorithm
was modified to specifically identify transitively similar
sequences between clusters, enabling a unique ability to
identify "bridge" sequences which satisfy participation criteria in multiple clusters or protein families. The modification amounted to simply validating each sequence's
individual ability to satisfy participation criteria for a cluster based on the non-overlapping cluster partitioning.
