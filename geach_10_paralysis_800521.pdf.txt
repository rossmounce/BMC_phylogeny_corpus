Paralysis and delayed Z-disc formation in the
Xenopus tropicalis unc45b mutant dicky ticker
Timothy J Geach, Lyle B Zimmerman*

Abstract
Background: The protein components of mature skeletal muscle have largely been characterized, but the
mechanics and sequence of their assembly during normal development remain an active field of study. Chaperone
proteins specific to sarcomeric myosins have been shown to be necessary in zebrafish and invertebrates for proper
muscle assembly and function.
Results: The Xenopus tropicalis mutation dicky ticker results in disrupted skeletal muscle myofibrillogenesis, paralysis,
and lack of heartbeat, and maps to a missense mutation in the muscle-specific chaperone unc45b. Unc45b is
known to be required for folding the head domains of myosin heavy chains, and mutant embryos fail to
incorporate muscle myosin into sarcomeres. Mutants also show delayed polymerization of a-actinin-rich Z-bodies
into the Z-disks that flank the myosin-containing A-band.
Conclusions: The dicky ticker phenotype confirms that a requirement for myosin-specific chaperones is conserved
in tetrapod sarcomerogenesis, and also suggests a novel role for myosin chaperone function in Z-body maturation.

Background
The sarcomere is the fundamental unit of the muscle
myofibril, and mediates ATP-dependent contraction
and relaxation. While the components of sarcomeres
are well understood, the mechanics and sequence of
their assembly remain under debate. A key early process in myofibrillogenesis is the polymerization of aactinin-rich Z-bodies into the Z-discs that flank the
myosin-containing A-band. In a mature vertebrate sarcomere, Z-discs are held in register with the central
M-band by titin filaments tightly associated with filamentous actin [1,2].
Molecular chaperones, which mediate specific protein
maturation events, have recently been shown to play
important roles in vertebrate myofibrillogenesis. Originally identified as an uncoordinated nematode mutation
[3,4], the muscle-specific chaperone unc45b cooperates
with hsp90 to fold the N-terminal globular motor (S1)
domain of sarcomeric myosins [5-7]. Depletion of these
gene functions in zebrafish results in absence of integrated myosin in the sarcomere [8-11], but no effects on
Z-disc formation were noted. While in vitro studies of

Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, NW7 1AA, UK

these chaperones in cultured mammalian myoblasts
have supported roles in sarcomere formation [6,12], in
vivo requirements for these proteins have not been
described in vertebrates other than teleost fish.
Vertebrate myofibrillogenesis is readily studied in
Xenopus embryos, where most skeletal muscle arises
from blocks of mesodermally derived somites running
along the flank that eventually contribute to the easilyimaged transparent tadpole tail. Somites form and
differentiate in a strict anterior-to-posterior sequence,
permitting observation of different stages of muscle
formation in a single embryo. Recently, a number of
Xenopus tropicalis mutations displaying a range of
developmental phenotypes [13-15] including defective
cardiac muscle formation [16] have been described.
In one of these mutations, dicky ticker (dit mh71 ),
embryos are completely paralyzed with no heartbeat.
Tail muscle shows decreased birefringence under polarized light, consistent with disruption of sarcomeric
structures. While the myofibrillogenesis program initiates and muscle myosin is detectable at early stages,
sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MyHC) staining
rapidly decreases. Disorganized sarcomeres bounded by
a-actinin-rich structures eventually form, but the transition from Z-bodies to Z-discs is delayed. In the first use

of the rapid gynogenesis-based positional cloning strategy developed by Khokha et al, [17] we show here that
the dit phenotype is caused by a missense mutation in
the myosin chaperone unc45b. These results not only
demonstrate a conserved role for this protein in vertebrate myofibrillogenesis, but also suggest a novel function for this chaperone in Z-disc formation, a key early
step in sarcomerogenesis.

Results
A Cys to Arg conversion in the UCS domain of unc45b
disrupts sarcomerogenesis in dit

Dit was first identified in a forward genetic screen for
Xenopus tropicalis developmental mutations [13].
Homozygous embryos lack a heartbeat (Additional File
1, Movie S1) and are completely paralysed even after
vigorous stimulation (Additional File 2, Movie S2),
developing cardiac edema and dying by ~stage 45.
When visualised under polarized light, dit somites
showed a marked reduction in birefringence compared
to wild type, suggesting disruption to the normal paracrystalline sarcomere structure (Additional File 3, Figure S1) consistent with defective muscle formation
rather than aberrant innervation or metabolism. Phalloidin staining of stage 42 tail muscle likewise showed
severe disruption to myofibrils (Additional File 3,
Figure S1).
The rapid gynogenetic mapping strategy described in
Khokha et al. [17] was used to place dit onto a chromosome and estimate a locus-centromere distance. Briefly,
dit and sibling wild type gynogenetic embryos were generated by ‘early coldshock’ suppression of polar body
formation in haploid embryos derived from heterozygous carrier females. Bulk segregant pools of mutant
and wild type gynogenotes were then assayed with centromeric SSLPs from the 10 X. tropicalis chromosomes
[17]. Linkage was detected to marker 016H09 near the
centromere of Chromosome 2/Linkage Group 6, but not
to other centromeres (Figure 1A). An estimate of the
mutation-centromere distance was obtained from the
fraction of phenotypically mutant embryos observed
(35%) in gynogenetic clutches, placing the locus ~15 cM
from the centromere using the formula assuming complete interference (cM) = 50(1 - (2 × fraction mutant
gynogenotes)) [18]. SSLPs from this region of the meiotic map as well as additional bespoke SSLPs and SNPs
from identified scaffolds were then used for high resolution mapping on embryos obtained from a conventional
cross of polymorphic heterozygous carriers. Analysis of
562 mutant embryos (1124 meioses) placed the mutant
locus in a 230 kb interval on scaffold_72 (scaffold_72:967475-1197607) (Figure 1B) containing 4 gene
models: ap2b1, pex12, aldh3a1, and the sarcomeric
myosin chaperone unc45b, whose loss-of-function

Page 2 of 8

phenotype in zebrafish closely resembles dit [9].
Sequence of unc45b from wild type and dit embryos
revealed a thymidine to cytidine transition at bp 2335 in
the coding sequence, converting Cys779 to Arg (Figure
1C). Conserved in both vertebrate and invertebrate
unc45b orthologs (Figure 1D), Cys779 is in the N-terminal UCS (Unc45 Cro1p She4p) domain important for
folding myosin in vitro [5,6]. Whole mount in situ
hybridization (WISH) of wild type embryos shows
unc45b is expressed throughout the somites and heart
at stage 28 (Figure 2A &2B), becoming further localised
to the jaw, branchial arches and body wall muscles by
stage 40 (Figure 2C &2D). The mutation in a conserved
cysteine residue, expression during muscle development,
and similarity of loss-of-function phenotypes in zebrafish combine to suggest unc45b may underlie the dit
phenotype.
Z-disc formation is delayed in dit

Myofibrillogenesis in dit was investigated further by
confocal microscopy. At stage 28, the earliest at which
dit can be identified, wild type and mutant embryos
were scored, genotyped, and their sarcomeric structures
analysed by immunohistochemistry. The oldest (most
anterior) somites of wild type sarcomeres showed
MyHC (detected by MHC A4.1025) integrating into
evenly spaced A-bands (Figure 3A). Dit embryos at this
early stage displayed MyHC staining in disorderly fibrillar structures at levels comparable to wild type siblings
(Figure 3B), in contrast with the negligible MyHC
immunoreactivity observed in zebrafish unc45b and
hsp90a mutants [9,10]. Headless myosin species retain
the capacity to form thick filaments [19], and it is
known that unc45b functions to prevent myosin aggregation [20]. The MyHC staining seen in dit during early
myofibrillogenesis may represent transient aggregates of
filament intermediates in which head domains remain
unfolded and are unable to integrate into the sarcomere.
We then evaluated Z-disc formation in dit embryos;
Z-disc defects were not described in the zebrafish chaperone mutants steif and sloth [9,10]. In stage 28 X. tropicalis tadpoles, wild type anterior sarcomeres had
formed discrete a-actinin-stained Z-disc structures (Figure 3C), while mutants lacked Z-discs but showed punctate staining consistent with a-actinin-rich Z-body
precursors (Figure 3D). Occasional stretches of regularly
spaced staining are seen consistent with the onset of
sarcomere formation (arrowhead) similar to the premyofibrils described by Sanger et al. [21]. In more posterior
somites, sarcomere formation is at an earlier stage. Figure 3E &2F show the border (arrows) between somites
15 and 16 in tails stained with a-actinin. In wild type
(Figure 3E), Z-discs are beginning to assemble into sarcomeres in the slightly older somite 15 (arrowhead, left)

were assayed for linkage to polymorphisms near the 10 X. tropicalis chromosomes. Clear linkage (*) was observed at Linkage Group 6
(Chromosome 2) (B) Linkage analysis using SSLP and SNP markers with 562 mutant embryos placed the dit locus in a 230 kb interval of
Scaffold_72 containing four gene models including unc45b. (C) cDNA sequence of dit unc45b revealed a thymidine to cytidine transition,

while in the adjacent somite 16 no Z-discs are seen. No
organized a-actinin staining is seen in mutant embryos
at these stages in somite 15-16 (Figure 3F).
MyHC is lost and Z-disc formation recovers in dit tadpoles

Later in development (stage 43), wild type sarcomeres are
organized into paracrystalline structures with MyHCstained A-bands, a-actinin-stained Z-discs, and titinpositive I-bands in register (Figure 4A, C, E). Dit tadpole
tails at this stage showed no organized MyHC fibrils (Figure 4B), and the level of immunoreactivity was significantly weaker than wild type, more closely resembling
the zebrafish myosin chaperone mutations [9,10]. Lower
MyHC protein levels in dit were confirmed by western
blots of stage 40 and 43 embryos using another pan-sarcomeric MyHC antibody, F59 (Additional File 4, Figure
S2). Sarcomeric MyHC proteins are subject to ubiquitinmediated degradation and autophagy [22-24], and it is
likely that the misfolded head domains in dit are actively
degraded. Interestingly, Z-discs (marked by both a-actinin and titin T12 antibodies) were present in dit tadpole
tails at these stages, although these were scattered and
severely out of register (Figure 4D &4F).
Depletion of unc45b phenocopies dit

To confirm that a deficit in unc45b function underpinned
the dit phenotype, we injected two non-overlapping

antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO) into wild
type embryos. Both a translation blocking (ATG-MO) and
a splice blocking AMO deleting ~2/3 of the mature protein (Splice-MO) resulted in highly significant numbers of
paralysed or partially paralysed tadpoles lacking heartbeat
(ATG-MO 42/49 (p < 0.01); Splice-MO 32/34 (P < 0.01),
compared to 0/52 in control AMO-injected embryos).
Confocal analysis revealed that both the ATG-MO and

embryos (right panels) for sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and Z-disc (a-actinin) immunoreactivity. (A, C) Anterior somites of stage 28
wild type embryos show sarcomeric myosin (MyHC) organized into A-bands separated by regularly spaced Z-discs (a-actinin). (B) Anterior dit
somites show disorganized MyHC staining, and (D) a-actinin staining is punctate, with occasional ordered Z-bodies consistent with the
appearance of incipient sarcomeres (arrowheads). (E) More posteriorly at st. 28, a-actinin staining shows wild type somites 15-16 (arrow indicates
intersomitic boundary) are beginning to organize Z-discs (arrowheads), while (F) dit somites at this level show only background staining (arrow
indicates intersomitic boundary). Scale bars 10 μm.

Splice-MO produced specific defects in sarcomere formation mirroring those in dit (Figure 5), with reductions in
sarcomeric MyHC staining and scattered a-actinin-rich
Z-disc-like structures. The similarity of the mutant phenotype to those produced by these two independent knockdown experiments is consistent with dit being a strong
hypomorph of unc45b.
Interestingly, WISH analysis shows that dit embryos
and unc45b antisense-MO injected embryos express
increased levels of unc45b mRNA relative to siblings or
control MO-injected controls developed in parallel (Figure 6). In zebrafish steif (unc45b) and sloth (hsp90a)
mutants, expression of the mutated genes is also upregulated [9,10]. The chaperone hsp90 regulates its own
expression by holding the transcription factor hsf1 in a
latent complex, which is released during heat shock or
pharmacological stress when unfolded proteins compete
for hsp90 binding [25-27]. The freed hsf1 in turn
directly upregulates hsp90 as well as other stress
response chaperones [28]. In the dit and steif mutants,
persisting unfolded myosin head domains could likewise
bind hsp90 and free a heat shock factor to increase chaperone transcription.

Discussion
While the organization of the mature sarcomere is well
understood, the order and mechanism of its assembly
remain under debate [1,29]. Our data strongly suggest
that Z-disc formation, a key early step in myofibrillogenesis, initially requires the presence of mature sarcomeric
MyHC proteins. This observation most closely supports
the premyofibril model proposed by Du et al. [30] in
which closely spaced a-actinin-rich Z-bodies are initially
separated by non-muscle myosin II; non-muscle myosin
II is then replaced by sarcomeric MyHC proteins as
these premyofibrils mature, coincident with Z-body
alignment and polymerization into Z-discs (reviewed by
Sanger et al. [29]). While closely spaced a-actininstained Z-bodies are observed in dit sarcomeres, lack of
mature sarcomeric MyHC replacement could be responsible for delay of polymerization of these into Z-discs,
and Z-disc alignment remains poor. Our data provide
less support for the model proposed by Holtzer et al.
[31], which hypothesizes that titin ‘stitches’ together aactinin rich I-Z-I bodies with already formed thick filaments to add sarcomere elements at the ends of Z-disc
containing striated myofibrils. This model does not

anticipate the presence of the regularly spaced premyofibril-like a-actinin-stained Z-body structures observed in
early dit sarcomeres. The molecular mechanism by
which sarcomeric MyHC might participate in Z-disc
maturation remains to be determined. While a direct
interaction seems unlikely, feedback to Z-bodies via correct MyHC interdigitation with thin filaments or even

contractile activity are also plausible explanations for
the requirement for correct MyHC head domain
maturation. Our data also do not rule out the possibility
that unc45b functions directly in Z-disc maturation on
an unknown protein target; indeed, unc45b protein is
known to localize to mature Z-discs in zebrafish [32].
Alternatively, incorrectly folded MyHC heads or

aggregates could interfere with Z-disc formation in the
mutant, with this block released following myosin
degradation.

Conclusions
The X. tropicalis dicky ticker mutant demonstrates a
conserved role for unc45b and sarcomeric myosin-specific chaperone function in tetrapod myofibrillogenesis,
extending previous phenotypic analysis in teleost fish. A
possible novel role for sarcomeric MyHC integration in
Z-disc maturation is suggested by the observed delay in
aggregation of a-actinin staining. Dicky ticker is the second X. tropicalis mutation to be cloned, and the first to
make use of the rapid gynogenesis-based mapping strategy. Analysis of myofibrillogenesis mutations in X. tropicalis, with its potential for combining genetics with
embryological and biochemical tools, promises additional insights into function and regulation of vertebrate
muscle assembly.
