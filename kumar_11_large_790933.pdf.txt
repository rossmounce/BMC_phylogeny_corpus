Large scale mitochondrial sequencing in Mexican
Americans suggests a reappraisal of Native
American origins

Abstract
Background: The Asian origin of Native Americans is largely accepted. However uncertainties persist regarding the
source population(s) within Asia, the divergence and arrival time(s) of the founder groups, the number of
expansion events, and migration routes into the New World. mtDNA data, presented over the past two decades,
have been used to suggest a single-migration model for which the Beringian land mass plays an important role.
Results: In our analysis of 568 mitochondrial genomes, the coalescent age estimates of shared roots between
Native American and Siberian-Asian lineages, calculated using two different mutation rates, are A4 (27.5 ± 6.8 kya/
22.7 ± 7.4 kya), C1 (21.4 ± 2.7 kya/16.4 ± 1.5 kya), C4 (21.0 ± 4.6 kya/20.0 ± 6.4 kya), and D4e1 (24.1 ± 9.0 kya/17.9
± 10.0 kya). The coalescent age estimates of pan-American haplogroups calculated using the same two mutation
rates (A2:19.5 ± 1.3 kya/16.1 ± 1.5 kya, B2:20.8 ± 2.0 kya/18.1 ± 2.4 kya, C1:21.4 ± 2.7 kya/16.4 ± 1.5 kya and D1:17.2
± 2.0 kya/14.9 ± 2.2 kya) and estimates of population expansions within America (~21-16 kya), support the preClovis occupation of the New World. The phylogeography of sublineages within American haplogroups A2, B2, D1
and the C1b, C1c andC1d subhaplogroups of C1 are complex and largely specific to geographical North, Central
and South America. However some sub-branches (B2b, C1b, C1c, C1d and D1f) already existed in American
founder haplogroups before expansion into the America.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that Native American founders diverged from their Siberian-Asian progenitors
sometime during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and expanded into America soon after the LGM peak (~20-16
kya). The phylogeography of haplogroup C1 suggest that this American founder haplogroup differentiated in
Siberia-Asia. The situation is less clear for haplogroup B2, however haplogroups A2 and D1 may have differentiated
soon after the Native American founders divergence. A moderate population bottle neck in American founder
populations just before the expansion most plausibly resulted in few founder types in America. The similar
estimates of the diversity indices and Bayesian skyline analysis in North America, Central America and South
America suggest almost simultaneous (~ 2.0 ky from South to North America) colonization of these geographical
regions with rapid population expansion differentiating into more or less regional branches across the panAmerican haplogroups.

Background
Archeological, anatomical, linguistic, and genetic evidence have collectively shown that the original human
inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere most likely
arrived from Asia across an exposed land mass between
northeastern Siberia and Alaska, referred to as Beringia,

during the last glacial maximum (LGM) approximately
23 to 19 thousand years ago (kya) [1-6]. However,
despite the general consensus of an Asian origin for
Native Americans, a number of uncertainties persist
regarding the dynamic nature of the peopling of the
Americas, including the ancestral source population(s)
within Asia, the arrival time(s) of the founder groups,
the number of expansion events, and the specific migration routes into the New World [2,7-15].

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data presented over the
past two decades have shown that Native American
populations exhibit, almost exclusively, five mtDNA
haplogroups (A-D and X) [6] classified in the autochthonous American lineages A2, B2, C1, D1, and X2a [16].
Haplogroups A - D are found throughout the New
World and are frequent in Asia, supporting a northeastern Asian origin of these lineages [17,18]. The panAmerican distribution of haplogroups A2, B2, C1 and
D1, along with their similar levels of diversity and estimates for coalescence time, has been used to support a
single-migration model [19-22]. Nested within this
model, the Beringian land mass has been suggested to
play an important role as a region where ancestral
populations crossed and perhaps settled prior to their
eventual expansion into the Americas, leading to the
diversification of the New World founding lineages
[23-26]. The evolutionary history of the fifth founder
lineage, X2a, remains elusive and highly debated, with
some scholars arguing for an additional migration event
into the New World to account for the X lineage, one
that was independent from the founder populations
responsible for introducing the pan-American haplogroups [27,28].
The “Beringian incubation model” (BIM) [23] and its
variants [21,25,26] emphasize that the Native American
founder population reached greater Beringia by 30 kya,
marked by the earliest evidence of human habitation in
northeastern Siberia Yana Rhinoceros Horn Site [29].
According to these models, the founder populations
remained in Beringian LGM refugium for about 5-15
kya, ecologically isolated to the west and physically isolated to the east by the glaciers that are believed to have
effectively blocked the way to America until near the
end of the LGM [24]. During this time, mtDNA lineages
of American founders are likely to have differentiated
from their Asian precursors. As the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets retreated, the paused populations
rapidly colonized the double continent around 14-16
kya, resulting in largely autochthonous patterns of variation within the continental founder haplogroups
[23,25,26].
However, the timing of this peopling scenario has
been questioned due to the existence of pre-Clovis
archaeological sites, such as the Monte Verde site in
southern South America that dates human habitation
by at least 14.5 kya [30], as well as demographic models based on mtDNA variation that indicate pronounced growth of Native American founder
populations starting at ~19 to18 kya [24], thus marking
the effective colonization of the New World prior to
the opening of the ice free corridors in North America.
To accommodate these dates, an alternate early coastal
route has been suggested for the initial colonization of

Page 2 of 17

the Americas, which would have been largely ice free
at ~19 kya [24,31-33].
In northeastern Siberia, the putative origin of the
Native American founder populations, there is archaeological evidence for human presence as early as 30 kya
[29]. The estimated dates of the Beringian ‘pause’, (ranging from 5 to 15 thousand years) [23,24,26] and its
potential role as a time when American founders
diverged from their Siberian-Asian/Asian ancestors
represent interesting avenues for microevolutionary
reconstruction. Furthermore, the proposition for a Beringian pause [23,24,26] is largely based on the assumption that the American founder haplogroups
differentiated during the Beringian pause/isolation. Several related issues remain to be addressed. First, despite
the fact that much of interior Beringia remains in contemporary Alaska and northeast Siberia, no archaeological evidence of this population in residence has been
found [34]. Second, a resident, presumably stable and
possibly growing, population in Beringia seems an unlikely candidate for reduced genetic diversity in American
founders as a result of founder effect. Third, while
Chukchi and Siberian Eskimos share mtDNA lineages
with Alaskan Eskimos, Aleuts and other Native North
Americans [9,35], this sharing falls almost exclusively
under haplogroups A2 and D2. The restricted genetic
variation observed among these populations (only haplogroups A and D) seems inconsistent as a source area
for the more extensive genetic variation observed in the
rest of the Americas. Furthermore, the presence of haplogroup D2 in the Beringians is attributed to a second
expansion from southern Siberia [36-39] and A2 is limited in diversity in Beringia [35,38].
In this study, we analyzed 568 mitochondrial genomes
(of which 215 are newly sequenced from a Mexican
American population) belonging to four pan-Native
American (A2, B2, C1 and D1) lineages and A2a, A2b,
A4b, C1a, C4 and D4e1 sister clades from Siberia-Asia,
to better understand the underlying processes of the
diversification of the Native American founders from
their Asian counterparts and their expansion into the
New World.

Results
Maternal legacy of Mexican Americans

Mexicans are, by and large, descendants of Native
American and European (Spanish) ancestors [40]. Historical accounts also document African slavery in Mexico during the 16th-18th centuries [41-43], another
source of admixture in the Mexican population. The
admixture estimates compiled by Lisker et al. [44] using
data derived from classical genetic systems reported in
previous studies in Mexico [45-52] identified African
and/or European genetic variation in all Mexican

regions and groups analyzed. For mtDNA variation,
some studies have measured Native American, European
and African contributions to Mexican and Mexican
American populations, revealing 85 to 90% of mtDNA
lineages are of Native American origin [53,54], with the
remainder having European (5-7%) or African ancestry
(3-5%) [54]. Thus the observed frequency of Native
American mtDNA in Mexican/Mexican Americans is
higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of Native American admixture for these populations i.e. ~ 30-46% [53,55]. The difference is indicative
of directional mating involving preferentially immigrant
men and Native American women. This type of genetic
asymmetry has been observed in other populations,
including Brazilian individuals of African ancestry, as
the analysis of sex specific and autosomal markers has
revealed evidence for substantial European admixture
that was mediated mostly through men [56]. In our 384
completely sequenced Mexican American mitochondrial
genomes, 12 (3.1%) are of African ancestry belonging to
haplogroups L0a1a’3’, L2a1, L3b, L3d and U6a7; 52
(13.6%) belong to European haplogroups HV, JT, U1,
U4, U5; and K and the majority (320, 83.3%) are of
Native American ancestry, which is very similar to previous reports [53,54].
After removing the related individuals from our
maternal lines and those of European or African descent, 215 newly sequenced unrelated mtDNA genomes
of Native American ancestry were identified for founder
haplogroups A2, B2, C1, D1 and D4e1c (new sister lineage of D2 found in Mexican Americans). These complete mtDNA sequences were analyzed together with
353 previously published sequences belonging to the
four primary Native American founder haplogroups A2,
B2, C1 and D1 and their Asian sister clades (A4, C4 and
D4e; see additional file 1 for details).
Phylogenetic reconstructions and coalescent age
estimates

The phylogenetic reconstruction and coalescent age estimates of the aforesaid 568 mitochondrial genomes is
presented in additional file 2 (panels A-D) and summarized in Figure 1, Figure 2 and table 1.
Haplogroup ‘A2’ and its sister clades

A total of 134 American sequences (49 published earlier
and 85 from this study) belonging to pan-American
haplogroup A2, form 42 distinct haplotypes, one nested
within the Beringian subtype A2a and the other 41 largely autochthonous to geographical North, Central and
South America, except Central American which shares a
few branches with both North and South Americans. 12
of these 41 haplotypes were previously labeled A2c
through A2q [57]. However, based on our phylogenetic
reconstruction of the haplotypes, we changed the

Page 3 of 17

previously reported definitions of A2e, A2f and A2n.
Clade A2e is now defined by only one substitution at
(13708), A2f sequences share a back mutation at np
153, and A2n has a back mutation at 16111 (but not at
153), although it should be noted that the control region
mutations are recurrent. The other new haplotypes with
three or more sequences have been labeled A2r through
A2w.
Of the two Beringian specific branches (A2a and A2b),
A2a is the only sublineage shared by the Chukchi, Siberian and North American Eskimos, Aleuts, and Na-Dene
populations. The A2a and A2b sublineages might have
diverged from the rest of the American subtypes sometime between 17 to 9 kya, as suggested by the founder
coalescent ages of A2a and A2b and the coalescent age
of haplogroup A2 calculated using the mutation rates of
Mishmar et al. [58] and Soares et al. [59]. The coalescent age of haplogroup A2 calculated using these two
mutation rates over America specific lineages (19.5 ±
1.3 kya/16.1 ± 1.5 kya) indicates its early expansion into
America. The haplogroup A2 shares the root A4 with
the Siberia-Asia specific sister clades A4a, A4b and A4c.
The coalescent age estimate of A4, as per mutation
rates of Mishmar et al. [58] and Soares et al. [59], are
27.5 ± 6.8 kya and 22.7 ± 7.4 kya respectively.
Haplogroup ‘B2’

The phylogeny of haplogroup B2 reveals a total of 36
haplotypes, with 9 previously defined subhaplogroups
named B2a through B2i [57], and two new lineages, B2j
and B2k, defined here by control region substitutions at
16278 and 152, respectively. The remaining haplotypes
were not classified because they consist of only two or
fewer representative sequences. Similar to the other pan
American haplogroups, sublineages within the B2 haplogroup are specific to geographical regions (North,
Central and South America). Only a few branches harbor sequences across geographical regions. The sub
branch B2b by virtue of its early differentiation (coalescent age 23.1 ± 4.8 kya/16.8 ± 4.9 kya calculated as per
[58] and [59] respectively) encompasses the North, Central and South America. The coalescent age estimates of
B2 calculated as per [58] and [59] mutation rates are
20.8 ± 2.0 kya and 18.1 ± 2.4 kya respectively. The haplogroup B2 lacks any known immediate sister/ancestral
clades in Siberia other then the B4b1 in South East Asia.
Haplogroup ‘C1’ and ‘C4’

The C root is represented by two lineages in America:
the pan American haplogroup C1; and the recently identified subhaplogroup ‘C4c’, found in only two sequences,
an Ijka sample from South America [23] and a Shuswap
speaker from North America [60]. The C4c subhaplogroup shares root C4 with two wide spread lineages
in Siberia-Asia, subhaplogroup C4a (coalescent age 25.7
± 7.4 kya/21.6 ± 8.3 kya calculated as per [58] and [59]

respectively) and C4b (coalescent age 9.3 ± 2.2 kya/6.8 ±
2.8 kya calculated as per [58] and [59] respectively). The
coalescence age estimates of the C4c (20.6 ± 7.3 kya/
11.8 ± 6.8 kya calculated as per [58] and [59] respectively) are based on only two known sequences and are
therefore not very reliable; coalescent age of root C4
(21.0 ± 4.6 kya/20.0 ± 6.4 calculated as per [58] and
[59] respectively) suggest its early differentiation.
In the case of the more abundant and widely distributed haplogroup C1, three basal branches are ubiquitous
in the Americas (C1b, C1c and C1d), and spread across
the three major geographic regions. The fourth branch,
C1a, is found in Siberian and East Asian populations.
The C1c branch exhibits an older coalescent age of 22.2
± 3.3 kya/21.3 ± 4.3 kya (calculated as per [58] and [59]
respectively), harboring sublineages (e.g., C1c3) that are
spread across the three major geographical regions. The
coalescent age of C1b is estimated to be 17.9 ± 2.3kya/
18.4 ± 3.1kya (calculated as per [58] and [59] respectively) and for C1d, it is 20.1 ± 4.4 kya/13.5 ± 1.7 kya
(calculated as per [58] and [59] respectively). The

estimated coalescent age of Siberian branch C1a is 7.7 ±
3.2 kya/1.9 ± 1.9 kya (calculated as per [58] and [59]
respectively) which is considerably younger. However its
founder age is estimated to be 18.0 ± 7.9 kya/10.2 ± 8.1
kya which is comparable to the American branches
(after allowing for standard error). The estimated coalescent ages of the roots for C4 (21.0 ± 4.6 kya/20.0 ± 6.4)
and C1 (21.4 ± 2.7 kya/16.4 ± 1.5) calculated as per
mutation rates of Mishmar et al. [58] and Soares et al.
[59], along with their subclades C4a and C1c, respectively, indicate that these Native American clusters
diverged from Siberian-Asian sister clades sometime
during the LGM peak.
Haplogroup ‘D1’, ‘D4e’and ‘D4h’

The phylogenetic reconstruction of 19 new and 60 published mitochondrial genomes from America and
Siberia-Asia reveals that haplogroup ‘D’ is represented
by at least three branches in America. The D1 haplogroup is found in high frequency throughout the
Americas. D4h3a is rare but also widely distributed. We
identified two Mexican American sequences belonging

Kumar et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:293
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/293

to a new sub branch named D4e1c, defined by the substitutions 14207 and 16092. This new branch has been
defined in our tree based on the only two sequences,
but an exception was made due to its phylogenetic
importance. The D4e1c shares the root D4e1 (substitutions 3316 and 9536) with D2, which is a diverse lineage
found from southern Siberia to Beringia [9,37,38,61-63]
and D4e1a found in Japan [64]. Since D4e1c has only
two known sequences, coalescent age estimates are not
reliable. However coalescent age estimates of D4e1 24.1
± 9.0 kya/17.9 ± 10.0 kya (calculated as per [58] and
[59] respectively) suggests early divergence of D4e1c
from its sister clades Siberian/Beringian D2 and Japanese D4e1a. The phylogeny of D1 reveals 25 haplotypes,
all more or less autochthonous to respective geographical regions except sub branch D1f which harbors genomes from North, Central and South America. Based on
its phylogeography and coalescent age (19.3 ± 5.9 kya/
13.8 ± 5.9kya), D1f appears to have differentiated early.
The overall coalescent age of D1 haplogroup is 17.2 ±
2.0 kya/14.9 ± 2.2 kya (calculated as per [58] and [59]
respectively).
We did not find sequences belonging to rare haplogroup X2a in our sample, whereas the other rare haplogroup D4h3 is represented by only one sequence. A
recent study [28], based on 22 X2a and 46 D4h3 complete mtDNA sequences concluded that although the
coding region divergence of these haplogroups shows
considerable overlap, their phylogeography in America
is strikingly different. The haplogroup D4h3 is found
along the Pacific coast; whereas X2a is restricted to
northern North America and hence envisaged two different paths of arrival. The haplogroup D4h3 followed
the Pacific coastal path just like other pan American
haplogroups, whereas X2a might have arrived from Beringia through a path represented by the ice free corridor
between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets [28].
We concentrated our further analysis on A2, B2, C1,
C4c, D4e1c and D1 American haplogroups and their
Siberian/Asian sister clades.
Diversity indices and neutrality tests

Since we were interested in detecting the genetic consequences of demographic events that occurred during and
after the peopling of the double continent, we computed
nucleotide diversity and different estimators of the parameter θ = 2 Neμ to compare the amount of within population variability in Beringia, North America, Central
America and South America. Also, in order to investigate
the possibility of later expansions/migrations of Native
American populations as suggested previously [28,65], we
also performed the analysis by categorizing the Native
American samples with respect to the four pan American
haplogroups in the respective geographic regions.

Page 7 of 17

The similar estimates of nucleotide diversity and θπ in
North America (0.001747, 27.0), Central America
(0.001735, 26.8) and South America (0.001834, 28.3)
and the significantly negative value of Tajima’s D and
Fu’s Fs (Table 2) suggest almost simultaneous (over a
period of approximately 2.0 ky from South to North
America) colonization of the three geographical regions,
with rapid population expansion differentiating into
more or less regional branches across the haplogroups
(Figure 1 and 2). However the comparatively higher
value of θk (1338.1 and 917.5) and significantly negative
Fu’s Fs (-24.0, p = 0.000 and -23.8, p = 0.004) in North
and Central America, respectively, may also suggest an
excess of rare alleles/haplotypes. The value of θk (413.5)
in South America is comparatively low when compared
to North and Central America.
The low values of diversity indices (nucleotide diversity = 0.000959; θπ = 14.8) and non-significantly negative values of both neutrality tests (Tejima’s D = 1.02;
Fu’s Fs = 0.448) in Beringia suggest very different demographic patterns to that of Native Americans. The analysis of within haplogroups diversity in the respective
geographic region (Table 2), though not significantly different when considered with standard deviation, shows
two contrasting patterns of distribution i.e. nucleotide
diversity and θπ levels for A2 and B2 haplogroups that
are highest in North America, followed by South America and the lowest observed for Central America. In
contrast, haplogroups C1 and D1 show a cline from
South America to North America. As evident in the few
shared branches across geographical region (Figure 1
and 2), the recent gene flow from the North and South
might have resulted in the low diversity indices and
higher values of θk in the Central American populations.
The high values of diversity indices (nucleotide diversity
= 0.000615 and θπ = 9.5) along with high θk (415.4) and
highly significant negative Fu’s Fs (-21.7, p = 0.00) of
haplogroup A2 in North America may indicate a secondary expansion of the A2 haplogroup following the
path represented by the ice free corridor between the
Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. A similar path for
the expansion of haplogroup X2a in America has been
suggested previously [28].
Bayesian skyline plot analysis

The above results suggest a complex demographic history associated with the colonization of the three geographic regions and of the Americas as a whole. We
used Bayesian skyline plot analysis [66] to visually illustrate the change in effective population size in Beringia
and three geographical regions of America. In this analysis, N e τ (where N e is the population of breeding
females and τ is the generation length) is unaffected by
the different proposals for the actual number of founder

show that Beringian populations (Chukchi and Eskimos
including the Aleutian Islands) suffered a gradual population decline following their divergence from Native
Americans and Siberian ancestors (~15-10 kya) and are
establishing moderate growth ~2.5 kya. In contrast, a
pronounced population growth starting ~21 kya (95%

observed. As reported earlier [24], each region in our
analysis identifies a moderate population bottle neck
just before the manifold rapid growth, which probably
suggests a time frame of Native American founder’s

into America.

Discussion
Our analysis of a large data set of 568 mitochondrial
genomes (215 this study and 353 from published
sources; see additional file 1 for details) from North,
Central and South America, as well as Beringia and
Siberia-Asia shows that the coalescent age estimates of
shared roots calculated as per the mutation rates of Mishmar et al. [58] and Soares et al. [59] between SiberianAsian and Native American lineages i.e. A4 (27.5 ± 6.8
kya/22.7 ± 7.4 kya), C1 (21.4 ± 2.7 kya/16.4 ± 1.5 kya),
C4 (21.0 ± 4.6 kya/20.0 ± 6.4 kya), and D4e1 (24.1 ± 9.0
kya/17.9 ± 10.0 kya) average around LGM when considered together with their standard deviations (Figure 4

panel A and B). These coalescent estimates along with
the phylogeography of pan American haplogroups and
Siberian-Asian sister clades strongly suggest that American founders diverged from their Siberian-Asian progenitors sometime during LGM. It is most likely that
the hostile conditions during the LGM (centered at
~21.0 kya and extending from at least 23.0 to 19.0 kya)
[67], caused by extensive glaciations, with a large ice
lobe extending eastwards across northern Siberia [68,69]
might have forced some populations back into southern
Siberian LGM refuge, plausibly in Altai-Sayan and/or
mid-lower Amur region [35,38] and the American founders to the east into Beringia. A swift expansion further
south into the American continent occurred right after
the LGM [24,65], most plausibly around 20-16 kya (Figure 4 panel A and B), as suggested by the coalescent age
estimates of pan American haplogroups (A2:19.5 ± 1.3

14.9 ± 2.2 kya) calculated as per the mutation rates of
Mishmar et al. [58] and Soares et al. [59] and estimates
of populations expansions using Bayesian Skyline
approach (Figure 3 panels A-C). The estimated average
time difference between the divergence of Native Americans from their Siberian-Asian precursors and the
expansion of founding population into America is less
than 5.0 ky irrespective of the mutation rate used (Figure 4 panel A-C). The hostile conditions during LGM
are also evident in the compilation of the records of fossil woody material or other plant macrofossils across
northern Siberia i.e. records become progressively rarer
right after 25 kya and then are absent completely for
several thousand years in the period that includes the
LGM [70,71]. Given that the opening of the ice free corridor is dated not earlier than ~14 kya, a coastal (Pacific) route would have been the only option for initial
expansion [24,31-33]. Our data also show that the
expansion of pan American haplogroups within the double continent is far more complex, contrary to the uniformity assumed by the BIM models and its variants
[23-26]. The earliest expansion observed in the population reaching South America support the pre-Clovis
occupation of the New World via the coastal route right
after LGM. The expansion in North America occurred
after the LGM (~19 kya) indicating a still prevailing
LGM condition in the north. These expansions, separated by time and space and perhaps involving pan
American lineages differentially, are responsible for a
complex pattern of mtDNA diversity within the haplogroups A2, B2, C1, and D1 in the three geographical
regions of America. Some intra-haplogroup variation, at
least differentiation of sub branches B2b, C1b, C1c, C1d
and D1f, already existed in American founders before
expansion into the Americas. The population bottleneck,
also reported previously [24], though moderate during
this period (LGM) and a many fold rapid expansion
right after LGM (~19 kya) perhaps better explains the
few founder types in America.
The phylogeography and diversity within haplogroup
C1 shows a cline south to north in America. However
C1 is subdivided in the three pan American braches
(C1b, C1c, C1d) [23,24,65,72] and a Siberian-Asian
representative C1a [38,62,64,73]. The subhaplogroup
C1a, which shares root substitutions with American sub
branches (C1b, C1c and C1d), is found in Japan [64]
and southern Siberia [38,62,73]. Finding C1a in America
or Beringia could help to explain the presence of C1a in
Siberia-Asia as a result of a back migration from Beringia or America, a scenario enforced in BIM by Tamm et
al. [23] to explain origin of haplogroup C1 in Beringia
and its phylogeography. Yet, to date this has not been

Page 11 of 17

achieved even after large sampling from this area
[23,24,28,37-39,58,60-62,65,72-76]. Therefore, one still
cannot rule out the most parsimonious scenario that
haplogroup C1 originated in Siberia-Asia [38,62]. It is
also worth noting that even though C1a is found across
diverse populations in Siberia-Asia, it is rare; whereas
C1, which differentiated into C1b, C1c and C1d, is
found in high frequency in America, and its phylogeography and coalescent age in America is very similar to
the other pan American haplogroups (A2, B2 and D1)
[23,24,65]. Therefore disappearing C1a from the expanding population in America appears unlikely given that it
would require disappearance of a lineage from an
expanding population in an unpopulated territory, a
demographic situation in which loss of lineage due to
genetic drift is minimized [77]. Furthermore back migration of only C1a from Beringia to Siberia-Asia as suggested in BIM by Tamm et al. [23], when all the pan
American haplogroup existed in a stable, plausibly
expanding population in Beringia seems less
parsimonious.
In addition to C1, another founder lineage ‘C4c’ has
been defined recently in Native Americans [23,60],
which shares root ‘C4’ with the diverse Siberian-Asian
sister clades C4a and C4b. The coalescent age estimates
of C1 (21.4 ± 2.7 kya/16.4 ± 1.5 kya) and C4 (20.7 ± 4.3
kya/20.0 ± 6.4 kya) calculated as per [58] and [59]
further support a recent divergence of American founders from their Siberian-Asian progenitors.

America and Beringia, has been used to suggest its insitu origin in American founders plausibly in the Beringian-Alaskan region [38]. However this diversity is
restricted to only two branches (A2a and A2b) in Beringia. Therefore differentiation of its precursor in SiberiaAsia or soon after the divergence of Native American
founders from their Siberian-Asian precursor cannot be
ruled out. The time window for such differentiation
would have been any time between the age of its shared
root A4 (27.5 ± 6.8 kya/22.7 ± 7.4 kya calculated as per
[58] and [59] respectively) with Siberian-Asian sister
clades (A4a, A4b, A4c) and its own American coalescent
age (19.5 ± 1.3 kya/16.4 ± 1.5 kya calculated as per [58]
and [59] respectively), or more plausibly ~21-19 kya
marked by the first expansion of modern human into
America [24,65]. The diversity distribution along with
demographic parameter also indicates that there could
be more than one expansion of A2 in North America
plausibly following two different paths, one Pacific
coastal path just like the other pan American haplogroups and another path represented by the ice free
corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice

sheets, similar to X2a [28,65]. The environmental and
paleoecological data, indicates that such a path existed
and was represented by the ice-free corridor between
the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets, which opened
approximately 15 kya [78] or possibly was never completely closed [79]. Through such a corridor, small glacial-refuge areas have been recently identified [80].
The phylogeography and within haplogroup diversity
of haplogroup B2 is very similar to haplogroup A2 and
supports a major expansion from North America to
South America. So far haplogroup B2 lacks any known
immediate sister/ancestral clades in Siberia other then
the B4b1 in South East Asia, and it remains unclear
whether the B2, dating to 20.8 ± 2.0 kya/18.1 ± 2.4 kya,
has evolved in situ in American founders after their
divergence from Siberian-Asian ancestors or SiberiaAsia itself.
The D4 clusters coalescent age (28.3 ± 4.4 kya/24.8 ±
7.9 kya calculated as per [58] and [59] respectively),
represents the divergence age of its sub branches, D1
found only in America and D4e1 and D4h3 having distributed from Asia to America, suggest a more complex
process of differentiation. The within haplogroup diversity of haplogroup D1 showing a cline south to north in
America and having at least one sub branch ‘D1f’,
already differentiated before the expansion and numerous later regional sub branches strongly suggest its early
differentiation and a sizable population with basal D1
prior to expansion into America. Contrary to the
absence of any known progenitor in Siberia-Asia, a
Siberian-Asian origin of D1 cannot be ruled out [35,62].
The D4e1 is represented by Japanese branch D4e1a in
Asia [64], D2 in Siberia/Beringia and by our newly discovered D4e1c branch in America. D2 constitutes two
different clusters with contrasting geographic distribution. The cluster D2a is found in high frequency among
Chukchi, Aleuts, and Eskimos [36-39,61-63], whereas
the second cluster D2b is reported in Buryat, Khamnigan and Yakut populations [38]. The phylogeography of
D2 and the coalescent age estimate (14.6 ± 6.3 kya/10.9
± 7.1 kya calculated as per [58] and [59] respectively)
may suggest its Southern Siberian origin and later
expansion to Beringia. But American clade D4e1c,
though rare, known by only two sequences from our
current work, diverge from the root D4e1 and the coalescent age of D4e1 (24.1 ± 9.0 kya/17.9 ± 10.0 kya calculated as per [58] and [59] respectively), strongly
suggest that D4e1c was the part of initial colonization of
Americas.

diverged from their Siberian-Asian progenitors sometime during LGM and expanded into America soon
after the LGM peak (~20-16 kya). Further, time between
the Native American divergence from Siberian-Asians to
the expansion into America was shorter than the previous estimates. The phylogeography of haplogroup C1
suggest that this American founder haplogroup differentiated in Siberia-Asia. Although it is not clear for the
haplogroup B2, haplogroups A2 and D1 might have differentiated soon after the Native American founder’s
divergence. A moderate population bottle neck in American founder populations just before the expansion (Figure 3) most plausibly resulted in few founder types in
America. The similar estimates of the diversity indices
and Bayesian skyline analysis in North America, Central
America and South America suggest almost simultaneous (over a period of approximately 2.0 ky from
South to North America) colonization of these geographical regions with rapid population expansion differentiating into more or less regional branches across the
pan American haplogroups A2, B2, D1 and the C1b,
C1c, C1d subhaplogroups of C1. However, some sub
branches (B2b, C1b, C1c, C1d and D1f) already existed
in American founder haplogroups before expansion into
the Americas.

Conclusions
Our analysis of a data set of 568 mitochondrial genomes
from North, Central and South America, as well as Beringia and Siberia-Asia suggest that American founders

Population samples

Methods
There have been considerable advances in the understanding of Native American mtDNA phylogeography
and the peopling processes of the American continent
in recent years; however this has been based largely on
mitochondrial genomes sampled from North and South
American populations, with very few coming from
southern North America and Central America
[23,24,58,65,74-76]. Therefore, in order to address this
insufficiency, we have completely sequenced mtDNA of
384 Mexican American maternal lines from our San
Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS). Most Mexican
Americans are the descendants of the Indigenous peoples of Mexico and/or Europeans [40], especially Spaniards and Mexico is considered as the southern tip of
North America in general. Considering the pre-modern
societies such as the Maya, who thrived in one cultural
sphere that spread from El Salvador, Cozumel and Central Mexico, and into Veracruz, Honduras and Guatemala [81]; we consider our population sample has
strong ethnic ties to Central America and therefore for
the analysis combined with very few Central American
mitochondrial genomes published previously.

Mexican Americans account for more than 12.5% of the
United States’ population: 30.7 million Americans listed
their ancestry as Mexican as of 2008, forming about

Kumar et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:293
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/293

64% of all Hispanics and Latinos in the United States
[82,83].
We have sampled 1, 236 Mexican American individuals organized into 42 extended families from the
SAFHS [84]. From these extended pedigrees we selected
384 pedigree founders, representing all maternal lines in
the family sample, for complete mtDNA sequencing. All
participants gave informed consent and all protocols
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (San Antonio, TX).
As reported previously [53,54] and also observed in our
study, mtDNA sequence showed some of the Mexican
American individuals were of European and African
ancestry due to recent admixture in historic times. Additionally, some of the founder individuals sequenced were
related (from the same maternal line: based on our pedigree information). To focus our analyses, we removed all
such genomes from this study and analyzed our 215 newly
sequenced unrelated mitochondrial genomes belonging to
Native American ancestry along with 353 from published
source belonging to Native American haplogroups (A2,
B2, C1 and D1) and their Asian sister clades (A4, C4 and
D4e) [23,24,38,58,60-62,64,65,72-76,85]. The mtDNA
sequences of Herrnstadt et al. [75] and Kivisild et al. [76]
lack control region information. The 63 published source
genomes [72], which were sequenced selectively for subhaplogroup C1d, were excluded from diversity and Bayesian
skyline analysis because preselected sequences of single
subhaplogroup would have skewed the results of these
demographic parameters. See additional file 1 for more
details on the mtDNA sequences used in this study.
Molecular analysis

The DNA was extracted from collected white blood cell
from 10 ml blood samples using standard phenolchloroform methods [86] with minor modifications. For
complete mtDNA resequencing we used the mitoSEQr™ kit (Applied Biosystems) designed to amplify
human mitochondrial DNA in 46 fragments using universal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions.
However we had mixed success with some of the fragments, so the resequencing of such regions of the genome was completed using alternate PCR primers and
conditions of Rieder et al. [87]. Successful PCR amplification was verified on 1% ethidium bromide stained
agarose gels, and purified using ExoSap-IT to remove
excess primers and deoxynucleotide triphosphates (GE
Healthcare). The amplicons were then used as templates
in cycle sequencing reactions using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit
(Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The cycle sequencing products were purified using BigDye XTerminator Purification Kit (Applied

Page 13 of 17

Biosystems) to remove unincorporated BigDye and primer and then analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 3730
DNA Analyzer. Both strands were sequenced to promote resolution of polymorphisms. Applied Biosystems
supplied DNA Sequencing Analysis Software version
5.1.1 was used for first pass base calling quality assessment. Comprehensive contig assembly and sequence
alignment was performed in SeqScape Software version
2.6 (Applied Biosystems). Mutations were scored relative
to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS)
[88] with each deviation confirmed by manual checking
of electropherograms. All (n = 215) mtDNA complete
genome sequences used in this study have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers HQ012049HQ012263).
Statistical analysis
Phylogeny reconstruction and age estimation

Besides our newly sequenced 215 unrelated mitochondrial genomes of Native American ancestry, 353 additional published sequences belonging to Native American
haplogroups (A2, B2, C1 and D1) and their SiberianAsian sister clades (A4, C4 and D4e) as detailed in additional file 1 were employed for tree reconstruction. The
phylogenetic trees of each of the pan American mtDNA
haplogroups and their sister clades were reconstructed
from median joining networks rooted to L3, using NETWORK 4.2.0.1 software [89]. The trees were checked
manually to resolve homoplasies. Since we lack control
region information for previously published sequences of
Herrnstadt et al. [75] and Kivisild et al. [76], we used
slow evolving coding region information for coalescent
age estimates. The coalescent age estimates were calculated by Rho (r) statistics [90] and three different mutation rates: (i) one base substitution (i.e. one mutation
other than indel) in the coding region (577 - 16023) per
5, 140 years [58]; (ii) one synonymous transition per 6,
764 year [76]; and (iii) calibrated mutation rate of [59]
based on all synonymous substitutions. All of these
mutation rates are calibrated on the basis of an assumed
human-chimp split. Standard errors for coalescence estimates were calculated as per Saillard et al. [90]. The coalescent age estimates using the three aforesaid mutation
rates are presented in table 1. It has been observed in our
analysis and previously [23] that coalescent estimates
based on the effectively faster rate of Kivisild et al. [76],
yields younger age for most Native American haplogroups than the well documented archaeological date
of modern human occupation at Monte Verde site in
southern South America [30]. The mutation rates of Mishmar et al. [58] and Soares et al. [59] yielded higher and
similar coalescent ages which fit well with the archaeological estimates of modern human occupation at Monte
Verde site in southern South America [30]. Therefore, we

Kumar et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:293
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/293

largely based our inferences on the coalescent age estimates of these two mutation rates.

genealogies and model parameters were sampled at
every 1000 iterations thereafter.

Diversity indices and neutrality tests

We computed nucleotide diversity and different estimators of the parameter θ = 2 Neμ to compare the amount
of within population variability in Beringia, North
America, Central America and South America: (1) θ k
[91], based on the number of observed alleles (k), (2) θS
[92], based on the number of observed segregating sites
(S), and (3) θπ [93], based on the mean number of pairwise differences between sequences (π). We used Tajima’s D [94] and Fu’s Fs [95] statistics to investigate
population expansion events. To investigate any event of
second expansion/migration affecting or involving haplogroups differentially, we also performed the analysis by
categorizing the Native American samples with respect
to four pan American haplogroups in the respective
geographic regions. The aforesaid diversity indices and
neutrality test were performed on the slow evolving
mtDNA coding region (position 577-16023) using the
software package ARLEQUIN version 3.1 [96].
Bayesian skyline plot analysis

We used Bayesian skyline model of effective population
size [66] to visually illustrate the demographic history of
Beringian and Native American populations from the
Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA). Effective
population size is a compound population genetic parameter generally considered linearly proportional to census population size, the population of breeding females
in this analysis. It is influenced by many factors, including local extinction, re-colonization and various forms
of nonrandom mating [97]. The model assumes regional
isolation and no phylogenetic structure priori, such as
the existence of haplogroups or the number of founding
haplotypes. Estimates of effective populations over time
for geographic regions Beringia (n = 66), North America
(n = 75), Central America (n = 151; randomly selected
from 215 to overcome computation limitation in
BEAST), and South America (n = 76), were derived
from coding region mtDNA sequences. We considered
Chukchi and Eskimos sampled from Siberia, and Aleuts
sampled from Commander Island as the representative
Beringian populations in this analysis. The analysis was
carried out assuming HKY+G model and a log-normal
relaxed clock [98] with the standard substitution rate of
1.26 × 10 8 sites per year [58] using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) [99] sampling with 10 groups (m
= 10). The software packages BEAST v1.4.8 [100] and
Tracer v1.4.1 [101] used in this analysis are available
from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/. The plots were obtained
using a stepwise (constant) model. The analysis was run
for 30 million iterations for Beringia, North and South
America and 40 million iterations for Central America
with the first 10% discarded as burn-in in each case,
