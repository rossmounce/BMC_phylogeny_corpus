Abstract
Background: Automated protein function prediction methods are needed to keep pace with high-throughput
sequencing. With the existence of many programs and databases for inferring different protein functions, a pipeline that
properly integrates these resources will benefit from the advantages of each method. However, integrated systems
usually do not provide mechanisms to generate customized databases to predict particular protein functions. Here, we
describe a tool termed PIPA (Pipeline for Protein Annotation) that has these capabilities.
Results: PIPA annotates protein functions by combining the results of multiple programs and databases, such as InterPro
and the Conserved Domains Database, into common Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The major algorithms implemented
in PIPA are: (1) a profile database generation algorithm, which generates customized profile databases to predict
particular protein functions, (2) an automated ontology mapping generation algorithm, which maps various classification
schemes into GO, and (3) a consensus algorithm to reconcile annotations from the integrated programs and databases.
PIPA's profile generation algorithm is employed to construct the enzyme profile database CatFam, which predicts
catalytic functions described by Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers. Validation tests show that CatFam yields average
recall and precision larger than 95.0%. CatFam is integrated with PIPA.
We use an association rule mining algorithm to automatically generate mappings between terms of two ontologies from
annotated sample proteins. Incorporating the ontologies' hierarchical topology into the algorithm increases the number
of generated mappings. In particular, it generates 40.0% additional mappings from the Clusters of Orthologous Groups
(COG) to EC numbers and a six-fold increase in mappings from COG to GO terms. The mappings to EC numbers show
a very high precision (99.8%) and recall (96.6%), while the mappings to GO terms show moderate precision (80.0%) and
low recall (33.0%).
Our consensus algorithm for GO annotation is based on the computation and propagation of likelihood scores associated
with GO terms. The test results suggest that, for a given recall, the application of the consensus algorithm yields higher
precision than when consensus is not used.
Conclusion: The algorithms implemented in PIPA provide automated genome-wide protein function annotation based
on reconciled predictions from multiple resources.

Background
New sequencing technologies are accumulating proteins
with no function annotation at an ever-increasing speed.
Traditional experimental methods for determining protein function have proven to be costly and time consuming. Even the use of human curators, who determine
protein function from various bioinformatics resources,
the literature, and experimental data, will not suffice.
Therefore, high-throughput computational tools for accurate and automated protein function prediction are perhaps the only plausible alternative.
Numerous approaches for protein function inference have
been proposed [1-4]. These are based on protein homology determined through sequence similarity, structural
similarity, function-related sequence and structural features [1], and more sophisticated methods, such as phylogenetic trees [2]. Non-homology-based methods [3], also
called genomic context-based predictions, use genomic
profiles, gene proximity, and protein interactions for function transfer. The complex relationships between
sequence/structure and function lead to errors in function
annotation, not only at low sequence identity, where
homology is difficult to establish, but also at high
sequence identity, where mutations in a few functionallyimportant sites lead to change in function [4]. However,
due to the readily available and fast-growing protein
sequence information, sequence homology-based function inference is still the basis for most protein function
annotation methods. Compared to direct sequence-based
methods, such as function inference through BLAST
search, inference based on function-related sequence features, such as domain profiles or motifs, is more accurate
and more sensitive for proteins that have low sequence
similarity with proteins of known function. This has led to
the development and popularity of a wide variety of feature databases, such as Pfam [5], ProDom [6], PROSITE
[7], the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) [8], and
the Conserved Domains Database (CDD) [9]. Recently,
more specialized feature databases have been developed
for the prediction of specific protein functions. For example, PRIAM [10] and EFICAz [11] provide profile databases for protein catalytic function predictions. They have
proven to be more accurate and sensitive than feature
databases developed for general-purpose protein function
prediction.
With the existence of many programs and databases that
have the capability of inferring different protein functions, a pipeline that properly integrates these resources is
able to predict genome-wide protein function with higher
accuracy than any individual method. Large integrated
information systems, like InterPro [12], BASys [13],
GenDB [14], PUMA2 [15], MaGe [16], AGMIAL [17], and
IMG [18], are constantly emerging. They include compre-

hensive resources that allow curators and users alike to
gain insights into protein functions. However, these systems are not designed to algorithmically combine different resources for automated protein function prediction.
Rather, function information from different resources is
usually listed in their original forms, such as accession
numbers in a database, and the succinct description of
protein functions, reconciling the results from the different resources and eliminating false positive predictions, is
edited by human curators. In addition, these systems do
not provide tools for database customization to improve
the prediction of protein functions of interest.
To address these issues, we describe a new integrated and
automated protein function prediction pipeline termed
PIPA (Pipeline for Protein Annotation). PIPA differs from
other integrated systems as it not only integrates existing
programs and databases, but it also allows integration of
users' data to predict particular protein functions. This is
accomplished through a profile generation procedure for
user-categorized protein functions. Most importantly,
PIPA combines all integrated resources into a consistent
and parsimonious consensus function annotation; a valuable feature that most integrated systems do not provide.
The consensus function annotation based on a composite
of all resources is potentially able to reduce the effect of
false predictions from individual sources, such as databases that are based on protein short motifs, and yield
more reliable predictions.
Most established profile databases, such as ProDom and
EFICAz, are generated using complex procedures based on
either PSI-BLAST [19] or HMMER [20]. The main features
of these procedures are the control of profile quality and
the generation of multiple profiles for each function
related with sequence-divergent proteins. Multiple profiles can be sequentially and iteratively generated from a
set of proteins with a common function. This approach
has been used to build the ProDom and the PRIAM databases. Conversely, EFICAz builds multiple profiles simultaneously based on clusters of proteins with similar
sequences. This reduces the possibility of separating proteins with very similar sequences in the sequential generation of multiple profiles for one function. PIPA adopts
the EFICAz procedure. However, unlike EFICAz, it establishes a cut-off threshold for each generated profile. The
profile-specific threshold is associated with a user-defined
false-positive rate, and it is determined by applying the
profile to search a database consisting of functionally
related (positive) and unrelated (negative) proteins. The
profile-specific threshold assures the accuracy of the functions inferred by the profile. This is an advantage over a
profile database with a single threshold, which only
assures an average accuracy of the functions inferred by all
profiles. We apply the profile generation algorithm to cre-

ate an enzyme profile database for accurate prediction of
protein catalytic functions, named CatFam. CatFam is an
integral part of PIPA.
It is challenging for automated computer programs to perform consensus annotation. This is mainly due to the differences in terminology used by various inference
methods and the implicit semantic relationships among
terms. For example, the fact that one protein is inferred as
a "glucokinase" by one method and as a "hexokinase" by
another cannot be reconciled unless the computer program knows the relationship between the two terms. In
this case, "hexokinase" is a consensus term supported by
both predictions, since "glucokinase" is a special type of
"hexokinase." The Gene Ontology (GO) consortium [21]
has addressed this issue and is dedicated to a consistent
description of all gene products. It provides controlled
terms and organizes them as a directed acyclic graph.
PIPA adopts GO as a unifying terminology to annotate
protein functions. It contains an algorithm to map functions predicted by individual methods using different terminologies (usually database accessions) into GO terms
and an algorithm to make consensus predictions based on
GO terms.
Mappings from some of the most popular databases to
GO terms can be found in the GO website [21]. For databases that do not have mappings for thousands of their
families, we use an association rule mining (ARM) algorithm [22] to automatically generate mappings based on
samples of proteins with assigned GO terms. The ARM
algorithm was previously used to map InterPro identification numbers to Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers
[23], where the two databases were considered as two
"flat" ontologies. Alternatively, we take into account the
hierarchical topology of GO by asserting that: if a GO
term can be assigned to a protein, so can its ancestors (i.e.,
all terms in the path from that term up to the root term of
the hierarchy). This helps increase the identification of
GO terms for protein families in a database, especially
when these families are not related with very specific GO
terms that are often used to annotate proteins.
Previously, GO-based consensus was proposed for protein
function annotation via multiple matches of GO-annotated protein sequences from a single method, usually
BLAST search of a single database [24,25]. The general
practice is to propagate the GO terms of matched proteins
into a few common ancestral GO terms on the GO hierarchical graph. The ancestral terms are more likely to provide the correct function annotation for the query protein
and result in good precision. However, they do not contain as much information (recall) as their descendant
terms. One way to achieve a balance between precision

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/52

and recall is to develop algorithms that assign scores to
GO terms and select those terms with scores exceeding a
threshold. For example, both GoFigure [24] and GOtcha
[25] compute weighted scores for GO terms from the Evalue of BLAST hits and propagate them to ancestral
terms. GoFigure uses an empirical threshold to select consensus GO terms, while GOtcha infers probability measures for scores of each GO term from background
samples. PIPA assigns (heuristically-generated) likelihood
scores for GO terms, which indicate the possibility that a
GO term is the correct annotation for the query protein.
Our algorithm allows users to choose different thresholds
for the selection of different consensus terms.
Here, we present the three most important algorithms
developed for PIPA: the profile generation procedure, the
algorithm for the automated generation of GO mappings,
and the GO-based consensus algorithm, which we believe
to be the key elements of an integrated and automated
protein function annotation system.

Results and discussion
Pipeline overview
PIPA is designed to allow for easy development of new
profile databases and integration of various bioinformatics tools. Figure 1 shows the three modules of the pipeline. The pipeline execution module consists of programs
that enable user access to and control of the pipeline's parallel execution of multiple programs. The execution module wraps the core module, containing all integrated
methods (programs and databases), the terminology conversion program, and the consensus annotation program.
The support module contains the profile database generation program, which creates new profile databases, and
the GO-mapping generation program, which creates GO
mappings for the terminology conversion program.

Currently, the major integrated methods in PIPA consist
of the CatFam database, constructed by the profile database generation program, the 11 publicly-available databases integrated by InterPro, the CDD, the database of
Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), the transmembrane and signal peptide prediction program Phobius
[26], and the bacterial subcellular localization prediction
program PSORTb [27]. Table 1 gives a complete list of
these resources. PIPA takes as input protein sequences in
FASTA format [28] and executes all integrated methods.
Parameters, such as E-value cut-off, recommended by the
developers of each of the integrated methods are used as
the default settings. However, the parameters can be modified to control the rate of false positives in predictions.
These predictions, based on their original terminologies,
are then converted into GO terms using mapping files.
Lastly, the GO consensus annotation algorithm takes
these GO terms to determine consensus terms, which are

program, which can be used to generate other specialized
databases, provided that sufficient number of sequences is
available for clustering and profile generation. Therefore,
the evaluation of CatFam's performance in the following
section not only demonstrates PIPA's reliability in the prediction of protein catalytic functions but also the effectiveness of its profile generation program.
PIPA is deployed on a LINUX computer cluster at the U.S.
Army Research Laboratory's Major Shared Resource
Center. All integrated programs are executed in parallel.
Using 64 computing processors, PIPA can annotate a typical bacterial genome consisting of 4,000 proteins in
about six hours.

file in the General Feature Format [29].
In the framework of PIPA, CatFam is not only one of its
integrated databases that provides catalytic function prediction, but also an example of PIPA's profile generation

Measures for performance evaluation
There are no universally-accepted approaches to assess the
performance of automated function annotation. Here, we
use precision and recall, two measures widely-used by the
machine learning community, to evaluate the performance of enzyme predictions by CatFam. Precision is the
fraction of correctly predicted EC numbers out of all predicted EC numbers, while recall is the fraction of correctly
predicted EC numbers out of all EC numbers in the test
dataset. In the context of the three-digit EC number prediction, a prediction is considered correct if the first three
EC digits match the true EC number.

We evaluate GO predictions by considering the ontology's
hierarchical structure in the analysis, so that if one GO
term is appropriate to describe a protein function, all of its
ancestral terms are appropriate as well. This is also called
the true path rule [30]. Therefore, if the prediction of a GO
term is its ancestor term, rather than the term itself, the

prediction is counted as precise but less specific. In other
words, not all information is recalled. Conversely, if a prediction of a GO term is its child term, the prediction is
counted as specific but less precise. These considerations
led to the extension of the standard definitions of precision and recall, and the establishment of hierarchical precision (HP) and hierarchical recall (HR) for evaluations of
GO term predictions [31]. Both HP and HR are normalized to lie in the range [0, 1], and are both equal to one
when the predicted annotations completely match the
true annotations.
Enzyme prediction evaluation
We use PIPA's sequence profile generation procedure to
construct CatFam. The data used for CatFam development
and testing include both enzymes and non-enzymes and
are described in the Methods Section. We apply a total of
170,229 proteins for the profile generation. We specify a
low false-positive rate of 1.0% (precision 99.0%) to determine the profile-specific cut-off thresholds, and construct
databases for three- and four-digit EC number predictions, CatFam-3D and CatFam-4D, respectively. We use a
total of 18,949 proteins, not used for profile generation,
for CatFam testing. The databases CatFam-3D and CatFam-4D achieve the expected 99.0% precision with 95.5%
and 92.5% recall, respectively.

To test CatFam's contribution to function prediction for
enzymes with low sequence identity to known enzymes,
we sort the testing results according to the maximum
sequence identity (MSI) between the query protein and
the proteins used for profile generation. Figure 2 shows
the precision and recall as a function of MSI. All curves
have a similar trend; both precision and recall increase
with increasing MSI. Both databases achieve more than
90.0% precision and more than 70.0% recall when MSI is
decreased to 40.0%.
Mappings between different ontologies
We develop a procedure that uses the ARM algorithm,
detailed in the Methods Section, to automatically generate
mappings between two ontologies from sample proteins.
We apply this procedure to generate mappings from COG
families to GO terms. The sample proteins consist of
31,589 proteins from Swiss-Prot with annotated GO
terms. We search these proteins against a COG profile
database for matched profiles, determined by a cut-off Evalue, that are associated with particular COG families.
The ARM algorithm analyzes the COG-GO links and uses
two statistics, support and confidence, to determine a mapping of one COG family to one GO term. Support is
defined as the number of instances in which a COG family and a GO term appear, and confidence represents a conditional probability of the generated mapping. The

CatFam performance evaluation. The performance of
CatFam is measured by precision and recall, which are
defined as precision = TP/(TP+FP) and recall = TP/(TP+FN),
where TP, FP and FN represent the number of true-positive,
false-positive, and false-negative predictions, respectively. A
total of 18,949 proteins, not used for profile generation, are
used to evaluate two CatFam databases, CatFam-3D and
CatFam-4D, which predict 3-digit and 4-digit EC numbers for
query proteins, respectively. The results are sorted according to the maximum sequence identity between the query
protein and the proteins used for profile generation.

algorithm accepts a mapping if the associated support is
greater than 4 and confidence is greater than 99.0%.
We apply a similar procedure to generate COG-to-EC
mappings, using the sample proteins employed in CatFam generation. These mappings are expected to increase
the number of subsequent COG-to-GO mappings
through the established EC-to-GO relationship.
Figure 3 shows a parametric study of the number of generated mappings as a function of cut-off E-values.
Although typical cut-off E-values, such as 10-2, have been
used in some applications [32], we try a series of cut-off
values to find the best operating point at which the maximum number of mappings might be found. A trend can
be observed for COG-to-EC mappings, where the number
of generated mappings increases to a maximum and then
decreases as the cut-off E-values decrease. The increase is
explained by the removal of false-positive matches with
the reduction in the cut-off values. The decrease after the
maximum is due to the elimination of true-positive
matches when the cut-off value is further reduced. The
smaller number of mappings generated for larger cut-off
E-values also suggests that the mapping generation proc-

Mapping evaluation. The number of automatically generated mappings is significantly increased for properly-selected
cut-off E-values when the hierarchical topology of the ontologies is used. Larger cut-off E-values (small values on the x
axis) result in excessive false hits for sample proteins, while
smaller cut-off E-values exclude true hits. Both cases reduce
the number of mappings that can be generated.

ess can avoid misleading false-positive matches. More
importantly, Figure 3 shows that considering the hierarchical structures in the GO and the EC ontologies help
generate significantly larger number of mappings. In particular, six times more COG-to-GO mappings and over
40.0% more COG-to-EC mappings are generated with a
properly selected E-value threshold.
In order to evaluate the accuracy of the automatically-generated mappings, we perform a 20-fold cross-validation,
where we randomly select 95.0% of the proteins from the
31,589 sample proteins to generate the mappings and use
the remaining 5.0% for testing. We repeat this procedure
20 times, each with different partitioning of the dataset.
Table 2 shows the result. The COG-to-GO mappings
achieve moderate average precision (80.0%) and low
average recall (33.0%) for GO annotation. However, the
COG-to-EC mappings, evaluated in a similar cross-validation procedure, achieve excellent performance with
99.8% precision and 96.6% recall.
The comparison of COG-to-GO and COG-to-EC mappings indicates that the number and quality of the automated mappings strongly depend on the annotation
accuracy and completeness of the sample proteins used
for mapping generation. For example, if a GO term is
assigned to only half of the proteins that should have that

GO annotation and all of these proteins match one COG
family, the observed confidence for the mapping of this
COG family to the GO term would be only 50.0%, and
this mapping would be discarded. Actually, we find cases
in which the correct GO terms are not assigned to proteins, especially for enzyme annotations in the Swiss-Prot
database. The absence of GO terms could explain the fact
that the number of automatically-generated COG-to-GO
mappings is much smaller than the number of COG-toEC mappings generated in a similar way (Figure 3). More
GO mappings are expected to be generated with the addition of new curated GO annotations to the Swiss-Prot
database.
Evaluation of GO-based consensus annotations
We determine consensus GO terms for protein predictions from distinct individual sources by considering the
mapped GO terms and their ancestral terms. Initially, our
algorithm assigns scores to each GO term for each individual source that infers that GO term. For consistent scoring
across the different prediction algorithms, each individual
score is calculated based on the E-value of the prediction
and is scaled between zero and one using the corresponding cut-off E-values E0 and E1, respectively, as explained in
the Methods Section. A minimum score of zero is assigned
to a prediction if the corresponding E-value is equal to or
greater than E0, and a maximum score of one is assigned
if the E-value is equal to or smaller than E1. Each GO term
acquires a final score based on all of its individual scores
and composite scores propagated to it from its descendants through the GO topology. The terms with final scores
greater than a pre-selected score acceptance threshold
(SAT) are included in the consensus prediction.

We employ the 31,589 proteins from Swiss-Prot with
annotated GO terms to test the consensus algorithm. The
hierarchical precision HP provides a measure of the accuracy of the GO-term predictions, and hierarchical recall

HR provides a measure of the coverage of the predictions.
Figure 4 compares the performance of GO annotations
with and without the consensus algorithm for all three
GO categories: molecular function, biological process,
and cellular component. Data points corresponding to the
consensus algorithm are obtained by changing parameters E0, E1, and SAT. Without consensus, adjusting the performance of GO annotations is achieved by changing the
cut-off E-value. The figure suggests a significant trade-off
between precision and recall. However, for a given recall,
the application of the consensus algorithm yields higher
precision than when consensus is not used. Precision is
improved by up to 8.0% for both molecular function and
cellular component, and by up to 4.0% for biological
process. The highest precision is achieved for the parameters set as E0 = 0.01, E1 = 10-200, and SAT = 0.99 for all three
GO categories, which are highlighted in the figure with
larger-size markers.

line, is likely due to the incompleteness of the GO
mappings that link individual databases with GO terms
and the limited coverage of the integrated databases for
the prediction of biological processes and cellular components. The existing mappings to GO terms from PIPA's
two major sources, InterPro and CatFam, cover a total of
4,379 molecular function terms, 1,053 biological process
terms, and 266 cellular component terms, whereas the
31,589 testing proteins contain 2,814 molecular function
terms, 4,517 biological process terms, and 907 cellular
component terms. This means that no more than 23.0%
of the biological process terms and 29.0% of the cellular
component terms associated with the testing proteins can
be covered by existing GO mappings. We expect that the
addition of GO mappings for existing databases and the
integration of new methods, capable of predicting currently underrepresented protein functions, will increase
the coverage of GO annotations in PIPA.

The results suggest that the consensus algorithm effectively integrates different function inferences to improve
the precision of GO annotation. The low HR, which indicates a low coverage of GO terms predicted by the pipe-

Current limitations and plans for improvement
Perhaps, one of PIPA's main limitations is that all of its
currently integrated resources to predict protein function
use annotation transfer based on sequence homology.
Sequence homology is the most established approach for
protein function prediction. However, we are planning on
expending PIPA's function prediction capabilities by
incorporating comparative analysis approaches, e.g., phylogenetic tree analysis, to prevent function transfer errors
caused by gene duplication or gene loss. Future work may
also include the incorporation of non-homology-based
prediction methods. For example, de novo function prediction based on machine-learning algorithms with
sequence-derived features seems very promising [33].
They may provide valuable resources for predicting
orphan proteins, which do not have significant sequence
similarity with known proteins. However, such methods
require substantial training data and are thus limited to
well-populated Gene Ontology categories. Function prediction methods based on protein-protein interaction networks [34] are also becoming important due to the
increased availability of protein interaction data. However, experimental uncertainty of protein interaction data
makes these methods unsuitable for automated, largescale implementation, at this stage of development.

Figure 4
GO consensus evaluation
GO consensus evaluation. PIPA's GO annotations with
and without the consensus algorithm are compared for hierarchical precision (HP) and hierarchical recall (HR). For the
consensus algorithm, each data point in the figure is computed by using different combinations of the three parameters, E0, E1, and SAT. When the consensus algorithm is not
used, each data point is obtained by selecting a different cutoff E-value. The figure indicates that the consensus algorithm
improves HP for each of the three GO categories. The highlighted points correspond to consensus algorithm results
with parameters E0 = 0.01, E1 = 1e-200, and SAT = 0.99.

Another perceived limitation of PIPA relates to the potential false-positive predictions inferred by integrated methods that are based on short motifs. In its current
configuration, PIPA has some mechanisms to alleviate
this problem. First, for methods that are dependent on
short motifs and systematically yield excessive false positives, PIPA can reduce them by restricting the E-value cutoffs. Second, because PIPA's function annotation is based

motifs prevalent in different function domain databases.
In future developments, we will explore alternative solutions based on data mining [35], which are similar in
spirit to the approaches that we have already applied to
generate mappings between ontologies.

database with a generic GO term that is infrequently used
to annotate proteins.

Conclusion

It should be noted that PIPA is more than a readily available comprehensive protein function annotation pipeline. It is an open framework for incorporating different
function prediction methods, homology-based or nonhomology-based, whenever they become mature and
available. As additional computational methods are
incorporated, PIPA will expand the functional categories
of annotated proteins. This will improve annotation reliability through the consensus procedure, which mitigates
potential false predictions from individual methods. In
addition, PIPA's modular parallelization framework will
maintain the pipeline's high-throughput capability after
integration of any number of resources.

We have developed methods for an integrated and automated protein function annotation pipeline. The three
main algorithms presented here improve annotation
accuracy by providing the means to develop customized
profile databases and by exploiting and consistently consolidating protein function information from disparate
sources based on different terminologies. An added benefit is that the consolidated function predictions are given
in GO terms, which is becoming the de facto standard in
the community.
We show the effectiveness of the profile generation procedure for particular protein functions through the development of CatFam, which not only achieves overall excellent
precision and recall but also performs well for enzymes
with low sequence identity. The clustering procedure and
the use of negative samples have contributed to the quality of the generated profiles. In addition, the use of profile-specific thresholds ensures equal accuracy for each
profile and avoids the problem of having a single E-value
threshold for all profiles, which yields good overall results
but poor performance for some profiles. Moreover, the
introduction of negative samples allows users to set a
false-positive rate for the resulting database.
Although PIPA achieves very good performance for catalytic function annotation with the CatFam databases, its
overall performance for other categorical functions is
dependent on the various integrated resources. PIPA's
profile generation algorithm may be helpful in developing methods to annotate some of these functions, however, for other functions, such as protein subcellular
location inferred with PSORTb and transmembrane proteins inferred with Phobius, highly specialized methods
are irreplaceable.
We adopt GO as the unifying protein annotation terminology to fuse various functions inferred from different
sources. We demonstrate that mappings between terminologies used by different sources and GO can be generated by the ARM algorithm from samples of annotated
proteins. The significantly increased number of identified
mappings suggests that GO's hierarchical topology must
be considered during the mapping generation. It provides
the opportunity to link a broad functional category in a

Concise and more accurate GO annotations can be
obtained by the proposed consensus algorithm. The ability to optimize the algorithm's parameters and the future
availability of additional reliable GO mappings will further improve consensus predictions.

Methods
Data preparation
All data used in this paper are from the Swiss-Prot database (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot 51.1) and from the Enzyme
Nomenclature Database (END), both released on November 14, 2006. These consist of 75,687 enzymes annotated
by END and the corresponding sequences from SwissProt. Of these, a randomly selected set of 68,087 (90.0%)
are used for generating (training) CatFam and the remaining 7,600 for testing. In addition, we use a total of
113,491 non-enzyme proteins from Swiss-Prot as negative examples, where 90.0% are used for training CatFam
and the remaining 10.0% for testing. Hence, the entire
training and testing data sets consist of 170,229 and
18,949 proteins, respectively.

We employ a total of 31,589 proteins with annotated GO
terms from Swiss-Prot for generating mappings between
different ontologies and GO and evaluating the GO consensus algorithm. This set only includes reliable GO
annotations and, therefore, excludes annotations with
evidence codes IEA (Inferred by Electronic Annotation),
NAS (Non-traceable Author Statement), and ND (No biological Data available). Among the 120,783 GO annotations for these proteins, 21,418 (17.7 %) are labeled with
ISS (Inferred from Sequence or Structural Similarity) evidence codes. We consider these annotations as reliable
because, according to the guide to GO evidence codes
[36], ISS is part of the "Curator-assigned Evidence Codes,"
where human curators have reviewed the annotations initially inferred from sequence or structural similarity.

Sequence profile database generation
A sequence profile generated from protein sequences of a
common function reveals the functionally conserved
amino acid patterns on the sequences. Hence, a protein
that matches such a profile will be annotated by the function associated with the profile. We construct a database
of sequence profiles from proteins with known functions.
The proteins are grouped by their different functions,
where each group forms a training set for a specific function. One or multiple profiles are generated for each function. In addition, a separate testing database, consisting of
all of these proteins and other proteins with irrelevant
functions (negative examples), is used to test a profile's
performance during the profile generation procedure. The
following steps describe this procedure:

1. For a given protein function, estimate pair-wise
sequence similarity for proteins in the training set associated with that function. This is achieved through an allagainst-all PSI-BLAST search, where E-values are used as
the similarity score.
2. Based on sequence similarity (E-values), employ a hierarchical clustering algorithm [37] to group proteins of the
given function into distinct clusters. Initially, each
sequence forms a cluster. Then, perform a pair-wise search
among all clusters and merge two clusters, Ci and Cj, that
have the smallest cost function
F(Ci, Cj) = max[E(a,b), ∀a ∈ Ci, ∀b ∈ Cj]

(1)

into one cluster. Here, E(a,b) denotes the E-value between
protein sequences a and b in clusters Ci and Cj, respectively. Sequentially continue this merging procedure until
the cost function F exceeds a specified limit.
3. Generate one profile for each cluster. A profile generation begins by performing multiple sequence alignments
(MSA) with ClustalW [38] for a subset of the most similar
protein sequences in the cluster. Record the number of
conserved positions in the MSA.
4. The MSA is provided as input to PSI-BLAST, which generates a profile in the format of a position specific scoring
matrix (PSSM). Next, search for proteins that match the
profile in the testing database, consisting of proteins of all
functions. Taking a raw score as a cut-off value, find protein matches of the same function as the profile (true-positive hits) and some protein matches to other functions
(false-positive hits). Determine the lowest raw score cutoff for the profile, termed raw score threshold (RST), so
that the false-positive rate for matched proteins is smaller
than a specified value.

5. Add one additional protein to the MSA in Step 3 and
repeat Step 4. Based on the pair-wise sequence similarity
computed in Step 1, the newly added protein has the most
similar sequence with those in the MSA. Continue this
iteration until the number of conserved positions, i.e., columns of identical amino acids, in the MSA is reduced to
one.
6. Compare all PSSM profiles created in Step 4, and select
the one with the maximum number of true positive hits as
the final profile for that cluster.
7. Repeat Steps 3–6 for all clusters generated in Step 2.
8. Repeat Steps 1–7 for all protein functions. The profiles
for all functions are stored with their corresponding RSTs
in a RPS-BLAST searchable database.
This procedure is used to generate the enzyme profile
database CatFam for both three- and four-digit EC numbers, CatFam-3D and CatFam-4D, respectively. Because
the profiles generated in Step 4 above use a database containing both positive and negative samples, each database
can be generated with a specified false-positive rate and
each profile is associated with a specific threshold (i.e.,
RST). This is a distinct feature of CatFam, which, in a
sense, allows developers to guarantee a false-positive rate
of the predictions for each function.
Algorithm for mappings among different ontologies
Mapping among different ontologies is the process of
translating terms from one ontology into another. To
automate this process, we first link terms between two
ontologies by applying terms of one ontology to re-annotate a set of sample proteins that have been annotated
with another ontology. Next, we apply the ARM algorithm
[21] to extract the underlying mappings between the two
ontologies from the sample proteins. Following, we
describe the algorithm to generate the mappings from
COG families to GO terms, given a set of GO-annotated
sample proteins D, consisting of the 31,589 proteins from
Swiss-Prot database described above.

1. For one sample protein in set D, with known GO terms
denoted as G, apply RPS-BLAST to search the COG profile
database for matches bellow a given cut-off E-value. The
resulting COG-family IDs, denoted as C, and GO terms G
form one instance that links COG and GO terms, denoted
as I(C→G).
2. Extend the set G in I(C→G) by including all ancestral
GO terms associated with G.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for all sample proteins in D.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/52

4. For all instances of links I(C→G), obtain the "true"
mappings between COG family IDs and GO terms. The
ARM algorithm searches for pairs of COG ID and GO
term, denoted as (c, g), and for each pair calculates two
statistics: support(c, g) and confidence(c→g), which are
defined as

2. When different sources happen to infer the same GO
term f, compute a composite evidence score LS(f) for that
term,

support(c, g) = the number of instances that contain both
terms c and g
(2)

3. Next, propagate the composite evidence score upwards
for all ancestors of f. For a given ancestor q of GO-term f,
the propagated evidence score LP(f,q) is given as

confidence(c→g) = support (c, g)/support (c)

(3)

5. If both support(c, g) and confidence(c→g) exceed a specified threshold, the mapping from COG ID c to GO term g
is generated. However, this mapping from c to g is not
considered if g is an ancestor of some GO term g' whose c
to g' mapping has already been generated.
A similar procedure is applied to generate COG to EC
mappings employing the 170,229 EC-annotated proteins
used to construct CatFam, as discussed above.
Hierarchical consensus prediction
We develop a consensus algorithm to reconcile GO-term
annotations for a query protein inferred from multiple
sources, such that the reconciled (consensus) GO annotations are more accurate yet specific enough for the description of the protein's functions. The algorithm is based on
heuristically-generated likelihood scores, ranging from 0
to 1, which indicate the likelihood that a GO term is the
correct annotation for the query protein. The higher the
score is, the more likely the GO term is the correct annotation. The following steps detail the consensus algorithm.

1. For a given query protein, identify a set F of GO terms
f, where f ∈ F, and sets of E-values Ef, where each e, with e
∈ Ef, is the E-value from one individual source that infers
GO term f. Each GO term f is assigned one evidence score
l(f,e) from each source with associated E-values e, given by
the following equation

e ≥ E0
⎧ 0,
⎪ log(e / E )
⎪
0 , E <e<E
l( f , e) = ⎨
1
0
log(E1 / E 0 )
⎪
⎪ 1,
e ≤ E1
⎩

(4)

where E1 and E0 correspond to preset upper and lower
bounds on E-values, respectively. The evidence score is set
to 0 for E-values equal to or larger than E0, and to 1 for Evalues equal to or smaller than E1. Different sources may
use different values for E1 and E0.

L S( f ) = 1 −

∏ (1 − l( f , e)).

(5)

e∈E f

Nq
⎧
, L S( f ) > 0
⎪ L S ( f ) + (1 − L S ( f )) ×
N0
L P ( f , q) = ⎨
⎪ 0,
L S( f ) = 0
⎩
(6)
where Nq and N0 are the number of leaf terms under the q
term and the root term, respectively. Note that equation
(5) assigns 1 to LP for the root term if any of its descendants has a non-zero composite evidence score. This allows
for consistent assignment of maximum likelihood values
to each of three root GO terms, molecular function, biological process and cellular component, which can always
be assigned to a given protein.
4. Finally, each GO-term q gets one final score L(q),

L(q) = 1 − (1 − L S (q)) ×

∏ (1 − L ( f , q))
P

f ∈C q

(7)

where Cq is the set of GO terms that are descendants of q
in set F.
5. The consensus GO terms for the query protein are identified by scanning all GO terms and selecting the ones that
have a final score L greater than a specified score acceptance threshold. If a GO term and one of its ancestors are
both selected, the ancestor annotation is eliminated from
the consensus, yielding a more specific set of annotations.
