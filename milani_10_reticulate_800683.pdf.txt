Reticulate evolution in stick insects: the case of
Clonopsis (Insecta Phasmida)
Liliana Milani1, Fabrizio Ghiselli1, Marco Pellecchia2, Valerio Scali1, Marco Passamonti1*

Abstract
Background: Phasmids show noteworthy abilities to overcome species-specific reproductive isolation mechanisms,
including hybridization, polyploidy, parthenogenesis, hybridogenesis and androgenesis. From an evolutionary
standpoint, such tangled reproductive interactions lead to the complex phyletic relationships known as “reticulate
evolution”. Moroccan stick insects of the genus Clonopsis include one bisexual (C. felicitatis) and two closely related
parthenogenetic forms (C. gallica, C. soumiae), which represent a polyploid series in chromosome number, but with
apparent diploid karyotypes. Moreover, two Clonopsis strains of ameiotic males have been described, C. androgenes35 and C. androgenes-53. As a consequence, Clonopsis stick insects may have experienced complex microevolutionary events, which we try to disentangle in this study.
Results: Mitochondrial cox2 analysis supports a recent divergence of Clonopsis, while AFLPs evidence genetic
differentiation not linked to karyotypes, so that parthenogenetic C. gallica and C. soumiae appear to be a mix of
strains of polyphyletic origin rather than single parthenogenetic species. Moreover, an admixed hybrid origin seems
to be confirmed for C. androgenes.
Conclusion: On the whole, Clonopsis is an intriguing case of reticulate evolution. Actually, complex cladogenetic
events should be taken into account to explain the observed genetic structure, including diploidization of
polyploid karyotypes, possibly coupled with hybridization and androgenesis. We also proposed a “working
hypothesis” to account for the observed data, which deserves further studies, but fits the observed data very well.

Background
Gene duplication, by which identical copies of genes are
created within a single genome, is a major evolutionary
process in producing new functions in eukaryotes.
Among the possible mechanisms to gain extra copies of
genes, whole genome duplication has been suggested as
an important step in the production of evolutionary
novelties, such as in Vertebrates, Arabidopsis and other
eukaryotes (see [1,2] for reviews). In such lineages,
ancient polyploidization events have been suggested, followed by a process of diploidization of the genome (i.e.
the evolutionary process whereby a polyploid species
‘decays’ to become diploid; [1]). Polyploidy is a common
feature of stick insects (Phasmida), so they might be a
system of choice to study many aspects of polyploidization. Phasmids also show a noteworthy ability to

overcome species-specific reproductive isolation
mechanisms, so that hybrids are often found [3]. Such
hybrids may show high levels of heterozigosity, which,
particularly when co-occurring with polyploidy, may
allow them to persist for a long time (i.e. their allelic
richness would permit better adaptation to changing
environments). Hybridization leads also to parthenogenesis, and parthenogenetic females may not be completely
isolated from the closest taxa, since backcrosses to
paternal or related species may occur to incorporate
additional genomes, thus increasing ploidy level and
overall genetic variability [4-6]. From an evolutionary
standpoint, such tangled reproductive interactions lead
to the complex phyletic relationships known as “reticulate evolution” [3].
To make reticulate evolution of phasmids even more
complicated, stick insects may also reproduce by androgenesis, as first discovered in Bacillus hybrids [7] and
recently proposed to account for Leptynia attenuata fast
chromosome evolution, as well as for the origin of

Pijnackeria hispanica (formerly Leptynia) parthenogens
[4,6,8].
Another intriguing cytological feature of Phasmida is
their extreme karyotype diversity and their capability for
deep chromosomal repatterning [8-11]. Moreover, in
parthenogenetic forms the chromosome number is
extremely variable, and up to 100 can be found [12].
This paper deals with the molecular characterization of
the stick insect genus Clonopsis, focusing on North African strains. The genus included two bisexual North African species, Clonopsis maroccana Bullini & Nascetti
(cn = 22/21, XX/X0) and Clonopsis algerica Pantel (cn =
32/31, XX/X0), and an obligate parthenogenetic species,
Clonopsis gallica Charpentier, with a wide distribution in
North Africa and Europe, showing a karyotype of 54 - 57
chromosomes. Recent studies on Moroccan samples
revealed the existence of two additional North African
taxa related to C. gallica: the bisexual Clonopsis felicitatis
Scali & Milani (cn = 36/35, XX/X0) and the all-female
Clonopsis soumiae Scali & Milani (cn = 72) [13].
Together with C. gallica, they form a numerically polyploid series with haploid number n = 18, being C. felicitatis diploid (cn = 36), C. gallica triploid (cn = 54) and C.
soumiae tetraploid (cn = 72). Quite surprisingly however,
they all seem to be diploid by standard karyotyping techniques (see [5] for detailed pictures of the karyotypes), so
diploidization was considered for these forms, like for the
sexual and parthenogenetic stick insect Sipylodea nelida
[5,10]. Furthermore, two strains of ameiotic males, C.
androgenes-35 and C. androgenes-53, with cn = 35 (X0)
or 53 (X0) diploid karyotypes were found, which, it is
suggested, maintain themselves as clonal androgens:
these are thought to derive from diploid species hybrids,
which, by skipping meiosis, may produce unreduced but
genetically and chromosomally balanced sperm, thus
becoming able to father clonal sons when inseminating
the eggs of the syntopic all-female C. soumiae by excluding its genetic contribution [5].
With such a complex array of unusual reproduction
modes, the genus Clonopsis represents an intriguing system to study reticulate evolution. Since the whole genome sequence of those insects is not available at the
moment, we used a more ‘classic’ approach to their
characterization. Previous papers on phasmids showed
that the combined use of nuclear and mitochondrial
markers may give significant results, therefore, to understand Clonopsis micro-evolution we used the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (cox2) and AFLP
markers. The cox2 gene has been sequenced over a wide
variety of phasmid taxa and has proved useful for phylogenetic research [4,8,14], while AFLPs, since their introduction in 1995 [15], have been successfully used on a
large number of organisms, bringing key answers to
major biological issues [16], and have been used to

Page 2 of 15

characterize the stick insect genus Timema [17]. As a
matter of fact, studies have demonstrated that AFLPs
have the capacity to resolve extremely small genetic differences [18,19], so they have been proposed as the best
markers to show up population genetic variability, when
compared to other available molecular approaches, such
as microsatellites, multigene DNA sequencing and SNPs
[20]. AFLPs have also proved to be a very powerful tool
for the identification of interspecific and intraspecific
hybrids [21], even in systems where microsatellites have
failed to do so [22]. For all the above mentioned reasons, AFLPs seem to be a good choice for unraveling
Clonopsis population structure and to obtain data that
might eventually shed light on the role of diploidization
in their evolution.
Our data suggest that parthenogenetic C. gallica and
C. soumiae are a mix of strains of polyphyletic origin
rather than single parthenogenetic species, all of them
supposedly diploid. To account for this, we discuss Clonopsis reticulate evolution in the light of the known
mechanisms of karyotype diploidization. Finally, we propose a testable hypothesis for Clonopsis micro-evolution,
which has the merit of fitting in with our data. Of
course, our scenario for Clonopsis deserves more indepth analyses to be tried, nevertheless we feel that this
is a sound “working hypothesis”.

Results
Pertinent information on analyzed samples are reported
in Table 1 and Figure 1

The cox2 alignment showed very low variability among
all analyzed Clonopsis specimens, except for C. maroccana, which clearly splits away from the cluster that
includes C. felicitatis, C. gallica and C. soumiae. Consequently the latter three species are more closely related
and might be considered as a species complex. However,
it is worth noting that cox2 haplotype distribution
appears to show little relationship with karyotypes; the
Bayesian tree (Figure 2A) showed up a few significant
groups (i.e. pp ≥ 95): i) two clusters including most, but
not all, European C. gallica (cn = 54); ii) a cluster which
quite surprisingly includes most of the specimens from
Targuist, regardless of their chromosome number (TAR;
cn = 35, 53, 72); iii) a small cluster including the two
females from Taferiate (TAF; cn = 54); iv) a cluster
including all amphygonic C. felicitatis from Tetouan
(TET; cn = 36/35, XX/X0); finally, a large unresolved
polytomy, including other European and North African
C. gallica (cn = 54), as well as C. soumiae (cn = 72) specimens (see Figure 1 for population acronyms).
Although some phylogenetic signal is present, the cox2based phylogeny does not appear to resolve the relationships between the above-mentioned groups, mainly
because of the very low level of overall variability;

moreover the parthenogenetic taxa C. gallica and
C. soumiae might be polyphyletic.
To better unravel haplotype relationships in such a
low variability framework, we applied the Templeton’s
network, which has already proved useful in such situations ([4] and references therein). The network (Figure
2B) showed that: i) all amphygonic specimens from
Tetouan (TET; C. felicitatis) cluster together and show
only a little variability (green); ii) as above, two separate
clusters include most, but not all, European C. gallica
(black); iii) all but one (TAR50) specimens from Targuist are still joined and they all share the same haplotype, regardless of their karyotype; iv) the rest of the
haplotypes form a quite homogeneous group, with C.
gallica and C. soumiae mixed together, and with only
TAF3, TAF4 and SEF42 being different for one
substitution.
For AFLPs, the three used highly polymorphic primer
combinations (see ‘Methods’) detected a total of 195

markers for the 27 analyzed individuals. Compared to
cox2, AFLP markers show a higher level of variability
and enable better differentiation among Clonopsis
populations.
The AFLP-based Minimum Evolution tree (ME, Figure
3A) showed up a basal polytomy for the bisexual C. felicitatis (TET), while all unisexuals separate with quite a
significant bootstrap value. Within unisexuals, some C.
gallica appear to be basal (i.e. OLA), while some others
(TAF, SEF) are joined in a large polytomy with C. soumiae, and the androgenetic males TAR5 (cn = 35),
TAR43 and TAR47 (cn = 53).
The genetic structure obtained by Bayesian analysis
(STRUCTURE software) gave additional clues regarding
the genetic diversification in Clonopsis. The graph is
reported on Figure 3B, aligned to the ME tree for easier
comparison. Five replicates for each value of K (from 1
to 12) were run under the admixture model with a
burn-in period of 50,000 and 750,000 iterations. The

admixture model means that individuals may have
mixed ancestry. Moreover, this model appears very useful for stick insects, as it can deal with hybrid zones in a
natural way. No prior information was used, and all
individuals were deemed as diploid, as shown up by karyotypes. A probability of membership q ≥ 80% was chosen to consider a genotype assigned to one population,
while a lower-than-threshold probability means that the
individual may have different parental populations, and
consequently is admixed via hybridization. In order to
determine K, the smallest value of the estimated probability of data was chosen, and this value was then compared with the more formal method proposed by [23].
Both methods gave 4 as the most probable value of K,
so we can assume that the dataset includes 4 parental
populations that are distinguishable on a genetic basis.
One includes the single specimen of C. maroccana
(TAR6; purple); a second parental population includes
the amphigonic individuals from Tetouan (TET, green);
a third one the parthenogenetic females from Sefliane
(SEF) and a female from Targuist (TAR50) (red), and a
fourth one the two males with cn = 53 (TAR43, TAR47;
yellow). All other individuals are not assigned with certainty, and therefore are considered of hybrid origin
from between two or more parental populations.
It should be noted that the groupings obtained with
the Bayesian analysis mirror the results of the Factorial
Correspondence Analysis (FCA; see additional file 1);
moreover FCA showed that two groups are the most
divergent among the analyzed samples (i.e. TET bisexuals and TAR/SEF females). For this reason, we proceeded in our analysis by forcing the software to accept
K = 2. Using this sub-optimal setting, the software
brings together individuals in two populations only,
which are formed by the elements that are most genetically pure and different, and therefore better indicating
specimens with admixed genome. Actually, 10 more
runs with K = 2 (burn-in 50,000; 100,000 iterations;
admixture model, no prior information) were made
without C. maroccana (its presence “pushes” the other
individuals to the top of the chart, as it assumes an outgroup behavior; see additional file 1). The two parental
populations identified with this analysis (data not
shown) include on one side the amphigonic C. felicitatis,
on the other side the parthenogenetic females from
Sefliane (both C. soumiae and C. gallica) and Targuist
(C. soumiae); both were assigned to one of the two parental populations with a probability equal or close to
100%. In addition, two of the three parthenogenetic C.
gallica from Oued Laou were assigned to the geographically close population of Tetouan (the diploid C. felicitatis, with a probability of just over 80%), while the
remaining one (OLA1) is shown to have a hybrid genotype. All the androgenetic males (both cn = 53 and

Page 6 of 15

cn = 35) show an admixed genome. Moreover, two C.
gallica specimens (TAF3 and TAF4) as well as a single
C. soumiae (CHA26) are indeed admixed too.
On the whole, the pattern of admixture is quite puzzling: although most of the specimens do not show up
hybrid genomes, in both C. gallica and C. soumiae we
found specimens with statistically-supported admixed
genomes. Moreover, C. androgenes males are found,
indeed, to have admixed genomes at least with K = 2.

Discussion
To disentangle Clonopsis evolution, we proceeded with
mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analysis, with the aim
of finding traces of possible hybridization/polyploidization events, as was the case with other analyzed stick
insects ([4] and references therein). Mitochondrial cox2
gene analysis showed extremely low haplotype variability, except for C. maroccana, which was very different
from all other sampled Clonopsis, in line with its highly
differentiated karyotype. The mtDNA data for the
remaining Clonopsis seemed to support a very recent
divergence, as they did not allow splitting of the two
parthenogens C. gallica and C. soumiae. On the other
hand, AFLP markers showed a good genetic differentiation and distinct groups were detected (K = 4; Figure
3B): one is C. maroccana (purple color), thus confirming
mtDNA data; another group is the bisexual C. felicitatis
(green) which appears to be a well-defined taxon; a
third group (red) is formed by specimens of both C. gallica (cn = 54) and C. soumiae (cn = 72), with no relation
to the different chromosome number. The other C. gallica and C. soumiae specimens showed quite a variable
genetic constitution, with either admixed or nonadmixed genotypes. On the whole, C. gallica and C. soumiae parthenogens did not appear to be homogeneous
taxa, but rather a mix of strains of polyphyletic origin,
either hybrids or not. Moreover, an admixed hybrid origin seemed to be confirmed for C. androgenes: the male
with cn = 35 is invariably admixed, while a hybrid origin
of cn = 53 males is supported only for K = 2 (data not
shown). This is strong evidence that complex cladogenetic events could account for the observed Clonopsis
genetic structure.
When trying to describe Clonopsis evolution, there is a
preliminary observation to make: as already mentioned,
C. felicitatis, C. gallica and C. soumiae seem to be a reasonable polyploid series with n = 18, i.e. they all have
karyotypes that are exact multiples of 18 chromosomes
(36 for C. felicitatis, 54 for C. gallica and 72 for C. soumiae). This would be hard to explain without hypothesizing that polyploidization events originated
parthenogenetic C. gallica and C. soumiae strains, since
it would be extremely odd to imagine that parthenogenetic forms, with karyotypes that are the exact multiple

of the closest bisexual species, could have formed other
than through polyploidy. Moreover, in stick insects the
haploid chromosome number generally ranges from 16
to 20 [24]. For the above mentioned reasons, we feel
confident in assuming that polyploidization might have
had a major role in Clonopsis evolution, as in that of
many other stick insects.
Increases in ploidy level can be achieved by means of
several mechanisms during gametogenesis (i.e. pre-meiotic, intra-meiotic or post-meiotic restitution). Invariably,
the outcome of these mechanisms is the production of
diploid gametes, which, after fertilization, would increase
the ploidy of the progeny. Such mechanisms may also
include some meiosis (automixis) or not (apomixis), and

have already been experimentally confirmed in several
complexes [25]. In any case, whenever these mechanisms were confirmed, a clear polyploid karyotype would
be recovered.
However, as mentioned before, C. gallica and C. soumiae look morphologically diploid on careful analysis of
their karyotypes: actually, although most chromosomes
are quite similar, at least some of the biggest cannot be
arranged in triplets or quadruplets (see [5] for detailed
pictures of Clonopsis karyotypes). As a consequence, if
we accept that both C. gallica and C. soumiae strains
are polyploids with diploid karyotypes, then they must
have experienced large genome restructuring events,
leading to diploidization.

Diploidization of polyploid genomes has been
observed in autopolyploids and, most commonly, in
allopolyploids. However, despite the increasing evidence
of polyploidization as a major force in evolution, the
molecular basis of diploidization is far from being fully
understood, although many mechanisms have been suggested to date. For instance, tetraploid salmonids are the
best-documented case of animal diploidization in autopolyploids: the process proposed took a long time and
seems to be still in progress, since it is suggested that it
started when, or shortly after, the family originated
about 25-100 Mya [26]. This certainly seems not to be
the case of Clonopsis, because its low mtDNA variability
appears to be an indication of a recent origin of the
parthenogenetic strains; therefore, a much quicker
diploidization process has to be hypothesized.
Diploidization has been commonly related to hybridization events, followed by a massive rearrangement of
the genome [27]. The process, as summarized in [28],
might be as follows: allopolyploids may arise by hybridization of two individuals whose chromosomes (the socalled homoeologues) have similar gene order, but differ
in repetitive DNA content (such as in closely-related
species or races); after hybridization, homoeologues can
go through the loss or gain of genes and repetitive
sequences, as well as structural chromosome translocations, thus increasing their morphological divergence.
Actually, the extent of structural rearrangements and
sequence elimination may vary: the more extensive the
rearrangements are, the more distinct the chromosomes
will be, so that if the distinctions become extensive
enough the species will effectively gain a diploid set.
In more detail, data from [29] on non-coding
sequences suggest a faster way to diploidization, in
which a quick DNA elimination, just after polyploidization, takes place: they found that specific sequences
named CSSs (Chromosome-Specific Sequences) and
GSSs (Genome-Specific Sequences) are eliminated, and
suggested a regulatory role for such sequences in the
physical chromosome behavior. This leads to the conclusion that the appearance of new polyploid species
may be followed by deep genomic changes in a short
time, and polyploidization may be an accelerating evolutionary factor itself [29]; indeed, the finding that one
genome can eliminate up to 14% of its loci in a single
generation shows that allopolyploidy may lead to the
establishment of a new species in one step, and that
large-scale genomic rearrangements can occur very
quickly [30].
Might this be the case with Clonopsis? Compared to
autopolyploidization, allopolyploidization is a revolutionary event generating two genomic “shocks” in the
newly-formed individual, namely hybridity and polyploidy: the former implies that two different genomes

Page 8 of 15

are brought together in the same nucleus, the latter
results in duplicated genomes. Consequently, the genomes undergo a series of irreversible reorganizations,
like structural re-patterning of chromosomes [31],
changes at sequence level, regulation of gene expression,
activation of transposons [32], and amplification, reassortment or elimination of highly repetitive sequences
and low copy sequences [33]. It is reasonable to deduce
that epigenetic modifications between genomes may
contribute to homologous chromosome recognition and
cytological diploidization [34].
In most cases, the loss of DNA in allopolyploids is
unidirectional, with the elimination of fragments from
one parental genome only [35]; incidentally, if applied to
Clonopsis parthenogens, this would explain why AFLP
markers have lost most (but not all) traces of the hybridizations leading to C. gallica and C. soumiae strains.
However, the main force that drives karyotype diploidization is its higher fitness, because diploidization
solves conflicts in the hybrid genome, as well as pairing
problems during meiosis. In fact, most of the known
diploidized hybrids so far retain meiosis [28-30,33,34].
This seems not to be completely true for the parthenogenetic C. gallica and C. soumiae: in fact, in C. gallica
time-scheduled investigations on laid eggs [36] revealed
that both European and Moroccan specimens reproduce
by apomictic parthenogenesis, albeit of two different
kinds, i.e. a meiotic-like mode with two divisions (likely
entraining an intra-meiotic structural chromosome doubling) is realized in European specimens of C. gallica,
while a unique mitosis is required to allow embryo
onset in Moroccan C. gallica. Like Moroccan C. gallica,
C. soumiae is invariably maturing eggs through a unique
mitosis. Therefore, even though some meiotic features
are still retained in some strains, most Clonopsis make
use of mitosis to produce their parthenogenetic progeny.
So, at present, a diploid karyotype seems not to be a significant advantage for Clonopsis. We can still speculate
that all Clonopsis hybrids retained some meiosis at the
very beginning when they first arose, as happens now in
European strains, thus driving fast diploidization, but it
seems hard to explain why some strains, once diploidized, soon after lost their meiosis, as should have happened in North African Clonopsis. We also tested the
specimens for the presence of sex-distorting bacteria,
such as Rickettsiales [35], that might have induced
parthenogenesis, but we had no evidence for their presence in Clonopsis (data not shown).
Reconstructing Clonopsis micro-evolutionary events

As mentioned, pre-meiotic, intra-meiotic or post-meiotic restitution by endomitosis might explain the ploidy
increase in Clonopsis. To account for this, we may
hypothesize that the first step to Clonopsis

Milani et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/258

parthenogenetic strains might be a diploid hybrid, showing two complete series of chromosomes of two different species. This hybrid may produce diploid gametes as
the outcome of one of the above-mentioned mechanisms of altered meiosis. This may explain how C. soumiae originated: in fact, the fusion of two genetically
identical diploid hybrid gametes will produce a tetraploid individual, with a diploid-looking karyotype, if the
parental chromosomes are different enough. If this is
the case, some admixed genome constitution should be
easily detectable in C. soumiae, which is not always true,
judging from some of our AFLP data (Figure 3). On the
other hand, C. gallica is harder to explain: in fact, if we
admit its origin through diploid gametes, its triploid
number should be achieved only through the fusion of
one haploid and one diploid gamete. In this case, however, some chromosomes will be represented once, the
others twice, which seems not to be the case of C. gallica. Therefore, we think that the morphologically
diploid structure of Clonopsis karyotypes ought to be
looked for in a different cause.
Another observation might help in approaching the
Clonopsis puzzle from another point of view: stick insect
eggs are polyspermic and, after fertilization, selective
elimination of either egg or sperm nuclei have been
recorded in embryo development [37]. Moreover, the
presence of more than two haploid sets in the same
genome is quite common in stick insects, and triploids
are often produced, such as in Pynackeria and Bacillus
taxa (reviewed in [6]). Therefore, we are allowed to
hypothesize that a “triploid intermediate female” may be
the first step in producing Clonopsis polyploid parthenogens. The proposed process is reported in Figure 4.
First, we have to mention that the genome of such
hypothetical triploid females might be either derived
from both sperm and egg nuclei (by syngamy), or
from sperm nuclei only, via androgenesis. In androgenesis, the embryo nuclear genome originates from
either the doubling of a sperm head or the fusion of
two (or more) sperm heads, while the egg pronucleus
does not contribute to the genome of the embryo [7].
Androgenesis was first shown in stick insects, and
afterwards found in several species of freshwater Corbicula clams [38-40], and in the cypress tree Cupressus dupreziana [41,42]. At this stage we do not have
clear-cut data to assess whether the hypothetical triploid female derived via androgenesis or syngamy;
however the low genetic differentiation in Clonopsis
mtDNA might be taken as an indication that parthenogens arose by androgenesis from the same maternal
ancestor (i.e. C. felicitatis), by keeping its mtDNA and
embodying nuclear genomes of extinct or still
unsampled paternal bisexuals, as observed in Pijnackeria tetraploids [4].

Page 9 of 15

Whether originating from syngamy or androgenesis,
the “triploid intermediate female” could be either hybrid
or not (i.e. it may have chromosome sets derived from
the same or different parental species or races), although
hybridity would better explain the alteration of meiosis
and parthenogenetic reproduction. In any case, such triploid females must have had problems in correctly segregating chromosomes, since trivalents are expected to
occur during meiosis of oocytes I. However, in most
cases, chromosome triplets are likely to segregate in a
2⇔1 way, i.e. 2 chromosomes go to one pole and the
third goes to the opposite one, a behavior that has been
observed many times in triploids [43,44]. This generates
a vast array of different chromosome segregations in
oocytes II. Two of them are particularly interesting.
Case A (Figure 4) segregates two complete series of
chromosomes into the oocyte II, while the third one
ends up in the first polocyte. A cytologically normal second meiotic division follows, and an anaphasic restitution doubles the chromosome number, likely by the
suppression of the second polocyte degeneration (i.e.
retention of the polar body). Anaphasic restitution is
not new to stick insects, and it has also been found in
many other parthenogens [45]. As a result of this process, the new egg gets a tetraploid chromosome number,
chromosomes in pairs and the karyotype with a diploid
look, while its genome constitution is de facto tetraploid.
Such an egg will eventually develop into a parthenogenetic female. We suggest that C. soumiae strains (cn =
72) arose directly in this way. In the second scenario, as
reported in scheme B (Figure 4), half of the trivalents
are segregating 2⇔1, the other half 1⇔2. The resulting
oocyte II is therefore aneuploid, i.e. it has half chromosomes represented twice, while the other half once only.
As above, a normal second division follows, and an anaphasic restitution produces an egg that has a triploid
chromosome number, but again the karyotype looks
diploid and the new genome carries either tetraploid or
diploid loci. Eggs like these might have produced C. gallica strains (cn = 54).
If this is the process that generated Clonopsis parthenogenetic strains, it is worth noting that their karyotype
diploid-look is just the effect of anaphasic restitution,
but their genomes still remain largely (C. gallica) or
totally (C. soumiae) polyploid. This may also account for
the partial or complete suppression of meiosis in these
strains, because multivalents may occur in such complex
multi-copy genomes experiencing large homology
regions between non-homologues. As a matter of fact,
this is completely different from the above-mentioned
diploidization mechanisms, which are processes that
restore meiosis after polyploidization.
Unfortunately, sizes and centromere positions are
similar for most Clonopsis chromosomes and it is not

Figure 4 Diploidization mechanism: origin of parthenogens. The proposed fast diploidization mechanism through an “intermediate triploid
female” with altered meiosis and trivalent segregation. Scheme A: two complete series of chromosomes are segregated to the oocyte II, while
the remaining one ends up in the first polocyte. A cytologically normal second meiotic division follows, and an anaphasic restitution (i.e.
retention of the polar body) doubles the chromosome number, by the suppression of the second polocyte degeneration. As a result of this
process, the oocyte has a tetraploid chromosome number, but chromosomes are in pairs and the karyotype has a perfect diploid look
(hypothesis for C. soumiae parthenogen origin). Scheme B: half of the trivalents are segregating 2⇔1, the other half 1⇔2. The resulting oocyte II
is therefore aneuploid, i.e. half of the chromosomes are present twice, but the other half only once. A normal second division follows, and an
anaphasic restitution produces an egg that has a triploid chromosome number, but again the karyotype looks structurally diploid (hypothesis for
C. gallica strains origin).

Milani et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:258

easy to spot whether they are two or fourfold by standard karyotyping, while fine banding techniques that
would help in this case have still not been developed for
stick insects. Moreover, subsequent minor chromosome
changes and/or differences in condensation due to epigenetic modifications of chromatin may further blur
chromosome morphology. However, many observations
still point to the fact that the proposed process might
have happened in Clonopsis, since this hypothesis seems
to fit very well with the data we have obtained from this
molecular analysis. First of all, given that a hypothetical
Clonopsis triploid hybrid female may segregate 18 trivalents with all possible 2⇔1 segregations, it is interesting to
calculate the percentage of eggs with the A or the B constitutions: 7.63x10 -4 % of the eggs will be as in case A,
while 18.5% will be like B. Therefore, both events are not
unlikely and might have happened many times, because a
single Clonopsis female lays up to 100 eggs and each population may contain hundreds of females. Moreover, the B
segregation scheme is surprisingly common, so that, each
time a triploid female does eventually appear, it could
easily result in a new C. gallica strain. This fits our data,
which clearly support a rich polyphyletic origin of C. gallica parthenogens. Another surprising observation is well
explained by this hypothesis: if both C. gallica and C. soumiae strains may arise at the same time even from a single
triploid female, then they can be largely identical using
AFLP loci even if their karyotypes are different, a finding
that we observed in the Sefliane (SEF) population and that
is hard to explain with other hypotheses.
We may recall that the full suppression of meiosis in
Clonopsis parthenogens may have occurred at a later
stage, also because the hypothetical triploid Clonopsis
female was possibly a hybrid between races or subspecies, thus having homoeologues in its genome. It is
worth noting that homoeologues are not easily detected
by AFLP markers, because they mainly differ in repetitive DNA content (i.e. copy number). This could explain
why Clonopsis unisexuals do appear, either admixed or
not, depending on the overall nucleotide divergence of
the homoeologues carried by each “intermediate triploid
female” that gave rise to the strains.
It still remains debatable how, among many different
combinations resulting from trivalent differential segregation patterns, only cn = 54 and cn = 72 Clonopsis
parthenogenetic strains survived: we may suggest that
some sort of genome balancing is implied here, which
made cn = 54 and 72 strains able to survive better as
parthenogens. Moreover, specific epigenetic genome
silencing might also be conceivable in balancing the
hybrid genome made up of 54 and 72 chromosomes.
The complete lack of data on genetic and epigenetic
characterizations of phasmids prevents us from addressing this point better.

Page 11 of 15

Following our hypothesis, we might also speculate on
how androgens may have originated. It is quite well
known that, even within all-female diploid strains, stick
insect males (which are X0) may arise through accidental loss of one sex chromosome, as observed in Bacillus
[7]. An accidental sex chromosome loss could well
explain the cn = 53 androgen, which would therefore
derive directly from a C. gallica strain: actually, following the B scheme in Figure 5, we may suppose that the
accidental loss of an X chromosome produced a male
individual with suppressed meiosis, which started the
cn = 53 androgenetic clone. On the other hand, the
case of the cn = 35 male is harder to explain. First of
all, it must be noted that AFLP loci exclude its direct
derivation from C. felicitatis; moreover its suppressed
meiosis, in spite of a diploid chromosome constitution,
may be an indication of a hybrid origin. Actually, we
may speculate that such males might have appeared in
two different ways, i.e. by direct hybridization of species/forms leading to a diploid hybrid male, or by incorrect X segregation during the meiosis I of the
“intermediate triploid female” of the A scheme, as
depicted in Figure 5. Both ways might give rise to a
diploid male with cn = 35 with suppressed meiosis
because of its hybrid constitution. It is evident that,
although some differences do exist, both cn = 35 and
53 males share most of their AFLP alleles, a case that
strongly recalls Sefliane polyploid females and which
may indicate that both arose from a single “triploid
intermediate female”, likely within a common process
such as the one proposed above.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we here suggest that C. gallica and
C. soumiae parthenogens might have arisen many times
through “intermediate triploid females” with altered
meiosis. The mechanism proposed here explains all the
data we have obtained so far, and, quite significantly, its
simple process does not require any new ad-hoc cytological mechanism, since all the proposed steps have been
observed many times in closely related stick insects.
Given the complexity of Clonopsis micro-evolutionary
history, the detailed events leading to each strain are
not easy to disentangle at the moment, and this would
require larger collecting campaigns in Northern Africa
and Europe. Moreover, a genome characterization of
Clonopsis, which unfortunately is not available, would
better support our hypothesis, and a fine FISH hybridizing technique, such as “chromosome painting”, would
also help in supporting the proposed model. Our
micro-evolutionary scenario for Clonopsis needs more
in-depth analyses to be tried out, nevertheless we feel
that this is a sound “working hypothesis” that merits
further study.

female” with altered meiosis and trivalent segregation. Scheme A: cn = 35 androgen might have appeared or by direct hybridization of species/
forms, or by incorrect X segregation during the meiosis I of the triploid female. Both ways might give rise to a male with cn = 35, with a
numerically and structurally diploid karyotype, but with a suppressed meiosis, an indication of a possible hybrid origin. Scheme B: cn = 53
androgen would derive directly from a C. gallica-like strain: the accidental loss on an X chromosome produced a male individual with
suppressed meiosis, which started the cn = 53 androgenetic clone, with numerically triploid karyotype, but with diploid structure.

Methods
Sample collection

Figure 1 shows collection localities, with population
acronyms for the new Moroccan samples, and also
reports additional locations in Portugal, Spain and Italy
from which some reference C. gallica specimens were
utilized. North African forms are particularly hard to
collect in a pretty unsafe area such as Northern Algeria
and the Rif area of Morocco. At any rate, in 2006, we
were able to collect in the Rif area, which is probably
the spreading centre of Clonopsis. North African sample
included Moroccan C. gallica, the bisexual C. felicitatis
(cn = 36/35, XX/X0), the all-female C. soumiae (cn =
72), two strains of ameiotic males, C. androgenes-35 and
C. androgenes-53, with cn = 35 (X0) or 53 (X0), and a
single C. maroccana (cn = 22/21, XX/X0) female, used
as outgroup when needed (see below). They were characterized for mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase
subunit 2 (cox2, partial sequence). North African populations were also analyzed using AFLP. Detailed data are
reported in Table 1.
Mitochondrial DNA analysis

Total genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy
Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Partial sequence of cox2
was amplified and directly sequenced according to [19].
The primers utilized were TL2-J-3034 and TK-N-3785
[46]. Sequencing covered 639 bp coding for 213 aminoacids of the Cytochrome Oxidase subunit 2 and corresponds to the gene region sequenced in several insect
orders [47]. All sequences were aligned with the Clustal
algorithm of MEGA 3.1 [48]. A Bayesian analysis was
performed using MrBayes 3.1 (20,000,000 generations;
[49]) (Figure 2A). A Templeton’s network [50] was
obtained with TCS 1.21 [51] (Figure 2B). Bacillus
grandii grandii, Bacillus atticus atticus and Bacillus rossius redtenbacheri were utilized as outgroups in phylogenetic reconstructions based on cox2.
AFLP markers

DNA fingerprinting with selectively neutral AFLP markers was produced according to [52], using EcoRI/TaqI
as restriction enzymes. After a preliminary screening,
three highly polymorphic primer pairs carrying ACA/
AAC, ACA/AAG and ATG/AAC as selective nucleotides were assayed on 100 ng of total genomic DNA.
AFLP fragments were separated by electrophoresis on
8% polyacrylamide gels and the polymorphisms were
visually scored as dominant markers, coding with 1 the
presence and with 0 the absence of the band. Markers
with more than 5% of missing data were removed from
the definitive dataset.

The genetic relationships at individual level were
assessed by the Factorial Correspondence Analysis
(FCA), a statistical method enabling analysis and
description graphically and synthetically of two-way or
multi-way contingency tables. For this, the software
GENETIX 4.05 was used [53] (see additional file 1).
To assess the molecular structure of Moroccan Clonopsis we used a model-based bayesian procedure as
implemented in the software STRUCTURE 2.2 [54,55].
This model enables identification of the K (unknown)
populations of individuals, and the probabilistic assignment of each individual to one or several populations if
its genotype indicates that it is admixed. The model
assumes that the loci are unlinked and at linkage equilibrium. STRUCTURE version 2.2 calculates a logarithmic
probability for the data being assigned to a given number of clusters, based on minimizing linkage between
clusters, and maximizing linkage within.
A Minimum Evolution tree (ME, Figure 3A) based on
AFLP markers was calculated using PAUP 4.0 [56]; support for each node was obtained using bootstrap (1000
replicates, [57]). Given the results of cox2, C. maroccana
has been used as an outgroup in the AFLP-based tree,
since more phylogenetically distant species (such as
Bacillus ssp.) would not be easily comparable using
AFLP markers, which are more suitable for genetic analyses of population strains or closely related species [20],
and have been proved to be resolving for phylogenetic
structure in rapidly evolving systems [19].

Additional material
Additional file 1: Factorial Correspondence Analysis. The genetic
relationships at individual level were assessed by Factorial
Correspondence Analysis (FCA), using the GENETIX software. Acronyms as
in Table 1. Firstly, FCA analysis was run on the complete matrix of AFLP
data. The three-dimensional graph (not shown) highlights the fact that
the presence of TAR6 - i.e. C. maroccana - “pushes” the other individuals
to the top of the chart, as it assumes an outgroup behavior, thus
confirming that C. maroccana is genetically very different from the other
specimens included in the study. Therefore, we ran FCA excluding C.
maroccana from the dataset to better trace relationships between the
remaining specimens. The graph obtained is reported here. As expected,
this time the individuals occupy three-dimensional space in a more
homogeneous way. In more detail, amphigonic Clonopsis from Tetouan
(TET) form a large cloud at one pole, while the parthenogenetic females
of Targuist (TAR) and Sefiane (SEF) are at the opposite one, along the
first axis (25.3% of the total inertia); finally, the remaining individuals
spread over the intermediate space between these two extremes, almost
in seamless continuity. In addition, the two androgenetic males with 53
chromosomes from Targuist (TAR43 and TAR47) are separated from the
other individuals along axis 2 (10.65% of the total inertia), while the third
axis (7.42%) tends to split two amphigonic males from Tetouan (TET56
and TET57) from the group, together with the parthenogenetic females
cn = 54 from Oued Laou (OLA). It can also be noted that TET, OLA, and
TAF samples form coherent groups, while TAR and SEF specimens are
grouped in several subsets, thus indicating that some different genetic
entities were sampled in the same localities.
