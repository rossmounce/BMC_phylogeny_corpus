Abstract
Background: Tuberculosis persists as a public health problem in Honduras. A better knowledge of the molecular
characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains will contribute to understand the transmission dynamics of the
disease within the country. The aim of this study was to provide an insight of the genetic biodiversity of M.
tuberculosis clinical isolates collected in Honduras between 1994 and 2002. Genotyping was performed using
spoligotyping and RFLP. The spoligotypes obtained were compared with the SITVIT2 proprietary database of the
Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe.
Results: Spoligotyping grouped 84% of the isolates into 27 clusters (2 to 43 strains per cluster). Of the 44 shared
international types (SITs) identified among the Honduran stains, 8 SITs were newly identified either within the
present study or after match with an orphan type previously identified in the SITVIT2 database. In addition, 16
patterns corresponded to orphan, previously unreported isolates.
The Latin American Mediterranean (LAM) lineage was the most common in this study; 55% of the strains belonged
to this family. Other genotypes found were Haarlem (16%), T (16%), X-clade (6%), Unknown signature (5%) and S
(1%). Only one Beijing strain was identified (0.5%).
We observed a high degree of diversity after characterizing the 43 isolates belonging to the main spoligotyping
cluster (SIT 33, LAM3) with IS6110-RFLP. A total of 35 different RFLP-fingerprints were detected, of which 6 patterns
corresponded to the same number of clusters comprising 14 strains.
Conclusions: The findings obtained in this study show that tuberculosis transmission in Honduras is due to
modern M. tuberculosis lineages with high level of biodiversity.

Background
Honduras is the heart of Central America. It has a population of 8 million inhabitants [1] and is located between
the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean sharing boundaries with Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. As in
many other low-income countries, tuberculosis (TB) is a
major public health issue. Although the reported TB incidence rate has decreased from 72/100,000 in 1993 to 37/
100,000 in 2008 [2], TB control remains a priority. A better understanding of TB transmission in the country
could help to identify risk settings as well as to improve
contact tracing.

Since the early 1990’s new DNA-fingerprinting tools
have been developed to improve TB case detection and
control [3-5]. Molecular typing techniques have been
used to detect and follow the spread of individual strains
of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC),
complementing conventional epidemiological methods
and allowing the study of transmission dynamics.
Among these techniques is the restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP), it uses the insertion
sequence IS6110 as a probe to enable strain differentiation, and has been considered the gold standard for genotyping the MTC [6].
Another molecular fingerprinting method is spoligotyping, a robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technique which relies on the detection of

43 short non-repetitive spacer sequences located in the
Direct Repeat (DR) region of the MTC genome [7].
A first overview of the population structure of MTC
strains circulating in Honduras was reported in a study
conducted in 1996 [8]. In this study, a high degree of
strain diversity, based on RFLP molecular fingerprinting
was seen among 84 M. tuberculosis isolates obtained
from the same number of Honduran pulmonary-TB
patients.
The purpose of this study was to provide a better
insight of the biodiversity of Honduran MTC isolates
using the spoligotyping as the genotyping technique.

Methods
Study population

The study population consisted of 206 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Honduran TB patients.
These were collected at two different time points.
Eighty-seven strains (group I) were isolated between
1994 and 1998 at the Instituto Nacional Cardiopulmonar (INCP), the national reference hospital for lung and
heart diseases. Part of this material was also included in
the first molecular typing study carried out in Honduras
[8]. The remaining 119 strains (group II) were collected
countrywide in 2002 as part of the National Survey of
Tuberculosis Drug-Resistance [9], coordinated by the
Honduran National TB Reference Laboratory (NRL).
All strains were isolated on Lowenstein Jensen (LJ)
medium and confirmed to be of the MTC using standard biochemical tests [10] (niacin production, catalase
activity and nitrate reduction). The drug-susceptibility
profile of the isolates belonging to group I was determined at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease
Control (SMI) using the BACTEC 460 system (Becton
Dickinson, Sparks, MD USA) [11], with the following
drug concentrations: rifampicin (RIF) 2.0 μg/ml, isoniazid (INH) 0.2 μg/ml, streptomycin (STM) 4.0 μg/ml and
ethambutol (EMB) 5.0 μg/ml. For the group II isolates,
the proportion method on LJ medium [12] was performed at the Honduran NRL to determine the susceptibility to the first-line drugs. The following critical
concentrations were used: RIF 40 μg/ml, INH 0.2 μg/ml,
STM 4.0 μg/ml, EMB 2.0 μg/ml.
The strains were subsequently sent to the SMI, where
the genotyping was performed.
DNA extraction

All isolates were subculture on LJ medium at SMI. For
spoligotyping, mycobacterial lysates were prepared by
resuspending 2 loops of bacteria in 250 μl of 1 × TE
buffer. After heat-killing the cells at 80°C during 1 hour,
the suspensions were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for
2 minutes. Supernatants were discarded and pellets
resuspended in 500 μl of 150 mM NaCl, These

Page 2 of 9

centrifugation and resuspension steps were repeated.
The final pellet was then dissolved in 25 μl of 1 × TE
buffer.
For RFLP typing, genomic DNA was obtained using
the cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method
[13].
Spoligotyping

All isolates were genotyped with a spoligotyping commercial kit (Isogen Bioscience, BV Maarsen, The Netherlands) according to the protocol previously described
by Kamerbeek et al [7]. Briefly, the DR region of the TB
genome was amplified using primers DRa and DRb, and
the amplified biotinylated products hybridized to a set
of 43 oligonucleotides covalently bound to a membrane.
The hybridized PCR products were then incubated with
a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate and the membrane
then exposed to chemiluminescence (Amersham ECL
Direct™ nucleic acid labeling and detection system, GE
Healthcare Limited, UK) and exposed on an X-ray film
(Amersham Hyperfilm™ ECL, GE Healthcare Limited,
UK) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The
X-ray film was developed using standard photochemical
procedures after 20 minutes exposure. DNA extracts of
M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis BCG were used as
controls.
The patterns obtained were analyzed using the BioNumerics software version 5.1 (Applied Maths, Sint-MartensLatem, Belgium). A cluster was defined as two or more
strains sharing identical spoligotyping patterns. Spoligotypes in binary format were converted to an octal code for
comparison with the SITVIT2 proprietary database of the
Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe, which is an updated version of the previously released SpolDB4 database [14,15].
Database comparison and geographical distribution of
spoligotypes

The obtained octal spoligotypes codes were entered into
the SITVIT2 database. In this database, two or more
patient isolates sharing identical spoligotype patterns are
define as SIT (Spoligotype International Type) whilst
single spoligopatterns are defined as “orphan” isolates.
Major phylogenetic clades were assigned according
to signatures provided in SpolDB4. The SpolDB4 defines
62 genetic lineages/sub-lineages [14] and includes
specific signatures for various M. tuberculosis complex
members such as M. bovis, M. caprae, M. microti,
M. canettii, M. pinipedii, and M. africanum, as well as
including rules for defining the major lineages/sublineages for M. tuberculosis sensu stricto. At the time of
the present study, SITVIT2 contained more than 3000
SITs with global genotyping information on around
74,000 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from 160 countries of origin.

The worldwide distribution of predominant spoligotypes found in this study (SITs representing 4 or more
strains) was further investigated using the SITVIT2
database, and regions with ≥5% of a given SIT as compared to their total number in the SITVIT2 database,
were recorded. The various macro-geographical regions
and sub-regions were defined according to the specifications of the United Nations [16].
The same criteria were used to compare the distribution by country of predominant SITs (countries with
≥5% of a given SIT). The three-letters country codes
were used as defined in the ISO 3166 standard [17].

and clustering by spoligotyping was assessed using Yatescorrected Chi square (X2) or Fisher exact (2-tailed) tests;
p- values < 0.05 were considered significant. Odds ratios
(OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. Statistical analysis of mean ages was performed
using the Student’s t- test.
Ethical considerations

This study received approval from the Ethical Committee
in Biomedical Research of the Scientific Research Unit, of
the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras.

Results
Comparison of spoligotypes families and principal
genetic groups

The overall distribution of strains, according to the
major M. tuberculosis spoligotyping-defined families,
was compared to the principal genetic groups (PGG)
based on KatG463-gyrA95 polymorphisms [18]. The
comparison was inferred from the reported linking of
specific spoligotype patterns to PGG1, 2 or 3 [19-21].
Restriction fragment length polymorphism

The standard RFLP protocol [6] was used to further
characterize 43 strains found to belong to a single spoligotype cluster. Briefly, the genomic mycobacterial DNA
was digested by the restriction enzyme Pvu II and separated by gel electrophoresis. Following southern blot,
samples were hybridized with the probe IS6110 and
detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham ECL direct™
nucleic acid labeling and detection system, GE Healthcare Limited, UK) using X-ray films (Amersham Hyperfilm™ ECL, GE Healthcare Limited, UK).
The M. tuberculosis strain 14323 was used as an external marker for the comparison of patterns and the BioNumerics software was used to analyze the patterns
obtained. A dendrogram was constructed to show the
degree of similarity among the strains using the unweighted pair group method of arithmetic average
(UPGMA) and the Jaccard index (1% tolerance, 0.5%
optimization). Two or more strains with exactly the
same fingerprint were defined as an RFLP cluster.
Epidemiological information

General epidemiological data such as sex, age, geographic origin, HIV status, previous history of TB and
drug-susceptibility profile was retrieved from laboratory
records and/or medical files, using a standardized
questionnaire.
Statistical analysis

Epi Info™ version 3.5.1 (Centers for Disease Control,
Atlanta, USA) was used for the statistical analysis of the
data. The association between demographic characteristics

Spoligotyping results

The 206 M. tuberculosis isolates from this study belonged
to one of 60 different spoligotype patterns. Sixteen patterns corresponded to orphan strains that were unique
among more than 74,000 strains recorded in the SITVIT2 database (Additional file 1) whilst 44 patterns, from
190 patient isolates, corresponded to shared-types, i.e.
they had an identical pattern shared with two or more
patient isolates worldwide (within this study, or matching
another strain in the SITVIT2 database). An SIT number
was attributed to each pattern according to the SITVIT2
database. As shown in additional file 2, among the 44
identified SITs, a total of 36 SITs (containing 173 isolates) matched a pre-existing shared type in the SITVIT2
database, whereas 8 SITs (containing 17 isolates) were
new, either within the present study or after a match
with an orphan in the database.
Among the 60 spoligotypes patterns characterized in
the present study, 27 patterns corresponding to clusters
with 2-43 isolates per cluster were identified, accounting
for a very high clustering rate of 84% (173/206).
Linking the spoligotyping results and clade definitions
to the distribution of clinical isolates within PGG1 versus PGG2/3 (the latter being easily characterized by the
lack of spacers 33-36), showed that TB in Honduras is
exclusively caused by modern tubercle bacilli, with SITs
commonly found in USA, Europe, South & Central
America, and the Caribbean.
The five predominant spoligotypes in our study were:
SIT33 (LAM3) 20.9% > SIT42 (LAM9) 10.2% > SIT67
(H3) 8.7% > SIT53 (T1) 7.8% > SIT376 (LAM3) 5.8%. A
full description of the predominant spoligotypes found
is shown in Table 1. Latin American-Mediterranean
(LAM) strains constitute the most predominant lineage
in our study, their total number being very high (113/
206, 54.9%) with the following distribution: LAM1
n = 2, LAM2 n = 1, LAM3 n = 72, LAM4 n = 1, LAM6
n = 4, LAM9 n = 33. Other lineages found were Haarlem (H) (34/206, 16.5%) with the following distribution:
H1 n = 8, H2 n = 3, H3 n = 23; the ill-defined T family
(33/206, 16.0%): T with sub-lineage distinction n = 3,

known signatures.
RFLP results

All 43 strains within the main spoligotype cluster,
belonging to the SIT 33 (LAM 3 genotype), were further
characterized using RFLP IS6110. A total of 35 different
fingerprints were identified, of which 29 (67.4%) were
unique patterns. Six clusters with a total of 14 strains
(2 to 3 strains per cluster) were identified (Figure 1).
The average number of IS6110 copies was 12, with a
range of 8-16 copies. Table 2 summarizes the clustered
isolates’ DST profile as well as their main demographic
characteristics.
Population characteristics

Demographic information was available for 203 of the
206 TB cases (98.5%). Overall, 66.5% were male and
33.5% were female and the average age was 37 years

(SD: 17 years) with an age range of 11 to 85 years.
Half of the cases belonged to the 20-40 years age
group. The patients represented all major geographical
regions of the country. The HIV serological status was
known for 36% of the cases; 14.7% were HIV-positive
and 21.2% were HIV-negative. The majority of patients
(95%) had smear-positive pulmonary TB. All 10
patients with extra-pulmonary TB were HIV-positive.
A majority of the patients (56.2%) were new, previously
untreated cases, 8.3% had been previously treated and
in 35.5% of the cases, previous treatment status was
unknown.
One hundred seventy-four isolates (85.7%) were pansusceptible and 29 (14.3%) showed resistance to at least
one of the first-line drugs. Multidrug resistance (MDR),
defined as resistance to at least RIF and INH, was
detected in 8 isolates. Of those, two were also resistant
to EMB, one isolate was also resistant to STM and 2
were additionally resistant to both EMB and STM.
Nineteen strains were monoresistant (5 to INH, 2 to
RIF, 12 to STM) and 2 isolates had other susceptibility

was INH + STM resistant).
The single Beijing strain identified in this sample was
susceptible to all drugs and was isolated from a female
patient, 30 years of age, with pulmonary TB and
unknown HIV status.
The distribution of spoligopatterns was not associated
to gender or geographic origin (Table 3). When analyzing the mean age of patients harboring the predominant
spoligotypes, we found that the mean age of cases
belonging to SIT 33 was not significally different from
the rest of the study population (37.8 vs. 36.9 years old,
p = 0.79), nor was it different when compared to the
mean age of cases belonging to the other predominant
SITs (data not shown).
The distribution of the spoligotype families between
the two groups of isolates characterized was very similar
to the overall distribution within the country, as shown
in Figure 2. The overall proportion of clustered strains
in this study was 84%, with a clustering rate of 80% in
group I isolates and 87% in group II isolates.

Discussion
This study included a total of 206 M. tuberculosis strains
isolated from the same number of patients in Honduras
and were collected during two different time periods
(1994-1998 and 2002). All isolates were spoligotyped in
order to identify the predominant genotypes within this
subpopulation, as well as to compare the distribution of
genotypes to the spoligotypes recorded in the SITVIT2

proprietary database of the Institut Pasteur de la
Guadeloupe.
In Honduras, the LAM family was the most prevalent,
with more than 50% of all patient isolates characterized
belonging to this specific genotype. Thereafter the

Haarlem and T clades were most common. The remaining genotypes contributed to only 13% of all isolates.
These results are similar to previous studies in which
these three genotypes have been seen to be predominant
among TB cases in Mexico [22], South America [23-28]
and the Caribbean [29]. However, there is limited information available regarding Central American MTC isolates, of which most information is based on TB cases
detected among Central American immigrants in United
States [30] and Canada [31]. Therefore, our study is providing a first characterization of the distribution of TB
isolates within Honduras. Establishing such a baseline
distribution of isolates will be useful for future genotyping investigations in Honduras as well as neighboring
Central American countries.
According to the more recent genotype classification,
which is based on large sequence polymorphisms in the
MTC genome [30], the Euro-American lineage comprises the LAM, Haarlem, T and X spoligotypingdefined families. These phylogenetic clades are commonly included in the PGG 2 and 3 described by Sreevatsan et al [18,32]. Indeed, the most predominant
clades in our study comprised PGG2/3 lineages: only 0,
5% of the isolates belonged to PGG1 (ancient lineages)
as compared to 77% to the PGG2/3 (modern lineages).
These findings indicate that ongoing TB transmission
in Honduras is mainly attributable to modern M. tuberculosis lineages. The evolutionary modern LAM-lineage
was the most predominant among all lineages in this
study and, having identified several LAM sub-lineages,
was furthermore characterized by a high level of

biodiversity. Indeed, of the 12 LAM- sub-lineages so far
reported worldwide [14], a total of six (LAM1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
and 9) were identified among this study’s sample of
Honduran TB patient isolates. A level of biodiversity
was also observed within the PGG2/3 clades (X and H);
however this was to a lesser extent. The “T” genotype
has previously been defined to include strains that may
not be classified in one of the established PGG2/3 genotypic lineages [14], was mostly represented in our study
by its T1 sub-lineage.
All the spoligotypes not earlier described (orphans and
new SITs) belong to PGG 2 and 3. The observation that
a minimal number of PGG1 strains such as the EAI,
CAS, Manu, Beijing (with only a single Beijing isolate,
Table 2), M. africanum and M. bovis were identified in
this study is noteworthy.
In Latin America, the prevalence of the Beijing genotype is low [22-25,33,34], especially if compared with
Asian and East-European countries. The presence of
only one, fully-susceptible, Beijing strain in our sample
supports these findings.
To obtain a more complete and precise definition of
isolate clusters, it is recommended to combine at least
two genotyping techniques [35,36]. By using RFLP
IS6110 to further characterize the major cluster identified in our study which comprised isolates from both
group I and II, (the SIT 33 belonging to the LAM
family), we observed a high degree of diversity among
the 43 isolates analyzed. These findings were in agreement with the first genotyping study in Honduras [8].
Interestingly, the only RFLP cluster of MDR strains seen

Rosales et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:208
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/208

in this study belonged to group I, i.e., isolates from the
mentioned first genotyping study [8]. This might indicate that the presence of MDR-TB in the country is due
to acquired resistance.
A limitation within this study was the use of a relatively
small sample size, representing approximately 1% of the
total number of TB cases diagnosed in the country during the same period of time. Such sample size, can underestimate the clustering proportion [37,38]. Nevertheless,
as explained below, we believe that the isolates characterized in this study were most likely representative of the
overall distribution in the country. The isolates collected
in 2002 (group II) were collected and cultured from
smear positive Honduran patients using the cluster sampling method recommended by WHO/IUATLD guidelines for drug-resistance surveys [39]. Isolates in group I
(samples from 1994-1998), although collected at the
INCP in a specific setting, were geographically diverse as
most chronic-diseased patients were referred to the
national hospital from several regions in the country.
As information regarding epidemiological links
between patients as well as risk behaviors could not be
recovered, only a broad description of the genotypes’
distribution within Honduras could be provided in this
study. Another area of interest for further studies would
be to assess the impact of HIV infection on TB transmission dynamics within Honduras.

Conclusions
Spoligotyping has proven to be a useful genotyping
method for the characterization of the MTC population
structure in Honduras. The current study identified the
LAM family as the most common spoligotype circulating in this setting. Furthermore, the high biodiversity, as
demonstrated through the identification of several sublineages usgin RFLP, is a reflection of the LAM-family’s
adaptation to the host population over time.
However, prospective investigations, combined with
contact-tracing and epidemiological linking, are required
in order to obtain a more detailed molecular-epidemiological overview of TB transmission within Honduras.
