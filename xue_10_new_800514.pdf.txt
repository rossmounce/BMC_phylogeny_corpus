host defense to digestion

Abstract
Background: Lysozymes are enzymes that lyse bacterial cell walls, an activity widely used for host defense but also
modified in some instances for digestion. The biochemical and evolutionary changes between these different
functional forms has been well-studied in the c-type lysozymes of vertebrates, but less so in the i-type lysozymes
prevalent in most invertebrate animals. Some bivalve molluscs possess both defensive and digestive lysozymes.
Results: We report a third lysozyme from the oyster Crassostrea virginica, cv-lysozyme 3. The chemical properties of
cv-lysozyme 3 (including molecular weight, isoelectric point, basic amino acid residue number, and predicted
protease cutting sites) suggest it represents a transitional form between lysozymes used for digestion and
immunity. The cv-lysozyme 3 protein inhibited the growth of bacteria (consistent with a defensive function), but
semi-quantitative RT-PCR suggested the gene was expressed mainly in digestive glands. Purified cv-lysozyme 3
expressed maximum muramidase activity within a range of pH (7.0 and 8.0) and ionic strength (I = 0.005-0.01)
unfavorable for either cv-lysozyme 1 or cv-lysozyme 2 activities. The topology of a phylogenetic analysis of cvlysozyme 3 cDNA (full length 663 bp, encoding an open reading frame of 187 amino acids) is also consistent with
a transitional condition, as cv-lysozyme 3 falls at the base of a monophyletic clade of bivalve lysozymes identified
from digestive glands. Rates of nonsynonymous substitution are significantly high at the base of this clade,
consistent with an episode of positive selection associated with the functional transition from defense to digestion.
Conclusion: The pattern of molecular evolution accompanying the shift from defensive to digestive function in
the i-type lysozymes of bivalves parallels those seen for c-type lysozymes in mammals and suggests that the
lysozyme paralogs that enhance the range of physiological conditions for lysozyme activity may provide stepping
stones between defensive and digestive forms.

Background
Lysozymes are ubiquitous antibacterial enzymes that lyse
bacterial cell walls [1]. Lysozymes identified from organisms ranging from bacteriophage to humans share a
muramidase activity cleaving the glycosidic bond
between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine
of peptidoglycan, a major component of the bacterial
cell wall [2-4], but have different amino acid sequences

and biochemical properties. Groups within the lysozyme
superfamily have been classified as phage-type lysozymes, plant lysozymes, i- (invertebrate) type, c(chicken) type, and g- (goose) type lysozymes [1,5-10].
Structural studies reveal that a phylogenetically broad
sample of lysozymes (bacteriophage T4 lysozyme, i-type
Japanese littleneck clam (Tapes japonica or Venerupis
philippinarum in the NCBI Taxonomy database) lysozyme, c-type chicken egg-white lysozyme, and the
g-type goose egg-white lysozyme) all have a similar conformation surrounding the enzyme catalytic center, even
though their amino acid sequences bear little similarity

[11-14]. Given their shared activities and structure, these
different lysozymes appear to have been derived from a
common ancestor [11-13].
The principal function attributed to lysozymes in most
animals is host defense [15]. Lysozymes break down the
bacterial cell wall through the muramidase activity,
resulting in the eventual lysis of bacterial cells [16]. In
addition, soluble fragments released by lysozyme degradation of peptidoglycan may play a role in immunomodulation in both vertebrates and invertebrates [17-19].
Moreover, lysozymes can also exert antimicrobial activity against bacteria and viruses through a mechanism
independent of their muramidase activity [20-28].
In addition to a role in host defense, some c-type lysozymes have developed a second function that also makes
use of their ability to break down bacterial cell walls:
digestion. Lysozymes play a role in digestion in ruminants [29,30], in leaf-eating monkeys [31], in sloths [32],
in a leaf-eating bird [33], and in a variety of arthropods
that feed on bacteria [34-41]. To function as a digestive
enzyme, lysozymes must be expressed at high concentration in the stomach and function in the highly acidic
and protease-rich environment of that organ [10,42]. In
primates, the amino acid replacements that changed
lysozyme host defense function to a digestive function
have been the result of convergent evolution through
positive selection [31,43,44].
The addition of a digestive function to a host defense
function in c-type lysozymes has been paralleled in
i-type lysozymes, the invertebrate type first identified in
the sea star Asteria rubens [45,46]. In bivalve molluscs,
bacteria are known to constitute a significant portion of
the diet [47], and a digestive function for lysozyme has
been suggested in many studies [9,48-55]. In some of
these cases, two lysozyme paralogs co-occur in the same
taxon, one expressed in the gills and mantle and potentially maintaining the ancestral host defense function,
and the other found in digestive gland and presumably
adaptively differentiated for digestive function. The most
fully characterized of these paralogs are two lysozymes,
cv-lysozyme 1 and cv-lysozyme 2, found in the eastern
oyster, Crassostrea virginica [56-58]. Cv-lysozyme-1, a
17,861 Da protein originally purified from oyster hemolymph, has optimal muramidase activity at high ionic
strength and a relatively broad pH range [56]. The
major sites of expression of cv-lysozyme 1 (mantle and
gills), its abundance in hemolymph, and its strong antimicrobial activity all suggest that its main role is in host
defense [58]. On the other hand, cv-lysozyme 2, a
12,984.6 Da protein expressed in the basophil cells of
digestive tubules, was purified from crystalline styles and
digestive glands, suggesting a role in digestion [57].
While cv-lysozyme 2 shows high amino acid sequence
similarity to other bivalve mollusc i-type lysozymes,

Page 2 of 17

including cv-lysozyme 1, it has a lower isoelectric point
and fewer protease-cutting sites in its amino acid
sequence. These differences resemble adaptive changes
found in vertebrate c-type lysozymes that have switched
from host defense to digestive functions [10,42].
While we have previously proposed that i-type lysozymes may have followed a comparable adaptive path
between host defense and digestion as seen in some vertebrate c-type lysozymes [57], the chain of evolutionary
steps involved in the shift between functions remains
unknown. Here, we characterize a third lysozyme from
the eastern oyster, designated cv-lysozyme-3, that reveals
some of these steps. The objectives of this research
were: 1) to characterize the biochemical and antimicrobial properties of this new lysozyme, 2) to determine its
cDNA and amino acid sequence and where this gene is
expressed, 3) to analyze its phylogenetic relationship
with the two other eastern oyster lysozymes (i.e., cvlysozyme 1 and cv-lysozyme 2) as well as with i-type
lysozymes from other bivalve species, and 4) to test
whether selective changes to the protein accompanied
the functional shift between defensive and digestive lysozymes in C. virginica.

Results
Cv-lysozyme 3 purification

A protein with high lysozyme activity but differing in
optimal conditions for the activity from cv-lysozyme 1
and cv-lysozyme 2 was purified from Crassostrea virginica shell liquor using a combination of ion exchange
and size exclusion chromatographies, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and reverse phase HPLC.
We used “lysozyme activity” to refer the M. lysodeikticus
peptidoglycan degrading or muramidase activity in this
research. From the 126.8 g of total proteins prepared
from 20 L of shell liquor, 50.7 mg of proteins with high
lysozyme activity were obtained after fractionation by
chromatographies. HIC separated these proteins into 2
major absorbance peaks, both containing lysozyme activity. After reverse phase HPLC purification of the proteins in the second HIC absorbance peak, a protein
collected from the fraction in a major absorbance peak
at the retention time of 35.4 min showed high lysozyme
activity and was therefore designated cv-lysozyme 3. A
total of 0.45 mg of cv-lysozyme 3 was eventually
purified.
Purified cv-lysozyme 3 appeared as a single band with
a molecular size of 19.9 kDa as determined by SDSPAGE under reducing conditions (Figure 1A). However,
under non-reducing conditions, a second band with a
molecular size of >100 kDa was also detected (Figure
1B). It appeared that the high molecular band represented a cv-lysozyme 3 polymer formed via electrostatic
force, a phenomenon reported for other lysozymes

of 17782.3 Da for the purified cv-lysozyme 3 (Figure 2).
The MALDI measured molecular weight of the reduced
and alkylated cv-lysozyme 3 was 18939 (not shown),
indicating the presence of 20 cysteine residues.
pH and ionic strength conditions for optimal lysozyme
activity

Purified cv-lysozyme 3 expressed more than 90% of its
maximum activity in the pH range of 7.5-8.5 and the
ionic strength range of I = 0.005-0.03 (Figure 3A).
Cv-lysozyme 3 retained high lysozyme activity in

molecule.

Figure 3 pH and ionic strength conditions for optimal
lysozyme activity of purified cv-lysozyme 3. Optimal pH and
ionic strength were determined by measuring cv-lysozyme 3
degrading activity against a Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell wall
suspended in 120 buffers covering a pH range of 3.5-10.5 and ionic
strength range of I = 0.005-0.260 at 25°C (A). The conditions were
compared with that of cv-lysozyme 1 [56] and cv-lysozyme 2 [57]
by superimposing the optimal ionic and pH conditions of all the 3

conditions with a combination of higher pH and lower
ionic strength or a combination of lower pH and higher
ionic strength. In buffers with pH 7.5, for example, cvlysozyme 3 retained more than 60% of its maximum
activity in an ionic strength range of I = 0.01-0.04. In
contrast, when the pH was 5.5 the similar activity level
was detected in the ionic strength range of I = 0.10-0.14
(Figure 3A). Superimposing the optimal activity conditions of cv-lysozyme 3 (Figure 3A) with those of

Xue et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/213

cv-lysozyme 1 [57] and cv-lysozyme 2 [58] indicated that
cv-lysozyme 3 exerted optimal lysozyme activity under
the pH and ionic strength conditions that differ from
that optimal for the other two lysozymes (Figure 3B).
Antibacterial activities

Purified cv-lysozyme 3 at concentration of 12.5 μg/mL
significantly inhibited the growth of E. coli. However, no
significant inhibition activity against V. vulnificus was
detected at the highest cv-lysozyme 3 concentration
tested (i.e., 100 μg/mL). Cv-lysozyme 3 possessed an
antibacterial activity against E. coli stronger than cvlysozyme 2 but weaker than cv-lysozyme 1 and both cvlysozyme 3 and cv-lysozyme 2 have limited effect againt
V. vulnificus (Table 1).
Cv-lysozyme 3 amino acid sequence

The 15 N-terminal amino acid residues of cv-lysozyme 3
determined by Edman degradation were Ser-Asp-AlaPro-Cys-Thr-Asn-Ser-Gly-Gly-Val-Cys-Gln-Asp-Asp. In
addition, the amino acid sequences of 9 peptides derived
from trypsin treatments of purified cv-lysozyme 3 was
determined by tandem mass spectrometry (Table 2).
The mass spectrometry-determined sequence identified
167 of the 169 amino acid residues deduced from the
cDNA sequence, with the Arg36 and the C-terminal Lys
of the deduced sequence missing. Given the finding that

Page 4 of 17

purified cv-lysozyme 3 was 147.3 Da smaller than the
cDNA predicted molecule, the C-terminal Lys was likely
removed during posttranslational modification of the
protein. The protein sequence data reported in this
paper will appear in the Uniprot Knowledgebase under
the accession number P85518.
Cv-lysozyme 3 cDNA sequence

A 663-bp cDNA sequence was identified after 5′- and
3′- RACE reactions. The first ATG codon of the
sequence at position 50-52 was assigned as the translational initiation codon and the TAA codon at position
611-613 as the termination codon. Based on this assignment, a 564 bp open reading frame encoding 187 amino
acid residues was determined. SignalP 3.0 predicted that
the N-terminal 18 amino acid residues of the deduced
sequence constituted a signal peptide. After exclusion of
the predicted signal peptide, the calculated molecular
weight of the cv-lysozyme 3 protein was 17929.6 Da and
the isoelectric point 7.05. Comparison of the amino acid
sequence of cv-lysozyme 3 and that of the two other
eastern oyster lysozymes detected a 68% identity and an
82% similarity with cv-lysozyme 1 and a 64% identity
and a 78% similarity with cv-lysozyme 2. The cDNA
sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence were
registered respectively in the GenBank under accession
numbers AB427186 and BAG41979.

Detection of cv-lysozyme 3 gene expression by
semi-quantitative RT-PCR

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR amplified the specific cv-lysozyme 3 cDNA fragment from digestive tissue, mantle,
labial palps, gills, style-midgut sac, and hemocytes (Figure 4). However, the expression level of digestive glands
was 3.6-15.7 times that of the other tissues, with a mean
expression level of 1.89 in digestive gland compared to
0.52 in mantle, 0.47 in labial palps, 0.39 in gills, 0.34 in
sac-midgut, and 0.12 in hemocytes. In addition, cv-lysozyme 3 mRNA was detected in the digestive glands of
all 5 oysters tested, compared to only 3 out of 5 in mantle, labial palps, gills, and style-midgut sac, and 1 out of
5 in hemocytes. No cv-lysozyme 3 mRNA was detected
in the gonad of any of the 5 oysters analyzed. Cv-

lysozyme 3 expression level differed statistically between
digestive gland and the six other tissue tested (Figure 4).
The specificity of quantitative RT-PCR was confirmed
by sequencing the PCR products.
Alignment and phylogenetic position of cv-lysozyme 3
relative to other bivalve lysozymes

The BAli-Phy alignment of the bivalve i-lysozymes
includes long stretches of residues at the beginning and
end of the proteins that are either species-specific or
align with just a few other homologs (not shown). The
total length of the gapped ClustalW alignment was 298
amino acid residues; for BAli-Phy, it was 410. The conserved core of the bivalve lysozymes, however, includes
a long stretch that is aligned with few indels and with
high probability (Figure 5). Residues included in the
core differ between the alignments based on the two
algorithms. The core ClustalW alignment includes 114
residues, the core Bali-Phy alignment 108. In both cases,
the conserved core includes the two catalytic residues.
Despite differences in the alignment, the phylogenetic
trees based on the two core alignments produced identical topologies with similar Bayesian support values
(Figure 6). The common tree united cv-lysozyme 1, cvlysozyme 3, and a cDNA of unknown function from C.
gigas (referred to here as cg-lysozyme 4) with a clade of
lysozymes that includes the digestive cv-lysozyme 2 with
strong support (BPP ≥ 0.99). The defensive cv-lysozyme
1 is positioned basally, with a well-supported cv-lysozyme 3/cg-lysozyme 4 clade coming off next as the sister to the clade including cv-lysozyme 2. The maximum
likelihood tree (not shown) did not differ significantly
from the Bayesian tree, with the only topological differences being the monophyly of Calyptogena and whether
the Tapes/Calyptogena or Cg-1/Ostrea clade is sister to
the crown group including cv-lysozyme 1, although support values for this tree are lower than for the Bayesian
tree (Figure 6).
Although the function of i-type lysozymes from most
other bivalves has not been demonstrated empirically,

Figure 5 Amino acid sequence alignment of the i-type lysozymes from bivalve molluscs and annelids. Shown are the alignments of 20
known bivalve i-lysozymes, along with those of two annelids (Eisenia andrei and Hirudo medicinalis) based on ClustalW (top) and BAli-Phy
(bottom) algorithms. Boxed sequences indicate the core part of the aligned proteins used for phylogenetic analysis. Residues in front of the
position of the first intron are excluded, with the number of residues deleted indicated. The number of residues omitted from the C-terminus is
also indicated. The catalytic residues occur at E163 and D174 in the ClustalW (top) alignment. Positional numbering is based on the full
alignments.

their isoelectric point and number of trypsin cut sites,
mapped on the inferred phylogenetic tree, show a shift
consistent with a transition from basal defensive function (with higher isoelectric points and more trypsin
cleavage sites) to primarily digestive function (with
lower pIs and fewer trypsin cleavage sites) in the clade
including cv-lysozyme 2 (Figure 6). Cv-lysozyme 3 and
its apparent ortholog cg-lysozyme 4 are unusual (compared to vertebrate lysozymes, e.g. [10]) in possessing a
low pI and relatively few trypsin cleavage sites, despite a
defensive function. The tree topology is consistent with
cv-lysozyme 3 and its C. gigas ortholog representing a
preserved transitional form between the ancestral defensive function within C. viriginica and a derived digestive
one.
The full BAli-Phy alignment revealed a stretch of 4849 amino acid residues with strong similarity between
cv-lysozyme 1, cv-lysozyme 3, and cg-lysozyme 4 that
was not seen in any other bivalve lysozyme. This unique
amino acid sequence was compared to existing databases using BLASTp to ascertain its possible relation
to other known domains. The search obtained three
significant hits (Figure 7), all to repeat motifs from peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) of C. gigas. Cvlysozyme 3 aligned with residues from a similar position
near the N-termini of these three PGRPs (Figure 7) and

also to two additional repeats that followed in each soon
after in each PGRP. Maximum similarity between cvlysozyme 3 and one of the PGRP repeats was nearly
70% (30/43 residues in common, or 69.7%).
Positive election on i-type lysozymes in bivalve molluscs

Values for ω (the ratio of dN, the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, to dS, the
number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous
site) were generally low (around 0.11, see Table 3), suggesting lysozymes have generally been subject to purifying selection. Two tests (H2 and H5), however, did
result in ω > 1. Both of these allowed the branch (b in
Figure 6) leading to the clade with the digestive cv-lysozyme 2 to have its own ω value. In both of these cases,
ω was undefined due to a lack of synonymous substitutions. Inferred substitutions along branch b suggest a
strong excess of amino acid changing substitutions over
silent ones, around 14 to zero. These results are consistent with a burst of positively selected codon changes
associated with the emergence of bivalve i-type lysozymes with a digestive function. These results, along
with those for hypotheses H3 and H4, were significantly
different from the null hypothesis of all branches having
the same rate when tested with a c 2 test with one
degree of freedom.

Discussion and Conclusions
The third lysozyme of Crassostrea virginica, cv-lysozyme
3, possesses a number of characteristics that mark it as
an intermediary between two previously reported i-type
lysozymes from this species. Cv-lysozyme 3 has a molecular mass and distinctive N-terminal amino acid
sequence similar to cv-lysozyme 1, the lysozyme
involved in the host defense [56,58]. Its chemical characteristics and major sites of gene expression, however,
are more like those of cv-lysozyme 2, a lysozyme that
functions in digestion [57]. In addition, the optimal
muramidase activity of cv-lysozyme 3 was detected
under pH and ionic strength conditions that favor the
activity of neither cv-lysozyme 1 nor c-lysozyme 2. Consistent with this biochemical and expression characterization, our phylogenetic tree also placed the clade
including cv-lysozyme 3 as the sister to a clade that
includes cv-lysozyme 2. Moreover, an episode of positive
selection was associated with the transition from defensive to digestive function.
Cv-lysozyme 3 shared properties with both cv-lysozyme
1 and cv-lysozyme 2 (Table 1). Specifically, cv-lysozyme 3
was composed of a similar number of amino acid residues and had a similar molecular mass as cv-lysozyme 1.
It, along with its apparent ortholog cg-lysozyme 4, also
shared a unique N-terminal domain with cv-lysozyme 1
that is absent in cv-lysozyme 2 and all other bivalve itype lysozymes (Figure 5). On the other hand, the theoretical isoelectric point (pI), arginine residue number, and
protease cutting sites in the amino acid sequence of cvlysozyme 3 were closer to those of cv-lysozyme 2 [56-58].
Moreover, cv-lysozyme 3 and cv-lysozyme 2 are both
expressed primarily in the digestive glands (Figure 4;
[57]) whereas cv-lysozyme 3 minor expression sites overlapped with that of cv-lysozyme 1 (Table 1; [58]). These
characteristics of cv-lysozyme 3 are consistent with the
intermediate status of the new lysozyme between the previously reported cv-lysozyme 1 and cv-lysozyme 2.
The topology of our phylogenetic analysis is also
consistent with the transitional status of cv-lysozyme 3
(Figure 6): cv-lysozyme 3 and its C. gigas ortholog

branch off after the defensive cv-lysozyme 1 and as sister to a clade that includes the digestive cv-lysozyme 2.
This suggests that the split between defensive lysozymes,
like cv-lysozyme 1, and other lysozymes, including the
digestive cv-lysozyme 2 and the potentially transitional
cv-lysozyme 3, preceded the split of mytiloid and ostreid
bivalves, a view consistent with taxonomic views that
place these families (along with Chlamys of the Pectinidae) in the Pteriomorpha [63]. The sister group relationship of the digestive lysozymes (the clade containing cvlysozyme 2 and the other digestive lysozymes, cv2C, of
Figure 6) and the potentially transitional cv-lysozyme 3/
cg-lysozyme 4 clade is consistent with an evolutionary
history in which the latter are transitional forms that
have been lost (or not yet found) in lineages outside of
Crassostrea. An alternative in which cv-lysozyme 3 and
cg-lysozyme 4 are not transitional forms but have
instead arisen within the lineage leading to Crassostrea
is not supported by the topology of phylogenetic tree in
Figure 6, which places digestive lysozymes from Mytilus
and Chlamys as closer to the digestive lysozymes from
Crassostrea than the cv3/cg4 clade. However, the branch
leading to the cv3/cg4 clade is not a long one, as would
be expected for an early origin, so the possibility of a
more recent genesis within Crassostrea cannot be
entirely excluded. Finding a cv3 ortholog within mytiliods would resolve this issue. Expression levels of cvlysozyme 3 appear to be low, suggesting that orthologs
to this lysozyme may not yet have been found due to
the rarity of their transcripts. We purified 18.6 mg of
cv-lysozyme 1 from the first HIC peak in this research
(not shown). Similarly, 2.2 mg of cv-lysozyme 2 can be
purified from 5.5 g of crystalline style total proteins
[57]. These qualitative data suggest that cv-lysozyme 3
expression level is far lower than the two other C. virginica lysozymes, such that the transcipts for this transitional form are rare. We predict that deeper sequencing
of other bivalves with digestive lysozymes will reveal
orthologs to cv-lysozyme 3. Alternatively, orthologs to
cv-lysozyme 3 may have gone extinct in some bivalve
lineages that once possessed them, including Mytilus.

Results from studies on c-type lysozymes in vertebrates and insects indicate that the shift from a defensive function to a digestive function is accompanied by
changes from proteins that are basic (i.e., high pI) and
sensitive to proteases (i.e., more protease cut sites in
amino acid sequence) to acidic and more resistant to
protease lysis [10,34-36,40]. This is also true of the two
i-type oyster lysozymes, cv-lysozyme 1 and cv-lysozyme
2 [56-58]. Interestingly, the two non-oyster lysozymes
(T. japonica in [51,64]; Mytilus edulis 1 in [54]) biochemically determined to have high pI and numbers of
trypsin cut sites (and thus inferred to have defensive
function) occur basally in the phylogenetic tree, whereas
the sole non-oyster lysozyme determined to be digestive
based on low pI and few trypsin cut sites (Chlamys
islandica in [52]) falls in the clade that includes the
digestive cv-lysozyme 2. The single exceptional sequence
within the digestive clade (with predicted high pI and
many trypsin cut sites), cg-lysozyme 3, was generated
from mantle tissue [65], and may represent an instance
of reversal to the ancestral defensive function.
Despite their non-sister relationship, cv-lysozyme 1,
cv-lysozyme 3, and cg-lysozyme 4 share a unique Nterminal domain. This suggests that this N-terminal
domain may have been introduced on to the ancestral
core of bivalve i-type lysozyme relatively recently. Itoh
and Takahashi [66] identified a repeat domain that
shows high sequence identity (> 50%) with the cv-lysozyme 1 N-terminal region at the N-terminus of some
peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) from the
Pacific oyster, C. gigas. Our alignments (Figure 7) show
an even higher level of sequence similarity between
these PGRP repeats and the cv-lysozyme 3 and cg-lysozyme 4 N-terminal region. Because peptidoglycans constitute a major proportion of the bacterial cell wall, it
may be reasonable to assume that this shared stretch of
sequence is involved with the recognition and binding
of bacteria in both PGRPs and lysozymes. A PGRP presumably involved in host defense exhibits the molecular
signature of positive selection in ants [67]. Regardless of
function, the unique N-terminal domain uniting cv-lysozyme 1, cv-lysozyme 3, and cg-lysozyme 4 apparently
represents a modular sequence element that can be integrated into different proteins via domain shuffling [68].
Exon structure of bivalve lysozymes supports this possibility. An intron, which could facilitate domain shuffling,
occurs just after the hard-to-align N-termini in the lysozymes of both Mytilus edulis 1 and Chlamys [69,70].
Studies on c-type lysozymes of ruminant artiodactyls
indicate that they include intermediate transitional
forms between lysozymes that function in host defense
and lysozymes that function in the stomach for digestion [71,72]. Ito et al [71], for example, reported that
lysozymes purified from the kidney of cow and sheep

Page 9 of 17

have highest sequence identity with conventional defensive lysozymes, but show greater chemical similarity
with stomach lysozymes (i.e., lowered pI and high enzymatic activity at low ionic strength). Some of these
intermediates may have been retained because their chemical properties allow them to function under the pH
and ionic strength conditions that are unfavorable for
the other paralogs [71]. Interestingly, these intermediates of c-type lysozymes are also reported to have optimal pH and ionic strength conditions for lysozyme
activity that differ from that of the lysozymes functioning in immunity [71]. Cv-lysozyme 3 showed a higher
optimal pH for lysozyme activity compared to cv-lysozyme 1 and cv-lysozyme 2 (Figure 3; Table 1). Purified
cv-lysozyme 3 also formed polymers, a phenomenon
reported in different lysozymes [14,59-62], although cvlysozyme 1 or cv-lysozyme 2 do not (not shown). Thus,
cv-lysozyme 3 responds differently to pH and perhaps
ionic strength than do other C. virginica lysozymes. The
three C. viriginica lysozymes together would thus allow
relatively high lysozyme activity to be maintained over a
broad range of pH (5.5-9.0) and ionic strength (I =
0.005-0.26) (Figure 3B). The coexistence of three, or
perhaps more, lysozymes with different chemical properties would thus help maintain a relatively high lysozyme
activity level within tissues under the variable physiochemical conditions faced by oysters, which are osmoconformers and poikilotherms.
Cv-lysozyme 3 could potentially function both in
immunity and digestion because it shares the properties
of both lysozymes (i.e., cv-lysozyme 1 and cv-lysozyme
3). Previously, we purified just one lysozyme (i.e., cvlysozyme 2) from the oyster crystalline style [57], indicating cv-lysozyme 3 is not secreted in quantity into the
oyster digestive tubules, which will impede its function
as a digestive enzyme. On the other hand, its amino
acid sequence similarity with cv-lysozyme 1, including a
shared unique amino-terminus (Figure 7), suggests a
function in host defense, as the digestive gland can be
an important portal of entry of pathogens.
The i-type lysozymes of bivalves share another similarity with c-type lysozymes in some vertebrate lineages: the
evolution of digestive lysozymes from a defensive progenitor is accompanied by an episode of positive selection. Jollès et al [73] noted an elevated rate of
nonsynonymous substitutions on the branch leading to a
monophyletic clade of ruminant stomach lysozymes.
Messier and Stewart [74] likewise found a burst of nonsynonymous substitutions on the branch leading to digestive lysozymes in Colobine monkeys. That burst involved
an inferred 9 nonsynonymous changes, less than the estimated 14 for the branch leading to bivalve digestive lysozymes. Identifying which particular residues changed in
bivalves, however, would be a far more speculative

Xue et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/213

exercise than for Colobines, which diverged far more
recently (15 My) than bivalve digestive lysozymes (which,
given divergence times for the lineages leading to Chlamys and Mytilus, and Crassostrea, should have occurred
in the Early Ordovician, about 480 My ago; [75]).
Considering together lysozymes that appear to be
functional and phylogenetic intermediates in both ruminants and bivalves suggests an evolutionary pathway
between ancestral defensive and derived digestive forms.
The genes encoding lysozyme appear to have undergone
multiple duplications within bivalves. This pattern is
consist with that seen in the nematode genus Caenorhabditis [76], where different numbers of lysozyme paralogs among three congeners, along with varied
phylogenetic relationships among them, suggest
repeated cycles of gene duplication, divergence, and
extinction. Duplication of an ancestral defensive paralog
of lysozyme in bivalves would allow one copy to explore
and adapt to physiological conditions from which the
ancestral form was excluded. This specialization may be
abetted by more tissue-specific expression of the duplicates [77]. Duplicates that were expressed in acidic
environments, even while retaining their defensive function, would be fortuitously preadapted for digestive
function, which would evolve following subsequent
duplication of the intermediate form. This adaptive scenario makes specific predictions about the breadth of
expression and physiological range of defensive, digestive, and intermediate forms (in those species that have
the latter two). For example, physiological range should
be broader and tissue-specificity should be lower in species having just a single (defensive) lysozyme. Lysozymes
have already taught us much about adaptive protein
evolution, and their further exploration should continue
to inform how new protein functions evolve.

Methods
Cv-lysozyme 3 purification

Twenty liters of eastern oyster shell liquor were kindly
provided by P&J Oyster Company in New Orleans,
Louisiana, in March 2006. Shell liquor is a combination
of shell cavity fluid and hemolymph released when
oysters are shucked and has been found to contain lysozyme [78]. The shell liquor was freeze-dried and the
powder resuspended in 1.2 L of deionized water by stirring overnight at 4°C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 3,200 g for 45 min at 4°C to remove the
insoluble particles including hemocytes and tissue debris
and the supernatant collected for lysozyme purification.
A combination of conventional ion exchange and size
exclusion chromatographies, hydrophobic interaction
chromatography (HIC), and reverse phase HPLC was
used to purify cv-lysozyme 3. The shell liquor was first
fractionated using the chromatographies with

Page 10 of 17

procedures modified from those used by Xue et al [56]
for the purification of cv-lysozyme 1. The resulting fractions that contained lysozyme activity were further fractionated using hydrophobic interaction chromatography
(HIC) with a HiPrep™ 16/10 phenyl FF (high sub) column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp. Piscataway, NJ).
Proteins loaded into the column were washed with a linear gradient from 1 M of ammonium sulfate water solution to deionized water at an elution rate of 5 mL/min
for 40 min followed by an isocratic elution with deionized water for 10 min at the same elution rate. The
elution was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm and
tested for lysozyme activity.
We detected 2 absorbance peaks that contained fractions with high lysozyme activity. Because SDS-PAGE
indicated that protein in the first peak was identical to
the cv-lysozyme 1 purified previously [56], we took
only the proteins collected in the second peak to
HPLC purification. Reverse-phase HPLC purification
was done using a Waters 600E system connected to a
Waters Delta-Pak™ C 18 column (15 μm particle size,
300Å pore size, 8 mm × 100 mm) (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) with linear gradient elution. After
loading of the protein sample, the column was eluted
with a gradient from 20% acetonitrile containing 0.1%
(v/v) TFA to 50% of acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v)
TFA over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The elution was monitored for absorbance at 214 nm and
each absorbance peak was collected as a single fraction. The fractions were freeze-dried to remove organic
solvents and the proteins recovered in deionized water
and stored at -20°C until use.
The purification was done at room temperature (20°C)
and the purity of the resulting cv-lysozyme 3 was determined by SDS-PAGE using a 12% acrylamide/bis gel in
Tris-HCl buffer, followed by staining of proteins in the
gel with 1% (w/v) Coomassie blue R-250 in 10% (v/v)
acetic acid-40% (v/v) methanol and destaining with 10%
(v/v) acetic acid-40% (v/v) methanol solution. Protein
concentration was measured by BCA using a Micro
BCA Protein assay Reagent Kit (Pierce Biotechnology
Inc, Rockford, IL) with bovine serum album as the
standard.
Lysozyme activity assay

Lysozyme activity was determined by monitoring the
decrease in turbidity of a suspension of Micrococcus
lysodeikticus (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis,
MO) in an appropriate buffer solution as reported by
Xue et al [56,57]. Buffer solutions were selected according to the requirements of the individual experiments
(see below). The assay was done in a 96-well microplate
where 20 μL of sample was mixed with 180 μL of a 0.8
mg/mL M. lysodeikticus suspension. The plate was

Xue et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/213

measured at 25°C for absorbance at 450 nm for 5 min
using a BenchMark Plus microplate reader (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Inc, Hercules, CA) with a built-in kinetic
mode. In this study, one unit of lysozyme was defined as
the quantity that caused a decrease in absorbance of
0.001 unit/min using the M. lysodeikticus suspension
prepared in 0.01 M MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0. All measurements of lysozyme activity were done in triplicate.
Optimal pH and ionic strength for lysozyme activity
was determined using a set of 120 buffers covering pH
range of pH 3.5-10.5 (3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0,
7.5, 8.5, 9.5, and 10.5) and an ionic strength range of I =
0.005-2.60 (0.005, 0.010, 0.020, 0.040, 0.070, 0.100,
0.140, 0.180, 0.220, 0.260, and 0.280). The buffers were
prepared with NaOH-acetic acid (pH3.5-5.5), Na2HPO4NaH 2 PO 4 (pH6.0-8.5), and boric acid-NaOH (pH9.510.5) as reported by Xue et al [56]. The results were
expressed as percent activity with the highest activity
detected was defined as 100%.
Detection of antibacterial activities

To assess the antibacterial properties of the purified
lysozyme, we measured the concentrations of cv-lysozyme 3 inhibiting the growth of Escherichia coli and
Vibrio vulnificus. These bacteria were obtained from Dr.
John Hawke or Dr. Marlene Janes at the Louisiana State
University. Bacteria were grown in a nutrient broth containing 5 g beef extract, 2 g neopeptone, 0.1 g bactose
dextrose, 1 g yeast extract and 10 g NaCl in 1 L of
water and harvested in log phase. The bacteria were
resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a
density of about 106 bacteria per mL and 20 μL were
added to 20 μL of twofold serially diluted lysozyme
(200-6.25 μg/mL) in PBS or to 20 μL PBS alone (control) in 96-well plates. After 2 h incubation at room
temperature, 160 μL of broth were added to each well
and the plates were incubated at 30°C. The bacterium
growth was measured at 570 nm after 12 h incubation
with a BenchMark Plus microplate reader. Results were
expressed as the minimum concentration (MIC) of lysozyme protein significantly inhibiting bacterial growth.
All measurements were done in triplicate and the
experiment was repeated twice. The data were analyzed
by one factor ANOVA using the program SigmaStat
(Systat Software Inc., Point Richmond, CA). A SNK’s
multiple comparison of means was performed when significant differences were found (P < 0.05).
N-terminal sequencing

Purified cv-lysozyme 3 was separated by SDS-PAGE in a
12% acrylamide/bis gel under reduced conditions and
transferred to a Sequi-blot™ PVDF membrane in 0.01 M
CAPS-10% (v/v) methanol, pH 11, using a Mini TranBlot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories

Page 11 of 17

Inc, Hercules, CA). The membrane was stained with 1%
(w/v) Coomassie blue R-250 in 10% (v/v) acetic acid40% (v/v) methanol and destained with 10% (v/v) acetic
acid-40% (v/v) methanol solution. The PVDF membrane
bearing the cv-lysozyme 3 was cut and washed 6 times
in deionized water. N-terminal sequencing was done
with automated Edman degradation using an Applied
Biosystems Procise 494/HT protein sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the Protein Chemistry
Laboratory of the University of Texas Medical Branch in
Galveston, Texas.
Mass spectrometric determination of molecular mass and
amino acid sequence

An aliquot (1 μL) of purified cv-lysozyme 3 in deionized
water was mixed 1:3 (v/v) with 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid, SA) MALDI matrix and
spotted on a sample plate for molecular weight determination. MALDI spectra were acquired on an Applied
Biosystems Voyager STR instrument operated in linear
mode using hen egg white lysozyme (MH+ 14306.6) as
an external standard.
Purified cv-lysozyme 3 (70 μg) was reduced with
50 μL of 6.6 mg/mL dithiothreitol in 6 M guanidine
HCl, 1.5 M Tris, pH 8.4 (buffer A) at 37°C for 45 min
followed by alkylation with 50 μL of 15 mg per mL of
iodoacetamide in buffer A at 37°C for 30 min. For intact
protein analysis, excess reagents were removed by elution over C18 packed tip (Agilent Cleanup tip). Reduced
and alkylated protein was mixed with matrix and analyzed as above.
For amino acid sequence analysis, cv-lysozyme 3 from
the reduction/alkylation mixture was purified using a
PepClean C-18 spin column (Pierce) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Eluate in 70% acetonitrile (2 × 20
μL) was dried by speed vac. Dried cv-lysozyme 3 was
solubilized in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer,
pH 7.8 (50 μL) and trypsin (6 μg) was added for microwave digestion (CEM Corp., Matthews, NC) for 10 min
at 60°C. Tryptic peptides were desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore) and eluted with a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) MALDI matrix (saturated in 70%
acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) for direct MALDI MS/MS analysis (Applied Biosystems 4800 instrument). MALDI MS/
MS analysis was employed without peptide separation to
directly obtain sequence information on peptides
observed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Tandem mass
spectra were manually interpreted and compared to the
predicted cDNA sequence for assignment.
Cv-lysozyme-3 cDNA cloning and sequencing

Cv-lysozyme-3 cDNA was identified by 3′- and 5′- rapid
amplification cDNA ends (RACE) using cDNA synthesized from hemocyte total RNA as template. An initial

search in the GenBank sequence databases using the Nterminal sequence determined by Edman degradation of
purified protein as query identified an eastern oyster
EST (Accession Number CV087997) that encompassed
the N-terminal sequence of purified cv-lysozyme 3. We
performed 3′-RACE using the BD SMART™ RACE
cDNA Amplification Kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto,
CA) and a primer (Lyso3-3′ in Table 4) designed from
this EST sequence. The 3′-RACE product was analyzed
electrophoretically in 2.0% agarose gel stained by ethidium bromide and purified using an Ultra Clean Gel
Spin DNA Purification Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Solana
Beach, CA). The purified products were then cloned in
a plasmid vector, pCR 2.1-TOPO, of TOPO TA Cloning
Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced with 3130
Genetic Analyzer using Big Dye Terminator v.3.1
sequencing reagent (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). To ensure the sequence authenticity, three clones
were randomly selected for sequence determination.
The 5′-RACE reactions were performed using an intragenic primer (Lyso3-5′ in Table 4) designed from the
sequence of the 3′-RACE products and the products
cloned and sequenced as described for the 3′-RACE.
Tissue specificity of cv-lysozyme 3 gene expression

Hemolymph was withdrawn separately from the adductor muscle sinuses of 5 eastern oysters, 9-13 cm in shell
length and collected from Barataria Bay, Louisiana in
July 2005, using a 1 mL syringe and a 25G needle and
immediately centrifuged at 800 g for 2 min at 4°C.
Supernatants were removed and the hemocyte pellets
transferred into RNAlater (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). The
right valve of each oyster was then removed and 5 mm3
fragments of the digestive gland, mantle, gills, style sacmidgut, labial palps, and gonad were excised and immediately immersed in RNAlater. The samples were stored
at 4°C until use.
Total RNA was extracted from hemocytes and tissue
fragments of organs sampled from the 5 individual
oysters using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) and treated
with DNase to prevent DNA contamination. cDNA was
synthesized from 1 μg per sample of total RNA using
an Omniscript Reverse Transcript Kit (QIAGEN)

supplemented with oligodT primer and RNase inhibitor
(Invitrogen). The synthesized cDNA was then measured
for cv-lysozyme 3 cDNA using semi-quantitative PCR,
with the oyster 28 S rRNA as a reference for sample
normalization. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was done
using a Gene Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Hercules, CA) in a total reaction volume of 20 μL containing 0.1 μL of Taq DNA polymerase, 2 μL of 10 × PCR
buffer, 1.6 μL of dNTP (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan), 0.6 μL
of each primer at 20 μM, and 1 μL of synthesized
cDNA. Primers used for cv-lysozyme 3 cDNA detection
(Lyso3-F and Lyso3-R) and the 28 S rRNA cDNA
detection (28S-F and 28S-R) were shown in Table 4.
The cv-lysozyme 3 primers were designed to amplify a
PCR product of 631 bp that covered the entire cDNA
excluding the polyA tail. PCR cycle numbers were optimized separately for cv-lysozyme 3 and 28 S rRNA to
ensure the reactions were terminated within the linear
non-saturated PCR phase. The final cycling conditions
were as follows: an initial denaturation at 94.0°C for 10
min, followed by 35 cycles (for cv-lysozyme 3) or 25
cycles (for 28 S rRNA) of 94.0°C for 30 sec, annealing
at 52.0°C for 30 sec, extension at 72.0°C for 30 sec, and
a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. Ten microliters of
the PCR products were separated in 2% agarose gel
stained by ethidium bromide. The gels were then
imaged using a Gel Doc™ XR system and analyzed using
the Quantity One® 1-D analysis software (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Inc.). The image analysis was performed by
measuring the average optical intensity and area of each
PCR product band followed by calculation of the band
volume by multiplying the average optical intensity with
the correspondent area. The cv-lysozyme 3 band
volume was then divided by the 28 S rRNA band
volume generated from a same sample and the ratio
was defined as the cv-lysozyme 3 expression level of the
correspondent tissue. The expression data were analyzed by one factor ANOVA using the SigmatStat software (Systat, Point Richmond, CA). A SNK’s multiple
comparison of means was performed when significant
differences among organs were found (P < 0.05). The
results were reported as mean ± standard deviation
(SD) of 5 individual oysters.

Computational sequence analysis

Amino acid sequence deduction of cv-lysozyme 3 cDNA
sequence was performed using the software Genetyx
Mac Ver. 10.1.6 (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan).
Signal peptide was predicted by both neural networks
and hidden Markov models on SignalP 3.0 server [79].
Sequence similarity was determined using BLAST program on the server of National Center of Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) [80,81]. Molecular weight, isoelectric point (pI), and protease cleavage sites were predicted using ProtParam and PeptideCutter on the
ExPASY Server [82].
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of sequences

If cv-lysozyme 3 represents a preserved transitional form
between the ancestral defense function of lysozyme and
its presumably derived digestive function, then cv-lysozyme 3 and its orthologs should fall phylogenetically as
the sister group to the digestive lysozymes. To test this
hypothesis, we preformed a phylogenetic analysis of
known bivalve i-type lysozymes (Table 5), using
sequences from two annelids (Eisenia andrei and Hirudo
medicinalis) as outgroups.
The inferred amino acid sequences for bivalve lysozymes varied greatly in length, ranging from 116 (Calyptogena sp. 1) to 228 (M. gallo. 2) residues. Such length
variation necessarily results in gaps in the alignments
used for phylogenetic analysis. To minimize the impact

Page 13 of 17

of these gaps on the outcome of our analyses, we used
two alignment algorithms (ClustalW and Bali-Phy) and
excluded regions where only a small proportion (less
than one-third) of sequences shared insertions. ClustalW [83] combines an empirical model of residue replacement with gap penalties for adding new gaps and
extending existing ones. The algorithm is progressive:
similar sequences are aligned first, with increasing distant ones added to this foundation. However, any mistakes made early on, either due to a faulty initial guide
tree or simply misaligned regions, can become locked
and bias the final multiple sequence alignment, a problem exacerbated when attempting to align highly
diverged sequences [84]. BAli-Phy [85] avoids this problem by not conditioning on a single guide tree but
instead finding the multiple alignment with the highest
posterior probability by estimating the alignment and
tree topology simultaneously using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler.
We used the default settings for ClustalW (ver. 2.012)
alignment. For Bali-Phy (ver 2.02) analysis, we used the
Empirical-WAG substitution model with four gamma
rate classes and the default indel model. By default, the
MCMC sampler in BAli-Phy collects information after
each iteration and runs indefinitely until stopped by the
user. We chose when to do this by first determining
when convergence had occurred through visual inspection of output using Tracer v1.4 [86] and by periodically

Sequences from two annelids (Eisenia andrei and Hirudo medicinalis) were used as outgroups

running the full analysis on the output, as recommended
by the authors. After convergence, the Markov chain
was then allowed to run until the effective sample size
from the Markov chain was equal to or greater than
100. The final output was analyzed, with all the samples
before convergence discarded as burnin.
The resulting full alignments contained long stretches
of novel residues at both the amino- and carboxy-termini of several proteins. Such novel sequences commonly are introduced by the incorporation of noncoding
DNA or via the fusion of parts from different genes [87],
resulting in regions between orthologs that are not
homologous and thus inappropriate for phylogenetic
analysis. To minimize the impact of these gaps, we
removed from each alignment all positions in which
inferred insertions were shared by less than one-third of
the sequences, including all positions in front of a conserved intron [70] that may facilitate domain shuffling at
the amino-end of the protein (see Discussion). As part
of the full output analysis, BAli-Phy produces alignment
uncertainty (AU) plots that reflect the confidence of
each position in the alignment by using Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP). For the trimmed alignment, all
columns and positions in the AU plot had BPP > 0.99,
with the exception of five positions, two of which were
> 0.5 and the remaining > 0.7.
The two trimmed core alignments (Figure 5) were
used for further phylogenetic analyses. ProtTest v2.0
[88] was used to choose the appropriate model of amino
acid evolution. The WAG + a gamma distribution was
selected using the corrected AIC. This model was implemented in MrBayes v3.1.2 [89]. Two MCMC searches
consisting of 4 heated chains were run in MrBayes for
1,000,000 generations, sampling every 100. After discarding the first 2500 samples, output files were checked
with Tracer and PMSF values were calculated using the
SUMP command to check for convergence. Convergence appeared to have occurred, so an all-compatible
tree was calculated in MrBayes after discarding the first
2500 trees as burnin. A maximum likelihood tree for
the ClustalW alignment was constructed using GARLI
v0.96b8-r601 [90] with the WAG amino acid substitution model with a gamma distribution. Default settings
were used for the GARLI analyses and 100 bootstrap
replicates were performed. The resulting 100 trees were
summarized into a consensus tree using Dendro-Py [91].
The novel amino terminus of cv-lysozyme 1 has high
sequence similarity (> 50%) with a repeat sequence of
unknown function from a family of peptidoglycan recognition proteins from the Pacific oyster, C. gigas [65].
Such high similarity could result from domain shuffling,
which would violate a fundamental underlying assumption of phylogenetic sequence analysis: that all positions

Page 14 of 17

share a common history. We explored this possibility by
performing a BLASTp search on the 49 residues near
the N-terminus of cv-lysozyme 3 that the BALi-Phy analysis could align only to a similar region in cv-lysozme 1.
Only sequence hits with Z-scores ≥ 5 were considered.
Testing for positive selection

Adaptive protein evolution leaves a signature of selection in the form of a high nonsynonymous (amino acid
altering) substitution rate relative to the synonymous
(silent) rate [92]. Values of ω less than one indicate purifying selection, while ω greater than one indicates positive selection. Modifications of this general approach
[93] can be used to identify branches on a phylogenetic
tree where selection shifts or where episodic change is
concentrated. More specifically, these tests employ a
maximum likelihood approach to estimate values of ω
for specified partitions of branches and whether these
values differ.
We used PAML v4.2a [94] to test for evidence of lineage-specific changes in selection pressure by differences
in selection. Because comparisons of deeply divergent
sequences can cloud the signal of selection [95], we
removed six sequences that were distant from the clade
containing the digestive lysozymes prior to the selection
analysis (see Fig 6 for large box indicating the species
and topology used for the analysis).
To test whether the shift from a defensive function in
cv-lysozyme 1 to a digestive function in cv-lysozyme 2
was associated with either an episodic burst of adaptive
sequence change or a shift in ω values, we tested six
hypotheses (Table 5). First (H0), we assumed that ω was
equal among all lineages of the lysozyme tree. Next, we
tested for episodic burst of change, where ω increased
either on the branch leading to cv-lysozyme 3 and the
clade (cv2C) including the digestive lysozyme cv-lysozyme 2 (H1) or at the branch leading to the clade
including digestive lysozyme cv-lysozyme 2 (H2). We
tested for shifts in ω either for all of the digestive cvlysozyme 2 clade (H3) or for the digestive cv-lysozyme 2
clade plus branch b leading to them (H4). Finally, we
evaluated a combination model with an episodic burst
at branch b and a different ω in the digestive cv-lysozyme 2 clade thereafter. The significance of any difference was tested using a c 2 test with one degree of
freedom.
