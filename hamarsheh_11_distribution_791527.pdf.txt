Distribution of Leishmania major zymodemes in
relation to populations of Phlebotomus papatasi
sand flies
Omar Hamarsheh

Abstract
Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) (Diptera: Psychodidae) is the main vector of Leishmania major Yakimoff & Schokhor
(Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), the causative agent of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Old World.
Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) was extensively used to type different L. major stocks allover the world.
Multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) has been recently used to investigate P. papatasi sand flies at population
and subpopulation levels. In this article, the association between geographical distribution of L. major zymodemes
and the distribution of populations and subpopulations of L. major vector; P. papatasi are discussed.
Introduction
Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is caused by
the parasitic protozoan Leishmania major, which is
transmitted by the phlebotomine sand fly Phlebotomus
papatasi. P. papatasi is also a vector of Leishmania arabica in Saudi Arabia [1,2], and of arboviruses in many
countries [3,4]. Using various techniques like isoenzyme
electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
sequencing of different genes, L. major had been firmly
identified in P. papatasi [5,6]. Many trypanosomatid
infections have been recorded from wild sand flies [7].
However, many of these infections might have been
other mammalian Leishmania species, or even lizard
Sauroleishmania, as isolation and further characterization was not attempted. In countries north of Iran,
much transmission of L. major, L. turanica and L. gerbilli is believed to occur in or near the burrows of the
great gerbil Rhombomys opimus [8]. These burrows provide refuges for many sand fly species as well as for
mammals and reptiles, making them a high risk habitat
for the transmission of parasites to mammals and
lizards [9]. In the former USSR, the distribution of
L. turanica in rodents coincided with that of the sand
flies P. papatasi [10]. The incrimination of a sand fly
species as being the vector is complicated, KillickCorrespondence: ohamarsheh@gmail.com

Jerusalem, Palestine

Kendrick and Ward in 1981 established different
grades of certainty; these include, anthropophily and
geographic distribution in accord with the disease
(Grade 1 and 2). Grade 3 requires that Leishmania be
isolated from wild caught flies. Grade 4 establishes
development of the parasite in the gut of the suspected
vector. Grade 5 demonstrates experimental transmission of Leishmania by bite [11].
To date, there is no vaccine or effective cure for leishmaniasis [12]. It is postulated that successful establishment of the disease in an endemic area is the outcome
of a close association between the Leishmania parasite
and its natural sand fly vector. This close relationship
between the parasite and its corresponding vector may
have implications from the epidemiological point of
view to the distribution of the disease as well as disease
dynamics [13]. Close distribution results in considerable
heterogeneity of both vector and parasite and this exemplifies a successful adaptation of a parasite resulting in
distinct outcomes of infection and a complex epidemiological pattern. Several studies by leading researchers on
sand fly- Leishmania interactions [14-17] proved a fairly
selective relationship between Leishmania parasites and
its corresponding sand fly vectors, which is typically the
result of both ecological and molecular factors. This
relationship involves the ability of Leishmania parasites
to infect healthy sand flies by successful attachment of
Leishmanai parasites to the sand fly midgut. In the case
of L. major, attachment is provided by the parasite’s

surface lipophosphoglycan (LPG) to the Pp Galectines of
the P. papatasi midgut proteins [15]. Other pathways
existed; studies on mutants in LPG biosynthesis suggested the existence of LPG independent pathway of
parasite attachment [18-20], thus, other unknown genes
may potentially involve in the attachment relationship.
Genetic variability among Leishmania and sand fly
populations is crucial to unravel hidden genetic factors
controlling the attachment of parasites to the midgut of
the P. papatasi sand fly and therefore controlling the
competence and infectivity of P. papatasi sand fly and
L. major parasites respectively. To fulfill this long term
goal, both P. papatasi and L. major were extensively
studied and genetically typed in recent years using different molecular markers in a way to understand its systematics as well as population structures. These studies
revealed the presence of isolated populations for both
L. major and P. papatasi in different countries in the
Old World [21-23].
Our knowledge about the wide genetic variability and
phylogenetic relationships among the different lineages of
L. major parasites and P. papatasi vectors has grown exponentially. This growth of knowledge has been supported by
theoretical approaches based on population genetic analysis and the increasing development of molecular biology
tools used to identify different genotypes. Genetically,
P. papatasi is not a polymorphic sand fly. Phylogenetic studies using various molecular markers report a high genetic
homogeneity [23,24].The level of genetic variability among
L. major is very low and it is considered the least
polymorphic Leishmania species [21,25].
Techniques of molecular biology including advancement in sequencing techniques are now becoming feasible and applicable in sand fly research [26-30]. On
the other hand, parasite characterization were traditionally and routinely carried out by the French WHO
reference laboratory at Montpellier (Laboratoire d’Ecologie Médicale et Pathologie Parasitaire, Faculté de
Médecine, Montpellier, France) using multi locus
enzyme electrophoresis, the zymodeme (defined as a
collection of stocks that have the same isozyme profile
[31] ) characterization based on starch gel multilocus
enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) typing. The zymodeme
classification become popular over the years by providing a baseline insight into the molecular epidemiology
of L. major. Since the distribution of zymodemes
sometimes limited by geographical boundaries [32-34].
MLEE was very useful for the characterization of
L. major parasites, but attempts to use MLEE to
genetically differentiate P. papatasi populations which
were carried out in the past provided no useful genetic
information about the structure and distribution of different P. papatasi populations [35].

DNA markers such as genomic DNA sequence features and DNA microsatellites are useful for analyzing
genetic variations among sand flies [23,36-39]. Mitochondrial DNA sequence polymorphism is very useful
for studying differences between closely related species
and among populations of the same species from different geographic locations, but it lacks the sensitivity to
detect very subtle differences that frequently exist
among very recently diverged populations [26,40]. The
use of multilocus microsatellite analysis based on DNA
sequences with short tandem repeat motifs such as (GT)
n [41], demonstrates high variation in the number of
repeats seen in individuals from different populations
and thus are useful for studying population genetics
[42]. Therefore, multilocus microsatellite typing
(MLMT) has recently been applied to both P. papatasi
sand flies and L. major parasites, providing additional
information about the transmission dynamics of
L. major [21,43] as well as the distribution and dispersal
of P. papatasi [23].
In previous years, MLEE were used extensively to type
isolates from various regions in Asia, Africa and Europe.
The Laboratoire d’Ecologie Médicale et Pathologie Parasitaire, Faculté de Médecine, Montpellier, France
became a reference for typing Leishmania isolates from
all over the world. Zymodeme and DNA analysis proceeded in recent years in parallel lines; researchers used
other genetic markers to reveal additional diversity
within each zymodeme. Different molecular approaches
have been used including random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), kDNA fragment length polymorphisms (schizodemes), karyotype variation, PCR
amplicon size polymorphisms, PCR restriction fragment
length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLPs) and comparative
DNA sequencing of nuclear and mitochondrial targets
[44-47]. In the literature there is much valuable information about the distribution of both L. major zymodemes
[25] and P. papatasi sand fly populations and subpopulations [23,39]. Recently, a debate has been raised about
the possible correlation between the distribution of populations and subpopulations of P. papatasi in relation to
L. major zymodemes. Therefore, this review aimed to discuss the possible association between the distributions of
L. major zymodemes in relation to the distribution of
P. papatasi populations and subpopulations.
L. major zymodemes versus P. papatasi populations

Globally, two main predominant and widespread zymodemes were reported for L. major, MON 25 and MON
26 [25]. More recently, a correlation between microsatellite markers and geographical origin was evaluated in
P. papatasi, suggesting MLMT to be effective for population analysis in sand flies [23]. The geographical

Figure 1 Geographical distribution of L. major zymodemes in relation to P. papatasi populations and subpopulations. Distribution of
the main L. major zymodemes; MON 25, MON 26, MON 23 and MON 26 variants (MON 74, MON 103 and MON 117) in relation to the
distribution of P. papatasi populations and subpopulations (A1-A4, B1, B2).

distribution of the main L. major zymodemes and populations of P. papatasi is shown in Figure 1.
In the east Mediterranean region (i.e., Palestine, Israel,
Jordan, Turkey, and Syria), the commonest zymodeme is
MON 26 which came from a semi-arid rural area where
Psammomys obesus is widespread [25,48,49]. In agreement with MLEE, the population structures inferred by
microsatellite typing of P. papatasi vector in these countries were mixed and restricted to only one population
designated as ‘B’ which is further subdivided into ‘B1’and
‘B2’substructures without significant geographical distribution [23]. MON 26 is remarkably distributed over a
large geographical range extending from Senegal in the
west to Kazakhstan and Pakistan in the east. The east
Mediterranean region represents small part of this range.
Other less prevalent zymodemes include MON 66-68,
MON 103 and MON 74 that were found to coexist in
Palestinian Territories and Israel, Jordan and Egypt
respectively. These less prevalent zymodemes considered
as variants from MON 26 which only differ by a single
enzyme each [25,32]. The L. major zymodeme in Sudan
is MON 74, which considered as a variant from MON
26, and present within the range of MON 26, the same
zymodeme was characterized from an L. major infected
P. duboscqi sand fly collected from southern Ethiopia
[50]. This is in agreement with the population structure
of P. papatasi in Sudan in which ‘B2’ subpopulation is
prevalent. MON 74 is also existed in southern Egypt, particularly in the areas close to the Sudanese borders; it
seems that MON 74 diffused from Middle and Western
Africa to Egypt, and probably other countries, where this
zymodeme is less prevalent. This scenario is supported

by historical information in which migration of people
from Africa to the north was moved through Egypt.
The North Maghreb countries Tunisia, Algeria and
Morocco share with a unique zymodeme MON 25,
although other less prevalent zymodemes do exist;
MON 24 in Tunisia and MON 269 in Morocco. The
P. papatasi populations in Maghreb countries were
exclusively belonging to ‘A1’ subpopulation [23]. To
explain this discrepancy; MON 25 is a uniform zymodeme restricted to the Maghreb countries with high
genetic stability. The presence of other less prevalent
zymodemes in Maghreb (MON 269 which differs from
MON 25 by single enzyme only (PGD)), may correspond to a recent mutation, or post-translational modification of the proteins that allow this slight change and
the creation of new zymodemes [51]. The genetic homogeneity associated with the wide distribution of MON 25
suggests the emergence and rapid diffusion of this
zymodeme over the whole Maghreb. MON 25 is diffused to the Sahel (Mali) which could possibly be
explained by diffusion of the parasite due to human
migration and/or to historical climatic changes (humid
periods in Sahara) [25,52].
Using MLMT, P. papatasi populations in Iran were substructured in two subpopulations ‘A2 and A3’ with high
population differentiation [23,53]. On the other hand
mitochondrial and Wolbachia markers for P. papatasi
showed little population differentiation between peridomestic sites and gerbil burrows in Isfahan province[37,54],
even though the L. major parasites were belong to the
same zymodeme; MON 26 that isolated from the eastern
Middle East. It should be noted; based on isoenzyme

characterization, L. major zymodeme MON 26 was identified in one infected P. papatasi [33] and in one infected
P. cuacasicus sand flies [55]. This contradicted the population structure results, in which P. papatasi typed in this
country, belong to two subpopulations (A2-A3) [23].
L. major zymodeme MON 26 has been isolated from both
rodents and humans, and no other zymodemes were characterized in Iran [25,56-59]. Therefore, MLEE seems to be
limited in detecting variations among L. major from Iran
probably due to the fact that L. major has a limited isoenzyme polymorphism over a wide area in favor of poorly
structured populations, or genetic variations were not
affected the amino acid sequences in the studied enzymes
in MLEE. Previous research documented the presence of
genetic variations among different L. major strains from
different provinces in the country. Using sequences from
internal transcribed spacers, variations were manifested in
five genotypic groups; LmA, LmB, LmC, LmD and LmE
[22]. This could be the reason for the existence of new L.
major endemic areas and increasing cases of cutaneous
leishmaniasis which have been reported during recent
years in Iran especially from border areas between Iran
and Pakistan and between Iran and Afghanistan [60-63].
In India the prevalent zymodeme is MON 23 and
P. papatasi population structure was depicted exclusively to ‘A4’; there is a complete association between
the distribution of zymodeme and population structure
based on MLMT in this country [23,25]. In Pakistan,
P. papatasi populations that originated from Baluchistan
province was grouped in ‘A4’, this subpopulation
includes, however, sand flies from India. No clear explanation from the differences between zymodeme distribution of L. major and population structure of P. papatasi
in Pakistan is available, thus analysis of more sand flies
and Leishmania stocks along the Iranian and Pakistani
borders is needed. Baluchistan is a mountainous and
arid area shared by Iran and Pakistan but divided by
borders between the two countries. The prevalent zymodeme in this province is MON 26. This possibly
explains that the presence of this zymodeme (MON 26)
in this country may have originated from Iran, where
MON 26 is widely spread.

Conclusions and research needs
Among sand flies recorded from the Middle East, only
P. papatasi was judged to be a proven vector of L.
major [2]. The wide distribution range of P. papatasi is
limited to a certain number of populations and subpopulations. This satisfies the wide distribution of L. major
in the same range of P. papatasi which is also limited to
a certain group of main zymodemes like MON 25,
MON 26 and MON 23, and to other overlapping less
prevalent variants. MON 25 is characterized in P. papatasi in Maghreb countries [64], the Middle-East, Saudi

Arabia and Iran, MON 26 [33,65-68] and India, MON
23 [25].
This review provides baseline information about the
association of MLMT and MLEE of the P. papatasi vector and L. major parasites. Further research is needed
and should be directed toward analyzing more globally
distributed parasite strains and sand fly samples using
both MLMT and MLEE. Developing new polymorphic
microsatellite markers for both P. papatasi sand flies
and other Leishmania vectors is also essential. Studies
and further investments in this field may disclose markers appropriate for population genetics and thus
explain the vectorial capacity and parasite infectivity
among its structures. Studies emphasizing the correlation between other sand fly species and with its correspondent vectors are very interesting research fields.
The information obtained may significantly improve our
understanding of the transmission and distribution of
Leishmania parasites in relation to their vectors, and
could possibly provide more information about sand flyleishmania evolutionary relationships. This would have
implications for leishmaniasis intervention and control.
To address this long term and promising goal, it would
be beneficial to create a public database that makes Leishmania and sand fly microsatellite allele data available
worldwide. Finally, there is also a need for the standardization of the microsatellite genotyping techniques including the use of primers and the separation techniques.
