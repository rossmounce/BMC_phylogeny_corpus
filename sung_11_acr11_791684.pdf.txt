ACT domain repeat protein that is coordinately
expressed with GLN2 in Arabidopsis

Abstract
Background: The ACT domain, named after bacterial aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase and TyrA (prephenate
dehydrogenase), is a regulatory domain that serves as an amino acid-binding site in feedback-regulated amino acid
metabolic enzymes. We have previously identified a novel type of ACT domain-containing protein family, the ACT
domain repeat (ACR) protein family, in Arabidopsis. Members of the ACR family, ACR1 to ACR8, contain four copies
of the ACT domain that extend throughout the entire polypeptide. Here, we describe the identification of four
novel ACT domain-containing proteins, namely ACR9 to ACR12, in Arabidopsis. The ACR9 and ACR10 proteins
contain three copies of the ACT domain, whereas the ACR11 and ACR12 proteins have a putative transit peptide
followed by two copies of the ACT domain. The functions of these plant ACR proteins are largely unknown.
Results: The ACR11 and ACR12 proteins are predicted to target to chloroplasts. We used protoplast transient
expression assay to demonstrate that the Arabidopsis ACR11- and ACR12-green fluorescent fusion proteins are
localized to the chloroplast. Analysis of an ACR11 promoter-b-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion in transgenic Arabidopsis
revealed that the GUS activity was mainly detected in mature leaves and sepals. Interestingly, coexpression analysis
revealed that the GLN2, which encodes a chloroplastic glutamine synthetase, has the highest mutual rank in the
coexpressed gene network connected to ACR11. We used RNA gel blot analysis to confirm that the expression
pattern of ACR11 is similar to that of GLN2 in various organs from 6-week-old Arabidopsis. Moreover, the expression
of ACR11 and GLN2 is highly co-regulated by sucrose and light/dark treatments in 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings.
Conclusions: This study reports the identification of four novel ACT domain repeat proteins, ACR9 to ACR12, in
Arabidopsis. The ACR11 and ACR12 proteins are localized to the chloroplast, and the expression of ACR11 and GLN2
is highly coordinated. These results suggest that the ACR11 and GLN2 genes may belong to the same functional
module. The Arabidopsis ACR11 protein may function as a regulatory protein that is related to glutamine
metabolism or signaling in the chloroplast.

Background
Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for
plant growth and development. Plants can utilize different forms of nitrogen including nitrate, ammonium, and
amino acids. Most plants use inorganic nitrogen nitrate
as the primary nitrogen source. Nitrate taken up from
the soil will be reduced to ammonium by nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase. Ammonium derived from
nitrate or remobilized from the other nitrogen* Correspondence: ming@gate.sinica.edu.tw

containing compounds can be assimilated into glutamine and glutamate via the glutamine synthetase (GS)/
glutamine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT)
cycle. Glutamine and glutamate are the major amino
donors for the synthesis of the other amino acids and
nitrogen-containing compounds in plants [1]. In addition to their roles in protein synthesis and metabolism,
glutamine and glutamate may also serve as signaling
molecules in plants [2-6].
The synthesis of glutamine and glutamate also
depends on the availability of a-ketoglutarate. In bacteria, the carbon skeleton of ammonia assimilation, aketoglutarate, signals nitrogen deficiency, whereas

glutamine, the fully aminated product, often signals
nitrogen sufficiency [7]. In E. coli, the expression of glutamine synthetase gene and its enzyme activity are regulated by the availability of glutamine and a-ketoglutarate
[7-10]. In response to low glutamine/a-ketoglutarate,
the E. coli PII protein (encoded by glnB) is uridylylated
by GlnD, an uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing
enzyme [11,12]. The uridylylated PII interacts with an
adenylyltransferase to deadenylylate and activate the GS
enzyme (encoded by glnA) [11,13]. In addition, the
NtrB/NtrC two-component system will activate the
expression of glnA under nitrogen-limiting conditions
[9,14-19]. By contrast, in response to high glutamine/aketoglutarate, the uridylylated PII is deuridylylated by
GlnD. The unmodified PII protein interacts with adenylyltransferase thereby causing the adenylylation and
inactivation of the GS enzyme [11,12]. The unmodified
PII protein also interacts with the NtrB/NtrC two-component system to inactivate the expression of glnA
[9,14-19]. Thus bacterial PII proteins are sensors of aketoglutarate and adenylate energy charge, whereas
GlnD is the sensor of glutamine [20,21].
Little is known about amino acid sensing and signaling in plants. PII-like proteins have been identified in
Arabidopsis and rice [22,23]. However, bacterial GlnD
homologs have yet to be identified in plants. The E. coli
sensor protein GlnD is composed of a nucleotide transferase domain, a nucleotide hydrolase domain, and two
C-terminal ACT domains. It has been shown that the
C-terminal ACT domains of GlnD may regulate its
activity through the binding of glutamine [21].
The ACT domain, named after bacterial aspartate
kinase, chorismate mutase and TyrA (prephenate dehydrogenase), is a regulatory domain that serves as an
amino acid-binding site in feedback-regulated amino
acid metabolic enzymes [24-28]. For instance, the E. coli
3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH), a key
enzyme in serine biosynthesis, is feedback regulated by
serine. The C-terminal ACT domain of E. coli PGDH is
the binding site for its allosteric effector serine
[24,29,30]. The other amino acid metabolic enzymes
such as acetohydroxyacid synthase [31], threonine deaminase [32,33], and phenylalanine hydroxylase [34] also
contain the regulatory ACT domain. In addition, the
ACT domain is also found in several transcription factors [35-39].
We previously identified a novel type of ACT domaincontaining protein family in Arabidopsis, whose members contain four ACT domain repeats (the “ACR” protein family) [40]. Other than the ACT domain, the
amino acid sequences of the ACR proteins do not have
homology to any known enzymes or motifs in the database
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/).
Although proteins homologous to the ACR family have

Page 2 of 10

been identified in rice [41-43], the functions of these
ACR proteins are largely unknown.
In this report, we have identified four additional ACT
domain-containing proteins in Arabidopsis. These proteins are composed of three or two copies of the ACT
domain. The amino acid sequences of these proteins do
not have any recognizable motifs except the ACT
domain. These novel ACT domain-containing proteins
are classified as new members of the ACR family. We
showed that the newly identified ACR11 and ACR12
proteins are localized to the chloroplast. Interestingly,
the expression of ACR11 is co-regulated with GLN2 that
encodes a chloroplastic glutamine synthetase (GS). The
possible functions of Arabidopsis ACR11 are discussed
herein.

Results
Identification of four novel ACR genes in Arabidopsis

We previously used the ACT domain (Pfam01842) and
bacterial GlnD sequences to identify Arabidopsis ACR1
to ACR8 proteins, which contain four copies of the
ACT domain [40]. In addition to these ACR proteins,
we have identified four novel ACT domain-containing
proteins encoded by At1g16880, At2g36840, At2g39570
and At5g04740, which contain two or three copies of
the ACT domain. Since these proteins also contain ACT
domain repeats, we propose to classify these proteins as
new members of the ACR family. We named the proteins encoded by At2g39570, At2g36840, At1g16880 and
At5g04740 genes ACR9, ACR10, ACR11 and ACR12,
respectively. According to amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, ACR1 to ACR12 proteins are divided into three groups (Figure 1A). The
originally identified ACR1 to ACR8 proteins belong to
Group I. The newly identified ACR9 to ACR12 belong
to Group II (ACR9 and ACR10) and Group III (ACR11
and ACR12), respectively (Figure 1A).
ACR9 and ACR10 have almost identical gene structures
with respect to size and arrangement of their exons and
introns (Figure 1B). By contrast, ACR11 and ACR12 have
the same numbers of exon and intron, but some of the
introns are different in size (Figure 1B). We used the
computer program InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
Tools/InterProScan/) to analyze domain compositions of
ACR9 to ACR12. The ACR9 and ACR10 proteins contain
three copies of the ACT domain, whereas the ACR11 and
ACR12 proteins contain two copies of the ACT domain
(Figure 1C). Similar to the ACR1 to ACR8 proteins, the
ACR9 to ACR12 proteins do not have other known
domains or motifs as revealed by InterProScan.
Sequence analysis of Arabidopsis ACR11 and ACR12

According to the sequences in the GenBank, we
designed specific primers and used RT-PCR to amplify

domains of E. coli GlnD. Full-length amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis ACR1 to ACR12 and amino acid residues 708-890 of E. coli GlnD were
aligned by ClustalW2 and the neighbor-joining algorithm was used to obtain the phylogenetic tree. (B) Schematic gene structures of Arabidopsis

full-length cDNAs of ACR11 and ACR12. The ACR11
and ACR12 proteins have 290 and 301 amino acid residues, respectively. Amino acid sequence alignment of
ACR11 and ACR12 shows that the N-terminal regions
of these two proteins are not highly conserved. Beyond
the N-terminal regions, the amino acid sequences in
ACR11 (residues 74 to 290) and ACR12 (residues 85 to
301), share 63% identity and 82% similarity (Figure 2A).
Several computer programs including PSORT (http://
www.psort.org/) and TargetP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/TargetP/) predicted that the ACR11 and ACR12

proteins are localized to the chloroplast. Most nuclearencoded chloroplast proteins contain N-terminal transit
peptide sequences that facilitate the transfer of these
proteins from the cytoplasm to the chloroplast. The
transit peptides will be cleaved after the precursor proteins are imported into chloroplasts. In ACR11 and
ACR12, the less conserved N-terminal sequences may
function as transit peptides to target these proteins to
the chloroplast. Indeed, the computer program ChloroP
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/) predicts the
presence of transit peptides in both proteins, and the

GlnD2). The predicted secondary structure of the ACTc is shown above the sequences. Arrow indicates the conserved glycine residue in the b1a1 loop region. Identical and similar amino acid residues are shaded in black and gray, respectively.

locations of potential transit peptide cleavage sites are
between the 52Arg-53Leu of ACR11, and the 32Pro33Ala of ACR12, respectively (Figure 2A).
Protein BLAST analyses revealed that ACR11 and
ACR12 are most similar to the ACT domains of bacterial PII-uridylyltransferase (GlnD) in addition to their
homologs in photosynthetic organisms (data not
shown). We aligned the ACT domains from Arabidopsis
ACR11 and ACR12 with the two ACT domains from E.
coli GlnD and the ACT consensus sequence from
Pfam01842. The structure of the ACT consensus
sequence is predicted to form a babbab fold, which is
in accordance with the archetypical structure of the
ACT domain of E. coli PGDH [24]. In addition, the
initial identification and alignment of ACT domains
uncovered a nearly invariant Gly residue at the turn
between the first b strand and the first a helix that
coincided with the binding site for Ser in E. coli PGDH
[25]. The alignment of ACT domains from ACR11,
ACR12 and GlnD indicated that these sequences are
highly conserved in the b1-a1 loop region (Figure 2B).
Moreover, the invariant Gly residue is also present in
the ACT domains of Arabidopsis ACR11 and ACR12
(Figure 2B).
The ACR11- and ACR12-GFP are localized to the
chloroplast

We used green fluorescent fusion protein (GFP) and
protoplast transient expression assay to examine the
subcellular localization of ACR11 and ACR12. The fulllength ACR11 and the first 94 amino acids of ACR12
were fused to the N-terminus of a GFP. The resulting
ACR11- and ACR12-GFP fusion constructs driven by a
cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were
transformed into Arabidopsis protoplasts. Confocal
microscopy was used to observe the fluorescent signals
16 h after transformation. The green fluorescent signals
of ACR11- and ACR12-GFP fusion proteins co-localized
with the auto-fluorescent signals of chlorophylls in the
chloroplasts (Figure 3). By contrast, the protoplast transformed with the empty GFP vector alone has green
fluorescent signals in the cytosol and nucleus (Figure 3).
These results suggest that the Arabidopsis ACR11 and
ACR12 proteins are localized to the chloroplast.
Coexpression gene networks of Arabidopsis ACR11 and
ACR12

The functions of Arabidopsis ACR11 and ACR12 are
completely unknown. It has been suggested that genes
involved in related biological pathways are often
expressed cooperatively [44]. We attempted to identify
the functions of ACR11 and ACR12 by searching for
genes that are coexpressed with ACR11 and ACR12,
respectively. We obtained the ACR11 and ACR12

first 94 amino acids of ACR12 fused to GFP, respectively.

coexpression gene networks from the ATTED-II database (http://atted.jp/) [45]. The three genes having the
highest mutual rank (MR) with ACR11 are At5g35630
(GLN2, encodes a chloroplastic glutamine synthetase;
MR = 1.0), At1g15545 (encodes an unknown protein;
MR = 8.5), and At5g64460 (encodes an unknown protein; MR = 9.2) (Figure 4A). It is intriguing to find that
ACR11 and GLN2 have the highest mutual rank of coexpression compared with all other genes in the Arabidopsis genome. By contrast, the top three genes that are
coexpressed with ACR12 are At3g29350 (encodes AHP2,
histidine-containing phosphotransmitter2; MR = 2.2),
At1g10200 (encodes WLIM1, a member of the Arabidopsis LIM proteins; MR = 6.2), and At1g49820
(encodes MTK1, 5-methylthioribose kinase1; MR = 7.5)
(Figure 4B). The expression of ACR12 is not co-ordinately regulated with ACR11 and GLN2 in the ATTEDII database.
The expression of ACR11 and GLN2 is up-regulated by
light and sucrose

We used RNA gel blot analysis to examine the expression patterns of ACR11 and GLN2 in different organs
from 6-week-old Arabidopsis plants. Steady-state levels
of ACR11 and GLN2 mRNAs are low in roots compared
to those of leaves, stems, and flowers (Figure 5). It is

well known that the expression of Arabidopsis GLN2 is
regulated by light and sucrose [46]. We used RNA gel
blot analysis to examine the effects of light and sucrose
on the expression of ACR11 and GLN2 (Figure 6). Two
weeks old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on a 16 h light/8
h dark cycle were transferred to media containing 0%
sucrose, 3% sucrose or 3% manitol, and dark-adapted or
grown in continuous light for 48 h. Total RNA extracted
from these samples was used for RNA gel blot analysis.
In dark-adapted seedlings, steady-state levels of ACR11
and GLN2 mRNAs are slightly increased by 3% sucrose
treatment. This sucrose effect is not related to an osmotic change, because the addition of 3% mannitol does

not increase the accumulation of ACR11 and GLN2
transcripts. By contrast, steady-state levels of ACR11
and GLN2 mRNAs are significantly increased by the
light treatment, regardless of the amounts of sucrose or
mannitol in the media. The expression patterns of
ACR11 and GLN2 are almost identical under these
treatments. These results confirm that the ACR11 and
GLN2 genes are expressed cooperatively under various
conditions.
ACR11 promoter-GUS activity

To further examine the cell type and tissue specific
expression of the ACR11 gene, we fused the putative

(Figure 7A-C). Interestingly, the ACR11p-GUS activity
was not detected in emerging young leaves and the
basal part of maturing leaves, which are mainly composed of dividing and growing young cells (Figure 7CE). In developing or mature flowers, the ACR11p-GUS
activity was detected in sepals as a gradient from the
apical part (high) to the basal part (low) (Figure 7F and
7G). In mature flowers, the ACR11p-GUS activity was
also detected in the style (Figure 7G). In mature siliques,
the ACR11p-GUS activity was detected in the tip of the
pedicel (Figure 7H).

promoter of ACR11 to a b-glucuronidase reporter gene
(ACR11p-GUS) and generated stable Arabidopsis transgenic lines. The ACR11p-GUS activity was detected in
the cotyledons of 3-, 5- and 7-day-old seedlings

Figure 6 The expression of Arabidopsis ACR11 and GLN2 is coregulated by sucrose and light/dark treatments. Total RNA (10
μg) from 14-day-old Arabidopsis plants treated with complete
darkness or continuous light for 48 h was used for RNA gel blot
analysis. During the dark or light treatment, plants were grown on
MS media containing 0% sucrose, 3% sucrose, or 3% mannitol. The
expression of ACR11 and GLN2 is up-regulated by sucrose and light.

We previously reported the identification and characterization of eight ACT domain repeat proteins in
Arabidopsis and named these proteins ACR1 to
ACR8, respectively [40]. These ACR proteins each
contain four copies of the ACT domain. Here, we
describe four additional ACT domain-containing proteins in Arabidopsis. Except in the regions of the
ACT domain, the amino acid sequences of these
novel ACT domain-containing proteins are not similar to the originally identified ACR proteins. However,

they also contain multiple copies of the ACT domain.
We thus adopted the term “ACT domain repeats
(ACR)” and named these proteins ACR9 to ACR12,
respectively.
Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic
analysis clearly divided these ACR proteins into three
different groups. The originally identified ACR1 to
ACR8 proteins contain four copies of the ACT
domain and belong to Group I. The ACR9 and
ACR10 proteins have three copies of the ACT
domain, which are classified as Group II ACR proteins. The amino acid sequences of ACR9 and ACR10
are very similar throughout the entire polypeptides.
Moreover, the gene structures of ACR9 and ACR10
are almost identical (Figure 1B), which suggests that
these two genes are recently duplicated in the Arabidopsis genome during evolution. By contrast, Group
III ACR proteins, including ACR11 and ACR12, contain two copies of the ACT domain. The gene structures of ACR11 and ACR12 are similar. However, the
encoded amino acid sequences are not conserved in
the N-terminal regions. The rest of the amino acid
sequences, e.g. residues 74 to 290 of ACR11, and residues 85 to 301 of ACR12, are highly conserved. The
non-conserved N-terminal amino acid sequences of
ACR11 and ACR12 are predicted to be transit peptides, which target these proteins to the chloroplast.
Thus Group III ACR proteins may be localized to the
chloroplast.
Group III ACR proteins are localized to the chloroplast

Most amino acids are synthesized in the chloroplast. It
is expected that some regulatory proteins involved in
amino acid metabolism or signaling may also exist in
the chloroplast. The Arabidopsis Group III ACR proteins are good candidates in this regard, because they
are predicted to target to the chloroplast. We used transient expression assay in Arabidopsis protoplasts to verify that the ACR11- and ACR12-GFP fusion proteins are
localized to the chloroplast (Figure 3). After the removal
of transit peptide, the mature ACR11 and ACR12 proteins are only composed of two ACT domains. It is conceivable that the ACT domains of the ACR11 and
ACR12 proteins may serve as amino acid binding
domains. Upon binding to specific amino acids, the
ACR11 and ACR12 proteins may regulate the activities
of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes in the chloroplast.
Alternatively, the two ACT domains of the ACR11 and
ACR12 proteins may function as specific amino acid
sensors in the chloroplast, which are similar to those of
bacterial GlnD proteins. It will be interesting to further
characterize the functions of the Arabidopsis ACR11
and ACR12 proteins and their homologs in the other
plants.

ACR11 and GLN2 are in the same coexpressed gene
network

Genes involved in related biological pathways are often
coordinately regulated [44]. The coexpression analysis
obtained from the ATTED-II database (http://atted.jp)
may help us to identify the functions of Arabidopsis
ACR11 and ACR12. In the ATTED-II database, the
ACR11 and ACR12 genes have distinct coexpressed gene
networks (Figure 4). It is possible that the proteins
encoded by these two homologous genes may also have
distinct functions in Arabidopsis chloroplasts. It is intriguing that the Arabidopsis ACR11 and GLN2 are in the
same coexpressed gene network. Moreover, the mutual
rank for coexpression of these two genes is the highest
in their respective gene networks (Figure 4). It is well
known that the expression of Arabidopsis GLN2 is regulated by light and sugars [46]. We used RNA gel blot
analysis to examine the effects of light and sucrose on
the expression of ACR11. Interestingly, the results are in
accordance with the coexpression analysis in the database. Steady-state levels of both ACR11 and GLN2
mRNAs are increased by treatments of sucrose and light
(Figure 6). The highly cooperative expression of ACR11
and GLN2 observed in our experiments and in the database suggests that these two genes may belong to the
same functional module. The GLN2 encodes a chloroplastic GS2, which is the major enzyme for glutamine
synthesis in the chloroplast. However, the functions of
the chloroplast-localized ACR11 protein are completely
unknown. The ACR11 and GLN2 genes have the highest
coexpression relationship in the Arabidopsis genome
suggests that the ACR11 protein may have functions
related to GS2.
The relationship between Arabidopsis ACR11 and GS2
is reminiscent of the PII-GlnD system in the regulation
of glnA gene expression and GS enzyme activity in bacteria [7-10,18]. In addition to the ACR homologs in
plants, the amino acid sequence of ACR11 is most similar to the ACT domains of the bacterial sensor protein
GlnD (e.g. uridylyltransferase). Thus the ACR11
(At1g16880) was annotated as uridylyltransferase-related
protein in the GenBank (NM_101549). The bacterial
GlnD protein may sense the availability of glutamine,
possibly via the two ACT domains in the C-terminal
region, to regulate GS enzyme activity and its gene
expression [21]. It is possible that the Arabidopsis
ACR11 protein may also use its ACT domains to sense
the availability of glutamine in the chloroplast, and then
regulates GS2 activity or glutamine metabolism.
ACR11 and ACR12, putative amino acid sensor proteins in
the chloroplast

Chloroplast is the site of active primary and secondary
nitrogen assimilation inside a plant cell. The assimilation

Sung et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:118
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/118

of ammonia into glutamine is the major pathway to
convert inorganic nitrogen into organic nitrogen in
plants. Thus it is expected that plants may have a
mechanism to sense the availability of glutamine inside
the chloroplast. In E. coli, glutamine may serve as a signaling molecule to affect the expression of nitrogen
assimilatory genes and the activities of nitrogen metabolic enzymes [7]. The two ACT domains located in the
C-terminal region of the GlnD protein are considered as
glutamine sensors in bacteria [21]. Little is known about
amino acid sensing and signaling in plants. Interestingly,
the ACR11 and ACR12 proteins are composed of two
ACT domains, and are localized to the chloroplast. It is
conceivable that the ACR11 and ACR12 proteins may
function as amino acid sensors in Arabidopsis. Future
studies are needed to determine the functions of these
chloroplastic ACR proteins.

Conclusions
Although the ACT domains have high sequence divergence, there is a common regulatory theme among these
domains. The Arabidopsis ACR proteins contain multiple
copies of the ACT domain and their functions are largely
unknown. In this study, we identified two new groups of
ACR proteins in Arabidopsis. Group II ACR proteins,
ACR9 and ACR10, have three copies of the ACT domain.
Whereas group III ACR proteins, ACR11 and ACR12,
contain two copies of the ACT domain, and are localized
to the chloroplast. The activities of ACR11 promoter-GUS
are mainly detected in mature leaves. Moreover, the
expression of ACR11 and GLN2 is highly coordinated. The
ACR11 may function as a regulatory protein involved in
glutamine metabolism or sensing in Arabidopsis.
Methods
Plant material and growth conditions

Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was grown in
soils in the greenhouse on a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at
23°C. Roots, leaves, stems, flowers, and siliques from the
same batch of 6-week-old soil-grown plants were used
for total RNA extraction. For experiments in which
plants were transferred to 0%, 3% sucrose or 3% mannitol, seeds were sown on 1.5 cm × 8 cm Nylon nets with
250 μm mesh size (Tetko, Elmsford, NY, USA, catalog
no. 3-250/50), placed on the surface of the Murashige
and Skoog (MS) plates [MS salts (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St.
Louis, MO), pH adjusted to 5.7 with 1N KOH, 0.8% (w/
v) phytoagar] containing 3% sucrose. After cold treatment at 4°C for 48 h, plates were vertically placed in a
23°C chamber on a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle for two
weeks. The plants and the nylon nets were lifted and
transferred to fresh MS media containing 0%, 3%
sucrose or 3% mannitol, and dark-adapted or grown in
continuous light for 48 h.

Cloning of Arabidopsis ACR9, ACR10, ACR11 and ACR12
cDNAs

Total RNA from 2-week-old Arabidopsis was used for
reverse transcription-PCR (SuperScript II RT Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to amplify ACR9 (At2g39570),
ACR10 (At2g36840), ACR11 (At1g16880) and ACR12
(At5g04740) cDNAs. The following primers were used
to amplify full-length cDNAs: ACR9, 5’-TGTTGTT
GATTCATTGGCTC-3’ and 5’-AGTAGTAGATGAATATATTG-3’; ACR10, 5’-ATAGGAGGAACAACACAAAC-3’ and 5’-TTACTATGAAACCCACACAG-3’;
ACR11, 5’-AAAAGGATCCATGGCTATGGCCTCT
GCTTC-3’ and 5’-GGGGAGGCCTGAAACTTGACTC
GTCAGTTG-3’; ACR12, 5’-AGGGACCGGTATGGCG
TTCTCGAGTTCCAT-3’ and 5’-GGGGACCGGTGTAGCTGTCAATGTCAGTTT-3’. The PCR products
were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega Co.,
Madison, WI) and provided for sequencing. The Arabidopsis ACR9 to ACR12 cDNA sequences were verified
and deposited in the GenBank (JF797174 to JF797177).
Sequence analysis

The amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis ACR1
(NM_125986),
ACR2
(NM_122441),
ACR3
(NM_179566),
ACR4
(NM_202378),
ACR5
(NM_126420),
ACR6
(NM_111065),
ACR7
(NM_118407), ACR8 (NM_101114), ACR9 (JF797174),
ACR10 (JF797175), ACR11 (JF797176), ACR12
(JF797177), and amino acid residues 708-890 of E. coli
GlnD (M96431) were aligned by ClustalW2 with default
settings (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/).
The neighbor-joining algorithm was used to obtain the
phylogenetic tree. The sequence alignment was shaded
with BOXSHADE 3.21 (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan/) was used to analyze the domain
composition of ACR9 to ACR12. PSORT (http://www.
psort.org/) and TargetP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
TargetP/) were used to predict the subcellular localization of ACR9 to ACR12. ChloroP (http://www.cbs.dtu.
dk/services/ChloroP/) was used to predict the transit
peptide cleavage sites of ACR11 and ACR12. The
ACR11 and ACR12 coexpression gene networks were
obtained from the ATTED-II database (http://atted.jp/).
ACR11- and ACR12-GFP fusion constructs

The GFP expression vector pHBT, designed for transient expression assays [47], was used to construct the
ACR11- and ACR12-GFP fusions. A BamHI/StuI fragment from the pGEM-T-ACR11 clone containing the
full-length ACR11 cDNA was subcloned into the pHBT
vector to create an ACR11-GFP fusion construct. The
N-terminal cDNA sequence encoding the first 94 amino
acids of ACR12 was amplified by PCR using primers 5’-

GGAAGGATCCATGGCGTTCTCGAGTTCCATC-3’
and 5’-GGAAAGGCCTCATTGGAACAACGTCGTCATC-3’. The PCR product was digested with BamHI
and StuI, and cloned into the N-terminus of the GFP in
the pHBT vector. The resulting construct, ACR12-GFP,
contains the putative transit peptide of ACR12 fused to
a GFP. The obtained ACR11- and ACR12-GFP constructs, and the GFP empty vector were transformed
into Arabidopsis protoplasts using polyethylene glycol
(PEG)-mediated transient gene expression [47] and
observed under confocal laser scanning microscope (510
META Zeiss) 16 h after transformation.
RNA gel blot analysis

Arabidopsis total RNA was isolated using a phenol extraction protocol [48]. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated in
standard formaldehyde gel by electrophoresis and blotted
onto a nylon membrane. For detection of ACR11 and
GLN2 mRNA, digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled single-stranded
DNA probes were generated by PCR using the following
primers: ACR11 (At1g16880), 5’-ATGGCTATGGCCT
CTGCTTC-3’, 5’-GAAACTTGACTCGTCAGTTG-3’;
GLN2 (At5g35630), 5’-GGTGAAGTTATGCCTGGA-3’,
5’-GAGAGACCACATAGACAC-3’. DIG probe labeling,
pre-hybridization, hybridization, wash conditions and
detection were performed according to the BoehringerMannheim Genius System User’s Guide: DIG Application
Manual for Filter Hybridization.
ACR11 promoter-GUS fusion

ACR11 (At1g16880) and its upstream gene At1g16870 are
in an opposite orientation. There are 638 nucleotides
between the initiation codons (ATG) of these two genes.
The putative promoter of ACR11 (-1 to -625 of the start
codon) was amplified from the Arabidopsis genomic
DNA by PCR using the primers 5’-CACCTCTAGACACTCAAAAATCGGAATTAA-3’ and 5’-AACAAAG
CTTATCTCTTGAGTCTGACTCAA-3’. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (TOPO
TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) and the sequence was confirmed. A HindIII/XbaI fragment containing the 0.625 kb
ACR11 promoter region was subcloned into the pBI101
binary vector to create an ACR11 promoter-GUS fusion
construct that was transformed into the Agrobacterium
tumefaciens strain GV3101.
The floral dip method was used for Arabidopsis transformation [49]. Several independent ACR11 promoterGUS Arabidopsis transgenic lines were grown to T3
homozygous and stained for GUS activity [50].
