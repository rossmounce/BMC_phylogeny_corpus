Abstract
Background: In microorganisms and plants, the first two reactions of arginine biosynthesis are
catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) and N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK). In
mammals, NAGS produces an essential activator of carbamylphosphate synthetase I, the first
enzyme of the urea cycle, and no functional NAGK homolog has been found. Unlike the other urea
cycle enzymes, whose bacterial counterparts could be readily identified by their sequence
conservation with arginine biosynthetic enzymes, mammalian NAGS gene was very divergent,
making it the last urea cycle gene to be discovered. Limited sequence similarity between E. coli
NAGS and fungal NAGK suggests that bacterial and eukaryotic NAGS, and fungal NAGK arose
from the fusion of genes encoding an ancestral NAGK (argB) and an acetyltransferase. However,
mammalian NAGS no longer retains any NAGK catalytic activity.
Results: We identified a novel bifunctional N-acetylglutamate synthase and kinase (NAGS-K) in
the Xanthomonadales order of gamma-proteobacteria that appears to resemble this postulated
primordial fusion protein. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that xanthomonad NAGS-K is more
closely related to mammalian NAGS than to other bacterial NAGS. We cloned the NAGS-K gene
from Xanthomonas campestis, and characterized the recombinant NAGS-K protein. Mammalian
NAGS and its bacterial homolog have similar affinities for substrates acetyl coenzyme A and
glutamate as well as for their allosteric regulator arginine.
Conclusion: The close phylogenetic relationship and similar biochemical properties of
xanthomonad NAGS-K and mammalian NAGS suggest that we have identified a close relative to
the bacterial antecedent of mammalian NAGS and that the enzyme from X. campestris could
become a good model for mammalian NAGS in structural, biochemical and biophysical studies.

Background
The biosynthesis of arginine in microorganisms and
plants is accomplished in eight enzymatic steps (Figure 1,
[1,2]). The first reaction in arginine biosynthesis is Nacetylation of glutamate by N-acetylglutamate synthase
(NAGS; EC 2.3.1.1). The second reaction of arginine biosynthesis is phosphorylation of the γ-carboxyl group of
NAG by N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK; EC 2.7.2.8) to
produce N-acetylglutamylphosphate (NAGP) which is
subsequently converted to ornithine in two more steps
(Figure 1, [1]). In fungi, plants and many bacteria, a cyclic
pathway occurs in the first portion of arginine biosynthesis (Figure 1, [1,2]). Organisms with a cyclic pathway use
ornithine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.35) to regenerate Nacetylglutamate (NAG) via transfer of acetyl group from
N-acetylornithine to glutamate. The role of NAGS in
organisms with ornithine acetyltransferase is to replenish
the NAG that is lost due to cell growth and division [2]. In
these microorganisms, both NAGS and NAGK are inhibited by arginine [2] whereas in organisms with the linear
pathway, NAGS is the target of feedback inhibition by
arginine. Enterobacteria, Vibrio-like bacteria, a delta-proteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus, Xanthomonas campestris
and the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus do not posses ornithine acetyltransferase; these organisms have a linear
pathway, where NAGS is the sole source of NAG and
therefore essential for the arginine biosynthesis [1,3-9]. In
bacteria, two broad classes of NAGS have been found:
"full-length" sequences of approximately 440 amino acids
that resemble Echerichia coli NAGS, and "short" NAGS
such as those in Mycobacterium tuberculosis of approximately 170 amino acids in length [8,10,11]. In both the
linear and cyclic arginine biosynthetic pathways, the same
enzymes and intermediates are used in the final four steps
from ornithine to arginine (Figure 1). In eukaryotes,
arginine biosynthesis is partitioned across organelles with
fungal NAGS and NAGK located in the mitochondria [1219] and the cognate plant enzymes located in the chloroplasts [20].
In mammals, amphibians, fish and some invertebrates,
NAGS, carbamylphosphate synthase, together with the
last four enzymes of the arginine biosynthesis pathway
and arginase comprise the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that converts waste nitrogen in the form of ammonia
into urea [2,21]. Urea functions as an osmolyte in some
fish, whereas its role in teleost fish is still unclear [22]. In
mammals and other land animals, the urea cycle protects
the central nervous system from the toxic effects of ammonia [2,21]. In these organisms, NAGS is localized in the
mitochondria and catalyzes formation of NAG, which is
an essential allosteric activator of carbamylphosphate synthase I (CPSI) [21]. Interestingly, the enzymatic activity of
mammalian NAGS is not inhibited but rather increases in
the presence of arginine [23-26]. The physiological signif-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/4

icance of NAGS activation by arginine is not clear since its
estimated intramitochondrial concentration appears to be
sufficiently high to saturate NAGS and result in its maximal activity [24,27,28].
Unlike other enzymes of the urea cycle, which are conserved across phyla [29-31], the similarity between mammalian and fungal NAGS is relatively low [32] and the
fungal and bacterial enzymes are even more divergent
[12]. Closer examination of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
NAGS and NAGK primary sequences shows the C-terminal regions of both enzymes share similarity with the Cterminal half of E. coli NAGS, while the N-terminal region
of S. cerevisiae NAGK has homology to the E. coli NAGK
[33]. The N-terminal region of S. cerevisiae NAGS appears
more divergent and whether it has any catalytic function
is unknown [12,33]. Limited sequence similarity between
NAGK from Neurospora crassa and NAGS from E. coli led
to the hypothesis that bacterial NAGS and fungal NAGK
may have common ancestry [14]. The mammalian NAGS
also shares similarity with fungal NAGK [32], enough that
the gene was misannotated as a NAGK in initial releases of
the human genome project.
An evolutionary model was proposed in a recent analysis
of the arginine biosynthesis pathway that the present day
NAGS arose by fusion of ancestral bacterial argB (NAGK)
gene and an acetyltransferase gene [8]. This suggests that
NAGS and fungal NAGK evolved from a gene encoding a
bifunctional enzyme with both N-acetylglutamate synthase and kinase activities.
In our search for homologs of mammalian NAGS, we
identified a novel gene in Xanthomonas campestris that
encodes a bifunctional protein which can catalyze the first
two reactions of the arginine biosynthesis pathway. We
used phylogenetic analysis to show that this novel Nacetylglutamate synthase – N-acetylglutamate kinase
(NAGS-K or argA-B) is more closely related to mammalian
NAGS than to other bacterial NAGS (argA) genes. In this
paper, we report on the cloning and characterization of
this novel argA-B gene and its XcNAGS-K protein.

Results
Identification of the argA-B gene coding for a bifunctional
NAGS-K
Genes coding for the bifunctional NAGS-K proteins were
identified in the genomes of several Xanthomonadales
based on the similarity of their amino acid sequence to
human and mouse NAGS genes. These genes were annotated as argB in X. campestris, Xanthomonas axonopodis and
Xylella fastidiosa; proteins encoded by these argB genes are
80–98% identical and 85–98% similar to each other but
they also showed 34–36% identity and 41–43% similarity
to human and mouse NAGS. The similarity between the

putative NAGS gene from Xanthomonadales and mammalian NAGS genes spans what we term the "conserved
segment" of NAGS [34]. These xanthomonad putative
NAGS genes represent the first bacterial genes with significant sequence similarity to mammalian NAGS. To confirm this, we performed phylogenetic analysis of known
and candidate NAGS and NAGK protein sequences.
Included in the analysis were sequences of enzymatically
validated NAGS [4,15,32,34-38] as well as predicted proteins that showed similarity to human NAGS and E. coli
argA in BLAST searches of GenBank. The NAGS from
plants,
beta-proteobacteria,
gamma-proteobacteria
including argB gene products from Xanthomonadales and
three marine alpha-proteobacteria all share similarity
with E. coli NAGS. Sequences with higher similarity to
human NAGS were those from mammals, other vertebrates, fungi and amoeba, but also the fungal NAGK.
Interestingly, the argB gene products from Xanthomonadales and three marine alpha-proteobacteria were more
similar to human NAGS than even the fungal NAGS. In
archaeal genomes there were no candidate NAGS genes
with sequences similar either to full-length NAGS from E.
coli or mammalian NAGS; genes that encode shorter proteins have been annotated as NAGS in archaea [8,10].
We assembled NAGS protein sequences from 31 organisms including both bacteria and eukaryotes for phylogenetic analysis. Included were enzymatically validated as
well as candidate NAGS from mammals (human [34],
mouse [32], rat, cow and dog), candidate NAGS from
other vertebrates (frog, zebrafish, pufferfish and freshwater pufferfish), two characterized fungal NAGS from S. cerevisiae and N. crassa [15,36,37] and two candidate fungal
NAGS from Schisosaccharomyces pombe and Candida albicans, a candidate NAGS from an amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, candidate NAGS enzymes from plants (soy,
tomato, corn, rice and arabidopsis), bacterial NAGS from
E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and Pseudomonas syringae that have been previously characterized [4,35,36,38], candidate NAGS from Ralstonia
eutropha and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (beta-proteobacteria),
three putative NAGS from Xanthomonadales (X. campestris, X. axonopodis and X. fastidiosa) and three candidate
NAGS from marine alpha-proteobacteria (Maricaulis
maris, Oceanicaulis alexandrii and Parvularcula bermudensis). The putative NAGS from the bacterium Ralstonia
eutropha was included in this analysis because it had a
high similarity score to both NAGS from E. coli and
humans (E-values: 7 × 10-108 and 1 × 10-5, respectively).
Fungal NAGK from S. cerevisiae [13], N. crassa [14],
Schizosaccharomyces pombe [18] and C. albicans [16] were
included based on the previously noted similarity
between N. crassa NAGK and E. coli NAGS [14].

Figure 2 shows a phylogenetic tree generated using the
neighbor joining method with a PMB amino acid substitution matrix [39]. Phylogenetic trees were also generated
using the neighbor joining with a Jones-Taylor-Thornton
amino acid substitution matrix and parsimony methods
[40]. Both phylogenetic trees had the same topology as
the one shown in Figure 2. NAGS and NAGK sequences
clustered in two groups. NAGS sequences from vertebrates, Xanthomonadales, three marine alpha-proteobacteria, fungi and amoeba, and fungal NAGK are in one
cluster indicating that they are more closely related to
each other than to the members of another cluster containing plant and other bacterial NAGS. These two groupings of NAGS and NAGK were strongly supported by high
bootstrap values (>700) in all of the phylogenetic trees
that were generated.
The high similarity and close evolutionary relationship
between vertebrate NAGS and products of genes annotated as argB in Xanthomonadales led to the hypothesis
that the xanthomonad genes encoded NAGS and not
NAGK. However, closer inspection of the arginine operon
from X. campestris (Figure 3A) revealed a gene coding for
a hypothetical protein of 203 amino acids in length annotated as argA, in addition to the argB gene that we had
identified as a close relative of vertebrate NAGS. No other
genes in the operon or elsewhere in the X. campestris
genome were annotated as, or similar to, argB or NAGK.
Eight genes are clustered together in the arginine operon
of X. campestris; argD gene is located elsewhere in the
genome (Figure 3A). Arginine biosynthesis in Xanthomonadales is unusual because instead of ornithine
transcarbamylase (argF) they use acetylornithine transcarbamylase (AOTCase or argF') for biosynthesis of acetylcitrulline, which is subsequently deacetylated by the argE
gene product [7]. Query of the NCBI Conserved Domain
database with the sequence of the hypothetical ArgAprotein from X. campestris revealed that it is similar to acetyltransferases of the GNAT superfamily. We cloned the
hypothetical argA gene from the X. campestris, overexpressed it in E. coli, and purified the protein. Under conditions where the X. campestris ArgBprotein showed
abundant NAGS activity (enzymatic acetylation of glutamate), the ArgA protein had none (data not shown). It is
likely that the ArgA recombinant protein was inactive
because it lacked an important cofactor or interacting
partner or it does not use acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and/
or glutamate as substrates.
The sequence of the argB gene product from X. campestris
was aligned with mouse NAGS, NAGK with known threedimensional structures from E. coli and T. maritima (Figure 3B) [41,42], and fungal NAGS and NAGK from S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Amino acids that are important for
binding of the NAGK substrates, ATP and NAG, as well as

Organization of the arginine operon in X. campestris and amino acid sequence conservation between NAGS-K
and both NAGS and NAGK. A. The arginine operon in X. campestris. ArgC, argD, argG and argH genes were identified based
on their similarity with homologs in other bacteria. ArgF' encodes acetylornithine transcarbamylase (AOTCase) and argE gene
product can catalyze deacetylation of acetylornithine as well as acetylcitrulline [7]. The argA gene was annotated based on its

those involved in catalysis of NAGP formation [41] were
conserved in the argB gene product from X. campestris,
bacterial and fungal NAGK. These amino acids, which are
also conserved in other bacterial argB genes [41], are highlighted in red in Figure 3B. This figure also shows the conservation of amino acids (in green), found in the Cterminal half of NAGS from vertebrates and fungi [43]
with those of the xanthomonad argB gene product. Three
of these conserved amino acids, highlighted in gray, are
mutated in patients with NAGS deficiency [43,44] and
therefore are important for the function of mammalian
NAGS. Moreover, the amino acid motif (R/Q)XXGXG
(shown in blue in Figure 3B), characteristic of the AcCoA
binding sites [45,46] is present in the mammalian NAGS
and the xanthomonad argB gene product.
Based on this evidence we hypothesized that genes annotated as argB in Xanthomonadales encoded a dual-function enzyme that catalyzed the first two reactions of the
arginine biosynthesis: formation of NAG from glutamate
and AcCoA, and phosphorylation of NAG to form NAGP
[1]. We henceforth refer to these genes as argA-B and their
products NAGS-K. The argA-B designation reflects the two
reactions catalyzed by the product of this gene: the argA
reaction (synthesis of NAG) followed by the argB reaction
(phosphorylation of NAG), which are catalyzed by two
discrete proteins, ArgAand ArgBin E. coli.
Cloning of the argA-B gene from X. campestris and
purification of recombinant NAGS-K
The argA-B gene was cloned from X. campestris genomic
DNA and inserted into an E. coli expression plasmid to
produce recombinant protein. We were able to overexpress the XcNAGS-K protein and purify it to homogeneity
(Figure 4). The denatured protein migrated as a single 50
kDa band, in good agreement with the predicted molecular weight of 50,149 Da. The purified protein was tested
for its ability to catalyze the formation of NAG and NAGP
and was biochemically characterized.

Table 1 shows that purified enzyme can catalyze the formation of NAG from glutamate and AcCoA (synthase
activity) as well as the formation of NAGP from NAG and
ATP (kinase activity), confirming that it is bifunctional.
The synthase activity was completely inhibited in the presence of 1 mM L-arginine suggesting that this enzyme is
likely a target of feedback inhibition by the final product
of arginine biosynthesis. The kinase activity of XcNAGS-K
was only slightly inhibited by 1 mM L-arginine (Table 1).
When ATP or NAG were omitted from the reaction, or
when EDTA was added, kinase activity was absent (data
not shown). We also tested the substrate specificity of
XcNAGS-K, and Table 2 shows that L-glutamate was the
only suitable acetyl acceptor in the synthase half-reaction
and that CTP and UTP could not replace ATP as substrates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/4

for the kinase half-reaction. We were unable to test if
XcNAGS-K could catalyze the coupled reaction for the formation of NAGP from glutamate, AcCoA and ATP,
because AcCoA reacted with hydroxylamine and FeCl3,
and produced a colored compound even in control reactions where heat inactivated enzyme was added.
Biochemical properties of XcNAGS-K
Km-values for AcCoA and L-glutamate and the corresponding maximal velocities were measured for purified
XcNAGS-K. We also examined whether the presence of a
polyhistidine affinity tag alters the biochemical properties
of the enzyme. Figure 5A illustrates that the dependence
of the rate of NAG formation on the concentration of
AcCoA deviates from Michaelis-Menten behavior and is
sigmoidal. This suggests cooperativity with respect to
binding of AcCoA. The presence of a polyhistidine tag did
not significantly alter the apparent Km-values for the substrates (Kmapp), maximal velocities (Vmax) or Hill coefficients (h) (Table 3). Figure 5B shows the dependence of
the rate of NAG formation on the concentration of Lglutamate. N-terminal polyhistidine tag did not significantly alter Kmapp and Vmax for L-glutamate (Table 3).

We were not able to examine the Km-values and turnover
numbers for NAG and ATP because of the limited sensitivity of the kinase colorimetric assay [47]. The rate of NAGP
formation was proportional to enzyme concentration and
linear with time under the conditions used to measure
activity (see Additional file 1), but the dynamic range of
the kinase colorimetric assay limited the usable enzyme
concentrations and reaction times needed to perform
detailed kinetic analysis.
Regulation of XcNAGS-K by arginine
In microorganisms and plants, NAGS is subject to feedback inhibition by L-arginine [2]. NAGK from E. coli,
which uses the linear arginine biosynthesis pathway, is
not inhibited by arginine, although NAGK in bacterial
fungi and plants that use the cyclic pathway are negatively
regulated by arginine [2]. Arginine has the opposite effect
in human, mouse and rat NAGS, where it increases activity [23-26]. Both the synthase and kinase activities of
XcNAGS-K are inhibited by arginine (Figure 6). However,
the synthase activity appears to be approximately 25 times
more sensitive to arginine than kinase activity; in
XcNAGS-K, without an affinity-tag, the half-maximal synthase and kinase activities were observed at 0.2 and 5.1
mM of arginine, respectively. The presence of an affinity
tag did not affect the inhibition of the synthase activity of
XcNAGS-K (Figure 6A). However, the arginine concentration sufficient for half-inhibition of the kinase activities of
XcNAGS-K with and without polyhistidine differed twofold (Figure 6B). Inhibition of both reactions by arginine

the two reactions is probably due to different requirements for interactions among charged groups upon binding of substrates and catalysis.

is consistent with XcNAGS-K being a target for feedback
inhibition in arginine biosynthesis.
Effect of pH on the enzymatic activities of XcNAGS-K
The effect of pH on XcNAGS-K activity was examined
using purified protein with an intact polyhistidine affinity
tag. Synthase and kinase activities were measured in a
series of buffers with different pH values. Table 4 shows
that the pH optimum for the synthase is 9.0 while it is 6.0
for the kinase. To rule out that buffering compounds used
to adjust the pH may have affected the enzymatic activities, we tested whether NaCl, MES, MOPS, Tris-HCl or
sodium acetate themselves had an effect on either synthase or kinase activities. The effects of variations in ionic
strength of the differing buffering compounds were examined by adding 200 mM NaCl to assay reactions. Table 5
illustrates that the addition of 100 mM NaCl, MOPS and
MES did not significantly alter synthase activity, while 100
mM sodium acetate and 200 mM NaCl inhibited the
activity by about 22%. The kinase activity of XcNAGS-K
did not change appreciably when 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM
MOPS, 100 mM Tris-HCl and 200 mM NaCl were added
to the reaction mixture. The difference in optimal pH for

Herein we describe a novel bifunctional N-acetylglutamate synthase and kinase (NAGS-K) from X. campestris
which is close bacterial homolog to mammalian NAGS. In
addition to sequence similarity, mammalian NAGS and X.
campestris NAGS-K have similar biochemical properties.
The affinities for AcCoA and glutamate are similar, as is
the concentration of arginine needed for half-inhibition
or activation of the synthase activity of XcNAGS-K and
mammalian NAGS, respectively [24]. The kinase activity
of the XcNAGS-K was also inhibited by arginine. However, NAG phosphorylation was approximately 25 times
less sensitive to arginine than NAG synthesis activity. This
difference in sensitivity to arginine could be due in part
because the synthase and kinase activities are assayed separately, while in vivo, both activities would be inhibited
concurrently since the biosynthesis of NAGP would stop
as soon as the kinase is deprived of its substrate NAG.
Functional domains of NAGS-K
NAGS-K from Xanthomonadales is composed of two
functional domains: the N-terminal kinase domain that
belongs to the COG0548 conserved domain family and
spans approximately 265 amino acids, and the DUF619
domain in the C-termini, which is approximately 160
amino acids long (Figure 7). This domain organization is
found in other bacterial NAGS, vertebrate NAGS and fungal NAGK [8,10]. NAGK from archaea, plants and most
bacteria are approximately 265 amino acids long and
have only one COG0548 conserved domain (Figure 7).
Examination of the domain relationships in the conserved
domain database revealed that DUF619 is related to the
COG1246 acetyltransferase domain family that is found
in the C-termini of bacterial and plant NAGS proteins. The
COG1246 conserved domain is also present in NAGS
from M. tuberculosis, which is 174 amino acids long [11],
and the arg(A) segment of the argH(A) gene from the two
Moritella species [8,9], suggesting that a functional glutamate N-acetyltransferase could be fully contained within
the 156 amino acids at the C-terminus of XcNAGS-K.
Examination of the domain relationships in the conserved
domain database revealed that DUF619 and COG1246

conserved domains are also related to the domain
pfam00583 of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases
(GNAT) superfamily, which is present in the putative argA
gene in the arginine operon of X. campestris. This suggests
that there may be two distinct active sites in the XcNAGSK: one in the C-terminal domain that carries out the
acetyltransferase function (synthase) and one in the N-terminal kinase domain, which is responsible for phosphorylation of NAG. Figure 7 shows that NAGS from fungi also
have two domains: the C-terminal acetyltransferase
domain that belongs to the DUF619 family and the N-terminal domain whose sequence appears to have diverged
from the kinase domain present in other two-domain
NAGS and fungal NAGK [8,12,33]. However, our phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2) and sequence alignment (Figure 3B) strongly suggests that fungal NAGS is related to
vertebrate NAGS and fungal NAGK. It is likely that divergence of fungal NAGS sequences reflects possible proteinprotein interactions [12,33] or other adaptations unique
to fungi. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of the XcNAGS-K and a more detailed examination of
its kinetic properties should reveal the identities and location of active site residues and lead to better understanding of how the acetyltransferase and kinase domains
interact.

teobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria and three species of
alpha-proteobacteria [48-50]. The three alpha-proteobacteria, M. maris, O. alexandrii and P. bermudensis, also
appear to harbor acetylornithine transcarbamylase (argF')
genes suggesting that their arginine biosynthesis pathway
is similar to the one in X. campestris [7]. Identification of
the alpha-proteobacterial NAGS genes that are closely
related to the corresponding vertebrate, fungal and algal
genes and to fungal NAGK is intriguing because mitochondria are thought to have arisen by endosymbiosis
between proto-eukaryotic cell and an alpha-proteobacteria. Current thought suggests that the alpha-proteobacteria of the order Rickettsiales are the extant relatives of the
endosymbiont that gave rise to mitochondria, and these
do not appear to have a bifunctional NAGS-K. M. maris
and O. alexandrii belong to the order of Rhodobacterales
and P. bermudensis is a member of the order Parvuralculares. Detailed analysis of the relationships among the
alpha proteobacteria orders with respect to NAGS will be
needed to better illuminate if the ancestry of the vertebrate
NAGS has origins in the alpha proteobacteria. It is likely
that, as more genomic data and candidate NAGS
sequences become available, it will be possible to reconstruct the evolutionary history of NAGS in a way similar to
that done for CPS, OTC and arginase [29-31].

Evolution of NAGS
We examined the distribution of NAGS and NAGK across
the three domains of life. Although NAGK is found in
archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes, such as plants, algae
and fungi, initially, we were only able to find sequences
similar to either E. coli or mammalian NAGS in beta-pro-

Based on the close relationship between XcNAGS-K, other
xanthomonad homologs, vertebrate NAGS and fungal
NAGK, it is likely that XcNAGS-K and its homologs are
extant representatives of an ancestral gene that arose by
fusion of the ancestral argB gene encoding NAGK, and an
ancestral gene encoding an acetyltransferase [8,10]. We

speculate that the primordial bifunctional protein underwent gene duplication followed by divergence to evolve
into the present day mammalian NAGS and fungal
NAGK. The present day mammalian NAGS retained
acetyltransferase enzymatic activity and lost the kinase
activity whereas the present day fungal NAGK retained
kinase activity and lost acetyltransferase activity. XcNAGSK retains conservation of amino acids important for both
activities (Figure 3B). The evolutionary descendant of the
unfused form of the acetyltransferase, if it still exists,
remains to be identified.
Many archaea and eubacteria, including X. campestris
[GenBank:AAM41523] and M. tuberculosis [GenBank:NP_217263], contain genes that are between 150
and 210 amino acids long and are annotated as argA or
NAGS. Moreover, the argA gene product of M. tuberculosis
appears to have NAGS enzymatic activity [11], suggesting
that the C-terminal domain of XcNAGS-K alone could be
sufficient for catalysis of NAG formation. NAGS function
is also contained within a 173 amino acids long arg(A)
segment of the argH(A) fusion gene found in the Moritella
abyssi and Moritella profunda [9,51]. All these "short" argA
gene products belong to the COG1246 family of acetyltransferases that are distinct from the DUF619 family (Figure 7). Based on the above observation and the

relationship between COG1246 and DUF619 protein
families, we cannot exclude the possibility of two separate
gene fusions occurred and gave rise to two families of
NAGS proteins: one fusion of NAGK and acetyltransferase
from the DUF619 family could have given rise to the Xanthomonad NAGS-K, NAGS from the alpha-proteobacteria
M. maris, O. alexandrii and P. bermudensis, vertebrate
NAGS, and fungal NAGS and NAGK, and a second fusion
between NAGK and an acetyltransferase from the
COG1246 family might have resulted in the extant plant,
beta- and gamma-proteobacterial NAGS. However, data
presented in Figure 2 could also be explained by horizontal gene transfer of NAGS-K from eukaryotes into Xanthomonadales, Rhodobacterales and/or Parvuralculares.
Sequencing and analysis of additional microbial genomes
will help to resolve which one of these evolutionary models is more likely.
The high level of divergence of NAGS compared to other
genes in the arginine biosynthesis pathway could be
explained by the dual role of NAGS among species
(arginine biosynthesis vs. ureagenesis). In organisms with
the linear arginine biosynthesis pathway and those harboring a urea cycle, NAGS plays an essential role of either
catalyzing the formation of the first intermediate in the
arginine biosynthesis or as a cofactor for the CPSI and

CPSIII [2]. This would imply stronger selection pressure
for conservation of amino acid sequence and protein
function. We speculate that in microbes and plants that
have the cyclical arginine biosynthesis pathway, NAGS
plays an anaplerotic role and could therefore be subject to
less stringent selection pressure, as long as NAG could be
regenerated by transacetylation from other precursors.
We had initially expected that amino acids involved in
binding of substrates would be conserved in all NAGS
proteins, regardless of their biological role. An AcCoA
binding motif (QXXGXG) in XcNAGS-K was identified

based on its similarity with thialysine acetyltransferase
(SSAT2), a member of the COG1246 family with known
three-dimensional structure [45]. In SSAT2, binding of
AcCoA is mediated mostly through hydrogen bonds with
the main-chain oxygen and nitrogen atoms instead of by
specific amino acid side chains [45]. Presumably the exact
identity of these residues is less important as long as their
side chains permit packing into the three-dimensional
structure of either the COG1246 or DUF619 domains.
This indirect form of amino acid interaction with substrates by the backbone instead of the side chains may

as well as genotype/phenotype correlations of NAGS deficiency.

Conclusion
Based on the phylogenetic relationship and similar biochemical properties of XcNAGS-K and mammalian
NAGS, we conclude that this bifunctional enzyme is
closely related to the bacterial antecedent of mammalian
NAGS.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis
The GenBank database was queried with protein
sequences of either human NAGS (hNAGS) or argA
(NAGS) gene from E. coli. Truncated NAGS sequences and
most of the putative NAGS genes were excluded from further analysis. Sequences of NAGS proteins from 28 species
and four fungal NAGK proteins, listed in Additional file 2,
were included in the phylogenetic analysis. These
sequences were aligned using ClustalW alignment software with a Gonnet similarity matrix [53,54]. Conserved
domains of vertebrate NAGS [24,34] were included in the
alignment and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. Putative
chloroplast and mitochondrial targeting signals were
removed from plant and fungal NAGS sequences. To minimize gaps in the sequence alignment, additional blocks
of amino acids from plant and fungal NAGS corresponding to extended loops were excluded from phylogenetic
analysis based on their alignment with the T. maritima
NAGK three-dimensional structure [41,42]. Blocks of
amino acids that were excluded from the phylogenetic
analysis are listed in the Additional file 2.

The PHYLIP 3.6 software package [55] was used for building phylogenetic trees. The protein distance matrix, based
on either the Jones-Taylor-Thornton or PMB model of
amino acid substitution [39,40], was calculated using the
Protdist module. The neighbor module of the PHYLIP
package was used to generate phylogenetic trees by the
neighbor joining method. The Protpars module of the
PHYLIP package was used to generate phylogenetic trees
using the parsimony method. Bootstrap analysis was carried out with 1000 replicas for neighbor joining and parsimony trees.
Identification and cloning of the X. campestris argA-B
gene
The X. campestris argA-B gene was identified based on its
similarity with mammalian NAGS. GenBank was queried
with the human NAGS protein, and sequences annotated
as argB from X. campestris, X. axonopodis and X. fastidiosa
had slightly lower BLAST expectation scores than vertebrate NAGS genes. The argB gene from X. campestris was
PCR amplified using genomic DNA (ATCC, catalog#

and BamHI restriction sites shown in bold. The PCR product was cloned into a PCR®-Blunt II-TOPO® plasmid using
the Zero Blunt® TOPO® PCR cloning Kit (Invitrogen). The
identity of 1345 bp insert was verified by DNA sequencing. This insert then was subcloned into a plasmid pET15b
(Novagen) which allows overexpression of the recombinant protein (XcNAGS-K) with the N-terminal polyhistidine affinity tag and removal of the tag using thrombin
protease. The resulting plasmid was termed
pET15bXcNAGS-K.
Overexpression and purification of XcNAGS-K
The pET15bXcNAGS-K plasmid was transformed into
BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. Transformed cells were grown at
37°C and the overexpression of XcNAGS-K was induced
with 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside at
mid-log phase. Cells were harvested the following day by
centrifugation at 3000 g for 15 min. at 4°C. The cell pellet
was resuspended in Buffer A: 50 mM sodium phosphate
pH 7.4 containing 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 10
mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME). Cells were disrupted by
sonication for 10 min. on ice; the cell debris was removed
by centrifugation at 15,000 g twice for 10 min. at 4°C.
Nucleic acids were digested with RNaseA and DNaseI at 8
μg/ml each in lysates containing 5 mM MgCl2 for 30 min.
at room temperature. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 g twice for 20 min. and 30 min. respectively.

Cleared lysate was loaded onto a HisTrap™HP Ni-affinity
column (Amersham Biosciences) and pre-equilibrated
with Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A containing 50 mM imidazole followed by elution of the
bound XcNAGS-K with Buffer A containing 200 mM imidazole. Purified XcNAGS-K was dialyzed into 20 mM TrisHCl buffer pH 7.4 containing 100 mM NaCl. The purified
protein was stable in this buffer for two weeks at 4°C.
The N-terminal polyhistidine tag was removed from
XcNAGS-K with thrombin protease. Thrombin was added
to the purified protein at 1 U per 10 mg of XcNAGS-K, and
the digestion was carried out for 24 hours at 4°C. The
XcNAGS-K and thrombin were separated using Superdex
200™HR 10/30 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH
7.4, containing 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM BME. The
XcNAGS-K without polyhistidine affinity tag is stable in
this buffer for two weeks.
Enzyme assays
Initial measurements of the synthase and kinase activities
of XcNAGS-K were carried out as described previously

[47,56]. In subsequent enzyme assays these methods were
modified as follows. The synthase activity of XcNAGS-K
was assayed in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, 100 mM
NaCl, 50 mM L-glutamate and 2 mM AcCoA in a total
reaction volume of 100 μl. The assay was carried out for 5
min. at 30°C with 0.5 μg of enzyme in each reaction. The
reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 30% TCA. NAG concentration was measured using liquid chromatographymass spectroscopy (LC-MS) as described previously [32].
The Kmapp and Vmax for glutamate and AcCoA were measured by varying glutamate concentration from 0 to 50 mM
while keeping AcCoA at 2 mM and varying AcCoA concentration from 0 to 4 mM while keeping glutamate at 50
mM. The values of Kmapp and Vmax were calculated using
non-linear fitting to the Hill and Michaelis-Menten equations using the Gnuplot software package [57]. Where
indicated, L-glutamate was replaced with 50 mM D-glutamate, L-glutamine or L-aspartate. The amounts of acetylD-glutamate, acetyl-L-glutamine or acetyl-L-aspartate
formed were measured using LC-MS method, described
above, with pure chemicals as standards. Inhibition of
synthase activity was examined in the absence and the
presence of 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mM Larginine

and 200 mM NaCl to enzymatic reaction carried out in
MES buffer.
The kinase activity was proportional to the concentration
of purified XcNAGS-K and the rate of NAGP formation
was linear with respect to time up to 20 min. The plots of
dependence of the NAGP formation, with respect
XcNAGS-K concentration and time, are provided in the

The NAG kinase activity of XcNAGS-K was measured
using colorimetric assay, described previously [47], with
some modifications. The enzymatic activity of 1.5 μg of
XcNAGS-K was measured in 100 μl of 100 mM MES
buffer, pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM NAG, 20 mM ATP,
40 mM MgCl2 and 400 mM hydroxylamine. The reaction
mixture was incubated at 30°C for 20 min. and the reaction was terminated with 100 μl of ferric chloride solution
(5% FeCl3, 8% TCA and 0.3 M HCl). Absorbance of the
colored product was measured at 540 nm. Where indicated, ATP was replaced with 20 mM CTP and UTP. Inhibition of the kinase activity was examined in the absence
and presence of 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 10, 20 and 30
mM L-arginine.
The effect of pH on the synthase and kinase activities of
XcNAGS-K was examined in a series of buffers: 100 mM
acetate buffer (pH 4.5 and 5), 100 mM MES buffer (pH
5.5 and 6), 100 mM MOPS buffer (pH 6.5 and 7) and 100
mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9 and 10). All buffers
contained 100 mM NaCl. Substrate concentrations were
50 mM glutamate and 2 mM AcCoA in assays of synthase
activity, and 100 mM NAG and 20 mM ATP in the kinase
assays. The effects of different buffer components and
ionic strength on the synthase activity of XcNAGS-K were
examined by adding 100 mM MOPS, 100 mM acetate,
100 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl and 200 mM NaCl to enzymatic reaction carried out in Tris-HCl buffer. The effects of
buffer components and ionic strength on the kinase activity of XcNAGS-K were examined by adding 100 mM
