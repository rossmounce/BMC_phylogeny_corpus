Abstract
Background: Bidirectional promoters are shared regulatory regions that influence the expression of two
oppositely oriented genes. This type of regulatory architecture is found more frequently than expected by
chance in the human genome, yet many specifics underlying the regulatory design are unknown. Given that
the function of most orthologous genes is similar across species, we hypothesized that the architecture
and regulation of bidirectional promoters might also be similar across species, representing a core
regulatory structure and enabling annotation of these regions in additional mammalian genomes.
Results: By mapping the intergenic distances of genes in human, chimpanzee, bovine, murine, and rat, we
show an enrichment for pairs of genes equal to or less than 1,000 bp between their adjacent 5' ends ("headto-head") compared to pairs of genes that fall in the same orientation ("head-to-tail") or whose 3' ends are
side-by-side ("tail-to-tail"). A representative set of 1,369 human bidirectional promoters was mapped to
orthologous sequences in other mammals. We confirmed predictions for 5' UTRs in nine of ten manual
picks in bovine based on comparison to the orthologous human promoter set and in six of seven
predictions in human based on comparison to the bovine dataset. The two predictions that did not have
orthology as bidirectional promoters in the other species resulted from unique events that initiated
transcription in the opposite direction in only those species. We found evidence supporting the
independent emergence of bidirectional promoters from the family of five RecQ helicase genes, which
gained their bidirectional promoters and partner genes independently rather than through a duplication
process. Furthermore, by expanding our comparisons from pairwise to multispecies analyses we
developed a map representing a core set of bidirectional promoters in mammals.
Conclusion: We show that the orthologous positions of bidirectional promoters provide a reliable guide
to directly annotate over one thousand regulatory regions in sequences of mammalian genomes, while also
serving as a useful tool to predict 5' UTR positions and identify genes that are novel to a single species.

Background
The completed sequence of numerous vertebrate genomes
has enabled rapid gene annotation across species using
orthologous relationships. This approach is feasible
because purifying selection, acting on the open reading
frames of coding exons and aimed at preserving encoded
protein sequences, minimizes the sequence divergence
that can occur. The sequences of these protein-coding
genes generally change more slowly over millions of years
than do non-coding sequences. Similarity at the nucleotide level is reflected in the likeness of structure and function of the gene products produced in different species.
Additional features, such as non-coding functional elements, are also maintained as conserved sequences across
species through the action of purifying selection [1].
Enhancer elements are often predicted from their distinctive sequence conservation. Other functional classes, such
as promoters, contain more plasticity in their composition and do not lend themselves to identification in this
manner. Given that precise computational methods are
not yet developed for predicting promoter regions in
newly assembled genomes, their annotation lags behind
that of coding genes and enhancers.
We hypothesized that promoter regions could be reliably
mapped across species using a unique class of promoter
that is flanked by genes on each side. These promoters,
known as bidirectional promoters, would be useful for
annotating promoter regions across mammals because
the genes on both the left and right sides of the promoter
change slowly. Thus, the promoter region is maintained as
a recognizable, intergenic, architectural region that is
amenable to computational discovery. Furthermore, if no
repetitive elements were inserted at the bidirectional promoter region in either species, the intergenic distances
should be maintained across species. To lend support to
this hypothesis, Takai and Jones (2004) [2] showed the
exclusion of repetitive elements from bidirectional promoters of human chromosomes 20, 21, and 22.
Bidirectional promoters were originally defined as the regulatory regions present in the intergenic space of two
oppositely oriented genes whose transcription start sites
(TSSs) were separated by no more than 1,000 bp [3]. Such
genes appear in a head-to-head arrangement, i.e. facing
away from one another, and are transcribed from opposite strands of DNA. The closely spaced arrangement of
the TSSs flanking the bidirectional promoter was recognized as a non-random event, proven by the fact that a
greater-than-expected number of genes had this architecture [2]. Up to 10% of human protein-coding genes were
initially identified with bidirectional promoters. We subsequently identified thousands of additional, putative,
bidirectional promoters by analyzing divergently transcribed, spliced EST data [4]. The methodology of map-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/189

ping bidirectional promoters across species used here
treats the genes on each side of a promoter as anchors that
delimit the intergenic, orthologous regulatory region. If
the genome of the other species contains conserved gene
order and orientation at the orthologous location, then
the intergenic promoter region must have evolved from
the ancestral sequence at that location. If the intergenic
distance of the annotated transcripts in the other species
is also maintained as ≤ 1,000 bp, the orthologous bidirectional promoter is declared validated. Of added benefit,
this method is not dependent on the level of nucleotide
sequence conservation in the promoter regions, which
can vary extensively [5].
The enrichment of bidirectional promoters in the human
genome evokes questions about their evolution. In some
cases, chromosomal rearrangements could have conjoined promoter regions of two genes. Those genes would
remain united through all subsequent speciation events
due to selective pressure against change. Any breakage of
the union (within or near the bidirectional promoter)
could disrupt the normal regulation of both genes, potentially having profound (disadvantageous) effects on cellular function. If true, bidirectional promoters should
provide an evolutionary timestamp of rearrangement
events across mammalian genomes. Alternatively, some
unidirectional promoters could have lost control of their
regulated transcription, enabling RNA polymerase to load
and traverse in the opposite direction [6]. This scenario
could serve as a mechanism for generating new genes in
the genome, which would occur in a rare and species-specific manner.
Building on our previous computational infrastructure,
we utilize updated human genome annotations to compare bidirectional promoters in human and bovine
genomes to test the hypothesis that long-term evolutionary histories of these promoters could be identified and
used to annotate the bovine genome. We used these data
to create a detailed regulatory map of orthologous promoter regions across 5 placental mammals (human,
chimp, cow, mouse and rat). As an outcome of the analysis, we have shown that the "locked" arrangement of genes
around these promoters enables prediction of unannotated 5' UTRs using cross-species comparisons. Furthermore, we identified bidirectional promoters that lack
orthologous counterparts in all other species, supporting
the conclusion that species-specific genes can be identified from rigorous, cross-species comparisons of this dataset. One human-specific example was from the family of
five RecQ helicase paralogs (WRN, BLM, RECQL,
RECQL4, and RECQL5), all of which have bidirectional
promoters that developed independently.

Results
Mapping bidirectional promoters in the cow genome
Bidirectional promoters were predicted in the cow
genome from in silico analyses of gene order, orientation
and intergenic distances, analogous to our studies in the
human and mouse genomes [4,7]. The official bovine
gene set (OGS v1, available at the Bovine Genome Database; [8]) contained 4,948 bidirectional gene pairs. Those
predictions were made without the normal requirement
for an intergenic distance of ≤ 1,000 bp due to incomplete
annotation of 5' UTRs in the cow genome. Thus, we
labeled the data as "low-stringency" predictions. In comparison, our previous studies in the human and mouse
genomes identified 5,000–6,000 bidirectional promoters
whose intergenic distances were limited to 1,000 bp (i.e.,
"high stringency") [4,9], suggesting that the number of
bidirectional promoters possible in the cow genome was
as high as 6,000. We concluded that our low stringency
bovine set captured a majority of actual bidirectional promoters, but that limited annotations contributed false
positive and false negative predictions.

To further assess the bidirectional promoters in the cow
genome, we examined additional transcript evidence. The
OGS v1 dataset, which lacked information regarding most
5' UTRs of bovine genes, was supplemented with RefSeq
annotations from GenBank and spliced EST data from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/189

UCSC Cow Genome Browser. Together these datasets
identified 1,574 bovine bidirectional promoters, all of
which met the requirement of no more than 1,000 bp separating any pair of TSSs (Supplemental Figure S13 in
[10]).
We hypothesized that bidirectional promoters form a core
regulatory structure in all mammalian genomes. To assess
this hypothesis quantitatively, the intergenic distances for
all promoters having a "head-to-head" configuration were
examined in the human, chimp, cow, mouse, and rat
genomes (Fig. 1). For comparison, we examined "head-totail" genes that are arranged in a parallel orientation and
"tail-to-tail" genes whose 3' ends are adjacent. These data
showed a significant enrichment for the head-to-head
arrangement within 1,000 bp compared to the same distance in the other datasets (p-value < 2.2e-12 in the
human dataset and p < 1.3e-3 in all datasets, respectively,
for the χ2 test).
Human bidirectional promoters have orthologs in cow
To address a core set of orthologous bidirectional promoters in mammals, we mapped positions of the regulatory
regions in the human and cow genomes. We noted that
less than 25% (1,369) of the human bidirectional promoters controlled expression of genes that encode proteins. The remainder regulated combinations of protein-

the other categories at a distance of 1,000 bp or less, using a Chi-square test of independence.

coding genes with RNA gene partners or pairs of RNA
genes. We proceeded by mapping only these 1,369
human promoters from the protein coding set, because of
the limited annotations of RNA genes available in most
mammalian species.
When compared between human and cow, 94% of the
regions mapped to an orthologous position at one or both
of the genes flanking each promoter. Moreover, the intergenic distances of orthologous bidirectional promoters
were found to be similar for the majority of gene pairs
(Fig. 2). Nevertheless, despite the presence of orthology,
some intergenic distances in cow were much larger than
the allowable 1,000 bp, providing an opportunity to
assess if the differences represented biological diversity or
technical anomalies.
Individual gene pairs were examined for transcript evidence at the orthologous locations in cow. Those transcripts were required to uphold the 1,000 bp intergenic
distance rule to validate the location as an orthologous
bidirectional promoter. RefSeq annotations in cow provided validation for 20% of the 1,369 human promoters
(Fig. 3). An additional 7% of the cross-species predictions
were validated from the OGS v1 annotations. Supplementing this comparison, the spliced EST annotations
from cow confirmed another 5% of the orthologous pro-

moter predictions. In total, 479 human promoters were
validated in cow through a combined assessment of
orthology and transcript annotations. An additional 487
human bidirectional promoters were supported at orthologous locations by the low-stringency predictions in the
cow genome. These data confirmed that conserved synteny was maintained at regions orthologous to human
bidirectional promoters; however, validation of those
regions as true bidirectional promoters was hindered by
the possibility of missing data at the 5' ends of genes in
cow. Of the remaining comparisons, the majority were
present at orthologous locations, but lacked an annotation for one of the two genes in the pair (200 regions; Fig.
3, dark blue bars) or for both genes (121; medium blue
bars). Only 6% of the gene pairs had no record of orthology in the cow genome (82; light blue bars).
Cross-species UTR prediction
Missing UTR information in the bovine genome could be
addressed using complementary evidence from multiple
gene annotations. Over half of the bidirectional promoters predicted using cow OGS v1 annotations were the low
stringency type, with an intergenic distance greater than
1,000 bp. Comparison to the high-stringency EST data
identified 5'UTRs for the genes in this data that brought
neighboring TSSs closer together. These UTRs were
located at genomic distances of up to 100,000 bp
upstream of the characterized OGS v1 coding exons. In a
pilot experiment, we addressed the large intergenic distances found in cow relative to human by examining ten
gene-pairs that had extremely large intergenic distances in
cow. The genes from each pair were spaced greater than 50
kb apart at their 5' ends, compared to a 1 kb intergenic distance in human (as seen in Fig. 2, see also Table 1). All ten
of the gene pairs were re-annotated to update their 5'
UTRs (Otterlace annotation pipeline, [11]) and nine of
ten were subsequently validated as bidirectional promoters in the cow genome. Following the addition of the UTR
annotations, a comparison of the cow and human genes
showed uniformly long first introns, averaging 88,844 bp.
These long distances contrasted sharply with the short distances being maintained between the TSSs of each set of
genes. Thus, manual curation performed for 10 cow genes
confirmed that unannotated 5' UTRs accounted for the
failure of 9 of those regions to be validated as orthologous
promoters in cow in our original comparison. Similar evidence for missing data at the 5' UTRs was found in an
analysis of the full dataset (Additional file 1). For example, human promoters were mapped to the cow genome
and validated using cumulative evidence from each of the
cow gene sets. Given that the reference gene annotations
are maintained as separate resources, we found they contain complementary as well as unique information that
supported our claims. The OGS v1 data, which has a minimal number of 5' UTR annotations, gained UTRs from

Cumulative validation of bidirectional promoters in the cow genome
Cumulative validation of bidirectional promoters in the cow genome. A set of confirmed bidirectional promoters
from the human RefSeq annotations (Hg18 assembly) was mapped to orthologous positions in the cow genome. If the cow
transcript data independently identified a bidirectional promoter at that same location (with ≤ 1,000 bp intergenic distance)
these predictions were considered validated (purple bars). Otherwise the predictions were classified as low stringency (i.e., >
1,000 bp). The validation data are additive, accumulating information from the top to bottom of the image (i.e., from RefSeq,
high stringency data to EST, high stringency data, respectively). Dark blue and and medium blue bars designate promoters that
lack annotation for one or both of the two genes in the pair, respectively. Light blue bars designate gene pairs lacking an
ortholog of either gene in the pair.
RefSeq or EST data. Despite our best efforts, a large
number (604) of OGS v1 gene predictions failed to be validated in bidirectional promoters because the EST or RefSeq datasets lacked entries for those genes, confirming
that the bovine transcriptome data is incomplete.
A reciprocal examination of orthology at bidirectional
promoters mapped cow bidirectional promoters to the
human genome. Ninety percent of bidirectional promoters in cow mapped to the human genome at orthologous
locations. A small number contained an intergenic distance that was too large to be called a bidirectional pro-

moter in the human gene pair. Six of these regions were
chosen for manual curation. Five of the six were confirmed as bidirectional promoters upon re-evaluation of
the available transcript information (using the Otterlace
annotation pipeline [11]) (Table 2). The new annotations
were recorded in the 2008 Vega human gene annotations
[12].

was found when the bidirectional promoter for cow
CYB5R4 (cytochrome b5 reductase 4, this represents an
alternative promoter of CYB5R4. Through alternative
splicing, the first exon is also used for a different gene,
RIPPLEY2). did not validate in human. The human region
contained the ortholog for CYB5R4, but not the partner
gene from cow (GenBank Accession DV834581). This
partner was expressed in numerous cow expression libraries from the brain (Bovine Genome Sequencing Program:
Full-length cDNA Sequencing, unpublished) and
although it had a minimal open reading frame, it showed
strong evidence for RNA secondary structure (Supplemental Fig. S15 in [10]). The unique appearance of the transcript in cow was explained by a 43 Mb chromosomal
inversion on cow chromosome 9 ([10], Supplemental Fig.

S14 in [10]). The transcript DV834581 crossed this rearrangement breakpoint. None of the other sequenced
mammalian genomes showed evidence of the 43 Mb
inversion. A duplicated MIR3 SINE was found flanking
the inversion on both sides, with one copy being embedded within exon 3 of the DV834581 transcript. Although
the repetitive element was implicated in the inversion, no
clear model explained its role mechanistically. Conserved
synteny between the human, macaque, chimp, mouse,
rat, dog, and pig genomes indicated that no other
genomes could reconstitute this transcript because it
spanned the unique chromosomal junction. Therefore,
the transcript DV834581 was identified as a bovine-specific transcript being transcribed from a bidirectional promoter that was not bidirectional in any other species.

Parallel evolution of bidirectional promoters regulating
RecQ helicases
The presence of the unique bidirectional promoter in cow
suggested that novel transcripts could be identified in any
mammalian genome using our comparative approach.
We therefore examined the human genome for evidence
of novel RNA transcripts regulated by bidirectional promoters that were not predicted in other species. We found
that the bidirectional promoter of the Bloom Syndrome
gene (BLM) regulated a candidate human-specific transcript. With limited coding potential, reliable expression
evidence, and strong secondary structure (Fig. 4) this transcript (e.g., GenBank Accession BG472948) was generated
from a chromosomal region that aligns at the nucleotide
level in several mammals, from human to opossum, suggesting an evolutionary history of at least 170 million
years [13]. However, evidence for transcription from this
site was limited to human. Exons of this transcript exhibited sequence identity between human and chimp, but
not in more distant primate genomes. Furthermore, no
compensatory mutations were present in the exonic
regions of more distant primate sequences, which would
have indicated that an RNA gene was functional and
under selection in those species. A variant containing a
small open reading frame under purifying selection in
human and chimp (as evidenced by the excess of synonymous nucleotide changes compared to nonsynonymous
changes, dS > dN) did not align to the marmoset genome
(i.e., Catarrhini-specific). We concluded that any coding
potential of the transcript was limited within Old World
monkeys, including human. These data indicated that the
BLM partner emerged from an existing promoter in a
genomic region that has been stable since the time that
marsupials split with the ancestor of modern humans yet

has only recently become transcriptionally active in the
opposite direction (possibly in the last 5–10 million
years).
In addition to BLM, four other RecQ paralogs exist in the
human genome and all were found to have bidirectional
promoters. A phylogenetic tree of the five RecQ family
members supported their early duplication from an ancestral gene early in metazoan evolution [14] without any
gene conversion events that would complicate the evolutionary assessment (Fig. 5). We questioned whether bidirectional promoters had emerged at these sites in a
parallel manner, or if the original gene pair duplicated
into a series of paralogous gene-pairs that carried along
their promoters as part of the duplication event (Fig. 6).
To investigate the relationships of the RecQ gene
homologs and their partners, the evolutionary distances
between human and cow orthologs were computed as dS
and dN values (the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, respectively). For each RecQ gene the rate of
synonymous substitutions exceeded that of nonsynonymous substitutions, confirming that purifying selection
maintained their respective amino acid sequences (Fig. 7
and Table 3). Divergence at the amino acid level (estimated as Dayhoff distance) was equivalent to that of most
protein coding genes in the human genome.
In contrast to the relatively high similarity among paralogous RecQ family members, the partners of those genes
showed no similarity with one another within the same
genomes. Notably, the rate of synonymous substitutions
substantially exceeded the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions for all of these orthologous gene pairs (in humancow comparisons), indicating that purifying selection also
maintained these partner sequences (Fig. 7 and Table 4).
These results precluded a role for positive selection (i.e.,
when a duplication was followed by accelerated sequence
divergence) as the explanation for all 5 paralogs having
bidirectional promoters with unrelated partner genes.
Thus, we concluded that each of these bidirectional promoters developed independently, with the BLM promoter
being the youngest example. Subsequent and ongoing
analyses are aimed at identifying the components that
could have caused this event. Thus far, no significant
sequence alignments have been found between the promoters of the RecQ genes using blastz alignments.
Comparative Vertebrate Analyses
To further address the level of conservation expected at
these promoter regions, we examined PhyloP scores [15],
which provide a measure of sequence constraint or accelerated change compared to a neutral background model.
Multi-species alignments generated from 44 vertebrates
were the source for the PhyloP scores (available at the

UCSC Human Genome Browser). Coding sequences,
which carry a strong signature of sequence conservation,
had the highest scores of any dataset we examined. Bidirectional promoters (head-to-head) scored only slightly
higher than promoters in head-to-tail arrangements (Fig.
8). The level of conservation decreased further for tail-totail genes and ancestral repeats. Thus, bidirectional promoters are not maintained as highly conserved sequences
in mammalian genomes, despite their close positioning
between genes that are under negative (purifying) selec-

tion. Instead, these promoters tolerate sequence divergence, which is consistent with observations of promoters
in general [5]. We found that a core set of regulatory factors is significantly enriched in the orthologous promoter
set compared to the tail-to-tail regions (Additional file 2).
Our approach of mapping orthologous bidirectional promoters across species was expanded to produce a 5-species
map of validated bidirectional promoters (Fig. 9). The

Sequence conservation in bidirectional promoters
Sequence conservation in bidirectional promoters. The 44-way vertebrate phyloP scores are calculated in intergenic
regions collected from head-to-head, head-to-tail, or tail-to-tail gene arrangements. Coding regions and ancestral repeats serve
as control sets for comparison. These data are plotted as the percentage of bases having phyloP scores equal to or larger than
the phyloP score specified on the horizontal axis. Negative scores indicate accelerated change whereas positive scores indicate
sequence conservation.

Comparative mapping of bidirectional promoters across species at orthologous positions
Comparative mapping of bidirectional promoters across species at orthologous positions. The reference set of
bidirectional promoters is from 2,738 individual human protein coding genes (regulated by 1,369 bidirectional promoters).
These regions were mapped to the species shown on the right of the panel. The orthology assignments were validated using
ResSeq annotations in the non-human species, except for Cow_Comprehensive, which contained RefSeq, EST and OGS v1
annotations from cow. The heatmap is clustered keeping the vertical columns intact across all datasets to retain the relevance
to the reference position in human. The order of the reference human gene set is dependent on the outcome of the clustering
algorithm. The scale of the heat map is depicted as the number of human gene pairs used for predictions. Vertical bars representing each bidirectional promoter are colored purple when validated as orthologous in other species, royal blue when only
one of the two flanking genes is annotated in cow, light blue when neither gene is annotated in cow, or off-white when no
orthology is present for the human region.
human protein-coding genes was mapped to the other
genomes and validated using RefSeq annotations from
each of those genomes, keeping the 1,000 bp maximal
intergenic distance requirement. Nearly all regions
showed orthology at one or both of the genes, except 10%
of regions in chimp, 6% in cow, 5% in mouse and 8% in
rat, respectively. These locations represent complete
changes in genomic content between species. The remaining regions contained orthology but validated at relatively
low rates as illustrated by the magenta areas in the heat

map. Nevertheless, these promoters were validated across
species in numbers consistent with the gene annotations
available for each genome: 934 promoters in chimp, 828
in mouse and 494 in rat, respectively (using RefSeq annotations only). These data indicate that many 5' UTRs
remain to be annotated in mammalian genomes, moreover, some protein coding genes are absent from these gene
collections.

Discussion
Bidirectional promoter analyses contribute many benefits
to genomic annotations including predictions of unannotated genes and 5' UTRs in mammalian genomes. No
other methods exist to predict UTRs across species, and
conventional techniques to align ESTs from other species
perform poorly in the divergent UTR sequences. In addition to 5' UTR annotations, the conserved architecture of
bidirectional promoters enables annotation of orthologous promoters as well as identification of missing coding
annotations in other mammals. Our previous work
reported that similar intergenic distances were present at
orthologous positions of bidirectional promoters in pairwise comparisons between human and mouse or human
and chimp. Thus, the finding that the human and cow
comparison showed fewer bidirectional promoters in the
bovine genome was attributed to the early stage of the
bovine annotation effort, in which 5' UTRs of genes have
not been fully characterized. As the depth and coverage of
transcribed regions in the cow genome increase, both the
in-species annotations and cross-species validations of
bidirectional promoters will benefit. Consistent with this
idea, our analyses strongly advocate continued efforts
towards defining the 5' ends of genes, in order to expedite
the annotation of adjacent regions, which contain promoter sequences. The resulting information will enable
downstream analyses of conservation of regulatory networks that act through the same transcription factor binding sites. Despite the limitations imposed by the shallow
depth of transcripts available in the bovine genome, our
data provide strong evidence that bidirectional promoters
can be mapped across species using conservation of gene
synteny to rapidly annotate these functional regions in
non-human genomes. Furthermore, the benefit of mapping these promoters independently in other species is
that new bidirectional promoters can be reciprocally predicted and validated in the human genome. We were able
to use bidirectional promoters to identify chromosomal
rearrangements, which harbor species-specific transcripts
with robust evidence and biological intrigue. For example,
RecQ genes originated via duplication events that created
5 paralogs early in the evolution of metazoans, but their
bidirectional partners are unrelated to each other. Therefore, the emergence of bidirectional promoters in this
gene family was not a passive result of duplication of the
original gene pair bringing the promoter along with it.
This conclusion is apparent from the lack of similarity
among the partner genes. Moreover, dN/dS analyses show
that the partners are under strong purifying selection and
have not undergone accelerated change, which would
have masked their original similarities if they had been
paralogs. Any tendency towards rearrangement by these
genes is no longer apparent, as each gene partner has
remained stably associated with its RecQ paralog for more
than 80 million years. Retrotransposition could be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/189

another mechanism bringing RecQ genes near their partners or vice versa, but does not explain the BLM gene pairing. The partner of the BLM gene is unique to Catarrhini
and has only recently evolved, however, the underlying
genomic sequence is orthologous to opossum sequence,
precluding a recent introduction of the partner gene into
the region. Given these data, we hypothesize that elements in or near the RecQ promoters are responsible for
initiating transcription in the opposing direction. Recent
work by Core et al. 2008 [16] and Seila et al. 2008 [17]
demonstrates that promoters can load RNA Pol II in both
the forward and reverse directions to maintain a short
region of open chromatin. We propose that in some cases,
this phenomenon could provide a mechanism for generating novel, full-length transcripts that are spliced and
polyadenylated in a species-specific manner.

Conclusion
We have produced a record of orthologous bidirectional
promoters in 5 placental mammals (human, chimpanzee,
bovine, murine, and rat). Furthermore, we addressed the
evolution of new genes that can be identified by mapping
bidirectional promoters across species. Continued work
on the development of a cross-species regulatory map for
these promoters is likely to reveal additional information
about transcripts that are not only unique to individual
species, but also functionally relevant.

Methods
The bovine gene annotations from OGS v1 are available at
http://genomes.arc.georgetown.edu/bovine/
bovine_genome_consortium/datasets.html. All other
annotations were obtained from the UCSC Human
Genome Browser. PhlyoP scores were also obtained from
the Human UCSC Genome Browser.
A multi-stage approach to mapping orthology at bidirectional promoters was developed. For example, orthology
assignments are strongest in coding regions. Therefore, we
began by mapping single human genes regulated by bidirectional promoters from the Known Genes annotations
[18] of the UCSC human genome assembly hg18. Orthology assignments were determined using multiz alignment
information [19], the "chains and nets" data from the
UCSC Human Genome Browser mysql tables [20].
Chains in the Genome Browser represent sequences of
gapless aligned blocks. Nets provide a hierarchical ordering of those chains. Level 1 chains, which contain the
longest, best-scoring sequence chains that span any
selected region, were the only ones considered in this
analysis. Given a human gene, our approach examined
whether it fell within an orthologous region defined by
level 1 alignment data without knowledge of the exact
position within an alignment or relative to a gap. In a subsequent step, we intersected the positions of gaps and

exons of each gene to ensure that the exons fell into alignable positions across species.
After determining the orthology assignments using the
UCSC chains and nets data, we used the RefSeq, spliced
ESTs, or OGS v1 annotations from cow to validate predictions from the human dataset. RefSeq genes represent
mostly protein-coding genes and therefore were verified
by chains and nets alignments, followed by confirmation
of protein identity in both species. Spliced ESTs carried
less descriptive information than protein coding genes
and therefore were validated in the second species by their
presence in an orthologous region, showing conserved
synteny of the two genes within that gene-pair, and meeting the criteria of less than 1,000 bp of intergenic distance
between those transcripts. Our method for mapping bidirectional promoters in spliced EST datasets is described in
more detail in a previous publication [4]. If the program
verified evidence for orthology and conserved-syntenic
gene arrangement, then the orthologous bidirectional
promoter was confirmed. After orthologous assignments
were confirmed for pairs of human genes, the reciprocal
assignments were analyzed from cow to human, using a
similar process.
Heat maps were generated to represent the orthologous
positions of bidirectional promoters. The scale of the map
is designated by the number of human genes that were
evaluated in a linear distance on the map, due to the fine
gradation of the illustrated data. Circumstances in which
orthologous bidirectional promoters were not identified
included: (A) the presence of one flanking gene but not
both, (B) no annotations for either gene in the orthologous genomic region, or (C) no orthologous genomic
region was identified. Additional scenarios were possible,
but were not presented here. Bidirectional promoters that
were validated at the same orthologous position across
multiple species are presented as columns of purple color.
The heatmap is clustered by similar color groups, while
maintaining the column of information at each position.
The phylogenetic tree of protein sequences showing 5
members of the RecQ gene family from human and cow
was reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method
[21] based on the Dayhoff distance implemented in the
MEGA4 program [22]. The RMI1 sequences from human
and cow were used as an outgroup to root the tree. The
reliability of the internal branches was evaluated using
1,000 bootstrap replications [23]. The number of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions per
synonymous and nonsynonymous site, respectively, was
computed using Nei-Gojobori method [24].
