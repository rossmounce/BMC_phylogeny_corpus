Abstract
Background: Urochloa humidicola is a forage grass that grows in tropical regions and is recognized for its
tolerance to seasonal flooding. It is a polyploid and apomictic species with high phenotypic plasticity. As molecular
tools are important in facilitating the development of new cultivars and in the classification of related species, the
objectives of this study were to develop new polymorphic microsatellite markers from an enriched library
constructed from U. humidicola and to evaluate their transferability to other Urochloa species.
Findings: Microsatellite sequences were identified from a previously constructed enriched library, and specific
primers were designed for 40 loci. Isolated di-nucleotide repeat motifs were the most abundant followed by tetranucleotide repeats. Of the tested loci, 38 displayed polymorphism when screened across 34 polyploid Urochloa sp.
genotypes, including 20 accessions and six hybrids of U. humidicola and two accessions each from U. brizantha, U.
dictyoneura, U. decumbens and U. ruziziensis. The number of bands per Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) locus ranged
from one to 29 with a mean of 11.5 bands per locus. The mean Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) of all loci
was 0.7136, and the mean Discrimination Power (DP) was 0.7873. Six loci amplified in all species tested. STRUCTURE
analysis revealed six different allelic pools, and the genetic similarity values analyzed using Jaccard’s coefficient
ranged from 0.000 to 0.913.
Conclusions: This work reports new polymorphic microsatellite markers that will be useful for breeding programs
for Urochloa humidicola and other Urochloa species as well as for genetic map development, germplasm
characterization, evolutionary and taxonomic studies and marker-assisted trait selection.

Background
Urochloa humidicola (Rendle) Morrone & Zuloaga (syn.
Brachiaria humidicola (Rendle) Schweick..) [1] is an outcrossed and wind-pollinated perennial tropical grass that
is widely used for pasture in several tropical regions,
including Central and South America, Southeast Asia and
Oceania. Also known as koroniviagrass, it is particularly
recognized for its tolerance to poorly draining soils, seasonal flooding and infertile acid soils [2], characteristics that
led to the successful use of this species in the Amazon
region.
U. humidicola is a polyploid species that has ploidy
levels ranging from tetraploid to heptaploid. The basic

chromosome number has been recently reported as x =
6 [3-6]. This species reproduces through a Panicumtype of apospory [7], which is an asexual mode of reproduction through seeds where somatic cells of the nucellus form unreduced embryo sacs [8].
The difficulty in classifying Urochloa grasses is related to
subtle differences between species, which are distinguished
by slight differences in the small morphological features of
the flowers [1,9] and phenotypic plasticity. These subtle
differences make the identification of species and intraand interspecific hybrids problematic and uncertain. As little is known about the genetic makeup of U. humidicola,
molecular markers represent important tools for elucidating the classification and genetics of the species as well as
for applications in breeding programs. More particularly,
microsatellite markers are widely used in genetic studies,
and due to their high mutation rates [10], they can be

especially helpful when comparing closely related individuals [11].
The identification of microsatellite markers depends on
knowledge of the flanking region sequences to design
appropriate primer pairs. These sequences are usually
obtained from enriched libraries [12] or from public
sequences. The flanking regions have lower mutation rates
than the microsatellites themselves [11] and are often
identical among phylogenetically related species, allowing
the use of the same markers in these species [13-15].
In a previous study, 384 clones were sequenced and analyzed from a microsatellite-enriched library constructed
for Urochloa humidicola, and 27 polymorphic microsatellites loci were described [16]. The population structure of
the germplasm collection of U. humidicola was then analyzed using these loci along with morphological markers
[17]. To continue the genetic studies of this species, the
present study aimed to develop new microsatellite markers
for U. humidicola, test their transferability to other Urochloa species and validate the newly developed SSRs by
evaluating the genetic diversity and population structure
among 34 Urochloa genotypes (26 of U. humidicola and
two each of the following species: U. brizantha, U. decumbens, U. ruziziensis and U. dictyoneura). The results were
compared with previously reported data [17].

Unweighted Pair-Group Method with the Arithmetic
Mean (UPGMA) that successfully discriminated all tested
accessions (Figure 1).
The population structure inferred by a model-based Bayesian approach using the STRUCTURE software revealed
K = 6 clusters. Each cluster was characterized by a set of
allele frequencies at each locus and was represented by different colors (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta and light
blue) as indicated in Figure 2a. If genotypes indicate
admixture, they can be assigned to two or more clusters
[20]. We used the term “Cluster” to refer to one or more
individuals characterized by a distinguishable allelic set.
The best K number of clusters was determined using the
ΔK method [21], and its graphical representation is shown
in Figure 2b.
In the STRUCTURE analysis, Cluster I (CI-red) was
composed of eight genotypes, Cluster II (CII-green) was
composed of three genotypes, Cluster III (CIII-blue)
was composed of five genotypes, Cluster IV (CIV-yellow)
was composed of five genotypes, Cluster V (CV-magenta)
was composed of five genotypes and Cluster VI (CVI-light
blue) was composed of the last eight genotypes of the studied species. The estimated membership coefficients (Q)
of each individual for each allelic pool are shown in Additional File 2: Inferred ancestry of individuals.

Results
Forty primer pairs were designed and amplified successfully in U. humidicola, and 38 SSRs were polymorphic
(Table 1). Polymorphism Information Content (PIC)
values for each locus were obtained for the 26 U. humidicola genotypes as previously described [18]. Discrimination Power (DP) was also determined for each locus [19].
The mean PIC of all loci was 0.7136, and the mean DP
was 0.7873. Between one and 29 bands were observed per
locus with a mean of 11.5 bands per locus.
Transferability of the developed SSR primer pairs was
tested in two genotypes each of U. brizantha, U. decumbens, U. ruziziensis and U. dictyoneura for all the loci
under the same PCR conditions used for U. humidicola.
The number of successfully amplified genotypes per
number of genotypes tested per species is shown in
Table 2. The following loci did not amplify in any of the
tested genotypes of Urochloa spp: BhUNICAMP031,
BhUNICAMP032, BhUNICAMP042, BhUNICAMP051,
BhUNICAMP052, BhUNICAMP057, BhUNICAMP058,
BhUNICAMP063 and BhUNICAMP064. Twenty-one
loci were amplified in at least one U. brizantha genotype,
24 were amplified in U. decumbens, six were amplified in
U. ruziziensis, and 25 were amplified in U. dictyoneura.
The genetic similarity values analyzed using Jaccard’s
coefficient ranged from 0.000 (H125 and H126) to 0.913.
See Additional File 1: Genetic similarity based on Jaccard’s
coefficient. A dendrogram was constructed using the

Discussion
A robust set of informative molecular markers for the
species of interest is a prerequisite for marker-assisted
breeding. Urochloa humidicola (or koroniviagrass) is an
important tropical forage grass with limited genomic
resources. As microsatellite markers are highly polymorphic, reproducible and distributed throughout the
genome, they are the ideal marker system for genetic
analysis and breeding applications [22]. However, only
27 SSR markers have been reported for koroniviagrass
[16]. The present study reports a novel set of SSRs that
adds to the existing repertoire of molecular markers in
this species and validates the SSRs in some related
species.
The majority of the SSRs isolated in the present study
were comprised of di-nucleotide repeats (80%) followed
by tetra-nucleotide (15%) and penta-nucleotide (5%)
repeats. This distribution can be attributed to enrichment of the library for the two di-nucleotide repeats,
(AC)n and (AG)n.
Of all the microsatellites analyzed, 38 out of 40 (95%)
showed polymorphism. The most informative loci in this
panel of SSRs were the ones with the highest PIC and DP
values (BhUNICAMP037, BhUNICAMP039, BhUNICAMP046 and BhUNICAMP047). The BhUNICAMP051
and BhUNICAMP065 loci showed no polymorphism
among the studied genotypes, but they may be useful in
other studies. The BhUNICAMP030 locus resulted in

as expected because of its low observed polymorphism
and its amplification in all other species, which may be a
result of a conserved region among the Urochloa species
studied here.

Of the 40 investigated loci, 18 cross-amplified in at
least three other Urochloa species, and six cross-amplified in all the evaluated species. The highest success of
transferability was obtained in U. dictyoneura, where 25

genotype. These results were expected because the U.
dictyoneura species is more closely related to U. humidicola than to the other three species [9,23]. U. ruziziensis
was a scoreless species, as only six SSR primer pairs
could be cross-amplified. These results are consistent
with a previous study with different microsatellite loci
[16].
Genetic distance and population structure analysis based
on SSR allelic data showed differentiation among U. humidicola accessions, hybrids and other Urochloa species.
Although the number of genotypes is limited, the analyses
corroborate a previous study with 60 U. humidicola genotypes [17]. The STRUCTURE analysis showed that the
genotypes distributed into six major groups, and such
groupings were similarly observed by [17]. When examining the dendrogram based on Jaccard’s similarity coefficient, the distribution of genotypes was similar to the
STRUCTURE analysis, although the two analyses used different statistical approaches.
Indeed, as observed in the amplification profiles, the
dendrogram and the allelic pools indicated a closer relationship between U. humidicola and U. dictyoneura than
with the other species.
In the STRUCTURE analysis (Figure 2a), Clusters I-V
contained only U. humidicola genotypes, and accessions
from Clusters II, III and IV were grouped in the same way
as has been previously reported [17]. The allelic pools
were identified by different colors, and although a genotype might belong to a particular allelic pool, it can also
represent a percentage of other allelic pools, as observed
in genotypes H016, H31, H006, H013, H012, H044, H035,
H030, H004, DT159 and DT157.
Cluster I in the STRUCTURE analysis separated the
H016 and H031 accessions (Figure 2a), which were found
along with their six hybrids in the same cluster in a previous study [17]. The H031 and H016 accessions were the
parents of the first and single mapping population of the
species and were the originators of the hybrids used in this
study. It is also important to note that these genotypes
presented a high degree of divergence, corroborating previous results [17]. Mapping studies are currently underway
with the SSR loci reported in this and a previous study
[16].
When examining Cluster VI (Figure 2a), which was
formed by the other Urochloa species, a different allelic
pool was found (light blue), and the U. dictyoneura accessions (DT159 and DT157) showed some percentage of the
red and magenta allelic pools, corroborating what was
observed in the dendrogram. When analyzing the grouping pattern of the other Urochloa species, it is important
to note that only two genotypes of each species were used
in contrast to the 26 U. humidicola genotypes; this could
be biasing the analysis.

Page 7 of 10

As previously observed [17], the H031 accession,
which is the sole sexual accession in the germplasm collection, presented a different allelic pool composition.
However, when compared to other species, the present
study revealed that this accession might have the same
origin as the other species based on the high proportion
of the blue allelic pool in the genotype.

Conclusions
The data reported herein indicate that the newly developed SSR markers from U. humidicola represent a powerful set of genetic resources for genetic diversity studies
and are potentially useful for further studies, including
molecular mapping, species and hybrid identification, gene
flow and seed purity, in U. humidicola and other Urochloa
species.
Methods
Thirty-four Urochloa genotypes were used in this study.
Twenty are U. humidicola accessions maintained in the
germplasm collection of Embrapa Beef Cattle, six are
hybrids from the same species and the other eight are
represented by two different accessions from each of the
following species: U. brizantha, U. decumbens, U. ruziziensis and U. dictyoneura. The annotation numbers, accession
numbers (as recorded in Embrapa Beef Cattle (EBC) and
Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), genotypes and
species identifications are shown in Table 3. Freeze-dried
leaf samples were used for DNA extraction following the
cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method previously described [24].
In a previous study, a microsatellite-enriched library was
constructed for Urochloa humidicola, and 384 clones were
sequenced. The sequences were then treated as described
[16], and the microsatellites were identified using the Simple Sequence Repeat Identification Tool (SSRIT) [25].
Only di-nucleotides with five or more repeats, tri-nucleotides with four or more repeats, and tetra-, penta- and
hexanucleotides with three or more repeats were considered. Primer pairs were designed using the Primer Select
5.01 (DNASTAR Inc.) and Primer3Plus software [26].
Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were carried out as
previously described [16]. Amplification products were
resolved by electrophoresis in 3% agarose gels prior to
vertical electrophoresis in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide
gels; gels were then silver stained as previously described
[27]. Product sizes were determined by comparison to a
10-bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
The microsatellites were treated as dominant markers
due to the polyploid nature of the genotypes. Accordingly, data were scored based on the presence (1) or
absence (0) of a band for each of the Urochloa genotypes.
Both PIC and DP values were calculated to estimate the

polymorphism of each locus. PIC values were calculated
based on [18] and DP values based on [19]. PIC was used
as a tool to measure the information that a given marker
locus could provide for the pool of genotypes, whereas
DP was used as a quantification tool to measure the efficiency of a given marker for the discrimination of genotypes, i.e., the probability that two randomly chosen
individuals have different patterns.
The genetic similarity among all the genotypes was estimated according to Jaccard’s similarity coefficient [28]
based on a binary matrix constructed with the polymorphic bands. The corresponding genetic similarity
matrix was used to generate a dendrogram based on the
Unweighted Pair Group Method with the Arithmetic
Mean (UPGMA) algorithm as previously reported [29]. All
analyses were carried out using NTSYSpc 2.11X [30]. A
bootstrap analysis with 10,000 random samplings was
applied to estimate the reliability of the dendrogram
branches using BOOD version 3.0 [31].
A Bayesian clustering method was employed to assess
population structure using the STRUCTURE software version 2.3.3 [20]. We performed 10 runs for each K (from
K = 1 to K = 10) and ran the analysis assuming a model of
admixture and correlated allele frequencies. We did not
use any prior information about the population origin of
the genotypes. A burn-in period of 500,000 generations
and MCMC simulations of 700,000 iterations were used in
all the above runs. The values of LnP(D) (the log probability of data) were estimated by assigning a prior from 1 to
10, and the optimal K was chosen based on the delta K
(ΔK) value [21].
