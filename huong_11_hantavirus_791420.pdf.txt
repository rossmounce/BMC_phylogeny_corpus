From 2006 to 2009, a surveillance of the situation of
hantavirus infection in Southern part and Highlands of
Vietnam was carried out based on the tested results of
serum samples from 1,066 rodents representing 6 species and 245 Suncus murinus.
The results of tested rodent sera samples by ELISA,
IFA and confirmed by Western Blot showed that the
prevalence antibody to hantavirus was 16.76% from R.
norvegicus, and 13.1% from S.murinus. The serotyping
result by FRNT revealed that hantaviruses which circulate in Southern Vietnam belong to Seoul and TPMV
serotype. RNA of hantavirus was detected from 3 lung
tissues of Rattus norvegicus samples which are coded as
CSG5, CSG11 and 24D12, all collected in Ho Chi Minh
City (Sai Gon Habor and District 12). The sequencing
and phylogenetic analysis on detected genes (partial
small and medium segments) demonstrated the close
genetic relationship with SEOV representatives found in
Japan, Indonesia Singapore and Northern Vietnam.
The serological analysis revealed the circulation of
hantavirus including Seoul virus (SEOV) from Rattus.sp,
and Thottopalayam virus from S. murinus in Southern
and Highlands of Vietnam. Besides, the detection of specific IgM and the neutralizing antibody against SEOV in
patient indicated the first evidence of the circulation
and transmission of SEOV from rodent to human.
