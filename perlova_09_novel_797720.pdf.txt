Abstract
Although many secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities have been isolated from
myxobacteria, most strains of these biotechnologically important gliding prokaryotes remain
difficult to handle genetically. In this study we describe the new fast growing myxobacterial
thermophilic isolate GT-2 as a heterologous host for the expression of natural product
biosynthetic pathways isolated from other myxobacteria. According to the results of sequence
analysis of the 16S rDNA, this moderately thermophilic isolate is closely related to Corallococcus
macrosporus and was therefore named C. macrosporus GT-2. Fast growth of moderately
thermophilic strains results in shorter fermentation and generation times, aspects which are of
significant interest for molecular biological work as well as production of secondary metabolites.
Development of a genetic manipulation system allowed the introduction of the complete
myxochromide biosynthetic gene cluster, located on a transposable fragment, into the
chromosome of GT-2. Genetic engineering of the biosynthetic gene cluster by promoter exchange
leads to much higher production of myxochromides in the heterologous host C. macrosporus GT2 in comparison to the original producer Stigmatella aurantiaca and to the previously described
heterologous host Pseudomonas putida (600 mg/L versus 8 mg/L and 40 mg/L, respectively).

Background
Although the world wide demand for novel anti-infectious agents is becoming more and more pressing, several
pharmaceutical companies withdrew from "new antibiotic" research because of the long development times and
the high financial risk. At the same time antibiotic resistance of numerous pathogenic organisms is increasing
quickly. In addition, globalization and changes in socio-

economic conditions increase the risk of a spread of currently unknown infectious microorganisms and agents
[1]. During the last two decades, myxobacteria became
widely known as valuable producers of secondary metabolites exhibiting various biological activities [2,3]. However, the optimization of production of the already
known metabolites with promising biological activities
like epothilones [4] or tubulysins [5,6] remains a chalPage 1 of 11

lenging task. Myxobacteria are ubiquitous microorganisms which live on rotting plant material, animal dung
and in soils worldwide [7-9]. These fascinating gram-negative bacteria are able to undergo a developmental life
cycle including the formation of multicellular "fruiting
bodies" upon starvation. The largest known myxobacterial strain collection exists at the Helmholtz Centre for
Infection Research with about 7500 isolates including
novel moderately thermophilic myxobacteria described
by Gerth and Müller [8]. This group of thermophilic
myxobacteria grows between 30°C and 48°C, with a temperature optimum between 42°C and 44°C. In contrast,
the temperature optimum for the growth of other myxobacteria is between 30°C and 34°C. Interestingly, moderately thermophilic myxobacteria grow faster than most
other myxobacteria [8].
Most of the natural products produced by myxobacteria
are polyketides, nonribosomally made peptides or hybrid
compounds. The biosynthesis of these compounds is catalyzed by complex and multimodular polyketide synthases (PKS) or nonribosomal peptide synthetases
(NRPS) comprising numerous domains which are responsible for each catalytic step in the corresponding biosyntheses starting from activated short chain carboxylic acids
or amino acids [10]. To date, various PKS and NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified including several from myxobacteria, e.g. those directing the
biosynthesis of the electron transport inhibitors myxothiazol and melithiazol [11,12], the potential anticancer
agents epothilones and tubulysins [13-15], the myxochromides [16], disorazols [17], chivosazols [18], myxovirescins [19] and some other natural products with
antibacterial, antifungal or cytotoxic activities [20]. The
available genome sequences showed that in most cases
the genome of the producer organism encodes more biosynthetic gene clusters than mirrored by identified compounds. Therefore, the genetic potential to produce
secondary metabolites is higher than originally expected
due to so-called "silent" genes [21]. Whether these genes
are indeed "silent" or the amount of produced compound
is too low for detection is a matter of debate. In a recent
study, we could show that 11 out of 18 biosynthetic gene
clusters in M. xanthus DK1622 are indeed expressed and
translated into proteins during vegetative growth
although only five compounds are known from this strain
[19,21-24]. A similar situation is obvious for Sorangium
cellulosum So ce56, which also contains more genes potentially involved in the production of the secondary metabolism than expected after the isolation of the natural
products from the culture extracts [21,24-26].
One of the possibilities to explore the genetic potential of
such microorganisms or to deliberately modify natural
product biosynthesis is the heterologous expression of the

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/1

corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters. This is particularly useful if the manipulation of the chromosome in the
producer strain is difficult, as in many myxobacterial
strains.
This method allows to access the biosynthetic genes even
from metagenome libraries of unculturable microorganisms if appropriate heterologous hosts are chosen [27,28].
Therefore, the development of heterologous expression
systems for the transfer of large biosynthetic gene clusters
from the natural producer strain into more suitable and
easily culturable heterologous hosts is of great significance
for natural product research [29].
In this work, we characterize Corallococcus macrosporus GT2 exemplarily for moderately thermophilic myxobacteria
as heterologous hosts and describe the expression of the
myxochromide megasynthetase based on a novel transposon gene cluster transfer strategy which also involved promoter exchange. Production of the natural product could
be significantly increased from 8 mg/L in original producer S. aurantiaca to 600 mg/L in GT-2.

Results and discussion
Physiological properties of the isolate C. macrosporus
GT-2
Thermophilic myxobacteria with potential for the biosynthesis of natural products were isolated and described for
the first time in 2005 by Müller and Gerth [8]. The idea to
use thermophilic myxobacteria as heterologous hosts for
the expression of diverse myxobacterial biosynthetic gene
clusters arose with the physiological characterization of
this novel group of bacteria, which exhibits very useful
features such as fast growth in combination with typical
myxobacterial properties such as social behaviour.

Here, we characterize a new thermophilic isolate of C.
macrosporus as model host organism. Strain GT-2 is a moderately thermophilic myxobacterium which grows in yellow coloured swarm colonies. Fruiting bodies resemble
those of Corallococcus and the myxospores are spherical
and optically refractile. The vegetative cells are slender
rods with tapering ends as they are typical for members of
the suborder Cystobacterineae. As published previously
C. macrosporus has a separate systematic position and is
more closely related to M. xanthus than to the other members of Corallococcus [30].
The 16S rDNA of GT-2 was sequenced and submitted in
the NCBI BLAST basic local alignment search tool to identify similar sequences. The moderately thermophilic isolate is closely related to C. macrosporus (98% identity of
the 16S rDNA to the type strain C. macrosporus Cc m8,
DSM 14697) and was therefore named C. macrosporus GT2. Like many nonadapted myxobacteria, C. macrosporus

GT-2 initially grew in liquid medium in small cell aggregates. Therefore, the optimum growth temperature was
determined in 15 l bioreactors by growing the bacteria at
different temperatures (Fig. 1a). In the cause of the fermentations the carbon dioxide concentrations in the

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/1

exhausted air were measured continuously (Fig. 1b). The
time required to reach the turning points in carbon dioxide liberation (CO2 production declines because the carbon source becomes limiting) is easily monitored (Fig.
1b). This value can be used as a measure for growth velocity at the different temperatures (Fig. 1a).
With a temperature increase from 29°C to 41°C the time
needed to reach substrate limitation decreased and
increased again with a rise of temperature to 44°C, which
was the highest temperature tolerated by this strain. The
optimum temperature is approximately 42°C which is
typical for moderately thermophilic myxobacteria. With a
calculated generation time of little more than 2 hours this
isolate grows three times faster than mesothermophilic
Myxococcus isolates [8].
Growth and production of secondary metabolites of
Myxococcus strains are limited by their restriction to amino
acids as sole carbon and energy sources. Ammonium
accumulates and becomes inhibitory to growth [3]. Little
information is available for Corallococcus strains on alternative carbon sources. According to results published previously [30], C. macrosporus assimilates glucose. In our
experiments, we could not verfiy this result for the strain
under study. In contrast, maltose slightly stimulated
growth of the GT-2 strain (Fig. 1b). During fermentation
experiments in 15 l bioreactors, an effect of maltose was
seen as an increase of the optical density, a higher maximum value in the produced CO2 and a slower drop during
the following 30 hours of fermentation. In contrast to
Myxococcus xanthus, GT-2 can use maltose as additional
carbon source (under the given conditions about 7% consumption).

Figure 1
dependence of the temperatures in 5 parallel fermentations
a) The time required to reach substrate limitation is shown in
a) The time required to reach substrate limitation is
shown in dependence of the temperatures in 5 parallel fermentations. The CO2 concentration in the
exhausted air increased in dependency of the cell number as
a consequence of metabolism of the carbon source. The
faster the growth velocity, the earlier the carbon source
became limiting resulting in a drop in CO2 concentration
measured in the exhausted air. The period of time to reach
this turning point is an indirect measure for growth velocity.
b) Effect of maltose on growth and CO2 liberation compared
to a control fermentation without alternative carbon source.
The QCO2 was determined by balancing the exhausted air
(see curves of exhausted air) as described. Growth was
determined by measuring the optical density (black circle =
control culture, open circle = culture with maltose added).

Salt concentrations of marine environments, about 3.2 to
3.8% of NaCl, inhibited the growth of GT-2 but concentrations up to 2% were well tolerated and resulted in doubling of the generation time to 4 hours. Salt tolerance may
be a useful trait for heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters from marine strains [27,31] because of
possibly interconnected underlying regulatory processes.
Similar to most of the myxobacteria described before, C.
macrosporus GT-2 was resistant against numerous antibiotics (Table 1) but the two commonly used selection markers kanamycin and oxytetracycline can be used
representing an additional advantageous property of this
strain.
Development of a genetic manipulation system for GT2
and suitability of this strain as heterologous host
In order to utilize GT-2 as a heterologous host, a genetic
manipulation system for this strain had to be developed.
As marker gene, a kanamycin resistance cassette was cho-

sen. Next, the possibility to integrate foreign DNA
through homologous recombination was analyzed. As a
target for homologous recombination a DNA fragment
from the GT-2 chromosome was amplified using degenerate PCR primers targeting fragments of β-ketoacyl-ACP
synthase (KS) domains of polyketide synthases [32]. The
resulting DNA fragment was cloned into the
pCR2.1TOPO® cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced
to analyze the cloned PKS region. Subsequently, the
resulting plasmid pOPB32 was introduced into the cells
by electroporation. Different protocols were examined
including the variation of such parameters as growth temperature of the cells prior to the preparation of competent
cells, composition of washing and electroporation buffers, different voltage and pulse length as well as the incubation time after electroporation and the composition of
the plating medium. Colony PCR was used as a method to
screen for correct integrations of the suicide plasmid into
the chromosome (data not shown).

Therefore, C. macrosporus GT-2 is the first strain from the
collection of thermophilic myxobacteria for which a
genetic manipulation system has been established.
Although no secondary metabolites could be isolated
from GT-2 extracts derived from a set of growth conditions (including the variation of temperature; data not
shown), the strain possesses genes encoding PKS which
therefore seem to be "silent" under the tested laboratory
conditions. This underscores the fact that the biosynthetic
machinery for the biosynthesis of the heterologous product is available in the strain and at the same time the purification of the obtained product should be easier because
it is not mixed with other produced metabolites.
Different techniques and strategies have been used for the
heterologous expression with the aim to improve the yield
of the natural product [29]. In general, the heterologous
expression in phylogenetically related hosts is regarded
most effective as they provide additional useful features
such as similar GC content and a codon usage like in the
donor strain. Also, other intracellular factors which influence heterologous expression [33] and affect stability of
large transcripts, translational processivity of the long
ORFs and protein folding are most likely available for the
expression of biosynthetic genes in closely related strains.
Another myxobacterium – M. xanthus – has already been
used as a heterologous host for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites from other myxobacterial species, e.g.
epothilone from S. cellulosum [34], myxothiazol from S.
aurantiaca [35] and myxochromide from S. aurantiaca
[36]. However, GT-2 may in the future turn out to be an
advantageous host for the reasons mentioned above and
due to the fact that it grows two to three times faster than
the well established M. xanthus.
Integration of the myxochromide gene cluster into the
chromosome of GT-2
The biosynthetic genes encoding the myxochromide S
megasynthetase in S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 have been
cloned, sequenced and modified for heterologous expression in Pseudomonas putida previously [16,37]. Subsequently, a transposon containing the whole
myxochromide biosynthetic gene cluster as transposable
element was constructed [36]. The transposon harbouring
the constitutive PaphII promoter driving the transcription
of the myxochromide genes is shown in Figure 2. In contrast, the inducible Pm promoter was used to control
expression in P. putida [37].

The integration of the plasmid pOPB32 into the chromosome of GT-2 followed by selection for the kanamycin
resistance derived from the aphII gene verified that the
promoter PaphII is also active in this strain.

et al., 2008).
After electroporation kanamycin resistant colonies were
obtained on the agar plates 2–3 days after incubation at
37°C. Ten randomly chosen colonies were analyzed by
colony PCR (s. Experimental procedures). PCR analysis
showed amplificates of the expected size of 593 bp and
700 bp, respectively and thus verified the successful transposition and integration of the myxochromide gene cluster into the chromosome (data not shown). As expected,
the mutants containing the myxochromid biosynthetic
gene cluster under the control of PaphII promoter produced
the corresponding compound myxochromide S plus its
derivatives constitutively (Fig. 3, 4.).
Analysis of the myxochromide production
Culture extracts of the mutant strains were investigated by
HPLC analysis after growth at 30°C. It was possible to
identify myxochromides S1-3 synthesized by the gene
products of the cloned mch gene cluster from S. aurantiaca
as well as additional myxochromide derivatives (Fig. 3a).
Myxochromide S3 could be detected only in traces and
could not be used for the quantification of total production yields. Additional peaks may represent derivatives of
S1 and S2 lacking methyl groups as has been assumed also
for the novel heterologous myxochromide derivatives in
P. putida [37].

HPLC analysis showed that the tested mutants, which
contain mch genes in the chromosome, differed in their
ability to produce myxochromides relative to each other.
The analysis of the integration position of the transposable element showed that the myxochromide biosynthetic
genes, as expected, have been integrated into different
chromosomal loci of the GT-2 genome (Table 2). The

In order to find optimal conditions for the heterologous
myxochromide production first the influence of the temperature on the production was examined. The cultures
were incubated at different temperatures from 20°C to
42°C for 3 days and the production of myxochromides
was compared. Interestingly, almost no production could
be detected in cultures which were grown at 42°C. While
the optimal growth temperature for GT-2 is 42°C (Fig.

myxochromide production was found to be 25–30°C
(Fig. 3b).
Although it could already be shown for other secondary
metabolite producers that product formation is dependent on temperature and in many cases increases with
lower temperatures even in natural producer strains, e.g.
phaseolotoxin production by Pseudomonas syringae pv.
phaseolicola [38] or phenazine production by P. fluorescens 2–79 [39], the highest level of production of different
secondary metabolites in thermophilic myxobacteria, e.g.
myxothiazols, phenalamids and stigmatellins, has been
detected at the optimal growth temperature of 42°C [8].
For the heterologous biosynthesis of myxochromides in

GT-2 the expression of foreign proteins (PKS and NRPS)
itself might be stressful and lower temperatures might
reduce protein misfolding by slowing down transcription
and translation rates, especially in cases when the proteins
are expressed from strong promoters (such as PaphII in our
case) as has been described in E. coli [40,41]. Interestingly,
the expression of the kanamycin resistance gene occurred
even at higher temperature and allowed the selection of
the kanamycin resistant mutants already after 2 days of
growth on the agar plates. This is highly advantageous
because M. xanthus, another heterologous expression
host, requires 5–10 days for the growth on selection
plates.

Kinetic studies of myxochromide production were carried
out at 30°C. The production correlated with the number
of cells in the culture, so the maximum of production and
a constant amount of the product was reached with the
stationary phase of the culture. The production maximum
was reached after 2 days, compared to 6 days required
when using S. aurantiaca. GT-2 produced approximately
350 mg/L myxochromide S1 and 250 mg/L myxochromide S2 (Fig. 4). The product yield of just the major compounds S1 and S2 was thus larger than 600 mg/L and
therefore much higher than in the original producer S.
aurantiaca (8 mg/L total) and in the previously described
heterologous host P. putida (40 mg/L total) [37] although
in recently described studies of heterologous production
of myxochromides in M. xanthus production of about 1 g/
L could be shown [36].
Transposon based integration of secondary metabolite
biosynthetic genes allows screening for alternative
heterologous hosts
Recently, we described the advantages of Red/ET recombineering for the generation of constructs for the integration into heterologous hosts [35,37,42]. For the

expression of the myxothiazol gene cluster the construct
containing homologous regions for integration either into
M. xanthus or P. putida was introduced into the vector containing all myxothiazol biosynthetic genes. The disadvantage of this strategy is the requirement of the introduction
of different homologous chromosomal targets for each
heterologous host strain. In this study, we used a transposon based strategy which can be employed in a very flexible way for the introduction of the same construct into
different heterologous hosts in parallel experiments to
investigate the suitability of different hosts and conditions
for metabolite production.
With the described transposon based strategy the myxochromide biosynthetic genes were successfully integrated
into already described heterologous host strains – M. xanthus and P. putida [36].
The approach described here might be especially useful in
the future for the expression of silent biosynthetic gene
clusters [21] which can be activated by inserting promoters constitutively active in a variety of host strains. Moreover, our studies showed that C. macrosporus GT-2 may be

developed into a very useful heterologous host for myxobacterial secondary metabolite production in the future.

Methods
Isolation of GT-2
The method for the isolation of moderately thermophilic
myxobacteria has been described previously in detail [8]
GT-2 was isolated from a soil sample from Sousse
(Tunesia).
Media (constituents in g/l) and maintainance of liquid
cultures
Medium M: Soy peptone (Marcor), 10; Maltose; 10: CaCl2
× 2 H2O, 1; MgSO4 × 7 H2O, 1; HEPES, 11.9; Fe-EDTA, 8
mg; pH adjusted to 7.2.

Basic fermentation medium: Soy peptone (Marcor), 5;
CaCl2 × 2 H2O, 1; MgSO4 × 7 H2O, 1; Fe-EDTA, 8 mg;
ZnCl2, 1 mg; K2HPO4 0,1 g; pH adjusted to 7.2.
Liquid cultures were started by inoculating 100 ml of
medium M in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks with 5 ml of precultures. Inoculated flasks were incubated at 42°C on a
rotary shaker at 160 rpm for 4 days.
Fermentation conditions
Basic fermentation medium: Soy peptone (Marcor), 5;
CaCl2 × 2 H2O, 1; MgSO4 × 7 H2O, 1; Fe-EDTA, 8 mg;
ZnCl2, 1 mg; K2HPO4 0,1 g; pH adjusted to 7.2.

Fermentations were performed in 15 l bioreactors (Fermenter B10, Fa. Biologische Verfahrenstechnik) with 10 l
of fermentation medium inoculated with 1 l of a preculture grown under shaking (160 rpm) in the same
medium. The fermentations were run at 29°C, 32°C,
38°C, 41°C, 44°C and at 45°C with an aeration of 0.1
vvm (volumes of air per minute per volume of batch culture). A pH of 7.0 was maintained by the addition of 5%
sulphuric acid.
Dissolved oxygen was measured with a polarographic
stream sterilizable dissolved oxgygen electrode (Ingold).
A pO2 of 40% was maintained by regulation of the stirrer
speed. The exhausted air was measured in a continuous
gas analyser (H. Maihak AG, Hamburg equipped with
unor -CO2 analyser and oxor -oxygen analyser).
Test for effects of carbohydrates on growth
The effect of maltose on growth was investigated in the
basic fermentation medium with additional 10 g/l of maltose and 0.25 g/l of ammonium sulfate. Growth at 42°C
was followed by measuring of the optical density (O.D.)
at 600 nm and the carbon dioxide production.

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/1

Calculation of the generation time
Growth in medium M at 42°C was analyzed every 2 hours
by counting the cell number in a counting cell (Neubauer
improved, 0,02 mm depth; 0,0025 mm2). The generation
time was calculated by the following equation: g = lg2 × t/
lgN1 - lgN0 (g = generation time; t = time of incubation; N
is the mean value of the cell number at time 0 and time 1)
Growth in the presence of NaCl
The effect of sodium chloride was investigated in 100 ml
medium M in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks in the presence of
increasing concentrations of NaCl. For the determination
of the generation time the following medium was used:
marine broth (Difco), 37.4 g/l; peptone (Marcor typ S), 5
g/l; HEPES buffer, 100 mM, pH 7.4.
Antibiotic resistance
After autoclaving of the agar medium M, antibiotics were
added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The plates
were incubated at 30°C. After 1 week the diameter of the
swarm colonies was measured as an indication of growth.
Analysis of maltose content
Culture broths of the fermentations were analysed twice a
day for the maltose content. After centrifugation for 30
min at 10.000 rpm in a Sorvall cool centrifuge, 20 μl of
the supernatant was mixed with 177 μl of distilled water
and 3 μl of a α-glucosidase solution. After incubation for
1 h at 37°C the reaction solution was incubated at 80°C
for 15 min and centrifuged again. The supernatant was
diluted 1:10 with distilled water and the glucose concentration was analysed with a hexokinase test kit (Boehringer Mannheim).
Sequencing of the 16S rDNA from GT-2
A fragment was generated by PCR (Taq DNA polymerase),
using genomic DNA as template and the primers SB19
and SB20 [43] The PCR fragment was cloned using the
TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The insert of the resulting plasmid was sequenced and compared with the NCBI
data bank.
Electroporation into C. macrosporus GT-2
The GT-2 cells were grown in liquid medium M at 30°C
to a final cell density of 109 cells/ml. After centrifugation
and washing with washing buffer (1 mM HEPES, 0.5%
glucose, pH 7.4), cells were resuspended in 1 ml of electroporation medium (0.5% glucose in distilled H2O) to
1010 cells/ml. The cell suspension (100 μl) was mixed
with up to 1 μg of DNA and electroporated (BioRad electroporator) at 25 μF, 1200 V (τ = 5 ms) using 0.1 cm
cuvette. After electroporation 900 μl M medium was
added, then the cells were resuspended in 10 ml M
medium and the Erlenmeyer flasks were incubated at

37°C or at 42°C on a rotary shaker at 160 rpm overnight.
After centrifugation the cells were resuspended in 1 ml liquid M medium and different cell dilutions were plated for
selection on M agar plates (medium M with 1.5% agar)
supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The kanamycin
resistant colonies arising after 2 – 3 days at 42°C were
tested for growth in liquid medium. Integration of the
marker gene was verified by colony PCR with different
primers specific for the integrated DNA.
Analysis of the integration of the myxochromide
biosynthetic gene cluster
The transposon used in this study is shown in Figure
2[36]. After electroporation the mutants were analyzed by
colony PCR for the integration of the myxochromide biosynthetic gene cluster into the chromosome using two
primer pairs: Mch35 and Mch36 [37], and Mch3 (5'-CAAGACGGCCACAGTGAGTCGATGAC) and Mch4 (5'CAAGCGCGCGAAGCGCCTCGGGGC) amplifying 700
bp and 593 bp fragments of the myxochromide biosynthetic genes, respectively. The mutant strain containing
the myxochromide biosynthetic gene cluster and producing highest amount of myxochromide in comparison to
other mutants was named C. macrosporus GT-2::mch and
used for further studies.

In order to identify the insertion sites of the mch gene cluster in GT-2 strain the chromosomal DNA from 6 different
mutants was analyzed. For this purpose a two-step procedure has been applied. The first step was a single-primer
PCR (5'-gcaattccggttcgcttgct) based on the rapid amplification of transposon ends (RATE) protocol [44]. For the second step – sequencing – the additional nested primer (5'ccagtagctgacattcatcc) was used. The preceeding PCR was
performed as a three-step, single-primer PCR. The first
and third steps were performed at stringent temperature
whereas the second step was performed at low temperature (30°C). After initial denaturation for 5 min at 95°C
30 cycles of amplification were performed: 30 s at 95°C,
30 s at 55°C and 30 s at 72°C. The second step included
30 cycles: 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 30°C and 30 s at 72°C. The
last step included 30 cycles as in first step followed by a
final extension at 72°C for 10 min. In the first step the single-stranded products were generated, which were then
amplified in a second step at low temperature with nonspecific binding of the same primer. The third step amplified specific and non-specific products at stringent temperature. PCR reactions were purified and sequenced with
specific nested primers. The results are shown in Table 2.

peratures given in Results and discussion the cells were
harvested by centrifugation and extracted with acetone
and methanol. The extracts were evaporated and dissolved
in 1 ml methanol. 5 μl of the extracts were analyzed by
HPLC (Dionex solvent delivery system coupled to PDA100 Photodiode Array Detector).
The detection was carried out at 400 nm. For quantification the extracts were prepared from 1 ml culture and analyzed by LC-MS (Agilent 1100 series, Bruker HCT plus Ion
Trap mass spectrometer). The chromatographic conditions used were: RP column Nucleodur C18 (MachereyNagel), 125 × 2 mm, 3 μm, and precolumn C18, 8 × 3
mm, 5 μm. A solvent gradient (using solvent A and B with
solvent A being water plus 0.1% formic acid, and solvent
B being acetonitrile plus 0.1% formic acid) from 60% B at
1 min to 95% B within 6 min was applied and followed
by 2 min at 95% B. The myxochromides were identified
by comparison to the retention times and the MS fragmentation pattern of the authentic reference substances
(parent ions are given: myxochromide S1: [M+H]+ = 723;
myxochromide S2: [M+H]+ = 737; myxochromide S3:
[M+H]+ = 749).
