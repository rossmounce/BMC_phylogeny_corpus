Microbiological pattern of arterial catheters in the
intensive care unit

Abstract
Background: Intravascular catheter related infection (CRI) is one of the most serious nosocomial infections.
Diagnostic criteria include a positive culture from the catheter tip along with blood, yet in many patients with
signs of infection, current culture techniques fail to identify pathogens on catheter segments. We hypothesised
that a molecular examination of the bacterial community on short term arterial catheters (ACs) would improve our
understanding of the variety of organisms that are present in this niche environment and would help develop new
methods for the diagnosis of CRI.
Results: The whole bacterial community presenting on all ACs was evaluated by molecular methods, i.e., a strategy
of whole community DNA extraction, PCR amplification followed by cloning and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Ten
ACs were removed from patients suspected of CRI and 430 clones from 5 “colonised” and 5 “uncolonised” (semiquantitative method) AC libraries were selected for sequencing and subsequent analysis. A total of 79 operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified at the level of 97% similarity belonging to six bacterial divisions. An
average of 20 OTUs were present in each AC, irrespective of colonisation status. Conventional culture failed to
reveal the majority of these bacteria.
Conclusions: There was no significant difference in the bacterial diversity between the ‘uncolonised’ and
‘colonised’ ACs. This suggests that vascular devices cultured conventionally and reported as non infective may at
times potentially be a significant source of sepsis in critically ill patients. Alternative methods may be required for
the accurate diagnosis of CRI in critically ill patients.

Background
Intravascular catheters (IVCs) occupy a very important
place in the day-to-day provision of healthcare in hospitals. Nearly 300 million IVCs are used yearly in USA
alone [1]. Along with their undoubted advantages IVCs
are also associated with life-threatening infections [2].
Every year, approximately 3,500 Australians [3] are diagnosed with catheter-related bloodstream infections and
up to 400,000 cases occur annually in the USA [4].
These infections are associated with a fatality rate of
approximately 35% [5] and also significant increases the
hospital stay [6-8]. Catheter-related infection (CRI) also
contributes to the inappropriate and excessive use of
antimicrobial agents and may lead to the selection of
antibiotic-resistant organisms.

Early detection and adequate treatment of causative
pathogens within 24 hours of clinical suspicion of these
infections (development of signs and symptoms) is critical for a favourable outcome, yet the majority of patients
with suspected CRI yield negative diagnostic investigations, necessitating empiric, rather than optimal antimicrobial therapy [9]. For example, in a study of 631
intensive care unit (ICU) catheters, 207 (33%) were
removed due to clinical signs of CRI, yet definitive diagnosis from matched catheter and blood cultures was
only achieved in 27 (13%), and catheter tip colonisation
in 114 (55%) of suspected cases [10].
The current laboratory techniques for diagnosis of
CRI include qualitative culture of the catheter tips,
semi-quantitative culture of the catheter tips, quantitative culture of catheter segments (including the techniques of sonication, vortex or luminal flushing before
catheter culture), and catheter staining methods such as
with acridine orange [11]. These quantitative methods

may have higher sensitivity, but are more time-consuming and complicated than semi-quantitive methods [11].
The semi-quantitative method is still the most commonly used method in clinical microbiology laboratories
around the world [12] and remains the recommended
method for routine clinical microbiological analysis [13].
The semi-quantitative method has however been criticised as regards its accuracy and delay of up to 2-4 days
to provide culture results, therefore potentially delaying
or missing the best treatment opportunity for patients
with serious infections. Finally, the culture method is of
limited value for slow-growing or fastidious bacteria,
and for unculturable or intracellular pathogens, which
can cause endocarditis (e.g. some Viridans Streptococci).
The sensitivity of the semi-quantitative method may
also be reduced if the patient is receiving antibiotic
treatment. There is thus a need for the development of
additional diagnostic methods to supplement conventional culture diagnosis, and molecular techniques have
potential to fulfil this important role.
Arterial catheters (ACs) provide continuous, real-time
blood pressure monitoring, easy, and rapid blood specimen access and are the most heavily manipulated catheters in critically ill patients [14]. It has been recently
reported that the risk of AC-related bloodstream infections is close to that seen with short term central
venous catheters (CVCs). Additionally AC colonisation
rates have been demonstrated in critically ill patients to
approximate those of short term CVCs [15]. Thus
although ACs have been traditionally thought to have a
much lower risk of infection [6,16-18] than short-term
CVCs, this is no longer the case and current thinking
suggests that they must be regarded with the CVC as a
source of sepsis in critically ill patients [19].
The primary aim of this study was to assess the bacterial community on short term ACs in critically ill
patients using culture-independent methods and compare these results with bacterial species diagnosed by
the roll-plate semi quantitive method. The secondary
aim of this study was to compare the bacterial community on ‘colonised’ and ‘uncolonised’ ACs. This study is
the first comprehensive examination of bacterial communities on the surface of short-term ACs in critically
ill patients.

Methods
Hospital setting and study population

The study setting was the ICU of the Royal Brisbane
and Women’s Hospital (RBWH), Queensland, Australia.
This is a university-affiliated, mixed medical and surgical
unit managing all forms of critically ill adult patients,
except cardiac surgery and solid organ transplant
patients. The unit is the sole referral centre for the management of severe burns trauma for the state of

Page 2 of 9

Queensland. During the study period (18 months), the
ICU comprised 36 beds with admissions on average
2,000/annum. The mean (SD) patient Acute Physiology
and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was
of 16 ± 8.3 over this time period.
Patient management was not impinged upon by the
study. Intravascular catheter management including
insertion and removal was at the discretion of the treating clinician. All catheters were managed using a standardised protocol. All AC (Leader Cath, Vygon, Ecouen,
France) were inserted by experienced ICU medical staff
using a Seldinger approach. Aseptic precautions for all
device insertion included use of a full sized drape, mask,
cap, gown and sterile gloves. Chlorhexidine 2% was used
for skin antisepsis. Ultrasound guided placement was
used where required. There was no imposed limitation
on dwell time, and resite of ACs always occurred at a
new site. Dressings and administration sets were maintained by dedicated ICU nurses (1:1 nurse patient ratio)
using unit protocols and in accordance with best evidence practice. All ACs were removed on suspicion of
CRI by clinicians independent of the study, using the
following criteria: intravascular device in situ; 2 or more
SIRS criteria (Temperature >38.5°C or <36.0°C, Heart
Rate >90 bpm, Respiratory Rate >20 bpm or PaCO2 <32
mmHg or requirement for mechanical ventilation,
White Blood Cells >12 000 cells/mm 3 or <4000 cells/
mm3 or presence of >10% immature neutrophils); and
no other source of the sepsis evident. All catheter tips
were handled under aseptic conditions and immediately,
transported to the laboratory for analysis, where they
were cultured by the semi-quantitative method [12].
The cultivation and identification were performed by
trained microbiologists in Microbiology Pathology
Queensland-Central Laboratory, Australia.
Ninety three short-term ACs from four access sites
(65 radial, 15 femoral, 7 brachial and 5 dorsalis pedis),
with a mean catheter in situ time of 6.0 days, from 82
patients with a mean age of 51.0 years old and APACHE
II score of 21.0, were studied. The mean ICU stay was
18.6 days with hospital survival of 86%. The arterial
catheter related colonisation rates were 15.0/1000 device
days and catheter related bloodstream infections rates
were 3.8/1000 device days. These rates reflect the selection of the cohort as those suspected clinically of catheter related infection. There were no significant
associations observed between antibiotic usage and AC
colonisation or bloodstream infections (p = 0.126).
From this original cohort, 5 ‘colonised’ and 5’uncolonised’ ACs were randomly selected for further study
(Table 1). The 5 colonised ACs comprised 2 mixed coagulase-negative Staphylococci, 2 S. epidermidis and 1
P. aeruginosa. No bacterial species were recovered from

the uncolonised catheters using the semi-quantitive
method.
Ethics approval for this study was granted by the
Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital Human Ethics
Board (Protocol 2008/059) and Griffith University
Human Ethics Board.
Semi-quantitative method

The removal ACs were examined using the semi-quantitative method [12]. This method is based on rolling a
segment, usually the tip, of the removed catheter back
and forth on 5% sheep blood agar plates (Oxoid, Australia) after removal. The plates were incubated at 35°C
under aerobic conditions for 2-4 days. Microorganisms
were then isolated and identified according to standard
hospital protocol. Semi-quantitative tip culture was considered colonised if the plate grew ≥15 colony forming
unit (cfu). If <15 cfu were grown, the catheter tip was
considered to be uncolonised.
Detailed molecular methods
DNA extraction and PCR amplification

Catheter tips were suspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer,
which contained 20 mg/ml lysozyme, 20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 1.2% Triton, and Proteinase K
at 37°C overnight. After that, catheter tips were taken
out and bacterial DNA was extracted using the QIAamp
DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Australia). For each catheter, a
control (unused) AC was taken from the original packaging and rolled back and forth on blood agar plates,
with bacterial DNA extracted as above. Sixteen S rRNA
genes were amplified from purified genomic DNA using
the primers 8F and 1490R [20]. For each 25 μl reaction,

conditions were as follows: 3 μl of DNA template (concentration ranged from neat to 1:10 3 ), 2.5 μl of 10 ×
reaction buffer containing 20 mM MgCl 2 , 2 μl of 25
mM dNTPs, 1 μl of each primer (10 μM), 0.1 U of Taq
DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Australia), 5 μl of 5 × BSA
and 10.4 μl of sterile deionised water (sdH 2 O). Each
PCR run contained a negative control (sdH2O instead of
template DNA) and a positive control (E. coli instead of
template DNA). For each DNA sample, three replicate
PCRs were performed. Thermocycling was as follows:
initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30
cycles of a 1-min denaturation, 1-min annealing at 55°C
and 2-min elongation at 72°C, all followed by a final
extension of 10 min at 72°C.
Cloning and sequencing of 16S rDNA PCR products

After purification using the Qiaquick PCR Purification
kit (Qiagen, Australia), the PCR amplified 16S rRNA
gene fragment were ligated into TOPO TA vector Cloning® system (Invitrogen, Ausralia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two microliters of the ligation
mixture was transferred to 1.5 ml sterile tube which was
with competent Escherichia coli TOP10 cells provided
by the manufacturer. The mixture was chilled on ice for
20 min before heat shocking for 45 seconds at 42°C.
The cells were suspended with SOC medium and incubated with shaking at 37°C for one hour. The transformed cells were then plated onto Luria-Bertani
(Promega, Australia) agar plates supplemented with
kanamycin (Sigma, Australia) and incubated at 37°C
overnight. Ninety six of the resulting bacterial colonies
per ligation were picked and grown overnight at 37°C
on LB agar plates containing kanamycin. Plasmid DNA
was released from bacterial cells by boiling and one

microliter was used as the template in PCR with an M13
forward and reverse primers to determine the correct
sizes of inserts. The presence and size of inserts was
determined by electrophoresing the PCR products on a
1% agarose gel. Subsequently positive PCR products
were purified, lyophilized and sent to Macrogen Inc.
(Seoul, South Korea) for sequencing using ABI PRISM®
BigDye™ and M13F vector-specific primer.

estimator curve reaches a plateau, the sequencing effort
was considered to be sufficient to provide an unbiased
estimate of OTU richness, as proposed by Kemp & Aller
[26]. Rarefaction curve was generated by plotting the
number of OTUs observed against number of sasequences sampled. The P value generated from two tailed
t-test was used to determine significance of difference
between different parameters.

Alignment and phylogenetic analysis

The 16S rRNA gene clones of the arterial catheters were
divided into two groups, i.e., uncolonised ACs and colonised ACs. The 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained
were manually proofread, corrected and edited to start
and end with the corresponding primer nucleotide
(using reverse complement transform if necessary) using
BioEdit [21]. Sequences with incorrect inserts or with
ambiguous bases were excluded from further sequence
analyses. Vector sequences detected by cross match
were trimmed off. Trimmed, assembled sequences were
then aligned to a core set of sequences using the NAST
alignment tool on the Greengens website (http://greengenes.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/nph-index.cgi). All 16S rRNA gene
sequences were screened for potential chimeras using
BELLEROPHON which was also available on the Greengens website [22] and sequences flagged as potential chimeras were discarded from further analysis. Sequences
were compared to the NCBI GenBank database using
the BLAST program. All examined 16S rRNA gene
clone sequences and their most similar GenBank
sequences which were not available in the Greengenes
database at the time of analysis were identified from
BLAST searches of sequences retrieved in this study and
were then imported into the ARB software package
(http://www.arb-home.de) [23].
OTU determination and diversity estimation

The Olsen corrected distance matrix was exported from
the ARB program and all sequences were grouped into
operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) by the furthestneighbour algorithm Distance-based Operational Taxonomic Unit and Richness (DOTUR). DOTUR assigned
sequences accurately to OTUs based on sequence data
using values that are less than the cut off level [24]. A
cluster with less than 3% substitutions in the phylogenetic tree was usually matched with the same species or
relatives in GenBank as confirmed by the RDP Classifier
results. In this study, a similar cut off of 97% was defined
as an OTU. This same cut off was used for diversity
indices and richness estimates that were calculated by
DOTUR. In this study, the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, and Chao and ACE richness estimates were
calculated by DOTUR to estimate microbial diversity and
richness. Bacterial species evenness was also calculated
[25]. The Chao richness estimator curves were continuously calculated during the sequencing phase. When the

Results
Composition of the 16S rRNA gene clone library

Bacterial DNA was extracted from all ten ACs, regardless of whether they were ‘colonised’ or ‘uncolonised’ as
defined by the semi-quantitative roll-plate method.
These DNA samples were successfully amplified and
used for constructing 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. No
bacterial DNA was detected from negative control ACs
which proves bacterial presentation on ACs.
In the 16S rRNA gene clone library construction,
1,848 white colonies were identified including 926 from
colonised ACs and 922 from uncolonised ACs. From
these colonies, 980 (98 from each of the 10 ACs) were
randomly selected, which accounted for 53.0% of the
total clones. Among the clones, 430 clones were
sequenced in total, obtaining 417 clone partial
sequences. The lengths of the sequences for genetic
comparison ranged between 771-867 bp, with an average for all the sequences of 808 bp. Most of the
sequences matched a GenBank species or clone with an
identity equal to or greater than 95% (396 out of 417).
Chimera checks showed that all sequences were unlikely
to be chimeric.
Phylogenetic profiles and taxonomic distribution of the
16S rRNA gene clones among the ACs

All 417 sequences clustered into six groups (phyla or
classes) according to the taxonomic classification of the
NCBI database. These bacterial groups were Firmicutes,
Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Unclassified_Proteobacteria and Unclassified
Bacteria. The single most dominant division was Gammaproteobacteria (75.0%), which included Xanthomonadalessubdivision (45.9%), Enterobacteriales-subdivision (24.5%),
and Pseudomonadales-subdivision (4.6%), followed by
Betaproteobacteria (12%) which were all within Burkholderiales-subdivision, Alphaproteobacteria (8%), Firmicutes
(4%) including Staphylococcaceae-subdivision (1.5%) and
Streptococcaceae-subdivision (2.5%), Unclassified proteobacteria (0.5%) and Unclassified Bacteria (0.5%).

Figure 1 Division level distribution of 16S rRNA gene clone sequences in uncolonised and colonised ACs.

There were no significant differences between the
uncolonised and colonised ACs in terms of the distribution of the taxonomic groups (Figure 1). Firmicutes
accounted for approximate 4.50% and 2.53% of clone
libraries from uncolonised and colonised ACs respectively. Alphaproteobacteria accounted for 12% in colonised ACs which was four times more than in
uncolonised ACs. Similar trends were seen in Pseudomonadales which accounted for 6.6% in colonised ACs
and only 1.69% in uncolonised ACs. Colonised ACs contained more Betaproteobacteria/Burkholderiales (14.07%)
than uncolonised ACs (8.99%). Similar proportions of
Enterobacteriales, Xanthomonadales and unclassified
bacteria were observed in both groups. The difference
between the overall distributions of the taxonomic
groups in colonised and uncolonised ACs was not statistically significant (p = 0.976).
OTU distribution among colonised and uncolonised ACs

All of 417 sequences were grouped into OTUs based on
their genetic distance in a neighbour-joining tree with
the DOTUR program. Using the furthest-neighbour
method of calculation and a similarity threshold of 97%,
DOTUR assigned the 417 sequences into 79 OTUs.
There is an average of 20 OTUs from each ACs including uncolonised and colonised devices. Approximately
one quarter of the OTUs (21) were composed of a single sequence. However, three OTUs contained 30 or
more sequences. The majority of OTUs and sequences
belong to the division Proteobacteria with 86.1% and
95.9%, respectively for colonised and uncolonised ACs.
The largest three OTUs, a member of the division Gammaproteobacteria and family Xanthomonadaceae,

contained 191 sequences (45.8%). Other common Proteobacteria OTUs indentified included Enterobacteriaceae,
Pseudomonadaceae,
Sphingomonadaceae,
Comamonadaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Oxalobacteraceae,
Caulobacteraceae, Phyllobacteriaceae, and Bradyrhizobiaceae (Figure 2). OTUs and sequences were also identified from the division Firmicutes (11.4% and 4%,
between colonised and uncolonised ACs respectively)
including species of the family Veillonellaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Streptococcaceae. We also identified two
novel OTUs that were < 93% similar to any sequences
in GenBank. These two OTUs were 92% and 91% similar to unknown clones from environmental samples.
Overall there were 51 OTUs for colonised ACs and 44
OTUs uncolonised ACs. There were 33 and 27 singleand double-sequence OTUs for colonised and uncolonised ACs. Of the 79 OTUs identified in the two sets of
samples, 40 (50.6%) were identified in both groups.
However, these 40 OTUs represent 339 of 417
sequences (81.5%) of the clones. There was no significant difference between the distribution of sequences
generated from colonised and uncolonised ACs in
OTUs (p = 0.316).
The total species evenness (E) for the colonised and
uncolonised ACs was 0.81 and 0.88 respectively. The
total microbial richness for colonised and uncolonised
ACs were calculated and estimated by Chao and ACE.
Chao takes into account singletons and doubletons,
while ACE uses OTUs having one to ten clones each. It
was observed that OTU richness would increase with
additional sequencing of clones. Both the Chao and
ACE estimation for uncolonised ACs clone libraries
were slightly lower than colonised ACs clone libraries

Figure 2 Diversity of OTUs and their abundances in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. The taxonomic identity of each OTU was identified by
phylogenetic analyses of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequences after separating them into the major bacterial phyla. A total of 79 OTUs were
shown but not all the species names were labelled.

(Table 1). As ACE and Chao are dependent of the
amount of singletons, the discrepancies with the diversity indices are most probably due to different amounts
of singletons in the clone libraries. From observed and
estimated total richness for uncolonised and colonised
ACs, we estimated that there was a minimum 5-10
more OTUs per group yet to be uncovered. However, it
should be noted that no complex microbial community
has even ever been sampled to completion. Rarefaction
curve analyses (Figure 3) indicate that our sampling of
clones is sufficient to give an overview of dominant
microbial communities on the examined uncolonised
and colonised ACs.
To estimate the relative diversity using 16S rRNA
gene for colonised and uncolonised ACs, we calculated
both Shannon and Simpson Diversity Indices, measures
of ecosystem biodiversity. Each diversity index is associated with specific biases. The Shannon index places a
greater weight on consistency of species abundance in
OTUs, while the Simpson Index gives more weight to
the abundance of OTUs. The Shannon’s diversity index

clone libraries using an OTU threshold of 97% identity.

H’ values for colonised and uncolonised ACs were 3.20
and 3.31 (Table 1). The Simpson diversity index values
for colonised and uncolonised ACs were 0.93 and 0.95.
Both indices suggest similar diversity profiles for both
colonised and uncolonised ACs. The largest OTU from
the colonised ACs contained 54 sequences and the
OTU from the uncolonised ACs contained 26
sequences, which might explain the slightly lower diversity index values in colonised ACs. While these results
suggested that the diversity indices in uncolonised ACs
was slightly higher than colonised ACs, there was no
significant difference between the two groups (p =
0.986).

Discussion
Culture-independent methods have been successfully
and widely used to reveal the microbial community in
environmental and human samples [27-29]. Among
these methods, the 16S rRNA gene clone screening
approach provides a direct method for investigating bacterial diversity [27-29]. This study is the first attempt to
use 16S rRNA gene clone screening approach to assess
the bacterial community on surfaces of ACs taken from
critically ill ICU patients with suspected catheter related
blood-stream infections.
The results revealed a remarkable diversity of bacteria
on ACs. It is generally believed that coagulase-negative
staphycocci (such as Staphylococcus epidermidis) and
Staphylococcus aureus, a subvision of phylum Firmicutes
are the most dominant bacteria found in ACs although
the infection rates might vary with different catheter
insertion sites [30,31]. However, in this study the majority of sequences on ACs were from the division Gammaproteobacteria. The single most dominant
subdivision was Xanthomonadales (Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia).
A large number of bacterial clones in the libraries
were from Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonadales and Burkholderiales which all contain pathogenetic species.
Many of these bacteria are difficult to cultivate. Many of
the examined clones were also closely related to known
pathogens or opportunistic pathogens, but they were
not identified by the semi-quantitative method. These
sequences are the closest neighbours of Staphylococcus
epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Delftia acidovorans, Escherichia coli, Shigella
flexneri, Comamonas testosteroni, and Brevundimonas
diminuta. Impressively, over 45% of clones examined in
this study were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Over the
last decade, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has been
documented as an important agent of nosocomial infection, including bloodstream infection, and has been
associated with high mortality (26.7%) [32,33]. It was the

Page 7 of 9

third most frequent non-fermentative Gram-negative
bacterium reported in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program between 1997 and 2001 [32]. Several
reports on catheter-related bloodstream infections
caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia exist [32-34].
Stenotrophomonas is increasingly recognised as a very
important pathogen in the critically ill patient. In particular, it may become problematic in long stay patients
who have been exposed to broad spectrum antibiotics.
In this regard our result describing the abundance of
this organism on ACs may have additional importance.
In our ICUs this pathogen is not infrequently seen in
this context, and treatment may be difficult due to resistance. Shigella species were also identified from both
colonised and uncolonised ACs in this study. For a long
time, it was believed that Shigella species were confined
to the bowel and cause Shigellosis. However, several
reports have now appeared in the literature of Shigella
bacteraemia [35,36]. Shigella bacteraemia is still very
rare and the mechanism of bacteraemia by Shigella species remains unclear [37]. Shigella was not however
reported as a cause of bacteraemia arising from ACs.
Delftia acidovorans, a bacterium known to be resistant
to a class of drugs commonly used to treat systemic
gram-negative infections (aminoglycosides) [38,39], was
also identified in this study. Timely identification at species level is necessary to determine the most appropriate
antibiotic therapy [38].
The results of the culture-dependent (semi-quantitive)
and culture-independent (molecular) methods appear
incongruent. Whereas semi-quantitive method reported
the most frequently isolated bacteria from intravascular
catheters as coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus [16,40], our molecular data analysis
from 16S rRNA gene clone sequences presented Stenotrophomonas maltophilia as the predominant bacteria.
There are several reports of discrepancies between culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches for
bacterial community studies [29,41,42]. Culture dependent methods bias bacteria who favour the growth
media and grow fast under standard laboratory conditions. In addition, some bacterial species may compete
with others for nutrients or they may even inhibit other
bacteria from growing [20,41,43]. Unlike the semi-quantitive method, which only examines bacteria on outer
surfaces of catheters, the molecular method used here
enables assessing bacteria on both inner and outer surfaces of catheters. Together these factors might help
explain variations of the bacterial community examined
by these two methods. Compared to culture-dependent
methods, culture-independent methods provide more
comprehensive information on the bacterial community.
The knowledge gained from this study may be a beginning step in improved understanding of pathogenesis

and infection risks for critically ill patients with intravascular catheters. Replication of this study in other settings, as well as exploring the relationship between type
and timing of commencement for antibiotic therapy,
and diagnostic results, are important areas for future
research.

Conclusions
This study of critically ill patients with suspected CRI,
has demonstrated that both colonised and uncolonised
ACs examined by molecular method have an average of
20 OTUs per catheter, most of which are not isolated
by the semi-quantitative method. Overall there were 79
OTUs in the two sets of samples which comprised 51
OTUs for colonised ACs and 44 OTUs uncolonised
ACs. Of the 79 OTUs identified in the two sets of samples, 40 were identified in both groups. Statistically
there was no significant difference in bacterial composition between uncolonised and colonised ACs, as confirmed by the results of t-test of taxonomic group
distribution, the OTU distribution, and diversity indices.
Taken together, this study suggests that in vascular
devices removed for suspicion of CRI and analysed
using semi-quantitative method, a negative culture result
may not be indicative of non infective catheters. Moreover, these culture negative catheters may at times be a
significant source of sepsis in critically ill patients.
Whilst the clinical significance of these findings requires
further study before any such conclusions may be
drawn, the results suggest a need for the development
of new methods that more accurately determine the presence of pathogens on intravascular devices.
