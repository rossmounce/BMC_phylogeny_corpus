Background: In Drosophila melanogaster the Enhancer of split-Complex [E(spl)-C] consists of seven
highly related genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) repressors and intermingled, four
genes that belong to the Bearded (Brd) family. Both gene classes are targets of the Notch signalling
pathway. The Achaete-Scute-Complex [AS-C] comprises four genes encoding bHLH activators. The
question arose how these complexes evolved with regard to gene number in the evolution of
insects concentrating on Diptera and the Hymenoptera Apis mellifera.
Results: In Drosophilids both gene complexes are highly conserved, spanning roughly 40 million
years of evolution. However, in species more diverged like Anopheles or Apis we find dramatic
differences. Here, the E(spl)-C consists of one bHLH (mβ) and one Brd family member (mα) in a
head to head arrangement. Interestingly in Apis but not in Anopheles, there are two more E(spl)
bHLH like genes within 250 kb, which may reflect duplication events in the honeybee that occurred
independently of that in Diptera. The AS-C may have arisen from a single sc/l'sc like gene which is
well conserved in Apis and Anopheles and a second ase like gene that is highly diverged, however,
located within 50 kb.
Conclusion: E(spl)-C and AS-C presumably evolved by gene duplication to the nowadays complex
composition in Drosophilids in order to govern the accurate expression patterns typical for these
highly evolved insects. The ancestral ur-complexes, however, consisted most likely of just two
genes: E(spl)-C contains one bHLH member of mβ type and one Brd family member of mα type and
AS-C contains one sc/l'sc and a highly diverged ase like gene.

Background
The Notch pathway is one of the best studied cell to cell
communication systems in the animal kingdom. It is
highly conserved and used from worm to man. This pathway is needed whenever cell decisions are influenced by
cell-cell communication, and also during proliferation or
pathway crosstalk [1]. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a

model system, the Notch pathway was intensely studied
over many years. The best defined process governed by
Notch is called "lateral inhibition": cells of a given fate are
singled out from an equivalence group of the same fate,
whereas the differentiation of the other cells is suppressed
by the Notch signal. This happens for example during
neurogenesis, where neuroblasts are selected from pronePage 1 of 20

Conservation of the E(spl)-C in Drosophilids
Figure 1
Conservation of the E(spl)-C in Drosophilids. A) The E(spl)-C is highly conserved in Drosophilids with regard to gene
number and transcript orientation (arrows). The size of the complex is also almost the same; in D. pseudoobscura (D. pseu) it is
only slightly larger than in D. melanogaster (D. mel). The smallest seems to be the D. virilis (D. vir) complex, however, the virilis
sequence was not completed at the time. The best identity at protein level is found between the Gro orthologs (purple) followed by the bHLH proteins (red). Interestingly the proteins of the centrally located bHLH genes Mγ, Mβ and M3 (framed
blue) are best conserved. Higher identities are seen between the melanogaster and pseudoobscura orthologs than between the
ones of D. melanogaster and D. virilis, with the exception of M7 (blue circle). The worst conserved member of the complex is
M1. (Numbers give % identity between the proteins). B) Alignment of the Mγ and (C) M7 orthologs. The bHLH (purple) and
orange domains are the best conserved parts of the orthologs. The M7 sequences labelled with the black box are unexpectedly
better conserved in D. virilis than in D. pseudoobscura compared with D. melanogaster. Identical residues are marked in blue; red
shows highly related and yellow similar residues.

ural clusters; they keep neural fate, whereas the surrounding cells eventually differentiate as epidermoblasts. The
name giving transmembrane Notch-receptor interacts
physically with the extracellular domain of the transmembrane ligands Delta or Serrate of the signalling cell. After
this activation, the intracellular domain of Notch is
cleaved and travels into the nucleus where it transcriptionally activates together with Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)]
genes of the Enhancer of split complex [E(spl)-C]. E(spl)
gene products in turn repress the activity of proneural
genes encoded for example by the Achaete-Scute-Complex
[AS-C]. As consequence these cells stay undifferentiated to
become epidermoblasts later on, whereas the signalling
cell enters into the programmed neural cell fate. In the
focus of our studies are these two complexes, E(spl)-C and
AS-C, since in D. melanogaster they are composed of several genes with complex expression patterns and specific
yet
partly
redundant
functions.
Enhancer of split was originally identified by genetic means
as enhancer of the duplicated bristle phenotype found in
the recessive Notch allele split [2]. In order to identify the
responsible gene the Enhancer of split gene region has been
cloned. In this region 13 transcription units are located
and named m1 to m10 and mα to mδ. It was a surprise that
seven of these genes encode structurally related proteins
characterized by a basic and a helix-loop-helix domain
(bHLH), a further alpha-helix forming 'orange domain'
and a stereotypic terminus with the amino acids tryptophane, arginine, proline, tryptophane (WRPW). Later it
was shown that this motif serves as binding site for the
global co-repressor Groucho (Gro, transcription unit m9/
10), which is encoded by a gene localised next to the
bHLH gene cluster [3-10]. The bHLH genes m3, m5, m7,
m8, mβ, mγ and mδ (see Fig. 1; [8]) are all transcriptional
targets of Notch: they encode the effector proteins of the
Notch signal at least in the process of lateral inhibition
[1,11-13]. Apart from the seven bHLH genes and the
neighbouring gro locus, the E(spl)-C comprises five further
genes. Four genes mα, m2, m4 and m6 share structural
similarity with the Bearded (Brd)-gene family and are
themselves transcriptional targets of Notch, whereas m1 is
completely unrelated and encodes a putative protease
inhibitor [14,15]. Larger deficiencies encompassing several of E(spl) transcripts cause a severe neural hyperplasia,
whereas loss of activity of single genes do not, suggesting
redundancy of these seven bHLH genes [7,10,16-18].
However, remarkable differences were observed between
the respective expression patterns in the embryo as well as
in postembryonic tissues, arguing against complete
redundancy [8,12,14,15,19-22]. Consistently, a high conservation of the entire complex was observed in the rather
distantly related fly species Drosophila hydei [23]. The
question, however, remains whether gene number and
structure of the complex is conserved during longer terms

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/67

of evolution. For example, in vertebrates an E(spl)-C like
in D. melanogaster does not exist. Here the Notch target
genes have been classified as HES (hairy/Enhancer of
split) and HER/HESR (hairy/Enhancer of split related)
genes, because the D. melanogaster segmentation gene
hairy encodes a bHLH protein with orange domain and
WRPW motif that is as similar to the vertebrate HES genes
as are the E(spl) bHLH genes [24,25]. The vertebrate genes
are not clustered in a complex. Apparently, in the course
of evolution rearrangements occurred between these
Notch target genes.
The AS-C in D. melanogaster comprises four genes, achaete
(ac), scute (sc), lethal of scute (l'sc) and asense (ase) that all
encode transcriptional activators of the bHLH class. They
determine proneural fate and are thus required for the
development of the central and peripheral nervous system
[13,26-29]. These genes have been also studied in vertebrates. In the mouse there are three achaete-scute family
members abbreviated ASH for Ac-Sc-Homolog [30]:
MASH-1 and XASH-3/CASH-4 are two members that are
involved in the development of the nervous system [30].
Both complexes are therefore good candidates to look for
the changes that occurred during insect evolution.
In this work, we studied the evolution of the E(spl)-C and
AS-C by making use of the recent advances in the genome
projects of the Diptera D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis, Anopheles gambiae and the Hymenoptera Apis mellifera. The estimated distances are nearly 30 million years (Myr)
separating D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura which
both belong to the Sophophora subgenus and around 40
Myr separating the Sophophora from the Drosophila subgenus where D. virilis belongs to [31]. The distance between
these modern dipterans and the more ancient ones like
the Culicidae A. gambiae is estimated 200–250 Myr and
that between Diptera and Hymenoptera like the honeybee
A. mellifera 250–300 Myr [32]. Our study shows that both
gene complexes are highly conserved in Drosophilids
with regard to overall size, gene number and structural
similarity of the encoded proteins. In contrast, more
ancient dipterans like the mosquito and similarly also the
honeybee have much simpler gene complex structures:
the E(spl)-C consists of just one mβ like bHLH gene and
one mα like Brd-type gene. However, in Apis two more
bHLH/WRPW coding genes are found within about 200
kb and may reflect an enlargement of the E(spl)-C in this
species. The AS-C consists of only one sc/l'sc like member
and one further ase-like gene that is, however, widely
diverged. These data suggest that the evolution of modern
Drosophilids included an enlargement of these complexes, notably a multiplication of the genes in the E(spl)C that seem to have subsequently specified their roles in
Notch signalling pathway. Their strict conservation in
Drosophilids argues for a diversification presumably

driven by their highly specified expression patterns and
regulatory activities.

Results
The Enhancer of split complex in Drosophilids
The Enhancer of split complex [E(spl)-C] consists of 13
transcription units (Fig. 1): seven genes (m3, m5, m7, m8,
mβ, mγ, mδ) encode highly related basic helix-loop-helix
proteins, four have been grouped to the Brd-family (m2,
m4, m6, mα); m1 which encodes a serine protease inhibitor and l(3) groucho (gro) which encodes a co-repressor of
the E(spl) bHLH protein family. Although the E(spl)
bHLH proteins are partly redundant and, therefore, a loss
or addition of genes could be without consequences, the
complex is highly conserved in all studied Drosophilids
with respect to gene order and number, transcription orientation and overall size. As expected, the evolution rate
of the orthologs is different. The best conservation is
found between the Gro orthologs (more than 96% identity, Fig. 1), whereas M1 displays the highest evolutionary
rate (less than 61% identity between D. melanogaster and
D. virilis; Fig. 1).
The bHLH proteins of the E(spl)-C
In the Drosophilids, all E(spl) bHLH genes are without
intron, and the proteins contain the typical bHLH and
orange domains and end with the WRPW motif. The best
conserved bHLH ortholog is Mγ followed by M3, Mβ, M5,
Mδ and M7/8 (Fig. 1). However, the evolutionary rate varies quite strongly. Comparing D. melanogaster with D. virilis, the highest identity score is found for Mγ with ~92%
(Fig. 1A,B) and the lowest for M8 with ~81%. An even
more striking difference in the identity scores is observed
when comparing the D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura
orthologs M3 and M7 (93% versus 73%; Fig. 1A,C). The
low degree of conservation of the M7 proteins is rather
surprising. It is based on one hand on peculiar size variations: 206 residues in D. pseudoobscura, 186 in D. melanogaster and 197 in D. virilis (Fig. 1C). On the other hand,
the amino acid composition of the bHLH and orange
domains is much better conserved between D. melanogaster and D. virilis than between D. melanogaster and D.
pseudoobscura. This is different from all the other bHLH
orthologs: the bHLH domains of M3 and Mβ are identical
in all three species and also the other ones are extremely
similar. Only one conservative change is detected in the
Mγ bHLH domain of D. melanogaster compared with D.
virilis, and just two in M5. The bHLH domains of the M8
and Mδ proteins contain also single non-conservative
replacements, apart from a few conservative changes.
However, D. pseudoobscura M7 shows an unusual high
number of changes – six replacements and five conservative changes – within the bHLH domain if compared to
the melanogaster ortholog (Fig. 1C).

The Bearded-protein family in the E(spl)-C
In general, the Brd-type proteins evolve faster than the
bHLH proteins: M4 and Mα are the best conserved members with ~82% identity between virilis and melanogaster
and are thus within the range of the fastest evolving m7/8
bHLH coding genes (Fig. 1). The overall structure of M4
and Mα orthologs is quite similar in all studied Drosophila
species. The so-called 'bearded'-domain is completely
identical in the Mα orthologs, M4 has only a few gaps.
However, the predicted D. virilis m4 gene has an extended
open reading frame of novel 132 residues at the 5' end,
whereas the remaining 156 residues are conserved. The
melanogaster m4 5' region reveals similarity at the DNA
level, however, has no open reading frame. Therefore it
remains questionable whether the larger open reading
frame in D. virilis is indeed translated. The other two Brdfamily members, M2 and M6, are much less conserved:
Only approximately 68% identity is found between the
respective orthologs of D. melanogaster and D. virilis.
Despite this little conservation, the typical Brd protein
domains can still be recognized. The most prominent is
the predicted basic amphipathic α-helix domain in the Nterminal protein region [14].
The m1 gene in the E(spl)-C
The m1 gene encodes a protein that has the signatures of
serine protease inhibitors [15]. Despite a low degree of
conservation which ranges between 60 and 70% identity
between the M1 orthologs (Fig. 1A), the structurally
important cysteines residues are conserved in number and
spacing [15]. Notably, the orthologous genes of D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis have a significantly longer open
reading frame at the 5'end that extends the proteins for
approximately 50 residues to 203 in the case of D. virilis.
The extended protein parts share ~68% similarities within
the first 30 residues between the two orthologs. Furthermore, the first nine residues have only one conservative
exchange arguing for its translation in vivo. In melanogaster all three reading frames at the 5' end are blocked
by several stop codons, excluding a likewise 5' extension.
However, at the DNA level there are identities of 69% to
the virilis ortholog and 79% to the pseudoobscura ortholog
which could be also interpreted as conserved regulatory
sequence.
The E(spl)-C in Anopheles gambiae
Albeit Anopheles belongs to the dipteran flies it does not
contain an E(spl)-C that matches that of Drosophilids
(Fig. 2A). Only a single transcription unit with respectable
conservation that contains one intron was annotated in
the genome project (ENSANGG00000017601; see Tab.
1). However, the predicted coding sequence does not end
with a WRPW motif as expected for E(spl) bHLH proteins.
By searching through the genomic sequence, we propose
a different gene structure, where the transcript extends

The E(spl)-C in mosquito A. gambiae
The E(spl)-C in mosquito A. gambiae. (A) The E(spl)-C in the mosquito is composed of two putative genes, A.g.mβ and
A.g.mα. Approximately 100 kb away a second bHLH coding gene was detected, however, the analysis predicted a close relationship to Deadpan and Hairy. Since a good fitting hairy ortholog is elsewhere in the mosquito genome, the gene is most likely
a dpn ortholog. B) Alignment between A.g.Mβ and D.m.Mβ shows good conservation within the bHLH and the orange domains

into the intron that maintains an open reading frame and
ends with a WRPW motif. In this case, the E(spl) homolog
of mosquito would be without intron and shares highest
similarity to the Mβ/Mγ pair of D. melanogaster (80.3/
75.7% similarity and 69.6/67.4% identity, respectively).
Based on the similarity, we propose that it corresponds to
D.m.mβ (Fig. 2B) and named it therefore A.g.mβ. Moreover, there is a single Brd-like gene in close proximity (~8
kb) of A.g.mβ (Fig. 2A). This gene encodes a protein most
similar to the D. melanogaster Mα protein with almost
60% identity (Fig. 3A); therefore we named it A.g.mα. It
shares all features of the Brd-family proteins described
earlier [14], including the amphipathic α-helix domain in
the N-terminal part (Fig. 3B).

related to D. melanogaster Deadpan (Dpn; 57% identity)
than to E(spl) bHLH Mβ (52% identity). The conservation
extends beyond the amino acid sequence: we find the
same intron/exon structure in this Anopheles gene as in the
deadpan and hairy genes from Drosophila (see also Fig. 8a).
We believe that this Anopheles protein corresponds to Dpn
(A.g.Dpn) rather than to Hairy, since it shares little more
than 47% identity with D. melanogaster Hairy. The best hit
with the D. melanogaster Hairy protein is found on the second chromosome in Anopheles (A.g.h; 72% identity at protein level). Other genes of the Drosophila E(spl)-C were not
detected nearby: maybe they are not conserved enough to
be discovered like e.g. m6 or they are located at totally different positions in the genome like gro.

Approximately 100 kb from the 3' end of A.g.mβ, we
detected another sequence that might encode an E(spl)
bHLH type protein (Fig. 2A; ENSANGG00000017548).
However, the presumptive gene product is more highly

The E(spl)-C in Apis mellifera
Like in the mosquito, there is no extended E(spl)-C in the
honeybee. In fact, we find a similar structure of one E(spl)
bHLH type and one Brd-type gene that share highest

homology to Mβ and to Mα, respectively (Fig. 4A). The
relative transcription orientation (head to head) is the
same, suggesting that mβ and mα represent the ur-complex (compare Figs. 1A, 2A, 4A). However, the situation in
honeybee is more complicated in several respects.
For example, the A.m.mα homolog is predicted to consist
of five exons that code for a protein with 402 residues.
This is considerably larger than the 138 residues of
D.m.Mα. Again, we propose a different gene structure
based on the analysis of the genomic DNA, where the
translation extends into the first postulated intron and
ends shortly afterwards. The encoded protein than consists of only 168 amino acids and terminates with residues
that are very similar to the Mα Drosophila homolog (M Q
V A) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, it shows the typical amphipathic
α-helix domain in the N-terminal part (Fig. 3B). The other
motifs are also conserved, the extreme C-terminus is,
however, only similar (Fig. 3A). This protein shows also
high similarity to Drosophila Twin of m4 (Tom) that might
slightly exceed that to D.m.Mα depending on the parameters used. As in mosquito, no other Brd-like protein was
found in the honeybee database such that a Brd-complex
seems non-existent, unlike in Drosophilids [33].
The Apis database annotates a single intron for the A.m.mβ
gene that conforms to the GT AG rule. This is in contrast
to all the Drosophila E(spl) bHLH genes that are intronless.
Moreover, there are several possible start sites and it
remains unclear which one is used. In D. melanogaster,
there are other bHLH-WRPW encoding genes that contain
introns, like deadpan (dpn) or Side. However, the respective protein sequences do not align well with A.m.Mβ, and
the Apis genome contains predicted orthologs to these
genes at other locations (see below). The A.m.Mβ protein
is also highly similar to melanogaster Mγ with 72.3 versus
77.7% similarity and 65 versus 67.5% identity compared
to D.m.Mβ (Fig. 4B). These differences are extremely
small. In fact, the Apis database proposes this gene as mγ
based on the similarity within the bHLH domain. However, we used for our comparison the entire protein
sequences and calculated identity overall. Moreover,

based on the E(spl)-C structure in Anopheles, we favour the
hypothesis that mβ is the ancestral gene.
Within the ~250 kb contig (GroupUn. 159), there are two
further stretches that might encode E(spl) type bHLH proteins. One is located about 150 kb apart. This gene contains no introns and the encoded protein shows
homology to both Mβ and Mγ. In this case, the similarity
seems slightly higher to Mγ than to Mβ (72.2 vs. 69.3%
similarity and 66 vs. 62.7% identity). Therefore, we call
the gene A.m.mγ (Fig. 4A,B). Both FlyBase and BlastN give
a higher score to D. melanogaster Mβ than to Mγ. Presumably, both use similar paradigms based on an alignment
of only the best conserved sequences, whereas we used
less stringent parameters (see Methods) to allow an alignment of the complete sequences. As to be expected, the
two E(spl) honeybee proteins A.m.Mβ and A.m.Mγ are
highly related to each other with a similarity of 73% and
an identity of 67%. Interestingly, this numbers are very
similar to those from a likewise comparison of the D. melanogaster Mβ and Mγ homologs (Table 1).
Another 50 kb further up at position 50 (Fig. 4A), we
found a short alignment to the E(spl) bHLH domain.
However, there was no predicted gene, nor a start codon,
nor a WRPW motif. Nearby at position ~46 kb there is an
open reading frame of 133 residues split by one intron
that belongs to a predicted database gene consisting of
five exons (GENSCAN00000025907; black in Fig. 4C).
However, lacking any similarity to known genes of Apis or
other species, this gene remained without functional prediction in the Apis database. In agreement, our searches in
the FlyBase did not detect any similar sequences. However, we predict an E(spl) bHLH-type protein encoded by
this gene region: extension of the open reading frame into
the adjacent intron ends in WRPW (Fig. 4C, blue exons).
The bHLH encoding sequences (purple in Fig. 4C) are
located within the second predicted intron of the putative
gene shown in black. There are respective exon/intron
boundary consensus sequences to allow for a single transcript that contains the bHLH domain, an orange domain
and ends with the WRPW motif (Fig. 4C). This third E(spl)

Conservation of the Brd-family member Mα. A) Alignment of the presumptive Mα proteins of D. melanogaster, A. mellifera and A. gambiae. Although the alignment reveals not much identity (blue), the postulated features that typify Brd-proteins are
present [14]. Red, highly related and yellow, similar residues. B) Mα contains a typcial amphipathic α-helix with high concentration of lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues on one side of the wheel (red).

bHLH gene would comprise five exons. In fact, in the
update May 2005 of the Ensembl honeybee database, the
Ensembl automatic analysis pipeline predicts a very similar protein, however, with a different N-terminus and
slightly smaller third and fourth exons. This gene than
consists of four exons which would be similar to D. melanogaster hairy and dpn that contain two introns. However,
the encoded protein is most similar to the E(spl) protein
Mβ, so we call the gene A.m.mβ'. Since Apis hairy and dpn
are found elsewhere in the genome (see below), we propose that the E(spl)-C in Apis mellifera consists of the urcomplex plus two further E(spl) bHLH genes most closely

related to mγ and mβ. No other genes of the Drosophila
E(spl)-C are present in that of the honeybee. We find a
highly conserved Groucho ortholog, however, at a completely different position in the genome.
Conservation of other Hairy/E(spl)-like proteins known
from Drosophila
In total, 12 genes are known in D. melanogaster to encode
Hairy/E(spl)-like proteins, i.e. bHLH proteins that also
have the orange domain and a WRPW-type Gro-binding
motif (see Table 2). Apart from the seven E(spl) bHLH
proteins, these include Hairy, Deadpan, Side, Hey and

The E(spl)-C in Apis mellifera
Figure 4
The E(spl)-C in Apis mellifera. A) A genomic region spanning about 250 kb (GroupUn.159; numbers are correspondingly)
contains 3 presumptive E(spl) bHLH genes and one mα related gene. The gene at position ~250 kb encodes a bHLH protein
with best overall identity to D.m.Mβ. This gene is disrupted by an intron inside the bHLH domain (dash and red arrowhead in
B). Close by, at position 220 kb a mα related coding region is found. Based on high similarity to D.m.Mα and its close neighbourhood to A.m.mβ, we named it A.m.mα. A second intronless E(spl) like bHLH coding gene is located at position ~90 kb. We
name it A.m.mγ since the encoded protein shows best overall identity to the D.m.Mγ. Approximately 50 kb away we detected
sequences encoding an E(spl) like bHLH domain (A.m.Mβ') and a long open reading frame ending with a WRPW motif. The
Ensembl honeybee database annotated a gene with five introns spanning 12 kb within this region but missed the respective
motifs (GENSCAN00000025907). We propose a different gene structure; see Figure C for details. B) Alignment of the three
putative honeybee bHLH proteins (A.m.Mβ', A.m.Mβ, A.m.Mγ) with D. melanogaster Mβ and Mγ proteins is shown. Identical
residues are marked in blue; red shows highly related and yellow similar residues. Intron positions are marked with a triangle
above and a dash in the respective A. mellifera sequence. C) Structure of the 12 kb GENSCAN00000025907 region. Black
shows the Ensembl gene annotation, and blue the new ENSAPMG00000016895 annotation. Purple highlights a second exon
that encodes part of the bHLH domain, the open reading frame extends into the predicted intron of GENSCAN00000025907
and terminates with WRPW.

Her [34]. Moreover, there is similarity to Stich1/Sticky
which has a bHLH and an orange domain but not the typical Gro-binding motif [35]. Since the number of E(spl)
bHLH genes is not conserved in honeybee and mosquito,
it was interesting to ask whether all the other genes were
present. We searched the Ensembl database with the
respective D. melanogaster protein sequences and found
orthologs of all genes except of Her in both species (see
Table 2). However, most of the predictions are incomplete. We know from D. melanogaster that these genes contain introns, which complicates the search for potential
coding sequences within genomic DNA. Thus, our protein
sequence predictions are uncertain. With the sole exception of Dpn, all the proteins are better conserved between
Drosophila and Anopheles than between Drosophila and
Apis, confirming the evolutionary relationship. The best
conserved proteins are Hey and Hairy. The Hey orthologs
are 76% identical between Drosophila and Anopheles and
66% between Drosophila and Apis and the Hairy orthologs
between 72% and 65%, respectively. Less conservation is
found for Side, Dpn and Stich1 (62/57 Side, 57/59 Dpn
and 60/57 Stich1; % identity comparing fly with mosquito and honeybee, respectively). All proteins share the
bHLH and orange domains. The WRPW motif of Hairy,
Dpn and Side as well as the YRPW motif of Hey is present
in the orthologs.
The Achaete-Scute complex in Drosophilids
The Achaete-Scute complex (AS-C) is well conserved in D.
virilis: all four genes, achaete (ac), lethal of scute (l'sc), scute
(sc) and asense (ase) are found in the same order and orientation on the X-chromosome (Fig. 5A). Like in D. melanogaster, the genes are without introns. All proteins share
the typical bHLH motif of the AS-C proteins and this
domain reveals the lowest evolutionary rate. However,
compared with the bHLH proteins of the E(spl)-C the
bHLH proteins of the AS-C evolve faster. The complex can
be separated into two clusters that are distinguished by
their rate of conservation. On one hand, L'sc and Sc are
well conserved with an identity between D. melanogaster
and D. virilis of more than 75% and on the other hand Ac
and Ase with an identity of less than 69% (Fig. 5A). Note
that the highest divergence that was found between these
two species in the E(spl)-C was for M8 with still almost
81% identity.

Of the four AS-C gene members in D. melanogaster, ase
stands out because it is much larger than the other three.
In D. virilis, the size increase is even more striking: D.v.Ase
is predicted to comprise 619 residues, whereas D.m.Ase is
only 486 residues in length (Fig. 5B). This extension of
more than 20% additional residues is caused by multiple
insertions of repetitive sequences that code for polyglutamine (Q), poly-alanine (A) and poly-asparagine (N)
stretches (Fig. 5B). Like in D. melanogaster the unrelated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/67

gene pepsinogen-like (pcl) is located between l'sc and ase
(Fig. 5A).
The AS-C in Anopheles gambiae
In the mosquito, we find only two potential achaete-scute
like genes that are in close neighbourhood of less than 30
kb. Interestingly, like in Drosophila they are located on the
X-chromosome. One of them encodes a protein that is
very similar to L'sc and Sc proteins not only within the
bHLH domain but also at the C-terminus (Fig. 6A). This is
not unexpected because the C-terminus is involved in
transcriptional activation as well binding of E(spl) bHLH
proteins [36]. The BestFit program gives a higher score to
L'sc (64% identity) than to Sc (57% identity). However,
closer inspection reveals that some protein regions are
more similar to D.m.Sc and others more to D.m.L'sc (Fig.
6A) suggesting common ancestry for this gene pair. The
Anopheles data base predicts an intron, which however
retains the open reading frame. In fact, Wülbeck and
Simpson [37] cloned and sequenced the respective A.g.ash
cDNA and showed that it is intronless. We detected three
conservative amino acid exchanges between the published A.g.Ash protein sequence and that obtained from
translating the database genomic DNA, namely at position 8 (M-L), position 189 (T-S) and position 311 (Q-H).

The second presumptive gene has two predicted introns.
The derived amino acid sequence shares between 54%
and 57% identity with all four D. melanogaster AS-C proteins. By searching the D. melanogaster genome with the
predicted protein sequence, the best hit was found to Ase
protein (Fig. 6B). Accordingly, the Anopheles database
defined it as ase homolog and so we named it A.g.ase. We
note, however, that a precise appointment is difficult
based on the lack of a significant similarity at the C-terminus which normally allows the distinction between the
AS-C members.
The AS-C in honeybee
Like in the mosquito, the honeybee genome encodes only
two AS-C like proteins. The two transcription units are the
predicted Ensembl genes ENSAPMG00000003261 and
ENSAPMG00000003265 (Table 2). They are located in
the scaffold group 10.3 and are approximately 40 kb apart
from each other. The former encodes a protein that is
highly similar to the L'sc/Sc protein pair, so we named it
A.m.ash (Fig. 7A). In contrast to the Drosophila AS-C genes,
A.m.ash is predicted to contain a single intron which however, retains an open reading frame. Therefore, like in
mosquito the encoded protein could be significantly
larger. We thus aligned the protein sequences of A.m.Ash
with and without translation of the predicted intron with
D.m.L'sc (Fig. 7A). Since the open reading frame of the
presumptive intron is translated primarily into serine residues, no alignment with the D.m.L'sc protein was possi-

ble for this part, supporting the intron prediction. We
note that there are two more exon/intron boundary consensus sequences within the predicted intron (arrows in
Fig. 7A). If these were used instead of the ones predicted,
the intron would be somewhat smaller and A.m.Ash
accordingly 25 amino acids larger. As shown in Fig. 7A,
the resultant protein would be more similar in size to melanogaster L'sc protein and moreover, share additional similarities in this part of the protein. The Apis database does
not provide a start for A.m.Ash, which we could deduce
however from the alignment with the D. melanogaster protein.
Interpretation of the second gene is much more difficult.
The annotation by Ensembl automatic pipeline using
GeneWise model based on either protein or aligned EST's
resulted in a coding sequence within a single exon that
lacked both start and stop codons, however, aligned well
with AS-C bHLH domains. We thus extended our studies
into the surrounding genomic DNA, where we detected
one further open reading frame. The deduced amino acid
sequence matched well with the N-terminal part of D. melanogaster Ac and Ase proteins. However, the C-terminus
did not align convincingly (Fig. 7B/GW). Another gene
prediction using Chris Burge's Genscan program [38] gave
a transcript of 8 exons spanning over 8 kb of genomic
DNA. The translation gave a larger protein again without
start methionine that contained the single exon predicted
by the GenWise model (Fig. 7B/GS). Again there was very
little similarity in the C-terminal part of this and Drosophila AS-C proteins (Fig 7B). Because Genscan could not
predict the protein start, we propose a combination of
both models with the N-terminus as shown in the
A.m.Ase/GW sequence and the C-terminus as in A.m.Ase/
GS that might, however, end shorter than shown in Fig.
7B.
The high divergence from the Drosophila AS-C proteins
renders precise predictions very difficult. In fact, under
standard conditions like FlyBase BlastN only parts of the
bHLH domain can be identified. Comparison with the D.
melanogaster AS-C proteins gave minimally different
scores, with the highest score found with D.m.Ac followed
by D.m.Ase, dependent on the parameters. For example,
the Apis database finds best scores with melanogaster Sc
and L'sc. We named this gene A.m.ase by its similarity
notably in the N-terminal part and based on the arrangement of the mosquito AS-C.
Conservation of predicted regulatory elements in E(spl)-C
and AS-C
Neurogenesis in Drosophila is subjected to various levels of
regulation. As described in the introduction, E(spl) bHLH
proteins repress proneural gene activity. Negative regulation is brought about by repression of transcription as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/67

well as at the protein level [36,39-42]. A further mode of
regulation involves RNA:RNA duplexes [43]. These are
formed by small sequence stretches located in the 3'
untranslated region (3' UTR) of the mRNAs of proneural
AS-C genes and different members of the E(spl)-C. For
example, l'sc mRNA contains so-called proneural boxes
(PB-box) (GGAAGAC) which bind to the GY-boxes
(GUCUUCC) of E(spl) m4 RNA [43]. We searched the
genomic sequences adjacent to the coding sequences for
respective regulatory elements and found them in D. virilis: there are two PB boxes in D.v.l'sc and GY-boxes in the
3'UTR of the predicted virilis E(spl) genes m3, m4, m5 and
mγ just as in D. melanogaster and meanwhile published by
Lai et al. [33]. Moreover, it has been shown that E(spl)
genes are direct targets of the Notch signal involving the
DNA binding protein Su(H) [11,13,15,19]. Accordingly,
there are potential Su(H) binding sites (C/TGTGA/GGA)
in all D. melanogaster E(spl) genes including m2 and m6
[14,15], which are also present in the respective virilis
orthologs [44]. However, the predicted binding sites for
proneural bHLH activators (E box: GCAGGTG) [14] are
less well conserved during evolution. Whereas the D. virilis m2 and m4 orthologs contain such a regulatory element, we found no sequence fitting the E-box consensus
in either the D.v.m6 or D.v.mα sequence.
In mosquito and honeybee, regulatory elements of
RNA:RNA duplex-type were not detected. None of the two
AS-C genes of either Apis or Anopheles contained PB-box
like sequences in the 3' UTR, albeit the highly diverged
sequence and gene structure of A.g.ase does not allow to
definitely exclude their presence. Since there is no predicted m4 ortholog in Anopheles and Apis, we looked at the
3' end of the mα gene as the single Brd-family member.
However, in none of these gene sequences did we find GY
type boxes like in Drosophila. We note that some of the
predicted gene structures are still incomplete and a search
for small sequence stretches is notoriously difficult if one
allows for variations. Therefore, there is the formal possibility that we have missed these sites.

Discussion
The Enhancer of split complex
Extensive genome analyses in the recent years revealed
that there are not many examples of large gene complexes
that are widely conserved. Prominent examples are the
HOX (homeobox) complexes, which contain homeotic
genes in Drosophila. HOX complexes are well conserved in
metazoans despite some variations in gene number.
HOX-genes encode regulatory proteins with specific individual functions and mutations affect different aspects of
the body plan [45]. Not surprisingly, it is almost only the
homeodomain, which serves as sequence-specific DNA
binding motif that is conserved amongst different species
[46]. In contrast, similarity amongst bHLH proteins

duplication events. The D. melanogaster proteins M8/M5
and Mβ/M3 are most similar with over 70% identity,
whereas Mδ is the most diverged. However, Mδ still shares
at least 50% identity with other E(spl) bHLH protein
members (see pair wise comparison in the identity matrix
of Mδ with M8, M5 and M3; Table 1). More interesting is
the analysis of the overall similarity amongst these proteins. Here, any one of the proteins is compared with the
other six and the result is averaged. Clearly, Mβ (73/64%,
similarity/identity) closely followed by Mγ (72/63%) is
most similar to all others, whereas Mδ (66/55%) shows
the lowest values (Table 1). One interpretation might be
that the different bHLH genes evolved by duplication out
of mβ or mγ. Remarkably, these two bHLH proteins
besides M3 are the best conserved in the three Drosophila
species (Fig. 1A). We would like to postulate that these are
the most ancient proteins with the most general function

and, therefore, the highest selection pressure. This
hypothesis is supported by the finding that mβ has the
most general expression pattern from which the others
can be derived by a decrease of gene activity [19]. The conspicuous conservation of M3 might hint to an important
function during egg development as this gene is expressed
also maternally [17,22]. The high degree of conservation
of all E(spl) bHLH orthologous proteins in Drosophilids,
which is clearly higher than the similarity within this protein family in D. melanogaster, indicates specific and nonredundant roles during development (see also [23]).
Some of these functions have been identified in the past
[19,39]. It is conceivable that regulatory sequences were
not duplicated or evolved more rapidly so that we now
find highly dynamic expression patterns of these genes.
The ancestral E(spl)-C is composed of mβ and mα
As outlined above, mβ appears to be the ancestral bHLH
gene of the E(spl)-C in Drosophilids based on its great

The AS-C
The AS-C of D. virilis. A) The AS-C is highly conserved between D. melanogaster and D. virilis concerning gene number, transcript orientation and overall size. At the protein level (% identity) the best conservation is found between the Sc and L'sc
orthologs. However, the conservation rate is lower compared with the E(spl) bHLH proteins (see Fig. 1). The pcl gene,
although only 50.4% identical, is found between l'sc and ase. Because of gaps in the genomic virilis sequence, a scheme of the D.
melanogaster complex is shown. B) Alignment of the Ase protein orthologs of D. melanogaster and D. virilis. Note the extension
of the D.v.Ase protein by repetitive amino acid stretches composed of poly N, poly Q and poly A. The best conservation is
found within the bHLH domain (purple). Identical residues are marked in blue; red shows highly related and yellow similar residues.

The AS-C in A. gambiae
Figure 6
The AS-C in A. gambiae. A) Alignment of the achaete-scute homologous protein of A. gambiae (A.g.Ash; [36]) with melanogaster L'sc and Sc proteins. Note the high conservation of the bHLH domain (purple) and the very C-terminus. Comparison
over the entire length gives a higher identity score to D.m.L'sc, however, the alignment shows also regions that are more similar to D.m.Sc. B) Alignment of the neighbouring bHLH gene product from A. gambiae with D. melanogaster Ase. The alignment
is shown to A.g.Ase/i (database predicted version without intron) and A.g.Ase (second intron translated). The second predicted intron comprises almost 2.5 kb and ends with an exon translated into five residues (CSPTH; in A.g.Ase/i). Translation
into this intron leads to A.g.Ase that is similar in size and in its terminus to D.m.Ase. Highest conservation is found in the
bHLH domain (purple). Identical residues are marked in blue; red shows highly related and yellow similar residues.

The AS-C in A. mellifera. A) Comparison of D.m.L'sc with the predicted A.m.Ash protein. Two forms were compared, without intron sequence, A.m.Ash/i, and with translated intron, A.m.Ash. Arrows mark additional splice consensus sites. B) Within
40 kb of A.m.ash, there is a second potential gene encoding a widely diverged bHLH protein. Two different programs were
used for gene prediction that gives A.m.Ase/GS (Chris Burge's Genscan program) and A.m.Ase/GW (GeneWise model); both
predicted proteins were aligned with D.m.Ase. Decent conservation is only found in the putative bHLH domains (purple). Identical residues are marked in blue; red shows highly related and yellow similar residues.

similarity with all the other bHLH proteins. This assumption is strongly supported by the sequence conservation of
the E(spl) bHLH proteins in A. gambiae and A. mellifera.
The single E(spl) bHLH protein encoded by the mosquito
genome has the highest identity to Mβ. The genome of
honeybee contains three prospective genes that encode
proteins most highly related to E(spl) D.m.Mβ and
D.m.Mγ. All three are clustered within a single sequence
contig, albeit they span a large segment of about 250 kb,
whereas the whole E(spl)-C in D. melanogaster comprises
roughly 50 kb. Despite the fact that two of these genes
possess introns just within the bHLH domain and at positions close to the ones found in the D. melanogaster genes
dpn, hairy or Her (Figs. 4, 8), the amino acid sequence similarity classifies them clearly as E(spl) bHLH proteins. A
comparison of Anopheles and Apis proteins reveals, that
the presumptive Mβ homologs have highest similarity
(83%) and identity (76%), whereas the protein that we
classified as A.m.Mγ is just 70% similar and 66% identical
to A.g.Mβ.
In Drosophilids, mα is located close to mβ and is transcribed in the opposite direction (head to head; Fig. 1A).
This arrangement is likewise found in Anopheles and Apis
(Figs. 2A, 4A). Notably, A.m.mα is next to A.m.mβ,
whereas the two Apis A.m.mγ and A.m.mβ' genes are much
further apart (Fig. 4). We find this arrangement to be very
ancient. In the beetle Tribolium, which on the tree of evolution is found even more deeply rooted (~300 Myr to
Dipterans [32]), two similar genes coding for Mβ-like proteins (~65% and ~67% identity to D.m.Mβ) are found
and one is within ~18 kb to a gene coding for an Mα-like
protein (~52% identity to D.m.Mα) (unpublished data
derived from the Tribolium database). We postulate that
the ur-complex consisted of these two ancestral genes, mα
and mβ. It is intriguing that they belong to the two different classes of Notch-responsive genes in the E(spl)-C, the
bHLH and the Brd-class. In the fly, mα and bHLH genes
are similarly expressed [14,15,22]. It is not unlikely that
they share common regulatory elements that could
explain their co-segregation in the process of evolution.
What about the third bHLH coding gene found in Apis,
A.m.mβ'? This gene may have derived by duplication of
A.m.mβ or of A.m.mγ. It is peculiar that this protein is
more similar to D. melanogaster Mβ protein than to either
A.m.Mβ or A.g.Mβ (see Table 3). In contrast, A.m.Mγ is
more similar to A.m.Mβ than to A.m.Mβ'. Furthermore
this gene has three introns; one of them is larger than 4 kb
reminiscent of Drosophila hairy or dpn intron sizes. We
think that it is unlikely that A.m.mβ' encodes one of the
other Hairy/E(spl)-type proteins since respective
orthologs were found in the A. mellifera genome with the
exception of Her, which seems also absent from the mosquito genome. However, there are similarities between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/67

the A.m.Mβ' and D. melanogaster Her proteins, including
one intron which is at a similar position (Fig. 8B).
Although highly speculative, one might conclude that the
Drosophila Her gene originally derived from an ancient
E(spl) bHLH type gene. However, this speculation has to
be proved or disproved by further investigations. The fact
that the positions of the introns of Drosophila dpn and
hairy are identical and the introns in A.m.mγ and A.m.mβ'
are at very similar positions (Fig. 8) supports the notion of
a common ancestry of these genes.
The Achaete-Scute complex
Genes related to achaete or scute have been identified in a
large number of species, from hydra [47] to mouse [30],
and so we expect these also in the different insects. The
AS-C was most intensely studied in various species of
Schizophora flies, apart from Drosophila [28,37,48-53]. The
number of genes varies between one and four, however, is
not strictly correlated with the position in the phylogenetic tree. For example, AS-C of Calliphora vicina contains
three genes, whereas other dipteran flies like Drosophila
contain four. Two genes are found in the branchiopod
crustacean Triops longicaudatus [54] and only one in hydra
[47]. In Dipteran flies the expression patterns of the
proneural genes are largely varied. This is regulated by
positional information through the Iroquois Complex and
pannier and in addition by a transcriptional feed-back
loop involving AS-C proteins. Eventually, neural precursors are selected by the repressive activity of E(spl) bHLH
proteins [55,56]. Thereby, location and number of the
large bristles on the notum is precisely controlled. The
mosquito is covered with rows of large sensory bristle,
where number and position varies between individuals
[57]. This is in accordance with the fact that there is only
one scute-like gene, A.g.ash that is expressed all over the
presumptive notum in a modular pattern [37]. Recently it
was shown that the Anopheles A.g.ash gene can mimic the
endogenous Drosophila genes and that overexpression
leads to many ectopic bristles [37].

Albeit the bristle pattern on the notum of different Drosophilids varies slightly, bristle number and position is
highly stereotyped [58]. Therefore, it is not surprising to
find the AS-C highly conserved within Drosophilids. Yet,
the rate of change came unexpected and is quite remarkable outside of the bHLH domain. Compared to E(spl)
bHLH proteins, those encoded by AS-C have a rather low
degree of similarity, most notably Ac. In fact, the big flesh
fly Calliphora vicina, which like Drosophila belongs to the
Schizophora, is totally lacking the ac gene and is covered
with bristles [51]. In agreement, we were unable to find ac
in Anopheles or Apis, arguing for rapid evolution. The best
conservation rate is found in Sc and L'sc suggesting high
evolutionary pressure and maybe common ancestry. Not
only the bHLH domain, but also two small stretches out-

side (aa 203; SPTPS in D. melanogaster L'sc) and also the
C-terminus are of high similarity, the latter found identical in Calliphora [51]. Presumably these protein domains
are of functional importance. Indeed, the C-terminus acts
as transcriptional activation domain and is also used to
recruit E(spl) bHLH proteins [36]. Although the alignments of the respective genes of honeybee and mosquito
to sc and l'sc are very similar, the tendency goes to a closer
relationship to l'sc. However, we propose that this gene
pair arose by duplication in the course of Drosophilid
evolution, such that we may be looking at a common
ancestor in the other two species.
The rate of conservation is very limited for the Ase
homologs. Decent conservation is found within the
bHLH domain, and moreover, a further well-conserved
box is present (NGxQYxRIPGTNTxQxL; x are differences
between A. gambiae and D. melanogaster). This sequence is
likewise detected in the Ase protein of C. vicina, which
however shares many more similarities with D.m.Ase
[51]. In Apis, there is no such conservation outside of the
bHLH domain, which itself is highly diverged. The overall
degree of conservation is so poor that further statements
about the relationship are difficult. We argue that this
gene represents A.m.ase by its close proximity to A.m.ash,
although other interpretations are similarly possible. An
analysis of its expression pattern in honeybee may help to
solve these questions.

Conclusion
We aimed towards an understanding of the evolution of
E(spl)-C and AS-C complexes which in D. melanogaster
comprise genes of apparent redundant functions. Our
analysis covered insect species that belong to the orders
Hymenoptera (honeybee) and Diptera and there to the
suborders Nematocera (mosquito) and Brachycera (three
species of the genus Drosophila) and thus spans an about
300 Myr window of evolution. We find that both E(spl)-C
and AS-C expanded rather recently as they are only
present in their nowadays complex structures in Drosophilids. In Apis and in Anopheles, we find very similar

arrangements indicative of an ancient ur-complex. The
E(spl)-C seems to have evolved from two genes, one HESlike and one Brd-like gene that are arranged in a head to
head orientation. Both types of genes are responsive to
Notch signalling in Drosophila. Our data suggest that the
most ancient genes are E(spl) bHLH mβ and E(spl) mα
from which the other E(spl)-C genes derived by duplication and subsequent change. Moreover, an E(spl) ur-complex is likewise detected in Tribolium castaneum that
belongs to the order Coleoptera. In Drosophila the complex also gained unrelated genes like m1 and gro. The latter
is highly conserved, however, located at different genomic
positions. Whereas in Anopheles the ur-complex seems to
exist in its original form, two additional mβ-like bHLH
genes are found in the Apis genome that possess introns.
These introns are at similar positions as the introns of two
other HES-like genes, dpn and h which themselves are
highly conserved in the three insect species, arguing for a
common evolutionary history. Presumably, the introns
are evolutionarily ancient as they are also found in the C.
elegans E(spl)/h like gene lin-22. The AS-C seems to originate from a single sc/l'sc like bHLH gene and a second
largely diverged bHLH gene that shares similarity with
Drosophila ase. The high degree of variation in the latter
makes it difficult to conclusively decide on the original
arrangement of this gene complex.

Methods
Databases
Drosophila melanogaster gene and protein sequences were
accessed in FlyBase [31]. The D. pseudoobscura database is
found at the Human Genome Sequencing Center [59].
The genome of D. virilis is sequenced by Agencourt Bioscience Corporation and can be downloaded [60] or
searched [61]. The Apis mellifera and Anopheles gambiae
databases can be accessed with the Ensembl genome
browser [62]. The honeybee genomic sequence is also
available at the Human Genome Sequencing Center [59]
and the EST sequences were obtained from the honeybee
brain EST project [63]. Table 2 lists accession numbers of
genes, contig numbers and positions of genes therein as

Page 17 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:67

well as accession numbers to gene predictions. Due to
updates of the databases, gene annotation and names may
be different now than reported here.
Sequence analysis
Sequences were downloaded and further studied applying
the HUSAR programs of the Deutsche Krebsforschungszentrum [64,65]. Genomic DNA was translated with
MAP. BESTFIT and GAP programs were used for alignments and calculation of similarity and identity scores.
DOMAIN SWEEP was applied to define bHLH and orange
domains, respectively. The amphipathic α-helices were
predicted and drawn using WHEEL.
D. pseudoobscura sequence acquisition
The annotation of the D. pseudoobscura database is well
advanced. TBlastN searches starting from FlyBase [31] or
using D. melanogaster genes allow easy access to both
E(spl)-C and AS-C gene complexes. The database also
gives information on transcript length, structure and orientation.
D. virilis sequence acquisition
Searches were done with BlastN. However, the D. virilis
database allows this scan only with DNA against DNA. We
therefore searched first for a characteristic part of a D. melanogaster gene (i.e. the bHLH domain) using lowest percent identity option (75% identity) to find the respective
virilis ortholog. We then used the FIND program to identify the respective contig containing these sequences
within the downloaded genomic sequence. Subsequently,
the entire contig was translated in all six possible reading
frames and manually analysed for E(spl)-C and AS-C
genes and proteins. The complete E(spl)-C was located in
one contig. To identify the whole sequence of the AS-C,
three overlapping contigs had to be investigated. However, the contigs covering the AS-C still contained many
large unsequenced or uncertain stretches. Therefore, the
exact size of the complex could not be defined. The
sequence gaps do not affect the coding sequences of the
studied genes.
A. gambiae and A. mellifera sequence acquisition
The other databases were screened with D. melanogaster
protein sequences for members of E(spl)-C and AS-C
against genomic DNA. After detecting convincing similarities, the surrounding genomic DNA was downloaded for
further studies with the HUSAR programs. Most of the
genes that we describe here have also been annotated as
transcribed regions. However, the majority of the database predictions were either incomplete or inconsistent.
For our predictions, we carefully analysed genomic DNA
and possible coding sequences. All six reading frames
were searched for bHLH domain sequences and in the
case of the E(spl)-C bHLH proteins also for WRPW motifs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/67

Predicted introns were scanned for open reading frames
and their borders reinvestigated. Exon/intron boundaries
were defined by obeying to the GT AG rule. Afterwards it
was analysed whether the newly predicted introns affected
the open reading frame.
Classification of gene homology
Gene homology and orthology was classified based on
sequence identity with the respective D. melanogaster protein. In the studied Drosophila species all analysed genes
have been identified in a 1:1 ratio and could therefore be
classified as orthologs. The degree of similarity and identity between two related proteins was determined with the
BestFit program [64]. Comparison of proteins from the
three Drosophila species was done under the pre-configured standard conditions of the program (Gap weight: 8,
length weight: 2). A TBlastN search in the Apis and Anopheles databases always returned several sequences, and we
analysed up to 15 of the best hits. If the hit was in a region
without predicted gene, we translated the respective
sequence and analysed the open reading frames manually. They were analysed for expected protein motifs, like
bHLH, orange or WRPW domain. The predicted protein
sequences were then used for a BlastP search in FlyBase. In
case of a 1:1 relationship, the genes were classified as
orthologs. Since there are several E(spl)-C bHLH and ASC bHLH genes in Drosophila, a 1:1 allocation was not possible, therefore, we classified them as homolog (see
results). Protein sequences derived from the Apis or
Anopheles genome projects are so diverged, that standard
conditions only align the best conserved domains. We
therefore changed the conditions to Gap weight: 1, length
weight: 1, max. penalized length: 30. These relaxed conditions had little influence on either alignment of well-conserved sequences, the similarity or identity values. For
example, the D.m.Mβ and D.v.Mβ orthologs share 89%
identity under stringent conditions versus 93% identity
under relaxed conditions. The reduced stringency however, allowed an alignment of the entire protein sequence
also of the diverged proteins with the consequence that
the identity values increased considerably compared to
standard conditions. For example an alignment of A.g.Ash
(371 residues) with D.m.L'sc (257 residues) under standard conditions aligns only the residues A.g.Ash 50–233
with D.m.L'sc 40–218 with an identity of 46%. Under
relaxed conditions the whole protein sequences align with
64% identity.
