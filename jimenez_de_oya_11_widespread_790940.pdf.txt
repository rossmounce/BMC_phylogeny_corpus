Abstract
Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a serious health problem in developing countries and is also
increasingly reported in industrialized regions. HEV is considered a zoonotic agent and strains isolated from swine
and human sources are genetically similar. Thus, HEV is of increasing importance to both public and animal health.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the distribution of HEV in a large population of pigs from herds
located in different autonomous regions throughout Spain.
Results: The presence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies was analyzed in 1141 swine serum samples (corresponding to
381 pigs younger than 6 months and 760 pigs older than 6 months) collected from 85 herds. Herds were located
in 6 provinces in 4 autonomous regions throughout Spain. At least one pig tested positive for anti-HEV IgG in over
80% of herds. Of individual pigs, 20.4% (233/1141) were positive for anti-HEV IgG, with the prevalence being higher
in adult pigs than in those under 6 months (30.2% vs. 15.5%). A subset of serum samples taken at 2- to 5-week
intervals showed that seroprevalence dropped between 3 and 11 weeks of age, and then rose significantly by the
15th week. Pigs were also examined for the presence of HEV-RNA by RT-PCR. Of pigs tested for the presence of
HEV-RNA 18.8% (64/341) were positive, with at least one pig in almost half of the herds testing positive. HEV-RNA
amplicons from several positive pigs were sequenced and all were of genotype 3.
Conclusions: HEV was found to be widely distributed among swine farms across Spain, with the prevalence being
highest among animals older than 6 months. These results indicate that HEV infection either is or is likely to
become endemic in the Spanish swine population.

Background
Hepatitis E is an enterically transmitted disease caused by
the hepatitis E virus (HEV). It was first detected in tropical and subtropical areas with poor sanitary conditions
and inadequate water supplies, where it is considered
endemic [1-3]. Although only a single serotype is recognized, considerable genetic diversity has been observed
among HEV isolates, which are grouped into four genotypes (gt). Viruses responsible for epidemics and sporadic
cases in endemic regions are mainly classified into gt 1
and 2, and those detected in sporadic cases of acute
hepatitis E elsewhere in the world are classified into gt 3
and 4 [1-3].
In non-endemic regions, where outbreaks have not
been described, the disease accounts for only a minority

of reported cases of acute viral hepatitis. Until recently,
most of these cases were considered to be imported by
travellers to HEV-endemic areas. However, in recent
years, an increasing number of sporadic cases related to
autochthonous transmission of HEV have been recorded
in the USA, Europe, and developed countries of the AsiaPacific region, in all of which it is considered an emerging disease [4]. In contrast to what is seen in endemic
areas, these indigenous infections are mainly caused by gt
3 strains.
Pigs are a recognized reservoir for HEV [1,5,6] and a
possible source of HEV transmission to human beings
[1-4,7], highlighting the potential of HEV as a zoonotic
pathogen. Indeed, HEV seems to be an enzootic infection
in pigs as shown by the high prevalence rates of anti-HEV
antibodies and HEV-RNA detected in them. Furthermore,
human and pig HEV sequences, especially those from
nearby geographical areas, have been found to be quite

similar or even identical [8]. Recently, several studies have
described a relationship between HEV infection and occupational exposure to pigs, such as in farmers, veterinarians,
butchers, or slaughterhouse workers, in which the number
of acute hepatitis E cases and seroprevalence rates seems
to be higher than in non-exposed populations [1,9,10]. In
addition, human HEV infection via the consumption of
contaminated pork products has also been reported
[11,12].
Since the first detection of HEV in pigs in 1997 [13],
the virus has been identified on swine farms from many
geographical areas, including Europe. However, the
reported prevalence has been quite variable, from 22%
to 55% [1,14-16], and although pigs aged 2-4 months
seem to be more susceptible to the infection [15,17-19],
HEV RNA has also been detected in finishers and breeders [20].
Porcine production in Spain, with more than 25 million pigs, is the second highest in the European Union
with an annual economic impact in excess of 4 million
Euros [21]. There is evidence of the presence of HEV in
the country in what seems to be some autochthonous
human cases [22-25], as well as in wild boars [20,26]
and pigs [20], in which the virus has been present since
at least 1985 [27].
In this study, the presence of both anti-HEV antibodies and HEV-RNA has been analyzed in a large population of pigs from herds located in different autonomous
regions across Spain, establishing that the virus is indeed
distributed among the Spanish swine population.

Results
Distribution of HEV in Spain

A total of 233 of the 1141 (20.4%) serum samples tested
resulted positive for anti-HEV IgG (Table 1). There were
seropositive adult and young pigs in all Spanish autonomous regions and provinces covered by the study. Analysis of the seroprevalence by province revealed a
significantly unequal distribution, ranging between 2.5%
and 26.4%, and these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001). However, no geographical relationship
was found regarding the seroprevalence rates. For
instance, neighbouring provinces such as Lerida and

Huesca (Figure 1) showed uneven seroprevalences, and
similar patterns were also observed in farms located
within a single province (data not shown).
At least one pig tested positive for anti-HEV IgG in
most of the herds tested (81.2%, 69/85), the percentage
of positive farms varying between 79.2% and 100%
among provinces (data not shown). Likewise, the proportion of tested pigs with anti-HEV IgG among positive farms was also quite variable, from 3% to 100%.
Seroprevalence analysis by age

A statistically significantly higher proportion of positive
animals was found in adult pigs than in those under 6
months of age (30.2% vs. 15.5%, p < 0.001) (Table 1). The
percentage of positive adults and young pigs varied from
4.8% to 37% and from 0% to 20%, respectively, depending
on the province studied, but it was always higher in
adults, these differences being statistically significant in
animals from Teruel and Saragossa provinces.
Samples were taken from young swine from 13 herds
from four autonomous regions at 2 to 5 week intervals.
As shown in Table 2, the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG
varies significantly (p < 0.001). The prevalence of positive
pigs dropped from age 3 to 11 weeks (6.9% to 1.4%) and
then rose significantly by the 15 th week (31.0%), then
attaining values similar to those found overall (30.2%) in
the adult swine population studied (Table 1).
Presence of HEV-RNA in sera

341 serum samples from 72 herds from Aragon (30 farrow-to-finish and 42 grower/fattener farms) were also
examined for the presence of HEV-RNA by RT-PCR
(Table 3). A total of 64 pigs (18.8%) were HEV-RNA
positive, the proportion of positive animals being significantly higher among pigs younger than 6 months of age
than among those older than 6 months (25.7% vs. 13.9%,
p = 0.006). At least one pig in almost half of the herds
(47.2%) tested positive for HEV-RNA, with more positive
pigs on farrow-to-finish than on grower/fattener farms
(60% vs. 38.1%), although in this case the difference was
not statistically significant (p = 0.066).
When HEV-RNA and anti-HEV IgG data were combined in the aforementioned subset of sera samples

(Table 4), it was shown that almost half of the pigs
(48.4%) did not present any marker of HEV infection. In
12% of them HEV-RNA, but not anti-HEV IgG, was
detected; whilst both markers were present in 6.7% of
the animals. Finally, evidence of a past infection was
observed in 32.8% of the animals, since no HEV-RNA
could be detected but they had anti-HEV IgG in sera.

Phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic analyses showed that all sequenced samples belong to gt 3 (Figure 2). Genetic distance between
them varied from 0% to 8%, which is a similar range to
those in previously reported gt 3 European (0-9%) and
Asian (13-21%) sequences, but lower than that found
when compared with strains from gt 1, 2 or 4 (23-33%).

Discussion
The prevalence of anti-HEV antibodies detected in the
large number of pigs from throughout Spain analyzed in
this report (20.4%, 233/1441) confirms the findings of
previous studies conducted in a more limited number of
animals across Europe that had suggested a widespread
distribution of the virus among the swine population of
the continent [15,28,29]. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the proportions of positive
animals found in the different regions analyzed, irrespective of the number of pigs raised there (Table 1).
Although previous studies of a limited number of pigs
carried out in the north-east of Spain [27,30] have
reported slightly higher figures, it should be noted that a
very wide distribution of HEV in swine herds has been
reported around the world [1].
At least one pig tested positive for anti-HEV IgG in
over 80% (69/85) of herds, although the prevalence was
again quite variable between farms and locations, as
reported before in other countries [1]. These differences
could be due, at least partially, to the different farming
structure of pig production, the routine management and
hygiene practices applied on these farms, as well as the
methods used in the different reports.
The proportion of anti-HEV IgG positive animals was
always higher among adults (30.2%) than in those under 6
months of age (15.5%) in all the provinces considered.
Further studies of the presence of specific antibodies in
sera collected at different weeks of age in 13 farms located
in different provinces across the country showed that 6.9%
of the tested animals were positive by age three weeks,

with only 1.4% positive at 11 weeks, rising to 30% at 15
weeks. These data are in line with those recently reported
from other studies [31,32] and are consistent with the natural infection of pigs aged around 10 to 12 weeks [1].
Maternal antibodies to HEV might persist up to 9 weeks
of age [1] and confer resistance to viral infection in young
pigs, which may explain the decrease in the number of
animals with specific IgG found here 3 weeks after birth.
On the other hand, the observed increase in the number
of IgG positive animals older than 3 months probably
reflects how the proportion of pigs with positive serology
rises once maternal immunity fades away. This conclusion
is also supported by the higher proportion of pigs younger
than 6 weeks of age in which HEV-RNA was detected by
RT-PCR, as previously observed [1,14,15,30].
Of pigs tested for the presence of HEV-RNA, 18.8%
(64/341) were positive, with at least one pig in almost
half of the herds testing positive, indicating that HEV
infection is indeed widespread among herds throughout
Spain. Consistent with the above findings, HEV-RNA
was more frequently detected in farms growing pigs
younger than 6 weeks of age; however, the proportion of
positive pigs in individual farms was again variable.
Almost half of the 341 pigs tested did not present antiHEV IgG or HEV-RNA in sera, whilst both markers were
detected in 6.7% of the cases. This could be due to either
a recent infection, a re-infection caused by a short protective immunity, or even to the establishment of a persistent infection [31,33].
A significantly higher proportion of HEV-RNA positive
pigs was found among young pigs (25.7% vs. 13.9%) and
all sequenced samples belonged to gt3, confirming that
HEV infection is more frequent in young swine and that
gt3 is highly prevalent in European pigs [1].
On the other hand, the data reported here imply that
adult animals also become infected by HEV [31], which
therefore means that infected pigs can enter into the
slaughterhouse and thereby the food-chain. In fact, HEVRNA has been detected in raw pig livers sold in local markets in the Netherlands, U.S.A., Korea, India and Japan
[12,34-37] and infection of slaughterhouse workers has
also been reported recently [24]. Infected pigs have a

Conclusions
In conclusion, the results obtained here in a large number of animals show that HEV is widely distributed
among swine farms (over 80% had at least one anti-HEV
IgG positive animal) and pigs (20.4%, had anti-HEV IgG
in sera) throughout Spain, there being a higher prevalence among animals older than 6 months. In addition,
HEV-RNA was detected in 18.8% of the tested sera and
in almost half of the herds, confirming that the infection
is currently active in the swine population These results
indicate that HEV infection either already is, or is likely
to become, endemic in the Spanish swine population.

341 serum samples from 201 adults and 140 young pigs
from 72 herds. To this purpose, total RNA was extracted
from 140 μl of swine sera using QIAamp®Viral RNA mini
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Nested reverse transcription
PCR (nested-RT-PCR) was performed with 10 μl of isolated RNA using a commercial amplification kit (SuperScript™ One-Step RT-PCR, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as
previously described [13], with outer primers 3156F
(AATTATGCCCAGTACCGGGTTG) and 3157R2 (TCATAGTCTTGTATAACCACACG), and inner primers
3158F2 (TGGTCATGCTTTGTATTCATGG) and 3159R
(AGCCGACGAAATCAATTCTGTC). Amplified products of 349 bp were identified by electrophoresis in a 2%
agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. An HEV-RNA
positive sample [20], kindly provided by Dr. M.T. PérezGracia, U. Cardenal Herrera-CEU, Valencia, Spain, was
always included in the assays.

transient viremia lasting 1-2 weeks and shed the virus in
faeces for about 3-7 weeks, making this a very important
issue, since food quality and human health in general may
be affected.

As part of a large project carried out in Spain to assess the
prevalence of different porcine pathogens, 1141 randomly
selected swine serum samples, 760 from adults (aged 6
months or more) and 381 from young pigs (aged less than
6 months), were included in this study. Samples (14 per
farm, on average) were collected from 85 pig farms located
in six provinces in four autonomous regions of Spain
(Figure 1). Two of them, Aragon and Catalonia, raise a
high proportion of the Spanish swine population, 21.8%
and 26.2%, respectively, while in the other two (Castile
and Leon and Andalusia) the swine population is much
lower, 5.7% and 8.3% of the total, respectively [21]. In
three regions (Castile and Leon, Andalusia and Catalonia)
all farms were located in the same province (Salamanca,
Jaen and Lerida, respectively); while in Aragon farms were
located in three different provinces (Huesca, Saragossa
and Teruel). Additionally, in a subset of 620 young pigs
from 13 of these farms, located in the four autonomous
regions, blood samples were taken at week intervals (3, 5,
7, 11, 15 and 20 weeks of age). Random samples (7 to 10
animals per sampling time point) were collected, so that
although they may not have corresponded to the same
animals, they always came from animals from the same
farm. Experiments were approved and performed according to the guidelines for animal experimentation of the
Animal Safety Committee of our Institution.
Assessment of HEV infection

Serum samples were tested for the presence of specific
anti-HEV IgG antibodies by means of an ELISA based on
a recombinant HEV gt 3 ORF-2 antigen expressed in Trichoplusia ni larvae that was shown to be highly specific
and sensitive when compared with a widely used commercial kit [38,39]. Detection of HEV-RNA was conducted on

Statistical and epidemiological analyses

Prevalence was calculated as apparent prevalence, i.e.,
the ratio of positive results to the total number of samples. Proportions were compared using Chi-square test
(or Fisher’s exact test when appropiate). Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 15.0 for Windows and
