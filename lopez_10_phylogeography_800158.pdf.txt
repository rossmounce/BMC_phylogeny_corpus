Pacific Sierra mackerel (Scomberomorus sierra) in
the Eastern Pacific

Abstract
Background: Testing connectivity among populations of exploited marine fish is a main concern for the development
of conservation strategies. Even though marine species are often considered to display low levels of population
structure, barriers to dispersal found in the marine realm may restrict gene flow and cause genetic divergence of
populations. The Pacific Sierra mackerel (Scomberomorus sierra) is a pelagic fish species distributed throughout the
tropical and subtropical waters of the eastern Pacific. Seasonal spawning in different areas across the species range, as
well as a limited dispersal, may result in a population genetic structure. Identification of genetically discrete units is
important in the proper conservation of the fishery.
Results: Samples collected from the Eastern Pacific, including the areas of main abundance of the species, presented
high levels of mtDNA genetic diversity and a highly significant divergence. At least two genetically discrete groups
were detected in the northern (Sinaloa) and central areas (Oaxaca and Chiapas) of the species range, exhibiting slight
genetic differences with respect to the samples collected in the southern region (Peru), together with a "chaotic
genetic patchiness" pattern of differentiation and no evidence of isolation by distance. Historical demographic
parameters supported the occurrence of past population expansions, whereas the divergence times between
populations coincided with the occurrence of glacial maxima some 220 000 years ago.
Conclusions: The population genetic structure detected for the Pacific Sierra mackerel is associated with a limited
dispersal between the main abundance areas that are usually linked to the spawning sites of the species. Population
expansions have coincided with glacial-interglacial episodes in the Pleistocene, but they may also be related to the
increase in the SST and with upwelling areas in the EEP since the early Pleistocene.
Background
The definition of factors that determine genetic divergence in populations from marine ecosystems has
become a subject of interest for evolutionary biology and
conservation. The subdivision of populations in an apparently homogeneous environment has been found to be
complex [1]. Evolutionary divergence processes in the
marine realm are thought to have minor effects on species with long-lived pelagic eggs and larvae, and/or on
those that have a significant capacity to disperse through
migrations, as well as large effective population sizes. For

many marine species, dispersal mediated by larval drift
promotes their range expansion as well as a mixing of
populations [2]. Likewise, the effects of genetic drift may
be imperceptible in species with large effective population sizes [3]. Consequently, most marine species, especially pelagic species, are widely distributed with patterns
that vary from disjunct to circumtropical [4]. However,
larval duration and adult vagility may vary considerably
among species, and determine the extent of gene flow [5].
Moreover, mesoscale physical events such as upwelling,
jets, gyres, tides and fronts may affect larval dispersal and
act as temporary barriers to genetic exchange through
larval retention [1]. As a result of this, pelagic species may
display a weak genetic structure [6].

tropical waters along the North, Central and South
American Pacific coast. Mackerels are a diversified group
consisting of 18 species distributed across the continental
margins of every ocean [7]. Reported also are the sister
species S. concolor confined to the Gulf of California in
the Pacific, and S. sierra that is widely distributed along
the eastern Pacific coast [7]. Although information on the
biology of the Pacific Sierra mackerel is scarce, spawning
seems to be influenced by sea surface temperatures during Spring and Summer. It takes place in geographically
distinct regions that include the area off the Mexican
mainland from July to September [8], in Costa Rica from
late August to November, and in Colombia from November to April. Klawe [9] reported that spawning takes place
from December to April in the lower latitudes of the Eastern Pacific. Asynchronous spawning in distant areas may
result in the isolation of populations, and thus promote
the formation of discrete genetic populations. Larvae of
Scomberomorus species have been found to have a short
larval period (8.3-9.1 days) [10]. Dispersal is moderate in
the early stages of its life cycle and seems to be associated
with feeding and spawning activities.
Population genetic studies on pelagic species in the
eastern Pacific have reported some extent of population
subdivision. Examples include yellowfin tuna [11], related
mackerel species living in waters with oceanographic
conditions similar to those in the eastern Pacific [12], and
a congeneric species in the Gulf of Mexico, where moderate levels of genetic differences at the population level
were recorded by Gold et al. [13].
The Pacific Sierra mackerel is a major fishery in Mexico
with catch statistics estimated at 10,000 metric tons in
2006, and with an increasing trend in fishing effort [14].
No management strategies have been implemented for
this species so far, nor has the existence of a genetic stock
structure been defined. Delineation of conservation and
management strategies requires information regarding
the number of independent units comprising mackerel
populations in the Eastern Pacific.
In order to test the hypothesis on the genetic homogeneity of Pacific mackerel, the genetic diversity of samples
across the range of species was analysed using a 648 bp
segment of the hypervariable mtDNA- control region.
Sequence analyses consisted in applying a coalescence
approach to estimate historical demographic parameters
and to determine the occurrence of significant population fluctuations in the past. Pairwise migration rates and
divergence times among populations were estimated
through a coalescent-based approach, in order to distinguish between recent isolation and low levels of contemporary migration. Genetic differences among samples
from the three different regions were recorded, in addition to the occurrence of population expansions related

to the climate in the past and/or to ecological changes in
the eastern equatorial Pacific.

Results
mtDNA region control variability and temporal stability

The analysis of a 648 bp fragment from the mitochondrial
control region of Pacific mackerel S. sierra revealed very
high levels of variation. Of 246 individuals studied, 153
variable sites consisted of 59 transitions and 10 transversions that produced 239 haplotypes, 59 of which consisted of singleton sites. Ninety-four parsimonious
informative sites were identified, with nucleotide differences averaging 12.695. Overall, haplotype (h) and nucleotide diversity (π) for all sequences were 0.997 (± 0.0004)
and 0.01959 (± 0.00857) respectively (Table 1). The high
number of haplotypes was related to the presence of five
doublet mutations on adjacent nucleotides at positions
141-142 (AT-TA), 218-219 (TC-CT), 247-248 (GA-AG),
318-319 (GA-AG) and 476-477 (TC-CT).
Pairwise-sample estimates of ΦST revealed no differences in temporal variability among the samples collected
in several years: in Oaxaca from 2004 to 2005, and in
Chiapas from 2003 to 2004 (Table 2). The Sinaloa samples
of 2003 and 2008 presented no differences, yet a comparison with the Sinaloa 2004 samples did indicate significant differences. The 2004 samples remained different
even after the other two samples were pooled together.
Thus, the Sinaloa 2004 samples were considered a different sample (SIN04), and the temporal collections with no
differences were pooled into the Sinaloa (SIN), Oaxaca
(OAX) and Chiapas (CH) samples for further analysis.
Intraspecific Phylogeny

Phylogeny reconstruction based on a NJ algorithm
resulted in a non-obvious phylogeographic pattern with a
notorious absence of clear clustering of haplotypes (Figure 1). The tree was characterised by a low support of
branches and a politomic arrangement of most haplotypes that belong to the same location, but also with haplotypes mainly from the Chiapas and Peru samples
(Figure 1). The external haplotype represented by S. concolor was clearly separated from the rest of the sequences.
Population structure

The pairwise-sample estimates of ΦST resulted in a chaotic pattern of differentiation where genetic differences
were observed for some comparisons involving both, spatially close samples and samples from spatially separated
localities. Moreover, sample SIN04 presented an odd pattern of differentiation with differences in relation to the
other samples even after corrections for multiple testing
had been made (α = 0.05/15 = 0.003) (Table 2). However,
some patterns of differentiation could be identified from
some of the highly significant ΦST -estimates.

Estimates of pairwise sample ΦST revealed highly significant genetic differences mainly for the comparisons
involving the Sinaloa samples (SIN and SIN04), the Oaxaca sample, and the Peru sample (Table 2), although only
the comparisons between SIN-OAX (ΦST = 0.045; P <
0.001), SIN04-OAX (ΦST = 0.068; P < 0.001) and SIN04PE (ΦST = 0.085; P < 0.001) remained significant after correcting for multiple testing (α = 0.05/15 = 0.003). Therefore, a clear divergence pattern was identified for the
comparison between the locations that were most separated (SIN04 and PE), but especially between the northernmost (SIN, SIN04) and intermediate locations (OAX,
CH). In contrast, no differences were detected between
the southernmost sample (PE) and the intermediate samples, after correcting for multiple testing. As a result,
when the AMOVA was applied to the samples grouped in
the northern (SIN and MICH), central (OAX and CH)
and southern (PE) regions, based on the differences

found from pairwise sample ΦST-estimates and proximity
of sample locations, the analysis indicated there were no
significant differences (ΦCT = -0.022; P = 0.95) among
these groups. However, the differences among populations within groups were confirmed (ΦSC = 0.054; P <
0.001).
Additional genetic differences between some comparisons involving the SIN, OAX and PE locations, and the
MICH and CH samples, were also observed. However,
only the differences resulting from the comparison
between the highly divergent sample SIN04, and the
MICH (ΦST = 0.094; P < 0.001) and CH (ΦST = 0.081; P <
0.001) samples, remained significant after correcting for
multiple testing.
The UPGMA tree constructed with the linearised Slatkin's FST's between samples coincided with the main differences among groups of populations, but reproduced
the chaotic pattern of differentiation detected by the pair-

Time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), time of population divergence (T), migration rate (M), and ancestral population size (θ).
Values for T and TMRCA were calculated using a generational time of 2 years and mutation rates were estimated at 3.6 × 10-8 substitutions/
site/year [46]. ΦST values with * were significant without Bonferroni correction for the acceptance level (α = 0.05) and values with ** remained
significant after correcting for multiple testing (α = 0.5/15 = 0.003).

wise differences (Figure 2). The SIN04 population was
clearly separated from the rest of the samples, whereas
PE-CH and OAX-MICH formed two divergent geographic groups, with the SIN sample in an intermediate
position between both groups (see Figure 2).
Considering the observed differences between the SIN
and SIN04 samples, the isolation by distance model was
verified with the Mantel test, omitting one of the Sinaloa
samples and using the number of migrants by generation
(Nm). No significant correlations were found between the
distance and the Nm estimates (r2 = 0.26; P = 0.2) when
the SIN04 sample was omitted. Neither was there any
correlation when the SIN sample was omitted, and the
correlation was similar (r2 = 0.18; P = 0.3). This pattern
was clearly influenced by the slight differences observed
between the SIN and the Peru samples, based on the pairwise ΦST estimates.
Historical demography

The distribution of mismatches was unimodal for all
samples (Figure 3). Similarly, non significant deviations
for the sum of square deviations (SSD) between the
observed and the expected mismatch distributions were
observed besides very high and significant Fu estimations
(Figure 3). Considering a full demographic expansion
model as the factor responsible for the observed pattern
of mismatch distribution, it was estimated that the time
since the expansion occurred was approximately 204 000-

280 000 years ago for all the samples, with the exception
of SIN04 which occurred 108 000 years ago (Table 1). The
low effective population size of the females estimated for
populations SIN04, MICH and PE (range 0-0.01) suggests
there were drastic reductions before the expansion, followed by a sudden expansion, given the large difference
between the initial number of females before (N0) and
after (N1) the expansion. In contrast, the expansion was
slow for the SIN, OAX and CH populations, and may
have occurred from a relatively high number of females
(N0 = 18 000-55 000).
Since the observed mismatch pattern may also be
explained by a range expansion of the populations [15],
the parameters were obtained under a spatial expansion
model [16]. If spatial expansion were to be assumed as the
factor responsible for the observed population molecular
architecture, such an expansion could have occurred in a
similar time, or even more recently, than the demographic expansion of all populations, that is to say,
approximately 250,000 years ago. The range expansion of
all the populations, excepting SIN04, probably originated
from a significant number of females (N = 16 500-69 400)
with a very low rate of exchange with the original population (Table 1). In contrast, the population expansion of
SIN04 seems to have occurred 104 000 years ago from a
reduced number of females (N = 7.5) with a very high
migration rate (Table 1).

The extent of the difference between the estimates of
the time expected since the most common ancestor
(TMRCA) and the divergence time (T) obtained with the
MDIV, may be used to distinguish short divergence times
with low gene flow from long divergence times with moderate gene flow, as an explanation for population divergence [17]. Despite the fact that convergence of the
likelihood function for the divergence time in all comparisons was close to zero, estimates of TMRCA were lower
than T for all pairwise-sample comparisons (Table 2), in
agreement with a model of recent isolation and reduced
or no migration.
Larger differences were observed between estimates of
T in relation to TMRCA for comparisons involving samples from the northern (Sinaloa), central (OAX) and
southern (Peru) groups of samples (Table 2). However,
small differences were observed between T and TMRCA
(41 700 and 11 300 years respectively) in the MICH OAX comparison, suggesting a re-establishment of gene
flow after isolation. In general, populations from the
northern group (SIN and SIN04, except MICH) and the
southernmost sample (PE) diverged early from the central populations (OAX and CH).
The coincidence in the divergence time and the time
since the occurrence of the population expansion must be
highlighted. The separation of populations, except for
SIN04 which expanded more recently, took place after
the demographic or spatial expansion event, suggesting a
possible relation between divergence and the drastic
reduction caused by glacial events that occurred during
the Pleistocene.
One may also obtain estimates of the ancestral population size (θ) and migration (M) for all pairwise-sample
comparisons from the MDIV. Estimates of θ were high
(37.7-131.4), indicating that populations originated from
relatively large ancestral population sizes. For the various
θ estimates between population pairs, those involving the
Peru sample presented the largest values, indicating that
this was the ancestral population (Table 2).
Migration estimates between populations from the
northern group (SIN, SIN04 and MICH) were low in rela-

tion to the central samples (1.7-9.9) and the southern
sample (2.1-7.7), and were consistent with a model of
divergence that resulted from restrained gene flow.
Migration estimates between the central and southern
populations were higher (7.5-14.8), and this, together
with the similarity in divergence times and the modest
levels of differences among both groups observed, suggests there was a secondary contact between populations
after divergence.

Discussion
Genetic variability and temporal stability

The analyses of a 648 bp fragment of mtDNA-Dloop in
the present study revealed high levels of genetic diversity
in the analyzed populations. The highly significant
genetic diversity in terms of haplotypes for S. sierra could
be explained by the very high estimates of ancestral effective population size in conjunction with recent expansion
events.
The differences observed among some Sinaloa samples
of different years, and the lack of temporal sampling in
Peru, made it impossible to be fully conclusive about the
temporal genetic stability of the Pacific mackerel population, regardless of the homogeneity between the temporal
collections of the Oaxaca and Chiapas populations, as
well as for the 2003 and 2008 Sinaloa samples. The 2004
Sinaloa samples exhibited marked differences with
respect to the 2003 and the 2008 Sinaloa samples, and to
the rest of the samples. They presented notoriously different molecular diversity indices (Table 1) with a low
level of nucleotide diversity (0.76%; average 2%), in addition to a diversity in the mean number of segregating sites
(24; mean 70.1) and the mean number of pairwise differences (4.9; average 13.3). Such diversity indices are evidently related to the differences observed. This odd
population structure where temporal genetic differences
and/or small scale spatial differences are observed, is
recurrent for fish in a wide variety of ecosystems,
although it has been particularly identified for marine
species and attributed to non-random sampling in a phenomenon called "chaotic genetic patchiness" [18]. In the
marine environment, offspring of species with large
spawning aggregations may present a differential survival
success (sweepstakes-chance matching hypothesis).
Hence, for a given year, most of the recruited young may
be generated from a reduced number of adults, usually
displaying low levels of genetic variability [19]. Moreover,
the size selective sampling methods used by fisheries tend
to over-represent some cohorts. Hence, the genetic data
collected from this sort of samples will depend on a subset of parents in a generation (e.g., a particular cohort),
biasing the estimation of population differentiation
upwards. The pattern of molecular diversity displayed for
the SIN04 sample was consistent with this evidence. Fur-

thermore, differences in age composition between SIN04
and the other samples was observed; whereas age 2 was
notoriously over-represented (74%) in relation to age 3
(22%) in the SIN04 sample, the two ages were equally rep-

resented in the SIN sample (50% for age 2 and 3 respectively) as well as in age composition for the MICH (53%
for age 3, 44% for age 4 and 3% for age 5) and the OAX
(47% for age 2 and 53% for age 3) samples. Unfortunately,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/34

data on the number of cohorts that were represented in
each sample was not available for all the samples.
Despite the evidence recorded for the age differences,
the evidence observed for the "chaotic genetic patchiness"
that resulted from the non-random sampling of cohorts
of Pacific Sierra mackerel, require further examination
and should be considered for future studies.
Population genetic structure

Despite the "chaotic genetic patchiness observed", the
pairwise-sample divergence estimates indicated the existence of clear differences between the samples from the
northern (SIN), central (OAX) and southern (PE) areas of
the eastern Pacific, and especially between two of the
areas of greatest abundance (Sinaloa and Oaxaca) that are
also regarded as spawning areas in the Mexican Pacific
[8,9]. Regardless of the fact that the AMOVA failed to
determine differences among the groups, at least two
genetically differentiated units across the species range
distribution can be considered based on the pairwise
haplotype divergence estimates: a northern population
localised at the mouth of the Gulf of Baja California
(Sinaloa), a second population in the Gulf of Tehuantepec
(Oaxaca), and a possible third population off Peru as no
consistent differences were found between the OAX and
PE samples. Moreover, the existence of additional populations within the range distribution of the species cannot
be discarded, as collections did not include sampling in
the northernmost area of the Pacific Sierra mackerel distribution (off Baja California), or sampling of populations
off Central America. The lack of significance detected
with the AMOVA resulted from the differences among
populations within groups, as those observed between
Sinaloa-Michoacán and Chiapas-Oaxaca.
Considering that Pacific mackerel exhibit migratory
behaviour, the observed population structure could be
related to specific spatial or temporal spawning regimes;
spawning off Mexico takes place in July, August and September, and in lower latitudes it may occur from December through April [9].
Adult mackerel have a limited capacity to migrate as a
result of their body density, short pectoral fins and body
length, in comparison with the large pelagic scombrids
[20]. Besides, their spawning has been associated with
areas of high productivity where increased larval growth
and survival has been recorded [21]. Thus, we suggest
that the divergence that was observed may result from a
fidelity to spawning sites or a limited dispersal, rather
than to adaptations to particular oceanographic regimes.
Several important upwelling areas in the Eastern Pacific
include regions off Baja California, Sinaloa, Oaxaca, Panama and Peru. Given that larval survival of Scomberomorus species is strongly dependent on the availability of
food [10], upwelling areas may represent major spawning

Page 8 of 12

sites for Pacific Sierra mackerel populations. As high productivity significantly increases larval growth in scombrid fish, a reduction in the duration of the larval stage,
and hence of larval drift, may result in a limited dispersal
from the spawning site. Consequently, a fidelity to
upwelling areas and/or a limited dispersal may constitute
important factors that promote isolation in Pacific mackerel populations.
The northern and central populations of our study
showed well differentiated units. However, there were differences recorded between the central and the Peru populations that were not consistent after the Bonferroni
correction. These populations ought to be re-evaluated
since they seem to reflect independent evolutionary histories that should not be underestimated. Similarly, as
gene flow estimates from MDIV were substantially lower
between the northern and central populations than
between the central and southern populations (Peru),
gene flow could be reestablished as a result of a secondary contact favored by an increase in the number of high
productivity areas in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and
by the intense southern currents during the last glacial
maxima [22] that might have promoted the displacement
of southern populations to equatorial areas.
Past climate changes and size fluctuations in populations

The mismatch analyses of the molecular variation were
consistent in supporting the occurrence of expansions of
Pacific Sierra mackerel populations after drastic reductions since unimodal mismatch distributions, as well as
non significant deviations for the sum of square deviations (SSD) were observed. The estimations of the divergence time and the time of occurrence of population
fluctuations are controversial since these are based on the
accuracy of the molecular clock used. Generalized mutational rates estimated for other similar species were used,
in the absence of available data for calibration. Thus,
these estimates may be inaccurate when determining the
exact time of occurrence of events, and the divergence
time and/or time since population expansions occurred
should be considered rough approximations. However,
the pattern for the occurrence of these events will remain,
even though departures from the mutational rate that
was used to estimate divergence times might result in
either deeper or shallower estimations.
Evidence of the occurrence of both demographic and/
or spatial expansion events is related to glacial episodes
during the last 0.5 million of years (my) in the equatorial
Pacific [23]. The time of population expansions is registered as having occurred during the Yarmouth interglacial [24] some ~300-265 ky ago after the Kansas glacial
stage [25]. The sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific was about 3° to 5°C colder during
the glacial cycles, and about 1°C warmer during the inter-

López et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/34

glacial stage, than the conditions that have prevailed during the last 500 ky [26]. Studies on the species
composition of planktonic foraminiferal and radiolarian
assemblages have reconstructed the conditions of the
surface waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) during glacial-interglacial periods in the late Pliocene and
mid-Pleistocene [27-29]. These studies have documented
substantial fluctuations in the levels of primary productivity related to the thermocline depth in the eastern
equatorial Pacific during glacial events in the Pleistocene,
besides a trend in increased SST and upwelling areas in
the EEP. Since Pacific mackerel rely on the presence of
high productivity areas and their distribution depends on
the sea temperature, reductions in SST during glacial
events, combined with fluctuations in primary productivity, might have reduced their populations drastically,
whereas the warmer and more productive waters of the
interglacial episodes might have promoted population
expansions. Therefore, the occurrence of glacial-interglacial cycles during the Pleistocene may have caused cycles
of expansion-contraction of populations, whether demographic or spatial, thereby notably influencing the molecular architecture of populations. The glacial-interglacial
events probably caused a similar number of reductionexpansion cycles. Both demographic and/or spatial
expansion events are not mutually exclusive; they probably occurred on numerous occasions, but the mismatch
results allow only the most recent event to be recorded.
Because of the decrease in SST in both hemispheres,
reductions in the population ranges during glacial events
of the late Pleistocene have been documented for many
temperate species in the Eastern Pacific [30,31].
However, because the time for the occurrence of expansions is a rough estimation, the coincidence of an expansion and an interglacial event is also approximate.
Alternative explanations for population expansions of
species in the eastern equatorial Pacific could be suggested. Evidence based on paleoceanographic studies has
documented a trend for an increase in the SST and
upwelling areas in the EEP since the early Pleistocene
[28,32]. Thus, Pacific Sierra mackerel populations may
have found favourable conditions for population expansions since long ago. Similarly, a heightened intensity in
the Peru Current during the last glacial maxima has also
been documented [23], suggesting greater possibilities of
expansion to new areas.
The mismatch analyses were also consistent with the
continent island model of spatial expansion, which coincides with the development of favourable conditions in
the EEP. Small peripheral isolates of populations might
possibly have broken away from the ancestral population
to establish divergent populations in new areas. Ancestral
populations are characterised by their larger sizes [33].
The pairwise sample estimates of ancestral population

Page 9 of 12

sizes obtained in our study were large for the comparisons involving the Oaxaca and Peru samples. Therefore,
the populations located in the southern range of the species distribution (Central or South America) can be considered ancestral. The origin of S. sierra has been
established in the Scomberomorus regalis group that
formed in the eastern Atlantic and dispersed into the
eastern Pacific through the Trans-isthmian channel
before the closure of the Panamian isthmus [34] (eastern
Pacific/eastern Atlantic track) [35]. The ancestral S. sierra
population could then be located in Central America, and
the northern and southern populations probably derived
from this ancestral population as the result of a dispersal
process following the colonisation of new areas. Our evidence reveals that population expansions associated with
historical events, whether climatic (glacial-interglacial
cycles) and/or ecological during interglacial periods or
glaciations, have had a prominent role in the evolutionary
history and in the determination of the present molecular
architecture of the Pacific Sierra mackerel populations.
Conservation

The evidence supported by the mtDNA makes it possible
to recognise at least two genetically discrete population
units in the distribution area of S. sierra. Nevertheless,
due to the generalised perception of the mtDNA as a single locus having an independent evolutionary history, one
must verify the imprint that climatic events have left on
nuclear DNA in order to confirm the evidence found.
Given the fact that no management strategies have been
implemented for this species, the need to establish independent exploitation regimes for each of the population
units identified should be evaluated. The effective female
population size of the entire Pacific mackerel population
was estimated at 1.9 × 106 females. Furthermore, the census population size may be extrapolated from catch statistics: considering a mean catch of 10 000 metric tons
[14] and an estimated average weight per individual of
450 g, the calculated number of harvested fish can be
fixed at 22.2 × 106. Actual levels of exploitation are ten
times the effective population size of females, amounts
which might have contributed to setting the population at
the overexploitation status as reported by the biological
indicators for the Pacific sierra fishery in Mexico [8].
Thus, there is an imperative need for effective management strategies in the conservation of Pacific Sierra
mackerel.

Conclusions
The analyses of a fragment of mtDNA-Dloop for Scomberomorus sierra revealed the existence of at least two
genetically differentiated units across the species range
distribution in the eastern Pacific, which corresponds to
main spawning areas for the Pacific Sierra mackerel.

López et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/34

These areas should be subject to independent exploitation regimes in order to preserve the genetic integrity of
the populations. The observed population structure may
be the result of fidelity to spawning sites and/or of a limited dispersal, even though evidence was also found of
contemporary gene flow between the central and southern areas. Mismatch analyses exhibited substantial fluctuations in the population size in the past in response to
climatic changes caused by glaciations or to significant
changes in oceanographic conditions in the eastern equatorial Pacific during the Pleistocene. These events have
left their imprint on the molecular architecture of Pacific
mackerel S. sierra, as well as on a variety of species in
similar habitats.

Sample collection, DNA extraction and sequencing

Tissue samples of Pacific mackerel S. sierra were collected
at four locations over five consecutive years from small
(artisanal) fishing boats operating on a local scale in the
eastern Pacific (Figure 4). The sampling locations comprise almost the entire species range: Sinaloa in 2003
(SIN03; n = 23), 2004 (SIN04; n = 26) and 2008 (SIN08; n
= 20); Michoacán in 2002 (MICH02; n = 31); Oaxaca in
2003 (OX03; n = 25) and 2005 (OX05; n = 25); Chiapas in
2003 (CH03; n = 21) and 2004 (CH04; n = 26) and Peru in
2005 (PE05; n = 49). The fork length of individuals from
Sinaloa, Michoacán and Oaxaca, were obtained and compared with the size-distribution modes of Aguirre-Villaseñor [8] for S. sierra to determine the age composition
of samples. Total genomic DNA was isolated using the
proteinase K - lysis-buffer extraction [36] and resuspended in 50 - 100 μL of TE buffer.
The complete sequence of the mitochondrial region
control of mackerel was amplified (900 bp) by using the
primers Pro5-M13 (5'-TAATCCTGCCGCAATTATCC3') and Teleost (5'-AGGCCTTCCAGGTTAGGTGT-3')
reported in Carlsson et al. [37]. Sequences were aligned
and used in designing internal primers so as to amplify a
750 bp segment with the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) in a total of 246 fish [GenBank accession numbers:
GQ329882-GQ330120]. Reactions for sequencing were
made in total volumes of 50 μL containing 50-100 ng
DNA, in amplification buffer, 10 mM TRIS-HCl (pH 8.4),
50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.1
mM of each primer and 2.5 units of platinum Taq DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen, Cat. 10966-030). PCR amplifications consisted of 35 cycles of 1 min at 95°C for denaturalisation, 1 min at 59°C for annealing, and a final
extension at 65°C for 3 min. PCR products were purified
with either a QIAquick purification kit (QIAgen No. Cat.
28104) or the ChargeSwitch PCR Clean-Up kit (Invitrogen, Cat. CS12000). Purified products were sequenced in
the forward direction on an ABI 3730xl automated

sequencer applying the dye-termination method (Applied
Biosystems). Pairwise alignment was made between each
individual sequence and the most frequent haplotypes for
every location in order to solve ambiguities and/or confirm nucleotide assignments.
Intraspecific Phylogeny

Multiple alignment was performed with ClustalX ver. 1.8
[38] as well as by optimising the gap penalties in order to
minimise artificial homologies between haplotypes
(homoplasy) during the alignment. The hierarchical likelihood ratio method implemented in MODELTEST 3.06
[39] was applied to define the most appropriate substitution model of sequence evolution for the segment of the
mtDNA-Dloop analysed. Haplotype (h) and nucleotide
(π) diversities were estimated using Arlequin 3.0 [40] and
with the application of the Tamura-Nei substitution
model [41] as selected by the MODELTEST. A Neighbour-joining tree (NJ) based on Tamura-Nei distances
was constructed using the Mega version 4.0 software [42]
in order to test the evolutionary relationships among the
mtDNA haplotypes. Trees were rooted with S. concolor
sequences, and a bootstrap resampling [43] based on
1000 replicates was used to determine the statistical support for the nodes. In order to define relationships among
the populations, linearised Slatkin's FST's expressed in
terms of the coalescence times [44] were estimated in
accordance with Arlequin. This considers a demographic
model where two haploid populations of size N diverged τ
generations ago from a population of identical size with-

López et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/34

out exchanging any migrants. A UPGMA tree was generated using the coalescence times among locations using
Mega 4.0.
Population structure and historical demography

The Arlequin software package was used to obtain the
unbiased estimator of Wrights F-statistics ΦST (an
mtDNA analogue for FST), for hierarchical FST [45], and
pairwise sample ΦST analyses (20100 permutations) on
mtDNA sequence data. The ΦST analyses were performed
using a matrix of Tamura-Nei distances, with a gamma
shape parameter of 0.4.
The demographic parameters τ, θ0, and θ1 were
obtained from nucleotide mismatch distributions with
the Arlequin software in order to examine the impact of
demographic fluctuations related to past glaciations on
the molecular architecture of Pacific mackerel populations. Considering the significant ΦST estimates within
populations, samples were analysed separately. As
regards demographic expansion, the parameter Tau (τ) is
an estimator of the mutational time since the occurrence
of population expansion, that can be used to obtain estimates of the actual time (T): this is true as population
expansion by T = 2μ/τ, where μ is the mutation rate estimated at 3.6%/Ma, for the mtDNA control region of "germinate species" of snook of the genus Centropomus [46].
Estimates of effective female population size for an initial
population N0, assumed to grow to size N1 under Roger's
sudden expansion model [47], were obtained by substituting θ0 = 2μN and θ1 = 2μN where μ is the mutational
rate considering a generation time of 2 years for Pacific
mackerel [48]. Mismatch analyses may also provide information regarding the range expansion of populations
given that a unimodal distribution of pairwise nucleotide
differences among sequences may leave a similar molecular architecture for both events [15,16]. Therefore, we
conducted an analysis to estimate the three spatial expansion parameters τ, θ = θ0 = θ1, assuming that N = N0 and
M = 2Nm where m is the rate at which the sampled deme
would exchange migrants with a single population of infinite size; we used the same methods to estimate the
demographic expansion parameters as implemented in
Arlequin. The estimate of the effective number of females
needed to explain the actual mismatch distribution under
the spatial expansion model is given by N = θ/2μ. Finally,
Arlequin was also used to obtain the sum of square deviations (SSD) between the observed and the expected mismatch as a statistical test for the fit to a unimodal
mismatch distribution and to calculate estimates of Fu's
neutrality test (FS) and explore whether mutations should
be considered neutral or influenced by selection where
significantly negative values are also indicative of population expansion [49].

The Isolation by Distance model (IBD) [50] was tested
considering the absolute number of migrants exchanged
between two populations estimated as M = 1- FST/2FST
(assuming that M = 2 Nm for haploid data). This was
done to evaluate the correlation of the distance between
localities measured as a geographic separation in nautical
miles (nm), and the M values obtained by means of the
Mantel test [51] as implemented in Arlequin.
The migration rate and the divergence time from pairwise-sample comparisons were obtained with the Markov
chain Monte Carlo approach as implemented in the
MDIV software to test the "isolation with migration"
model [18], in order to distinguish between a recent isolation and low levels of contemporary migration. The
model parameters were θ (θ = 2Nefμ) where Nef is the
effective population size and μ is the mutation rate, M (M
= 2Nef m) where m is the migration rate, and T (T = t/Nef)
where t is the divergence time. These parameters were
obtained using a finite sites model (HKY). The length of
the Markov chains consisted of 5,000,000 cycles with a
burn-in time of 500,000. Likelihood values for θ, M and T
were those displaying the highest posterior probabilities.
