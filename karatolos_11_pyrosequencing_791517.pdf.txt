Abstract
Background: The whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum is an economically important crop pest in temperate regions
that has developed resistance to most classes of insecticides. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying
resistance have not been characterised and, to date, progress has been hampered by a lack of nucleotide
sequence data for this species. Here, we use pyrosequencing on the Roche 454-FLX platform to produce a
substantial and annotated EST dataset. This ‘unigene set’ will form a critical reference point for quantitation of
over-expressed messages via digital transcriptomics.
Results: Pyrosequencing produced around a million sequencing reads that assembled into 54,748 contigs, with an
average length of 965 bp, representing a dramatic expansion of existing cDNA sequences available for
T. vaporariorum (only 43 entries in GenBank at the time of this publication). BLAST searching of non-redundant
databases returned 20,333 significant matches and those gene families potentially encoding gene products
involved in insecticide resistance were manually curated and annotated. These include, enzymes potentially
involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and those encoding the targets of the major chemical classes of
insecticides. A total of 57 P450s, 17 GSTs and 27 CCEs were identified along with 30 contigs encoding the target
proteins of six different insecticide classes.
Conclusion: Here, we have developed new transcriptomic resources for T. vaporariorum. These include a
substantial and annotated EST dataset that will serve the community studying this important crop pest and will
elucidate further the molecular mechanisms underlying insecticide resistance.

Background
Whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) are important pests
of agriculture that feed on and transmit viruses to a
wide range of crops. The two most damaging and widespread species are the tobacco or cotton whitefly (Bemisia tabaci Gennadius) and the greenhouse whitefly
(Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood).
One factor enhancing the pest status of whiteflies is
their ability to evolve resistance to insecticides. Both
B. tabaci and T. vaporariorum are known to exhibit

resistance to several insecticide groups including the
neonicotinoids, the most widely-used compounds for
whitefly control [1,2]. Insecticide resistance commonly
arises through two main mechanisms 1) reduced
binding of the insecticide to its target through target
site mutation [3] (e.g. acetylcholinesterase for organophosphates/carbamates, the voltage-gated sodium
channel for pyrethroids) and 2) enhanced metabolism
or sequestration of insecticide by enzymes such as
carboxyl-cholinesterases (CCEs), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases
[3-7].
CCEs, GSTs and P450s are encoded by large and
diverse gene families that are difficult to fully

characterise by traditional biochemical methods. Identification and cloning of genes encoding insecticide
target sites composed of multiple subunit proteins
(such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) by degenerate PCR is also a lengthy and sometimes difficult
process. The recent and rapid growth of the use of
next generation sequencing has made it easier to study
large complex genes or gene families such as insecticide target sites and those involved in detoxification of
xenobiotics via the de novo sequencing of whole insect
transcriptomes [8,9]. Although there is a significant
amount of genomic data for B. tabaci in this regard,
including an expressed sequence tag (EST) library [10]
and an ongoing genome project [11], very little comparable data for T. vaporariorum exist, with only 43
nucleotide sequences currently available at NCBI.
Cost-effective high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies such as 454-based pyrosequencing of ESTs are
a powerful new approach to characterise the transcriptome of insect species that lack a fully sequenced genome [8,9,12]. The amount of sequence information
generated by these methods also facilitates the global
analysis of gene expression by providing a reference
transcriptome for cDNA microarray design and/or Serial
Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) [13,14,10]. Here,
we have used 454-based pyrosequencing to generate a
substantial EST dataset of the T. vaporariorum transcriptome and then characterised genes encoding detoxification enzymes and insecticide target proteins.

Results and discussion
454 pyrosequencing and assembly

Over-abundant 0.6-6 kb transcripts were reduced by
normalisation of the whitefly cDNAs and an even distribution of transcripts ranging from 0.5 to 6 kb in size
was produced. 454 pyrosequencing of two libraries
(from the insecticide-susceptible TV1 and the imidacloprid selected TV6 T. vaporariorum strains) resulted in a
total of 1,104,651 reads. After quality scoring of the
reads, 990,945 high-quality reads with an average length
of 362 bp were entered to assembly (est2assembly). One
pooled assembly was done incorporating both libraries
(52,832,938 bp of sequencing), which resulted in 54,748
contigs with an average length of 965 bp (Table 1).
55.8% (30,552 contigs) of these had an ORF (open reading frame) ≥200 bp, with an average length of 540 bp.
The characteristics of the assembled T. vaporariorum
454 contigs and BLASTx alignments against the Drosophila melanogaster uniprot database are shown in Additional file 1. Figure 1 demonstrates that contigs that
were assembled from up to 200 reads displayed a linear
relationship between sequence read number and contig
length (R = 0.716, P < 0.001).

Homology searches, gene ontology and protein
classification

Approximately 37% (20,333 sequences) of the contigs
returned an above cut-off BLAST hit to the NCBI nr
database (1E-3 for BLASTx resulted in 19,983 and 1E-10
for BLASTn resulted in 350 additional BLAST results)
(Additional file 2). The average read length of these contigs was 1,394 bp and E-value and sequence similarity
distributions are detailed in Additional file 3. As
expected, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris
(Hemiptera: Aphididae) is the species that returned the
most BLAST hits (16%) with the T. vaporariorum contigs (Figure 2A), since this species’ genome was recently
fully sequenced [15] and currently represents the vast
majority of hemipteran sequences available in GenBank.
The remaining 34,416 contigs that did not return a significant BLAST result against the NCBI nr database,
had an average read length of 712 bp. More than 36% of
those contigs (12,472 sequences) were found to have an
ORF ≥200 bp, with an average length of 301 bp. 28% of
these contigs (9,553 sequences) returned an InterPro
result and 1.4% (488 sequences) returned a GO term
(Table 1). These results give some indication of the limitation of BLAST comparison as a tool for inferring the
relevant biological function of tentative unique genes
assembled from sequencing data for species with very
limited existing transcriptomic information. However, it
is likely that the rapid expansion in sequence data from
ongoing small and large scale insect sequencing projects
will facilitate the future annotation of these genes.
GO terms were used for the classification of the functions of the predicted whitefly proteins, producing
21,899 terms for biological process categories, 15,571 for
molecular function categories, and 14,966 for cellular
component categories. Enzyme classification shows
that hydrolases account for the largest proportion of
T. vaporariorum enzymes (38%), followed by transferases (32%) and oxidoreductases (15%) (Figure 2B).
Most of the molecular function GO terms (Figure 3A)
were involved in binding (45%) followed by catalytic
activity (35%). Metabolic and cellular processes were
involved with more than a half of the biological process
GO terms (Figure 3B). The overall distribution suggests
that the sequencing provided a comprehensive representation of the T. vaporariorum transcriptome and that
454 pyrosequencing of ESTs can achieve a great number
and depth of sequence contigs.

enzymes such as P450s, GSTs and CCEs. Representatives of all three enzyme families were identified in
the T. vaporariorum transcriptome and the average
sequence length and coverage obtained for members of
these gene families using one full plate of 454 sequencing was comprehensive (Table 2). Table 2 reveals that
the average ORF length of each of these gene families
obtained for T. vaporariorum was more than 84% of
that of the same gene families in the fully-annotated
genome of A. pisum. Candidate contigs were manually
curated to identify allelic variants of the same gene or
those with a high number of sequencing errors. Most
contigs were assembled from at least 4 sequencing reads
and were identified in both T. vaporariorum libraries
(TV1 and TV6). The only exception was contig 12863,
which was assembled from 19 reads from only the
imidacloprid resistant strain (TV6) library and had a
protein motif of a CCE.
Transcripts encoding putative P450s

A total of 123 P450 related contigs were identified in
the transcriptome. Of these, 57 were manually curated
(Additional file 4 and Additional file 5) as the remainder
were found to be either allelic variants of the same P450
gene or contained too many sequencing errors. These
57 P450 sequences were named by Dr David Nelson in
accordance with the P450 nomenclature committee convention (http://drnelson.uthsc.edu/cytochromeP450.
html) [16] and 40 of them were found to represent full
length ORFs. Based on the closest BLAST hits in the
NCBI nr database, and when possible, by phylogenetic
analyses with other known insect P450 genes, P450s
were assigned to appropriate CYP clades and families.
Representatives of all 4 major insect CYP clades (CYP24 and mitochondrial) were found in this dataset
(Figure 4). A majority of identified P450s belonged to the
CYP3 family (34/57 P450s), 13 to the CYP4 family, and
the rest to the CYP2 and mitochondrial families (3 and 7
respectively) (Table 3). Phylogenetic analysis of the
T. vaporariorum P450s with those of A. pisum (Figure 4)
revealed significant divergence in this gene family
between these two species with only a few putative
A. pisum orthologues identified (Additional file 4). Two
sequences were considered orthologues if they were
paired in the phylogeny with bootstrap support greater
than 50%. Duplication events specific to T. vaporariorum
are also apparent from the phylogeny, with the best
example being the three CYP4-type sequences CYP4G59,
CYP4G60 and CYP4G61. The potential role of these
duplication events in insecticide resistance warrants
further investigation as amplification of a P450 gene has
recently been implicated in insecticide resistance in
Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae) [13].

CYP3 and CYP4 P450 families in other insect species
are implicated in the metabolism of plant secondary
metabolites and synthetic insecticides [5]. In the other
hemipterans B. tabaci and M. persicae, over-expression
of cytochrome P450s (CYP6CM1 and CYP6CY3 respectively) contribute to resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides [17,13]. The closest hits of these two P450s in
T. vaporariorum are CYP6CM2, CYP6CM3 (68% and

67% similarity to CYP6CM1 respectively) and CYP6DP1,
CYP6DZ1 (60% and 59% similarity to CYP6CY3 respectively). These genes and the other CYP3 and CYP4
P450 genes identified in this study are candidates
for a potential role in neonicotinoid resistance in
T. vaporariorum.
Although the number of P450s in the T. vaporariorum
transcriptome (57) is within the range of P450s

(Hymenoptera: Apidae) [18-23]. The current number of
57 P450s in T. vaporariorum is at the lower end of this
range, almost half of that for M. persicae.
Transcripts encoding putative CCEs

A total of 78 contig sequences with a protein motif of a
CCE were identified. Of these, 27 were manually curated
(Additional file 4 and Additional file 6) as some of the
original sequences were found to be either allelic variants of the same CCE gene or contained too many
sequencing errors, and 14 were found to be full length.
Based on the closest BLAST hits in the NCBI nr
database and when possible by phylogenetic analyses
with other known CCE genes from other insect species,
these enzymes were assigned to three known classes
of CCEs (Figure 5; Table 3). Known CCEs can be
divided into 13 clades, nine of which are represented
in T. vaporariorum. Clades without identifiable
T. vaporariorum homologues are clade B (alpha esterase), integument esterases (D) and lepidopteran juvenile
hormone esterase (F and G). Esterases involved in the
detoxification of insecticides belong to clades A-C and
12 sequences were assigned to these clades. A phylogenetic analysis indicates a potential expansion of
T. vaporariorum CCEs in clade A (compared to known,
aphid CCEs). There is also evidence of a contraction in
clade E, which contains the vast majority of aphid CCEs,
although it is difficult to ascertain if genes in this clade
have been lost from the genome or simply remain to be
discovered (Figure 5; Table 3). In addition, divergence in
the CCEs of A. pisum and T. vaporariorum is apparent
in the same clades (Figure 5). The potential A. pisum
and B. tabaci orthologues of T. vaporariorum CCEs are
detailed in Additional file 4.
Clade A contains the largest number of identified
T. vaporariorum CCEs (11 sequences), twice as many as
in two other hemipteran species A. pisum and M. persicae (5 sequences each) [23]. Of these, one CCE
sequence (contig 12282) had a high homology to a carboxylesterase gene in B. tabaci (COE1; accession
ABV45410), which is over-expressed in organophosphate-resistant strains [25] and another (contig 12863)

was identified only in the imidacloprid resistant TV6
library and is therefore a candidate gene for a potential
role in the neonicotinoid resistance of this strain. One
identified sequence (contig 1172) had high homology to
Lepidoptera-specific alpha esterase (C). Six sequences
had homology to beta esterase (E) and two contigs were
identified as acetylcholinesterases (AChE, clade J), which
are the targets for organophosphate and carbamate
insecticides. One of these, contig 19680, corresponds to
a known AChE sequence of T. vaporariorum (ace-2;
accession number CAE11223). Finally, other clades with
identified T. vaporariorum homologues are glutactin
(H), gliotactin (K), neuroligin (L), neurotactin (M) and
an uncharacterised group (I).
Transcripts encoding putative GSTs

A total of 44 GST-related contig sequences were identified, 17 of which were unique and manually curated
(Additional file 4 and Additional file 7), and thirteen of
these were full length. Based on the closest BLAST hits
in the NCBI nr database and when possible by phylogenetic analysis these contigs were assigned to the Delta,
Epsilon, Omega, Sigma, Theta, Zeta, and microsomal
classes (Figure 6; Table 3). Phylogenetic comparison of A.
pisum and T. vaporariorum GSTs revealed significant
divergence in this gene family between the two species
(Figure 6). Most of the identified GSTs were assigned to
the Delta class (9 sequences), members of which are
known to play a role in insecticide detoxification in other
insect species [21]. The number of Delta class GSTs in
T. vaporariorum (9 sequences) is close to that in A. pisum
where 10 sequences were identified [23]. Although the
Epsilon and Zeta classes are absent in A. pisum and
M. persicae [23], two contigs (one for each class) were
identified in T. vaporariorum. One contig, namely Tv7290,
was found to encode a microsomal GST.
Detection of gene sequences encoding insecticide targets

A number of contigs encoding insecticide target proteins were identified in the T. vaporariorum transcriptome. These include the acetylcholinesterase enzyme
(AChE), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits

voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), the g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, the glutamate-gated chloride
channel (GluCl) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR)
(Table 4, Figure 7 and Additional file 8). All contigs that
were assembled from more than 3 reads and the vast
majority of the contigs with lower coverage were identified in both T. vaporariorum libraries (TV1 and TV6).
Although many of these contigs are not full length, they
will nevertheless facilitate further characterisation of
these targets by PCR and/or RACE. As the two cDNA
libraries were tagged prior to sequencing, we investigated the occurrence of SNPs in contigs encoding insecticide target-sites between the resistant and susceptible

T. vaporariorum strains. A limited number of nonsynonymous SNPs were observed between the two
strains and these are listed in Additional file 9. A number of, often highly conserved, mutations have been
described in many of these target proteins that lead to
varying degrees of insensitivity such as mutations within
the active-site gorge of the AChE enzyme [26], in
domains II or III of the VGSC [27], in the pore lining
M2 region of the GABA receptor [28] and within two
alpha subunits of the nAChR [29]. Where possible we
examined the two T. vaporariorum libraries for previously described mutations at known ‘hot-spots’ in
other arthropod species but none were observed. However, several non-synonymous mutations at alternative

(Additional file 9) and these clearly warrant further
investigation. Pyrosequencing or TaqMan® assays can
now be rapidly developed and used to screen additional
whitefly populations with different resistance phenotypes
to determine the consistency of the correlation of these
SNPs with resistance.

Conclusions
T. vaporariorum is an important agricultural pest that
has developed resistance to several insecticides used for
whitefly control. To date, the lack of genomics data
available for this species has hampered characterisation
of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance. The
~55,000 non-redundant EST contigs described in this
study represent a dramatic expansion of existing cDNA
sequence available for T. vaporariorum. We have

identified the genes and gene families that are potential
candidates for conferring insecticide resistance in
T. vaporariorum including those encoding enzymes
putatively involved in metabolic detoxification of xenobiotics and those encoding the target proteins of the
major chemical classes of insecticides. The EST contig
library developed in this study can be used as a reference transcriptome for analysis of gene expression using
cDNA microarray and/or SAGE. We plan to use these
genomic resources to investigate the role of detoxifying
enzymes and target-site modification in T. vaporariorum
populations that are resistant to insecticides. However,
more broadly the annotated EST library will facilitate
the investigation of the fundamental biology of
T. vaporariorum and its interactions with host plants.
T. vaporariorum has a similar biology to B. tabaci, offering the prospect of sharing information on resistance

Methods
Insects and RNA extraction

Whiteflies for the generation of cDNA libraries were
obtained from two different strains of T. vaporariorum.
One was an insecticide susceptible standard strain
(TV1) and the other was a strain from Turkey (TV6)
selected with a 1,000 ppm dose of the neonicotinoid
insecticide, imidacloprid (Confidor; Bayer CropScience).
TV6 was collected from a greenhouse with a history of
intensive insecticide use, although the complete treatment history is unknown for this strain. Insects were
maintained on French bean plants, Phaseolus vulgaris L.,
cv. ‘Canadian Wonder’ (Fabaceae), under a 16h photoperiod at 24°C. More than 2,000 adults of each strain
were collected in two separate 2 ml Eppendorf tubes
and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were sent to

the University of Exeter (Cornwall Campus, Penryn, UK)
in dry ice and stored at -80°C prior to RNA extraction.
RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Genomic
DNA contamination was removed by DNAse treatment
(TURBO DNAse, Ambion) for 30 min at 37°C, RNA
was further purified (RNeasy MinElute Clean up Kit,
Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol and
eluted in 20 μl of RNA storage solution (Ambion).
cDNA library preparation, sequence pre-processing and
assembly

Two cDNA libraries were used in order to identify as
many genes encoding detoxification enzymes as possible.
This may have been influenced by differences in gene
expression levels in the two libraries, despite the fact
that both libraries were normalised. Another reason for
the use of the two cDNA libraries was to look for
potential SNPs in target-site genes associated with

insecticide resistance. Full-length, enriched, cDNAs were
generated from 2 μg total RNA (SMART PCR cDNA
synthesis kit, BD Clontech) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using the
PrimeScript reverse transcription enzyme (Takara) for
60 min at 42°C and 90 min at 50°C. In order to reduce
over-abundant transcripts, double-stranded cDNAs were
normalised using the Kamchatka crab duplex-specific
nuclease method (Trimmer cDNA normalisation kit,
Evrogen) [30]. Two aliquots, one of each of the normalised cDNA libraries, were 454 sequenced at the
Advanced Genomics facility at the University of Liverpool. The two cDNA libraries were tagged prior to
sequencing using molecular barcodes (Multiplex Identifiers, Roche Applied Sciences). A single full plate run
(using both the TV1 and TV6 cDNA tagged libraries)
was performed on the 454 GS-FLX Titanium series pyrosequencer (Roche Applied Science) using 3 μg of normalised cDNAs processed by the “shotgun” method. For
raw reads pre-processing (removal of Poly-A tails and
SMART adapters) and assembly, the custom pipeline
est2assembly was used [12]. A pool of the processed
reads from both cDNA libraries (TV1 and TV6) were
clustered using the MIRA v2.9.26x3 assembler with the
“de novo, normal, EST, 454” parameters, specifying a
minimum read length of 40 nt, a minimum sequence
overlap of 40 nt, and a minimum percentage overlap
identity of 80%.

Blast homology searches and sequence annotations were
carried out following a method that was successfully
used for a midgut transcriptome of the tomato hornworm, Manduca sexta Linnaeus (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) [8]. BLAST2GO software v.2.3.1 (http://www.
blast2go.org) was used to perform several analyses of
the EST assembly (contigs) [31]. Initially, homology
searches were performed remotely on the NCBI server
through QBLAST in a sequential strategy. Firstly, contig
sequences were searched via BLASTx against the NCBI
non-redundant (nr) database, using an E-value cut-off of
1E-3 and selecting predicted polypeptides of a minimum
length of 10 amino acids. Secondly, the sequences that
did not receive any BLASTx hit were searched via
BLASTn against the NCBI nr nucleotide database using
an E-value cut-off of 1E-10. Also, BLASTx searches with
an E-value cut-off of 1E-5 were performed against the
D. melanogaster uniprot (100) database. For gene ontology mapping (GO; http://www.geneontology.org), the
program extracts the GO terms associated with homologies identified with NCBI’s QBLAST and returns a list
of GO annotations represented as hierarchical categories
of increasing specificity. BLAST2GO allows the selection
of a significance level for the false discovery rate, here
used at a 0.05% probability level cut-off. GO terms were
modulated using the annotation augmentation tool
ANNEX [32], followed by GOSlim. GOSlim consists of
a subset of the GO vocabulary encompassing key ontological terms and a mapping function between the full
GO and the GOSlim. Here, we used the ‘generic’
GOSlim mapping term (goslim_generic.obo) available in
BLAST2GO. Enzyme classification (EC) codes, and
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
metabolic pathway annotations, were generated from
the direct mapping of GO terms to their enzyme code
equivalents. Finally, InterPro (InterProScan, EBI)
searches were performed remotely from BLAST2GO via
the InterPro EBI web server. Potential ORFs (open reading frames) were identified using the ORF-predictor server (http://proteomics.ysu.edu/tools/OrfPredictor.html)
[33]. An ORF cut-off of 200 bp was used.
Manual curation of genes of interest, phylogenetic
analysis and SNP identification

Contigs that had a protein motif of a cytochrome P450
or a protein domain of a CCE or a GST, as well as contigs that corresponded to the target sites of the most
important chemical classes of insecticides were searched
by BLASTn against all the assembled processed reads
(http://www.rfc.ex.ac.uk/iceblast/iceblast.php) using an
E-value cut-off of 1E -4 . Each contig was reassembled
from the reads that returned a BLAST hit and manually
curated using Geneious software v.4.8.5 (Biomatters Ltd,

Karatolos et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:56
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/56

Auckland, New Zealand), to check for potential
frame-shifts and SNPs. Nucleotide sequences were
dynamic translated using the EXPASY Proteomics Server (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/dna.html, Swiss Institute
of Bioinformatics). All the identified sequences were
searched by BLASTx against all the assembled contigs
in the iceblast server using an E-value cut-off of 1E -4
and the results with more than 99% similarity with the
query sequence were eliminated as allelic variants (note
that from those sequences, only the longest contigs with
the best coverage were manually curated). MEGA
4.0 software [34] was used to perform multiple sequence
alignment of P450s, CCEs, GSTs and nAChRs prior to
phylogenetic analysis and to construct consensus phylogenetic trees using the neighbour-joining method. Bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replication trees was performed
in order to evaluate the branch strength of each tree.
The manually curated re-assembled contigs that
encoded an insecticide target were investigated for the
presence of SNPs arising due to nucleotide divergence
between the two strains.
Sequence submission

The raw nucleotide reads obtained by 454 sequencing
were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database at NCBI with accession number SRA024353.1. An
assembly of the T. vaporariorum data as well as the
unassembled reads was uploaded to the InsectaCentral
database (http://www.insectacentral.org/) and is searchable
by BLAST at the following URL: http://www.rfc.ex.ac.uk/
iceblast/iceblast.php. InsectaCentral is a central repository
of insect transcriptomes, similar to the ButterflyBase, produced using traditional capillary sequencing or 454
pyrosequencing (NGS) [35]. Note that the names of the
validated enzymes (see additional files 5-8) are made
from the letters Tv followed by the number of the contig
from the InsectaCentral database (For example
IC88556AaEcon23678 is called Tv23678).
