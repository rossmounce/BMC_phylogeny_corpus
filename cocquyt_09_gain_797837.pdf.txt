Abstract
Background: Two key genes of the translational apparatus, elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1α) and
elongation factor-like (EFL) have an almost mutually exclusive distribution in eukaryotes. In the
green plant lineage, the Chlorophyta encode EFL except Acetabularia where EF-1α is found, and the
Streptophyta possess EF-1α except Mesostigma, which has EFL. These results raise questions about
evolutionary patterns of gain and loss of EF-1α and EFL. A previous study launched the hypothesis
that EF-1α was the primitive state and that EFL was gained once in the ancestor of the green plants,
followed by differential loss of EF-1α or EFL in the principal clades of the Viridiplantae. In order to
gain more insight in the distribution of EF-1α and EFL in green plants and test this hypothesis we
screened the presence of the genes in a large sample of green algae and analyzed their gain-loss
dynamics in a maximum likelihood framework using continuous-time Markov models.
Results: Within the Chlorophyta, EF-1α is shown to be present in three ulvophycean orders (i.e.,
Dasycladales, Bryopsidales, Siphonocladales) and the genus Ignatius. Models describing gene gainloss dynamics revealed that the presence of EF-1α, EFL or both genes along the backbone of the
green plant phylogeny is highly uncertain due to sensitivity to branch lengths and lack of prior
knowledge about ancestral states or rates of gene gain and loss. Model refinements based on
insights gained from the EF-1α phylogeny reduce uncertainty but still imply several equally likely
possibilities: a primitive EF-1α state with multiple independent EFL gains or coexistence of both
genes in the ancestor of the Viridiplantae or Chlorophyta followed by differential loss of one or the
other gene in the various lineages.
Conclusion: EF-1α is much more common among green algae than previously thought. The
mutually exclusive distribution of EF-1α and EFL is confirmed in a large sample of green plants.
Hypotheses about the gain-loss dynamics of elongation factor genes are hard to test analytically due
to a relatively flat likelihood surface, even if prior knowledge is incorporated. Phylogenetic analysis
of EFL genes indicates misinterpretations in the recent literature due to uncertainty regarding the
root position.

Background
Elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1α) is a core element of the
translation apparatus and member of the GTPase protein
family. The gene has been widely used as a phylogenetic
marker in eukaryotes; either to resolve their early evolution [e.g., [1,2]] or more recent phylogenetic patterns
[e.g., [3-7]]. The evolutionary history of genes used for
such inferences should closely match that of the organisms and not be affected by ancient paralogy or lateral
gene transfer [8]. A gene related to but clearly distinguishable from EF-1α, called elongation factor-like (EFL),
appears to substitute EF-1α in a scattered pattern: several
unrelated eukaryote lineages have representatives that
encode EFL and others that possess EF-1α. The EFL and
EF-1α genes are mutually exclusive in all but two organisms: the zygomycete fungus Basidiobolus and the diatom
Thalassiosira [9,10]. Although EFL is found in several
eukaryotic lineages, EF-1α is thought to be the most abundant of both [11]. So far, EFL has been reported in chromalveolates
(Perkinsus,
dinoflagellates,
diatoms,
haptophytes, cryptophytes), the plant lineage (green and
red algae), rhizarians (cercozoans, foraminifera),
unikonts (some Fungi and choanozoans) and centrohelids [8,10,12-14]].
The mutually exclusive distribution of EF-1α and EFL suggests similar functionality. The main function of EF-1α is
translation initiation and termination, by delivering aminoacyl tRNAs to the ribosomes [15]. Other functions
include interactions with cytoskeletal proteins: transfer,
immobilization and translation of mRNA and involvement in the ubiquitine-dependent proteolytic system, as
such forming an intriguing link between protein synthesis
and degradation [15]. In contrast, the function of EFL is
barely known. It is assumed to have a translational function because the putative EF-1β, aa-tRNA, and GTP/GDP
binding sites do not differ between EF-1α and EFL [8].
Based on a reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR assay in
the diatom Thalassiosira, which possesses both genes, it
was proposed that EFL had a translation function while
EF-1α performed the auxiliary functions [10].
The apparently scattered distribution of EFL across eukaryotes raises questions about the gain-loss patterns of genes
with an important role in the cell. This mutually exclusive
and seemingly scattered distribution can be explained by
two different mechanisms: ancient paralogy and lateral
gene transfer. Ancient paralogy was considered unlikely
because this would imply that both genes were present in
ancestral eukaryotic genomes during extended periods of
evolutionary history while the genes rarely coexist in
extant species [8]. Furthermore, a prolonged coexistence
of both genes in early eukaryotes would have likely
resulted in either functional divergence or pseudogene
formation of one or the other copy [16], as is suggested for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/39

EFL and EF-1α coexisting in the diatom Thalassiosira [10].
Keeling and Inagaki [8] proposed lateral gene transfer of
the EFL gene between eukaryotic lineages as the most
likely explanation for the scattered distribution of both
genes.
In the green plants (Viridiplantae), EF-1α and EFL seem to
show a mutually exclusive distribution. Of the two major
green plant lineages, the Chlorophyta were shown to have
EFL with the exception of Acetabularia where EF-1α is
found, and the Streptophyta were shown to possess EF-1α
with the exception of Mesostigma, which has EFL [13].
Noble et al. [13] proposed the hypothesis that EFL was
introduced once in the ancestor of the green lineage, followed by differential loss of EF-1α or EFL in the principal
clades of the Viridiplantae (i.e., Streptophyta and Chlorophyta).
The goals of the present study are to extend our knowledge of the distribution pattern of EF-1α and EFL in the
green algae and investigate patterns of gain and loss of
these key genes of the translational apparatus. We applied
a RT-PCR and sequencing-based screening approach
across a broad spectrum of green algae, with emphasis on
the ulvophycean relatives of Acetabularia. To test the
hypothesis of Noble et al. [13], we modeled patterns of
gene gain and loss. To this goal, a reference phylogeny
based on three commonly used loci was inferred, and
gain-loss dynamics of EFL and EF-1α were optimized
along this phylogeny using continuous-time Markov
models.

Results and discussion
Distribution of elongation factors in the green algae
EF-1α sequences were retrieved from streptophytes
Entransia (Klebsormidiophyceae) and Chlorokybus (Chlorokybophyceae), confirming previous observations that
all Streptophyta except Mesostigma have EF-1α. We found
EFL sequences in Chlorella (Trebouxiophyceae), Acrochaete
and Bolbocoleon (Ulvophyceae), Nephroselmis and Tetraselmis striata (prasinophytes), further confirming the
formerly established distribution pattern within the Chlorophyta. We reaffirmed the presence of EFL in
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus (Chlorophyceae), Ulva
intestinalis and U. fenestra (Ulvophyceae) and Ostreococcus
(prasinophytes), previously shown by Noble et al. [13]. In
addition to Acetabularia, EF-1α was discovered in representatives of the ulvophycean orders Dasycladales (Bornetella), Bryopsidales (Blastophysa, Bryopsis, Codium,
Derbesia, Ostreobium), Siphonocladales (Boodlea, Cladophora, Dictyosphaeria, Ernodesmis, Phyllodictyon) and in
Ignatius (see Figures 1 and 2). The RT-PCR approach did
not reveal the presence of both genes in any of the
screened species despite the fact that our primers could
amplify the target genes across the Viridiplantae. Our RT-

Phylogenies inferred from EF-1α and EFL amino-acid sequences with Bayesian techniques
Phylogenies inferred from EF-1 and EFL amino-acid sequences with Bayesian techniques. Sequences belonging to
the green plant lineage are in gray boxes. Whereas all green plant EF-1α sequences group in a single clade, the green plant EFL
sequences seem to form separate lineages. Sequences generated for this study are indicated with triangles. Numbers at nodes
indicate posterior probabilities (top) and ML bootstrap values (bottom); values below respectively 0.9 and 50 are not shown.

PCR experiments on two species whose genomes have
been sequenced (Chlamydomonas and Ostreococcus)
yielded a single gene for each species, a result in compliance with the knowledge derived from their genome
sequences [17].

on the reference phylogeny in Figure 1. Mesostigma is the
only streptophyte which encodes EFL. Within the chlorophytan class Ulvophyceae, the order Ulvales possesses EFL
whereas the other orders encode EF-1α (Dasycladales,
Siphonocladales, Bryopsidales and Ignatius).

The reference phylogeny, inferred from a DNA matrix consisting of 72 taxa representing all major plant lineages and
three loci (SSU rDNA, rbcL and atpB), is in accordance
with recent phylogenetic studies, including the position of
Mesostigma within the Streptophyta [18,19]. Figure 1
shows the phylogenetic relationships among the taxa for
which we have information on elongation factors; the full
72-taxon phylogeny can be found as an online supplement [see Additional file 1]. Even though the tree shows
improved resolution from previous studies, large parts of
the backbone remained poorly resolved. In order to
obtain a solid hypothesis of green algal evolution, much
additional sequence data may have to be gathered. The
occurrence of EF-1α and EFL in terminal taxa was plotted

Phylogenies of EF-1 and EFL
All green plant EF-1α sequences form a monophyletic
group clearly differentiated from EF-1α sequences of a
variety of other eukaryotes (Figure 2A). Even though the
Viridiplantae form a strongly supported group, resolution
among and within Streptophyta and Chlorophyta is generally low, which could in part be due to some short EF1α sequences included in the analysis.

In contrast, green plant EFL genes do not form a monophyletic lineage (Figure 2B). Although the backbone of
the phylogeny is moderately resolved, monophyly of
green plant EFL genes is unlikely because it is not observed
in the MCMC output (zero posterior probability). EFL

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:39

sequences of the Viridiplantae can be found in several
clades. The chlorophytes, trebouxiophytes, ulvophytes
and prasinophyte Tetraselmis form a single monophyletic
group. The other prasinophyte EFL sequences form two
separate groups. The last clade consists of the streptophyte
Mesostigma.
To obtain an accurate root position for our EFL tree, we
included related subfamilies of the GTPase translation factor superfamily: EF-1α, eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3),
heat shock protein 70 subfamily B suppressor (HBS1) and
archaebacterial EF-1α sequences in our analyses. In
accordance with Keeling and Inagaki [8], the tree is rooted
with archaebacterial EF-1α sequences. All analyses (Bayesian and ML) resulted in a phylogeny very similar to the
one shown in Figure 2B, the complete phylogeny with all
related subfamilies can be found as an online supplement
[see Additional file 2]. This phylogeny shows seven EFL
clades, with the following branching order: Bigelowiella,
the diatoms, Planoglabratella, the cryptophyte Goniomonas,
red algae, choanozoans, and a large clade containing the
green plant lineage, chromalveolates (dinoflagellates,
haptophytes, cryptophytes), fungi and Rhaphidiophrys
(Figures 2B). Deep branches generally received low statistical support, preventing strong conclusions about the
relationship between the seven clades.
Gain-loss dynamics
The scattered distribution of EF-1α and EFL in the green
plant lineage is a remarkable phenomenon that raises
questions about evolutionary patterns of gain and loss of
both genes.

Noble et al. [13] proposed the hypothesis that EF-1α was
present in the common ancestor of the plant lineage, followed by a single gain of EFL early in evolution of the
green lineage and subsequent differential loss of one or
the other gene in the various lineages. Our aim was to test
this hypothesis by modeling gain-loss dynamics and
inferring ancestral presence-absence patterns of both
genes in a maximum likelihood framework. Gene gain
and loss rates were estimated by maximum likelihood
(ML) optimization, using a dataset of presence-absence
patterns of EF-1α and EFL and a reference phylogeny
derived from the Bayesian analysis of three commonly
used loci (SSU nrDNA, rbcL and atpB).
A first analysis, based on the reference tree, shows uncertain character state probabilities along the backbone of
the Viridiplantae and suggests a loss of EF-1α in early
Chlorophyta evolution and regain in some Ulvophyceae
(Figure 3A). Because branch lengths play a crucial role in
model optimization, the analysis was repeated on an
alternative version of the reference tree in which branch
lengths were transformed using a rate smoothing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/39

approach. Since our tree deviates from the molecular
clock, we performed rate smoothing to obtain branch
lengths roughly proportional to time. Rate smoothing
techniques relax the assumption of constant rates of evolution throughout the tree: differences in rates of molecular evolution are smoothed out by assuming that
evolutionary rates change gradually throughout the phylogeny. The result is an ultrametric tree in which branch
lengths are roughly proportional to evolutionary time
instead of amounts of molecular evolution. Modeling
gain-loss dynamics of elongation factor genes along the
rate-smoothed tree yields results that strongly deviate
from those obtained with the original reference tree: probabilities of the character states along the major part of
backbone are now around 50% for EFL and around 50%
for the presence of both genes (Figure 3B). Subsequently,
an additional level of realism was introduced by taking
phylogenetic uncertainty into account because several
nodes in the reference tree are poorly supported. To this
goal, all post-burnin MCMC trees were rate-smoothed
and analyzed individually. The results were summarized
on the rate-smoothed reference tree. Taking phylogenetic
uncertainty into consideration had a minor influence on
the probabilities of the characters states (Figure 3C).
Although the exact numbers differ between analyses, gene
gain rates were always lower than gene loss rates, reinforcing the notion that gene transfers are rare events in comparison to losses of redundant genes [20]. Whereas the
analysis based on the original reference tree returned
faster gain and loss rates for EFL than for EF-1α, analyses
based on rate-smoothed trees (including MCMC trees)
suggested the inverse, marking the sensitivity of Markov
models to the unit of operational time.
From these results, it seems fair to conclude that there is
major uncertainty about the ancestral states for a variety of
reasons, including sensitivity to branch lengths and lack
of prior knowledge about ancestral states or rates of gene
gain and loss. Considering that the ancestors must have
had either EF-1α, EFL or both genes opens perspectives for
hypothesis comparison in a likelihood framework. Additionally, information about rates of gene gain and loss
could be gleaned from the EF-1α and EFL phylogenies.
Analyses constrained with various hypotheses about
ancestral gene content resulted in a confidence set of 8
trees that differ extensively [see Additional file 3]. The fact
that strongly different hypotheses are also present in the
confidence set denotes that the likelihood surface is too
flat to draw firm conclusions in favor of one or another
hypothesis.
The last option to reduce uncertainty is to inform the
Markov models with information on gains and losses

Gain-loss dynamics of green algal elongation factor genes and their inferred presence in ancestral genomes
Gain-loss dynamics of green algal elongation factor genes and their inferred presence in ancestral genomes.
Gain and loss rates, as well as the estimated probabilities for presence of the genes in ancestral genomes are given for a variety
of analysis conditions. Panels A-C show the outcome of models in which EF-1α and EFL gain and loss rates were not constrained. In panels D-F, the gain rate of EF-1α was constrained to be 10-6. Colors were used to visualize estimated probabilities
for presence of genes along the tree. Red indicates a high probability for EF-1α, blue marks a high probability of EFL and yellow
stands for a high probability of the presence of both genes. Intermediate colors indicate uncertainty.

gleaned from the EF-1α and EFL trees [cf. [20]]. Because
green plant EF-1α sequences form a monophyletic and
strongly supported lineage, it seems fair to assume vertical
descent of EF-1α throughout the Viridiplantae. This
knowledge can be introduced in our Markov model by setting a very low gain rate of EF-1α. If the analysis is constrained in this way, both EFL and EF-1α were inferred to
be present along the backbone of the Viridiplantae in the
original reference tree (Figure 3D) and a 50/50 probability for the presence of EF-1α or both genes was obtained
in the rate-smoothed trees (Figures 3E–F). Comparison of
hypotheses about ancestral gene content constrained with
a very low EF-1α gain rate reduced the confidence set to 3
trees in which either EF-1α or both genes are present along
the backbone [see Additional file 4]. The ML solution
(hypothesis 122) assumes that only EF-1α was present
along the backbone of the tree and consequently shows
independent gains of EFL in Mesostigma, prasinophytes,
Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvales. An alternative scenario (hypothesis 123) in the confidence set has
EF-1α at the base of the Viridiplantae, a gain of EFL in the
ancestor of the Chlorophyta, and subsequent differential
loss of one or the other gene in the various lineages. Information from the EFL phylogeny may provide clues for further distinction between either multiple transfers or
ancient paralogy with subsequent losses.
The green EFL sequences form a highly supported clade
together with dinoflagellates, cryptophytes, haptophytes,
fungi and Rhaphidiophrys, suggesting lateral gene transfer
of the EFL gene between these distant eukaryotic lineages
[21,22]. Considering the ability of chromalveolates (i.e.,
dinoflagellates, cryptophytes and haptophytes) and
Raphidiophrys to feed through phagocytosis [23] and the
absence of this behavior in green algae, it would be tempting to assume that lateral gene transfer occurred from
green algae to the dinoflagellates, cryptophytes, haptophytes and Raphidiophrys instead of the other way around.
Phagotrophic eukaryotes have been shown to have elevated rates of lateral gene transfer [21,24] because this
feeding mechanism enables them to continually recruit
genes from engulfed prey [25]. Lateral gene transfers to
fungi, although known to exist [26], would require a different explanation because neither phagotrophy nor
endosymbiosis occur in fungi. However, in the light of
this peripheral information, it would be tempting to conclude that both EF-1α and EFL essentially show vertical
descent in green plants and that the observed mutually
exclusive pattern of EFL and EF-1α sequences results from
differential loss. In this scenario, lateral gene transfer must
have occurred from green algal cells to other eukaryotic
lineages.
In previous studies of functionally similar eukaryotic
genes with mutually exclusive distributions, distinction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/39

between ancient paralogy with subsequent losses and
multiple transfers was made based on two main criteria
[11]. The first criterion states that if one gene dominates
the tree and the other occurs in only a few lineages, multiple independent transfers should be regarded as the
most probable explanation whereas equal representation
would suggest common ancestry with subsequent differential loss. The second criterion is about the age of the
taxa involved. If the mutually exclusive pattern occurs
between closely related species, one can conclude common ancestry with subsequent losses. If the pattern is
more ancient, multiple lateral transfers are a more probable explanation. It is obvious that such criteria are very difficult to apply in real situations. These difficulties can be
overcome by taking a probabilistic angle on the problem
and modeling gain-loss dynamics with continuous-time
Markov models. This approach brings statistical rigor to
the analysis of gene presence-absence patterns and has the
potential to discriminate between the alternative scenarios of ancient paralogy with differential losses and multiple independent lateral transfers. Application of this
technique to our dataset of green algal elongation factors
revealed the difficulty of arriving at firm conclusions
about ancient gene transfer events because of a relatively
flat likelihood surface and, consequently, ambiguous
probabilities for gene content at ancestral nodes. When
informed with external information, the analyses allow
somewhat more definitive conclusions.
The broader eukaryotic picture
In addition to the information gained about elongation
factor evolution in green algae, our results also highlight
misinterpretations in recent literature on EFL evolution
across the eukaryotes. Previous studies have not been
explicit about whether or how their phylogenetic trees
were rooted, but have drawn conclusions that require
directionality in the tree. Kamikawa et al. [10] concluded
that lateral gene transfer from a foraminifer (Planoglabratella) to the ancestor of the diatoms must have occurred
because the diatom sequences were nested within the
Rhizaria (foraminifera and cercozoans). In case their tree
was unrooted, this conclusion is flawed due to a lack of
directionality in the tree. In their presentation of the tree,
choanozoans are used as one of the basal clades, probably
because they were the earliest-branching lineage in the
tree presented by Keeling and Inagaki [8]. Our EFL tree,
which includes EF-1α, eRF3 and HBS1 sequences and is
rooted with archaebacterial EF-1α sequences, indicates
that the directionality inferred by Kamikawa et al. [10] is
likely to be wrong. Our phylogram (Figures 2B) suggest
that the root position of EFL lies on the branch leading
towards the cercozoan Bigelowiella, but support is lacking
for the basal relationships. A plot of the posterior distribution of root placements (Figure 4) illustrates the uncertainty about the root placement more clearly. It is evident

previously published hypothesis [13] is as likely as several
other hypotheses. Model refinements based on insights
gained from the EF-1α phylogeny were unable to distinguish between three possibilities: (1) multiple, independent gains of EFL throughout the plant lineage, (2) a single
gain of EFL early in evolution of the plant lineage followed by differential loss, or (3) independent gains of EFL
in Mesostigma and the ancestor of the Chlorophyta followed by differential loss of one or the other gene in the
various lineages (Figure 3D–F and Additional file 4).
Further research into the gain-loss dynamics of elongation
factors of green plants and eukaryotes in general is needed
to come to more definitive conclusions about their evolution. First, the EFL phylogeny should be refined by obtaining full-length sequences for a set of relevant taxa to
confirm or reject the presence of multiple independent
green lineages in this tree. The use of codon models may
help to achieve this [27]. An alternative approach would
be to learn about the processes responsible for lateral
transfer of elongation factors by studying their flanking
regions for signature sequences of mobile elements
[28,29]. Finally, studying gain-loss dynamics across a
wider spectrum of eukaryotic supergroups should lead to
more stable conclusions. In addition to yielding more precise parameter estimates for gene gain and loss rates, a
eukaryote-wide study would allow the use of more specific models for lateral gene transfer because both donor
and recipient lineages would be present in the analysis
[30-32]. It remains an enigma that the evolution of elongation factors, genes crucial for cell functioning, is marked
by such complex gain-loss patterns.

Methods
from this plot that the choanozoans are not the oldest
diverging lineage. This finding overturns the conclusion
from Kamikawa et al. [10] because the nested position of
the diatom EFL genes within the Rhizaria sequences can
no longer be maintained. Our EFL phylogeny supports the
presence of lateral gene transfer between eukaryotic lineages, however, the direction of lateral gene transfer is difficult to evaluate.

Algal strains
Algal strain information is provided as additional material
online [see Additional file 5]. All cultures were grown at
18°C, except Dasycladales, Siphonocladales and Derbesia
(23°C). Cool white fluorescent lamps were used for a 12/
12 h light/dark cycle. Marine cultures were maintained in
f/2 medium and freshwater cultures in Bold's Basal
Medium [33].

Conclusion

RNA isolation and cDNA library construction of
Cladophora coelothrix
Total RNA was extracted with a RNeasy Plant Mini Kit
(Qiagen Benelux b.v., Venlo, the Netherlands) or a NucleoSpin® RNA Plant kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG,
Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, including a DNase step to eliminate genomic DNA
contamination. RNA quality was checked on a 1% agarose
gel (made with 1× TAE diluted in 0,1% DEPC water). RNA
concentration and purity were measured in a spectrophotometer at 260 and 280 nm according to standard methods [34].

The mutually exclusive nature of EF-1α and EFL is confirmed in a large sample of green algae. The Streptophyta
possess EF-1α with the exception of Mesostigma, which has
EFL. The Chlorophyta encode EFL with the exception of
Dasycladales, Bryopsidales, Siphonocladales and Ignatius,
where EF-1α is found. This result establishes EF-1α as a
widespread gene among green algae.
Gain-loss models revealed that the probabilities of the
presence of EF-1α, EFL or both genes along the backbone
of the plant phylogeny are highly uncertain, and that a

Approximately 30 μg of total RNA of Cladophora coelothrix
was extracted as described above. A standard cDNA library
was constructed by VERTIS Biotechnologie AG (Freising,
Germany). An EF-1α sequence of 624 bp was obtained by
sequencing randomly picked clones.
Reverse Transcriptase and Polymerase Chain Reaction
cDNA construction was performed with the Omniscript
RT kit (Qiagen) and oligodT primers according to the
manufacturer's instructions; the reaction was incubated
for several hours at 37°C.

Primers were designed to fit the most conserved regions of
EF-1α and EFL sequences across Viridiplantae. Primers for
EF-1α were based upon aligned GenBank sequences from
green algae (Acetabularia and Chara) and land plants,
completed with our Cladophora coelothrix cDNA sequence
(EF-1α-F: 5'-GGC CAT CTT ATC TAC AAG CTT GGC GG3' and EF-1α-R: 5'-CCA GGA GCA TCA ATC ACG GTG
CAG-3'). EFL primers were adapted from Noble et al. [13]
(EFL-F: 5'-TCC ATY GTS ATY TGC GGN CAY GTC GA-3'
and EFL-R: 5'-CTT GAT GTT CAT RCC RAC RTT GTC RCC3'). PCR amplification was performed with the following
reaction mixture: 1 μl of cDNA, 2.5 μl of 10× Buffer (Qiagen), 0.5 μl dNTP's (10 mM), 0.5 μl MgCl (25 mM, Qiagen), 0.5 μl of each primer (10 μm), 0.25 μl BSA (10 μg/
μl), 18.125 μl sterilized MilliQ water and 0.125 μl Taq
polymerase (5 U/μl, Qiagen). The amplification profile
consisted of an initial denaturation of 2 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C and 45 s
at 72°C and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. Products
of expected size (300 bp for EF-1α and 900 bp for EFL)
were either sequenced directly or cloned and sequenced.
Cloning and sequencing
PCR products were first sequenced with the forward
primer with an Applied Biosystems 3130xl. Sequences
were blasted against the GenBank protein database
(blastx), to check for potential bacterial contaminants.
Sequences without ambiguous base calls yielding a significant hit for Viridiplantae were further sequenced with the
reverse primer. When ambiguous base calls were present
in sequences, samples were cloned if the rough sequence
gave a significant blastx hit for Viridiplantae. Cloning was
performed with the pGEM®-T Vector System (Promega
Benelux b.v., Leiden, the Netherlands) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. After ligation, transformation and incubation, the white colonies were transferred
to 15 μl double distilled water, boiled for 10 minutes to
lyse cells and subsequently centrifuged to pellet the cells
walls and allow harvest of the DNA in the liquid phase.
Between three and five clones were PCR amplified and
sequenced with the vector specific primers T7 and SP6 following the protocol described above. Cloning showed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/39

minor polymorphisms that most likely represent different
alleles.
Alignments and phylogenetic analysis of EF-1 and EFL
Sequences [see Additional file 6] were assembled with
AutoAssembler 1.4.0 (ABI Prism, Perkin Elmer, Foster
City, CA, USA) and aligned manually for both genes separately, resulting in EF-1α and EFL alignments of 1374
and 1653 bp, respectively [see Additional file 7].
Sequences generated with our primers begin in the N-terminal part the of the gene and are 900 bp for EFL and
150–300 bp for EF-1α. We included eukaryotic EF-1α,
eRF3 and HBS1 sequences as well as archeabacterial EF-1α
sequences to serve as outgroups for the EFL phylogeny [8].
Due to the large divergences between EFL and the other
genes, Gblocks was run to remove ambiguously aligned
regions [35]. We ran Gblocks v.0.91b, allowing smaller
final blocks, gap positions within the final blocks and less
strict flanking positions, resulting in an alignment of 358
amino acids [see Additional file 7]. The resulting EFL and
EF-1α alignments were subjected to Bayesian phylogenetic inference with MrBayes 3.1.2 [36] using the model
suggested by ProtTest 1.4 [37] (WAG with among site rate
heterogeneity: gamma distribution with 8 categories).
Two parallel runs, each consisting of four incrementally
heated chains were run for 1,000,000 generations, sampling every 1,000 generations. Convergence of log-likelihoods was assessed in Tracer v1.4 [38]. A burnin sample
of 100 trees was removed before constructing the majority
rule consensus tree for each of the genes. Maximum likelihood phylogenies were inferred for EF-1α and EFL with
Treefinder [39]. The analyses were based on amino acid
sequences and used a WAG model with among site rate
heterogeneity (gamma distribution with 8 categories).
One thousand non-parametric bootstrap trees were
inferred. Bootstrap values were summarized with consense from the Phylip package [40] and plotted onto the
Bayesian consensus tree.
Phylogeny of the green plants: SSU rDNA, rbcL and atpB
A reference phylogeny of green plants for which the presence of EF-1α or EFL is known was constructed using three
commonly used phylogenetic markers: nuclear SSU rDNA
and plastid atpB and rbcL genes and rooted with red algae
and a glaucophyte. To obtain an even species distribution
and consequently a better phylogenetic tree [41], many
additional species were included in the phylogenetic analysis [see Additional file 7]. Sequences were retrieved from
GenBank and aligned with our own sequences [see Additional file 6]. DNA was extracted using a standard CTAB
method. PCR conditions followed standard protocol.
Primers were based on other publications: SSU rDNA
[42,43], rbcL [44] and atpB [45,46]. The rbcL and atpB
sequences were aligned by eye. The SSU rDNA sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/39

were aligned based on their RNA secondary structure with
DCSE [see Additional file 8].
The model selection procedure [see Additional file 8] proposed eight partitions: atpB and rbcL genes were partitioned into codon positions (6 partitions) and the SSU
rDNA was partitioned into RNA loops and stems (2 partitions). Bayesian phylogenetic inference was carried out
using a GTR model with gamma distribution and 8 rate
categories per partition (all parameters unlinked) and rate
multipliers to accommodate rate differences among partitions. Two parallel runs, each consisting of four incrementally heated chains were run for 5,000,000 generations,
sampling every 1,000 generations. Convergence of loglikelihoods was assessed in Tracer v1.4 [38]. A burnin
sample of 3,000 trees was removed before constructing
the majority rule consensus tree. A maximum likelihood
phylogeny was inferred with Treefinder [39]. The analysis
used a GTR model with among site rate heterogeneity
(gamma distribution with 8 categories). One thousand
non-parametric bootstrap trees were inferred. Bootstrap
values were summarized with consense from the Phylip
package [40] and plotted onto the Bayesian consensus
tree.
To obtain trees suitable for modeling gene gain and loss,
the Bayesian consensus tree and the complete post-burnin
set of trees were pruned to the set of species for which the
type of elongation factor is known using the APE package
[47]. Because our data deviate from the molecular clock,
we performed rate smoothing to obtain branch lengths
that are roughly proportional to time. We used the penalized likelihood method [48] implemented in the r8s program [49], with a log-additive penalty and a smoothing
value of 2, which was the optimal value in cross-validation [48]. PL rate smoothing was applied to the Bayesian
consensus tree as well as the post-burnin set of MCMC
trees.
Modeling gene gain and loss
If the presence of EF-1α and EFL are coded as two binary
characters, their gain-loss dynamics can be modeled along
a reference phylogeny using a continuous-time Markov
model. Given the likely dependency of gain and loss
between EF-1α and EFL, a model designed to study interdependent trait evolution was used [50]. The rate matrix
of this model is given by:

0, 0 0, 1 1, 0 1, 1

where (0,0) indicates the absence of both genes from the
genome, (0,1) and (1,0) denote the presence of EFL and
EF-1α, respectively, and (1,1) is the state where both genes
are present in the genome. Different q's indicate relative
rates of the respective changes in gene content. Transitions
that require more than one event (e.g. 1,0 → 0,1) are not
allowed to occur as a single step in this model, the logic
being that the probability of two traits changing at exactly
the same time is negligible. This is consistent with the fact
that transitions from EF-1α to EFL and vice versa should
pass through a stage where both genes are present in the
genome. The elements of the diagonal are determined by
the requirement that each row sums to zero. Because the
absence of both genes is likely to be lethal, the matrix was
constrained by introducing a series of very low rates as follows:

⎛ ⋅
10 −6 10 −6

(2)

In this matrix, gEF1α and gEFL denote gain rates and lEF1α and
lEFL loss rates. It must be noted that the model does not
take gene duplications into account because our data provided no indications for the presence of such events.
The rate matrix (2) was specified as a special case of the
"discrete dependent" model in BayesTraits [51]. The
model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) optimization, using a dataset of presenceabsence patterns of EF-1α and EFL. One hundred optimization attempts were carried out to find the ML solution.
Ancestral state probabilities were calculated using the
addNode command. The reference phylogeny used for
inferring patterns of gain and loss was derived from the
Bayesian analysis of SSU nrDNA, rbcL and atpB, and was
varied as follows. First, the majority rule consensus tree
provided by MrBayes was used. Second, a rate-smoothed
version of this consensus tree was used to have branch
lengths roughly proportional to evolutionary time. Third,
topological uncertainty was introduced in the analysis by
repeating analyses on the entire post-burnin set of MCMC
trees after they had been rate-smoothed. For the analysis
on MCMC trees, ancestral state probabilities were calculated with the addMRCA instead of the addNode command. Rate estimates and ancestral state probabilities
were averaged across the MCMC trees. We opted not to
use BayesTraits' Bayesian inference because we found its
output to be strongly influenced by prior settings.
In addition to these analyses, several specific hypotheses
about ancestral genome content (EFL, EF-1α or both)
were compared using ML optimization on the rate-

smoothed reference tree. Constraints on ancestral genome
content were placed on 5 ancestral nodes with the fossil
command in BayesTraits, resulting in 35 = 243 hypotheses
for which the log-likelihoods could be compared. Only
hypotheses within two log-likelihood units from the ML
solution were retained for interpretation. This set of
hypotheses can be seen as a confidence set because two
log-likelihood units is considered a significance threshold
for such analyses [52].
