Abstract
Background: The SARS coronavirus is the etiologic agent for the epidemic of the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome. The recent emergence of this new pathogen, the careful tracing of its
transmission patterns, and the ability to propagate in culture allows the exploration of the
mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV in human populations.
Methods: We sequenced complete SARS-CoV genomes taken from primary human tissues
(SIN3408, SIN3725V, SIN3765V), cultured isolates (SIN848, SIN846, SIN842, SIN845, SIN847,
SIN849, SIN850, SIN852, SIN3408L), and five consecutive Vero cell passages (SIN2774_P1,
SIN2774_P2, SIN2774_P3, SIN2774_P4, SIN2774_P5) arising from SIN2774 isolate. These
represented individual patient samples, serial in vitro passages in cell culture, and paired human and
cell culture isolates. Employing a refined mutation filtering scheme and constant mutation rate
model, the mutation rates were estimated and the possible date of emergence was calculated.
Phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover molecular relationships between the isolates.
Results: Close examination of whole genome sequence of 54 SARS-CoV isolates identified before
14th October 2003, including 22 from patients in Singapore, revealed the mutations engendered
during human-to-Vero and Vero-to-human transmission as well as in multiple Vero cell passages in
order to refine our analysis of human-to-human transmission. Though co-infection by different
quasipecies in individual tissue samples is observed, the in vitro mutation rate of the SARS-CoV in
Vero cell passage is negligible. The in vivo mutation rate, however, is consistent with estimates of
other RNA viruses at approximately 5.7 × 10-6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day (0.17
mutations per genome per day), or two mutations per human passage (adjusted R-square =
0.4014). Using the immediate Hotel M contact isolates as roots, we observed that the SARS

epidemic has generated four major genetic groups that are geographically associated: two
Singapore isolates, one Taiwan isolate, and one North China isolate which appears most closely
related to the putative SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet. Non-synonymous mutations are
centered in non-essential ORFs especially in structural and antigenic genes such as the S and M
proteins, but these mutations did not distinguish the geographical groupings. However, no nonsynonymous mutations were found in the 3CLpro and the polymerase genes.
Conclusions: Our results show that the SARS-CoV is well adapted to growth in culture and did
not appear to undergo specific selection in human populations. We further assessed that the
putative origin of the SARS epidemic was in late October 2002 which is consistent with a recent
estimate using cases from China. The greater sequence divergence in the structural and antigenic
proteins and consistent deletions in the 3' – most portion of the viral genome suggest that certain
selection pressures are interacting with the functional nature of these validated and putative ORFs.

Background
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first
reported in November 2002 and rapidly spread to a
number of distant global regions by early 2003. A new
coronavirus, the SARS-CoV, was identified to be the cause
of SARS [1,2] and was rapidly sequenced and characterized [3,4]. SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive strand RNA
virus with a wide host range. Recombination and mutation rates of RNA viruses are high, several orders of magnitude higher than DNA based microbes and in
eukaryotes, and have been the cause of rapid changes in
antigenicity, virulence, and drug sensitivity. Thus, the
direct estimate of the mutation rates of the SARS-CoV in
human populations and the analysis of the mutational
spectrum would aid in developing strategies for monitoring and therapy.
Previously, our analysis of 14 SARS sequences (five of
which originated from Singapore) in May 2003 indicated
that there are two different genotypes circulating in the
world [5]. Recently, there has been a substantial increase
in the number of SARS-CoV genomes sequenced. A total
of 54 SARS-CoV genomic sequences (37 from the public
database prior to October 14, 2003 and 17 sequenced
within our institute) are used in our current analysis. This
large dataset coupled with the availability of clinical data
for cases related to Singapore patients and our molecular
observations during in vitro cell passage presents an
opportunity for a comprehensive analysis of the SARSCoV mutational behavior.

Methods
Viral RNA genome isolation and sequencing
SARS-CoV from the primary patient tissues were isolated
by homogenizing the tissues in PBS buffer followed by a
low speed centrifugation to obtain the viral particle containing supernatant. The virus-containing samples were
also inoculated into Vero cell E6. The cells were maintained at 37°C using the usual viral cell culture media,
and repassaged after 7 days of incubation. The virus-con-

taining supernatants of homogenize or different passages
of Vero cell E6 showing CPE were centrifuged at 23,000
RCF for 2.5 hours to pellet the viral particles and followed
by RNA extraction using the QiAmp viral RNA mini kit
(Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com). The RNA genome
templates were converted into double strand cDNA and
sequenced as previously described [5]. The processing of
raw sequence reads (base calling, assembly, and editing)
was done using PHRED/PHRAP/CONSED (University of
Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, http://www.phrap.org).
Genotype determination using MassArray technology
A number of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were further confirmed using a sensitive Mass Spectrometry based
genotyping assay that was developed within our institute
[6]. The RNA of the virus was first isolated using QiAmp
viral RNA mini kit and then reverse-transcribed into
cDNA (using the RNA as template, SuperScript kit from
Invitrogen, and sequence specific primers), which were
further purified. Primer extension assays were carried out
for the SNVs of interest. The extension products were then
detected in the MassARRAY (from Sequenom) to determine the genotypes.
Data and statistical analysis
We aligned the 54 SARS-CoV genomes using CLUSTALW
[7]. To minimize the effect of sequencing errors and other
artefacts to our analysis, we employed a filtering scheme
where only SNVs shared by more than two different isolates are kept. The phylogenetic trees were reconstructed
using the filtered variations. The reconstruction was done
using PAUP* [8] with Maximum Likelihood criterion,
keeping the other parameters to the default.

The significance of the variations that pass the proposed
mutation filter (where only mutations shared by more
than 2 out of 54 isolates are considered real) can be
assessed by calculating the probability that a random
noise would meet the filtering criterion. The null hypothesis is that the noisy variations are generated

passages, nucleotide heterogeneity was observed (initially through capillary sequencing and confirmed using MassARRAY genotyping)
at nucleotide position 18356. Presence of single nucleotide heterogeneities (SNHs) indicates coexistence of multiple SARS-CoV isolate
in the Vero cell culture.

independently between genomes. Let q be the rate of
noisy mutation in a genome (based on our findings, as
reported earlier in the text, we conservatively set
2
q≈
, i.e. about two per SARS-CoV genome). The
30000
probability that, at a given nucleotide, a noisy mutation is
shared by exactly i out of m different isolates is
m
r(i, m) =   qi (1 − q)(m−i) . Thus, the probability that a
 i 
given nucleotide position has an erroneous mutation
k
shared by more than k isolates is s(k, m) = 1 − ∑ r(i, m) . In
i =0
a genome with n bases, applying the Bonferroni inequalities, the probability that at least one position is corrupted
by noise more than k times is p(k,n,m) ≤ n × s(k,m). In the
case of 54 SARS-CoV genomes analyzed in this paper,
2
, m = 54, k = 2, n = 30000, and hence the pq≈
30000
value of mutations that satisfy the filter is ≤ 2.2 × 10-4.
In the estimation of SARS-CoV daily mutation rate, we
employed the conservative constant mutation rate model
[9], where the number of mutations d found in an isolate
from its ancestor is proportional to the mutation rate k
and the temporal difference t between the isolate and its
ancestor, so that d = k × t. Based on the Singapore patients
contact tracing information (see Figure 4), we obtained 6
pairs of isolates with known definite ancestor-descendant
relationship, calculated the number of mutations (d) and
the time difference (t) for each pair, and estimate the
mutation rate k for the model using least square fitting.
The goodness-of-fit were measured using the adjusted Rsquare statistics.
Another pertinent question in the analysis of SARS-CoV
evolution is prediction of the possible date of origin of the
human SARS-CoV. Based on the animal-origin hypothesis
of SARS-CoV, we assumed the SARS-CoV isolated from
palm civet cat as the putative principal isolate that
infected the human population. Adhering to the constant
mutation rate model, we fit the following model: dx = d0 +
kx, where k is the daily rate of mutation, x is the sampling
date measured relative to 1st November 2002, and dx is the
number of mutations, as compared to the civet cat isolate,
of the isolate sampled at date x. Twelve data points were

calculated and used to fit the model. The date of origin
can be solved by solving x for dx = 0. The goodness-of-fit
was measured using the adjusted R-square statistic.

Results and discussion
SARS-CoV mutations in vitro
First, we sought to determine the rate of mutation of the
SARS-CoV in Vero cell culture. To achieve this, we subjected SIN2774 isolate to 5 passages in Vero cells. At the
appearance of cytolysis at each passage samples were
withdrawn and their genomes completely sequenced. Any
ambiguities by capillary sequencing were clarified by mass
spectroscopic validation [6]. Our results showed that the
Vero cell passages are actually comprised of two coexisting
quasispecies bearing either an A or G at position 18372.
No mutations emerged upon passage, and the ratio of A/
G at 18372 remained constant over the passages (Table 1).
This suggests that the mutation rate in culture of SARSCoV is very low at <1 in 5 passages. Thus artificial mutations from limited in vitro cell culture are negligible.
Mutations associated with human-to-Vero and Vero-tohuman transition
Next, we asked whether the transition from human tissue
to growth in Vero cell culture engendered either mutations or clonal selection. The SARS-CoV were sequenced
from three human tissue-Vero cell culture pairs of viral
samples from Singapore and one pair was obtained from
the public domain (see supplemental information, Table
S1). The results shown in Table 2 showed that mutations
emerged in only one case of human to Vero cell passage
posted in Genbank (AS → HSR1) but in none of the Singapore pairs. However, the viral sequence from SIN3725V
isolated from a lung sample showed evidence for co-infection by two distinct genotypes of SARS CoV. This was
manifested by the simultaneous presence of T and C at
positions 548, 1727, 13347, confirmed by genotyping
using MALDI-TOF MassARRAY technology. Subsequent
deconvolution by tracing the "haplotypes" at these loci in
different Singaporean isolates revealed probable sequence
signatures of T, T, C at these locations in one isolate and

Singapore encountered an unusual incident where a stable lab SARS-CoV isolate commonly used for in vitro
experimentation accidentally infected a laboratory worker
[10]. We sequenced both the originating laboratory isolate (SIN_WNV; see Table S1) and the viral sample directly
from the patient's sputum (SIN0409; see Table S2) and
found no sequence difference between the two viruses.
This reconfirms that the mutation rate from a single point
source of virus has a low mutation rate when expanded
during human infection.
Sequence variation filter
Inferring phylogenetic relationships between the known
SARS-CoV isolates using existing public data has been
problematic because of the potential for sequencing
errors. Moreover, the rate of SARS-CoV mutation in culture was not previously known and was thought to be significant given the mutation rates in other RNA viruses.
Our experiments provided information as to the potential
causes and rates of sequence variations of the SARS-CoV
in culture. Based on our Vero cells passages and humanto-Vero transition data, we estimated that, at most, one
sequence variation from the original tissue virus can be
accounted for by in vitro culture artifacts. The average
base-calling error probability (as reported by PHREP [11])
of our sequences is about 7.5 × 10-5, or 2.25 errors per
SARS-CoV genome. Accordingly, we suspected that
sequencing errors in the reported SARS sequences would
be approximately 1–2 bases per reported genome. We
used this information to assess the true sequence variants

SIN3725V has two SARS-CoV quasispecies, the isolate
after subsequent Vero cell culture showed only one (bearing the T, T, C haplotype, supplemental information,
Table S2). These results again show that coinfection by
multiple quasispecies is not uncommon in human tissues,
and that passage to Vero cells may either generate new
mutations at a low rate, or titrates out one quasispecies in
the transition.

reported in the public SARS sequence databases employing a "mutation filter" [5]. This mutation filter identifies a
sequence variant as a probable mutation if it appeared in
more than one isolate. Higher filter stringency can be
applied by demanding a sequence variant to be present in
two, three, or more isolates. A total of 54 isolates were
analyzed, including 22 from Singapore. Our results show
that the number of mutations appearing in only one isolate is high at 349 (see supplementary Table S3); however,

pected that true non-synonymous mutations in the SARSCoV present in clinical samples might be rare in these two
ORFs in comparison to other structural genes such as
those encoding the S, M, and N proteins. Without a mutation filter, sequence variations are commonly observed in
the 3CL protease and the polymerase genes. However,
when mutations are identified only as variants seen in two
or more isolates, then no mutations are detected in the
critical 3CL protease and polymerase genes, whereas
mutations are noted in the S, M, and N genes regardless of
the filter stringency (Figure 2). Therefore, we determined
that the most effective mutation filter is presence of a
sequence variant in more than two isolates.

those mutations present in more than two isolates are
much lower and appeared relatively stable (Figure 1). Statistical analysis confirmed that the probability of finding
any false mutation shared by more than two isolates out
of 54 is very low (p ≤ 2.2e - 4) as compared to the probability of finding a false mutation shared by more than one
isolate (p ≤ 0.19). These results are consistent with our
error estimates as outlined above.
We tested the biological validity of this approach by examining the mutational frequency of known genes in the
SARS genome. Because of the importance of the 3CL protease and the polymerase for viral replication, we sus-

Molecular history of the viral isolates
Using this filter stringency, we assessed the phylogenetic
relationship between all 54 isolates describing the recent
SARS epidemic. TOR2, Urbani, SIN2500, HKU-39849,
CUHK-Su10 formed the core of the early isolates.
Employing these as "root", four major clusters appeared:
two Singaporean branches, one Taiwan branch, and one
North China branch (Figure 3). Validating these clusters,
the two sequences from Germany, 'Frankfurt' and FRA,
which grouped with the Singaporean branch, were actually derived from the Singaporean doctor who treated the
patient SIN2774 and was later hospitalized in Frankfurt.
Of the Singaporean cases, SIN2500, SIN2677, SIN2748,
and SIN2774 formed one molecular sub-branch which
matched with the contact tracing (Figure 4). The clinical
contact tracing data was ambiguous as to the direct source
of SIN2679's exposure. Intriguingly, however, SIN2679
was the root of a second sub-branch within Singapore that
had its origins most probably from the Hotel M cluster.
This suggested a potential direct infection of SIN2679
from a Hotel M source other than SIN2500. Using the
same contact tracing information, we calculated the
average mutation rate during human transmission to be
about two mutations per human transmission.
Estimation of the mutation rate of the SARS-CoV
We obtained the precise dates of symptom onset of 13
Singaporean cases (Table S1). Using the common mutations identified through application of the mutation filter,
we employed the constant mutation rate model and estimated the mutation rate of the SARS-CoV during this
recent epidemic. We estimated the mutation rate to be
0.1722 nucleotides per day, or 5.7 × 10-6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day (adjusted R-square value of the
fitted model = 0.4014). The rates for synonymous and
non-synonymous mutations were equivalent at 2.5 × 10-6
and 3.2 × 10-6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day
respectively. Using the Singapore isolates with known
date of onset, and using the SZ3 and SZ16 genomes isolated from palm civet cat [12] as the putative "original"
SARS-CoV that jumped from animal to human, we calcu-

lated the daily substitution rate to be 0.1303 nucleotides
per day, or 4.3 × 10-6 nucleotide substitutions per site per
day, (adjusted R-square = 0.5880) and the estimated
possible "date" of SZ3/SZ16 emergence was Oct 21, 2002.
Overall, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV appears to be consistent with the reported rate of other viruses [13,14].
The mutational analysis also revealed 5 separate deletions
and one insertion that distinguished the different isolates
(Figure 5). Intriguingly, they all clustered within a short
200 bp region in the 3' end of the viral genome spanning
putative ORFs sars 7b to sars 8b. Despite the overlapping
nature of some of the deletions, there was no descendent
relationship amongst them and the addition of the insertion/deletion information did not add to the clustering.
Our assumption therefore is that this is a region of relative
instability that is dispensable for viral replication.

Conclusions
The focus of this investigation was to measure the mutational frequency and dynamics both in vitro and in vivo
of the SARS-CoV. Our findings suggest that the overall
SARS-CoV's rate of mutation in culture is low. Inoculation
of Human SARS-CoV into Vero cell introduces, on the
average, less than one nucleotide mutation. Subsequent

culturing of SARS-CoV infected Vero cells induced less
than one nucleotide mutation in the five consecutive Vero
cell passages. No mutations were also observed during the
infection of SARS-CoV cultured in Vero cell to human.
This would be consistent with the notion that the SARSCoV isolates from the patients that gave rise to the in vitro
lines are well adapted for in vitro growth.
Our proposed mutation filter, which is based on these
observations, seems to be stable and effective. Using this
filter, reconstruction of molecular phylogenetic relations
of the 54 SARS-CoV genomes revealed at least three major
branches composed of cases related to Hotel M (Hong
Kong), cases reported in North China, and cases found in
Taiwan. Moreover, we show that these molecular
sequence associations can be effectively used to more precisely reconstruct contact tracing. Our estimated the daily
substitution rate of SARS-CoV to be 0.1722 nucleotides,
or 5.7 × 10-6 nucleotide substitutions per site, a mutation
rate similar to other RNA viruses [13,14]. Taking the
SARS-CoV isolated from palm civet cat as the putative
originating SARS-CoV, our calculations suggest that the
earliest possible date for SARS emergence is predicted to
be Oct 21, 2002. During the final preparation of this manuscript two reports were published addressing the muta-

tion rate of the SARS-CoV in human populations. Yeh et.
al. [15], examining Taiwanese SARS samples estimated the
CoV mutation rate to be about 1.83 × 10-6 nucleotides per
site per day. The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology
Consortium [16], examining a larger number of viral
isolates, recently determined the mutation rate to be 8.26
× 10-6 nucleotides per site per day using samples from
China. These estimates were very close to ours. In addition, The Chinese Consortium [16] projected the time of
emergence of the SARS CoV epidemic to be November
2002. The remarkable consensus of these three studies
using different patient populations on the mutational
dynamics of the SARS CoV suggests that these results are
bona fide.

Map of significant mutations, insertions and deletions in the SARS-CoV genome
Map of significant mutations, insertions and deletions in the SARS-CoV genome. Map of the SARS genome, plotted
with substitutions appearing in more than two isolates and other major insertion and deletion regions. Golden bars signify the
SARS-CoV genome, with the approximate nucleotide positions shown in the scale on top of it. Arrows drawn on top of the
genome indicate nucleotide mutations (i.e. variations shared by more than two isolates) observed in the SARS-CoV genome.
Amino acid changes in SARS-CoV's proteins are reflected as arrows on top of the protein bars (blue bars). Significant multiplenucleotide deletions (pink bar) and insertions (light-blue bar) were also observed (denoted as arrows under the genome) and
appear to cluster around position 27000nt to 28000nt.

Table 3: Nucleotide variations during the transition from Vero cell culture to human. No nucleotide variations were observed between
isolate from laboratory-acquired SARS patient and its infection source.
