Abstract
Background: In most species of mammals, the TRB locus has the common feature of a library of
TRBV genes positioned at the 5'- end of two in tandem aligned D-J-C gene clusters, each composed
of a single TRBD gene, 6-7 TRBJ genes and one TRBC gene. An enhancer located at the 3'end of the
last TRBC and a well-defined promoter situated at the 5'end of the TRBD gene and/or a undefined
promoter situated at the 5'end of the TRBD2 are sufficient to generate the full recombinase
accessibility at the locus. In ruminant species, the 3'end of the TRB locus is characterized by the
presence of three D-J-C clusters, each constituted by a single TRBD, 5-7 TRBJ and one TRBC genes
with the center cluster showing a structure combined with the clusters upstream and downstream,
suggesting that a unequal crossover occurred in the duplication. An enhancer downstream the last
TRBC, and a promoter at the 5'-end of each TRBD gene are also present.
Results: In this paper we focused our attention on the analysis of a large number of sheep TR βchain transcripts derived from four different lymphoid tissues of three diverse sheep breed animals
to certify the use and frequency of the three gene clusters in the β-chain repertoire. As the sheep
TRB locus genomic organization is known, the exact interpretation of the V-D-J rearrangements
was fully determined. Our results clearly demonstrate that sheep β-chain constitutes a level of
variability that is substantially larger than that described in other mammalian species. This is due
not only to the increase of the number of D and J genes available to the somatic recombination,
but also to the presence of the trans-rearrangement process. Moreover, the functional complexity
of β-chain repertoire is resolved by other mechanisms such as alternative cis- and trans-splicing and
recombinational diversification that seems to affect the variety of the constant region.
Conclusion: All together our data demonstrate that a disparate set of molecular mechanisms
operate to perform a diversified repertoire in the sheep β-chain and this could confer some special
biological properties to the corresponding αβ T cells in the ruminant lineage.

Background

Mature T lymphocytes must express heterodimeric α and
β or γ and δ chain T cell receptors (TRs) on its surface in
order to provide protection from pathogens. The diversity
of the TR repertoire derives in large part from the random
somatic rearrangements of Variable (V), Diversity (D) and
Joining (J) genes in the case of δ and β chain, and Variable
(V) and Joining (J) genes in the case of γ, and α chain
encoding the variable portion of these molecules during
the T-cell differentiation.
The V(D)J process requires the binding of the lymphocytespecific recombination activating gene 1 and 2 (RAG1/2)
protein complex to recombination signal sequences (RSs)
flanking the rearranging sides of the individual V, D and J
genes [1]. Upon binding, the RAG1/2 recombinases introduce a nick at the border between the RS heptamer and
the adjacent coding sequence. The DNA repair factors of
the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery join
the nicked genes [2]. The RSs consist of conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences, separated by a spacer of 12
or 23 bp of relatively non-conserved DNA. Efficient
recombination involves pairs of genes flanked by dissimilar 12- and 23RSs (the 12/23 rule) [3]. However, at the
locus encoding for the β-chain (TRB), despite the 12/23
compatibility, the TRBD 12RSs, but not the TRBJ 12RSs
efficiently target Vβ 23RSs. This phenomenon termed
"beyond 12/23 rule" [4], preserving the TRBD gene utilization, ensures an ordered V(D)J recombination at the
TRB locus with the TRBD-to-TRBJ joining which occurs
before the TRBV-to-TRBD gene assembly.
Diversity at the recombination level is further enhanced
by other processes that include the exonuclease digestion
(trimming) of 3'-V, 5'- and 3'-D, and 5'-J genes, the imprecise joining of nicked genes, and the addition of non
germline nucleotides (N nucleotides) at the V-J, V-D and
D-J junctions. For this reason the product of the V(D)J
joining, corresponding to the CDR3 region in the chain, is
markedly polymorphic and is dominant in the recognition of peptide. After transcription, the V(D)J sequence is
spliced to the constant (C) gene.
The resources available to generate the potential repertoires and to establish the regulation are described by the
genomic organization of the TR loci. In most species of
mammals, the TRB locus has the common feature of a
library of TRBV genes positioned at the 5'- end of two in
tandem aligned D-J-C gene clusters, each composed of a
single TRBD, 6-7 TRBJ and one TRBC genes, followed by
a single TRBV gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation located at the 3'-end. This genomic organization is
reported well conserved from human [5], mouse [6,7], rat
[8], chimpanzee [9], rhesus monkey [10], and horse [11].
A peculiar feature of the mammalian TRB locus is the presence of two very similar TRBC genes, since they differ by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/3

only a few residues in the coding region; conversely, they
are different in their own 3'-UTR regions.
In the artiodactyls lineage, i.e., in sheep [12] as well as in
cattle [13] and in pig [14], a duplication event within the
3'-end of the TRB locus has led to the generation of a third
D-J-C cluster. The presence of an additional cluster produces an increase in the number of D and J genes available
to partake in somatic recombination, but also expand the
distance between the enhancer (Eβ) and the promoter
(PDβ1) elements within the locus. Surprisingly also, in
presence of three D-J-C clusters, both the nucleotide and
protein sequences of all three TRBC genes are highly similar. Only four amino acid residues have undergone
replacement in the TRBC1 gene with respect to the TRBC2
and TRBC3 genes, while the TRBC3 3'-UTR region is identical to that of TRBC1 gene [12]. The amino acid replacements were located, two in the N- terminus and one in the
E β-strand and in the FG loop of well-defined regions of
the extracellular domain of the TRBC molecule [15].
To know if the altered genomic architecture of the ruminant TRB locus can modify the mechanisms of recombination, we investigated on the β-chain repertoire in sheep.
For this purpose we produced a collection of cDNAs
derived from four different tissues belonging to four different adult animals of three diverse sheep breeds. As the
genomic organization is known, the exact interpretation
of the β chain transcripts was determined. The results of
the analyses clearly demonstrate that sheep possess a repertoire of functional TRβ genes that is substantially larger
than that described for other mammalian species, but also
that other mechanisms as trans-rearrangement, intrallelic
trans-splicing and DNA recombinational diversification
involving the constant regions seem to shape the β-chain
repertoire in a consistent way. However, the general paradigms of the mammalian TRB regulation seem to be preserved.

Results

Analysis of β-chain transcripts
A previous study on cloning and sequencing of the sheep
TRB locus revealed that the D-J-C region is organized in
three independent clusters tandem aligned, with D-J-C
cluster 3 additional with respect to the other mammalian
TRB loci [12]. D-J-C cluster 1 contains one TRBD, six TRBJ
and one TRBC gene. D-J-C cluster 3, located at 2.4 Kb
downstream cluster 1, includes one TRBD, five TRBJ and
one TRBC gene. Finally, D-J-C cluster 2 is positioned at
2.6 Kb downstream cluster 3 with one TRBD, seven TRBJ
and one TRBC gene (fig. 1).

To evaluate the contribution of each gene cluster in the
formation of the β-chain repertoire, a total of 72 clones
containing rearranged V-D-J-C transcripts with a correct
open reading frame were analyzed. All cDNA clones were

registered in EMBL database with the Accession numbers
from FM993913 to FM993984. 21 of these clones were
derived from perinatal thymus (pSTMOS series) of a Moscia Leccese breed sheep, 15 from adult thymus (pSTA
series) and 19 from spleen (pSMA series) of a Gentile di
Puglia breed sheep, 17 from peripheral blood (pSSAR
series) of a Sarda Ionica breed sheep. The clones were
obtained by RT-PCR. The 5' primer was chosen on the
YLCASS amino acid motif of the TRBV genes as members
of the TRBV subgroups with this motif which seem to be
the most frequently used [16] while the 3'-primer was
designed on a conserved region of the three TRBC genes
[12].
The deduced amino acid sequences of the V-D-J regions of
all 72 cDNA clones are reported in the Table 1 together
with the corresponding TRBC genes, according to the tissue of origin. Among the clones only one sequence is
shared between blood (pSSAR25) and adult thymus
(pSTA03). No tissue-specific expression of the genes was
found. A total of 16 TRBJ genes were recovered within the
different cDNAs. Thus, only one out of 17 functional TRBJ
genes present in the genomic sequence was completely
absent (TRBJ2.6). Besides, all TRBJ sequences match well
with the corresponding genomic ones, and the high level
of sequence similarity observed among the different animals is consistent with a close phylogeny of sheep breeds.
The TRBJ2 cluster seems to be preferentially used (38/72
= 52.7%) and, although the numbers are too low to be statistically relevant, a slight increase in the use of TRBJ2.3
(14/38 = 36.8%) and TRBJ2.7 (10/38 = 26.3%) genes can
be observed. Moreover, 20 clones retain a member of the
TRBJ3 cluster, with the TRBJ3.4 gene (9/20 = 45%) more
frequently used, while 14 clones retain the TRBJ1 gene set,
without any preferential usage.
Three nucleotide differences at the N-terminus allow to
distinguish the three TRBC gene isotypes: TRBC1 differs
with respect to TRBC2 and TRBC3 genes for two nucle-

otide substitutions in the third and fourth codons; TRBC3
(as well as TRBC1 gene) is distinguishable from TRBC2
because of a silent nucleotide substitution at the third
position of the first codon [12]. On the basis of these criteria, the N-terminus of the TRBC portions within the
cDNA sequences was analyzed and a significant group of
cDNAs with the TRBC3 gene (35/72 = 48.6%) identified.
Moreover, 25 clones retain the TRBC2 (34.7%) and 12
clones are with the TRBC1 (16.6%) gene (Table 1).
More complex is the determination and the contribution
of the genes involved in the CDR3 formation. The CDR3
β region is defined as a stretch of nucleotides running after
the codon encoding the cystein in position 104 of the
TRBV gene to the codon before that which encodes the
phenylalanine of the FGXG motif of the TRBJ gene http://
imgt.cines.fr/[17]. The corresponding amino acid
sequence of the CDR3 loop deduced from the nucleotide
sequences reveals that it is heterogeneous for amino acid
composition (Table 1). The mean length of the CDR3
loop was approximately the same in spleen (mean 12.3
aa, range 10-16 aa) and adult thymus (mean 12.6 aa,
range 9-16 aa), but larger in blood (mean 13.9 aa, range
10-15 aa) and young thymus (mean 13.7 aa, range 10-20
aa). For comparison, human peripheral blood CDR3β
loop is about 12.7 residue long [18] and mouse is 11.9
residue long [19]. A similar CDR3 length and size range
was reported in thymus and peripheral blood lymphocytes of piglets (mean 13.1 aa, range 10-17 aa) [20].
For a close inspection of the CDR3 s, the nucleotide
sequences have been excised from each cDNA sequence
and analyzed in detail. In the absence of the TRBV germline sequences, the deletions at the 3'-end of the TRBV and
the nucleotide addition at the V-D junctions cannot be
accurately estimated. However, the comparison of the 72
V-D-J junctions after the ASS motif allowed the determination of the probable 3'-end of the TRBV gene that has
not been trimmed by exonuclease during rearrangement

in a significant proportion of sequences (Table 1). By the
comparison of the TRBD genomic sequences, the nucleotides located in the CDR3 regions were considered to
belong to a TRBD gene if they constituted a stretch of at
least four consecutive residues corresponding to the
TRBD1, TRBD3 or TRBD2 germline sequences. In this way
the 72 sequences were grouped according to the TRBD1
(fig. 2a, 36 sequences), TRBD3 (fig. 2b, 16 sequences) or
TRBD2 (fig. 2c, 8 sequences) gene usage. 12 sequences
with no recognizable TRBD genes were grouped separately (fig. 2d). These last sequences could be interpreted
as direct V-J junctions. However, it is also possible that
nucleotide trimming masked the initial participation of D
gene during the rearrangement. In the other cases the
degree of germline nucleotide trimming in the 3'-V and 5'J as well as the 5' and 3' D region is similar in all groups
(fig. 2). Nucleotides that could not be attributed to any
template sequence are considered N-elements. The mean
length for N-D-N addition, including D region, is 15 nt
(range 6-23 bases) for the first group (fig. 2a), 13.8 nt
(range 4-22 bases) for the second group (fig. 2b) and 16
nt (range 6-33 bases) for the group with TRBD2 participation (fig. 2c). The mean of N addition in the clones without TRBD sequence (fig. 2d) is 8.3 nt (range 2-16 bases).
Particular features of the CDR3 region of the clones are
the presence within the D region of nucleotide substitutions as well as the presence of insertion (psTMos 13 in
fig. 2b) and deletion (psTA12 in fig. 2a) with respect to
the germline sequences. Although the numbers are too
low to be statistically relevant, a trend towards longer
CDR3 length in TRBD2 (mean 42.3 bp, range 27-60) with
respect to TRBD1 (mean 40.3 bp range 33-54) and TRBD3
(mean 38.5 bp, range 30-48), or with no apparent TRBD
(mean 36.2 bp, range 30-42) transcripts was evident.
These data together suggest that all three TRB D-J-C clusters are used to generate in sheep functional TR β-chain
with no specific influence of any clusters.

Analysis of the D-J-C rearrangements
Since the genomic organization of the 3' region of the
sheep TRB locus is known (fig. 1) [12], the formal interpretation of the D-J-C arrangements is possible. The intracluster rearrangements represent a consistent portion of
the repertoire (41.6%), with 10 TRBD1-TRBJ1, 9 TRBD3TRBJ3 and 6 TRBD2-TRBJ2 rearrangements (Table 1). A
similar number of rearrangements (53.3%) can be interpreted by direct 5'- to- 3' joining across the clusters (intercluster rearrangements) with 20 TRBD1-TRBJ2, 6 TRBD1TRBJ3 and 6 TRBD3-TRBJ2 rearrangements (Table 1).
Interestingly, we also observed two TRBD2-TRBJ3
(psTMOs23 and psTA09, italics in Table 1) and one
TRBD3-TRBJ1 (psSAR08, italics in Table 1) joining. Since
the D- J-C cluster 2 is located downstream D- J-C cluster 3
as well as D- J-C cluster 3 is downstream D- J-C cluster 1
within the TRB locus, both these junctions may only be
explained by chromosomal inversion, or with more probability, by trans-rearrangement occurring during TRB
locus recombination.

A systematic analysis of the constant region of the transcripts also revealed that multiple splice variants are
present. In fact, the canonical splicing is present in 49/72
(68%) clones with 10 TRBJ1-TRBC1, 17 TRBJ3-TRBC3
and 22 TRBJ2-TRBC2 transcripts (Table 1). A group of 7
clones (4 TRBJ1-TRBC3 and 3 TRBJ3-TRBC2) comes from
an alternative or cis-splicing mechanism (9.7%). Finally,
it is noteworthy that 16 clones (22.2%, bold in Table 1)
with TRBJ2 genes showed TRBC3 or TRBC1 instead of the
expected TRBC2 gene. Since TRBC3 as well as TRBC1
genes are located upstream TRBJ2 cluster in the germline
DNA, TRBJ2 joined to TRBC1 or TRBC3 sequences cannot
be a cis-spliced product of a single precursor RNA. Consequently, they must be the product of a trans-splicing
between a transcript with TRBJ2-TRBC2 genes and a transcript containing TRBC1 or TRBC3 genes.

CDR3 nucleotide sequences retrieved from the cDNA clones
CDR3 nucleotide sequences retrieved from the cDNA clones. Sequences are shown from the codon after the cys-94
of the TRBV gene to the codon before the phe-104 of the TRBJ gene and grouped on the basis of the TRBD1 (a), TRBD3 (b),
TRBD2 (c) or no TRBD usage (d). Nucleotides that are conserved in the 3' end of the V portion are considered of TRBV
genomic origin and indicated in bold upper cases. Residues belonging to the different TRBJ genes, on the right, are indicated also
in bold upper case at the 3' end of each sequence. The germline sequences of TRBD1, TRBD3 and TRBD2 gene are indicated at
the top of each figure. The sequences considered to present recognizable TRBD genes (see text) are indicated in lower cases
and nucleotide substitutions or insertions are underlined. Nucleotides that cannot be attributed to any coding elements (Nnucleotides) are indicated in capital letters on the left and on the right sides of the TRBD regions. Numbers in the right column
indicate the level of 5'- TRBJ nucleotide trimming.

We excluded that all these non canonical sequences may
be the result of PCR artifacts since the crossover points
have not as expected a random distribution, but they
always lie at the D-J or/and J-C junction, giving rise to
products of the appropriate length and sequence.
The presence of splice variants may suggest the involvement of the TRBC gene in generating the TR β-chain functional diversity.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/3

generated by a mechanism of DNA recombinational
diversification with the allele of TRBC3 gene (mixed
color).
After deducing the allelic variants of the three constant
genes in the other tissues, alternative splicing and recombinational diversification can explain the excess of the
sequences also in those cases.

Discussion
Structure of the TRBC region
To complete the analysis of the TRBC domain in the
cDNA clones, the whole constant portion of the transcripts was retrieved from the sequences and aligned
according to the three TRBC isotypes for each animal in
the different tissues.

The comparison of the 72 cDNAs showed the presence of
different sequences that can be identified for the nucleotide variability in 14 different positions, 12 located in
the first and two in the third exon, resulting in six amino
acid substitutions all grouped in the first exon, and as a
consequence, in the extracellular domain of the chain (fig.
3). By means of these variations, we observed a number of
different sequences in excess. For example, five different
groups of sequences were assigned to the TRBC3 gene in
the young thymus of the Moscia Leccese breed individual.
This number is certainly higher than the expected two
allelic forms, at the most, of the gene. In order to understand the origin of the additional sequences, we have isolated by PCR the allelic variants of all three TRBC genes
from the young thymus genomic DNA of the Moscia Leccese individual, used as a reference model with respect to
the others. The specificity of the PCR reactions was
achieved by using a reverse primer which binds to either
TRBC1 and TRBC3 (B40) or TRBC2 3'-UTR (B42)
sequences, and completely TRBC specific forward primers
complementary to a specific region upstream the TRBC1
(CC1), TRBC3 (CC3) and TRBC2 (CC2) coding regions
(see Methods). The three different PCR products were
sequenced, and in every case, two allelic forms for each
TRBC gene were obtained (data not shown). The comparison of the genomic with the corresponding sequences
within the young thymus cDNAs allows us to establish
that the first two more abundant groups of TRBC3
sequences represent the two allelic forms of the TRBC3
genes (pink and lilac in fig. 3), while alternative splicing
of the third exon and DNA recombinational diversification process with the TRBC2 gene can have generated the
other three groups of TRBC3 sequences (mixed color in
fig. 3). Moreover, the two groups of TRBC2 cDNA
sequences (green and yellow in fig. 3) perfectly matched
with the two allelic forms (data not shown). Only one
allelic form was recovered for the TRBC1 gene (italics in
fig. 3), while the other TRBC1 sequence can have been

To validate the real participation of the third additional DJ-C cluster and compare its usage with respect to the others
in the formation of the TR β-chain repertoire, we analyzed
transcripts of 72 unique D-J-C rearrangements recovered
from four different tissues of four different animals,
belonging to three different ovine breeds. Although the
analyzed sequences lacked the TRBV genes, the presence
of the CDR3 β region, the TRBJ gene as well as most of the
TRBC gene sequence was sufficient to permit a comprehensive analysis of the expressed TR β chain. Data presented here show that the mechanisms for generating
diversity in sheep β chain polypeptides appear to adhere
to the paradigms established through the study of
humans and rodents. However, the diversity is enhanced
by somatic rearrangement of 3 TRBD and 17 TRBJ genes
that, by virtue of the expected recombination imprecision
and N-region addition, maximizes diversity in the CDR3
region, thus expanding the potential repertoire of antigen
specificities (Table 1). In spite of the presence of a longer
coding nucleotide sequence in TRBD genes if compared
with the human and mouse counterpart [12], the overall
size of the CDR3 region is conserved in all tissues among
the different mammalian species (Table 1). This conservation was archived by a greater deletion at the 5'end of TRBJ
genes and a concomitant increase in N-nucleotide addition at the V-D-J junction during rearrangement (fig. 2).
This suggests that the length of CDR3 in TR β chain is
essential for T-cell function.
While there is not a specific influence of any cluster in the
formation of the sheep β-chain in the different tissues, a
dissimilar usage of the genes can be identified and it could
depend on the sheep TRB genomic organization. Consistent with a promoter-enhancer facilitated recombination
model, in human and mouse, assembly of the DJβ1 cassette is dependent on the interaction of the enhancer with
the PDβ1 promoter positioned immediately 5' of the
TRBD1 gene. Assembly of DJβ2 proceeds independent
from that of DJβ1, albeit with less efficiency. Also in this
case, an undefined PDβ2 region continues to associate
with the enhancer [21]. Our analyses suggest that also in
sheep the mechanisms selectively alter D usage, so that the
"privileged" TRBD1 gene can account for the 60% of the
total clones with respect to 26.6% of TRBD3 and 13.3% of
TRBD2. This may reside in the greater efficiency of the

The nucleotide sequences of the TRBC isotypes derived from the cDNA clones
The nucleotide sequences of the TRBC isotypes derived from the cDNA clones. Only the 14 variable nucleotide
codons (12 in the first and two in the third exons numbered from the first position of the constant region in the cDNA) are
depicted. The amino acids specified by the corresponding codons and those due to the nucleotide substitutions are given at the
top of each codon, using the single letter code. The sequences are organized with respect to the one allelic TRBC3 sequence
isolated from Moscia Leccese breed young thymus. Identities of the other allelic form of the same gene or of the other TRBC
isotypes in the other tissues with respect to the reference sequence are indicated by dashes, while nucleotide substitutions are
shown. The number on the left indicates the clones with the corresponding sequences. All the allelic forms of the TRBC isotypes are identified by a color. Color changes indicate recombinational diversification or alternative splicing.

PDβ1 promoter activity with respect to the PDβ3 or PDβ2.
A striking conservation of the PDβ1 and PDβ2 (as well as
PDβ3) regions among sheep, human and mouse [12] can
support this observation, whereas the activity of the two
similar PDβ3 and PDβ2 promoters could be correlated
with their position from 5' to 3' within the locus.
The prominent utilization of the members of the TRBJ2
with respect to the TRBJ3 and TRBJ1 sets, as deducted
from our cDNA collection, results from inter cluster or
trans-rearrangements. It is possible that the preferential
usage of the TRBJ2 set could depend on the number of
genes that lie in the genomic region, if multiple Jβ 12-RSs
are important for increasing the local concentration of the
RAG proteins that first bind a 12-RS and then capture a
23-RS to form a synaptic complex [22]. In this regard, it is
notable that the six sheep TRBJ1 genes lie in about 2.1 Kb,
the five TRBJ3 genes in about 900 bp, while the seven
TRBJ2 genes are grouped in about 1 Kb. Recently, Franchini et al. [23] have demonstrated, by means of an in vitro
RAG1/2 mediated DNA coupled cleavage assay using various pair-wise RS combinations, that in mouse, the coupled cleavage of Dβ1-Jβ1 and Dβ2-Jβ2 substrates are
similar and are both weak if compared to Dβ1-Jβ2 substrates, suggesting that Jβ2 RSs are better partners than Jβ1
RSs. In the same way, in sheep there could be the presence
of a hierarchy efficiency of coupled cleavage with the Dβ1Jβ2 > Dβ1-Jβ3 > Dβ1-Jβ1.
As the increment of the number of TRBD and TRBJ genes
produces larger variation in TR β chain, particularly in
CDR3 region as expected, similarly, the presence of an
additional TRBC gene seems to affect the variety of the β
chain repertoire. In fact careful analysis of the cDNA constant regions obtained from the different animals showed
a level of unexpected variability in the first exon of the
TRBC genes (fig. 3) if compared with that established in
the genomic sequence [12]. By using the single nucleotide
variations present in the first and third exon of the TRBC
genes as hallmarks, we demonstrated that alternative
splicing concerning the first and/or the third exon and/or
somatic recombinatiorial processes are involved in the
diversification of the constant region of the sheep β-chain.
The alternative splicing can occur either in cis or in trans.
The presence of a cis-splicing mechanism comes from the
analysis of six clones with TRBJ1-TRBC3 and TRBJ3TRBC2 arrangement, while the presence of a trans-splicing
process derives from the analysis of 16 clones with TRBJ2
spliced to TRBC3 or TRBC1 instead of the expected TRBC2
gene (Table 1). TRBJ2 to TRBC1 or TRBC3 splicing could
be possible only when TRBV-TRBD-TRBJ transcripts are
spliced with a transcript of the other allele. As a consequence, trans-splicing of two RNA separate precursors is
the only logical possibility. The involvement of interallelic trans-splicing has already been documented in IgH

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/3

chains [24]. Beyond this case the presence of interallelic
trans-splicing in vertebrates is problematical to demonstrate. It has been documented to be an essential process
for the expression of the lola Drosophila gene. Lola
encodes 20 protein isoforms belonging to a family of BTB
zinc-finger transcriptional factor [25]. Genetic tests have
demonstrated that some isoforms were generating
thought intrallelic trans-splicing [26]. No particular
sequences for trans-splicing have been identified around
the exon-intron boundary in the lola gene; therefore, the
basic mechanism of trans-splicing is likely to be shared
with those of cis-splicing and occur co-transcriptionally
where nascent pre mRNA are produced in close proximity,
as is the case for cis-splicing [26]. It is possible that also in
sheep TRB locus, the cis and trans-splicing shared the
same mechanism.
Investigation of the constant domain of the sheep cDNAs
led us to deduce that a minimal set of sequences are also
generated by a somatic recombinatorial process (fig. 3).
Somatic recombinatorial diversification occurs in vertebrates, yeast and plants [27-29], and such a modification
of germline sequences can generate individuals with different starting gene repertoires in different tissues.
The precise effect and significance of the variability in the
constant region of TR β-chain remain to be determined. It
might create diversity in the T cell function. The extracellular domain of the TRBC molecule consists of welldefined regions [15]. The pattern of amino acid replacements in the sheep cDNA was located, beyond the N- terminus, one both in the TRBC E β-strand and in the DE
loop and two in the FG loop. This last is TR β-chain specific loop in all mammalian species and contains 12 residues that are conserved between the two TRBC isotypes in
human and mouse. In sheep sequences, the FG loop is
one amino acid longer and underwent replacement
among the three TRBC genes. So the Gln in position 106
in the first half part of the loop can be replaced by Glu;
while the Asp in position 115 of the second part of the
loop can be substituted by Ala (fig. 3). Three-dimensional
structures of the TR [30] have shown that the FG loop of
the TR β chain exists as an elongated, rigid element forming a sidewall of a cavity created by the asymmetric disposition of Cα and Cβ domains that receive the ε subunit of
the CD3 complex [31]. Therefore a primary function of
the Cβ FG loop in the thymus is to facilitate negative selection, while following maturation, αβ T cells are dependent on the Cβ FG loop to their activation [32]. Our
hypothesis is that amino acid replacement in the FG loop
of the sheep TRBC genes can be modified by the sensitivity of αβ T cell for cognate peptide recognition, and this
can be correlated with the function of the αβ T cell in
sheep.

Conclusions
All together our results show that in sheep the presence of
an additional D-J-C cluster enhances the β-chain repertoire. These findings, together with the evidence of the
expansion of gene repertoires for other TR loci in ruminants [33-35], suggest that strong evolutionary pressures
have driven a generic enlargement of TR gene numbers,
thus generating a greater potential TR diversity in this lineage.

Methods
Animals (source of tissue)
Thymus, spleen and blood were obtained from animals of
three different autochthonous breeds. One thymus was
collected from one neonatal Moscia Leccese sheep; spleen
and the other thymus from one adult Gentile di Puglia; and
blood from one young Sarda Ionica sheep. All animals
were conventionally reared outbred sheep and were
healthy at the time of sample collection. All animal
manipulations were carried out with the approval of the
Bari Animal Ethics Commitee and in compliance with
Institutional Animal Care and Use Comittee (IACUC)
requirements.
RT-PCR
The different organs were removed from the animals,
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C
until preparation of RNA. In the case of blood, RNA was
prepared before freezing.

Total RNA was extracted from tissues under the protocol
approved by the manufacturer (Trizol reagent, Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed by
reverse transcription of 5 μgr of total RNA primed with 2,5
μl of oligodT (0,5 μg/μl) using 2 μl dNTP (10 mM), 2 μl
DTT (100 mM) and 1 μl PowerScript™ReverseTrancriptase
(Clontech) in the recommended buffer in a total of 20 μl.
The genes of interest were amplified from 10% of cDNA
preparations using a sense V primer (VB3; 5'-TATCTCTGTGCCAGCAGC-3') complementary to a conserved region
in the 3'-end of sheep TRBV genes [16] and an antisense
CB3
primer
(5'-CACCAGGGCGCTGACCAG-3';
AM420900; 8,222-8,239 positions) (5'-CACCAGGGCGCTGACCAG-3'; AM420900; 17,442-17,459 positions) (5'-CACCAGGGCGCTGACCAG-3'; AM420900;
26,702-26,719 positions) located in the third exon of the
sheep TRBC genes. All the PCR were performed in a 50 μl
volume with 5 μl 10× buffer, 2 μl MgCl2 (50 mM), 1 μl
dNTP (10 mM), 0,5 μl of Taq Platinuum 5 U/μl (Invitrogen) and 2 μl of the sense and antisense primers (10 mM).
After 2 min of initial denaturation at 94°C, the samples
were subjected to 35 cycles of amplification (30 s at 94°C,
30 s at 58°C, 30 s at 72°C). The final cycle was extended
for 10 min at 72°C. Amplified cDNA fragments were puri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/3

fied by using the PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen-Life Technologies), ligated into StrataClone PCR
Cloning Vector and transformed into StrataClone Competent Cells (Stratagene).
DNA amplification
Genomic DNA was isolated from the young Moscia Leccese
thymus by standard techniques. For the DNA amplifications, 50-200 μgr of thymus DNA was used with the
TaKaRa LA Taq in 50 μl reactions, according to the recommendations (TAKARA BIO INC.). The cycling conditions
were as follows: 94°C for 1 min; 35 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95°C, 1 min annealing at 58°C, 2 min polymerization at 68°C; and 68°C for 10 min. The primer
combinations used were CC1 and B40 for the TRBC1
gene, CC3 and B40 for the TRBC3 gene and CC2 and B42
for the TRBC2 gene. The CC1 (5'-CTGTGGCCCCTTTCCTTGTT-3'; AM420900, 6,805-6,824 positions), CC3 (5'ACACACACAGCCCCTACCA-3', AM420900, 16,32416,342 positions) and CC2 (5'-AGAGATGGGTTGTCGTAGG-3', AM420900, 25,117-25,136 positions) are
designed on the 5'- end specific of the TRBC1, TRBC3 and
TRBC2 genes respectively. B40 (5'-TCAGGGCAGTAACAGGCT-3'; AM420900, 8587-8569 positions) (5'TCAGGGCAGTAACAGGCT-3'; AM420900; 17832-17815
positions) is complementary to the 3'UTR of TRBC1 as
well as TRBC3 genes, while B42 (5'-ATGACTCGGGACGCACTT-3', AM420900, 27,040-27,057 positions) is complementary to the 3'UTR of the TRBC2 genes. Amplified
DNA fragments were purified by PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen-Life Technologies) and used directly
for DNA sequencing.
Determination of CDR3 length and sequence analyses
The CDR3 size was calculated by the number of amino
acids between the amino acid after the conserved 2nd
cysteine in the V gene (pos.104), and the amino acid
before the phenylalanina of the FGXG motif in the J gene
http://imgt.cines.fr/[17]. This method gives the CDR3
length with three amino acids more than that done in
Kabat et al [36].

Nucleotide sequences were determined by a commercial
service. DNA sequence data were processed and analyzed
using the blasta program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST, Clustal W http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/
index.html[37] and IMGT database http://imgt.cines.fr/)
[17].
