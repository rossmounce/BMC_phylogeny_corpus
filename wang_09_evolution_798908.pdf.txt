Abstract
Background: The gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and its orthologues play a central role in the
integration of flowering signals within Arabidopsis and other diverse species. Multiple copies of FT,
with different cis-intronic sequence, exist and appear to operate harmoniously within polyploid
crop species such as Brassica napus (AACC), a member of the same plant family as Arabidopsis.
Results: We have identified six BnFT paralogues from the genome of B. napus and mapped them to six
distinct regions, each of which is homologous to a common ancestral block (E) of Arabidopsis
chromosome 1. Four of the six regions were present within inverted duplicated regions of
chromosomes A7 and C6. The coding sequences of BnFT paralogues showed 92-99% identities to each
other and 85-87% identity with that of Arabidopsis. However, two of the paralogues on chromosomes
A2 and C2, BnA2.FT and BnC2.FT, were found to lack the distinctive CArG box that is located within
intron 1 that has been shown in Arabidopsis to be the binding site for theFLC protein. Three BnFT
paralogues (BnA2.FT, BnC6.FT.a and BnC6.FT.b) were associated with two major QTL clusters for
flowering time. One of the QTLs encompassing two BnFT paralogues (BnC6.FT.a and BnC6.FT.b) on
chromosome C6 was resolved further using near isogenic lines, specific alleles of which were both
shown to promote flowering. Association analysis of the three BnFT paralogues across 55 cultivars of B.
napus showed that the alleles detected in the original parents of the mapping population used to detect
QTL (NY7 and Tapidor) were ubiquitous amongst spring and winter type cultivars of rapeseed. It was
inferred that the ancestral FT homologues in Brassica evolved from two distinct copies, one of which was
duplicated along with inversion of the associated chromosomal segment prior to the divergence of B.
rapa (AA) and B. oleracea (CC). At least ten such inverted duplicated blocks (IDBs) were identified
covering a quarter of the whole B. napus genome.
Conclusion: Six orthologues of Arabidopsis FT were identified and mapped in the genome of B.
napus which sheds new light on the evolution of paralogues in polyploidy species. The allelic
variation of BnFT paralogues results in functional differences affecting flowering time between
winter and spring type cultivars of oilseed Brassica. The prevalent inverted duplicated blocks, two
of which were located by four of the six BnFT paralogues, contributed to gene duplications and
might represent predominant pathway of evolution in Brassica.

Background
Timing of the onset of flowering is an important agronomic trait affecting crop production. To meet the challenges of climate change, and the need to adapt crops to a
wider range of growing environments, it is necessary to
coordinate flowering within the context of seasonal variations in order to ensure the greatest possibility of pollination, and thus consistently high seed yield. The genetic
basis of variation in flowering time is now well understood in Arabidopsis. Forward and reverse genetics has
allowed identification of genes in the context of environmental and developmental cues that mediate the onset of
flowering, and allowed detailed characterization of the
photoperiod, vernalization, gibberellin and autonomous
pathways. Major integrators of these pathways include
FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), along with SUPPRESSOR OF
OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and LEAFY
(LFY) [1-5]. FT induces flowering in response to long days
and is a direct target of the nuclear protein CONSTANS
(CO) in leaves [6-8]. Two proteins within the vernalization pathway, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SHORT
VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), bind to the CArG box within
intron 1 and promoter region of FT, respectively, to
repress its expression [9,10]. FT is expressed in the phloem
of leaves, with the small protein moving as a long-distance signal to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) where it
interacts with FD, a bZIP transcription factor, to form a
complex of FT/FD heterodimer. This then activates the floral meristem identity genes APETALA 1 (AP1) and FRUITFUL (FUL) to promote flowering [7,8,11,12].
Although FT plays a central and indispensable role to
induce flowering, interpreting the exact roles of different
FT paralogues is difficult, owing to variation in the structure and number of FT family members across plant taxa.
For example in rice, at least three FT-like genes (OsFTL1OsFTL3) promote flowering, although there are thirteen
such genes within the genome, corresponding to eight in
the ancestral grass genome [13-16]. It has been shown
that the protein encoded by Hd3a, corresponding to
OsFTL2, is a mobile signal in rice, and moves from the leaf
to the SAM to induce flowering [17]. A complex situation
also exists in barley, where five FT-like genes are found,
with HvFT1 being highly expressed under long day conditions at the time of transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, and HvFT2 and HvFT4 expressed later in
development. HvFT3 is a candidate gene for a major flowering-time QTL, and the expression level of HvFT5 is very
low in short days, corresponding to a predicted stop
codon within the protein at residue 69 [18]. Four FT-like
cDNAs have been cloned in poplar, of which only PtFT2
has been shown to shorten juvenile phase and promote
seasonal flowering [19]. Although Brassica species share a
common ancestor with Arabidopsis and diverged at 14.5 to
20.4 MYA [20-22], no FT paralogues had previously been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/271

identified, apart from 3 RFLP probes from Arabidopsis FT
having been mapped to the A2 (N2) and C6 (N16) linkage groups of B. napus [23].
B. napus is a major oil crop in temperate regions worldwide with approximately 52 million tonnes of seed production per year (2007-2008; http://www.worldoil.com/
). Results of comparative mapping between the Arabidopsis
and Brassica genomes suggest that numerous regions
homologous to the Arabidopsis genome are triplicated
within diploid species of Brassica [24-27]. The B. rapa (2n
= 20, AA) and B. oleracea (2n = 18, CC) genomes are essential conserved intact within the amphidiploid species B.
napus (2n = 38, AACC), which appears to have been synthesized within the past ten thousand years [24-26,2831]. Recently, more detailed evidence for the ancestral segmental chromosomal duplications leading to effective
triplication in Brassica diploids has been obtained from
partial genome sequencing and comparative chromosome painting [22,25,32-34]. However, comparative
sequence analysis indicates that various mechanisms of
genome evolution have contributed to many situations
where either more or less than three paralogous genes,
corresponding to single orthologues in Arabidopsis, are
present in the Brassica A or C genome [26,28,35-37].
Although there are five homologs of FT in Arabidopsis, i.e.
TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), TWIN SISTER OF FT
(TSF), ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA CENTRORADIALIS
(ATC), BROTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (BFT), and MOTHER
OF FTAND TFL1 (MFT), their functions are very diverged
from FT, and only share 56-82% identity at the amino
acid sequence level, with TSF having the highest similarity
[38]. This information allows us to identify FT orthologues from the B. napus genome unambiguously. We
sought to characterize the role that ancestral segmental
genome duplication events had played on the number
and function of FT orthologues within B. napus, and to
establish how this had contributed to the ability to adapt
to contrasting agricultural systems, such as those associated with spring and winter seasonal crop types. This
paper presents the results of cloning and characterizing
the BnFT paralogues, and discusses the evolution of BnFT
paralogues within B. napus.

Results
Isolation and genetic mapping of BnFT paralogues
Thirty-five potential FT orthologue-containing BAC
clones were identified by Southern blot screening of the
JBnB BAC library, which was developed from the doubled
haploid B. napus cv. Tapidor [30]. Eleven of these were
verified by PCR amplification. These BACs were initially
grouped according to intron length (4 groups), and then
grouped according to the polymorphism within intron 2
(6 groups) (Additional file 1). Full-length genomic

sequences of these six BnFT paralogues were isolated from
representative BACs by amplification and PCR walking,
with primers designed from one copy of BrFT (designated
as BrA2.FT) located in chromosome A2 of B. rapa (Figure
1, Table 1).
The six BnFT paralogues were mapped using PCR-derived
markers to four linkage groups of the TNDH genetic map,
two in the A genome and two in the C genome (Figure 2).
The BnFT paralogues within B. napus were named as follows: BnA2.FT, BnA7.FT.a, BnA7.FT.b, BnC2.FT,
BnC6.FT.a and BnC6.FT.b according to their mapped
chromosomes. In silico mapping indicates that all of the
genomic regions containing BnFT paralogues corresponded to block E in chromosome 1 of Arabidopsis [26],
although block E was inversely duplicated on linkage
groups A7 and C6, where it forms inverted duplication
blocks (IDBs). Based on marker identity, the BnFT paralogues in the IDBs were close to the junctions of each
duplicated block (Figure 2).
According to marker identity, ten IDBs were detected
within the TNDH linkage map associated with eight chromosomes (Figure 3, Additional file 2 ). The IDBs covered
a quarter of the whole linkage groups of B. napus that
could align with the genome of Arabidopsis (Table 2).
Interestingly, blocks located in chromosome 3 and 5 of
Arabidopsis [26,39] rarely corresponded with the IDBs in
the genome of B. napus. The majority of IDBs were
detected in the A genome and not in the corresponding
regions of the C genome, since most markers had been
developed from B. rapa BACs.
BnFT paralogues: candidate genes of QTL for flowering
time?
Two BnFT paralogues, BnC6.FT.a and BnC6.FT.b, were
mapped previously to a major QTL cluster region for flowering time, which was detected in all winter-cropped envi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/271

ronments, with the Tapidor alleles contributing to
accelerated flowering [39]. The BnA2.FT was newly identified to be located within the confidence interval region of
the QTL cluster on chromosome A2 in two wintercropped environments, with the NY7 allele promoting
flowering (Figure 4A). To test whether the BnC6.FT.a and
BnC6.FT.b represented candidate genes of QTL for flowering time, a DH line harbouring the complete C6 QTL cluster in Tapidor was backcrossed to NY7 for four
generations, and two near isogenic lines (NILs) with different combinations of introgressed segments on C6, NI5 and NI-9, were selected. Both NILs flowered much earlier than NY7 (Figure 4B). NI-5, which had a small additional introgressed fragment containing two BnC6.FT
alleles of Tapidor, significantly flowered earlier than NI-9
which lacked Tapidor alleles (Figure 4B). To further confirm whether the BnFT candidates significantly affected
flowering time in B. napus, BnC6.FT.a, BnC6.FT.b and
BnA2.FT were subjected to association analysis with 35
spring and 20 winter cultivars (Additional file 3). The
flowering time of the accessions was investigated in vernalization-free conditions, and the genotypes tested with
the PCR markers. The NY7 and Tapidor alleles of three
BnFT paralogues were significantly (P < 0.01) ubiquitous
in the spring and winter type cultivars (Table 3). In particular, two paralogues, BnC6.FT.a and BnC6.FT.b, showed
95% similarity with Tapidor alleles in winter type cultivars (Table 3). The functional differences observed
between spring and winter cultivars implied that the
expression of BnFT candidates was repressively regulated
prior to vernalization.
Characterization of BnFT paralogues
The canonical organization of FT into four exons and
three introns as found in Arabidopsis (Figure 5B) is well
conserved across all the FT-like genes identified in rice,
poplar and barley genomes. However, some variation of
intron size is observed, with the third intron of HvFT1

pairs (AtFT1 and AtFT2) were used to amplify the probe for screening BnFT paralogues from BAC clones of the JBnB library.

BrFT2-3/BrFT4 for exon2-exon4; 5' and 3' UTR were amplified with BrFT1-5' and BrFT4-3', respectively, by PCR walking.

being absent. The number and exon size of all BnFT paralogues in B. napus were identical to their orthologues in
Arabidopsis. However, the intron size of all these genes,
especially intron 2, was found to differ with that in Arabidopsis (Figure 5B). Thus a larger ORF is found for BnA2.FT
and a smaller ORF for BnC2.FT. In both cases a single base
deletion is present within intron 1 that disrupts the CArG
box, the binding motif for FLC protein to repress FT
expression prior to vernalization in Arabidopsis [10].
Over the coding sequence, the six BnFT paralogues had
85-87% identity with AtFT, 81-83% with AtTSF [GenBank: NM_118156], and 92-99% with each other (Table
4). Interestingly, the paralogues within homeologous
regions of the B. napus A and C genomes, such as BnA2.FT
and BnC2.FT, showed the highest nucleotide identity
(99%), whilst the paralogues present within inverse duplicated regions, such as BnC6.FT.a and BnC6.FT.b, showed
higher identity (97%) than among other pairs of paralogues, such as BnA2.FT and BnC6.FT.a (92%). The degree
of amino acid identity showed the same relationships as
the coding sequences (Table 4). The BnFT paralogues
showed much higher similarity with AtFT than with
AtTSF, indicating that conserved amino acids had been
substituted at some sites, although the proteins are likely
to perform similar functions.

Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of FT-like genes
across plant taxa
The phylogenetic relationships among FT-like genes from
B. napus, B. rapa, Arabidopsis, poplar, rice and barley were
analyzed, with a phylogenetic tree constructed from the
amino acid sequences of these genes. Four groups could
be identified: Hd3a [GenBank: AB052943] and HvFT1
[GenBank: EU331816], ptFT2 [GenBank: AY515152],
AtFT [GenBank: NM_105222] and Brassica FT genes (Figure 5A). The classification of species was consistent with
established divergence of plant taxa. It was clear that
Brassica FT genes fell into three groups: BnA7.FT.b and
BnC6.FT.b in group 1, BnA7.FT.a and BnC6.FT.a in group
2, and BnA2.FT, BnC2.FT and BrA2.FT in group 3 (Figure
5A).

The Ks values between AtFT and eight Brassica FT genes
(from 0.33 to 0.36) (Table 5) suggest a divergence time of
12 to 13 MYA between Brassica and Arabidopsis (Figure
5C). The Ks values between FT genes evolved from Bx.FT1 (Figure 5A) and Bx.FT-2 (0.17 to 0.19), Bx.FT-2a and
Bx.FT-2b (0.071 to 0.072) (Table 5) suggest that the first
and second duplications may have occurred in Brassica
~6-7 MYA and 2.5 MYA, respectively. The divergence of A
and C genomes (0.041-0.06) may have occurred at 1.5-2
MYA, with natural B. napus (0.0033-0.0058) (Table 5) calculated to have emerged approximately 0.12-0.21 MYA
(Figure 5C). The order of the evolutionary events calculated by Ks values is consistent with the established phylogenetic relationship of the FT genes.

Discussion
We isolated and mapped six BnFT paralogues from B.
napus. Those regions containing BnFT spanned all E segments of Arabidopsis chromosome 1, as previously
reported in B. napus [26,39,40]. Based on marker identity
additional IDBs were identified in A7 and C6 [41,42].
However, our primary interest was to identify the BnFT
paralogues within B. napus and to understand the evolutionary processes and functional consequences associated
with their duplication.
Characterization of BnFT paralogues
Although the FT family members within Arabidopsis,
Brassica, rice, barley and poplar have similar exon/intron
structures (apart from barley HvFT1), the number of paralogous genes differs. The single FT gene in Arabidopsis has
been ascribed a "florigen" function that responds to long
days [6,12]. In contrast, rice, a short day plant, has thirteen FT-like genes, of which only the Hd3a protein has
been shown to have a "florigen" function, with the roles
of other paralogues largely unknown [13,14,17]. Five FTlike genes are found in barley and play different roles [18].
B. napus is an allotetraploid derived from interspecific
hybridization of B. rapa and B. oleracea [43,44] and is

more closely related to Arabidopsis. The six BnFT paralogues exhibit high levels of nucleotide identity to AtFT
within coding sequences, which initially suggested that all
BnFT may have a similar function contributing to the
induction of flowering. It is of intrinsic and agronomic
interest to determine how the presence of six BnFT paralogues may cooperate to regulate onset of flowering in B.
napus. Based on the analysis of the cis and coding
sequences of the closely related BnFT paralogues, it
should be possible to dissect the relative timing and contribution of locus-specific paralogues via expression profiles. One may expect that the presence of multiple
paralogous copies provides B. napus with additional
capacity for exquisite tuning of the network of signals that
are integrated from the pathways leading to flowering.
This tuning will be mediated in different cultivars through
differential expression of alleles at each paralogous locus,
and such differentiation will be particularly pronounced
between winter and spring type cultivars. More complex
interactions with the growing environment may also arise
from variation in the epigenetic status of the paralogous
genes.
Multiple pathways are integrated by FT to control flowering [4], with FT being the direct target of CO, FLC and SVP
proteins in Arabidopsis [9,10,45]. In Brassica species, several homologues of Arabidopsis flowering pathway genes
have been identified, such as four BnCO copies (BnCOa1,

BnCOa9, BnCOb1 and BnCOb9) in B. napus [46], five
BoFLC paralogues (BoFLC1, BoFLC2, BoFLC3, BoFLC4 and
BoFLC5) in B. oleracea [47,48], and four BrFLC copies
(BrFLC1, BrFLC2, BrFLC3 and BrFLC5) in B. rapa [49].
Based on the evidence from B. rapa and B. oleracea,
between eight or ten BnFLC paralogues are anticipated
within the whole genome of B. napus. It is tempting to
speculate that distinct BnFT copies may be the targets of
one or more BnCO and BnFLC paralogues in B. napus. A
characteristic CArG box, which acts as the FLC protein
binding site, was detected in the first intron of four BnFT
paralogues. However, it was absent in BnA2.FT, BnC2.FT
and BrA2.FT (Figure 5B). These difference in the structural
features of the BnFT paralogues strongly suggested that
they may have undergone functional differentiation and
regulatory variation in the context of polyploidy. It has
been suggested that redundancy may create subtle fitness
advantages that might only be evident in particular stages
of the life cycle, or under particular environmental conditions [50]. Force et al. [51] suggest that complementary
degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of
duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both
duplicates, thereby increasing the long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. Interestingly,
the CArG box was also not detected in PtFT2, Hd3a and
HvFT1 (Figure 5B) indicating that polyploidy may provide such FT orthologues with the opportunity to explore
sequence variation that enables more diverse or subtle

functionality within the context of more complex regulatory mechanisms and pathways, harmonized within their
own genome.
Earlier genetic mapping revealed that three RFLP markers
probed with Arabidopsis FT mapped to the A2 (N2) and C6
(N16) linkage groups of B. napus [23], although this did
not account for the full number of expected BnFT paralogues, nor the available sequence information. In this
study, we established a preliminary allelic relationship
between BnFT paralogues and flowering time QTL, and
extended this interpretation through association mapping
analysis. Firstly, the NI-5 that harbored a small introgres-

sion fragment containing Tapidor BnFT alleles flowered
much earlier than NI-9 (Figure 4B). This indicated that
Tapidor might possess alleles of BnFT with much stronger
flower-promoting functional effect than those of NY7.
Secondly, association mapping with three BnFT candidates indicated that the alleles of NY7 and Tapidor were
significantly prevalent in the spring and winter type rapeseeds, respectively (Table 3). The flowering time pathways
in Arabidopsis are better defined than in B. napus, and it is
well known that correct flowering time ensures the greatest chance of pollination, higher seed yield and oil content, and therefore reproduction of crop cultivars.

including those associated with a Brassica "florigen" function will accelerate the selection of cultivars with appropriate flowering times for different regions, especially
where there is variation in latitude and seasonal temperatures associated with winter environments. The different
regulatory mechanism and pathway of flowering between
winter and spring types are now able to be analyzed further.
Brassica FT genes and genome evolution
Comparative mapping between Arabidopsis and Brassica
species led Lagercrantz et al. [24] to be the first to propose
an ancestral segmental triplication affecting the complete
Brassica genome. Subsequently, this view has been substantiated by compelling evidence from genetic and
cytogenetic studies across most of the Brassiceae taxa,
which indicate this was achieved by a series of distinct
duplication events [25,32,33]. However, the detailed
mechanisms underlying the process of sequential duplications are not yet well characterized. Based on the
sequences of four paralogous B. rapa BAC clones and the
homologous 124-kb segment of A. thaliana chromosome
5, Yang et al. [22] deduced that three paralogous subgenomes of B. rapa emerged through duplications 13 to 17
MYA, very soon after the Arabidopsis and Brassica divergence occurred at 17 to 18 MYA. Using BAC-FISH techniques, three or six copies of the contig have been
identified from 18 species of Brassicaceae [25], and the
process of ancestral allohexaploidy Brassica genome was
further revealed as hybridization between genomes of the
ancient diploid and tetraploid [27].

Here, we identified six BnFT paralogues in B. napus and
determined that each of the A and C genomes contained
three copies, which is consistent with the established view
of Brassica genome triplication. Moreover, phylogenetic
analysis of complete BnFT paralogues in B. napus allowed
us to determine a clear evolutionary relationship between
each other. It is apparent that the Brassica FT paralogous
genes and the unique Arabidopsis FT share the same ancestor. The extant Brassica FT genes derived from two ancestral lineages (Bx), Bx.FT-1 and Bx.FT-2. Subsequently
Bx.FT-2 gave rise to two highly identical FT copies, Bx.FT2a and Bx.FT-2b, and finally Bx.FT-1 together with Bx.FT-

2a and Bx.FT-2b formed the final triplication of BnFT
genes in A and C genomes (Figure 5A). Thus, we propose
an evolutionary pathway of Brassica FT genes (Figure 5C)
which is in good agreement with the model of diploid
Brassica genome evolution via hexaploidization proposed
by Ziolkowski et al. [27]. It is not possible to define the
evolutionary divergences accurately based solely upon FT
family sequence comparison. However, the divergence
time calculated by Ks values placed the likely evolutionary
events within a distinct order which was in accordance
with the established phylogenetic relationship of the FT
genes.
Interestingly, the two chromosome fragments where
Bx.FT-2a and Bx.FT-2b are located are within IDBs that
appear to represent the most recent duplication event, as
indicated by the high sequence identity observed between
the orthologues. Moreover, the prevalence of IDBs
throughout the genome of B. napus (Figure 3, Table 2)
suggests that IDBs have been a universal and efficient
pathway in the evolutionary development of Brassica.
IDBs with its dosage effect should generate raw genetic
materials for the evolution that can be modified subsequently by natural selection just as general DNA duplications do [52], and the occasionally happened pairing
between opposite duplicating segments in the meiosis
might bring new variations. The homeologous IDBs in
different chromosomes would enhance the chance of
homeologous reciprocal or nonreciprocal translocations
which were already found in several Canadian and Australian cultivars of B. napus where IDBs exchanged
between A7 and C6 [53,54]. Lyask et al. [25] found that
the most frequent chromosome rearrangements involving
the At4-b contig are inversions, whilst comparative mapping has indicated that 43% of Brassica genomicregions
with homeology to Arabidopsis chromosomes involved
inversions [35]. It has been suggested that rearrangements
such as translocations or inversions might reduce or prevent undesirable pairing and recombination between
homeologous chromosomes/chromosome regions and
lead to reproductive isolation between populations, and
eventually contribute to the speciation processes [55].
Our observation of duplication events leading to inverted
duplication segments is in accordance with previous

reports on inverted chromosome segments duplicated in
the C6 (O6) linkage group of B. oleracea [41,42]. However, this differs from other reports where only two E segments of Arabidopsis chromosome 1 were found in A and
C genomes, respectively [40,56].

Conclusion
The six BnFT paralogues have very high identity between
their coding sequences, but vary between their corresponding introns. The CArG box within intron 1 was
absent from BnA2.FT and BnC2.FT, which may lead to
functional divergence. However, BnA2.FT along with two
paralogues on chromosome C6, BnC6.FT.a and
BnC6.FT.b, was associated with two major QTL clusters for
flowering time indicating that the "florigen" of B. napus
may be functionally differentiated between winter and
spring type cultivars. The BnFT paralogues share the same
ancestral gene with the single FT of Arabidopsis, and have
evolved via several duplications and divergence resulting
from whole genome polyploidization and the formation
of inverted duplication blocks. The characterization of the
six BnFT paralogues in B. napus increases our understanding of Brassica genome evolutionary pathways involving
genome triplication via multi-stage processes.

Methods
Plant materials
A B. napus doubled haploid [56] population, designated
as TNDH and consisting of 202 lines, was generated from

an F1 resulting from a cross between a Tapidor DH line
(hereafter referred to as Tapidor), a European winter cultivar, and Ningyou7 DH (hereafter referred to as NY7), a
Chinese semi-winter cultivar [57]. Near isogenic lines
(NILs) were developed with NY7 as the recurrent parent
and Tapidor as the donor parent. Fifty-five B. napus cultivars (in 2006) and two NILs (in 2008) were sown in a
field plot located in Gansu Province, one of the spring
rapeseed regions in China, with 10 plants maintained for
each line. NY7 was grown as a control in both years. The
period from sowing the seeds to the appearance of the first
flower for each accession was recorded as flowering time.
The student's t test (Family wide error rate P < 0.05) was
used to test the significance of the variation in flowering
time for NILs and NY7. Winter cultivars did not flower
under these field conditions.
BAC library screening and analysis of clones
A 692 bp FT genomic DNA sequence of (exon2 to exon4)
with 87% of identity to FT of Arabidopsis for the coding
sequence was isolated from Tapidor using primer pairs
AtFT-1 and AtFT-2 (Table 1) designed from an mRNA
sequence of FT (GenBank accession NM_105222). The
692 bp-FT-probe was used to screen the JBnB BAC library
which was constructed from genomic DNA of Tapidor by
Dr. Ian Bancroft, John Innes Centre, UK [30]. Positive
BACs were verified with PCR amplification using the
AtFT-1/AtFT-2 primer pairs. BnFT paralogues were isolated from six BACs using a set of primers (Figure 1, Table

1) designed from a FT orthologues (designated as
BrA2.FT) of B. rapa present within the BAC clone
KBrB070J11 that had been mapped to chromosome A2
http://brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/gbrowse/jic_brassica/.
The PCR products were sequenced, and then assembled to
form a contig that was compared with the sequence of
BrA2.FT. A cDNA sequence from B. oleracea (GenBank
accession EH425279) was designated as BoC6.FT.b, due to
the 99% identity with BnC6.FT.b.
The TNDH linkage map containing 786 markers [58] was
used to map the BnFT paralogues with the primers
designed from the BnFT sequences of Tapidor (Table 1).
The mapped BnFT paralogues were assigned names
according to their linkage group, and where two copies
were located in the same linkage group, they were distinguished by suffixes with "a" or "b" corresponding to the
order of the markers.
Gene nomenclature
In this paper, we abbreviate the full gene nomenclature
for Brassica genes as outlined by Ostergaard & King [59],
so that Bna.FT becomes BnFT. In order to distinguish
between copies of genes located on specific chromosomes
we on occasion indicate this thus: BnC6.FT.a is on chromosome C6.
Sequence analysis
The coding sequences and amino acids of BnFT paralogues were predicted using the software "Softberry
FGENESH" online service http://linux1.softberry.com/
berry.phtml. Multiple alignments of the deduced amino
acid sequences of FT from Arabidopsis and Brassica species
along with PtFT2 (Populus deltoides), Hd3a (Oryza sativa)
and HvFT1 (Hordeum vulgare) were performed using ClustalW http://www.ebi.ac.uk/. Percentage similarities
between pairs of FT orthologues were calculated using
Align http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi.
Phylogenetic relationships were established using MEGA
version 4.1 [60] with neighbour-joining based on
Kimura's [61] two-parameter model. Putative motifs in
intron1 regions were identified using the "Softberry
NSITE-PL" online service http://linux1.softberry.com/
berry.phtml.
Phylogenetic and evolutionary sequence analysis
The coding sequences of all the FT orthologues were
aligned for further analysis. The fraction of synonymous
substitutions (Ks) was obtained using K-Estimator version
6.1 [62]. To estimate the timing of evolution for the different duplication events, we used a median Ks value for
each orthologous pair between two blocks. Calculations
for the dating of the evolutionary events were carried out
using a synonymous mutation rate of 1.4 Ã 10-8 substitutions per synonymous site per year, which was established

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/271

for the CHALCONE SYNTHASE gene in eudicots [63].
Divergence time (T) was estimated using the equation T =
Ks/2 Ã 1.4 Ã 10-8 [22].
The blocks associated with inverted duplications within
the B. napus genome were identified using the TNDH linkage map and confirmed by the colinear array of Arabidopsis
loci based on marker identity in the linkage groups http:/
/www.arabidopsis.org/wublast/index2.jsp.
