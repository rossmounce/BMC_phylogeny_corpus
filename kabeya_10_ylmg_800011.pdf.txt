Abstract
Background: Reminiscent of their free-living cyanobacterial ancestor, chloroplasts proliferate by division coupled with
the partition of nucleoids (DNA-protein complexes). Division of the chloroplast envelope membrane is performed by
constriction of the ring structures at the division site. During division, nucleoids also change their shape and are
distributed essentially equally to the daughter chloroplasts. Although several components of the envelope division
machinery have been identified and characterized, little is known about the molecular components/mechanisms
underlying the change of the nucleoid structure.
Results: In order to identify new factors that are involved in the chloroplast division, we isolated Arabidopsis thaliana
chloroplast division mutants from a pool of random cDNA-overexpressed lines. We found that the overexpression of a
previously uncharacterized gene (AtYLMG1-1) of cyanobacterial origin results in the formation of an irregular network
of chloroplast nucleoids, along with a defect in chloroplast division. In contrast, knockdown of AtYLMG1-1 resulted in a
concentration of the nucleoids into a few large structures, but did not affect chloroplast division. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that AtYLMG1-1 localizes in small puncta on thylakoid membranes, to which a subset of nucleoids
colocalize. In addition, in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongates, overexpression and deletion of ylmG also
displayed defects in nucleoid structure and cell division.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the proper distribution of nucleoids requires the YlmG protein, and the
mechanism is conserved between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. Given that ylmG exists in a cell division gene cluster
downstream of ftsZ in gram-positive bacteria and that ylmG overexpression impaired the chloroplast division, the
nucleoid partitioning by YlmG might be related to chloroplast and cyanobacterial division processes.
Background
Chloroplasts arose from a bacterial endosymbiont related
to extant cyanobacteria. During evolution, the majority of
endosymbiont genes were lost or transferred to the
nuclear genome of the eukaryotic host. Many of the
nucleus-encoded proteins of cyanobacterial origin are
post-translationally targeted to chloroplasts [1]. Therefore, chloroplasts retain several features similar to
cyanobacteria.

Chloroplasts are never synthesized de novo, but proliferate by division, reminiscent of their cyanobacterial
ancestor. As in bacterial division, the chloroplast division
process consists of a partitioning of nucleoids (DNA-protein complexes) and fission of the two envelope membranes. The envelope membrane fission event is
performed by ring structures at the division site, encompassing both the inside and the outside of the two envelopes. Consistent with the endosymbiotic theory, the
division ring contains nucleus-encoded homologs of
cyanobacterial division proteins, such as FtsZ [2] and
ARC6 [3]. The positioning of the FtsZ ring has been
shown to be regulated by cyanobacteria-derived MinD
[4] and MinE [5]. Furthermore, several other fission com-

ponents which were added after endosymbiosis have
been identified, such as DRP5B (ARC5) [6,7], PDV1/
PDV2 [8], and MCD1 [9].
On the other hand, little information is available about
the molecular mechanism underlying the partitioning of
chloroplast nucleoids, although earlier microscopic
observations established that the localization of nucleoids
changes during cell differentiation in land plants and that
nucleoids are nearly equally inherited by daughter chloroplasts during chloroplast division [10,11]. In mature
chloroplasts, nucleoids are observed as small particles
scattered in stroma and associated with the thylakoid
membrane. The condensation of nucleoids has been suggested to be maintained by the HU protein in red algae
and sulfite reductase (SiR) in certain angiosperms [1215]. In A. thaliana, it was reported that multiple small
nucleoids form a filamentous network during chloroplast
division [16]. In addition, the gene silencing of chloroplast DNA gyrase resulted in the appearance of a small
number of large chloroplast nucleoids and abnormal
chloroplast division in Nicotiana benthamiana [17].
These observations suggest a correlation between nucleoid partitioning and chloroplast division. To date, two
proteins have been identified as candidates to anchor
nucleoids to the thylakoid and envelope membranes. The
inner envelope spanning protein PEND and the thylakoid
membrane-spanning protein MFP1 were shown to bind
to DNA [18-20], but both proteins are specific to angiosperms and it remains to be determined how they are
involved in nucleoid partitioning.
In contrast to the chloroplast, some proteins have been
shown to be involved in the partitioning of nucleoids in
bacteria [21]. FtsK, a sequence-directed DNA translocase, cooperates with topoisomerase IV to decatenate the
two sister chromosomes. MreB, a bacterial actin
homolog, is involved in chromosome movement. SetB
interacts with MreB and affects chromosome segregation
[21]. However homologs of these proteins have not been
found in plant genomes. At present, the molecular components/mechanisms underlying the nucleoid partitioning in the chloroplast are little understood.
In this study, we report a chloroplast division mutant
that contains an aberrant network of chloroplast nucleoids from random cDNA overexpressing lines of A. thaliana [22]. We found that overexpression or knockdown of
the previously uncharacterized gene AtYLMG1-1 impairs
normal nucleoid partitioning, and that the overexpression also impairs chloroplast division. Similar results
were obtained in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus
elongatus. These results suggest that the partitioning of
nucleoids requires YlmG. Moreover, the existence of the
ylmG gene in the cell division gene cluster of gram-positive bacterial genomes [23], and the chloroplast division
defect induced by AtYLMG1-1 overexpression, raises the

strong possibility that nucleoid partition by YlmG might
be related to chloroplast division.

Results
Isolation of A. thaliana chloroplast division mutants from
FOX lines

Several proteins required for chloroplast division have
been identified and characterized by both forward and
reverse genetics. These studies yielded the identification
of FtsZ [2], MinD [4], MinE [5], DRP5B/ARC5 [6,7],
ARC3 [24], ARC6 [3], PDV1/PDV2 [8], and MCD1 [9].
Although analyses by using conventional loss-of-function mutants have contributed to the identification of
these chloroplast division proteins, certain key chloroplast division genes may as yet still be uncovered, e.g.
because of the lethality of a given mutation or the functional redundancy provided by duplicate genes. In order
to identify any such unidentified chloroplast division
genes by an alternative approach, we searched for genes
that affect on chloroplast division when the genes are
overexpressed.
To this end, we screened ~15,000 T2 plants of the fulllength cDNA overexpresser (FOX) gene-hunting lines of
A. thaliana [22] by microscopic observation of mesophyll
cell chloroplasts. As a result, we isolated 18 mutant lines
that contained a smaller number and larger size of chloroplasts than the wild type. Of these mutants, two lines
(FN026 and FN028) contained cDNA of the same gene
(At3g07430) downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus
(CaMV) 35S promoter (Figure 1A). All the F1 progeny,
after crossing FN026 and FN028 with the wild type, displayed the mutant phenotype, indicating that the phenotype occurs in a dominant manner. When At3g07430 was
overexpressed in the wild-type plants by a newly constructed 35S-At3g07430 transgene, the resulting plant
contained chloroplasts significantly larger than the wild
type (two times on average, Figure 1B). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses
confirmed that the level of At3g07430 transcript was
increased in the FN026, FN028, and 35S-At3g07430 lines
(Figure 1C). In order to examine the protein level of
At3g07430, we prepared antibodies against At3g07430.
On immunoblots, the antibodies detected a band of ~20
kDa, which is consistent with the predicted size (23 kDa)
of the At3g07430 protein [the transit peptide was predicted by the TargetP http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
TargetP/ and the predicted transit peptide was omitted
for calculation of the molecular mass](Figure 1D). Immunoblot analyses confirmed that At3g07430 protein was
over-produced in the FN028 and 35S-At3g07430 lines
and showed that the At3g07430 protein level of the 35SAt3g07430 line was higher than that of the FN028 line
(Figure 1D). Therefore there is a correlation between the
level of At3g07430 protein (Figure 1D) and the chloro-

plast size (Figure 1A and 1B). In contrast to the protein
level, the At3g07430 transcript level of the FN028 line
was higher than that of the 35S-At3g07430 line. This is
likely due to the difference between inserted transgenes.
The transgene in the FN028 line contains full-length
At3g07430 cDNA whereas the 35S-At3g07430 line contains no 5'-UTR. The presence or absence of the 5'-UTR
probably affects on the efficiency of the translation of
At3g07430 protein.
Although the function of the At3g07430 protein has
not been determined, the database [The Arabidopsis
Information Resource (TAIR); http://www.arabidopsis.org/] indicates that a homozygous T-DNA insertion
mutant of this gene (CS24080) resulted in an embryonically defective phenotype. Because a BLAST search
showed that At3g07430 is homologous to the bacterial
YlmG protein which is of unknown function (for details,
see below), we named the gene AtYLMG1-1.
In order to explore how chloroplast division is impaired
in the AtYLMG1-1 overexpresser, we compared the localization of FtsZ in the overexpresser and the wild type.
Immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-FtsZ2-1
antibody [9] showed FtsZ localization at the chloroplast
division site in the wild type (Figure 1E). In contrast, the
localization of FtsZ was perturbed in the overexpresser,
with fragmented filaments, small rings, and dots
observed in almost all of the chloroplasts (Figure 1E).
Therefore overexpression of AtYLMG1-1 perturbs the
FtsZ ring formation and consequently impairs chloroplast division.

(CBB) staining as the quantitative control. (E) Localization of FtsZ in the

Phylogenetic relationships in the YlmG family

BLAST and PSI BLAST searches along with sequence
alignment indicated that AtYLMG1-1 is homologous to
the bacterial YlmG proteins and the chloroplast-encoded
Ycf19 of unknown function (Figure 2A; see also Additional file 1). The YlmG protein contains a putative membrane spanning YGGT domain (according to the name of
E. coli gene yggT of unknown function). In addition, the
searches showed that YlmG-related sequences are conserved in and specific to bacteria and plastid-carrying
eukaryotes. In the genome of A. thaliana, four homologs
of YlmG were identified (At3g07430, At4g27990,
At5g21920, and At5g36120).
In the genomes of gram-positive bacteria, the ylmG
gene locates downstream of the cell division gene ftsZ in
the dcw (division and cell wall) cluster in the order ylmD,
ylmE, ylmF, ylmG, ylmH, and divIVA [23]. Of these genes,
ylmF (sepF) [25-27] and divIVA [28] have been shown to
be involved in cell division in several bacterial lineages.
These results raise the possibility that the YlmG protein
is also involved in cell division, although inactivation of
ylmG in Streptococcus pneumoniae did not in fact result

in any apparent effect on cell division [23]. On the other
hand, the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii YlmG homolog,
CCB3, has been implicated in cytochrome b6 maturation,
based on the result that CCB3 complemented the defect
in cytochrome b6 maturation in ccb mutants [29]. In addition, disruption of the ortholog in Synechocystis sp.
PCC6803 impaired photosynthetic activity [30].
In order to clarify the relationship of YlmG homologs
in bacteria and eukaryotes, we performed phylogenetic
analyses (Figure 2B). The analyses indicate that oxygenicphotosynthetic organisms (i.e. cyanobacteria and chloroplast-carrying eukaryotes) have two distinct families
(Group I and II) with high support values (local bootstrap
value by the maximum likelihood method/posterior
probability by Bayesian inference, 92/1.00 for group I, 94/
1.00 for Group II). Group II contains only proteins of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, consistent with the
reports suggesting a relationship between CCB3 and photosynthesis. In contrast, group I, to which AtYLMG1-1
belongs, contains proteins of apicomplexan parasites,
which have non-photosynthetic plastids (apicoplasts)
acquired by a red algal secondary endosymbiosis [31].
This pattern of gene distribution suggest that both group
I and II of cyanobacterial ylmG were transferred to the
nuclear genomes of plants by a primary endosymbiosis of
the chloroplast, and that group II, but not group I, was
lost in parallel with the loss of photosynthetic activity in
the ancestor of apicomplexans. Given this scenario and
the existence of ylmG in non-photosynthetic bacteria, it
is suggested that group I (including AtYLMG1-1) and
bacterial YlmG (other than cyanobacterial group II) are
not related to photosynthesis. Supporting this suggestion,
recent studies have shown that the inactivation of the
members of group I (A. thaliana, At4g27990 and
At5g21920; Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, ssr2142) had no
effect on the photosynthesis [30,32].
The phylogenetic analyses categorized four Arabidopsis
YLMGs into the Group I and II and showed a very close
relationship between AtYLMG1-1 and At4g27990. We
therefore named At4g27990 AtYLMG1-2, At5g21920
AtYLMG2, and At5g36120 AtYLMG3, respectively.
The relationship between AtYLMG1-1 and nucleoid
structure

The chloroplast division defect observed above was
caused by AtYLMG1-1 overexpression, and we were not
able to obtain a homozygote of the AtYLMG1-1 T-DNA
insertion mutant (CS24080) as reported in the TAIR
database. To further examine the function of AtYLMG11, we expressed the antisense RNA in the wild-type plant
to knockdown AtYLMG1-1 (Figure 3A). Immunoblot
analysis confirmed that the AtYLMG1-1 protein was
hardly detectable in two antisense lines (Figure 3B). The
result further confirmed that the band detected by the

antibodies is AtYLMG1-1 protein and showed that the
antibodies do not cross-react with AtYLMG1-2 protein.
RT-PCR analyses confirmed that there was a decrease of
the AtYLMG1-1 transcript level in the antisense line and
no effect on the accumulation of other YLMG transcripts
(Figure 3C). In the antisense line, young emerging leaves
and the basal part of expanding leaves exhibited a palegreen phenotype. As leaves matured, the leaf color shifted
to green, with no obvious difference compared to the
wild-type leaves (Figure 3A). These phenotypes were not
observed in the AtYLMG1-1 overexpresser (Figure 1A).

Kabeya et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:57
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/57

Then the morphology of chloroplasts in the AtYLMG11 antisense line was observed under microscopy (Figure
3D). In contrast to the overexpresser, the shape and size
of chloroplasts in expanding leaves were similar to those
in the wild type. In the basal part of expanding leaf of the
antisense line, chloroplasts were pale and smaller than
those of the wild type (Figure 3D). We compared the
localization of FtsZ in the antisense line and the wild type
(Figure 3E). In the antisense line, FtsZ localization was
observed at the chloroplast division site, as in the wild
type. These results suggest that the knockdown of
AtYLMG1-1 had no effect on chloroplast division.
Although the knockdown did not impair envelope division, the existence of ylmG in the dcw cluster of grampositive bacteria suggests the gene product may be
involved in bacterial division. To examine whether
AtYLMG1-1 is required for a process other than envelope
fission that is related to chloroplast division, we observed
chloroplast nucleoids in the antisense line and the wild
type. By 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining,
nucleoids were observed as small particles dispersed in
mature chloroplasts of the wild type (Figure 4A). In contrast, nucleoids were concentrated in a few large structures in both the tip and basal part of the expanding
leaves of the antisense line. When the AtYLMG1-1 overexpresser was examined, the nucleoids were observed as
irregular networks. These networks of nucleoids are similar to those in dividing chloroplasts, although the fluorescent intensity by DAPI-staining was higher in the
overexpresser than in the wild type (Figure 4B, [16]). In
both the antisense line and the overexpresser, DNA gel
blot analyses showed that the amount of chloroplast
DNA compared to the nuclear DNA is similar to that of
the wild type (Figure 4C). These results suggest that
knockdown or overexpression of AtYLMG1-1 does not
affect the replication of chloroplast DNA, but does affect
the morphology of nucleoids.
To examine whether abnormal structure of nucleoids
causes the chloroplast division defect in the AtYLMG1-1
overexpresser or chloroplast division defects result in the
abnormal nucleoids, we observed nucleoids in bona fide
chloroplast division (envelope division) mutants. In contrast to the AtYLMG1-1 overexpresser, the morphology
of chloroplast nucleoids in ftsZ2-1, arc5, and arc6
mutants was similar to the wild type (Figure 4D). Taken
together, the above results suggest that AtYLMG1-1 is
required for the proper distribution of nucleoids in chloroplasts. It is also suggested that abnormality of the
nucleoid structure is not due to a chloroplast division
defect, but rather, the abnormal nucleoids induced by
AtYLMG1-1 overexpression might be a cause of the chloroplast division defect.

Localization of AtYLMG1-1

In order to obtain insight into whether AtYLMG1-1
directly affects the distribution of nucleoids, we examined the localization of AtYLMG1-1. Immunoblot analyses showed that AtYLMG1-1 was enriched in the isolated
chloroplasts as compared with the whole plant protein
(Figure 5A). When the chloroplasts were lysed in hypotonic solution, AtYLMG1-1 was detected in the membrane fraction (pellet), as was the membrane protein

TOC34, suggesting that AtYLMG1-1 is a chloroplast
membrane protein (Figure 5B), as predicted in the database ARAMEMNON http://aramemnon.uni-koeln.de/.
Further fractionation showed that AtYLMG1-1 is exclusively associated with the thylakoid membranes, as is
Lhcb1 (Figure 5C).
We further examined the intrachloroplast localization
of AtYLMG1-1 by immunofluorescence microscopy
using AtYLMG1-1 antibodies. The fluorescent signals
were detected on the punctate structures dispersed in
chloroplasts of the wild-type leaves (Figure 5D). These
results, together with the results of the immunoblotting,
indicate that AtYLMG1-1 localizes in the puncta on thylakoid membranes. Comparison of the immunofluorescence and the DAPI fluorescence showed that some of
the AtYLMG1-1 puncta co-localize with a subset of
nucleoids (Figure 5E).

(total cp), pellet (pellet), and supernatant (sup) fractions were analyzed.
TOC34 was detected as a marker of the membrane protein and the
Rubisco small subunit was detected as a marker of the stromal protein.
(C) Localization of AtYLMG1-1 in the chloroplast membranes. Isolated
chloroplasts from the wild type were lysed and separated into thylakoid and envelope membranes. Proteins of the total chloroplast (total
cp), the envelope fraction (env), and the thylakoid fraction (thy) were
examined with the anti-AtYLMG1-1 antibodies. Lhcb1 was detected as
a marker of the thylakoid protein and TOC34 was detected as a marker
of the envelope protein. (D) Localization of AtYLMG1-1 examined by
immunofluorescence microscopy. Isolated chloroplasts from the wild
type were immunostained with the anti-AtYLMG1-1 antibodies. The
green fluorescence indicates the localization of AtYLMG1-1 and the
red shows the chlorophyll fluorescence. Bar = 5 μm. (E) Relationship
between AtYLMG1-1 puncta and chloroplast nucleoids. Isolated chloroplasts were immunostained with the anti-AtYLMG1-1 antibodies
and counterstained with DAPI. The red indicates the localization of
AtYLMG1-1 and the blue is DAPI fluorescence showing the localization
of DNA. A merged image is also shown. Arrowheads indicate the overlap between the AtYLMG1-1 puncta and nucleoids. Bar = 5 μm.

Knockdown of AtYLMG1-1 had no effect on chloroplast
division, but the lack of an evident chloroplast division
phenotype might be due to the existence of two other
genes related to AtYLMG1-1 (AtYLMG1-2 and
AtYLMG2, shown in Figure 2B). Our phylogenetic analyses indicated that cyanobacterial species have only single
genes encoding group I and group II YlmG proteins,
respectively. Therefore, in order to examine whether the
group I ylmG is involved in bacterial cell division, and
whether the function of ylmG is conserved between chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, we examined the effects of
group I ylmG (ORF ID; Synpcc7942_0477, SylmG1) disruption and overexpression in Synechococcus elongatus.
We disrupted the SylmG1 gene by homologous recombination and insertion of a kanamycin-resistant gene into
the SylmG1 locus (Figure 6A). Because cyanobacteria
have multiple genomes [33,34], PCR was used to determine whether the mutations were completely or incompletely segregated. In the wild type, a 2.5 kbp DNA
fragment that contains SylmG1 gene was amplified. In
contrast, the 2.5 kbp DNA fragment was not detected and
a 3.4 kbp DNA fragment was detected in the five independent kanamycin-resistant transformants (Figure 6A).
These results indicate that the 0.9 kbp nptII gene cassette
was integrated into the SylmG1 genomic locus and that
the mutation was completely segregated. To overexpress
SylmG1, the bacterial consensus II promoter and SylmG1
orf fusion was integrated into a neutral site of the S. elongatus genome [35]. RNA gel blotting indicated that
SylmG1 was overexpressed in the transformants (Figure
6B).
To examine the effect of disruption and overexpression
of the SylmG1 gene on cell division as well as nucleoid
structure, cells in the exponential phase were stained with

DAPI and observed under microscopy. Although the
shape and length of the ΔSylmG1 cells were similar to the
wild type, the intensity of DAPI fluorescence was higher
in ΔSylmG1 (Figure 6C). However, the amount of total
DNA extracted from the same number of cells did not
differ between the wild type and ΔSylmG1 (ΔSylmG1 /
wild type, 1.03 ± 0.01). These results suggest that nucleoid compaction occurred in ΔSylmG1. On the other
hand, SylmG1 overexpressers frequently contained cells
significantly longer than the wild-type cells (two times
longer on average, Figure 6D), suggesting that cell division is partially impaired in the overexpresser. In addition, abnormal distribution of nucleoids was observed in
the overexpresser (Figure 6D and 6E middle panel) and
~2% cells exhibited extremely biased segregation of
nucleoids during cell division (Figure 6E right panel).
These results suggest that the overexpression of SylmG1
impairs nucleoid segregation during cell division. To further examine how cell division is impaired in the overexpresser,
we
examined
FtsZ
localization
by
immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-FtsZ antibodies. The antibodies detected the FtsZ ring at the midcell position in the wild type (Figure 6E). In the SylmG1
overexpressers, the FtsZ rings had a tendency to be
biased towards the side of the cell to which nucleoid density was biased (Figure 6E middle panel). In addition, a
diffuse but higher concentration of FtsZ localization was
observed around the region where nucleoid density was
biased (Figure 6E right panel). These results suggest that
SYlmG1 is required to maintain normal nucleoid structure, and that the FtsZ localization might be related to the
nucleoid partitioning by YlmG.

Discussion
In this study, we screened chloroplast division defective
mutants in the A. thaliana FOX-hunting system. The
purpose of using the FOX line was to identify genes in
which the disruption is lethal or which does not exhibit
an obvious phenotype due to existence of redundant
genes. As a result, we found that AtYLMG1-1 overexpression impairs the normal partitioning of chloroplast
nucleoids and chloroplast division. On the other hand, we
could not obtain a homozygote of the AtYLMG1-1 TDNA insertion mutant (CS24080), and the heterozygote
did not display any difference from the wild type. Therefore, this study is a good example of an effective use of the
FOX line.
The YlmG family of proteins is widely distributed in
bacteria and plastid-carrying eukaryotes. Thus far, there
are two different candidate functions put forward. The
presence of ylmG in the bacterial dcw cluster implies that
the gene product might be related to cell division [23]. On
the other hand, analyses of mutant phenotypes in plants
and cyanobacteria suggest that YlmG is required for nor-

mal activity of the photosystems [29,30,32]. However, in
Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, which has two YlmG-related
genes, disruption of ssl0353 reduced the activity of the
photosystems, while disruption of ssr2142 had no effect
[30]. In A. thaliana, which has four homologs ofthe
YLMG, mutation in At4g27990 and At5g21920 did not
affect the activity of the photosystems [30,32]. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that oxygenic-photosynthetic
organisms have two different groups of YlmG. Group II
contains proteins the mutations of which impair the photosystems, while group I contains proteins the mutations
of which do not affect photosystems. This distribution is
consistent with the fact that species of apicomplexa,
which have non-photosynthetic plastids, possess group I
but not group II. Utilizing genetic approaches, here we
have shown that the group I proteins, AtYLMG1-1 and
SylmG1, are required for the normal partitioning of
nucleoids.
Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that
AtYLMG1-1 localizes in punctate structures on the thylakoid membranes which are adjacent to a subset of nucleoids (Figure 5E). Therefore we further investigated
whether AtYLMG1-1 has a DNA-binding ability, but we
could not get recombinant YlmG proteins by expression
in E. coli due to the lethality of the YlmG overexpresser.
Although the deduced AtYLMG1-1 amino acid sequence
contains no predicted DNA/RNA-binding motif, the isoelectric point of putative AtYLMG1-1 (the deduced transit peptide was removed) is 10.9. The high isoelectric
point is characteristic of a large number of DNA-binding
proteins, such as eukaryotic histones [36], bacterial HU
[37], ribonucleases [38], and bZIP transcription factors
[39], and is known to be required for electrostatic interaction with DNA. Therefore, an AtYLMG1-1 punctate
structure in close proximity to a nucleoid may interact
electrostatically with the nucleoid, thus an anchoring the
nucleoid to the thylakoid membrane.
In A. thaliana, chloroplasts in the AtYLMG1-1 knockdown line contained a small number of enlarged nucleoids, while in the AtYLMG1-1 overexpresser, nucleoids
were observed as filamentous networks (Figure 4A).
These opposite effects suggest that YlmG is required for
the filamentation of nucleoids, and probably also for partitioning. Given that the AtYLMG1-1 punctate structures
exist adjacent to a subset of nucleoids (Figure 5E), it is
possible that the partitioning of nucleoids is gradually
executed from nucleoids connected to the AtYLMG1-1.
Further time-lapse observation will clarify this hypothesis. In this regard, however, stable expression of
AtYLMG1-1-GFP by the AtYLMG1-1 promoter did not
successfully complement the lethal phenotype of the TDNA insertional mutant. Even when the AtYLMG1-1GFP was expressed by AtYLMG1-1 promoter in the wild
type, a fluorescent signal was not detected, suggesting

Page 9 of 13

that the expression level of AtYLMG1-1 is relatively low.
Therefore, other approaches will be required for further
analyses.
As shown in FtsZ, MinD, MinE, ARC6, GC1, and ARC3
[3,24,40-43], alteration in the stoichiometry among these
proteins impairs normal chloroplast division. Because
overexpression of AtYLMG1-1 impairs FtsZ localization
and the chloroplast division (Figure 1E), the alternation of
the AtYLMG1-1 level might disturb the stoichiometric
relationship among the chloroplast division machinery.
However, the AtYLMG1-1 knockdown did not impair
chloroplast division unlike bona fide chloroplast division
proteins. In addition, AtYLMG1-1 localizes in puncta on
thylakoid membranes, it therefore is unlikely that the
AtYLMG1-1 level directly affects on the stoichiometry
among the bona fide chloroplast division proteins.
Previous study [16] and our own observation (Figure
4B) showed that nucleoids exhibit a filamentous network
during chloroplast division. The chloroplast nucleoids in
the AtYLMG1-1 overexpresser were similar to the nucleoid structure during chloroplast division, although the
fluorescent intensity of DAPI staining was higher in the
overexpresser than the wild type. Furthermore, FtsZ
localization and chloroplast/cell division were impaired
in both A. thaliana and S. elongatus by overexpression of
ylmG. In the ylmG overexpresser of S. elongatus, FtsZ
localized predominantly to the area where nucleoids were
biased (Figure 6E). These results imply that nucleoid partitioning by YlmG might be related to the formation of
the FtsZ ring. In several lineages of bacteria, the FtsZ ring
assembly is blocked in the vicinity of nucleoids in order to
partition the genome properly into daughter cells by a
nucleoid occlusion mechanism [44]. However, previous
observations showed that the typical nucleoid occlusion
mechanism does not apparently function in cyanobacteria [25]. Unlike other bacteria containing a single copy of
the genome, cyanobacteria and chloroplasts contain multicopies of the genome. At present, little information is
available about the relationship between nucleoids and
the division of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. Further
study of the function of YlmG should provide significant
insights into this relationship.

Conclusions
Our results show that overexpression of AtYLMG1-1
protein causes formation of filamentous structure of
chloroplast nucleoids, and that knockdown of
AtYLMG1-1 causes the aggregation of nucleoids. In addition, the overexpression impairs FtsZ ring formation and
chloroplast division. Overexpression and deletion of the
ylmG gene in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus displayed defects similar to that in A. thaliana, suggesting that the function of the YlmG protein, which is
engaged in the proper distribution of nucleoids, is con-

served between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.
AtYLMG1-1 localizes in small puncta on thylakoid membranes, which are structures connected with a subset of
nucleoids. The YlmG-containing punctate structures on
the thylakoid membrane required for the proper distribution of nucleoids and the proper distribution of nucleoids
is likely required for both normal FtsZ ring formation and
chloroplast division.

Methods
Growth of organisms

A. thaliana (Col-0) was used as the wild type. A. thaliana
seeds were surface-sterilized, sown on Murashige and
Skoog (MS) plates, and stratified at 4°C for 2 days in the
dark before germination. Plants were grown in controlled-environment chambers with 16 h of light (100
μmol/m2s) and 8 h of dark at 20°C. Seedlings were transferred onto soil and were grown in the controlled-environment chambers.
Synechococcus elongatus was grown in BG-11 medium
[45] in 50 ml flasks on a rotary shaker or 1.2% agar plates
at 30°C in continuous light (100 μmol/m2s). Growth of
cells in the liquid cultures was measured by determining
OD730.
Isolation of chloroplast division mutants in the FOX library

T2 seeds of the A. thaliana FOX lines were germinated
and grown on MS plates for 3 weeks. Tips from expanding leaves were put on a glass slide without fixation, covered with a cover slip, and smashed gently. Samples were
observed with Nomarski differential interference contrast
optics.
To identify the inserted 35S-cDNA in the FOX lines,
the insertion was amplified by PCR using primers 5'GTACGTATTTTTACAACAATTACCAACAAC-3' and
5'-GGATTCAATCTTAAGAAACTTTATTGCCAA-3',
and then sequenced by a primer 5'-CCCCCCCCCCCCD
(A or G or T)-3'.
Construction and generating transgenic A. thaliana

For overexpression of AtYLMG1-1, a genomic region
containing AtYLMG1-1 orf was amplified by primers 5'ATGTCTAGAATGGCCGCCATTACAGCTCTC-3' (the
XbaI site is underlined) and 5'-ATGGAGCTCCGTTTCAACAAAACCATTAGC-3' (the SacI site is
underlined). For expression of antisense AtYLMG1-1
gene, a genomic fragment was amplified by primers 5'ATGTCTAGATCACAGAGATCTCTAATGGCA-3' (the
XbaI site is underlined) and 5'-AGTGAGCTCTCTTCAACAGGCGGAATAAC-3' (the SacI site is underlined). These amplified products were digested with XbaI
and SacI and were inserted between XbaI and SacI sites
of pBI121 vector. Above constructs were transferred to
Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 and introduced into

Page 10 of 13

A. thaliana plants as described [46]. Transformants were
selected on the MS medium containing 30 mg/L kanamycin and T2 plants were used for further analyses.
Construction and generating transgenic S. elongatus

For targeted disruption of SylmG1 gene (ORF ID;
Synpcc7942_0477), a unique restriction site (XbaI site)
was added to the genomic fragment containing SylmG1
by overlap-extension PCR. We amplified a 100 bp of
SylmG1 orf franked by an 850 bp upstream sequence by
primers 5'-CCGCGATCGGCTCTCGCGTGATTGCCAGCG-3' and 5'-CATTCTAGAGGAACCAGCTCAGTAAGACGC-3' (the XbaI site is underlined). A 200 bp of
SylmG1 orf franked by an 850 bp downstream sequence
was amplified by primers 5'-ACTGAGCTGGTTCCTCTAGAGAGCAGTCAGTTCATGCTGAT-3' and 5'ACGGTGGCGATGAGCACGGCTACACCGACT-3'
(the XbaI site is underlined). These two amplified fragments were mixed and fused by PCR using primers 5'CCGCGATCGGCTCTCGCGTGATTGCCAGCG-3'
and
5'-ACGGTGGCGATGAGCACGGCTACACCGACT-3'. The fused fragment was cloned into pGEM-T
easy (Promega). An orf of nptII, which confers resistance
to kanamycin, was amplified by primers 5'-ATGTCTAGAAGCTATGACCATGATTACGAA-3' and 5'-ATGTC
TAGAAAGTCAGCGTAATGCTCTGCC-3' (the XbaI
site is underlined), digested with XbaI, and inserted into
SylmG1 orf in which an XbaI site was introduced as
above. A construct in which the nptII cassette was
inserted in the same orientation was used for gene disruption. Genotypic character of the wild type and kanamycin-resistant mutants (lines #1-5) which were
subjected to PCR analysis with primers 5'-TGACGGACTTCTTCGACCAGATG-3' and 5'-ATTGAACCGC
GTTGGGACAAGG-3'.
For overexpression of SylmG1, a DNA fragment containing SylmG1 orf was amplified by primers 5'-ATGCCCGGGGACAGATTTATTGGACGGTGA-3' and 5'ATGCCCGGGCAAGCGGAGCTCTATCACGAA-3'
(the SmaI site is underlined). The amplified product was
digested by SmaI and inserted into SmaI site of the
pTY1002 vector, which contains a bacterial consensus II
promoter, aadA gene which confers resistence to spectinomycin, and S. elongatus neutral site (position is
2577767-2578661 and 2578658-2580657) [35].
Above constructs were transformed into the wild type
cells. Transformants were selected on BG-11 plates containing 15 mg/L kanamycin or 10 mg/L spectinomycin.
For the SylmG1 disruption, homologous recombination
and segregation were confirmed by PCR using primers 5'TGACGGACTTCTTCGACCAGATG-3' and 5'-ATTGA
ACCGCGTTGGGACAAGG-3'. Overexpression of Sylm
G1 transcript was confirmed by a RNA gel blot analysis
using digoxigenin-labeled SylmG1 specific probe.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR

DNA-free total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using
Primescript (Takara) with oligo(dT)15 primer. PCR was
performed by using primers 5'-CACCGAGAAGTCAACAGCTCGGTCATCGAC-3' and 5'-TCAAGTCTTCCAATTTCTACCCAGTGCTGC-3' for AtYLMG1-1, 5'CCTCAACATATATAACACCATC-3' and 5'-GACAGGTTCAGGTCATAGAAG-3' for At5g21920, 5'-TATCTGAACACTCCGTTGACGGTA-3' and 5'-CAAAGATA
AACGGAATACGATC-3' for At4g27990, 5'-GCAATGGGAAGCAGTGGTGG-3' and 5'-GGGAGAAGAGACGGGTTTCG-3' for GAPDH, and 5'-GGCCAAGATCCAA
GACAAAG-3' and 5'-GTTGACAGCTCTTGGGTGAA3' for UBQ1.
Phylogenetic analyses

Deduced amino acid sequences of YlmG homologs
encoded by the 41 genes were collected by BLAST
searches against public databases. The sequences were
aligned by Clustal X 2.0 [47], manually refined and 82
amino acid residues corresponding to the YGGT domain
were used for the phylogenetic analyses. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed PHYML [48] based on the
WAG model with the discrete gamma model for site-heterogeneity (8 categories with 100 replications). Bayesian
inference was performed with the program MrBayes version 3.1.2 [49] using the WAG matrix assuming a proportion of invariant positions and four gamma-distributed
rates. For the MrBayes consensus trees, 1,000,000 generations were completed with trees collected every 100 generations.
Microscopy

For observation of chloroplast size and number, tips from
expanding leaves were cut and fixed by 3.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated in
0.1 M Na2-EDTA pH 9.0 for 15 min at 50°C. Samples
were analyzed with Nomarski differential interference
contrast optics.
For observation of chloroplast nucleoids, leaves were
cut into small fragments and then digested in 2% cellulase
RS (Yakult), 1% macerozyme (Yakult), 550 mM sorbitol,
and 5 mM MES-KOH pH5.8 at 25°C for 30 min. Resulting protoplasts were stained by 1 μg/ml DAPI in TAN
buffer (0.5 M sucrose, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1.2 mM spermidine, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) or SYBR
Green I (Invitrogen) after fixation with 1% glutaraldehyde.
Localization of FtsZ in A. thaliana expanding leaves
was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using
an anti-AtFtsZ2-1 antibodies as described [9]. Localization of FtsZ in S. elongatus was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-Anabaena FtsZ

antibodies (AS07217, Agrisera) as described [25] except
for Can Get Signal (Toyobo) was used for the antibody
reactions.
Localization of AtYLMG1-1 in chloroplasts of expanding leaves was examined using rabbit anti-AtYLMG1-1
antibodies which were raised against two synthetic peptides (FASLRDRPPGYLNT and TEKSTARSSTLTGS).
Isolated chloroplasts were fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde
dissolved in TAN buffer. For antigen retrieval, fixed chloroplasts were treated by 20 μg/ml proteinaseK in TE buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at 37°C for 10 min.
Chloroplasts were washed twice with PBS. After blocking
with 3% skim milk in PBS for 30 min, the samples were
incubated for 16 h at 4°C with the anti-AtYLMG1-1 antibodies diluted 1:200 in Can Get Signal. Chloroplasts were
then washed twice with 3% skim milk in PBS and then
incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. To
observe chloroplast DNA, samples were stained with 1
μg/ml DAPI.
DNA-blot analysis

Total DNA were extracted from ~3 weeks plants grown
on the MS medium. Three-micrograms DNA were
digested with HindIII and the DNA fragments were separated on 0.8% agarose gels. The restriction fragments
were transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes. Hybridization and detection were carried out as described using
digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes [50]. A psbA probe was
amplified with the primers 5'-TGCATAAGAATGTTGTGCTCAGCC-3' and 5'-CTACTTCTGCAGCTATTGGA
TTGC-3', and a PsbO probe was amplified with the primers 5'-CAATCGTGCGATTTCACAGCCACTC-3' and
5'-TTCTCTTCCAAGTTGTGTCGTCTCC-3'.
Immunoblot analyses

Intact chloroplasts were isolated from ~3 weeks plants
grown on the MS medium as described [20]. To obtain
insoluble (pellet) and soluble (sup) fraction of chloroplasts, intact chloroplasts were resuspended in hypotonic
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA), incubated for 15 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 15,000 g
for 30 min at 4°C. To separate the thylakoid and the envelope membranes, intact chloroplasts were resuspended in
Tricin buffer (50 mM Tricin pH 7.6 and 5 mM MgCl2),
frozen at -80°C and thawed. The chloroplast lysate was
separated in a sucrose density gradient (lysate/0.6 M/1.0
M/1.2 M/1.5 M) by a centrifugation at 113,000 g for 1 h at
4°C. The envelope membrane (at the 0.6 M/1.0 M interface) and the thylakoid membrane (at the 1.2 M/1.5 M
interface) were collected.
Immunoblot analyses were performed as described [50]
except that 17.5% polyacrylamide gel was used and 10
mM CAPS buffer containing 10% methanol were used for

the transfer onto PVDF membrane. AtYLMG1-1 was
detected with the anti-AtYLMG1-1 antibodies (1: 1,000).
Anti-TOC34 (AS07 238, Agrisera) and Anti-Lhcb1 (AS01
004, Agrisera) were used at dilutions of 1: 5,000 and 1:
2,000, respectively. After detection of these proteins, the
Rubisco small subunit was detected by staining the same
membranes with CBB.
