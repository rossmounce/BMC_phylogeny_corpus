A close-up view on ITS2 evolution and speciation
- a case study in the Ulvophyceae (Chlorophyta,
Viridiplantae)
Lenka Caisová1,2,3*†, Birger Marin1† and Michael Melkonian1

Abstract
Background: The second Internal Transcriber Spacer (ITS2) is a fast evolving part of the nuclear-encoded rRNA
operon located between the 5.8S and 28S rRNA genes. Based on crossing experiments it has been proposed that
even a single Compensatory Base Change (CBC) in helices 2 and 3 of the ITS2 indicates sexual incompatibility and
thus separates biological species. Taxa without any CBC in these ITS2 regions were designated as a ‘CBC clade’.
However, in depth comparative analyses of ITS2 secondary structures, ITS2 phylogeny, the origin of CBCs, and their
relationship to biological species have rarely been performed. To gain ‘close-up’ insights into ITS2 evolution, (1) 86
sequences of ITS2 including secondary structures have been investigated in the green algal order Ulvales
(Chlorophyta, Viridiplantae), (2) after recording all existing substitutions, CBCs and hemi-CBCs (hCBCs) were mapped
upon the ITS2 phylogeny, rather than merely comparing ITS2 characters among pairs of taxa, and (3) the relation
between CBCs, hCBCs, CBC clades, and the taxonomic level of organisms was investigated in detail.
Results: High sequence and length conservation allowed the generation of an ITS2 consensus secondary structure,
and introduction of a novel numbering system of ITS2 nucleotides and base pairs. Alignments and analyses were
based on this structural information, leading to the following results: (1) in the Ulvales, the presence of a CBC is
not linked to any particular taxonomic level, (2) most CBC ‘clades’ sensu Coleman are paraphyletic, and should
rather be termed CBC grades. (3) the phenetic approach of pairwise comparison of sequences can be misleading,
and thus, CBCs/hCBCs must be investigated in their evolutionary context, including homoplasy events (4) CBCs and
hCBCs in ITS2 helices evolved independently, and we found no evidence for a CBC that originated via a two-fold
hCBC substitution.
Conclusions: Our case study revealed several discrepancies between ITS2 evolution in the Ulvales and generally
accepted assumptions underlying ITS2 evolution as e.g. the CBC clade concept. Therefore, we developed a suite of
methods providing a critical ‘close-up’ view into ITS2 evolution by directly tracing the evolutionary history of
individual positions, and we caution against a non-critical use of the ITS2 CBC clade concept for species
delimitation.

Background
The second Internal Transcriber Spacer (ITS2) is a fast
evolving part of the nuclear-encoded rRNA operon,
located between 5.8S and 28S rRNA genes. To obtain
mature, functional rRNA molecules, the entire rRNA
operon is transcribed as a single precursor rRNA,

followed by complex excision processes of both ITS
regions [1-3]. Similar to introns and non-transcribed
spacer regions, the primary sequence of ITS2 appears
highly variable, however, the excision process of the
ITS2 RNA transcript (briefly termed’ITS2’) requires certain secondary structure motifs, which seem to be conserved across most eukaryotes [4-6]. ITS2 usually folds
into a clover leaf-like secondary structure with four
helices, two of which show additional sequence/structure motifs that again appear to be essential for successful excision of ITS2 from the precursor rRNA molecule.

In contrast to Helix1 and Helix 4, which are highly variable in sequence and length, Helix 2 is more conserved
and almost always displays at least one pyrimidine-pyrimidine (UxU, UxC, CxC) mismatch [4,7]. Helix 3 is
usually much longer than the other helices, and its apical region shows high sequence conservation, often
including a four nucleotide motif (YGGY) [6,7]. This
motif is close to the crucial cleavage site C2 where the
degradation process of ITS2, i.e. the formation of the
mature 5.8S and 28S rRNA, is initiated by a hitherto
unidentified endonuclease [8-11]. Only in a few eukaryotes the ITS2 apparently deviates from these common
features [6,12], or is absent altogether [13].
The presence of a stable and functionally important
RNA secondary structure can be revealed by comparing
homologous positions among different organisms, and
searching for non-conserved, but co-evolving nucleotides, which maintain base pairing in the RNA transcript, thus indicating the presence of intra-molecular
RNA helices [4,14,15]. Generally, RNA helices can retain
base pairing by two evolutionary processes, double-sided
changes (i.e. co-evolution), and single-sided changes. In
the former, a substitution on one side of the helix (e.g.
G ® C), which would disrupt base pairing, can be compensated by changing the nucleotide at the opposite side
(i.e. C ® G). The whole double-sided change (G-C ®
C-G) is called Compensatory Base Change (CBC;
[4,14]). The existence of the non-canonical ‘wobble’ base
pair (G-U), which is thermodynamically stable in RNA
molecules, allows even single-sided changes that perfectly retain base pairing, and are accordingly named
hemi-Compensatory Base Change (hCBC; e.g. G-U ®
G-C; [15,16]).
For two reasons ITS2 is thought to be an excellent
marker for molecular phylogenetic studies, especially at
lower taxonomic levels. Obviously, the highly divergent
and fast-evolving ITS2 can discriminate among closely
related organisms, which otherwise display almost identical sequences, e.g. in the conserved rRNA genes. This
explains the frequent use of ITS2 for calculation of
lower-level phylogenetic trees in many eukaryotic
lineages [e.g. [17-23]]. In addition, ITS2 data have been
used to predict the ability to interbreed successfully,
thereby determining the limits between ‘biological’ species and populations [20,24,25]. The latter approach,
introduced by Coleman and coworkers, consists basically
of a pairwise comparison of ITS2 secondary structures
from closely related organisms, considering only compensatory changes within ITS2 helices. Computing presence/absence of even a single Compensatory Base
Change (CBC) in the conserved regions of helices 2 and
3 of ITS2 revealed a correlation with incompatibility/
ability to sexually cross [25,26]. In contrast, changes in
the less conserved regions (e.g. in helices 1 and 4) as

Page 2 of 24

well as hCBCs in the conserved parts did not correlate
with interbreeding ability. Thus, Coleman [25] defined a
group of organisms without any CBC in conserved ITS2
regions (i.e. in helices 2 and 3) as a CBC clade, which is
distinguished from other CBC clades by at least one
CBC in these regions. In addition, a group of organisms
producing compatible gametes that can form zygotes
was named Z clade [25]. Although members of different
CBC clades apparently always fall into different Z clades,
which are isolated by reproduction barriers such as
inability of gamete fusion or other pre-zygotic isolation
mechanisms, it is still possible that the members of the
same CBC clade are unable to mate, and thus fall into
two or more Z clades [15,27]. Moreover, a single CBC
clade/Z clade is not necessarily equivalent to one ‘biological species’, defined by its fertile offspring, because a
zygote may be unable to develop further due to postzygotic barriers, e.g. failure to perform meiosis. In summary, a CBC clade corresponds to one or more Z
clades, which itself may contain one or more ‘biological’
species.
Most described species have been defined solely on
the basis of structural characters, and may be labeled
‘morphospecies’. What is the relation of CBC clades, Z
clades, and ‘biological’ species to previously described
morphospecies? Unfortunately, no general rule can be
applied here, as e.g. previously recognized by Coleman
[26]. As one extreme case, morphologically identical
organisms, classified as a single taxonomic species,
represent one CBC clade containing multiple Z clades
(e.g. Chlamydomonas allensworthii [28] or are a composite of several CBC clades and even more Z clades (e.g.
Pandorina morum [29]. We may designate such cases
cryptic species complexes (= type C in [26]). At the
other extreme, morphologically diverse organisms, classified as different species or even genera, can successfully interbreed, and then belong to the same Z clade as
well as CBC clade (e.g. Hawaiian silverswords - Argyroxipium, Dubautia, Wilkesia [30]; and genera of the Altingiaceae - Liquidambar, Altingia [31]), and may be
regarded as hybridization events (= type A in [26]).
It has nevertheless been concluded that among potential mates, increasing ITS2 divergence is correlated with
decreasing potential for mating and zygote formation
[26]. Since there is no obvious functional link between
ITS2 sequence and the process of gamete fusion, the
observed correlation between CBCs and inability to
cross has been explained by either similar or faster evolutionary rates of genes that control gamete interactions,
compared to the rate of CBC-type changes in conserved
ITS2 regions [25,26].
Therefore, it appears necessary to study the evolution
of CBCs in paired ITS2 regions during recent and
ancient diversification processes, and to estimate the

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/262

frequency of these events in relation to mating barriers
and the origin of new species. Regarding the first aspect,
it is currently unclear whether CBCs usually evolve via
two simultaneous changes on both sides of a helix, or
instead represent the sum of two changes that occurred
at different times, either as a series of two consecutive
hCBC-type substitutions, or involving a non-paired
intermediate state. It is further unknown whether CBC/
hCBC rates and frequencies are similar throughout ITS2
helices, or whether these parameters are unequally distributed among ITS2 base pairs due to CBC/hCBC hotspots or CBC/hCBC silencing. Finally, regarding the
importance especially of ITS2 CBCs for molecular taxonomic concepts, it appears surprising that the phylogeny
of CBC-type changes usually plays no role in such analyses, whereas in other phylogenetic and taxonomic
investigations, application of cladistic principles, i.e.
strict distinction between plesiomorphic and apomorphic character states, is a commonality. In fact,
CBCs are mostly visualized phenetically, i.e. as a pairwise comparison between sister species [e.g.
[20,21,32-35]]. Similarly, the homoplasy background of
CBC-type substitutions in ITS2, i.e. presence of reversals, parallelisms, and convergences, has not been analyzed so far.
In the present contribution, we investigated these
questions in detail, selecting the green algal order
Ulvales (Ulvophyceae, Chlorophyta) as a case study. The
Ulvales provide (1) many available ITS2 and 18S rDNA
sequences, (2) data from crossing experiments, (3) morphological and taxonomic diversity, and (4) distribution
over freshwater, brackish, and marine habitats. We
reconstructed a consensus ITS2 secondary structure for
the Ulvales, and introduced a new numbering system
based on positional homology. By mapping all evolutionary changes that occurred in ITS2 helices across the
investigated Ulvales, we found that CBC clades mostly
do not correlate with the level of ‘biological’ species, and
are often paraphyletic assemblies (here named CBC
grades) rather than genuine monophyletic (holophyletic)
clades. Furthermore, our analyses revealed CBCs and
hCBCs as clearly independent evolutionary processes,
which only rarely occurred in the same ITS2 base pairs,
largely characterized different branches in the phylogenetic tree, and displayed different homoplasy background levels. In particular, we found no evidence that
would support the hypothesis that CBCs evolved
through two consecutive hCBCs.

Results
Folding methods for ITS2

Using the programs MFold [36] and RNAstructure
[37,38], homologous regions of the ITS2 sequence were
generally folded as comparable secondary structural

Page 3 of 24

motifs, and revealed four universal helices present in all
86 Ulvales analyzed here (Helix 1 to 4 in Figure 1).
Comparison of these universal helices across taxa identified several base-paired positions that retained pairing
by covariation (compensatory base changes, CBCs; e.g.
C-G ⇒ A-U), or by a change in only one position
(hemi-compensatory base changes, hCBCs; e.g. C-G ⇒
U-G). Numerous CBCs and hCBCs confirmed the ‘genuine’ structure of ITS2, and rejected artificial folding
patterns.
Using another tool for ITS2 secondary structure generation, i.e. 4SALE [39,40] combined with the ITS2
Database III [41], resulted in conflicting folding patterns
for different taxa, and the only common feature among
these folds was the presence of four helices (Additional
file 1). However, these helices were often generated
from non-homologous sequence regions, and thus could
not be compared across taxa. A check of ‘template models’ from the ITS2 Database III revealed only a few ulvophyte ITS2 folds that, except for some discrepancies in
Helix 3, corresponded to our consensus secondary
structure model (e.g. ITS2 of Ulva fasciata; Additional
file 1). Although most other ‘template models’ of ulvophytes showed a correctly folded Helix 2, the remaining
helices contained several folding errors, as is obvious
from clearly homologous sequence motifs in non-comparable secondary structural placements (see Additional
file 1).
Consensus secondary structure model of ITS2

The ITS2 showed only moderate length variation across
the Ulvales, ranging from 171 (uncultured Urospora
AJ626846) up to 205 (Acrochaete sp. EF595429) or 235
nucleotides (Kornmannia; see below). The high degree
of secondary structure conservation allowed the unambiguous alignment of most ITS2 positions, and generation of a consensus secondary structure model of the
ITS2 in the Ulvales (Figure 1). This model included a
variability map, i.e. all positions were classified into different categories: (1) 100% conserved nucleotides, (2)
highly conserved positions with only one unique change
within the Ulvales, (3) moderately conserved positions
with 2-5 changes, (4) variable positions with > 6
changes, (5) expansion segments (regions without length
conservation, e.g. terminal loops of helices), and (6) specific insertions, i.e. positions that were present in only
some taxa. In addition, comments in Figure 1 provide
an overview about taxonomic entities with unique evolutionary changes (categories 2, 3), and with ITS2 length
variations (categories 5, 6).
Within the Ulvales, five ITS2 regions were well conserved in primary sequence and secondary structure: (1)
the first 2-3 base pairs of Helix 1, (2) the spacer
between Helix 1 and Helix 2, (3) the basal part of Helix

families (Kornmanniaceae, Bolbocoleonaceae, Ulvaceae, Capsosiphonaceae and Gomontiaceae). B) ITS2 consensus of the Capsosiphonaceae and
Gomontiaceae (41 sequences analyzed), showing extremely high conservation. Nucleotide letters shown in both ITS2 diagrams (A, B) refer to the
most frequently occurring character states among the analyzed taxa, obtained via 70% majority rule consensus sequences. Positions without
‘dominant’ character state among the investigated Ulvales were integrated as circles, or flagged as expansion segments. Invariable positions
were drawn in black, whereas for variable positions, the conservation/variability level was quantified by the number of evolutionary changes
during the diversification of the Ulvales, and indicated by various colors (nucleotides and/or circles in ochre, blue, or red). 129 positions were
present in all studied Ulvales, and were used for a ‘universal’ numbering system of ITS2 positions. The ‘non-universal’ positions were labeled with
subscript numbers, combined with the previous ‘universal’ position number. Gray shades indicate the conserved parts of helices 2 and 3 [6].
Several comments in the Figure refer to non-homoplasious CBCs (black frames), inserted positions characteristic for selected taxa, and the length
variation of expansion segments. The CBC/hCBC homoplasy background in the ITS2 diagram (A) is indicated by ochre/blue/pale pink shades
with the restriction to positions with CBCs/hCBCs/CBCs+hCBCs respectively. C) Simplified ITS2 diagram of Kornmannia displaying a unique,

2, containing 10 base pairs, (4) the spacer between Helix
2 and Helix 3, and (5) the apical part of Helix 3 (excluding the terminal loop) covering ca. 18-23 base pairs (Figure 1A). The remaining ITS2 motifs, including Helix 4
and the apical part of Helix 1, were much less
conserved.
One major subclade of the Ulvales, encompassing the
families Capsosiphonaceae and Gomontiaceae (often
referred to as Acrosiphonaceae and Ulothrichaceae,
respectively) was characterized by an even higher conservation of ITS2 positions, and therefore, a separate
consensus secondary structure model was designed for
these two families (Figure 1B). Among these families,
the consensus model revealed high conservation for several ITS2 regions, which were rather variable among
other Ulvales, e.g. the complete Helix 3 (compare Figure
1A and 1B).
One genus, Kornmannia, was exceptional due to the
presence of an additional helix, located between Helix 3
and Helix 4, and an unusually long Helix 4 (Figure 1C).
Introduction of a numbering system for ITS2 positions

The ITS2 consensus structure diagram (Figure 1A) provided the opportunity to introduce a novel numbering
system of ITS2 nucleotides for unambiguous positional
descriptions of base pairs, CBCs, hCBCs, and indels. Figure 1A revealed 129 homologous characters that were
present in all Ulvales investigated here. These 129 ‘universal’ characters served as the backbone of the new
numbering system. In contrast, non-universal positions
(variability categories 5 and 6 in Figure 1A) were labeled
with subscript numbers (1, 2, 3...) combined with the 5’
-preceding ‘universal’ nucleotide number (see Figure
1A). For example, ‘universal’ nt 7 at the 5´end of Helix
1 is followed by two non-universal nucleotides that were
present only in Ulvaria and the U. lactuca clade, and
these positions were named 71 and 72 (Figure 1A). The
additional helix unique for Kornmannia was labeled in
the same way (Figure 1C). As universal position number
‘one’, we arbitrarily designated the first moderately conserved (i.e. category 3) nucleotide of ITS2, since the 5’end region was non-conserved in sequence and length
(labeled 1-1, 1-2 ... 1-6 in Figure 1A).
ITS2 and 18S rDNA phylogeny of the Ulvales

ITS2 provided 152 alignable characters for phylogenetic
analyses of 86 taxa in the Ulvales (Figure 2). As an additional control, we performed phylogenetic analyses of an
18S rDNA data set of 74 Ulvales using 1702 characters
(Additional file 2). The taxon sampling in both data sets
was largely non-congruent since 18S rDNA + ITS2 data
were available for only 15 strains (taxa marked with
hash (#) in Additional file 2 and Figure 2). Five families
of the order Ulvales and Pseudoneochloris marina (a

Page 5 of 24

non-resolved single branch) were well represented in
both alignments, whereas the families Chlorocystidaceae
and Phaeophilaceae (Additional file 2) were missing in
the ITS2 data set.
Although both phylogenies cannot be directly compared, the absence of conflicting branching patterns suggested that the phylogenetic signal in ITS2 was sufficient
to resolve most relationships among the Ulvales correctly. Among basal branches (family and genus levels)
we observed almost no conflict case (exception: Pseudoneochloris). However, overall support values differed
considerably between 18S rDNA and ITS2 phylogenies
owing to the lower number of aligned ITS2 characters all basal branches of families gained high support by
18S rDNA data, whereas the corresponding branches in
the ITS2 phylogeny were usually non-supported (Additional file 2, Figure 2). The only exception was the
family Ulvaceae that gained high support by ITS2 also.
At the genus and species level, several possible cases of
conflict between 18S rDNA and ITS2 analyses were
observed, e.g. relationships among the genera Acrochaete, Umbraulva, Ulvaria and Percursaria. However, a
reliable comparison between these phylogenies was not
possible due to the non-congruent taxon sampling, and
some likely misidentified taxa or presence of contaminations (e.g. ‘Blidingia minima’ as a member of the family
Capsosiphonaceae or Acrochaete spp. growing on
‘Umbraulva japonica’ as an epiphyte in Figure 2).
Compensatory Base Changes (CBCs) and hemiCompensatory Base Changes (hCBCs)

To identify all positions that co-evolved as double/single-sided changes in an ITS2 helix with conservation of
base pairing (CBCs/hCBCs) within the Ulvales, an
exhaustive apomorphy search was performed among
paired ITS2 characters (Additional file 3, 4). In total, 38
CBCs were revealed over all helices and only 15 of these
were discovered in the relatively conserved regions of
helices 2 and 3 (gray shades in Figure 1A) and were collectively termed ‘H2+3_CBCs’ (bold and larger font size
in Figure 2 and Additional file 5). In the same way, all
51 hCBCs have been depicted in Figure 3 (hCBCs in
bold and large font size). From the 15 H2+3_CBCs only
one (Helix 3: 75/105 in Ulvaceae) was adjacent to a
bulge and this is the only example in which a pairing
might have moved over one nucleotide on one strand
(slippage). Regarding hCBCs, 12 hCBCs from 34 H2
+3_hCBCs were located next to a bulge. Furthermore,
two different categories of CBCs/hCBCs could be distinguished: CBCs/hCBCs that uniquely characterized a single branch/clade within the Ulvales (Non-Homoplasious
Synapomorphies - NHSs; NHS CBCs are illustrated in
black frames in Figure 1), and CBCs/hCBCs that evolved
in a homoplasious manner (HS; see below).

Figure 2 Evolution of CBCs in paired ITS2 nucleotides mapped upon the ITS2 phylogeny of the Ulvales. All compensatory base changes
(CBCs) accompanied by appropriate Helix (H) and numbers of positions (by specific nucleotide numbers) were linked to the nodes/branches
where they evolved. CBCs that occurred in the conserved regions of helices 2 and 3 (H2+3_CBCs) were shown in bold and in larger font size
and their corresponding branches were depicted in bold as well. Branches in blue are characterized by CBCs and hCBCs, whereas branches in
red color have CBC support exclusively. Only those taxa, which formed a terminal, monophyletic clade and were not differentiated by any CBC
in the conserved parts of ITS2 helices (H2+3_CBCs), were here designated as a CBC clade, and were highlighted in pink background color. In
contrast, taxa lacking distinguishing H2+3_CBCs, which formed non-monophyletic assemblies in the phylogenetic tree, were designated as ‘CBC
grades’, and shaded in orange color. Note that all CBC grades contained nested CBC clades. Typically, a CBC clade/grade can be traced back to a
common ancestor (basal branch) characterized by synapomorphic H2+3_CBCs, except for one ‘plesiomorphic CBC grade’ (green color)
characterized merely by shared plesiomorphies in helices 2 and 3 of ITS2. CBCs either evolved as unique (non-homoplasious; NHS) or
homoplasious synapomorphies (HS). CBCs were homoplasious due to parallelisms (PAR 1-7), convergences (CONV 1-3) and/or reversals (REV 1-2),
and all these changes were mapped upon the tree (encircled numbers). The tree topology was based on 152 aligned ITS2 characters from 86
taxa analyzed by maximum likelihood (ML). The branch separating the Capsosiphonaceae/Gomontiaceae from the remaining Ulvales was used
for rooting the tree. Four interrupted branches have been graphically reduced to 50% or 75% of the original length. Significances at branches
from left to right are bootstrap percentages (ML, NJ, and MP) and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Newly determined sequences (12) are in bold
(for accession numbers see Additional file 7). Taxa/strains with hash mark (#) were also analyzed in the 18S rRNA phylogeny (Additional file 2).

Figure 3 Evolution of hCBCs in ITS2 base pairs in the Ulvales. Hemi-compensatory base changes (hCBCs) referring to conserved parts of
helices 2 and 3 were shown in bold and in larger font size and their corresponding branches were illustrated in bold. Branches in red are
characterized by hCBCs and CBCs, whereas branches in green color have hCBC support exclusively. Encircled numbers were used to indicate all
hCBC-type parallelisms (hPAR 1-14) and reversals (hREV 1-6); hCBC-type convergences were not found in the ITS2 of the Ulvales.

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/262

All 38 CBCs and 51 hCBCs, including the homoplasious
changes, were mapped upon the phylogenetic tree
inferred from the ITS2 sequences comparisons (Figures
2, 3), and were assigned to 24 and 41 clades/branches,
respectively (colored in Figures 2, 3) where they evolved
(the total number of tree branches is: 105 [Figures 2,
3]). Interestingly, CBCs and hCBCs were distributed
over both terminal and internal branches on the tree
(Figures 2, 3).
CBC clades and CBC grades

For CBC clade-based concepts of species delimitation,
either Helix 3 alone (the relatively conserved 30 base
pair region in proximity to the GGU motif; [26]) or the
relatively conserved regions of helices 2 and 3 [e.g. [6]]
have been considered as essential. A group of organisms
characterized by the absence of any CBCs in these conserved pairing regions of ITS2 has been defined as a
CBC clade sensu Coleman [[25], page 6]. In total 15 H2
+3_CBCs were found in the Ulvales (comprising 50 currently accepted species [42]) and were assigned to 11
branches/clades flagged by blue/red colors in bold in
Figure 2. All 15 H2+3_CBCs and their appropriate
branches were analyzed for matching the CBC clade
definition sensu Coleman [25]. In summary, only two of
the 15 H2+3_CBCs were mapped on species-branches
within species-rich genera (Acrochaete heteroclada, A.
viridis; Figure 2).
Furthermore, it has been revealed that four of 11
branches defined monophyletic CBC clades that differed
from all ‘outgroup’ taxa by the presence of at least one
H2+3_CBC (clades shaded in pink in Figure 2; e.g.
Monostroma, Acrosiphonia). Other major clades were
also characterized by H2+3_CBCs, but contained nested
subclades that again gained novel synapomorphic H2
+3_CBCs. In these cases, the nested (monophyletic) subclades formed genuine CBC clades, whereas the remaining taxa (major clade minus nested CBC clades) formed
non-monophyletic assemblies of organisms, which were
not distinguished by any CBC-type difference in helices
2 and 3 (shaded in orange or green colors in Figure 2).
In other words, we found the majority of the Ulvales
within non-monophyletic groups that clearly failed to
meet the classical definition of CBC clades (see above).
Because the term CBC clade is restricted to ITS2 clades
(i.e. monophyletic lineages) lacking of any H2+3_CBCs
among its members [25], we herein introduce the term
‘CBC grade’ (orange color in Figure 2), defining a nonmonophyletic assemblage of organisms without any H2
+3_CBC among its members. Four of five CBC grades
were differentiated from all non-members by at least
one H2+3_CBC, i.e. delineated from derived taxa (=
nested CBC clades) as well as ‘outgroup’ taxa. As an
example, all Ulvaceae to the exclusion of the derived

Page 8 of 24

members Acrochaete heteroclada and A. viridis (37 taxa
in Figure 2) represented a single paraphyletic CBC
grade, well differentiated from other Ulvales by three
H2+3_CBCs, and from A. heteroclada and A. viridis by
one H2+3_CBC, respectively. Similarly, the Kornmanniaceae formed a CBC grade to the exclusion of Kornmannia, which itself formed a terminal CBC clade.
As an exception, one of the CBC grades [Capsosiphonaceae + Gomontiaceae excluding three nested CBC
clades (Acrosiphonia, Monostroma, Collinsiella ) and
one nested CBC grade (Gloeotilopsis clade + Ulothrix
zonata; Figure 2), 20 taxa marked in green background
in Figure 2] was devoid of any synapomorphic CBC in
the ITS2 helices. These 20 taxa shared plesiomorphic
character states for all ITS2 base pairs in the conserved
regions of helices 2 and 3, and represented a ‘plesiomorphic CBC grade’, merely united by absence of any
synapomorphy of the H2+3_CBC type.
Usually, CBC substitutions between sister taxa are identified and quantified by pairwise comparison of their ITS2
secondary structures, i.e. by a phenetic rather than a phylogenetic approach. In one case (base pair 21/40 in Helix 2
of Acrochaete heteroclada and A. viridis) it became
obvious that such a phenetic comparison can be misleading when the third relevant ‘taxon’, i.e. the common ancestor of A. heteroclada and A. viridis, is not taken into
consideration (for details, see Figure 4). Whereas the phenetic method would suggest that both taxa differ merely
by a single hCBC, the synapomorphy search revealed presence of a CBC plus one hCBC, and thus identified A. viridis and A. heteroclada as two different species.
CBCs, hCBCs, branch lengths and evolutionary rates

To correlate the frequency of CBCs and hCBCs in ITS2
helices with the evolutionary rates of the branches
where they occurred [measured by branch lengths (evolutionary steps), considering base-paired positions exclusively], these parameters were recorded for all 105
branches in the ITS2 phylogeny (Figure 2) and plotted
as diagrams (Additional file 6). The majority (79% for
CBCs, 58% for hCBCs) of shorter branches (lengths of
up to nine evolutionary steps) lacked any CBC and/or
hCBC, and thus showed non-compensatory changes
exclusively (base pair ⇔ non-pair). Thus, branch lengths
appeared neither strictly correlated with the number of
CBCs, nor hCBCs. However, when only those branches
with one and two CBCs were considered, the number of
CBCs seemed weakly correlated with branch lengths up
to about 13 evolutionary steps (Additional file 6A).
Among the long branches (lengths > 13), the relation to
CBCs was unclear due to the low sampling (only three
branches), and the ‘exceptional’ long branch of Bolbocoleon without any CBC. Only the remaining two long
branches (Ulvaceae and Kornmannia) showed the

Figure 4 Phenetic versus phylogenetic approach of species delimitation of two taxa of Acrochaete. A) Phenetic approach, i.e. pair wise
comparison without consideration of the plesiomorphic status of the base pair 21/40 in the conserved region of Helix2 (H2) revealed that A.
viridis and A. heteroclada differ by only one hCBC (A-U vs. G-U, respectively). In contrast, B) a phylogenetic approach taking the ancestral status
(G-C) of the respective base pair into consideration resulted in the difference of one CBC (G-C ® A-U) + one hCBC (G-C ® G-U) between these
two taxa. Whereas the phenetic approach would,- according to the CBC clade concept, regard A. viridis and A. heteroclada to belong to a single
CBC clade (and potentially the same species), the phylogenetic approach showed A. viridis and A. heteroclada as two separate species. Base pair

dashed arrows.

highest observed numbers of CBCs (four, respectively),
indicating some correlation with branch lengths. This
correlation, however, appeared non-linear but instead
resembled a hyperbolic saturation curve. To analyze
saturation, we calculated the CBC vs. branch length
ratio (CBC_R, considering only branches with > 0
CBCs), and clearly found negative correlation between
CBC_R (blue squares in Additional file 6A) and branch
lengths. As an example, all four evolutionary steps that
constituted the short branch of Gloeotilopsis sp. ACOI
co-evolved as two CBCs (CBC_R 100%), whereas in
Kornmannia, only eight out of 21 (CBC_R 38%) evolutionary steps made up four CBCs.
Regarding hCBCs, the relation to branch lengths was
unclear due to the generally low number of hCBCs per
branch, i.e. mostly one, rarely two (only seven branches),
or three (only Bolbocoleon, Additional file 6B). Among
clades with > 0 hCBCs, the hCBC vs. branch length
ratio (hCBC_R) was similarly decreasing between the
short branches (hCBC_R 33-100%, for branch lengths
up to three) and the longer branches where hCBC_R
approached 4.8% for Kornmannia (one hCBCs vs. 21
evolutionary steps; blue squares in Additional file 6B),
again indicating saturation.
Evolutionary relationship between CBCs and hCBCs, and
their parallelisms, convergences, and reversals

When CBCs and hCBCs were mapped upon clades/
branches of phylogenetic trees using an exhaustive

synapomorphy search, their occurrence was clearly noncorrelated with each other (compare Figures 2 and 3).
Only 11 branches shared CBCs + hCBCs (branches in
blue + red, respectively), whereas 12/29 branches displayed CBCs/hCBCs exclusively (branches in red/green
in Figures 2, 3 respectively). Branches with exclusive
CBC support (red branches in Figure 2) represented
eight terminal branches as well as four internal divergences. Similarly, their hCBC counterparts (green
branches in Figure 3) were distributed over 11 terminal
and 18 internal branches.
The synapomorphy search strategy further revealed all
existing homoplasious changes of ITS2 base pairs, i.e.,
all parallelisms, convergences, and reversals of CBCs
and hCBCs in the Ulvales (Additional files 3, 4). These
homoplasies were also mapped on the tree topologies,
associated with branches (Figures 2, 3). As a parallelism,
we regarded identical evolutionary changes in unrelated
lineages, starting from the same plesiomorphic character
state, and applied a simple numbering system, i.e. PAR1,
PAR 2 etc. for parallel CBCs, and hPAR1, hPAR2 etc.
for hCBCs. A given parallelism can refer to up to five
unrelated lineages (e.g. hPAR 14; Figure 3, Additional
file 4). Convergences differed from parallelisms by starting from different ancestral character states, e.g. G-C ⇒
A-U and U-A ⇒ A-U (labeled CONV in Figures and
Additional files). A change back to a plesiomorphic
character state, i.e. a reversal, was labeled REV for
CBCs, and hREV for hCBCs. Figure 5 provides selected

Figure 5 Parallelisms, convergences, and reversals in ITS2 base pairs, as shown by selected examples. All three cases of homoplasious
changes occurred in ITS2 pairs 54/121 and 55/120 in the basal part of Helix 3 in the Ulvales. For all taxa in the simplified phylogram (derived
from Figure 2), sequences of the basal part of Helix 3 are presented as an alignment, and linked to secondary structure diagrams highlighting
the homoplasious character evolution of base pair 54/121 (in red color, above alignment) and pair 55/120 (in blue color, below alignment).
Dashed arrows in violet were used to indicate the evolutionary direction of homoplasious changes. In the phylogram, branches/clades in which
homoplasious substitutions occurred were marked by red/blue circles. Homoplasious changes were abbreviated as before (Figures 2, 3).

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262

examples for these homoplasious changes that occurred
in pairs 54/121 and 55/120 in the basal part of Helix 3,
by showing alignments, folding diagrams, and evolutionary changes.
As a result, the homoplasy background underlying
CBC-type changes differed profoundly from homoplasy
frequences found for hCBCs in the Ulvales. Regarding
parallelisms, 16 of 38 total CBCs (42%) evolved as parallelisms, occurring in seven ITS2 base pairs (PAR 1-7),
whereas among all 51 hCBC, 38 (75%) represented parallelisms in 14 ITS2 pairs (hPAR 1-14; Additional file
4). The much higher homoplasy level of hCBCs was
also mirrored by the remaining homoplasy types.
Among the reversals, only two cases of the CBC-type
were found, which both occurred in the same highly
variable base pair in Helix 1 (8/11; REV 1-2, Additional
file 4). In contrast, we found six hCBCs that represented
reversals towards the ancestral character state (hREV 16; Additional file 4). We even found a twofold switch
between ancestral and derived character states via
hCBC-type reversals. As a synapomorphy in base pair
58/118, C-G changed to U-G in the genus Ulva, followed by a reversal in one major Ulva subclade (U-G ⇒
C-G = hREV 2) and a more recent second reversal in
U. californica AB280867 (C-G ⇒ U-G = hREV 3; Figure
3, Additional file 4). Notably, convergences were confined to the CBC category exclusively, and occurred
three times in two ITS2 base pairs (CONV 1-3; Figure
5 and Additional file 4).
To further investigate the relation between CBCs and
hCBCs, their frequencies of occurrence and frequencies
of homoplasies were mapped upon all universal base
pairs of ITS2 helices (Figure 6). Again, CBCs as well as
hCBCs were unequally distributed, i.e., non-correlated.
CBCs occurred frequently in Helix 1 and the basal part
of Helix 3. In these ‘variable’ regions, CBCs evolved
with a high homoplasy background including all recovered REV and CONV-type homoplasies, whereas in the
conserved parts of helices 2 and 3 very few homoplasious CBC-type changes occurred (only PAR; Figure 6).
Hemi-CBCs showed the opposite tendency - low frequency in Helix 1, but much higher frequencies of
occurrence in the remaining regions of ITS2 helices,
including the conserved regions (for details, see Figure
6). Except for Helix 1, the homoplasy background
underlying hCBCs was equally high throughout ITS2
base pairs (Figure 6).
Addressing individual base pairs in Figure 6 revealed
even more than a non-correlation between CBCs and
hCBCs - actually, co-occurrence of CBCs and hCBCs in
the same base pair was exceptional. In the Ulvales, only
seven base pairs displayed CBCs + hCBCs (pink),
whereas 27 pairs either evolved exclusively via CBCs
(12, blue) or exclusively via hCBCs (15, red in Figure 6).

Page 11 of 24

It may be assumed that CBCs of the C-G ⇔ U-A category may often have originated by two consecutive
hCBC-type substitutions, i.e. following the pathway C-G
⇔U-G ⇔ U-A. Therefore, we investigated the contribution of hCBCs to the observed CBCs in ITS2 helices of
the Ulvales, and surprisingly found no single case supporting the above-mentioned theoretical pathway. In
our case study, this result can neither be explained by
low frequency of the C-G ⇔ U-A category, nor of the
respective single hCBCs (C-G ⇔U-G, and U-G ⇔ U-A).
In Figure 7, we listed canonical (C-G, A-U) and ‘wobble’
(G-U) RNA base pairs, taking into account their orientation in the helix, and the frequency of all possible single
(hCBC) and double (CBC) substitutions that retain base
pairing in the Ulvales. Obviously, almost all above-mentioned changes occurred during ITS2 evolution of the
Ulvales, mostly with high overall frequencies, except for
5’-U-G-3’ ⇒ U-A (only one case), 5’-A-U-3’ ⇒ G-U (only
one case) and the reverse change (5’-G-U-3’ ⇒ A-U, no
case; Figure 7). Especially, the theoretical pathway 5’-UA-3’ ⇒ U-G ⇒ C-G appeared well supported by high frequencies of the individual hCBC categories, as well as
the frequently found direct CBC change (U-A ⇒ C-G).
However, most of the individual hCBCs referred to different ITS2 base pairs, and thus cannot be regarded as
intermediates in the evolution of a CBC. Only one base
pair in Helix 1 (position 8/11) showed all character
states required for the hypothetical hCBC pathway (see
above) in different taxa (U-A in Percursaria, U-G in e.g.
Ulvales sp. EF595508, and C-G in e.g. Gloeotilopsis paucicellularis; Figure 7). Since in all phylogenetic analyses
these taxa formed unrelated terminal branches within
three families, rather than forming a single phyletic series (Figure 2), they gained their character states in position 8/11 independently (via CBCs in two cases), and
therefore cannot be considered as an example of a CBC
that was gained by two consecutive hCBCs (see Figure
7). In summary, hCBCs evolved with a different homoplasy background, changed on different branches in the
phylogeny of the Ulvales, largely preferred different
ITS2 base pairs than those yielding CBCs, and did not
contribute to CBCs observed in ITS2 helices of the
Ulvales.

Discussion
In the present contribution we developed a suite of
methods to gain ‘close-up’ insights into ITS2 evolution
that may guide future studies of ITS diversification in
general. Therefore, we propose a general strategy for
studies of ITS evolution and phylogeny, starting with
the minimal requirements of the data set. ITS sequences
differ from most other molecular markers by their low
primary sequence and length conservation, and only the
common intra-molecular folding pattern of their RNA

two pairs of Helix 3 (55/120, 62/114). For Helix 1 and 3 base pairs, the total number of non-compensatory changes cannot be estimated
precisely due to their high substitution frequency.

Figure 7 Diagram showing evolutionary changes of base pairs, and their frequency/occurrence in ITS2 of the Ulvales. All possible
evolutionary changes between canonical (C-G, A-U) and ‘wobble’ (G-U) base pairs in RNA molecules, and their frequency of occurrence in the
entire ITS2 are illustrated. Base pairs are given in 5’-3’ orientation, referring to their placement in a helix. Arrows indicate the evolutionary
direction of substitutions. ITS2 changes, which were found in the Ulvales are indicated by bold arrows, accompanied by frequencies (encircled
numbers), whereas changes that were not existent in the analyzed taxa (frequency 0) are shown as thin arrows. CBCs are shown in blue, hCBCs
are in red. Obviously, hCBCs (especially the G-C ⇔ G-U type) occurred more frequently than CBCs. From the frequency of base pairs (number in
black boxes) and its percentage (number below black boxes) it is evident that there was a strong selection towards the GC/CG category. Note
that the given frequencies of base pairs are confined to extant taxa. The illustration of Helix 1 with pair 8/11 highlighted refers to the hypothesis
that a CBC of the U-A ⇔ C-G type may have evolved via two consecutive hCBC steps (see Results). Note, however, that the taxa shown are
unrelated, indicated by the simplified trees, which provide no support for this hypothesis.

transcripts, i.e. their secondary structure, allows comparative investigations. The correctly folded secondary
structure is fundamental not only for improving the
alignment [43-48], but also for building the alignment
itself (especially in case of variable markers such as
ITS2) as well as for identifying and detecting synapomorphies. In fact, the secondary structure is a prerequisite for all conclusions derived from the phylogenetic
analyses. Even with many available sequences, deciphering the ‘genuine’ secondary structure is a demanding
procedure, since the initial secondary structure folding
process of a single ITS2 sequence (e.g. via MFold) often
yields several alternative folds, and must be performed
with ITS2 sequences from as many closely/distantly
related taxa as is possible, to select the common folding
pattern, substantiated by occurrence of CBCs and
hCBCs [4,49]. To simplify this analysis, an alternative,
standardized procedure has been developed in which a
novel ITS2 sequence is automatically compared to >
110.000 sequences in the ITS2 Database III with known
secondary structures as a reference [46,50]. However,

for selected ITS2 sequences of the Ulvales, we obtained
clearly false folding patterns using the ITS2 Database
III. This is especially surprising since the authors
described their criteria for how to evaluate the quality of
secondary structure models, e.g. presence of four helices
with conserved helix length distribution, and a UGGU
motif near the 5’ site apex of Helix III [51]. However,
some of the artificial ‘reference’ ITS2 structures of the
Ulvales were in conflict with these criteria. Moreover,
even structures that comply with the standards may
often represent artifacts, as shown here for the Ulvales.
As a conclusion, the time-consuming manual approach
to identify the common ITS2 secondary structure for a
selected group of organisms as done here cannot be
abbreviated by a semi-automated procedure without significant loss of accuracy.
Fortunately, the ITS2 sequences of the order Ulvales
proved to be an almost ideal model for comparative
structural and phylogenetic studies. These sequences
were unusually well conserved in length, and contained
many, almost invariable sequence motifs, which allowed

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/262

high-quality alignments. Sequence conservation allowed
integration of more than 80 ITS2 sequences of the
Ulvales, which together represented five families, within
a single alignment - so far a unique case in the algae
where an ITS2 data set is usually confined to a single
family or genus. Furthermore, most ITS2 folds (using
MFold or RNAstructure) spontaneously favored the
same overall secondary structure, which corresponded
well with already known ITS2 features in other green
algae [4,6]. Hallmarks of this common secondary structure, as e.g. the start/end of the four helices, and the
spacers between helices, could easily be related to highly
conserved sequence motifs in the ITS2 alignment. Even
the most highly divergent ITS2 regions that were not
alignable by manual sequence comparison showed excellent secondary structure conservation that allowed an
unambiguous alignment across all Ulvales, except for
the apical parts of the four helices. In consequence, each
column in the alignable ITS2 regions represents a single
homologous character, which applies not only for the
paired positions but also for single-stranded spacer and
internal loop regions.
To achieve an Ulvales-wide system to identify and
number ITS2-nucleotides as a statement of positional
homology, all unambiguously aligned positions were
either classified as ‘universal’, i.e., present across all
Ulvales, or ‘non-universal’, i.e. existing in only some
Ulvales and thus being subject to insertion/deletion
events. Only the first group of nucleotides were given
‘universal’ position numbers (1-129), allowing a clear
nomenclature of e.g. ITS2 base pairs. These universal
positions covered the whole range between invariable,
moderately variable, and highly variable characters. To
specify the conservation status of individual positions,
usually a majority rule consensus is generated across the
taxa investigated, e.g. a character that is G in 80 out of
100 taxa is termed ‘80% conserved’ [4,16,52]. Here, we
instead used the absolute number of changes in the evolution of a given character as a more appropriate measure of its degree of conservation. As an example, both
positions of base pair 29/32 changed only once in the
evolution of the Ulvales in the common ancestor of a
taxon-rich family, the Ulvaceae. Thus, by simple majority rule consensus these characters would be regarded as
‘less than 55% conserved’, whereas our evolutionary
measure (one change) clearly reveals their high
conservation.
Following clarification of homology, universality,
nomenclature, and the degree of variation of ITS2 characters, summarized in consensus secondary structure
diagrams, all character state changes (substitutions) of
each position could be investigated in detail to deduce
the rules under which ITS2 evolved towards its current
diversity. As a method, the previously developed

Page 14 of 24

synapomorphy search procedure [52] automatically generated a complete inventory of all substitutions of ITS2
positions within the Ulvales, and in addition, precisely
identified the branches in the phylogenetic tree where
these substitutions occurred. Since the most interesting
questions regarding ITS2 evolution are related to the
paired positions in the double-stranded helices, the
resulting list of single-character evolutionary changes
was analyzed manually to trace the evolution of all
known base pairs for (1) co-evolution by maintaining
base pairing via CBC, and (2) single-sided changes
retaining pairing via hCBC. The result of this screen is
an overview of all recent CBC- or hCBC-type changes
underlying terminal branches, as well as changes that
characterize basal divergences in the phylogeny of the
Ulvales. Especially the latter point marks a difference to
other studies where ITS sequences of extant taxa are
compared without consideration of evolutionary changes
that led to these sequences [53-55].
Are CBC frequencies proportional to the overall
sequence divergence? To analyze this question, previous
investigators [56,57] plotted the ITS-distances between
pairs of extant taxa against the number of CBCs, and
found similar relations: CBC-frequencies (maximally 8-9
CBCs) are increasing from low to medium distance
values, while for highly diverging pairs of sequences the
number of CBCs is relatively small, indicating saturation. Surprisingly, this distribution was analyzed by linear regression methods and then characterized as ‘linear
proportional relation’ [56]. In the present study, synapomorphy searches revealed all CBCs, and precisely identified the branches on which they occurred. These data
allowed a phylogenetic rather than a statistical approach,
i.e. by plotting CBC frequencies versus the length (determined for paired sites only) of the respective internal or
terminal branch. For the Ulvales, we also found a
saturation-type relation between CBC frequencies and
branch lengths, with the CBC vs. branch length ratio
(CBC_R) being negatively correlated with branch
lengths. In their study on Myrtaceae [57], the authors
assumed ‘unobserved’ substitutions for the distant
sequence comparisons, i.e. reversals, as one reason for
the low number of observed CBCs, and also noticed
that CBCs actually occur at relatively few sites in ITS
molecules. We fully confirmed the latter phenomenon out of 45 ‘universal’ base pairs in ITS2, only 19 pairs
underwent CBC-type changes throughout the entire
order Ulvales. In other words, the limited number of
sites that can per se evolve via CBCs may be the major
reason for the unexpectedly low number of CBCs in
divergent branches or taxa. As an example, the long
branch of Kornmannia (21 substitutions), which could
theoretically involve up to 10 CBCs, actually shows
CBCs at only four sites. As an alternative explanation

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/262

for the observed saturation in divergent branches or
taxa, a high rate of ‘unobserved’ CBCs may be assumed,
i.e. CBCs, which were immediately reverted towards the
ancestral state. However, the synapomorphy analysis/
mapping approach performed here allowed precise
quantification of CBC-type reversals throughout the
Ulvales: among 38 CBCs, we found only two reversals.
Therefore, it appears very unlikely that high rates of
‘unobserved’ CBCs contributed to CBC saturation in the
Ulvales. All these data suggest that CBCs represent a
complex evolutionary process, which at higher divergence levels is constrained by available sites in ITS2
rather than depending simply on overall sequence
divergence.
It is usually assumed that a CBC cannot evolve by two
simultaneous substitutions, given the low evolutionary
rates of most paired positions in ITS2 [57,58]. Instead, a
CBC may have evolved by two single-sided changes
within a short time, and usually, the ‘wobble’ pair (G-U)
is assumed as intermediate, suggesting the series A-U ⇔
G-U ⇔ G-C that represents two consecutive hCBCs
[58-64]. As an alternative scenario, the intermediate
stage may comprise mismatching nucleotides (e.g. A-U
⇔ AxC ⇔ G-C). Although the ‘2x hCBC ® CBC’ scenario seems attractive, it only applies for one case of
CBC (A-U ⇔ G-C), and not to any of the remaining
observed CBC categories (e.g. A-U ⇔ U-A/U-G/C-G). A
popular approach to address this question is to determine frequencies of the respective changes. In the
Ulvales, hCBCs of the A-U ⇔ G-U type as well as the
G-U ⇔ G-C type were observed at high numbers, suggesting that in fact CBCs may have evolved via two subsequent hCBC-steps. However, such a summarizing view
of overall substitution rates, which is often applied as
the only source of evidence [e.g. [57]], can be misleading
for two reasons. First, these hCBCs may have occurred
at different positions (see below), and second, even if
these hCBCs referred to the same ITS base pair, they
may have evolved independently in organisms that do
not form a phyletic series. In fact, our synapomorphy
analysis readily revealed that almost all pairs of hCBCs,
which could theoretically form a 2-step CBC, occurred
in different ITS2 positions, and already this spatial
separation within the ITS2 molecule makes any causal
relation between CBCs and hCBCs highly unlikely. Only
in a single case, both hCBCs required for a full 2-step
CBC mapped upon the same ITS2 position in Helix 1
(Figure 7). However, the respective taxa were unrelated
to each other, highlighting that both hCBCs emerged as
independent evolutionary events that did not converge
towards a CBC. The simple formula 2x hCBC ® CBC
can at best be regarded as an exceptional scenario,
which, however, could not be demonstrated in the
Ulvales. In contrast to the misleading conclusions

Page 15 of 24

derived from statistical methods, the specific reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of ITS2 base pairs via
synapomorphy analysis resolved this question.
Are CBCs and hCBCs equally distributed over ITS2
positions, or can one recognize distinct positional preferences? In fact, only seven pairs in the entire ITS2
molecule displayed both CBCs and hCBCs, whereas all
remaining pairs appeared ‘specialized’ to either category
of change. Already this simple observation is difficult to
reconcile with the notion that the majority of CBCs followed a ‘2x hCBC ® CBC’ pathway.
Taken together, a hCBC appears to be a stable substitution, suggesting that the ‘wobble’ pair (G-U) is not at
a disadvantage compared with ‘canonical’ base pairs
[63,65,66]. In other words, when a canonical pair underwent a hCBC that lead to G-U, there was no selection
pressure in favor of an immediate second hCBC restoring a canonical pair. In the Ulvales, we found similar
preferences for both directions of hCBCs: 23 hCBCs of
the canonical ® ‘wobble’ pair type, and a comparable
number (28) of the ‘wobble’ ® canonical pair type.
Comparisons of models of RNA sequence evolution,
using ITS data from angiosperms, also suggested
absence of strong selection against non-canonical base
pairs [57,64]. Interestingly, the evolutionary behavior of
the ‘wobble’ pair is strongly biased in the Ulvales: we
observed only a single hCBC of the G-U/U-G ® A-U/
U-A type, versus 27 hCBC in the G-U/U-G ® G-C/C-G
categories. A similar bias has been reported for some
angiosperm families [57,64]. It seems attractive to
explain such a bias in substitution rates by unequal frequencies of G-C/C-G (31/32%) and A-U/U-A pairs (8/
7% in the Ulvales), as e.g. done by [57]. However, this
conclusion is illegitimate (see below), and we favor
another explanation, regarding functional constraints
underlying a ‘wobble’ pair (for specific features of G-U,
see [e.g. [66-69]]. The thermodynamic stability of A-U/
U-A is more or less comparable to G-U/U-G, whereas
the G-C/C-G pairs contribute much more to the stability of a helix [58,66,70,71]. Thus, G-U/U-G ® A-U/UA changes may be comparatively neutral compared to
G-U/U-G ® G-C/C-G changes, which may be under
positive selection in the Ulvales. As a suggestion,
exchanges towards G-C/C-G pairs could improve ITS2
folding stability [72] when an organism is undergoing
specialization to habitats with higher temperatures, and
perhaps, the fast-evolving hCBC pathways (G-U/U-G ®
G-C/C-G) allow rapid ecological adaptation processes,
in contrast to two-step CBC-type changes.
How did double-sided CBCs in ITS2 actually evolve?
We favor a 2-step scenario that involves a non-pair as a
short-living intermediate, i.e. N-N ® N×N ® N-N. In
contrast to the ‘2x hCBC ® CBC’ scenario, this pathway
holds for all CBC categories (22; blue arrows in Figure

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/262

7). At least for base pairs under functional constraints, it
should be assumed that any spontaneous single-sided
substitution leading to a non-pair is disadvantageous,
with impaired ITS2 folding and excision characteristics
[73]. This event will usually lead to strongly reduced fitness or even extinction of the mutant genotype [65,72].
Alternatively, mutants may escape extinction by intragenomic rRNA homogenization, which reverts the mutation and thus restores ITS2 functions and fitness [74].
With respect to extant organisms, extinction of mutants
as well as rRNA homogenization processes cannot be
readily investigated. However, we may be able to recognize selection against non-pairs in the double-stranded
backbone of ITS2 helices, by comparison of non-compensating changes (N-N ⇔ N×N) versus overall frequencies of CBCs and hCBCs [75]. In fact, disruption of pairs
(N-N ® N×N) and restoration of pairing (N×N ® N-N)
both occurred at much lower frequencies (ca. 19 and 10
cases, respectively, within the Ulvales; uncertain cases in
highly variable pairs were ignored) than CBCs and
hCBCs (38 and 51 cases, respectively). Several of the
conserved pairs even evolved exclusively by compensating changes, without any non-pairs. In the apical part of
Helix 3, however, we found a few ‘exceptional’ positions
that were almost universally paired, but evolved towards
non-pairs within suprageneric clades (e.g. pair 79/101)
or even whole families (pairs 68/109 - Ulvaceae, 75/105
- Kornmanniaceae and Bolbocoleonaceae, 84/97- Ulvaceae). How is it possible that the mismatch status
remained stable over long periods of time? All these
‘exceptional’ non-pairs are surrounded by several conserved pairs, which, we suspect, in combination lead to
strong thermodynamic stability of this helix [72]. Therefore, a few isolated non-pairs in Helix 3 do apparently
not reduce fitness and viability of the respective organisms, since e.g. the three families listed above belong to
the ecologically most successful green algae in marine
and coastal environments [42,76].
Our data regarding Helix 2 provide the strongest evidence of selection against mismatch pairs - among 10
universal base pairs, nine were invariably doublestranded in all Ulvales and evolved exclusively by CBCs
and hCBCs. Only the most variable pair 30/31 located
just before the expansion region showed a few cases of
mismatch. It should be noted that the two- dimensional
shape of Helix 2 is regarded as a highly conserved ‘hallmark’ of the ITS2 core structure, i.e. a basal stem comprising about five base pairs, followed by a short
internal loop (bulge) consisting of 1-2 pyrimidine-pyrimidine mismatches, and an apical stem+loop region
[4,43]. Experimental changes of this secondary structure
by mutagenesis leads to failure in ITS2 excision at the
transcript level, and especially, introduction of even one
additional non-pair in the stem region is sufficient to

Page 16 of 24

prevent efficient pre-RNA processing [9]. This corresponds well with our investigations in the Ulvales - such
a change is perhaps not viable. However, only the basal
pair of Helix 2 is invariant in the order, whereas all
remaining pairs evolved at moderate rates, and - except
pair 30/31 - lacked changes that interrupt base pairing.
Although it might initially seem paradoxical, we assume
that especially in these cases CBCs may have originated
via non-paired intermediate steps, which in most cases
were rapidly eliminated by natural selection (extinction).
As a rare event, a lethal mismatch pair regained the
essential base pairing by a second substitution, which
must have occurred within a short time frame. As an
example, the C-G ® G-C CBC in pair 23/38 in Helix 2
may have evolved via short-living CxC or GxG mismatch state.
To substantiate our hypothesis that in ITS2 CBCs and
hCBCs follow different evolutionary rules, we further
investigated their homoplasious changes, i.e. parallelisms, convergences, and reversals. Fortunately, the problem to distinguish these three types of homoplasy was
readily achieved by our approach of direct mapping of
all substitutions in ITS2 base pairs, in contrast to indirect statistical methods, e.g. calculating a homoplasy
index [15,18]. As a first insight, parallelisms seem to be
the most frequent case of homoplasy in ITS2, followed
by reversals and convergences. Interestingly, parallelisms
and especially reversals occurred much more frequently
in the hCBC category. Considering the only slightly
higher number of hCBCs (51) versus CBCs (38), we
observed twice the number of parallelisms (38 versus
16), and even a threefold increase of hCBC-type reversals (6 versus 2; Figure 6). The remaining homoplasy
category, i.e. convergence, shows the opposite tendency:
we found five cases of CBC-type convergences, but no
such event among hCBCs (Figure 6). This appears surprising, since there are only two possible pathways for
hCBC-type convergences (A-U ® G-U ¬ G-C, and UA ® U-G ¬ C-G), and most of these individual substitutions happened rather frequently (Figure 7). However,
all these individual substitutions referred to different
base pairs in ITS2, and therefore did not contribute to
any hCBC-type convergence. What is the reason for the
higher rate of CBC-type convergences? The explanation
may be the higher number of possible pathways, since
every base pair can directly originate via CBCs from
four other pairs (Figure 7). As an example, A-U can theoretically evolve from G-C, U-A, U-G, or C-G. Notably,
all these changes were found in the Ulvales (Figure 7)
and in some cases referred to the same ITS2 position,
thus leading to the observed CBC-type convergences
(Additional file 4).
Since CBCs and hCBCs showed clear positional preferences (see above), it is not surprising that their

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/262

homoplasies are also spatially separated in the ITS2
molecule. Among 17 homoplasious positions, only two
showed CBC- as well as hCBC homoplasies (Figure 6).
Interestingly, the most conservative regions of the ITS2,
i.e. the conserved parts of Helix 2 and 3, were both
characterized by very low frequencies of CBC-type
homoplasies accompanied by unusually high rates of
hCBC homoplasies (Figure 6). This phenomenon might
explain why several authors have restricted their conclusions to (1) these conserved parts of ITS2, and (2) to
CBCs. Obviously, most CBCs in the conserved regions
are non-homoplasious changes, and thus offer informative molecular signatures, which unambiguously characterize taxa and clades (including CBC clades). In
contrast, hCBC are usually considered as taxonomically
meaningless (genotypes differing by one hCBC may even
be able to mate), and this is mirrored by e.g. elevated
homoplasy levels even in the conserved regions, and
very high substitution rates.
Can we explain the observed substitution rates of
CBCs and hCBCs in the ITS2 with empirical frequencies
of the respective base pairs? It might appear logical to
assume that a high frequency of a given base pair should
correlate with a high rate of substitutions leading to that
base pair. Within the Ulvales, G-C and C-G are the
most frequently occurring base pairs in ITS2 (31 and
32%, respectively), whereas the four remaining pairs
were comparatively rare, each counting for only 7-8%
(Figure 7). Assuming a frequency-substitution rate correlation, we should observe the highest substitution
rates for ‘frequent ⇔ frequent’ CBCs (G-C ⇔ C-G),
lower rates for ‘frequent ⇔ rare’ interchanges (e.g. C-G
⇔ U-A), and the lowest substitution rates for the category ‘rare ⇔ rare’ (e.g. U-A ⇔ A-U). Our data clearly
reject such a correlation, and rather show almost complete independence between frequency and substitution
rates. For example, a direct ‘rare ® rare’ CBC (U-A ®
A-U) shows the same rate as C-G ® G-C from the ‘frequent ® frequent’ category. Clearly, the highest
observed substitution rates were found among the ‘frequent ⇔ rare’ interchanges, and this holds for the highest CBC-rates (C-G ⇔ U-A) as well as the highest
hCBC rates (C-G ® U-G, G-U ® G-C).
How can we explain that substitution rates are
obviously independent of frequencies? First, several base
pairs in ITS2 are essential for proper secondary structure folding, and thus are under strict functional constraints. Not surprisingly, several strong G-C and C-G
pairs contribute to ITS2 stability, and thus are conserved or even invariant, as shown in the ITS2 secondary structure diagram (Figure 1), explaining the
unexpectedly low number of observed changes. However, there is also a general reason why frequencies cannot be correlated with substitution rates - observed

Page 17 of 24

frequencies apply to sequences of extant taxa only,
whereas substitution rates refer to ancient as well as
recent evolutionary changes. This means, that a single
early occurring change, mapped upon a deep branch in
the phylogenetic tree, will affect several descendent taxa
and will thus considerably influence the base pair frequency distribution among recent taxa. In contrast, a
recent substitution, mapped upon shallow or terminal
branches, changes the base pair frequency of only few
or even single taxa, with almost no effect on the
observed overall frequencies.
As an example, in the Ulvales and also in angiosperms
[57], the ‘wobble’ pairs G-U/U-G display much higher
substitution rates with G-C/C-G than with A-U/U-A
(see above). [57] argued that this bias in substitution
rates is simply the result of the several fold higher frequencies of G-C/C-G versus A-U/U-A. For the abovementioned reasons, this argument is inconclusive, and
we instead propose functional constraints under adaptive processes as a possible explanation for the observed
bias (see above).
What is the significance of ITS2 for taxonomy and
species definition in the Ulvales? So far, the ITS2 molecule has only rarely been used as marker for phylogenetic analyses in the Ulvales, except in studies of single
genera (Acrochaete - [77]; Acrosiphonia - [78]; Blidingia
- [e.g. [79,80]]; Collinsiella/Monostroma - [81]; Gloeotilopsis - [82]; Ulva - [e.g. [23,83-88]]; Ulvaria - [89];
Urospora - [90]. As a first surprise, ITS2 proved to be
well alignable across the entire order due to its high
structural conservation and low sequence length divergence, and thus allowed reconstructions of the phylogenetic branching pattern even above the level of the
sampled families. To test whether the ITS2 tree is accurate, it was compared with a phylogeny derived from
18S rDNA data that covered a similar, albeit not identical, set of taxa, and this comparison revealed only a few
conflicting branching patterns (see Results). Thus, ITS2
is an exceptionally informative phylogenetic marker in
the Ulvales (see also [91]), especially with respect to the
relatively low number of alignable positions, and in
future should be analyzed in combination with congruent data sets of other genes.
However, the most spectacular evolutionary aspect
regarding ITS2 concerns its potential to predict sexual
compatibility (intercrossing) among closely related
organisms, thereby defining the level of ‘biological’ species. One of the most recent proposals is that any CBC
in the ITS2 is informative, and when two ITS2
sequences differ by at least one CBC, they likely represent two species [56]. Although the predicted ITS2 secondary structure in the Ulvales shows a high degree of
conservation, we found it very difficult, sometimes
impossible or at least subjective to align the highly

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/262

variable regions (red circles surrounded by green line in
Figure 1). Applying the proposal by Müller et al. [56],
variations in ITS2 lengths (as is observed in many taxa)
would automatically result in the recognition of more
species, an untenable situation. We therefore favour the
more conservative proposal by Coleman [25,26] which
refers to the presence of at least one CBC between two
organisms in the conserved regions of ITS2 predicting a
failure to sexually cross, i.e. these organisms represent
two different species. Ideally, CBCs should have evolved
at (1) approximately the same rate in sister lineages, and
(2) at approximately the same or slightly slower rates
than genes that control gamete compatibility. As a consequence, the ‘first’ CBCs should appear at about the
same time, associated with shallow divergences in the
phylogenetic tree, and should define several parallel
clades (CBC clades sensu Coleman) that might correspond to ‘biological’ species. In this scenario, those
branches where ‘first’ CBCs occurred could be connected by a single vertical line as e.g. shown in a cartoon phylogenetic tree [26]. In the Ulvales, we found
that none of these ‘ideal’ assumptions is fulfilled.
Clearly, many ‘first’ CBCs in the Ulvales are not associated with shallow branches at the level of ‘biological’
species, but instead mapped upon deep divergences
representing the levels of genera, families, or even
higher taxonomic levels. Only a few taxonomic species
were equivalent to single CBC clades, e.g. Collinsiella
tuberculata. Most CBC clades (sensu Coleman) within
the Ulvales are therefore based on deep-branching
CBCs, and each of them contains up to about 30 taxonomic species in several genera. Analysis concentrating
on the ITS2 region of the Volvocaeae revealed a
remarkable correspondence between CBC clade, Z clade
and species (e.g. Gonium pectorale), [25]. Is it, therefore,
possible that each of these comprehensive CBC clades
in fact represents only a single species, containing a
diverging population of several morphotypes that are
still able to cross? Unfortunately, the crossing capability
of most species of the Ulvales analyzed here has not
been investigated, but the limited evidence available may
already address this question. Species of Ulva are well
separated from each other by gametic mating barriers,
as e.g. studied in detail for the same strains of U. ohnoi,
U. reticulata and U. fasciata that were investigated here
[92]. These three species form one of many subclades
within the large CBC clade sensu Coleman that includes
the entire genus Ulva as well as most other members of
the family Ulvaceae. Further observations regarding
morphological organization [e.g. [76,93-100]], ultrastructural characterization - e.g. presence/absence of scales
on zoospores/aplanospores/gametes [82,101-113] and
type of habitat e.g. [42,76] in other Ulvales lead to the
same conclusion. For example, the macroalgae

Page 18 of 24

Protomonostroma (foliose, marine) and Capsosiphon
(tubular thallus, marine), as well as the branched filamentous Chamaetrichon (square-shaped scales on zoospores, freshwater) and several unbranched filamentous
microalgae (e.g. Urospora, no scales, marine) are not differentiated by a CBC in the highly conserved regions of
helices 2 and 3.
In summary, genes controlling gamete compatibility as
well as genes involved in structural differentiation
apparently evolved much faster than most CBCs in the
ITS2 of the Ulvales.
The scattered, non-synchronous distribution of CBCs
has another, unexpected consequence. Several major
CBC clades, which are based on ancient CBC events,
contain nested CBC clades that originated by more
recent CBCs. Thus, only the latter category is monophyletic, whereas the major CBC clades, deeply rooted in
the phylogenetic tree, usually form paraphyletic groupings, here termed CBC grades. In the Ulvales, only a few
taxa fall into one of the four ‘genuine’ CBC clades,
whereas most taxa are distributed among five comprehensive CBC grades. In other words, the absence of a
CBC in the highly conserved regions of helices 2 and 3
does not imply the presence of a monophyletic group
nor is indicative of a close relationship (i.e. at the species level) among the taxa that share this trait. It
remains to be determined whether non-synchronization
of ‘first’ CBCs and thus predominance of CBC grades is
a special feature of the Ulvales, or is widely distributed
among eukaryotes.
Mapping all CBCs on the phylogenetic tree is the only
method to distinguish between ‘genuine’ CBC clades
and CBC grades. Coleman [29] already mapped CBCs in
helices 2 and 3 of ITS2 upon the phylogeny of Pandorina isolates, similar to our approach, and to our knowledge this is still the only published reference. Although
most members of Pandorina analyzed formed CBC
(monophyletic) clades, the tree revealed the presence of
CBC grades that contained isolates which are less closely related to each other than isolates that are excluded
from the grade - because of the presence of a specific
CBC (e.g. PmU879 + PmNoz3923/PmKiev). Unfortunately, ITS2 comparisons including CBC-concepts are
commonly performed in a more simple way, i.e. by pairwise
comparison
between
two
taxa
[e.g.
[22,34,53,54,114-118]]. This ‘phenetic’ approach usually
does not consider the phylogenetic history of CBC-type
substitutions (plesiomorphic vs. apomorphic), and for
different reasons it can lead to wrong conclusions (see
Results). In the case of distantly related taxa, pairwise
comparison is always impaired by the possibility of
homoplasious changes. All homoplasy types (parallelisms, convergences, reversals) can lead to similar or
even identical sequences in unrelated organisms. Even

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/262

in the case of sister taxa, pairwise comparison of ITS2
CBCs is illegitimate unless the character state in their
last common ancestor is taken into consideration. The
discrepancy between a phenetic vs. a phylogenetic
approach was highlighted here for two sister species of
Acrochaete (Figure 4). In one base pair located in the
conserved part of Helix 2, A. viridis and A. heteroclada
seem to differ by a single hCBC only (A-U vs. G-U),
resulting from pairwise comparison. However, the
ancestral state of this pair in their last common ancestor
was G-C, and thus, A. viridis evolved via CBC (G-C ®
A-U), whereas its sister species differs from the ancestor
by one hCBC (G-C ® G-U). Phenetic pairwise comparison would therefore predict possible mating ability,
whereas the phylogenetic analysis resolves A. viridis as a
separate species, likely unable to mate with its sister
species.
Our case study in the Ulvales demonstrated several
discrepancies in the generally accepted assumptions
underlying ITS2 evolution and taxonomic concepts
based on ITS2 characters. We hope that this study will
stimulate others to investigate ITS2 data in greater
detail by directly tracing the evolutionary history of individual characters instead of relying on indirect statistical
methods only. As soon as such ‘close-up’ views on ITS2
evolution are available for other groups of eukaryotes, it
may be possible to re-evaluate the significance of ITS2
sequence variations for evolution, taxonomy, and speciation processes in eukaryotes in general.

Conclusions
The present study of the green algal order Ulvales
revealed novel and surprising insights into processes
underlying ITS2 evolution and the taxonomic significance of ITS2 characters. 1) Many CBC clades sensu
Coleman are paraphyletic. The CBC clades sensu
Coleman are not stable over time, since later evolving
CBCs result in new CBC clades which are nested in
their ‘parent CBC clades’ thus changing the status of the
former towards paraphyletic grades, here germed CBC
grades. 2) The occurrence of CBCs is not restricted to
terminal branches and CBC clades are therefore not
indicative of recent speciation events. Instead, mapping of CBCs upon the ITS2 phylogeny reveals spreading of CBCs over both deep and terminal divergences.
Most terminal, species-level branches are not associated
with CBC events, demonstrating that the genes, which
control speciation processes via gametic compatibility
evolved considerably faster than the conserved parts of
helices 2 and 3 of ITS2. 3) Phenetics can be misleading. Phenetic comparison of ITS2 base pairs between
two taxa can lead to false conclusions when the phylogeny of the organisms is ignored. Therefore, it is essential to map CBCs on the phylogenetic tree in order to

Page 19 of 24

determine the evolutionary history of the respective base
pair, including homoplasious changes. 4) Hemi-CBCs
do not contribute to CBCs. Throughout the ITS2 phylogeny of the Ulvales, not a single base pair revealed a
CBC that represented a two-fold hCBC event of the
pathway U-A ⇔ U-G ⇔ C-G, although the individual
hCBC events occurred with high frequencies. As a general conclusion, evolutionary divergences characterized
by CBCs are mostly not characterized by hCBC, and
vice versa. Similarly, ITS2 positions showing CBC-type
changes are usually different from base pairs evolving
via hCBCs. We conclude that CBCs likely evolved via
short-lived non-paired intermediates.
Although the conclusions of this study were derived
from ITS2 data of only a single group of algae (Ulvales,
Chlorophyta, Viridiplantae), they may well apply to
other eukaryotes. Concepts of species delimitation based
on presence/absence of CBCs in ITS2 should be applied
only after careful analysis of ITS2 evolution and
phylogeny.

Methods
Cultures, DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

The investigated strains (taxa in bold in Additional file 7
and Figure 2) were obtained from Sammlung von
Algenkulturen, University of Göttingen, Germany (SAG)
[119], the Culture Collection of Algae at The University
of Texas at Austin (UTEX) [120], the Coimbra Collection of Algae (ACOI) [121], and the Provasoli-Guillard
National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplancton
(CCMP) [122]. Two strains from the Culture Collection
of Soil Algae at the Institute of Soil Biology, Czech
Republic (ISBAL), Gloeotilopsis paucicellularis ISBAL
177 and Gloeotilopsis sp. ISBAL 1052, have been deposited in the Culture Collection of Algae at the University
of Cologne, Germany (CCAC; M3283, M3284) [123]
after purification by isolation of zoospores. Cultures
were grown in Waris-H medium [124] under the following conditions: temperature: 16°C, photoperiod: 14
hours L/10 hours D, and light intensity: 10 - 30 μmol
m-2 s-1 (measured by Light Meter Li-Cor, LI-250A)
Total genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy
Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and subsequently used for
gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
and direct sequencing [52], for primers, see Additional
file 8. Twelve newly determined ITS2 sequences are
available under accession numbers from HE575887 to
HE575898 (Additional file 7, taxa in bold).
Taxon sampling and alignments of ITS2 and 18S rDNA

GenBank database searches and Blast queries revealed
about 150 published ITS2 sequences belonging to the
order Ulvales. Sequences containing obvious data errors
as well as redundant and partial ITS2 sequences were

Caisová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/262

excluded. Finally, 74 published and 12 newly determined
ITS2 sequences were subjected to manual alignment,
using SeaView 4.1 [125]. The alignment was guided by
secondary structures of the ITS2 RNA transcripts (see
below).
For the 18S rDNA analyses, 74 sequences were
selected as guided by the taxon sampling in the ITS2
alignment. 18S rDNA sequences were aligned manually
according to the conserved rRNA secondary structure.
Consensus ITS2 secondary structure diagram, variability
map and nucleotide numbering system

ITS2 secondary structures of all investigated taxa were
predicted by comparing RNA folding patterns of complete ITS2 sequences and, if necessary, of single helices,
using MFold and RNAstructure. Both methods usually
resulted in several alternative foldings for the same ITS2
sequence. The ‘true’ folding pattern corresponded to the
secondary structure model of [4], and was well supported by CBCs and hCBCs, revealed by comparisons
among related taxa. To obtain a consensus secondary
structure of ITS2 including a variability map, a majority
rule consensus sequence at 70% threshold level was calculated via SeaView 4.1 from the ITS2 alignment, and
manually displayed as an ITS2 secondary structure diagram (Adobe Illustrator). For each position, the variability category, i.e. the total number of evolutionary
changes, was determined by loading sequence data and
a ML treefile with PAUP 4.0b10 [126], selecting the Parsimony optimality criterion, and using the ‘Describe
trees’ command with the ‘list of changes’ option. In
addition, expansion segments with length variations
across taxa as well as ‘non-universal’ insertions characterizing only single taxa were specially marked (see Figure 1). 129 ‘universal’ positions, which were
unambiguously aligned and present in all Ulvales, were
used to introduce an ITS2 nucleotide numbering system
(see Results).
Phylogenetic analyses

Four different methods were performed for phylogenetic
analyses: Maximum Likelihood (ML), Distance (Neighbor Joining, NJ), Maximum Parsimony (MP), and Bayesian analyses (MrBayes). The appropriate model of
sequence evolution including model parameters was calculated using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) with
ModelTest 3.7 [127], and resulted in GTR+G as the best
model for the ITS2 data set and in GTR+I+G for 18S
rRNA analyses. These models were used for all analyses
in this study except MP. Analyses were calculated by
PAUP 4.0b10 (ML, NJ, MP) and MrBayes 3.1.2 [128].
Tree topologies were gained by heuristic searches under
the ML criterion, starting with trees obtained by
sequential taxon addition or by NJ. 100 ML bootstrap

Page 20 of 24

replicates were constrained towards 3000 rearrangements per replicate. MP and NJ bootstrap analyses
(1000 replicates) were not constrained.
For Bayesian analyses, two MCMC chains with
2000000 generations were used and 65000 generations
were discarded as ‘burn in’ after estimation with Tracer
1.4 [129]; convergence indicated by a standard deviation
between the two MCMC chains below 0.05. Bootstrap
values below 50% as well as Bayesian posterior probability below 0.95 were omitted. To determine simple
branch lengths (i.e. number of evolutionary steps), we
opened ITS2 data and the ML tree of the ITS2 analysis
in PAUP, selected the MP criterion (character state optimization: ‘DELTRAN’), and displayed the tree by using
the ‘show branch lengths’ option. By excluding all nonpaired positions from the alignment, branch lengths
referred to double-stranded positions only.
Mapping of synapomorphic CBCs, hCBCs, and noncompensating substitutions

In order to trace all ITS2 substitutions in the phylogeny
of the Ulvales, we applied a modified synapomorphy
search. The ITS2 alignment was reduced towards paired
(double-stranded) positions, opened with PAUP together
with the ML tree file, and screened for synapomorphies
as described previously [52,130]. In the resulting ‘list of
synapomorphies’, every character was investigated separately using the ‘show reconstructions’ option, irrespective of whether it evolved in a homoplasious (e.g. with
convergent changes) or non-homoplasious manner. For
every change in a given position, the paired position
(according to the consensus structure diagram, Figure 1)
was screened for presence/absence of a compensatory
base change.

introduced in Figure 1 (e.g. as 72/108). Information on hCBCs was
indicated by [brackets]. 15 H2+3_CBCs (CBCs discovered in the
conserved regions of ITS2) were indicated in gray boxes. Unique
synapomorphies were flagged as NHS (Non-Homoplasious
Synapomorphy), whereas Homoplasious Synapomorphies are designated
as HS. Only Homoplasious Synapomorphies were further characterized as
(1) parallel CBCs (PAR), (2) parallel hCBCs (hPAR), (3) convergent CBCs
(CONV), (4) reversals of CBCs (REV), or (5) reversals of hCBCs (hREV).

CBCs (blue) and hCBCs (red) were classified into non-homoplasious (NHS)

convergences, and reversals; or further explanation, see Additional file 3).
For every pair, the likely plesiomorphic character status within the Ulvales
is given. Moreover, non-compensating base changes are listed here, that
involve a pair ⇔ unpair conversion. The conserved regions of helices 2

model of ITS2 in the Ulvales. Comments refer either to their nonhomoplasious (NHS) or to homoplasious (HS) status. For further
information on universal/non-universal positions see Figure 1.

diagrammed against branch lengths in the ITS2 phylogeny. A) The
number of CBCs appeared weakly correlated with the length of branches
where the CBCs occurred (brown squares with numbers indicating the
frequency of CBCs versus evolutionary steps). For branches with > 0
CBCs, the CBC vs. branch length ratio was calculated (CBC_R = 2xCBC/
evolutionary steps, blue squares), showing negative correlation with
branch lengths. B) Hemi-CBCs were not strictly correlated with branch
lengths (brown squares with numbers showing the frequency of hCBCs
versus evolutionary steps)), but the hCBC vs. branch length ratio (hCBC_R
= hCBC/evolutionary steps, blue squares) again clearly showed negative
correlation. For both diagrams, branch length calculation was restricted
to double-stranded ITS2 positions. Note that the gray colour in the
diagrams indicates the area in which no CBCs (A) and hCBCs (B) occur.
