A revision of brain composition in Onychophora
(velvet worms) suggests that the tritocerebrum
evolved in arthropods

Abstract
Background: The composition of the arthropod head is one of the most contentious issues in animal evolution. In
particular, controversy surrounds the homology and innervation of segmental cephalic appendages by the brain.
Onychophora (velvet worms) play a crucial role in understanding the evolution of the arthropod brain, because
they are close relatives of arthropods and have apparently changed little since the Early Cambrian. However, the
segmental origins of their brain neuropils and the number of cephalic appendages innervated by the brain - key
issues in clarifying brain composition in the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda - remain
unclear.
Results: Using immunolabelling and neuronal tracing techniques in the developing and adult onychophoran brain,
we found that the major brain neuropils arise from only the anterior-most body segment, and that two pairs of
segmental appendages are innervated by the brain. The region of the central nervous system corresponding to the
arthropod tritocerebrum is not differentiated as part of the onychophoran brain but instead belongs to the ventral
nerve cords.
Conclusions: Our results contradict the assumptions of a tripartite (three-segmented) brain in Onychophora and
instead confirm the hypothesis of bipartite (two-segmented) brain composition. They suggest that the last
common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda possessed a brain consisting of protocerebrum and
deutocerebrum whereas the tritocerebrum evolved in arthropods.

Background
The head of arthropods is a specialised anterior body
region, which is distinguished by fused segments and
several pairs of modified appendages [1,2]. These appendages serve for swimming, feeding, defence, or sensory
perception, and their movements are coordinated by a
complex brain situated within the head. Despite over a
century of intense research in this area, the ancestral
composition of the arthropod head remains obscure and
is one of the most controversial topics in zoology [2-8].
Fossils have contributed much to our knowledge [1,4,8],
but their limited preservation constrains definitive conclusions about the degree of cephalisation in the last

common ancestor of Panarthropoda (Onychophora +
Tardigrada + Arthropoda).
The extant Onychophora are a key group when considering this issue, since they are close relatives of arthropods
and resemble Cambrian lobopodians [9-13], while their
internal anatomy and embryology are accessible for
detailed examination. As in various lobopodians, the onychophoran “head” is not clearly delineated from the trunk,
but shows three pairs of modified appendages: sensory
antennae, jaws situated within the mouth cavity, and slime
papillae, which are used for defence and capturing prey
organisms (Figure 1A). These modified appendages have
been assigned to each body segment by studying embryogenesis, which revealed that the antennae belong to the
first (ocular) body segment, the jaws to the second, and
the slime papillae to the third segment [14-20]. Most
importantly, these studies have provided no evidence of
any additional vestigial cephalic segments [21-24] in

Onychophora. This is supported by the expression data of
segment polarity genes in onychophoran embryos [25],
which show only three domains anterior to the leg-bearing
segments, corresponding to the three cephalic segments
(Figure 1B).
Based on various studies of embryology [14-20],
including the expression data of the anterior Hox genes

labial, proboscipedia, Hox3 and Deformed [26], the onychophoran “head” appendages can therefore be aligned
with the corresponding appendages of arthropods
(Figure 1C). According to this alignment, the onychophoran antennae are either serial homologues of the
arthropod labrum or, alternatively, the corresponding
pair of appendages may have been lost in arthropods - an

Mayer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:255

issue that is still controversial [5,27-29]. (It has also
been argued that the arthropod labrum is a modified
appendage of the third body segment [30]. However,
the Hox gene expression data referred to above,
together with the common expression of the anterior
marker six3 in the insect labrum and onychophoran
antenna [26], speak against this possibility.) Since the
onychophoran antennae belong to the anterior-most
body segment bearing the eyes [19,20], they cannot be
homologised with the chelicerae of chelicerates or the
(first) antennae of crustaceans, insects, and myriapods,
which belong to the second body segment [2,3,31]. The
chelicerae and the (first) antennae of arthropods are
instead serially homologous to the onychophoran jaws
(Figure 1C). The onychophoran slime papillae are, in
turn, serially homologous to the pedipalps of chelicerates and to the second antennae of crustaceans
whereas the corresponding pair of appendages was lost
in hexapods and myriapods [review [2]].
This alignment of head segments is reflected in the
organisation of the central nervous system. Three major
brain regions are generally recognised in arthropods
(Figure 2A): the protocerebrum (forebrain), the deutocerebrum (midbrain), and the tritocerebrum (hindbrain),
corresponding to the three anterior-most body segments
[2,27,31-35]. Such an organisation has also been suggested for the Onychophora, based on studies of adult
brain anatomy and its neuropilar structure [21,22,31].

However, an alternative view [36,37] suggests that the
onychophoran brain or “cerebral ganglion” [38,39] is
bipartite and does not include the region homologous to
the arthropod tritocerebrum.
One feature that has previously been used to determine the segmental organisation of the brain in Onychophora is the position and number of transverse
neuropils in the adult [31]. Three major neuropils have
been identified, leading to the conclusion that the onychophoran brain is tripartite. However, this rests on the
assumption that each neuropil arises from a separate
segment during development - an issue, which has not
been clarified thus far. An additional feature that could
be used to identify the degree of segmentation of the
onychophoran brain is the position of neuronal cell
bodies innervating the head appendages. If the cell
bodies of neurons innervating the tritocerebrum were
found to lie within the brain (Figure 2B), the hypothesis
of tripartite organisation [31] would be supported. In
contrast, a position of these neuronal cell bodies found
outside the brain (Figure 2C) would speak against the
existence of the tritocerebrum in Onychophora.
To clarify the segmental composition of the onychophoran brain, we combined two approaches. First, we
studied brain development to determine the embryonic
origin of transverse neuropils. Second, we analysed the
position of neuronal cell bodies innervating the cephalic
appendages. Our results show that the major transverse

neuropils of the onychophoran brain arise from only
one (the anterior-most) body segment, and that only the
antennae and jaws are innervated by the brain. These
findings suggest that the onychophorans show a lower
degree of cephalisation in relation to their brain organisation than the arthropods and that the tritocerebrum
was not integrated into the brain in the last common
ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda.

Results and Discussion
The formation of onychophoran brain neuropils involves
only one segment

Despite two recent and extensive studies of brain development in Onychophora [19,40], the embryonic origin
and segmental identities of transverse brain neuropils,
other than the first ("antennal”) commissure, remain
unclear. Strausfeld et al. [31] subdivided the adult onychophoran brain into protocerebrum, deutocerebrum
and tritocerebrum by analysing series of histological and

silver- and osmium-stained sections and assessing the
number and spatial separation of brain neuropils. To
clarify whether these brain neuropils have independent
origins from different segments, we examined brain
development in onychophoran embryos using an antibody raised against acetylated a-tubulin. This antibody
labels mainly nerve tracts and neuropils in the developing nervous system [19,40-42].
At an early stage, we detected only one transverse commissure in the anterior-most body segment (Figure 3A aligning this figure with the regions of engrailed expression shown in figs. 1d and f in [25] confirms our assignment of segmental identity). During development, this
commissure forms the central neuropil, which subsequently gives rise to a second and a third neuropil (Figure
3B-D). No other transverse neuropils appear posterior to
the central neuropil later in development [see also
[19,40]]. Thus, the three neuropils identified as proto-,
deuto- and tritocerebrum in a previous study [31] do not

arise from three different segments. We suggest therefore that the position and physical separation of neuropils in the adult brain alone [22,31] is an unreliable
criterion for identifying its segmental organisation.
Thus, our immunolabelling experiments do not resolve
the controversy of bipartite [36,37] versus tripartite
[21,22,31] brain composition in Onychophora. Alternative approaches are required to decide between these
two hypotheses.
Retrograde axonal tracing reveals that the tritocerebrum
is absent from the onychophoran brain

The position of neurons that project out the segmental
nerves within the onychophoran head might be a key
feature for determining the segmental identity of different brain regions. We therefore performed retrograde
axonal tracing studies (backfills) of segmental cephalic
nerves in adult onychophorans, using dextran coupled
to different fluorochromes as a tracer [43].

We found that the cell bodies of neurons innervating
the antennae lie within the brain (Figure 4A), in the
region corresponding to the arthropod protocerebrum
[19,20,31,44]. Some of the filled axons of the antennal
nerve terminate in glomerular structures (Figure 4B),
which have been described previously [31,38,44]. The
cell bodies innervating the jaws and the slime papillae
lie adjacent to the base of their corresponding nerves:
the jaw neurons are situated in the posterior-most
(deutocerebral) region of the cerebral ganglion whereas
those innervating the slime papillae lie in a more postero-ventral position within the nerve cord (Figures 4C,
D and 5A-C).
Our data show that the neurons innervating the slime
papillae are located within the ventral nerve cord and,
thus, outside the brain, the posterior border of which
lies just posterior to the jaw nerves and anterior to the
slime papillae nerves (Figure 5C). This placement of the
posterior brain border is consistent with all previous

studies of the adult onychophoran brain anatomy [e.g.
[21,22,31,36-39,44,45] and references therein]. The neurons innervating the slime papillae cannot be considered
part of the brain as the corresponding region of the central nervous system does not show any particular condensation of neurons or other morphological
characteristics that would distinguish it from the medullary nerve cords.
Our backfill data reveal that only the cell bodies of
neurons supplying the antennae and jaws lie within the

brain whereas the region corresponding to the arthropod tritocerebrum belongs to the nerve cord (Figure
5A-C). This finding contradicts previous assumptions of
a tripartite (three-segmented) brain in Onychophora
[2,21,22,24,31]. The absence of the tritocerebrum from
the onychophoran brain implies that the bipartite brain
composition is an ancestral feature of Onychophora. An
alternative scenario proposing that the tritocerebrum
might have become separated from the onychophoran
brain secondarily is unlikely since one would have to

Mayer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:255
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/255

assume opposite relocation events during the evolution
of the onychophoran head: while the slime papillae have
been incorporated into the head by moving anteriorly,
the corresponding brain region would have become
separated from the cerebral ganglion by a postero-ventral relocation. Moreover, this region would have lost its
ganglionic organisation and reverted back to a portion
of the medullary nerve cord. Studies of early neural
development in the onychophoran embryo [19,41,42]
have revealed no evidence for an origin in the presumptive brain of the neural precursors that give rise to neurons innervating the slime papillae. We therefore regard
this scenario as unlikely and suggest that the tritocerebrum was not present in the last common ancestor of
Onychophora and Arthropoda but rather evolved in
arthropods (Figure 6).

Conclusions
In summary, our findings suggest an increase in the
number of segmental brain regions in the (pan)arthropod lineage, from two in the last common ancestor of
Onychophora and Arthropoda, to at least three in various arthropods [e.g. [2,27,31,32]]. This evolutionary

Page 7 of 9

sequence may help clarify the phylogenetic position of
Tardigrada (water bears), which is still controversial.
Currently, tardigrades are regarded as either the sister
group of arthropods, of onychophorans, of onychophorans plus arthropods, or of one of the cycloneuralian taxa
(nematodes, kinorhynchs, and allies) [10,11,41,46-54].
Our findings suggest that the number of segments in
the tardigrade brain, which remains unclear [48,55-58],
will be a key feature in elucidating the position of this
animal group within the Ecdysozoa.
Furthermore, our suggestion of a two-segmented brain
in the last common ancestor of Onychophora and
Arthropoda challenges the hypothesis that a tripartite
brain existed in the last common ancestor of the bilaterally symmetrical animals, the so-called “urbilaterian”
[59,60]. Such a brain is absent in all protostomes apart
from arthropods. Moreover, the closest relatives of chordates, including hemichordates and echinoderms [48],
lack a centralised brain. We therefore suggest that similar gene expression patterns in the anterior body region
of arthropods and vertebrates [59,60] are not related to
brain segmentation but rather to a general patterning of
the antero-posterior body axis in these animals.

Figure 6 Implications of the current findings for the evolution of the arthropod brain. The brain of the last common ancestor of
Onychophora and Arthropoda was composed of the protocerebrum and deutocerebrum whereas the tritocerebrum, as part of the brain,
evolved in arthropods (chelicerates, myriapods, crustaceans, and hexapods). The phylogenetic position of Myriapoda is unresolved [42,63].
Double lines for Crustacea indicate that this group might not be monophyletic [64].

Methods
Specimens of Euperipatoides rowelli Reid, 1996 and
Epiperipatus isthmicola (Bouvier, 1902) were collected
and handled and the embryos staged and labelled with
an antibody raised against acetylated a-tubulin as
described previously [41,42]. For neuronal tracing, adult
brain nerves were dissected in physiological saline based
on onychophoran blood composition [61]. Retrograde
fills of the antennal nerves (n = 3), jaw nerves (n = 9),
and slime papillae nerves (n = 7) were carried out with
dextran (MW 3000) coupled to either tetramethylrhodamine or fluorescein according to standard procedures
used for arthropods [43]. Scanning electron microscopy
and immunohistochemistry were performed as described
previously [42]. Stained specimens were dehydrated
through a methanol series and mounted between two
cover slips in a 2:1 mixture of benzyl benzoate and
benzyl alcohol. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy and
image processing were carried out as described
previously [41,42].
