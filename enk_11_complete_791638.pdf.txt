Abstract
Background: Late Pleistocene North America hosted at least two divergent and ecologically distinct species of
mammoth: the periglacial woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) and the subglacial Columbian mammoth
(Mammuthus columbi). To date, mammoth genetic research has been entirely restricted to woolly mammoths,
rendering their genetic evolution difficult to contextualize within broader Pleistocene paleoecology and
biogeography. Here, we take an interspecific approach to clarifying mammoth phylogeny by targeting Columbian
mammoth remains for mitogenomic sequencing.
Results: We sequenced the first complete mitochondrial genome of a classic Columbian mammoth, as well as the
first complete mitochondrial genome of a North American woolly mammoth. Somewhat contrary to conventional
paleontological models, which posit that the two species were highly divergent, the M. columbi mitogenome we
obtained falls securely within a subclade of endemic North American M. primigenius.
Conclusions: Though limited, our data suggest that the two species interbred at some point in their evolutionary
histories. One potential explanation is that woolly mammoth haplotypes entered Columbian mammoth
populations via introgression at subglacial ecotones, a scenario with compelling parallels in extant elephants and
consistent with certain regional paleontological observations. This highlights the need for multi-genomic data to
sufficiently characterize mammoth evolutionary history. Our results demonstrate that the use of next-generation
sequencing technologies holds promise in obtaining such data, even from non-cave, non-permafrost Pleistocene
depositional contexts.

Background
Conventional paleontological models [1-4] of North
American mammoth evolution posit that at least two
species occupied the continent during the late Pleistocene (150,000 to 10,000 years ago: Mammuthus primigenius (woolly mammoths (WMs)) evolved in Eurasia
and immigrated to North America in the late Pleistocene, whereas Mammuthus columbi (Columbian mammoths (CMs)) evolved locally from an earlier
Pleistocene immigrant ancestor (Mammuthus meridionalis [1,2] or Mammuthus trogontherii [3,4]). The species are morphologically differentiated by physical size
(CMs were some 25% taller than WMs [5]), molar complexity (CMs displayed more ‘primitive’ crown height

and lamellar configuration), and skull morphology (CMs
possessed a more downturned mandibular symphysis
and more laterally oriented tusk alveoli) [1,5]. Some of
these traits are considered adaptations to their disparate
habitats: WMs inhabited cold and arid periglacial
regions, while CMs inhabited the temperate regions of
the southern latitudes. Continental populations of both
species went extinct during the Pleistocene-Holocene
transition some 10,000 years ago.
Recent paleontological reconsiderations [6-8] and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeographic studies of predominantly Beringian mammoths [9-13] reveal a complex
evolutionary history (Figure 1a). Their populations harbored diverse genetic lineages, two of which, haplogroups
A and C, were endemic to Eurasia and North America,
respectively. Certain population dynamics - including
major immigration/replacement events and regional
genetic introgression - have been offered as explanations

Figure 1 Mammoth mitochondrial DNA cladograms. (a) WM lineages (blue) are summarized from previous studies [9-11] with clades
indicated and haplogroups labeled at the tips. Hypothetical CM lineage positions (green) are expected positions derived from strict
interpretations of paleontological models that posit the two species were separate since the early Pleistocene. The multiple node positions
reflect the general uncertainty surrounding the chronology and identity of the WM lineage common ancestor. The position of WM haplogroup B
is poorly resolved, exhibiting deep common ancestry with the other haplogroups. Haplogroups A and C are endemic to Eurasia and North
America, respectively; haplogroups B, D, and E occur on both continents. Radiocarbon chronologies indicate that haplogroup A went extinct
approximately 35,000 14Cya, and clade I by approximately 3,200 14Cya. Calculated MRCA ages for all nodes yield wide confidence intervals. (b)
Our estimated mtDNA cladograms of haplogroup C are depicted using two datasets: the black cladogram and associated scale and posterior
probabilities (parameter set 1b, Figure S4 in Additional file 3) are estimated from 743 bp for which several dozen mammoths have been
sequenced, whereas the red cladogram and associated scale and posterior probabilities (parameter set 4b, Figure S8 in Additional file 3) are
estimated from full mitochondrial genomes, for which only one other haplogroup C mammoth has been sequenced. Each tip in the black
cladogram represents a haplotype. M. columbi (haplotype C32) as represented by the Huntington Mammoth is indicated with a yellow star. Scale
units are substitutions per site.

for this complexity [10,11], but its precise origins have
proven difficult to define within the broader context of
Pleistocene biogeography and paleoecology. This is the
case for at least two reasons: first, key coalescent dates
remain difficult to measure, in large part due to lack of
sequence breadth and methodological shortcomings
[14,15]; and second, almost nothing is known about the
mtDNA phylogeny of Mammuthus beyond Beringian late
Pleistocene mammoths (and thus probably exclusively M.
primigenius). One potential solution to both problems -

and means to hone conceptions of Pleistocene mammoth
evolution in general - is to sequence DNA from one or
more closely related but distinct mammoth species and
use it as a temporal and taxonomic calibration tool within
the mammoth gene tree. Owing to their apparently separate evolutionary history (Figure 1a) and reasonably welldated recent divergence from WMs about 1 to 2 million
years ago [16], CMs are excellent candidates for this role.
To this end we targeted CM remains for mitogenomic
sequencing.

We selected the Huntington Mammoth [17] for this
purpose on account of its secure morphological identification, direct radiocarbon date (11,220 ± 110 14 Cya
(radiocarbon years ago), exceptional biomolecular preservation [18] and geographic provenience (Fairview,
UT, USA), far south of the Wisconsinan glaciers. Typical strategies for DNA sequencing of paleontological
specimens would employ a pre-sequencing targeted
enrichment approach, through the use of either laborintensive PCR or hybridization techniques [19]. However, following serial extraction and library preparation
of our specimen, a quantitative PCR-based metric projected a sufficient ratio of target to non-target DNA to
warrant a shotgun-based metagenomic sequencing
approach, for which we employed the Illumina platform
(see Materials and methods; Additional file 1).

Results and Discussion
Of the over 27 million reads longer than 50 bp obtained
from the Huntington sample library, between 6,000 and
9,000 (0.02 to 0.03%) mapped to a WM reference mitogenome [GenBank: NC007596.2] [20] depending on
software assembly parameters (Table S3 in Additional
file 2). This provided an average unique read depth of
approximately 23 × for the entire mitochondrial genome, excluding the VNTR region (positions 16,157 to
16,476). Roughly 2 million reads also mapped to the
African elephant (Loxodonta africana) nuclear genome,
providing approximately 0.03 × coverage of the entire
nuclear genome of the animal, and bringing the total
likely mammoth DNA read count to approximately 7%
of all sequences. Such a proportion of total endogenous
DNA is consistent with taphonomic models for DNA
preservation in temperate burial contexts [21], as well as
experimental data from other non-permafrost remains
[22,23]. The coverage depth ratio we observe between
mitochondrial and nuclear reads (approximately 800 ×)
also falls within the range estimated in other mammoth
specimens (245 to 17,000 × [24]). This low nuclear read
coverage depth also lends evidence that potential Numts
make no significant contribution to the consensus generated from the mitochondrial assembly.
To ensure the authenticity of the mitogenome
sequence, we amplified, cloned and sequenced PCR products of WM haplotype-defining regions of the cytochrome b gene and hypervariable region from multiple
extractions of the Huntington mammoth in two separate
ancient DNA facilities. These all yielded consensus
sequences 100% identical to the shotgun consensus
where they overlapped. Furthermore, we sequenced the
same loci from PCRs of another securely identified M.
columbi (the Union Pacific mammoth, University of
Wyoming 6368, found near Rawlins, WY, USA [25,26]),
which yielded identical sequences to those acquired for

Page 3 of 8

Huntington. Finally, to control for ascertainment bias in
assembly of the whole mitogenome, we mapped the Illumina sequencing reads to an Asiatic elephant (Elephas
maximus) mitogenome [GenBank: DQ316068] and
obtained a 99.98% identical consensus sequence where it
overlapped with the WM assembly consensus. Thus, we
are confident that the final Huntington mammoth mitogenome sequence derives from the genuine endogenous
mtDNA of the animal.
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the
Huntington mammoth mitogenome is largely indiscernible from those of endemic North American WMs (Figure 1b). For all model and parameter variants (Table S7
in Additional file 2, Figures S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8 in
Additional file 3), the sequence sorts securely within
haplogroup C, a subclade additionally represented by
dozens of WMs from Alaska and the Yukon [11]. To
test for this relationship at the entire mitogenomic level,
we also sequenced the first complete mitogenome of a
WM from this haplogroup (IK-99-70, from the Alaskan
North Slope, USA), which confirmed Huntington’s phylogenetic position within haplogroup C (Figure 1b).
At first glance, these results would suggest that, contrary to a strict interpretation of traditional paleontological models for their evolution, CMs and WMs did not
descend from populations that were wholly separate
since the early Pleistocene. One interpretation could be
that mitochondrial haplogroup C corresponds to descendants of immigrant mammoth populations that ultimately gave rise to M. columbi. But without expansion,
this interpretation would fail to explain why haplogroup
C belongs to mammoths with both CM and WM
morphologies. Indeed, certain paleontological interpretations have already suggested that CMs and WMs were
more closely related than typically thought, even ‘geoclinal or chronoclinal variants’ [27] descending from a
very recent common ancestor. We find that our results
also warrant consideration of an alternative scheme, one
that operates within existing paleontological models but
that accommodates incomplete reproductive barriers
between CMs and WMs during some period(s) of their
evolutionary history.
mtDNA phylogenies are often inconsistent with species phylogenies [28], especially for populations with
sex-biased dispersion and breeding patterns. This is particularly true for extant elephants [29,30], which exhibit
male-mediated gene flow between matriarchal herds,
rendering their mtDNA phylogenies incomplete representations of breeding history. For example, Asiatic elephant and WM populations both harbor(ed) at least two
highly divergent mitochondrial lineages without corresponding morphological differentiation [9-11,31].
Between CMs and WMs, we observe the opposite situation, where their morphological distinction appears to

Enk et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R51
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/5/R51

have little mitochondrial genetic correlation. One potential explanation for this is that incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) resulted in the maintenance in CM
populations of what ultimately became more WM-like
mitochondrial lineages. However, if this were the case,
we would expect the CM-WM most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) to be positioned much deeper in the
cytochrome b/hypervariable region phylogeny than
observed. Our and previous [11] dual-calibrated estimates for the MRCA for the entirety of haplogroup C
dates to the middle Pleistocene (Table S7 in Additional
file 2), with the CM-WM MRCA necessarily occurring
much more recently, long after their purported species
divergence. That said, the haplogroup C full mitochondrial dataset is too small to completely rule out ILS during CM-WM speciation as a plausible explanation.
At present, however, we suspect that hybridization
between CMs and WMs may be a more parsimonious
explanation for our observations. Under one conception,
haplogroup C could have been a predominantly CM
haplogroup that introgressed into WM populations, at

Page 4 of 8

such a frequency that it came to dominate the North
American mitochondrial gene pool of that species. The
fact that both CMs sequenced here are haplogroup C
would lend some support to this hypothesis. Another
possibility is that introgression occurred in the opposite
direction, such that WM-typical haplogroup C introgressed into CM populations (Figure 2a). From a behavioral perspective, this configuration is perhaps more
likely, especially in light of phenomena documented in
extant African forest (Loxodonta cyclotis) and savanna
(L. africana) elephants (Figure 2b). These living species
are morphologically distinct and deeply divergent at
many nuclear loci [32-35], but are known to interbreed
at forest-savanna ecotones [36,37]. The result is ‘cytonuclear dissociation’ [38] between genomes in hybrid
individuals, such that forest-typical mitochondrial haplotypes occur at low frequency in savanna populations.
Hypothetically, this is driven by savanna males reproductively out-competing physically smaller forest males
[38], producing unidirectional backcrossing of hybrid
females into savanna populations. Since mammoths

were probably very similar to modern elephants in social
and reproductive behavior [4,27], it is conceivable that
WMs and the physically larger CMs engaged in a similar
dynamic when they encountered each other. Indeed,
hybridization between CMs and WMs has already been
suggested by others [39], and genetic exchange may
explain mammoths bearing CM-WM intermediate
morphologies. Such mammoths are frequently found in
areas where CMs and WMs overlapped in time and
space, such as the Great Lakes region [2]. Some of these
apparent intermediates have been formally named (for
example, Mammuthus jeffersonii), but their taxonomic
identity is questionable. Indeed, the large number of
synonyms currently registered for North American
mammoths [40] is at least partly a function of efforts by
earlier systematists to come to grips with the large
amount of morphological variation expressed within
Mammuthus (or Elephas). Although the Huntington
mammoth exhibits no such morphological intermediacy
and was found quite distant from the documented WM
range, its status as a genetic hybrid would not be inconsistent with the modern analog: forest haplotype-bearing
savanna elephants can be found several thousands of
kilometers from modern ecotones, bearing no phenotypic indication of hybridism [38].
Both the ILS and introgression hypotheses discussed
above provide straightforward testable predictions. First,
under a WM-CM introgression scenario, some presently
unidentified and distinct mitochondrial haplogroup should
characterize a significant percentage of CM lineages, rendering their mitogenomes polyphyletic, as they are in L.
africana (Figure 2). While we also observe a likely C haplotype in short sequences from one other well-identified
terminal Pleistocene M. columbi, only a broad populationlevel survey of CM genetic diversity can rigorously test
this prediction. Second, under the introgression hypothesis, CMs with WM-type mitogenomes should possess
nuclear genes that are significantly more divergent from
WMs than all haplogroup C mammoths are from each
other. On the other hand, an ILS scenario would predict
that CM and WM nuclear genes should show a similar
degree of divergence as is detected between haplogroup C
mitogenomes. Though we did recover several million
nuclear sequences from the Huntington DNA library, the
very low coverage depth provided by these reads is not
sufficient for reliable nuclear divergence estimates between
CMs and WMs. However, we anticipate that targeted
enrichment techniques [41,42] prior to high-throughput
sequencing will provide the necessary coverage depth to
test these hypotheses in the near future.

Conclusions
The revealed mitochondrial phylogenetic position of M.
columbi does not immediately clarify complexities and

Page 5 of 8

chronological uncertainties previously observed in mammoth mtDNA phylogeny. Instead, it emphasizes that the
unique reproductive behavior of elephantids necessitates
a multi-genomic approach to characterizing their evolutionary history, as has been so effectively used in studies
of living elephants. Their very recent mitochondrial common ancestry strongly suggests that CMs and WMs
interbred at some point, most likely post-dating their
morphological divergence, and in a fashion that confounds simple correlation of mtDNA phylogeny to evolutionary models derived from mammoth morphology
alone. However, the precise mode and setting of genetic
interchange between WMs and CMs are elusive, and
therefore all hypotheses explaining our observations warrant testing. The possibility that hybridization explains
our data is particularly tantalizing, since in many animals,
interspecific hybridization accompanies population displacement and/or expansion resulting from habitat
reconfiguration [43,44]. Thus, interbreeding between
extinct late Pleistocene taxa - especially keystone herbivores like mammoths - could serve as an indicator of
major ecological events, including those surrounding the
megafaunal extinctions. Our results demonstrate that the
use of next-generation sequencing technologies holds
promise in rigorously testing such hypotheses using full
ancient genomic data, even from non-cave, non-permafrost Pleistocene depositional contexts.

Materials and methods
Samples

We included two M. columbi (Columbian mammoths)
and one Mammuthus sp. in the sample set, stored at
room temperature at our laboratory.
Huntington mammoth - M. columbi

College of Eastern Utah Museum CEUM897 is associated with numerous radiocarbon dates, though 11,220
± 110 14Cya is probably most accurate [17]. It was discovered in 1988 during excavation of a stream for dam
construction, at the southeast end of what is now Huntington Reservoir, just east of Fairview, Utah, USA. This
60+ year old bull is exceptionally well preserved, and
exhibits the classic character suite of his species, including low molar lamellar frequency (Figure S1 in Additional file 3), broadly divergent tusk alveoli, a markedly
downturned mandibular symphysis, and tremendous
body size. We used tusk fragments for the shotgun
sequencing, and both tusk and bone samples for PCR
and Sanger sequencing.
Union Pacific mammoth - M. columbi

University of Wyoming UW6368 is dated to 11,280 ±
350 14Cya [25,26]. It was discovered in 1960 by a gas
well-drilling crew while drag-lining a spring site southwest of Rawlins, Wyoming, USA. Fragments of molar
teeth were used for PCR and Sanger sequencing.

Specimen found in the Upper Ikpikpuk River (70° 47’N,
154° 25’W) on the Alaskan North Slope of the USA.
Provenience strongly suggests that it is M. primigenius.
Radiocarbon dated to 41,510 ± 480 14 Cya (Beta
#264909, Beta Analytic Inc., Miami, FL, USA). The
mitochondrial hypervariable region for this specimen
was partially sequenced previously [11] and falls within
haplogroup C (haplotype C30). Its exceptional DNA
preservation prompted its use in the multiplex
experiments.

Sequence acquisition, assembly, and classification

Procedures were performed at a number of laboratories
[45-49]. Detailed descriptions of wet laboratory procedures
used for sequence acquisition, as well as laboratory procedures for data assembly, can be found in Additional file 1.
Primers were taken from previous publications or newly
designed using the Integrated DNA Technologies SciTools
OligoAnalyzer 3.1 [50]. Pre-sequencing preservation evaluations were performed following [24,51,52]. We used a
metagenomic high-throughput sequencing approach to
characterize the whole mitochondrial genome of the Huntington mammoth, and multiplex PCR combined with
high-throughput sequencing to obtain the whole mitochondrial genome of IK-99-70. We also cloned and
sequenced several PCR products from the mammoths,
with independent PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of products from the Huntington mammoth performed at a separate laboratory. We assembled
mitochondrial reads with AMOScmp [53] using NUCmer
[54] as well as with Geneious 5.1.7 [55] and then visualized
assemblies using amosvalidate [56], Hawkeye [57] and Geneious. The Huntington nuclear genome read assemblies
were built using these and also classified using PhymmBL
[58], comparing previously published WM nuclear genome
sequences [59] and the L. africana nuclear genome
sequence [60]. Sequence read files for Huntington and IK99-70 are deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA)
as #SRP006656. Sanger trace files from Huntington, Union
Pacific, and IK-99-70 are deposited in the NCBI Trace
Archive as #TI2306523713-2306523816. Consensus mitochondrial sequences are deposited in GenBank as

assemblies of Huntington, IK-99-70, and Union Pacific
reads and traces are available at [61].
