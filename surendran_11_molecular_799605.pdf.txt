Abstract
Background: Anopheles annularis s.l. is a wide spread malaria vector in South and Southeast Asia, including Sri
Lanka. The taxon An. annularis is a complex of two sibling species viz. A and B, that are differentiated by
chromosome banding patterns and ribosomal gene sequences in India. Only species A is reported to be a malaria
vector in India while the occurrence of sibling species in Sri Lanka has not been documented previously.
Findings: Anopheline larvae were collected at a site in the Jaffna district, which lies within the dry zone of Sri
Lanka, and reared in the laboratory. Emerged adults were identified using standard keys. DNA sequences of the D3
domain of 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) of the morphologically identified
An. annularis were determined. BLASTn searches against corresponding An. annularis sequences in GenBank and
construction of phylogenetic trees from D3 and ITS-2 rDNA sequences showed that the Sri Lankan specimens, and
An. annularis s.l. specimens from several Southeast Asian countries were closely related to species A of the Indian
An. annularis complex.
Conclusions: The results show the presence of the malaria vector An. annularis species A in Sri Lanka and
Southeast Asia. Because An. annularis vectors have been long associated with malaria transmission in irrigated
agricultural areas in the Sri Lankan dry zone, continued monitoring of An. annularis populations, and their sibling
species status, in these areas need to be integral to malaria control and eradication efforts in the island.

Findings
Anopheles (Cellia) annularis Van der Wulp is one of the
species that form the “Annularis Group” that are classified under the Neocellia series of the subgenus Cellia [1].
The other members of this group are An. nivipes,
An. philippinensis, An. pallidus and An. schueffneri.
An. annularis s.l. is widespread in Asia from the Indian
subcontinent to Southeast Asia, and has been incriminated as vector of malaria in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaysia and China [2-5]. The taxon An. annularis
is reported to be a species complex comprising two sibling species viz. A and B in India [2,4]. The two sibling

species can be distinguished through characteristic banding patterns in the polytene chromosome arm 2 [2]. They
also possess different sequences in the D3 region of 28S
RNA and the ITS-2 internally transcribed spacer region
of ribosomal RNA [3]
An. annularis s.l. was previously reported to be an
efficient local vector in a large irrigation project in the
North-Central province in the dry zone of Sri Lanka [6].
In India species A is incriminated as a malaria vector
while species B is a non-vector [4]. The Jaffna district,
located in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, is an agricultural
area that has been traditionally endemic for malaria but
has seen the incidence decrease rapidly in the past few
years due to the implementation of efficient malaria
control measures [7]. An understanding of bionomics of
different anopheline vectors in Jaffna and elsewhere in

Sri Lanka is however needed for sustaining the control
of malaria in the island. We therefore characterised the
sibling species status of An. annularis specimens collected in the Jaffna district based on DNA sequences of
ribosomal RNA genes.
Anopheline larvae were collected using dippers as
described earlier [8] during May and August 2011 from
Chinnakulam pond (9°44 “ 33.02 ’ N: 80°00 “ 33.11 ’ E) in
Chunnakam in the Jaffna district of the northern dry
zone of Sri Lanka [Figure 1]. Collected larvae were
brought to the Zoology Laboratory of the University of
Jaffna and reared under laboratory conditions (28° ± 2°C)
until they emerge as adults. Larvae were fed locally available powered fish meal pellets. Emerged adults were
identified using standard keys [9,10]. Identified An. annularis and An. pallidus were preserved in isopropanol for
subsequent molecular characterization.
The DNA from individual mosquitoes was extracted as
described previously [11] with slight modification. Individual mosquitoes were homogenized with a plastic tissue
grinder in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. 100 μl LIVAK
extraction buffer (80 mM NaCl, 5.48% w/v sucrose,
1.57% w/v Tris-base, 50.8 mM EDTA, 05% w/v SDS) was

added and samples were kept at 65°C for 30 min. Following the addition of 14 μl of 8 M potassium acetate, the
homogenates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then
centrifuged at 4°C for 20 min at 13, 000 rpm. Supernatants were recovered and DNA was precipitated overnight by the addition of 400 μl ethanol, then centrifuged
at 4°C for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was
discarded and DNA pellets were rinsed in 100 μl cold
70% ethanol, then centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min at 13, 000
rpm. Pellets were dried and resuspended in 50 μl TE buffer (pH 8.0). The ITS-2 region of the rDNA was amplified using primers ITS-2A (5 ’ - TGT GAA CTG CAG
GAC ACA T- 3’) and ITS-2B (5’- TAT GCT TAA ATT
CAG GGG GT - 3’) [12]. The D3 domain of 28S rDNA
was amplified using D3A (5’-GAC CCG TCT TGA AAC
ACG GA-3’) and D3B (5’ - TCG GAA GGA ACC AGT
TAC TA - 3 ’ ) primers [13]. For each PCR assay, 50 μl
PCR reaction mixture was used. Each mixture contained
0.50 μM of each primer, 200 μM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM
of MgCl 2 and 1.25 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega,
USA). The PCR conditions for both PCRs (GeneAmp
PCR System 9600, Applied Biosystems) were an initial
denaturation at 95°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of

95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s followed by
a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. The PCR products
that were successfully amplified were then purified using
the Quiaquik PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, California,
USA) to remove unincorporated primers and dNTPs
prior to sequencing. The purified PCR amplicons were
sent to M/s GENETECH, Sri Lanka for sequencing in
both the forward and reverse directions. The derived
sequences obtained were then analysed together with
other representative sequences obtained from GenBank
using ClustalW. Neighbour-Joining phylogeny tree was
constructed with Bootstrap values from 500 replicates
using the MEGA software [14].
Sequences of D3 and ITS-2 were derived from three
An. annularis (annularis- Sri Lanka -1,2,3) and one
An. pallidus (pallidus - Sri Lanka-1) specimens. These
sequences were then compared by BLASTn searches
against the corresponding Indian sequences in GenBank.
The best match for D3 of the Sri Lankan An. annularis
was with An. annularis species A of India with 100%
identity over 352 bp (E-value 0) and for ITS-2 with
An. annularis species A of India with 100% identity over
347 bp (E-value 0). The DNA sequences of specimens

collected in this study in Jaffna have been deposited in
GenBank with details as follows: D3 (JQ268278-annularis- Sri Lanka -1; JQ268279- annularis- Sri Lanka -3;
JQ268281-pallidus- Sri Lanka -1) and ITS-2 (JQ268277annularis- Sri Lanka -1; JQ268280 - annularis - Sri Lanka
-3; JQ268282-pallidus- Sri Lanka -1).
Construction of a phylogenetic tree based on D3 rDNA
sequences resulted in two An. annularis clades [Figure
2]. One clade consisted D3 sequences from mosquitoes
identified as sibling species A of the An. annularis in
India, six An. annularis s.l. specimens from different
Southeast Asian countries, one specimen of An. annularis s.l. collected previously in Sri Lanka (FJ526536.1)
and the three An. annularis specimens from Jaffna. This
clade is termed as the species A clade. The second related
An. annularis clade contained a single sequence from
sibling species B of An. annularis of India and is termed
the species B clade. The differences between species A
and B of India were caused by two substitutions [3]. The
D3 sequences of Sri Lankan samples [present study and
the voucher An. annularis s.l. specimen from Sri Lanka
(FJ526536.1)] showed the same substitutions fixed for
species A [Additional File 1].

An An. pallidus voucher specimen collected from Sri
Lanka (FJ526535.1) and a specimen from the present
study formed a distinct third clade in the D3 analysis
[Figure 2].
Sequence analysis of the ITS-2 sequences of An. annularis collected during the present study and other available GenBank sequences for An. annularis s.l. were also
carried out. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the
three An. annularis from Jaffna formed a clade with An.
annularis species A specimens from India and other An.
annularis s.l. specimens from Southeast Asia and one
from Sri Lanka [Figure 3]. This clade is again termed as
the species A clade. A second related clade was represented by a single An. annularis species B specimen from
India. The difference between species A and B of India
was caused by seven substitutions and four indel events
[3]. The reported substitutions and indels found in species A of India were present in the Sri Lankan samples
[specimens of present study and a voucher specimen
from Sri Lanka (FJ526607.1)] [Additional File 2].
The ITS-2 sequence from An. pallidus (FJJF526606.1)
a voucher specimen from Sri Lanka and the An. pallidus
specimen from Jaffna formed a third separate clade

[Figure 3]. The sequence data from D3 and ITS-2
regions therefore confirm the morphological identification of An. pallidus in Sri Lanka.
Our findings show that An. annularis species A, confirmed as a vector species in India, is also present in the
Jaffna district. The phylogenetic analysis further reveals
that vector species A is widespread and can therefore
play a role in malaria transmission in Southeast Asia.
A 1990 study at Weheragala, an agricultural settlement
close to newly constructed irrigation canals of the Mahaweli river development project in the Sri Lankan dry zone,
showed that An. annularis s.l. functioned as the predominant local vector, accounting for > 75% of the human-biting anopheline collection [6]. A very high entomological
inoculation rate (EIR) for Plasmodium vivax of 0.12 infective bites per hour during the peak transmission season
was reported for An. annularis at Weheragala [6]. The
corresponding EIRs for An. culicifacies, the major vector
of malaria elsewhere in Sri Lanka, were 0.06 and 0.04 for
Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum during the peak
transmission season at Weheragala [6]. These high local
malaria transmission rates, characterised by parasite prevalence rates of 20% in the population, may have initiated or

contributed to the malaria epidemics in the country at that
time. The present results are compatible with the suggestion that An. annularis species A may have been the relevant sibling species contributing to past malaria
transmission in Weheragala and elsewhere in the Sri Lankan dry zone.
In some Indian states, e.g. Uttar Pradesh, An. annularis
species A and B are sympatric with high zoophilic behavior and yet neither has yet been incriminated as vector.
However in the states of Assam and Orissa only species
A is present and implicated as a vector [2]. Both species
are confined to riverine and canal-irrigated ecosystems in
India. However presence of species A is also reported in
hilly areas [2]. In this context, it will be useful to investigate the presence of An. annularis sibling species in the
extensive hill country of central Sri Lanka.
The malaria incidence in Sri Lanka has fallen sharply
from 210,039 cases in the year 2000 to 558 cases in 2009
[7]. The Ministry of Health plans to eliminate malaria
from the country by 2015. However in the post-civil war
era in Sri Lanka, there is resettlement of malaria-naïve
persons and an expansion of agriculture in the dry zone.
The presence of An. annularis species A in Sri Lanka,
with its ability to undergo preimaginal development in
the irrigated parts of the dry zone is therefore an important factor to be considered in planning for malaria eradication and control in the island.
The present study documents the presence of the
malaria vector An. annularis species A in Sri Lanka and
elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Because of the reported
association of An. annularis vectors with malaria transmission in irrigated agricultural areas in the Sri Lankan
dry zone, continued monitoring of An. annularis populations in these areas need to be integral to malaria control and eradication efforts in the island.
