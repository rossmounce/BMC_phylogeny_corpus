Abstract
Background: In the flowering plants, many polyploid species complexes display evolutionary radiation. This could be
facilitated by gene flow between otherwise separate evolutionary lineages in contact zones. Achillea collina is a
widespread tetraploid species within the Achillea millefolium polyploid complex (Asteraceae-Anthemideae). It is
morphologically intermediate between the relic diploids, A. setacea-2x in xeric and A. asplenifolia-2x in humid habitats,
and often grows in close contact with either of them. By analyzing DNA sequences of two single-copy nuclear genes
and the genomic AFLP data, we assess the allopolyploid origin of A. collina-4x from ancestors corresponding to A.
setacea-2x and A. asplenifolia-2x, and the ongoing backcross introgression between these diploid progenitor and
tetraploid progeny lineages.
Results: In both the ncpGS and the PgiC gene tree, haplotype sequences of the diploid A. setacea-2x and A. asplenifolia2x group into two clades corresponding to the two species, though lineage sorting seems incomplete for the PgiC
gene. In contrast, A. collina-4x and its suspected backcross plants show homeologous gene copies: sequences from the
same tetraploid individual plant are placed in both diploid clades. Semi-congruent splits of an AFLP Neighbor Net link
not only A. collina-4x to both diploid species, but some 4x individuals in a polymorphic population with mixed ploidy
levels to A. setacea-2x on one hand and to A. collina-4x on the other, indicating allopolyploid speciation as well as
hybridization across ploidal levels.
Conclusions: The findings of this study clearly demonstrate the hybrid origin of Achillea collina-4x, the ongoing
backcrossing between the diploid progenitor and their tetraploid progeny lineages. Such repeated hybridizations are
likely the cause of the great genetic and phenotypic variation and ecological differentiation of the polyploid taxa in
Achillea millefolium agg.
Background
According to the genealogical species concept, species
are defined as multi-locus "genotypic clusters" that
remain distinct even in the presence of gene flow among
each other [1-3]. "Hybridization is thus a normal feature
of species biology" [1]. Hybridization and its results, e.g.,

introgression, segregation of new types without backcrossing, and allopolyploidy, have long been speculated
as major forces behind "evolutionary bursts" [4]. Indeed,
plant species and populations arisen from hybridization
and polyploidy often exhibit more complicated patterns
of variation than their progenitors, i.e., their diploid sister
groups, and are ecologically divergent, presumably under
local selection. Furthermore, when gene flow is present
between the diverged progenies or between the parental
and daughter lineages, the genetic and phenotypic com-

plexity of the populations could be enhanced. All these
processes may increase species diversity and obliterate
discrete separation lines between otherwise diverged taxa
as observed in many angiosperm polyploid complexes [49].
Achillea millefolium agg. (Asteraceae-Anthemideae) is
a highly polymorphic but clearly monophyletic polyploid
species complex or aggregate. It is composed of outbreeding hemicryptophytic perennials widely distributed over
the N Hemisphere. Five to seven diploid and 10-30 polyploid taxa can be defined in this complex [10,11]. Autopolyploidy has been documented in the N American
populations, which serve as textbook examples for plant
ecotypic differentiation [12,13]. Most of the Eurasian
polyploids, ranging from tetra- to octoploids, are either
derived from primary hybridization between diploid progenitors or may be products of secondary introgression
on the same or on different ploidy levels. This has created
complex genetic and phenotypic variation patterns
within A. millefolium agg. [14-18]. The relationships of
the diploid species conform to a tree structure, whereas
most of the polyploid taxa exhibit complex and reticulate
relationships with each other and with the diploid species
[11,19].
Achillea collina is a widely distributed tetraploid member of A. millefolium agg. in Europe. It is morphologically
intermediate between the relic diploids, A. setacea-2x in
xeric and A. asplenifolia-2x in humid habitats, and often
grows in close contact with either of them [14]. Cytogenetic analyses and crossing experiments of A. asplenifolia
and A. setacea have resulted in F1 and F2 generations with
reduced vitality and fertility. Thus, the two diploid species are separated by considerable intrinsic barriers. From
their diploid F2 hybrid progeny, several spontaneous allotetraploid individuals could be obtained. They were morphologically quite similar to the wild species A. collina4x, fertile, and could be crossed with the latter [14]. Previous AFLP analyses have suggested A. setacea-2x and A.
asplenifolia-2x as the most likely progenitors of A. collina-4x [19]. In the Austrian province of Burgenland,
south of Vienna, we found several natural hybrid swarms
where either morphologically "typical" A setacea-2x or
"typical" A. asplenifolia-2x come into contact with A. collina-4x. We suspect some 4x plants in these hybrid zones
to be products of backcrosses from A. setacea-2x or A.
asplenifolia-2x via unreduced egg cells to their assumed
daughter species A. collina-4x. Clarification of genetic
relationships of these diploid and tetraploid individuals
and populations should improve our understanding of
the enormous species diversity and the complex patterns
of variation in A. millefolium agg..
To resolve reticulate relationships and recent radiation,
single- or low-copy nuclear genes are preferable because
i) they can provide co-dominant molecular markers for

Page 2 of 11

identifying hybridization and/or introgressive events, ii)
they often provide multiple unlinked loci with fast evolving introns, and are thus more informative than the plastid DNA, iii) such low-copy nuclear loci are less
susceptible than ribosomal genes to gene conversion,
which can reduce or eliminate allelic heterozygosity. The
major problem in utilizing low-copy nuclear genes is to
distinguish orthologs from paralogs. Only with orthologs,
phylogenetic interpretations make sense [20-22]. In addition, PCR-recombination can also be a problem when
sequencing nuclear genes, especially from polyploid
genomes. When two partially homologous templates
exist in one PCR reaction, an in vitro chimera could be
formed from the non-identical templates. This can happen when amplifying members of multigene families or
any locus from polyploid genomes [23,24]. By optimizing
PCR conditions, the frequency of PCR recombination
can be reduced [24]. Nevertheless, data should be interpreted cautiously to avoid biased evolutionary interpretations due to artificially recombinant molecules [23].
With large numbers of markers, the AFLP method can
help to obtain genome-wide perspectives about populations under processes influencing the entire genome,
such as gene flow and genetic drift. Therefore, this is a
powerful tool in recognizing hybridization events
[19,25,26].
Here we use sequences of two single-copy nuclear
genes, the chloroplast-expressed glutamine synthase gene
(ncpGS) and the cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase
gene (PgiC) as well as AFLP data to demonstrate allopolyploid speciation and ongoing hybrid introgression by
backcrossing between diploid progenitor and tetraploid
progeny lineages in Achillea millefolium agg..

Results
Genealogical relationships based on the nuclear gene
sequences

Amplifications for both the ncpGS and the PgiC locus
yielded a single band from each individual sample. The
ncpGS haplotype sequences of the 2x individuals and
populations group into two clades corresponding to the
two diploid species (Fig. 1a), thus clearly belong to a set of
single-copy orthologs. The PgiC gene tree does not completely correspond to the divergence of the diploid species (Fig. 2a). This can be attributed to incomplete sorting
of two ancestral PgiC alleles in Achillea millefolium agg.
(Fig. 2c) or to introgression (for detailed interpretation,
see the "Discussion"). Therefore, all the PgiC sequences
studied here also belong to one orthologous gene lineage.
The original complete ncpGS data matrix contains 327
sequences (clones) from 60 individuals of 14 studied populations and the outgroup A. ligustica. The final ncpGS
gene tree (Fig. 1b) was built on 80 consensus sequences
ranging in length from 873 to 921 bps. The alignment

contains 971 nucleotide positions, of which 869 (195 in
exon and 666 in intron regions) were included in the phylogenetic analysis containing 151 parsimony-informative
characters.
The original complete PgiC data set contains 252
sequences (clones) from the same 59 out of 60 individuals
analyzed for the ncpGS locus. The final PgiC gene tree
(Fig. 2b) was built on 109 consensus sequences ranging in
length from 1619 to 1674 bps. The alignment contains
1720 nucleotide positions, of which 1579 (646 in exon
and 933 in intron regions) were included in the phylogenetic analysis containing 127 parsimony-informative
characters.
A heuristic search retained 8700 equally most parsimonious (MP) trees (tree length = 403, CI = 0.4491, RI =
0.8649) from the 80 consensus ncpGS sequences and
7840 MP trees (tree length = 508, CI = 0.3484, RI =
0.8909) from the 109 consensus PgiC sequences. Topologies of the MP and NJ trees were broadly similar. Figs. 1
and 2 show the 50% majority rule consensus MP trees.
Internal node supports (Bootstrap Percentages) from
both MP and NJ methods were presented on the trees.
Phylogenetic analyses were first conducted for the diploid species only (Figs. 1a &2a). Rooted by the Central
Mediterranean Achillea ligustica-2x, each of the gene
trees contains two well supported clades: clade I corresponds to A. setacea-2x in both gene trees, and clade II in
the ncpGS tree to A. asplenifolia-2x only, whereas in the
PgiC tree, subclade IIa (haplotype group A2) contains
sequences not only of A. asplenifolia-2x, but also a few of
A. setacea-2x (populations SeAA and GS from Anatolia
and Greece). We interpret the haplotype group A2
orthologous to A1 and A3, and designate A1 and A2 as
polymorphic alleles of the PgiC gene from the ancestral
lineage of A. millefolium agg. (more in the "Discussion"
part).
In contrast to the diploid individuals and populations,
the tetraploid A. collina and its suspected backcross
hybrids in the polymorphic "mixed" populations show
homeologous copies at both ncpGS and PgiC loci. In
most cases, different sequences from the same tetraploid
individual plant were placed in different diploid clades
(Figs. 1b &2b; Additional files 1 and 2: Figs. S1 & S2).
AFLP split network

Three primer pairs generated a total of 273 clear and
unambiguous AFLP bands from 93 individuals of eight
populations. Out of the 273 bands, 245 (89.7%) were
polymorphic. The 4x-accessions have more bands (average 127.1 bands per individual) than the 2x ones (average
115.6 bands per individual in A. asplenifolia-2x and 114.2
in A. setacea-2x). Thirty-seven differences of 4386 phenotypic comparisons were observed based on the 17 replicated individuals, thus the error rate is 0.84%. Fig. 3

Discussion
Achillea setacea and A. asplenifolia are two diploid species of the monophyletic A. millefolium agg. [11,19]. They
represent two extremes of morphological and ecological
differentiation within this species aggregate, the former
hairy, small, and adapted to xeric steppe environments,
the latter tall, glabrous, and adapted to undisturbed wet
environments. Achillea setacea-2x is sporadically distributed from NE Anatolia and SE Europe to the Balkans,
Hungary, Slovakia, Moravia, Austria and interior valleys
of the Alps, and in the north to S Poland, E Germany and
the N Czech Rep; whereas, A. asplenifolia-2x occurs
locally from Bulgaria and Hungary to E Austria and the
southern Czech Republic [10,11,27]. In the ncpGS gene
tree, haplotype sequences of A. setacea-2x and A. asplenifolia-2x group well into two clades corresponding to the
two species (Fig. 1a), the PgiC gene tree, however, does
not completely correspond to the divergence of the diploid species (the subclade IIa of Fig. 2a inclues both A.
asplenifolia-2x and A. setacea-2x) (Fig. 2a). Our data
clearly show that both the ncpGS and PgiC genes are single-copy in Achillea millefolium agg.. To explain the partial incongruence of the PgiC gene tree with the
divergence of the diploid species (Fig. 2a), two interpretations can be put forward: i) incomplete sorting of ancestrally polymorphic alleles, or ii) of introgression during
secondary contact of the two diploid species. Considering
the current allelic distribution, the former interpretation
is more likely as shown below.
Assuming incomplete lineage sorting (Fig. 2c) [28],
allele A2 might have been retained from an ancestor of A.
millefolium agg. in some populations of the extant A. setacea (the Greek and Anatolia populations, GR and SeAA)
and in A. asplenifolia, but was apparently lost during the
migration of A. setacea to the north and the west, e.g., in
the Ukrainean and Austrian populations (K4 and NS1).
Allele A3, which appears in A. asplenifolia, could have
arisen from A2 after the divergence of this species in the
Pannonian area, where it has survived locally in lowland
areas in Hungary, Bulgaria, Austria, and Moravia (Figs. 2a
&2c).
Alternatively, one could also assume subclade IIa of Fig.
2a (A2) to be the result of hybrid introgression from A.

A. collina-4x

Figure 3 Neighbor Net derived from 273 AFLP bands of 93 individuals from eight populations of the two diploid progenitor lineages Achillea setacea-2x and A. asplenifolia-2x, the allotetraploid A. collina-4x and backcross individuals. Node labels include taxa abbreviations (asp =
A. asplenifolia-2x, set = A. setacea-2x, col = A. collina-4x) and population codes.

asplenifolia-2x into A. setacea-2x. This is unlikely considering the current geographic distribution of the two diploid species and the occurrence of allele A2 among
populations of A. setacea-2x (only in its south-eastern
populations, SeAA and GR, that grow outside the distribution area of A. asplenifolia-2x). However, the refugia of
the two species may have been in closer proximity in SE
Europe during the ice-ages, and they may have hybridized
there. If so, allele A2 must have been lost from A. setacea2x during its northward migration. But this scenario is
again unlikely because there are no signs of hybrid introgression between A. asplenifolia-2x and A. setacea-2x
throughout the Pannonian area, where they often occur
in close proximity. A clear separation of the two diploid
species is also strongly suggested by the ncpGS gene tree
(Fig. 1a). Thus, we assume that two PgiC alleles A1 and
A2 existed already in the ancestral lineage and may have
been sorted incompletely after the divergence of A.
asplenifolia and A. setacea, while allele A3 has arisen
within A. asplenifolia after its species separation (Fig. 2c).

In contrast to the clear genetic and morphological separation of Achillea setacea-2x and A. asplenifolia-2x, A.
collina-4x is morphologically intermediate between these
two diploid species and also linked by intermediates to
other 4x-taxa of A. millefolium agg.. Unlike the two relic
diploid species, A. collina-4x has widely expanded in various mesic and open vegetation types from SE and E to C
Europe and is much more aggressive in disturbed habitats. From experimental crosses between A. asplenifolia2x and A. setacea-2x, synthetic allotetraploid and A. collina-like plants were produced and successfully backcrossed to natural A. collina-4x [14]. These early results
were supported by AFLP analyses which showed that
species-specific bands of the two diploids are combined
in A. collina-4x [19].
The present sequence data from single-copy nuclear
genes ncpGS and PgiC (Figs. 1, 2) demonstrate that all the
haplotype sequences of the diploid individuals or populations are grouped corresponding to the two species,
Achillea setacea-2x and A. asplenifolia-2x respectively. In
contrast, sequences of nearly all populations and many

Ma et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/100

individuals of A. collina-4x (and its suspected 4x-hybrids)
are placed among both the diploid Achillea setacea and A.
asplenifolia clades. Therefore, homeologs of the nuclear
single-copy genes in A. collina-4x demonstrate its allotetraploid origin. Additional evidence for this conclusion
comes from the AFLP Neighbor Net (Fig. 3). That many
of the A. collina-4x individuals (in the PgiC gene tree,
most individuals) harbor homoeologous gene copies
(Additional file 1 &2: Figs. S1 & S2) suggests at least
partly disomic inheritance of this tetraploid species. Its
diploid progenitors must have been closely related to the
extant A. setacea-2x and A. asplenifolia-2x, and probably
have differentiated in SE Europe. Their hybridization and
the origin of an allotetraploid progeny may have taken
place in the Pannonian region, where their distribution
areas still overlap.
With the establishment of A. collina-4x, a first cycle of
hybridization and differentiation was completed. But was
the further expansion of this young allotetraploid species
accompanied by complete isolation from or by continued
backcrossing with its diploid progenitor lineages? Earlier
experiments of crossing 2x- and 4x-taxa of the A. millefolium agg. never have produced 3x-hybrids but can occasionally gave rise to 4x-progeny via unreduced egg cells
from the 2x side [14]. Such unreduced gametes occur frequently in A. millefolium agg. [29]. In Burgenland, Austria, populations of A. setacea-2x, A. asplenifolia-2x and
A. collina-4x grow in two areas about 4 km apart: southeast of Rust and St. Margarethen (see Additional file 3,
Table S1 for population sampling information). Ongoing
gene flow may exist among their populations: Polymorphic populations M1 and M2 with mixed ploidal levels of
2x and 4x were found in disturbed grassland surrounding
the morphologically more typical A. setacea-2x population NS1 on natural steppe islands near St. Margarethen,
whilst NS1 itself also contains a few phenotypically intermediate 4x-plants. Similarly, at the outer border zone of
lake Neusiedlersee near Rust, in contact zones between
A. asplenifolia-2x in natural humid meadows and A. collina-4x from adjacent disturbed grassland, 4x-plants with
intermediate phenotype were found in populations R1,
R2 and NS2 (see Additional file 3, Table S1 for population
sampling information). Our study, especially the AFLP
network (Fig. 3), suggests these 4x-plants result from
backcrosses of the 2x-taxa to A. collina-4x via unreduced
female gametes. The possibility of reverse gene flow from
4x to 2x will need a further critical study.
There are several other examples for ongoing hybridization between taxa on different ploidy levels in Achillea:
A contact zone between A. asplenifolia-2x and A. collina4x, comparable to the one in Austria, was studied in W
Hungary [30]. A. virescens is an allo-4x-species, which
has arisen from hybridization between A. collina-4x and
A. nobilis-2x. Its backcrossing with A. collina-4x has been

Page 7 of 11

demonstrated in NE Italy [18]. The yellow flowering SEEuropean A. clypeolata-2x has formed an extensive 4xhybrid swarm with A. collina-4x in Bulgaria [19,31]. In
addition, natural and experimental crosses between A.
collina-4x and A. millefolium-6x are quite successful; via
semifertile 5x-F1, aneuploid-F2 and backcrosses they rapidly produce normal euploid 4x or 6x progeny and support gene flow between the two ploidy levels [32].

Conclusions
Combining all molecular and cytogenetic data [[1114,19,29], etc.], we conclude that most of the polyploid
taxa in Achillea millefolium agg. are allopolyploids or at
least more or less strongly influenced by hybridization.
Polyploid taxa often occur in close contact with each
other and with diploids. This not only makes hybridization between polyploid taxa at the same ploidy level
omnipresent, but facilitates introgression between taxa
on different ploidy levels. Introgression of genetic material into diploid taxa, either from other diploid taxa or
from polyploids, however, seems rare. Hybrid swarms
common in natural zones of contacts between different
taxa lead to the great genetic and ecological differentiation and variation of the polyploid taxa in the A. millefolium species complex.
Methods
Plant materials

For the present study, 14 populations of A. millefolium
agg. were sampled (see Additional file 3, Table S1 for
sampling information on taxa and populations): three of
Achillea asplenifolia-2x (BZ, Ta, NS2, where NS2 contains a few individuals probably being A. asplenifolia x
collina), three of A. collina-4x (SG, KWC, M3), four of A.
setacea-2x (SeAA, GR, K4, NS1, where NS1 contains a
few tetraploid individuals defined as A. setacea x collina),
and four polymorphic "mixed" populations (R1, R2, M1,
M2, where "pure" 2x-taxa occur together with suspected
hybrids, forming an array of interspecific recombinations). For the AFLP analysis, the highly polymorphic
populations (R1, R2, M1, M2, M3) were left out due to
band complications in a trial experiment. Also excluded
from the AFLP genotyping was the single-individual
accession of A. setacea from Greece (GR). For rooting the
gene trees, the uniform C-Mediterranean species A.
ligustica-2x was used as outgroup. This is a basal species
in A. sect. Achillea and sister to A. millefolium agg.
[19,33].
Chromosome counts and DNA ploidy level determinations were conducted for the populations and individuals
in this study (see Additional file 3, Table S1 for ploidy
level information on each population). Young flower buds
were used for chromosome counting following standard
methods and DNA ploidal levels were investigated by

Ma et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:100

means of propidium iodide flow cytometry [34,35] from
silica gel dried leaves.
DNA extraction

Total genomic DNA was extracted from ca. 0.02 g silica
gel desiccated leaf materials following the 2x CTAB protocol [36] with slight modifications: Before the normal
extraction process, sorbitol washing buffer was used to
remove polysaccharides in the leaf materials (add 800 Î¼L
sorbitol buffer to the ground leaf powder T incubate the
sample in ice for 10 min. T centrifuge at 10,000 g for 10
min at 4Â°C T add 700 Î¼L warm 2x CTAB extraction buffer
and then follow the established 2x CTAB protocol).
PCR, cloning and sequencing of the single-copy nuclear
genes

We sequenced two single-copy loci, the chloroplastexpressed glutamine synthase gene (ncpGS) and the cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase gene (PgiC), both having
a clear molecular evolutionary background and studied in
other eudicots [37-45].
The ncpGS gene contains 12 exons and 11 introns [37].
The region from exon 7 to 11 was amplified and
sequenced. Exon-primed amplifications were performed
using specific primers GS-f and GS-r designed for Achillea (Table 1), or in some cases, amplification was first
conducted with a universal primer pair GScp687f and
GScp994r [40] followed by nested PCR with the Achilleaspecific primers.
The PgiC gene contains 23 exons and 22 introns [41].
The region from exon 11 to 21 was amplified and
sequenced. Exon-primed amplifications were performed
using Achillea-specific primers PgiC-11F and PgiC-21R
(Table 1), or in a few cases, first with universal primers
AA11F and yamv [45] and then by nested PCR using the
Achillea-specific primers.
The amplification reaction was carried out in a volume
of 20 Î¼L containing 2 Î¼L 10x PCR buffer, 0.5 U exTaq

Page 8 of 11

(TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) or HiFi (TransTaq DNA polymerase High Fidelity, TransGen Biotech), 200 Î¼M of each
dNTP, 0.2 Î¼L DMSO, 0.5 Î¼M of each primer, 1 Î¼L template DNA, and ddH2O added to the final volume. The
amplification was conducted on a Peltier thermocycler
(Bio-RAD) with the following cycling scheme: 5 min at
94Â°C; 30 cycles of 1 min at 94Â°C, 30 s at 50Â°C, and 1.5 min
at 72Â°C; a 15 min extension at 72Â°C; and a final hold at
4Â°C. The PCR products were electrophoresed on and
excised from 1.0% agarose gel in TAE buffer. They were
then purified using DNA Purification kit (TianGen Biotech or TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The purified
PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T vector with a
Promega Kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA).
About 3-5 clones from each diploid and 5-15 from each
tetraploid individual with the right insertion were randomly selected for sequencing. The plasmid was
extracted with an Axyprep Kit (Axygene Biotechnology,
Hangzhou, China). Cycle sequencing was conducted
using ABI PRISMÂ® BigDyeâ¢ Terminator and vector primers T7/Sp6. In the case of PgiC gene, a third Achillea-specific internal primer PgiC-14F (Table 1) was used to
sequence the entire ~1.7 kb-fragment. The sequenced
products were run on an ABI PRISMâ¢ 3700 DNA
Sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems).
AFLP genome scan

AFLP profiles were generated following established procedures [46] and PE Applied Biosystems [47]. Total
genomic DNA was digested with MseI and EcoRI. Preselective amplifications were performed using primer pairs
with single nucleotides, MseI-C and EcoRI-A, and selective amplifications using three primer combinations,
MseI-CAG/EcoRI-ACT (FAM), MseI-CTT/EcoRI-ACC
(NED) and MseI-CAG/EcoRI-AGG (HEX). The fluorescence-labeled selective amplification products were run
in a 4.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel with the ABI
Prism 377 Sequencer. Repeated restriction, amplification,

and run of bands of a subset of samples (2-3 individuals
per population) indicated reliability of the present AFLP
data. In total, 17 individuals were used for error rate estimation [48]. Bands were scored with Genographer (version 1.6, Â©Montana State University, 1998; http://
hordeum.oscs.montana.edu/genographer/) in a size
range from 50 ~ 500 bp. To avoid ambiguities, only bands
with sufficient florescent intensity were scored and used
as markers for analyses.
Data analyses

Sequences were assembled with the ContigExpress program (Informax Inc. 2000, North Bethesda, MD), aligned
with ClustalX 1.81, and then manually improved with
BioEdit version 7.0.1. Singletons were identified via
DnaSP ver. 4.10.9 [49]; they mostly could be due to PCR
artefacts rather than reflect natural variability [50] and
were not included in the data analyses. Majority-rule
consensus sequences for clones [51] were constructed
following a two-step strategy: First, the original data
matrix was imported to the software DAMBE (Data
Analysis in Molecular Biology and Evolution) [52] so that
multiple sequences belonging to the same haplotype were
combined into one, and the thus retained data set was
used for an initial phylogenetic analyses; second, following the initial phylogenetic analysis, the number of
sequences was further reduced by eliminating some suspected PCR-recombinant sequences (see Additional file
4) and by combining several polytomic haplotypes into
one. Such retained data set of consensus sequences was
used for the final phylogenetic analyses. These consensus
sequences are labeled by the population codes and the
number (amount) of individuals and clones (Figs. 1 &2).
Those used as consensus sequences were deposited in the
NCBI GenBank under accession numbers FJ434254FJ434336.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed separately on
the PgiC and the ncpGS data sets with PAUP* version
4.0b10a using both Maximum Parsimony (MP) and
Neighbor Joining (NJ) methods. All nucleotide substitutions were equally weighted. Gaps were treated as missing data. For the MP method, heuristic searches were
performed using 1000 random taxon addition replicates
with ACCTRAN optimization and TBR branch swapping. Up to 10 trees with scores larger than 10 were saved
per replicate. The stability of internal nodes of the MP
tree was assessed by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates
(MulTrees option in effect, TBR branch swapping and
simple sequence addition). The NJ analysis was conducted with Kimura's 2-parameter distances [53] and
bootstrapped with 1000 replicates.
Earlier reconstruction of the phylogeny of Achillea
millefolium agg. using AFLP data showed that only the
relationships of the diploid taxa conform to a bifurcating
tree. Inclusion of the polyploid taxa, however, destabilizes

Page 9 of 11

the tree to such an extent that the distinctness of related
groups becomes blurred [11,19]. Phylogenetic networks
should be preferred over phylogenetic trees when reticulate events are to be expected as is the case here [54].
Therefore, the present AFLP data were analyzed using
the Neighbor-Net method [55] with uncorrected p-distances embedded in SplitsTree4. In the network, parallel
edges represent splits of taxa/populations, while nodes
that connect incompatible splits often represent taxa/
populations with hybrid origin (though conflicting signals could also be caused by homoplasy or methodological artifacts) [54].

homologous templates exist. We further briefly discuss the methods to
avoid such artefact in experiments and to identify PCR-recombinant
sequences in data analysis.
