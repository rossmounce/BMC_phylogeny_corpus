Abstract
Background: Saliva of adult female mosquitoes help sugar and blood feeding by providing enzymes and
polypeptides that help sugar digestion, control microbial growth and counteract their vertebrate host hemostasis
and inflammation. Mosquito saliva also potentiates the transmission of vector borne pathogens, including
arboviruses. Culex tarsalis is a bird feeding mosquito vector of West Nile Virus closely related to C. quinquefasciatus,
a mosquito relatively recently adapted to feed on humans, and the only mosquito of the genus Culex to have its
sialotranscriptome so far described.
Results: A total of 1,753 clones randomly selected from an adult female C. tarsalis salivary glands (SG) cDNA library
were sequenced and used to assemble a database that yielded 809 clusters of related sequences, 675 of which
were singletons. Primer extension experiments were performed in selected clones to further extend sequence
coverage, allowing for the identification of 283 protein sequences, 80 of which code for putative secreted proteins.
Conclusion: Comparison of the C. tarsalis sialotranscriptome with that of C. quinquefasciatus reveals accelerated
evolution of salivary proteins as compared to housekeeping proteins. The average amino acid identity among
salivary proteins is 70.1%, while that for housekeeping proteins is 91.2% (P < 0.05), and the codon volatility of
secreted proteins is significantly higher than those of housekeeping proteins. Several protein families previously
found exclusive of mosquitoes, including only in the Aedes genus have been identified in C. tarsalis. Interestingly, a
protein family so far unique to C. quinquefasciatus, with 30 genes, is also found in C. tarsalis, indicating it was not a
specific C. quinquefasciatus acquisition in its evolution to optimize mammal blood feeding.

Background
Most adult female mosquitoes are hematophagous, in
addition to taking sugar meals. Saliva helps blood feeding by interfering with host reactions that could disrupt
the blood flow, assists sugar meals with glycosidases,
and contain antimicrobials that may control microbial
growth in their meals [1]. With the advent of tissue
transcriptomics, we can postulate that these functions
are mediated by large numbers (70-100) of polypeptides,
many of which are expressed solely in the adult female
salivary glands [2]. Unique protein families have been
found in Anopheles, Aedes or Culex mosquitoes, as well
as a group of common proteins or enzymes [3-5]. Functional characterization of these proteins uncovers

scavengers of biogenic amines [6,7] or leukotrienes [8],
inhibitors of blood clotting [9-11], bradykinin formation
[12,13], platelet aggregation [14,15] and vasodilators
[16,17]. Other molecularly uncharacterized activities
include inhibitors of mast cell TNF production [18] and
inhibition of T cell activation [19,20]. It is apparent that
the complexity of the salivary components affecting host
hemostasis and inflammation mirrors the complexity of
host hemostasis and inflammation itself, which must be
disarmed for successful blood feeding. Indeed mosquitoes lacking salivation by salivary duct ablation feed less
and take more dangerous time of exposure to their
hosts [21,22].
Perhaps due to the potent pharmacological activities
of saliva, or the immune reactions to it, mosquito saliva
also plays a role in pathogen transmission, including in
arboviral transmission [23-25]. Accordingly, determination of the salivary composition of vector mosquitoes

not only discovers new potentially pharmacologically
active molecules, but also can also help generating vaccine targets for disruption of arboviral transmission.
These proteins may also be of epidemiological significance as selective human or animal markers of vector
exposure [26-29].
We have previously described the sialotranscriptome
of C. quinquefasciatus [5], where several unique protein
families were discovered, many of which are products of
gene duplications. Indications of horizontal gene transfer
from bacteria to mosquitoes were also pointed out as
participating in the generation of mosquito sialomes
[3,4]. To this date, no other sialotranscriptome from a
member of the Culex genus has been described. We
currently portray the sialotranscriptome of Culex tarsalis, a North American bird feeding mosquito [30], and,
like C. pipiens, a good vector of West Nile virus [31].

Results and Discussion
Characteristics of the assembled salivary EST set

A total of 1,753 cDNA clones were used to assemble a
database (Additional file 1, Table S1) that yielded 809
clusters of related sequences, 675 of which contained
only one expressed sequence tag (EST). The 809 clusters
were compared, using the programs BlastX, BlastN, or
RPSBLAST [32], to the nonredundant protein database
of the National Center of Biological Information
(NCBI), to a gene ontology database [33] to the conserved domains database of the NCBI [34], and to a custom prepared subset of the NCBI nucleotide database
containing either mitochondrial or rRNA sequences.
Three categories of expressed genes derived from the
manual annotation of the contigs (Fig 1). The putatively
secreted (S) category contained 44% of the sequences,
the housekeeping (H) category had 36.3% and 19.7% of
the ESTs could not be classified and belong to the
Unknown (U) class. The transcripts of the unknown
class could represent novel proteins or derive from the
less conserved 3’ or 5’ untranslated regions of genes, as
was indicated for the sialotranscriptome of An. gambiae
[3]. This distribution is typical of previous mosquito sialotranscriptomes [4,5,35-37].
Housekeeping (H) genes

The 637 ESTs attributed to H genes expressed in the
salivary glands of C. tarsalis were further characterized
into 19 subgroups according to function (Table 1 and
Additional file 1, Table S1). Transcripts associated with
the protein synthesis machinery represented 44% of all
transcripts associated with a housekeeping function, an
expected result for the secretory nature of the organ.
Nineteen percent of the transcripts were classified as
either “Unknown conserved” or “Conserved secreted
proteins”. These represent highly conserved proteins of
unknown function, presumably associated with cellular

function, but still uncharacterized. These sets may help
functional identification of the “Conserved hypothetical”
proteins as previously reviewed in [38]. Transporters
accounted for 7% and included several members of the
vacuolar ATPase machinery, important for mosquito
salivary secretion [39]. Energy metabolism and protein
modification related enzymes accounted for nearly 5%
each of the transcripts of the H class.
Possibly secreted (S) class of expressed genes

A total of 771 ESTs represent putative C. tarsalis salivary components (Tables 2 and Additional file 1, Table
S1). These include ubiquitous known gene families, e.g,
families seen in other organs and organisms, as well as
protein families unique to hematophagous Diptera, or to
Culicines, or to Culex genus alone. Table 2 also indicates our degree of knowledge, or ignorance, regarding
these protein families, 15 of which we have no hint for
their function, more than half of the 24 classes of proteins represented in Table 2. Many of these putatively
secreted protein families of unknown function are multigenic, such as the CWRP family found previously only
in C. quinquefasciatus [5], which contributes to 58% of
the ESTs associated with the S class in C. tarsalis. The
D7/OBP-like families contribute to 9% of all transcripts
associated with secreted products, which is less than
previously seen in Anopheles or Aedes sialotranscriptomes, probably due to the dilution effect following
abundant expression of the CWRP family.
The salivary secretome of Culex tarsalis

From the sequenced cDNAs, a total of 283 novel C. tarsalis protein sequences were derived, 80 of which code
for putative secreted products (Additional file 2, Table
S2). Because cDNA sequences coding for many of these
proteins were found as singletons, this secretome is to
be considered preliminary and incomplete, but many

parallels with previous mosquito sialotranscriptomes can
be drawn, as follows:
Proteins with presumed or experimentally validated
function
The D7/Odorant binding protein-like family

The D7 proteins constitute a unique multi gene family
found expressed in the salivary glands of blood sucking
Diptera [40], belonging to the superfamily of Odorant
Binding Proteins (OBP) [41]. Long and short versions
exist, the long versions containing two and the short
versions containing one OBP domain. Three genes
codes for long D7 proteins and 5 genes code for short
D7 proteins in An. gambiae [3], while in Ae. aegypti 2
genes code for long and 3 genes code for short D7 proteins [4]. Short versions of anopheline D7 mosquitoes
were shown to bind biogenic amines such as serotonin
and histamine [6], thus counteracting hemostasis and
inflammation. More recently, the amino terminal OBP
domain of a D7 long form of Ae. aegypti was shown to
bind peptidic leukotrienes with high affinity. The crystal
structures of a short D7 protein from An. gambiae and
a long D7 protein from Ae. aegypti revealed that the D7
OBP domains have 7 alpha helices, 2 more than the
canonical OBP family [7]. In addition to these

inflammatory agonist binding functions, a short D7 protein from An. stephensi, named hamadarin, was shown
to inhibit bradykinin formation by inhibiting the FXII/
Kallikrein pathway [12].
Eight members of the D7 protein family were found in
the C. tarsalis sialotranscriptome, in addition to two
canonical OBP proteins. Alignment of these proteins
with their close blast matches found in the NR protein
database, and construction of a bootstrapped phylogram
(Fig 2) shows several clades with strong bootstrap support, and allows the following inferences: The eight C.
tarsalis proteins are the probable results of 4 genes.
Ctar-34, Ctar-35 and Ctar-36 are possible alleles of a
single gene related to other long C. quinquefasciatus D7
proteins shown in Clade I, while Ctar-37, Ctar-38 and
Ctar-40 are probably alleles of a second C. tarsalis gene
coding for yet another long D7 protein, and are associated within Clade II. Ctar-173, results from a gene
coding for a third long D7 protein grouping in Clade V
with other mosquito long D7 proteins, including, Anopheles and Aedes proteins. Ctar-371 is the only C. tarsalis sequence for a short D7 protein, grouping in clade
IV with other Culex pipiens D7 proteins. Notice also
Clades III and Clade VI, which exclusively contain long
D7 Anopheline or Phlebotomine proteins, respectively.
Ctar-34, Ctar-35, Ctar-37 and Ctar-38 possess the signature [ED]- [EQ]-x(7)-C-x(12,17)-W-x(2)-W-x(7,9)[TS]-x-C- [YF]-x- [KR]-C-x(8,22)-Q-x(22,32)-C-x(2)[VLI] found in lipid binding D7 domain of Ae. aegypti
[8]. The serotonin binding motif found on short anopheline D7 proteins as well as the carboxydomain of the
long D7 protein of A. aegypti [6,7] was not found on
any C. tarsalis D7 protein (nor in any D7 protein of C.
quinquefasciatus - results not shown), indicating this
motif may have evolved beyond recognition, or that
other proteins in Culex may undertake this task (see
below under CWRP heading).
Ctar-195 and Ctar-525 represent 2 canonical OBP
protein sequences, transcripts of which were found
expressed in the salivary glands of C. tarsalis. Homologs
of these canonical OBP proteins were also previously
found expressed in C. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae
sialotranscriptomes. These proteins tend to be much
more conserved in sequence to mosquito and even Drosophila proteins and it is possible that they may play an
endogenous or housekeeping function.
The 30 kDa antigen/GE rich/Aegyptin family

This protein family is typical of the salivary glands of
adult female mosquitoes, and was first identified as a
salivary antigen in Ae. aegypti [42], and later found in
salivary transcriptomes and proteomes of both culicine
and anopheline mosquitoes [4,5,35-37,43,44], where it
was named GE rich protein. Distantly related proteins
also exist in black flies and sand flies. More recently,

proteins of this family from Aedes and Anopheles were
shown to prevent platelet aggregation by collagen
[14,45], indicating conservation of function after the
split of the culicidae into the culicines and anophelines,
approximately 150 MYA [46].
The sialotranscriptome of C. tarsalis allowed the identification of 8 protein sequences from the 30 kDa antigen/Aegyptin family (Additional file 2, Table S2), all
represented by 1-10 ESTs found in the library. Blast
searches against the NR database retrieved closely
related sequences. Those that were more than 95% identical and of the same species were excluded to avoid
inclusion of alleles or very closely related genes. Clustal
alignment of this subset was used to produce a bootstrapped phylogram (Fig 3) that allows the following
inferences: The 8 proteins from C. tarsalis most probably derive from 3 genes, Ctar-49, Ctar-50 and Ctar-51
being probable alleles of a gene closely related to a C.

quinquefasciatus salivary gene shown in Clade I. Clade I
includes Aedes aegypti salivary proteins that are short
versions of the canonical 30 kDa protein, as are all
Culex proteins in this clade. A second C. tarsalis gene
possibly codes for Ctar-103, Ctar-104 and Ctar-105, and
a third gene for Ctar-55 and Ctar-57. These two gene
products groups with strong bootstrap support to their
C. quinquefasciatus homologs, and these in turn group
relatively weakly (48% bootstrap support) in Clade II as
shown in Fig 3. Fig 3 also shows the uniquely Aedes
containing proteins in clade III, represented by pairs of
homologs between Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, and
the uniquely anopheline clade IV, with one sequence
each of 5 different mosquito species. This phylogram
suggests the single gene status of this family in the Anopheles genus, and the multi gene character in Culicines.
At least 3 genes for canonical 30 kDa Ag/Aegyptin
exists in the Aedes genus, and at least one more gene

246 and Ctar-429 encode related protein sequences that
might reflect splice variants of the same gene. These 2
truncated protein sequences have over 60 predicted glycosylation sites, and are similar to a previously described
salivary mucin of C. quinquefasciatus. Ctar-261 is related
to Aedes and Culex mucins that, in the case of the Aedes
protein, were associated with induction by viral infection
suggesting an immune function for this protein with 13
putative glycosylation sites. Ctar-581 encodes a 5’ truncated protein sequence similar to salivary mucins of C.
quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus.

for the shorter protein shown in Clade I. Culex also
have the shorter version gene, plus at least 2 genes of
the canonical type.
Mucins and Peritrofins

Serine and threonine rich proteins are a common finding
in sialotranscriptomes. These proteins are generally modified post-translationally and their mature forms have Nacetyl galactosamine residues, typical of mucins [47].
They probably have a function to lubricate the food
canals and may also have antimicrobial function. Ctar-

Additional file 1, Table S1 indicate the presence of transcripts coding for enzymes possibly associated with the
sugar meal and blood meal. Related to the sugar meal
are several transcripts coding for glycosidases similar to
proteins annotated as maltase and amylase. Additional
file 2, Table S2 provides one full length sequence of a
salivary alpha-glucosidase similar to other Culicine salivary maltases, plus 4 other truncated sequences coding
for different sugar hydrolases. Regarding blood mealrelated enzymes, 4 EST’s coding for fragments of adenosine deaminase were found, as well as for an endonuclease. In C. quinquefasciatus a salivary endonuclease
has been previously characterized and associated with
helping forming the feeding hematoma [48]. However,
the C. tarsalis enzyme is most closely related to sand
flies salivary endonucleases and only distantly related to
the salivary endonuclease of C. quinquefasciatus,
although it is closely related to a non-salivary C. quinquefasciatus enzyme, indicating this C. tarsalis enzyme
may be playing a housekeeping function.
Remarkably absent from the C. tarsalis sialotranscriptome are ESTs coding for members of the 5’ nucleotidase, which functions as the salivary apyrase of
mosquitoes. Apyrase hydrolyzes ATP and ADP to AMP
and orthophosphate, destroying these important agonists
of inflammation and platelet aggregation [2,49]. It has
been previously noticed that C. quinquefasciatus has little salivary apyrase activity when compared to Aedes
and Anopheles mosquitoes, and this observation was
postulated to be a consequence of the lack of platelets
in birds, the most common host of Culex [50], while
Aedes and Anopheles are mostly mammalian feeders
[51]. This may explain the absence of 5’-nucleotidase/
apyrase coding transcripts in C. tarsalis, although an
increased sequencing effort could produce 5’-nucleotidases that might be secreted. As an example of the
abundance of this type of transcript in mosquito sialotranscriptomes, only one transcript out of 503 clones
coded for apyrase in the C. quinquefasciatus sialotranscriptome [5], while 99 out of 4,066 were found in a
similarly made library from An. gambiae, and 66 out of
4,232 ESTs were found in the Ae. aegypti

sialotranscriptome [4]. From these observed frequencies,
the expected number of EST’s for C. tarsalis and C.
quinquefasciatus are 27 and 8, respectively, producing a
Chi square of 54.6 and a P < 0.001, indicating the low
expression of apyrase transcripts in Culex.
Three ESTs coding for a phosphatase produce the
predicted truncated sequence encoded by Ctar-194,
which is similar to a salivary alkaline phosphatase previously described in Ae. aegypti. The function of this
enzyme in feeding, if any, is unknown.
Transcripts coding for at least 6 different serine proteases were found in C. tarsalis sialotranscriptome
(Additional files 1 and 2, Tables S1 and S2). These
enzymes may function in immunity as prophenoloxidase
activators, or in digesting skin matrix components, such
as in an elastase function, or hydrolysing host blood
clotting enzymes such as fibrinogen/fibrin, or activating
plasminogen.
Immunity related products

Antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme, and pathogen pattern
recognition polypeptides are commonly found in the sialotranscriptome of blood sucking arthropods. Additional

file 2, Table S2 shows the full length sequence of C. tarsalis salivary lysozyme, which is 91% identical to the C.
quinquefasciatus homolog, and 75% identical to the salivary homolog of Ae. albopictus. Truncated ORF’s of a
C-type lectin and a Gram-negative binding protein were
also found. They both match previously described salivary proteins of Aedes and Culex.
Secreted proteins with unknown function

Promiscuous Antigen 5 (AG-5) family
This is a ubiquitous protein family found in animals and
plants [52], and in all sialotranscriptomes of blood sucking Diptera analyzed so far. The function of these proteins in mosquito saliva is not known, but in blood
sucking Brachycera two proteins of this family have
been functionally characterized. Remarkably, in a tabanid fly, a member of the AG-5 family acquired a typical
RGD domain surrounded by Cys residues and acts as a
main platelet aggregation [53], and in the stable fly a
salivary AG-5 protein binds immunoglobulins and may
function as an inhibitor of the classical complement
pathway [54]. We present evidence, in the form of truncated transcripts, for the expression of at least two

Calvo et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:51
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/51

members of the family in C. tarsalis salivary glands;
Ctar-151, assembled from 3 ESTs, matches with 94%
identity the salivary secreted antigen-5 precursor AG5-3
from Culex quinquefasciatus while Ctar-438 matches
with 91% identity another C. quinquefasciatus protein of
the same family.
Insect specific Cys-Rich polypeptide family
Two transcripts were found in the C. tarsalis sialotranscriptome coding for basic (pI = 8.8) peptides of mature
MW of 9.7 kDa containing 12 Cys residues. This peptide family was previously found in the salivary transcriptome of C. quinquefasciatus, but close relatives of
the same size exist in Drosophila, Bombyx, Tribolium
and Apis. The ubiquity of this protein family in insects,
its size and pI suggests an antimicrobial role.
Hematophagous Diptera specific 41.0 kDa family
The first 41.0 kDa family member was characterized in
the sialotranscriptome of Ae. aegypti, and later found in
C. quinquefasciatus and in Ae. albopictus [4,5,36,55].
Although not present in the sialotranscriptomes of
members of the anopheline Cellia subgenus An. funestus, An. stephensi and An. gambiae (including scaning of
the deducted proteome), it was recently found in An.
darlingi, a member of the Nyssorhynchus subgenus [56],
characterizing this family as uniquely Culicidae. Additional file 2, Table S2 provides evidence of a member of
this protein family in C. tarsalis, encoded by Ctar-541,
producing a predicted protein of mature MW of 43
kDa, being 69% identical to its C. quinquefasciatus
homolog. Psiblast of Ctar-541 against the NR protein
database retrieves on its first blastp cycle only mosquito
salivary proteins, as expected. On the second cycle, it
retrieves with lower significance (e value > 0.005) mostly
bacterial proteins, but also salivary proteins from Simulium vittatum and Culicoides sonorensis. Further iterations of Psiblast retrieves with high significance bacterial
proteins of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptor
family (MCP), which may suggest this bacterial family to
be originated from horizontal gene transfer to an ancestral blood feeding Nematocera. The gene structure of
this protein in C. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti is
similar, containing 2 exons with a short intron of ca. 60
nt. Inclusion of Simulium and Culicoides sequences in
this family indicates an ancient origin before the Nematocera split [57].
Mosquito specific 23.4 kda protein
Ctar-345 codes for a protein related to mosquito proteins so far only found expressed in mosquito adult salivary glands. Psiblast of Ctar-345 against the NR
database does not retrieve any additional protein with
an e value better than 0.02.
Mosquito specific hyp37 family
This member of this mosquito salivary protein family
was identified in An. stephensi [35], and later found also

An. gambiae [3], but not previously in other mosquito
transcriptomes, including C. quinquefasciatus and Ae.
aegypti. Ctar-769, represented by a single EST in our
database, codes for a member of this family as indicated
by blastp comparisons to the NR protein database,
where it retrieves only Culex and Anopheles proteins.
Psiblast of Ctar-769 against the NR database does not
increase finding matches beyond additional mosquito
proteins, including proteins deducted from the uncovering of the C. quinquefasciatus genome with and without
signal peptide, and additional proteins from An. gambiae
lacking a signal peptide indicative of secretion. Interestingly, the Anopheles gambiae gene found expressed in
the salivary glands was shown to reside as a single exon
in chromosome arm 2R [3]. The An. gambiae gene was
also found to be selectively expressed in the adult
female salivary glands suggesting a role in blood feeding
[3].
Culicine specific 30.5 kDa family
Members of the 30.5 kDa protein were previously discovered in Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus and C. quinquefasciatus sialotranscriptomes. Additional related proteins
were also deducted from the genomes of Ae. aegypti
and C. quinquefasciatus, but not An. gambiae. The sialotranscriptome of C. tarsalis provides additional evidence for this multi copy family exclusive of Culicines.
Clustal alignment of these protein sequences (Fig 4A)
shows many conserved amino acids and a conserved
Cys framework on the second half of the protein. The
bootstrapped phylogram shows 3 robust clades. Clade I
contains a sub clade of 2 Ae. aegypti and 2 Ae. albopictus proteins, and a second sub clade of a C. quinquefasciatus and Ctar-129. Clade II has 4 C. tarsalis
sequences, possibly alleles of a single gene or closely
related genes, and one C. quinquefasciatus sequence.
Clade III shows a possible gene expansion in C. quinquefasciatus containing 4 gene products, clustering with
one Ae. aegypti sequence. Overall the phylogram indicates that Aedes aegypti has at least 3 genes coding for
this protein family, while C. quinquefasciatus has at
least 6, 3 of which possibly arrived by further gene
duplications within clade III. Culex tarsalis and Ae.
albopictus, have at least two genes expressing these proteins in their adult female salivary glands. Psiblast of
members of this protein family against the NR protein
database converges after 6 iterations, retrieving solely
Aedes and Culex proteins (not shown). The function of
this protein family is unknown, but transcripts for this
family were found enriched in the salivary glands of
adult female Ae. aegypti [4] suggesting a blood feeding
role.
Culicine specific 7.8 kDa family
Ctar-761 codes for a mature peptide of predicted MW =
11.7 kDa and pI = 8.8. It is similar to previously

Calvo et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:51
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/51

described salivary peptides found in sialotranscriptomes
of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, but not Culex. Psiblast
using an inclusion e value of 0.1 (relatively high to compensate for the small size of the sequences) against the
NR protein database additionally identifies a salivary
peptide previously found in C. quinquefasciatus, annotated as 9.7 kDa salivary peptide. Inclusion of this peptide with the previous to generate the reverse position
search model [32] additionally identifies other salivary
peptides from C. quinquefasciatus, with convergence of
the search and identification of the 6 non redundant
peptides with an e value of 8 e-16 or smaller. Alignment
of these 6 peptides with Ctar-761 shows that the Aedes
sequences are more compact than those from Culex,
containing a conserved framework of 6 cysteines, while
those of Culex have 2 additional Cys residues (Fig 5a).
Only 3 other residues are identical in all sequences,
indicating a high evolutionary rate of this peptide family,
if they indeed share a common ancestor. The bootstrapped phylogram (Fig 5B) shows 2 robust clades,
clade I containing only Aedes sequences in two subclades, each containing a pair of Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus sequences. Clade II has 2 sequences from C.
quinquefasciatus. Ctar-761 does not cluster with either
of the clades, indicating again the possible fast evolutionary rate of this peptide family.
Culicine specific 4.2 kDa peptide family
Ctar-146, Ctar-147 and Ctar-208 encode peptides with
similarities to C. quinquefasciatus 4.2 kDa salivary peptide, which has similarity solely to another salivary peptide previously found in Ae. albopictus.
Culex genus specific cysteine and tryptophan rich protein family (CWRP)
This protein family was previously discovered in the C.
quinquefasciatus sialotranscriptome [5], where 10 proteins were deduced from the EST sequences. These have
a signal peptide indicative of secretion, 4 conserved
cysteins, 3 conserved tryptophans and one conserved
asparagine and leucine residues. Inspection of the C.
quinquefasciatus genome indicates a total of 30 genes
coding for this protein family, most (28) members being
single exonic. Expression of these genes in C. quinquefasciatus salivary glands was confirmed by Edman degradation of electrophoretically separated salivary
homogenate [5]. The C. tarsalis sialotranscriptome led
to identification of 6 full length members of this protein
family, plus 14 other fragments. Alignment of the members of this family (Fig 6) shows a conserved cysteine
framework in most members, two conserved tryptophan
residues (in addition to 4 other less conserved tryptophan residues), as well at the conserved asparagine and
leucine residues. This protein family is by far the most
transcribed in C. tarsalis adult female salivary glands,
accounting for 25% of the transcripts that were

Page 8 of 15

sequenced. Interestingly, the most transcribed member
in C. tarsalis, Ctar-1, is a truncated member of the
family by relatively recent acquisition of a stop codon
just after the second conserve Cysteine. This abundant
expression suggests that this family may be responsible
for host serotonin or histamine antagonism, as is performed by the abundantly expressed D7 proteins of
Aedes or Culex. This possibility is further supported by
the relatively low expression of the D7 protein family in
C. tarsalis and their absent serotonin binding motifs
which are found both in Aedes and Anopheles D7 proteins (see above description of the D7 proteins). Psiblast
of members of the CWRP protein family retrieves, interestingly, sugar binding proteins including bacterial glycosidases, lectins such as ricin and hemolysins, the
crystal structure of which have a trefoil structure [58].
The single exon structure of this protein family in C.
quinquefasciatus suggests either acquition of this gene
family by horizontal transfer, and/or gene duplication
occurring by retroposition of an RNA template.
Culex genus specific 9.7 peptide family
Ctar-520 and Ctar-29 encode truncated peptides matching the previously described putative 9.7 kDa salivary
peptide of C. quinquefasciatus, which has no other
matches to known proteins.
Culex genus specific GQP repeat protein family
Ctar-31, Ctar-32 and Ctar-33 produce matches to a low
complexity protein previously described in the C. quinquefasciatus sialome characterized by a poly histidine
repeat in the mature aminoterminal region, and a series
of GQP/GQG repeats. The polyhistidine domain may
confer a bacteriostatic role for this protein if it chelates
Zn ions, a bacterial growth factor, and a domain existing
in various antimicrobial peptides [59-61].
Comparison of protein sequence identities between C.
tarsalis and C. quinquefasciatus gene products

Over 170 deduced protein sequences coding for putative
housekeeping (H) products are presented in Additional
file 2, Table S2. These proteins allow comparison of the
evolutionary rate of the S proteins compared to the H
proteins, using the C. quinquefasciatus proteome as a
reference set, as done before for comparing An. stephensi salivary proteins to those of An. gambiae [35].
For this comparison, we used only protein sequences
from C. tarsalis that had at least 100 AA of alignment
by the blastp tool to a C. quinquefasciatus protein, and
excluded from this set possible alleles or closely related
gene duplications by removing the smaller sequence(s)
that had 80% or more similarity to another one within
the set. We thus compared 50 putative secreted C. tarsalis proteins with their C. quinquefasciatus proteome,
obtaining an average of 70.1% protein identity, while
169 putative housekeeping proteins from C. tarsalis
were 91.2% identical to C. quinquefasciatus predicted

proteins (see Additional file 2, Table S2 worksheets - P
< 0.001 Mann-Whitney rank sum test). This significant
difference further supports the concept that the evolution of mosquito salivary secreted proteins occur at a
faster pace than housekeeping proteins, as indicated
before for anopheline proteins [35,37,56].
It has been suggested that codon volatility (the proportion of the point-mutation neighbors of a codon
that encode different amino acids) could be a measure
of selection for fast evolution of proteins, as could
occur in pathogens in a constant avoidance of antibody
recognition [62]. Although this intuitive idea has created strong opposition [63-65], it is supported by

published models [66,67]. We accordingly decided to
measure the average codon volatility for the 205
sequences coding for housekeeping and 80 sequences
coding for putative secreted proteins shown in Additional file 2, Table S2. The average codon volatility for
the H class genes was 0.7609 + 0.001 while the S class
had an average volatility of 0.7746 + 0.002 (Average +
SE), a highly significant result (P = 6.9 × 10-8 , double
tailed t test). Whatever the discussion regarding the
value of this index, it indicates that a single point
mutation on an S class gene has a significantly higher
chance of producing a non-synonymous amino acid
substitution than in an H class gene.

Conclusions
From a conservative perspective, the sialotranscriptome
of C. tarsalis confirms the presence of ubiquitous salivary mosquito protein families, such as the D7, 41
kDa, hyp37, 30 kDa antigen/Aegyptin, 23.4 kDa,
mucins, cysteine rich peptide, antigen 5, amylase/maltase, and the immunity related proteins lysozyme,
pathogen recognition molecules, and serine proteases
possibly associated with immunity or with host matrix/
fibrin degradation. Adenosine deaminase has also been
found, but not the 5’nucleotidase/apyrase that has
been abundantly found in mammalian feeding mosquitoes, but possibly absent or reduced in the bird feeding
C. tarsalis. From another stand point, the C. tarsalis
sialotranscriptome confirmed the presence of proteins
so far known exclusively in culicine mosquitoes, such
as endonucleases and the 62 kDa, 30.5 kDa, 7.8 kDa
and 4.2 kDa families, all without a known function.
Additionally, further confirmation of unique proteins
of the Culex genus were found for members of the
highly expanded CWRP, 9.7 kDa and the GPQ repeat
families.
It has been previously indicated that many unique
mosquito protein families appear to be related to bacterial proteins, (when using the Psiblast tool against the NR
database) suggesting their acquisition by horizontal
transfer. Interestingly, the genes coding for such proteins, now available for An. gambiae, C. quinquefasciatus
and Ae. aegypti are often single exonic, as is the case of
bacterial genes. In the case of C. tarsalis, this appears to
be the case with the 41 kDa (which have a single short
intron) and the CWRP (mostly uniexonic in C. quinquefasciatus) families. However, other possibilities for single
exonic genes are their acquisition as gene duplication
resulting from retrotransposition of an mRNA precursor
deriving from an endogenous, multi exonic gene. At any
rate, the frequency of the relatively unusual processes of
horizontal transfer and/or retrotransposition in the
acquisition of new genes associated with blood feeding
appear to occur at a high rate in the formation of mosquito sialomes.
Since our transcriptome was based on ~2,000 ESTs
from a non-normalized library, the question arises as to
what extent novel putative secreted proteins can be discovered with a more extensive sequencing, or the use of
a normalized library. As indicated in a recent review
[68], it has been our experience that, perhaps due to
the relatively low complexity of the salivary gland proteome (when compared to organs like the mammalian
liver or brain, for example), 1000-2000 sequenced clones
are enough to display the majority of the sialome.
Indeed, ~2,000 clones sequenced from an Ae. aegypti
salivary gland cDNA library [4] discovered virtually all

Page 11 of 15

those found in another effort that obtained ~20,000
sequences [69]. A similar situation was encountered
with the An. gambiae sialome, where ~4,000 sequences
identified basically all those in a large sequencing effort,
also ~20,000 sequences done by the Pasteur Institute
[3]. Sequencing of normalized libraries, or more intensive sequencing of existing libraries, perhaps with newer
generation of pyrosequencing methodology, may
increase the number of salivary secreted peptides, but
possibly to no more than 10% of the number found
with random sequencing of ~2,000 clones. It should be
indicated, however, that these additional low abundance
transcripts may account for pharmacologically potent
peptides.
Finally, the fast divergence of salivary proteins allows
the possibility of using C. tarsalis proteins as specific
markers of vector exposure, as is being attempted for
ticks [70-72], mosquitoes [26-29] and sand flies [73].

Methods
Mosquitoes and cDNA library construction

Culex tarsalis, strain Bakersfield (Bakersfield, California)
was supplied by Dr. W.K. Riesen University of California-Davis. Colonized mosquitoes were maintained on
mouse blood (for egg laying) and given 10% sucrose ad
libitum. Larvae were reared and adults maintained
under controlled conditions of temperature (27°C),
humidity (70% RH), and light (16:8 L:D diurnal cycle).
PolyA+ RNA was extracted from 80 dissected pairs of
salivary glands using the Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which was then used
to make a non-normalized PCR-based cDNA library
using the SMART™ cDNA library construction kit (BD
Biosciences-Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as described
before [55].
cDNA sequencing

The salivary gland cDNA library was plated on LB/
MgSO4 plates containing X gal/IPTG to an average of
250 plaques per 150 mm Petri plate. Recombinant
(white) plaques were randomly selected and transferred
to 96 well MICROTEST TM U bottom plates (BD BioSciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), containing 100 μl of SM
buffer (0.1 M NaCl; 0.01 M MgSO4; 7 H2 O; 0.035 M
Tris HCl (pH 7.5); 0.01% gelatin) per well. The plates
were covered and placed on a gyrating shaker for 30
min at room temperature. The phage suspension was
either immediately used for PCR or stored at 4°C for
future use.
To amplify the cDNA using a PCR reaction, 4 μl of
the phage sample was used as a template. The primers
were sequences from the l TriplEx2 vector and named
pTEx2 5seq (5/TCC GAG ATC TGG ACG AGC 3/)
and pTEx2 3LD (5/ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG

Calvo et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:51
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/51

CGA ATT GGC 3/), positioned at the 5/end and the 3/
end of the cDNA insert, respectively. The reaction was
carried out in 96 well flexible PCR plates (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) using TaKaRa EX Taq polymerase
(TAKARA Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) on a GeneAmp®
PCR system 9700 (Perkin Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA).
The PCR conditions were: one hold of 95°C for 3 min;
25 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 61°C for 30 sec; 72°C for 5
min. The amplified products were analysed on a 1.5%
agarose/EtBr gel. cDNA library clones were PCR amplified, and the ones showing single band were selected for
sequencing. Approximately 200-250 ng of each PCR
product was transferred to Thermo Fast 96 well PCR
plates (ABgene Corp., Epsom, Surray, UK) and frozen at
-20°C before cycle sequencing. Samples were shipped on
dry ice to the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Genomics
Unit with primer and template combined together in an
ABI 96-well Optical Reaction Plate (P/N 4306737) following the manufacturers recommended concentrations.
Sequencing reactions were setup as recommended by
Applied Biosystems BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit by adding 1 μl ABI BigDye® Terminator
Ready Reaction Mix v3.1 (P/N 4336921), 3 μl 5× ABI
Sequencing Buffer (P/N 4336699), and 2 μl of water for
a final volume of 10 μl. Cycle sequencing was performed
at 96°C for 10 seconds, 50°C for 5 seconds, 60°C for 4
minutes for 27 cycles on either a Bio-Rad Tetrad 2 (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) or ABI 9700 (Applied
Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) thermal cycler. Fluorescently-labeled extension products were purified following Applied Biosystems BigDye® XTerminator™
Purification protocol and subsequently processed on an
ABI 3730xL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.,
Foster City, CA). The AB1 file generated for each sample from the 3730xL DNA Analyzer was provided to
researchers in Rockville, MD through a secure network
drive for all subsequent downstream sequencing analysis. In addition to the sequencing of the cDNA clones,
primer extension experiments were performed in
selected clones to further extend sequence coverage.
Bioinformatic Tools and Procedures

Expressed sequence tags (EST) were trimmed of primer
and vector sequences. The BLAST tool [32], CAP3
assembler [74] and ClustalW [75] software were used to
compare, assemble, and align sequences, respectively.
For assembly of ESTs, a pipeline using blast and the
CAP3 assembler was used, by first blasting all sequences
using blastn with a word size of 36 and feeding the
results as a fasta file to the CAP3 assembler[76]. The
CAP3 parameters were set at default values, with an
overlap length cut off of 40 and percent identity of overlap at 80%. Phylogenetic analysis and statistical neighbor-joining (NJ) bootstrap tests of the phylogenies were
done with the Mega package [77]. For functional

Page 12 of 15

annotation of the transcripts we used the tool BlastX
[32] to compare the nucleotide sequences to the nonredundant (NR) protein database of the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, National Library
of Medicine, NIH,) and to the Gene Ontology (GO)
database [33]. The tool, reverse position specific Blast
(RPSBLAST) [32]was used to search for conserved protein domains in the Pfam [78], SMART [79], Kog [80],
and conserved domains databases (CDD) [81]. We have
also compared the transcripts with other subsets of
mitochondrial and rRNA nucleotide sequences downloaded from NCBI and to several organism proteomes
downloaded from NCBI, ENSEMBL, or VectorBase. Segments of the three-frame translations of the EST
(because the libraries were unidirectional, 6-frame translations were not used), starting with a methionine found
in the first 300 predicted amino acids (AA), or the predicted protein translation in the case of complete coding
sequences, were submitted to the SignalP server [82] to
help identify translation products that could be secreted.
O-glycosylation sites on the proteins were predicted
with the program NetOGlyc [83]. Functional annotation
of the transcripts was based on all the comparisons
above. Following inspection of all these results, transcripts were classified as either Secretory (S), Housekeeping (H) or of Unknown (U) function, with further
subdivisions based on function and/or protein families.
Codon volatility was calculated as previously described
[62].
