A multi gene sequence-based phylogeny of the
Musaceae (banana) family
Pavla Christelová1, Miroslav Valárik1, Eva Hřibová1, Edmond De Langhe2 and Jaroslav Doležel1*

Abstract
Background: The classification of the Musaceae (banana) family species and their phylogenetic inter-relationships
remain controversial, in part due to limited nucleotide information to complement the morphological and
physiological characters. In this work the evolutionary relationships within the Musaceae family were studied using
13 species and DNA sequences obtained from a set of 19 unlinked nuclear genes.
Results: The 19 gene sequences represented a sample of ~16 kb of genome sequence (~73% intronic). The
sequence data were also used to obtain estimates for the divergence times of the Musaceae genera and Musa
sections. Nucleotide variation within the sample confirmed the close relationship of Australimusa and Callimusa
sections and showed that Eumusa and Rhodochlamys sections are not reciprocally monophyletic, which supports
the previous claims for the merger between the two latter sections. Divergence time analysis supported the
previous dating of the Musaceae crown age to the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary (~ 69 Mya), and the evolution of
Musa to ~50 Mya. The first estimates for the divergence times of the four Musa sections were also obtained.
Conclusions: The gene sequence-based phylogeny presented here provides a substantial insight into the course
of speciation within the Musaceae. An understanding of the main phylogenetic relationships between banana
species will help to fine-tune the taxonomy of Musaceae.

Background
The global annual production of bananas and plantains
(Musa spp.) amounts to > 120 Mt [1], making this species one of the world’s most important fruit crops. As
well as their prominence as a dessert fruit, they provide
a vital source of carbohydrates to many inhabitants of
the humid tropics. Musa production, like that of all
crop species, is endangered by a range of pests and diseases, affecting both the yield and quality of the fruit.
While the large-scale commercial plantations can secure
production by frequent applications of fungicide and
pesticide, this form of crop management is increasingly
recognized as environmentally irresponsible. Meanwhile,
smallholders, who together account for at least 85% of
world production, can seldom afford the expense of chemical control, and their crop remains vulnerable to diseases and pests. Improvement of cultivated banana via

breeding is hampered by the absence of sexual reproduction and narrow genetic basis. As a result, attention
has turned to non-cultivated wild relatives as sources of
new genes for banana improvement. This, underlines a
renewed interest to analyze and conserve genetic diversity within Musa spp., which in turn has raised a number of questions related to their taxonomy.
The banana family (Musaceae) has been assigned to
the order Zingiberales in the clade commelinids in the
monocots [2] and has been conventionally divided into
the three genera Musa, Ensete and Musella. The genus
Musa is characterized by a set of morphological descriptors, and has a basic chromosome number (x) of 9, 10
or 11. The genus has been sub-divided into the four sections Eumusa (x = 11; comprising most of the cultivated
species), Rhodochlamys (x = 11), Australimusa (x = 10)
and Callimusa (x = 9, 10) [3,4]. More recently, Argent
[5] added a fifth section, Ingentimusa (x = 7), containing
just a single species M. ingens. However, since this one
species (x = 7) grows within the Australimusa region
(New Guinea), its section-status is not evident when
compared to M. beccarii (x = 9), which grows in the

Callimusa region (Borneo) and remains classified as a
Callimusa.
With the application of DNA-based tools, this conventionally-based taxonomy has become increasingly difficult to justify. Thus, based on RFLP genotyping, Gawel
et al. [6] proposed a merger between Eumusa and Rhodochlamys, a suggestion consistent with nuclear genome
sizes and the distribution of rDNA loci [7], as well as
with the phylogenetic analysis based on the ITS and
organellar DNA [8]. Jarret and Gawel [9] further proposed combining Australimusa and Callimusa into a
single section, a suggestion supported by AFLP genotypes acquired by Wong et al. [10]. However, the results
of AFLP genotyping led Ude et al. [11] to argue that the
conventional taxonomy of Musa was in fact tenable.
The ease of DNA sequencing has revolutionized phylogenetic methodology. The most frequent targets for
this type of analysis have been extra-nuclear DNA i.e.
chloroplast and mitochondrial genes [12-16] and the
internal transcribed spacers (ITS) separating the tandem
organized ribosomal genes in the 45S rDNA locus
[17-19]. The prevalently uniparental mode of inheritance
of the chloroplast and mitochondrion limits to some
extent the usefulness of extra-nuclear sequences, and
moreover, it has been established that this DNA tends
to evolve more slowly than do the nuclear genes, which
presents difficulties in employing it for phylogenetic
purposes [20]. Concerted evolution [21], a bias due to
analyzing a single locus and hidden paralogy all militate
against relying solely on ITS variation for molecular systematics and evolutionary analysis [22,23].
Single and low copy nuclear gene sequences are
thought to provide a higher level of discrimination than
either extra-nuclear genes or ribosomal spacers [24-26].
The lower frequency of informative sites within these
sequences can, however, prevent their use for the resolution of phylogeny both at lower taxonomic levels and
among rapidly diversifying lineages. The greater resolving power of low copy nuclear sequence has been
recently demonstrated in rice [27]. Low copy nuclear
genes also suffer less homoplasy than does ITS [22] and
are seldom subjected to concerted evolution. Intronic
sequence is particularly useful, since the level of selection pressure on its non-coding DNA is relaxed [28].
The major drawback to the use of low copy sequence is
the need to distinguish between paralogs and orthologs.
As yet in the Musaceae family, however, all published
sequence-based phylogenetic studies have targeted
extra-nuclear and/or ribosomal DNA sequence.
The phylogeny of the Musaceae remains controversial.
Typing via organellar and ribosomal DNA has been
employed by Boonruangrod et al. [29,30]. Li et al. [8]
and Liu et al. [31] applied sequence analysis of ribosomal ITS coupled with the chloroplast gene evidence.

More generally, evolutionary relationships within the
monocotyledonous species [32-34] and in the Zingiberales in particular [35,36], have produced date estimates
for the divergence of the Musaceae (61-110 Mya) and
the genus Musa (51 Mya). Based on a study of genome
duplication, Paterson et al. [37] suggested that the divergence of Musa occurred 142 Mya, although this estimate was conceded to require further sequence
information before it could be accepted. Clearly, a more
robust picture of banana phylogeny and divergence time
requires a systematic sampling of gene sequences distributed throughout the genome. Thus, we set out to
clarify main frame of evolutionary relationships within
the Musaceae, and to date the divergence of particular
Musa sections, using a set of single or low copy nuclear
gene sequences.

Methods
Taxon sampling

The sample of Musaceae species included representatives of Musella, Ensete and each of the four Musa sections (Table 1). Strelitzia nicolai Regel et Koern (family
Strelitziaceae, order Zingiberales) was chosen to serve as
an outgroup due to its relatively close relationship to
the Musaceae family and the highest efficiency of amplification of selected gene markers. Sampling of additional
outgroup species was abandoned after a series of preliminary tests, which revealed major difficulties with the
amplification of selected genes (data not shown). In
vitro rooted M. balbisiana ’PKW’ plants were donated
by François Côte (CIRAD, Guadeloupe, French West
Indies) and Musella lasiocarpa plants were purchased
from a commercial nursery. The other entries were
obtained from International Transit Centre (ITC, Catholic University, Leuven, Belgium) in the form of in vitro
rooted plants. All plant materials were maintained in a
greenhouse after their transfer to soil. Leaf tissue of S.
nicolai was provided by Dr. M. Dančák (Palacký University, Olomouc, Czech Republic). Genomic DNA was
extracted from young leaf tissues using Invisorb® Spin
Plant Mini kit (Invitek, Berlin, Germany), following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Target gene selection and primer design

The gene sequences targeted for phylogenetic analysis
were selected from the collection of banana ESTs deposited in GenBank as of March 30, 2009. The threefold
basis for the choice of genes was that they were single
copy, that their genomic locations spanned the entire
genome and that they contained at least one intron.
Genes belonging to the same gene family were avoided.
These criteria were applied by reference to their rice
orthologs, which were identified by BLAST analysis [38],
using a threshold of e-10. To maximize dispersion across

the banana genome, we chose genes whose rice orthologs mapped to different chromosome arms. Gene structure in banana was assumed to be identical to that in
rice. Primers (see Additional File 1) were designed to
amplify intron-spanning gene fragments in the panel of
Musaceae species and S. nicolai, following Lessa [39].
Primers which either failed to amplify or amplified multiple fragments from any one of the 13 Musaceae entries
were discarded. The final set comprised 19 genes (Table
2), sampling each of the rice chromosome arms except
the long arms of chromosomes 4, 5, 11 and 12, and the
short arm of chromosome 12. Nine of the 19 primer
pairs (Table 2) amplified successfully from S. nicolai
template.
Gene fragment amplification, cloning and seqeuncing

A standard amplification protocol was applied to each of
the 19 primer pairs. Each reaction contained 40 ng template, with the PCR program composed of an initial
denaturation step (94°C/5 min), followed by 35 cycles of
94°C/30 s, 57°C/30 s and 72°C/35 s, and ending with an
extension step of 72°C/10 min. Amplicons were treated
with exonuclease/alkaline phosphatase (ExoSAP-IT ® ,
USB, Cleveland, OH, USA) and then either sequenced
directly, or first cloned into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) before sequencing. Cycle sequencing was performed on three independent amplicons per
gene target, using a BigDye ® Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA),
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing
reaction products were purified using a CleanSEQ kit

(Agencourt Bioscience Corp., Beckman Coulter, Beverly,
USA), and then separated on an ABI 3730Xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). All the resulting sequences
have been deposited within GenBank [GenBank:
HM118565-HM118820]. Raw sequence data were
assembled and edited using DNA Baser v2 software
[40]. Consensus sequences were aligned by ClustalW
[41] using default parameters, as implemented in the
MEGA4 software package [42]. Multiple DNA sequence
alignments were inspected and any ambiguously aligned
segments were removed prior to phylogenetic analysis.
Phylogenetic reconstruction

Maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP)
and Bayesian inference (BI) methods were applied to
infer phylogenetic relationships. Sequence gaps were
treated as missing data. Two datasets were considered the first (dataset A) consisted of all 19 gene fragments
across the 13 Musaceae entries, but not S. nicolai, and
the second (dataset B) comprised nine gene fragments
across all the entries. Exonic and intronic sequences
were analyzed separately in a similar fashion. MP and
ML analyses were performed using PAUP* v4.0b software [43]. The most parsimonious tree for each dataset
was found by a heuristic search of 1,000 random
sequence-addition replicates by means of a tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping algorithm.
The strict consensus tree was rooted by S. nicolai as an
outgroup or, where no sequence was obtainable from
this species, by E. ventricosum. Statistical support for
individual nodes was estimated from 1,000 bootstrap

plotting transitions and transversions against pairwise
genetic distance. ML mapping using the quartet puzzling
method [50] was applied to investigate whether the phylogenetic information content of the data was sufficient
for inference purposes. ML mapping was also performed
within TREE-PUZZLE v5.2 software with all possible

BEAST software v1.4.8 software was used to estimate
the divergence times for the major Musaceae clades.
This approach has the advantage of simultaneous estimation of substitution model parameters, topology,
branch lengths and fossil-based date calibration, using
the Bayesian inference and MCMC method. Calibration
was based on the carbon dating of Ensete oregonense
fossil seeds, given as 43 Mya according to Manchester
and Kress [51]. The analysis was conducted over four
independent MCMC runs, each consisting of 1,000,000
generations under the relaxed clock model, with an
uncorrelated lognormal distribution. The fossil calibration was set as the most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA) parametric tree prior. The results were retrieved
after combining the individual MCMC runs’ tree files
and the maximum clade credibility tree was constructed
after the initial 25% burn-in generations were discarded.

The amount of available sequence information for Musa
species is confined at present and hence the development of low-copy gene markers for phylogenetic studies
in this species has been laborious and time consuming.
Despite this, we were able to develop 19 markers from
gene regions. Only single- or low copy genes were
selected with expected random distribution in the genome of Musa to make sure that unlinked loci are compared. As the genome sequence of Musa is not yet
available, the selection of random distributed loci
assumed colinearity with the rice genome [52,53].
The 19 gene-based markers [GenBank: HM118565HM118820] developed and used in the present study
represent until now by far the largest set of gene markers ever used in the Musaceae. Ideally, a phylogenetic
study should comprise all taxa and a high number of
unlinked DNA markers. However, from practical reasons these numbers are reduced and, in fact, may not

be necessary. While some authors argue that incomplete
taxon sampling has a negative impact on the phylogenetic accuracy [54,55], other authors do not support this
view and prefer increasing the number of nucleotide
characters sampled over the number of taxa in order to
reveal the correct phylogeny without a major distortion
of accuracy of the main evolution relationships [56-58].
Here, we favored the latter approach with partial taxon
sampling of representatives [stratified sampling; [59]],
rather than analyzing a few genomic loci on a large set
of species. However, if felt necessary, the marker set
developed in this work can be easily applied in other
species and subspecies of Musaceae.
Sequence data characterization and systematic bias
testing

The 19 gene fragments covered a length of 16,012 bp, of
which 26.9% was exonic. The genic sequences were treated independently as a single-gene data and in two
matrixed-modes according to the ability to amplify the
genes from the outgroup species S. nicolai (see Table 2
for details); namely the dataset A (containing all 19 gene
sequences from 13 genotypes, excl. S. nicolai) and the
dataset B (containing sequences of 9 genes from all 14
genotypes, incl. the outgroup species S. nicolai). Dataset
A (all 19 fragments from the 13 Musaceae entries) was
based on 16,012 bp of sequence, of which 1,056 bases
were informative, while dataset B (nine gene fragments
from the Musaceae entries plus S. nicolai) was based on
7,404 bp of sequence, which included 492 informative
sites. The c2 test used to detect heterogeneity in base
composition indicates that there was no significant variation in the AT/GC content among species for individual genes (P = 0.382-1.000). The overall reduced
proportion of GC in most of the sequences (see Table
2) may be an artifact of the deliberate maximization of
intronic sequence in the sample, since plant intronic
sequence has an AT bias [60]. The GC content of the
intronic fraction was 34.6%, compared to 45.0% in the
exonic fraction.
Nucleotide sequences are considered to be phylogenetically informative until they reach the substitution
saturation. At this point, it is no longer possible to
deduce whether an observed similarity between a pair of
sequences results from their common ancestry or
whether this has occurred by chance [61]. To avoid the
inclusion of non-informative sequence, the level of substitution saturation was evaluated by plotting transitions
and transversions against the genetic distance for both
datasets A and B, as well as for the exonic and intronic
sequence separately. This procedure showed that the
frequency of both transitions and transversions
increased linearly along with divergence (Figure 1) with
transitions outnumbering transversions. This indicates

Page 6 of 13

that the saturation plateau was not reached, and the
data still retained sufficient phylogenetic signal.
The constancy of the evolutionary rate was verified
using a relative rate test, which revealed some heterogeneity in the sequences (data not shown). However, after
a re-analysis based on RY-coded (purines/pyrimidines)
sequence, which ignores transitions by focusing on the
slower evolving transversions [62], the topologies generated were similar to those obtained from the full nucleotide sequence data. This implied that the rate
heterogeneity was not large enough to significantly bias
the deduced phylogenies.
Phylogenetic reconstruction based on individual gene
fragments

The reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships
between the selected taxa representing the Musaceae
family was performed by two different criterion-based
methods (maximum parsimony; MP and maximum likelihood; ML) and by a third complementary approach
based on the Bayesian inference method (BI). Data were
first executed in MrModeltest v.2.3 [44] in order to
select the most appropriate model of evolution to be
used for phylogenetic analyses. The Akaike Information
Criterion was chosen [63] to be implemented in maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis, as it was reported
to have preferable performance in model selection compared to likelihood ratio tests [64]. The evolutionary
models selected for the phylogenetic reconstruction are
detailed in Table 3. The MP analysis based on the individual gene fragment sequences produced more than
one most parsimonious tree for eight of the 19
sequences (Additional File 2). In 15 of the 19 phylogenies there were unresolved polytomies. Clades I
(Eumusa + Rhodochlamys) and II (Australimusa + Callimusa) were fully recovered (Figure 2), except for gene
fragment g-4, the sequence of which comprised one of
the shortest intron sequences and the lowest proportion
of phylogenetically informative positions. A similar
result was obtained by ML analysis, in which partially
resolved phylogenies applied to 15 of the 19 sequences,
with an altered topology appearing within either clade I
or II for gene fragments g-5, g-12, g-17 and g-19 (Additional File 2).
The BI analysis generated fully resolved phylogenies,
albeit with topology alterations within clades I and II.
The level of internal resolution within clades I and II
varied according to the phylogenetic informativeness of
the sequences. Unresolved relationships emerged within
both clades I (between M. acuminata, M. mannii and
M. ornata), and II (between M. textilis/M. maclayi/Fe’i
and M. beccarii/M. coccinea). When the phylogenetic
content of the sequences was evaluated by the likelihood-mapping approach, it was clear that each of the

Figure 1 Transitions and transversions versus divergence plots. The estimated number of transitions and transversions for each pairwise
comparison was plotted against the genetic distance calculated with the TN93 model [80] for (1) dataset A, (2) dataset B, (3) exonic sequence,
(4) intronic sequence. Transitions outnumber transversions along with the linear increase in the genetic distance. This pattern can be interpreted
as indicating that substitution saturation has not been reached, so that the data can be expected to provide sufficient phylogenetic signal.

single gene fragment-based phylogenies contained a significant fraction of unresolved quartets (Table 4), showing that a single sequence is insufficient for making
inference regarding evolutionary relationships. However,
for both of the combined datasets A and B, there were
no unresolved or partially resolved quartets and thus we
investigated a possibility of combining individual gene
data into a single data set for the phylogenetic
reconstruction.
Based on the ILD analysis, the individual gene fragment partitions were highly incongruent (P < 0.001) and
thus not directly combinable. However, it has been suggested that the ILD test should not be used as an exclusive measure of data partition combinability [65], as it is
known to be susceptible to both types I [false positives;
[66]] and II [false negatives; [67]] error. When Rokas et
al. [68] combined sequence data derived from a set of
different genes, conflicting signals from individual gene
sequences were resolved and the resulting phylogeny
was strongly supported. The joint use of a set of gene
sequences for phylogenetic inference depends largely on

nucleotide composition bias and substitution saturation
[61]. Since the c2 test applied to the Musaceae sequence
data indicated the absence of any base composition bias,
and substitution saturation of the aligned sequences
could be excluded (Figure 1), the combined set of gene
fragment sequences was then used for phylogenetic
reconstruction.
Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the combined
sequence data

MP analysis of dataset A yielded a single fully resolved
most parsimonious tree (length = 2333; CI = 0.8678
excluding non-informative characters; RI = 0.9337; RC =
0.8648) with significantly high level of bootstrap support
for each of the individual branches (Figure 2). The internal branches among the M. acuminata accessions and
the Rhodochlamys species, as well as within the Australimusa/Callimusa clade were dichotomous. The ML
analysis supported an identical tree topology with high
bootstrap support values. Although the BI analysis also
produced a fully resolved tree with a high posterior

probability for all nodes (Additional File 3), the monophyly of Ensete and Musella at the genus level was not
supported. Due to the lack of an outgroup for dataset A,
E. ventricosum was used as a surrogate, a choice which
probably accounted for the MP and ML-based phylogenies. The fact that these phylogenies were likely artefactual was confirmed by the use of the midpoint rooting
method, which generated the same topology as emerged
from the BI analysis and from dataset B (see below).
The MP analysis of dataset B also produced a single
most parsimonious tree (length = 2253; CI = 0.7536
excluding non-informative characters; RI = 0.8483; RC =
0.7779) with high bootstrap support for all nodes. The
same topology was supported by both the ML and BI
analyses (Figure 3), and was the same as emerged from
the BI analysis of dataset A (Additional File 3). A similar
phylogeny was suggested when the individual gene fragments were analyzed separately with the S. nicolai
sequence as the outgroup (Additional File 2). Thus the
choice of outgroup was clearly responsible for the conflicting phylogenies. Various Zingiberales (Strelitziaceae,
Heliconiaceae, Zingiberaceae) species have been selected
as outgroups in other taxonomic studies of the Musaceae [8,31,69,70], and some of these have questioned the
position of Musella as a separate genus. Nevertheless,
the evolutionary relationships within Musa (clades I +

II, Figure 2 and 3) were not affected in either dataset by
the choice of either outgroup or rooting method.
In order to assess how much phylogenetic information
was contributed by the coding and non-coding fractions,
the exonic and intronic sequences were analyzed separately. This was possible given that substitution saturation was not reached in either partition (Figure 1). As
expected, the intronic sequence outnumbered the exonic, both in terms of the frequency of variable bases
(15.2% vs 7.1%) and of parsimony informativeness (7.9%
vs 3.3%). The phylogenies reconstructed by ML, MP and
BI analysis consisted of a single tree with strong statistical branch support. The trees’ topology was identical to
that of combined dataset. Thus, the inclusion of noncoding sequence did not introduce erroneous phylogenetic signals, but rather enhanced the robustness of the
phylogenetic reconstruction.
Taxonomic implications of the sequence-based phylogeny

The final topology (Figure 3) confirmed the Musaceae
family in general, and the Musa genus in particular, to
be monophyletic. The monotypic genus Musella
appeared as a sister species to the E. ventricosum. The
validity of Musella as a genus has been questioned in
previous studies and a merger between Musella and
Ensete species has been suggested [31]. On the contrary,

The proportion of unresolved and partially resolved quartets is shown for
phylogenies based both on single gene fragments, and on the combined
data.

the recent study of Li et al. [8] based on ITS and chloroplast loci did not come to a similar definite conclusion
and underlined a need for sampling more molecular
markers in order to provide the answer. Although more
representatives of both of the genera would be necessary
to elucidate this issue, the large set of phylogenetic markers presented here provides an excellent tool for
addressing this question in future studies.
For many years, Musa has been divided into four sections, on the basis of morphological descriptors and
basic chromosome number [3]. However, it is important
to quote Cheesman’s flexible view: “The groups have
deliberately been called sections rather than subgenera

Page 9 of 13

in an attempt to avoid the implication that they are of
equal rank. I am inclined to regard the division between
Eumusa and Rhodochlamys as unessential, though it is
convenient to maintain as long as it remains as well
marked in the field as it is at present. On the other
hand the seed of Callimusa almost justifies its segregation as a distinct genus, and would do so were not Australimusa intermediate in some characters between it
and Eumusa” [3]. Recently, several DNA sequence-based
analyses have indeed questioned the validity of some of
the four sections. In particular, Eumusa and Rhodochlamys representatives have been in some cases demonstrated to be more closely related to one another than
to their sectional relatives, as was shown for some Australimusa and Callimusa species [6,7,9,10].
The present data indicate a close relationship between
the species of Rhodochlamys and M. acuminata
(Eumusa). The position of M. ornata within the A-genome group of Eumusa section (Figure 3) agrees with the
findings of other authors [7,10,31,70], and indicates that
Rhodochlamys and Eumusa are not reciprocally monophyletic. Various Eumusa × Rhodochlamys hybrids have
been observed, and are likely to be numerous in the
monsoon region of SE Asia [71]. Although the current
molecular data in relation to the morphological observation indicate that the claims for merging of Rhodochlamys and Eumusa [6,8,10] were justified, final resolution
of this issue will require a better representation of species within both sections. The new set of phylogenetic
markers developed in this study can be applied easily in
future to analyze in detail phylogenetic relationships
between and within Musaceae taxa.
In contrast to the clustering of M. balbisiana with M.
textilis (section Australimusa), as reported by Liu et al.
[31], the present data identified a clearly separated
group of M. balbisiana entries within clade I, suggesting
that this species is phylogenetically quite distinct from
other Eumusa species. The distance between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana appears to be greater than
between it and the Rhodochlamys species (Figure 3), as
has also been noted by others [8,11,31]; these relationships are consistent with conclusions based on cytogenetic and hybridization studies [72,73]. The clear
separation between M. balbisiana and M. acuminata is
particularly interesting given that almost all varieties of
edible (polyploid) banana are thought to have evolved
from natural hybrids between these two species [4].
Based on the gene fragment sequences, M. textilis fell,
as expected, into the Australimusa section within Clade
II (Figure 3), which also includes the Callimusa species.
The two representatives of the section Callimusa
included in this study differ in the basic chromosome
number (Table 1), reflecting the noted controversy of
Callimusa as a natural section [9,10,74]. M. beccarii and

genome]) plus Rhodochlamys (M. mannii and M. ornata) entries. Clade II: Australimusa (M. textilis, M. maclayi and Fe’i) plus Callimusa (M. coccinea
and M. beccarii). entries. Clade III: Musella + Ensete genus. The lettering (A-J) attached to the secondary nodes refers to divergence times, as
specified in Table 5.

M. coccinea did not form a strictly separated Callimusa
cluster; instead, their close relationship to Australimusa
species was apparent (Figure 3). The only representative
of Fe’i bananas (parthenocarpic edible types distributed
throughout Pacific islands) in this study appears to be
most closely related to M. maclayi, in line with Simmonds [71], who considered M. maclayi to be a wild
progenitor of the Fe’i banana.
Estimation of time of divergence

The reconstructed phylogeny emerging from dataset A
was used to estimate the times of divergence of the
major Musaceae clades (Table 5). When the dating was
solely constrained by the minimum age of the Ensete
fossil record, the crown node age of the Musaceae
family could be placed in the early Paleocene (69.1
Mya), consistent with the rapid radiation of the Zingiberales in the early Tertiary [32]. A better supported
estimate of this time required the inclusion of a relevant
outgroup-calibration point within the dataset B, but the
lack of fossil records forced us to use of an external calibration point. Estimates for the age of the Zingiberales
vary between 88 and 124 Mya [32-34,36]. Here we have

adopted the most distant of these dates for the age of
the most recent common ancestor of the Musaceae and
Strelitziaceae. When this two-point calibration (Ensete
fossil record and the external calibration with the Zingiberales age) was applied to dataset B, which included
the outgroup species, the divergence time of the Musaceae was placed at 61.5 Mya. Estimates of divergence
date from both, dataset A and B lie within the Musaceae
crown-stem age interval of 61-87 Mya made by Janssen
and Bremer [33]. Thus, the estimates (Table 5) emerging
from the dataset A comprising nearly doubled amount
of phylogenetic information, were considered strongly
supported. Based on this data, the rapid diversification
of the Zingiberales probably occurred at the Cretaceous/
Tertiary boundary (> 65 Mya).
Despite the fact that the estimated age of the Musaceae family (69 Mya) is much younger than the 110
Mya postulated by Kress and Specht [36], the two estimates for the age of the Musa genus (50.7 Mya and
51.4 Mya) are indistinguishable. As the Musaceae are
over-represented in our sample (as compared to other
Zingiberales families), the current estimate probably
represents a minimal age for the radiation of the

Musaceae. The present data can be used to date the
speciation events within both Australimusa/Callimusa
and Rhodochlamys/Eumusa to some 28 Mya (Figure 3,
nodes C, D). Within the Clade I, the B genome lineage
(M. balbisiana species) was the first to diverge, followed
by the M. mannii lineage, representing the Rhodochlamys section, at 20 Mya. Speciation within the A genome
lineage (M. acuminata species) began 11.4 Mya. The
minimum age of M. ornata, which appears to belong to
the A genome group within Eumusa section, is estimated to be 8.7 Mya (Figure 3; node I).
Although M. mannii is an “imperfectly understood
small species up to 1.3 m high with purplish-red bracts
that do not curl back” [75], it undoubtedly belongs to
section Rhodochlamys, which is confined to the monsoon-affected areas of Southeast Asia. Its characteristic
dry-season die-back is presumably an adaptation to
drought, and contrasts with the behavior of the Eumusa
species endemic to the same geographical region, which
survive the dry season, although often in poor condition
[71]. The monsoon regime was established following the
formation of the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau,
and is thought to have stabilized in its current form
around 20-25 Mya [76]. The estimated divergence date
of M. mannii (20 Mya, Table 5) could therefore reflect
an adaptation to climate change. The later divergence
time of the other Rhodochlamys member, M. ornata,
could be explained by its probable derivation from a
hybrid between M. velutina (section Rhodochlamys) and
M. flaviflora, belonging to a taxon intermediate between
Rhodochlamys and Eumusa [73].
The speciation of the Callimusa species can be dated
between 8.8 and 28.7 Mya, while the divergence of the
Australimusa species occurred ~5 Mya (Figure 3, nodes
H, J). The relatively recent emergence of the section

Australimusa is consistent with its perception as an evolutionarily rather young group [77]. Shepherd [73] determined that the “species” within this section behave
genetically as a single species, which he therefore designated Musa textilis Née. The current phylogeny (Figure 3)
supports this view, implying that M. textilis could well be
the founding species of the entire section. Numerical taxonomy has placed M. textilis equidistant from the four
Musa sections [78]. In this context it is worth noting that
robust and sterile diploid hybrids (’Canton’) between M.
textilis (x = 10) and ‘Pacol’ (a form of M. balbisiana, x =
11) are common in The Philippines.
The divergence of M. coccinea appears to be rather
older than that of the members of the Australimusa section (Table 5). Unsuccessful attempts to cross two Callimusa species M. coccinea and M. borneensis led
Shepherd [79] to suggest that they differentiated from
one another long before the evolution of the Australimusa species. The seed morphology of Callimusa species is very different from that of any of the other Musa
sections, being cylindrical, barrel- or top-shaped, and
marked externally by a transverse line or groove. When
ripe, they develop a large, empty chalazal (perisperm)
chamber above the groove [10,77]. Although the molecular data alone indicate the paraphyletic position Callimusa to Australimusa entries (Figure 3), given the
above mentioned morphological aspects and the flexibility of the term “section” by Cheesman [3] we believe
that merging the two Musa sections with x = 10, as proposed by Wong et al. [10] and indicated by Li et al. [8],
is not tenable.

Conclusions
The gene sequence-based phylogeny presented here provides a substantial insight into the course of speciation

within the Musaceae. The data tend to sustain the close
relationship of Rhodochlamys and Eumusa species, supporting the possibility of merging the two sections into
a single one. A greater number of species sampled could
generate an improved classification, and could help in
clarifying the relationship between the species Rhodochlamys and M. acuminata, as well as to confirm the
generic status of Musella and Ensete. Based on the largest amount of nucleotide characters for Musaceae
obtained to date, this study provides the first estimates
of divergence times for individual Musa sections and
genome groups within the Musaceae. Although limited
by the number of species sampled from individual sections and subgroups, we provide a plausible reconstruction of speciation events within the Musaceae, a family
which has given rise to one of mankind’s major crops.
