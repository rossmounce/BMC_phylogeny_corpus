Abstract
Background: Dating of population divergence is critical in understanding speciation and in
evaluating the evolutionary significance of genetic lineages, upon which identification of
conservation and management units should be based. In this study we used a multilocus approach
and the Isolation-Migration model based on coalescence theory to estimate the time of divergence
of the Spanish and Eastern imperial eagle sister species. This model enables estimation of population
sizes at split, and inference of gene flow after divergence.
Results: Our results indicate that divergence may have occurred during the Holocene or the late
Pleistocene, much more recently than previously suspected. They also suggest a large population
reduction at split, with an estimated effective population size several times smaller for the western
population than for the eastern population. Asymmetrical gene flow after divergence, from the
Eastern imperial eagle to the Spanish imperial eagle, was detected for the nuclear genome but not
the mitochondrial genome. Male-mediated gene flow after divergence may explain this result, and
the previously reported lower mitochondrial diversity but similar nuclear diversity in Spanish
imperial eagles compared to the Eastern species.
Conclusion: Spanish and Eastern imperial eagles split from a common ancestor much more
recently than previously thought, and asymmetrical gene flow occurred after divergence. Revision
of the phylogenetic proximity of both species is warranted, with implications for conservation.

Background
The dating of speciation events and investigation of the
evolutionary processes involved are major themes in evolutionary biology with important implications for conservation biology. For endangered species, knowledge of
these historical processes is critical for correct interpretation of current patterns of genetic variation, and guides
assignment of conservation priorities and elaboration of
subsequent conservation strategies [1,2].

The classical approach to dating speciation events has
been based on the molecular clock, which has proven to
be an appropriate tool for addressing a wide range of evolutionary hypotheses [3]. However, several factors have
resulted in challenges to the validity of this approach, particularly in application to recently diverged species [4-7].
Firstly, accurate and appropriate calibration points are
often lacking, especially for taxa with poor fossil records,
including birds [8]. Secondly, the assumptions of rate
constancy over time and across lineages are often chalPage 1 of 8

lenged. Ho and colleagues [9] have reported evidence
indicating that the rate of molecular evolution is much
faster over short time scales, and thus the timing of many
recent events in evolution may have been overestimated.
Thirdly, the high variance in coalescent times across loci
makes estimation of the divergence time based on a single
genetic locus inaccurate, and highlights the need to use
multiple unlinked loci. Finally, due to ancestral polymorphism, gene divergence antedates species divergence by a
timeframe τ that, in recently separated species, may be
very large in relation to the time of split; in birds this difference is typically on the order of several hundred thousand years [10].
New likelihood and Bayesian methods based on coalescence theory have recently been developed for estimating
species divergence times, potentially overcoming some of
the above handicaps [e.g. [1,11,12]]. Some of these methods apply the Isolation and Migration (IM) model [1,11],
which provides estimates of population divergence dates
rather than gene coalescence dates, and enables pure isolation with subsequent independent evolution to be distinguished from isolation with subsequent gene flow. The
model has been recently extended to make it applicable to
data from multiple unlinked loci, even with different
modes of inheritance [1].

chondrial evolution. In this regard it is widely accepted
that Pleistocene glaciations were important in shaping the
complex pattern of extant species [21-25]. Southern European peninsulas acted as isolated refugia for temperate
species during glacial maxima [21,26], allowing the accumulation of variation and divergence through allopatry
over an extended time period [21,27]. During interglacial
periods species spread from the refugia and recolonized
the more northern European areas [21,26]. The ability to
fly might have allowed birds to find refugia further south,
in Africa. African refugia have been suggested for eastern
lineages of Gypaetus barbatus [28] and imperial eagles [16].
In the present work we applied a modified IM model [1]
to analyse data from an extensive survey of the distribution of A. adalberti and A. heliaca, in order to investigate
the evolutionary processes explaining their divergence.
Specifically, we aimed to estimate divergence dates and
gene flow following divergence, and assess the implications of our findings for conservation of the endangered
Spanish imperial eagle. The results will have implications
for the taxonomy of imperial eagles and delimitation of
Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs – defined as genetically differentiated populations that have adaptive differences, and thus merit separate genetic management).

Results
The status of the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti
Brehm) has fluctuated between threatened and vulnerable
in the last 20 years, and it is currently classified as "Vulnerable" in the IUCN red list of threatened species [13]. With
less than 200 breeding pairs remaining (Catalogo
nacional de especies amenazadas del Ministerio de Medio
Ambiente, R.D. 439/1990), the species is confined to the
south-western quadrant of the Iberian Peninsula [14]. The
population of its sister species, the Eastern imperial eagle
(Aquila heliaca Savigny), is estimated to be 2,500–10,000
individuals across continental Eurasia. This species is also
considered "Vulnerable", although under a less severe criterion [13] (Figure 1). The Spanish imperial eagle has
been considered a subspecies (A. heliaca adalberti; for
example see [15]) of the Eastern imperial eagle because of
similarity in diet and the main aspects of their breeding
biology [16], and the existence of only minor differences
in the adult plumage pattern. However, noticeable differences in juvenile plumages [17] and an allopatric current
(though probably parapatric historical) distribution [18]
have supported their current designation as separate species [19]. This situation provides an interesting case study
of very similar species with large differences in population
sizes and distribution ranges. Seibold et al. [20] estimated
the date of divergence of these species at around one million years ago (mid-Pleistocene), based on the number of
differences in a single mitochondrial gene (cytochrome b)
and assuming an uncorrected rate (2% My-1) of mito-

ter t (the parameter with the lowest ESS value in every
run).
Microsatellite maximum likelihood estimates of population sizes were θ1 = 1.9 (0.73–5.43, 90% Highest Posterior
Density, HPD), θ2 = 3.6 (1.87–5.96, 90% HPD) and θA =
57.1 (21.88–170.52, 90% HPD), and for the mitochondrial marker were θ1 = 5.12 (1.53–12.43, 90% HPD), θ2 =
14.86 (7.45–26.99, 90% HPD) and θA = 18.47 (7.58–
48.66, 90% HPD). Our estimates for θA suggest a bottleneck for both populations at the time of split from the
common ancestor, and that this was more intense in the
case of A. adalberti.
Posterior probabilities for the divergence times are plotted
in Figure 2A for both marker types. In the case of the microsatellite data set, the posterior probability distribution
peaked at time t = 1.35 (0.40–3.45, 90% HPD). The estimate of t for the mitochondrial data reached a maximum
probability at t = 0.75 (0.27–1.65, 90% HPD). Because t
is scaled by the mutation rate μ, and θ = 4Neμ, an estimate
of time in units of 2Ne generations can be obtained by
dividing the ML estimate of t by one half the ML estimate
of θ. For the nuclear genome we obtained an estimate of
1.4 × 2Ne generations (0.4–3.6, 90% HPD), and for the
mitochondrial D-loop the estimate was 0.29 × 2Ne generations (0.11–0.64, 90% HPD). The Ne harmonic mean for
A. adalberti during the last century was estimated for 117
individuals (B. Martínez-Cruz and J.A. Godoy, unpublished data) using a likelihood-based temporal approach
[29]. Assuming a mean generation time of 16.4 years [30],
this results in divergence time estimates of 5.37 × 103 years
ago (1.54 × 103–1.38 × 104 years ago, 90% HPD) for the
nuclear genome, and 1.11 × 103 years ago (422–2.46 × 103
years ago, 90% HPD) for the mitochondrial genome. As
we estimated Ne for a period when the A. adalberti popu-

lation had undergone a decline, the value obtained might
be an underestimate of the historical population. However, ecological constraints suggest that the population
has never been large [16], and in a previous study we suggested that the demographic bottleneck was not strong
enough to affect genetic diversity [31]. Even with a reduction up to 20% of the historical population size (historical
Ne around six hundred), the estimated time of divergence
would be 2.69 × 104 years ago (7.7 × 103–6.9 × 104 years
ago, 90% HPD) for the microsatellite marker, and 5.6 ×
103 years ago (2.30 × 103–1.29 × 104 years ago, 90% HPD)
for the mitochondrial marker. Calculation of divergence
time from t and μ produced similar results. For the microsatellite marker, assuming a mean value of 5 × 10-4 for
microsatellite mutation rates [32], the estimate of time of
divergence is 2.9 × 103 years ago. For the mitochondrial
marker the estimated time of divergence is 5.98 × 102
years ago, assuming that the mitochondrial control region
evolves 10.4 times faster than the entire mitochondrial
genome [33], and thus a mean rate of evolution of 20.8 %
My-1 for this fragment.
Gene flow is suggested by the microsatellite data but not
the mitochondrial data, indicating that recurrent gene
flow occurred between the two eagle populations, from A.
heliaca to A. adalberti. We ran the model setting m2 to zero
(estimating five parameters: θ1, θ2, θA, m1 and t). The log
likelihood ratio log [max{L (m1 = 0 | X)}/max{L (m1 |
X)}] was -3.12, suggesting the adequacy of a model that
includes migration. The proportion of A. adalberti
replaced by A. heliaca migrants, scaled by mutation rate,
was estimated in m1 = 0.99 (0.38–2.47, 90% HPD) (Figure
2B). If the relationship 2N1m1 = 4N1μ × 1/2 × m1/μ [34]
and estimates of θ and μ are used, an estimated migration
of 0.94 gene copies per generation is obtained. Therefore,
our analysis suggests that approximately one Eastern male

imperial eagle might have effectively reached the Spanish
imperial eagle population per generation since they
started to diverge.

Discussion
Analysis of two independent data sets indicated that the
Eastern and Spanish imperial eagles split from a common
ancestor much more recently than has been suggested
[16,20], and that the split occurred during the Holocene
or the very late Pleistocene. The absence of imperial eagle
remains in the Iberian fossil record for the entire Pleistocene is consistent with the hypothesis that colonization
of the Iberian peninsula was very recent, on the order of
several thousand years (A. Sánchez Marco, personal communication), but contradicts the previous phylogenetic
estimate of one million years ago for the divergence of
these species [16,20]. Estimates of the population parameter θ for the ancestral and descendant populations suggest that the split would have significantly reduced the
size of a large ancestral population, affecting the western
descendant population to a greater extent. A recent divergence and a large effective size of the ancestral population
could explain the large differences in the time of split estimated by phylogenetic and coalescent-based methods.
Moreover, the recent work of Ho et al. [9], which showed
that rate of change for molecular divergence for recent
evolutionary events (< 2 million years) is much higher
than the traditionally accepted 2% per million years [9],
would suggest that the phylogenetic estimate of one million years ago for the divergence of the two eagles is a substantial overestimation. These results also suggest the
need for revision of the dating of speciation events in
birds, which are often dated to the early or middle Pleistocene by phylogenetic methods, and brings into question
the importance of glaciation during the Pleistocene in the
diversification of bird species [2,35,36]. In the case of

imperial eagles, such a recent divergence also raises questions concerning their current taxonomic status as separate species, originally proposed primarily on the basis of
plumage patterns [17]. In this regard the occurrence of A.
heliaca (Eastern) plumages in both adult and juvenile A.
adalberti individuals, observed in the field at low frequencies (Spanish Ministry of Environment, unpublished
data), might indicate retained ancestral polymorphism
consistent with a recent separation of imperial eagles.
If imperial eagles remained isolated during repeated glacial maxima in two different glacial refugia [16], our data
would suggest that divergence was subsequently aborted
by secondary contacts during interglacial periods, until
they were finally differentiated during the last glaciation.
Alternatively, divergence could have occurred through a
recent colonization of Iberia from Africa, as suggested for
other steppe birds [37], followed by disruption of its distribution range in northern Africa. This colonization
might have occurred, as there was suitable steppe habitat
on the Iberian Peninsula 10,000 years ago during the
Younger Dryas period, as revealed by palynological data
[38]. Movement into the Iberian Peninsula could have
occurred from the north of Africa, where the Spanish
imperial eagle existed until last century [39]. Up to 80%
of bird species in northern Africa are of Palaearctic origin
[40], and the semiarid to subhumid conditions during the
Neolithic were probably suitable for imperial eagles in
this area, while the presence of a more or less dense tree
cover throughout Europe may not have provided suitable
habitat. More recently, the aridity in North Africa since
3,000 B.P. could have reduced animal populations to refuges [40], and disrupted the distribution range of the
imperial eagle. A detailed study of the phylogeography of
the species, specifically including museum samples from
northern Africa, is necessary to test this hypothesis.

Our results also indicate male-mediated gene flow from
Eastern imperial eagles to Spanish imperial eagles after
divergence. This may have occurred by eastern eagles devi-

ating in their wintering routes to and from Africa through
continental Italy and Sicily [18], and finally wintering in
Spain. This phenomenon has been described for other
raptor species including A. clanga (spotted eagle) and A.
pomarina (lesser spotted eagle) (Monitoring Group of the
Doñana Biological Station, unpublished data). The
absence of female-mediated gene flow could also be a
consequence of the lower fitness of heterogametic female
hybrids (following Haldane's rule [41]), as has been suggested for A. clanga and A. pomarina [42] and documented
for other species [43,44]. Male mediated asymmetrical
gene flow could explain the low mitochondrial but high
nuclear diversity in Spanish imperial eagles (both currently and in the population predating the decline which
occurred during the 20th century [31,45]), as well as the
reciprocal monophyly observed for the mitochondrial
genome. Therefore, reduced mitochondrial diversity, far
from being a consequence of recent demographic alterations, seems to be a signature for a founder effect, a history
of small Ne or restricted female-mediated gene flow.
The recent split and occurrence of subsequent gene flow
have implications for the taxonomic and conservation status of both imperial eagles. Although the asymmetric gene
flow pattern might still indicate some level of reproductive incompatibility, full reproductive isolation is contradicted by our observations of gene flow. Based on the
scarcity of diagnostic characters (such as the A. heliaca
plumages in both adults and juveniles occurring in the A.
adalberti population; Spanish Ministry of Environment,
unpublished data) and the low level of morphological,
ecological or behavioural divergence, these taxa might be
conservatively classified as allospecies based upon the criteria of Helbig et al. [46]. Finally, our results preclude
rejection of historical genetic exchangeability [47], and
highlight the need to determine whether both allospecies
represent different ESUs by evaluating current ecological
exchangeability, ideally through an experimental
approach [48]. If exchangeability cannot be ruled out, and
if the Spanish imperial eagle viability were to be compromised anew, the introduction of Eastern individuals
should be carefully considered [48].

Conclusion
Our results have shown that the split that gave rise to
Spanish and Eastern imperial eagles was very recent, and
that asymmetrical gene flow occurred after divergence.
This presents a completely unexpected scenario for the
evolutionary origins of imperial eagles, with implications
for management strategies for the endangered A. adalberti.
Our work also shows the potential of coalescent-based
models in inferring evolutionary processes, and illustrates
the value of an historical perspective in developing a full
understanding of contemporary genetic patterns, and in
design of adequate conservation strategies.

Methods
Samples, sequencing, genotyping and data analysis
Thirty-four museum specimens of A. adalberti, representing the population one hundred years ago [45], 33 contemporary A. heliaca individuals [31], and 50 museum
specimens of A. heliaca were analysed for a 345 bp mitochondrial control region fragment (EMBL accession numbers AJ567366, AJ567367, AJ937835 and AJ574878–
AJ574885). A random subset of 15 individuals of each
species was analysed for eight microsatellite loci (GenBank accession numbers AF469499, AF469502,
AF469504, AF469505, AF469507, AF469509, AF469510
and AF469512) [49]. The A. adalberti historic sample was
included to avoid the possible influence of the recently
arisen genetic structure in the analysis [45]. Large allelic
frequency fluctuations across generations are unlikely for
A. heliaca in the period analysed, as the species has always
been globally abundant and widely distributed. A complete description of the samples is available upon request.

The basic IM model [11,50-52], as modified by Hey and
Nielsen [1] to make it applicable to data from multiple
unlinked loci, was used in this study. Six different parameters can be estimated in this coalescent model, in which
an ancestral population (size NA) splits at time t into two
descendant populations (sizes N1 and N2) which may
subsequently establish gene flow between them at rates
m1 and m2 (the proportion of populations 1 and 2 that are
replaced by migrants from the other population, respectively). The model assumes selective neutrality and no further population subdivision within each population. It
also assumes that population sizes do not change over
time. Nielsen and Wakeley [11] implemented a likelihood/Bayesian approach that uses a Metropolis-Hastings,
Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Estimates of the
parameters were based on the posterior distribution of
those parameters, p (T, M, θ | X), where T is the time of
split, M is the migration rate that may be asymmetrical
(that is m1 ≠ m2), θ is the population parameter 2Neμ, and
X is the data. It was necessary to apply some assumptions
to these parameters, described by the prior distributions,
to estimate the posterior distribution. Firstly, we assumed
that all parameter values were equally likely (uniform distribution), so that posterior probabilities are proportional
to the likelihood function. Secondly, to ensure that the
posterior distribution was a real probability distribution,
we constrained the parameter space, i.e. we set maximum
values for the priors of the parameters. By doing so, the
results can be interpreted in a Bayesian framework as well
as in a likelihood framework. The model was modified
[52] using the HKY model of molecular evolution to
include the possibility of multiple mutations in the same
site [53]. More recently Hey and Nielsen [1] included a
stepwise mutation model, and a procedure for consider-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/170

ing loci that combines both an infinite sites component
and a stepwise component.
A critical issue with the use of MCMC approach is whether
the parameter space has been fully explored and the stationary distribution has been adequately sampled. As recommended by Hey and Nielsen [1] we first performed
multiple runs for each set, with an increasing number of
steps and using wide priors to ensure that the complete
posterior distribution could be obtained. Low autocorrelation parameters (i.e. < 0.03), parameter update rates
greater than 2%, and similar distributions after several
independent runs were used as criteria for adequate mixing. We found multiple heated chains, implemented in
the program, did not perform as well as a single chain
based on these criteria. All six parameters were estimated
for both datasets. For the microsatellite analysis, the full
model of six parameters resulted in zero migration from
the Spanish into the Eastern imperial eagle population;
for the mitochondrial analysis, the full model of six
parameters resulted in zero migration for both, m1 and
m2. Hypothesis testing on the significance of migration
values was performed for both marker types by comparing
the likelihood value at m = 0 to the likelihood value
obtained at the maximum likelihood estimate, and contrasting the log likelihood ratio against the distribution of
the simulations previously presented [Figure 5 in ref [11]].
In cases where migration was not different from zero, the
full model was run again with those parameters set to zero
(m2 for the microsatellite dataset, and both m1 and m2 for
the mitochondrial dataset). We finally performed three
independent runs of 5 × 108 steps with a burn-in of 2 × 106
steps for the set of eight microsatellite markers, and three
independent runs of 2 × 107 steps with a burn-in of 1 × 106
steps for the control region sequence dataset, using narrow priors after results of the preliminary analyses.
Analyses were performed in a Pentium 4, 3.2 GHz, 1 GB

750 nodes interconnected by Gigabit Ethernet to a data
