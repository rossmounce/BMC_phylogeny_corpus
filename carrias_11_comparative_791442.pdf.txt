specific to the channel catfish pathogen
Edwardsiella ictaluri

Abstract
Background: The bacterial pathogen Edwardsiella ictaluri is a primary cause of mortality in channel catfish raised
commercially in aquaculture farms. Additional treatment and diagnostic regimes are needed for this enteric
pathogen, motivating the discovery and characterization of bacteriophages specific to E. ictaluri.
Results: The genomes of three Edwardsiella ictaluri-specific bacteriophages isolated from geographically distant
aquaculture ponds, at different times, were sequenced and analyzed. The genomes for phages eiAU, eiDWF, and
eiMSLS are 42.80 kbp, 42.12 kbp, and 42.69 kbp, respectively, and are greater than 95% identical to each other at
the nucleotide level. Nucleotide differences were mostly observed in non-coding regions and in structural proteins,
with significant variability in the sequences of putative tail fiber proteins. The genome organization of these
phages exhibit a pattern shared by other Siphoviridae.
Conclusions: These E. ictaluri-specific phage genomes reveal considerable conservation of genomic architecture
and sequence identity, even with considerable temporal and spatial divergence in their isolation. Their genomic
homogeneity is similarly observed among E. ictaluri bacterial isolates. The genomic analysis of these phages
supports the conclusion that these are virulent phages, lacking the capacity for lysogeny or expression of virulence
genes. This study contributes to our knowledge of phage genomic diversity and facilitates studies on the
diagnostic and therapeutic applications of these phages.

Background
Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence and
annotation of the genomes of three bacteriophages specific to the gram negative bacterial pathogen Edwardsiella ictaluri, the causative agent of enteric septicemia
of catfish (ESC). ESC is a primary cause of mortality in
catfish farms with annual direct losses in the range of
$40-60 million dollars in the U.S. [1]. Economic losses
coupled with limited available treatment options for
controlling ESC, and concerns regarding the development of resistance to antibiotics used in aquaculture
warranted efforts to identify biological control agents
that are antagonistic to E. ictaluri (e.g., bacteriophage
and bacteria). In addition, the multiple days necessary to
obtain a diagnostic result for E. ictaluri via biochemical
tests was a motivation to identify phage that could serve

as specific, rapid, and inexpensive typing agents for ESC
disease isolates.
The idea of using phage as antimicrobial agents to
treat bacterial infections in agriculture or aquaculture is
not a new proposition [2]; however, there is now a better understanding of phage biology and genetics, and
with it a better understanding of their potential and
their limitations as biological control agents [3]. The
most serious obstacles to successful use of phage therapy include the development of phage resistance by host
bacteria, the capacity of some temperate phages to
transduce virulence factors (i.e., lysogenic conversion),
the possible degradation or elimination of phages by
gastrointestinal pH or proteolytic activity within a fish,
and the possible immune system clearance of administered phage. Potentially viable solutions are available to
counter each of these concerns, including the use of
multiple phages at concentrations selected to reduce the
development of phage-resistant bacterial populations [4],

identifying phage variants adapted to minimize GI tract
and/or immune clearance [5], and by selecting bacteriophages as therapeutic agents that are well characterized
at a genomic level, with no potential for inducing lysogenic conversion [2,3,6].
Two unique E. ictaluri-specific phages jeiAU (eiAU)
and jeiDWF (eiDWF) were isolated from aquaculture
ponds with a history of ESC [7]. Phage eiAU was isolated in 1985 at Auburn University and phage eiDWF
was recently isolated in 2006 in western Alabama. An
additional E. ictaluri-specific bacteriophage jeiMSLS
(eiMSLS) was isolated directly from culture water from
a commercial catfish aquaculture pond in Washington
County, MS in 2004 (Timothy Welch, USDA National
Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture, WV personal communication). The isolation of each of these
bacteriophages was accomplished by concentrating
viruses from pond water samples by ultrafiltration and
enriching for E. ictaluri-specific bacteriophages via
enrichment in log-phase bacterial broth cultures. These
three bacteriophages were classified initially within the
family Siphoviridae due to their long, non-contractile
tails, but their phylogenetic affiliation could not be
assessed in the absence of phage genome sequence analysis [8-10]. To date no other bacteriophage morphotypes have been observed to infect E. ictaluri from pond
water enrichment experiments. A genomic analysis of
these three phages was initiated to examine the potential
of these three bacteriophages for lysogeny, to ensure
they did not harbor virulence or toxin genes and to better understand the genetic basis of their host specificity
[7]. This study represents the first genomic analysis of
bacteriophages specific to Edwardsiella ictaluri, and will
expand scientific understanding of phage biology, and
genomic information [11].

Results and Discussion
Genome characteristics

Total sequence coverage for the eiMSLS assembly was
9.8X, while coverage for the eiAU and eiDWF assemblies exceeded 30X. The genomes of phages eiAU,
eiDWF, and eiMSLS are 42.80 kbp, 42.12 kbp, and 42.69
kbp, respectively. The % GC content is 55.37%, 55.54%,
and 55.77% for phage eiAU, eiDWF, and eiMSLS,
respectively, and is similar to the 57% GC content of
host E. ictaluri genome reference strain (GenBank
accession NC 012779). No tRNA genes were detected in
the genome of any of the three phages. This is unlike
several members of the Siphoviridae family that carry
tRNA genes [12].
Open Reading Frame (ORF) analysis

A total of 54 ORFs were predicted for phage eiAU (Table
1), while 52 ORFs were predicted for eiDWF and 52

Page 3 of 12

ORFs for eiMSLS. Based on sequence similarity (E value
< 0.001), 40 out of 54 (74%), 37 out of 52 (71%) and 36
out of 52 (69%) of the ORFs for phages eiAU, eiDWF,
and eiMSLS, respectively, share significant sequence
similarity to known protein sequences contained in the
GenBank nr/nt database (Table 1). Of the ORFs with significant sequence similarity to sequences in GenBank,
putative functions could only be assigned to 21 out of 40
(53%), 21 out of 37 (57%) and 20 out of 36 (56%) for
phages eiAU, eiDWF, and eiMSLS, respectively. Positions, sizes, sequence homologies and putative functions
for each predicted ORF are presented in Table 1.
The genome of phage eiAU contains several overlapping predicted ORFs, which can be an indication of
translational coupling or programmed translational frameshifts [13]. Twelve possible sequence frameshifts
were predicted in the eiAU genome sequence. Interestingly, one of these frameshifts is conserved in tail
assembly genes of dsDNA phages [14]. In dsDNA phage
genomes the order of the tail genes is highly conserved,
most notably the major tail protein is always encoded
upstream of the gene encoding the tape measure protein
[14]. Between these two genes, two overlapping ORFs
are commonly found that have a translational frameshift
[15]. A similar organization of tail genes is observed in
phage eiAU, in which two ORFs (22 and 23) lie between
the putative phage tape tail measure protein gene
(ORF21) and the major tail protein (ORF24) (Table 1).
Similarly, phage eiAU contains a frameshift in the two
overlapping ORFs between the phage tail measure and
the major tail protein. In other phages both of these
proteins are required for tail assembly even though they
are not part of the mature tail structure [14].
Overall Genome Organization and Comparison

A schematic representation of one of these phages
(eiAU) shows that ORFs in these three phages are organized into two groups; early genes (DNA replication)
that are encoded on one strand and the late genes
(head, tail, and lysis) that are encoded on the complementary strand (Figure 1). Whole genome comparisons
revealed that phages eiAU, eiDWF, and eiMSLS have
conserved synteny (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The overall
genetic organization of the eiAU, eiDWF, and eiMSLS
genomes, typically consisting of “DNA packaging-headtail-tail fiber-lysis/lysogeny-DNA replication-transcriptional regulation” modules is shared by many phage
within the Siphoviridae family [16].
Multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed that the
eiAU, eiDWF, and eiMSLS genomes are >95% identical
at the nucleotide level (Figure 2). Similarly, a high
degree of sequence similarity has been observed in the
genomes of recently sequence bacteriophages that infect
Campylobacter [17], Eschericia coli [18], and also many

phage replicative helicase/primease
[Enterobacteria phage]

Mycobacterium spp. [19]. The high similarity of some
phage genomes that infect a single host species suggests
that certain phage lineages may be stable over time and
over distant geographic areas [17]. This observation may
likely be clarified once additional genome sequences of
phages infecting a common host such as E. ictaluri
become available.
Comparison of head morphogenesis and structural
proteins

Genome sequencing of tailed phages and prophages has
revealed a common genetic organization of the genes
encoding head morphogenesis and head structural
proteins. These gene systems are typically organized as follows: ‘terminase - portal - protease - scaffold - major head
shell (coat) protein - head/tail-joining proteins - tail shaft
protein - tape measure protein - tail tip/base plate proteins
- tail fiber’ (listed in the order of transcription) [20]. Phages
eiAU, eiDWF, and eiMSLS follow a similar organization of
genes encoding head morphogenesis and structural proteins, although the direction is reversed in relation to their
order of transcription (Figure 1 and Table 1).
The module containing head morphogenesis and tail
structure proteins in phage eiAU is the largest module,
and is predicted to contain 22 ORFs (ORF14-ORF35).
The consecutive ORFs 14 to 32 have significant

sequence similarity with phage head morphogenesis and
structural proteins, with putative function in tail assembly (ORFs 14, 17, and 18), tail fiber protein (ORF 15),
phage host specificity (ORF 16), minor tail proteins
(ORFs 19-21), major tail proteins (ORFs 24 and 25),
major capsid proteins (ORF 29), structural proteins
(ORFs 27, 30 and 33), and a phage head morphogenesis
protein (ORF32) (Table 1). ORFs 28, 26, 23, and 22
could not be linked to a putative function based on
BLAST search or any other similarity searches. However, all of these ORFs with the exception of ORF28
have sequence similarity to proteins identified within
other phage genomes (Table 1). The protein products of
ORF34 and ORF35 may encode large and small terminase subunits, respectively. ORF34 is predicted to
encode the terminase large subunit. The top BLAST hit
for ORF35 is the protein Gp1 encoded by Sodalis phage
SO-1; however, it is possible that ORF 35 encodes a
small terminase subunit as there is limited sequence
similarity to a putative terminase small subunit from
Listonella phage phiHSIC. This indicates that these
E. ictaluri phages, similarly to most dsDNA viruses, use
a DNA packaging motor consisting of two nonstructural
proteins (the large and small terminase subunits)
encoded by adjacent genes [21]. Most known terminase
enzymes have a small subunit that specifically binds the

represent corresponding reading frames.

viral DNA and the large subunit with endonuclease
activity for DNA cleavage and an ATPase activity that
powers DNA packaging [22,23].
No hit for a portal protein or for a protease was obtained
either by BLAST or by HmmPfam searches. ORF33 is the
most likely candidate for a portal protein based on the
observation that the portal protein is generally located
immediately downstream of the terminase gene [13].
Lytic Cassette

The lytic cassette of phage eiAU is predicted to be
encoded by ORFs 36-39. ORF36 encodes a predicted
endolysin, and a putative holin protein is encoded by
ORF39. All dsDNA phages studied to date use two
enzymes to lyse their host, an endolysin which degrades
cell wall peptidoglycan and a holin which permeabilizes
the cell membrane [21]. These two proteins work in conjunction to destroy the cell wall of bacteria and subsequently lyse the cell [24]. These components of a host
lysis cassette are each present in the genome of phages
eiAU, eiDWF, and eiMSLS including a putative Rz lysis
accessory protein encoded by ORF38 (Table 1.). The RZ
protein is predicted to be a type II integral membrane
protein and its function, although not fully understood,
may be required for host cell lysis only in a medium containing an excess of divalent cations [25]. Phage endolysins have been linked to five enzymatic activities,
including an N-acetyl muramidase or “true lysosyme”,
the lytic transglycosylases, the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases, the endo- b-N-acetylglucosaminidases,
and the endopeptidases [26]. Secondary structure analysis
predicts that the endolysin of eiAU is a member of the
N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases class of endolysins.
DNA replication proteins

ORFs with significant sequence similarity to proteins
involved in DNA replication were identified in all three E.

ictaluri-specific phage genomes. ORF44 is predicted to
encode a phage replicative helicase/primease. Several
phages use separate primase and helicase proteins while
others use a multifunctional protein (primase/helicase)
possessing both activities [13]. The helicase/primase protein works in DNA replication by unwinding double
stranded DNA into single stranded DNA [27]. No predicted function could be assigned to ORFs45 and 46. Also,
no predicted function could be assigned to ORF47; however, a search for secondary structures within the predicted ORF47 amino acid sequence detected a helixhairpin-helix DNA binding motif. Additionally, no putative function could be assigned to ORF48, ORF49, or
ORF50. ORF51 had as one of its top BLAST hits an isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase known to function in methylating isoprenylated amino acids [28]. ORF52
is predicted to encode a protein similar to gp41 of Sodalis
phage SO-1, but no putative function could be assigned.
ORF53 is predicted to encode DNA polymerase I. Secondary structure analysis suggested that the DNA polymerase
encoded by ORF53 contains a domain that is responsible
for the 3’-5’ exonuclease proof-reading activity of E. coli
DNA polymerase I and other enzymes, and catalyses the
hydrolysis of unpaired or mismatched nucleotides. The
protein encoded by ORF54 is predicted to have a VURNUC domain, which are associated with members of the
PD-(D/E) XK nuclease superfamily such as type III restriction modification enzymes. ORF2 is predicted to encode a
DNA repair ATPase. A search for secondary structures
within the ORF2 predicted amino acid sequence revealed
a HNH endonuclease. No putative function could be
assigned to ORF3. ORF4 is predicted to encode a helicase
protein belonging to the SNF2 family, commonly found in
proteins involved in a variety of processes including transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA recombination,
and chromatin unwinding [29]. ORF6 is predicted to
encode a phage methyltransferase. Secondary structure

analysis revealed that the methyltransferase predicted to
be encoded by ORF6 is a C-5 cytosine-specific DNA
methylase which in bacteria is a component of restrictionmodification systems. Also, Mg+ and ATP binding sites
were detected in the predicted protein product of ORF6.
ORF7 is predicted to encode a DNA N-6-adenine-methyltransferase within a family of methyltransferase found in
bacteria and phage that has site specific DNA methyltransferase activity [30].
No ORF encoding an RNA polymerase was detected
in any of the phages suggesting that these phages rely
on the host RNA polymerase to transcribe their genes.
This is further corroborated by the observation that no
phage-encoded transcription factor was detected in the
genome of these phages.

and ORF7 are predicted to encode a phage methyltransferase and a DNA N-6-adenine-methyltransferase
respectively, while in phage eiDWF and eiMSLS only
one larger ORF encoding a phage methyltransferase was
predicted. Similarly, two methyltransferases are present
in the genomes of one of two highly similar Campylobacter phages [17]. The authors suggest that the two
methyltransferases may enable the phage to avoid DNA
restriction in some strains through DNA methylation.
This may help explain the differences observed in host
range for the Campylobacter phages [17] as well as differences observed in host specificity of the E. ictaluri
phages [7]. Hence, these methyltransferases may likely
be involved in DNA methylation as a means of avoiding
the restriction endonuclease (s) of E. ictaluri.

Comparison of ORFs among phages eiAU, eiDWF,
and eiMSLS

Classification of phages eiAU, eiDWF, and eiMSLS

The three phage genomes revealed extensive homology
and limited variability in their gene sequence (Figure 2).
The percent identity and percent similarity of each ORF
within the three phage genomes (data not shown)
revealed that differences exist mainly in predicted ORFs
that have no significant sequence similarity to sequences
in GenBank database and also to ORFs encoding structural proteins (primarily the tail fiber genes). ORF14 (117
AA) is predicted to encode a phage tail fiber assembly
protein/tail assembly chaperone, and in eiAU and eiDWF
it is 100% identical, yet it is not present in eiMSLS.
ORF15 (335 AA) is predicted to encode a tail fiber protein and is present in all three phages, with 100% identity
in eiAU and eiDWF, however, it only has 58% identity to
its counterpart in eiMSLS. ORF21 (900 AA) is predicted
to encode a phage tail tape measure protein and is present in all three phages at approximately 95% identity at
the amino acid level. ORF23 (118 AA) is predicted to
encode a protein homologous to gp15 [Sodalis phage
SO-1] which is a structural protein that plays a role in
cell membrane penetration. This ORF is present in all
three phages with 83% identity at the amino acid level.
ORF24 (200 AA) is predicted to encode a major tail protein and is present in all three phages, with 100% identity
between eiDWF and eiMSLS, and with only 90% identity
between those two phage and the ORF counterpart in
eiAU. Sequence differences in these structural proteins
may help explain the differences observed in the efficiency of these phages to form plaques on various E. ictaluri strains [7]. Most of the structural proteins described
above are expected to be involved in phage infectivity
such as adsorption of the phage to the bacterial cell
(ORFs 14 and 15), phage tail length (ORF21), and cell
membrane penetration (ORF23).
Differences were also observed in the ORFs encoding
the putative methyltransferases. In phage eiAU, ORF6

The majority of the top BLAST hits for these phage
genomes are to proteins belonging to lytic phages,
including Yersinia phage PY100, Salmonella phage c341,
and Enterobacteria phage HK97 (Table 1.). All of the
components of a phage lysis cassette (endolysin, holin,
and a lysis accessory protein) were detected in these
phages and no sequence similarity to lysogenic phages
or to any component that is associated with lysogeny
such as integrase/recombination associated enzymes,
repressor proteins, and anti-repressor proteins [31] were
detected. These data along with results documenting the
lytic capabilities of these phages [7] all indicate that
these phages lack mechanisms for integration into the
DNA of their host and that they are virulent phages
without the capacity for lysogeny. Additionally, none of
the predicted proteins have similarities to known bacterial pathogenicity factors. These observations indicate
that these phages lack any lysogenic or bacterial virulence-inducing capacity that would preclude their potential use as therapeutic agents.
Taxonomic classification of these E. ictaluri-specific
phages must rely upon a synthesis of morphological and
genomic information, considering that phage evolution
has been profoundly directed by lateral gene transfer
[32], and that a rational hierarchical system of phage
classification should be based on the degree of DNA
and protein sequence identity for multiple genetic loci
[33]. Gene modules that have been proposed for using
as basis of a phage taxonomy system include the DNA
packaging-head gene cluster, the structural gene architecture, and phage tail genes (excluding the tail fiber
genes) [16].
A comparison of phage eiAU to Enterobacteria phage
SSL-2009a was conducted due to the large number of
significant BLAST hits between ORFs in the E. ictaluri
phage genomes and those respective ORFs within the
genome of phage SSL-2009a, which are on average

34.1% identical at the nucleotide level. A comparative
genomic analysis between the genome of phage eiAU
and that of phage SSL-2009a revealed that genome
regions encoding many putative structural and replication proteins are shared by both phages (Figure 2). The
predicted gene products with sequence similarity
between the eiAU and SSL-2009a phage genomes
include the putative minor tail proteins/tail tape measure, major tail proteins, major capsid proteins, head
morphogenesis, phage terminase small subunit, and the
phage terminase large subunit. Interestingly, other structural proteins including the host specificity proteins, the
tail assembly proteins, and particularly the tail fiber/
baseplate protein which has been recommended for
exclusion in any sequence based phage taxonomy
scheme [33] are not shared between the two genomes.
Phylogeny based on multiple genetic loci

The genetic conservation observed in the structural proteins between phage eiAU and Enterobacteria phage
SSL-2009a led us to further investigate the relatedness
of these E. ictaluri phages and other enterobacteria
phage, based on specific phage genetic loci. The amino
acid sequences of one of the conserved structural proteins (large terminase subunit) as well as one of the non
structural proteins (DNA polymerase I) were chosen for
phylogenetic analysis. The large terminase subunit
which is a structural protein is along with the portal
protein considered the most universally conserved gene
sequence in phages [20], hence they are good options to
aid in phage classification. Phylogenetic analysis based
on the large terminase subunit amino acid sequence
(Figure 3) and the DNA polymerase I amino acid
sequence (Figure 4) of eiAU reveal that phages eiAU,
eiDWS, and eiMSLS were most similar to phage that
infect other enterobacteria (Enterobacteria phage SSL2009a) and Sodalis glossinidius (Sodalis phage SO-1).
These two phages are dsDNA viruses belonging to the
Caudovirales order, one being a Siphoviridae (Sodalis
phage SO-1) (NCBI accession # NC_013600) and the
other an unclassified member of the Caudovirales
(Enterobacteria phage SSL-2009a) (NCBI accession #
NC_012223). The overall genomic organization of the
three new phages is shared by many members of the
Siphoviridae family of phages sequenced to date [16],
and is supported by the previously described morphology of these phages [7].

Conclusion
This is the first genomic analysis of bacteriophages that
infect the bacterial pathogen E. ictaluri. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple phage gene products suggests that these
phages are similar to those that infect other Enterobacteria
hosts. The bioinformatic analysis of the genomes of these

three E. ictaluri-specific bacteriophages corroborate previously published data that indicates that these bacteriophages are lytic, and lack any mechanism for lysogenic
conversion of their host. Additionally, none of the predicted proteins have similarities to known bacterial

pathogenicity factors or to toxin genes. Even though these
three bacteriophages were isolated in different geographic
locations within the natural range of catfish over twenty
years apart, they are remarkably similar to each other at a
genomic level. This genomic analysis suggests that these
phages are members of a lineage that is highly stable over
time and geographic regions. The information obtained
from the analyses of these bacteriophage genomes will
facilitate their diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Methods
Bacteriophages and bacterial strains

Phages jeiAU and jeiDWF used in the study were originally isolated and characterized at Auburn University
[7]. Phage jMSLS was isolated from an aquaculture
pond water sample on a lawn of E. ictaluri strain I49
(Thad Cocharan National Warmwater Aquaculture
Center, Aquatic Diagnostic Lab), and clear plaques were
doubly purified on an E. ictaluri host. Host bacterial
isolate E. ictaluri strain 219 was obtained from the
Southeastern Cooperative Fish Disease Laboratory at
Auburn University. E. ictaluri strains were grown on
Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium and cryopreserved
in BHI containing 10% glycerol at -80°C. In each experiment bacterial strains were grown from the original
glycerol stock to maintain low passage number, virulent
E. ictaluri cultures.
Isolation of phage DNA

Phages eiAU, eiDWF, and eiMSLS were propagated on
E. ictaluri strain 219 using a standard soft agar overlay
method [34]. Phages were harvested by flooding plates
with 5 mL SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM
MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 50 mM Tris-Cl (1 M, pH 7.5), and
0.002% (w/v) of 2% Gelatin), incubating at 30°C while
shaking for 6 h, and then collecting the buffer-phage
solution. Collected phage suspensions were treated for
10 min with 1% (v/v) chloroform to lyse bacterial cells,
subjected to centrifugation at 3,600× g for 25 min, and
then filtered through a 0.22 μm filter to remove cell
debris. Phage solutions were purified over a cesium
chloride gradient and concentrated by precipitation with
polyethylene glycol 8000. Concentrated phage particles
were resuspended in 200 μl SM buffer. Free nucleic
acids from lysed bacterial host cells were degraded with
250 units of benzonase endonuclease for 2 h at 37°C,
after which the benzonase was inhibited by the addition
of 10 mM EDTA. The phage protein coats were
degraded using proteinase K (1 mg/ml) and SDS (1%). A
phenol-chloroform extraction was performed, and DNA
was precipitated with ethanol. The washed DNA pellet
was resuspended in T10 E1 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 1 mM EDTA) and stored at -20°C.

Shotgun library construction and sequencing

Shotgun subclone libraries were constructed at Lucigen
Corporation (Middleton, WI) as previously described
[35]. Briefly, phage genomic DNA was randomly
sheared using a Hydroshear instrument (Digilab Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) and DNA fragments
from 1 to 3 kb in size were extracted from an agarose
gel. Phage DNA fragments were blunt-end repaired,
ligated to asymmetric adapters, amplified using a proof
reading polymerase and ligated into the pSMART® GC
cloning vector following manufacturer recommendations. The ligation was transfected into electrocompetent E. coli cells. E. coli transformants were robotically
picked into Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 30 ug
per ml kanamycin and 10% (w/v) glycerol in a 96-well
format using a QPix2 colony picking system (Genitex
Limited, Hampshire, UK). Colony PCR was performed
on a representative number of clones (n = 10) to assess
insert size and the percentage of subclones containing
an insert. Plasmid DNA was isolated using standard
alkaline-SDS lysis and ethanol precipitation. Alternately,
the insert was amplified from the E. coli clone glycerol
stock using a pSMART vector-specific primer set, with
30 cycles of amplification (95°C denaturation, 50°C
annealing, and 72°C extension). The resultant PCR products were treated with exonuclease I and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase to remove oligonucleotides. Sanger
sequencing from both ends of the insert was obtained
using ABI PRISM BigDye™ 3.1 Terminators chemistry
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and sequencing
products were resolved on an ABI 3130XL capillary
electrophoresis instrument.
Contig assembly and primer walking

Raw sequence data from eiMSLS was re-assembled
using LaserGene software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,
WI). The eiMSLS sequence was used as a reference for
alignment of eiAU and eiDWF sequences. For the latter two genomes, raw sequence data was trimmed for
quality and vector sequence was removed using
Sequencher™ software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann
Arbor, MI). Contigs were re-assembled using CromasPro v.1.42 (Technelysium Pty, Tewantin, Australia)
using 70% sequence match, and a minimum of 30 bp
overlap. Contigs were manually edited to remove
nucleotide gaps and mis-called bases. Closure of each
respective phage genome was completed by primer
walking using either the isolate phage DNA or amplified products as the sequencing template. Each phage
was determined to have a circular genome by PCR
amplification using primers directed out from the ends
of the single large contig comprising the respective
phage genome.

Genome sequence analysis

Open reading frames were identified using a GeneMark
heuristic approach for gene prediction in prokaryotes,
which is specifically designed for small virus, plasmid, or
phage genomes less than 50 kb in size [36]. Additionally,
GLIMMER 3.02, and NCBI’s ORF Finder [37] were utilized to corroborate the predicted ORFs obtained from
GenMark analysis. The % GC content of phages was calculated using geecee [38]. The tRNAscan-SE v.1.21 program was used to search for tRNA genes [39]; [40].
Gene function was predicted by comparing each phage
ORF sequence against the GenBank nr/nt sequence
database using the BLASTp and BLASTn [41] search
algorithms. Iterative PSI-BLAST analysis was used to
increase sensitivity of detecting homologous genes for
ORFs resulting in hits with low E-values. Searches for
secondary structures (profiles, patterns, blocks, motifs,
and protein families) were performed using a web server
[42]. Frameshifts were detected using FrameD [43]. The
amino acid identity (AAI) of predicted protein
sequences was determined by pairwise BLASTp analysis
of each set of phage homologs. Dotplots were generated
using the DOTMATCHER tool from EMBOSS (Ian
Longden, Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK). Pairwise
global alignment and graphical representation of phage
genomes was performed using the CGView server using
tBLASTx with an E-value cutoff of 0.001 [44]. Genome
sequences were annotated using the Artemis software
package (The Institute for Genomic Research), and all
sequences were deposited in the GenBank database
(accession # HQ824548-HQ824705) using Sequin.
Phylogenetic analysis

The predicted amino acid sequences for phage terminase large subunit and DNA polymerase were used to
conduct a phylogenetic analysis of these E. ictaluri bacteriophages. The amino acid sequence for each predicted protein was aligned with a collection of
homologous sequences using the program ClustalW2
[45]. ClustalW2 multiple alignments were exported to
Mega4 [46] and a maximum parsimony analysis was
used to construct a phylogenetic tree, with bootstrap
support (n = 1000 replicates).
