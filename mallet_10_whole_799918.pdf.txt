Whole genome evaluation of horizontal transfers
in the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus
Ludovic V Mallet1, Jennifer Becq2, Patrick Deschavanne1*

Abstract
Background: Numerous cases of horizontal transfers (HTs) have been described for eukaryote genomes, but in
contrast to prokaryote genomes, no whole genome evaluation of HTs has been carried out. This is mainly due to a
lack of parametric methods specially designed to take the intrinsic heterogeneity of eukaryote genomes into
account. We applied a simple and tested method based on local variations of genomic signatures to analyze the
genome of the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.
Results: We detected 189 atypical regions containing 214 genes, accounting for about 1 Mb of DNA sequences.
However, the fraction of atypical DNA detected was smaller than the average amount detected in the same
conditions in prokaryote genomes (3.1% vs 5.6%). It appeared that about one third of these regions contained no
annotated genes, a proportion far greater than in prokaryote genomes. When analyzing the origin of these HTs by
comparing their signatures to a home made database of species signatures, 3 groups of donor species emerged:
bacteria (40%), fungi (25%), and viruses (22%). It is to be noticed that though inter-domain exchanges are
confirmed, we only put in evidence very few exchanges between eukaryotic kingdoms.
Conclusions: In conclusion, we demonstrated that HTs are not negligible in eukaryote genomes, bearing in mind
that in our stringent conditions this amount is a floor value, though of a lesser extent than in prokaryote genomes.
The biological mechanisms underlying those transfers remain to be elucidated as well as the biological functions
of the transferred genes.

Background
Horizontal transfers in eukaryotes

Horizontal transfers (HTs) are a major force of evolution in prokaryotes [1-5]. The average amount of DNA
transferred in prokaryote genomes varies from 0 to 17%
according to different studies [4,6-8]. The transferred
genes remaining in the genome either increase fitness or
allow the colonization of new environments [2,3,9-11].
However, the extent of HT in eukaryotes is less known
though they were proposed to play a role as important
as for prokaryotes [12-19]. In fact, most of the documented cases concern insertions of viruses (especially
retroviruses) into eukaryote genomes [20-23] and
exchanges between symbiont, parasite [18,24] or organelle genomes [25,26] and their host genome. At last, as
conjugation between distant species is unlikely by

meiosis, a possibility of transfer between eukaryotes was
evoked by gene introgression following hybridization
between closely related species [27].
For the former examples, the biological mechanisms
are understood, demonstrated or are hypotheses with
strong support. However the mechanisms involved in
DNA exchanges between distant species are mostly
unknown, either between eukaryotes or to explain the
numerous reports of HTs between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. Among the mechanisms acting in prokaryotes, transformation by free DNA is possible for eukaryotes but is less efficient than it is for prokaryotes [28].
Transduction was hypothesized but its efficiency differs
as a function of species families from possible to unlikely by lack of vectors [29]. Also, alternative mechanisms were suggested, like phagocytosis or by means of
bacterial type IV secretion systems that could promote
the transfer of DNA from prokaryotes to eukaryotes
[13,30]. Thus, while HT results are observed, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be discovered.

Choice of a HT detecting method for A. fumigatus

The HT detection methods generally used in eukaryotes
are based on gene homology. The determination method
depends on the number of homologs of the target and of
its phylogenetic distribution. In the case of the detection
by Blast of only a few homologs for a gene of interest, an
alignment analysis showing more homology with genes/
proteins of distant species than to a closer one indicates
a horizontal transfer event for this gene. A typical example of such detection is to find a close prokaryotic homolog to a eukaryotic gene [31-34]. A more reliable method
can be used in the case of numerous homologs and their
broad distribution in the evolution tree. In this latter
case, a phylogenetic analysis is performed and incongruence in the phylogenetic tree leads to a similar conclusion [35,36]. In each of these cases, the study concerns
only a peculiar gene or a small group of genes [37-42].
Indeed, due to the restrictions exposed above, a fair number of genes cannot be analyzed this way: ORFans of
course but also genes with only one or a small number of
homologs leading to an inconclusive situation. Moreover,
due to the patchiness of eukaryote sequences in Genbank, it is difficult to assess horizontal transfer between
eukaryotes species [43], while it is easier to assess transfers between prokaryote and eukaryote species [14].
However, many newly sequenced genomes were analyzed
for horizontally transferred genes (HGT) and in some
cases a large number of HGTs were detected by phylogenetic analyzes (for instance 587 genes - 5.6% of all genes
- were found of bacterial origin in the diatom P. tricornutum [44]). Therefore, while a high number of genes could
be found of alien origin, these studies, as discussed
above, could not be qualified as whole genome studies.
In order to analyze whole genomes and to cope with
the difficulties discussed previously, the so-called parametric methods were designed. They are based either on
the whole set of genes of a species or on variations of
the composition characteristics of the genomic sequence
itself. Methods using gene information are based on differences in codon usage between highly expressed, lowly
expressed and alien genes [45-48]. However, none of the
methods based on codon usage can be applied to eukaryote genomes as gene regulation is different from prokaryotes and no tool has been designed to cope with
this fact [47,48].
The other methods are based on the variations of base
composition detected by different order Markov models
along a genome: the so-called genomic signature
[49,50]. This genomic signature was demonstrated to be
species-specific and quite similar all along the genome
[50-54]. This species-specificity was used to detect horizontally transferred DNA by analyzing a genome and
searching for regions exhibiting a different signature
than the majority of the genome [4,6-8,55-65]. These

Page 2 of 13

methods use only the information contained in the analyzed genome and when applied to the whole genome
sequence they allow the detection of atypical regions
containing no annotated genes [6,61].
Phylogenetic and parametric methods, while detecting
common genes, diverge in certain cases. It was proposed
that these two types of methods addressed different
types of HGTs [66,67]. It was proposed that combining
signature and gene based methods increased either specificity or sensitivity of HT detection [33,58,68].
In general, when compared to prokaryotic genomes,
eukaryote genomes are larger and more complex due to
the presence of non-coding sequences, low complexity
regions, isochores and fragmented genes. Therefore,
most of the parametric methods used for prokaryotes
are either inefficient or not suitable to eukaryotic genomes. Likewise, methods based on variations of the G
+C composition work poorly due to the intrinsic variations of base composition in eukaryote genomes [69].
For these reasons, no genome-wide study of horizontal
transfers in an eukaryotic genome using parametric
methods was published. However, some eukaryotic genomes present characteristics close to prokaryotic ones
and allow attempting the use of parametric methods on
them. For instance, it has been shown that variation of
short oligonucleotide usage is moderate in some fungi
genomes and that parametric methods based on this
type of criterion could be applied to them [50,70,71].
Moreover, HTs seem to play an important role in the
evolution of fungi [29,72-75]. Therefore, we chose to
analyze the extent of horizontal transfers in the genome
of Aspergillus fumigatus [76-78]. A. fumigatus is a
pathogenic fungus causing a wide range of diseases
including mycotoxicosis, systemic diseases and allergic
reactions. The mortality rate is high in infected patients,
especially in immuno-compromised ones. Here we propose to use a simple and tested method based on short
oligonucleotide usage [6] to evaluate the amount of HTs
in the genome of Aspergillus fumigatus.
We found that HTs in fungi are not negligible,
accounting for 1 Mb, representing about 3% of the genome and that donor species belong mainly to 3 classes,
bacteria, fungi and viruses.

Methods
Genome

The Aspergillus fumigatus Af293 genome (Genbank
NC_007194 - NC_007201) [78] has a size of 29.4 Mb
and is composed of 8 chromosomes. Its base composition is balanced: G+C% = 49.8%.
HT detection method

We used a method based on the variations of tetranucleotide frequencies along a sequence. The method was

Mallet et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:171
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/171

already described and tested on prokaryotic genomes
and the principles are recalled hereafter [6]. The specificities of eukaryotic genomes implied a pretreatment and
in a first step, we removed from the genome all the centromeric and telomeric low complexity regions which
exhibited an atypical signature and did not correspond
to transferred DNA. The genome was subsequently analyzed by a 5 kb sliding window, with a step of 500 bp.
The signature of each window was calculated and the
Euclidian distance of every window signature to the
whole genome signature was assessed. Then, the window signatures were clustered by a k-means algorithm
and a partition based on the distance distributions per
class and the average distances of the classes to the genome was performed. In a previous work with prokaryotic genomes, less than 8 classes (average 4 [6]) were
required to take into account the intrinsic genome variation and the atypical signatures. Due to an increased
intrinsic variation of base composition in eukaryote genomes, the number of classes was raised to 20 for the
A. fumigatus genome. The partition separated the kmeans classes into one group exhibiting rather homogeneous signatures whose distance to the whole genome
signature was small (90% of the windows) and one
group of heterogeneous classes with a large distance to
the genome signature (10% of windows). Thus, we considered that the first group of classes represents the host
genome and calculated the average signature of this host
genome. The Euclidian distances of all the window signatures were recalculated with regards to this new host
signature. Afterwards, taking into account only the windows of this putative host genome, we established a
threshold equal to the 99% percentile of the Euclidian
distance to the host genome. All the windows whose
signature exhibited a distance above this threshold were
considered atypical and potentially corresponding to foreign DNA. We chose a high threshold in order to favor
specificity rather than sensitivity.
Atypical region analysis

All genes included in the atypical regions were analyzed:
we investigated their functions and compared them to
Genbank by BlastP (E-value ≤ 10-10 and coverage ≥ 80%)
in order to identify the closest homologous sequences if
any. For atypical regions containing no annotated coding
sequences, a BlastX analysis (E-value ≤ 10-1) was done in
order to identify remnants of coding sequences and a
BlastN (E-value ≤ 10 -1 ) to find homology at the DNA
level.
Phylogenetic analysis

Protein sequences from the Blast analysis were aligned
by ClustalW [79]. The trees (neighbor joining algorithm
[80]) were bootstrapped (1000 trees) and the consensus

Page 3 of 13

trees calculated with the Philip package [81]. Species
trees were inferred by retaining only one homolog per
species (the best strain or the best homolog, the less significant paralogs were discarded).
Donor species

We have derived and updated Genstyle, a database of
species signatures [82]. Our database contains about
65,000 signatures of species strains, organelles, viruses
and plasmids. It was composed as following: for each
entry, all non redundant sequences longer or equal to 1
kb were gathered from Genbank then concatenated for
signature calculation. We calculated the signature of each
atypical region and searched the database for the closest
signatures in terms of Euclidian distance. As genomic signatures are species-specific [6,50,52-54,83-85], the species with the closest signatures could be considered as
potential donors of the atypical regions only if the distances obtained were below the average threshold used
for HT detection (241 AU) [6].

Results
Atypical regions

In a first step, we checked that as already shown for
other eukaryotes [71] all chromosomes of A. fumigatus
presented a similar signature and intrinsic variability.
The concatenated sequence of the 8 chromosomes was
then used to establish the threshold. The study of the
signature variations along the genome allowed for the
distinguishing of 189 distinct atypical regions (Figure 1,
Additional file 1). They represented 3.1% of the total
genome (908 kb, Table 1). The average size of the atypical regions was 4.5 kb, ranging from 500 bp to 52.5 kb.
In general, the atypical regions were spread along all
chromosomes indicating no chromosome preference for
foreign DNA insertions (Figure 1, Table 2).
HT distribution on chromosomes

Though all chromosomes contained atypical regions
some seemed to exhibit a particular distribution like a
sub-telomeric trend on chromosome 4 or an underrepresentation on the short arm of chromosome 2. We
also denoted that in some cases, atypical regions were
physically clustered as it can be seen at position 2.3 Mb
of chromosome 6 (c6r14-c6r23, representing 53 kb of
atypical sequences out of 107 kb of genomic DNA)
(Figure 1, Table 2).
Content of atypical regions

The 189 atypical regions detected can be divided into
two groups: those containing annotated genes (134) and
those with no coding features (55). A total of 214 annotated genes are encoded in the atypical regions. We
checked by BlastP if new homologs were sequenced

since the genome analysis [76,78]. Most of these genes
exhibited homologous counterparts (Additional files 1
and 2) with the exception of ORFans. The ORFans can
be divided in 2 classes: 16 genes from A. fumigatus have
no homologs at all in GenBank and 5 have a homolog
only in N. fischieri a very close neighbor of A. fumigatus.
The functions of 81 transferred genes are unknown.
Considering the other 133 genes, a function is inferred
for 39 of them and a putative one for the 94 others
(Additional file 3). The majority of them (91; 68%)
belong to central and intermediate metabolism. We
detected few genes involved in virulence [78,86] among
the horizontally transferred genes although this means
of virulence spreading was already demonstrated for
pathogenic fungi [16,72,87,88]. We detected a few genes
proposed to play a role in pathogenicity: 1 lipase, 4 peptide transporters [89], 5 genes of gliotoxin synthesis
involved in virulence [90,91] and two genes coding for
allergenic proteins. Also, we observed a high number of
mobile elements detected in the atypical regions. Alongside the 214 genes, we found 129 transposons belonging
to 5 families: Copia, Gypsy, hAT, Line and DDE1. In
some cases, these transposons are clustered in a single
region (Additional file 1, see c2p24, c4p18 or c6p2 for
instance). We checked the signatures of mobile elements
and found that they exhibited a signature close to that
of the host genome and so were not the cause of the
detection of the region but more likely markers of the
transfer events [92].
Fifty-five atypical regions lacked annotated genes.
Despite this, a BlastX and BlastN analyses allowed to
propose the presence of gene relics in 24 (47%) of these
regions (Table 3). Besides some rRNA genes (regions
c4r5 and c4r6), supposedly not transferred but detected
by the method, and transposons, we found pseudogenes
of nuclear or mitochondrial origin and plasmid parts.
Figure 2 shows an example of such a region containing
both transposons and a pseudogene. The large numbers
of transposons contained in these regions (Table 3) supports their status of horizontally transferred regions

It is possible from the BlastP analysis to get an indication of the donor species except for the ORFans
(Table 4, Additional file 2) or genes/proteins with few
homologs. The majority of the homologs detected originated only from fungal species (56%). It is to be noted
that 16 genes are specific of A. fumigatus (no homolog
in other fungal species). All the other genes had homologs in at least one or the other Aspergillus sp. or Neosartorya fischeri (a very close relative of A. fumigatus
[91]). This supports the view that most of the transfer
events occurred before the Aspergillus speciation. For
instance out of the 120 genes exhibiting homologs
mainly in fungi, 18 (15% not taking into account the
ORFans) had homologs only in Aspergillus sp. or in N.
fischeri. However the patchiness of the Aspergillus species represented by the different genes suggests numerous rearrangements and gene losses in these species.
Another point is that some genes had homologs only in
N. fischeri (5, Table 4) confirming the very close relationship between A. fumigatus and N. fischeri. From the
BlastP analysis, it can be noted that 19% exhibited
homologs in other domains of life; for instance, 26
genes had homologs exclusively in prokaryotes out of
the fungi homologs (Table 4). We also detected 19
homologs exclusively in other eukaryotic kingdoms
(Table 4). From this analysis it is possible, not only to
confirm the transferred status of the genes but also to
propose in peculiar cases a source of these genes. The
criterion for a confident result are a very high conservation (very low E-Value), a coverage over 90% and an
alternation of fungi species with those from other
domains or kingdoms. For instance, gene
AFUA_7G06140 possibly originates from Amoebozoa
species, gene AFUA_1G11310 from Metazoa species
and genes AFUA_1G01660, AFUA_6G09600 and
AFUA_6G09660 among others would be of Prokaryotic
origin. Other genes exhibit a more complex perturbed
evolutionary history like genes AFUA_1G05200 and
AFUA_4G14130 originating from other Eukaryotic kingdoms and some exhibit a very complex history mixing
Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic origins like genes
AFUA_1G06810, AFUA_1G10110, AFUA_2G00720,
AFUA_4G07710 or AFUA_5G10120 for instance. To
confirm the transferred status and research an origin
when the homologs were all from fungi origin or when
the origin was more difficult to ascertain, phylogenetic
trees were inferred (examples of phylogenetic trees are
shown in Figure 3 and Additional file 4)). These phylogenetic protein trees exhibited large incongruencies as

compared to their respective SSU rRNA trees. This confirmed a perturbed evolutionary history and supported
the transferred status of these genes.
It is difficult to assess the species of origin of the transferred genes from the Blast or the phylogenetic analyses
due to the bias in homologous sequenced genes.
Another way to propose a species of origin for an HT
was to benefit from the species-specificity of the genomic signature. If the horizontally transferred regions

have kept the characteristics of their species of origin,
then by comparing their genomic signature to a homemade database of species signatures, we can obtain indications about their origin. We compared the signature
of the 189 atypical regions to the database [53,82] and
for 117 of them plausible donor species could be
assigned (samples of region and of their closest neighbor
signatures are shown in Figure 4). Due to possible missassignments caused either by the representativeness of

the database or to the amelioration of the transferred
sequences [93], only broad categories of donors are
presented. Figure 5 presents the distribution of these
donor species as a function of their origin. Three major
groups of donors are identified: bacteria (40%), fungi
(25%) and viruses (22%). Among the bacteria species
two groups are over-represented: Proteobacteria and
Actinobacteria. An important point is the very small
number of exchanges between fungi and non-fungal
eukaryotes detected either from the BlastP or the signature analyses.

Discussion and Conclusion
As parametric methods were not used until now to
detect horizontal transfers in eukaryote genomes, we
used a method which requires only generic hypotheses:
i.e. a signature quite homogeneous for the major part
of the genome and a minority of regions exhibiting different signatures, these regions containing supposedly
horizontally transferred DNA sequences. A. fumigatus
is a genome of choice for this type of study, being an
intermediate genome in terms of coding density (50%
[78]) between high coding density prokaryotic genomes
(often above 95%), or lower eukaryotes (P. tetraurelia ≈
75%) and very low coding density of higher eukaryote
genomes (Homo sapiens ≈ 1.5%). Moreover, the intrinsic variability of the A. fumigatus genome is quite low
allowing the use of this type of parametric method
(Figure 1).
The parameters used here are such that we favored
specificity over sensitivity. In fact, the threshold of 99%
percentile used in the definition of the host genome is
very strict [6]. It was already shown that lowering the
threshold level while increasing sensitivity decreases
specificity such that the number of false positives
increases [6,94]. Besides, the use of sliding windows
does not allow the detection of short isolated genes
and it is recommended to use it in combination with a
gene-based method [33,58,68]. In our conditions, the
quantity of HTs detected is probably under-estimated
and could be considered, in the absence of a gold standard, as a minimum value. The Blast and phylogenetic
analyzes confirmed the transferred status of the annotated genes embedded in the detected regions (Table 4,
Additional file 2, Figure 3 and Additional file 4). These
analyzes were possible only when the number of homologs was sufficient for such an analysis. Nevertheless,
the agreement in all these methods supports the importance of horizontal transfers in A. fumigatus.
In our conditions, we were able to detect 189 regions,
accounting for 3.1% of the genome exhibiting a signature different from that of the majority of the A. fumigatus genome (Table 1). The total amount of atypical
DNA is consequent (almost 1 Mb) but with regards to

the size of the genome it is under the average percentage detected in prokaryote genomes [6-8]. For instance,
using the same method and in the same conditions,
Dufraigne et al. detected an average of 5.6% of atypical
regions for 22 prokaryote genomes as compared to the
3.1% detected here in A. fumigatus[6]. We also tested a
lower threshold 97.5% percentile [6] to evaluate its effect
on the quantity of atypical sequence detected. In this

Page 9 of 13

later case, the amount of atypical sequences of the genome accounted for 4.6%, so about a 50% increase as
compared to the 99% percentile threshold but still lower
than the amount detected in prokaryotic genomes.
There are few direct comparison data for eukaryotes
genomes as all the studies are based on Blast or phylogenetic studies and so concern only genes. For instance
in the diatom P. tricornutum, 587 genes were considered
of bacterial origin (about 6% of the total gene content
but only about 2% of the genome sequence [44]), this is
far more than the 214 annotated genes detected here in
a genome of comparable size and coding density. Gene
based methods do not take into account the whole
transfer event which could contain intergenic regions or
regions lacking annotated genes (relics of HT events)
that could bring information on genome evolution as
well as on transfer mechanisms.
Different causes could account, in the state of our
knowledge, for the apparent lower amount of transfers
in eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes. Either this is
due to differences in the mechanisms responsible for
HT in eukaryotes and prokaryotes making it biologically
more difficult in eukaryotes and so decreasing its frequency. Either, if HTs occur at the same rate in both
domains, foreign DNA is eliminated faster in eukaryote
genomes. It must also be taken into account that considering gene exchange, the transferred genes must be
selected and “ameliorated” to be expressed in a new
eukaryotic environment. The high proportion of noncoding regions could be interpreted as an accelerated
inactivation of useless genes, for instance because they
originated from other domains of life and could not be
expressed due to the differences in gene expression
machinery. This phenomenon could account for the
greater amount of detected regions lacking annotated
genes that could be in the process of elimination as supported by the presence of pseudo-genes.
The putative HTs are spread among all the eight chromosomes exhibiting no positional bias (Figure 1, Table
2). The number of HTs per chromosome is proportional
to the chromosome’ size (Table 2). However, it seems
that the average size of the transferred regions are a bit
larger inA. fumigatus than the average in 22 prokaryotes
species (4.5 kb vs 2.8 kb) [6]. Among the 189 atypical
regions detected, six were larger than 20 kb and 35
(19%) exhibited the minimum detectable size of 500 bp.
Two detected regions (c4r5 and c4r6, Table 3, Additional file 1) are possibly false positives. Indeed, they
contain rRNA and it was already shown that rRNA
exhibits a specific signature [6,61]. One region (c4r6, 3
kb) contains quite exclusively rRNA (Table 3) while the
other is an ambiguous case, it is larger (8 kb) than c4r6
and contains rRNA as well as two transposons and
could be a remnant of a horizontal transfer event or a

Mallet et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:171
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/171

composite region with an HT event close to rRNA
sequences (Table 3, Additional file 1).
For most of the genes included in the atypical regions,
it was not possible to assign a function. Indeed, we were
able to assign a putative function to 133 (62%) of the
214 atypical genes and 21 of them are ORFans. This
fraction of HGTs with a function is comparable to
recent publication where around 50% of the detected
genes have no known function [68]. It is to be noted
that 55 of the 189 atypical regions lack of annotated
genes and apart from those containing rRNA (see
above) they could be considered as remnants of HTs
(see Table 3 for those containing pseudogenes or transposons) as the original gene content was presumably of
no use for A. fumigatus. This proportion is far greater
than for prokaryotic genomes, where only a few regions
with no genes were detected [6,61]. Finally, the high
number of transposons detected in atypical regions supports their horizontally transferred status [95].
The functions of transferred genes belonged mainly
to the central and intermediate metabolism. Few
genes seemed to be involved directly in pathogenicity,
however, 5 genes (8 genes when using the 97.5%
threshold, see above) out of 10 of the gliotoxin synthesis cluster, involved in virulence are detected as
transferred. This result supports the hypothesis
already proposed on the foreign origin of this cluster
[91,96,97]. It is possible to propose a history of the
evolution of this gene cluster. The original cluster was
transferred in block to an ancestor of Aspergillus sp.
on chromosome 6, then a duplication occurred giving

Page 10 of 13

birth to a second reduced cluster on chromosome 3
(7 genes) [91]. This small cluster was “ameliorated”
(not detected) as it is often the case for duplicated
genes. The original cluster also undergoes amelioration for some genes, as it appears that some genes
cannot be detected in our conditions.
We obtained information of two different types on the
origin of the transfers in A. fumigatus: one for genes
only with the BlastP and the phylogenetic analyzes and
another for whole HT regions with the signature analysis. These results are complementary and in rather good
agreement if we take into account the fact that the first
two analyzes are based on genes and the last on
detected regions (including those with no annotated
gene). The only discrepancy concerns the fact that we
found no homologous genes in viruses (Table 4 and
Figure 5). The BlastP analysis provided two striking
facts. First, there are few horizontally transferred genes
species-specific to A. fumigatus as we found only 16
genes (≈ 4% of the annotated transferred genes) with no
homolog in other Aspergillus species nor in N. fischeri.
Second, resulting from the previous statement, all the
other genes exhibit homologous counterparts in other
Aspergillus species or in N. fischeri indicating that these
genes were transferred in a common ancestor of Aspergillus sp. and N. fischeri before the clade formation.
This is why these genes belong to the Aspergillus core
genome as defined by Fedorova et al. [76]. From the
Blast analysis, we detected only 26 genes with only
homologous counter-parts in fungi and prokaryotic genomes (Additional file 2), this number is in the lower

bound of those reported for sequenced protist genomes
by Keeling and Palmer (in “supplementary Table S1”
[19]). Complementary information is provided by the
search for the origin of the transferred regions as a
whole. First of all, it is the only way to propose an origin
for HT regions lacking annotated genes. Of course due
to amelioration processes the species proposed could be
different from the donor species. However, it was
already shown that if we don’t get the true species, we
get information on the domain, the kingdom or the
family as a function of the distance between the signature of the HT region and that of the proposed donors.
For this reason, we only took into account broad categories of species to analyze the signature data (Figure 5).
As already shown by different studies, the origin of HT
regions is diverse and encompasses all domains of life
(Figure 5) [12-14,16,24,29,72]. However, 3 groups of
donor species are dominant here: bacteria, fungi and
viruses (Figure 3). It was proposed that transduction
was unlikely for HT in fungi due to a lack of knowledge
about possible vectors [29]. Nevertheless, it appears that
22% of the donor species are viruses (Figure 5). A
hypothesis to explain this fact would be that free viral
DNA present in the environment [28] or in the intracellular compartment during phagocytosis [13,30] may be
involved in transformation the same way as in
prokaryotes.
Exchanges between eukaryotic species or between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are documented (see [29] for a
review). However, while bacteria are represented by
numerous donors belonging to Proteobacteria or Actinobacteria, archaea are seldom involved in HT in A.
fumigatus (about 3% of the donor species and few
homologs in Blast analysis, Additional file 2 and Figure
5). It is to be noted that if we proposed donor species
from other domains of life, there are very few donor
species from other eukaryotic kingdoms (only 9%, Figure
5) outside of the fungi kingdom (25%) whatever the
method used (Table 4 and Figure 5) and the next eukaryotic group are plants (around 5%). This suggests that
inter kingdom exchange of genetic material is more
restricted than from the bacterial domain. However, due
to the patchiness of the database for eukaryotic
sequences, this result could change in the future when
more sequences will be available for eukaryotic species.
We also observed HT from organelle genomes as some
mitochondrial fragments are embedded in atypical
regions (Table 3, Additional files 1 and 3).
This work opens a field of study for evaluating the
contribution of HTs to eukaryote genomes. The genomes concerned would be those presenting a low intrinsic variation, i.e. fungi, plants, lower eukaryotes, etc.
with the exception of the highly intrinsically variable
genomes of warm-blood vertebrates until appropriate

methods are designed. At last, the biological mechanisms underlying those transfers remain to be elucidated
as well as the biological role of the transferred genes.
