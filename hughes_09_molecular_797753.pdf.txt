Abstract
Background: Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is a mitochondrial anion carrier, expressed in brown
adipose tissue (BAT) of Eutherians. UCP1 is responsible for uncoupling mitochondrial proton
transport from the production of ATP, thereby dissipating heat; it is essential for non-shivering
thermogenesis (NST) in mammalian BAT. UCP1 orthologs have been identified in non-Eutherian
mammals, fish and amphibians. Yet, UCP1 has a unique function in Eutherians in that it is necessary
in the production of heat (NST). As such, this study aims to determine the evolutionary mode of
UCP1 in Eutherians, where there is clear evidence of UCP1-dependent NST in BAT.
Results: Models of adaptive evolution through phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences by
maximum likelihood were implemented to determine the mode of UCP1 protein evolution in
Eutherians. An increase in the rate of amino acid substitutions on the branch leading to Eutherians
is observed, but is best explained by relaxed constraints, not positive selection. Further, evidence
for branch and site heterogeneity in selection pressures, as well as divergent selection pressures
between UCP1 and its paralogs (UCP2-3) is observed.
Conclusion: We propose that the unique thermogenic function of UCP1 in Eutherians may be
best explained by neutral processes. Along with other evidence, this suggests that the primary
biochemical properties of UCP1 may not differ between Eutherians and non-Eutherians.

Background
Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is a mitochondrial protein
carrier which, until recently, was thought to be found only
in endothermic placental (Eutherian) mammals [1,2]. In
Eutherians, UCP1 is the only gene known to be exclusively expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT), accounting for up to 5% of the total mitochondrial protein in BAT
[3]; UCP1 (also known as thermogenin) provides Euthe-

rians, particularly small mammals, hibernators and newborns, with a unique mechanism of non-shivering
thermogenesis (NST) [4]. UCP1-dependent NST is probably a feature of most Eutherian mammals, as it has been
found recently in the rock elephant shrew, a member of
the Afrotherian mammalian lineage which separated early
during the evolution of the Eutherians [5]. NST is produced by increasing the proton conductance in the inner

membrane of brown adipocyte mitochondria. This
increased proton conductance uncouples mitochondrial
respiration from ATP synthesis and thereby dissipates the
proton motive force as heat [6-9]. It is the high oxidative
capacity of mitochondria in BAT and the cellular composition of BAT that allows heat dissipation rates at a power
of 300 – 400 W/kg [10-12]. It is these properties of BAT,
their mitochondria, and the uncoupling activity of UCP1
which provide Eutherians with NST.
UCP1 is a member of the UCP gene family of mitochondrial transport proteins, which contains two closely
related paralogs, UCP2 and UCP3. Although UCP2/3
have been intensively investigated, the molecule(s) that
these proteins transport and their overall function remain
unclear [6,8,13-16]. It is clear that UCP1 in fish and mammals are orthologs, forming a monophyletic clade, and
that the tissue specificity of UCP1 differs between fish,
where it is expressed in liver, kidneys and brain, and
mammals, where it is expressed exclusively in adipose tissue [2]. Although the function of UCP1 in fish is uncertain, it has been shown that UCP1-like uncoupling
activity in fish liver mitochondria is mediated by fatty
acids and that it is inhibited by purine nucleotides, analogous to its mediation in Eutherians [17]. Interestingly,
while UCP1 expression is increased in response to cold in
Eutherians, it is down regulated in the liver of fish in
response to cold [2].
In this study we investigate how the evolution of UCP1
may have been influenced by the acquisition of BAT-limited expression and the novel role of NST in Eutherians.
Previous work has demonstrated an elevated rate of evolution, i.e. substitution rate, on the UCP1 Eutherian lineage [18]. Yet, what remains uncertain is the mode of
evolution which acted upon this lineage. Identification of
lineage-specific directional selection would indeed be suggestive of the acquisition of a new function by UCP1. In
contrast, the lack of support for lineage-specific directional selection would not rule out this possibility, but
may be more suggestive of Eutherian and non-Eutherian
UCP1 functional similarities and thus an evolution of
NST through neutral processes. We implement a series of
phylogenetic models by maximum likelihood to estimate
selection pressures at non-synonymous or replacement
sites and at synonymous sites [19]. Contrasting the rate of
evolution at these two sites (dN/dS or ω) provides a
means of evaluating the selection pressures which have
acted on the protein during the evolution of UCP1. Our
goal is to determine the mode of selection occurring on
the Eutherian lineage, where novel biochemical function
may have evolved in the course of UCP1 becoming a protein obligated to BAT-limited expression and NST.

Results
Available UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 sequences were
retrieved from 39 species ranging from teleost fishes to
mammals (Additional file 1). Nucleotide and protein distance NJ trees, the species tree and a maximum likelihood
(ML) tree were generated for the UCP1 locus. No one tree
was significantly better than any other as indicated by the
RELL method [20] and S-H test [21]. To evaluate the
robustness of the results we chose to run all analyses with
both the species tree (Figure 1) and the ML tree. As the
results were largely concordant between trees and codon
substitution models (data not shown), the results using
the species tree and the F3X4 codon substitution model
are presented in the main text, unless specified otherwise.
All analyses for the UCP2 and UCP3 loci used the species
tree. Furthermore, all analyses critical for our conclusions
were repeated using the alignments from a second alignment software package, namely T-Coffee. Again, this was
performed to insure the robustness of our results, as different methods may produce different alignments that
then influence the outcome of all subsequent analyses. All
results were highly congurent between the two alignment
methods; we therefore present parameter estimations
derived from alignments using MUSCLE, and present only
those derived from T-Coffee which would lead to different
conclusions.
The objective here is to determine the mode of selection
that has acted on the UCP1 coding sequence in Eutherians, where it is certain that UCP1 is involved in the dissipation
of
heat
essential
for
non-shivering
thermogenesis. We tested for directional selection on the
Eutherian branch (Figure 1), and for divergent selection
pressure between the Eutherian UCP1 clade and its paralogs UCP2 and UCP3 (Figure 2). This was done by comparing the ω value among lineages and among sites across
the UCP1 phylogeny, in order to determine the mode of
selection and the magnitude of change in selective constraint (if any) acting across the UCP1 protein as well as
within particular functional domains of UCP1.
Branch and site ω rate variation
The one-ratio model (M0), which constrains ω to be equal
across all lineages of the phylogeny, was used to evaluate
the global ω value across the UCP1 phylogeny. The UCP1
species phylogeny (Figure 1) was used in this analysis.
Global ω was estimated to be 0.124, indicative of strong
purifying selection. Omega estimates for UCP2 and UCP3
phylogenies, also using species trees appropriate for the
UCP2 and UCP3 data, were 0.072 and 0.083, respectively.
Allowing ω to vary among branches across the UCP1 phylogeny (M1 model) results in a significantly improved fit
to the data (likelihood ratio test (LRT), 2Δᐍ = 217, p <
0.001, df = 44). Thus, there is lineage-specific heterogeneity in ω across the UCP1 phylogeny.

Branch lengths are estimates of the number of substitutions per codon as performed in the M2 model with the
Eutherian branch set as the foreground branch. Each lineage is defined with the common name of each species and the
three letter species code.
Along with lineage heterogeneity, variation in ω across
sites can also occur. Theoretically, different protein
domains with different functions may experience different selection pressures, which can be tested by fitting the
data to a model comprising different site classes. The
M3(discrete) model partitions the sites among three site
categories, based on a discrete distribution. Each site category has an estimated proportion (p0, p1, p2) and their ω
values (ω0, ω1, ω2) are estimated from the data. This
model results in a significantly better fit to the data than
the null M0 model (LRT: 2Δᐍ = 468, df = 4, p-value <
0.001). This observation is also true for the UCP2 and
UCP3 loci (Table 1). The ω estimates vary among sites for
each gene; however, in general the fraction of sites with
low ω estimates, indicative of strong selective constraints,
is reduced for UCP1 relative to UCP2 and UCP3. Only
46% of UCP1 sites are under strong purifying selection

(the lowest ω category), compared to 60–61% for UCP2
and UCP3 (Table 1). This is consistent with the previous
observation that the M0 ω estimate is higher for UCP1
(0.124) than for UCP2 (0.072) or UCP3 (0.083).
Relaxed constraint on the Eutherian lineage
To determine if the Eutherian UCP1 lineage (Figure 1) has
evolved at a different rate, as compared to the rest of the
phylogeny, a two ratio model (M2) was implemented. In
this model there are two branch categories, and thus two
independent estimates of ω: category 0, for the background branches, i.e. all lineages in the phylogeny excluding the Eutherian lineage; and category 1 for the
foreground branch, i.e. the Eutherian lineage. In this
model the estimated ω1 is 0.582 for the Eutherian branch,
and 0.113 for the background branches. A LR test indicates that the M2 model provides a significantly better fit

p0, p1, and p2 are the estimated proportion of sites, and ω0, ω1, and ω2

selection), respectively.

to the data that the M0 model (2ΔL = 47.14, p < 0.001, df
= 1). Thus, there is a significantly higher ω value for UCP1
on the Eutherian lineage relative to the rest of the phylogeny. However, this estimate is not indicative of positive
selection, it is rather indicative of relaxed constraint. By
contrast, the UCP2 and UCP3 ω estimates for the Eutherian lineage do not differ from the rest of the phylogeny,
as the LR tests do no indicate a better fit for the M2 model
over the M0 model for these two genes (UCP2: p = 0.11;
UCP3: p = 0.95). This contrast between the Eutherian
UCP1 lineage, vs. the Eutherian UCP2 and UCP3 lineages,
is further illustrated by the contrast in branch lengths
(number of substitutions per codon) in the UCP phylogeny (Figure 2).
In principle, the increased ω estimate on the Eutherian
UCP1 lineage could be the result of either an increase in
dN or a decrease in dS. To determine the best explanation
for this observation we compared the observed dN and dS
values for the Eutherian lineage to the distribution of
these estimates across the UCP1 phylogeny, given the estimates from the M2 model. The Eutherian UCP1 lineage
dS is 0.27, which falls in the 70th percentile of dS values
for all lineages in the phylogeny, whereas dN for the Eutherian lineage is 0.16, which is the largest dN value in the
UCP1 phylogeny. Hence, it is dN, rather than dS, that
appears responsible for the increased ω estimate on the
Eutherian UCP1 lineage, again indicative of relaxed constraint.
Branch-sites model
Branch models have little power to detect directional
selection which has acted on just a few codon sites across
a lineage, as any signature of selection would be lost in the
abundance of negative selection acting across the remaining codons. For this reason, a branch-sites method has
been developed that allows variation in ω across individual codons on a specific lineage [22,23]. This model (MA)
designates two categories of branches, again foreground
and background, where positive selection is modeled only
on the foreground branch. Further, the model includes
four site categories for both foreground and background
(0, 1, 2a, 2b). Class 0 sites are sites under purifying selec-

tion, where ω0 is estimated to be between 0 and 1. Class 1
sites are neutral sites, where ω1 is set to 1. Site classes 2a
and 2b are sites which are modeled to be under purifying
selection (ω0) or neutral evolution (ω1), respectively, on
the background branches. On the foreground branch,
these sites are under positive selection, where ω2 is
allowed to be greater than 1. We have implemented the
MA (branch-sites) model, designating the Eutherian
branch of the UCP1 phylogeny (Figure 1) as the foreground branch. The results of this analysis are robust
across the different codon substitution models and trees.
As done for all analyses, the MA model was tested with
both the species tree and the ML tree in combination with
the F3X4, F61 and FMutSel models of codon substitution.
The MA model (ω2 = 1.45, p2 = 0.33, ᐍ = -10101.60) did
not provide a significantly better fit than the null model,
where the null model is neutrality (site class 2 is fixed to
equal 1, and thus tests if the MA ω2 estimate is significantly greater than 1), in any of the analyses (2Δᐍ = 0.84,
df = 1, p = 0.36). Thus, these analyses do not provide any
evidence for directional selection on the Eutherian UCP1
lineage.
Because it is theoretically possible for novel functions or
functional divergence to evolve without positive selection
[24,25], it may remain informative to functionally investigate the sites identified in these analyses. Each of the
branch-sites models do identify a few robust sites which
have greater than a 95% posterior probability of being
correctly assigned to site class 2, i.e. those which may have
experienced selection, where ω is greater than one (but
not significantly so as demonstrated in the LRT), by the
Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) method [26]; these sites are:
13M, 19S, 26L, 73K, 121L, 150I, 167T, 221V, 256M. It
must be emphasized that this analysis is only considered
to be informative when the null model of neutrality is
rejected and a model of selection provides a better fit to
the data. Thus, there is no support for these sites to have
been the subject of selection; yet these sites could prove to
be informative for future studies on UCP1 function.
Reduction of UCP1 evolution in Eutherians
To further investigate the possibility of selection we tested
for a relative reduction in dN across the Eutherian UCP1
phylogeny. Following the acquisition of a new function
by a protein via positive selection at replacement sites, it
is predicted that protein evolution should slow down and
be dominated by purifying selection [27,28]. To determine if there was a reduction in the rate of non-synonymous substitutions across the UCP1 phylogeny, after the
demonstrated relative increase of dN on the Eutherian lineage, we used the UCP2 and UCP3 phylogenies as comparative loci. In the branch (M2) and branch-sites (MA)
analysis neither UCP2 nor UCP3 exhibit evidence for
either directional selection or relaxed constraints on the

Eutherian branch. The evolutionary history of UCP1 is
unique in this respect. Thus we assumed that the estimated evolutionary constraints across the Eutherian phylogenies of the UCP1 paralogs are a good proxy for what
may be expected across the UCP1 phylogeny. Estimated
dN values, from the M1(free ratio) analysis, for all congruent branches on the UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3 phylogenies
were used to perform a one-sided paired Wilcoxon test. If
the Eutherian branch had experienced selection at replacement sites we would predict that dN across Eutherians in
the UCP1 phylogeny should, at the very least, not be
greater than that observed in its paralogs. Contrary to this
prediction we find that the rate of substitution at replacement sites remains greater (median dN = 0.01) than that
observed across the UCP2 (median dN = 0.003, p-value <
0.001) and UCP3 (median dN = 0.004, p-value = 0.0365)
phylogenies. We also found that the rate of replacement
substitutions across the UCP3 phylogeny is greater than
that estimated in the UCP2 phylogeny (p-value < 0.001).
Therefore, congruent lineages across UCP phylogenies do
differ from each other in the rate of dN, yet the UCP1 phylogeny has the largest dN rate. There is thus no evidence
that UCP1 evolution has slowed in Eutherians, relative to
UCP2 or UCP3, as may be expected following a selective
event for novel function. Thus these observations refute a
conclusion of directional selection and support a model
of relaxed constraint on the Eutherian UCP1 lineage.
Selection for UCP1 on the Therian lineage
Recently, it was discovered that a single marsupial species,
the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), also contains BAT which is recruited in response to cold acclimatization, and that UCP1 expression increases two-fold
under cold conditions [1]. Furthermore, the metabolic
rate of this species increased in response to norepinephrine treatment [29], consistent with regulation by
UCP1. We therefore tested the Therian branch (which
includes marsupials but excludes monotremes) for
branch-site directional selection on UCP1. We found
robust support across all analyses (species tree, ML tree,
each codon substitution model and alignments, p <
0.001) for selection acting on a few sites on the Therian
lineage. In these analyses, 90% of the sites on the Therian
branch are under strong purifying selection with a ω of
0.08, 8.2% of sites are neutrally evolving, and 1.5% of
sites have an estimated ω of 8 (i.e., dS was estimated to be
equal to 0.0). Two sites, 79P and 178T, were identified
with >75% probability by the BEB method of having been
the target of directional selection. While it currently
remains unknown if UCP1 in the fat-tailed dunnart truly
has a thermogenic function, these two identified sites may
prove informative in further studies of UCP1 function.

Functional divergence of UCP1
Directional selection is not a necessary requirement for
functional divergence to occur in the evolution of gene
families, as a new function for a gene can arise through
neutral processes via genetic co-option [30]. To address
this possibility of divergent evolution of UCP1 and its paralogs via neutral processes, we used the MC model [31],
which allows for divergent selection pressures at one site
class between different clades of a phylogeny or between
paralogs. A prediction of this model is that one gene, in a
gene family, can experience reduced functional constraint,
via genetic redundancy, allowing the accumulation of
mutations that will alter protein function, particularly at a
time when the environment changes. First, the M0 model
was used to obtain the global constrained estimate of ω of
0.096 for the entire UCP phylogeny (Figure 2). We then
ran the M2 branch model using each UCP Eutherian lineage as the foreground branch. The ω estimate for the
UCP1 Eutherian branch was 0.680, and was a significantly
better fit to the data than the M0 model (p-value < 0.001),
as was found previously when only the UCP1 phylogeny
was analyzed (Figure 1, Relaxed Constraint on the Eutherian Lineage). For the UCP2 locus, the ω estimate for the
Eutherian lineage was 0.044, which is significantly
smaller than the global ω estimate (p-value = 0.03). The ω
estimate for the UCP3 Eutherian lineage was 0.081, which
is not significantly different from the global ω estimate (p
= 0.68). Thus, UCP1 (but not UCP2 or UCP3) exhibits a
significantly higher ω value on the Eutherian lineage in
the context of the entire UCP phylogeny, consistent with
our previous observations and relaxed functional constraint.

We then fit our data to the MC model with five different
clades, A-E, set as the foreground branches (Figure 2). The
MC model (clade model C) has five parameters (p0, p1,
ω0, ω2 and ω3) estimated. There are three site classes; site
class 0 are defined sites of purifying selection where ω0 is
estimated to be between 0 and 1 (p0 = proportion of class
0 sites), site class 1 are neutral sites with ω1 set equal to 1
(p1 = proportion of class 1 sites), and site class 2 is the
divergent site class where there is an independent estimate
of ω for the background (ω2) and foreground (ω3)
branches (proportion of sites in class 2: p2 = 1 - p0 - p1).
The LR test for each of these analyses is the comparison of
the MC model to the M1a(neutral) sites model, in which
there are two site classes across the entire UCP phylogeny
(site class 0 is under purifying selection and ω is estimated
from the data; site class 1 is neutral and ω is set equal to
1). The M1a(neutral) model estimates that 90% of the
sites are under strong purifying selection with a ω estimate
of 0.08. Each MC analysis provided a significantly better
fit to the data than the M1a(neutral) model (Table 2). The
parameter estimates (Table 2) are very similar across analyses, suggesting that the model is indeed robust to altering

foreground and background branches. To summarize,
overall about 60% of the sites in the UCP phylogeny are
under strong purifying selection, about 1% of the sites are
evolving neutrally, and about 39% of the sites are under
divergent selection pressures between UCP1 and its paralogs. The results for clades B, C, and D (Table 2, foreground ω) suggest that there has been more purifying
selection across the UCP2 phylogeny than that of the
UCP3.
The model with the highest log likelihood is with the
Eutherian UCP1 clade (clade E) set as the foreground
branch. Similar results are obtained when the entire UCP1
clade (clade A) is set as the foreground branch. However,
the log likelihood is lower and the ω3 estimate for the foreground divergent class is larger when only considering the
Eutherian UCP1 clade (clade E). The ω3 observed (0.24)
for the entire UCP1 clade (clade A) may largely reflect the
divergent selection pressures in the Eutherian clade (ω3 =
0.29), with the marsupial and fish lineages reducing the
ω3 estimate for the foreground branch in the entire UCP1

phylogeny (clade A). Furthermore, it is the Eutherian
UCP1 lineage itself that is driving the functional divergence of the Eutherian UCP1 clade. Repeating the MC
model but setting the Eutherian UCP1 lineage (E) (i.e. just
branch E, not the clade) as the foreground branch, an ω of
0.87 is estimated for divergent sites, while background
lineages have an ω of 0.18, where p2 = 0.390 (2Δᐍ = 1119,
p < 0.001; identical ᐍ to Clade E (Table 2)). In conclusion,
these analyses indicate that the UCP1 phylogeny exhibits
large divergent selection pressures, which may principally
involve the Eutherian UCP1 lineage, consistent with the
possible acquisition of the new function of UCP1 through

The BEB method is implemented in each analysis to determine the probability [26] of each site belonging to site
class 0 (purifying), site class 1 (neutral), or site class 2
(divergent). Site classifications are consistent across each
analysis. Figure 3 is a plot of site class probability, i.e. the
probability of each codon belonging to one of the three

Approximately 40% of all sites are under divergent selection pressure, with nonsynonymous substitutions accumulating at a rate ~1.7× greater in the UCP1 Eutherian
clade (clade E) relative to its paralogs, as compared to synonymous substitutions. Sites categorizations are nearly
identical when the MC model is run with either the Eutherian UCP1 clade or the Eutherian UCP1 lineage set as the
foreground branch (5% discrepancy in site classification
between analyses). It is only the ω estimations that are
largely different for the divergent class between the two
analyses (0.29 vs. 0.87). In contrast to the Eutherian clade
analysis, the Eutherian lineage analysis has a nonsynonymous substitution rate that is ~5× greater than that of all
other lineages in the entire phylogeny. Divergent sites are
found across the entire protein and in all functional
domains, assigned by their topology to regions located in
the intermembrane, transmembrane, and matrix space.
Notably, the protein regions exposed to the intermembrane space are significantly over-represented with divergent sites (χ2 = 26.32, p-value = 0.0005, p computed by
Monte Carlo simulation). This result suggests that functional constraints are more relaxed for the regions of the
protein exposed to the intermembrane space in Eutherians. This may have enabled the recruitment of novel
interactions with proteins which potentially regulate the
activity of UCP1.
Positive selection following duplication
In addition to any selection on UCP1 for NST in Eutherians, there may have been positive selection on other
sites in any of the UCP loci following the gene duplications that created them. We therefore used the UCP phylogeny (Figure 2) and the branch-sites model (MA) to test
lineages A (UCP1), B (UCP2/3), C (UCP2), and D
(UCP3) for positive selection acting on only a few sites.
Again, LR tests were used to compare the MA model to the
MA1 model, in which the ω estimate for site class 2 is set
to 1, to assess if the MA model with positive selection is
significantly better than the MA1 model of neutrality. No
robust statistical evidence for selection was discovered for
any basal UCP lineage. Statistical evidence for selection
was identified for UCP1 (A), UCP2/3 (B) and UCP2 (C)
when the analysis was carried out using the MUSCLE
alignment (Table 3), but these results were not supported
by the T-Coffee alignments, and hence any conclusions

about positive selection on any of the UCP loci following
gene duplication depend on the alignment.
Codon usage bias
A recently developed codon substitution model, FMutSel,
explicitly models mutational biases and selection at silent
codon sites [32]. This model was compared to the null
model, FMutSel0, which only models mutational biases,
and does not include the additional codon fitness parameter in FmutSel which models selection on silent sites. The
LRT between these two models has 41 degrees of freedom,
resulting from the parameter rich FMutSel model (60
parameters). It has been suggested that codon usage bias
could have a drastic effect on estimation of dN and dS
[22,33]. The species tree for each UCP locus was used in
these analyses, not the full UCP phylogeny found in Figure 2. We find that each of the UCP loci has statistically
significant evidence for selection at silent sites (Table 4).
This result is not surprising, as about 90% of 5,369 genes
tested reject the null model, indicating that selection on
silent sites is a common phenomenon across the mammalian genome [32]. Thus, codon usage bias is widespread
and silent sites are not neutrally evolving. This conclusion, however, does not discredit the use of ω (the comparison of dN and dS) as a means of identifying sites of
selection. Selection on the protein alters the rate of evolution at replacement sites, and it is this rate of change
before and after selection that is contrasted. Thus, it does
not matter if the rate of substitution at silent sites is driven
by mutation or selection [32].

Interestingly, even though the FmutSel model was a much
better fit to the data than the null model for all three loci,
the statistical significance of the difference between the
models for the UCP2 and UCP3 loci are orders of magnitude larger than for the UCP1 locus (Table 4). This may
suggest that selection on silent sites has been reduced
across the UCP1 phylogeny. The proportion of advantageous mutations (P+) estimated in the UCP phylogenies
is about 0.3 – 0.4, similar to the average estimate of 0.39
across 5,639 genes [32]. In contrast, the estimated average
selection coefficient for advantageous (S+) and disadvantageous (S-) mutations (Table 4) for each of these UCP
loci are greater than three times the average selection coefficient for other genes [32]. Thus, mutations at silent sites

Discussion
It has long been thought that UCP1 had evolved in Eutherian mammals in conjunction with the evolution of
brown adipose tissue. Recent discoveries of UCP1
orthologs in fish and non-Eutherian mammals have now
discredited this idea [1,2,17], as fish and most non-Eutherian mammals do not contain brown adipose tissue
where UCP1 plays a major role in thermogenesis. Furthermore, the recent discovery of UCP1 localized in adipose
tissue in a marsupial species, where it is also regulated in
response to cold acclimatization [1] has forced a reevaluation of the evolution of non-shivering thermogenesis. In
particular, when did the biochemical properties of UCP1
which confer the capability of thermogenesis evolve?
In this study we have used codon substitution models
implemented through a maximum likelihood framework
to estimate the rate of evolution at silent and replacement
sites in UCP1 and its paralogs, UCP2 and UCP3. Different
models were used to investigate variation in the rate of
evolution between lineages of a phylogeny, between
clades of a phylogeny, and to estimate ω for specific lineages and sites across phylogenies. Our objective was to
determine the mode of evolution on the UCP1 Eutherian
lineage, to illuminate possible evolutionary consequences
of novel functions necessary for NST. We observed a significant, five-fold increase in the rate of UCP1 evolution
on the Eutherian lineage, but found no strong statistical
evidence for directional selection. Yet, it should be noted
that the power of these analyses are dependent on the
magnitude of the selection pressure and the proportion of
sites affected [34,35]. These models do have underlying
assumptions, namely no variation in branch and site ω
values. As we have demonstrated, variation among branch
and sites is observed in the UCP1 phylogeny. While large
deviations from these assumptions will affect the power of
the analysis, the MA model does seem to be robust to
moderate deviation in these assumptions [34]. As such,
relaxed functional constraint is most consistent with the
molecular evolutionary analyses of the UCP data. Further,

Our conclusion is in contrast to a previous study which
implemented a heuristic branch model and concluded
that the UCP1 Eutherian lineage had experienced positive
selection on replacement sites [18]. That study estimated
82.8 nonsynonymous and 4.3 synonymous substitutions
on the Eutherian branch using a least-squares approach,
whereas we estimate 88.5 nonsynonymous and 47.5 synonymous substitutions respectively. We repeated the analyses in [18], using their methodology, and obtained
essentially the same results they did (data not shown). To
determine why these two methods are giving drastically
different results, we simulated the evolutionary history of
UCP1 using the branch-lengths given by the M0 global
model, the global ω estimate of 0.1134, and the Evolver
program in the PAML 4a package (Additional file 2). We
then estimated ω for the Eutherian lineage using both the
heuristic method [18] and the ML (M2) model used in
this study. The resulting ω estimate for the ML model was
0.1135, virtually identical to the value used in the simulations, while the ω estimate for the heuristic approach was
1.239. We repeated the simulation, setting ω = 0.5 for the
Eutherian lineage and ω = 0.1 for all other lineages, which
mirrors the observed data. The resulting ω estimate for the
Eutherian lineage was 0.47 based on the ML model and
7.75 based on the heuristic approach. In each simulation
the heuristic approach greatly under-estimated the
number of synonymous substitutions. We conclude that
the contradiction between our results and the previous
study [18] results from the poor performance of the heuristic least-squares method on trees and lineages with long
branch lengths. It appears that least-squares method drastically underestimate the number of synonymous substitutions [37].
An alternative to relaxed functional constraint as an explanation for the increased rate of evolution on the UCP1
Eutherian lineage would be a decrease in the effective
population size (Ne) of the ancestor of all Eutherian mammals. However, a change in Ne along the Eutherian lineage

Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:4

would affect all loci in the genome. As such the UCP1 paralogs, UCP2 and UCP3, should also reflect any possible
changes in Ne. Yet these UCP1 paralogs do not exhibit a
rate increase, so a decrease in Ne can be excluded. Therefore it remains that the best explanation for the increase in
UCP1 evolution along the Eutherian lineage is relaxation
of functional constraints, possibly allowing functional
divergence through neutral processes.
Assuming that UCP1 did indeed experience relaxation of
functional constraints on the Eutherian lineage, what may
have caused this? There are several possible explanations,
which are not mutually exclusive. First, it has been documented that the physiological relevance of thermogenic
function varies across Eutherians, with NST being most
efficient in small mammals and hibernators, particularly
those which inhabit environments with long cold seasons
[38,39]. If the ancestor of all Eutherians was a large species
where NST was not important, or a species which inhabited a moderate environment, functional constraints on
UCP1 could have been relaxed. The ancestor of all extant
Eutherians lived ~150–100 MYA, during the late Jurassic
and early Cretaceous [40]. In general mammals of this
period are thought to have been small in size [41] and this
era was also generally warmer than today [42,43]. Thus it
is possible that constraints on UCP1 were reduced at some
time point prior to the Eutherian radiation, some 100
MYA. Second, it could be that some function(s) of UCP1
in Eutherians was taken over by UCP1's paralogs, which
would also reduce the level of constraint. It is certain that
UCP1 in Eutherians must have had a role in some other
tissue(s) prior to becoming an obligate BAT protein.
Genes expressed in many tissues tend to be more constrained than those expressed in one or a few tissues [44].
Thus, the release of UCP1 from its role in other tissues
would allow UCP1 to evolve tissue specificity to BAT,
decrease the selective constraint on UCP1, and allow for
genetic co-option (the altering of a genetic system for a
new use). For example, as shown in Table 1, the ω estimate (ω0) assigned to site class 1 (strong purifying selection) suggests that there has been more selective
constraint on UCP2, which is expressed in many tissues,
than on UCP3, which is expressed in just a few tissues
[15,16]. The function(s) of UCP2 and UCP3 are currently
uncertain; determining their function(s) would certainly
aid in understanding UCP1 evolution.
In the process of genetic co-option or functional gene
divergence it is not necessary for directional selection to
act on protein evolution in order for divergent/novel functions to evolve. Constraint on a protein can be relaxed
when a paralog is available to fulfill the function of that
protein. As such, evolution can then act to use existing
gene functions for a new purpose. The prediction of heterogeneity in selection pressures between gene paralogs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/4

exemplifies the divergent selection pressures that allow
the evolution of divergent functions. We examined the
potential of genetic co-option, i.e. functional divergence
of UCP1, through the implementation of the MC clade
model [31]. We found that about 40% of the sites were
under divergent selection pressures, with the UCP1 clade
experiencing a greater number of substitutions at replacement sites relative to silent sites (Figure 3). Moreover,
intermembrane sites are over-represented in the divergent
site category, which may suggest that intermembrane
interactions have diverged in Eutherian UCP1. Regardless,
it is apparent that there has been tissue-specific functional
divergence of UCP1 in BAT.
Cold-induced UCP1 expression was recently detected in
adipose tissue of the interscapular region of the Australian
fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), a dasyurid
marsupial species [1]. Further, the adipose tissue in which
it was found was described as being an archetypal brown
adipose tissue. As such, these findings challenge the view
of NST as an exclusive property of Eutherians. However,
this finding is unique to this particular marsupial, as coldinduced UCP1 expression was not found in the dasyurid
marsupial Antechius flavipes (yellow-footed Antechinus)
or the South American didelphid marsupial Monodelphis
domestica (gray short-tailed opossum). Furthermore, there
is currently no evidence for a thermogenic role of UCP1 in
the fat-tailed dunnart. Its regulation and expression is suggestive of a thermogenic role, yet no evidence of non-shivering thermogenesis or "adaptive-NST", i.e. an adaptive
organismal response to the cold, has been demonstrated.
As such, if NST is determined to be present in the fat-tailed
dunnart, it would most likely be a case of parallel evolution or multiple lineage loss of NST, as deduced from phylogenetic inference and given that these findings are
restricted to a single non-Eutherian species.
Nevertheless, since UCP1 in the fat-tailed dunnart does
show a response to cold and norepinephrine [29] similar
to that found in Eutherians, it may be that any truly novel
function of UCP1 started evolving in the Therian (marsupial and Eutherian) lineage. We therefore tested for selection on UCP1 on this lineage and found strong evidence
for positive selection, and we identified two sites (79P and
178T) which may be responsible for any novel UCP1
function. These two sites should be the target of further
functional investigations. Moreover, it is not clear if UCP1
in marsupials is truly functionally identical to UCP1 in
Eutherians; more studies are needed to clarify this issue.

Conclusion
In agreement with previous studies, we find evidence for
acceleration in the evolution of UCP1 on the Eutherian
lineage. However, in contrast to previous studies, our
analyses indicate that relaxed constraints on UCP1, rather

Page 10 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:4

than directional selection, seem to be responsible. We
suggest that this relaxation of constraints on UCP1 may
have allowed the acquisition or enhancement of the
(potentially) novel role of UCP1 in NST in Eutherians, as
supported by the divergent selection pressures identified
in the UCP phylogeny. Currently, the most likely hypothesis for the origin of NST hinges upon the evolution of
BAT with high mitochondrial oxidative capacities. For this
requirement to be meet evolution needs a tissue with
many mitochondria which in turn have a high expression
level of UCP1 and complexes I-IV of the electron transport
chain. This combination can then induce a high mitochondrial oxidative capacity which will lead to heat production (i.e. NST). As such, we hypothesize that UCP1 in
Eutherians and non-Eutherians share similar or identical
biochemical properties. To test this hypothesis the biochemical properties of UCP1 in non-Eutherians need to
be elucidated.

Methods
Coding sequence sources
Coding sequences (cds) for UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3 were
obtained from the NCBI CoreNucleotide and Ensembl
http://www.ensembl.org databases. A table with species
names, abbreviations and accession numbers can be
found in supplementary materials (Additional file 1).
Data analysis
Coding sequences were imported into MEGA 3.1 [45] and
converted into amino acid sequences, which were then
aligned with MUSCLE 3.6 [46] and T-Coffee 3.8 [47] and
exported in CLUSTAL W format. The amino acid alignment was subsequently transformed into an aligned cds
fasta file with a custom PERL script. The accepted species
tree [40,48] was generated by hand and gene trees were
generated using various nucleotide and amino acid substitution models in PHYLIP [49]. The gene trees analyzed
included: neighbor joining (NJ) trees from nucleotide
sequence distances (dnadist; F84, Kimura and Jukes-Cantor substitution models) with a gamma distributed rate
variation and a transition/transversion bias (κ) of 2.0; a
DNA maximum likelihood (dnaml) tree with κ = 2.0, rate
variation among sites, global rearrangements, and randomized input; and lastly a NJ tree from protein distances
(protdist) was generated using the JTT and PAM substitution models and a gamma distributed rate variation. Maximum likelihood analyses were performed using the
aligned cds and the CODEML program found in the
PAML 4a package [19]. The species tree and generated
gene trees were analyzed with the CODEML program of
the PAML 4a package, which implements the re-sampling
estimated log-likelihood (RELL) method, and the likelihood ratio tests K-H and S-H. These are nonparametric
likelihood ratio tests, which test if two phylogenetic trees
differ significantly in how well they fit the data. As it is not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/4

appropriate to use a maximum likelihood tree with the KH test [50] we focused on the results from the S-H test and
the RELL method. Finally, CODEML of the PAML 4a package was also used to estimate the ratio of non-synonymous or replacement changes per site/synonymous
changes per site, also known as the dN/dS ratio or the
omega value (ω). CODEML implements a maximum likelihood (ML) method of estimating ω [51], using a variety
of codon substitutions models and estimation of κ, and
accounts for base frequency biases at codon positions.
Different site [52,53], branch [54,55], branch-sites
[22,23,26], and clade models [31] were implemented in
estimating the ω value. In this study we used the F3X4 and
F61 models of codon frequencies [51], as well as the
recently developed FMutSel model [32], which models
mutational biases and introduces a parameter of codon
fitness to model selection at silent sites. The F3X4 and F61
codon models differ in the manner in which they estimate
each codon's equilibrium frequency. The F3X4 model
derives equilibrium codon frequencies from the frequencies of the three nucleotides at the three codon positions,
while the F61 model uses each codon as a free parameter
and constrains the sum to one. Analyses such as these
allow the determination of the type of evolution (neutrality, negative selection, or positive selection) which predominates across the entire phylogenetic tree, across each
site in the sequence, on particular branches, at particular
sites on particular branches, or at particular sites across
clades. In these analyses an ω value equal to one is indicative of neutral evolution, ω greater than one is indicative
of positive selection, and ω less than one is indicative of
negative or purifying selection.
