Introgression of Swertia mussotii gene into
Bupleurum scorzonerifolium via somatic
hybridization
Junfeng Wang1,2, Cuizhu Zhao1, Chang Liu1, Guangmin Xia1* and Fengning Xiang1*

Abstract
Background: The wild herb Swertia mussotii is a source of the anti-hepatitis compounds swertiamarin, mangiferin
and gentiopicroside. Its over-exploitation has raised the priority of producing these compounds heterologously.
Somatic hybridization represents a novel approach for introgressing Swertia mussotii genes into a less endangered
species.
Results: Protoplasts derived from calli of Bupleurum scorzonerifolium and S. mussotii were fused to produce 194
putative hybrid cell lines, of which three (all derived from fusions where the S. mussotii protoplasts were pretreated for 30 s with UV light) later differentiated into green plants. The hybridity of the calli was confirmed by a
combination of isozyme, RAPD and chromosomal analysis. The hybrid calli genomes were predominantly B.
scorzonerifolium. GISH analysis of mitotic chromosomes confirmed that the irradiation of donor protoplasts
increased the frequency of chromosome elimination and fragmentation. RFLP analysis of organellar DNA revealed
that mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA of both parents coexisted and recombined in some hybrid cell lines. Some
of the hybrid calli contained SmG10H from donor, and produced swertiamarin, mangiferin and certain volatile
compounds characteristic of S. mussotii. The expression of SmG10H (geraniol 10-hydroxylase) was associated with
the heterologous accumulation of swertiamarin.
Conclusions: Somatic hybrids between B. scorzonerifolium and S. mussotii were obtained, hybrids selected all
contained introgressed nuclear and cytoplasmic DNA from S. mussotii; and some produced more mangiferin than
the donor itself. The introgression of SmG10H was necessary for the accumulation of swertiamarin.

Background
Somatic hybridization provides a means to bypass the
problem of sexual incompatibility which prevents the
production of many wide hybrids in the plant kingdom.
The technique has been successfully demonstrated in a
number of intra- and inter-specific, intergeneric, intertribal and even inter-familial combinations [1-4]. The
possibility of introgression from exotic sources is of
interest not just in the applied field, but also because it
provides opportunities for the discovery of novel synthetic pathways for secondary metabolites and signalling
compounds.

The medicinal herb Swertia mussotii Franch is native
to Tibet, where it has enjoyed a long history of use as a
curative for hepatitis [5,6]. Its major active compounds
have been shown to be swertiamarin, mangiferin and
gentiopicroside [7]. The economic value of the species is
such that there is now a real risk of species extinction
as a result of over-exploitation. Swertiamarin and gentiopicroside are both iridoid monoterpenoids, but their
synthetic pathway has not as yet been characterized in
any detail [8,9]. However, many of the reactions in this
pathway are known to be catalyzed by P450 proteins
[10,11]. Members of this highly diverse protein family
are involved in the synthesis of pigments, antioxidants
and defense compounds [12], and one of particular
importance for the synthesis of swertiamarin is the
enzyme geraniol 10-hydroxylase (G10H) [13]. Recently,
we isolated a full length cDNA clone of S. mussotii

G10H (SmG10H), which has the catalytic activity of
hydroxylating geraniol [14].
Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd (2n = 12), as a
member of the Umbelliferae family, also is a very useful
herb in Chinese traditional medicine, where it is used to
treat acesodyne, diminish inflammation, ease fever and
increase resistance to hepatic injury and promote
immunity [15]. We previously reported plant regeneration from cultured B. scorzonerifolium protoplasts [16].
And these cultured cell lines with the fast-growing
capacities have remained viable for at least 16 years,
showing a chromosome numbers of 2n = 12 in over
90% of cells [3].
Our aim was to obtain somatic hybrids between S.
mussotii and B. scorzonerifolium. The latter was chosen
as the other biparent because it had a rapid growth and
similar many secondary metabolic pathways [15,16]. We
have used a number of fingerprinting methods to characterize the introgression events achieved by applying this
process, and in particular have focussed on the presence
of SmG10H. Finally we sought to establish the relationship between the accumulation of swertiamarin and gentiopicroside and the level of expression of SmG10H.

Results
Growth and development of somatic fusion nuclei

Granular calli were formed from combinations A-D
after about two months of culture in liquid P5 medium
in the dark, but no callus was observed in combination
E. Once the clones had reached a diameter of 1.5-2 mm
(Figure 1A), they were transferred to the proliferation
medium MB2 (Figure 1B), where they were maintained
through three rounds of sub-culturing before their final
transfer to the differentiation medium MB3. A population of 194 clones was obtained by this process (Table
1); of these only three, all from combination B, were
successfully regenerated into plants. These all developed
narrow and long leaves, resembling those of B. scorzonerifolium (Figure 1C-E).
Genetic characterization of the somatic hybrid calli

Esterase isozyme analysis of 194 clones indicated that
104 had the partial characteristic band(s) of both parents and novel bands and were verifiable as hybrid
(Additional file 1). A set of 88 RAPD primers was
applied to generate DNA fingerprints of the presumptive
hybrid calli (Additional file 2). Fragments from both
biparents, as well as fragments not present in either of
them, were observed in all of the hybrid clones tested
(Figure 2). As 91% of the fragments in the hybrids were
derived from the B. scorzonerifolium biparent, and only
0.2-2.4% from the S. mussotii biparent, the hybrid genomes were dominated by the recipient species (Table 2).
The construction of donor nuclear genome DNAs in

these hybrids were similar except hybrid C10 (Additional file 3). RAPD analysis showed in hybrids exposure
of UV for 30 s, there were 1.7% donor characteristic
bands and 1.2% new bands (2.9% in total), however the
numbers were raised to 4.5% and 3.2% (7.7% in total) in
hybrids exposure of UV for 1 min (Additional file 3).
Karyotypes of somatic hybrid clones

The chromosome numbers of B. scorzonerifolium and S.
mussotii calli were 11-12 and 17-20, respectively (Figure
3A, B and Table 3). In the clones derived from combination A, the number was no lower than 15, with most
carrying 17-20 (Table 3). Combination B clones carried
11-16 chromosomes, and combination C ones carried
11-14 (Table 3). Combination D clones had 11-14
(Table 3). When analysed using GISH, the biparental
genomes were readily distinguishable from one another
(Figure 4A, B). The three regenerable hybrid clones had
chimera cells with different chromosome numbers, carrying 11-13 intact B. scorzonerifolium, none intact S.
mussotii, and 1-3 recombined chromosomes (Figure
4C). In contrast, the non-regenerable clones carried 1113 intact B. scorzonerifolium, none intact S. mussotii and
5-9 recombined chromosomes (Figure 4D).
Analysis of the cytoplasmic genomes of somatic hybrids

The RFLP profiles of mitochondrial DNA obtained using
restriction enzymes HindIII and hybridized with probes
coxI revealed that all of the cell lines analyzed contained

B. scorzonerifolium sequences and cell lines B9 and C10
had donor bands and novel bands (Figure 5A). The chloroplast type of the hybrid cell lines was determined using
rbcL as a hybridization probe. Hybridizations of HindIII
digests with rbcL show that all of the cell lines analyzed
contained B. scorzonerifolium fragments and 1-2 novel
fragments, and cell lines B9 and B24 contained S. mussotii
fragments (Figure 5B). Thus, some recombination within
the mitochondrial and chloroplast genome of both parents
also occurred in some hybrids.
Content of medicinally active compounds

The HPLC-based analysis of 74 of the hybrid clones
determined that none accumulated gentiopicroside
(Figure 6). Clones B24, B27, B132, C18, C26, C47 and
C124 contained 7.4-81.2 Î¼g/g swertiamarin, while clones
B6, B40, B56, C10 and C121 contained 86.3-816.8 Î¼g/g
mangiferin. Notably, the mangiferin content of clones
B6, B56 and C10 was higher than that of the callus
derived from the S. mussotii biparent (Table 4).
Volatile compounds in the biparent and hybrid clones

The volatile compound content of the hybrid clones, as
assessed by GC-MS, largely resembled that of the B. scorzonerifolium biparent (Additional file 4). Nevertheless, a

few donor compounds, in particular coumaron and linoleic acid, were detectable in some of the hybrid clones,
along with a small number of compounds (e.g., cyclohexanol and dodecanoyl) which were not detected in either
biparent (Table 5).
The introgression of P450 genes

Degenerate PCR analysis was used to detect the P450
genes in clones A6, A67, B24, B27, B132, C18, C26, C47
and C124, with various contents of swertiamarin and mangiferin (Figure 7 and Additional file 5). Only amplicon of
primer CYP76 was distinguished among the bipatents and
hybrid A6 (Figure 7). Each cDNA template amplified a
single fragment in the size range 1100~1500 bp in hybrids
above and the bipatents using primer CYP76. Sequencing
identified 11 distinct fragments. An analysis of the set of
polypeptides predicted from these nucleotide sequences
identified their homology to the G10H gene of Catharanthus roseus (geraniol 10-hydroxylase gene, GenBank
accession number AJ251269). A full length SmG10H
sequence of 1488 bp (Genebank accession GU168041) was
obtained from S. mussotii. The G10H sequences present in
clones B24, B27, B132, C18, C26, C47 and C124 were
identical to that of SmG10H (Additional file 6). In two
clones (A6 and A67), the G10H sequence shared 53.1%
homology with SmG10H (Additional file 7).
Up-regulation of SmG10H is correlated with the
accumulation of swertiamarin

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR suggested that the expression
SmG10H varied among the clones (S. mussotii > B24 >
B132 > C47 > A6, see Figure 8 and Table 4). The swertiamarin content of S. mussotii (933 Î¼g/g) was substantially higher than that in the hybrid clones (0-81.2 Î¼g/g),
while clones B24 and B132 produced more than clone
C47; neither swertiamarin nor SmG10H expression were
detected in clone A6. These results suggest that up-regulation of SmG10H is correlated with the accumulation
of swertiamarin.

the somatic hybridization process [1,3,4]. Much of the
problem appears to be related to the hybrid incompatibility of the biparents. This hybrid incompatibility can
be alleviated if sufficient of the donor biparentâs chromosomes are either completely eliminated, or at least
are broken down so that sub-chromosomal segments
become fused with the recipient biparentâs chromosome
[2,17,18]. The somatic chromosome number of successful regenerants has been shown to be close to or just
slightly lower than that of the recipient biparent [19,20].
Here, only three of the population of the 194 somatic B.
scorzonerifolium / S. mussotii fusion nuclei proved to be
regenerable. Both the genetic and cytological analyses
showed that the constitution of the regenerable hybrid
calli was close to that of the recipient parent B. scorzonerifolium, which suggested that large-scale chromosome elimination is necessary to restore the somatic
hybridsâ ability to regenerate.
UV irradiation of the donor biparentâs protoplasts prior
to fusion has been shown to encourage chromosomal

elimination [21-23]. The hybrid cell lines B24 and C10
both retained 11-13 B. scorzonerifolium chromosomes,
none entire S. mussotii, but the former retained 1-3 introgression chromosomes, while the latter retained more
(5-9) introgression chromosomes (Figure 4). This result is
consistent with the pattern whereby raising the UV dosage
decreases the number of intact donor chromosomes but
increases the frequency of donor introgression [20,23].
Characteristics of the hybrid cytoplasmic genome

Earlier investigations showed that recombination and
(or) coexistence mitochondria DNA from both parents
is common in somatic hybrids [23]. In contrast, chloroplast DNA often had random and equal segregation
[24,25]. Mixed populations and recombination of chloroplast DNA have only rarely been detected [26]. In our
previous studies, mixed and recombined mitochondrial
DNA was also seen in wheat somatic hybrids [23,27,28].
In this study, the mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA of
both parents also coexisted in most hybrid cell lines.
Novel DNA segments appeared in some hybrids, which

The content of swertiamarin, mangiferin and gentiopicroside varied markedly among the hybrid clones (Table
4). With respect to swertiamarin, no clone accumulated
close to the level which was achieved by the donor calli
(Figure 6). However, with respect to mangiferin, five

may have been the result of recombination of mitochondria and chloroplast DNA (Figure 5). We conclude that
in the inter-familial hybridization between B. scorzonerifolium and S. mussotii, it is possible to transfer donor
mitochondrial and chloroplast genes.

donor, two accumulated markedly less (B40 and C121),
and two (A6 and B24) produced no detectable level

number of volatiles associated with the donor species is

also indicative of the transfer of whole synthetic pathways from S. mussotii to a genotype which is largely B.
scorzonerifolium.
The clones best able to accumulate mangiferin tended
to have retained the most introgressed chromosomes

swertiamarin (Figure 8), implying that the transfer of
SmG10H alone cannot be expected to be sufficient to
guarantee heterologous expression. The implied requirement for other genes in the synthetic pathway underlines the difficulty that a more reductive, tansgenic
strategy would face in obtaining the successful production of swertiamarin in a heterologous situation. The
identification of hybrid clones able to accumulate this
medicinally significant compound therefore confirms the
potential of somatic hybridization as a viable route for
engineering the production of such molecules in plants.

(Figure 4). Similarly the RAPD fingerprinting showed
that these clones also inherited the most donor DNA
(Table 2 and Figure 2). Presumably maximizing the
yield of the donorâs medicinally active compounds in a
somatic hybrid clone requires transferring as much
donor DNA as possible.

Conclusions
In conclusion, somatic hybridization provides a new way
to introgression secondary metabolites and related genes
in phylogenetic distant species. Here we have managed
to obtain somatic hybrids of B. scorzonerifolium / S.
mussotii with an appreciable content of swertiamarin.
The nuclear and cytoplasmic genes from donor were
transferred into the genome DNA of hybrid clones. The
introgression of SmG10H was necessary for the accumulation of swertiamarin. Therefore, the potential of
somatic hybridization is a viable route for engineering
the production of such molecules in plants.
Methods

The relationship between SmG10H expression and
swertiamarin content

According to RT-PCR at least, the expression of
SmG10H varied among the hybrid clones. Nevertheless,
its level was largely correlated with the accumulation of

Origin of biparental protoplasts

Immature seed of Swertia mussotii Franch was collected
from Yushu county, Qinghai province, China. Voucher
specimens had been deposited at Qinghai Normal University. The seed was surface-sterilized by immersion
first in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 30 s and then in 0.1% w/v
aqueous mercuric chloride for 10 min. The seeds were
plated on Murashige and Skoog [30] basal medium
(MS) containing 1 mg/l 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
(2, 4-D) using the method described by Xiang et al. [31]
to induce the production of callus, the source of donor
protoplasts. The callus was subcultured on MB medium
(MS medium supplemented by B5 vitamins [23], 2 mg/l
glycine, 146 mg/l glutamine, 300 mg/l casein hydrolysate, 1 mg/l 2, 4-D, 30 g/l sucrose and 7.5 g/l agar at
pH 5.8) at interval of 15 days. The recipient protoplasts
were obtained from Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd
calli induced in the same way; these have been kept in
culture for 12 years under 18-20 Î¼mol m -2 s -1 cool
white light in MB medium. Protoplasts were isolated
from all calli following established methods [32].
Protoplast fusion and post fusion culture

Preparations of both protoplast types were washed in 0.6
M mannitol, 5 mM CaCl2, then transferred to a 3.5 cm
petridish to form a thin layer. Donor protoplasts were
UV irradiated at 380 Î¼W/cm2 for either 0 s (S1), 30 s
(S2), 1 min (S3), 2 min (S4) or 3 min (S5), after which

Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/71

they were mixed with the recipient protoplasts at a ratio
of 1:1. The fusion protocol followed the PEG method
described by Xia and Chen [32]. Fusion products, which
combinations A-E were corresponding donor protoplasts
S1-S5, were cultured on P5 medium [32]. Once calli had
reached a diameter of 1.5-2.0 mm, they were transferred
to MB2 medium and sub-cultured every two weeks for
1-2 months. At this stage, the calli were removed to a
MB3 solid medium (MB medium supplemented with 1
mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine and 1 mg/l indoleacetic acid).
Regenerated plantlets were transferred to a seedlingstrengthening medium [32].
Callus genotying

Esterase isozymes were extracted from calli and assayed
as described elsewhere [33]. DNA was extracted from
selected calli according to Doyle and Doyle [34], and
used as template for RAPD reactions based on 88 decamer primers (Promega Inc., Madison, Wis.). The PCRs
were conducted according to Xia et al. [35], and the
amplicons were electrophoresed through 1.5% agarose
gels before staining in 0.5 Î¼g/ml ethidium bromide.
These RAPD experiments were repeated at least 3 times
and only the repeatable bands were record.
Mitotic chromosome analysis

Mitotic chromosome spreads from callus and root tip
cells were prepared as described by [20]. For GISH analysis, total genomic S. mussotii DNA was used as the
probe, and the procedure described by Xiang et al. [20]
was applied.
RFLP analyis

Genomic DNA of the putative hybrid cell lines and their
parents was extracted as described previously [34]. For
the analysis of chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt)
DNA, 15-20 Î¼g of total DNA was digested with HindIII
and electrophoresed through 0.8-1% agarose gels in TBE
buffer. The DNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham-Phamarcia, UK) using
0.4 M NaOH. Probe labelling, hybridization, and washing were carried out with the ECL Random Labeling
and detection system (Amersham-Phamarcia, UK)
according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Plasmids
containing mtDNA fragments (coxI) from maize (Zea
mays L.) and a cpDNA fragment (rbcL) from spinach
(Spinacia oleracea L.) were kindly provided by Dr. G.
Spangenberg (Institute for Plant Sciences, Swiss Federal
Institute of Technologies, CH-8092 ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland).
The inserts were cut out of a gel and labelled.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was conducted on total
RNA isolated from hybrid and two parents calli using

Page 8 of 10

the TriZOL reagent (Invitrogen, USA). First strand
cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse
transcriptase M-MLV (TakaRa, Japan), following the
manufacturerâs directions. Degenerate primers targeting the gene from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (Additional file 2) were
applied to the cDNA templates. The amplicons derived
from degenerate primers targeting the two S. mussotii
actin genes SmAct1 and SmAct2 were used to normalize the RT-PCR signal. Each PCR comprised 19-25
cycles of 94Â°C/30 s, 53Â°C/30 s, 72Â°C/90 s, and was
completed with a 10 min extension at 72Â°C. Each PCR
was replicated at least three times, based on independent biological samples.
HPLC analysis

The calli were shade-dried for seven days and ground to
powder. After the addition of 20 ml methanol to 1 g
powdered callus, the resulting suspension was sonicated
for 1 h at room temperature, then filtered through a
0.45 Î¼m membrane filter. A 10 Î¼l aliquot of filtrate was
injected into a LC-10AD HPLC system (Shimadzu Co.,
Japan) equipped with a C18 column (Phenomenex Luna,
4.6 Ã 250 mm i.d., 5 Î¼m). The mobile phase was water:
methanol (75:25), and the outflow (0.8 ml/min) was
scanned at 259 nm [14]. Standards for swertiamarin,
gentiopicroside and mangiferin were provided by the
National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutic and
Biological Products (Beijing, China). All above experiments were carried out four times. In all statistical tests,
values of P lower than 0.05 were interpreted as indicating statistically significant differences. Results were analysed with SAS statistical package (Version5.1, SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis

Methanol extracts of the calli were prepared according
to Liu et al. [36], and then subjected to GC/MS, using a
Micromass GCT gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer
(England) fitted with a DB-5 ms column (0.25 mm Ã 30
m, 0.25 Î¼m film thickness) (J W Scientific, Folsom, CA),
with a helium flow rate of 1 ml/min, and operating at
70 eV ionization voltage with a scan range of 20-600
Da. The column temperature was set at 200Â°C for 2
min, then elevated to 300Â°C at 15Â°C/min and held at
300Â°C for 7 min.
