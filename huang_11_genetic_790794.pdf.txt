Abstract
Background: A complex of incipient species with different degrees of morphological or ecological differentiation
provides an ideal model for studying species divergence. We examined the phylogeography and the evolutionary
history of the Rhododendron pseudochrysanthum s. l.
Results: Systematic inconsistency was detected between gene genealogies of the cpDNA and nrDNA. Rooted at
R. hyperythrum and R. formosana, both trees lacked reciprocal monophyly for all members of the complex. For
R. pseudochrysanthum s.l., the spatial distribution of the cpDNA had a noteworthy pattern showing high genetic
differentiation (FST = 0.56-0.72) between populations in the Yushan Mountain Range and populations of the other
mountain ranges.
Conclusion: Both incomplete lineage sorting and interspecific hybridization/introgression may have contributed to
the lack of monophyly among R. hyperythrum, R. formosana and R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. Independent
colonizations, plus low capabilities of seed dispersal in current environments, may have resulted in the genetic
differentiation between populations of different mountain ranges. At the population level, the populations of
Central, and Sheishan Mountains may have undergone postglacial demographic expansion, while populations of
the Yushan Mountain Range are likely to have remained stable ever since the colonization. In contrast, the single
population of the Alishan Mountain Range with a fixed cpDNA haplotype may have experienced bottleneck/
founder’s events.

Background
The analysis of divergence patterns between species has
been a major focus in systematics and molecular ecology
[1-5]. Species descending from a common ancestor are
expected to differentiate from each other and eventually
attain reciprocal monophyly. Coalescence theory predicts
that sister species are likely to be polyphyletic/paraphyletic in their genetic composition during the early stages
after they split from their common ancestor [cf. [6]].

As sufficient time goes by, they become reciprocally
monophyletic with the loss of complementary haplotypes.
In contrast, lack of monophyly can be a result of several
factors, such as incomplete lineage sorting, gene duplication, or hybridization [7-12]. Of them, hybridization leading to speciation has been known as one of the major
forces for the diversification in plants [13]. As many
hybridizing species remain morphologically discrete [14],
hybrids usually share traits with parental species, often
resulting in taxonomic difficulties. Interspecific gene flow
usually leads to a mixed genetic composition in hybrids,
but may have low impacts on parental species’ genomes
[cf. [15]]. Although molecular tools provide sufficient
power in detecting genetic variation, empirical data on
species delimitation are often difficult to interpret, since

both gene introgression after speciation and shared
ancestral polymorphisms can result in species paraphyly
[15]. A complex of incipient species with different
degrees of morphological or ecological differentiation
provides an ideal model for studying species divergence.
Taiwan, an island of the island-arc system along the
western edge of the Pacific Ocean, first emerged from the
waters via collision between Eurasian and Pacific plates
about 9 million years before present (Proto-Taiwan
Stage), but attained its modern shape only 5-6 million
years ago (MYA) [16,17]. Its rugged topography is characterized by hundreds of steep mountains, which in turn
provide diverse habitats along distinct vegetation zones,
including tropical, coastal evergreen forests, subalpine
shrubs and alpine tundra along the Central Mountain
Range [18]. Taiwan was connected to mainland SE Asia
by a land bridge during lower sea levels of the last glacial
maximum [19,20]; some species may have reached
Taiwan by this route and subsequently become endemic
[2,21].
Phylogeographical patterns and genetic characteristics
of populations/species are shaped by the interaction
between historical vicariance and recurrent genetic
exchanges. These evolutionary events would leave evolutionary footprints in the genetic polymorphisms within
and between populations across the distributional range.
Of the geological events, regular historical glacial cycles
in the Eurasia Continent had prevalent influences on
survival and recolonization of populations/species [11].
Postglacial expansion of alpine species may follow the
phalanx model, which describes the effects of slower
expansions from refugia due to habitat constraints
[2,22,23]. That is, during interglacial periods, alpine species moved upward to peaks and became fragmented. In
contrast, down-slope movement of alpine species during
glacial periods could connect populations that were previously isolated and allow for genetic exchange among
populations [24]. On Taiwan island, only the peaks of
high mountains over 3000 m in elevation were covered
by ice sheets during the glacial maxima.
Rhododendron, one of the largest and most widespread
woody plant genera, is distributed from the northern
temperate zone, throughout tropical Southeast Asia, to
northeastern Australia and consists of over 1000 species
[25]. Hymenanthes, one of eight subgenera comprising
Rhododendron, consists of 225 species, most of them
distributed in the Himalaya-Southwest China region
[25-28]. In Taiwan, 13 taxa occur within Rhododendron
[29]. The R. pseudochrysanthum complex consists of
R. pseudochrysanthum Hayata sensu stricto (s.s.),
R. morii Hayata, and R. rubropunctatum Hayata, all in
subgenus Hymenanthes subsection Maculifera, and all
are phylogenetically related based on molecular analyses
[30-32]. The remaining taxa of subsection Maculifera

Page 2 of 16

occur in west and central China, disjunctly from those
in Taiwan [27]. R. pseudochrysanthum s.s. is an alpine
species (3000-3900 m a.s.l.), while R. morii has a wider
range from 1650-3600 m a.s.l., with some overlap in distribution. In contrast, R. rubropunctatum is restricted to
elevations of 600-1200 m a.s.l. in northern Taiwan. The
three species of R. pseudochrysanthum complex, all distributed along the central mountain range (CMR) and
other mountain ranges west of the CMR, share morphological polymorphisms in leaf shape, petiole and flower
shape, thus making taxonomy difficult, despite the differentiation of ecological distributions [33]. Possibly the
closest relative of this species complex is R. hyperythrum
Hayata, which is also endemic to Taiwan, occurring
1400-3700 m a.s.l. [25,28,29]. This species was previously placed in subsection Pontica [25,34], but phylogenetic work indicates that it is closely related to
R. pseudochrysanthum [28]. These two might be sister
species, but at present a phylogeny of subsection Maculifera is lacking, so this hypothesis cannot yet be tested.
Rhododendron hyperythrum is also known to hybridise
with members of the R. pseudochrysanthum complex [33].
Closely related to R. hyperythrum, the three species of the
R. pseudochrysanthum complex with low morphological
differentiations may be recognized as a single species
(R. pseudochrysanthum sensu lato [s.l.]) [25,28,29,35].
The power of molecular markers in elucidating plant
phylogeography has been detected in many studies
[2,36-41]. Comparative phylogenies between biparental
(nuclear) and uniparental (chloroplast and mitochondrial) markers are useful for resolving phylogeographic
patterns, origin of hybridization, and assessing the
migratory routes of species [40-42]. Because one or both
organelle genomes are often maternally inherited in
plants [43], they are particularly suitable for investigating processes associated with seed dispersal, such as
range expansions [44], contribution of seed movement
to total gene flow [44-47], refugial isolation [48,49], and
origin of maternal or paternal lineage [50].
Previous studies have investigated the phylogeography of
the R. pseudochrysanthum in Taiwan, revealing close relationships among these taxa [30,32,51] and a lack of geographical subdivision. However, little attention has been paid
to the demographic dynamics of R. pseudochrysanthum
across the mountain ranges. In contrast to previous studies,
sampling in this study covered vaster areas, with the aid of
the bureau of the Yushan National Park. The present study
analyzed genetic variation of the R. pseudochrysanthum s.l.
at atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer of cpDNA and the internal
transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of nrDNA. A phylogeographical approach was used to infer past evolutionary history
and processes and to examine species delimitation and
population structure of the species complex. The objectives
of this study were to investigate the following:

Huang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:108
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/108

1. Do the lineages of cpDNA correspond with those of
nrDNA?
2. Given geographical barriers, does significant genetic
differentiation exist among populations of different
mountain ranges?
3. Have the populations of different mountain ranges
of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. experienced different
demographic dynamics?

Results
Genetic variability of cpDNA and nrDNA and genetic
differentiation in the Rhododendron pseudochrysanthum s.l

The cpDNA atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer of R. formosanum, R. hyperythrum, and R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. ranged from 585 to 616 bp. The sequence of alignment of
R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. had 585 bp, including 41 polymorphic sites, of which 15 were parsimony-informative.
Most of these polymorphic sites were single-base and scattered along a sequence. The nrDNA ITS sequences of
R. formosanum, R. hyperythrum, and R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. were aligned with a consensus length of
628 bp. No large indels or rearrangements were detected.
The sequence alignment of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. had
628 bp, including 133 polymorphic sites, of which 49 were
parsimony informative.
With regard to cpDNA, 36 haplotypes (PH01-PH36;
accession numbers: HQ850658 - HQ850693) were identified among 70 samples of the R. pseudochrysanthum s.l.
(Figure 1, additional file 1: Table S1). Nucleotide diversity
(π) detected in R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. was 0.0109 with
high level of haplotype diversity (0.879) (Table 1). High
levels of nucleotide diversity (0.0079) and haplotype
diversity (0.900) were detected in the populations of the
Yushan Mountain Range, while the single population
sampled from the Alishan Mountain Range was fixed at a
single haplotype (Table 1). PH01 was the most common
haplotype shared among the Alishan, Central, and
Sheishan Mountain Ranges. In addition, no haplotypes in
the Yushan Mountain Range (PH04-PH07, PH10-PH15,
PH23-PH26) were shared by other mountain ranges.
For nrDNA, 35 haplotypes (PR01-PR35; accession numbers: HQ850623 - HQ850657) were identified among 70
samples of the R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. (Figure 1, additional file 2: Table S2). Nucleotide diversity detected in
R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. was 0.0114 with a high level of
haplotype diversity (0.881). A high level of nucleotide
diversity (0.0174) with a high level of haplotype diversity
(0.906) were detected in the populations of the Yushan
Mountain Range, while the lowest level of nucleotide
diversity (0.0064) was detected in a single population of
the Alishan mountains (Table 1).
To investigate the genetic structure of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l., a SAMOVA (Table 2) was applied to define
groups and to identify any locations of genetic uniqueness

among the 14 populations. For cpDNA, an assumption
with two groups (K = 2) displayed the greatest value of
FCT and a maximal variance (FCT = 0.6167, P < 0.05). The
groups at K = 2 exactly matched those found in the phylogenetic and network analyses, with those from the Yushan
Mountain Range forming one group (YY, YP, YT) and
those from the other three mountain ranges forming the
other. Genetic structure was significant at three levels
based on the spatial apportionment of genetic variation,
i.e., among geographical groups (61.67%, P < 0.05), among
populations within groups (4.93%, P < 0.05), and within
populations (33.41%, P < 0.05).
The SAMOVA of nrDNA sequences also revealed the
greatest value of FCT and a statistically maximal variance
between two groups (FCT = 0.5889, P < 0.05) (Table 2).
Likewise, a large proportion of the genetic variability
was partitioned among groups, although nonsignificantly
(57.66%, P > 0.05). In contrast, when the three geographical groups of SL vs. SC vs. all others were compared,
structuring with significant variabilities distributed
among groups (54.78%, P < 0.05), among populations
within groups (2.81%, P < 0.05), and within populations
(42.41%, P < 0.05) was identified.
Significant genetic differentiation of cpDNA was detected
between R. pseudochrysanthum s.l.- R. formosanum (FST =
0.73) and R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. - R. hyperythrum (FST
= 0.65). Within R. pseudochrysanthum s.l., significant
genetic differentiation existed between the populations of
the Yushan Mountain Range and the populations of the
other ranges (FST = 0.56-0.72) (Table 3), whereas there was
only little differentiation among the populations of the
Alishan, Central and Sheishan Mountain Ranges (FST =
0.00-0.09). In contrast, lower levels of genetic differentiation of nrDNA were detected between R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. - R. formosanum (F ST = 0.02) and R.
pseudochrysanthum s.l. - R. hyperythrum (FST = 0.04), and
the populations of different mountain ranges of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. (FST = 0.02-0.08).
Gene genealogies and phylogeographical analyses of the
Rhododendron pseudochrysanthum s. l

The ML tree of the cpDNA atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer
haplotypes (Figure 2), rooted at R. formosanum, identified two major clusters I and II. A minimum-spanning
network was also reconstructed based on the mutational
steps between haplotypes of cpDNA (Figure 3). Rhododendron pseudochrysanthum s.l. was identified with
eight mutational steps from R. formosanum. Two major
clusters I and II, corresponding to the ML tree, were
identified with two mutational steps apart.
A ML tree and a minimum-spanning network were
reconstructed of the nrDNA haplotypes, respectively
(Figures 4, 5). In total, clusters A-C were identified, none
of which corresponded to any member of species.

each population is indicated with pie diagrams: Symbols: Alishan Mountain Range (blank circle), Central Mountain Range (black circle), Sheishan
Mountain Range (blank square), and Yushan Mountain Range (black square). See Table 1 for the detailed information of populations.

We also utilized the *BEAST program to analyze the
combined data of cp- and nrDNA sequences. A population tree of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l., rooted at R. formosanum (FH) and R. hyperythrum (HH), was reconstructed
(Figure 6). In contrast to the nuclear DNA tree, none
of the outgroup populations were nested within
R. pseudochrysanthum s.l.
Mismatch distribution analyses of cpDNA were perfomed to infer the long-term demographic history of
populations. For R. pseudochrysanthum s.l., populations of
the Central and Sheishan Mountain Ranges had a unimodal distribution (data not shown). Because the data used
to produce mismatch distributions are not independent
[52], Tajima’s D was then used to detect departure from
population equilibrium. Departures from the null model
can be caused by many factors, such as changes in population size (e.g., expansion), which can lead to an excess of
low frequency variants and negative D values. In contrast,
processes such as population subdivision, or recent population bottlenecks can cause an excess of intermediate frequency variants leading to positive D values [53,54]. Most
values of Tajima’s D in R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. were
negative, except in YT (0.325) and YY (1.057) of the
Yushan Mountain Range (Table 1).
Using the program IM, we were able to refine six model
parameters estimated in MCMC simulations and test for
the isolation with migration model in R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. All of our parameter estimates had unimodal
posterior distributions. The posterior distribution of θother

mtns (scaled effective population size of the Alishan, Central,
and Sheishan Mountain Ranges to neutral mutation rate:
95.43) was larger than that of θYushan (scaled effective population size of the Yushan Mountain Range: 30.81), whereas
the posterior distribution for θA (scaled effective size of the
ancestral population) peaked at 24.80 (Figure 7A). Based on
these θ values, the populations of the Alishan, Central and
Sheishan Mountain Ranges were likely to grow substantially
following divergence, whereas the populations of the
Yushan Mountain Range remained stable or slightly grew
relative to the ancestral population.
When the MLEs for the migration parameters were
transformed into population migration rates, 2Nem = m*
(θ/2) was estimated among the populations of different
mountain ranges. Results from the IM revealed that the
number of migrants between the Yushan Mountain Range
and the other mountain ranges was effectively low. The
posterior distribution of m (scaled effective migration rate)
between the Yushan Mountain Range and the other mountain ranges peaked at 0.005, i.e., both mYushan to other mtns =
0.005 (90% HPD = 0.005-1.035) and mother mtns to Yushan =
0.005 (90% HPD = 0.005-0.195), which were much lower
than the m values among Alishan, Central, and Sheishan
Mountain Ranges (m = 0.25-13.45)(Figure 7). All of the
non-zero m values, nevertheless, implied the occurrence of
historical gene flow between populations (Figure 7B).
To elucidate the contribution of hybridization/introgression to the lack of species monophyly of R. formosanum,
R. hyperythrum and R. pseudochrysanthum s.l., we

including R. formosanum, R. hyperythrum, and R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. could be traced back to a common
ancestor ca. 2.897-8.724 MYA. All sequences of R.
hyperythrum and R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. coalesced at
ca. 2.896-8.722 MYA. All cpDNA sequences of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. coalesced at ca. 2.895-8.722 MYA,
while those of R. hyperythrum coalesced at ca. 0.6541.981 MYA. Likewise, the nrDNA sequences including
R. formosanum, R. hyperythrum, and R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. could be traced back to a common ancestor
about 1.905-2.961 MYA. All nrDNA sequences of R.
pseudochrysanthum s.l. and R. hyperythrum coalesced to
a common ancestor ca. 1.879-2.912 MYA. All nrDNA

estimated the m values among these species. The posterior
distribution of m among these species peaked at non-zero
values (mpseudochrysanthum s. l. to formosanum = 1.35, 90% HPD

sequences of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. coalesced to a
common ancestor ca. 1.879-2.909 MYA, while those of
R. hyperythrum coalesced at ca. 1.669-2.620 MYA.
To elucidate the possible evolutionary forces for the lack
of species monophyly of R. formosanum, R. hyperythrum
and R. pseudochrysanthum s.l., we calculated the expected
time to coalescence at cpDNA [1.665 × θ/4U] and at
nrDNA[1.665 × θ/2U], where θ is a population mutation
parameter obtained from IM, and U is the geometric mean
of mutation rates, and compared them with the divergence
times obtained from the BEAST analyses. According to the
IM estimates of θother mtns = 95.43 and θYushan = 30.81, the
expected time to coalescence of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l.
ranged from 4.36 to 29.21 MYA based on cpDNA, and
from 8.72 to 58.42 MYA based on nrDNA.

Discussion
Systematic inconsistency between nuclear and chloroplast
DNAs in Rhododendron pseudochrysanthum s.l

Inconsistency in the cpDNA and nrDNA phylogenies
(Figure 2 & 3) was detected in R. formosanum. The
ML tree for the cpDNA agreed with the results of
Chamberlain et al. [25] and Goetsch et al. [28] that R.
formosanum is a monophyletic group relative to R.
pseudochrysanthum s.l. In contrast, the ML tree of

nrDNA revealed that one accession of R. formosanum
fell within cluster B with the ingroup species. Lack of
species monophyly may result from incomplete lineage
sorting, which occurs when populations or species
recently diverged, thus retaining ancestral genetic polymorphisms, or from genetic exchanges via hybridization and introgression that introduce foreign alleles
into a species or population, resulting in a genetic
admixture [10]. For given species, the time for a locus
to acquire reciprocal monophyly is about 1.665 × θ/4U
at cpDNA or 1.665 × θ/2U at nrDNA. Willyard et al.
[55] suggest that ancestral polymorphisms would likely
be shared between species if the coalescence time of
the alleles exceeds the divergence time at one locus. In
this study, the expected time to coalescence of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. (4.36-29.21 MYA) overlapped the
estimates of divergence time (2.895-8.722 MYA) based
on cpDNA, in which monophyly was attained. In contrast, at the nrDNA, the expected time for coalescence
(8.72-58.42 MYA) predated the divergence time (1.8792.909 MYA). Accordingly, nuclear loci would less likely
be monophyletic in R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. Incomplete lineage sorting alone, apparently, cannot completely explain the paraphyly of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l.
Interspecific hybridization that disturbs the reciprocal

monophyly needs to be aroused based on the non-zero
m parameters between R. formosanum-R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. (mpseudochrysanthum s. l. to formosanum = 1.35,
90% HPD = 0.55-2.65; m formosanum to pseudochrysanthum
s. l. = 2.25, 90% HPD = 0.75-4.25) and R. hyperythrumR. pseudochrysanthum s.l. (mpseudochrysanthum s. l. to hyperythrum = 0.05, 90% HPD = 0.05-1.05; mhyperythrum to pseudo chrysanthum s. l. = 0.15, 90% HPD = 0.05-1.85).
Furthermore, Milne et al. [56,57] revealed that natural
hybridization/introgression is not unusual in Rhododendron. Thus, interspecific hybridization/introgression
would cause the lack of monophyly and prolong the
duration of paraphyly, as frequently occurs in most
plants, e.g., Ixeris [58], Begonia [59], and Ilex [60].
Genetic diversity and population structure of R.
pseudochrysanthum s.l

In this study, we investigated genetic diversity at the
cpDNA and nrDNA loci of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l.

High levels of nucleotide diversity were detected at both
cpDNA and nrDNA loci, agreeing with a pattern found
in many East Asian plants, that is considered to have
been shaped by a common glaciation history [cf. [11]].
During the Quaternary glaciations, Taiwan, as a refuge,
provided shelters for species from a range of biomes
and thus harbored much plant biodiversity. Examples
include Cunninghamia konishii [21], Pinus luchuensis
ssp. taiwanensis [2], Cycas taitungensis [41], and Cycas
revoluta [1]. A potential refugium for R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. in Taiwan was inferred to harbor the
genetic variations. Furthermore, highly diverse environments may also have created a wide spectrum of habitats to accommodate mutations [38].
The populations of the Yushan Mountain Range had
the highest levels of genetic diversity (0.0079) in the
cpDNA. A similar pattern was found in Taiwan fir
(Abies kawakamii), a dominant species of subalpine forests at 2500-3700 m a.s.l. [61]. This common result is

likely to be attributable to a stable population size in the
Yushan Mountain Range. The habitat ranges of the
Yushan Mountain Range, with the highest peak at 3952
m, are wider than those of the other mountain ranges
(3886 m at most), providing diverse habitats for R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. Given a stable, effective population
size under diverse habitats, the populations of the
Yushan Mountain Range fostered a great number of
genetic polymorphisms. In contrast, genetic diversity
can be lost by chance in fragmented populations, as
occurred in the population of the Alishan Mountain
Range. PH01, the interior dominant haplotype, is shared
among the Alishan, Central, and Sheishan mountain
ranges. A single population of the Alishan Mountain
Range was fixed for the dominant haplotype PH01, indicating a possible genetic bottleneck due to a founder
effect and/or genetic drift during a period when population sizes were small [62].
Genetic structure of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l

R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. inhabits mountaintops isolated by surrounding low-elevation habitats, forming
small and fragmented patches. Genetic differentiation
would be detected between these isolated populations of

different mountain ranges. Nevertheless, genetic analysis
of the cpDNA variation revealed very weak genetic differentiation among the populations within a mountain
range. The short time of isolation since the last glacial
retreat is seemingly not long enough for differentiating
these populations within a mountain range and thus
resulted in sharing ancestral genetic polymorphisms.
Specifically, spatial distribution of cpDNA revealed a
noteworthy pattern of high differentiation between
populations of the Yushan Mountain Range and the
other mountain ranges (FST = 0.56-0.72) (Table 3). The
divergence time for R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. is about
2.895-8.722 MYA, and given that within R. pseudochrysanthum s.l., the populations from different mountain
ranges are more differentiated than the species, then it
follows that this divergence time likely reflects an estimated divergence time between mountain populations.
Molecular dating revealed that populations among different mountain ranges split some 2.895-8.722 MYA, a
time range approximating or predating the formation of
the Central Mountain Range of Taiwan [16]. Independent colonizations via individuals with two different
subclusters, likely from adjacent mainland over Pleistocene, may result in high genetic differentiation within

R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. Unexpected genetic structuring was detected with populations of the Yushan Mountain Range highly differentiated from other mountain
ranges, despite this range lying between the Alishan and
the Central Mountain Ranges. The single population of
the Alishan Mountain Range was fixed at the dominant
haplotype PH01, which was shared by the populations
of the Central and Sheishan Mountain Ranges. Some
other haplotypes may have been randomly lost from the
Alishan population due to possible bottleneck/founder’s
events. Despite the fact that the Alishan Mountain
Range is geographically distant to Central and Sheishan
Mountain Ranges, sharing the dominant PH01 made
these populations clustered together and genetically
undifferentiated. Furthermore, subsequent glacial retreat
and mountain uplifting triggered the geographical isolations and may have thereby enhanced the divergence of
populations among different mountain ranges.
Today, over an interglacial period, Rhododendron
populations of different mountain ranges represent

some isolated patches. Given such geographical barriers,
seeds are less likely to disperse across mountain ranges.
Low capabilities of seed dispersal in current environments, plus possible independent colonization events
followed by limited historical gene flow (Figure 7), may
have together contributed to the high levels of genetic
differentiation between populations of the Yushan
Mountain Range and the other mountain ranges (FST =
0.56-0.72). In contrast, low levels of genetic differentiation at cpDNA detected among the populations of
Alishan, Central and Sheishan Mountain Ranges (FST =
0.00-0.09) implied that there may exist historical gene
flow during the glacial maxima, as the alpine populations migrated downwards and became connected to
each other (Table 3).
Compared to the high genetic differentiation among
populations between Yushan Mountain Range and the
other mountain ranges based on cpDNA, nrDNA
revealed much less differentiation among populations of
different mountain ranges (FST = 0.02-0.08) (Tables 2,
3). Here, biparentally inherited nrDNA was used to estimate the extent of pollen flow. In contrast to the limited
seed dispersal, pollen of Rhododendron species seemingly can move long distances [63,64]. Long-distance
pollen dispersal of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. across the
discontinuity of mountain ranges reduced the genetic
differentiation.

Ancestral population size, gene flow, and population
dynamics of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l

Given their different inheritances, nrDNA and cpDNA
markers provide extensive aspects to the understanding
of the evolutionary forces shaping fates of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. Combining cpDNA and nrDNA data,
IM analysis was used to evaluate the ancestral population size and gene flow. Populations of the Alishan,
Central, and Sheishan Mountain Ranges were characterized by a recent population expansion as θother mtns was
approximately four times larger than ancestral θA [65].
Star-like genealogies of cpDNA and negative Tajima’s D
of cpDNA and nrDNA (Table 1) also supported a scenario of recent demographic expansion in populations
of the Central and Sheishan Mountain Ranges, a common pattern also occurring in Castanopsis carlesii [66],
Cunninghamia konishii [67], and Trema dielsiana [68].
In contrast, the value of θYushan approximated ancestral
θA, indicating that the effective population size of the
Yushan Mountain Range may have remained stable relative to the ancestral population.
Given low seed dispersal capabilities of Rhododendron
in today’s environments, non-zero migration rates
(2Nem) detected among populations (m = 0.05-13.45)
likely represented historical gene flow across mountain
ranges. Here, compared to the gene flow among populations of Alishan, Central, and Sheishan Mountain

Huang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:108
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/108

Ranges, with m = 0.25-13.45, much lower levels of
migration rates were detected between populations of
the Yushan Mountain Range and other mountain ranges
(m Yushan to other mtns = 0.005, m other mtns to Yushan =
0.005). Even so, higher levels of migration rates detected
from populations of the Yushan Mountain Range to
those of the Alishan (m = 1.275) and Sheishan (m =
0.750) Mountain Range further indicated asymmetric
gene flow among them. In contrast, historical dispersal
may have occurred freely among other populations.
That is, during glacial maxima, there may exist corridors
among the mountain ranges. These corridors allowed
frequent gene flow among populations of Alishan, Central, and Sheishan Mountain Ranges, and occasional
gene flow between populations of the Yushan Mountain
Range and the other mountain ranges. Altogether, populations of these mountain ranges may have been
mediated with different levels of historical gene flow
during the glacial maxima.

Conclusions
In this study, inconsistent gene genealogies of cpDNA and
nrDNA were detected. In the cpDNA tree, agreeing with
Chamberlain et al. [25], R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. is phylogenetically more closely related to R. hyperythrum than
to R. formosanum. In contrast, nrDNA failed to identify
reciprocal monophyly of ingroup vs. outgroup, indicating
possible incomplete lineage sorting and interspecific hybridization/introgression. For R. pseudochrysanthum s.l., the
spatial distribution of cpDNA revealed a noteworthy pattern of high differentiation between the populations of the
Yushan Mountain Range and the populations of the other
mountain ranges. Molecular dating revealed that the split
of the populations at different mountain ranges approximated or predated the formation of the Central Mountain
Range of Taiwan island, likely suggesting independent
colonizations via individuals from previously differentiated
populations on the mainland. At the population level, the
populations of Central, and Sheishan Mountain Ranges
may have undergone postglacial demographic expansion,
while populations of the Yushan Mountain Range are
likely to have remained stable ever since the colonization.
In contrast, the single population of the Alishan Mountain
Range with a fixed cpDNA haplotype may have experienced bottleneck/founder’s events.
Methods
Sample collection, DNA extraction, PCR, and DNA
sequencing

We assessed the levels of genetic variation of cpDNA
(atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer) and nrDNA ITS sequences
among populations of Rhododendron pseudochrysanthum
s.l. (Table 1). In addition, R. formosanum Hemsl. (subgenus Hymenanthes subsection Argyrophylla [25]), and

Page 12 of 16

R. hyperythrum (subgenus Pontica subsection Maculifera) were selected to serve as outgroups. In the field,
R. hyperythrum is sympatric with R. pseudochrysanthum
s.l., while R. formosanum is allopatric from two other species. Morphologically, R. hyperythrum and R. formosanum are distinguishable from R. pseudochrysanthum s.l.
According to Goetsch et al. [28], R. pseudochrysanthum
s.l. is phylogenetically more related to R. hyperythrum
than to R. formosanum. A total of 70 R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. individuals were collected from 14 populations throughout their natural range, mostly from four
major mountain ranges in Taiwan, i.e., Alishan, Central,
Sheishan and Yushan Mountain Ranges (Figure 1 and
Table 1). One to 12 individuals about 100 m apart were
sampled based on the natural size of each population.
Young, healthy leaves were collected in the field, rinsed
with tap water, and dried in silica gel. All samples were
stored at -70°C until processing.
Leaf tissue was ground to powder in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -70°C. Total genomic DNA was extracted from
the powdered tissue using a cetyltrimethyl ammonium
bromide (CTAB) procedure [69]. PCR amplification was
carried out in a 100-μL reaction. The reaction was optimized and programmed on a MJ Thermal Cycler (PTC
100) (MJ, Alameda, California, USA) as one cycle of denaturation at 95°C for 4 min; 30 cycles of 45 s denaturation
at 92°C, 1 min 15 s annealing at 52°C, and 1 min 30 s
extension at 72°C; followed by 10 min extension at 72°C.
Template DNA was denatured with reaction buffer,
MgCl 2 , NP-40 and ddH2O for 4 min (first cycle), and
cooled on ice immediately. Primers, for the ITS (ITS5:
5’-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3’ and ITS4:
5’-TCCTCCGCTATATGATATGC-3’) [70] or cpDNA
atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer (atpB-1: 5’-ACATCKARTACKGGACC AATAA-3’ and rbcL-1: 5’-AACACCA
GCTTTRAATCCAA-3’) [71], dNTP and Taq polymerase
(Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) were added to the
above ice-cold mix. The reaction was restarted at the first
annealing at 52°C.
PCR products were purified by electrophoresis in 1.0%
agarose gel using 1X TAE buffer. The gel was stained
with ethidium bromide, and the desired DNA band was
cut and eluted using agarose gel purification (Qiagen,
Valencia, California, USA). Both direct and subcloning
sequencing was conducted to check PCR error. Chloroplast DNA sequences were determined by direct sequencing, while nrDNA was sequenced via subcloning. For
subcloning, the desired DNA fragments were cloned
into the pGEM-T vector system (Promega, Madison,
Wisconsin, USA). Seven clones of the plasmid DNA
were selected randomly and purified using a plasmid
mini kit (Qiagen). DNA sequencing in both directions
was conducted with an Applied Biosystems Model 377A
automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster,

Huang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:108
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/108

California, USA). No within-individual variation was
detected for either DNA marker.
Data analysis

Nucleotide sequences were aligned with the program
MAFFT version 6 [72] and later adjusted visually. After
the alignment, maximum-likelihood (ML) analyses (HKY
model) were performed with PhyML v3.0 [73], and bootstrap consensus values were calculated with 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. Nucleotide substitution models
were determined with the Akaike Information Criterion
by ModelTest 3.7 analysis [74,75]. The HKY + I + G
model with 6 substitution categories was determined to
be the most suitable model by Modeltest and was used
for all subsequent nucleotide analyses. The number of
mutations between DNA sequence haplotypes in pairwise
comparisons was used to construct a minimum-spanning
network with the aid of the MINSPNET [76] in a hierarchical manner [77].
To reconstruct the phylogeny of populations, the combined data of both cp- and nrDNA sequences were analyzed by the program *BEAST v1.5.4 (Bayesian
Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees)[78]. This method
uses coalescent theory to provide joint inferences of a
species tree topology, divergence times, population sizes
and gene trees from multiple genes sampled from multiple individuals across a set of closely related species.
Levels of genetic diversity within populations and species were quantified with measures of nucleotide diversity (π) [79] using DnaSP Version 5.1 [80]. Patterns of
geographical subdivision and levels of genetic differentiation among populations were estimated hierarchically
with the aid of DnaSP. Mismatch distribution analyses
and Tajima’s D were also conducted [81].
SAMOVA (spatial analysis of molecular variance) was
applied to identify groups of geographically adjacent
populations of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. that were
maximally differentiated based on sequence data [82].
We performed the analyses based on 100 simulated
annealing steps and examined maximum indicators of
differentiation (F CT values) when the program was
assigned to identify K = 2-6 partitions of populations.
Isolation with migration and estimating of ancestral
population size

We used the simulation program IM [83] to investigate
the scenario of isolation with migration between populations. By applying coalescence simulations and Bayesian
computation procedures, IM yielded six model parameters, including the population-split time (t = tμ), scaled
migration rates (m = m/μ), and scaled effective population
size (θ = 4Neμ) for the ancestral and two current populations. The posterior probability densities of these parameters were generated by Markov chain Monte Carlo

Page 13 of 16

(MCMC) simulations, and three of these simulations were
run with individual simulations being updated 50 million
times. Within each simulation, we used a procedure to
swap among 10 heated chains (Metropolis coupling). Each
simulation yielded a marginal density histogram for the six
parameters of interest, and the peaks of the resulting distributions were considered as the maximum likelihood
estimates (MLE) of the parameter with credibility intervals
equaling the 90% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals. Here we compared populations of the Yushan Mountain Range with other populations of three different
mountain ranges based on the results of FST analyses.
Parameters in the IM model are scaled by the mutation
rates per generation for the loci, i.e., μ = UG, where U is
the geometric mean of mutation rates of all the loci and G
is the generation time.
Estimation of divergence times of cpDNA and nrDNA
lineages

In the present study, we estimated the divergence time
of the sister lineages of R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. split
for both cp- and nrDNAs using a Bayesian relaxed clock
method with BEAST. We excluded sequences of 18S,
5.8S and 26S RNA regions of nrDNA from the calculation of the divergent time. To estimate the divergence
between lineages a well-supported mutation rate is
required. In this study, applying evolutionary rates of
1.0-3.0 × 10-9 [84] and 5.0-7.8 × 10-9 [85] substitutions
per site per year for synonymous sites of cpDNA and
nrDNA, respectively, we estimated the divergence times
of cpDNA and nrDNA lineages for R. hyperythrum and
R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. Additionally, Bayesian estimates of the divergence time of the MRCA of the
R. pseudochrysanthum s.l. clusters were obtained using
BEAST v. 1.3; available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/
Main_Page[86]. Following the result of ModelTest analysis [75], the HKY model of nucleotide substitution
with estimated base frequencies, gamma shape distribution (with six categories), proportion of invariant sites,
and a relaxed clock with uncorrelated log normal distribution of branch lengths were chosen. Posterior estimates of the mutation rate and divergence time were
obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, with
samples drawn every 500 steps over a total of 1 million
steps. All operators were automatically optimized. Convergence of parameters and mixing of chains were followed by visual inspection of parameter trend lines and
checking effective sampling size (ESS) values with three
pre-runs. The ESS parameter was found to exceed 100,
which suggests acceptable mixing and sufficient sampling. Adequate sampling and convergence to a stationary distribution were checked using TRACER v. 1.3 [87].
There are two primary processes that may cause a
locus to show non-monophyly for a group of closely

Huang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:108

related species, i.e., incomplete lineage sorting and
hybridization/introgression. Distinguishing between
these two processes is difficult, nevertheless, estimates
of divergence time can provide a means of assessing the
probability that incomplete lineage sorting alone could
account for the observed non-monophyly. The expected
time for a locus to become monophyletic following
divergence from a sister lineage is 1.665 × NeG and
1.665 × 2NeG for cp- and nuclear DNAs, respectively
[55,88]. According to IM [83], the effective population
size can be estimated as Ne = θ/(4UG). Therefore, the
former is then equal to 1.665 × θ/4U, while the latter is
1.665 × θ/2U. Here, θ values were obtained from IM
analyses, and U is the geometric mean of mutation rates
of cp- and nrDNAs.
