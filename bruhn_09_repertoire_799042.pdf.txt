Abstract
Background: Defensins represent an important class of antimicrobial peptides. These effector
molecules of the innate immune system act as endogenous antibiotics to protect the organism
against infections with pathogenic microorganisms. Mammalian defensins are classified into three
distinct sub-families (α-, β- and θ-defensins) according to their specific intramolecular disulfidebond pattern. The peptides exhibit an antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of
microorganisms including bacteria and fungi. Alpha-Defensins are primarily synthesised in
neutrophils and intestinal Paneth cells. They play a role in the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases
and may regulate the flora of the intestinal tract. An equine intestinal α-defensin (DEFA1), the first
characterised in the Laurasiatheria, shows a broad antimicrobial spectrum against human and equine
pathogens. Here we report a first investigation of the repertoire of equine intestinal α-defensins.
The equine genome was screened for putative α-defensin genes by using known α-defensin
sequences as matrices. Based on the obtained sequence information, a set of oligonucleotides
specific to the α-defensin gene-family was designed. The products generated by reversetranscriptase PCR with cDNA from the small intestine as template were sub-cloned and numerous
clones were sequenced.
Results: Thirty-eight equine intestinal α-defensin transcripts were determined. After translation it
became evident that at least 20 of them may code for functional peptides. Ten transcripts lacked
matching genomic sequences and for 14 α-defensin genes apparently present in the genome no
appropriate transcript could be verified. In other cases the same genomic exons were found in
different transcripts.
Conclusions: The large repertoire of equine α-defensins found in this study points to a particular
importance of these peptides regarding animal health and protection from infectious diseases.
Moreover, these findings make the horse an excellent species to study biological properties of αdefensins. Interestingly, the peptides were not found in other species of the Laurasiatheria to date.
Comparison of the obtained transcripts with the genomic sequences in the current assembly of the
horse (EquCab2.0) indicates that it is yet not complete and/or to some extent falsely assembled.

Background
Antimicrobial peptides are effector molecules of the
innate immune system which provides the first line of
defense against a wide variety of microbes [1]. These peptides act as endogenous antibiotics protecting the organism against infections with pathogenic microorganisms
[2]. Antimicrobial peptides are synthesised by circulating
phagocytic cells, leucocytes and epithelial cells of mucosal
tissues. Defensins are an important class of antimicrobial
peptides which can be found in plants [3], invertebrates
[4] and vertebrates [5]. Defensins are cationic and
cysteine-rich peptides with a molecular structure consisting of three antiparallel β-sheets [2]. They contain six
highly conserved cysteine residues forming characteristic
intramolecular disulfide bonds. Mammalian defensins
are classified into three distinct sub-families due to the
disulfide array: α-, β- und θ-defensins [6]. The peptides
exhibit a direct antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria [7], fungi [8] and enveloped
viruses [9]. Defensins are thought to kill bacteria by an initial electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged
phospholipids of the microbial cytoplasmatic membrane,
followed by membrane permeabilisation and lysis of the
microbes [10,11].
Unlike β-defensins that have been found in numerous tissues and in all mammals studied so far, α-defensins are
presumably unique to a few tissues and are absent in
some mammalian species. Alpha-defensin gene expression was observed in humans, mice [12], rhesus macaques
[13], rats [14], rabbits [15], guinea pigs [16], hamsters
[17] and the horse [18]. They were also identified in silico
in the genome of the opossum [19], elephant, and hedgehog tenrec [20]. The peptides are absent in the genomes of
cattle [21] and dog [22]. Additionally, α-defensins are
mainly synthesised in neutrophilic granulocytes and in
Paneth cells [23]. Paneth cells are secretory epithelial cells,
which are most abundant in the distal small intestine at
the base of the crypts of Lieberkuhn. Based on the current
state of knowledge, the horse is the only species in the
group of Laurasiatheria expressing α-defensins. The first
equine α-defensin transcript was found in the intestine of
the horse [18]. The authors showed that the transcript,
named DEFA1, was exclusively produced in the small
intestine together with another α-defensin (DEFA5L),
known from an equine BAC-clone [24]. Enteric αdefensins play an important role in the defence of the
intestinal tract against microbes and may regulate the
flora of enteric bacteria [25]. Dysfunctions in the regulation of intestinal α-defensins or mutations can lead to
serious diseases like Morbus Crohn [26], and to a higher
susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases [27] or
diarrhea [28].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/631

The antimicrobial properties of recombinant equine
DEFA1 were comprehensively studied. An antimicrobial
effect was observed against 22 Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacterial strains and one yeast [18,29]. Among
them are prominent human and equine pathogens like
Staphlylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia
coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus equi and Rhodococcus equi.
The antimicrobial potency of equine DEFA1 and the general importance of intestinal defensins on animal health
make them interesting candidates for further antimicrobial and functional characterisations. This motivated us to
analyse the repertoire of the equine intestinal α-defensins
in detail. Initial genomic in silico analyses with DEFA1and DEFA5L sequences as matrices led to an identification
of numerous unknown putative α-defensin sequences.
Based on this information a set of oligonucleotides specific to the α-defensin gene-family was designed and RTPCR products were generated with cDNA from the small
intestine as template.

Methods
Tissue collection and RNA extraction
Tissue from the centre of the outstreched small intestine
of one horse was collected immediately after death during
slaughtering and was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Approval
of an ethics committee was not necessary since the tissue
collection was done during the routine processes in an
abattoir. Approximately 300 mg of frozen tissue were disrupted with a mortar and homogenised using a rotor-stator homogeniser. Total RNA was extracted by using the
RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to
the manufacturer's guidelines. The RNA concentration
was determined photometrically by measuring the UVabsorption of the sample. One unit of the optical density
at 260 nm equates to a concentration of 40 μg total RNA.
The extracted RNA was stored at -80°C.
Genomic analysis with α-defensin sequences as matrices
By using the known equine α-defensin sequences DEFA5L
([GenBank:AM039964]; [24]) and DEFA1 ([GenBank:EF379126]; [18]) as matrices, a BLAST-search
("blastn") in the nr/nt- and wgs-databases of the horse
assembly EquCab1.0 was performed to obtain nucleotide
sequences resembling α-defensin genes. This genomic
sequence information represented the basis to design a set
of oligonucleotides for the following RT-PCR studies.
Conceptual design of oligonucleotides for RT-PCRreactions
Forward oligonucleotides were designed according to the
genomic sequences determined by the in silico approach
with following assumptions: (1) Oligonucleotides should
include the ATG-start codon of the putative α-defensin

Page 2 of 13

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/631

genes or alternatively should bind a few bases upstream of
the ATG so that in both cases the complete cDNA
sequence could be amplified. (2) The set of forward oligonucleotides should amplify all the sequences determined
by the in silico approach if combined with an oligo-dTnucleotide used as a reverse oligonucleotide. Therefore
some forward oligonucleotides contain wobble-bases. (3)
Each forward oligonucleotide should amplify a single
product in combination with the oligo-dT-nucleotide.
The 18 forward oligonucleotides and the oligo-dT-nucleotide are listed in Table 1. The oligonucleotides were synthesised by biomers.net (Ulm, Germany).
RT-PCR
The cDNA was synthesised by using the Superscript-Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) in combination
with an oligo-dT-nucleotide (Oligo-dT-Bio, Table 1)
according to Schramm et al. [30]. Total RNA from the
small intestine served as a template. The cDNA was stored
at -20°C.

PCR reactions were performed by using the forward oligonucleotides (Table 1) paired with the reverse primer (TailPrimer3', Table 1) and the cDNA from the small intestine
as template. The optimal annealing temperature for the
PCR reactions was determined by performing a temperature-gradient-PCR in a range from 50-68°C. The reaction
mixtures were incubated at 94°C for 3 min, followed by
33 cycles at 55°C (alpha1-alpha7), 58°C (alpha2-2, 2-6,
2-8), 60°C (alpha2-7), 62°C (alpha2-3, 2-9, 2-11) or

67°C (alpha2-1, 2-4, 2-5, 2-10) for 50 s, 68°C for 45 s,
and 94°C for 30 s. A final extension step was performed
at 68°C for 10 min. Hot-Start-polymerase (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) was used for PCR-reactions (1.5 U/
reaction) with the appropriate buffer. The final dNTP concentration was 3 nM, the oligonucleotide concentration
3.35 pM. PCR reactions were performed with the Thermal-Cycler PTC-200 (GMI, Minnesota, USA).
The amplified products were purified by gel extraction
from a 1.5% agarose gel with the Gel-Extraction-Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's
specifications and enriched with 1 mM guanosine to stabilise the DNA.
Subcloning
After purification 65 ng of each amplified product was
cloned into a pDrive-cloning vector and transformed into
E. coli cells (Qiagen competent cells, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer's specifications (Subcloning-Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A volume of 100 μl of
the bacterial suspension was transferred to an LB-agar
plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 80 μg/ml XGal
and 50 μM IPTG for blue/white screening. A single agar
plate was used for each oligonucleotide combination or
PCR-product, respectively. Accordingly 18 agar plates
were inoculated. The plates were incubated for 18 h at
37°C and finally for 3 h at 4°C.

Twenty colonies per plate were selected (a total of 360 colonies) and transferred to 24-well plates (Sarstedt, Nüm-

brecht, Germany) whose wells were filled with LB-agar
enriched with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A colony PCR was
performed with the oligonucleotides T7 promoter-oligo
in combination with the SP6 promoter-oligo (Table 1) to
confirm the presence of the inserted product. Therefore,
each colony was used as a template and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35
cycles at 50°C for 50 s, 68°C for 50 s, and 94°C for 25 s.
A final extension step was performed at 68°C for 10 min.
The Hot-Start-polymerase (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) was used (1.5 U/reaction) with the appropriate
buffer. The oligonucleotide concentration was 3.35 pM,
the dNTP concentration 3 nM.
Sequencing of individual clones
Two hundred and sixty-nine positive clones were selected
for sequencing. The sequencing reactions were performed
at the Institute for Services in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (DLMBC) in Berlin, Germany. The colonies
embedded in the 24-well plates were directly sent to the
DLMBC. Sequencing reactions were performed with the
oligonucleotides T7 promoter-oligo and SP6 promoteroligo (Table 1), products were sequenced forward and
reverse.
Evaluation of the cDNA-sequences
The obtained sequences were evaluated by using the software programs BioEdit 7.0.4.1 ([31]; http://
www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/BioEdit.html)
and
Sequencher 4.8 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor,
USA; http://www.genecodes.com).

Matching forward and reverse sequences were compared
(BioEdit 7.0.4.1). Sequences with discrepancies based on
the sequencing reaction were excluded. Sequences with an
identity exceeding 99% were pooled into one contig
(Sequencher 4.8) and the consensus sequence was created. Ambiguities at certain base positions (nucleotide
polymorphisms) can be due to an amplification error of
the polymerase, a sequencing error, possible gene duplications, or an SNP. The most frequent base at a position was
chosen for the consensus sequence. Some of the
sequences could not be integrated into a contig and were
consequently treated separately.
To prove this method of evaluation, the sequences were
processed in an alternative way: DNA-sequences with an
identity of 100% were pooled into contigs (Sequencher
4.8) and the consensus sequences were created. The contigs and discrete sequences were translated. The resulting
amino acid sequences were aligned and sequences with an
identity of more than 99% were again pooled into contigs
(Sequencher 4.8). In the case of varieties at one position,
the most frequent amino acid at this position was chosen
for the consensus sequence but according to the following

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/631

premises: First, an amino acid was exchanged only if
solely this amino acid at the specific position inside the
contig was ambiguous. If two or more amino acids were
ambiguous at one specific position, a new contig was created. Secondly, inside an amino acid sequence only one
amino acid exchange was allowed, otherwise the sequence
was processed as an individual peptide. Finally, the amino
acid sequences obtained by using the first method were
aligned with the sequences obtained from the second one.
Comparison of the transcripts with genomic sequences
To confirm the transcripts a genome-screening was performed in the equine database with the cDNA-sequences
as templates to recover the genes associated with the transtripts. To determine the genomic positions of the
obtained transcripts we performed a database search using
BLAT http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat with the following settings: genome, Horse; assembly, September
2007; query type, DNA.

The cDNA sequences from the ATG-start codon to the end
of the 3'-UTR of the transcripts were used. If the identity
of a transcript and a genomic region exceeded a value of
99%, they were defined as matching. We compared not
only the whole transcript with the genomic sequence but
also the individual exons. We excluded false-positive
matches of whole transcripts based on a high identity of a
single exon (>99.5%) but low identity (<99%) of the
other exon. For example: With DEFA3 we found a matching genomic sequence showing an identity of 99.1%,
whereas exon 1 shows an identity of 100% and exon 2
only 97.5% (this is equivalent to a difference of 3 bp).
Accordingly, a complete transcript was only matched to a
gene if both the first and the second exon showed an identity exceeding 99%.

Results

Genomic α-defensin sequences
Twenty-nine different nucleotide sequences resembling αdefensin genes were obtained from the wgs-database of
the horse by using the DEFA5L- and DEFA1 sequences as
search matrices. The accession numbers and positions of
the genomic sequences are shown in Table 2.
Repertoire of the α-defensin transcripts
The alignment of cDNA-sequences with an identity of
more than 99% resulted in a total of 37 different cDNA
sequences. After translation of the cDNA sequences 35 different amino acid sequences could be determined (first
evaluation method).

In the case of the second evaluation method a total of 150
different cDNA sequences resulted if all cDNA-sequences
with an identity of 100% were aligned. After translation
and alignment of the amino acid sequences with an iden-

tity of 100%, 98 different peptides were found. The amino
acid sequences were finally corrected as described in the
Material section and as a result 34 different peptide
sequences were obtained.
The 35 amino acid sequences of the first evaluation
method were aligned with the 34 sequences obtained with
the second evaluation method and peptides with an identity of 100% were combined. An alignment of the resulting 38 different peptide sequences is shown in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2. Table 3 shows the number of obtained clones along
with the cDNA sequences corresponding to the amino
acid sequences shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 and the accession numbers of the equine α-defensin transcripts.
All sequences are in a range of 25 to 124 amino acid residues but not all sequences seem to be potentially functional α-defensins. In some sequences typical conserved
α-defensin motives are missing in the mature peptide seg-

ment. These include the cysteine residues, necessary for
the typical defensin disulfide-bond connectivity; arginine
and glutamate residues, forming a conserved salt bridge
[32]; and a highly conserved glycine residue, essential for
correct folding [33]. The peptides DEFA20 to DEFA29
contain the six cysteine residues at position 66, 68, 74, 84,
96, and 97 and the glycine residue at position 82 but they
have lost the intramolecular salt bridge. DEFA30L is also
missing the salt bridge and additionally the two cysteine
residues at positions 66 and 84. The peptides DEFA31L to
DEFA37L exhibit a premature stop codon, the translation
stopped at position 77 (DEFA31L to DEFA34L), 78
(DEFA35L, DEFA36L) or at position 26 visible in the
appropriate cDNA sequence. DEFA30L to DEFA37L
appear to be pseudogenes. In the case of DEFA20 to
DEFA29 it has to be proved whether the intramolecular
salt bridge leads to a loss of the biological function.
DEFA1 to DEFA19 and DEFA5L show all conserved amino
acid motives typical for α-defensins. It can be assumed

that at least these 20 peptides are functional molecules
and have the potential to exhibit antimicrobial properties
as already shown for DEFA1 [18,29].
Comparison of the transcripts and genomic sequences
To confirm the obtained transcripts the matching
genomic sequences were determined, as shown in Table 4.
Ten transcripts lacked matching genomic sequences, for
further ten transcripts the first exon cannot be found in
the genomic database and for eight transcripts the second
exon cannot be found. On the other hand, for 14 αdefensin genes apparently present in the genome (Table
2) no appropriate transcript could be verified.

The positions of the transcripts and genomic sequences
(Table 2) which are located in a genomic region of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/631

181,347 bp on ECA27 and another region of 50,069 bp
on an unspecified genomic fragment (Un), with one
exception ([GenBank:AAWR01039498]), are shown in
Fig. 3.

Discussion
In this study we demonstrated the expression of a large
repertoire of different α-defensin transcripts in the small
intestine of a single horse. Consequently, this study is not
to be considered representative for α-defensins in horses
generally and conclusions regarding differences between
races or states of health cannot be drawn. However, the
extensive quantity of at least 38 detected α-defensin transcripts (30 probably functional peptides, DEFA1 to
DEFA29 including DEFA5L, and eight obvious pseudogenes, DEFA30L to DEFA37L) in the intestinal tissue has
rarely been observed before in other organisms and may
indicate an important role of these AMPs in horses. The
functional context of this high number of different transcripts is yet unclear.
In the human Paneth cells two different α-defensins are
synthesised (DEFA 5 and DEFA6; [34]) in addition to the
neutrophil human α-defensin peptides 1-4, also known as
HNP 1-4. In the intestine of the rhesus macaque four different peptides are observed, RED-1 to RED-4 [35]. The
only known organism with a numerically related repertoire of enteric α-defensins is the mouse. At least 23 different peptides are known, named cryptdins and cryptdinrelated sequences [36-38]. They were not only found in
the small intestine but also in the colon, the cecum and
the rectum. The antimicrobial activities of some of these
cryptdins are not known. In mice three different observations highlight possible advantages to express a high
amount of different defensin peptides and indicate their
biological relevance.
First, the peptides can exhibit different specificities against
microorganisms. The cryptdins 1 to 6 were analysed
regarding their antimicrobial activity against different bacteria. The killing potency against the targets, particularly E.
coli and Salmonella typhimurium, showed variabilities [37].
Secondly, the expression level of the cryptdin genes along
the intestinal tract showed large variations. Karlsson et al.
[36] observed a differential gene expression of cryptdins
in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. They concluded
that the varying cryptdin synthesis in different tracts of the
intestine may play an important role in the local regulation of bacterial colonisation in addition to the role in
protection against infection. In having analysed only a
single intestinal location, similar conclusions cannot be
drawn from our data. However, different cloning frequencies of the transcripts found in this study may indicate different mRNA-expression levels at least at this location.

Alignment of 38 different α-defensin amino acid sequences
Alignment of 38 different α-defensin amino acid sequences. Fig. 1 represents the conserved amino acid residues and
distinguishes potentially active peptides from pseudogenes. Conserved amino acid residues in the signal peptides present in all
sequences were highlighted in grey. Conserved cysteine residues were highlighted in red, conserved arginine and glutamic acid
residues, necessary for the intramolecular salt bridge were highlighted in blue, the conserved glycine residue, necessary for
correct folding is highlighted in yellow. The previously known α-defensins DEFA1 and DEFA5L are written in red, defensin-like
peptides (pseudogenes) in blue.

The number of cDNA-fragments coding for a specific peptide varies from one (e.g. DEFA2, DEFA3) to 39 (DEFA25)
in randomly selected clones. Although 38 different αdefensin transcripts were observed in this study, only
seven cDNAs were cloned frequently (DEFA4, 5, 8, 9, 12,
17, 31L, Table 3), whereas in all other cases the number of
obtained clones varies between one and four. Since only a
single set of amplification products was cloned and variants due to error-prone PCR are possible, these data are
less representative. However, the same situation exists in
the mouse, where over 30 α-defensin genes were included
in the latest assemblies and over 20 different cDNAs were
reported, but only six cDNAs have been cloned at high frequencies. It should be taken into account that despite the
apparent diversity, it might be unlikely that more than 78 peptides accumulate to considerable levels in the small
intestine of the horse. Furthermore, it is not known
whether and to what extent the gene expression is inducible.

Thirdly, the gene expression of different mice cryptdins
shows circadian variances [39]. The expression level varies
about 100% between simulated dark and light phases,
primary between cryptdin 1 and 4. An interrelation with
the time of ingestion was assumed. Moreover, the gene
expression level of cryptdin 2 and 5 changes about two or
three orders of magnitude in the first days after birth
whereas the gene expression of cryptdin 1, 3, and 6
increases at lower pace [40]. Probably the differential gene
expression protects the organism during the first adaptation to a new environment.
Alpha-defensin transcripts were formerly only known in
primates, glires and horses. In recent studies the existence
of α-defensin genes was observed in the genomes of the
opossum [19], the elephant and the hedgehog tenrec [20].
According to the Bayesian phylogenetic tree of mammals
[41], the horse is classified into the group of the Laurasiatheria as well as cattle, dog, bat and hedgehog (Fig. 4).

Divergences between the equine intestinal α-defensins
Divergences between the equine intestinal α-defensins. Fig. 2 emphasises the clustering of the peptides. The predicted
signal sequence, the propiece, and the mature peptide were shown separately. DEFA1 was used as a prototype and the amino
acids of the other peptides identify only those residues that differ from the DEFA1 sequence. Identical residues are represented by a vertical line.

Nothing is known about the existence of α-defensins in
bat and hedgehog, and no α-defensin gene was found in
cattle [21] and dog [22]. Whereas α-defensin genes exist in
basal mammals like opossum, elephant and hedgehog
tenrec and in the group of Euarchontoglires, the Equidae are
the only known family expressing α-defensin genes
within the group of Laurasiatheria. In future studies it will
be necessary to clarify why cattle and dog presumably lost
their complete set of α-defensin genes while the horse
increased the gene number extensively. Additionally, the
presence or absence of α-defensins in the closest relatives
of the horse like tapir and rhinoceros (which form
together with the horse the group of Perissodactyla) has to
be analysed. This may lead to new aspects in the development, reorganisation and separation of defensin genes. It
is very unlikely that α-defensins evolved independently
within the Equidae, indicated by the high analogy between
the amino acid sequences of the horse compared with
known α-defensins from primates and glires [18]. It is
assumed that α-defensins evolved from one or two ancestral genes by gene-duplication [22,42]. According to the
observation that platypus being the most basal mammal
that already has been sequenced has four α-defensin

genes [43], one can hypothesise that α-defensins may
have been lost independently in different clades during
the divergence of the phylogenetic tree.
The genomic positions of the transcripts or of single
exons, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3 indicate a false
assembly of EquCab2.0 or unidentified gaps in the
genomic sequence. In some cases only one exon of a transcript was found with an identity of 100% in the genome
whereas an appropriate second exon was missing (DEFA6,
DEFA8, DEFA13). In other cases the same genomic exons
were found in different transcripts (DEFA6 and DEFA7
(Exon 2), DEFA12 and DEFA13 (Exon 2), DEFA12 and
DEFA15 (Exon 1)). The second exons of the DEFA6 and
DEFA7 transcripts were located at the same genomic position whereas only the first exon of DEFA7 was identified
at an appropriate distance of approximately 700 bp
upstream. The first exon of DEFA6 could not be detected
in the genome indicating a gap. In addition to assembly
errors, comprehensive gene reduplication and mutations
of α-defensins and/or alternative splicing might be possible explanations, although the latter was never shown for
α-defensins before. Additionally it is possible that tran-

scripts with missing genomic sequences in the assembly
EquCab2.0 could be also due to copy number variations
(that have e.g. been reported for human α-defensins;
[44]). The animal used in our investigations might have
possessed additional copies compared with the horse
used for establishing the reference genome. However, Fig.
3 shows a typical clustering of the equine α-defensins with
average distances of approximately 10 kb between single
genes. No transcripts were found in the small intestine for
some α-defensin genes annotated in the genome of the

horse or identified by BLAST-searches. It is possible that
these genes are expressed in other tissues and cells, e.g.
bone marrow, or are expressed at very low levels in the
small intestine. In other species that have enteric αdefensins, they are the products of Paneth cells. Their
number varies in different sections of the small intestine
(duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and certain α-defensins
were only found in the ileum [36]. In our studies we most
probably used tissue samples of the jejunum. Consequently, our results do not allow a differentiation between

Figure 3 of α-defensin transcripts and genomic gene sequences based on assembly EquCab2.0
Positions
Positions of α-defensin transcripts and genomic gene sequences based on assembly EquCab2.0. A genomic region
of approximately 183 kb of chromosome 27 (top) and a second region of approximately 50 kb of an unspecified segment (bottom) are shown. Positions of genomic gene sequences are depicted as grey dots, positions of transcripts as triangles. Complete
transcripts are identified by numbers according to the peptides' name. If only single exons are located at a specific position, this
is indicated by the specification of the accordant exon written in parenthesis after the peptides' name. The scale indicates the
kb in the chromosomal region.

the single sections of the small intestine and it is possible
that some transcripts may be additionally found exclusively in the duodenum and/or ileum.
The primary structure of mature α-defensin shows highly
conserved residues, which are indispensable for the structural stability and the full function of the peptides. Among
them are six invariant cysteine residues, necessary for the
typical α-defensin intramolecular disulfide-bond connectivity (Cys1-Cys6, Cys2-Cys4 and Cys3-Cys5), two charged
amino acid residues, Arg5, and Glu13, forming a conserved
salt bridge [32], and Gly17, which constitutes a structural
motif which is essential for correct folding [33]. By analysing the new equine α-defensins considering that these prerequisites must be fulfilled for an active α-defensin, it
became evident that 20 of the 38 peptides (including the
known DEFA1) may be active α-defensins with an antimicrobial potential. DEFA1 to DEFA19 and the DEFA5L
transcript show the six conserved cysteine residues, the
arginine and the glutamic acid residues necessary for the
intramolecular salt bridge, and the highly conserved glycine residue necessary for correct folding. The α-defensins
DEFA20 to DEFA29 exhibit also the cysteine and glycine
residues but they have lost the intramolecular salt bridge
formed by Arg5 and Glu13. Nonetheless, they should be
considered functional because this bridge is not required
for correct pro-α-defensin folding [32]. In contrast, the
peptides DEFA30L to DEFA37L appear to be pseudogenes.
Either some cysteine residues were absent (DEFA30L) or

the transcription stops before completion because of a
premature stop codon visible in the appropriate cDNA
sequence. It is not known whether these molecules may
have adopted new functions or are involved in regulatory
systems. Predictions (e.g. as non-coding RNAs) at this
point would be highly speculative. Interestingly, the premature stop codon of DEFA35L and DEFA36L at position
78 is at the same position that gives rise to θ-defensins in
non-human primates [45].
Typically, α-defensins have an anionic propeptide and a
cationic mature peptide, and the charges are counterbalanced. Taking all intestinal α-defensins of the horse into
account that can produce a mature peptide (DEFA1DEFA29, DEFA5L) they follow the pattern of anionic propiece and cationic mature peptide, but only six of them
are counterbalanced (DEFA8, 12, 13, 15, 21, 27). Several
of the equine α-defensins (DEFA18-20, DEFA30L) have
proline-rich C-terminal extensions resembling certain
proline-rich antimicrobial peptides of cattle, named
cathelicidins (CATHL2 and CATHL3) and others in sheep
and goats [46]. Also DEFA30L exhibits a proline-rich Cterminal region and four cystein residues, typical for
cathelicidins, but the spacing of the cysteins is different.
Other equine α-defensin peptides have a C-terminal glycine residue (DEFA8 to DEFA11). Many cathelicidin precursors also have a C-terminal glycine, which allows the
peptide's C-terminus to be amidated. To our knowledge
no defensins from other species are amidated. The only

other α-defensin containing a C-terminal glycine is
DEFA3 of platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus, acc. Nr.
P0C8A3, Swissprot: http://www.expasy.ch/sprot).
Different infectious diseases may appear if the expression
level or intracellular processing of Paneth cell α-defensins
is abnormal. Wehkamp et al. [26] discovered a reduced
Paneth cell α-defensin synthesis in ileal Crohn's disease
(Morbus Crohn), a chronic disease of the intestine, by
using real-time PCR and immunohistochemical methods.
An enhanced expression of epithelial α-defensin genes in
colonic inflammations was reported by Wehkamp et al.
[47]. Ferguson et al. [27] found that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human Paneth cell α-defensin DEFA5
may confer susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease.
Inflammatory bowel diseases have also been described in

horses, for example the duodenitis/proximal jejunitis syndrome which is characterised by catarrhal enteritis with
mucosal hyperaemia or necrosis or colitis, which causes
intramural oedema and haemorrhagic inflammation of
the large intestine and is often fatal. Bacteria have been
implicated as etiological agents of both diseases [48,49].
The high quantity of equine intestinal α-defensins and the
considerable biological effect of enteric DEFA1 against
microorganisms emphasises the importance of equine
intestinal defensins in protection of the horse against
infections of the intestinal tract.

Conclusions

The large quantity of at least 38 equine α-defensin transcripts in the intestinal tissue has rarely been observed
before in other species. In previous studies we could show

the comprehensive antimicrobial activities of one of these
molecules. The biological context of expressing such a
high number of different α-defensins in the intestine
remains unclear. It is likely that the peptides exhibit different specificities against microorganisms, or different
requirements for antimicrobial peptides along the intestinal tract may lead to spatial expression patterns. Also temporal expression variations may be possible, e.g. a
regulation of α-defensins by circadian rhythms. However,
the high quantity of equine intestinal α-defensins emphasises their importance in the health of the horse's gut. Our
study provides the basis for further gene-expression studies in the intestinal tract of the horse or biological analyses
of further equine α-defensins to understand the importance of defensins in the enteric innate immunity. Moreover, the repertoire of equine α-defensins make the horse
an excellent species to study the biological properties of αdefensins regarding animal health. From other species it is
known that deficiencies or dysregulations of Paneth cell
α-defensins lead to enteric infectious diseases.

References

A comparison of the genomic sequences with the
obtained transcripts indicates a false assembly of the
sequences in the genomic databases of the horse or unidentified gaps. Large gene duplication events and mutation of α-defensins may have occurred in the horse.
