Abstract
Background: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major cause of infant and child mortality
in developing countries. This enteric pathogen causes profuse watery diarrhea by elaborating one
or more enterotoxins that intoxicate eukaryotic cells and ultimately leads to a loss of water to the
intestinal lumen. Virulence is also dependent upon fimbrial adhesins that facilitate colonization of
the small intestine.
Results: The expression of CS1 fimbriae is positively regulated by Rns, a member of the AraC/
XylS superfamily of transcriptional regulators. Based on fimbrial protein homology, CS1 fimbriae
have been categorized as subclass 5b along with CS17, CS19, and PCFO71 fimbriae. In this study
we show that Rns positively regulates the expression of these other subclass 5b members. DNase
I footprinting revealed a Rns binding site adjacent to the -35 hexamer of each fimbrial promoter.
The CS17 and PCFO71 fimbrial promoters carry a second Rns binding site centered at -109.5,
relative to the Rns-dependent transcription start site. This second binding site is centered at -108.5
for the CS19 promoter. Mutagenesis of either site reduced Rns-dependent transcription from each
promoter indicating that the molecules bound to these sites apparently function independently of
one another, with each having an additive effect upon fimbrial promoter activation.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the ETEC virulence regulator Rns is required for the
expression of all known 5b fimbriae. Since Rns is also known to control the expression of additional
ETEC fimbriae, including those within subclasses 5a and 5c, the inactivation or inhibition of Rns
could be an effective strategy to prevent ETEC infections.

Background
In 2005 diarrheal diseases caused an estimated 1.7 million deaths predominately within low to middle income
countries [1]. Approximately 90% of these deaths occur
within the first four years of life. Although the burden of
diarrheal diseases may decrease within some countries if
their economic conditions improve, for citizens of low
income nations diarrheal diseases are projected to remain

among the ten leading causes of death through 2030 [2].
Although diarrheal disease can be caused by any one of
several bacterial or viral pathogens, enterotoxigenic
Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the most frequent causes
of diarrhea in developing nations [3-5]. This pathogen
causes profuse watery diarrhea by elaborating one or more
enterotoxins. Pathogenicity is also dependent upon the
expression of fimbriae, which function as adherence fac-

tors, allowing the pathogen to colonize the small intestine. To date, over twenty distinct fimbriae have been
identified although some of these are more common in
affected areas than others [6]. Nevertheless, the diversity
of ETEC fimbriae is a significant challenge for the development of vaccines based on fimbrial antigens [7].
Some of the more frequently encountered fimbriae, such
as coli surface antigen 1 (CS1), have been characterized in
considerable detail. CS1 fimbria are composed of four
proteins. These proteins have amino-terminal signal peptides that facilitate their transport to the periplasm via the
Sec-dependent general secretory pathway. CooC [GenBank:Q47114] is an outer membrane usher protein that
serves as an assembly site and eventually, the base of an
assembled CS1 fimbria [8]. In terms of stoichiometry,
CooD [GenBank:Q47115] is a minor component localized to the tip of CS1 fimbria while CooA [GenBank:Q6JAY9] polymerizes beneath CooD to form most
of the fimbrial structure [9,10]. Although CooB [GenBank:Q6JAZ0] is not found in the final fimbrial structure,
it is essential for assembly because it is a chaperone for
CooA and CooD, protecting them from proteolysis in the
periplasm [11]. CS1 and related fimbriae have been categorized as class 5 fimbriae [12], the alternate chaperone/
usher family [13], or more recently α-fimbriae [14]. The
latter classification system is based on phylogenetic relationships of fimbrial usher proteins and has the potential
to provide a unified and comprehensible system for the
classification of fimbriae [14]. Although this new classification system may eventually gain widespread adoption,
in the interim we will retain the class 5 nomenclature.
The CS1 operon, cooBACD, is transcribed as a polycistronic message from a single promoter (CS1p). This
operon is carried by the virulence plasmid pCoo [GenBank:CR942285] of ETEC strain C921b-1 or pETEC_73
[GenBank:CP000797] of E24377a. The CS1 promoter is
positively regulated by Rns [GenBank:P16114], a member
of the AraC/XylS superfamily of regulators [15,16]. In
strains C921b-1 and E24377a, Rns is encoded on a virulence plasmid separate from the plasmid carrying the CS1
operon. Rns has two binding sites upstream of cooB, one
adjacent to the -35 hexamer of CS1p and a more distal
upstream site [17]. Mutagenesis of either binding site
reduces Rns-dependent expression from CS1p in vivo.
The CS1 fimbriae are more closely related, by phylogenetic analysis, to CS17 [GenBank:AY515609, GenBank:AY216491], CS19 [GenBank:AY288101], and
putative colonization factor O71 (PCFO71) [GenBank:AY513487] fimbriae than other class 5 fimbriae
[14,18]. To reflect their relatedness, this group has been
designated as subclass 5b [18]. In addition to their similarity based upon protein homology, we show in this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/180

study that subclass 5b fimbriae are also similarly regulated
by Rns.

Results
Transcriptional regulation of subclass 5b fimbrial
promoters
Rns is known to regulate one member, CS1, of fimbrial
subclass 5b. In addition, the expression of the related
CS19 fimbrial proteins is enhanced when CS19+ strains
are transformed with a plasmid expressing CfaD [GenBank:P25393] which is 97% identical to Rns [18,19].
However, it is not known if the enhancement of CS19
expression results from positive regulation of the fimbrial
promoter or an indirect effect involving non-fimbrial
genes within the Rns/CfaD regulon [20,21]. Currently,
there is no evidence to suggest that the other subclass 5b
members, CS17 and PCFO71, are regulated by Rns. However, the available data does not exclude this possibility.
To determine if other subclass 5b fimbria are regulated by
Rns, we cloned the promoters of CS17, CS19, and
PCFO71 into a promoterless Lac reporter plasmid that
was then integrated into the chromosomal attBHK022 site
of K-12 strain MC4100 by site specific recombination.
Quantitative enzymatic assays revealed that the reporter
strains expressed 8 to 10 times more β-galactosidase when
they were transformed with a Rns expression plasmid,
pGPMRns, than when they were transformed with the
rns::kan negative control plasmid pGPMRns<Tn>2 (Table
1). Thus, when these results are combined with previous
analyses of the CS1 fimbrial promoter [15], they reveal
that all known subclass 5b fimbrial promoters are activated by Rns.
Rns-dependent transcription start site
The CS17, CS19, and PCFO71 promoters have not been
previously characterized; therefore, the transcription start
site of each promoter was mapped by primer extension.
We found that the Rns-dependent transcription start site
is 16 nucleotides upstream of csbB (CS17), 17 nucleotides
upstream of csdB (CS19), and 20 nucleotides upstream of
cosB (PCFO71) (Figure 1). We did not observe primer
extension products in the absence of Rns although our βTable 1: Activation of fimbrial promoters by Rns

galactosidase assays indicated that each promoter has at
least a low level of Rns-independent activity (Table 1).
This difference is most likely a consequence of the relatively long half-life of β-galactosidase compared to the
short half-life of most mRNA's in E. coli. Thus, β-galactosidase assays reflect the accumulative activity of the pro-

Rns binding site position and function
In vitro DNase I footprinting was used to determine Rns
binding site locations at the CS17, CS19, and PCFO71
promoters. Like other AraC/XylS family members that
have been characterized, Rns is too insoluble for the characterization of protein-DNA complexes in vitro. However,
it has been previously shown that the fusion of maltose
binding protein (MBP) to the amino-terminus of Rns substantially increases its solubility without affecting its activity in vivo [17]. With purified soluble fusion protein we
found that Rns binds to a site adjacent to each promoter's
-35 hexamer, which were predicted based on primer
extension results and sequence analyses (Figure 2). Each
promoter also carries a second binding site centered, relative to the Rns-dependent transcription start site, at -109.5
for CS17p and PCF071p or -108.5 for CS19p. DNase I
footprints of MBP-Rns typically cover 33 to 36 nucleotides. Due to steric occlusion, these footprints overestimate the actual site of protein-nucleotide contacts [17].
However, each footprint encompasses a central core of 12
nucleotides with at least 67% identity to the Rns binding
site consensus sequence TATTTTTTTATC [21]. Since Rns
binding sites are not symmetrical, the conserved
sequences are either on the coding or noncoding strand of
each promoter (Figure 2).

Since DNase I footprinting identified two Rns binding
sites at each fimbrial promoter, each site was subjected to
oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis to determine its
function with regards to promoter activation. Prior to in
vivo analyses, we used gel mobility assays to determine if
the point mutations reduced or abolished Rns binding in
vitro. We found that the ability of MBP-Rns to alter the

mobility of DNA fragments carrying mutagenized sites
was substantially reduced compared to wild-type binding
sites (Figure 3). This was expected because three or four
nucleotides within the conserved core of each site were
changed. In addition to large nonspecific protein-DNA
complexes trapped in the wells of most gels at high concentrations of MBP-Rns, we also observed a low mobility
complex with the wild-type csbB2o binding site. This suggests the presence of an additional low affinity binding
site that was not observed by DNase I footprinting. This
site is likely a pseudo binding site and is probably not relevant in vivo because high concentrations of protein were
required
for
binding.
After gel mobility assays, we evaluated the function of
each wild-type and mutagenized binding site in vivo by βgalactosidase assays. Overall levels of enzymatic activity
were higher in stationary phase (Figure 4) than late log
phase (Table 1) because as explained above, β-galactosidase is a stable enzyme that accumulates over time. For
each promoter, we observed that mutations within either
binding site reduced Rns-dependent expression of the
enzyme (Figure 4). However, the most dramatic reductions were observed when both binding sites were simultaneously mutagenized. Taken together, these results
demonstrate that the CS17, CS19, and PCFO71 fimbrial
promoters each carry two functional binding sites that are
required for full Rns-dependent activation.

Discussion
In this study we have shown that CS17, CS19, and
PCFO71 fimbriae are positively regulated by Rns.
Although the three promoters expressed different absolute
levels of β-galactosidase, the relative activation of each
was similar (Table 1). Each fimbrial promoter contains a
Rns binding site adjacent to its predicted -35 hexamer and
a second binding site centered at -109.5 or -108.5. Point
mutations within these binding sites demonstrated that
both sites are essential for full Rns-dependent activation
of each fimbrial promoter. Moreover, the molecules
bound to these sites apparently function independently of
one another, with each having an additive rather than synergistic effect upon fimbrial promoter activation. This suggests that Rns's activation of fimbrial promoters is
mechanistically distinct from its positive autoregulation
because a previous study has shown that positive autoregulation requires synergy between two binding sites [22].
In terms of Rns binding site positions and number; the
CS17, CS19, and PCFO71 promoters are similar to the
previously described CS1 fimbrial promoter [17]. The
four fimbrial promoters also conserve the orientation of
each site with the closest match to the consensus binding
sequence on the coding strand for promoter proximal
sites and the noncoding strand for promoter distal sites. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/180

each case, the center-to-center distance between each pair
of binding sites is exactly 70 base pairs. Assuming these
sequences are entirely B-form DNA in solution with 10.5
base pairs per helical turn, this distance of 6.7 helical turns
would place the activator at the promoter-distal site on
the opposite face of the DNA helix relative to the activator
bound to the promoter-proximal site. Since we have
shown that the promoter distal sites are required for full
activation of each promoter, these observations suggest
that Rns must reach around the DNA helix when bound at
the distal sites in order to interact with RNA polymerase.
This reaching may be accomplished by a flexible linker,
which we have recently identified (Bodero and Munson,
unpublished data) that joins the amino-terminal domain
of Rns to its carboxy-terminal DNA binding domain. We
have also recently identified residues near the amino-terminus of Rns that are involved in promoter activation
[23].
Based on homology between fimbrial proteins; CS1,
CS17, CS19, and PCFO71 have been classified as subclass
5b adhesive fimbriae. Two other fimbrial subclasses have
been described. Subclass 5a contains CFA/I, CS4, and
CS14 fimbriae, whereas subclass 5c contains only CS2
fimbriae. Although only the CFA/I promoter has been
characterized in detail [21,23], all ETEC 5a and 5c fimbriae are regulated by Rns, or its functional homolog CfaD
[15,24-26]. Thus, with the inclusion of this study, it is
now apparent that all known class 5 fimbriae are regulated by Rns/CfaD in ETEC.
Class 5 fimbriae are not the only fimbriae regulated by
Rns. Rns also is required for the expression of class 2 CS3
fimbriae which belong to the classical, as opposed to the
alternate, chaperone-usher pathway group [27]. CS20
fimbriae are probably also regulated by Rns/CfaD because
a fimbrial subunit was hyper-expressed when cfaD was
provided in trans [28]. This indicates that nearly half of all
known ETEC fimbriae are positively regulated by Rns/
CfaD. This may actually be an underestimate because we
cannot determine if the expression of several fimbriae is
Rns-dependent or Rns-independent from the available literature. Nevertheless, the inactivation of Rns would
render a significant number of ETEC strains avirulent
because Rns controls the expression of some of the most
frequently identified fimbriae [6]. In addition, we have
shown in this study that Rns activates the expression of
CS17, CS19, and PCFO71 fimbriae which are not
included in any of the ETEC vaccines currently under
development [7,29].
Given the challenges and uncertainty facing ETEC vaccines containing fimbrial antigens [7], it would be prudent to consider other approaches to prevent ETEC
infections. A potentially broadly effective approach would

be to inactivate Rns since this would eliminate the expression of almost 50% of all known ETEC adhesive fimbriae.
Since Rns is a cytoplasmic protein, it is obviously not a
suitable antigen for vaccine development. However, it
may be possible to identify small molecules that inhibit
the activity of Rns by high-throughput screening of chemical libraries. A similar strategy has identified small molecular inhibitors of a Vibrio cholerae virulence regulator [30].
If inhibitors of Rns can be identified, they could serve as
lead compounds for the development of novel drugs that
prevent or ameliorate most ETEC infections.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates that Rns is required for the
expression of all known subclass 5b fimbriae of ETEC.
Other studies have shown that Rns is required for the
expression of more distally related fimbriae including, but
not limited to, those within subclasses 5a and 5c. Taken
together, these studies suggest that the inactivation or
inhibition of Rns could be an effective strategy to prevent
ETEC infections.

Methods
Plasmids and strains

primers SN419-Bam and SN552-Eco. Primer sequences
are listed in Table 3. The CS19 promoter was amplified
from strain WS0115A with primers SN421-Bam and
SN552-Eco. The PCFO71 promoter was amplified from
strain WS2173A with primers SN530-Bam and SN553Eco. The 0.7 kb PCR products were digested with BamHI
and EcoRI, then ligated into the same sites of pHKLac1 to
construct pCS17Lac2, pCS19Lac2, and pCFO71Lac2.
Plasmid pHKLac1 carries lacZYA flanked by transcriptional terminators, aadA, attPHK022 and the pir-dependent
γ origin of replication from R6K [20]. It is a derivative of
pAH144 (GenBank:AY048731) with the addition of a 5.5
kb BamHI-MfeI fragment carrying lacZYA from pRS550
[31,32].

For the purpose of mutagenesis, each reporter plasmid
was digested with PvuII then ligated to excise 5 kb of lacZYA. The resulting plasmids (pCS17c, pCS19c, and
pCFO71c) were then subjected to oligonucleotide

Numbering of promoter sequences is relative to their Rns–dependent transcription start sites.

directed mutagenesis to create point mutations in Rns
binding sites. The point mutations were designed so that
they also generate unique restriction sites. Plasmid
pCS17c was subjected to inverse PCR with primers
SN562-AgeI and SN563-AgeI or SN568-KpnI and SN569KpnI. Plasmid pCS19c was subjected to inverse PCR with
primers SN572-SpeI and SN573-SpeI or SN574-KpnI and
SN575-KpnI. Plasmid pCFO71c was subjected to inverse
PCR with primers SN560-AgeI and SN561-AgeI or SN570KpnI and SN571-KpnI. The 3.6 kb PCR products were
then digested with AgeI, KpnI, or SpeI then ligated to yield
pCS17cAge, pCS17cKpn, pCS19cSpe, pCS19cKpn,
pCFO71cAge, and pCFO71cKpn. The mutagenized promoter fragments were then cloned into pHKLac1 as 0.7 kb
BamHI-EcoRI fragments. Plasmids containing double
mutations, where both Rns-binding sites are mutagenized, were generated by subjecting plasmids
pCS17Lac3, pCS19Lac4, and pCFO71Lac3 to an inverse
PCR reaction with primers SN568-KpnI and SN569-KpnI,
SN574-KpnI and SN575-KpnI, and SN570-KpnI and
SN571-KpnI, respectively. The PCR products were then
digested with KpnI and recircularized.
Plasmid pCS17Lac3 carries CS17p with the unique AgeI
restriction site in the Rns promoter proximal binding site
csbB1o. pCS17Lac4 carries CS17p with the unique KpnI
site in the Rns promoter distal binding site csbB2o.
pCS17Lac5 carries both unique restriction sites. Plasmids
pCS19Lac3 and pCS19Lac4 carry CS19p with a unique
KpnI site in the promoter distal Rns binding site csdB2o or
a SpeI site in the promoter proximal binding site csdB1o,
respectively. pCS19Lac5 carries both mutations. Plasmids
pCFO71Lac3 and pCFO71Lac4 carry CFO71p with a
unique AgeI site in the promoter proximal Rns binding

site cosB1o or a KpnI site in the promoter distal binding
site cosB2o, respectively. pCFO71Lac5 carries both mutations. Reporter plasmids were integrated into the chromosomal attBHK022 site of MC4100 by IntHK022 dependent,
site-specific recombination [31]. Strains with single plasmid integrants were identified by colony PCR [31] and
used for enzymatic assays.
Plasmid pRARE2 (EMD Biosciences) provides seven rare
tRNAs to supplement the rare codon usage of rns. Plasmid
pMBPRns1 expresses MBP-Rns from an isopropyl-β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible tac promoter
[20]. Plasmid pGPMRns is a derivative of pNEB193 (New
England Biolabs) and expresses Rns from lacp [20]. Plasmid pGPMRns<Tn>2 carries rns::kan and was produced by
transposon mutagenesis of pGPMRns.
Enzymatic assays
Reporter strains were transformed with pGPMRns (rns+
bla) or pGPMRns<Tn>2 (rns::kan bla) and grown aerobically at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 100 μg/
ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested, lysed and assayed for
β-galactosidase activity as previously described [33]. Stationary phase cells were harvested from overnight cultures
with an optical absorbance between 0.7 and 0.8 at 580
nm. Late log phase cells were harvested 3 to 4 hours after
inoculation when the optical absorbance of the culture
reached 0.4 to 0.6 at 580 nm.
Purification of MBP-Rns
Strain KS1000/pRare2/pMBPRns1 was grown aerobically
at 37°C in LB medium containing 0.2% wt/vol glucose,
30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin.
During mid-log phase the incubation temperature was

lowered to 30°C then IPTG was added to a final concentration of 300 μM to induce the expression of MBP-Rns.
After several hours of induction, cells were harvested at
4°C and concentrated ≥ 100 fold in ice-cold lysis buffer
(10 mM TrisCl [pH 7.6], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5
mM CaCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml DNase
I). A French press was used to mechanically lyse the cells.
The lysate was clarified by high-speed centrifugation to
pellet insoluble material. The supernatant was passed
through an amylose column that was then washed with
several column volumes of buffer A (10 mM TrisCl [pH
7.6], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 15% vol/vol glycerol,
and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The fusion protein was

DNase I footprinting
MBP-Rns was equilibrated with 32P-end-labeled promoter
DNA at 37°C in 10 mM TrisCl [pH 7.6], 50 mM KCl, 1
mM DTT, 0.4 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 2 ng/μl polydIdC, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After equilibration,
DNase I was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl
for 1 min. at 37°C. The enzymatic reaction was quenched
by addition of 10 volumes of 570 mM NH4OAc, 50 μg/ml
tRNA, 80% vol/vol ethanol. The solution was vortexed
then placed on dry ice to precipitate DNA. The DNA was
pelleted, washed with 70% vol/vol ethanol, dried, then
resuspended in 4 μl 80% vol/vol formamide, 50 mM TrisBorate [pH 8.3], 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% wt/vol xylene cyanol
and bromophenol blue. The samples were heat denatured
and separated on sequencing gels. Dried gels were visualized by exposure to phosphorimager plates. The MaxamGilbert method was used to generate sequence ladders
[35].
Gel mobility assays
MBP-Rns was equilibrated with 32P-labeled CS17, CS19,
or PCFO71 promoter fragments in 10 mM TrisCl (pH
7.6), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2 ng/ul poly (dI-dC), 0.1
mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6% (vol/vol) glycerol
at 37°C for 20 minutes. After equilibration, the reactions
were loaded onto non-denaturing 5% acrylamide gels
with TAE (40 mM Tris-acetate, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.5]) as
the gel and running buffer. The gels were run at 150 volts
for 2 hours, dried, and visualized by exposure to phosphorimager plates.
Transcription start site mapping
Cells were harvested from cultures after they reached an
optical absorbance of 1.0 at 595 nm. Total RNA was isolated from reporter strains GPM1133 (CS17p::lacZYA),
GPM1134
(CS19p::lacZYA),
and
GPM1131
(PCFO71p::lacZYA) transformed with pGPMRns (rns+
bla) or pGPMRns<Tn>2 (rns::kan bla) as previously
described [20]. Subsequently, 2.4 picomoles of a 32P-endlabeled oligonucleotide (SN420-Eco for CS17p and
CS19p; SN531-Eco for PCFO71p) was combined with 54–
169 μg of total RNA and 0.8 mM dNTPs. The solution was
heated to 65°C for 5 minutes then cooled on ice for 2
minutes to anneal the primer, which was then extended
with SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase according to
the supplier's protocol (Invitrogen). Aliquots were sepa-
