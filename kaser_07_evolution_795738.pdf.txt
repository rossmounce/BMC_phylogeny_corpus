Abstract
Background: Comparative genomics has greatly improved our understanding of the evolution of
pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here we have used data from a
genome microarray analysis to explore insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphism among a diverse
strain collection of Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of the devastating skin disease, Buruli
ulcer. Detailed analysis of large sequence polymorphisms in twelve regions of difference (RDs),
comprising irreversible genetic markers, enabled us to refine the phylogenetic succession within M.
ulcerans, to define features of a hypothetical M. ulcerans most recent common ancestor and to
confirm its origin from Mycobacterium marinum.
Results: M. ulcerans has evolved into five InDel haplotypes that separate into two distinct lineages:
(i) the "classical" lineage including the most pathogenic genotypes – those that come from Africa,
Australia and South East Asia; and (ii) an "ancestral" M. ulcerans lineage comprising strains from Asia
(China/Japan), South America and Mexico. The ancestral lineage is genetically closer to the
progenitor M. marinum in both RD composition and DNA sequence identity, whereas the classical
lineage has undergone major genomic rearrangements.
Conclusion: Results of the InDel analysis are in complete accord with recent multi-locus sequence
analysis and indicate that M. ulcerans has passed through at least two major evolutionary
bottlenecks since divergence from M. marinum. The classical lineage shows more pronounced
reductive evolution than the ancestral lineage, suggesting that there may be differences in the
ecology between the two lineages. These findings improve the understanding of the adaptive
evolution and virulence of M. ulcerans and pathogenic mycobacteria in general and will facilitate the
development of new tools for improved diagnostics and molecular epidemiology.

Background
M. ulcerans is the causative agent of the chronic necrotising human skin disease Buruli ulcer. After tuberculosis

and leprosy, Buruli ulcer is the third most common mycobacterial disease, and Western Africa is the world region
most affected. The disease usually begins as a painless

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:177

nodule and, if left untreated, leads to massive tissue
destruction. More than 50% of those affected by Buruli
ulcer are children under 15 years of age. The disease often
occurs in focalised areas close to stagnant or slow-moving
waters. The mode of transmission is thought to be from
environment to human but is still very poorly understood, partly because standard molecular typing methods
lack the resolution required for detailed micro-epidemiological analyses.
Whole genome sequence comparisons of an M. ulcerans
isolate from Ghana (Agy99) with the M. marinum M strain
have shown that the former has evolved from the latter by
a process of lateral gene transfer and reductive evolution
[1,2]. Characteristic for M. ulcerans and probably a key
driver of its speciation is the acquisition of the virulence
plasmid, pMUM001, required for production of the tissue
damaging polyketide, mycolactone [3,4]. Another striking
feature of the M. ulcerans Agy99 genome was the many
examples of DNA deletions when compared with the M.
marinum M strain which were referred to as MURDs (M.
ulcerans regions of difference, [5]) and account for the loss
of 1000 kb of DNA between M. marinum and M. ulcerans.
For other mycobacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, M. leprae, and M. avium, inter- and intra-species comparative genomics has contributed considerably
to our understanding of their evolution, virulence and
phylogeographical dispersal [6-16]. Especially, specific
deletions in regions of difference (RDs) proved to be
excellent epidemiological and evolutionary markers since
they did not occur independently in different strains but
rather result from events in a common progenitor [8].
Thus, to gain further insight into M. ulcerans and explore
the DNA deletion diversity among M. ulcerans strains we
recently developed a plasmid-based DNA microarray that
facilitated the detection of large sequence polymorphisms
among M. ulcerans isolates of world-wide origin [17].
These initial microarray studies revealed twelve deletions
(in twelve regions of difference, designated RD1 to RD12)
between 2 and 53 kb in size among the 30 M. ulcerans isolates tested, representing hitherto unknown large
sequence polymorphisms and uncovering a major source
of strain diversity in M. ulcerans, a species where nucleotide diversity is less than 0.6% even between the most
distantly related strains [2]. This insertional-deletional
(InDel) genomic variation showed that genome reduction
is ongoing within M. ulcerans which provides evidence for
an adaptive change from an environmental to a possibly
new host-adapted organism.
In this current study, we have undertaken a detailed characterization of these twelve RDs comprising over 410 kb
based on InDel events that allowed for a phylogenetic resolution, of a representative collection of 35 M. ulcerans

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/177

patient isolates of world-wide origin for which genotyping
was very limited. Most importantly, we show the existence
of two distinct phylogenetic lineages with diverse evolutionary history in M. ulcerans which has implications for
both the understanding of mycobacterial adaptation and
further research on this emerging human pathogen.

Results
Identification and localisation of genomic regions of
difference (RDs) in M. ulcerans
In a previous study we identified twelve RDs among 30 M.
ulcerans strains of diverse geographic origin using a DNA
microarray based on the Ghanaian reference strain Agy99
[17]. For the current investigation, we mapped each RD
on the recently completed Agy99 genome (Fig. 1). Five of
the RDs were located on the genome between 3.0 and 3.6
Mbp. The other seven identified RDs were distributed
elsewhere on the chromosome. As found upon in depth
analysis (see below), the twelve RDs altogether spanned
some 410 kb, representing more than 7% of the M. ulcerans Agy99 genome (Fig. 1). Size analysis of the deletions
clustered the 30 analysed M. ulcerans strains of diverse
geographic origin into five haplotypes (where haplotype
is defined as a set of DNA polymorphisms inherited as a
unit). The geography of the haplotypes and the origins of
the M. ulcerans strains under investigation are shown in a
distribution map (Fig. 2).

shown in the world map, with each dot representing one patient isolate as defined in materials and methods. The five InDel
haplotypes are encircled.

Complete analysis of large sequence polymorphisms in M.
ulcerans RDs confirms five haplotypes
To further resolve the above microarray based phylogenetic differentiation we analysed each of the twelve RDs in
greater detail by focussing on two independent patient
isolates for each of the five haplotypes. Since the method
used for detection of deletional diversity [17] would bias
the results towards phylogenetically informative events
leading away from the reference strain Agy99, we monitored the genome composition of the RDs irrespective of
the information gained by the microarray approach and
referred to the M. marinum M strain sequence. Using PCR,
cloning and primer walking we determined deletion sizes
and their breakpoints, and identified sequence insertions,
substitutions, dislocations, inversions and rearrangements. For crucial loci, confirmatory tests were made for
the whole and extended collection of 35 M. ulcerans

strains. Consistently throughout our analysis, members of
a given subgroup yielded identical results (see below) in
all RDs analysed and confirmed the occurrence of five
haplotypes. Thus, strain Japan 8756 was identical to
China 98912 as was Surinam 842 to French Guyana 7922
and the two Mexican isolates 5114 and 5143 to each
other, defining haplotypes referred to as the Asian, the
South American and the Mexican, respectively. The Asian
haplotype excludes strains of South East Asian origin.
Comparative analysis of the largest subgroup of strains,
comprising the isolates originating from Africa, Australia,
Papua New Guinea and Malaysia, revealed no large
sequence polymorphisms within the subgroup and represented the African/Australian haplotype. Two of the Australian strains, 5142 and 5147, are almost identical to the
African/Australian haplotype but have an additional deletion and thus represent a separate haplotype, Australia

5142/47. Since identical results were obtained for all
independent isolates per haplotype we conclude that the
large sequence polymorphisms identified were neither
experimental artefacts nor events that had occurred during
in vitro culturing over time. In contrast, these concordant
InDels reflect real geographically associated features with
the genome rearrangements resulting from irreversible
genetic events that had occurred in the common progenitor strains of each haplotype. Thus, we consider the
description of InDels as useful phylogenetic markers since
M. ulcerans strains appeared to be largely clonal [18-21]
and recombination is unlikely to occur extensively in this
species [22].
Detailed RD sequence comparison reveals the existence of
two major M. ulcerans lineages
Genome sequence polymorphism data were compared
with the available reference complete genome sequences
of M. ulcerans Agy99 (a member of the African/Australian
haplotype) and the M. marinum strain M. Properties of the
five M. ulcerans haplotypes are presented in Table 1 in
comparison to the M. marinum M sequence. In the
genomes of the South American, Mexican and Asian haplotypes deletions in the absences of substituting DNA
such as an insertion sequence element (ISE) are more frequent and the deletions are larger than in the African/Australian cluster (Table 1, column 1). In contrast, insertions
of ISEs (IS2404, IS2606, and IS2404/IS2606 tandems,
Table 1, column 2) were frequently found in the African/
Australian haplotypes, but not in the South American,
Mexican and Asian haplotypes. Moreover, in the African/
Australian cluster a multitude of genomic rearrangements
was observed, including i) large DNA fragment dislocation from remote sequence positions in the M. marinum
genome into the investigated RDs (Table 1, column 4); ii)
DNA fragment inversions (Table 1, column 5); and iii)
DNA fragment rearrangements involving sequences
derived from unlinked M. marinum loci that are rearranged and then linked to each other by IS2404 elements
(Table 1, column 6). Such a rearrangement was not found
in any of the twelve RDs for the South American, Mexican
and Asian haplotypes. These M. ulcerans haplotypes thus
shared a genetic backbone corresponding to the M. marinum strain M sequence at loci where the African/Australian haplotype (including the M. ulcerans genome
reference strain Agy99) showed extensive genome rearrangements. DNA sequences present in the South American, Mexican and Asian haplotypes and missing in the
African/Australian haplotypes showed an overall
sequence identity of 98% with the corresponding
sequences in the M. marinum strain M.

The twelve RDs thus distinguish two major M. ulcerans lineages: one branch, comprising the isolates from Africa,
Australia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, we have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/177

called the classical lineage, since it includes the sequenced
African strain, Agy99, and most of the existing M. ulcerans
clinical isolates. The second lineage comprises the strains
of Asian, South American and Mexican origin. We designated it the ancestral lineage, since its members are genetically closer to the progenitor M. marinum in sequence
composition, order and orientation. This is illustrated for
selected RDs in Fig. 3 where the sequence of M. marinum
is aligned to each one representative haplotype of the M.
ulcerans ancestral lineage and to M. ulcerans Agy99, representing the classical lineage. The alignments demonstrate
the high conformity between M. marinum and members
of the ancestral M. ulcerans lineage with only minor
changes including single nucleotide polymorphisms,
small deletions or sequence variations over short
stretches. In contrast, major genome rearrangements mark
significant genomic differences between the ancestral and
the classical lineage (Fig. 3).
Irreversible sequence polymorphisms disclose phylogenetic
relationships and an evolutionary scenario for M. ulcerans
The two deletions RD12A (the 3.9 kb deletion in RD12)
and RD3A (the 0.8 kb deletion in RD3; Table 1) were
shared by all M. ulcerans strains analysed. These shared
features define the hypothetical M. ulcerans most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) from which the two major lineages descended. Acquisition of the virulence plasmid,
pMUM001, is also a characteristic of the MRCA. In Fig. 4,
haplotype specific configurations of insertional-deletional polymorphisms are shown for five selected RDs.
The deletional patterns within a given RD differ across the
haplotypes and the deletions within one RD were given
letter extensions (A-D, Fig. 4 and Table 1). Sequence position details of these deletions are summarized in Table 2.
The configurations within several loci provide a nonambiguous picture of the phylogenetic relationship
between the five M. ulcerans haplotypes. In Fig. 4, comparative analysis of RD12 shows that the Asian, South American and African haplotypes share the 3.9 kb deletion, a
feature of the M. ulcerans MRCA. Apart from this, none of
the three subgroups can have descended from each other,
since each of them has either maintained DNA stretches of
the M. marinum genetic backbone that are deleted in the
other genotypes (RD12B for the South American and
RD12C for the Asian haplotype) or has accumulated
insertions that are missing in the others (ISEs IS2404 and
IS2606 in RD12 for Agy99, Fig. 4). Sequence comparison
in RD8 illustrates that neither the Asian nor the South
American strains can have derived from the African strain
Agy99 due to the absence of both the African-Australian
specific deletion RD11A and IS2404 insertion (Fig. 4). In
contrast, alignments in RD9 show that Agy99 cannot have
one of the ancestral haplotypes as an ancestor since it has
maintained stretches that were deleted in either of them.
Similar conclusions can be drawn from sequence compar-

Linear genomic comparison of sections within RDs. Comparisons are made with three sequences each using ACT (the
Artemis Comparison Tool software release 5) over at least 30 kb: M. marinum M on top, M. ulcerans Agy99 at the bottom, and
M. ulcerans of either haplotype, the Asian (RD2 and RD5) or the South American (RD9 and RD10) in the middle. Regions of
sequence conformity are shown in parallel light grey plains, inverted DNA segments are depicted in dark grey and inverted surfaces, and white areas represent non-homologous regions like deletions and insertions. Some sequence displacements are visualized as grey areas displaying across the panels. Cut-off value for inclusion of sequence identity was 100 bp. The principal
genetic backbone of the Asian and South American haplotypes (both members of the ancestral lineage) is identical for each
alignment shown, but – as a matter of how the RDs were found – the particular excluded haplotypes reveal deletions in the
respective RDs. Although showing the same genetic backbone as M. marinum in the marginal parts, the Mexican strains disclose
large deletions over their respective RDs and are therefore not included in this computational analysis. The sequence regions
were retrieved by scanning the contigs by PCR, and by cloning and sequencing of critical segments.

Positions refer to the M. marinum M genome sequence [34] following Stinear et al., 2007 [5]. Discrepancies between position numbers and deletion
sizes are due to nucleotide variations between the M. marinum and M. ulcerans genomes in these regions

ison in RD3 which also shows the derivation of the two
strains Australia 5142 and 5147 from the African/Australian cluster (Fig. 4). Interestingly, in RD3 both the South
American and the Australian haplotype of strains 5142
and 5147 carry a deletion at the same position, but with
different sizes (3785 bp of RD3B versus 3452 bp of
RD3C) and different breakpoints at each of their flanking
sequences. Furthermore, an IS2404 element has been
inserted in the South American haplotype, while no substituting insertion is found in the Australian strains indicating that the two deletions have evolved by different
mechanisms (Fig. 4). Partly overlapping deletions that
also appear to have arisen independently have also been
found in a number of other RDs (e.g. RD9 and 12) suggesting that some loci are hot spots for genomic changes.
Other typing methods applied earlier to M. ulcerans isolates (IS2404-Mtb2 PCR, MIRU-VNTR and VNTR) resulted
in dendrograms that equally position strains from Mexico, South America and (in two cases) also from Asia,
members of the ancestral lineage, genetically closer to M.
marinum than to the cluster of African, Australian and
South East Asian isolates, members of our classical lineage
[23-25]. Two recent studies based on MLST also placed the
branching point of a Surinam, Mexican and a Chinese isolate at the junction between a cluster of each one African,
Australian and South East Asian M. ulcerans strain and various M. marinum types [1,2]. Here, albeit with yet low geographical resolution, an unequivocal evolutionary
scenario can be proposed for M. ulcerans haplotypes, in
which all branching points are well defined by irreversible
and non-ambiguous genetic markers (Fig. 5). The M.
ulcerans MRCA (and with it all recent M. ulcerans isolates)
is distinguished from M. marinum strain M by the common deletions RD3A and RD12A. The classical lineage is
separated from members of the ancestral lineage by
numerous large sequence polymorphisms (Table 1)
including at least seven genomic rearrangements in five

RDs (RD2, 5, 6, 8, 10), blank insertions of ISEs in ten RDs
(all twelve except RD4 and 9) and deletions in seven RDs
(RD1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 12; Table 1). Within the classical lineage, the Australian strains 5142 and 5147 separate by
RD3C (Fig. 4 and 5) from all other members of this lineage. The three haplotypes belonging to the ancestral lineage are separated from each other by deletions of
considerable size such as the partially overlapping but
independent deletions in RD12 (RD12C of 42 kb and
RD12B of 27.5 kb) and in RD9 (RD9A of > 24 kb and
RD9B of 30.5 kb) in the Asian and South American haplotypes, respectively (Fig. 4 and 5). Interestingly, a shared
InDel event in RD11 (RD11A of 4565 bp substituted by
an IS2404 element, Fig. 4 and 5) suggests a closer relationship between the Mexican and Asian than between the
Mexican and South American haplotypes.

Discussion
Large genome sequence polymorphisms have been used
to unravel inter-species relatedness and evolutionary
order within the M. tuberculosis complex as well as for
other mycobacterial species [8,22,26]. Our microarray
based comparative genomic hybridization analysis of M.
ulcerans isolates demonstrates that InDel diversity is also
common in this mycobacterial species [17]. A detailed
analysis of the twelve identified RDs presented here
defined properties of a hypothetical M. ulcerans MRCA,
and identified two major distinct lineages among M. ulcerans strains, which could all be assigned to either a classical
or an ancestral lineage. Members of the ancestral lineage
have a genomic backbone highly homologous to M. marinum and are therefore positioned closer to the M. ulcerans
MRCA. Within the Asian, South American and Mexican
haplotypes, a set of large, discrete and independent deletions could be identified upon comparison with the M.
marinum strain M genome, while in members of the ancestral lineage no major genome rearrangements were found
within the 410 kb of the investigated RDs (with one

Evolutionary scenario for M. ulcerans, basically distinguishing two major lineages, according to the RDs analyzed in this study. All strains with a strain identifier added to the right depict recent isolates. Note that both the M. marinum
progenitor and the M. ulcerans MRCA are hypothetical strains. Features differentiating clusters or strains are dedicated to the
branches between the nodes. RDs indicated here are all differentiated by features that are also shown in Fig. 4, whereas more
RDs bear supporting features between the nodes (Table 1). The lengths of the internodes do not reflect time or genetic distance.
exception that showed no ISE involvement). In contrast,
such changes were frequent in the isolates belonging to
the classical lineage, where rearrangements of DNA fragments, at least partly caused by the activity of insertion
sequence elements, led to complex genome reorganizations and interspersing of regions with other DNA fragments.

lineage, no additional differences were obtained with the
16 African, seven Australian, one Malaysian and two
Papua New Guinean lineage members analysed. The prototype microarray used covered only 10% of the genome
of strain Agy99 [17] and a whole genome array would be
likely to identify more InDel diversity within the classical
lineage.

In our earlier microarray based analysis we hybridized
genomic DNA from a set of M. ulcerans isolates belonging
to the classical lineage to a panel of genomic fragments
prepared from the sequenced reference strain Agy99 [17].
Although this approach favoured detection of InDel diversity within the classical lineage, only two subgroups could
be distinguished within this lineage. While a single deletion of 3.45 kb in RD3C distinguished two Australian isolates from all other isolates belonging to the classical

The presence of irreversible genomic changes enabled us
to unambiguously resolve an intra-species evolutionary
scenario for M. ulcerans. The approach of InDel based phylogenetic analysis is independent of implied probabilities
and has the advantage of giving a precise understanding of
the direction of evolution of M. ulcerans strains. This evolutionary scheme advances the present descent information and is compatible with phylogenetic trees that have
been proposed based on data obtained with other typing

methods [23-25]. A recent report described several novel
mycolactone-producing mycobacteria that were not associated with causing Buruli ulcer in humans [27], and subsequent MLSA suggested that they show very high affinity
to M. ulcerans strains from South America [2,27]. We envision that application of the deletion analysis described
here has the power to confirm and refine the phylogenetic
relationship of these strains, where one would predict
they belong to the M. ulcerans ancestral lineage.
All typing methods applied so far to M. ulcerans isolates
from Africa and Australia revealed surprisingly few differences [18-21]. M. tuberculosis may have adapted to its
human host far back in the beginning of human evolution
[8,13], and M. leprae, the paradigm microbe for genome
reduction, is so adapted to an intracellular lifestyle in
human hosts that it is unable to grow in culture [28-30].
In comparison, M. ulcerans is suspected to have evolved
more recently from an environmental bacillus to a mammalian pathogen [5,17]. Environmental changes, perhaps
due to human activity, are suspected as a driving force for
its emergence [31]. The diffuse picture of transmission
possibilities of Buruli ulcer may reflect infection pathways
that are more random than specifically evolved and
human-adapted. The observed genome shrinkage of
roughly 1 Mb from M. marinum to the classical lineage of
M. ulcerans [1,5] probably reflects adaptation to a more
stable environment(s) [17]. Preliminary inspection of the
RDs showed that, apart from ISEs and phages, proteins
involved in intermediary metabolism and respiration
were prominent among the lost coding sequences (CDS)
in all five M. ulcerans subgroups. Only in the Mexican haplotype a trend towards overproportional loss of proteins
classified for virulence, detoxification, and adaptation was
observed. In particular, in the classical lineage members of
the PE/PPE gene families were highly represented in the
repertoire of disrupted CDSs. Interestingly, four particular
members of these protein families are eliminated in three
of the five haplotypes by independent disruption processes. The fact that most cases of Buruli ulcer are caused by
strains belonging to the classical lineage may either be
indicative of a higher virulence in comparison to the
ancestral lineage or of a higher prevalence in habitats relevant for transmission. It has to be further investigated
whether severe Buruli ulcer lesions in the countries
affected by M. ulcerans ancestral lineage strains are only
occasional, as apparent from the clinical reports, or if
additional cases presently remain either misdiagnosed or
underreported. However, preliminary observations based
on IS2404 identification in the Amazon region of Peru
revealed low prevalence of Buruli ulcer disease although
detection of IS2404 in the environment was similar to
what was found in Benin (H. Guerra et al., submitted).
Thus, it seems more likely that, after formation of the M.
ulcerans MRCA from a M. marinum progenitor, the distinct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/177

genomic changes forged the classical lineage and rendered
this emerging lineage more virulent. It is tempting to speculate that members of the ancestral lineage remained
largely environmental mycobacteria that only occasionally affect humans in the endemic regions. The classical
lineage haplotypes instead became widely dispersed,
resulting in a clonal population within Africa and Australia. The ability to chronically infect mammalians, leading to shedding into the environment, may represent a
property that is gaining importance for the survival of the
species in highly endemic areas. A comprehensive comparison of the proteomes of the two M. ulcerans lineages
may give insight into the differences of their adaptive biology.

Conclusion
In this work, we present a detailed analysis of deletions,
insertions, InDels, and genomic rearrangements by comparative genomics that distinguishes between five haplotypes of M. ulcerans, for which high-resolution genomic
fingerprinting is still lacking. From this analysis, we have
reconstructed the phylogenetic evolution of M. ulcerans in
two distinct lineages, with the ancestral lineage being
genetically closer to the environmental Mycobacterium
marinum, and the classical lineage having undergone
extensive genome reorganization and reduction. These
findings contribute to the understanding of differences in
pathogenicity across M. ulcerans isolates and sheds new
light on the phylogeography of this emerging human
pathogen. Distinction of subgroups within these M. ulcerans lineages leads us to conclude that InDels serve as evolutionary landmarks for differentiation within the species
and help in the development of a genotyping strategy for
both M. ulcerans and other environmental and pathogenic
mycobacteria.

Bacterial pellets of about 60 mg (wet weight) were heat
inactivated for 1 hour at 95°C in 500 μl extraction buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, 25 mM EDTA, 5% monosodium glutamate), and sequentially treated with lysozyme (2 h, 37°C,
17 M lysozyme) and proteinase K (overnight, 45°C, 0,3 M
proteinase K in proteinase K buffer: 1 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM
EDTA, 0,05% SDS, pH7.8). After digestion, the samples
were subjected to bead beater treatment (7 min, 3000
rpm, Mikro-Dismembrator S, B. Braun Biotech International, Melsungen, Germany) with 300 μl of 0.1 mm zirconia beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA).
DNA was extracted from the supernatants by phenol-chloroform (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) extraction and subjected to ethanol precipitation. DNA concentration was
measured by optical density at 260 nm (GeneQuant spectrophotometer).
DNA methods
PCR was performed using FirePol 10× buffer and 0,5 μl
FirePolTaq-Polymerase (Solis BioDyne, Tartu, Estonia),
2,5 ng genomic DNA, 0,6 μM forward and reverse primers
each, 1,5 mM MgCl2 and 0,4 mM of each dNTP in a total
volume of 25 μl. Long-range PCR polymerase mix (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) was applied according to
the manufacturer's protocol to retrieve PCR products
longer than 3 kb and up to 8 kb. PCR reactions were run
in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 PCR machine. The thermal profile for PCR amplification of M. ulcerans genomic
DNA included an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 5
min, followed by 32 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, annealing
at 57°C for 30 sec, and elongation at 72°C for 30 sec to 4
min. The PCR reaction was finalized by an extension step
at 72°C for 10 min followed by the analysis of the PCR
products on 1–2% agarose gels by gel electrophoresis
using ethidium bromide staining and the AlphaImager
illuminator and AlphaImager software (Alpha Innotech,
San Leandro, CA, USA). Primers were designed using the
Primer3 software [32].

PCRs fragments produced for analysis of unknown
genomic sequences were either purified using PEG800
precipitation and subjected to direct sequencing or cloned
using the pGEM-T cloning kit (Promega, Wallisellen,
Switzerland), transformed into JM109 (Sigma Aldrich,
Buchs, Switzerland) bacterial cells, and sequenced after
DNA preparation (Miniprep-Kit, Sigma Aldrich, Buchs,
Switzerland). Sequencing was performed using the Big
Dye kit and the AbiPrism310 genetic sequence analyzer
(Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Sequences were subjected to alignment and comparison with the AbiPrism
Autoassembler version 1.4.0 (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham,
MA, USA).

Phylogenetic construction and DNA sequence analysis of
RDs
Detailed phylogenetic reconstruction of the M. ulcerans
collection was based on the detection of phylogenetically
informative mutations over more than 410 kb including
insertional-deletional diversity and genomic rearrangements as described in the following. Comparative genetic
analysis of the RDs was achieved using a combination of
PCR with perfect and/or degenerate primers, cloning,
sequencing and primer walking. The M. ulcerans strain
Agy99 genome sequence [33] and, in some instances, the
M. marinum strain M (ATCC BAA-535) genome sequence
were used as a template for PCR primer design [34]. For
the five InDel haplotypes, we chose two strains each for
PCR scanning and sequencing: Ghana 970359 and Australia 940339; Australia 5142 and Australia 5147; China
98912 and Japan 8756; French Guyana 7922 and Surinam
842; Mexico 5114 and Mexico 5143. Sequences of those
strains were systematically aligned to the M. marinum M
genome to identify and characterize InDels and genomic
rearrangements. For each of these selected strains,
between 1 and 3 kb of DNA was sequenced on each edge
of the deletion. Insertions substituting the deletions were
sequenced in total, and aligned genomic regions of the
selected strains were scanned for their presence and size at
least every 1 kb. All insertion elements within the 12 RDs
were spanned using PCR in order to monitor their presence in the investigated strains. For crucial regions differing between the haplotypes, the whole strain collection
was monitored by PCR. The resulting sequence information was subjected to comparative in silico sequence analysis including the M. marinum M strain and the M. ulcerans
Agy99 strain sequence information.
Data analyses and bioinformatics
Retrieved sequences were compared to the BuruList [35]
and the M. marinum [36] blast servers and analysed using
the sequence manipulation suite [37], the sequence alignment tool blast 2 sequences [38], and the Artemis software release 6 [39]. Some sequences were aligned to the
M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome [40]. Linear genomic comparison was performed using the Artemis Comparison
Tool software release 5 [41], with a cutoff value of 100 bp.
