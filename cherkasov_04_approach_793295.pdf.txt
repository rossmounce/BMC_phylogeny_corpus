Abstract
Background: A new sequence independent bioinformatics approach allowing genome-wide
search for proteins with similar three dimensional structures has been developed. By utilizing the
numerical output of the sequence threading it establishes putative non-obvious structural
similarities between proteins. When applied to the testing set of proteins with known three
dimensional structures the developed approach was able to recognize structurally similar proteins
with high accuracy.
Results: The method has been developed to identify pathogenic proteins with low sequence
identity and high structural similarity to host analogues. Such protein structure relationships would
be hypothesized to arise through convergent evolution or through ancient horizontal gene transfer
events, now undetectable using current sequence alignment techniques. The pathogen proteins,
which could mimic or interfere with host activities, would represent candidate virulence factors.
The developed approach utilizes the numerical outputs from the sequence-structure threading. It
identifies the potential structural similarity between a pair of proteins by correlating the threading
scores of the corresponding two primary sequences against the library of the standard folds. This
approach allowed up to 64% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity in distinguishing protein pairs with high
structural similarity.
Conclusion: Preliminary results obtained by comparison of the genomes of Homo sapiens and
several strains of Chlamydia trachomatis have demonstrated the potential usefulness of the method
in the identification of bacterial proteins with known or potential roles in virulence.

Background
Pathogen proteins often manipulate host cellular functions by mimicking host activities. In some cases, mimicry
is achieved through virulence factors that are direct homologues of host proteins that have been incorporated into
the genome of the pathogen through horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) [1,2]. In others, convergent evolution has
produced new effectors that, although having no obvious

amino acid sequence similarity to host factors, mimic
them at the structural level [3].
Our recent research was conducted on the discovery of
novel bacterial virulence factors through identification of
pathogen genes that share a higher degree of sequence
similarity to host genes than would otherwise be expected
based on their phylogeny suggesting their likely

acquisition by HGT [4]. To achieve this objective we
developed novel bioinformatics tools to identify genes in
complete bacterial genomes, which may be cases of HGT
from eukaryotes. Based on a combined analysis of
136,195 genes from 36 bacterial and eukaryotic genome
sequences [4], we identified no definitive cases of "recent"
(defined as approximately since the divergence of mammals from other amniotes) HGT between bacteria and
multicellular eukaryotes, including human genes recently
sequenced in the Human Genome Project [5].
We have established that within the limitations of the
dataset used, there was a notable lack of genes in the
human and other genomes of multicellular eukaryotes
that were highly similar to genes from any bacterial species examined. While this analysis did show that bacterial
pathogens do contain "host-like" genes that may function
as mimics, for the most part these appear to be primarily
cases of either maintenance of an orthologous gene that
was lost in other lineages, or ancient HGT [4].
It has yet to be established the extent to which convergent
evolution events have played a role in the evolution of
pathogens, involving alternative mechanisms than then
HGT by which pathogens acquire host-mimicking virulence factors. Such genes and their corresponding proteins
would usually have distinct sequences from those of the
molecule they mimic, but would typically have evolved to
imitate, at least in part, the shape and critical chemical
groups on the surface of the functional homologues.
In the present work we describe our new efforts to identify
pathogen genes, encoding proteins that have low
sequence identity but potentially high structural similarity
with host proteins. The hypothesis is that under selective
pressure, pathogen genes have evolved to encode proteins
that functionally mimic host proteins independently of
significant primary sequence similarity. Such bacterial
proteins mimicking host's functions can, therefore, be
considered as potential virulence factors.

Results and Discussion
Genome – wide search for pathogen proteins that have
low sequence similarity but significant structural resemblance with host proteins represent an opportunity for
new insight into infectious agents, host cell biology and
the mechanisms of pathogenesis. Theoretically, such a
task should require a comprehensive modeling of threedimensional (3D) structures of proteins, what is not yet
achievable with useful accuracy nor is it computationally
feasible on the scale of thousands of sequences.
The existing methods of fold recognition can broadly be
divided into two types. In the first, the information is represented in linear form, called a profile, which is based on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/61

empirically derived scores for the expected occurrence of
residues in a particular structure [6-13]. This type of
approach is relatively rapid, but an unknown protein can
only be characterized if it has reasonable sequence similarity with protein(s) with known structure. The second
strategy is threading, which involves using pair potentials
that score the likelihood of two residues being at a certain
distance. This approach is based upon the assumption
that nature has made certain economic decisions wherein
countless different proteins fold into a limited number of
shapes (estimated to approximate 4000 [14] and that
nearly all natural protein structures can be described
based upon these shapes. Threading attempts to assign
folds for a protein of unknown structure by sampling it
onto each member of a library of known folds using
pseudo-energy as a measure of fit [15-20]. Threading
approaches have been shown to make accurate predictions even in a "twilight zone" of <25% sequence identity,
where sequence-based approaches normally fail [21].
Presently, however, neither profile-based nor threadingbased approaches are capable of direct identification of
structurally similar proteins from two different sources
(such as distinct organismal protein datasets).
The method
In order to allow for structural comparisons to be made
across genomes (where limited primary sequence identity
is the case) we have adopted an indirect approach to identify potential protein structural similarities, based upon a
broader utilization of the numerical outputs from derived
from threading applications. For each raw sequence
threaded onto the available 1893 model folds using the
THREADER2 package [18] we derived Z scores representing the weighted sum of pair wise and solvation energies.
Our hypothesis is that each sequence will have its own
unique threading profile against a library of model folds
and therefore, by correlating these "fingerprints" for two
linear sequences it is possible to estimate the degree of
potential 3D structural similarity. To support this argument, we have examined if complete sets of threading
scores should indeed correlate for two structurally similar
proteins. A dataset of 866,631 selected pair wise alignments of protein chains with "possible biologically interesting similarities" and covering whole 0–100% range of
sequence similarity has been used for the study.

This dataset has been generated by an "all against all"
comparison of protein chains in PDB by the authors of a
combinatorial extension (CE) algorithm [22,23]. A CE
approach has been shown to accurately identify the similarity of protein structures using a dynamic programming
algorithm determining the RMSD and a significance score
"Z" for optimal structural alignment. The publicly available CE dataset includes the alignments of proteins (with
length difference no more then 30%) corresponding to Z

value above 3.5 threshold. Notably, 783,841 or more then
90% of the sequence alignments in the set have sequence
identity below 20%. This circumstance makes it very favorable to use it for testing the threading-based approach.
We have downloaded CE dataset from [24] and processed
the protein chains with a THREADER2 package to produce their threading profiles against 1893 library folds.
For every aligned pair of proteins from the dataset we have
estimated a correlation between their threading scores. If
a set of threading scores against a standard library is
indeed sequence specific, then for proteins with known
structures we should be able to observe a defined relationship between coefficients of threading scores correlation
and parameters of protein 3D structural similarity.
On a Figure 1 (color-coded according to the plots density)
the estimated squared coefficients of correlations between
threading scores are plotted against RMSD values for
846,534 selected CE – pair wise alignments of proteins

with known structure. As it can readily be seen, the meaningful correlations between threading scores (squared correlation coefficients R2 above 0.7) correspond to higher
quality structural alignments with lower RMSD.
A RMSD value of 2Å is normally considered as a threshold
value distinguishing pairs of structurally similar proteins.
Thus, as it was anticipated, the thresholds R2~0.7 and
RMSD ~2Å clearly separate two most populated areas
which correspond to pairs of proteins with low and high
structural similarity (R2 < 0.7; RMSD > 2Å) and (R2 > 0.7;
RMSD < 2Å).
A quantitative assessment of protein structural similarity
is rather an ambiguous task; thus some structural alignments produce the alignment score Z along with excessively high RMSD parameters, or instead there are few
well-superimposed protein pairs in the CE dataset with
rather low Z. Therefore, to further support the previous
observations, we have introduced an additional

parameter (we called structure similarity score – SSS) calculated as the structural alignment score Z (ranging from
0 to 10) divided by the sum of the corresponding RMSD
value and a factor of 10: SSS = Z/(10+RMSD). Thus, SSS is
normalized to [0–1] range, where 1 corresponds to a pair
of completely similar protein structures superimposed
with Z = 10 and RMSD = 0.
In Figure 2, the SSS parameters calculated for 846,534
alignments are plotted against the coefficients of correlations between threading scores. The plots on a graph can
be conventionally divided into three major areas of low
(SSS < 0.4), medium (0.4 < SSS < 0.6) and high (SSS > 0.6)
structural similarity. The graph indicates that the vast
majority of protein pairs with correlated threading scores
(R2 > 0.7) fail into areas of medium and high structural
similarity.

To assess a distinguishing power of R2 cutoff we have estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the approach in
recognizing pairs of superimposed proteins with RMSD <
2Å. The calculated sensitivity and specificity parameters
are plotted on a Figure 3 for entire [0–1] range of the R2.
According to the estimated numbers (true negative predictions (TN): 790630, true positive predictions (TP): 18060,
false negative predictions (FN): 28623, false positive predictions (FP): 9221) the approach allows to achieve 99%
specificity TN/(FP+TN) in distinguishing protein pairs
with RMSD < 2Å when threshold R2 = 0.68 is used. The
corresponding sensitivity TP/(TP+FN) of the method
reaches 38.7%. The predictive value positive TP/(TP+FP)
and the predictive value negative TN/(TN+FN) are 66.2%
and 96.5% respectively. Similar evaluation of protein
pairs with medium and high degree of similarity (or SSS >
0.4) can also relate 99% specificity level with R2 = 0.68
threshold, while the corresponding sensitivity could be

sional similarity between the corresponding protein structures. When the threshold R2 = 0.68 is used the general
accuracy of the developed approach (TP+TN)/
(TP+TN+FP+FN) is 95.1%.
The training set has also been used to estimate the receiver
operating characteristic plots (ROC). The ROC plot is
obtained by plotting all sensitivity values (true positive
fraction) on y axis against their equivalent (1-specificity)
values (false positive fraction) for all available thresholds
on the x axis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is usually taken as an important single measure of overall accuracy of approach that is not dependent on the particular
threshold.

estimated as 47% (Figure 4). The sensitivity of the
developed approach improves with increase of the structural similarity criteria. For highly similar proteins (alignments producing SSS > 0.6) from the CE dataset sensitivity
reaches 92%.

We have plotted the specificity versus selectivity parameters of the developed approach on 0–1.0 range of the R
threshold with the step of 0.01. The calculation has been
conducted on the training set of low sequence similarity
alignments. The resulting ROC curve is presented on a Figure 5. As it can be seen, the resulting ROC covers more
then a half of the chart's area reflecting the fact, that the
approach gives better then a chance performance. Therefore, the developed approach has a valid general predictive power and, thus, provides an opportunity to
investigate potential structural similarity between two
proteins without actual modeling of their structures.

Thus, it is feasible to conclude, that the coefficient of correlation between 1893 threading scores for 2 raw
sequences can adequately indicate putative three-dimen-

In addition, it should also be outlined, that the developed
approach does not impose requirement for high quality
assignment of sequence to particular fold(s) by threading.

In fact, one or even both proteins may not be assigned by
THREADER2 to any known folds, but their resulting
threading profiles can be used to reveal the existing structural similarity.

In spite the fact, that neither 1BUI:C or 2SAK could not be
assigned to certain fold, their threading possess a correlation coefficient, R, of 0.83 clearly indicating high structural similarity between 1BUI:C and 2SAK.

To illustrate this point, the threading scores for sequences
of staphylokinases 1BUI:C and 2SAK are presented on a
Figure 6 as histograms. As it can readily be seen, neither of
these sequences could be assigned to certain fold, as a
minimal threshold for reliable fold recognition is 3.5 (displayed as a horizontal bar on a Figure 6). At the same
time, structures of proteins 1BUI:C and 2SAK can be
superimposed with RMSD = 1.3Å and therefore are very
similar.

The developed approach has further been applied to a random set of proteins with known structure. Using CE programs have been superimposed 1800 randomly selected
proteins from Protein Databank (PDB) on "all against all"
basis to generate 3,240,000 redundant structural alignments (small fraction of alignments could not be
produced). In the same time, all 1700 corresponding
sequences have been processed with the THREADER2
package and the generated threading scores datasets have
been cross-correlated to produce 3,222,731 correlation
coefficients.

RMSD values of pair wise alignments of randomly selected protein chains versus the corresponding parameters R.

The generated RMSD values for random pair wise structural alignments are plotted against the corresponding R2
parameters on a Figure 7. The shape of the graph resembles previously obtained well-like "RMSD vs R2"
dependence for selected CE dataset. Major areas of true
positive and true negative observations for the random
dataset can be separated by R2 threshold value of 0.5. Similar cutoff level can be observed on a Figure 8. representing a relationship between SSS and R2 parameters for
3,222,731 random structural alignments under consideration. Areas of protein alignments with low (SSS < 0.4)
and medium (0.4 < SSS < 0.6) structural similarity are
clearly separated by the R2~0.5 threshold. There are very
few highly similar proteins (with SSS > 0.6) have been
observed within a random dataset.
Thus, when applied to the random dataset of protein with
known 3D structures, the developed approach (operating
R2 = 0.68 cutoff value) has a sensitivity of 50% for the
alignments with RMSD < 2Å (651 FP, 23,432 FN, 23,765

TP and 3,174,891 TN) and 64% if SSS = 0.4 is used as a
criteria of similar structures. The specificity in both cases
remains at 99.9% level. On a random dataset of aligned
protein structures the R2 = 0.68 threshold value identifies
protein pairs with SSS > 0.6 with the sensitivity of 97 %.
When SSS value reaches >= 0.7, both sensitivity and specificity of the developed approach stay around 99% (Figure 9).
The results obtained on selected and random datasets of
proteins with known structures allow concluding, that the
developed approach is enable to identify with reasonable
accuracy proteins with medium and high levels of
structural similarity. To address the question whether the
developed approach is sequence dependent, we have estimated its sensitivity and selectivity in distinguishing structurally similar proteins (with SSS > 0.6) at 0 – 20%, 20 –
40% and 40 – 60 % levels of sequence identity. The corresponding results presented on a Figure 10 illustrate that
the predictive power of the developed approach varies

Apparently, the threading profiles of structurally similar
proteins become less resembling as their sequence identity drops. This observation is somewhat contradictory
since threading is considered to be independent from
sequence identity information.

Considering the specific need of the approach to recognize structurally similar proteins with low sequence identity and taking into account a large number of protein
alignments with SSS > 0.6 (negative counts) in the investigated CE database, we have compiled an additional
training set. The set only included protein pairs with low
sequence identity (>20%) and had equal representation
of proteins alignments with SSS below and above 0.6
threshold.
Thus, 244 pair wise sequence alignments with low similarity have been extracted from the CE set. This comprised

scores).

all 122 alignments with SSS above 0.6 threshold and 122
randomly selected ones with SSS < 0.6. The use of R = 0.68
threshold has yielded the following predictions: TP: 44,
TN: 122, FP: 0, FN: 78. These correspond to 36 %
sensitivity TP/(TP+FN), 100% specificity TN/(FP+TN),
100 % predictive value positive TP/(TP+FP) and 61% predictive value negative TN/(TN+FN).
The estimated numbers allow to conclude that the developed approach utilizing quantitative outputs of threading
possesses useful sensitivity and specificity in recognizing
proteins with low sequence identity (below 20%) and
high structural similarity (SSS > 0.6). This makes it suitable for genome scaled studies.
Identification of structural homologues between H. sapien
and C. trachomatis proteins
The developed approach has been used to test the hypothesis that pathogenicity of microorganisms can dependent
on number of proteins in their genomes mimicking structures of host analogues. In order to evaluate this assumption we have examined human structural homologues
among proteins from Chlamydia trachomatis organism.

First of all, currently available proteomes of Homo sapien
and Chlamydia trachomatis strain D (30585 and 894
entries respectively) have been processed with the
THREADER2.
The generated threading profiles of human and Chlamydia proteins then have then been compared using the
developed approach, aiming to produce 30585 * 894 =
27,342,990 parameters R. All proteins from two genomes

Overall, we were able to produce 25,649,384 pair wise
comparisons of threading profiles of human and Chlamydia proteins (some short sequences have been rejected by
the threading). Out of these, only 636 protein alignments
produced sequence similarity value above 20%. Among
636 pairs of similar proteins, 86 (or 13.5 percent) have R
parameter above 0.68 threshold. The fraction of
structurally similar proteins among those with low
sequence identity (<20%) is 5.5 percent: 1,409,914 out of
25,648,748 alignments. This is 1.5 folds higher then the
proportion of potentially similar proteins found in the
training set of the CE sequence alignments (27,281
(FP+TP) out of the total of 846,534, or 3.2 percent). This
is an interesting finding, considering that the CE set of
"possible biologically interesting similarities" is already
heavily enriched with structurally similar proteins. On
another hand, these finding demonstrate the CE –
training set we have used for the threshold estimation, can
be used as rather adequate representation of bacterial
genome.
We have also compared the estimated positive count ratio
of 5.5 percent with the corresponding number for randomly sampled PDB – chains alignments. In this case we
have found much more significant difference of 8 folds:
5.5 versus 0.7 percent (the later can be calculated as a sum
of 23,765 true positive and 651 false positive predictions
for 3,222,731 random sequence alignments). Such rather
elevated occurrence of Chlamydia proteins with potential
structural similarity with human counterparts may illustrate the importance of the factors of convergent
evolution.
From the pool of human and Chlamydia protein alignments we have identified 40 pairs of single domain proteins with no detected sequence similarity (at E =
0.00001) and the highest R scores which are presented in
Table 1. Multi-domain proteins have not been considered
in the study to simplify the exercise.
If our assumptions about the conversion nature of bacterial virulent mimicry were correct, then we would expect
some chlamydial virulence factors to be found in the
table. Evaluation of the table indicates that a large part of
the presented Chlamydia proteins has indeed been already
previously identified as potential virulence factors. Thus,
five Chlamydia trachomatis putative out-membrane proteins (F, H, I, E and A types corresponding to the table
entries 2, 15, 17, 25 and 27 respectively) have been
detected by the developed approach as top virulence can-

didates. An important role of these proteins in Chlamydia
antigenic polymorphism has been previously underlined
in [25].
Among

from
the
Table
1,
gi3328486gbAAC67681.1 (entry 26) is known as a
Chlamydia virulence factor responsible for pathogen
survival in Ca – deficient environment; protein
gi3328822gbAAC67993.1 (entry 29) is a heat shock protein – one of potential Chlamydia virulence factors; protein YopC (entry 35) is involved in secretion of
pathogenic genetic material.
Chlamydia is "energy parasite" [25] importing ATP from
host cells. Thus, it came to no surprise, that ATP transport
protein gi3328511gbAAC67704.1 (kinase fold) has also
been identified as potential virulence factor (entry 10).
Two other potential Chlamydia virulence factors perform
transport
functions:
transpeptitase
gi3329155gbAAC68296.1 and protein translocase
gi3329345gbAAC68468.1 (entries 12 and 3 respectively).
The majority of other Chlamydia proteins presented in the
Table 10 can be divided into proteases (entries 23, 31, 37
proteases and metalloprotease 34) and proteins related to
DNA transcription (entries 6,8 – transcription proteins,
20 – nucleotide transport, 19 – DNA isomerase, 7,9,40 –
ribonucleases, riboreductase, 4,13,18,32 – Gly, isoLeu,
Ala and Leu tRNA synthetases).
Thus, the preliminary results allow to conclude, that out
of 33 top Chlamydia hit with assigned functions presented
in the Table, up to 11 proteins either have been previously
identified as pathogenic virulence factors or possess
define virulent characteristics. The predictive value positive (TP/TP+FP) of the approach above the separating
threshold R2 > 0.9 is as high as 92.33 % (for 846534 predictions 1052 FP, 34170 FN, 12513 TP and 798799 TN).
Therefore, it is expected that the most if not all of 40
Chlamydia proteins presented in Table 1 can be reliably
considered as structurally highly similar to their human
counterparts.
To assess the actual ability of the developed approach to
enrich for proteins attributable to virulence we need to
evaluate how many virulence factors can be found by
chance in random pool of 33 Chlamydia proteins. This is
not a trivial task as it requires the knowledge of the total
number of virulence genes in Chlamydia trachomatis
genome. At the moment the exact virulence content of the
Chlamydia trachomatis genome remains unknown, so we
attempted its evaluation using available literature data.
Thus, an indirect justification for this number can be
derived from the results of the work of Fields and all 1986

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/61

who have experimentally identified 81 genes of Salmonella
typhimurium responsible for its survival in professional
phagocytes [26,27]. Taking similar to the previous guess
that the real number of virulent factors is as twice as high,
the hypothetical virulence content of Salmonella typhimurium genome can be contemplated around 3.6% (162 out
of 4451 genes).
Thus, by the analogy, we may expect that about 4 percents
of an average bacterial proteome can be assigned to virulence associated proteins. Therefore, there is roughly 4
percent probability of random finding of virulence factors
in arbitrary pool of bacterial genes.
Based on that estimate, we may expect that among 33
annotated Chlamydia trachomatis proteins presented in
Table 1 one or two potential virulence factors could be
identified by chance. The fact, that there are about 11 of
them demonstrates that the developed approach is indeed
capable of 6 – 10 folds enriching for bacterial virulence
factors.

Conclusions
Virulence factors candidates from bacteria and viruses
having low sequence and high 3D similarity with host
proteins can be readily identified by the developed
approach. Its sensitivity can future be improved as efforts
to complete and organize the inventory of model folds are
successful [14] (as it has been mentioned the
THREADER2 takes into account only known 2000 model
folds that covers only about 50% of 4000 folds predicted).
The developed approach is not only applicable for identification of potential novel virulence factors in pathogen
genomes, but may be broadly used for all kinds of protein
similarity studies.

Methods
Sequence similarity search has been conducted with
BLAST program [28] with E value of 0.00001.
Threading has been carried out by the THREADER2 [18]
program with default parameters. The CATH v2.0
(November 2000) fold assembly has been used as a
library of standard folds.
Human proteome has been downloaded from ENSEMBL
database; the proteome of Chlamydia trachomatis serovar D
– from NCBI site.

Authors' contributions
SJ and AC have developed the general concept of the work
and participated in drawing the conclusions; AC has
preformed the fold prediction and carried out all the
calculations.
