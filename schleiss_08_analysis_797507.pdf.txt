Abstract
In this report we describe the genomic sequence of guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV)
assembled from a tissue culture-derived bacterial artificial chromosome clone, plasmid clones of
viral restriction fragments, and direct PCR sequencing of viral DNA. The GPCMV genome is
232,678 bp, excluding the terminal repeats, and has a GC content of 55%. A total of 105 open
reading frames (ORFs) of > 100 amino acids with sequence and/or positional homology to other
CMV ORFs were annotated. Positional and sequence homologs of human cytomegalovirus open
reading frames UL23 through UL122 were identified. Homology with other cytomegaloviruses was
most prominent in the central ~60% of the genome, with divergence of sequence and lack of
conserved homologs at the respective genomic termini. Of interest, the GPCMV genome was
found in many cases to bear stronger phylogenetic similarity to primate CMVs than to rodent
CMVs. The sequence of GPCMV should facilitate vaccine and pathogenesis studies in this model of
congenital CMV infection.

Findings
Guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) serves as a useful
model of congenital infection, due to the ability of the
virus to cross the placenta and infect the fetus in utero [13]. This model is well-suited to vaccine studies for prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, a
major public health problem and a high-priority area for
new vaccine development [4]. However, an impediment
to studies in this model has been the lack of detailed DNA
sequence data. Although a number of reports have identified specific gene products or clusters of genes [5-11], to
date a full genomic sequence has not been available.

We recently reported the construction and preliminary
sequence map of a GPCMV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone maintained in E. coli [12,13], and this
clone was used as an initial template for sequence analysis
of the full GPCMV genome. BAC DNA was purified using
Clontech's NucleoBond® Plasmid Kits as described previously [14] and both strands were sequenced using an ABI
PRISM® 377 DNA Sequencer, with primers synthesized, as
needed, to 'primer-walk' the nucleotide sequence. In parallel, Hind III- and EcoR I-digested fragments were gelpurified and cloned into pUC and pBR322-based vectors
as previously described [15]. Plasmid sequences were

determined from overlapping Hind III and EcoR I fragments using the map coordinates originally described by
Gao and Isom [16]. These sequences were compared to
the BAC sequence to facilitate assembly of a full-length
contiguous sequence. Since the cloning of the BAC in E.
coli involved insertion of BAC origin sequences into the
Hind III "N" region of the viral genome, sequence
obtained from this specific restriction fragment cloned in
pBR322 was utilized for assembly of the final contiguous
sequence; analysis of this sequence confirmed that there
were no adventitious deletions in the Hind III "N" region
generated during the original BAC cloning process. Since
a deletion in the Hind III "D" region occurred during cloning of the GPCMV BAC in E. coli [17], DNA sequence from
a plasmid containing the full-length Hind III "D" fragment was similarly obtained, and used for assembly of the
final contiguous sequence. The GPCMV genomic
sequence has been deposited with GenBank (Accession
Number FJ355434).
Sequence analysis of GPCMV revealed a genome length of
232,678 bp with a GC content of 55%. This value is in
agreement with the value of 54.1% determined previously
by CsCl buoyant density centrifugation [18]. A total of
326 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified that were
capable of encoding proteins of ≥ 100 amino acids (aa).
For ORFs predicted by the sequence analysis that had substantial overlap with other adjacent or complementary
GPCMV ORFs that appeared to encode gene products that
were highly conserved in other cytomegaloviruses, only
those sequences with < 60% overlap with these highly
conserved ORFs were further analyzed. ORFs homologous
to those encoded by other CMVs with an e-value of < 0.1
and ≥ 100 aa were identified, based on comparisons analyzed using NCBI Blast (blastall version program 2.2.16).
Of the ORFs so identified, 104 had sequence and/or positional homology to one or more ORFs encoded by human
(HCMV), murine (MCMV), rat (RCMV), rhesus
(RhCMV), chimpanzee (CCMV), or tupaia herpesvirus
(THV) cytomegaloviruses (Table 1). Of note, homologs of
HCMV ORFs UL23 through UL122 were identified [19].
For ease of nomenclature, we have designated these ORFs
using upper case font (GP23 through GP122). ORFs with
homologs in other CMVs that do not correspond to
HCMV UL23 through UL122 have been designated with a
lower case "gp" prefix. Homologs of HCMV UL41a (69 aa;
gp38.2), UL51 (99 aa; GP51), and UL91 (87 aa; GP91)
were annotated in these initial analyses, based primarily
on positional, and not sequence, homology to the respective HCMV ORFs. Three ORFs, homologs of MHC class I
genes known to be encoded by multiple other CMVs (gp
147–149, Table 1) were also identified. One ORF, gp1
(homolog of CC chemokines), did not have a positional
or sequence homolog when compared to other CMVs, but
was included in the annotation because of its previous

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/139

molecular characterization [9]. Including ORFs with
mapped exons, the total number of ORFs annotated in
this preliminary analysis was 105 [Table 1].
A map of the GPCMV genome illustrating the relative
positions of these ORFs is shown in Fig. 1. ORFs that represent homologs of the individual exons of spliced HCMV
genes, in particular UL89 (terminase) and UL112/UL113
(replication accessory protein) are annotated separately.
The splice junction for the GP89 mRNA was predicted
based on comparisons to other CMVs. For the UL112/113
region, further studies will be required to map the precise
splicing patterns of the putative transcripts encoded by
this region of the GPCMV genome. Similarly, the ORF
encoding the sequence homolog of the HCMV IE transactivator, UL122, has been annotated without regard to the
splicing events previously shown to take place in this
region of the genome [20]; further analyses of cDNA from
this and other GPCMV genome regions of IE transcription, including those encoded in the Hind III 'D' region of
the genome, will likely result in annotation of multiple
heretofore unidentified ORFs. A comprehensive table of
all ORFs > 25 aa and their homology to other CMV
genomes is provided in additional files 1 and 2. As RNA
analyses are completed, the total number of annotated
GPCMV ORFs will expand in number.
The schematic representation of GPCMV ORFs demonstrated in Fig. 1 highlights several gene families of particular interest. Of particular interest and importance to
vaccine studies in the guinea pig model are conserved
homologs of the ORFs encoding major envelope glycoproteins gB, gH/gL/gO/, and gM/gN. These glycoproteins
are important determinants of humoral immune
responses in the setting of CMV infection, and serve as
potential subunit vaccine candidates. Of these, the gB
homolog has been demonstrated to confer protection
against congenital GPCMV infection in subunit vaccine
studies [21-23]. Homologs of putative HCMV immune
modulation genes, including G-protein coupled receptors
and major histocompatibility class I homologs, were also
identified [24]. Also of interest was the presence of multiple US22 gene family homologs, heavily clustered near
the rightward terminus of the GPCMV genome. These
ORFs predict protein products that are analogous to the
MCMV dsRNA-binding proteins, M142 and M143, that
have been shown to inhibit dsRNA-activated antiviral
pathways [25,26]. Members of this family have also been
implicated in macrophage tropism in MCMV [27]. Our
sequence analysis also confirmed the findings of Liu and
Biegalke [8] that the GPCMV genome does not encode a
positional homolog of the antiapoptotic HCMV UL36
gene [28]. However, an ORF with homology to R36,
which encodes the presumed RCMV cell death suppressor,
was identified (gp29.1, Table 1). Further studies will be

Protein Coding Map of GPCMV Genome
Protein Coding Map of GPCMV Genome. Schematic representation of the GPCMV genome demonstrating ORFs
described in the text. GPCMV ORFs with positional and/or sequence homology to HCMV ORFs are indicated in bold with
upper case prefixes (GP23 through GP122). ORFs that lack sequence or positional homologs in HCMV but share homology
with ORFs in other CMVs are indicated with lower case prefixes (see Table 1). Only the 5' terminal repeat (TR) is shown;
however, in about 50% of genomes the TR is duplicated at the 3' end [18]. Color-coding indicates ORFs of interest for vaccine
and pathogenesis studies: blue, envelope glycoprotein homologs; green, putative immune evasion/immune modulation gene
homologs; red, US22 superfamily homologs.

Comparison of GPCMV Glycoproteins with CMV Homologs
Comparison of GPCMV Glycoproteins with CMV Homologs. Sequences of GPCMV glycoproteins were aligned with
glycoproteins from six other CMV genomes (HCMV, MCMV, RCMV, RhCMV, THV, and CCMV) using both ClustalW [37] and
Muscle [38] using default parameters. Phylogenetic trees (neighbor joining) were generated from these alignments using
Jalview. Numbers at each node indicate mismatch percentages. Interestingly, GPCMV sequences closely match THV sequences
(see also, supplementary information), and generally appear closer to primate CMV glycoproteins in pair-wise comparisons
than to rodent CMV glycoproteins, as previously observed for gB [39]. Clustal comparisons for conserved glycoproteins gB
(GP55; Panel A) and gN (GP73; Panel B) are indicated.

required to determine whether this putative gene supplies
a UL36-like function.
It was also of interest to note the presence of ORFs that
have apparent homology to the MCMV M129-133 region.
This region has positional homologs in human and primate CMVs [29-31], but is absent in THV [32]. Recently,
it was determined that passage of GPCMV in cultured
fibroblasts promotes the deletion of a ~1.6-kb locus containing potential positional homologs of this gene cluster.
The presence of this 1.6 kb locus was found by Inoue and
colleagues to be associated with an enhanced pathogenesis of GPCMV in vivo [33]. We independently confirmed
the presence of this locus and its sequence in our salivary
gland-derived viral stocks, and have included this
sequence in our GenBank annotation (Accession Number
FJ355434). Further studies will be required to fully annotate the transcripts encoded by this region of the GPCMV
genome. Interestingly, the original GPCMV BAC clone
that we sequenced was derived using GPCMV viral DNA
obtained after long-term tissue culture passage of ATCC
2122 viral stock, and not surprisingly this BAC was found
to lack the 1.6 kb virulence locus [12]. Subsequently, PCR
and preliminary sequencing of a more recently obtained
GPCMV BAC clone with an excisable origin of replication
[17] revealed that the 1.6-kb sequence was retained in this
clone. The apparent modifications of this locus that occur
following viral passage on fibroblast cells are reminiscent
of the mutations and deletions that occurred during
fibroblast-passage of HCMV [34] and rhesus CMV [35].
The congruence of these events suggests that the selective
pressures that promote mutational inactivation of genes
in this region may be similar across viral species. Additional analyses, including sequencing of a full-length
GPCMV genome derived from replicating virus in vivo,
will be required to determine what other deletions or
mutations are present in genomes from tissue culture-passaged viruses. Since additional ORFs are likely to be identified by these analyses, we have annotated the first ORF
identified in the BAC sequence to the right of this 1.6 kb
region as gp138 (Fig. 1), to allow for ease of nomenclature
as ORFs in this virulence locus are better characterized.
Application of other genome sequence analysis methods,
including identification of small or overlapping genes and
further assessment of mRNA splicing or unconventional
translation signals, will likely result in identification of
other putative ORFs in future studies [36].
Comparisons of GPCMV ORFs with sequences from other
CMV genomes yielded interesting results. ORF translations were compared with all proteins from the 6
sequenced CMV genomes (HCMV, MCMV, RCMV,
RhCMV, THV, and CCMV), and hits with e-values less
than 1e-5 were aligned individually for each protein, using
both ClustalW (version 1.82; [37]) and Muscle (version

3.6; [38]). The alignments were then used to generate trees
based on neighbor-joining using JalView. Clustal trees for
glycoproteins B (GP55) and N (GP73) are shown in Fig. 2,
with distance scores indicated. Overall, comparison of the
various glycoproteins (gB, gM, gH, and gO) yielded similar phylogenies, with GPCMV glycoproteins generally
appearing closer to primate CMVs than rodent CMVs [39],
except for the gN homolog, which appears closer to
rodents. ClustalW and Muscle comparisons of GPCMV
ORFs with homologous ORFs from the other sequenced
CMVs are provided in additional file 3.
In summary, the complete DNA sequence of GPCMV was
determined, using a combination of sequencing of BAC
DNA, viral DNA, and cloned Hind III and EcoRI fragments. These analyses identified both conserved ORFs
found in all mammalian CMVs, as well as the presence of
novel genes apparently unique to the GPCMV. These similarities underscore the usefulness of the guinea pig
model, with positive translational implications for development and testing of CMV intervention strategies in
humans. Further characterization of the GPCMV genome
should facilitate ongoing vaccine and pathogenesis studies in this uniquely useful small animal model of congenital CMV infection.
