In silico reversal of repeat-induced point
mutation (RIP) identifies the origins of repeat
families and uncovers obscured duplicated genes
James K Hane1,3, Richard P Oliver2*

Abstract
Background: Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) is a fungal genome defence mechanism guarding against
transposon invasion. RIP mutates the sequence of repeated DNA and over time renders the affected regions
unrecognisable by similarity search tools such as BLAST.
Results: DeRIP is a new software tool developed to predict the original sequence of a RIP-mutated region prior to
the occurrence of RIP. In this study, we apply deRIP to the genome of the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum
SN15 and predict the origin of several previously uncharacterised classes of repetitive DNA.
Conclusions: Five new classes of transposon repeats and four classes of endogenous gene repeats were identified
after deRIP. The deRIP process is a new tool for fungal genomics that facilitates the identification and
understanding of the role and origin of fungal repetitive DNA. DeRIP is open-source and is available as part of the
RIPCAL suite at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ripcal.

Background
Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) is a genome
defence mechanism found within filamentous ascomycete fungi that is purported to combat transposon invasion. RIP mutates duplicated DNA sequences during
sexual reproduction, thereby inactivating genes encoded
in both copies. First discovered in Neurospora crassa
[1,2], RIP was later demonstrated in the Ascomycetes
Magnaporthe oryzae [3,4], Podospora anserina [5], Leptosphaeria maculans [6] and Fusarium graminearum
[7]. Putative RIP events have also been detected bioinformatically in Aspergillus fumigatus [8], Fusarium oxysporum [9-11], Aspergillus nidulans [12], Neurospora
tetrasperma [13], Microbotryum violaceum [14], Aspergillus oryzae [15], Magnaporthe oryzae [16], Colletotrichum cereal [17], Aspergillus niger [18], Penicillium
chysogenum [18] and most recently in Stagonospora
nodorum [19,20]. Given this broad distribution, it is
reasonable to assume that RIP is widespread across,

but so far restricted to, filamentous ascomycota and
basidiomycota.
The mechanism by which RIP operates is yet to be
fully understood, but the following observations have
been made. RIP involves transition mutations from C:G
to T:A nucleotide base pairs in duplicated DNA; this
affects both copies of the repeat and occurs prior to
meiosis [1,2]. In the majority of cases studied so far,
there is a strong bias for the mutation of C:G nucleotide
base pairs followed by A:T nucleotide base pairs
[18,21,22]. Thus CpA di-nucleotides are more frequently
affected than any of the other 15 di-nucleotides. CpA
nucleotides are converted to TpA. Coincidentally, the
complementary TpG di-nucleotide on the opposite
strand is also converted to TpA (Table 1). In N. crassa,
RIP requires ≥ 80% identity of duplicated DNA over a
length of ≥ 400 bp [23,24].
The consequences of RIP are that repeated DNA segments, such as would result from the transposition of a
retrotransposon, or the duplication of a gene, are
mutated and inactivated. RIP would be expected to
operate in successive sexual cycles until the sequence
identity between duplicated sequences is reduced below
the minimum homology threshold required by the RIP

The deRIP process counts the occurrence of the contributing di-nucleotides
incrementally across a multiple alignment of repeats and alters the consensus
sequence at each position to the appropriate pre-RIP di-nucleotide sequence.

machinery. The genome would then contain a repeat
family consisting of relics of the duplication event
degraded to varying degrees.
The rapid increase in the number of fungal genome
assemblies has created a demand for methods to detect
and quantify RIP. Two approaches have been used; RIP
indices and alignment methods. RIP increases the frequency of particular di-nucleotides (TpA in most cases
studied to date) in affected regions of DNA. Thus RIP
can be identified by comparing ratios of di-nucleotide
frequencies in pre-RIP to post-RIP sequences; these
ratios are referred to as “RIP indices” [8,12,25,26]. However, in reality RIP depends upon the alignment of two
similar regions of double-stranded DNA [23] and therefore it is more appropriate to use alignments of repeat
families to identify and quantify RIP. We have previously introduced a rapid, automated alignment-based
procedure for the whole-genome analysis of RIP mutation called RIPCAL [20]. Using this procedure, we readily identified and quantified the degree of RIP in all
repeated DNA families within the genome of the necrotrophic fungal wheat pathogen S. nodorum.
Stagonospora (syn. Septoria) nodorum [teleomorph:
Phaeosphaeria (syn. Leptosphaeria) nodorum (Müll)
Hedjar.] is a major pathogen of wheat and is a model
for the fungal class Dothideomycetes, a taxon that
includes many important pathogens of crops [27].
S. nodorum infects wheat crops in most wheat-growing
areas of the world [28]. Infection is predominantly
determined by the presence of various effectors (hostspecific toxins) harboured by different strains of the fungus [29]. The fungus is heterothallic (out-crossing) and
the mating types are evenly distributed [30]. The fungus
over-summers as ascospores on stubble [28] and multiplies via asexual reproduction during the growing season. The pathogen displays high levels of variability as
determined by genomic analyses [31,32] and this has
been exploited to determine the biogeographic history
of the pathogen [33]. The pattern of micro-satellite

markers is consistent with a pattern whereby the pathogen originated in the “Golden Triangle” region and
spread as wheat cultivation was adopted in Eurasia and
North Africa several thousand years ago and into North
and South America, South Africa and Australia since
European colonisation.
An initial survey of the nuclear genome sequence of a
West Australian isolate (strain SN15) [19] identified 26
repeat families which comprised 6.2% of assembly. The
role and origin of several repeat families could not be
inferred by homology. We ascribed this to RIP mutation,
after which all copies were unrecognisable. RIPCAL
analysis showed that the repetitive DNA of SN15
was subject to RIP-like changes [20]. The rDNA repeat
(Y1) exhibits selective susceptibility to RIP mutation
(Figure 1). RIP does not affect copies located within the
tandem rDNA array (also referred to as the nucleolus
organiser region, or NOR, Figure 1: regions 3 & 4)
[1,34]. One exception was found in a repeat at the array
terminus, which showed evidence of RIP at similar levels
to those of non-rDNA array repeats. rDNA repeats were
also found scattered throughout the genome. Within the
non-rDNA array repeats, short repeats (defined as <
1 kb, however the majority were < 300 bp) did not show
evidence of RIP whilst the long repeats (> 1 kb) were
RIP-affected [20]. Due to the presence of both RIPaffected and non-RIP-affected copies, the rDNA repeat
was perfectly suited to be used as a test case for the
validity of bioinformatic predictions of RIP.
The presence and activity of transposons in
S. nodorum had previously been studied using a transposon trap procedure [35]. Several strains of S. nodorum
from the United Kingdom (UK) were plated on chlorate
[36] to select for mutations in the nitrate reductase
(Nia1) structural gene. Using the cloned Nia1 gene as a
probe [37] several insertional mutants were identified.
Three insertions were cloned and sequenced [35]. These
insertion sequences, named Molly, Pixie and Elsa, represented intact copies of active transposons (Table 2).
Southern blots probed with these transposons revealed
large variations in copy number, band size and band
intensity between strains. When the sequences of the
intact copies of these transposons were compared to the
genome sequence of the SN15 strain [19], related repetitive regions were identified. However, no active (nonRIP-affected) copies of these transposons were found in
the SN15 assembly. The lack of active transposons
within SN15 was intriguing and raises the question of
the relationship of the repeat families to the active
transposons in the UK isolates. This relationship is
addressed here.
Building upon the RIPCAL procedure, we describe
here a new technique to reverse the effects of RIP mutation in silico: “deRIP”. The deRIP process involves

repeats found in the genome of S. nodorum strain SN15. Each repeat was compared for mutation with the alignment majority consensus
(black = match, grey = mismatch, white = gap). The mutation of CpN di-nucleotides is color-coded according to the legend (left). In S. nodorum
RIP is characterised by the mutation of CpA di-nucleotides (red). Y1 rDNA repeats are grouped according to their genomic location and length.
Full length rDNA repeats scattered randomly throughout the genome are prone to RIP whereas short, incomplete copies (defined as <1 kb but
generally <300 bp) are not affected. rDNA repeats located in a tandem array at the 3’ end of scaffold 5 [NCBI: CH445329] are protected from RIP,
excepting a single repeat. (B) The S. nodorum tandem rDNA array, also known as the nucleolus organiser region (NOR), and flanking regions.
Region 1 contains gene encoding regions, region 2 contains non-rDNA repeats and regions 3 and 4 comprise the tandem rDNA array. RIP
mutates repetitive DNA, hence genes in region 1 are not RIP-mutated but repeats in region 2 are RIP-mutated (indicated in red). The tandem
rDNA array repeats are protected from RIP (region 4), except for a single repeat at the array terminus (region 3).

scanning a multiple alignment of a repeat family for
RIP-like polymorphism and reverting the alignment consensus to the putative pre-RIP-mutated sequence. The
resultant “deRIPped” sequence is a prediction of what a
RIP-mutated repeat DNA may have looked like prior to
RIP mutation. We have applied the deRIP process to the
repetitive DNA of S. nodorum SN15 which has
increased the number of recognisable repeat families
from 65% (17/26) to 92% (23/25).

Results
Validating the deRIP process using known non-RIPaffected repeats

The repetitive DNA content of the S. nodorum SN15
nuclear genome was previously estimated to contain 26
families comprising 6.2% of the assembly [19]. A repeat
family was defined if there were 10 or more copies, of
greater than 200 bp and sharing greater than 65%
sequence identity. Each family had been analysed by

Needleman-Wunsch global alignment was performed using a sub-region of long rDNA repeats corresponding to the short rDNA repeat consensus

Blastn hits and pairwise global percent identities to non-RIP-affected sequences were compared between the majority consensus and deRIP consensus versions.
(A) The transposons Elsa, Molly and Pixie of S. nodorum SN15 were compared to active copies of an alternate strain. In all 3 cases the deRIP sequences match
best to the active transposons. This is indicated by the ‘deRIP improvement’ factor and the differences in percent identities for global alignments. DeRIP
improvement is a measure of how much better the deRIP consensus matched the hit compared to the majority consensus. DeRIP improvement > 1 indicates
that the repeat family was derived from the hit or a related homolog, but was subsequently mutated by RIP. (B) RIP-protected copies of the S. nodorum rDNA
repeat are located within a tandem array (Figure 1). RIP-susceptible copies were grouped by size into long (> 1 kB) and short (< 1 kB) categories and compared
to the RIP-protected copies. Homology between RIP-protected repeats in rDNA array and long RIP-susceptible non-rDNA array repeats were improved by deRIP.
The rDNA array also contains one RIP-affected repeat at its terminus which shows similar levels of homology to the rDNA array as the majority consensus of the
long non-rDNA array repeats.

RIPCAL and the extent of RIP measured using the
CpA↔TpA dominance statistic [20]. RIP dominance
varied from 0.2 to 2.96 (by comparison to the highest G:
C content sequence). Blast comparisons predicted the
origin of 17 out of the 26 repeat families.
Functional and authentic transposon homologues of
the repeat families Molly, Pixie and Elsa had been previously characterized. Elsa was identified as a LTR retrotransposon; Molly and Pixie as Tc-1 Mariner elements
[38]. Characterized sequences were derived from UK
isolates of S. nodorum [35]. The maximum sequence
identity between the proteins encoded by the active
copies and matches within the SN15 genome assembly
was approximately 66% by blastx (Additional file 1).
To determine whether the SN15 repeats were derived
from the active copies via RIP mutation, the deRIP procedure was applied to the alignment of the Molly, Elsa
and Pixie-like sequences. The example shown in Figure
2 illustrates the deRIP process applied to the transposon
repeat Molly.
Molly-like repeat sequences of SN15 were aligned and
analysed for RIP mutation via RIPCAL [20] (Figure 2A).
The alignment includes 18 full length copies and 22
incomplete copies. Mismatches between individual
repeats and the majority consensus are colour-coded;
vertical red bars represent the CpA/TpG to TpA di-

nucleotide substitution previously shown to be the predominant RIP-induced change in S. nodorum [20]. The
predominance of red changes indicates that the repeat
family has been affected by RIP.
The Molly alignment was processed using the new
deRIP algorithm. The process is illustrated in Figure 2B
in a 51 bp subsection of the alignment from position
1900 to 1950. At position 1900-1901 of the alignment
there is a TpA di-nucleotide in 23 out of 24 copies and
TpG in one copy. This set of di-nucleotides corresponds
to the TpG® TpA mutation, which is characteristic of
RIP (the reverse complement of CpA® TpA, Table 1).
It was assumed that the TpA copies were derived from
an ancestral TpG via RIP. Therefore while the majority
consensus (alignment consensus by base majority) was
TpA at this position, the deRIP process changed this to
the most probable pre-RIP sequence - TpG. This process was extended across the length of the repeat alignment, producing a new sequence called the ‘deRIP
consensus’. This deRIP consensus sequence was
compared to the majority consensus as well as
the sequence of the active copy of Molly [NCBI:
AJ488502.1] (Figure 2B). In this example, deRIP changes
were labelled as “correct” where alterations in the deRIP
consensus agreed with the sequence of the active copy.
Nine such cases occurred in the highlighted section.

Figure 2 Application of the deRIP process to the Molly transposon repeat family of Stagonospora nodorum SN15. Molly is one of three
S. nodorum repeats with known functionally transposable sequence available [NCBI AJ488502.1]. (A) Genomic matches to the Molly repeat family
were aligned and compared for RIP-like polymorphism against a model sequence (in this case the majority consensus). RIP mutation of the form
CpN ¬® TpN was color-coded as indicated in the legend. (B) The deRIP process was applied to a 51 bp sub-region of the alignment.
A ‘majority’ consensus of the alignment represented the most abundant nucleotide at each alignment position. The deRIP consensus was
derived from the majority consensus, however where di-nucleotides were detected exhibiting RIP-like polymorphism (Table 1) they were
reverted back to their pre-RIP state. Changes in sequence between majority and deRIP consensus sequences was compared to the sequence
of the active transposon. (C) Phylogram showing relationships between all genomic regions, majority consensus, deRIP consensus and active
copy of the Molly repeat family. The deRIP consensus resembled the functional transposon more closely than the majority consensus, highest
G:C content sequence and the majority of matching genomic regions.

DeRIP changes were labelled as “errors” where the deRIP
changes and the active copy sequence did not agree.
There was one deRIP error in the sub-alignment at alignment position 1940-1. Non-deRIP related base differences, common between the majority and deRIP
consensus sequences but different in the active copy
sequence, occurred five times in the sub-alignment.
All the Molly-like repeats, the active copy, the alignment ‘majority’ consensus sequence and the new deRIP
consensus sequence were compared via RAxML (using
the gamma model and maximum-likelihood phylogeny)
[39] (Figure 2C). The deRIP-predicted sequence was a
closer match to the authentic, active copy than the
majority consensus. The relative levels of sequence similarity between the active transposon and the majority
and deRIP consensus sequences were also tested via
Needleman-Wunsch global alignment [40]. The
sequence identity between the active copy and majority
consensus was 72.3% whereas the identity between
the active copy and the deRIP consensus was 77.5%
(Table 2).
The deRIP process was applied to the other transposon repeat families with pre-existing characterized active
copy sequences, Pixie and Elsa. Table 2A summarises
the results for all three previously identified active
S. nodorum transposons. In the case of Molly, the majority consensus by blastn had an e-value to the active copy
of 7e-07 (bitscore = 66) whereas the deRIP consensus by
blastn had ane-value of 3e-86 (bitscore = 329). These
results can be summarised as a “deRIP improvement” of
329/66 = 5.0. DeRIP improvement factors were 1.8 and
2.1 and global percent identities to the active transposons were improved 3.9% and 2.5% for Elsa and Pixie
respectively (Table 2). The overall improvement in maximum bit scores to active transposons indicates that the
deRIP versions were significantly better matches to the
functional transposons that were the presumed ancestors of the sequences in the Australian SN15 strain.
The rDNA repeat family Y1 had been previously
demonstrated to show differential susceptibility to RIP
between its various copies (Figure 1) [20]. rDNA repeats
within a tandem rDNA array were not RIP-affected
except for one repeat at the array terminus. Non-rDNA
array repeats greater than 1 kb (which we call “long”)
showed evidence of RIP, however non-rDNA array
repeats less than 1 kb ("short”) did not. After deRIP was
applied to the consensus of long, non-rDNA array
repeats, the percent identity to the non-RIP-affected
rDNA-array consensus was improved by 4.5% - from
89.5% to 94% and the deRIP improvement factor was
1.3 (Table 2). Conversely, the percent identity between
the non-rDNA array short repeat consensus and the
rDNA array consensus was not improved by deRIP
(Table 2). The RIP-affected terminal rDNA repeat and

Page 6 of 16

the majority consensus of the RIP-affected long nonrDNA array repeats both had similar levels of homology
to the rDNA array (Table 2).
Determining the role and origin of RIP-degraded repeats
in S. nodorum

The deRIP process was extended to all repeat families of
S. nodorum SN15 (Additional files 2, 3, 4). Table 3 summarises the copy number and size of repeat families as
estimated previously [19,20]. The extent to which repeat
families were affected by RIP is indicated by the RIP
dominance scores. RIP dominance [20] was calculated
using a variety of comparative models including:
sequence of highest G:C content; alignment majority
consensus and; consensus sequence predicted by deRIP
(Additional file 5). A RIP dominance of greater than 0.6
by comparison to the repeat with highest G:C content
was considered a reliable threshold for RIP [20].
DeRIP consensus-generated RIP dominances correlated with the highest G:C content RIP dominance
scores better (correlation coefficient = 0.88) than those
of the majority consensus (0.85). This supports the reliability of the deRIP consensus as an accurate prediction
of the pre-RIP-mutated progenitor sequence.
Table 3 also lists Blast hits to the NCBI NR and GIRI
Repbase. The number of hits of the majority consensus
is compared to those of the deRIP consensus sequence.
Similarly, the number of hits of either sequence to
Repbase is also reported. The deRIP improvement factor
used the ratio of highest bit scores of the deRIP and
majority sequences to either NR by blastx or Repbase by
tblastx respectively. An improvement factor can only be
calculated if both consensus sequences have hits above
the thresholds (see methods).
In the great majority of cases the number of hits of the
deRIP consensus matched or exceeded the number
achieved by the majority consensus sequences (Table 3).
In two cases, (X35, X0 to NR) the deRIP sequence found
a hit where none had been found before (Table 4). In
other cases, very substantial increases in hit number were
observed (R8, R9 to NR; R9 to Repbase). In a few cases
the number of hits was reduced (X12, R37 and R51 by
NR; R10, Pixie, R31 and R37 by Repbase).
The deRIP improvement factor was greater than one
in all cases for NR and in all but two case for Repbase
indicating a general increase in the confidence and significance of a hit and hence a functional assignment.
The factor ranged up to 3.78 for NR and up to 2.18 for
Repbase hits (Table 3). In two cases (R25 and X23) the
factor with Repbase was less than 1. This can occur if
the hit present in the reference database had been submitted in its non-functional, RIP-affected form.
Blast information was used to determine the origin of
several RIP-degraded repeat families of S. nodorum

RIP dominance, a measure of the strength of RIP mutation, is reported for all 3 different RIPCAL comparison methods: versus the highest G:C content sequence;
versus the alignment ‘majority’ consensus and; versus the deRIP consensus. Measures of how much the predicted deRIP consensus of a repeat family resembles
its original version, hit discovery scores and deRIP improvement factors, are also summarised for comparisons against NCBI NR Proteins via blastx and the GIRI
Repbase database of repetitive elements via tblastx.

SN15. Previously the probable origin of 17 out of 26
repeat families had been identified. However after deRIP
had been applied to each repeat family, 23 out of 25
have now been categorised. In six cases (R10, R31, R39,
R51, X23 and X36) no previous homology information
had been available. Repeat families R31, R39, R51, X23
and X36 were re-classified as transposons after deRIP
analysis (Table 4). The repeat family R10, also
previously unknown, was identified as corresponding
to S. nodorum genes SNOG_15997, SNOG_11270 and
SNOG_16585 [NCBI: EAT76576.1, EAT81769.1,
EAT76052.1].
The previous classification of X15 as a Gypsy class
transposon remnant was confirmed after deRIP. The
deRIP improvement factors for Gypsy sequences were
1.45 and 1.66 for NR Proteins and Repbase sequences
respectively (Table 4). X26, previously predicted to

be a transposon remnant, was found after deRIP to
contain regions corresponding to a telomere-associated RecQ helicase (Table 4). R25 was previously
classified as a putative transposon remnant. After
deRIP, some weak homology to DNA transposons
was detected versus Repbase but a region of homology to histone H3 proteins was also detected (Table
4). Repeat family R25 was thus re-classified as originating from a (presumably) endogenous gene-encoding region.
R8 and X3 were previously predicted to contain the
remnants of an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and helicase genes respectively [19,20]. DeRIP analysis was used
to predict the ancestral sequence and identified matches
to nine copies of a cluster of endogenous S. nodorum
genes (Additional file 3). Analysis of repeats X3 and R8
indicated that several copies of these repeat families

After deRIP analysis the predicted origin of 8 repeat families has been altered from that described in Hane & Oliver (2008) [20]. Details of the blast hits which
were most informative in re-classifying a repeat family are listed below. E-values are shown for matches to both the majority and deRIP consensus sequences.
DeRIP improvement is a measure of how much better the deRIP consensus matched the hit compared to the majority consensus. DeRIP improvement > 1
indicates that the repeat family was derived from the hit or a related homolog, but was subsequently mutated by RIP.

Figure 3 Nine copies of the repeat X3X3R8 contain predicted gene annotations in the S. nodorum genome. Blast analysis of the deRIP
consensus sequence led to the hypothesis that 3 helicase genes, an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and 2 unknown genes originally occupied
this region. The effects of RIP mutation have led to the disruption of open-reading frames in several of these genes resulting in multiple, shortlength gene predictions which are highly likely to be pseudogenes.

were physically adjacent (Additional file 3). Studying the
location of X3 and R8 repeats revealed that these
repeats were frequently arranged in a distinctive pattern
roughly corresponding to two tandem X3 repeats followed by a reversed R8 repeat (Figure 3, Figure S# 4).
These two repeat classes were combined and renamed
X3X3R8.

In addition to the cluster of endogenous genes, the
X3X3R8 deRIP consensus also hit known ubiquitin conjugating enzymes with greater homology than the
majority consensus (Table 4). Homology relationships to
DNA excision/repair helicase regions were inferred from
hits to the endogenous S. nodorum genes residing within
X3X3R8 (Additional file 2).

Hane and Oliver BMC Genomics 2010, 11:655
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/655

Since the deRIP consensus is a prediction of the
sequence prior to RIP-mutation it can be presumed that
the X3X3R8 repeats with functional genes are closely
related to the deRIP consensus. The majority of repeats
with predicted gene annotations were found to be highly
similar to the deRIP consensus (Figure 4, green circles).
Current evidence supports the functionality of some or
all of the genes contained in six out of these nine
X3X3R8 repeats.

Discussion
The deRIP algorithm was designed to reverse the affect
of RIP upon repeat families in-silico and thereby help
determine the evolutionary history of repeated elements.
The process automates the selective alteration of bases
within a consensus according to a set of rules that can
be determined by considering the RIP machinery operating in the organism concerned. Despite its validation
with known non-RIP-affected sequences, deRIP has
some limitations and will not necessarily perfectly predict the ancestral sequence. DeRIP can only choose
within options provided by the aligned set of repeats. In
the example given in Figure 2 the TpA sequence at
position 1900-1901 was converted to TpG. To do this,
at least one of the copies of the repeat must have the
presumably ancestral di-nucleotide TpG at this site. If
all extant copies had been mutated, the reversion would
have no support. The deRIP process is therefore critically dependent on the degree of RIP within a repeat.
The success of deRIP is also dependent upon the accuracy of the alignment. A noteworthy aside is that default
alignment parameters often fail to align fungal repeats
correctly due to complex internal repeat structures.
Finally, the diagnostic metrics of deRIP success, deRIP
improvement and hit discovery, are only possible to calculate if appropriate matching sequences exist in the
queried databases. If a repeat sequence is truly novel, its
“homology” cannot be improved until homologs are
found.
RIPCAL uses a model sequence to compare to aligned
repeats for RIP-like polymorphism. Selecting the repeat
with the highest total count of G and C nucleotides
assumes that high G:C content is representative of the
least RIP-affected repeat. The majority consensus model
on the other hand could be representative of the least
or most RIP-affected repeat depending on the level of
RIP mutation within the repeat family. Previously, we
had selected the sequence with the highest G:C content
as the RIPCAL model [20]. While in most cases this
rationale is sound, the G:C model has several shortcomings. If a sequence with the highest total G:C content
does not span the full length of its alignment, RIP data
from the un-covered regions would be lost. Alternatively, a repeat longer than the least RIP-affected repeat

Page 12 of 16

(e.g. resulting from a large sequence insertion into a
RIP-affected repeat) may have higher total G:C content
merely due to its greater length. The G:C model is also
sensitive to variations in G:C content not related to
RIP. Furthermore, RIP occurs between multiple combinations of repeats over time. The G:C model sequence
therefore comprises of an amalgam of pre-RIP
and post-RIP di-nucleotides relative to the alignment as
a whole.
RIP mutations have directionality (Table 1), so the
combination of pre- and post-RIP sites makes it necessary to consider RIP mutation both towards and away
from the G:C model sequence. In contrast, a deRIP consensus model, being a prediction of the pre-RIP-mutated
sequence, has the advantage of polarity. As such, deRIP
mutation calculations can be restricted to one direction:
proceeding from the deRIP consensus to the RIPaffected repeat.
The prior isolation of active copies of three transposons, Molly Pixie and Elsa, as well as the differential
effect of RIP on the rDNA repeats, allowed a thorough
test of the power of deRIP to reconstruct the ancestral
sequence. In all four examples the predicted deRIP consensus of the RIP-affected sequences was the best match
to the active copy indicating that deRIP was able to
accurately revert the RIP-degraded repeats close to their
original states. These analyses helped define the concepts of hit discovery number and deRIP improvements
as applied more broadly in Table 3.
The deRIP process serves to highlight the effectiveness
of RIP as a transposon-silencing mechanism. In most
observed cases, the resemblance between RIP-degraded
repeats and their non-RIP-affected, functional counterparts is minimal (Additional file 1). In the case of the
Molly, Elsa and Pixie transposons, functional sequences
of transposon proteins were available for comparison.
No viable open-reading frames could be found in any of
their respective genomic matches in S. nodorum SN15
(Additional file 1). Some repeat families could not even
be classified by homology prior to deRIP (Table 4). The
deRIP process is therefore an essential tool which facilitates the identification and understanding of the role
and origin of fungal repetitive DNA. The effectiveness
of deRIP was such that functional assignments were
improved quantitatively or qualitatively in nearly all
cases. This was most clearly the case when repeat
families were most clearly affected by RIP (Table 3,
Table 4).
Conversely when the repeat family was not RIPaffected, the deRIP process was not able to improve the
homology assignment. An example is the transposon
repeat family R37 which had low RIP dominance (by
majority consensus) of 0.25, indicating that R37 is not
greatly affected by RIP mutation.

The R10 repeat contained regions corresponding to
three S. nodorum genes (SNOG_15997, SNOG_11270
and SNOG_16585 [NCBI: EAT76576.1, EAT81769.1,
EAT76052.1]) (Table 4) which are located in separate
regions of the genome assembly. The sub-telomeric
repeat X26, which contained telomere-associated RecQ
helicase sequence and was subject to relatively high
levels of RIP mutation (Table 3). RecQ helicase plays a
critical role in genome maintenance and is essential for
DNA replication in eukaryotes [41]. Twenty six putative
functional copies (i.e annotated gene models) of RecQ
are present within the S. nodorum genome (Additional
file 6). It is currently unclear by what mechanism function is preserved in certain copies of this highly repeated
gene family, but not in others.
The repeat family X3X3R8, which replaced the
previously defined repeat families X3 and R8, matched
to a cluster of endogenous S. nodorum SN15 genes
(Table 4) - some of these coding for a DNA repair helicase and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (Figure 3). The
helicase and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme genes within
X3X3R8 were homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae
proteins Rad5 [SGD: YLR032W] and Rad6 [SGD:
YGL058W] respectively (Additional file 2). These
proteins are involved in the post-replication repair of
UV-damaged DNA, the epigenetic silencing of telomeres
and sporulation in yeast [42-44].
The absence of active copies of the Elsa, Molly and
Pixie families in the Australian SN15 isolate contrasts
with the situation in the UK. Rawson screened several
isolates for active transposons and used a trapping process to isolate active copies [35]. Using these transposons as probes showed great variation in copy number
and band intensity amongst a collection of UK isolates.
We have only looked at one Australian isolate, but it
appears to be devoid of active transposons (Additional
file 1). Consideration of the properties of RIP, the need
for sexual reproduction by the fungus in Mediterranean
climates and the biogeography of S. nodorum, could
explain the absence of transposons in the Australian isolate. Repeated elements over a threshold size and above
a threshold identity would be subject to RIP. This would
inactivate all copies of a transposon during a meiotic
event that appears to be necessary for survival over the
hot summer [30]. It would not be conceivable for an
active copy to be reconstituted in an asexual population
derived from such an event. The survival of a transposon in a population of a sexually reproducing fungus
would require mating with an isolate with an active
(and presumably single) copy of the transposon. The
invasion of S. nodorum into Australia most likely
occurred via the propagation of a small founder population consistent with the reduced polymorphism of populations found here [33]. We speculate that no active

Page 14 of 16

transposons have survived within any Australian isolate
capable of RIP. Screening of a larger population of Australian and Eurasian isolates to determine differences in
frequency and distribution of active copies between the
founder and derived populations would be required to
confirm this.

Conclusions
In summary, we present a facile and rapid method to
assist the annotation of repetitive elements of ascomycete genomes. The deRIP process can predict ancestral
functional sequence from degraded repeat elements.
Analysis of the repeat families of the fungal phytopathogen Stagonospora nodorum (strain SN15) using
deRIP-converted sequences increased the number of
recognisable repeat families from 65% (17/26) to 92%
(23/25). This has enabled the characterization of many
repeat families and has advanced our progress towards
the goal of understanding and accounting for the evolutionary history of all regions of a genome.
Methods
Analysis of RIP-mutation of S. nodorum repetitive DNA

The 26 distinct repeat families of S. nodorum SN15 [19]
were analysed for RIP mutation using RIPCAL [20].
RIPCAL requires an appropriate model sequence, which
is a template to which all other aligned sequences of the
repeat family are compared for RIP-like polymorphism.
Previously we used the sequence of highest total G:C
content as the model sequence. As RIP irreversibly converts G:C nucleotide pairs to A:T, it was assumed that
the sequence with the highest G:C content was the least
RIP-affected repeat in the family. In this study, we have
performed RIPCAL analyses using 3 different models:
highest G:C content, alignment majority consensus and
predicted sequence of the repeat family prior to RIPmutation.
Predicting the original repeat sequence prior to
RIP-degradation

The deRIP process predicts the sequence of the preRIP-mutated version of the repeat alignment. Firstly, the
majority consensus was generated by counting the
nucleotide frequency at each position of the repeat
alignment. The majority consensus sequence was determined by the highest frequency nucleotide. Secondly,
at each position of the multiple alignment, counts
of di-nucleotides exhibiting RIP-like polymorphism
(CpN ® TpN) were calculated (Table 1). A RIP mutation with the highest corresponding di-nucleotide count
was presumed to be dominant and therefore the majority consensus was converted to the appropriate pre-RIP
di-nucleotide sequence. This predicted sequence is
henceforth referred to as the ‘deRIP consensus’.

Validating the deRIP technique

The sequences of the active copies (which are presumably non-RIP-degraded) of the S. nodorum transposon
repeats Molly, Pixie and Elsa [NCBI; AJ277966,
AJ488502, AJ488503] [35] were compared to their
respective majority and deRIP consensus sequences
from strain SN15 via blastn [45]. Majority and deRIP
consensus sequences of these repeat families were also
globally aligned against their respective active copy via
needle [40]. The SN15 rDNA repeat (Y1) was previously
shown to be differentially susceptible to RIP [20]. The
majority consensus of the non-RIP-affected copies of Y1
were compared to the majority and deRIP consensus
sequences of the RIP-susceptible copies as above. The
relative difference in alignment bit scores between
majority and deRIP consensus sequences with their
respective active copies was used to measure the degree
of ‘improvement’ of the deRIP consensus over the
majority consensus:
Bit score of best HSP (deRIP consensus)
S
Bit score of best HSP (majority consensus)

A ‘deRIP improvement factor’ greater than 1 indicated
that the deRIP process had modified the RIP-affected
sequence to resemble the sequence of the active copy.

Supplementary Figure, PNG format. The previously predicted X3 and R8
repeat families (HANE and OLIVER 2008) were found to correspond to
genomic regions in a distinctive repeated pattern which spanned 26 kB.
This region was classified as a new repeat family, X3X3R8, which
supersedes the old repeat families R8 and X3. The MUMMER dot-plot
above illustrates how the nucleotide majority consensus sequences of R8
and X3 relate to X3X3R8. The first third of the X3X3R8 majority
consensus corresponds to a full length copy of X3. The second third of
X3X3R8 is comprised of a second, incomplete copy of X3 which in
matching regions is 10-20% divergent from the X3 consensus. The final
third corresponds to a complete copy of the R8 repeat, in the reverse
orientation with respect to its previously defined sequence.

Predicting the origin of RIP-degraded repeats

Majority and deRIP consensus sequences were compared to the NCBI NR protein database via blastx
[45] and to the GIRI Repbase database of repetitive
DNA [46] via tblastx. The results of these comparisons were used to infer repeat family origin and function. In this analysis, NCBI and Repbase sequences
were both assumed to represent active transposons.
Stronger deRIP matches to either database indicated
that the deRIP algorithm was able to convert a RIPinactivated sequence back into that of an active transposon. A maximum e-value threshold of 10 was
imposed on hits against both the majority or deRIP
consensus, with one of these also required to be less
than 1e-3. DeRIP improvement factors were calculated for each hit as above. However for the purpose
of summarising this data in Table 3, the maximum
value was reported for each respective repeat family.
‘Hit discovery scores’ are the number of hits that the
deRIP or majority consensus sequences have to the
NR or GIRI databases. The scores illustrate the extent
to which the deRIP process was able to discover new
homology relationships that were previously lost due
to RIP.
