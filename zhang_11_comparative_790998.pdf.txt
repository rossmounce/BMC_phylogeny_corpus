Abstract
Background: Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. Serotypes 1,
2, 3, 7, 9, 14 and 1/2 are the most prevalent serotypes of this pathogen. However, almost all studies were carried
out on serotype 2 strains. Therefore, characterization of genomic features of other serotypes will be required to
better understand their virulence potential and phylogenetic relationships among different serotypes.
Results: Four Chinese S. suis strains belonging to serotypes 1, 7, 9 and 1/2 were sequenced using a rapid, highthroughput approach. Based on the 13 corresponding serotype strains, including 9 previously completed genomes
of this bacterium, a full comparative genomic analysis was performed. The results provide evidence that (i) the
pan-genome of this species is open and the size increases with addition of new sequenced genomes, (ii) strains of
serotypes 1, 3, 7 and 9 are phylogenetically distinct from serotype 2 strains, but all serotype 2 strains, plus the
serotype 1/2 and 14 strains, are very closely related. (iii) all these strains, except for the serotype 1 strain, could
harbor a recombinant site for a pathogenic island (89 K) mediated by conjugal transfer, and may have the ability
to gain the 89 K sequence.
Conclusions: There is significant genomic diversity among different strains in S. suis, and the gain and loss of large
amount of genes are involved in shaping their genomes. This is indicated by (i) pairwise gene content
comparisons between every pair of these strains, (ii) the open pan-genome of this species, (iii) the observed indels,
invertions and rearrangements in the collinearity analysis. Phylogenetic relationships may be associated with
serotype, as serotype 2 strains are closely related and distinct from other serotypes like 1, 3, 7 and 9, but more
strains need to be sequenced to confirm this.

Background
Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major swine pathogen
responsible for severe economic losses in the pork
industry and is emerging as an important threat to
human health, especially to people who have close contact with swine or pork by-products [1-3]. Since the first
reported case of human meningitis caused by S. suis in
Denmark in 1968, cases of infection have been reported

continuously in more than 20 countries, with more than
700 people being affected [4]. Two recent large-scale
outbreaks of human S. suis infections in China (one
associated with 25 cases and 14 deaths in Jiangsu in
1998 and the other with 204 cases and 38 deaths in
Sichuan in 2005) have raised awareness of the existing
threat to public health [5-9]. The infection has also
caused sporadic human illness in other countries,
including Thailand [10-12], the United Kingdom [13],
Portugal [14], Italy [15], Japan [16], Australia [17], the
Netherlands [18] and the United States [19-22].
S. suis is an encapsulated Gram-positive coccus that
possesses cell wall antigenic determinants, similar to
Lancefield group D [23]. Among the 33 serotypes that
have been classified based on the composition of their

capsular polysaccharides (CPS), only a limited number
are responsible for infections in pigs, including serotypes
1-9 and 14 [24]. Although the distribution of different
serotypes varies depending on the geographical origins
of the strains, S. suis serotype 2 (SS2) is considered the
most pathogenic and the most prevalent capsular type
among diseased pigs, followed by serotypes 3 and 1/2
[25,26]. Serotypes 1, 7 and 9 are also prevalent in several
European [27,28] and Asian countries [26]. Serotype 14
infections in humans are now being reported with
increasing frequency [29,30]. However, little information
about these prevalent serotypes is available, except for
serotype 2. Comparative genomic analysis is a powerful
method for exploring the relationships between genotypes and phenotypes and for discovering genetic markers for clinical purposes.
A previous comparative genomic study based on
examination of an intermediately pathogenic strain (89/
1591), a highly pathogenic strain (GZ1) and an epidemic
strain (SC84) indicates that acquiring particular genomic
islands is essential for the evolution of highly pathogenic
bacteria [9], and a specific pathogenic island (89 K) is
found to be an essential component of virulent Chinese
SS2 isolates [31,32]. A recent study indicates that the
pathogenic island (89 K) can exhibit spontaneous excision to form an extrachromosomal circular product,
which can then undergo lateral transfer to a recipient
strain through site-specific recombination [33]. To
understand the evolution of virulence in other prevalent
serotypes, it is important to know whether they could
also harbor recombinant target sites and serve as recipients for exogenous sequences.
In this study, we sequenced the genomes of 4 prevalent S. suis serotypes: 1, 1/2, 7 and 9. By taking the publicly available complete genome sequences of serotypes
2, 3 and 14 as the reference, a comparative genomic
analysis was performed to provide a global genomic
characterization of this prevalent pathogenic bacterium.
Acquisitions and losses of genome components were
identified, and different genes involved in CPS biosynthesis were found to be serotype determinants. The study
also indicated that serotypes 1/2, 2, 3, 7 and 9, but not
serotype 1, could supply a recombinant site for a pathogenic island (89 K) mediated by conjugal transfer, which
suggests that these serotypes are able to obtain the 89 K
sequence and thus become more virulent.

Results and Discussion
General features of the sequenced genomes

Among the 33 known serotypes, serotypes 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
and 1/2 are the most prevalent in pigs, and the strains
causing human infections were also found among these
serotypes [24-28]. Although 8 genome sequences of
strains from serotype 2 were available, there was little

information about the other serotypes, except for our
recently updated genome sequences for serotypes 3 [34]
and 14 [35]. In this study, whole genome sequencing
was performed on 4 prevalent Chinese S. suis strains
belonging to serotypes 1, 7, 9 and 1/2. Each of the 4
genomes was sequenced to a high level of redundancy
(sequencing depth was 722 to 1627 fold). We filtered
low-quality reads and used only high-quality reads for
assembly. Reads for each genome were assembled into
scaffolds, with 26 to 94 large scaffolds (>500bp) obtained
per genome. Then scaffolds were aligned to the published genomes of S. suis to obtain linkage information
for gap closure. All 4 annotated complete genomes were
deposited in GenBank.
Every genome consisted of a single circular chromosome with an approximate size of 2 Mb (Figure 1). Genome and assembly statistics for each strain were
summarized in Table 1. The number of predicted ORFs
for the 4 sequenced genomes was ranged from 2030 to
2136, and approximately 71% of the ORFs was assigned
biological functions. The average gene length varied
among different strains and was related to the number
of pseudogenes and truncated genes presented. The genome of strain D9 (serotype 7) carried the greatest number of disrupted genes (126, or 5.9%), and conversely,
SS12 (serotype 1/2) carried the lowest number (63,
3.0%) (Additional file 1). The average GC content was
41.2%, which was consistent with previous studies
[8,31], and the genomic regions exhibiting an aberrant
GC content may be the sites of horizontal gene transfer
in different strains. Additionally, several IS elements
were identified, and the number of IS elements was
found to be similar to that of previously sequenced
strains, such as P1/7, SC84 and BM407.
Identification of gene clusters

All CDSs from the 13 completely sequenced S. suis genomes used for clustering were available in multi-FASTA
format in the Supplemental Material (Additional file 2).
There were 2374 S. suis orthologous gene clusters and
1211 unique genes, and the observed pan-genome
shared by the 13 strains consisted of 3585 genes. The
core genome of these strains comprised 1343 genes,
accounting for 66.5% of total CDSs, and 28.9% of the
genes were “dispensable” because they were shared by at
least 2 strains, but not by all. All of the unique genes
from these genomes only accounted for 4.6% of genes,
but the percentage in each strain varied considerably
(Figure 2). Non-core genes, including both dispensable
genes and unique genes, usually play roles in nonessential metabolism and are more associated with virulence,
environmental adaptation or serotype determination
than core genes. Strain D9 possessed the highest proportion of non-core genes (38.6%), and strain P1/7 had

minimum was 88, identified between strains P1/7 and
SC84. A COG functional classification for core and
non-core genes was performed, and the results showed
that non-core genes were most likely to be assigned to
categories, such as carbohydrate transport and metabolism, replication, recombination and repair, whereas
core genes were more often associated with translation
and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (Figure 3).

levels of gene gain and loss during the evolution of
these strains or serotypes. Pairwise gene content comparisons among the 13 genomes indicated that the number of genes involved in gain and loss events between
the strains was 587 on average. The largest number of
gene difference between the strains was 1090, which was

Core and pan-genome analysis of S. suis
S. suis core genome

To determine the core genome of S. suis, the number of
conserved genes found upon sequential addition of each
new genome was extrapolated by fitting a decaying
function that was considered to provide the best fit to
the dataset (Figure 4A). Although the number of core
genes initially decreased with the addition of each new
genome, the core genome appeared to reach a plateau
at approximately 1126 genes for S. suis species. The
core gene number in each genome varied slightly

different levels of conservation according to the number of strains. Noncore genes present in 12 strains were considered the most conserved,
whereas strain specific genes were the least conserved. Different conservations are represented by various colors.

paralogs in the shared clusters.
S. suis pan-genome analysis

To determine whether the S. suis pan-genome was open,
the number of new genes (unique genes) was calculated
every time a new genome was incorporated. As

expected, the observed numbers varied greatly, as shown
in Figure 4B. The large deviation from the mean suggested high levels of variation within S. suis. The mean
values of new genes were used to perform the extrapolation. Similar to the core genes, the plot of new genes
was fit well by a decaying function, and remarkably, the

to increase because the pan-genome of S. suis is open.

extrapolated curve reached an asymptotic value of 82,
which meant that every newly sequenced genome could
bring 82 new genes on average, even if many genomes
were sequenced. This finding revealed that the species
possesses an open pan-genome for which the size
increases with the addition of new sequenced strains
(Figure 4C). This was consistent with a previous study
on the core and pan-genome of Streptococcus, which
indicated that S. suis was the lineage with the largest
number of gene gains and losses [36].
Phylogenetic relationships among different serotype
strains

We used two methods to investigate the phylogenetic
relationships among different serotypes, one of which
was based on gene presence or absence among different
strains, while the other one utilized the concatenated
sequence of all single-copy core genes with exactly identical lengths from the 13 complete genomes. Figure 5A
displays the phylogenetic relationships among the different strains based on the large sequence alignment of 522
core genes with the same length in each cluster. With the
exception of serotype 14 strain JS14 and serotype 1/2
strain SS12, the non-serotype 2 strains appeared to be
phylogenetically distinct from the serotype 2 strains, and
could be assigned to a common clade. In this clade, serotype 7 strain D9 and serotype 3 strain ST3 were more
closely related than any other pair. All serotype 2 strains
presented an extremely short evolutionary distance from
each other, indicating that these strains were probably
derived from a recent common ancestor. It can also be
inferred that phylogenetically serotype 1/2 and serotype
14 may be more closely related to the serotype 2 strains
than the other 4 serotypes. However, to confirm this,
more strains of other serotypes need to be sequenced.
Figure 5B shows that the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair
Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) phylogenetic tree
reflect the number of gene gains and losses between all
pairs of the 13 strains. The topologies of the MrBayes
tree and the UPGMA tree bore some similarities. The 4
strains from serotypes 1, 3, 7 and 9 were also included in
a common branch and differed greatly from the serotype
2 strains, whereas the serotype 1/2 and 14 strains were
grouped into the same clade with A7 and GZ1 from serotype 2. The main difference between the two trees was
that the two Chinese isolates, 05ZYH33 and 98HAH33,
were more evolutionarily distant from the other serotype
2 strains indicated in the UPGMA tree.
Genomic arrangement of S. suis strains

A global multi-genome alignment of all 13 complete
genomes was performed, and the results showed that
some rearrangement occurred (Figure 6). These genomes could be classified into 3 categories according to

their collinearity. All serotype 2 strains except for
BM407, as well as the serotype 14 strain JS14 and serotype 1/2 strain SS12, were quite similar with respect to
genome structure, with the exception of some small
insertions. The genomes of BM407, D12 and ST1 shared
a similar synteny with each other, and they displayed a
large inversion when compared to that of other serotype
2 strains. The D9 and ST3 genomes were collinear
along their length, with the exception of an insertion in
the D9 genome. This is interesting because these synteny types were similar to some extent to the phylogenetic relationships seen among these strains.
Genes involved in CPS biosynthesis

S. suis is surrounded by a capsule that has been shown
to be essential for its virulence [37,38]. It has been

default parameters, and the collinearity of the genomes is shown. Sequence alignments that are free of rearrangements are shown as colored

demonstrated that the presence of the capsule can
decrease the activation of the PI-3K/Akt/PKCa signaling
pathway involved in phagocytosis processes [39] and
allows the bacterium to escape being killed by both
macrophages and neutrophils [37,38,40]. The antigenic
properties of capsular polysaccharides are the basis for
serotype characterization. Only the structure of the serotype 2 capsular polysaccharide had previously been
determined, and the genes involved in the biosynthesis
of capsular polysaccharides had been found to be clustered in a single locus [41]. Orf2Y and Orf2Z are located
upstream of the operon and may be involved in the regulation of these cps genes. Most of the serotypes include

these two genes, as determined by hybrid assays [27],
and the genome sequences indicate that these genes
share very high sequence similarity. At the cps locus,
the orfX and cpsA to cpsD genes could be hybridized in
most serotypes [27], and these genes presented in all
sequenced serotypes strains and highly conserved, indicating that they were involved in common functions
related to the biosynthesis of the capsular polysaccharides, such as regulation, chain length determination and
export, which were the functions of the homologous
genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae [38]. The other 7
genes at the locus may be responsible for its specific
CPS structure (Figure 7). The agglutination test

Figure 7 Schematic comparison of the genetic organization of the CPS biosynthesis clusters in strains from different serotypes.
Among the serotype 2 strains, only S. suis SC84 is chosen for comparison, as the organization of the cps clusters among strains of this serotype
is similar. The genomes of strains ST1 and D12 are inverted to provide a clear view, and the cps clusters included in them are on the negative

indicated that the serotype 1/2 strains could react with
hyperimmune sera against serotype 1 and serotype 2,
and the sequenced genes encoding the CPS biosynthetic
enzymes of serotype 1/2 showed high uniformity compared to serotype 2, suggesting that the modifications of
the cps of serotype 1/2 were similar to those of serotype
1. Corresponding to the findings of a previous report
[27], the genes coding for the CPS biosynthetic enzymes
of serotypes 1 and 14 were highly conserved, indicating
that the determinants for both serotypes include not
only CPS structure, but also the modifications of polysaccharides (Figure 7).
The prevalent serotypes supply a potential recombinant
site for a pathogenic island (89 K)

The two large-scale outbreaks in China in 1998 and
2005 prompted researchers to determine which changes
in the S. suis genome make it so highly virulent. Using
comparative genomic analysis, an 89-kb sequence was
identified only in the Chinese epidemic strain [31]. The
subsequent investigation indicated that the 89-kb represented a GI-type T4SS-mediated horizontal transfer of a
pathogenicity island that could be transferred to the
recipient strain through a 15-bp sequence specific
recombination event, although the transfer could be successfully observed only to serotype 2 [33]. Because the
89-kb harbored necessary elements for horizontal transfer, such as integrase, excisionase, DNA relaxase and so

on, suggesting that this pathogenicity island maintained
the potential to transfer to the recipient strain harboring
the 15-bp sequence. The Genomic analysis indicated
that the pathogenicity island did not exist in the other
sequenced prevalent serotypes and such a 15-bp
sequence could be found in the genomes of sequenced
serotypes 1/2, 2, 3, 7 and 9, but not in serotype 1. More
surprisingly, the flanking sequence structure of the 89 K
region in the epidemic strain SC84 showed high similarity with the other sequenced serotypes, suggesting that
these prevalent serotypes harboring the site for homologous recombination (the 15-bp sequence) would have
the potential to act as recipient strains for the pathogenic island from the epidemic strain.

Conclusion
In summary, comparative genomic analysis using genome sequences originating from prevalent S. suis serotypes showed that the observed pan genome of S. suis
consists of 3585 gene clusters composed of 1343 core
genome genes, 1031 distributed genes and 1211 strainspecific genes. The species possesses an open pan-genome and is the Streptococcus lineage with the greatest
number of gene gains and losses. The results of this
study also indicate that the other serotypes could supply
a recombinant site for a pathogenic island (89 K)
mediated by conjugal transfer, which suggests that these
serotypes have the potential to obtain an 89 K sequence,

PCR products. Possible misassemblies were corrected
using PCR amplification and direct sequencing.
Sequences were edited in Consed [43].

Methods

Genome annotation

Bacterial strains

Initially, Open Reading Frame (ORF) prediction was
performed using Glimmer3 [44] and Genemarks [45],
and the results were amalgamated. To avoid possible
missing coding sequences, entire DNA sequences
were compared to all known protein sequences from
other published S. suis strains using BLAST searches.
Then, all predicted ORFs were translated into amino
acid sequences and compared against the non-redundant protein (nr) database using the BLASTp program, with a maximum expectation value of 1 × 10-6.
ORFs with no BLAST hit to any other protein were
automatically annotated as “hypothetical proteins.”
tRNAs and rRNAs were identified using tRNAscan-SE
[46] and RNAmmer1.2 [47], respectively. Insertion
sequence (IS) elements were found with IS Finder
[48]. Genome islands (GIs) were identified using
IslandViewer [49], which integrates three different
genomic island prediction methods, followed by manual inspection.
The four annotated complete genome sequences have
been deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers
CP002640 (SS12), CP002641 (D9), CP002644 (D12) and
CP002651 (ST1).

Four Chinese isolated S. suis strains from the prevalent
serotypes 1, 1/2, 7 and 9 were sequenced in this study.
The characteristics of the sequenced strains and the
publicly available genomes used for comparison are
summarized in Table 2. The strains were maintained on
tryptic soy agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit) plus 10%
bovine blood or cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth medium
(Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) plus 10% bovine blood to
mid-log phase (OD at 600 nm of 0.4) at 37°C under
aerobic conditions. Total genomic DNA was extracted
using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany).
Sequencing and assembly

Bacterial genomes were sequenced at the Beijing Institute of Genomics (China) using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy and Illumina Genome Analyzer
sequencing technology. For each sample, a paired-end
sequencing library containing fragments of approximate
500 bp was constructed. The short reads were filtered
for quality and assembled with SOAPdenovo (http://
soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html). To fill the
intra-scaffolds gaps, we used paired-end information to
retrieve read pairs that had one read that was aligned to
the contigs and another read that was located in the gap
region. With this information, we did a local assembly
for the collected reads. Then, these scaffolds were
ordered relative to the genome of S. suis strain
05ZYH33 (deposited in the NCBI database; GenBank
accession number CP000407) using MUMmer3 [42].
Gaps were closed by primer walking and sequencing of

Whole genome alignment and ortholog identification

Multiple genome alignments for 13 completely
sequenced strains were constructed and visualized using
the progressive Mauve program in Mauve v2.3.1 [50] at
default settings.
All CDSs were extracted from the 13 S. suis genomes,
and they were grouped into homologous clusters using

Core and pan-genome analysis

Authors’ contributions
MJ and JX conceived the study; AZ, PH and MY annotated genomes, and
performed analysis, AZ and PH wrote the manuscript; JW helped with the
genome analysis; YH and BC identified and characterized the strains. HC and
JY oversaw the genome sequencing and supervised the project. All authors
read and approved the final manuscript.

Tables of homologous clusters from InParanoid4 were
compiled for identifying shared and unique genes. The
numbers of conserved genes and unique genes depend
on how many strains are taken into account. Thirteen
strains with complete genome sequences were simulated
in all possible combinations. The sizes of the core genome and novel gene set were calculated for each combination and then extrapolated using several functions to
find a best fit from the mean number at each sampling
point [54].
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees of S. suis strains were constructed
using two different methods [55]. The first utilized multiple sequence alignments of 522 single-copy core genes
with nearly identical lengths and exactly one member in
each of the compared strains. The alignments of these
genes were concatenated into one large sequence alignment with a length of 457779 bp, and a phylogenetic
tree was reconstructed using MrBayes 3 [56,57] (200,000
generations, sampled every 100 generations with a
gamma distribution model and invariant class). The second method was based on the presence or absence of
genes in the pan-genome. Genetic distances were
defined as Σ n | gn, i - gn, k|, where gn, i is 1 if gene n is
present in strain i and is zero otherwise. A dendrogram
was generated using the UPGMA (unweighted pair
group method with arithmetic mean) method implemented in the Phylip package [58].
