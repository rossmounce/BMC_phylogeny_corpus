Gene expression suggests conserved aspects of
Hox gene regulation in arthropods and provides
additional support for monophyletic Myriapoda
Research

Ralf Janssen* and Graham E Budd

Abstract
Antisense transcripts of Ultrabithorax (aUbx) in the millipede Glomeris and the centipede Lithobius are expressed in
patterns complementary to that of the Ubx sense transcripts. A similar complementary expression pattern has been
described for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) of the bithoraxoid (bxd) locus in Drosophila, in which the transcription of bxd
ncRNAs represses Ubx via transcriptional interference. We discuss our findings in the context of possibly conserved
mechanisms of Ubx regulation in myriapods and the fly.
Bicistronic transcription of Ubx and Antennapedia (Antp) has been reported previously for a myriapod and a number of
crustaceans. In this paper, we show that Ubx/Antp bicistronic transcripts also occur in Glomeris and an onychophoran,
suggesting further conserved mechanisms of Hox gene regulation in arthropods.
Myriapod monophyly is supported by the expression of aUbx in all investigated myriapods, whereas in other arthropod
classes, including the Onychophora, aUbx is not expressed. Of the two splice variants of Ubx/Antp only one could be
isolated from myriapods, representing a possible further synapomorphy of the Myriapoda.
Background
The Hox genes are expressed in broad overlapping
domains along the anterior-posterior axis of developing
arthropods, and specify the segment identity under the
control of upstream acting segmentation genes [1,2]. In
Drosophila, the initially established expression patterns
of the Hox genes are maintained by the trithorax (trxG)
and Polycomb group (PcG) factors [3]. These factors act
through sets of response or maintenance elements (MEs),
the best investigated of which are involved in the regulation of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene [4,5]. A number of
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been reported for
Drosophila, which are transcribed through MEs in the
bithoraxoid (bxd) region located between Ubx and abdA. The ncRNAs including bxd are expressed in similar
patterns to those of the neighbouring Hox genes [6,7].
Although it was initially thought that bxd would activate
Ubx, a recent study suggests that transcription of ncRNAs promoted by Trithorax represses Ubx in cis by
means of transcriptional interference [4]. Elongated tran* Correspondence: ralf.janssen@geo.uu.se

scription of bxd-ncRNAs through the Ubx locus prevents
the transcription of the latter in the same cells. However,
in cells that do not express bxd Ubx is expressed [4]. The
expression patterns of bxd ncRNAs and Ubx are therefore
complementary in Drosophila.
In organisms other than Drosophila, the mechanisms
that regulate Ubx transcription are less well known. It is
unclear whether MEs or bxd are conserved or if transcription of bxd interferes with the transcription of Ubx
in a similar way to that in Drosophila. However, some evidence has recently accumulated suggesting that a similar
mechanism could be involved in the regulation of Ubx
outside Drosophila. Data from the beetle Tribolium show
that ncRNAs of the Ubx region are expressed in patterns
similar to those of the neighbouring Hox genes, resembling the observations in Drosophila [8]. In the centipede
Strigamia, the non-coding antisense transcript of Ubx is
expressed in a pattern complementary to that of the coding Ubx sense transcript, suggesting that bidirectional
transcription of a non-coding RNA, antisense Ubx, is also
involved in the regulation of Ubx in this myriapod [9].
In this paper, we present data from two distant myriapod relatives - the millipede Glomeris marginata and the

centipede Lithobius forficatus - which show conserved
expression of antisense Ubx (aUbx) in a pattern complementary to that of Ubx in Myriapoda. Data from species
of other arthropod groups and the onychophoran Euperipatoides kanangrensis reveal that aUbx expression does
not represent an ancestral feature but a synapomorphy of
the Myriapoda. The latter provides support for the still
controversially discussed idea that the Myriapoda form a
monophyletic group [10].
An mRNA that encodes a single protein, which
describes the typical case for eukaryotic genes, is termed
monocistronic, whereas mRNAs encoding two or several
proteins are termed bicistronic and polycistronic respectively. We show here that bicistronic transcripts of Ubx
and Antp (Ubx/Antp), as described for a number of crustaceans and the centipede Strigamia [9,11], also exist in
Glomeris and Euperipatoides. This finding suggests that
bicistronic transcription is an ancestral feature that is
likely to be involved also in arthropod Hox gene regulation by means of transcriptional interference and the
blockade of Antp translation.

Materials and methods
Species husbandry and embryo treatment

The general handling of G. marginata is described in
Janssen et al. [12]. The embryos were allowed to develop
at room temperature (22 to 25°C). The developmental
stage of the embryos was determined by 4'-6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAP) staining. Staging was performed as
described previously [12,13].
Specimens of L. forficatus were collected from a leaf litter stack in the backyard of the Evolutionary Biology Centre (EBC) in Uppsala/Sweden in spring (May/June).
Around 50 centipedes were held at room temperature in
a spacious plastic box filled with washed leaf litter (washing away small particles makes the later finding of the
eggs easier). The adults were fed with pieces of common
earthworms (Lumbricus) every few days. The often detritus-covered eggs were collected by hand and incubated in
plastic dishes on damp paper tissues until they reached
the desired developmental stage. Staging was performed
as described previously [14]. Generally, the handling was
carried out similarly to the method described for Lithobius atkinsoni [15].
Embryos of the spider Cupiennius salei, the onychophoran E. kanangrensis and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum were obtained and treated as
described previously ([16-18], respectively).

Ubx corresponding to the C-terminal end of the open
reading frame (ORF) (94 bp) and the beginning of the 3'
untranslated region (UTR) was isolated with gene-specific primers (Table 1). General Hox primers, as
described previously [19], were used to isolate a small
fragment of Ubx from Euperipatoides cDNA. An
extended fragment was subsequently obtained by 3'RACE.
A fragment of Lithobius forficatus Ubx was isolated
with gene-specific primers based on the published
sequence of Lithobius atkinsoni Ubx [15]. The isolated L.
forficatus fragment is only 221 bp long, but works well in
hybridization experiments.
Part of the bicistronic transcripts containing Ultrabithorax and Antennapedia (Ubx/Antp) were isolated
from the brine shrimp Artemia (first PCR), the onychophoran Euperipatoides and the millipede Glomeris.
The gene-specific primers used were directed against the
homeodomains of Ubx (forward primer) and Antp (backward primer). Gene-specific primers to amplify a possible
Tribolium Ubx/Antp transcript failed, even though we
used the primers (Table 1) in all possible combinations
including nested PCRs.
Sequences of the fragments were determined from both
strands by sequencing (Big Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit; Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) chemistry on an automatic analyser
(ABI3730XL; Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) by a
commercial sequencing service (Macrogen, Seoul,
Korea). Sequences are available in GenBank under the
accession numbers FN687748 (Gm-Ubx), FN687749
(Gm-Antp), FN687750 (Gm-Ubx/Antp_variant II),
FN687751 (Ek-Ubx), FN687752 (Ek-Ubx/Antp_variant I),
FN687753 (Ek-Ubx/Antp_variant II), FN687754 (Lf-Ubx)
and FN687755 (Af-Ubx/Antp_variant II).
In situ hybridization and nuclear staining

Whole-mount in situ hybridization for all species was
performed as described previously for Glomeris [20].
Double whole-mount in situ hybridization and cell nuclei
detection using DAPI was performed as described by
Janssen et al. [21]. Embryos were analyzed under a dissection microscope (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland)
equipped with a digital camera (Axiocam; Zeiss, Jena,
Germany) or a DC100 (Leica) digital camera. Brightness,
contrast and colour values were corrected in all images
using image processing software (Adobe Photoshop CS2.,
V.0.1 for Apple Macintosh; Adobe Systems Inc. San Jose,
CA, USA).

Gene cloning

Fragments of Ubx and Antp transcripts of G. marginata
were obtained via 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE)-PCR (Gene Racer RACE Kit; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). A fragment (383 bp) of Tribolium

except fushi-tarazu, only part of the homeodomain and 3'
UTR sequence was obtained. The published Ubx fragment neither ends in a poly-A tail nor has one of the typical polyadenylation sites and is therefore likely to be
incomplete. Recent 3'-RACE experiments demonstrated
the presence of additional 3' UTR transcript. The
extended fragment ends in a poly-A tail, but lacks an
obvious polyadenylation site close to this. The 3' UTR
region contains nine possible polyadenylation sites more
distant from the poly-A tail, allowing for the presence of
transcripts with different 3' UTR length. Whether the

recovered '3' UTR' sequence is a typical UTR that occurs
in the monocistronic transcript of Ubx or if is merely the
result of the bicistronic transcript of Ubx and Antp (see
following section) is unclear.
We recovered 5'-RACE fragments of Ubx and Antp.
The Ubx fragment represents the complete N-terminal
region of the ORF and 5' UTR sequence. The 5'-Antp
fragment is incomplete and does not include the N-terminal region of the protein coding sequence and the 5'
UTR. The fragments encode conserved motifs that are
characteristic for Ubx and Antp orthologs in arthropods

(Figure 1A). Note that the Glomeris ANTP protein lacks
the characteristic SQFE motif between the hexapeptide
and the homeodomain. Instead, this short peptide is
replaced by a single lysine (K) in Glomeris (Figure 1A).
The expression pattern of all newly recovered fragments
is identical to those described previously [19] (not
shown).
Bicistronic transcript of Ultrabithorax and Antennapedia

For Glomeris, we identified an Ubx/Antp bicistronic transcript that encodes the Ubx homeodomain C-terminal to
the upstream primer position and 38 bp of the Ubx 3'
UTR, which is directly adjacent to the complete N-terminal part of the Antp homeodomain up to the downstream
primer position (splice variant II; see below) (Figure
1B,B'). Whether the sequence C-terminal to this
sequence is part of the fusion transcript is unclear; however, the sequence N-terminal to the described short
fusion transcript has been independently recovered by 5'
RACE using gene specific primers (GSPs) against the
Antp homeodomain that amplified the Ubx/Antp fusion
transcript instead of the Antp 5' transcript. This sequence
is part of the Ubx transcript as proven by 5'-RACE PCR
for Ubx.
We also successfully isolated a splice version (splice
variant I) of Ubx/Antp bicistronic transcripts from an
onychophoran (Euperipatoides). This splice variant I is
also described for a number of several crustaceans
including the brine shrimp Artemia [11] (Figure 1B). For
Euperipatoides and Artemia, we also isolated the shorter
splice variant II of the bicistronic transcript described for
Strigamia [9] (Figure 1B,B'). A splice variant I is not
described for Strigamia and we could not isolate it from
Glomeris either. We failed to detect any Ubx/Antp bicistronic transcripts in the beetle Tribolium (Insecta).
Extension and nature of the Ubx antisense (aUbx) transcript

The information on aUbx transcription is based on
probes detecting the Ubx antisense strand during in situ
hybridization experiments (Figure 1C). It was thus necessary to unravel the true extension of the aUbx transcript
by in situ hybridization experiments with minimum size
probes (around 300 bp for Glomeris) detecting aUbx
complementary to the ends of the available Ubx fragments (Figure 1C). In all cases these sense probes
detected the aUbx expression pattern (described below)
suggesting their complete transcription. Whether the
aUbx transcript extends the Ubx transcript is unclear;
however, it does not extend into the transcripts of
abdominal-A (abd-A) or Antennapedia (Antp), because
in situ hybridization experiments with anti-abd-A and
anti-Antp probes did not detect any transcription. The
longest possible ORF of the aUbx transcript is 113aa long

and encodes a repetitive sequence of the type (LLLLR/
cSE) (Figure 1D).
Expression of aUbx

Transcripts of aUbx can already be detected at the blastoderm stage in a broad posterior domain (Figure 2A); at
stage 0.2, this expression intensifies (Figure 2B). At the
next stage (0.3) the centre of the initial broad domain is
cleared from the transcripts (Figure 2C). At stage 0.4, the
domain splits into an anterior stripe and a broad posterior domain (Figure 2D). The broad domain lies anterior
to the future proctodaeum; the anterior stripe covers the
intersegmental indentation between trunk segment two
(T2) and T3, and is thus located in the posterior part of
T2. At stage 1, the posterior domain has broadened and
its anterior and posterior margins show enhanced expression (Figure 2E). At stage 1.2, the complete T2 segment
expresses aUbx, although the expression in its anterior
part is weak (Figure 3A). The anterior margin of the former broad domain (Figure 2E) has now transformed into
an independent stripe in the posterior of T3 (Figure 3A).
The posterior-most expression is in the anal valves (AV).
Ventrally, the expression of aUbx is weaker than in its
corresponding lateral and dorsal tissue (Figure 3A). At
the subsequent stage (stage 2) three stripes of aUbx
expression are detectable: in the posterior areas of T1, T2
andT3 (Figure 3B). This expression is restricted to the
ventral tissue only for the stripes in T1 and the T3,
whereas the stripe in T2 extends into the dorsal tissue. All
stripes are discontinuous at the ventral midline. At
around stage 3, an additional stripe forms in the posterior
of T4 (Figure 3C). In subsequent stages (4 to 6), additional discontinuous stripes of aUbx appear in the ventral
germ band with the formation of additional segments.
Expression in dorsal tissue, legs and anal valves remains
unchanged. Expression of the anterior-most aUbx stripe
(the posterior stripe in T1 (T1p)), is enhanced at these
stages (Figure 3D and data not shown). Note that
although the legs posterior to T3 are forming, aUbx is not
expressed in their tips (Figure 3D). The posterior-most
part of the developing early embryo, which will later give
rise to the hindgut and the proctodaeum, remains free
from aUbx expression (Figure 2).
Complementary expression patterns of Ubx and aUbx

The Gm-aUbx transcript is regulated in a similar, but
complementary, specific pattern to that of Gm-Ubx (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Expression of aUbx starts earlier (stage 0) than expression of Ubx (stage 0.2 or 0.3), but
in a comparable posterior area. Double in situ hybridization to detect possible overlap of early Ubx and aUbx
expression is not possible because the signal of Ubx is too
weak in the early stages (Figure 2G-J). At stage 1, Ubx
expression is still restricted to the posterior growth zone

unlike the previously reported expression in T3 in stage
1.2 embryos [19]. At this stage, the anterior margin of
aUbx is clearly more anterior (T2) than that of Ubx (T3).
At stage 2, it becomes obvious that the expression patterns of Ubx and aUbx are indeed broadly complementary (Figure 4A-C). The stripe of aUbx expression
extending into the dorsal tissue lies in the posterior of T2,
and is thus anteriorly abutting the expression of Ubx (Figure 4A-C). The ventral aUbx stripe in T3 coincides with a
lack of Ubx expression in this area (Figure 4A-D). Very

trally (Figure 4B), and aUbx is weakly expressed anterior
to this (Figure 4A-C). Whereas the ventral expression of
Ubx at stage 4-6 becomes more complex, the expression
of aUbx remains as stripes (Figure 4D), which are complementary to the expression of Ubx. (Figure 4D). The
anterior shift of aUbx into the posterior of T1 (Figure
3A,B) coincides with a shift of Ubx expression into the
complete ventral part of T2 (Figure 4F) [19]. The anterior
border of dorsal Ubx is shifted towards the posterior
compared with its anterior border in ventral tissue (Figure 4F) [19]. In dorsal tissue, the expression of aUbx still
abuts the expression of Ubx and is hence also shifted
towards posterior (Figure 3C, Figure 4E; also seen in Figure 4F for a stage 4 embryo).

sequence of L. atkinsoni [15] and 98% (64 of 65 bp) identical with the sequence of L. forficatus (UK) [22]. The
expression pattern of Lf-Ubx is identical to that described
for L. atkinsoni [15]). As expected from the data for
Glomeris and Strigamia, the antisense transcript (LfaUbx) is also transcribed. The expression pattern of Lf-

Janssen and Budd EvoDevo 2010, 1:4
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/4

aUbx is complementary to that of Ubx and very similar to
that of Strigamia antisense Ubx in embryos with 30 legbearing segments (LBS) (Figure 5) [9]. A broad central
domain in the first walking leg segment (L1) abuts the
anterior-most expression of Ubx which extends into the
very posterior of L1. Dorsal to that, in the region of the
developing legs, aUbx is expressed as a thin stripe at the
border of the maxillipedal segment (mxpd) and L1 (Figure 5). We expect that the expression pattern of Lf-aUbx
is more complex in older developmental stages [9].
Detection of aUbx in arthropods other than myriapods

We investigated the possible expression of aUbx in members of other arthropod classes and an onychophoran.
Sense probes of the same length as the antisense probes
used for the detection of Ubx in Tribolium (Insecta), the
two known Ubx paralogs in Cupiennius (Chelicerata)
[16], and Ubx in Euperipatoides (Onychophora) failed to
detect any transcripts. In all cases, positive controls
detecting the Ubx signal were successfully probed with
antisense probes in parallel experiments (data not
shown).

Discussion
Conserved transcription and complementary expression of
Ubx and aUbx supports myriapod monophyly

Sequence and expression data of Ultrabithorax are presently known from four myriapod species: the geophilomorph Strigamia maritima (Chilopoda) [9]; the
lithobiomorph species L. atkinsoni and L. forficatus ([15]
and this study); and the pill millipede G. marginata
(Progoneata) [19]. In all cases, the antisense DNA strand
complementary to Ubx is transcribed and the expression
pattern of the antisense transcripts (aUbx) is complementary to that of the sense transcript (coding transcript;
Ubx) ([9] and this study). This finding suggests that complementary expression of sense and antisense transcripts

generated from the Ubx locus is conserved between all
myriapods.
Because aUbx expression has not yet been detected
outside the Myriapoda, but has been detected in
Chilopoda and Progoneata, it probably represents a synapomorphy for the Myriapoda, although this conclusion is
dependent on the phylogenetic position of symphylans
and pauropods [23-25]. This finding further supports
myriapod monophyly, which is to date mainly based on
nucleotide sequence data ([26,27] morphological data are
still controversial in this context [10,25,28,29].
Similarities of Ubx regulation in Drosophila and myriapods:
evidence for a conserved mechanism?

The fact that Ubx and aUbx are expressed in conserved
and complex complementary patterns strongly suggests
that one (or its transcription) is involved in the regulation
of the other. Striking similarities to the situation in myriapods can be found in Drosophila, in which transcription
of bxd non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) upstream of Ubx prevents transcription of the latter. This repression is probably caused by transcriptional interference as the bxd
transcript(s) elongate into the region of Ubx promoters
and prevent the binding of the transcription machinery
[4,30]. As a result, bxd ncRNAs are expressed in a complementary pattern to that of Ubx, causing a mosaic-type
expression pattern of Ubx within its overall expression
domain [4,6]
A similar situation is found in myriapods, in which a
putative ncRNA, aUbx, is expressed in a complementary
pattern to that of Ubx. Like the bxd ncRNAs in Drosophila, aUbx also precedes expression of Ubx, and also as
in Drosophila, expression of Ubx in myriapods occurs in
the anterior of each segment and expression of bxd and
aUbx occur in the posterior of each segment (this study,
[9,31]).
The most obvious difference between the expression of
bxd ncRNAs in Drosophila and aUbx in myriapods is that
aUbx (or its promoter) is located on the complementary
DNA strand in myriapods and not oriented in a tandem
position to Ubx on the same strand. How can this disparity be explained if we assume that aUbx expression in
myriapods is homologous to bxd expression in Drosophila?
The simplest explanation of this pattern would be to
postulate an inversion event in the Ubx locus back in the
stem lineage leading to the myriapods, placing the aUbx
(bxd) promoter on the complementary strand (Figure
6A). Subsequent transcription through the promoter
site(s) of Ubx in myriapods would then cause expression
of aUbx in a complementary pattern. However, this
would require a stage at which Antp and Ubx were on different strands, and as we show in this paper, bicistronic

mechanisms suggested for Ubx regulation in myriapods

Alternative functions of aUbx expression

Figure 6 Hypothetical interference of aUbx and Ubx/Antp transcription with Ubx and Antp expression. (A) Inversion model explaining complementary expression patterns of Ubx and aUbx based
on the hypothetical conservation of bxd/aUbx promoters. In a hypothetical ancestor of myriapods, bxd/aUbx and Ubx must be inverted
(inversion_1) (indicated by question mark). A second inversion must
have transferred Ubx back onto the leading strand. (B) De novo evolution of bxd-like aUbx promoter on the complementary strand upstream of Ubx. (C) Inferred negative interference of bicistronic
transcription on Antp expression. If Ubx/Antp does not code for UBX
protein, its expression may also repress monocistronic (translated) Ubx
in Glomeris. Promoters and direction of transcription are indicated by
arrows; genes are represented by shaded bars; crossbars indicate for
the split Hox cluster in Drosophila; relevant transcripts are highlighted
by coloured bars. Blue T-bars indicate suggested repressor function.

ants I and II) are conserved and thus are most probably of
strong developmental importance, thus they are unlikely
to have been separated in this way. A single inversion
event putting Ubx alone on the complementary strand
can also be excluded because of the presence of Ubx/
Antp bicistronic transcripts that are very unlikely to be a
result of a trans-splicing event (discussed below) [9,32].
An alternative to these unlikely possibilities is hat a new
bxd/aUbx promoter site evolved on the complementary
strand located between Antp and Ubx (Figure 6B). Functional studies or a fully sequenced genome, which could
possibly help shed light on the role of aUbx transcription
in myriapods and answer the question of whether the

A number of theories have been suggested over the past
few years to explain how noncoding antisense transcripts
or bidirectional transcription may regulate the expression
of the coding unit ([33] and references therein). A case of
possible transcriptional interference displaying much
similarity between Drosophila and myriapods has been
discussed in the previous section. However, although this
possibility appears to be likely, aUbx or its transcription
could nevertheless also act differently. We therefore summarize and discuss some of those mechanisms in the light
of our data.
First, transcription of the antisense strand can cause
epigenetic modifications, methylation of sense-strand
promoters, and conversion of the chromosome structure,
causing repression of gene transcription on the sense
strand [34]. Epigenetic modification could explain or
cause the complementary pattern of Ubx and aUbx if
aUbx represses the transcription of Ubx in tissues or cells
that are generally Ubx-competent.
Second, transcriptional interference can also occur via
promoter collision, when RNA polymerases meet on
opposite strands and cannot pass each other. This can
cause the premature termination of one or both transcripts [30,35].
Third, sense and antisense transcripts could form double-stranded (ds)RNA, a source for small interfering
RNAs that would mediate RNA interference (RNAi) [36].
The complementary expression pattern of Ubx and aUbx
would be explainable by the rapid degeneration of Ubx
due to perfectly matching miRNAs descendent from the
possible Ubx-aUbx dsRNA [37].
The fact that aUbx is expressed significantly earlier
than Ubx may also have important implications on the
regulatory mechanisms discussed. It would guarantee the
immediate binding of incorrectly expressed Ubx to preexisting aUbx in an RNAi-based mechanism, or provide a
head start for transcription of aUbx in cases of transcriptional interference. In the case of epigenetic modification,
it would prevent the later transcription of Ubx by silencing its promoter(s).
A 21 bp repeat in the Ultrabithorax 3' UTR of Glomeris

We discovered a repetitive sequence of exactly 21 bp (Figure 1D) in the 3' UTR of Ubx. This sequence most probably represents a minisatellite (or short sequence repeat;
SSR) common in bacterial and metazoan genomes [38]. It
may represent multiple recognition sites for micro
(mi)RNAs [39]. Alternatively, it could represent an ORF
encoding a small 113 amino acid protein, possibly

Janssen and Budd EvoDevo 2010, 1:4
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/4

involved in the regulation of Ubx. The finding of an SSR
could generally also be of interest for investigating population genetics in Glomeris [40].
Presence of Ubx/Antp bicistronic transcripts in myriapods,
crustaceans and onychophorans, but not in insects?

The finding that bicistronic transcripts of Ubx and Antp
(Ubx/Antp) are present in myriapods and crustaceans
suggests that this represents a conserved state of at least
the Mandibulata or potentially the Arthropoda. Despite
this, we failed to isolate Ubx/Antp fusion transcripts from
the beetle T. castaneum. The latter may merely represent
a loss in higher insects that finally allowed the Hox complex to split between Ubx and Antp, as is the case in Drosophila melanogaster [41]; however, in Tribolium, the Hox
cluster is still intact [8]. Alternatively, it may represent the
early loss of Ubx/Antp in the stem lineage of the insects
or hexapods. If the hexapods have evolved from a crustacean ancestor (as in the Pancrustacea theory), a loss of
Ubx/Antp may be present in the suggested recent sistergroup crustacean orders Remipedia and/or Cephalocarida [42]. The presence of Ubx/Antp fusion transcripts in
an onychophoran shows that the evolutionary origin of
bicistronic transcription of Ubx and Antp dates back to
the common ancestor of onychophorans and euarthropods, suggesting that Ubx/Antp is also likely to occur in
chelicerates.
Interestingly, only the short splice variant II (Figure
1B,B') has been isolated from myriapods. We therefore
believe that variant I may be lacking in myriapods exclusively, again supporting myriapod monophyly. However,
we are aware that negative results are less reliable arguments than positive results, and therefore we can only see
the lack of splice variant I in myriapods as minor evidence for monophyletic Myriapoda.
The presence of the Ubx/Antp splice variant II in onychophorans, crustaceans and myriapods argues against a
mere genomic rearrangement in a population of Ubx as
suggested for the centipede Strigamia [9], but rather suggests an important and conserved role in Hox gene regulation across the Arthropoda.
Conserved regulatory aspects of Ubx/Antp expression

In crustaceans, bicistronic transcripts of Ubx/Antp are
not (Daphnia) or only partially (only Ubx in Artemia)
translated. Expression of the translated monocistronic
transcripts, and therefore the protein, differs significantly
from expression of Ubx/Antp [11]. It is tempting to speculate that transcription of Ubx/Antp under control of the
Ubx promoter interferes with the proper transcription of
monocistronic Antp in these crustaceans.
The conserved appearance of Ubx/Antp in arthropods
and onychophorans suggests their involvement in the
regulation of Ubx, Antp or both Hox genes. In particular,
repression of Antp via Ubx/Antp transcription appears

Page 9 of 11

likely, not least because the transcript is apparently
spliced in such a way that it lacks most of its coding
capacity (variant II).
For Glomeris and Euperipatoides, it is unclear whether
the detected expression patterns of Ubx and Antp are a
result of mono-or bicistronic transcription. However, in
both, as in crustaceans [11], the Ubx/Antp transcript is
probably under control of the Ubx promoter, as the
expression pattern of Ubx/Antp is identical with that of
Ubx (not shown). Thus, it is possible Ubx/Antp contributes to or even replaces monocistronic Ubx expression in
Glomeris and Euperipatoides as it does in Artemia [11]. If
part of the detected mRNA expression patterns of Ubx
and Antp [19] is a result of Ubx/Antp, it might not correlate with the protein pattern. Specific antibodies to detect
UBX and ANTP protein are not available, and the crossreacting antibody FP6.87 [43] does not detect UBX in
Glomeris (data not shown). Further investigation is thus
needed to unravel the role of Ubx/Antp transcription in
arthropods.
Regulation of limb development in Glomeris

Ubx expression is likely to be involved in the delayed outgrowth of the walking legs posterior to T3 in Glomeris by
repressing Distal-less (Dll) as shown for other arthropods
[44-46]. The finding that aUbx, a possible repressor of
Ubx (as discussed above), is strongly expressed in the tips
of the legs in T2 and T3 further supports this view, suggesting that the absence of Ubx is indeed crucial for the
accelerated development of walking legs in T1 to T3 in
Glomeris [19]. The exclusion of Ubx from the distal part
of the legs possibly caused or supported by aUbx could
represent a developmental novelty in the 'battle' of
appendage growth in Ubx-expressing segments. In Strigamia and Lithobius, Ubx seems not to repress Dll, possibly because of a number of phosphorylation sites in the
C-terminal end of the protein that interfere with the
assumed repressor function of Ubx on Dll [19,45]. Consequently, there is no need to keep the tips of the legs free
from Ubx or, in other words, to express aUbx.

Conclusions
A number of conserved aspects of Ubx and Antp regulation are found across the Arthropoda. Repression of Ubx
transcription, and thus formation of a complex segmental
pattern of Ubx expression, may depend on transcriptional
interference as shown for Drosophila, and suggested and
visualized by aUbx expression in Glomeris. Furthermore,
bicistronic transcription of Ubx and Antp and subsequent
splicing of these transcripts as shown for Crustacea, Myriapoda and Onychophora, but possibly not Insecta, suggests that Ubx/Antp transcription is an important
ancestral feature of Hox gene regulation as well. As
shown for Crustacea, runthrough transcription and sub-

Janssen and Budd EvoDevo 2010, 1:4

sequent nontranslation of Ubx/Antp may compete with
the proper transcription of the (translated) monocistronic Ubx and Antp transcripts [11], and thus transcriptional interference via Ubx/Antp transcription might
contribute to a defined protein expression pattern within
areas of ubiquitously expressed Hox gene mRNA. Presence of aUbx transcription and the possible lack of Ubx/
Antp splice variant I in myriapods represent possible synapomorphies for the Myriapoda.
