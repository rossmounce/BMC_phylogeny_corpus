Evolutionary history and molecular epidemiology
of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus in the
Iberian Peninsula and Western Europe

Abstract
Background: Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a highly virulent calicivirus, first described in domestic
rabbits in China in 1984. RHDV appears to be a mutant form of a benign virus that existed in Europe long before
the first outbreak. In the Iberian Peninsula, the first epidemic in 1988 severely reduced the populations of
autochthonous European wild rabbit. To examine the evolutionary history of RHDV in the Iberian Peninsula, we
collected virus samples from wild rabbits and sequenced a fragment of the capsid protein gene VP60. These data
together with available sequences from other Western European countries, were analyzed following Bayesian
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to infer their phylogenetic relationships, evolutionary rates and demographic
history.
Results: Evolutionary relationships of RHDV revealed three main lineages with significant phylogeographic
structure. All lineages seem to have emerged at a common period of time, between ~1875 and ~1976. The Iberian
Peninsula showed evidences of genetic isolation, probably due to geographic barriers to gene flow, and was also
the region with the youngest MRCA.
Overall, demographic analyses showed an initial increase and stabilization of the relative genetic diversity of RHDV,
and a subsequent reduction in genetic diversity after the first epidemic breakout in 1984, which is compatible with
a decline in effective population size.
Conclusions: Results were consistent with the hypothesis that the current Iberian RHDV arose from a single
infection between 1869 and 1955 (95% HPD), and rendered a temporal pattern of appearance and extinction of
lineages. We propose that the rising positive selection pressure observed throughout the history of RHDV is likely
mediated by the host immune system as a consequence of the genetic changes that rendered the virus virulent.
Consequently, this relationship is suggested to condition RHDV demographic history.

Background
Viruses containing RNA as their genetic material usually
have a great capacity to adapt. This is so because the
viral polymerases responsible for replicating the genome
have a high error rate and therefore, many genomic variants are created at a high generation rate [1,2]. This
high mutation rate of RNA viruses makes them excellent models for addressing evolutionary processes such
as epidemic invasions, since their ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at similar time scales [3-5].

RNA viruses are the causal agents of many emerging
diseases and consequently the appearance, or reappearance of diseases caused by these viruses is not infrequent [2]. However, other ecological, social, health or
behavioural factors besides their high rate of genetic
variation can play an important role in the emergence
of a disease [6].
Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a recent disease
that was detected for the first time in 1984 in China,
and attributed to rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus)
imported from the former German Democratic Republic. The disease was described to cause sudden death
without apparent deterioration of the rabbit’s body condition, although haemorrhaging in the lungs was a

frequent observation [7,8]. Hereafter, the disease rapidly
spread to other Asian [9] and European [10] countries.
The first report of RHD in Europe was in Italy in 1986
[11], and already in 1988 it was detected in wild rabbits
in Spain [12] and in domestic rabbits in Russia, the
Middle East, Africa, America and India [10].
The aetiological agent of RHD is a single stranded
positive sense RNA virus belonging to the family Caliciviridae [13,14]. Since its discovery, many research efforts
have been devoted to its study. However many issues
remain unclear or controversial, such as its evolutionary
origin or the causes of the rapid succession of epidemics
in such a short period of time [15,16].
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
origins of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), for
example: (i) spread of brown hare syndrome virus - a
closely related calicivirus - to the rabbit [17], (ii)
changes in the properties of a non pathogenic virus that
make it virulent; or (iii) the virus arose from a virus
infecting another species [18]. The detection of RHDV
specific antibodies and RNA fragments in rabbit serum
samples from 1955 to 1980 [19-21], however, seem to
support the idea that the virus was already circulating in
Europe in an avirulent form before the first epidemic
was detected in China in 1984 [16].
Several causes have also been proposed to explain the
rapid expansion of RHD. Initially it was assumed that
China was the origin from where the virus spread causing severe epidemics [18,22]. However, subsequent phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that the Chinese
strains of the virus originated in Europe and currently
circulating RHDV strains do not have a single origin.
Rather, the virus seems to have originated at least twice
in the past: firstly in Europe, without causing the disease, and later in the rabbits exported to China [16,23].
These studies have also detected a large number of
RHDV evolutionary lineages that show low genetic
divergence both within and among phylogenetic groups
[17,19,24,25]. Some of these lineages do not present a
clear geographic structure, but they do reflect a temporal structure whereby some lineages become extinct
or less frequent, while others derived from them are
able to persist and cause new outbreaks of the disease
[16,17,24]. Despite showing no significant genetic differences in different geographic regions, RHDV does differ
in its epidemiology and virulence [15,26-29].
Some regions, notwithstanding the drastic reductions
suffered by rabbit populations after a first epidemic,
have seen a decline in the initially high virulence of
RHDV and this has enabled populations to gradually
recover [15,26]. In the Iberian Peninsula, however,
where rabbits are of great ecological and economic significance [30,31], RHD still affects many regions in

Page 2 of 10

which rabbit populations have been decimated or even
extinguished [28,32].
This heterogeneity in the way RHDV affects rabbits
in different geographic regions may indicate that there
are factors such as the host, climate or population size
that determine the epidemiology of the virus [15,28].
Regarding the host, in the Iberian Peninsula, the
European rabbit is an autochthonous species. Analyses
of mitochondrial and nuclear markers have revealed
two highly divergent lineages in the European rabbit
within the Iberian Peninsula that correspond to subspecies O. c. algirus and O. c. cuniculus [33-36]. These
two lineages are the result of two divergent populations that evolved separately for a long time in two
glacial refugia, one located in the southwest of the
Iberian Peninsula and another in the northeast. A
post-glacial expansion might have created a contact
zone in the center of the Iberian Peninsula [37].
Furthermore, the northern O. c. cuniculus expanded
outside of the Iberian Peninsula and originated all
European rabbits, as well as those of North Africa,
America, Australia, New Zealand and all the domestic
breeds. This expansion originated an intense bottleneck effect that diminished considerably the genetic
diversity in the O. c. cuniculus populations outside of
the Iberian Peninsula [34,38-40]. Consequently, the
rabbit in the Iberian Peninsula shows the largest
genetic diversity across the world distribution of the
species [34,41]. This genetic distinctiveness might pose
different selective pressures and evolutionary constraints for RHDV compared to other regions. However, so far, comparative studies including the two
rabbit lineages are scarce [16,42].
The objectives of the present study were: to examine
the evolutionary history of RHDV in the Iberian Peninsula and to infer the virus’ demographic history, with
special focus on its Western European distribution.
Given the genetic characteristics of this virus, we
would expect to observe: (i) a high genetic diversity
and (ii) a temporal genetic structure due to its high
mutation rate. In terms of the possible origin of the
virus and disease in the Iberian Peninsula, we could
speculate that (iii) if a virulent form of the RHDV was
introduced, the age of the most recent common ancestor should correspond to the time elapsed since the
appearance of the disease, while if the virus already
existed in an avirulent form, its age will be older. Also,
according to the recent and rapid geographic expansion of RHDV we would expect (iv) its demographic
history to reflect significant growth of its populations
and that (v) if the intensity of the epidemics has
decreased, or at least the number of hosts, a subsequent decline should also be observed.

Methods
Sampling and RNA isolation, amplification and
sequencing

Rabbits were collected in Spain between 2003 and 2007
(Additional File 1). About 125 mg of lung tissue were
homogenized in 1.25 ml of sterile PBS (8 mM
Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM
NaCl, pH7.4) and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min.
The supernatant was collected and stored at -20°C upon
RNA extraction.
Viral RNA was extracted from 100 μl of the lung
homogenate using TriPure reagent (Roche) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. A fragment of the
major capsid protein gene VP60 was amplified in all
samples using the primers RHDV1, RHDV2, RHDV3
and RHDV4 [19].
The primers RHDV1 and RHDV4 were used to RTPCR amplify a 698 bp fragment corresponding to positions 6096-6794 of the RHDV [43]. The RT-PCR reaction was conducted under the conditions indicated in
the AccessQuick RT-PCR System kit (Promega) and the
thermocycling program consisted of 45 min at 48°C for
cDNA synthesis, followed by 2 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of
1 min at 95°C, 40 s at 64°C, 1 min at 72°C, and a final
extension of 5 min at 72°C. Next, we performed a
nested PCR with the primers RHDV2 and RHDV3 to
amplify a 573 bp fragment corresponding to positions
6135-6719 of the RHDV. The PCR reaction contained
200 μM of dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer, 1 μg/μl of
BSA, 1 U of Taq polymerase (Eppendorf), 2.5 μl of PCR
buffer 10X (500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH8.3,
15 mM Mg 2+ ) and 0.5-2 μl of a 1:100 dilution of the
RT-PCR product. The PCR program involved an initial
denaturing step of 2 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 1 min at
95°C, 1 min at 64°C and 1 min at 72°C, and a final
extension step of 5 min at 72°C. All the RNA extraction
and amplification processes were carried out in a laboratory specifically equipped for this purpose. All reactions
included positive and negative controls. PCR products
were purified using ExoSAP-IT (GE Healthcare) and
sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 kit
(Applied Biosystems) and the primers RHDV2 and
RHDV3 in an automated sequencer ABI3730.
Phylogenetic analysis

Chromatograms were checked visually and the consensus sequence was constructed for each sample using
Sequencher 4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation). Nucleotide
sequences were translated into amino acids using MacClade 4.05 [44] and manually aligned with other homologous sequences available in GenBank.
Recombination has been previously described in RHDV
[45,46]. Although this seems to be a rather rare phenom-

enon that does not adversely affect rate estimations [16],
we did not include sequences that had been identified as
putative recombinants [16,45,46]. The alignment inferred
from all of the available data (AD, n = 151, 563 bp) was
subdivided in smaller data sets comprising sequences for
the main geographic areas previously analyzed: Germany
(GER), France (FRA1), United Kingdom (UK), China
(CHI) and Iberian Peninsula (IB) (Additional File 2).
For a wider comparison, we included available data on
non-overlapping VP60 sequences which could be of
interest because of their temporal or geographic origins.
Thus, an alignment of French RHDV isolates, consisting
of non-overlapping sequences of 501 bp at the 3’ end of
the VP60 gene, was built (FRA2, n = 21) (Additional
File 2) [24,47].
To evaluate the genetic variability of RHDV for each
of these data sets from the main geographic areas we
calculated their gene diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity
(π) and number of polymorphic sites (S) using DnaSP
5.10.1 [48].
Phylogenetic relationships among all the RHDV
strains (AD, n = 151) were inferred using different phylogenetic methods. As an outgroup we used four rabbit
calicivirus (RCV) sequences (X96868, GQ166866,
EU871528, NC011704), a seemingly avirulent, antigenically and genetically related to RHDV [49].
The evolutionary model that best fitted our data,
according to the Akaike Information Criterion, was calculated in jModelTest 0.1.1 [50]. Firstly, we performed a
Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis, and used the best
evolutionary method for our data as obtained in jModelTest 0.1.1, and allowed the program PhyML 3.0 [51]
to optimize the tree topology and the values of gamma
and proportions of invariant sites. Support for the ML
trees was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates. Secondly, a Bayesian Inference (BI) analysis was performed
using MrBayes 3.1.2 [52], simulating four simultaneous
Markov chains (MCMC) for 4 × 106 generations each,
and using a sampling frequency of 100 generations. The
first 250,000 generations were discarded as burn-in. The
BI analysis was performed considering one and three
partitions of the data corresponding to the 1st , 2nd and
3rd codon positions each assigned different substitutions
models. Bayesian posterior probabilities were obtained
to assess the robustness of the BI trees.
Lastly, to test for the presence of statiscally significant
geographical clustering in RHDV, we performed randomization tests on three tree-shaped statistics: the parsimony score (PS), the association index (AI) and the
monophyletic clade statistic (MC) using BaTS 1.0 [53].
Randomizations were performed across the posterior
distribution of trees obtained from MrBayes 3.1.2, hence
accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty.

Estimation of evolutionary rates, dates and past
population demographic history

The overall population dynamics of RHDV (AD) was
inferred in BEAST 1.5.3 [54] using the coalescent Bayesian Skyline Model [55] and an uncorrelated lognormal
relaxed clock. Four independent analyses were performed under the best-fit substitution model and the
SRD06 partition model, recommended for protein coding genes [54,56], and run for 5 × 107 generations and a
sampling frequency of 1000 steps. All output generated
were analyzed in Tracer 1.5 to test for convergence and
mixing, and were used to estimate the substitution rate
and time to the most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA) of RHDV for each of the major lineages found
and all the geographic regions.
We explored the changes through time of the relative
genetic diversity (Neτ, where τ is the average generation
time) of RHDV using the Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP)
method [55]. Median and 95% highest posterior density
intervals (HPD) were obtained with Tracer 1.5.
We also tested for demographic changes using summary statistic based methods. The effective population
size parameter (θ0) under a growth-decline population
model (θ1 fixed at 1,000,000) was calculated for RHDV
in DnaSP 5.10.1. Three time periods were defined based
on the results obtained in the BSP analysis: avirulent
period (before 1984), epidemic breakout (after 1984)
and recent period (after 2000). Because samples sizes
differed among time periods and, consequently, effective
population size estimates might be biased, we constructed for the “after 1984” and “after 2000” periods 10
data sets with 9 random samples. These results were
averaged and compared with the minimum sample size
of RHDV before 1984.
Selection analyses

To estimate selection pressures before and after the first
epidemic of RHDV in 1984, we calculated the ratio
between non-synonymous (d N ) and synonymous (d S )
substitutions for each individual codon using the fixedeffects likelihood (FEL) and random effects likelihood
(REL) methods [57]. These analyses were performed in
the online package Datamonkey [58]. Absence of recombination points was checked using GARD [59]. We
established a value of a = 0.1 for FEL and BF = 20 for
REL. In both cases, the dN/dS ratio was calculated using
a neighbour-joining tree based on the best-fit evolutionary model.
As indicated above, to account for the effect of different sample sizes in the analysis, we analyzed 10 data
sets with 9 random samples isolated after 1984, and
compared with the results from RHDV isolated before
the first epidemic.

Results
RHDV was detected in 47 wild rabbits from Spain and it
was possible to obtain a 563 bp sequence from each
sample. All the sequences were analyzed unambiguously
and we detected no evidence of infection by more than
one viral strain in the same individual (GenBank accession numbers: HQ198325-HQ198371, Additional File 1).
Along with the homologous sequences available in
GenBank, we constructed an alignment of 151 sequences
(AD). From this alignment we extracted the data sets
for Iberian Peninsula (IB, n = 71), France (FRA1, n = 8),
United Kingdom (UK, n = 49), Germany (GER, n = 7) and
China (CHI, n = 10). The alignment of non overlapping
sequences from France (FRA2) contained 21 sequences
isolated between 1988 and 2003 (Additional File 2).
The 151 RHDV sequences analyzed constituted 122
unique haplotypes (Hd = 0.993 ± 0.003). The geographic
regions that showed the highest genetic diversity were
France and Germany. In contrast, among the 71 Iberian
samples we found 45 haplotypes, which represented the
lowest RHDV diversity (Hd = 0.968 ± 0.010) (Additional
File 3).
The best evolutionary model estimated by jModelTest
0.1.1 for our data was TrN+I+G. The gamma shape
parameter was G = 0.574 and the proportion of invariable sites I = 0.172.
The phylogenetic methods used rendered congruent
topologies (Figure 1). Both analyses indicated three main
lineages (Lineage I, II and III) in which most of the RHDV
samples were included. Lineage I included RHDV strains
isolated in different European regions (Figure 1), some of
which had been isolated in the UK before the description
of the disease in 1984 and others isolated during the first
outbreaks in France, Germany and Spain (AST/89 and
MC-89). Also, this lineage included all the Iberian RHDV
samples isolated in Spain and Portugal from 1994 to 2007
(Figure 1). Six Iberian clades were described based on previous findings (Genogroup 1 [24], IB1, IB2 and IB3 [42])
and the new isolates from this study (IB4, IB5, IB6). No
clear geographic structure was observed among the Iberian samples, although most of the clades were restricted in
time, with the exception of IB3 that was the most widespread clade both in time and space (Figure 1, Additional
File 1). In Lineage II, we exclusively found European
strains of RHDV, mainly from the UK, Germany and
France. Conversely, Lineage III included strains from different continents. German strains were found at a basal
position with respect to all the Chinese strains, except a
sample from 1984, which seemed more related to those of
Lineage I and II, but without bootstrap or posterior probability support. This lineage also contained samples from
the United States, France and Reunion Island in the Indian
Ocean. Conversely, several RHDV strains from different

regions (France, Germany, Czech Republic, China, Mexico
and New Zealand) and strains prior to 1989 were not
included in any of the three main lineages identified (Figure 1).
Overall, the test performed for the presence of phylogeographic structure using the PS and AI statistics,
strongly rejected the hypothesis of panmixia (observed
PS of 21.986, expected PS of 71.718 [P < 0.0001];
observed AI of 1.133, expected AI of 10.175 [P <
0.0001]). Furthermore, the MC statistic indicated that
the correlation between phylogeny and taxa location was
only significant for the samples from the Iberian Peninsula (observed MCIB of 41.046, expected MCIB of 3.681
[P = 0.01]), UK (observed MCUK of 21.040, expected
MCUK of 2.757 [P = 0.01]) and China (observed MCCHI
of 6.354, expected MC CHI of 1.175 [P = 0.01]), that
appeared exclusively in Lineages I, II and III, respectively, with the exception of the “ancient” strains from
the UK that were found in Lineage I. On the other
hand, the RHDV isolates from France and Germany that
appeared in all lineages, and in many cases were closely
related to strains from other regions (Figure 1), did not
show a significant geographic correlation.
The coalescence based Bayesian analysis implemented
in BEAST 1.5.3 revealed that the MRCA for all the
RHDV data dated back to ~1884 (95% HPD 1941.31730.7) and estimated an evolutionary rate of 5.48 × 104
substitutions/site/year (95% HPD 2.79 × 10-4-8.10 ×
10-4). The three main clades found showed similar 95%
HPD intervals for their MRCA, from ~1875 to ~1976
(Figure 1), suggesting a close time of emergence for
these lineages.
When the main geographic regions were considered,
the youngest tMRCA was recovered for the Iberian
RHDV (~1936, 95% HPD 1955.7-1869.2) followed by
the isolates from the UK (~1898, 95% HPD 1940.31822.5). The remnant regions showed wider 95% HPD
intervals that were similar to the age of the complete
RHDV data set (Figure 2).
Bayesian Skyline Plot analysis of the demographic history of RHDV indicated that, as a whole, the relative
genetic diversity of RHDV increased in the 1950’s followed by a stationary phase until the mid 1980’s. Thereafter, RHDV relative genetic diversity started to decline,
especially in the late 1990’s when this reduction was
more drastic (Figure 3). Because samples were not
balanced across years, the same analysis was performed
removing those sequences dated before 1984 and presumably avirulent strains [15]. The plot recovered
showed the same demographic and temporal pattern,
although the stationary phase was not as clearly differentiated (data not shown).
The effective population size parameter θ0 estimated
for the three main periods identified in the BSP also

regions analyzed. Dots indicate median tMRCA values and blue

showed evidence of change in Ne of RHDV across time.
An increase of Ne was observed between the avirulent
period, before 1984 (θ0 = 11.597), and the samples after
the first epidemic breakout, after 1984 (θ0 = 20.620 ±
2.407, average value based on 10 data sets of 9 random
sequences). Subsequently, a reduction of N e was
observed for the most recent isolates after 2000 (θ 0 =
14.713 ± 5.812).
Adaptive selection analyses suggested an increase in
the selective pressure of RHDV after the first epidemic
breakout (Table 1). Before 1984 no codons were identified as positively selected by any method, and 29 codons
were considered under negative selection by FEL, but
not by the REL method. On the other hand, after 1984,
codon 137 of the alignment was identified as positively
selected considering all the data after 1984 and in 9 out

Discussion and Conclusion
Genetic variability and origin of RHDV in the Iberian
Peninsula

Although haplotype diversity was high and similar
among regions, the nucleotide diversity of the RHDV
strains varied among geographic regions. In the Iberian
Peninsula, UK and China, nucleotide diversity was much
lower than in France or Germany, and was equivalent to
half the overall nucleotide diversity (Additional File 3).
The low genetic diversity observed in these regions
could suggest that the virus originated from a single
introduction (e.g. as it is known to have occurred in
China [7]), or that it is the outcome of geographic isolation, (e.g.the case of the British Isles). Thus, the genetic
diversity of the virus in these regions could have been
reduced as a consequence of a founder event in the former case, or of drift in the latter [60].
To date in the Iberian Peninsula, it was unknown if (i)
RHDV was already circulating in an avirulent form, (ii)
there was a single introduction of RHDV or (iii) subsequent contact with other strains occurred. The phylogenetic data obtained here indicate that all the field strains
of RHDV in the Iberian Peninsula have a common ancestor and are closely related to strains AST/89 and MC-89
isolated during the first RHD outbreaks in Spain (Figure
1). The age of the MRCA of the Iberian strains is the
youngest of all the regions analyzed (Figure 2), but still
predates the first RHD outbreak in 1984 (~1936, 95%
HPD: 1955.7-1869.2). Hence, it may be deduced that the
virus introduced in the Iberian Peninsula came from a
more ancient lineage already circulating in Europe. This
fact was confirmed by the samples included in Lineage I
together with AST/89 and MC-89, isolated in different
regions of Europe since 1958 (Figure 1).
Dispersal of RHDV is fast and effective in short distances [61] because it is primarily transmitted by direct

contact between sick animals or indirectly by dead animals or contaminated food [8]. However, long distances
or geographic barriers, such as those existing in Great
Britain or the Iberian Peninsula, can affect its dispersal
[42]. The transport of rabbits or their products can also
play an important role in passive dispersal of the virus
[18]. According to the lack of any geographic structure
of the Iberian strains (Additional File 1), it seems that
movement of rabbits could have promoted RHDV dispersal within the Iberian Peninsula [32,62]. However,
considering the significant global geographic association
of all the Iberian strains, this is probably not the case
for the import and export of rabbits abroad. Only one
viral strain isolated in France in 2000 was found in
the Iberian RHDV group (Figure 1) [42], which could
have crossed the mountains transported by insects or
the wind [63,64]. Therefore, the Pyrenees might also
represent an effective barrier for RHDV, as it has been
shown for many other organisms [65].
Owing to the rapid evolutionary rate of RNA viruses,
their molecular phylogenies reveal both spatial and temporal patterns [4]. In France, six genetic groups have
been described for RHDV that are mostly consistent with
their dates of isolation but not their geographical location
[24,47]. In the Iberian Peninsula, some clades spanned a
wide range of time isolates, but most were restricted in
time (Figure 1, Additional File 1). For example, clade IB1
was basal to all the other Iberian clades, including those
strains isolated in 1989. Although this relationship was
not supported by the ML analysis, it might indicate that,
in the past, other related strains might have occurred
(e.g. Genogroup 1, IB1, IB4) but are currently extinct.
This temporal pattern, whereby lineages successively
become extinct and others appear, is typical of RNA
viruses [66,67], including calicivirus [68], and is mainly
conditioned by positive selection [69].
Phylogenetic relationships of RHDV

In general, the phylogenetic relationships resolved here
are in line with the findings of studies that have analyzed different portions of the genome or geographic
regions [15-17,19,23,24,42,47].
Three divergent groups were recovered from our phylogenetic reconstruction (Figure 1). These three groups

Alda et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:347
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/347

(Lineages I, II and III) closely matched the lineages
obtained in a phylogeny based on 43 complete
sequences of the VP60 gene, in which two major
lineages were described, one of which was divided in
two well supported groups [45]. Thus, Lineages I, II and
III described here would correspond to groups Ia, Ib
and II respectively recovered in the phylogeny based on
the complete VP60 gene sequence [45]. However, in
other works in which partial sequences of the VP60
gene were examined, a much larger number of RHDV
groups were defined, many of which are not supported
[15,19,42,70,71].
As explained above, the genetic structure of RHDV
has usually been described as being related to its year of
isolation [17,19,24,41] and within temporal groups, a
link to its place of origin emerges [41]. In our data,
however, we observed a global geographical distribution
of the lineages rather than a temporal structure of
RHDV sequences (Figure 1).
The only lineage that did not contain samples
before the first RHD outbreak was Lineage III, and we
could consider that all the RHDV samples in this lineage arose from already virulent strains. On the other
hand, Lineage I and II included either samples isolated before the first outbreak or avirulent strains.
However, these lineages were not older than Lineage
III. All lineages showed similar tMRCA estimates,
suggesting a common time of emergence for all of
them, between ~1875 and ~1976. This observed
emergence pre-dates the documented emergence of
RHD, a possibility that Kerr and colleagues had
already suggested [16].
The RHDV strains from the Iberian Peninsula, UK and
China appeared, almost exclusively, in Lineages I, II and
III respectively. However, other strains such as those from
France and Germany appeared in all the main clades (Figure 1). The presence of strains from different evolutionary
lineages in the same region could be attributable to a
greater extent to ancestral polymorphism and/or to higher
flow of viruses in certain areas of central Europe [16],
compared to more isolated regions such as the Iberian
Peninsula and the British Isles. Furthermore, these isolated
regions were those with the youngest tMRCA (Figure 2),
suggesting that RHDV might have originated in continental Eurasia [16] and subsequently colonized the islands
and southern peninsulas. However, different sampling
sizes might affect the accuracy of these estimates, and conclusions should be drawn with caution.
Demographic history and natural selection

The substitution rate estimated for the complete RHDV
data set (5.48 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year) was very similar to that reported recently for a similar data set (7.7 ×
10-4 substitutions/site/year, 95% HPD: 3.9 × 10-4 - 11.0 ×

Page 8 of 10

10-4 [16]). However, these rates were more than an order
of magnitude lower than the rate estimated for the same
gene region using a ML method (1.3 × 10-3 substitutions/
site/year, 0.59 × 10-3 - 2.1 × 10-3 [72]), and more than two
orders of magnitude lower than the rate estimated for the
capsid gene of other calicivirus [68]. Although the estimated substitution rate is within the range observed for
single stranded RNA viruses, it more closely resembles the
lower substitution rates recorded for viruses transmitted
by arthropod vectors [72,73]. The relatively low substitution rate of this virus could therefore explain the long
term persistence of certain strains in some populations
many years after their introduction [74].
The BSP method, which allows the fitting of different
demographic scenarios across time [55], distinguished
three stages in the history of RHDV. First, a growth
stage between 1950 and 1960; second, a stationary stage
between 1960 and 1984 and finally a stage of decline
beyond 1984 that became steeper at the end of the
1990s (Figure 3). The different demographic trends
before and after the description of the first RHD outbreak match the different patterns of natural selection
for each time range. Thus, during the growth and stationary stages, we detected no evidence of significant
positive selection, whereas after 1984 evidence did
emerge of positive selection, as well as an increase in
the number of codons under negative selection over the
VP60 fragment analyzed (Table 1).
In our data, codon 137, which is located in region E of
the major capsid gene VP60, showed the strongest evidence of positive selection. The presence of positive
selection in this region agrees with previous studies of
RHDV and other calicivirus and with the fact that this
region contains the main antigenic determinants [68,75].
Furthermore, the association between positive selection
and antigenicity suggests that RHDV evolution is mainly
driven by the host immune response [75].
Thus, the great virulence that characterized the first
outbreaks of RHD would have caused a strong immune
response in the rabbit, generating great selective pressure.
In this way and as indicated by the selection analyses performed [75], there is ongoing selective pressure on certain RHDV strains, and consequently the fixation of
favourable mutations or the purging of deleterious variants would result in the strong decrease in the relative
genetic diversity recently observed for the virus [76,77].
