Abstract
Background: The steadily increasing number of prokaryotic genomes has accelerated the study
of genome evolution; in particular, the availability of sets of genomes from closely related bacteria
has facilitated the exploration of the mechanisms underlying genome plasticity. The family
Vibrionaceae is found in the Gammaproteobacteria and is abundant in aquatic environments. Taxa
from the family Vibrionaceae are diversified in their life styles; some species are free living, others
are symbiotic, and others are human pathogens. This diversity makes this family a useful set of
model organisms for studying bacterial evolution. This evolution is driven by several forces, among
them gene duplication and lateral gene transfer, which are believed to provide raw material for
functional redundancy and novelty. The resultant gene copy increase in one genome is then
detected as lineage-specific expansion (LSE).
Results: Here we present the results of a detailed comparison of the genomes of eleven
Vibrionaceae strains that have distinct life styles and distinct phenotypes. The core genome shared
by all eleven strains is composed of 1,882 genes, which make up about 31%–50% of the genome
repertoire. We further investigated the distribution and features of genes that have been
specifically expanded in one unique lineage of the eleven strains. Abundant duplicate genes have
been identified in the eleven Vibrionaceae strains, with 1–11% of the whole genomes composed
lineage specific radiations. These LSEs occurred in two distinct patterns: the first type yields one
or more copies of a single gene; we call this a single gene expansion. The second pattern has a high
evolutionary impact, as the expansion involves two or more gene copies in a block, with the
duplicated block located next to the original block (a contiguous block expansion) or at some
distance from the original block (a discontiguous block expansion). We showed that LSEs involve
genes that are tied to defense and pathogenesis mechanisms as well as in the fundamental life cycle
of Vibrionaceae species.

Conclusion: Our results provide evidence of genome plasticity and rapid evolution within the
family Vibrionaceae. The comparisons point to sources of genomic variation and candidates for
lineage-specific adaptations of each Vibrionaceae pathogen or nonpathogen strain. Such lineage
specific expansions could reveal components in bacterial systems that, by their enhanced genetic
variability, can be tied to responses to environmental challenges, interesting phenotypes, or
adaptive pathogenic responses to host challenges.

Background
The diversity and ubiquity of members of the domain Bacteria is convincing evidence of their ability to develop successful
adaptive
strategies
during
evolution.
Evolutionarily closely related species or strains that have
undergone lifestyle changes (such as from free-living to
intracellular obligate pathogen, or from free-living to
symbiotic) are excellent targets for studying genome plasticity and adaptive changes in bacterial systems.
Three principle mechanisms are considered important in
bacterial adaptation: acquisition of new genetic material
by lateral gene transfer or gene duplication, positive selection resulting in fixation of advantageous mutations in
genes, and changes in gene expression regulation. Among
the various evolutionary forces driving genome plasticity,
gene duplication and lateral gene transfer are believed to
provide raw material for functional redundancy and novelty in the development of biological systems in bacteria
[1]. Gene duplication can arise from large scale (genome
or chromosome block) duplications, small scale single
gene duplications, nonhomologous recombination, or
through the action of mobile genetic elements. When a
gene duplication event occurs, the duplicate genes supply
redundant functions. Deleterious mutations in one copy
of a gene may be harmless because the redundant gene
copy can provide a back-up function. Novelty can arise
when one gene receives most of the selective pressure and
shields the other copy, allowing it to evolve under relaxed
selective constraints. The consequent elevated evolutionary rates are postulated to give rise to novel functions. Bacteria can also acquire new genes from other organisms via
lateral gene transfer using the mechanisms of conjugation,
bacterial phage infection, and acquisition of plasmids.
The subsequent expansion of these new genes can increase
the number of gene copies. The emergence of multiple
gene copies by duplication or lateral gene transfer in a specific lineage is known as a lineage specific expansion (LSE)
event [2].
The recent release of the complete genomic sequences for
several Vibrionaceae strains provides an ideal model system for comparative studies of evolutionary mechanisms
linked to different life styles and varying levels of pathogenicity [3-8]. The family Vibrionaceae is found in the
Gammaproteobacteria and is abundant in aquatic environ-

ments. Members of this family are pathogenic for shellfish, finfish, other marine animals and humans. Vibrio
cholerae is the etiological agent of cholera, which has
claimed millions of lives over the centuries. This free-living pathogen can be found in seawater around the world.
In the Ganges delta, it causes annual epidemics; the wave
of infections is correlated with seasonal changes in rainfall
and sunlight [9]. Complete genomic sequences are available for the serogroup O1 biogroup El Tor strain N16961,
a toxigenic strain capable of causing epidemic cholera,
and serogroup O1 biogroup Classical strain O395, which
has been extensively used for molecular analysis. Two
other members of this family, V. parahaemolyticus and V.
vulnificus, do not cause epidemics; they are the causes of
seafood-associated food poisoning. Genome sequences
are available for V. parahaemolyticus strain RIMD
2210633, and two strains of V. vulnificus: YJ016 and
CMCP6. Another two members of this family, V. harveyi
and V. splendidus, are common in marine environments
and are not human pathogens. V. harveyi is an opportunistic pathogen or a primary pathogen of many commercially cultured invertebrate species [10]. V. splendidus can
cause disease and death in many marine species including
commercially important fishes, oysters, mussels, and scallops. This bacterium was linked to significant mortalities
in oysters (Crassostrea gigas) during the summer of 2001
[11]. Genome sequences are available for V. harveyi strain
ATCC BAA-1116 and V. splendidus strain LGP32. A sixth
member of this family, Aliivibrio (Vibrio) fischeri, is a nonpathogenic, bioluminescent symbiont living within the
light emitting organs of the squid Euprymna scolopes, and
is thought to provide its host with protection from predators. Genomics sequence of two strains of A. fischeri,
ES114 and MJ11 are available. A second species from this
genus, A. salmonicida, is the causative agent of cold water
vibriosis (Hitra disease) in Atlantic salmon and rainbow
trout. The genome of A. salmonicida strain LFI1238 has
been sequenced to provide information on infectivity and
pathogenicity. The eleventh genome from the Vibrionaceae
comes from Photobacterium profundum strain SS9. This bacterium is not known to be pathogenic and is capable of
growth at pressures of up to 70 MPa. It grows best at 10
MPa and is thus classified as a piezophile. Thirty-eight
genes have been identified that are needed for growth at
the high pressures and low temperatures found in the
deep ocean [12].

In this paper, we investigate the distribution and features
of genes that have been expanded in one specific lineage
of these eleven strains, whether the expanded gene is
unique to one strain or otherwise. The identity of these
genes can lead us to those networks whose adaptive
changes correlate with environmental challenges, interesting phenotypes, or the emergence of pathogenic effects.

Results and discussion
The core genome of the Vibrionaceae
We computed the set of orthologous proteins shared by
eleven strains from the Vibrionaceae. The results of our
inter-genomic search yielded a core genome comprised
1,882 orthologous genes (Additional file 1). Not surprisingly, this is somewhat smaller than the single species core
genome of 2,741 genes established for V. cholerae [13].
Most (93%) of these core gene clusters contained a single
representative from each strain. The number of loci represented within these orthologous clusters made up from 31
to 50% of the gene complements of these strains (Table
1). This proportion is comparable to the species-level core
genome of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and
Haloquadratum walsybi [14] and larger than the genus-level
core genome of Streptococcus, which, at 600 genes, represents between 25 and 33% of the coding sequences in
those genomes [15]. Given that our Vibrionaceae core proteome is built from representatives of three genera, the
degree of conservation is remarkable. It has been observed
by Vitulo et al., using k-means and hierarchical cluster
analysis of phylogenetic profiles of 320 prokaryotic
genomes, that the number of genes shared by organisms
decreases as the number of organisms considered
increases [16].

When we assigned functional categories to the core
genome, the most highly represented COG functional category was metabolism (36%), followed by cellular processes and signaling (21%), and then information storage
and processing (18%) (data not shown). These categories
represent the proteins involved in the fundamental cellular activities common to all Vibrionaceae. Twenty-five percent of the core genome is either poorly characterized or
not classified due to the abundance of hypothetical or
unknown proteins encoded in Vibrionaceae genomes.
The distribution of lineage specific expansion genes in
Vibrionaceae
Abundant duplicate genes have been identified in the
eleven Vibrionaceae strains. Many genes exhibit lineage
specific expansion, accounting for 1–11% of the whole
genomes (Table 1, also see Additional file 2). V. harveyi
has the largest proportion of gene duplications in the
strains we examined with P. profundum very close behind.
Both these strains have genome sizes that are significantly
larger (16 to 43% larger in the case of P. profundum, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S1/S11

27 to 56% larger in the case of V. harveyi) than the
genomes of other strains in the Vibrionaceae. The continuing expansion of these genomes exemplifies the conventional wisdom that gene duplication, possibly along with
lateral gene transfer, are the driving forces for genome
diversity as well as a buffering mechanism in response to
selective pressure in bacteria [1,17]. When the distribution of expansion events is viewed in terms of the core
genome, it is not surprising to see that most of the expansion events involve genes that are not in the core genome.
Almost by definition, the genes in the core genome are
those required to meet environmental conditions met by
all eleven strains, while the genes outside the core genome
are those required when strains find themselves in environmental conditions unique to their lifestyle. One of the
pools of laterally transferred genes found in all the strains,
and that is frequently amplified in some of them, is the
large integron [18]. Researchers have noted that the similarities between the intI genes that anchor these integrons
tend to correlate with the environment in which the
organisms are found, rather than on the phylogenetic relationships among the taxa [19].
The majority of the lineage-specific expanded gene families in all the strains consist of only a few genes, which is
compatible with the notion that these comparative analyses reveal only recently duplicated genes in bacterial
genomes. The gene family size ranges from two to seventysix (Figure 1). In individual Vibrionaceae strains, 67%–
98% of the gene families are of size 2, and, collectively,
gene families of 2–4 genes account for >80% of the gene
families. Large gene families are rare, only found in V. harveyi, A. salmonicida and P. profundum (Figure 1).
By definition, each LSE family is expanded in only one of
the genomes we examined. In some cases, there is no
orthologous gene in any other ten genomes, and we classified these LSE families as lineage-unique. The number of
such lineage-unique LSEs in each strain is shown in Table
2, along with some examples of the encoded functions.
The rest of the LSE families are typical LSEs, in that they
are formed from a gene for which an ortholog is found in
at least one other of the genomes studied (Table 1). The
lineage-unique gene families are likely to have a more significant impact on the genome they reside in because they
appear to be "novel" to the pan-genome. They may have
arisen from a lateral gene transfer event followed by a subsequent series of expansion events. Most of the lineageunique LSE are hypothetical proteins with unknown functions. However, some of the lineage-unique LSEs carry out
important functions, which may be related to characteristics of the host organism that distinguish it from the other
members of the Vibrionaceae (Table 2).

The patterns of lineage specific expansion
Two distinct patterns of lineage specific expansion have
been observed. The first type involves a single gene and
can yield two or more copies in a consecutive order, a

result we term a contiguous single gene expansion event.
For example, two adjacent copies of a sensory box sensor
histidine kinase (VC1084 and VC1085) are found in V.
cholerae N16961. Such an expansion in the components

The second pattern of lineage specific expansion we
observed has a high evolutionary impact, as the expansion
occurs on a larger scale, involving blocks of genes rather
than a single gene. These blocks may form modules capable of related functions (Table 3). For example, in V. cholerae N16961 we see at least three block duplications. In
one case, two pairs of paralogous genes on chromosome

BURP

of the two-component signal transduction networks probably aids the pathogen's response to the novel environmental conditions that it encounters. Another striking
example is the occurrence of seven copies of a putative
anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase subunit C
(Reb) gene that is seen in A. fischeri ES114 (with locus IDs
NT01VFA1139,
NT01VFA1146-1148,
and
NT01VFA1150-1152), but not in other sequenced Vibrionaceae genomes (Figure 2). The encoded proteins are
truncated (87–102 amino acid residues) versions of the
full length (423 aa) C-subunit. Six genes are arranged on
one strand immediately adjacent to one another, while
the seventh is on the opposite strand about 15 kbp
upstream. It is unlikely that these copies preserve intact
enzyme functions, as they have diverged significantly
from the intact enzyme. However, the six neighboring
copies have maintained a sequence homology of 85 to
92%, which may be evidence of a selective pressure that is
maintaining some vestigial enzymatic function that is still
useful to the organism. The anaerobic respiratory activities catalyzed by anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase confer significant advantages to A. fischeri and its
relatives Photobacterium leiognathi and V. harveyi [20].

2 [(VCA0393 and VCA0394) and (VCA0437 and
VCA0438)] are the result of a discontiguous block duplication. The largest duplicate block in V. cholerae N16961,
in this case a contiguous duplication, is composed of five
pairs of paralogs (VC1466-VC1470 and VC1472VC1476), which includes one pair of plasmid replication
proteins, two pairs of helix-turn-helix proteins, and two
pairs of hypothetical proteins. Extensive discontiguous
block duplication of a four-gene block has also been identified in the V. vulnificus CMCP6 genome (Figure 3). Nine
such blocks are located on both chromosomes, with eight
blocks on chromosome 1, and one block on chromosome
2. The orientation of the eight four-gene blocks on chromosome 1 also suggests that a gene inversion occurred
after the series of gene duplication events (Figure 3). Three
of the duplicated genes have unknown conserved hypo-

genes (see below), histone acetyltransferases, metabolic
enzymes, etc. [18], and many of the examples from V.
cholerae discussed here involve genes from the integron
region. These duplications are unusual in several ways.
Firstly, the initial gene is acquired by a type of lateral gene
transfer that involves recruitment of a cassette carrying the
gene from the environment, so they are most often the
seeds for lineage-unique duplications. Secondly, the
duplications are often discontiguous block duplications.

As a cassette does not usually include a promoter for the
gene it carries, it is thought that transcription proceeds
from the intI gene, implying that the duplicated genes will
undergo a change in expression level depending on
whether the genes move closer to or further from the intI
promoter. Some of the few genes that do have their own
promoters include the antitoxin/toxin genes discussed
below. It is thought that, in addition to the roles discussed

below, these genes may act to stabilize the integron, preserving the genes it carries from deletion [22].
Functional categories that have undergone lineage specific
expansion
The gene families that show lineage specific expansion
may play important roles in defense and pathogenesis
mechanisms as well as in the fundamental life cycle of
Vibrionaceae species (Additional file 2). The existence of
multiple copies of transporters, starvation response proteins, and sensor proteins seen in these strains reflects not
only the evolutionary history of bacterial exposure to various stresses in the aquatic ecosystem, such as limited
food supply, changes in ion concentration, and temperature swings, but also the need to interact effectively with
the host. Some examples, drawn from the families our
analysis uncovered, follow.
(i) Regulation of information processing, metabolism and cellular
processes
Several gene families that function in regulation of information storage and processing, metabolism and cellular
processes and signaling are seen to be expanded in specific
lineages.
(1) Transcription
Two-component regulatory systems control many aspects
of physiology, including transcription, and some of these
two component transcriptional regulatory systems are
expanded in V. cholerae, A. fischeri, and V. parahaemolyticus. They are thought to regulate diverse responses involving, for example, nitrogen acquisition and assimilation,
aerobic respiration, adaptation to pH and osmolarity
changes, virulence related to secretion systems, toxin pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S1/S11

duction, and adherence factors. Several histone acetyltransferases (HATs) have been expanded in V. cholerae.
Like the toxin-antitoxin system genes discussed above,
these genes are found within the integron located on chromosome 2. The histone acyltransferases form an ancient
family that has a role in organizing the chromosomes in
Eukaryotes. In bacteria they may play a regulatory role,
analogous to the integration host factor, which is thought
to change chromosomal architectures in order to facilitate
regulation of transcription of, for example, key virulence
proteins in V. cholerae [23].
(2) Cell cycle control and cell division
Interestingly, two copies of the luxB gene encoding the
luciferase beta chain are present in A. fischeri [24]. This
enzyme, with its alpha subunit, catalyzes the reaction for
luminescence. It is under positive regulation by the quorum sensing mechanism that coordinates the communication of bacteria and maintains the proper cell density
within a limited growth space: luminescence may not be
a trait that confers an advantage to the host when the density of bacteria is too low, as the light can be too weak and
its generation simply a waste of energy for the bacteria.

Duplicate copies of genes homologous to toxin-antitoxin
stbDE genes [25] have been identified in V. cholerae
N16961 (with locus IDs VCA0489-0488 and VCA04780477 on chromosome 2) and V. vulnificus CMCP6 (with
locus IDs NT01VV2333-2332 and NT01VV2358-2357 on
chromosome 1). Typically, these pairs of genes have the
potential to form a partnership in a toxin-antitoxin (TA)
stability system. The toxic activity of one protein is normally repressed by its partner antitoxin. Bacteria have
developed TA systems to promote their segregational stability. TA systems have been found located on plasmids or
chromosomes in pathogenic bacteria, which suggests that
these genes may function in virulence. In the case of plasmid genes, they may contribute to the segregational stability of a virulence plasmid. If a plasmid that carries the TA
system is lost, the antitoxin decays more rapidly than the
toxin, which is then free to act on its cellular targets. This
results in the programmed cell death or stasis of the plasmid-free bacteria. In the case of chromosomal genes, it is
possible that this system plays a role in the maintenance
of the two chromosome genome characteristic of the
Vibrionaceae. In natural environments Vibrios can exist as
multicellular colonies or biofilms displaying coordinated
cellular processes and it has been postulated that some
cells in this situation will lose one of the chromosomes,
becoming non-viable drone cells that can contribute to
resource harvesting, but not to resource consumption [3].
The chromosomal TA systems thus tune the physiology of
the bacterial cells in response to external environments,
and by inducing either reversible bacteriostasis or apopto-

sis [26] can contribute to the overall health of the community.
(3) Signal transduction
Another role of two-component regulatory systems is in
signal transduction. Such systems are composed of histidine sensory protein kinases (HPKs) and response regulators (RRs), and constitute key players in the mechanism
by which bacteria sense and respond to changes in their
environment. We have found three copies of a hypothetical sensory box sensor histidine kinase in V. cholerae
N16961 (with locus IDs VC1084, VC1085 and
VCA0719). It is likely they are involved in the signal transduction into cells; however, without identifying the
response regulator partners in the two-component system, it would be difficult to determine the function of
these histidine kinases.

Another example of signal transduction gene expansion is
a family, seen only in V. cholerae N16961, of proteins that
carry the GGDEF domain: proteins VC1372 and VC2224.
3', 5'-cyclic diguanylic acid (cyclic di-GMP) is an intracellular signal used in a wide variety of bacteria. Proteins carrying the GGDEF domain in bacteria play an important
role in the synthesis of cyclic di-GMP, and are often linked
to a regulatory domain such as the EAL domain, which
participates in the degradation of the same compound. In
V. cholerae, cyclic di-GMP regulates various processes,
such as biofilm formation, virulence and transition from
persistence in the aquatic environment to survival in the
human gastrointestinal tract [27-30]. Proteins with a
GGDEF domain and capable of modulating cyclic di-GMP
concentration are quite common in the Vibrionaceae
genomes, including the V. cholerae N16961 genome [31],
but VC1372 and VC2224 probably represent a subset of
the GGDEF-containing proteins with a role that is unique
to the situations faced by V. cholerae.
Bacteria exhibit chemotactic responses to different substrates, such as sugars, amino acids, and dipeptides. Those
transmembrane signaling responses are mediated by
methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). Based on
signaling and adaptation domain length and sequence
conservation, there are seven major MCP classes [32]. A
large-scale comparative genomics analysis reveals existence of multiple copies of MCPs in Vibrionaceae genomes.
It is noteworthy that MCPs in A. fischeri ES114 tend to be
duplicated in tandem repeats. A couple of neighbor MCPs
are located close to each other on the chromosome (with
locus IDs NT01VFA0459-0460 and NT01VFA0171-0172).
(4) Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis
The lipocalins form a family of small proteins (15–25
kDa) first described in eukaryotes and later in Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial lipocalin Blc plays a role in storage

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S1/S11

or transport of lipids and thus is necessary for outer membrane maintenance [33]. There are four blc genes blc-1, blc2, blc-3, and blc-4 in V. cholerae.
(ii) Pathogenesis, virulence, and defense
Various gene families that have been implicated in virulence, pathogenesis and defense exhibit lineage specific
expansion. Different types of toxins are found in pathogenic V. cholerae and V. vulnificus, as well as in non-pathogenic A. fischeri. The role of toxins in pathogenic strains
is obvious, while their role in the non-pathogenic symbiont A. fischeri may be related to squid-bacterium communication and act to ensure a beneficial outcome for the
host-bacterium mutualism [5,34].
(1) Multidrug efflux pump
The vceCAB (vce) operon encodes the multidrug resistance
efflux pump VceCAB (VCE), which contributes to resistance of V. cholerae to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazine (CCCP), deoxycholate, and pentachlorophenol
[35]. VceR, a TetR-type repressor, represses vceCAB operon
by binding to a 28 bp inverted-repeat within the vceR-vceC
intergenic region, and positively autoregulates its own
expression [36,37]. The remnant of the vceCAB operon
(vceAB) is identified in other Vibrionaceae such as V. vulnificus strains, in V. parahaemolyticus and in A. fischeri. Furthermore, there are two copies of vceAB found in nonpathogenic A. fischeri ES114 (with locus IDs
NT01VF0957-0958
on
chromosome
1
and
NT01VFA1114-1115 on chromosome 2). This is consistent with our finding of extensive block duplications
involving both chromosome 1 and 2 in A. fischeri ES114.

V. parahaemolyticus has a unique energy metabolism
mechanism and thus requires Na+ for its growth. V. parahaemolyticus not only possesses a primary respiratory Na+pump, Na+-coupled membrane processes, and an Na+driven flagella motor, but also has Na+/drug transporters
[38]. We found a Na+ driven multidrug efflux pump/
adhesin gene duplicated in V. parahaemolyticus (with locus
IDs NT01VP1153 and NT01VPA0916) and in V. splendidus (with locus ID CAV19032 and CAV26372), while a
single orthologous copy remains in V. vulnificus, V. cholerae, V. harveyi, A. salmonicida, and P. profundum SS9. No
orthologous gene was identified in A. fischeri ES114,
which is consistent with the symbiotic environment it
lives in. However, an orthologous copy exists in A. fischeri
MJ11, implying the gene was lost in strain ES114.
(2) Transport systems
A number of transporter families that were previously
reported to mediate drug resistance and bacteria defense,
including the multidrug resistance ABC transporter family
and the major facilitator family, show radiation in a single
taxon. In V. cholerae N16961, we found two genes,

Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10(Suppl 1):S11

VC1391 and VC1597, which share high sequence similarity, contain a conserved MFS-1 domain, and likely belong
to the sugar transporter superfamily [39]. A Blast search
against the non-redundant sequence database found similar sequences in other strains of V. cholerae, but not in
other Vibrionaceae species, except a single gene copy in V.
angustum S14. These V. cholerae-unique genes appear to be
involved in multidrug transport and may relate to the
pathogenesis of V. cholerae. In A. fischeri ES114, we
observed a duplicated multidrug resistance protein B gene
(with locus IDs NT01VF0958 and NT01VFA1115), but
did not see this duplication in the other strains.
(3) Iron acquisition
Iron scavenging is important for host-associated bacteria,
as this nutrient is almost always limiting. In A. fischeri
ES114, a gene block on chromosome 2 with at least seven
genes has been duplicated and oriented in an inverted
order. An ABC-type Fe3+-hydroxamate transport system
with 3 genes, including ATPase component, periplasmic
component and permease component (with locus IDs
NT01VFA0159-0161 and NT01VFA0792-0790) is duplicated and located in these blocks. These ferrichrome utilization genes (fhu loci) are coordinately regulated in
response to iron availability [40]. We also found biopolymer transport proteins TolQ-TolQ-TolR (with locus IDs
NT01VFA0194-0196 and NT01VFA0788-0786) duplicated in A. fischeri ES114. Similar LSE blocks were
observed in strain MJ11. The tol genes were first described
in Escherichia coli, and more recently in several other species. They are involved in the pathogenesis of E. coli, Haemophilus ducreyi, V. cholerae and Salmonella enterica [41].
The tol-pal genes have been shown to be required for
maintaining the outer-membrane integrity of Gram-negative bacteria. The inner membrane TolA protein together
with the outer membrane lipoprotein Pal forms a transmembrane link in which TolA is energized. Both TolQ
and TolR proteins are essential for the TolA-Pal interaction and TolA energization [42].
(4) Adhesion
Pili are expressed on cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria
and mediate the bacterial colonization or the attachment
between host and pathogens. This attachment is a critical
step in pathogenesis, thus pili are considered important
virulence factors in many pathogenic bacteria [43]. Currently, four recognized types of pili have been found in
Gram-negative bacteria. In the A. fischeri ES114 genome,
ten pilus gene clusters, including eight type-IV pilus loci,
have been identified [5]. The type IV-B tight adhesion
pilus family is encoded within the flp operon, which
encodes proteins responsible for the Flp fimbriae synthesis, assembly and export. Two homologous flp operons
(with locus IDs (NT01VF0551-0553 and NT01VF 05550558) and (NT01VFA0221-0223 and NT01VFA0225-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S1/S11

0228) are located on each chromosome in A. fischeri
ES114. Two copies of this operon are also present in A.
fischeri MJ11. A single copy of this operon is found in V.
parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, and it is not found in V.
cholerae. A mutation in the flp1 homolog on chromosome
2 of A. fischeri ES114 suggests that these pili are required
for achieving normal colonization levels in the host light
organ [44]. So it is likely that the Flp type IV pili may
enhance the facultative symbiosis of A. fischeri, but make
little or no contribution to virulence in other strains. The
functional role of the flp operon has been studied in
Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, a piliated bacterial pathogen of Atlantic salmon. Evidence showed that
the Flp pilus made little or no contribution to virulence,
while a second type IV pilus system, Tap, made a moderate contribution to virulence [45].

Conclusion
Our analysis of gene duplication and lineage specific
expansions in the Vibrionaceae clearly shows that this evolutionary mechanism is a major force behind genome
diversification within this taxon. Two modes of expansion, single gene expansion and block expansion, are in
play, and while the former is more common, the latter
probably has a greater impact on the evolution of the species in this taxon. When we looked at which genes were
being amplified, we first noticed that some of these genes
are unique to the strain in which the LSE was observed. V.
cholerae O395 was especially rich in these lineage-unique
expansion events – over 67% of the observed expansion
events were of this type. One possible explanation of this
phenomenon lies with the integrons found in the chromosomes of each strain; V. cholerae's integron, while not
the longest, has the highest number of different gene cassettes. These environmentally acquired genes appear to be
a source of many of the duplications seen in this strain. V.
harveyi and P. profundum also have large portion of lineage-unique expansions. The genes amplified included
genes known to be involved in the regulation of expression of not only genes involved in host colonization but
also genes that help these strains survive in the environment outside the host. The amplified genes also included
those encoding products directly involved in host colonization, such as fimbriae-related genes, genes involved in
evasion of host defenses and genes involved in the maintenance of chromosomal DNA. It must be remembered
that any discussion of gene gain has to include a mention
of gene loss: without an appropriate outgroup and phylogeny, it is hard to determine whether extra genes that
appear to have been gained in a particular lineage might
have that appearance due to multiple gene losses in other
lineages.

Methods
Data
We collected the complete genomes of eleven Vibrionaceae
species (Table 1). The Genbank annotation was integrated
with genome information collected from the J. Craig Venter institute's (JCVI) Comprehensive Microbial Resources
Genomics database http://cmr.jcvi.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/
CmrHomePage.cgi
and
NCBI
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genome.
Sequence similarity search and identification of LSE
families
To identify the presence of orthologous and paralogous
genes, we merged all proteins of eleven Vibrionaceae
genomes and conducted an exhaustive all-against-all
BLASTP search; genes were defined as orthologous or paralogous if (1) they had a FASTA E-score < e-10; (2) their
similarity I was ≥ 30% if the length of the alignable region
L ≥ 150 amino acid residues, or I = 0.01n + 4.8L(0.32(1+exp(-L/1000))), if L <150 aa, where n = the
number of sequences); (3) the length of the alignable
region between the two sequences was >50% of the longer
protein [46]. A Markov cluster algorithm, OrthoMCL, was
used to cluster genes into gene clusters [47]. The gene clusters contain the orthologous and paralogous genes from
different genomes.

Multiple alignments of each clusters were obtained by the
program ClustalX [48] and T-coffee [49], followed by
manual inspection and editing. Phylogenetic trees were
inferred by the neighbor-joining method [50], using
MEGA4 http://www.megasoftware.net/[51]. The inferred
phylogenetic relationships were used to detect the orthologous and paralogous genes in each cluster. The clusters
with paralogous genes (duplicated copies from the same
genome) generated subsequent to the divergence of Vibrionaceae lineages analyzed are defined as lineage-specific
expansions (LSE) in each of eleven Vibrionaceae lineages.
Functional classification analysis
A hierarchical functional classification was performed for
each Vibrionaceae sequence by searching against the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) database [52]. The
classification of specific supergene families including
transporters, kinases, and proteases was based on the
standard nomenclature defined in the Transporter Classification (TC) system [53], the Kinase Classification System [54], and the Merops Peptidase Database [55].
