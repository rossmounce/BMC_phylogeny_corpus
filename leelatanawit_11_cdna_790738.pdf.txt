Abstract
Background: Poor reproductive maturation in captive male broodstock of the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus
monodon) is one of the serious problems to the farming industries. Without genome sequence, EST libraries of
P. monodon were previously constructed to identify transcripts with important biological functions. In this study, a
new version of cDNA microarray, UniShrimpChip, was constructed from the Peneaus monodon EST libraries of 12
tissues, containing 5,568 non-redundant cDNA clones from 10,536 unique cDNA in the P. monodon EST database.
UniShrimpChip was used to study testicular development by comparing gene expression levels of wild brooders
from the West and East coasts of Thailand and domesticated brooders with different ages (10-, 14-, 18-month-old).
Results: The overall gene expression patterns from the microarray experiments revealed distinct transcriptomic
patterns between the wild and domesticated groups. Moreover, differentially expressed genes from the microarray
comparisons were identified, and the expression patterns of eight selected transcripts were subsequently
confirmed by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Among these, expression levels of six subunits
(CSN2, 4, 5, 6, 7a, and 8) of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) gene family in wild and different ages of domesticated
brooders were examined by RT-qPCR. Among the six subunits, CSN5 and CSN6 were most highly expressed in wild
brooders and least expressed in the 18-month-old domesticated group; therefore, their full-length cDNA sequences
were characterized.
Conclusions: This study is the first report to employ cDNA microarray to study testicular development in the black
tiger shrimp. We show that there are obvious differences between the wild and domesticated shrimp at the
transcriptomic level. Furthermore, our study is the first to investigate the feasibility that the CSN gene family might
have involved in reproduction and development of this economically important species.

Background
Even though Thailand was a leading producer of cultured black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), generating
at least 200,000 metric tons with an income of over 2
billion USD annually in the nineties [1], the shrimp
industry has deteriorated due to widespread disease,
slow growth rate, and low quality broodstock.

The reproductive maturation of both males and
females of penaeid shrimp are poorly understood [2],
and the males have been studied even less than in the
females [3]. Reduced degrees of maturation are usually
observed in the captive brooders compared to the wild
brooders. For instance, when mated with wild males, the
wild females gave higher egg production and % fertilized
eggs than the pond-reared females. Similarly, when
mated with wild females, the wild males gave higher %
fertilized eggs and % nauplii than the pond-reared males
[4]. In females, the low degrees of reproductive

maturation in captivity can be relieved by unilateral eyestalk ablation technique that can induce ovarian development and ovulation [2]. However, the technique does
not affect the male reproductive maturation [5]. Moreover, there has not been any report on optimal age of
the males for mating though a previous study in P.
monodon suggested that age positively correlated to the
gonad weight, spermatophore weight, sperm count and
% normal sperm [6]. Therefore, it is important to understand fundamental differences in molecular mechanisms
between domesticated and wild-caught male broodstock
in order to improve farming conditions and sustain the
aquaculture of this species.
Various efforts have been made to study the fundamental mechanism of male reproduction in this species.
Leelatanawit et al. constructed subtractive cDNA
libraries of P. monodon ovaries and testes to identify
gender-specific transcripts [7]. Unfortunately, almost all
of the preferentially expressed ESTs in the P. monodon
testis were unknown transcripts (96.7%). A search for
genes differentially expressed in testes was continued by
constructing conventional and subtractive EST libraries
from testis of P. monodon to identify several reproduction-related genes such as PMTST1 (P. monodon testisspecific transcript 1), spermatogonial stem-cell renewal
factor, transformer 2 (Tra-2), progestin receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) and Dmc1 [8,9].
Recently, more testis ESTs (4,803 ESTs) were sequenced
and analyzed to indentify more testis-relevant genes in
this organism [10]. These previous studies started to
shed some light onto potential genes involved in testicular development. Yet, further investigation is needed to
understand this process in P. monodon.
Microarray technology can simultaneously monitor
gene expression levels of a large number of genes [11].
Previously, we have constructed a reproduction-specific
cDNA microarray (ReproArray GTS ) to study different
stages of the ovarian development of the black tiger
shrimp and able to identify many important reproduction-related genes exhibiting a differential expression
profile during its ovarian development such as nuclear
autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP) [12].
In this study, we have constructed another version of
microarray containing unigenes to include more genes
on the array for more diverse studies of this species.
This is the first report in the black tiger shrimp to use
the microarray technique to study testicular development. The microarray results identified differentially
expressed gene clusters which might be involved in differences between domesticated and wild-caught male
broodstock. Some of these genes (i.e. different isoforms
of constitutive photomorphogenic 9 signalosome (CSN))
were further characterized for their possible roles on
testicular development.

Results
Features of UniShrimpChip

A cDNA microarray, UniShrimpChip, was constructed
from 5,568 sequences of the previously established 12
EST libraries [13] and spotted in duplicate on each
microarray slide (Figure 1). A total of 260 control spots
include both positive (shrimp genomic DNA) and negative controls (buffer, bacteria DNA, virus DNA). The
highest numbers of features on UniShrimpChip was
sequences found in testis and ovary EST libraries (about
22% each) of P. monodon. A total of ~70% of the features were homologues of genes with putative known
functions (Figure 1). The features of UniShrimpChip
were further categorized according to the Gene Ontology (Figure 2A). The highest numbers of features
belonged to the “biological function” (42%) followed by
the “molecular function” (32%) and the “cellular components” (26%).
Large-Scale Gene Expression Analysis in Testis of Penaeus
monodon

UniShrimpChip was used to compare gene expression
profiles of testes from wild (West and East coasts of
Thailand) and domesticated brooders (Cy5, Red) by
using pooled testes from juveniles as a common references (Cy3, Green) (Table 1). From the total of the 18
microarray comparisons, the overall expression patterns
of every transcript were clustered to identify relationship
among the brooder types (Figure 3). Hierarchical cluster
revealed distinct differences in expression patterns
between wild and domesticated brooders. Among
domesticated shrimp at different ages, the 18-month-old
group was clearly clustered as a separated group from
the other cluster that contained both 10- and 14month-old shrimp; Figure 3A. However, if only gene
expression patterns of transcripts from the testis library
(1,076 transcripts) were considered, the hierarchical
cluster of array results was different (Figure 3B).
Although the wild shrimp (West and East) were still
clustered together and distinct from the domesticated
groups, the domesticated shrimp could be further
divided to 3 subgroups; 18-month-old shrimp alone, 14month-old containing a single individuals of 18-monthold and 10-month-old containing a single individual of
14-month-old shrimp. No correlation according to
gonadosomatic index (GSI) and ratio of sperm sac to
testis weights (SS/TT) was observed.
From all 5,568 features of UniShrimpChip, 3,455
transcripts were selected for further analysis as they
were present in at least 14 of the 18 microarrays
(~80% of all the arrays). Of these, 1,439 transcripts
exhibiting expression changes > 1.5 fold in at least 9 of
the 18 microarrays (50% of all the arrays) were clustered according to their expression patterns (Figure 4).

Figure 1 Summary of the tissue origin for the features used on the microarray (UniShrimpChip).

These differentially expressed transcripts were from
different EST library origins. The majority of these
genes were from testis (30.4%) and heart (28.9%),
whereas the remaining transcripts were from ovary
(14.8%), gill (10.7%), hemocyte (9.8%), hepatopancreas
(2.6%), intestine (1.0%), and others (1.7%) (Additional
file 1: Supplemental Figure S1).

From the 1,439 differentially expressed transcripts,
237 and 251 genes were expressed higher and lower in
the domesticated than the wild shrimp, respectively.
Comparing the expression levels between juveniles and
broodstock, the microarray results revealed 576 genes
with higher expression levels in juvenile, whereas only
85 genes were expressed higher in broodstock.

Figure 3 Cluster analysis of overall gene expression patterns from wild and domesticated male broodstock (A) using all transcripts on
the UniShrimpChip and (B) using only transcripts from testis ESTs. WBW and WBE are wild broodstock from the West and East coasts of
Thailand, respectively. DB10, DB14, and DB18 are 10-, 14, and 18-month-old domesticated broodstock, respectively. GSI is a gonadosomatic index
value calculated from the percentage of gonad weight by total body weight. SS/TT is a ratio of sperm sac weight to testis weight.

Hierarchical cluster analysis of these differentially
expressed transcripts revealed different gene groups
(Figure 4). Examples of selected gene groups with
different expression patterns were further examined
(Figure 4).
Besides the comparison between the wild and domesticated gene expression profiles, the differences in gene

expression levels among different ages within the
domesticated groups (10-, 14-, and 18-month-old brooders compared with juveniles, experiments III-V) were
also observed, albeit not as distinct. From the overall
expression patterns, the 18-month-old profiles seemed
different from the 10- and 14-month-old groups. For
instance, the expression levels of the 18-month-old

Figure 4 Gene expression analysis by the UniShrimpChip comparing P. monodon transcript levels in testis of wild broodstock from
the West and East coasts of Thailand (WBW and WBE, respectively), domesticated broodstock at 18, 14, and 10 months (DB-18, DB14, and DB-10, respectively) using testes pooled from 114 juveniles (JN) as a common reference. Testis from broodstock was labeled with
Cy5 fluorescent dye (red) and pooled testes from juveniles with Cy3 fluorescent dye (green). Hierarchical clustering analysis of the 1,439
transcripts present in at least 14 of the 18 microarrays and whose expression differences were greater than 1.5 fold in at least 9 of the 18
microarrays. Clusters 1-4 show examples of various patterns of differentially expressed transcripts. Transcripts in blue letters were further
characterized by quantitative real-time PCR.

domesticated samples in Cluster 3 were slightly lower
than the remaining samples from the domesticated
group (Figure 4). Interestingly, from the different gene
expression groups, a gene family of constitutive photomorphogenic 9 signalosome (CSN) homologs was presented in many clusters (Clusters I-III; Figure 4). The
differential expression patterns of these gene subunits
between the domesticated and wild groups raise a question whether they are involved in reproductive maturation in P. monodon.
Gene Expression Levels Confirmed by Reversetranscriptase Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)

Expression levels of CSN2, 4, 5, 6, 7a, and 8, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1(SUMO-1), and zipper homologues
in testes of wild broodstock (the Andaman Sea, West
and the Gulf of Thailand, East) and domesticated
broodstock (18, 14, and 10 months old) were confirmed
using reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR,
Figure 5) analysis.
Five CSN subunits (CSN4, 5, 6, 7a and 8) were present in the UniShrimpChip and their gene expression
levels exhibited differential patterns in the microarray
results. An additional subunit of this gene family, CSN
subunit (CSN2), was just found from the recently
sequenced testis cDNA library of P. monodon [10]; thus,

Page 7 of 16

the expression profiles of this subunit were included
with the five subunits for RT-qPCR analysis.
The expression levels of CSN4-6 in the wild brooders
obtained from the RT-qPCR agreed with the microarray
data. The most distinct expression levels of the testes
from the West coast of Thailand were significantly
higher than the rest (P < 0.05). With the domesticated
group of different ages, the expression levels of the
CSN2, CSN4, CSN5, CSN6 and CSN7a were lowest in
the samples of 18-month-old domesticated group; the
lower expression levels of the 18-month-old domesticated group were significant for the CSN2 and CSN5
transcripts (P < 0.05). Also, agreed with the microarray
results, the RT-qPCR results showed that the expression
levels of CSN7a and CSN8 exhibited no significant difference among the samples (P > 0.05). Moreover, among
the six subunits of the CSN genes studied in the work,
CSN2 and CSN8 were expressed at much lower levels
than other subunits (Figure 5A).
Besides the CSN gene family, two additional genes
(zipper and small ubiquitin-like modifier 1, SUMO-1),
representing different expression patterns were also validated by the RT-qPCR analysis. From the microarray
result, the zipper transcript was expressed higher in the
domesticated group than in the wild samples (Figure 4;
Cluster 1). The RT-qPCR results also revealed significantly higher expression levels of this transcript in the
domesticated group than in the wild brooders (P < 0.05;
Figure 5B). For SUMO-1, the microarray data suggested
comparable expression levels in all groups (Figure 4,
Cluster 2) which were confirmed by the RT-qPCR
results that the expression levels were not significantly
different (P > 0.05) in all samples tested (Figure 5B).
Full-length cDNA Sequences and Phylogenetic Analysis of
CSN5 and CSN6

Figure 5 Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR results of (A)
CSN subunits, (B) zipper and SUMO-1. Black and patterned black
bars are relative expression levels of wild broodstock from the West
and East coasts of Thailand, respectively. Grey, lined grey and
dotted grey bars are relative expression levels of domesticated
broodstock (DB) at 18-, 14-, 10-month-old, respectively. Different
letters above each bar designate significant differences in
expression level (P < 0.05).

The full-length cDNA sequence of the CSN gene family
has never been reported in any crustacean. In this study,
the full-length ORF of PmCSN5 and PmCSN6 (accession
numbers are HQ416699 and HQ416700, respectively)
were successfully isolated by RACE-PCR. For the
PmCSN5, an ORF of 1,056 bp corresponding to 351
amino acids, with 5’UTR and 3’UTR of 199 and 459 bp
(excluding the poly A tail), respectively, were identified
(Figure 6). The predicted pI and molecular weight
(MW) of the deduced CSN5 protein were 5.94 and
39.74 kDa, respectively. The closest similarity of this
transcript was CSN5 of Apis mellifera (E-value = 1e149). For the PmCSN6, the full-length cDNA sequence
contains an ORF of 1,101 bp corresponding to 366
amino acids with 5’UTR and 3’UTR of 80 and 239 bp
(excluding the poly A tail), respectively (Figure 7). The
predicted pI and MW of the deduced PmCSN6 were
5.32 and 40.27 kDa, respectively. The closest similarity

sequences of CSN5 (1,255 bp; ORF 1,056 bp, 351 aa) of P.
monodon. Start (ATG) and stop (TAA) codons are illustrated in
boldface and underlined. The deduced CSN5 protein contained a
JAB/MPN (positions 64-201, E-value = 2.85e-50; highlighted).

of the PmCSN6 transcript was CSN6 of Xenopus laevis
(E-value = 1e-107). Both of the deduced PmCSN5 and
PmCSN6 proteins contained a JAB/MPN domain (positions 64-201 with E-value = 2.85e-50 and positions 78212, E-value = 1.68e-15, respectively; Figure 6 and 7).
A bootstrapped neighbor-joining tree indicated that
vertebrate CSN5s are extremely conserved across different taxa (Figure 8). The newly characterized PmCSN5
was phylogenetically recognized as a member of invertebrate CSN5s. Although it showed the closest similarity
with Apis mellifera CSN5s based on sequence similarity
comparison, they are distantly related among each other
phylogenetically. In addition, both PmCSN5s and
AmCSN5s are more differentiated from other invertebrate CSN5s than that of other species. Interestingly,
PmCSN6 was phylogenetically allocated to a member of
the vertebrate rather than the invertebrate CSN6s along
with that of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Ixodes
scapularis (Figure 9).

Figure 7 The full-length cDNA sequence and deduced protein
sequences of CSN6 (1,420 bp; ORF 1,101 bp, 366 aa) of P.
monodon. Start (ATG) and stop (TAA) codons are illustrated in
boldface and underlined. The deduced CSN6 protein contained a
JAB/MPN (positions 78-212, E-value = 1.68e-15; highlighted).

demonstrated in identification of differentially expressed
genes possibly involved in different testicular development degrees in wild and domesticated male P. monodon
brooders. The gene expression profiles of the wild brooders from West and East coasts of Thailand and domesticated brooders with different ages (10-, 14-, and 18month-old) were compared to a same reference of testes
pooled from 114 juvenile shrimp.
With every gene on the array, their overall gene
expression patterns indicated the wild brooders, especially if they were from the same coast, exhibited similar
patterns, whereas the domesticated groups expressed
distinctively from the wild groups. Although actual differences between captive and wild male brooders are
not well understood and some suggested no difference
in sperm quality between the two [14], other early
reports indicated that wild-caught brooders have higher
reproductive success than in the captive counterparts
[15,16]. Another study reported that using wild instead
of captive males with either wild or domesticated
females has successfully resolved a problem from low
quality of offspring (B. Withyachumnarnkul, personal
communication). Moreover, captive male P. monodon
yields lower fertilization rates of zygotes and lower survival rates of offspring than wild male P. monodon [17].

The differences in the overall gene expression patterns
between the wild and captive male brooders provide
additional evidence to support that the difference in
reproductive performance of the wild and captive broodstock might even be rooted at the transcriptomic level.
Considering the hierarchical clustering of differentially
expressed genes, many interesting patterns were identified. For instance, the higher expression levels in domesticated broodstock in Clusters I and II might include
genes whose functions are relevant to inhibiting maturation; therefore, their high expression levels might jeopardize the maturation levels in the captive male.
Consequently, these genes should be further examined
as they might be potential markers pinpointing maturity
levels in this animal.
Various origins of the differential expressed genes
from the microarray analysis confirm the versatility of
UniShrimpChip. Although it is not surprising many
(~30%) of the differentially expressed transcripts came
from testis library, ~70% of the differentially expressed
transcripts came from the other libraries combined. The
significant contributions from other tissue libraries
emphasize the benefit of including genes from various
organs on the arrays to provide additional coverage in
gene expression study.
Validation of Gene Expression Profiles by Reversetranscriptase Quantitative PCR (RT- qPCR)

To validate gene expression profiles of some selected
transcripts belonging to different gene groups in microarray data, reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RTqPCR) was performed for zipper, SUMO-1, and six CSN
genes. The RT-qPCR results mostly agreed with microarray results.
The expression levels of SUMO-1 in different brooder
groups were validated by RT-qPCR, and its relatively
stable expression levels from the RT-qPCR were in
accord with the microarray result. SUMO-1 was first
reported in P. monodon from the testis EST analysis and
its transcript levels were found to be significantly lower
in the domesticated than in the wild male brooders [9].
Similarly, we found the similar trend between the wild
(West) and the domesticated samples, albeit not significantly different. The discrepancy between the previous
and our reports could be explained by different of samples used in each study; for instance, the age of domesticated samples was not reported in the previous study.
For zipper, its higher transcript levels in domesticated
than in the wild group from the microarray data were
confirmed by the RT-qPCR. In Drosophila, zipper
encodes for a conventional non-muscle myosin heavy
chain, NMMHC [18,19] whose functions involved in
embryonic development [20]. The homologues of zipper
are expressed in many species such as in chickens

Page 11 of 16

[21,22] and in humans [23],. Recently, Simons et al.
reported that the two NMMHC-encoding genes were
expressed differently in some rat tissues such as in brain
and testis [23]. Though an actual function in testis of
this gene family has not been established, the significant
differences in expression levels between the wild and
domesticated groups in our study might suggest that
this gene could serve as a candidate biomarker indicating different maturation levels in testicular development
in P. monodon brooders. Further characterization of this
gene should be pursued to understand its molecular
mechanism in testicular maturation and examine its
roles on lower degree of male reproduction in captive
brooders.
Another group of genes that were investigated
through the RT-qPCR analysis was the CSN gene family.
In addition to the five subunits (CSN4, 5, 6, 7a, 8)
included in UniShrimpChip, CSN2 found from the testis
EST library was also examined by the RT-qPCR. Compared to their expression patterns in the UniShrimpChip, the expression patterns of the five CSN genes
were confirmed by the RT-qPCR results. The higher
expression patterns of the CSN4-6 in the wild, especially
from the West coast, than in the domesticated groups
could suggest their relevance to the better testicular
development of the West wild brooders. If these genes
are involved in boosting testicular development, the significantly decreased expression levels of the CSN5 and
CSN6 transcripts in the 18-month-old domesticated
brooders from both microarray and RT-qPCR results
would imply that the optimal mating age should be
before 18 months. This information can be very useful
for the P. monodon farming practice because an optimal
age for reproductive maturity of a male brooder is not
determined. In another related shrimp species Litopenaeus vannamei, a male brooder at 12 months is considered to give highest sperm quality based on
spermatophore weight, sperm count, and percentage of
normal sperm [24]. Therefore, the decrease in expressions of potential maturation-related genes at 18 months
would be an undesired condition.
The COP9 signalosome (CSN) was first found in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that exhibited constitutive
photomorphogenesis, and hence its initial name as constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) [25]. There are
eight subunits of CSN found so far but not all eight subunits were found in all organisms [26]. In P. monodon,
only six CSN subunits (CSN 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) were found
in the testis, ovary, hemocyte, and gill EST libraries
[10,13]. The homologs of CSN1 and CSN3 have not
been found in P. monodon.
Due to different names of COP9 signalosome homologues in various organisms, the names have been unified to CSN [27], whose system has been adopted in

Leelatanawit et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/15

our study. Although the functions of the CSN are not
well understood, there are many reports linking CSN
with 19S proteasome based on their evolutionary relationship sharing the same number of eight subunits
[28]. Some studies reported that E3 ubiquitin ligases
were found to interact with the CSN, suggesting that
CSN may function in assembling SCF (Skp1-cullin-Fbox protein) complexes by bridging E3s and the proteasome [29-31]. However, clear biochemical and functional evidence of these hypotheses must be further
verified.
From other previous studies in various organisms, loss
of certain individual CSN subunits resulted in distinct
phenotypes, suggesting that individual CSN subunits
may have different and independent roles. For instance,
in Drosophila, CSN has been implicated in oogenesis,
embryogenesis, and neuronal development [32-34]. In
rat testis, CSN1 was expressed differently at different
developmental stages [35]. These links between some of
these CSN subunits and testicular development in other
organisms raise a question whether these genes are also
involved in the male reproductive process of the black
tiger shrimp.
The Full-length cDNA Sequences of the CSN5 and CSN6

Among the CSN genes, CSN5 and CSN6 were expressed
significantly lower in the 18-month-old domesticated
group than any other groups but higher in the wild
brooders from the West coast. Therefore, their fulllength cDNA sequences were further characterized by
RACE-PCR. For the first time in crustacean, the fulllength CSN5 and CSN6 cDNA sequences were successfully characterized and revealed a JAB/MPN domain in
both deduced proteins. This domain is one of the signature domains of a proteasome which was first observed
at the N-terminus of the yeast proteins Mpr1p and
Pad1p [36]. Among the eight subunits of the CSN, two
subunits (CSN5 and CSN6) contain the JAB/MPN
domain, whereas the remaining subunits contain a PCI
domain [37]. The CSN5 homolog, JAB1, has been found
in mouse and its RNA expression in testes was noticeably abundant in mouse embryonic tissue [38]. In Drosophila, the disruption of CSN5 gene resulted in lethality
at the late larval or pupal stage, suggesting its essentiality for the development to the adult stage [34]. While
CSN5 homologs in various organisms have been linked
to reproduction and development, there are less numbers of reports linking CSN6 to reproduction. Instead,
CSN6 was linked to apoptosis in vertebrates. When a
cytoplasmic protein, Nod1, is activated as a part of
apoptotic pathway to provide immune response against
invading pathogens in mammals, CSN6, was cleaved
from the COP9 complex, jeopardizing the complex’s
functions [39].

Page 12 of 16

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that CSN5 is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates and most invertebrates.
Nevertheless, PmCSN5 was more differentiated from that
of the other members of the Insecta (bootstrapping value
of 63%). The molecular phylogeny reflects distant relationships between crustaceans and insect which is in agreement with that based on the conventional systematics. In
contrast, P. monodon, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and
Ixodes scapularis CSN6s were allocated to be evolutionarily closer to the vertebrate than the invertebrate CSN6s
(bootstrapping values of 65, 69 and 71%, respectively).
This should not be the artifact from the phylogenetic analysis but the data implied that CSN6 in these and other
invertebrates may be encoded by different loci. Southern
blotting should be applied to determine whether PmCSN6
is encoded from more than one locus. However, this is
beyond the scope of our present study.

Conclusions
In summary, UniShrimpChip, a cDNA microarray containing non-redundant sequences of the P. monodon
unigenes, was successfully constructed and employed in
a high-throughput comparative gene expression analysis
to identify genes potentially involved in the reproductive
maturation differences between male brooders from the
wild and domestication. Through comparison between
different groups of male brooders (wild from the West
and East coasts of Thailand and domesticated at 10, 14,
18 months), several genes were identified to exhibit differential expression patterns. Among those genes, the
gene expression levels of SUMO-1, zipper, and six CSN
genes were further validated by RT-qPCR and the
results mostly agreed with the microarray data. Because
of their significant decreased transcript levels in the 18month-old captive brooders, the full-length cDNA
sequences of the two CSN genes, CSN5 and CSN6, were
further characterized to compare with other organisms.
This study demonstrates the usefulness of the UniShrimpChip for comparative gene expression study. For
the first time, the findings reveal the possibility of the CSN
gene homologs to be involved in testicular maturation and
development in the black tiger shrimp. Though further
studies to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms of these
genes in testicular development are required, through
microarray technique, these results open a new door to
narrow down candidate genes relevant to an important
developmental process of this important animal.
Methods
Unigene Assembly and EST Clone Selection

Unigenes and contigs of previously sequenced ESTs
from the P. monodon EST database (PmDB: http://pmonodon.biotec.or.th) were analyzed using ESTplus, an
integrative system for comprehensive and customized

Leelatanawit et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/15

EST analysis and proteomic data matching [40,41]. An
e-value <1e-05 was taken to indicate a significant probability of homology for both nucleotides and amino
acids. The sequences were grouped in different gene
ontology categories according to [42] using a universal
tool for annotation, visualization and analysis, Blast2GO
[43]. These unigenes and contigs were identified for the
synthesis of array probes. If the plasmids containing
these sequences were available from the EST libraries,
the plasmids were used as templates for probe amplification. Otherwise, gene-specific primers were designed
for amplification from the first strand cDNA using Primer3 program [44]. Primer sequences are available on
requested.
Microarray Probe Synthesis and Fabrication

In total, 5,568 sequences were amplified by PCR
method, which was carried out in a 96-well PCR plate
(Axygen) using a Veriti 96 well Thermocycler (ABI). For
the plasmid template, a reaction mixture contained 0.3
mM dNTPs, 1× PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.4 μM each
of LM13-F (5’-CACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGC
CAG-3’) and LM13R (5’-CATGGTCATAGCTGTT
TCCTGT-3’), and 1.25 U of i-Taq™ DNA Polymerase
(iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc; Korea). The PCR reactions
were carried out for 35 cycles at the following settings:
94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 25 s, and 72°C for 3 min. For the
first strand cDNA template, The PCR reactions contained 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1× PCR buffer, 0.6 μM each
gene-specific primer. Amplification was carried out for
38 cycles at the following settings: 94°C for 30 s, 57°C
for 60 s, and 72°C for 3 min. Five microliters of the
amplicons were electrophoretically analyzed in a 1%
agarose gel prepared in 0.5× TBE buffer. The PCR products were purified using MultiScreen® PCR 96 (Millipore) filtration plate method, air-dried and resuspended
with 7 μl 3× SSC (Invitrogen) giving the approximate
concentration of 250-500 ng/μl. The plates were covered
tightly and left at 4°C overnight. The resuspended products were transferred from 96-well to 384-well print
plates using a liquid handler Multi Probe II Plus Ex
(PerkinElmer). The cDNA microarrays were fabricated
using Nanoprint LM210 microarray spotter (ArrayIt,
USA) equipped with 24 pins (946MP3) in a 4 × 6
arrangement on GAPS II amino-silane coated slides
(CORNING). Each amplicon was spotted in duplicate.
The printed slides were UV-crosslinked at 200 mJ of
energy (GS Gene Linker UV chamber, BIO-RAD) and
stored at room temperature in a dry incubator.
Post-processing, Labeling, Hybridization and Analysis

The slides were post-processed to block unused surfaced
using a BSA-based method as previously described [12].
DNase-treated RNA samples were converted to the

Page 13 of 16

first-strand cDNAs and labeled with aminoallyl-dUTP
(aa-dUTP; Sigma) using a LabelStar Array kit (Qiagen).
The aa-dUTP samples were cleaned up using a Microcon YM-30 filter (Millipore) and resuspended in 6 μl of
0.1 M sodium borate buffer (pH 8.7). The aa-dUTP
cDNA was fluorescently labeled with Cy3- or Cy5- dyes
(GE Healthcare) at room temperature for 1 h. The unincorporated dye was removed using a Microcon YM-30
filter and the purified probe was resuspended in 6 μl of
TE. The Cy3- and Cy5- samples were mixed together in
a hybridization buffer (Pronto! Microarray hybridization
kit, CORNING) in 30 μL of reaction volume solution
and denatured at 95°C in the dark for 3 min before
applying onto the post-processed slide with a glass
cover slip (22 × 32 mm, Deckglasser) for each
experiment.
Hybridization was performed overnight (12-16 hr) in a
sealed hybridization chamber (CORNING) at 42°C. The
hybridized arrays were immersed into a pre-warmed
washing buffer I (2× SSC and 0.1% SDS) to remove a
cover slip before transferred to wash in the same buffer
for 5 min with gently shaking. The arrays were washed
in a washing buffer II (0.2× SSC) and a washing buffer
III (0.05× SSC) for 5 min each at a room temperature
with gently shaking. The arrays were then dried by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature
(Allegra X-22 R, Beckman coulter).
The hybridized slides were scanned with GenePix
4000B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and processed using GenePix Pro version 6.1. The data analysis
process was described previously [12]. The microarray
data have been deposited in NCBIs Gene Expression
Omnibus with GEO accession number GSE21890 at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.
RNA Samples and Microarray Experiments

Total RNA was extracted from P. monodon organs using
TRI-Reagent according to manufacturer’s instruction
(Molecular Research Center, USA). Contaminated genomic DNA was removed by treatment with DNase I (0.15
U/μg total RNA) at 37°C for 30 min. The quality and
quantity of the RNA were assessed on conventional
agarose based electrophoresis and NanoDrop (ND-8000)
before labeling for microarray experiments.
For all microarray experiments in this study (Table 1),
all Cy3 samples were from testis samples pooled from
114 individuals of 4-month-old juveniles.
For experiments I-II, Cy5 sample was testis from individual wild-caught male brooder from Andaman Sea
(West, n = 3) and Gulf of Thailand (East, n = 3),
respectively.
For experiments III-V, Cy5 sample was testis from
individual domesticated brooder at different ages (18-,
14-, and 10-month-old, respectively; n = 4 for each age

group) from the Broodstock Multiplication Center
(BMC, Burapha Univeristy, Chanthaburi province,
Thailand).
Reverse-transcriptase Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)

Gene-specific primers with the expected product of 120150 bp long were designed for each transcript (Table 2).
For construction of the standard curve of each transcript, a plasmid containing the transcript was constructed by the cloning the PCR product of the
transcript into a pGEM-T easy vector and transforming
the resulting vector into E. coli JM109. The plasmid was
extracted and used as the template for construction of
the standard curve by 10-fold serial dilutions (10 3-109
copy numbers). Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR) reactions were carried out in the strip tubes.
Subsequently, RT-qPCR was used to analyzed expression levels of the transcripts in testes from juveniles (JN,
4-month-old, n = 6), 10-month-old domesticated broodstock (DB) with an average gonadosomatic index (GSI
calculated from the percentage of gonad weight from
body weight) of 0.69 ± 0.25 (n = 5), 14-month-old DB
(average GSI = 0.51 ± 0.05; n = 5), 18-month-old DB
(average GSI = 0.53 ± 0.21; n = 7), wild broodstock
from Andaman Sea (West) and Gulf of Thailand (East)
(average GSI = 1.14 ± 0.26 and 0.74 ± 0.12, respectively;
n = 5 for each group) Each reaction was performed in a

20-μl total reaction volume containing 2× iQ™ SYBR®
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 200 ng of first strand cDNA
template, and 0.2 μM of each primer. Cycling parameters were 95°C for 2.5 min; followed by 40 cycles of
95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 30 s. The specificity of PCR products was confirmed by melting curve
analysis performed from 55°C-95°C with a continuous
fluorescent reading with every 0.5°C increment. The
relative expression levels of copy number of the target
gene to that of a housekeeping gene EF-1a in different
sample groups were statistically tested by ANOVA followed by Duncan’s new multiple range test or Tukey
test (P < 0.05). Note that EF-1a have been widely used
as a housekeeping gene for gene expression profile analysis in P. monodon [10,45-53].
Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RACE-PCR) of CSN5 and CSN6

Gene-specific primers for RACE-PCR of P. monodon
CSN5 and CSN6 were designed (Table 2). RACE-PCRs
of these genes were carried out using a BD SMART
RACE cDNA Amplification Kit following the protocol
recommended by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences
Clontech). The amplified fragment of each gene was
electrophoretically analyzed, purified from an agarose
gel before cloning into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega)
and sequenced (Sambrook and Russell, 2001). The full-

Phylogenetic analysis of PmCSN5 and PmCSN6

The amino acid sequences of P. monodon CSN5 and
CSN6 proteins were phylogenetically compared with
those from other species found in GenBank http://ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov. Multiple alignments were carried out with
ClustalW [54]. Bootstrapped neighbor-joining trees [55]
were constructed with the Seqboot, Prodist, Neighbor,
and Consense routines in PHYLIP http://evolution.gs.
washington.edu/phylip.html and appropriately illustrated
with Treeview http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/
treeview.html.
