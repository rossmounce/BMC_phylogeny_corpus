Abstract
Background: Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein's (IRBP) remarkable module structure may be
critical to its role in mediating the transport of all-trans and 11-cis retinol, and 11-cis retinal between rods,
cones, RPE and Müller cells during the visual cycle. We isolated cDNAs for Xenopus IRBP, and expressed
and purified its individual modules, module combinations, and the full-length polypeptide. Binding of alltrans retinol, 11-cis retinal and 9-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acid were characterized by fluorescence
spectroscopy monitoring ligand-fluorescence enhancement, quenching of endogenous protein
fluorescence, and energy transfer. Finally, the X-ray crystal structure of module-2 was used to predict the
location of the ligand-binding sites, and compare their structures among modules using homology
modeling.
Results: The full-length Xenopus IRBP cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 1,197 amino acid residues
beginning with a signal peptide followed by four homologous modules each ~300 amino acid residues in
length. Modules 1 and 3 are more closely related to each other than either is to modules 2 and 4. Modules
1 and 4 are most similar to the N- and C-terminal modules of the two module IRBP of teleosts. Our data
are consistent with the model that vertebrate IRBPs arose through two genetic duplication events, but
that the middle two modules were lost during the evolution of the ray finned fish. The sequence of the
expressed full-length IRBP was confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The
recombinant full-length Xenopus IRBP bound all-trans retinol and 11-cis retinaldehyde at 3 to 4 sites with
Kd's of 0.2 to 0.3 μM, and was active in protecting all-trans retinol from degradation. Module 2 showed
selectivity for all-trans retinol over 11-cis retinaldehyde. The binding data are correlated to the results of
docking of all-trans-retinol to the crystal structure of Xenopus module 2 suggesting two ligand-binding sites.
However, homology modeling of modules 1, 3 and 4 indicate that both sites may not be available for
binding of ligands in all four modules.
Conclusion: Although its four modules are homologous and each capable of supporting ligand-binding
activity, structural differences between their ligand-binding domains, and interactions between the
modules themselves will be critical to understanding IRBP's complex role in the visual cycle.

Background
The transport of retinoids and fatty acids between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retina is critical to
photoreceptor development, structure and function. The
exchange of visual cycle retinoids and possibly fatty acids
between these two cell layers is mediated by interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) [reviewed in [15]]. IRBP is the most abundant protein component of the
interphotoreceptor matrix, the extracellular material separating the RPE and retina. In contrast to most retinoidbinding proteins, which are present in a wide variety of
tissues, IRBP is expressed uniquely by cells of photoreceptor origin [6-10].
Within the matrix IRBP may have several roles in mediating the transport of retinoids in the visual cycle. By binding retinoids, IRBP solubilizes all-trans retinol and 11-cis
retinal while protecting these retinoids from isomeric and
oxidative degradation [11]. IRBP also appears to support
the removal of all-trans retinol from bleached outer segments [12], delivery of all-trans retinol from rods to the
RPE [13], and the transfer of 11-cis retinal from the RPE to
the rods [14-17]. Finally, IRBP may have an important
although little-understood role in retinal development
[1,18-20], and fatty acid trafficking [21-23].
IRBP is large (135 kDa in human) compared to other
retinoid-binding proteins [24]. For example, serum retinol-binding protein is 21 kDa (183 amino acid residues).
IRBP's size is partly due to the fact that its gene is composed of multiple homologous repeats. Each repeat codes
for a module of ~300 amino acid residues. Mammalian
and avian IRBPs are composed of 4 modules. In contrast,
teleost IRBPs contain only two modules [25,26]. In all vertebrate classes examined to date, IRBP's three introns are
located in the repeat coding for the C-terminal module.
This suggests that IRBP arose through the quadruplication
of an ancestral gene composed of 3 exons [25,27,28].
The African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, offers unique
advantages to studies of IRBP structure and function. The
large size of its photoreceptors facilitates morphological
analysis, and its eyecups are metabolically active for
extended periods [29]. Unlike other amphibians, the
Xenopus retina can be detached in both light- and darkadapted animals. Remarkably, the detached retina may be
re-constituted allowing the introduction of molecules
into the adult subretinal space [30,31]. Molecules may
also be introduced into the embryonic subretinal space
through optic vesicle injections [32]. One of the most
exciting advances is that the Xenopus retina is particularly
amenable to transgenic manipulation [29,33-38]. Finally,
X-ray crystallographic studies have recently determined
the structure of the second module of Xenopus IRBP [39].
This advance taken together with the genetic and cellular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/15

advantages of Xenopus as an experimental system promise
to uncover the mechanism of IRBPs function in the retina.
Here, we isolated and sequenced a full-length cDNA for
Xenopus IRBP, and used this gene to express the individual
modules, double modules, and the full-length Xenopus
IRBP in E. coli. We generated atomic models of modules 1,
3 and 4 by homology modeling and docked all-trans retinol molecules in all four modules to examine the location
and properties of possible ligand-binding sites. Our main
finding is that although in terms of function and evolution the modules appear to represent fundamental units
of IRBP, each module contains two qualitatively different
ligand-binding domains. Furthermore, the corresponding
domains between modules have different biochemical
properties and non-identical local structures. Finally,
interactions between the modules will likely provide
important information toward understanding the structure of IRBP and its role in the visual cycle.

Results
Molecular cloning and sequence analysis
Using a human IRBP cDNA as a probe, we previously isolated by low stringency hybridization screening a Xenopus
IRBP cDNA (XenB1) corresponding to the fourth (C-terminal) module of the protein [40]. Here, XenB1 was used
to screen under high stringency conditions a stage 45
Xenopus cDNA library enriched for full-length transcripts.
The longest IRBP cDNA isolated (Xen10a) was 4,046 base
pairs in length. This is consistent with Northern blot studies showing that the mRNA for Xenopus IRBPis approximately 4.2 kb in size [40]. The partial length XenB1, and
full-length Xen10a cDNAs are shown diagrammatically in
Figure 1 together with their sequencing strategies.

Xen10a codes for a polypeptide of 1197 amino acid residues (Figure 2). The entire protein without its signal peptide has a calculated molecular mass of 132,689Da. The
sequence begins with a stretch of 22 N-terminal residues
(bold in Figure 2) with features characteristics of signal
recognition peptides [41]. The initiating methionine is
followed by two amino acid residues, which have a net
positive charge, and a hydrophobic domain ending in several polar residues.
Following the signal peptide, the cDNA sequence consists
of four homologous consecutive "repeats". Each repeat
codes for a "module" of ~300 amino acid residues (boxed
in Figure 2). All of the amino acid residues of Xenopus
IRBP, excluding the signal peptide and the C-terminal
four residues, can be assigned to one of the four homologous regions. This is illustrated in the dot-plot diagram of
Xenopus IRBP compared to itself (Figure 3A). The overall
structure of Xenopus IRBP is therefore similar to that of
mammalian IRBPs which are also composed of four modules, and different from that of teleosts which contain
only two modules. The relationship between the primary
structure of human, bovine, Xenopus, goldfish and
zebrafish IRBPs is shown by the distance tree in Figure 3B.
The distance segment separating teleost and Xenopus
IRBPs is considerably longer than that between Xenopus
and mammalian IRBPs. The longer distance is due in part
to the fact that teleost IRBP consists of only two modules.
Xenopus IRBP is placed with a high level of confidence
between that of mammals and teleosts in accordance with
known phylogenetic relationships.
The phylogenetic relationship between each of the IRBP
modules is shown in Figure 4. PanelA of this figure shows
the phylogenetic distances between the various modules
of Xenopus IRBP. The tree was rooted with module 4, the
ancestral module [27,42]. The tree demonstrates that
modules 2 and 4 are more closely related to each other
than either is to modules 1 or 3. IRBP modules from different animals are compared by the unrooted distance tree
in Figure 4B. The central branch point had a boot-strap
value less than 80 and was collapsed into polytomy. A distance tree constructed with the Neighbor method gave the
same general topography, except at the central branch
point. A parsimony analysis also produced a tree with the
same topography. Each of the Xenopus IRBP modules was
most similar to the correspondingly numbered module of
bovine and human IRBPs. In contrast, when compared to
goldfish and zebrafish IRBPs, the fourth module of Xenopus and mammalian IRBPs were most similar to the second module of IRBP in teleosts (green labeling in Figure
4B). The N-terminal modules always showed the highest
similarity between themselves in all of the species examined (purple labeling in Figure 4B). These observations
are consistent with the suggestion that the middle two

modules of teleost IRBP were lost during the evolution of
the ray-finned fish (actinopterygii) [25].
Searches of the GenPept database with consecutive residue fragments of the Xenopus IRBP sequence showed a
high level of similarity with other IRBPs in the database.
In addition, each of the modules showed similarity with
C-terminal processing proteases (CtpAs) [43], and enoylCoA hydratases (crotonases) [44,45] (data not illustrated). These observations taken together with X-ray crystallographic data from the second module of Xenopus
IRBP suggest that IRBP belongs to the CptA/crotonase
superfamily, and shares with other members of the family
a common ligand-binding domain to stabilize unique
hydrophobic molecules [1,39].
A glycosylation consensus site is present in modules 1 and
2 (white letters with black background in Figure 2). This
observation is consistent with the fact that bovine IRBP
contains asparagine-linked sialoligosaccharides [46]. Glycosylation differences between species could explain why
Xenopus IRBP (Mr = 124 kDa) [40] has a faster electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE compared to that of
bovine IRBP (Mr = 145 kDa) [47,48]. The role of IRBP's
sugar moieties, which appear unnecessary for its elongated shape, secretion, or ability to bind retinoids, is presently unknown [46].
The 3'-untranslated region of Xenopus IRBP, which is considerably shorter than that of mammalian IRBPs, contains
two typical polyadenylation signal sequences (bold and
boxed in Figure 2). The use of alternative signal sequences

for in IRBP has been shown in the rat retina where two
IRBP mRNAs of different lengths are expressed [49]. The
significance of these observations to regulating IRBP
mRNA stability is largely unknown.
Full-length Xenopus IRBP: expression, retinol protection
and binding parameters for all-trans retinol and 11-cis
retinaldehyde
A remarkable characteristic of the IRBP-thioredoxin
fusion proteins generated in this study was that they could
be expressed to a significant extent in a soluble and biochemically active form in E. coli. The use of thioredoxin as
a fusion partner was previously found to significantly
enhance the soluble expression of X4IRBP [50] compared
to X4IRBP without thioredoxin [51]. Here, we found that
this effect could be extended to the other modules, and to
the full-length Xenopus IRBP as well. A variety of proteins
ranging from receptors to enzymes have been expressed in
a soluble and active form as thioredoxin fusion proteins
[52]. We found that optimizing the induction temperature can further enhance the expression of IRBP in the
cytosol over that in the insoluble fraction. This effect,
which is related to the reduced aggregation of recombinant proteins at lower expression temperatures, has
been used to improve the solubility of a variety proteins
in E. coli [reviewed in [53]]. Although the lower temperatures required extended incubation times, the final quantity of recombinant protein produced remained
approximately the same as that generated at 37°C. The
optimum incubation times and temperatures are given in
Table 1. The recombinant proteins were purified by a
combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion

Figure 5 illustrates the expression and purification of the
full-length Xenopus IRBP-fusion protein. The overall yield
of purified full-length Xenopus IRBP was 47 nmoles per
liter of E. coli (Table 1). The sequence of the full-length
Xenopus IRBP was confirmed by LC-electrospray-tandem
mass spectrometry. For the full-length IRBP the mass/
charge ratio was determined for 43 peptides released from
an in gel trypsin digest of the fusion protein. The peptides
had mass/charge ratios corresponding to predicted trypsin
digest fragments. The locations of these fragments are
indicated by gray shading in Figure 2. The sequences of 5
selected peptides were determined by LC-MS/MS. In all
cases the amino acid sequences were identical to that predicted from the translated amino-acid sequence.

The Xenopus-IRBP fusion protein, which is to our knowledge represents the first full-length IRBP generated in a
prokaryotic system, binds and stabilizes visual-cycle retinoids. In Figure 6 the absorbance of the protein with bound
all-trans retinol is monitored at 325 nm (λmax of retinol)
as a function of time. Over 72 min., only a small drop in
absorbance was appreciated. This ability to maintain the
absorbance at 325 nm is characteristic of bovine IRBP,
and may be related to an activity in maintaining the oxidation state of retinol [11].
The binding parameters of retinoid-binding proteins
including IRBP may be determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. The method utilizes changes in quantum yield
occurring during ligand binding [54]. Such changes are
represented by enhancement of ligand fluorescence,
quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence, and transfer
of energy from protein to bound ligand. Fluorescence
enhancement occurs if the quantum yield of the ligand's
fluorescence is higher in the hydrophobic environment of
the ligand-binding domain compared to that outside of
the domain.
Figure 7 shows fluorescence titrations and spectra of alltrans retinol binding to full-length Xenopus IRBP. In panel

Fluorescence-binding studies of full-length Xenopus IRBP to all-trans retinol
Fluorescence-binding studies of full-length Xenopus IRBP to all-trans retinol. The concentration of Xenopus IRBP was
0.65 μM in each panel. A) Titrations of IRBP with all-trans retinol as followed by monitoring the increase in retinol fluorescence (excitation, 330 nm; emission, 480 nm). Retinol fluorescence in the presence of IRBP (❍, , Δ) is compared with that in
the presence of an fluorescence matched solution of N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide (ᮀ). The difference between these two
curves, the fluorescence enhancement (-●-), represents all-trans retinol bound to the protein. The curve is a nonlinear least
squares fit of Equation 1 to the binding data. Error bars are too small to be visualized. The number of binding sites per molecule of protein (N) was 3.19 ± 0.10 with Kdall-trans = 0.30 ± 0.05 μM (standard error of the mean). B). Emission spectra of apoand holo-IRBP (curves a and b, respectively) were obtained upon excitation at 280 nm in the presence of a 10 fold excess of alltrans retinol. The drop in emission at 340 nm represents quenching of the protein's intrinsic fluorescence. The emission at 480
(arrow) represents energy transfer to the bound retinol. C) Titration monitoring quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence
by bound retinol. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 280 and 340 nm, respectively. The inner filter effect has been
accounted for graphically as previously described (50) (-❍-, actual meausurements; -●-, after correction). Calculated binding
parameters: N = 1.93 ± 0.41; Kdall-trans = 0.66 ± 0.14 μM. D) Titration monitoring energy transfer (increase in fluorescence at

cence enhancement. The enhancement was determined
by subtracting the fluorescence of retinol in the presence
of an OD280 matched solution of N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide from that in the presence of IRBP. N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide, which from its indole ring has a typical
protein-like fluorescence, serves as a blank because it does
not significantly interact with retinol [55]. Equation 1 was
fit to the data by nonlinear least squares analysis. The
number of binding sites per molecule of IRBP was calcu-

lated to be 3.19 ± 0.10 with Kd = 0.30 ± 0.05 μM (Table
1I). Figure 7B shows emission spectra of apo- and holoXenopus IRBP (excitation = 280 nm). The lower emission
of the holoprotein at 340 nm represents protein quenching mainly due to tryptophan. Panel C shows the titration
monitoring the decrease in fluorescence at 340 nm (open
circles). A nonspecific decrease in fluorescence at this
wavelength, which is largely due to the inner filter effect,
is accounted for by graphical correction (dashed line) as

previously described [56]. Fitting equation 1 to the data
gives N = 1.93 ± 0.41, and Kd = 0.66 ± 0.14 μM. Finally,
Figure 7D monitors energy transfer (excitation, 280; emission, 480 nm) giving N = 3.72 ± 0.20, and Kd = 0.29 ± 0.12
μM.
We were interested in asking whether Xenopus IRBP or its
individual modules (see below) can discriminate between
all-trans retinol and 11-cis retinaldehyde. Compared to
studies using retinol, monitoring 11-cis retinaldehyde
binding is more challenging as it is not significantly fluorescent precluding measurements of fluorescence
enhancement. However, its binding can be measured by
following protein quenching, and its ability to displace
all-trans retinol. Figure 8A shows a titration of 11-cis retinaldehyde to the full-length Xenopus IRBP monitoring
protein quenching. The number of binding sties were calculated to be 1.81 ± 0.15 with a Kd 11-cis = 0.28 ± 0.05 μM
(Table 3).
In Figure 8B, full-length Xenopus IRBP was titrated with
all-trans retinol in the presence of different fixed concen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/15

trations of 11-cis retinaldehyde. Binding of all-trans retinol to Xenopus IRBP was followed by monitoring the
enhancement of its fluorescence. Note that increasing the
concentration 11-cis retinaldehyde resulted in a reduction
in the level of all-trans retinol fluorescence enhancement
(Figure 8B). Equation 3 (see methods) was used to analyze the data generating the 3-dimensional representation
of the fit shown graphically in Figure 8B. The number of
binding sites was calculated to be 3.53 ± 0.19 with Kd alltrans = 0.22 ± 0.13 μM and K 11-cis = 0.21 ± 0.10 μM (Table

Expression and ligand-binding properties of the individual
Xenopus-IRBP modules
Saturable binding for one to two all-trans retinol equivalents could be detected for each module. Often fewer sites
were detected by titrations following ligand quenching of
protein fluorescence compared to that monitoring retinol-fluorescence enhancement. This is because quenching
requires the presence of a tryptophan in the ligand-binding domain. In contrast, this residue is not required to
support ligand-fluorescence enhancement. The binding

11-cis retinaldehyde binding to full-length Xenopus IRBP. Since retinaldehydes are nonfluorescent compounds their
binding cannot be followed by ligand fluorescence enhancement or energy transfer. Here, the binding of 11-cis retinaldehyde is
followed by monitoring quenching of endogenous protein fluorescence, and indirectly by competition with the efficient fluorophore all-trans retinol. A) Representative titrations monitoring quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence by bound 11-cis retinaldehyde. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 280 and 340 nm, respectively. The inner filter effect was accounted for
by graphical correction as previously described [56] (-●-, before correction for inner filter effect; -●-, after correction). The
binding parameters were calculated to be: N = 1.81 ± 0.15; Kd11-cis = 0.28 ± 0.05 μM. B. Representative competition titration.
From each titration the emission of an 0.D.280 matched solution of N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide was subtracted. Binding parameters: N = 3.53 ± 0.19 with Kdall-trans = 0.22 ± 0.13 μM; Kd11-cis = 0.21 ± 0.10 μM.

parameters for all-trans retinol derived from enhancement
and quenching titrations are shown in Table 2 for each
module, and the full-length Xenopus IRBP. The equilibrium dissociation constants ranged from 0.084 ± 0.022
μM (module 2) to 1.79 ± 0.54 μM (module 4) (enhancement, Table 2). Monitoring fluorescence enhancement,
two sites could be detected in modules 3 and 4 (1.83 ±
0.42, 2.06 ± 0.53 sites respectively). 1.57 ± 0.04 were
detected in module 2. In contrast, only one site (N = 0.83
± 0.15) could be detected in module 1. Fewer sites were
detected in titrations monitoring quenching. For modules
1, 3 and 4, less than one site was detected. Only for module II was a full site detected by quenching (N = 1.31 ±
0.06). Thus, as with the full-length Xenopus IRBP, fewer of
the ligand-binding domains could be detected by fluorescence quenching compared to assays monitoring retinol
fluorescence enhancement.
The binding of 11-cis retinaldehyde was characterized by
competition with all-trans retinol (Figure 9, Table 3). The
binding parameters for all-trans retinol were similar with
those in Table 2 except for module 4 where the Kd was
0.41 ± 0.09 μM compared to 1.79 ± 0.54 μM in the
absence of 11-cis retinaldehyde. The reason for this differTable 3: Summary of 11-cis retinal binding parameters to IRBP. The

ence is not clear, but may represent an allosteric interaction in this module.
For the individual modules and full-length Xenopus IRBP,
the equilibrium dissociation constants for all-trans retinol, and 11-cis retinaldehyde were similar except for module 2. Here, the Kd for all-trans retinol and 11-cis
retinaldehyde were significantly different (0.074 ± 0.037
μM and 0.28 ± 0.13 μM respectively). This suggests that
module 2 has selectivity for all-trans retinol over 11-cis retinaldehyde. Molecular modeling studies described below,
indicate that the putative sites may provide highly ordered
environments perhaps discriminating between the isomeric configuration, oxidative state, or both of the ligand.
Ongoing studies will address these possibilities by preparing crystals of X2IRBP with bound ligand.
Why do the number of sites from individual modules add
up to more than that detected in the full-length IRBP?
Here we asked whether the number of sites within individual modules could at least predict the number in
recombinant proteins consisting of two modules. We had
originally anticipated that the sum of sites from individual modules would give the number in such "module
pairs". However, this turned out to be not always true. We
expressed and purified module combinations 1&2 and
3&4, termed X(1,2)IRBP and X(3,4)IRBP respectively.
Binding of all-trans retinol to these module pairs was characterized by fluorometric titrations monitoring retinolfluorescence enhancement (Figure 10). For X(1,2)IRBP, N
= 2.45 ± 0.11 (2.40 sites were predicted from the sum of
individual modules 1 plus 2). In contrast, N for
X(3,4)IRBP was 1.43 ± 0.21 sites (predicted, 3.83 sites).
These results are consistent with the notion that some of
the sites within individual modules are cryptic in the
intact full-length IRBP. That is, some sites may not be solvent exposed in the intact IRBP as they are within individ-

Competitive inhibition by 11-cis retinaldehyde of all-trans retinol binding to the individual modules of Xenopus IRBP
Figure 9
Competitive inhibition by 11-cis retinaldehyde of all-trans retinol binding to the individual modules of Xenopus
IRBP. Binding of all-trans retinol to the individual modules was measured by fluorescence enhancement in the presence of varying amounts of 11-cis retinal. Panels A through D correspond to modules 1 through 4 respectively. Assuming both all-trans
retinol and 11-cis retinal share the same binding sites, all-trans retinol binding to IRBP is competitively inhibited. Three dimensional nonlinear regression was used to determine the number of binding sites, the dissociation constant of all-trans retinol, and
the dissociation constant of 11-cis retinal for each of the individual modules. The binding parameters are summarized in Table
3. The concentrations of the proteins used in the titrations were as follows: module 1 (0.99 μM; panel A); module 2 (1.10 μM;
panel B); module 3 (1.10 μM; panel C); module 4 (1.00 μM; panel D).

ual modules. Interestingly, the affinity for retinol was
greater in the module pair compared to that in the individual module. The Kd's for modules 1 and 2 were 0.44
and 0.084 respectively. In contrast, the Kd for X(1,2)IRBP
was 0.049 ± 0.023 μM. Similarly, the Kd 's for modules 3
and 4 were 1.18 and 1.79 μM respectively. In contrast, the
Kd for X(3,4)IRBP was 0.19 ± 0.05 μM. These observations
suggest that the presence of more than one module may
be required for the specificity of individual ligand-binding
domains. Since the existing X-ray crystal structure of IRBP
is limited to only a single module (X2IRBP), we do not
know the quaternary structure, or how the modules fit
together to form the intact full-length IRBP. Therefore it is
plausible that some binding sites that are solvent exposed
in the individual module are buried in the intact module.
To address this question, ongoing studies in our laboratories are aimed at determining the X-ray crystal structure of
IRBPs composed of multiple modules.

To further characterize the recombinant Xenopus IRBP and
it modules, the fluorescent stearic acid analog, 9-(9anthroyloxy) stearic acid (9-AS) was used as a probe
(Table 4). 9-AS has been previously used to study the
fatty-acid binding properties of native bovine IRBP [58].
Monitoring the enhancement of 9-AS fluorescence upon
binding to the full-length Xenopus IRBP showed 2.58 ±
0.17 sites with Kd = 0.28 ± 0.07 μM. Although similar to
the affinity for all-trans retinol (0.30 ± 0.05 μM), the
number of sites detected with retinol was somewhat
greater (3.19 ± 0.10 sites) (Table 2). Interestingly, the
number of sites detected by monitoring protein quenching with all-trans retinol (1.93 ± 0.41 sites) was also
greater than that detected by quenching with 9-AS (0.18 ±
0.29 sites). Surprisingly, most of the individual modules
had a similar binding capacity for 9-AS compared to that
of the full-length protein (Table 4). This suggests the possibility that the fewer sites detected with 9-AS compared to

that with all-trans retinol in the full-length Xenopus IRBP is
due to the loss of a site typically supporting both fluorescence enhancement and quenching in the individual
module. Such a site appears to be present in the individual
modules, but can no longer be probed with 9-AS in the
full-length Xenopus IRBP. Ongoing structural studies of
the full-length IRBP should help to define the relationship
of these ligand-binding sites in the full-length IRBP.
Ligand docking and homology modeling
As structural data are not available for any of the modules
besides that of X2IRBP, we used homology modeling to
compare the structures of the individual modules. First,
molecular docking was used to predict the location of the
all-trans retinol binding sties in the known X2IRBP structure. The site finder routine identified the largest two cavi-

ties to have sizes 79 and 74 (in arbitrary units, designated
as sites I and II, respectively; the next cavity had a size of
42). Automated docking procedure and conformational
analysis yielded two best scoring poses for all-trans retinol, one at each site. These poses are shown in Figure 11.
In this figure, a docked molecule of all-trans retinol is
colored grey in site I, and blue in site II. Site I, which is
described by residues Ile80, Val99, Phe100, Phe114,
Gln116, Phe117, Ala118, Ile123, Leu126, Ala127, Ile130,
Val131, Trp135, Ala158, Leu161, Leu162, Tyr165 and
Leu196, is highly hydrophobic and consists of residues
residing almost entirely within the N-terminal A domain
[51]. However, site II, delineated by residues Pro62,
Arg63, Val65, Lys67, Asp71, Thr72, Leu73, Ser239,
Gly240, Met243, His244, Ser245, Val247, Thr258,
Leu273, Gly274 and Gly275, has a number of polar side
chains and is situated at the interface between the A and
the C-terminal B domains [51]. Site II, the hydrophobic
region between the two domains was previously thought
to represent the putative ligand-binding site within
X2IRBP [39]. Both sites I and II have a nearby Trp residue,
conserved among the functional units. It is therefore possible that both sites could support protein quenching.
For modeling structures of X1-, X3- and X4IRBP modules
by homology, the X2IRBP crystal structure was selected by
MOE as the best candidate through its automated PDB
database search and sequence alignment routines. Figure
11a shows the overall superimposed modeled structures
of modules X1-, X3-, and X4IRBP with the experimental
X2IRBP structure. Overall, the superposition demonstrates high homology among three-dimensional structures of all four modules, particularly among the α helices
and β sheets. Furthermore, from the superimposed structures it is clear that each module retains the locations of
both of the two cavities described above as the putative

ligand-binding sites predicted from the ligand-docking
analysis (Figure 11b,c).
The amino acid residues that line each of these cavities are
summarized in Table 5. This table lists the residues that
are conserved in the putative ligand-binding pockets
between each module, and those that are chemically different and/or would be predicted to sterically hinder retinol entry compared to the corresponding amino acid
residue in X2IRBP. Upon comparing the domains, it is
apparent that not only are sites I and II distinct, but the
corresponding sites in four modules also appear to display some differences. First, site I has a significantly more
hydrophobic character compared to site II. Secondly, site
II, which has a higher percentage of polar residues, shows
a more open binding pocket with less conservation of the
residues contributing to the ligand-binding domain compared to site I.
Structural differences between the sites in different modules are apparent upon comparing the amino acid residues contributing to these two putative ligand-binding
sites. In particular, at several positions, residues within
site I of X2IRBP have been replaced by bulkier residues.
Leu162 has been replaced by phenylalanines in modules
3 and 4 (Phe160 and Phe154 respectively), which cause
steric clash with the modeled retinol molecules. It is, thus,
likely that in modules X3IRBP and X4IRBP, site I for retinol binding does not exist. A difference at this position is
also noted for module 1 where the corresponding Leu162
has been replaced by Val159.
Site II, which is formed as a cleft between domains A and
B on antiparallel β-sheets between residues 245 and 260,
and the loop between residues and 241 and 245, also
shows differences among modules. Residues of other
modules that may interfere with the entry of retinol into

site II are X1IRBP, Leu65; X3IRBP, Glu75, Leu77; X4IRBP,
Phe55, Arg69. Another notable difference is that the loop
in module 1 between Pro63 and Pro71 has a conformation different from those in modules X2, X3 and X4. In
X1IRBP the loop has moved into the site II ligand-binding
pocket. Finally, the loop between amino acid residues 75
to 83 in X3IRBP is dissimilar compared to the corresponding loops in the other three modules.

Discussion
IRBP's structure consisting of internal homologous modules is unprecedented for a hydrophobic ligand-binding
protein [59,60]. Extra- and intracellular retinoid-binding
proteins typically do not have significant internal homology with duplication of ligand-binding domains, and
bind only one ligand equivalent per polypeptide [61,62].
This is also generally true of the fatty acid-binding proteins, and other members of the calycin superfamily [63].
It is possible that IRBP's interesting module structure is
related to the profound complexity of vitamin A trafficking in vision compared to other biological systems requiring extracellular retinoid transport. For example, serum
retinol-binding protein transports only one chemical type
of retinoid, all-trans retinol, in a unidirectional manner
from the liver to the RPE. In contrast, IRBP is thought to
mediate the bidirectional transport of several retinoid
types (all-trans retinol, 11 cis retinal, and 11-cis retinol)
between four cell types (rods, cones, RPE and Müller
cells). It is therefore plausible that IRBP's module structure may have a role in targeting the correct retinoid to the
intended cell type while protecting it from isomeric and
oxidative degradation. Our long-term goal is to uncover
the relationship between the structure and function of
IRBP in the visual cycle. Here, we focused on the Xenopus
IRBP homolog because an X-ray crystal structure is available for the second module in this species [39]. Furthermore, we anticipate that Xenopus will provide a valuable

system to study the function and trafficking of IRBP in the
retina using transgenic approaches.
The translated amino acid sequence of Xenopus IRBP
begins with a signal peptide suggesting that the synthesis
of the nascent IRBP begins with its insertion into the
endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, N-terminal
sequencing of IRBP from several species indicates that the
signal peptide is cleaved at a limited number of sites.
Although N-terminal sequence data of native Xenopus
IRBP is not available, frog IRBP is known to have a 3
amino acid residue extension [64]. The same cleavage
position would be predicted for the Xenopus IRBP signal
peptide [65]. The above observations are consistent with
immunohistochemical and biochemical studies showing
that Xenopus IRBP accumulates in the IPM following its
synthesis by the rods and cones [9,31,40,66,67].
Western blot studies have shown that native Xenopus
IRBP (Mr = 124 kDa) [40] is closer in size to IRBPs in
mammals (Mr = 146–135 kDa) [24,68-70] than to that in
teleost fish (Mr = 65–75) [25]. These observations are
explained by the present finding that Xenopus IRBP is
composed of 4 homologous segments each consisting of
~300 amino acid residues.
The Xenopus IRBP modules are related in specific ways to
each other and to known IRBPs. Comparing the Xenopus
modules to themselves, 2 & 4, and 1 & 3 are more similar
to each other. A model to explain this relationship begins
with the proposal that the IRBP gene arose through the
insertion of a reverse transcribed processed mRNA 5' to
the original gene [27]. After this first duplication event,
the amino acid sequences of the two resulting modules
diverged. A second duplication event occurring in the
same way as the first could explain why similar and dissimilar modules alternate with one another [1]. That is, a
reverse transcribed processed mRNA was inserted 5' to the
two repeat IRBP. This second duplication probably
occurred before, or early during the emergence of vertebrates since the size of skate and ray IRBPs suggests that
IRBP in elasmobranchs is composed of 4 modules
[71,72]. The quadruplication therefore occurred before
the emergence of bony fish (Osteichthyes) since cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes), which include elasmobranchs, diverged before the emergence of the bony fish
[73]. The dimodular teleost IRBP would then represent
the loss of two repeats during the emergence of the ray
finned fish (Actinopterygii). The similarity of the N- and
C-terminal modules of teleost IRBP with that of Xenopus
and mammals suggests that it was the middle two repeats
that were lost. The deletion probably occurred by homologous recombination, a common mechanism for the
elimination of DNA segments during the evolution of
complex proteins [74,75]. This model could be tested by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/15

examining IRBPs of extant early Actinopterygii, the Sarcopterygii fish (the direct ancestors of amphibians), and
the jawless fish (Agnatha).
The above model suggests that the IRBP modules contain
an important function that was copied during the evolution of its gene. Similar yet non-identical repeats, suggests
that the duplication events allowed for functional divergence. We therefore anticipated that each module should
have functional activity, yet this activity would not be
identical between modules. To study the modules independently, we expressed them separately, as pairs, and as
the full-length protein.
Full-length recombinant Xenopus IRBP had the expected
biochemical properties although the number of binding
sites was somewhat higher than that of native bovine
IRBP. Previous studies of bovine IRBP have reported values for N ranging from 1 to 2.6 sites per polypeptide. A
more recent study found evidence for 3 ligand-binding
sites in bovine IRBP [76]. This is consistent with the
present study where we detected 3.19 ± 0.10 sites in Xenopus IRBP.
Surface hydrophobicity representations of X2IRBP call
attention to two hydrophobic regions representing candidate ligand-binding domains [39]. Evidence that at least
one of these domains (site II) may have biological significance comes from its structural homology with the active
site of crotonases [77]. Superimposition of the structure of
X2IRBP with that of 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase complexed
with octanoyl-CoA suggests that site II in IRBP corresponds to the crotonase ligand-binding domain [39].
Although the precise biological function of site II in IRBP
is not established, molecular docking analysis placed a
molecule of all-trans retinol into its large shallow cleft.
Interestingly, the docking analysis also positioned an alltrans retinol molecule within the more deeply buried Nterminal hydrophobic domain of site I. These observations are consistent with studies showing that in bovine
IRBP, retinol is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions [78]. Nevertheless, there is evidence from the structure of site I that retinol's OH group could form a
hydrogen bond to Lys194 located nearby on the surface of
X2IRBP. Finally, our data are consistent with studies of
human IRBP showing that each module has one to two
ligand-binding sites [79-81].
Our homology modeling studies suggest that the two
putative ligand-binding sites identified by X-ray crystallography of X2IRBP are conserved in each of the other
three modules of IRBP. Although the significance of the
specific details awaits further experimental data, we can
say that the two sites based on their overall morphology
and local environment are structurally distinct and may

therefore have significantly different functions. It is highly
likely that not all four modules are involved in the same
functional role of ligand-binding and/or transportation
with similar efficiency. The amount of fluorescence
enhancement is different for the various modules. The
modules are also not equivalent in terms of their dissociation constants. The range of Kd all-trans s could reflect
unique demands of the visual cycle for supporting different levels of extracellular all-trans retinol flux occurring
during scotopic and photopic conditions. Of particular
interest is the apparent specificity of module 2 for all-trans
retinol over 11-cis retinaldehyde. Taken together, our
results suggest that the entire polypeptide chain possibly
functions as a single protein with multiple modules performing various tasks of binding, protection and transportation of ligands, or yet another unknown role. Finally,
one or both binding-sites may border other modules in
the full-length IRBP. Thus, physiologically triggered
changes in the quaternary structure of IRBP may allow significant changes in the availability of specific ligand-binding domains.

Conclusion
IRBP has a remarkable structure consisting of repeats or
modules of which there are four in Xenopus. This structure
is probably critical to understanding the role of IRBP in
the complicated physiology of retinoid trafficking
between rods, cones, RPE, and Müller cells in the visual
cycle. Our studies suggest that the module structure not
only provides for increased ligand carrying capacity, but
also allows for qualitative differences in the affinity, and
specificity of the binding domains within the individual
modules. Finally, although the modules may represent
functional units of the protein, our studies suggest that
important interactions between the modules may be critical to understanding the structure and function of the ligand-binding domains.

Methods
Library screening, cDNA isolation and sequence analysis
Using low stringency hybridization methods, we previously isolated a partial length cDNA corresponding to the
fourth module of Xenopus IRBP [40]. This cDNA, termed
XenB1, corresponds to the fourth or C-terminal module of
IRBP (see cDNA map in Figure 1). In the present study,
XenB1 was used to screen a Xenopus whole body stage 45
(33) swimming tadpole cDNA library generously provided by Dr.Douglas W. DeSimone (34). This λ Zap II
library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened under high
stringency conditions as described by Rajendran et al.
(1996) [25]. The cDNA was sequenced in pBluescript by
the dideoxy chain-termination method using synthetic
oligonucleotides and Sequenase version 2.0 (U.S.B.,
Cleveland, OH).

Sequence analysis and database searches were carried out
with the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (GCG).
The PileUp program of the GCG package was used to generate the alignments. The ends of the sequences were
weighted as gaps to reflect the alignment of the junction
between modules and the alignment of the stop codons.
Alignments used translated cDNAs of published C-terminal modules from human [82], bovine [27], goldfish [26],
and zebrafish [25] IRBPs. Phylogenetic distances between
the various IRBP modules were calculated by the ProtPars
and Fitch programs of the PHYLIP phylogenetic analysis
program package.
Expression of full-length Xenopus IRBP and its individual
modules as thioredoxin fusion proteins
The solubility of proteins expressed in E. coli can be
enhanced by the use of thioredoxin as a fusion partner
[52,83,84]. We expressed the full-length IRBP as well as its
individual modules as thioredoxin-fusion proteins using
pTrxFus and pThioHis vectors (Invitrogen, SanDiego,
CA). The pThioHis vector incorporates a histidine patch
on the surface of the thioredoxin [85]. cDNAs corresponding to the full-length IRBP, module 1, and module 2 were
expressed in pThioHis; modules 3 and 4 were expressed in
pTrxFus. IRBP cDNAs were amplified from Xen10a (Figure 1) using the oligonucleotides primers shown in Table
1. The amplified cDNAs were subcloned into the SmaI/Sal
I site of pTrxFus or into the Stu I/Sal I site of pThioHisA.
The pThioHis-IRBP constructs code for an additional
three amino acid residues (GDP) at the N-terminus. The
pTrxFus-IRBP construct codes for an additional 8 amino
acid residues (SYCSNRYG) at the C-terminus. The cDNA
corresponding to the fourth module has been described
[40] and was previously used to express that module as a
polyhistidine fusion protein in the pRSET system [51].
The cDNA was excised from pRSET with Bam HIand Nhe
I, which cut in the plasmid's multiple cloning region 5' to
the insert and in the cDNA's 3'-untranslated region,
respectively. The cDNA was ligated into the Bam HI/Xba I
site of pTrxFus. The pTrxFus and pThioHis constructs were
used to transform GI724 and GI698, and Top10 E. coli
respectively (InVitrogen) [86]. The reading frames of all
plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Pilot expression cultures confirmed the size of the recombinant protein and were used to optimize the temperature
and duration of protein expression. The thioredoxin
fusion proteins were released from the E. coli by subjecting
one ml of a 5.0 OD550 culture resuspended in 20 mM Tris
pH 8.0 2.5 mM EDTA to repeated sonication and flash
freezing in liquid N2 [86]. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated at 16,000 g and analyzed by SDS-(8–
10%)PAGE. The optimal temperature and incubation
times for each of the recombinant IRBPs is given in Table
I.

Preparative fermentations were carried out in a 7-L reactor
(Applikon, Foster City, CA). After the cells reached an
OD550 of 0.5, the temperature was lowered and isopropyl
β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration
of 1 mM. The incubation was continued for 4 to 21 hrs
depending on the protein being expressed (see Table 1).
The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended at 4°C in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl with
1 mM phenylmethysulfonyl-fluoride, 1.4 μM pepstatin A,
0.3 μM aprotinin, and 2 μM leupeptin as protease inhibitors. The bacteria were ruptured with a French pressure
cell, and the insoluble and soluble fractions separated at
12,000 g for 30 min at 4°C and stored at -80°C.

and elution were carried in the presence of 900 mM NaCl
to minimize nonspecific interactions with the resin. The
purified protein was dialyzed against PBS (137 mM NaCl,
2.7 mM KCl, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, 1.4 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3) before being frozen as aliquots in liquid
nitrogen (It was necessary to lower the salt concentration
before freezing the protein to prevent precipitation upon
thawing.). We found that one freeze/thaw cycle did not
change the binding parameters as measured by fluorescence enhancement, or quenching of endogenous protein
fluorescence or energy transfer. The frozen aliquots were
held at -80°C until use. We only used protein that had
been frozen and thawed no more than once.

For most fermentations of the individual modules,
approximately 75–85% of the product was present in the
soluble fraction. The exception was module 3 where only
15% of the product was expressed in a soluble form. For
this module we found that 90% of that in the insoluble
fraction could be recovered using a modification of a procedure commonly used for solubilization of glutathione
S-transferase fusion proteins [87]. The crude pellet was
resuspended in 5 mM DTT, 1% sarkosyl (N-dodecanoylsarcosinate), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris at
pH 8.0. Triton X used in the original description of the
method [87] was not necessary for the module 3-thioredoxin fusion protein.

The concentration of the purified IRBP in the stock frozen
aliquots was determined by amino acid analysis and UV
spectroscopy. The amino acid analysis was performed on
a PICO-TAG system (Waters, Milford, MA) using phenylisothiocyanate derivatives [91]. An internal standard was
included in each assay. For UV spectroscopy, extinction
coefficients were calculated for each of the recombinant
IRBPs from their amino acid sequence using a previously
described method (Table 1) [92,93]. The concentration of
the purified recombinant proteins determined by amino
acid analysis was generally 10 – 25% less than that determined by UV spectroscopy. UV spectroscopy over estimates the concentration probably due to the presence of
small amounts of nucleic acid or inaccuracies associated
with the extinction coefficient calculation. For this reason
we used the protein concentration value determined by
amino acid analysis in our calculation of binding stoichiometry. The purity of the recombinant IRBPs was determined by laser densitometric analysis of Coomassie blue
stained SDS 8–10% polyacrylamide gels (Molecular
Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The final purity of the recombinant IRBPs ranged from 90 to 99%.

The IRBP fusion proteins were purified from the soluble
fraction by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography. Precipitation trials showed that a final
concentration of ammonium sulfate at 14% provides the
best compromise between purification and total yield. Ion
exchange chromatography was carried out using MacroPrep High Q Support (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The recombinant protein was eluted from the column using a 200 –
750 mM NaCl gradient in 10 mM Tris at pH 7.4. The final
purification step consisted of arsenical-based or metal ion
affinity chromatography. The former utilized immobilized phenylarsine oxide which binds the vicinal thiols of
the thioredoxin active site(-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-) [88-90].
Agarose-4-aminophenylarsine oxide was activated with
20 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) and washed in lysis
buffer containing 1 mM β-ME. The soluble E. coli fraction
was incubated with gentle agitation for two hrs to overnight in a 15% slurry of the resin in the presence of 1 mM
β-ME. The resin was washed in a column until the absorbance reached baseline. The protein was eluted with a 1 to
100 mM β-ME step or linear gradient. For metal ion affinity chromatography Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin
was activated with Ni2+ according to the suggested protocol of the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala,
Sweden). The protein was eluted from the column using a
0 – 100 mM linear imidizole gradient. Protein binding

Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS)
Analysis of protein digests by LC-MS/MS has been recently
reviewed [94]. Briefly, a minced Coomassie blue stained
SDS polyacrylamide gel slice containing ~3 μg of purified
protein was destained in 50% methanol, dehydrated in
acetonitrile, reduced with 10 mM DTT/0.1 M ammonium
bicarbonate at 55°C for 1 hr and alkylated in 50 mM
iodoacetamide/0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate. The gel
pieces were then washed in 0.1 μM ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated in acetonitrile and dried. This was followed by rehydration in 12.5 ng/μl trypsin in 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate on ice for 45 min. Excess trypsin
solution was removed and the digestion carried out in 50
mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37°C. Peptides
formed were extracted from the polyacrylamide in 50%
acetonitrile/5% formic acid. The extracts were combined
and evaporated to < 20 μl for LC-MS/MS analysis. The LC-

MS/MS system consisted of a Finnigan-MAT TSQ7000 system with an electrospray ion source interfaced to a 10 cm
× 75 μm internal diameter POROS 10 RC reversed phase
capillary column. One μl volumes of the extract were
injected and the peptides eluted by an acetonitrile/0.1 acetic acid gradient. The digest was analyzed by capillary LCelectrospray mass spectrometry to measure the molecular
weight of the peptides present. Amino acid sequences of
the detected peptides were determined by collisionally
activated dissociation using LC-electrospray-tandem spectrometry with argon as the collision gas.
Protection of all-trans retinol
Full-length Xenopus IRBP was evaluated for its ability to
protect all-trans retinol from degradation as described by
Crouch et al. (1992) [11]. Briefly the absorbance of alltrans retinol at 325 nm in the presence and absence of the
recombinant protein was monitored as a function of time
using a Hitachi U2000 spectrophotometer.
Fluorometric titrations
Enhancement of retinol fluorescence and quenching of
the intrinsic protein fluorescence were used to monitor
binding of all-trans retinol to the recombinant IRBPs. We
previously derived an equation that is generally useful for
describing such quantum yield changes that are consequent upon ligand binding [51]. This equation has been
previously applied to the analysis of binding by monitoring the enhancement of retinol fluorescence [50,95]. In
this case, where excitation is at 330 nm and emission is
monitored at 480, the fluorescence enhancement (Fenh)
depends on the total retinol concentration (Rt), the dissociation constant (Kd all-trans), the number of retinol-binding
sites per protein molecule (N) and the total protein concentration (Pt) [51].

C photon counting spectrofluorometer corrected for
wavelength dependence of source energy and detector
response.
To describe the displacement of all-trans retinol by 11-cis
retinaldehyde, Equation 1 was modified to take into
account the competition between the two ligands. The
apparent dissociation constants for all-trans retinol measured under these conditions is related to the dissociation
constant of 11-cis retinaldehyde through the following
expression.

dealing with competition assays [57]. Substitution of

Computational ligand docking and homology modeling
The Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2005.08;
Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada) software
package running on a G5 dual 2.7 GHz PowerPC workstation was used for the ligand docking and homology modeling work. The site finder option of MOE that
automatically identifies internal cavities within a receptor
protein was used to locate possible ligand-binding sites in
the crystal structure of Xenopus IRBP functional unit 2 (X2)
(pdb code: 1J7X) [39]. An all-trans retinol molecule was
chosen as the ligand. Default parameters including partial
charges on amino acids and the ligand were turned on,
and full conformational searches for the ligand was carried out. The pose with the best score was selected as the
model for the docked ligand. To account for conformational flexibility of the active site pocket, the immediate
neighborhood of the retinol-binding site (within 4.5 Å of
the ligand) was energy minimized by restrained minimization.

where C1 and C2 are parameters that do not vary during
our measurements and can be assumed to be constants
[51]. The equation was fit to the data by nonlinear leastsquares analysis. To follow the quenching of the protein's
intrinsic fluorescence the excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 280 nm and 340 nm, respectively,
while the protein was titrated with all-trans retinol. For the
quenching studies the inner filter effect was accounted for
by graphical correction as previously described [56]. Fluorescence measurements were made using an SLM 8000TM

Atomic models of modules 1, 3 and 4 of Xenopus IRBP
(X1, X3 and X4, respectively) were built based on their
sequence homologies with X2 utilizing its crystal structure
and the homology modeling method implemented in
MOE. In this method, an intermediate model of the target
protein molecule is built using a Boltzmann-weighted
randomized modeling procedure [96], combined with
specialized logic for the proper handling of insertions and
deletions [97]. Backbone coordinates for the sequences
are built by searching high-resolution structures from the

Assuming that there is a single type of noninteracting site
on the protein, (Fenh) is expected to be linearly related to
the concentration of bound retinol molecules. Fenh is given
by the relation

Protein Data Bank (PDB). The side chain coordinates for
the non-conserved/insertion regions are obtained from an
extensive rotomer library generated by systematic clustering of high-resolution PDB data. For modeling loops, a
contact energy function is calculated for each candidate
that is weighed by Boltzmann function to derive the coordinates. The best intermediate model thus obtained is
energy minimized to remove bad van der Waals contacts.
The final model is then generated either as the average of
the atom coordinates of the intermediate models, or as
the coordinates of the intermediate model that scored best
according to the packing quality function. PyMOL was
used for analysis and illustration purposes.
