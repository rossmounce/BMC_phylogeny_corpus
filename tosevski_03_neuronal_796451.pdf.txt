Background
Nucleus accumbens is highly drug addicted brain region,
related with many others.

nucleus accumbens neurons and their phylogenetically
developing potential. This suggests further investigations
and clarifying clinical significance of this important brain
region in drug addiction.

Material and methods
The morphology of neurons in the nucleus accumbens
was studied on frontal and sagital sections of 15 human
brains by Golgi method.

Results
We classified these neurons in the human nucleus
accumbens, according to their morphology and size into
four types: Type I a – fusiform neurons, Type I b subtype
– fusiform neurons with lateral dendrite, Type II multipolar neurons, Type III-piriform neurons and Type IV
pyramidal-like neuron.

Discussion
Two regions of human nucleus accumbens could be
clearly recognized on Golgi preparations each containing
different predominant neuronal types. Central part of
nucleus accumbens, core, had a low density of impregnated neurons with predominant type IV pyramidal-like
neurons enriched with spines on secondary branches.
Contrary to the core, peripheral regions, shell of nucleus,
had a high density of impregnated neurons predominantly contained types I (both subtypes of fusiform), and
type III (piriform) neurons, which all were rich in spines
on secondary and third dendrite branches. Our results
indicated great morphological variability of human
