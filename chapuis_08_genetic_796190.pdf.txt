Abstract
Background: Environmental parental effects can have important ecological and evolutionary
consequences, yet little is known about genetic variation among populations in the plastic responses of
offspring phenotypes to parental environmental conditions. This type of variation may lead to rapid
phenotypic divergence among populations and facilitate speciation. With respect to density-dependent
phenotypic plasticity, locust species (Orthoptera: family Acrididae), exhibit spectacular developmental and
behavioural shifts in response to population density, called phase change. Given the significance of phase
change in locust outbreaks and control, its triggering processes have been widely investigated. Whereas
crowding within the lifetime of both offspring and parents has emerged as a primary causal factor of phase
change, less is known about intraspecific genetic variation in the expression of phase change, and in
particular in response to the parental environment. We conducted a laboratory experiment that explicitly
controlled for the environmental effects of parental rearing density. This design enabled us to compare the
parental effects on offspring expression of phase-related traits between two naturally-occurring,
genetically distinct populations of Locusta migratoria that differed in their historical patterns of high
population density outbreak events.
Results: We found that locusts from a historically outbreaking population of L. migratoria expressed
parentally-inherited density-dependent phase changes to a greater degree than those from a historically
non-outbreaking population.
Conclusion: Because locusts from both populations were raised in a common environment during our
experiment, a genetically-based process must be responsible for the observed variation in the propensity
to express phase change. This result emphasizes the importance of genetic factors in the expression of
phase traits and calls for further investigations on density-dependent parental effects in locust phase
change. More population samples with different outbreak histories need to be analyzed to demonstrate
that differences in propensity to gregarise evolve because of different outbreak histories.

Background
Phenotypic plasticity, the capacity of a genotype to produce different phenotypes in different environments, is
ubiquitous in nature [1]. It is now clear in many cases that
phenotypic plasticity is adaptive, allowing organisms to
exploit temporally and spatially heterogeneous environments [2]. When the environmental cues that mediate
phenotypic change vary both geographically and temporally, the potential exists for the evolution of populationlevel differentiation in the expression of phenotypic plasticity [3-5].
Non-genetic parental effects deserve particular attention
in light of current theoretical interest in the evolution of
plasticity [6]. These transgenerational effects can be
viewed as the plastic phenotypic response of the offspring
to parental environmental conditions [7]. Although
parental effects on reaction norms for morphological,
behavioural, and physiological traits have been investigated in a variety of organisms [reviewed in 8 for insects],
only recently have environmental parental effects been
viewed as a form of plasticity that may itself evolve [7,9].
If environmental parental effects are important in natural
populations, genetic differentiation among populations
in reaction norms induced by parental environments may
be fairly common, as is the case for the differential expression of other types of phenotypic plasticity [10]. Unfortunately, little is known about the extent of such genetic
variation for parental effects on offspring phenotype
among populations occupying different habitats and
experiencing different levels of selection. This is especially
true for animals (for plants see [7,10]).
Many insect species exhibit plastic changes in physiology,
behaviour and morphology in response to crowding [11].
Crowding-dependent phenotypic plasticity is expressed to
varying degrees among members of the Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Homoptera, and Orthoptera [11].
However, the ability to gregarise, in which individuals
undergo extreme phase change from the low population
density solitarious phase to the high population density
gregarious phase, is a defining feature of locusts [12-14].
This remarkable phase change has been interpreted as an
adaptation for migration [15] at high population density
that reduces high risks of predation [16], disease [17], or
competition for food and mates [18,19]. Environmental
parameters have rapidly emerged as primary causal factors
of phase change in locusts [20]. Phase change depends
primarily on population density within the lifetime of
both offspring and parents [13,21,22]. The changes
induced by the high density environment of the parent
drive a positive feedback loop that promotes additional
gregarisation across generations. Thus, parental effects are
central to the extreme nature of the density-dependent
phase change in locusts, as well as the time-course of its

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/37

expression in the field. What remains unclear, however, is
the potential role of genotype-dependent variation in the
expression of phase change, and in particular, variation in
response to the parental environment.
L. migratoria presents a unique system in which to examine genetic variation in the expression of locust phase
change because geographic variation exists among populations in their propensity to outbreak and form swarms
[23]. Swarming and the expression of gregarisation are
highly correlated among L. migratoria populations [24].
Furthermore, patterns of geographic variation among
populations in the propensity to gregarise reflect underlying patterns of temporal variation in locust population
densities. Typically, L. migratoria individuals are found at
low densities in the solitarious phase. In historically outbreaking areas, the species displays huge increases in local
population densities at irregular intervals. These high density conditions generate swarming individuals typical of
the gregarious phase.
In this paper we report the results of an experiment investigating the reaction norms of two commonly studied sets
of phase-related traits, morphometry of adults and behaviour of nymphs. We compared the phenotypic responses
to parental density conditions of locusts from two naturally-occurring, closely-related populations of L. migratoria with contrasting historical patterns of outbreak events,
namely a frequently outbreaking population from Madagascar and a non-outbreaking population from France.
We first reared both populations under isolated conditions for two generations to control for unknown parental
histories in the field, then reared both populations under
isolated or crowded conditions for two generations, and
finally quantified phase traits of progeny all of which were
under homogeneous isolated conditions. Because all
assayed individuals were raised in the same environment,
our design eliminated proximal environmental effects
and allowed us to ascribe potential differences to population-level divergence in the effects of parental density on
the expression of progeny phase traits. We found that
locusts from a historically outbreaking population of L.
migratoria expressed parentally-inherited phase change to
a greater extent than locusts from a historically non-outbreaking population, providing new insight into the evolution of phase change.

Results
Before proceeding to the analysis of the interactive effects
between POPULATION and HISTORY, we first briefly
report the "baseline" differences in morphometry and
behaviour between the French and Malagasy populations
(POPULATION effects in the full factorial MANOVAs
with Box-Cox transformed data; P < 0.0001). French
locusts had eyes spaced farther apart, a smaller ratio of the

length of the fore wing to the length of the hind femur,
and a larger ratio of the length of the hind femur to the
maximum width of the head than Malagasy locusts (first
canonical function CF1 of the canonical discriminant
analysis of the morphometric data; see Figure 1a and
Additional file 1). In their behaviour, French locusts had
a more tortuous track, spent less time climbing, had a
lower track speed, spent more time walking, and jumped
more frequently than Malagasy locusts (CF1 of the canonical discriminant analysis of the behavioural data; see Figure 1b and Additional file 1). Such inter-population
differences in the solitarious phenotypes of L. migratoria
have already been reported by previous studies [25] and
are expected through local adaptation to the French temperate vs. Malagasy inter-tropical habitats.
Rearing history affected the expression of phase traits in
locusts from the Malagasy and French populations in different ways. This differential response was apparent in the
significant interactive effect of POPULATION and HISTORY on both the morphometric and behavioural phase
traits (POPULATION × HISTORY in the full factorial
MANOVAs with Box-Cox transformed data; P = 0.0008
and P < 0.0001, respectively; Table 1). The first two canonical functions, obtained by the canonical discriminant
analysis of the measurements of the four morphometric
variables, yielded significant differences among group
centroids (CF1: Wilks' Lambda; χ212 = 95.6 ; P < 0.0001;
second canonical function CF2: Wilks' Lambda; χ26 =
32.3; P < 0.0001; see Additional file 1 for more details on
the two canonical functions) and accounted for 98% of
the variation between groups (Figure 1a). History did not
significantly affect morphometric traits of the French population, in contrast to the Malagasy population (test on
Mahalanobis distances: P = 0.0825 and P < 0.0001 respectively). Malagasy F/C, DE, and H/P values decreased with
crowding history (forward stepwise selection procedure
with F = 2.706 on Malagasy groups with histories of isola-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/37

tion and crowding), in agreement with previous morphometrical studies [25].
The first two canonical functions, obtained by canonical
discriminant analysis of the measurements of the eleven
behavioural variables, yielded significant differences
among group centroids (CF1: Wilks' Lambda; χ233 = 208.9
; P < 0.0001; CF2: Wilks' Lambda; χ220 = 49.4; P = 0.0003;
see Additional file 1 for more details on the two canonical
functions) and accounted for 91% of the variation
between groups (Figure 1b). The French population
expressed a substantially less pronounced behavioural
gregarisation relative to the Malagasy population (test on
Mahalanobis distances: P = 0.0122 and P < 0.0001 respectively). Behavioural changes induced by crowding history
in the Malagasy population were typified by an increase in
activity, consistent with previous analyses of locust behaviour [26]. Malagasy locusts exhibited density historydependent increase in turn frequency and decreases in
climb time and swaying frequency. On the other hand, the
differences among the French locusts were relatively
minor; those with a crowded history increased their swaying frequency and decreased their track speed (forward
stepwise selection procedures with F = 2.706 on groups
with histories of isolation and crowding from Madagascar
and France, respectively).
Altogether, these results indicate that locusts from a historically outbreaking population from Madagascar
express a more pronounced phase change when subjected
to a crowded-history than do locusts from a historically
non-outbreaking population from France.

Discussion
The most comprehensive theory of locust phase change at
the moment is that the switch towards gregarisation primarily depends on environmental conditions, in particular population density [20]. In this study, we found that
locusts from a historically outbreaking population of L.

migratoria from Madagascar expressed larger behavioural
and morphometric phase changes than those from a
related historically non-outbreaking population from
France. Because both populations were raised in a common environment during our experiment, a geneticallybased process must be responsible for this variation in the
propensity to gregarise. Furthermore, our experimental
design indicated that this genetic difference between the
two populations is in the expression of parentally-inherited gregarisation. It is worth noting that our experimental
procedure was conservative in revealing such parental
effects because measured individuals of both phases were
reared in identical isolation conditions, which should
only decrease the differences between the treatment
groups. The existence of genetic variation in the reaction
norm for a phenotypic response to parental environments
further underlines the importance of environmental
parental effects in the evolution of plasticity in natural
populations. The physiological factors underlying the
population-level variation in the expression of parental
effects remain to be determined. The parental effects

involved in the change from the solitarious to the gregarious phase have been shown to be transferred in a dosedependent manner by a water-soluble gregarising factor
added to the egg foam in Schistocerca gregaria [27]. Assuming a similar physiological mechanism in L. migratoria,
mothers of the non-outbreaking population may have
secreted smaller quantities of, or a less effective form of
the factor than mothers of the outbreaking population.
Alternatively, offspring of the non-outbreaking population may have been less sensitive to the gregarising factor
than offspring of the outbreaking population.
The genetic difference between one outbreaking Malagasy
and one non-outbreaking French L. migratoria populations suggests that the outbreak history may play a critical
role in the evolution of phase change expression. However, more population samples are required to demonstrate the adaptive nature of the observed population
differences in relation to the outbreak history. Unfortunately, it proved logistically impossible to obtain large
enough samples from more populations of each out-

breaking history at the same time. It was important for our
experiment to use samples isolated from the field at
exactly the same time, such that they have the same rearing history prior to the treatments, precisely because we
wanted to test for an effect of rearing history. Generalising
our results to the entire L. migratoria species must also be
done with caution. Further experimental work is hence
needed to confirm that non-outbreaking populations may
express phase change to a lesser degree than outbreaking
populations in L. migratoria. However, our results do
unambiguously show that genetic differentiation must be
responsible for the variation in the propensity to gregarise
of at least some populations. This finding incites for further research elucidating the respective roles of proximate
environmental versus evolutionary genetic factors in promoting locust phase change.
An intraspecific differential evolution in the ability to gregarise, as suggested by our comparative study of two populations, may play an important role in swarming
patterns across the species range of L. migratoria. Global
changes, primarily land use change [e.g., in Indonesia:
[28]] but also warming and drought [e.g., in China: [29]],
are progressively creating new favourable environments
for the migratory locust in historically non-outbreaking
areas. The risk of increasing outbreak events in such areas
would be closely related to the genetic ability to gregarise
of the populations of interest. This, in turn, depends on
the amount of effective gene flow with populations able
to change phase and the time since selection for the gregarious phase was relaxed. Outbreaks have not been
observed in Sumatra, Borneo, and New Guinea until
recently, where serious outbreaks have occurred, correlated to anthropogenic changes favouring increases in
population density [28]. Further research would be
needed to determine the extent to which these recent outbreaks are due to selection for gregarisation among autochthonous locusts or to immigrant locusts able to change
phase.
The differential evolution of the phase change between
two closely related populations of L. migratoria also provides new insight into the evolutionary diversification
within the family Acrididae. The ability to change phase
from solitarious to gregarious in response to population
density increase has evolved multiple times within this
family, resulting in the phylogenetically heterogeneous
group of 'locusts' [13]. In particular, the swarming character has evolved three times within the genus Schistocerca,
with the more frequently swarming species, S. gregaria, at
the base of the phylogeny [30]. Behavioural propensities
to gregarise among frequently and rarely swarming related
Schistocerca species have been shown to evolve differentially [31]. Moreover, some other grasshopper species
have also been shown to express some gregarious phase-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/37

like characteristics under crowded conditions, such as
melanisation (e.g., Schistocerca lineata [32]), aggregation
behaviour [33] or increased metabolism (e.g., Aiolopus
thalassinus [34]). This distribution of the gregarious phase
traits across taxa, seemingly independent of the phylogeny of the group, is consistent with the hypothesis that
genetic variation for phase change may have been present
during the evolutionary past of many Acridids, but that
the plasticity for these traits has been lost many times via
genetic assimilation [35,36]. Through this process, reaction norm evolution can transform initially plastic phenotypes into genetically determined constitutive phenotypes
[37]. Our demonstration that a L. migratoria population
lacks, at least partly, the genetic capacity to mount the
appropriate density-dependent responses, lends further
support to the evolution of locust phase change via
genetic assimilation. The process of genetic assimilation
has been invoked to explain many instances of phenotypic evolution, and in particular the evolution of warning
coloration in grasshoppers, a trait that can be densitymediated [35].
One important methodological issue arises from our
results. To date, phase change has usually been analysed
by directly comparing individuals reared in isolation to
individuals reared under crowded conditions. In particular, this approach was used in two previous studies examining intraspecific genetic variation in locust phase
change. Results of these experimental studies were unclear
and conflicting. In the non-outbreaking species Schistocerca americana, first-instar nymphs exhibited geographic variation in their expression of changes in
behaviour with crowding, but fifth-instar nymphs did not
[31]. On the other hand, in L. migratoria, Heifetz et al. [38]
found that the morphometry of locusts from a historically
non-outbreaking population was not affected by crowding, but that they were unexpectedly more active than
locusts from a historically outbreaking population.
Importantly, phase change is distinct from many other
examples of phenotypic plasticity in that the environment
of the parents can also affect the phenotypes of their offspring [21]. Thus, the common approach of directly comparing isolated and crowd reared locusts potentially
confounds the proximal density effects, resulting from an
individual's own experience, with environmentally inherited (e.g., non-genetic parental) effects. This confusion
may at least partially explain the contradictory results of
previous studies. Our study highlights the importance of
studying phase change inherited by isolation or crowding
histories (i.e., phase change that accrues across generations) instead of that expressed in response to isolated or
crowded conditions experienced within the lifetime of an
individual. Our experimental design allowed us to cast off
the confounding density effects, despite the fact that
appropriate experimental protocols are time and man-

power demanding (five generations of rearing vs. one typically). Proximal density effects may also confound the
results of whole-genome expression analyses of locusts
that have just come within reach in the effort to identify
the major genetic mechanisms underlying phase transition [39]. Kang et al. [40] identified more than 500 differentially expressed genes between laboratory induced
solitarious isolated and gregarious crowded L. migratoria
individuals. This result may suggest that molecular bases
of phase change are elaborate. However, many of the gene
expression differences may actually not be related to
phase differences but to the different laboratory environments in which the two phases were reared. Hence, our
study suggests that a promising approach to investigate
the molecular basis of locust phase change would be
whole-genome comparisons of locusts expressing phase
traits inherited under isolation or crowding histories to
cast off the potentially confounding proximal effects of
rearing density.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates genetic variation in the expression of phase change between one outbreaking population of L. migratoria from Madagascar and one nonoutbreaking population from France. This intraspecific
difference highlights the fact that while phase change is
environmentally determined, its degree of expression is
under genetic control, and can differentially evolve via
natural selection (or genetic drift) in different populations. The existence of genetic variation in the reaction
norm for a phenotypic response to parental environments
further underlines the importance of environmental
parental effects in the evolution of plasticity in natural
populations. More population samples are needed to
prove the role of the outbreak history in the differential
expression of phase change among L. migratoria populations.

Methods
Populations
L. migratoria insects for this experiment were collected in
two sites, Betioky (South-Western Madagascar) and Narbonne-plage (Southern France). The two populations are
characterized by contrasting historical patterns of outbreak events. The intertropical environment in Madagascar is cyclically favourable to increases in population
density; five intense outbreaks and two incipient outbreaks controlled by insecticides have been recorded during the last century [41]. The population from Madagascar
was thus considered as a historically frequently outbreaking population. In Southern France, only a single outbreak originating from the Western coast of the Black Sea
has been reported dating back to the XIVth century [42].
The population from France was therefore considered as a
historically non-outbreaking population. At the moment

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/37

of sampling, field densities were low (i.e., 200 and 280
adults per ha for the Malagasy and French populations
respectively; results not shown), well below the critical
density for first phase change manifestations (i.e., 2000
adults per ha [43]). All individuals collected from the Malagasy and French populations corresponded to the solitarious form. The locusts from Madagascar were sampled
three years after the last outbreak event recorded (i.e., after
approximately 12 generations assuming a generation time
of four generations per year [43]). The two sampled populations were closely related as shown by genetic analysis
at neutral microsatellite loci (FST = 0.083; [44] and results
not shown).
Experimental design
Disentangling the phase change that accrues across generations from that occurring within the lifetime of an individual requires a close control of the density conditions
experienced by an individual across generations and
homogeneous environmental conditions at the stage of
measurements. The population density encountered in
the field by the Malagasy and French populations might
differ even if we sampled solitarious-like locusts in both
cases. In particular, populations of South-Western Madagascar might experience high density conditions during
the rainy season, and some gregarious populations were
occasionally observed in this area. Since the parental density is known to affect the phase characteristics across generations in locusts [27], a potential source of variation in
the expression of gregarious phase traits between two populations may be due to uncontrolled parental effects. To
control for parental histories, both populations were
reared in isolated conditions for two generations after
sampling. In Schistocerca gregaria, the behavioural change
acquired after short periods of crowding is rapidly lost
[45]. Hence, if we assumed a similar time-course of behavioural phase change in L. migratoria, the insects were solitarious at the end of this reset step. We then reared
individuals under isolated or crowded conditions for two
subsequent generations. Finally, we measured phaserelated traits of insects in the next generation (i.e., 5th generation) that had been reared in individual cages. Figure 2
presents an overall view of the experimental protocol and
the resulting four groups we obtained: Malagasy population with a history of isolation (MI), Malagasy population
with a history of crowding (MC), French population with
a history of isolation (FI), and French population with a
history of crowding (FC). To prevent the loss of genetic
diversity due to drift, each generation started with 86 to
232 larvae from different egg pods (at least 14). As a
result, genetic variation among the individuals within
each of the four groups was substantial as measured by the
expected heterozygosity (0.53 ≤ HE ≤ 0.80) at neutral microsatellite loci ([44] and results not shown).

Because the measured individuals from treatment groups
were raised in a common environment, differences
between them cannot be ascribed to differences in their
environmental conditions, but only to differences in their
origin (Madagascar or France) and/or their rearing history. However, phase-related traits of the measured individuals under different treatments also depend on the
density conditions these individuals experienced themselves. Adults measured for morphometrics were reared
alone throughout their entire lives. Hatchlings measured
for behaviour were separated from siblings on the day of
emergence, and so only remained together for a few hours
after which they were reared in isolation for the rest of
their lives. In Schistocerca gregaria, nymphs treated by
crowding for a few hours and then re-isolated for only one
hour were statistically similar in behaviour to untreated
nymphs [45]. Assuming a similar time-course of behavioural phase change in nymphs of L. migratoria, contact
with siblings may have only slightly affected the measured
behaviours of newly hatched nymphs (1 day post hatching), and so their designated environment remained "isolation". Consequently, for both Malagasy and French
crowding-history groups, parental experience of crowding
conditions might be partly counter-balanced by the individual experience of isolation conditions. This counterbalancing effect on measured "gregarisation" makes our
experimental design conservative. The fact that the Malagasy population showed a larger propensity to gregarise
than the French population in spite of the potential confounding effect of rearing measured individuals in isolation strengthens our conclusions.
Rearing
The locusts were maintained under either isolated or
crowded conditions. Isolated rearing facilities were similar to those described in Hoste et al. [46], with slight modifications. Although the most potent stimulus causing
solitarious locusts to assume gregarious traits is physical
contact [47], the combination of visual and olfactory
stimuli is also gregarising [48]. Consequently, we rendered cages opaque to visually isolate insects from each
other. We also homogenized light conditions within each
drawer by adding 'cool' tube lamps every two shelves and
we ventilated cages through a holed top. Crowd-reared
locusts were kept in a separate room in 19 × 19 × 24 cm
cages at a density of about 40 individuals per cage. Different cages (at least three) were used for each population at
each generation of crowded rearing (i.e., 3rd and 4th generation; Figure 1). Cages were ventilated and lit in a similar
way to that of the individual cages. Isolated and crowded
locusts were reared under completely identical room and
feeding regimes. Rooms were maintained under a 14 h
light/10 h dark cycle, a fluctuating 14–10 h temperature
regime of 32–28°C, a constant humidity of 50%, and one
complete air renewal every 3 min to minimize olfactory

contact among cages. Insects were fed every two days with
seedling wheat, supplemented by wheat bran for adults.
Upon reaching sexual maturity, isolated females and
males were placed together for 48 h to ensure insemination. Mating was done between isolated adults originating
from different parents by using their reference numbers.
For both isolated and crowded conditions, egg pods were
obtained in 100 × 50 mm diameter plastic tubes filled
with moist sand (10 parts sand; 1 part water). Following
oviposition, tubes were monitored for hatching which
typically occurred in 12 days.
Assaying phase state
Because phase change is a composite character, efforts to
define phase state based on a single trait that changes during phase transition are illusory [49]. We considered two
widely used sets of phase characteristics: morphometry,
which is traditionally used in the field, and behaviour,
which is widely used since the recent establishment of an
assay and descriptive framework for locust behaviour
[reviewed in [26]].

Four morphometrical variables were considered (see
Additional file 2 for illustrations of the measurements):
(i) the ratio of the length of the fore wing on the length of
the hind femur; (ii) the ratio of the length of the hind
femur on the maximum width of the head; these two
ratios are commonly used for characterizing morphometrical phase state [50]; (iii) the ratio of the maximum
height of the pronotum on the length of the pronotum,
which translates the well-known opposition between the
quite convex pronotum of solitarious locusts and the flat
pronotum of the gregarious type; (iv) the minimum distance between the eyes, which seems to be one of the most
discriminating phase variables [51]. We measured only
adult females (40 days post-hatch) to cast off the sex-specificity of morphometrical phase change [25]. For each
group (MI, MC, FI, FC), 22 to 27 insects were measured
with electronic sliding callipers (accuracy 0.01 mm).
We also employed an individual-based behavioural assay
developed by Roessingh et al. [52] with slight modifications. We observed 77 to 108 first-instar nymphs (1 day
post-hatching) per group. Each locust was introduced via
a modified syringe into the middle of a rectangular arena
(30.5 cm long × 15 cm wide × 10 cm high [21]). Behind a
perforated transparent plastic partition at one end of the
arena and within a 4 × 15 cm backlit chamber, we placed,
as a stimulus group, 80 first-instar nymphs belonging to
the same population as the individual tested. Because
individuals with a crowding history were not available at
the time of the experiment, we used individuals with an
isolation history (i.e., MI or FI), making our behavioural
assay conservative. At the other end of the arena, there was
a similar, but empty backlit chamber. The behaviour of

the test insect was recorded on an event recorder in real
time for 3 mn after introduction into the arena. We calculated, from the raw behavioural records for each test
locust, values for eleven variables describing the attraction/repulsion of the insect to the backlit chambers of the
arena and to the stimulus chamber separately, the tortuosity and speed of the locust track during the assay, some
locomotory events, and the incidence of swaying (see
Additional file 2 for a list of all eleven variables).
Statistical analyses
Unless specified, statistical analyses were performed with
the STATISTICA package v.6.1. Because morphometric
and behavioural traits have been identified as key traits in
L. migratoria phase change [25], we used them simultaneously in two multivariate analyses of morphometric and
behavioural phases, respectively. To examine the potential interaction between population of origin (POPULATION) and rearing history (HISTORY) on L. migratoria
morphometry and behaviour, we employed two full factorial MANOVAs on morphometric and behavioural data
separately, with POPULATION and HISTORY as fixed factors. When appropriate, variables were Box-Cox transformed to conform to MANOVA assumptions, using JMP
package v.3.2.2 (SAS Institute 1995, Cary, NC, USA; see
Additional file 3 for details on Box-Cox transformations).
We then used a canonical discriminant analysis to compare groups belonging to the same population of origin,
i.e. Madagascar or France, but with histories of isolation
and crowding through pairwise tests on Mahalanobis distances and plots of the canonical functions.
