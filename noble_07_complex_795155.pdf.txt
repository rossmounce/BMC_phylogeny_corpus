Abstract
Background: EFL (or elongation factor-like) is a member of the translation superfamily of GTPase
proteins. It is restricted to eukaryotes, where it is found in a punctate distribution that is almost
mutually exclusive with elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1α). EF-1α is a core translation factor
previously thought to be essential in eukaryotes, so its relationship to EFL has prompted the
suggestion that EFL has spread by horizontal or lateral gene transfer (HGT or LGT) and replaced
EF-1α multiple times. Among green algae, trebouxiophyceans and chlorophyceans have EFL, but
the ulvophycean Acetabularia and the sister group to green algae, land plants, have EF-1α. This
distribution singles out green algae as a particularly promising group to understand the origin of
EFL and the effects of its presence on EF-1α.
Results: We have sampled all major lineages of green algae for both EFL and EF-1α. EFL is
unexpectedly broad in its distribution, being found in all green algal lineages (chlorophyceans,
trebouxiophyceans, ulvophyceans, prasinophyceans, and mesostigmatophyceans), except
charophyceans and the genus Acetabularia. The presence of EFL in the genus Mesostigma and EF-1α
in Acetabularia are of particular interest, since the opposite is true of all their closest relatives. The
phylogeny of EFL is poorly resolved, but the Acetabularia EF-1α is clearly related to homologues
from land plants and charophyceans, demonstrating that EF-1α was present in the common
ancestor of the green lineage.
Conclusion: The distribution of EFL and EF-1α in the green lineage is not consistent with the
phylogeny of the organisms, indicating a complex history of both genes. Overall, we suggest that
after the introduction of EFL (in the ancestor of green algae or earlier), both genes co-existed in
green algal genomes for some time before one or the other was lost on multiple occasions.

Background
Horizontal or lateral gene transfer (HGT or LGT) is the
non-sexual movement of genetic information between
two species. This process has been amply documented to
affect prokaryotic genomes: although the frequency and

importance of such events is debated, there is little debate
that it plays some role [1-4]. The importance of HGT in
the evolution of eukaryotic genomes is not as well appreciated, in part because comparative nuclear genomics has
lagged behind that of prokaryotes. Nevertheless, a

number of genome-wide surveys have now shown the
process has had a broad impact in several species [5-9],
and a number of single gene transfers have also been
investigated and found to have interesting implications
for ecology, protein function, or genome evolution [1012].
One potential gene transfer with interesting functional
implications is EFL, or elongation factor-like protein [13].
EFL is member of a large GTPase superfamily containing
translation initiation, elongation, and termination factors. EFL is specifically related to a subset of proteins
found exclusively in eukaryotes, including elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1α), eukaryotic translation release factor3, and HSP70-binding protein HBS1. EFL is itself only
known from eukaryotes, but not all eukaryotes have it. It
has presently been reported from eight eukaryotic lineages
[13-15], nearly all of which have close relatives which lack
it (many of which have completely sequenced genomes
supporting the absence of EFL). Moreover, most or all the
lineages where EFL has been reported to date appear to
lack EF-1α (again, this includes both organisms with completely sequenced genomes and some with large scale EST
sequencing surveys). Altogether there is generally a mutually exclusive distribution of EFL and EF-1α, and both are
scattered around the tree of eukaryotes. This is of interest
for several reasons. First, EF-1α was formerly considered
essential because of the important and universal role it
plays in translation, but this is clearly not the case since
some EFL containing organisms clearly don't use EF-1α.
Second, the distribution suggests EFL might substitute or
partially substitute for EF-1α function. Third, the punctate
distribution of EFL suggests it may be moving between
eukaryotes [13]. As more lineages with EFL are found
[14,15], the alternative that EFL is ancestral to all the lineages that possess it, and that either EFL or EF-1α has been
lost many times in different lineages becomes more defensible. However, the number of such events is very large
since the lineages possessing EFL are scattered across the
tree of eukaryotes, and the number of lineages with EFL
remains far fewer than those with EF-1α. Based on the current distribution we favour the movement of EFL between
eukaryotes, but this must be reassessed as the distribution
becomes better known.
Within each group where EFL has been found, the distribution of the protein is sometimes simple but uninformative; for example, all dinoflagellates appear to use
EFL[14]. Conversely, it's distribution among other groups
is more complex but difficult to interpret; for example,
some fungi, ichthyosporeans, and choanoflagellates have
EFL while others do not and the relationships between
these is unclear [13,15-17]. A group where the distribution appeared to be most precisely explained was the
green algae: here the well-sampled plants lack EFL and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/82

instead have EF-1α, whereas the well-sampled chlorophyceans and trebouxiophyceans have EFL and lack EF1α. The single ulvophycean eukaryotic elongation factor,
from Acetabularia acetabulum, was found to use EF-1α but
not EFL, altogether leading to the conclusion that the
green algal EFL originated in a common ancestor of chlorophyceans and trebouxiophyceans {Keeling, 2004
#652}. This makes green algae a good model for the study
of the fine scale distribution of EFL for two reasons. First,
EFL seems to have arisen within the group rather then
prior to its diversification, so the age of this event could in
principle be predicted. Second, while the phylogeny of
green algae is not perfectly known, it is better understood
than most other eukaryotic groups [18], so the distribution can be interpreted according to a reasonable phylogeny. A better idea of this distribution can help us answer
several questions. In particular, if EFL is introduced into a
lineage by HGT, what happens to EF-1α? Do they both
persist for some time, and does lineage sorting take place?
Only a fine-scale survey of a group where EFL exists in
some but not all members could address such questions,
and these questions are important because they are one
way to determine the possible functional relationship
between EFL and EF-1α.
Here we have sampled EFL and EF-1α from representatives of all major missing lineages of green algae. The
viridiplantae are divided into two main groups, streptophytes and chlorophytes [18]. The streptophytes include
land plants, charophyceans, and the enigmatic scaly green
flagellate Mesostigma. The chlorophytes include four subdivisions, prasinophyceans, ulvophyceans, trebouxiophyceans and chlorophyceans (we will use the suffix 'ceans' so as to distinguish the larger group chlorophytes
from the subgroup chlorophyceans). The expectation,
based on the relatively simple distribution originally
described, is that EF-1α but not EFL should be found in all
green lineages except chlorophyceans and trebouxiophyceans. In contrast, however, we have found that EFL is
abundant in chlorophytes and EF-1α comparatively rare.
Indeed, among chlorophyte green algae, Acetabularia is
the only lineage in which we could find EF-1α: EFL was
found in all other chlorophyte lineages, and in the streptophyte Mesostigma. Phylogenetic reconstruction shows
the Acetabularia EF-1α is related to homologues from charophytes and land plants, and therefore ancestral (and the
only known chlorophyte EF-1α to be retained). This
implies that EFL and EF-1α were likely both present in the
ancestor of streptophytes and chlorophytes, and that lineage sorting led to the current distribution of EFL and EF1α. This has implications for the functional co-existence
of the two proteins, and also suggests that EFL was more
frequently retained than was EF-1α.

Results & discussion

Characterisation of new EFL and EF-1α genes from green
algae
Previously, EFL was found in a number of species of chlorophyceans and trebouxiophyceans, but not in any land
plants or the ulvophycean A. acetabulum. This lead to the
conclusion that it originated in a common ancestor of
chlorophyceans and trebouxiophyceans [13], which in
turn leads to the prediction that all other green algae
should only contain EF-1α. In contrast, however, we have
found that most green algal lineages possess EFL. Genes
encoding EFL were characterized from three prasinophyceans (M. pusilla, T. tetrathele, and O. tauri), two ulvophyceans (U. fenestrata and U. intestinalis), an additional
chlorophycean (Chlorococcum sp.), and the only mesostigmatophycean (M. viride). From none of these lineages
were we able to detect the presence of a gene for EF-1α.
Moreover, EF-1α was not present in the complete genome
of O. tauri or in EST surveys of M. viride [19,20]. An EST
survey of a third ulvophycean, U. linza [21], was also
searched and in agreement with our results contained a
short fragment of EFL but no detectable EF-1α. Conversely, EF-1α was characterized from two charophyceans
(C. australis and Spirogyra sp.), and we were not able to
detect the presence of EFL in either of these species. EFL
fragments were identified in EST or genomic survey
projects from four land plants, Pinus taeda, Oryza sativa,
Lactuca saligna, and Triticum aestivum. With the exception
of the first two, however, these do not form a group in
phylogenetic analyses (Suppl. Figure 1) as one would
expect if they were ancestrally land plant sequences. Moreover, most are closely related to either a subset of green
algae or fungi, and are poorly represented in the surveys
where they are found. In addition, in cases where substantial genomic data are available from the same organism,
the EFL is only found in EST sequences and not in the
genomic data. The best cases are O. sativa and T. aestivum,
where Blast searches against their respective genome databases revealed no EFL sequence, and specifically no match
to the EST purportedly from that organism. On balance,
we conclude that these are contaminant sequences until
evidence that they are truly encoded in the plant genomes
is available (which, according to the phylogeny, would
suggest several recent acquisitions in certain plants).

In general, organisms from the streptophyte lineage
mostly possess EF-1α while organisms from the chlorophyte lineage mostly possess EFL. However, M. viride and
A. acetabulum are important exceptions because, based on
their currently accepted taxonomic positions, one would
predict that they should use EF-1α and EFL respectively,
whereas EST sampling from both reveals the opposite. It
is possible that both genes are present in these genomes,
although this would still suggest the expected gene is not
expressed as highly as the one characterized here, espe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/82

cially in M. viride, where there is a large sample of 10,395
ESTs [19]. It is also possible that these species are misclassified; that M. viride is really a chlorophyte and A. acetabulum is really a streptophyte. The phylogenetic position of
both genera, and in particular M. viride, have been analysed many times using a variety of data [18,19,22-27],
making this somewhat unlikely. Nevertheless, we carried
out a phylogeny based on nine concatenated protein-coding genes from the EST surveys to re-confirm their phylogenetic affinities to streptophytes or chlorophytes. The
phylogeny (Figure 1) is consistent with previous analyses
that place M. viride at the base of the streptophytes and A.
acetabulum within the chlorophytes. This rules out the
possibility that the possession of EF-1α and EFL by A.
acetabulum and M. viride, respectively, reflects their relationship to other groups that possess the same gene. In
short, the distribution of EFL and EF-1α is not strictly consistent with the phylogenetic relationships of the organisms where the proteins are found.
Phylogenies of EFL and EF-1α
The complex distribution of EFL and EF-1α could have
arisen from multiple transfers of EFL to green algae, reversions by re-introduction of EF-1α, or an extended period
of time where both genes co-existed in the same ancestral
lineage followed by differential loss in the descendants of
this lineage. Each of these hypotheses is significant for different reasons, and each leads to predictions for the phylogeny of EFL and EF-1α. If EFL invaded green algae
multiple times, the green algal EFLs will not form a single
well-supported clade. If EF-1α was re-introduced to one or
more groups, then the green algal and plant EF-1α genes
will not form a single well-supported clade. Lastly, if lineage sorting has taken place, then the green lineage should
form a single clade in both genes.

The first possibility cannot be confidently accepted or
rejected because the phylogeny of green algal EFL genes is
not sufficiently well resolved. Figure 2 shows a phylogeny
of all full-length EFL genes with the exception of the
highly divergent gene from the chlorarachniophyte
Bigelowiella natans; this gene has been included in analyses
previously [13], and we similarly found no indication that
it was related to green algal EFL (Suppl. Figure 1). The
green algal EFL sequences fall into three groups. One large
and weakly supported clade includes representatives of all
four major chlorophyte subgroups (noteworthy among
which are the ulvophyceans since Acetabularia is currently
believed to be related to this group). A second stronglysupported clade includes marine picoplanktonic prasinophyceans (noteworthy among which is a previously unidentified environmental sequence from the Sargasso Sea
that is specifically related to M. pusilla, consistent with the
source of this material and the size of cells collected:
Suppl. Figure 1). Lastly, M. viride branches independently

of other green algae without any support for its position,
which is unfortunate since it would be expected to possess
EF-1α rather than EFL. None of these three groups of
green algae is related to any other group or to one another
with strong support in any analysis.
The phylogeny of EF-1α is much more informative (Figure
3). In contrast to EFL, the positions of all members of the
green lineage, A. acetabulum, charophyceans, and land
plants, are resolved with strong support, and the relationships of the EF-1α genes match those expected for the
organisms. The green clade is well supported overall (91–
98%), with A. acetabulum sister to all streptophytes with
94–100% support. The charophyceans are paraphyletic
with Spirogyra sister to land plants, although this branching order is not supported by bootstrap analyses. The
position of A. acetabulum is of particular importance,
because the presence of EF-1α is unexpected in this ulvophycean, given chlorophytes as a whole, including other

ulvophyceans, do not appear to possess EF-1α. In previous analyses based on a truncated EST the position of the
A. acetabulum EF-1α was not resolved with strong support,
but it did not branch with plants [13]. However, having
now sequenced an additional 561 bp of the 5' end (about
50% of the alignable sequence), it is clear that the A.
acetabulum EF-1α is indeed sister to other members of the
green lineage. This suggests very strongly that A. acetabulum has not 'reacquired' EF-1α secondarily (e.g., through
HGT), and by extension that its EF-1α gene is the single
known representative of the ancestral chlorophyte EF-1α.
The evolution and distribution of EFL in the green algal
lineage
The range of green algae that possess EFL is much broader
than expected based on previous data, and more importantly its distribution is not easily reconciled with the evolutionary relationships among the organisms that possess
it. On the whole, streptophytes possess EF-1α, with the

exception of M. viride, whereas chlorophytes possess EFL,
with the exception of A. acetabulum. Figure 4 shows a schematic phylogeny of the green lineage with the distribution
of EFL and EF-1α. The phylogeny of EF-1α demonstrates
that EF-1α existed in the ancestor of the green lineage, and
that the land plants and charophyceans as well as the
chlorophyte A. acetabulum have all retained this ancestral
gene.
It is possible that the distribution of EFL is due to multiple
independent invasions of the gene to different subgroups

of the green lineage. This would require three or perhaps
more origins of EFL (this is unclear because the phylogeny
of basal chlorophytes is not resolved), which would suggest that EFL was very mobile indeed. While this is consistent with the present data (because the EFL tree does not
reject such a scenario), it seems unlikely that one group
would acquire such a gene many times.
Another possibility is that EFL and EF-1α were both
present in the common ancestor of streptophytes and
chlorophytes and co-existed for some extended period of

Schematic of evolutionary relationships within the

A phylogeny of the Plantae, with the known presence of
either EFL or EF-1α in extant lineages plotted at the tips of
each branch (EFL is a square containing "L" and EF-1α is an

well (indicated by a gray octagon at the base of the tree).
Also plotted is one possible explanation for the current distribution of the two genes in the green lineage, where EFL
was gained once in the ancestor of the green viridiplantae
(indicated by the green box), and subsequently either EFL or
EF-1α lost in several lineages each (indicated by red boxes
with indicated which gene would have been lost). Other
models to explain this distribution that include multiple origins of EFL are also possible, but are not shown for simplicity.
The tree of the green lineage is based on Figure 1 and other
analyses [18].

so. More specifically, EFL has been argued to share some
functional overlap with EF-1α in translation [13]. However, EF-1α is a multifunctional protein, so even if EFL is
capable of taking over its role in translation elongation, it
stands to reason that EF-1α would have to persist until its
other roles in the cell were also obsolete or at least nonessential. Accordingly, a period of co-existence is probably
not only possible, but necessary, and during such a time
either protein could conceivably be lost. This has the
interesting implication that plants, although they now
only have EF-1α, once had EFL as well. It also bolsters
expectations that organisms with both proteins should
exist. The zygomycete fungus Spizellomyces punctatus is
reported to have both genes [17], and we have detected
both in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana (G. Gile and
PJK, unpublished data), but so far co-existence of the two
proteins is curiously rare.

Conclusion
We have shown that the apparently mutually exclusive
distribution of the GTPase genes EFL and EF-1α in the
green lineage is not consistent with the phylogeny of the
organisms in which the genes are found. Specifically,
members of the streptophyte lineage tend to encode EF1α and not EFL, except for the basal genus Mesostigma
where the opposite is found. Conversely, members of the
chlorophytes tend to encode EFL and not EF-1α, except
for Acetabularia where the opposite is found. The phylogeny of EFL does not resolve the origin of the Mesostigma
gene, but the phylogeny of EF-1α clearly shows the Acetabularia gene to be a relict, ancestral chlorophyte EF-1α
rather than an independent re-acquisition. Altogether, we
suggest that the ancestor of the green lineage encoded EF1α, but at some point EFL was introduced and the two
genes co-existed in green algal genomes for some time
before one or the other was lost on multiple occasions.

Methods
time. Assuming that both genes do not still co-exist in any
one green algal genome, this would mean EFL was lost
once in the ancestor of charophyceans and land plants,
and once in an ancestor of A. acetabulum, whereas EF-1α
was lost once in an ancestor of M. viride and several times
in chlorophyte lineages. Because the phylogeny of chlorophytes is still uncertain it is impossible to state how many
times EF-1α would have to have been lost, but it is interesting that EF-1α loss would likely have been more frequent than EFL loss. It is also possible that both genes
persist in some green algae, although we know this is not
the case in several plants, O. tauri, and C. reinhardtii, and
have good reason to suspect it is not true in the many
green algae for which there are large EST surveys. A long
period of co-existence followed by differential loss of one
or the other gene may seem unlikely at first glance, but if
one considers the function of these proteins it may not be

Strains
Multiple whole plants of Ulva fenestrata and Ulva intestinalis were collected from the intertidal zone at Spanish
Banks, Vancouver, BC Canada. Micromonas pusilla (strain
NEPCC 29), Chlorococcum sp. (strain NEPCC 478), Tetraselmis tetrathele (strain NEPCC 500) were grown in natural seawater medium [28] at 16° with a 16:8 light:dark
cycle. Chara australis (strain FWAC 7144) and Spirogyra sp.
(strain FWAC 125) were grown in soilwater medium
[29]at 16° with a 16:8 light:dark cycle. A cDNA library
from Acetabularia acetabulum (strain Aa0005) was generously provided by D. Mandoli.
Characterisation of EFL and EF-1α genes
Material from all cultures was harvested by centrifugation
and total RNA and DNA was isolated using protocols
described previously [30]. RNA and DNA was used as a tem-

plate for RT-PCR and PCR reactions, respectively, using
primers for each of EFL and EF-1α. EFL primers were CTGTCGATCGTCATHTGYGGNCAYGTNGA and CTTGATRTTNAGNCCNACRTTRTCNCC,

primers
were
AACATCGTCGTGATHGGNCAYGTNGA and CTTGATCACNCCNACNGCNACNGT or CAACATCGTCGTCATCGGNCAYGTNGA and GCCGCGCACGTTGAANCCNACRTTRTC.
Products of the expected size (or larger in the case of genomic
DNA amplifications) were cloned and multiple clones completely sequenced. In all cases the RT-PCR approach was
more successful, leading us to conclude EFL and EF-1α may
encode a number of introns. The A. acetabulum EFL was partially characterized as part of an EST survey [13], and to
improve the resolution of its phylogenetic position we characterized the 5' portion of the gene by amplification from a
cDNA library using the specific primer TTCCGACCGGCACGGTTCCAATTCCG and the 5' degenerate EF-1α
primer AACATCGTCGTGATHGGNCAYGTNGA. During the
course of this work the complete nuclear genome of the prasinophycean Ostreococcus tauri and an EST survey from the
mesostigmatophycean Mesostigma viride (strain NIES 476)
both became available [19,20]. EFL and EF-1α were both
sought from this sequence data, from which only EFL
sequences could be found. New sequences were deposited in
GenBank under accession numbers EF551321-EF551331.
Phylogenetic analyses
New EFL and EF-1α sequences were added to existing
amino acid alignments [14]. The two proteins were analysed separately since their relationship to one another
has been examined previously, and separate analyses
allow the inclusion of more unambiguously alignable
characters, 425 and 407 for EFL and EF-1α, respectively.
An alignment of nine concatenated proteins from algae
and plants was also constructed using actin, alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, RbcS, Rps10, Rps13, Rpl3, Rpl11, and
Rpl13, for a total of 1,206 unambiguously alignable
amino acid characters (with no missing data). The trebouxiophytes are represented by a composite of
sequences from three species: actin, Rps10, and Rpl11 are
from Helicosporidium sp., beta-tubulin, Rpl3, Rpl13 and
Rps13 are from Prototheca wickerhamii, and alpha-tubulin,
RbcS, and TufA are from Chlorella vulgaris. Trees were
inferred using distance, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Bayesian trees were inferred using Mr.

with site-to-site rate variation modeled on a gamma distribution with 8 variable rate categories and one category of
invariable sites, three heated chains and one cold one, and
1,000,000 generations with sampling every 1,000 generations. Log likelihoods were plotted and showed a rapid
plateau after only five samples, so a burnin of 40 trees was
removed before constructing the consensus (constructing
a consensus of all trees resulted in the same topology).
Maximum likelihood branch lengths for the consensus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/82

topology were calculated using ProML 3.6 [32] with JTT, 8
gamma rate categories and one category of invariable
sites. ProML trees were inferred using the same settings,
and 100 bootstraps were inferred with the gamma shape
parameter alpha and proportion of invariant sites estimated using Tree-Puzzle 5.2 [33]. ML trees and 1,000
bootstrap trees were also inferred using PhyML 2.4.4 [34]
with the WAG model with 8 gamma rate categories and
one category of invariable sites (when p-inv was not zero),
and parameters estimated from the data. Distances were
also calculated using Tree-Puzzle with the same settings
(and parameters estimated from the data), and trees constructed using WEIGHBOUR 1.0.1a [35]. 100 bootstrap
replicates were carried out using puzzleboot [36], which
gave similar results as maximum likelihood (not shown).

Authors' contributions
