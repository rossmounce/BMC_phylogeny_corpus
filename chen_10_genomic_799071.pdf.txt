Abstract
Background: New DNA sequencing technologies have enabled detailed comparative genomic analyses of entire
genera of bacterial pathogens. Prior to this study, three species of the enterobacterial genus Yersinia that cause
invasive human diseases (Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica) had been sequenced.
However, there were no genomic data on the Yersinia species with more limited virulence potential, frequently
found in soil and water environments.
Results: We used high-throughput sequencing-by-synthesis instruments to obtain 25- to 42-fold average
redundancy, whole-genome shotgun data from the type strains of eight species: Y. aldovae, Y. bercovieri, Y.
frederiksenii, Y. kristensenii, Y. intermedia, Y. mollaretii, Y. rohdei, and Y. ruckeri. The deepest branching species in the
genus, Y. ruckeri, causative agent of red mouth disease in fish, has the smallest genome (3.7 Mb), although it shares
the same core set of approximately 2,500 genes as the other members of the species, whose genomes range in
size from 4.3 to 4.8 Mb. Yersinia genomes had a similar global partition of protein functions, as measured by the
distribution of Cluster of Orthologous Groups families. Genome to genome variation in islands with genes
encoding functions such as ureases, hydrogeneases and B-12 cofactor metabolite reactions may reflect adaptations
to colonizing specific host habitats.
Conclusions: Rapid high-quality draft sequencing was used successfully to compare pathogenic and nonpathogenic members of the Yersinia genus. This work underscores the importance of the acquisition of horizontally
transferred genes in the evolution of Y. pestis and points to virulence determinants that have been gained and lost
on multiple occasions in the history of the genus.

Background
Of the millions of species of bacteria that live on this
planet, only a very small percentage cause serious
human diseases [1]. Comparative genetic studies are
revealing that many pathogens have only recently
emerged from protean environmental, commensal or
zoonotic populations [2-5]. For a variety of reasons,
most research effort has been focused on characterizing
these pathogens, while their closely related non-pathogenic relatives have only been lightly studied. As a
result, our understanding of the population biology of
these clades remains biased, limiting our knowledge of
the evolution of virulence and our ability to design

reliable assays that distinguish pathogen signatures from
the background in the clinic and environment [6].
The recent development of second generation sequencing platforms (reviewed by Mardis [7,8] and Shendure
[7,8]) offers an opportunity to change the direction of
microbial genomics, enabling the rapid genome sequencing of large numbers of strains of both pathogenic and
non-pathogenic strains. Here we describe the deployment of new sequencing technology to extensively sample eight genomes from the Yersinia genus of the family
Enterobacteriaceae. The first published sequencing studies on the Yersinia genus have focused exclusively on
invasive human disease-causing species that included
five Yersinia pestis genome sequences (one of which,
strain 91001, is from the avirulent ‘microtus’ biovar)
[9-12], two Yersinia pseudotuberculosis [13,14] and one
Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1B [15]. Primarily a zoonotic pathogen, Y. pestis, the causative agent of bubonic

plague and a category A select agent, is a recently
emerged lineage that has since undergone global expansion [2]. Following introduction into a human through
flea bite [16], Y. pestis is engulfed by macrophages and
taken to the regional lymph nodes. Y. pestis then
escapes the macrophages and multiplies to cause a
highly lethal bacteremia if untreated with antibiotics. Y.
pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica (primarily biotype 1B) are enteropathogens that cause gastroenteritis
following ingestion and translocation of the Peyer’s
patches. Like Y. pestis, the enteropathogenic Yersiniae
can escape macrophages and multiply outside host cells,
but unlike their more virulent cogener, they only usually
cause self-limiting inflammatory diseases.
The generally accepted pathway for the evolution of
these more severe disease-causing Yersiniae is memorably encapsulated by the recipe, ‘add DNA, stir, reduce’
[17]. In each species DNA has been ‘added’ by horizontal gene transfer in the form of plasmids and genomic
islands. All three human pathogens carry a 70-kb pYV
virulence plasmid (also known as pCD), which carries
the Ysc type III secretion system and Yops effectors
[18-20], that is not detected in non-pathogenic species.
Y. pestis also has two additional plasmids, pMT (also
known as pFra), containing the F1 capsule-like antigen
and murine toxin, and pPla (also known as pPCP1),
which carries plasminogen-activating factor, Pla. Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and biotype 1B Y. enterocolitica also contain a chromosomally located, mobile, highpathogenicity island (HPI) [21]. The HPI includes a
cluster of genes for biosynthesis of yersiniabactin, an
iron-binding siderophore necessary for systemic infection [22]. ‘Stir’ refers to intra-genomic change, notably
the recent expansion of insertion sequences (IS) within
Y. pestis (3.7% of the Y. pestis CO92 genome [9]) and a
high level of genome structural variation [23]. ‘Reduce’
describes the loss of functions via deletions and pseudogene accumulation in Y. pestis [9,13] due to shifts in
selection pressure caused by the transition from Y. pseudotuberculosis-like enteropathogenicity to a flea-borne
transmission cycle. This description of Y. pestis evolution is, of course, oversimplified. Y. pestis strains show
considerable diversity at the phenotypic level and there
is evidence of acquisition of plasmids and other horizontally transferred genes [[12,24,25] DNA microarray,
[26,27]].
While most attention is focused on the three wellknown human pathogens, several other, less familiar
Yersinia species have been split off from Y. enterocolitica
over the past 40 years based on biochemistry, serology
and 16S RNA sequence [28,29]. Y. ruckeri is an agriculturally important fish pathogen that is a cause of ‘red
mouth’ disease in salmonid fish. The species has sufficient phylogenetic divergence from the rest of the

Page 2 of 18

Yersinia genus to stir controversy about its taxonomic
assignment [30]. Y. fredricksenii, Y. kristensenii, Y. intermedia, Y. mollaretii, Y. bercovieri, and Y. rohdei have
been isolated from human feces, fresh water, animal
feces and intestines and foods [28]. There have been
reports associating some of the species with human
diarrheal infections [31] and lethality for mice [32]. Y.
aldovae is most often isolated from fresh water but has
also been cultured from fish and the alimentary tracts of
wild rodents [33]. There is no report of isolation of Y.
aldovae from human feces or urine [28].
Using microbead-based, massively parallel sequencing
by synthesis [34] we rapidly and economically obtained
high redundancy genome sequence of the type strains of
each of these eight lesser known Yersinia species. From
these genome sequences, we were able to determine the
core gene set that defines the Yersinia genus and to
look for clues to distinguish the genomes of human
pathogens from less virulent strains.

Results
High-redundancy draft genome sequences of eight
Yersinia species

Whole genome shotgun coverage of eight previously
unsequenced Yersinia species (Table 1) was obtained by
single-end bead-based pyrosequencing [34] using the
454 Life Sciences GS-20 instrument. Each of the eight
genomes was sequenced to a high level of redundancy
(between 25 and 44 sequencing reads per base) and
assembled de novo into large contigs (Table 2; Additional file 1). Excluding contigs that covered repeat
regions and therefore had significantly increased copy
number, the quality of the sequence of the draft assemblies was high, with less than 0.1% of the sequence of
each genome having a consensus quality score [35] less
than 40. Moreover, a more recent assessment of quality
of GS-20 data suggests that the scores generated by the
454 Life Sciences software are an underestimation of the
true sequence quality [36]. The most common sequencing error encountered when assembling pyrosequencing data is the rare calling of incorrect numbers of
homopolymers caused by variation in the intensity of
fluorescence emitted upon extension with the labeled
nucleoside [34].
Previous studies and our experience suggest that at
this level of sequence coverage the assembly gaps fall in
repeat regions that cannot be spanned by single-end
sequence reads (average length 109 nucleotides in this
study) [34]. Fewer RNA genes are observed compared to
published Yersinia genomes finished using traditional
Sanger sequencing technology (Additional file 1), reflecting the greater difficulty of uniquely assembling repetitive sequences with single-end reads. We assessed the
quality of our assemblies using metrics implemented in

the amosvalidate package [37]. Specifically, we focused
on three measures frequently correlated with assembly
errors: density of polymorphisms within assembled
reads, depth of coverage, and breakpoints in the alignment of unassembled reads to the final assembly.
Regions in each genome where at least one measure
suggested a possible mis-assembly were validated by
manual inspection (Additional file 2). Many of the suspect regions corresponded to collapsed repeats, where
the location of individual members of the repeat family
within the genome could not be accurately determined.
Based on the results of the amosvalidate analysis and
the optical map alignment we found no evidence of
mis-assemblies leading to chimeric contigs in the eight
genomes we sequenced. Genomic regions flagged by the
amosvalidate package are made available in GFF format
(compatible with most genome browsers) in Additional
file 3.

Genome sizes were estimated initially as the sum of
the sizes of the contigs from the shotgun assembly, with
corrections for contigs representing collapsed repeats
(Table 2). We also derived an independent estimate for
the genome size from the whole-genome optical restriction mapping of the species [38] (Additional file 4).
Alignment of contigs to the optical maps [39] suggested
that the optical maps consistently overestimated sizes (2
to 10% on average). After correction, the map-based
estimates and sequence-based estimates agreed well
(within 7%). Two species, Y. aldovae (4.22 to 4.33 Mbp)
and Y. ruckeri (3.58 to 3.89 Mbp), have a substantially
reduced total genome size compared with the 4.6 to 4.8
Mbp seen in the genus generally. The agreement
between the optical maps and sequence-based estimates
of genome sizes tallied with experimental evidence for
the lack of large plasmids in the sequenced genomes
(Additional file 5). A screen for matches to known

plasmid genes produced only a few candidate plasmid
contigs, totaling less than 10 kbp of sequence in each
genome.
The number of IS elements per genome for the eight
species (12 to 167 matches) discovered using the IS finder database [40] was much lower than in the Y. pestis
genome (1,147 matches; copy numbers estimates took
into account the possibility of mis-assembly and were
accordingly adjusted; see Methods). Furthermore, the
non-pathogenic species with the most IS matches,
namely Y. bercovieri (167 matches), Y. aldovae (143
matches) and Y. ruckeri (136 matches), have comparatively smaller genomes. We also searched for novel
repeat families using a de novo repeat-finder [41] and
collected a non-redundant set of 44 repeat sequence
families in the Yersinia genus (Table 3; Additional file
6). Interestingly, the well-known ERIC element [42] was
recovered by our de novo search and was found to be
present in many copies in all the pathogenic species, but
was relatively rare in the non-pathogenic ones. On the
other hand, a similar and recently discovered element,
YPAL [43] (also recovered by the de novo search), was
abundant in all the Yersinia genomes except the fish
pathogen Y. ruckeri. Insertion sequence IS1541C in the
IS finder database, which has expanded in Y. pestis (to
more than 60 copies), had only a handful of strong
matches in Y. enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and
Y. bercovieri and no discernable matches in the other
Yersinia genomes.
New Yersinia genome data reduce the pool of unique
detection targets for Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica

The sequences generated in this study provide new
background information for validating genus detection
and diagnosis assays targeting pathogenic members of
the Yersinia genus. The assay design process commonly

starts by computationally identifying genomic regions
that are unique to the targeted genus (’signatures’) - an
ideal signature is shared by all targeted pathogens but
not found in a background comprising non-pathogenic
near neighbors or in other unrelated microbes. While
many pathogens are well characterized at the genomic
level, the background set is only sparsely represented in
genomic databases, thereby limiting the ability to computationally screen out non-specific candidate assays
(false positives). As a result, many assays may fail
experimental field tests, thereby increasing the costs of
assay development efforts. To evaluate whether the new
genomic sequences generated in our study can reduce
the incidence of false positives in assay development, we
computed signatures for the Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica genera using the Insignia pipeline [44], the system
previously used to successfully develop assays for the
detection of V. cholerae [44]. We identified 171 and 100
regions within the genomes of Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica, respectively, that represent good candidates for
the design of detection assays. In Y. pestis these regions
tended to cluster around the origin of replication,
whereas in Y. enterocolitica there was a more even distribution. The average G+C content of the regions for
the unique sequences in both species was close to the
Yersinia average (47%) and there was not a strong association with putative genome islands (Additional files 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, [45]). For both species, most regions
overlapped predicted genes (161 of 171 (94%) and 96 of
100 (96%) in Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, respectively). Interestingly, 171 Y. pestis gene regions were
spread over only 70 different genes, whereas the 96 Y.
enterocolitica regions were found overlapping only 90
genes. There was no obvious trend in the nature of the
genes harboring these putative signals except that many
could be arguably classed as ‘non-core’ functions,

encoding phage endonucleases, invasins, hemolysins and
hypothetical proteins.
Ten Y. pestis-specific and 31 Y. enterocolitica-specific
putative signatures have significant matches in the new
genome sequence data (Additional files 7, 8, 9, 10), indicating assays designed within these regions would result
in false positive results. This result underscores the need
for a further sampling of genomes of the Yersinia genus
in order to assist the design of diagnostic assays.
Yersinia whole-genome comparisons

We performed a multiple alignment of the 11 Yersinia
species using the MAUVE algorithm [46] (from here on
Y. pestis CO92 and Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 were
used as the representative genomes of their species) and
obtained 98 locally collinear blocks (LCBs; Additional
files 13, 14, [47]). The mean length of the LCBs was
23,891 bp. The shortest block was 1,570 bp, and the
longest was 201,130 bp. This multiple alignment of the
‘core’ region on average covered 52% of each Yersinia
genome. The nucleotide diversity (Π) for the concatenated aligned region was 0.27, or an approximate genuswide nucleotide sequence homology of 73%. As expected
for a set of bacteria with this level of diversity, the alignment of the genomes shows evidence of multiple large
genome rearrangements [23] (Additional file 13).
Using an automated pipeline for annotation and
clustering of protein orthologs based on the Markov
chain clustering tool MCL [48], we estimated the size
of the Yersinia protein core set to be 2,497 and the
pan-genome [49] to be 27,470 (Additional files 15, 16,
17, 18). The core number falls asymptotically as genomes are introduced and hence this estimate is somewhat lower than the recent analysis of only the Y.
enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis genomes (2,747 core proteins) [15]. We found 681 genes
to be in exactly one copy in each Yersinia genome and
to be nearly identical in length. We used ClustalW
[50] to align the members of this highly conserved set,
and concatenated individual gene product alignments
to make a dataset of 170,940 amino acids for each of
the species. Uninformative characters were removed
from the dataset and a phylogeny of the genus was
computed using Phylip [51] (Figure 1). The topology
of this tree was identical whether distance or parsimony methods were used (Additional files 19, 20) and
was also identical to a tree based on the nucleotide
sequence of the approximately 1.5 Mb of the core genome in LCBs (see above). The genus broke down into
three major clades: the outlying fish pathogen, Y. ruckeri; Y. pestis/Y. pseudotuberculosis; and the remainder
of the ‘enterocolitica’-like species. Y. kristensenii
ATCC33638T was the nearest neighbor of Y. enterocolitica 8081. The outlying position of Y. ruckeri was

Page 5 of 18

confirmed further when we analyzed the contribution
of the genome to reducing the size of the Yersinia
core protein families set. If Y. ruckeri was excluded,
the Yersinia core would be 2,232 protein families of
N = 2 rather than 2,072 (Table 4). In contrast, omission of any one of the 10 other species only reduced
the set by a maximum of 22 families.
Clustering the significant Cluster of Orthologous
Groups (COG) hits [52] for each genome hierarchically
(Figure 2) yielded a similar pattern for the three basic
clades. The overall composition of the COG matches in
each genome, as measured by the proportion of the
numbers in each COG supercategory, was similar
throughout the genus, with the notable exceptions of
the high percentage of group L COGs in Y. pestis due to
the expansion of IS recombinases and the relatively
low number of group G (sugar metabolism) COGs in
Y. ruckeri (Figure 2).
Shared protein clusters in pathogenic Yersinia:
yersiniabactin biosynthesis is the key chromosomal
function specific to high virulence in humans

The Yersinia proteomes were investigated for common
clusters in the three high virulence species missing from
the low human virulence genomes (Figure 3). Because of
the close evolutionary relationship of the ‘enterocolictica’ clade strains, the number of unique protein clusters
in Y. enterocolitica was reduced to a greater degree than
the more phylogentically isolated Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Many of the same genome islands identified as recent horizontal acquisition by Y. pestis and/or
Y. pseudotuberculosis [9,13,15] were not present in any
of the newly sequenced genomes. However, some genes,
interesting from the perspective of the host specificity of
the Y. pestis/Y. pseutoberculosis ancestor, were detected
in other Yersinia species for the first time. These
included orthologs of YPO3720/YPO3721, a hemolysin
and activator protein in Y. intermedia, Y. bercovieri and
Y. fredricksenii; YPO0599, a heme utilization protein
also found in Y. intermedia; and YPO0399, an enhancin
metalloprotease that had an ortholog in Y. kristensenii
(ykris0001_41250). Enhancin was originally identified as
a factor promoting baculovirus infection of gypsy moth
midgut by degradation of mucin [53]. Other loci in Y.
pestis/Y. pseudotuberculosis linked with insect infection,
the TccC and TcABC toxin clusters [54], were also
found in Y. mollaretti. In Y. mollaretti the Tca and Tcc
proteins show about 90% sequence identity to Y. pestis/
Y. pseudotuberculsis and share identical flanking chromosomal locations. Further work will need to be undertaken to resolve whether the insertion of the toxin
genes in Y. mollaretti is an independent horizontal
transfer event or occurred prior to divergence of the
species.

clade and Y. pestis or Y. pseudotuberculosis gave a similar result in terms of numbers and types of shared protein clusters.
Only sixteen clusters of chromosomal proteins were
found to be common to all three high-virulence species
but absent from all eight non-pathogens (Figure 3). Eleven of these are components of the yersiniabactin biosynthesis operon (Additional file 21), further
highlighting the critical importance of this iron binding
siderophore for invasive disease. The other proteins are
generally small proteins that are likely included because
they fall in unassembled regions of the eight draft genomes. One other small island of three proteins constituting a multi-drug efflux pump (YE0443 to YE0445)
was common to the high-virulence species but missing
from the eight draft low-virulence species.
Variable regions of Y. enterocolitica clade genomes

After comparison of the new low virulence genomes,
the number of protein clusters shared by Y. enterocolitica and the other two pathogens was reduced to 12 and
13 for Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis, respectively
(Figure 3). The remaining shared proteins were either
identified as phage-related or of unknown role, providing few clues to possible functions that might define distinct pathogenic niches. Performing a similar analysis

The basic metabolic similarities of Y. enterocolitica and
the seven species on the main branch of the Yersinia
genus phylogenetic tree are further illustrated in Figure

related bacterial genomes are compared [55]. One of the
largest islands found in Y. enterocolitica 8081 was the
66-kb Y. pseudotuberculosis adhesion pathogenicity
island (YAPIye) [15,56,57], a unique feature of biotype
1B strains. YAPIye, containing a type IV pilus gene cluster and other putative virulence determinants, such as
arsenic resistance, is similar to a 99-kb YAPIpst that is
found in several other serotypes of Y. pseudotuberculosis
[14,57] but is missing in Y. pestis and the serotype I Y.

been proposed for the acquisition of YAPI in a common
ancestor of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica
and subsequent degradation to various degrees within
the Y. pseudotuberculosis clade. However, the complete
absence of YAPI from any of the seven species in the Y.
enterocolitica branch (Figure 4), as well as from most
strains of Y. enterocolitica [15], argues against an ancient
acquisition of YAPI, but instead suggests the recent

enterocolitica in general and biotype 1B in particular
turned out to have orthologs in the low human virulence species sequenced in this study. These included
several putative biotype 1B-specific genes identified by
microarray-based screening [58], including YE0344
HylD hemophore (yinte0001_41550 has 78% nucleotide

sensor kinase, which had orthologs in all species. Large
portions of the biogroup 1B-specific island containing
the Yts1 type II secretion system were found in Y. ruckeri, Y. mollaretii, and Y. aldovae. Y. aldovae and Y. mollaretii also had islands containing ysa type three
secretion systems (TTSS) with 75 to 85% nucleotide
identity to the homolog in Y. enterocolitica 1B. The

ysagenes are a chromosomal cluster [9,13,15] that in Y.
enterocolitica, at least, appears to play a role in virulence
[59]. The Y. enterocolitica ysa genes are found in the
plasticity zone (Figure 4) and have very low similarity to
the Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis ysa genes (which
are more similar to the Salmonella SPI-2 island [60,61])
and are found between orthologs of YPO0254 and
YPO0274 [9]. Species within the Yersinia genus had
either the Y. enterocolitica type of ysa TTSS locus or
the Y. pestis/SPI-2 type (with the exception of Y. aldovae, which has both; Additional file 22). This suggested
the exchange of chromosomal TTSS genes within
Yersinia.
The modular nature of the islands found in the Y.
enterocolitica genome was demonstrated further by two
examples gleaned from comparison with the evolutionarily closest low human virulence genome, Y. kristensenii
ATCC 33638T (Figure 1). The YGI-3 island [15] in Y.
enterocolitica 8081 is a degraded integrated plasmid; at
the same chromosomal locus in Y. kristensenii ATCC
33638T a prophage was found, suggesting that the YGI3 location may be a recombinational hotspot. Another
Y. enterocolitica 8081 island, YGI-1, encodes a ‘tight
adherence’ (tad) locus responsible for non-specific surface binding. Y. kristensenii ATCC 33638T had an identical 13 gene tad locus in the same position, but the
nucleotide sequence identity of the region to Y. enterocolitica 8081 was uniformly lower than that found for
the rest of the genome, suggesting there had been either
a gene conversion event replacing the tad locus with a
set of new alleles in the recent history of Y. kristensenii
or Y. enterocolitica or the locus was under very high
positive selective pressure.
Niche-specific metabolic adaptations in the Yersinia genus

Comparison of the Y. enterocolitica genome to Y. pestis
and Y. pseudotuberculosis revealed some potentially

significant metabolic differences that may account for
varying tropisms in gastric infections [62]. Y. enterocolitica 8081 alone contained entire gene clusters for cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis (cbi), 1,2-propanediol
utilization (pdu), and tetrathionate respiration (ttr). In Y.
enterocolitica and Salmonella typhimurium [63,64], vitamin B12 is produced under anaerobic conditions where
it is used as a cofactor in 1,2-propanediol degradation,
with tetrathionate serving as an electron acceptor. This
study showed the genes for this pathway to be a general
feature of species in the ‘enterocolitica’ branch of the
Yersinia genus (with the caveat that some portions are
missing in some species; for example, Y. rohdei is missing the pdu cluster (Table 5). Additionally, Y. intermedia, Y. bercovieri, and Y. mollaretii contained gene
clusters encoding degradation of the membrane lipid
constituent ethanolamine. Ethanolamine metabolism
under anaerobic conditions also requires the B12 cofactor. Y. intermedia contained the full 17-gene cluster
reported in S. typhimurium [65], including structural
components of the carboxysome organelle. Another discovery from the Y. enterocolitica genome analysis was
the presence of two compact hydrogenase gene clusters,
Hyd-2 and Hyd-4 [15]. Hydrogen released from fermentation by intestinal microflora is imputed to be an
important energy source for enteric gut pathogens [66].
Both gene clusters are conserved across all the other
seven enterocolitica-branch species, but are missing
from Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Y. ruckeri contained a single [NiFe]-containing hydrogenase complex.
Y. ruckeri, the most evolutionarily distant member of
the genus (Figure 1) with the smallest genome (3.7 Mb),
had several features that were distinctive from its cogeners. The Y. ruckeri O-antigen operon contained a neuB
sialic acid synthase gene, therefore the bacterium was
predicted to produce a sialated outer surface structure.

only in Y. ruckeri were those for xylose utilization and
urease activity, consistent with phenotypes that have
long been known in clinical microbiology [67] (Table 3).
Surprisingly, we discovered that Y. ruckeri was also
missing the mtnKADCBEU gene cluster that comprises
the majority of the methionine salvage pathway [68]
found in most other Yersiniae. These genes have also
been deleted from Y. pestis, but as with Y. ruckeri, the
mtnN (methylthioadenosine nucleosidase) is maintained.
The loss of these genes in Y. pestis has been interpreted
as a consequence of adaptation to an obligate hostdwelling lifecycle, where the availability of the sulfurcontaining amino acids is not a nutritional limitation
[15].

Discussion
Whole-genome shotgun sequencing by high-throughput
bead-based pyrosequencing has proved remarkably useful for the large-scale sequencing of closely related bacteria [49,69-74]. High-quality de novo assemblies can be
obtained with relatively few errors and gaps when the
sequence read coverage redundancy is 15-fold or
greater. Closing all the gaps in each genome sequence is
time-consuming and costly; therefore, in the near future
there will be an excess of draft bacterial sequences versus closed genomes in public databases. Our analysis
strategy here melds both draft and complete genomes
using consistent automated annotation that is scalable
to encompass potentially much larger datasets. High
quality draft sequencing is likely to shortly supersede
comparative genome hybridization using microarrays
[25,58,75,76] as the most popular strategy for genomewide bacterial comparisons. Genome sequence datasets
can be used to shed light on the novel functions in
close relatives that may have been lost in the pathogen
of interest, as well as orthologs in genomes that fall
below the threshold for hybridization-based detection.
The problems of using microarrays for comparisons of
more diverse bacterial taxa are illustrated in a study of
the Yersinia genus, using many of the strains sequenced
in this work, where the estimated number of core genes
was found to be only 292 [25].
We cannot claim complete coverage of all the type
strains of the Yersinia genus, as three new species have
been created [77-79] since our work began. Nonetheless,
from this extensive genomic survey we have attempted
to categorize the features that define Yersinia. The core
of about 2,500 proteins present in all 11 species is not a
subset of any other enterobacterial genome. Species of
the Y. enterocolitica clade (Figure 1) have overall a similar array of protein functions and contain a number of
conserved gene clusters (cobalamin, hydrogenases,
ureases, and so on) found in other bacteria (Helicobacter, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Escherichia coli) that

Page 11 of 18

colonize the mammalian gut. Y. pestis has lost many of
these genes by deletion or disruption since its split from
the enteric pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis and adoption
of an insect vector-mediated pathogenicity mode. The
smaller Y. ruckeri chromosome does not appear to result
from recent reductive evolution (as is the case of Y. pestis), evidenced by the relatively low number of frameshifts and pseudogenes, and the normal amount of
repetitive contigs in the newbler genome assembly. Like
Y. pestis, Y. ruckeri lacks urease, methionine salvage
genes, and B12-related metabolism. The prevailing consensus is that the pathway of transmission of red mouth
disease in fish is gastrointestinal yet the similarities of Y.
ruckeri genome reduction to Y. pestis hint at an alternative mode of infection for Y. ruckeri.
This comparative genomic study reaffirms that the
distinguishing features of the high-level mammalian
pathogens is the acquisition of a particular set of
mobile elements: HPI, the pYV, pMT1 and pPCP plasmids, and the YADI island. However, the eight species
sequenced in this study believed to have either low or
zero potential for human infection, contain numerous,
apparently horizontally transferred genes that would be
considered putative virulence determinants if discovered in the genome of a more serious pathogen. Two
examples are yaldo0001_40900 (bile salt hydrolase) and
yfred0001_36480, an ortholog of the TibA adhesin of
enterotoxigenic E. coli. Bile salt hydrolase in pathogenic Brucella abortus has been shown to enhance bile
resistance during oral mouse infections [80] and the
TibA adhesin forms a biofilm that mediates human
cell invasion [81]. The low-virulence species contain a
similar (and in some cases greater) number of matches
to known drug resistance mechanisms that have been
curated in the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database
[82] (Additional file 23, [83]). Adding DNA, stirring
and reducing [17] is, therefore, the general recipe for
Yersinia genome evolution rather than a formula specific to pathogens. Comparative genomic studies such as
these can be used to enhance our ability to rapidly
assess the virulence potential of a genome sequence of
an emerging pathogen and we plan to continue to
build more extensive databases of non-pathogenic Yersinia genomes that will allow us to draw conclusions
with more statistical power possible than just 11 representative species.

Conclusions
Genomes of the 11 Yersinia species studied range in
estimated size from 3.7 to 4.8 Mb. The nucleotide diversity (Π) of the conserved backbone based on large collinear conserved blocks was calculated to be 0.27. There
were no orthologs of genes and predicted proteins in
the virulence-associated plasmids pYV, pMT1, and pPla,

Chen et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R1
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/1/R1

and the HPI of Y. pestis in the genomes of the type
strains - eight non- or low-pathogenic Yersinia species
Apart from functions encoded on the aforementioned
plasmids, HPI and YAPI regions, only nine proteins
detected as common to all three Yersinia pathogen species (Y. pestis, Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis) were not found on at least one of the other eight
species. Therefore, our study is in agreement with the
hypothesis that genes acquired by recent horizontal
transfer effectively define the members of the Yersinia
genus virulent for humans.
The core proteome of the 11 Yersinia species consists
of approximately 2,500 proteins. Yersinia genomes had a
similar global partition of protein functions, as measured
by the distribution of COG families. Genome to genome
variation in islands with genes encoding functions such
as ureases, hydrogenases and B12 cofactor metabolite
reactions may reflect adaptations to colonizing specific
host habitats.
Y. ruckeri, a salmonid fish pathogen, is the earliest
branching member of the genus and has the smallest
genome (3.7 Mb). Like Y. pestis, Y. ruckeri lacks functional urease, methionine salvage genes, and B12-related
metabolism. These losses may reflect adaptation to a
lifestyle that does not include colonization of the mammalian gut.
The absence of the YAPI island in any of the seven ‘Y.
enterocolitica clade’ genomes likely indicates that YAPI
was acquired independently in Y. enterocolitica and Y.
pseudotuberculosis.
We identified 171 and 100 regions within the genomes
of Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica, respectively, that represented potential candidates for the design of nucleotide
sequence-based assays for unique detection of each
pathogen.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains

Type strains of the eight Yersinia species sequenced in
this study (Table 1) were acquired from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and propagated at 37°
C or 25°C (Y. ruckeri) on Luria media. DNA for genome
sequencing was prepared from overnight broth cultures
propagated from single colonies streaked on a Luria
agar plate using the Promega Wizard Maxiprep System
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Genome sequencing and assembly

Genomes were sequenced using the Genome Sequencer
20 Instrument (454 Life Sequencing Inc., Branford, CT)
[34]. Libraries for sequencing were prepared from 5 μg
of genomic DNA. The sequencing reads for each project
were assembled de novo using the newbler program
(version 01.51.02; 454 Life Sciences Inc).

Page 12 of 18

Optical mapping

Optical maps [38] for each genome using the restriction
enzymes AflII and NheI (Y. aldovae and Y. kristensenii
only have maps for AflII) were constructed by Opgen
Inc. (Madison, WI). The newbler assemblies for each
genome were scaffolded using the optical maps and the
SOMA package [39] (Additional file 4). Assemblies that
did not align against the optical map were tested for
high read coverage, unusual GC content, and good
matches to plasmid-associated genes from the ACLAME
database [84] (BLAST E-value less than 10-20) to identify
sequences that could potentially be part of an extrachromosomal element.
Detection of disrupted genes

We used two methods for detecting disrupted proteins
used. In the first method clustered protein groups were
used to adduce evidence for possible gene disruption
events. The clusters were parsed for pairs of proteins
that met the following criteria: both from the same genome; encoded by genes located on the same strand with
less than 200 bp separating their frames; and total
length of the combined genes was not greater than
120% of the longest gene in the cluster. The second
method used was the FSFIND algorithm [85] with a
standard bacterial gene model to compare the accumulation of predicted frameshifts across different genomes.
Assembly validation

In order to rule out artifacts due to undocumented
features of the newbler assemblies, new assemblies
were generated for validation purposes by re-mapping
all the shotgun reads to the sequence of the assembled
contigs using AMOScmp [86]. The resulting assembly
was then subjected to analysis using the amosvalidate
package [37]. The output of this program includes a
list of genomic regions that contain inconsistencies
highlighting possible misassemblies. The resulting
regions were manually inspected to reduce the possibility of assembly errors. The regions flagged by the
amosvalidate package are provided in GFF (general
feature format), compatible with most genome browsers (Additional file 3).
Insertion sequences and de novo repeat finding

The presence of repeats is known to confound assembly
programs and the newbler assembler is known to collapse
high-fidelity repeat instances into a single contig. To
account for the possibility of such misassemblies, we
computed the copy number of contigs based on coverage
statistics and used this information to correct our estimates for the abundance of classes of repeats (Additional
file 3). To find known insertion sequences, the genomes
were scanned for matches using the IS finder web service

Chen et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R1
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/1/R1

[40] with a BLAST E-value threshold of 10-10 (matches to
known repeat contigs were counted as multiple matches
based on the coverage of the contig). In addition, we
searched for common repeat sequences in the genome
using the RepeatScout program [41] after duplicating
known repeat contigs. The repeats found in each genome
were collected (64 sequences) and transformed into a
non-redundant set of 44 sequences using the CD-HIT
program [87] (Additional file 6). The repeats found were
then searched against all the genomes using BLAST with
an E-value threshold of 10 -10 to record matches. The
resultant figures for repeat content are estimations that
may be lower than the true number found in the
genomes.

Whole-genome alignment using MAUVE

Finding unique DNA signatures in Y. pestis and Y.
enterocolitica

DNA signatures for the Y. pestis and the Y. enterocolitica genomes were identified using the Insignia pipeline
[44]. Signatures of 100 bp or longer were considered
good candidates for the design of detection assays.
These signatures were then compared with the genomes
of the Yersinia strains sequenced during the current
study using the MUMmer package [88] with default
parameters. Signatures that matched by more than 40
bp were deemed invalidated, as they would likely lead to
false-positive results.
Automated annotation

We used DIYA [89] for automated annotation, which
is a pipeline for integrating bacterial analysis tools.
Using DIYA, the assemblies generated by newbler were
scaffolded based on the optical map, concatenated, and
used as a template for the programs GLIMMER [90],
tRNASCAN-SE [91], and RNAmmer [92] for prediction of open reading frames and RNA genes, respectively. All predicted proteins encoded by each coding
sequence were compared against a database of all proteins predicted from the canonical annotation of Y.
pestis CO92 [9] as a preliminary screen for potentially
novel functions. The GenBank format files created
from the eight genomes sequenced in this study were
combined with other DIYA-annotated, published
whole genomes to form a dataset for analysis. All proteins were searched against the UniRef50 database
(July 2008) [93] using BLASTP [94] and against the
Conserved Domain Database [95] using RPSBLAST
[96] with an E-value threshold of 10 -10 to record
matches.
Database accession numbers

The annotated genome data were submitted to NCBI
GenBank and the sequence data submitted to the NCBI

Yersinia genomes were aligned using the standard
MAUVE [46] algorithm with default settings. A cutoff
for 1,500 bp was set as the minimum LCB length.
LCBs for each genome were extracted from the output
of the program and concatenated. From the alignment
nucleotide diversity was calculated by an in-house
script using positions where there was a base in all 11
genomes. Because of the size of the dataset, the calculated value of Π is very robust in terms of sequence
error. We calculated that 112,696 nucleotides of
sequence in the concatenated core would have to be
wrong to alter the estimation of P by ± 5% (Additional
file 24). PHYLIP [51] programs were used to build a
consensus tree of the MAUVE alignment with bootstrapping 1,000 replicates. The underlying model for
each replicate was Fitch-Margoliash. The final phylogeny was resolved according to the majority consensus
rule.
Clustering protein orthologs

The complete predicted proteome from all genomes
annotated in this study was searched against itself
using BLASTP with default parameters. We removed
short, spurious, and non-homologous hits by setting a
bitscore/alignment length filtering threshold of 0.4 and
minimum protein length of 30. Predicted proteins passing this filter were clustered into families based on
these normalized distances using the MCL algorithm
[48] with an inflation parameter value of 4. These
parameters were based on an investigation of clustering 12 completed E. coli genomes, which produced
very similar results to a previous study [42].
Whole genome phylogenetic reconstruction

From the results of clustering analysis, 681 proteins
were found that had exactly one member in each of the
genomes and the length of each protein in the cluster
was nearly identical. These protein sequences were

Chen et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R1
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/1/R1

aligned using ClustalW [50], and individual gene alignments were concatenated into a string of 170,940 amino
acids for each genome. Uninformative characters were
removed from the dataset using Gblocks [97] and a phylogeny reconstructed with PHYLIP [51] under a neighbor-joining model. To evaluate node support, a majority
rule-consensus tree of 1,000 bootstrap replicates was
computed.
