Abstract
Background: The co-translational incorporation of selenocysteine into nascent polypeptides by
recoding the UGA stop codon occurs in all domains of life. In eukaryotes, this event requires at
least three specific factors: SECIS binding protein 2 (SBP2), a specific translation elongation factor
(eEFSec), selenocysteinyl tRNA, and a cis-acting selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element
in selenoprotein mRNAs. While the phylogenetic relationships of selenoprotein families and the
evolution of selenocysteine usage are well documented, the evolutionary history of SECIS binding
proteins has not been explored.
Results: In this report we present a phylogeny of the eukaryotic SECIS binding protein family
which includes SBP2 and a related protein we herein term SBP2L. Here we show that SBP2L is an
SBP2 paralogue in vertebrates and is the only form of SECIS binding protein in invertebrate
deuterostomes, suggesting a key role in Sec incorporation in these organisms, but an SBP2/SBP2L
fusion protein is unable to support Sec incorporation in vitro. An in-depth phylogenetic analysis of
the conserved L7Ae RNA binding domain suggests an ancestral relationship with ribosomal protein
L30. In addition, we describe the emergence of a motif upstream of the SBP2 RNA binding domain
that shares significant similarity with a motif within the pseudouridine synthase Cbf5.
Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that SECIS binding proteins arose once in evolution but
diverged significantly in multiple lineages. In addition, likely due to a gene duplication event in the
early vertebrate lineage, SBP2 and SBP2L are paralogous in vertebrates.

Background
All domains of life possess the ability to recode select UGA
codons from a translation termination signal to a selenocysteine (Sec) codon. The translation products of successful Sec incorporation are termed selenoproteins. In
eukaryotes the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon by the
protein synthetic machinery requires a cis-acting Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element in the 3' untranslated
regions (UTRs) of selenoprotein mRNAs. Eukaryotic

SECIS elements are stable stem-loop structures that are
comprised of two helices separated by a kink-turn containing a conserved GA quartet (SECIS core) and an apical
AAR motif that is present either as a terminal loop (Form
1) or a terminal bulge (Form 2) [reviewed in [1]]. The
trans-acting factors known to be required for Sec incorporation are SECIS binding protein 2 (SBP2), Sec-tRNASec,
and the Sec specific translation elongation factor, eEFSec.
SBP2 is the most studied of the known trans-acting

eukaryotic Sec incorporation factors. Structure/function
studies of rat SBP2 have delineated three domains: a putative regulatory domain comprising the N-terminal half of
the protein (aa 1-407; human numbering is used throughout unless otherwise noted), a Sec incorporation domain
(SID; aa 408-545) and an RNA binding domain (RBD, aa
623-784) [2,3]. The SBP2 RBD contains an L7Ae motif
that binds the kink-turn structure found in SECIS RNA
[4,5]. While the RBD is capable of interacting with SECIS
elements alone, its affinity is greatly enhanced by the SID.
An SBP2/SECIS complex recruits eEFSec and a model was
proposed that in the SBP2/SECIS/eEFSec complex the SID
is conformationally competent to prime the ribosome for
Sec incorporation [2].
Previous studies have noted the existence of an apparent
SBP2 paralogue, termed KIAA0256 in sequence databases
and referred to in the literature as SBP2-like protein [3,6].
Current NCBI annotations for KIAA0256 have adopted
the nomenclature SECISBP2L, which we abbreviate here
as SBP2L. SBP2L has an L7Ae RNA binding motif and a
domain with clear sequence homology to the SID. Despite
the similarity to SBP2, the C-terminal fragment of human

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/229

SBP2L (aa 467-1101) that is analogous to the fully functional C-terminal fragment of SBP2 (aa 408-854) was not
competent for Sec incorporation in vitro and displayed
only minimal SECIS binding [3].
The evolutionary histories of selenoprotein families have
been well documented, but to date SBP2 phylogeny has
only been analyzed in insects [7]. As such we sought to
gather more evolutionary insight into Sec incorporation
by undertaking a phylogenetic analysis of SBP2 as well as
a study of its relationship to SBP2L. Based on genome
analysis, we speculate that mammalian SBP2L may play a
role in selenoprotein expression but we also show that an
SBP2L/SBP2 chimeric protein is unable to promote Sec
incorporation in vitro. Additionally, we trace the lineage of
the SBP2/SBP2L RNA binding domain to archaeal ribosomal protein L30.

Results and discussion
SBP2L and SBP2 diverged during vertebrate evolution
The occurrence of SBP2 and SBP2L among eukaryotes can
be divided into three major categories. Figure 1 provides a

module in Geneious (Biomatters Ltd). The N and C-terminal portions of SBP2 and SBP2L were independently aligned. Residues
were colored using JalView based on BLOSUM62 score [[37]; darker colors indicate higher similarity]. The SBP2L N-terminal
sequence is red to denote that it is a separate alignment from that for SBP2. Globally conserved motifs motifs include the Sec
incorporation domain (SID), the RNA binding domain (RBD), LSAD15-26 and PFVQ44-56. Shading of species names is used for
the identification of SBP2 classes as described in the text.

bal sequence alignment that includes examples of SBP2
and its homologues from a broad sampling of species that
are known to express selenoproteins. The first category is
found in most vertebrates (red shading), which possess a
version of SBP2 that contains a ~400 amino acid N-terminal extension upstream of two domains known to be
required for Sec incorporation: the Sec incorporation
domain (SID) and the SECIS RNA binding domain
(RBD). In addition to SBP2, vertebrates also possess the
aforementioned SBP2-like protein, SBP2L (yellow shading), which also contains an N-terminal extension that is
only partially related to that found in SBP2. The second
category includes most protostomes as well as unicellular
green algae and slime molds (Figure 1, green shading),
which possess a version of SBP2 that lacks the N-terminal
extension found in mammals. Lastly, the third category
consists of invertebrate deuterostomes (violet shading),
which possess only SBP2L. While all of the organisms
studied for this report contain sequences related to the
SID and RBD, the N-terminal portion of SBP2/SBP2L is
highly variable as exemplified by the versions of SBP2
found in frog (Xenopus tropicalis), fish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), black legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the placazoan, Trichoplax adhaerens.
In order to determine if the core conserved regions of
SBP2 and SBP2L are phylogenetically distinguishable, we
performed a global sequence alignment of the C-terminal
portions of both proteins. We obtained full length
sequences either from the NCBI Refseq database or
genomic sequence from a broad taxonomic sampling
ranging from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals.
Sequences derived from genomic data were compiled by
gene prediction using FgenesH [8] and/or Genomescan
[9]. Only sequences that could be validated with
expressed sequence tag (EST) data were used. A global
sequence alignment containing the entirety of all 47
sequences was generated using the MUSCLE algorithm.
For the purposes of phylogenetic analysis, non-conserved
sequences were eliminated using GBlocks leaving only the
highly conserved regions in the SID (G518-K529) and
RBD (K639-G754). Figure 2 shows a phylogenetic tree
based on maximum likelihood using the Whelan & Goldman substitution model in PhyML [[10,11]; see Additional file 1 for raw sequence alignment data]. The
resulting tree illustrates the segregation of vertebrate SBP2
and SBP2L into separate sub-clades restricting the occurrence of SBP2L to all deuterostomes, the mollusk (Lottia
gigantea), and an annelid worm (Capitella sp.I). In addition, Figure 2 shows that SBP2L from the invertebrate deuterostomes (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Branchiostoma
floridae, Ciona savignyi, Ciona intestinalis, and Saccoglossus
kowalevskii), a mollusk L. gigantia, and the annelid worm
C. sp.I are in a separate clade from that of vertebrates.
Despite this distinction we maintain that the SBPs in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/229

invertebrate deuterostomes, L. gigantia and C. sp.I are
SBP2L due to the presence of conserved motifs found in
vertebrate SBP2L but not SBP2 (see below). Since the only
form of a SECIS binding protein in these organisms (see
below), which are known to possess selenoprotein genes,
is SBP2L, it is highly probable that SBP2L is carrying out
the functions of SBP2 in these cases. These results indicate
that even when only the highly conserved SID and RBD
regions are considered, SBP2 and SBP2L are phylogenetically distinct.
In order to examine the specific features that discriminate
between SBP2 and SBP2L within the conserved SID and
RBD, we examined an expanded multiple sequence alignment that includes the regions used to generate the tree in
Figure 2. Within these highly conserved regions, there are
individual residues that are found predominantly in
either SBP2L or SBP2 (positions marked with an arrow,
Figure 3A and 3B). These include G454, Q520 and S532
(human SBP2 numbering) in the SID and K650, L681,
N730 and Q756 in the RBD. Considering the proximity of
these residues to those known to be required for Sec incorporation (Q520), ribosome binding (D454) and SECIS
binding (A532, K650, L681 and N730) in SBP2 [2,12,13],
it is likely that some of these residues may be required for
sequence specific RNA binding in the case of the RBD and
specific integration of an RBD-dependent signal (i.e. eEFSec or ribosome conformation) in the case of the SID. The
alignment shown in Figure 3 also serves to highlight two
sequence motifs that are conserved among deuterostomes
but also in a mosaic of protostomes and unicellular
eukaryotes (QLDL449-452 and FRDY629-632). Conserved
motifs are designated as the human SBP2 or SBP2L
sequence corresponding to the four most highly conserved residues in the motif with numbers indicating the
full range of conserved sequence. If a motif is found in
both SBP2 and SBP2L, the SBP2 numbering is used. The
QLDL449-452 motif is found in the cnidarian Nematostella
vectensis but not in the protostome Drosophila melanogaster. On the other hand it is found in the mosquito
Anopheles gambiae but not in Dictyostelium discoideum. In
contrast, FRDY629-632 is found in all protostomes surveyed,
but among unicellular eukaryotes and other metazoans
representing ancient lineages it is only present in D. discoideum, Monosiga brevicollis, Emiliania huxleyi and T. adhaerens. These results suggest that both of these motifs were
present in the last common ancestor of Sec-utilizing
eukaryotes but that they were lost during the evolution of
select lineages, likely due to specific constraints (or relief
of constraints) at the level of the SECIS element or ribosome.
Biochemical characterization of SBP2L has been limited,
but early tests showed that the C-terminal portion of the
protein, which is ~45% identical to the fully functional C-

The SBP3SID and RBD are highly conserved across Eukarya
The SBP SID and RBD are highly conserved across Eukarya. (A) An extraction of the SBP2 and SBP2L SID region from
the global multiple sequence alignment described for Figure 2 prior to GBlocks treatment. The non-conserved region between
464-505 (human SBP2 numbering) was deleted. (B) An extraction of the SBP2 and SBP2L RBD region as in (A). Nonconserved
sequences from M. brevicollis, E. huxleyi, and T. gondii that introduced large gaps in the region were deleted. In addition the
sequence from S. purpuratus was omitted from this alignment due the presence of several large non-conserved regions that disrupted the entire global alignment. Positions that are consistently variable between SBP2 and SBP2L are indicated with red
arrows and the identity/number refers to the position in human SBP2. Underlined sequence corresponds to the GBlocks output that was used to generate the tree in Figure 2. Blue shaded boxes indicate conserved motifs that are only sporadically
found in unicellular organisms.

terminal SBP2 counterpart in humans, was unable to support Sec incorporation in vitro. This correlated with the
fact that SBP2L only weakly bound the GPX4 SECIS that
was used in this assay [3]. These preliminary biochemical
analyses, together with the fact that SBP2L is the only
form of SBP in invertebrate deuterostomes (see below) as
well as the fact that it is not found in organisms that do
not express selenoproteins (e.g. higher plants and fungi;
data not shown), suggest that SBP2L is involved in selenoprotein synthesis. To gain further insight into the potential function for SBP2L and the evolutionary origins of
SECIS binding proteins, we first delineated the major features that distinguish SBP2L from SBP2. SBP2L is consistently larger in size than SBP2 as the average predicted
molecular weight of chicken, rat, human, dog, and horse
SBP2L is 126 kDa while that of SBP2 from the same spe-

cies is 98 kDa. In terms of sequence similarity, several
important differences are notable. Figure 4 illustrates a
global sequence alignment containing vertebrate SBP2,
SBP2L from all of the 17 species that we have identified as
possessing complete SBP2L sequence, and unique variants of SBP2 from I. scapularis and T. adhaerens. The
method used for identifying SBP2 and SBP2L sequences as
well as the complete amino acid sequences and accession
numbers used for this study are found in Additional files
2 and 3 respectively. Significant sequence similarity
between SBP2 and SBP2L is limited to the regions comprising the SID and RBD. The N-terminal portions are
much more divergent with the exception of two small
motifs present at the N-terminus of both SBP2L and SBP2:
LSAD15-26 and PFVQ44-56, the former of which has been
previously noted [14]. These motifs are separated by

degenerate sequence of variable length, generally 29-30
residues in SBP2L and 18 residues in SBP2. A detailed
sequence alignment of this region is shown in Figure 4B.
Interestingly, we found that an arthropod (the tick I.
scapularis) and the placozoan, T. adhaerens (considered by
some to be representative of the most ancient metazoans
[15]) also contain an N-terminal LSAD15-26 but not the
PFVQ44-56 motif, thus representing exceptions to the
apparent restriction of the LSAD15-26 motif to deuterostomes. It is also noteworthy that SBP2 from frog (X. tropicalis) and fish (T. nigroviridis) lacks both of these motifs
yet they are present in their respective versions of SBP2L.
Since we have identified both of these motifs in lizard
(Anolis carolinensis) SBP2, we speculate that the LSAD15-26
and PFVQ44-56 motifs were lost in the lineages giving rise
to fish and amphibians. In addition, Papp et al [16]
recently identified several splice variants of human SBP2,
the most abundant of which encodes a mitochondrial targeted protein (mtSBP2). Interestingly, this splice isoform
lacks both the LSAD15-26 and PFVQ44-56 motifs but retains
the SBP2-specific motifs presented below. Additionally,
the authors suggested that mtSBP2 may be unique to
humans based on comparison to other mammals and
chicken.
SBP2L and SBP2 are further distinguished by the presence
of highly conserved sequence motifs that are unique to
each protein. Figure 5 highlights these motifs in separate
SBP2 and SBP2L multiple sequence alignments derived
from the same species examined in Figure 4. In SBP2L, the
conserved motifs include QTDF210-252, DSGY265-279,
SEIS442-474, TPVS622-662, PISE844-868 and RIES10161032. In contrast there are only three sites of SBP2-specific
conservation: DFPE216-226, QEPP380-405, which
includes the poly-lysine tract that has been shown to be
active as a nuclear localization signal [17], and IWKK816839. Table 1 provides a summary of the occurrence of thee
motifs in each species analyzed. Interestingly, none of
these regions are annotated in the NCBI Conserved
Domains Database, and PSI-BLAST analysis does not link
them to any other protein families (data not shown), but
the significant degree of identity across highly diverse species makes them important focal points for further investigation into the function and regulation of SBP2 and
SBP2L. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 1, we observed variability in the occurrence of some of the motifs, notably
the lack of DFPE216-226 in frog and the lack of TPVS622662 in the sea squirts (C. intestinalis and C. savignyi) as
well as a the hemichordate acorn worm (Saccoglossus
kowalevskii). These results confirm the phylogeny shown
in Figure 2 demonstrating that SBP2L is not limited to
deuterostomes since we identified SBP2L motifs in a mollusk (L. gigantea), and an annelid worm (Capitella sp.I).
Among the conserved motifs in SBP2L, TPVS622-662 is of
interest because it lies between the SID and RBD, and the
corresponding sequence in SBP2 is degenerate and has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/229

been found to be dispensable for Sec incorporation activity [18]. Considering that a dynamic interaction between
the SID and RBD has been shown to be essential for Sec
incorporation [2], it is likely that the interaction of the
corresponding domains in SBP2L may be regulated by
this conserved stretch of amino acids.
Origins of the SBP2/SBP2L split
BLAST and BLAT searches against the genomes of Lottia,
Capitella, and invertebrate deuterostomes (S. purpuratus,
Ciona savignyi, and C. intestinalis, and Saccoglossus kowalevskii) revealed that SBP2L is the only SECIS binding protein in these organisms. All vertebrate genomes sampled,
however, encoded both SBP2 and SBP2L, suggesting that
a gene duplication near the time of vertebrate emergence
generated the paralogous SBP2/SBP2L pair. The paralogy
of SBP2 and SBP2L in vertebrates is supported by their
inferred phylogeny (Figure 2).

The 2R hypothesis posits that one round of whole genome
duplication coincided with the divergence of vertebrates
and urochordates (e.g. Ciona species) and a second round
of whole genome duplication occurred with the divergence of jawless (lamprey and hagfish) and jawed vertebrates [19]. In the context of the 2R hypothesis, the time
of SBP2/SBP2L divergence is uncertain. Therefore, we
sought to find SBP sequences in the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) genome by BLAT search. We found two
non-overlapping contigs (contigs 9804 and 33761) that
contain parts of an RBD and SID, respectively. However,
there does not appear to be sufficient sequence available
to determine whether or not the sea lamprey genome
encodes one or two SECIS binding proteins and therefore
whether or not SBP2/SBP2L divergence occurred before or
after the radiation of jawed vertebrates. Since we have
only been able to identify two SBPs in vertebrates, this
would suggest, in conjunction with the 2R hypothesis,
that additional copies were lost soon after genome duplication.
While mammalian SBP2L has not been fully biochemically characterized, it is known that human CT-SBP2L (aa
467-1101), which contains the entirety of the SID and
RBD, is not able to support Sec incorporation and weakly
binds the GPX4 SECIS element compared to rat CT-SBP2
(aa 399-846; Figure 6) [20]. Nonetheless, the presence of
just SBP2L in invertebrate deuterstomes and conservation
of the SID and RBD between vertebrate SBP2 and SBP2L
suggests that vertebrate SBP2L may play a role in regulating selenoprotein expression via interactions with SECIS
elements. This begs the question as to whether there is a
correlation between SECIS structure and the occurrence of
SBP2L as the only SBP in an organism. To examine this
potential correlation, we turned to the selenoprotein rich
sea urchin S. purpuratus. We identified 14 SECIS elements
from S. purpuratus using the SECISearch algorithm in

with SBP2L. Additionally, aligning human SECIS elements with those from S. purpuratus and constructing a
phylogeny with PhyML did not generate any clades that

from D. melanogaster is only able to bind Form 2 SECIS
elements but that Form 1 binding is conferred when the
SVRVY95-99 sequence in the SID was changed to that found
in human SBP2 (IILKE535-539). However, the existence of
only form 2 SECIS elements in S. purpuratus was not likely
constrained by SBP2L sequence in this region as it contains a VILKE motif. These results suggest that determinants in the SECIS element for SBP2L interaction lie
outside of the sequences tested or in structural elements
that cannot be detected by sequence alignments. Overall,
these results suggest that SBP2L is a bona fide Sec incorporation factor in invertebrate deutoerstomes, but that it
may have diverfed to fulfill a separate function in vertebrates.
Conservation between SBP2 and SBP2L is not sufficient to
promote Sec insertion
Since SBP2L possesses an RBD that differs from that in
SBP2 at positions known to be required for SECIS bind-

ing, we hypothesized that a fusion protein consisting of
the SBP2L SID and the SBP2 RBD may be able to support
Sec incorporation in vitro. To test this, we engineered an
Age I site in the non-conserved regions between the SID
and RBD of CT-SBP2L and CT-SBP2 and swapped the
domains yielding the following chimeric proteins:
SBP2L467-647/SBP2586-846 (SBP2L-SBP2) and SBP2399-585/
SBP2L648-1101 (SBP2-SBP2L). Figure 6A shows a schematic
of the domain swap. Sec incorporation activity of the chimeric proteins was determined by adding 2 fmol of each
protein to an in vitro Sec incorporation assay that measures the translation of luciferase mRNA containing an inframe UGA codon and GPX4 SECIS element in the 3'-UTR
[22]. Figure 6B shows the amount of Sec incorporation
activity obtained with each protein relative to that
obtained with CT-SBP2. As expected, CT-SBP2L was unable to promote Sec incorporation. Surprisingly, the
SBP2L-SBP2 chimera was also unable to promote Sec
incorporation while the SBP2-SBP2L chimera retained

20% Sec incorporation activity compared to CT-SBP2.
These data indicate that despite strong similarity between
the SID regions in SBP2 and SBP2L, the latter is unable to
promote Sec incorporation in this assay even when
appended to the SBP2 RBD. In order to determine
whether the lack of Sec incorporation activity observed for
the chimeric proteins was due to a lack of SECIS element
binding, we tested whether or not they could bind the
GPX4 SECIS element by electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA). In vitro translated proteins (8 fmol) were
incubated with wild-type or mutant [32P] UTP-labeled
SECIS elements and the complexes resolved by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. This amount of CT-SBP2 is
within the linear range of this binding assay (data not
shown). As expected, CT-SBP2 shifted wild-type but not
mutant SECIS elements in which the AUGA motif in the
SECIS core was deleted (Figure 6C, compare lanes 3 and
9). Consistent with previous results, CT-SBP2L SECIS
binding activity was only ~20% relative to CT-SBP2 (Figure 6C, compare lanes 3 and 4; Figure 6D). Interestingly,
the SBP2L-SBP2 chimera specifically bound the wild-type
SECIS element at ~80% the level of CT-SBP2, while the
SBP2-SBP2L chimera provided only 40% binding relative
to CT-SBP2 (Figure 6D). These results show that a lack of
SECIS element binding does not explain the inability of
the SBP2L-SBP2 chimera to support Sec incorporation. In
addition to SECIS element affinity, the SID is thought to
play a role that is likely downstream of SECIS binding,
such as promoting an eEFSec or ribosomal conformational change. The key residues found to be required for a
function downstream of SECIS element binding were
from P513 to P524 [2].
In light of this we wanted to know whether divergence of
SBP2L and SBP2 in these regions were responsible for the
inability of the SBP2L-SBP2 chimera to promote Sec
incorporation. Specifically, a series of mutations were
made such that either CT-SBP2L or the SBP2L-SBP2 chimera contained the following substitutions: D494G,
SKA556PLM, EK563QR and A567P (human SBP2L numbering). Using Figure 3B as a reference, these substitutions
cover the sites annotated as G454 and Q520 (human
SBP2 numbering). CT-SBP2 and the wild-type or mutant
versions of CT-SBP2L and the SBP2L-SBP2 chimera were
analyzed for their ability to support Sec incorporation in
vitro. Figure 6E shows that none of the substitutions
resulted in an active form of either CT-SBP2L or the
SBP2L-SBP2 chimera. These results demonstrate that the
chimeric protein either contains a negative element that
actively prevents Sec incorporation or that it is missing an
as-yet undetermined element that is required. Further
analysis of the physical interaction between the SBP2L
SID and the SBP2 RBD will be required to determine
which is the more likely explanation for the inability of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/229

the SBP2L SID to support Sec incorporation even when
SECIS binding is restored.
The SBP2 L7Ae RNA binding domain arose from ribosomal
protein L30
Having established the phylogenetic relationship of metazoan SBPs, we sought to determine whether we could elucidate the origins of SBP2. As mentioned above, SBPs
contain an L7Ae RNA binding motif. This motif was identified by Koonin and colleagues [23] as a 32 amino acid
motif (L7Ae core) in primarily ribosomal and ribosomeassociated proteins such as ribosomal protein L30
(RPL30), RPS12, the translation termination factor eRF1,
and RPL7A, among others. This motif features a universally conserved glycine residue 15 amino acids upstream
of a 3 residue hydrophobic cluster [23]. The SBP2 L7Ae
motif is well characterized [4,13,24] and has been shown
to be responsible for sequence-specific SECIS element
binding, although unlike RPL30 [25], for example, high
affinity binding requires a large stretch of sequence N-terminal to the core motif. In order to determine a putative
evolutionary origin of the L7Ae motif in SBP2 and SBP2L
we aligned them with L7Ae core sequences from other
L7Ae-containing proteins using MUSCLE (Additional file
4) and generated a maximum likelihood tree in PhyML
using the WAG substitution model. The tree suggests that
the SBP clade shared a common ancestor with the RPL30
and eRF1 clades (Figure 7). Interestingly, both RPL30 and
RPL7A have been shown to possess SECIS binding activity, and the former was able to stimulate Sec incorporation activity in cells while the latter was inhibitory.
Whether the ability of these proteins to bind SECIS elements is functionally significant, however, remains to be
determined.
The SBP2 SID is of uncertain origin
While the SBP2 RNA binding domain has clear evolutionary roots in ribosomal proteins, the SID is a protein
domain that is unique to the SBP family with no apparent
homology to other protein domains as efforts to identify
molecular relatives by PSI-BLAST failed. Thus, it is possible that the SID arose de novo. Regardless of its origin, the
conservation of the SID core motif in the eukaryotic taxa
presented here (K517-R543) suggests that it arose once in
eukaryotic evolution and that organisms such as D. discoideum and Plasmodium vivax with poorly conserved SID
sequences likely diverged to adapt to as-yet unidentified
unique requirements (Figure 5A).
Archaeal Insight into SBP2
Caban and colleagues recently performed structure/function studies on the SBP2 RNA binding domain including
its L7Ae motif [13]. In this work they noted that SBP2 residues in the region of RFQDR654-658 N-terminal to the
L7Ae core were required for Sec incorporation but not

SECIS element or ribosome binding. Interestingly, these
residues are not conserved among the various subgroups
of the L7Ae superfamily. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether or not this motif and residues in its vicinity
had a discernible relative. A BLASTp search against the
Protein Data Bank with relaxed settings and rat SBP2 as a
query expectedly yielded hits of various L7Ae family
members. However, this search also produced a hit for
Methanococcus jannaschii Cbf5, the H/ACA sRNA guided
pseudouridylate synthase [[26], reviewed in [27]]. Querying the CDD with rat SBP2 and relaxed settings (Expect

Threshold = 10) also yielded a hit against Cbf5 (Expect =
2.3). This corresponded to rat SBP2642-666 and and Pyrococcus horikoshii Cbf5125-150. In addition, PSI-BLAST using full
length rat SBP2 as the initial query independently led to
the identification of Cbf5 as a potential relative (data not
shown). Notably, the only region of significant similarity
is that between RFQDR654-658 and the universally conserved Gly residue in the L7Ae RNA binding motif
(G676). Figure 8 shows a multiple sequence alignment
and phylogenetic tree illustrating the relationship
between the Cbf5 and SBP2. The conservation of this

region among the Cbf5 group from archaea to mammals
is quite high with strong clade support, but the highest
level of conservation is between archaeal Cbf5 and vertebrate SBP2. The substantial divergence between the Cbf5
motif and that observed in SBP2 from unicellular eukaryotes and protostomes and the short length of the motif
suggests that it may have arisen as a result of convergent
evolution.
This finding is intriguing as Cbf5 is known to form a complex with L7Ae as well as Nop10, Gar1, and box H/ACA
s(no)RNAs, which contain kink-turn elements similar to
that in SECIS elements [1,27]. In vivo, Cbf5 catalyzes the
site-specific pseudouridylation of rRNA with the aid of
guide H/ACA s(no)RNAs. Minimally, Cbf5 and Nop10
are required for guided pseudouridylation but maximum
activity requires all four H/ACA sRNP proteins [28-31].
The crystal structure of an archaeal H/ACA sRNP, showed
that the Cbf5 region found in our BLAST searches is physically distant and makes no direct contacts with L7Ae [28].
Part of the Cbf5 region from our BLAST searches, though,
interacts with the accessory protein Gar1, which has structural homology to domain II of EF-Tu, the bacterial translation elongation factor [28,32], suggesting that this
region within SBP2 may be required for eEFSec binding.
Additionally, part of the Cbf5 BLAST hit forms a 'thumb
loop' (Cbf5 β7-β10 loop) that has been proposed to stabilize substrate RNA [28]. From this, we speculatively propose a model in which this Cbf5-like region within SBP2
serves as a switch that regulates eEFSec/Sec-tRNASec interactions.
Mosquito SBP2: Science imitates Nature
Chapple and Guigó recently investigated evolutionary
relationships of insect selenoproteins and Sec incorporation factors [7]. In that work, a multiple sequence alignment of insect SBP2 showed that Aedes aegypti SBP2
contains an RNA binding domain but apparently lacks a
Sec incorporation domain. This is striking as SBP2 from
other insects, including the mosquitoes A. gambiae and
Culex quinquefasciatus, contain a Sec incorporation
domain [7]. We therefore performed a BLASTp search
with default parameters but limited to A. aegypti (taxid:
7159) using C. quinquefasciatus SBP2 as a query. This
search yielded the previously identified A. aegypti SBP2
RBD [7] and A. aegypti hypothetical protein
AaeL_AAEL008122 (Expect = 7e-85; hereafter A. aegypti
SID) which has 66% identity and 76% similarity to C.
quinquefasciatus SBP23-275, suggesting that the SID is
encoded by a separate gene in A. aegypti. A BLASTp search
against A. aegypti using the SID of rat SBP2 (aa 504-530)
as a query also identified the A. aegypti SID (Expect = 1e04). A multiple sequence alignment of representative
insect SID and RBD sequences is shown in Figure 9A. Phylogenetic inference of insect SBP2 using the WAG substi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/229

tution model in PhyML placed A. aegypti SBP2 with that of
other mosquitoes with strong bootstrap support (Figure
9B).
BLASTx analysis of 6.86 kb of genomic DNA [Refseq:
NW_001811341.1] upstream of the A. aegypti SBP2 RBD
coding region did not detect any sequences similar to
SBP2. Consulting the Entrez Gene database at NCBI [33]
for these genes showed that the A. aegypti SID and RBD
were found on chromosomes 1 and 3, respectively, further
suggesting that SBP2 in A. aegypti is comprised of two separately encoded proteins. Additional evidence that A.
aegypti SBP2 is split comes from examining its genomic
context relative to that of other insects. Specifically, D.
melanogaster and C. quinquefasciatus SBP2 are linked to the
locus for gustatory receptor 66a, which flanks the A.
aegypti SBP2 RBD (Figure 9C). Additionally, the SBP2
locus in C. quinquefasciatus is linked with a mitochondrial
inner membrane protein translocase and an ABC transporter, both of which are also linked with the locus for the
SBP2 SID in A. aegypti (see genomic diagram in Figure
9C). Thus the A. aegypti SBP2 SID and RBD were likely
separated by a translocation event. While the genomic
sequences and predicted peptides suggest the A. aegypti
SID and RBD are separate proteins, an EST search revealed
that 2 ESTs (Genbank: DV248278.1; DV248276.1) corresponding to the RBD also encode amino acids 178-275 of
the predicted SID peptide. It is also noteworthy that these
ESTs do not code for a methionine residue upstream of
the RBD suggesting that their 5' ends are incomplete and
that the complete mRNA could code for the entirety of
SBP2. This would be possible if the SID and RBD transcripts were joined by trans-splicing which has been previously reported in A. aegypti [34]. In the absence of an EST
set that covers the entirety of A. aegypti SBP2 it could still
be possible for the SID and RBD to function as separate
proteins as supported by recent work showing that combining recombinant rat SBP2 SID and RBD that have been
physically separated can promote wild-type levels of Sec
incorporation in vitro [2].

Conclusion
This report represents the first phylogenetic analysis of
SBPs across eukaryotic taxa. Since vertebrates possess two
SBPs, we annotated determinants that serve as identifying
motifs in SBP2L and SBP2. We showed that SBP2L is the
likely progenitor of mammalian SBP2 and as the only
form of SECIS binding protein in invertebrate deuterostomes, SBP2L is likely required for Sec incorporation in
these organisms. However, the role of SBP2L in vertebrates will require further experiments to elucidate its
function, and we expect forthcoming experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. Additionally the retention and loss of LSAD and PVFQ motifs in several taxa
suggest that SBPs are subject to diverse evolutionary pres-

sures. Conservation of the SID and RBD in unicellular
eukaryotes and metazoans suggests that SBP2 arose once
in eukaryotic evolution.
The origins of the SID and RBD, the essential domains for
SBP2 function, may provide insight into the mechanism
of Sec incorporation. The apparent phylogenetic relationship between the SBP L7Ae motif and RPL30 could provide insight into SBP2-ribosome interactions or reiterate a
possible role for RPL30 in Sec incorporation as suggested
by Chavatte [25]. The origin of the SID, however, is
unclear and its relation to other proteins may require
structural analysis. Analysis of insect SBP2, specifically
that of A. aegypti, showed that its SID and RBD are coded
by separate genes. Future use of A. aegypti cell culture
could provide a unique system in which to study Sec
incorporation. Based on the taxa sampled here, we propose that SECIS binding proteins arose once in eukaryotic
evolution and diverged substantially as in the case of P.
vivax, T. gondii, and D. discoideum. Additionally, the presence of SBP2L in some protostomes (C. sp. I and L. gigantia) but not in others (i.e. insects) suggests that SBP2L
sequences occurred in the last common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes followed by divergence in different lineages. Lastly, a gene duplication event, possibly
as the result of whole genome duplication, generated the
paralogous pair of SBP2 and SBP2L in vertebrates.

Methods
BLAST and Identification of SBP2 homologues
BLAST searches were carried out as described in the text.
Annotation of SBP2 from organisms with sequenced
genomes was performed in the manner outlined in Additional file 2. The presence of SBP2L or SBP2 was determined by BLAT (UCSC Genome browser [35,36]) or
BLAST (Joint Genome Institute organism-specific webservers and genomic DNA was used as input for ab initio
gene prediction using GenomeScan or the FGenesH webserver [8,9]. Predictions were refined based on EST data
from the organism of interest or related taxa when available.
Constructs
CT-SBP2 and CT-SBP2L constructs were created by TOPOTA cloning the coding regions for rat SBP2399-846 and
human SBP2L467-1101 into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). SBP2/
SBP2L chimeric constructs were made by introducing
silent mutations in the coding regions rat for SBP399-846
(CT-SBP2) and human SBP2L467-1101 (CT-SBP2L) in
pCR3.1 to create Age I restriction sites. These constructs
were then double digested with BstX I/Age I or Age I/Xho
I. The SBP2L-SBP2 chimera was generated by ligating the
555 bp SBP2L BstXI/AgeI product and the 838 bp SBP2
Age I/Xho I product into BstX I/Xho I digested pCR3.1.
The SBP2-SBP2L chimera was generated by ligating the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/229

576 bp SBP2 BstX I/Age I product and the 1.4 kb SBP2L
Age I/Xho I product in BstX I/Xho I digested pCR3.1. Substitutions in CT-SBP2L and SBP2L-SBP2 were generated
by site-directed mutagenesis. Sequences of all constructs
were verified by automated DNA sequencing.
In Vitro translation
Plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CT-SBP2, CTSBP2L, and chimeras in pCR3.1 were linearized with Xho
I and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using the
mMessage kit (Applied Biosystems). mRNAs were translated in nuclease treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate
(Promega) in the presence of [35S]-Met as directed by the
manufacturer. Protein quantitation was performed by
PhosphorImager analysis as previously described [13].
Sec incorporation assay
Sec incorporation assays were performed by adding 2
fmol (Figure 6B) or 2.4 fmol (Figure 6E) of in vitro translated protein, as described [2], to an in vitro translation
reaction containing 50 ng of a luciferase reporter bearing
a Cys258Sec mutation and a GPX4 SECIS element [22].
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
[32P]-labeled wild-type and mutant GPX4 SECIS elements
were transcribed as described by Caban [2007]. SECIS
binding of in vitro translated proteins was assayed by incubating 8 fmol with 20 fmol of wild-type or mutant
(ΔAUGA) SECIS probes in 1 × PBS supplemented with
250 μg/mL yeast tRNA (Sigma), 10 mM DTT, and 5 μg
soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Final reaction volumes
were 20 μL. EMSA reactions were incubated for 30 min at
37°, resolved on 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels,
and visualized by PhosphorImaging. Percent shifted
probe was determined with ImageQuant software by subtracting background from the RRL only lane and normalizing to CT-SBP2.
