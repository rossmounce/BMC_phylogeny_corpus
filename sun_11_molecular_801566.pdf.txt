Abstract
Background: Infections with the opisthorchid liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini, and O. felineus
cause severe health problems globally, particularly in Southeast Asia. Early identification of the infection is essential
to provide timely and appropriate chemotherapy to patients.
Results: In this study we evaluate a PCR-based molecular identification method, Multiplex Ligation-dependent
Probe Amplification (MLPA), which allows rapid and specific detection of single nucleotide acid differences
between Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini and O. felineus. Three probe pairs were derived from the Internally
Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) of three opisthorchid liver flukes using a systematic phylogenetic analysis. Specific loci
were detected in all three species, yielding three amplicons with 198,172 and 152 bp, respectively, while no cross
reactions were observed. A panel of 66 C. sinensis isolates was screened using MLPA. All species were positively
identified, and no inhibition was observed. The detection limit was 103 copies of the ITS gene for the three liver
flukes, or about 60 pg genomic DNA for Clonorchis sinensis. Amplification products can be detected by
electrophoresis on agarose gel or in a capillary sequencer. In addition, genomic DNA of Clonorchis sinensis in fecal
samples of infected rats was positively amplified by MLPA.
Conclusion: The flexibility and specificity make MLPA a potential tool for specific identification of infections by
opisthorchid liver flukes in endemic areas.

Background
Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis), Opisthorchis viverrini
(O. viverrini) and Opisthorchis felineus (O. felineus)
(Opisthorchiidae) are among the most frequent endemic
food-borne liver flukes, causing severe clonorchiasis and
opisthorchiasis. Humans contract the disease through
consumption of raw or inadequately cooked freshwater
fish containing the infective metacercariae. About 35
million people are infected with C. sinensis globally.
Main endemic areas are located in southern Asia including China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam [1]. In

China the estimated infection by C. sinensis is 15 million
[2,3]. Approximately 9 million people are infected with
O. viverrini in Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos [4-6]. In
eastern Europe 1.2 to 1.5 million patients are infected
with O. felineus [7]. In recent years, endemic areas of
liver flukes are expanding to North America and Europe
due to fish import and immigration [7-9].
Current clinical diagnosis of liver fluke infection is by
direct microscopy of eggs in feces. However, this procedure is time-consuming and inaccurate, resulting in
false-negatives due to the difficulty to distinguish eggs
from each other or from those of closely related heterophyides [10-12]. As a result, appropriate chemotherapy
may be delayed. Hence there is an urgent need for a
novel tool to diagnose the infection.

A number of methods have been developed to identify
or detect liver flukes using DNA, mRNA or protein.
Among PCR-based molecular methods, nested-PCR [13]
and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
[14] are particularly promising [15-19]. However, simple
PCR amplification carries the risk of false-negative data,
due to PCR inhibitors involved in complex samples
[20,21]. Moreover, mixed liver fluke infection may also
hamper the application of simple PCR [22]. As an alternative, multiplex PCR may achieve high efficiency with
simultaneous amplification of two or more genetic loci
in one reaction, while this also may reduce the number
of false-negative or false-positive results [23]. Although
multiplex PCR has been reported to discriminate
between C. sinensis and O. viverrini [24], it is technically
difficult to optimize PCRs for amplification of multiple
genes or loci, because each primer pair requires a different optimal combination of reagents and annealing temperatures. To overcome this problem we developed a
multiplex PCR amplification technique using multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).
MLPA is a simple, robust and fast method designed
for simultaneous detection of specific genomic
sequences targeting multiple mutations to amplify specific MLPA probes rather than target DNA [25]. In
MLPA (Figure 1), two oligonucleotides (up to 45 pairs
in one reaction) hybridize immediately on the target
DNA. In addition to a target-specific sequence, each of
the oligonucleotides contains one of two sequences
recognized by a universal PCR primer pair. After denaturing and hybridization, two parts of each MLPA probe
are ligated by a specific ligase enzyme, followed by PCR
amplification using a universal primer pair. Non-hybridized probes are not removed, enabling a high throughput ‘one-tube’ method. MLPA probes are designed in
such a way that each amplification product is identified
by size using separation by capillary electrophoresis. Differences in relative probe signals between samples
reflect differences in the probe target sequences.
MLPA is widely used to identify point mutations [26],
insertions [27], deletions [28], duplications [29], and
recombination events [30] and is also applied for quantification of mRNAs [31] and determination of methylation status of CpG islands [32].
The elegance and simplicity of MLPA makes it applicable to various types of clinical samples, such as blood
[33], amniotic fluid [34] or tumor tissue [35]. In pathogen detection, MLPA has only been applied to Mycobacterium tuberculosis [36], bacterial species in oral biofilms
[37], respiratory viruses [38] and Penicillium marneffei
[39], but not to parasites. In this study, we evaluate
MLPA for the rapid identification of the opisthorchid
liver flukes C. sinensis, O. viverrini and O. felineus, and

establish specificity of the method to discriminate these
three liver flukes in a single-tube reaction.

Results
In this study, the MLPA assay was adapted to identify C.
sinensis, and discriminate with other opisthorchid liver
flukes, O. viverrini, and O. felineus. We first performed
a haplotype analysis of the three liver flukes and of phylogenetically related species to search for unique loci for
MLPA probe design (Figure 2). Three specific loci were
selected for designing species-specific pairs of oligonucleotide probes for MLPA (Table 1). Web-based BLAST
analysis showed a low degree of similarity of the specific
probes compared with other parasites. Three artificial
templates of C. sinensis, O. viverrini and O. felineus

were used to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of
the MLPA assay. MLPA reactions without artificial templates were used as negative controls. Artificial templates of padlock probes were used to evaluate the
detection limits of the MLPA assay. These pairs of
probes allowed specific amplification of the ITS1 gene
of C. sinensis, O. felineus and O. viverrini, and yielded
three amplicon of sizes 198, 170, and 152 bp, respectively (Figure 3). The amplicons were 100% consistent
with the initial DNA used in each MLPA reaction. The
detection limit of the MLPA assay for artificial DNA
was found to be approximately 10 3 copies of the ITS
gene for the three liver flukes analyzed (Figure 4) or 60
picogram genomic DNA for C. sinensis (data not
shown) after the amplification products were visualized
by electrophoresis on a 5% agarose gel. A total of 66 different DNA samples of adult liver flukes were tested and
the data showed that the pairs of MLPA probes were
able to amplify all loci presented in the samples (Table
2). No inhibition was observed after the addition of the
same concentration of Opisthorchis viverrini or
Opisthorchis felineus artificial template DNA (Table 2).
The MLPA products could be successfully detected
using a capillary sequencer (Figure 5). Moreover, specific
amplification was also achieved by the use of fecal samples from infected rats (Table 3).

Discussion
The use of ligated oligonucleotide probes in MLPA, and
a number of other methods, allows specific detection of
changes in single nucleic acids of targeted genes [40-42].
These probes hybridize to and capture these areas,

which are then enriched through rolling circle amplification or by PCR. Using these probes we were able to
simultaneously detect gene loci and characterize different strains in a single reaction. In the present study we
evaluate the MLPA assay to identify and discriminate
three opisthorchid liver flukes. The sensitivity and specificity of MLPA highlights that the method is a useful
tool for prompt and accurate diagnosis, pathogen characterization, and epidemiological studies of parasite
infections.
In our initial test, we evaluated the MLPA assay to
identify and discriminate three liver flukes using artificial templates. All of the three probe pairs used allow
specific amplification of the ITS1 locus of each respective species. The MLPA reaction was sensitive enough
to detect 103 copies of artificial template DNA. This is
consistent with previous studies on MLPA in oral biofilm, where DNA was detected at picogram levels [37].
The size of the C. sinensis genome varies from 500 to
700 Mbp (Wang et al., unpublished data), and 1 pg of
DNA is equal to 978 Mbp of genomic DNA [43]. The
weight of C. sinensis DNA is approximately 0.511-0.716
pg and the 103 copies of C. sinensis DNA detectable by
MLPA is then roughly equivalent to 0.5-70 pg of genomic DNA. These results were consistent with the 60 pg
genomic DNA of C. sinensis mentioned above. Results
were comparable to a previous study indicating that the
sensitivity of MLPA is equivalent to real-time PCR [38],
while similar results were obtained in some studies
focusing on O. viverrini [24] and C. sinensis [18]. However, our results deviate from a previous report where
with simple PCR a detection limit of 10 -12 ng was

obtained [17]. This might be explained by the use of
different target genes or by different copy numbers of
target genes in the genome.
Furthermore, the results of the inhibition test indicated that the MLPA assay was not inhibited by the presence of non-target DNA. These data demonstrate a
considerable potential for MLPA in future clinical applications, which normally involve complex DNA mixtures.
Although enhancement of sensitivity requires further
optimization to capture low copy numbers of template
DNA, the alternative strategy would be to increase the

efficiency of the MLPA reaction, or the employment of
more sensitive detection equipment. The first option
might be achieved by the addition of more efficient
amplification facilitators such as dimethyl sulfoxide [44],
dithiothreitol [45], betaine [46], bovine serum albumin
and single-stranded DNA binding T4 gene 32 protein
(gp32) [47]. For the later option, a real time detector

could be used to track the limited fluorescent-labeled
amplicons [38]. The results would be comparable with
those of capillary electrophoresis or of fragment analysis
of fluorescent-labeled amplicons. However, the electrophoresis maybe the optimized method to detect MLPA
products for unequipped laboratory or lab of local hospital [25,48].

Conclusion
In the current study the MLPA assay was adapted to
identify and discriminate three liver flukes in a ‘onetube’ reaction, which was proven to be a sensitive and
specific tool with high efficiency. Multiplex amplification
makes this assay useful for high through-put analysis of
pathogens in large clinical or ecological samples [48].
The flexible arms of the probes allow for minimal inflorescent labeling. The advantages of this method have a
potential for wider application, e.g. to the detection of
other parasites or to diagnostics of mixed infections in
severely ill patients.
Material and Methods
Ethical Standards

All animals were handled in strict accordance with good
animal practice as defined by the relevant national and/
or local animal welfare bodies. Procedures involving vertebrate animals were reviewed and approved by Sun
Yat-Sen University’s Animal Care and Use Committee.
Parasite sampling and genomic DNA extraction

Sixty-six C. sinensis individuals were collected from
infected cats or dogs, the most common reservoir hosts, in
9 provinces in China mainland (Table 4). Genomic DNA
from adult worms was extracted using a commercial DNA
extraction kit (Dong sheng Biocompany, Guangdong,
China) according to manual instruction. Briefly as: single
adult was ground in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 200 μl of extraction buffer I, after shortly homogenizing, proteinase K(New England Biolabs, U.K.) and
RNase A(New England Biolabs, U.K.) were added to final
concentrations of 100 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml, respectively,
and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Following this, 200 μl Buffer
II was added to the mixture, and incubated for 10 min at
65°C. Then, 200 μl ethanol was added to the mixture.
Totally mixture was moved into the spin column after
tightly vortex, after spin for 1 min at 8000 rpm, extra protein was removed using Buffer III, and then the column
was washed twice with 70% ethanol, followed by centrifuge
at 12000 rpm for 2 min to remove extra ethanol, DNA was
recovery using 50 μl buffer EB. RNAse (5 μl each, 10 mg/
ml in pH7.4 NaAC) treatment was performed at 37°C for
30 min. The DNA quantification was done at 260 nm in a
UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).

with 1 ml of 10% formalin and 20 μl of suspension was
used for microscopy detection.
DNA was extracted from fecal samples as described
previously[50]. Briefly, 800 mg feces were washed twice
with 1 ml PBS. After centrifugation, the pellet was
resuspended into 200 μl of 2% polyvinylpolypyrolidone
(PVPP, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and heated for 10 min at
100°C. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-proteinase K treatment (2 h at 55°C), DNA was isolated using QIAamp
Tissue Kit spin columns (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany),
and eluted using 100 μl of elution buffer.
The quality of the DNA of C.sinensis was confirmed
by successful PCR amplification with universal fungal
primers ITS1F and ITS1R [51]. The first run of PCR to
detect fungal DNA was performed as follows: an initial
95°C for 5 min and then 25 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 62°
C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C
for 7 min. Then one microliter amplicons of first run
was used as the PCR template for the second run under
the same reaction program. Amplicons were analyzed by
electrophoresis (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) on 2% agarose
gels (NuSieve, Rockland, ME).

(Bio-Rad, California, U.S.A.) on 2% agarose gel (NuSieve,
Rockland, ME U.S.A.), then amplicons were sequenced
with primer ITS1Fand ITS1R by Invitrogen company
(Invitrogen, Shanghai, China). Sequences were edited
using SEQMAN in the Lasergene software (DNASTAR,
Wisconsin, U.S.A.) and submitted to GenBank.
Sequences of ITS1 of O. viverrini, O.felineus and other
references strains closely to liver flukes in phylogenetic
were down load from GenBank. All sequences aligned
with Bionumerics version 4.61 (Applied Maths, Kortrijk,
Belgium). Single-nucleotide polymorphism of ITS1 gene
were analyzed by DNaSP4 software (Universitat de Barcelona; Software for Population Genetics and Molecular
Evolution analyse; 4.20.0002).
Probe design

DNA sequences of C.sinensis, O. viverrini, O.felineus
and reference strains were aligned automatically and
adjusted manually in BioNumerics v. 4.61 (Applied
Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) to identify informative nucleotide polymorphisms. The design of the MLPA probes
was performed as described [25]. Three pairs of completely synthetic MLPA probes targeting the ITS region
were designed with an annealing temperature >65°C
according to the RAW program (http://www.mlpa.com/
WebForms/WebFormMain.aspx ) and no secondary
structures according to the mFOLD server (http://www.
bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold). For probe sequences
were listed in Table 2. Specificity of the probes was
confirmed by BLAST analysis in GenBank.
MLPA analysis

MLPA reactions were performed referring to the standard protocol on http://www.mlpa.com/WebForms/
WebFormMain.aspx?Tag=wl2zCji\rCGANQgZPuTixtCplCA1mmwJoFo/xHPnTgc| with some modifications. Briefly as: Routinely 500 pg of DNA from pure
culture was used. All the MLPA reagents come from
MRC-Holland (Amsterdam the Netherlands). The hybridization and ligation of probes were performed in Biosystems 2720 thermal cycler according to the standard
MLPA protocol. pF3 (Fam fluorescent labeled at 5’ end)
and pB3 were used as universal PCR primers in the
ligated probes amplification. PCR amplification was performed for 25 cycles (30 s 95°C, 30 s 55°C and 1 min
72°C) with a denature at 95°C for 5 min and a extension
step at 72°C for 7 min.
Specificity and validation of signal quantification

Genome DNA of 66 C.sinensis and 3 artificial template
of C.sinensis, O. viverrini and O.felineus were used as
templates to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of
the MLPA assay. MLPA reaction without C.sinensis
DNA or artificial templates were used as negative

controls. Artificial template of padlock probe was used
to evaluate the detection limit of the MLPA assay. Two
microlitres of each 10-fold serial diluted artificial template mixture and genome DNA of C.sinensis was used
as templates for MLPA reaction. Amplified products
were analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% agarose gels,
stained with ethidium bromide and photographed.
20bp DNA ladder was used as molecular weight
standard.
Results detection using capillary sequencer

One microliter of the products was dissolved in 9 μl of
deionized formamide, 0.2 nM Gene-Scan ® -ROX 500
size standards, and 0.5 μl loading dye (all from Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and denatured for
five minutes at 95°C. The products were electrophoresed
on an ABI Prism ® 3730XL Genetic Analyzer model
capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) in the GeneScan mode. Analysis of the products was performed
using Gene-Scan 3.7 and Genotyper ® 3.7 software
(Applied Biosystems) consecutively.
Evaluation of MLPA in fecal samples of infected rats

Crude-extracted DNA of 2 μl each from 48 fecal samples was used as a template for MLPA assays. The
amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis.
