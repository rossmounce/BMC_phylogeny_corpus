Cloning and biochemical characterization of a
novel lipolytic gene from activated sludge
metagenome, and its gene product
Li JunGang1†, Zhang KeGui2†, Han WenJun1*

Abstract
In this study, a putative esterase, designated EstMY, was isolated from an activated sludge metagenomic library.
The lipolytic gene was subcloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using the pET expression system. The
gene estMY contained a 1,083 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 360 amino acids with a
molecular mass of 38 kDa. Sequence analysis indicated that it showed 71% and 52% amino acid identity to esterase/lipase from marine metagenome (ACL67845) and Burkholderia ubonensis Bu (ZP_02382719), respectively; and
several conserved regions were identified, including the putative active site, GDSAG, a catalytic triad (Ser203,
Asp301, and His327) and a HGGG conserved motif (starting from His133). The EstMY was determined to hydrolyse
p-nitrophenyl (NP) esters of fatty acids with short chain lengths (≤C8). This EstMY exhibited the highest activity at
35°C and pH 8.5 respectively, by hydrolysis of p-NP caprylate. It also exhibited the same level of activity over wide
temperature and pH spectra and in the presence of metal ions or detergents. The high level of stability of esterase
EstMY with unique substrate specificities makes it highly valuable for downstream biotechnological applications.
Introduction
Lipolytic enzymes are ubiquitous a/b hydrolyzing enzymes
existing in animals, plants, and microbes. The enzymes
contain esterases (EC3.1.1.1) and lipases (EC3.1.1.3) which
catalyze the hydrolysis and synthesis of fatty acid esters
including acylglycerides [1]. Due to some useful features
such as broad substrate specificity, stability in organic solvents and regio-/enantioselectivity, lipolytic enzymes of
microbial origin are widely used in industrial biotechnology, such as production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and fine chemicals synthesis [2-4].
Modern biotechnology has a steadily increasing
demand for novel biocatalysts, thereby prompting the
development of new experimental approaches to find
and identify novel biocatalyst-encoding genes. Based on
the direct cloning of the metagenome [5] for the construction of large clone libraries, metagenomics allows
access to new sequences, genes, complete pathways and
their products by multiple screening possibilities. With

the advent of the metagenome approach, the so far
uncultured microorganisms (estimated to more than
99%) [6-10] are now more readily accessible, resulting in
an exponential increase in the number of potential biocatalysts. Indeed, the metagenomic approach was useful
in mining novel lipolytic enzymes from environmental
samples, and also, several genes encoding esterases have
been isolated in metagenomic libraries prepared from
highly diverse bacterial communities, including marine
sediment [11-13], soils [8,10,14,15], drinking water biofilm [10], pond and lake water [16,17], and tidal flat
sediment [18]. Some of these enzymes display enhanced
characteristics, therefore, searching for novel lipolytic
enzymes still attracts considerable attention.
Pre-studies based on 16S rDNA library have extensively expanded our knowledge of microbial diversity in
activated sludge from sewage treat plant, including
members of varied un-culturable groups (unpublished
data). Here, we report the cloning, sequence analysis,
and biochemical enzymatic characterization of a novel
esterase, EstMY, from an activated sludge derived metagenomic library. Our report demonstrates that metagenomics is a powerful approach in mining new industrial

enzymes. The esterase EstMY constituted a new member of family IV of bacterial lipolytic enzymes.

Materials and methods
Sampling

Activated sludge was collected from a sewage treatment
plant treating nitrogen-containing aromatic wastewater
on September 2008 in Mianyang City, SiChuan
Province.
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture

The starting strains and plasmids used in this study are
listed in Table 1. E. coli was grown at 37°C in LuriaBertani (LB) medium supplemented with appropriate
antibiotics [19]. When required, ampicillin was added at
a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, kanamycin at
25 μg/ml, and chloramphenicol, at 12.5 μg/ml.
DNA preparation and manipulation

E. coli cells were transformed by the calcium chloride
procedure [19]. Recombinant plasmid DNA was isolated
by the method of Birnboim and Doly [20]. For sequencing, this DNA was further purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation [19]. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA
ligase and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, USA) or
Takara (Tokyo, Japan) and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions. BugBuster Ni-NTA His. Bind
Purification Kit was purchased from Novagen (Code No.
NV70751-3, Novagen).

Construction of metagenomic DNA library and related
sublibrary

Activated sludge DNA extraction was carried out as previously described using SDS and proteinase K treatment
[21], and removing humic acids (HAs) prior to DNA
extraction was conducted by removing HAs buffer, 100
mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 10.0, 100 mmol/L Na4P2 O7 100
mM, Na2EDTA, 1.0% PVP, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton
X-100 [22]. Approximately 150 μg of metagenomic
DNA was run on a preparative pulsed-field gel (Bio-Rad
CHEF DR®III; 0.1-40 s switch time, 6 V/cm, 0.5× TBE
buffer, 120° included angle, 16 h) and the appropriate
size of DNA ranging from 30-45 kb was isolated, electroeluted and dialyzed against 0.5× TE buffer for further
Fosmid library construction. The purified DNA fragments were end-repaired by End-repaired enzyme mix.
After drop dialysis and concentration, the blunt-ended,
5’-phosphorylated DNA was ligated into the cloningready Copycontrol pCC1FOS vector, and the recombinant molecules were packaged into ྔ phage followed by
phage transfection to E. coli EPI300 by using protocols
described in MaxPlax™ Lambda packaging kit (Epicentre
Biotechnologies, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). A fosmid
clone showing strong lipolytic enzyme activity on a tributyrin agar plate was selected for further characterization and designated FosD11L2. The DNA was purified
from the selected clone, partially digested with Sau3AI
in order to obtain 3-5 kb DNA fragments, ligated to the
pUC18 vector and transformed into E. coli TOP10 cells
(Transgen). Transformants were selected on LB

(ampicillin, 100 μg/ml) plates containing 1% (v/v)
tributyrin as the indicator substrate [23].
Genetic characterization and sequence analysis

The lipolytic DNA fragment obtained from positive
clone E.coli TOP10-EstMY was sequenced with primer
walking method by SinoGenoMax Co. Ltd (Chinese
National Human Genome Center, Beijing). The ORFs
were analyzed using DNASTAR (Lynnon Biosoft) software and ORF finder online analysis http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/, Database searches for protein
sequences was performed using BLAST and FASTA
programs [24,25]. Peptide sequences of various enzymes
or subunits were extracted from National Center for
Biotechnology Information (Washington, D.C).
Phylogenetic analysis

Deduced amino acid sequences of 12 lipolytic enzymes
were subjected to protein phylogenetic analysis. A phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor joining
method of Saitou and Nei [26] with MEGA 4.0 software
[27]. A total of 6 sequences were aligned with the
CLUSTAL_W program [28] and visually examined with
BoxShade Server program. The length of each branch
pair represents the evolutionary distance between the
sequences.
Heterologous expression of gene estMY and purification
of recombinant EstMY

To express EstMY, the full length of the estMY gene
was amplified by PCR with a pair of primers estMY-f
and estMY-r (Table 2), in which the high fidelity
PrimeSTAR™HS DNA Polymerase (code: DR010SA,
Takara) was used. The integrity of the nucleotide
sequence of all newly constructed plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primer pairs with
restriction enzyme sites (underlined) for HindIII and
NdeI were designed to generate an N-terminal His-tag
of the recombinant esterase. The estMY gene was cloned

into an expression vector, pET28a (+) and the recombinant plasmid pestMY-His was transformed into E. coli
BL21 (DE3) cells. When the cell density at 600 nm
reached around 0.6, expression of recombinant EstMY
protein was initiated by addition of 0.6 mM isopropylthio-b-D-galactoside and continued cultivation for
additional 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
5,000 ×g for 5 min, washed twice with ice-cold 50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and resuspended in
the same buffer containing 10 mM imidazole, disrupted
by sonification in an ice-water bath (60 times, 5s).
Recombinant EstMY esterase was applied to metalchelating chromatography using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Novagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of enzyme in the
presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was carried
out by the method of Sambrook and Russell [19].
Characterization of recombinant EstMY and biochemical
properties

The purified EstMY was subjected to a series of biochemical analysis, including determing the pH optimum,
temperature optimum, substrate specificity, and effects
of various detergents and metal ions. All measurements
were carried out in triplicate. The values were the mean
of the data. The substrate specificity of the purified
EstMY protein was performed using the following substrates of p-NP-fatty acyl esters [23,29]: acetate (C2),
butyrate (C4), hexanoate (C6), caprylate (C8), decanonate (C10), laurate (C12), myristate (C14) and palmitate
(C16). The enzyme was incubated with the ester derivatives (0.5 mM) in 5 ml Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0)
at 30°C for 10 min. The reaction was quenched by
adding 5 ml trichloroacetic acid (0.5 mM) and then
recovered the original pH value with 5.15 ml NaOH
(0.5 mM). The enzymatic activity was measured by
monitoring the p-nitrophenoxide production by absorbance at 405 nm against an enzyme-free blank, which

was measured using a Ultraspec 3000 UV/vis spectrometer (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden) [30,31]. One
unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of
activity required to release 1 μmol p-NP per minute
under the above condition. The highest activities of
enzyme assay using the substrate (i. e. p-NP-caprylate)
was defined as the 100%. To determine the presence of
esterase activity, the triglyceride derivative 1,2-di-Olauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid 6’-methylresorufin
ester (DGGR) (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a chromogenic substrate, and the formation of methylresorufin
was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 580 nm [32-34].
Candida rugosa lipase (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a
positive control.
The optimum temperature of purified EstMY was
determined by assaying lipolytic enzyme activities in a
50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) for a temperature
range of 20-65°C, in which p-NP-caprylate (0.5 mM)
acted as substrate. Optimal pH was determined by
examining the activity of the enzyme after incubation at
35°C for 10 min using p-NP-caprylate (0.5 mM) as substrate. The buffers used were: 50 mM phosphate buffer
(pH 5.0-7.5), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0-10.5).
Various metal ions (CoCl 2 , CaCl 2 , ZnCl 2 , MgCl 2 ,
K2SO4, FeSO4, CuCl2, Ni(NO3)2, and FeCl3), and chelating agent EDTA at final concentrations of 5 mM were
added to the enzyme in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
whereafter it was assayed for esterase activity following
preincubation at 35°C. Effect of detergents or reductors
on esterase activity was determined by incubating the
enzyme for 30 min at 35°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), containing Triton X-100, Tween 20, Tween 80,
b-mercaptoethanol, 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC). The concentrations of
metal ions, EDTA, detergents, and surfactants used were
5 mM, 3 mM, and 0.5% (v/v), respectively. The activity
of the enzyme preparation in the absence of metal ions
and detergents before incubation was defined as the
100% level.
Nucleotide sequence accession number

The DNA sequence of EstMY from activated sludge was
deposited in GenBank under accession number of
HM366454.

Results and discussion
Construction and screening of a metagenomic library

One hundred micrograms of prokaryotic DNA was
extracted per gram of wet-weight activated sludge, and
1.5 μg of size-selected, pulsed field gel-purified highmolecular-weight (HMW) DNA suitable for fosmid
library construction was obtained. Three hundred

Page 4 of 9

nanograms of 30-45 kb purified metagenomic DNA was
ligated into the copy control pCC1FOS vector and then
tranfected into E. coli EPI300-T1R, producing a metagenome library of more than 7,0000 fosmids with insert
size ranging from 27 kb to 38 kb, with an average size
of 32 kb, covering approximately 2.1 Gbp of the total
metagenomic DNA. Given an average prokaryotic genome of approximately 5 Mbp, the metagenome library
theoretically reached the size of over 400 prokaryotic
genomes. The prokaryotic origin of the library was confirmed by end-sequencing of randomly selected fosmids
and comparison with known ORFs in NCBI. Expression
screening of the fosmid library for hydrolytic activity
based on the hydrolysis of emulsified tributyrin (1%)
resulted in the finding of a recombinant clone,
FosD11L2, forming a clear zone on the indicator plate.
In order to identify the hydrolytic gene within a fragment of 31 kb, the insert was subject to further
subcloning.
Subcloning and identification of the esterase gene

The DNA insert (31 kb) of fosmid D11L2 was partial
digested by Sau3AI and subcloned into prepared pUC18
vector, producing a subclone library of more than 3,000
clones with an average insert size of 3.5 kb. One hundred and fifty subclones were screened for lipolytic
activity. Among the 9 positive sub-clones forming a
clear zone on the indicator plates, one sub-clone that
expressed extracellular lipase/esterase activity was
sequenced from both ends and the sequences were
assembled into a contig of 2,680 bp. An ORF of 1,083
bp encoding a putative lipase/esterase (named EstMY)
of 360 amino acids was identified. A second ORF encoding a putative lipolytic enzyme, designated EstMY-092,
was identified as well as an additional putative ORF
encoding a conserved hypothetical protein (Figure 1).
Amino acid sequence alignment indicated that this
EstMY exhibited low identity with other esterase/lipases.
EstMY shared the highest (71%) sequence identity with
the ACL67845 esterase/lipase isolated from a marine
metagenome library, 65% sequence identity to Est25
screened from a soil metagenomic library [35], followed
by the putative lipase/esterase from other environmental
samples (50-65% identity), the putative alpha/beta
hydrolase from Burkholderia ubonensis Bu and Parvibaculum lavamentivorans DS-1 (ZP_02382719, 52% identity; and YP_001412150, 49% identity, respectively),
members of the family IV hydrolases.
Various lipases and esterases contain the conserved
active site motif of the pentapeptide GXSXG with a serine acting as the catalytic nucleophile, a conserved
aspartate or glutamate and a histidine, together constituting a catalytic triad [2], organized in the a/b hydrolase fold [36]. The amino acid sequence alignment to

Figure 1 Sequencing of subclones (FosD11L2) expressing lipolytic activity resulted in the assembly of a 2,609 bp contig. Three major
ORFs with conserved domains were identified: estMY, encoding a novel esterase EstMY; a putative conserved hypothetical protein, with
homology to a cytidylate kinase; and an ORF (EstMY09-2) encoding a putative lipolytic protein.

bacterial lipolytic enzymes retrieved from GenBank
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, identified the conserved
motifs, including the putative active site GDSAG (Figure 2). Thus, EstMY probably uses a catalytic triad consisting of the serine (Ser203) in the GDSAG active site,
the aspartate (Asp301) and the highly conserved histidine (His327) for catalysis. Moreover, EstMY contains a
HGGG conserved blocks (starting from His133), which
corresponds to a family IV characteristic motif (HGG),

which is in close proximity to the active site contributing to the formation of the oxyanion hole that is likely
to participate directly in the catalytic process [2,11,37].
Furthermore, to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of
the EstMY with other esterases or lipases, a neighbour
joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using the
amino acid sequence of the lipolytic enzymes. As shown
in Figure 3. In this tree, EstMY formed a distinct group
with the uncultured bacterium protein (AAX37295),

Moreover, the EstMY was not able to hydrolyse the triglyceride derivative 1, 2-di-O-lauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid 6’-methylresorufin ester (DGGR) (data not
shown), while DGGR was able to form chromogenic
product methylresorufin by the true lipase from

Expression and purification of recombinant EstMY

To investigate the property of this EstMY, estMY gene
was expressed as an N-terminal His-tag fusion protein
using pET-28a(+) expression system in E. coli BL21
(DE3). The recombinant protein was analyzed by SDSPAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining (Figure 4).
These results indicate that recombinant EstMY protein
is expressed (Mw, about 38 kDa), as which correlated
well to the predicted full length of EstMY. The purity of
the purified protein was more than 98% according to
SDS-PAGE analysis.
Substrate specificity of EstMY

We expressed EstMY as a hexahistidine-tagged (Histagged) protein and investigated its chain length substrate specificity using p-nitrophenyl esters (Sigma).
Results showed EstMY was able to hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl esters with acyl chains up to 14 carbons (p-nitrophenyl myristate), with the highest activity towards
short-chain fatty acids (C2, C4, C6 and C8), while much

showed no fluorescence on olive oil plates with rhodamine B, which indicated that EstMY is a true esterase
[29,32,38,39].
Effect of temperature and pH on EstMY

Esterase activity of EstMY was determined from 20°C to
65°C. The purified EstMY showed highest activity at
35°C. It showed a broader temperature spectrum and
retained over 37% activity at 65°C (Figure 6). However,
h1Lip1 from marine sediment metagenome showed a
bad thermostability because there was no activity left

the esterase showed activity in a rather broader pH
range of 7.0-10.0. Maximal activity was observed at pH
8.5 and lost activity at pH 10.5 (Figure 7).
Effect of metal ions on esterase

The effects of metal ions and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the EstMY esterase activity were
investigated by measuring the residual enzyme activity
in their presence and depicted in Table 3. Among metal
ions tested, the esterase activity was slightly increased
by Co2+ (126%), Ca2+ (104%) and K+ (103%). Furthermore, the esterase activity was inhibited by Ni2+, Zn2+,
and Mg2+, moreover, almost totally inhibited by Cu2+ ,
and Fe3+ (7% and 10% residual acitivity respectively),
while the chelating agent EDTA had no effect, suggesting this esterase is not a metalloenzyme.

Figure 6 Apparent temperature optimum of esterase EstMY.
Relative activity of p-NP-caprylate hydrolysis at different
temperatures by purified EstMY. The activity was determined at
different temperatures at pH 8.0 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer. The
activity at 35°C was set as 100% (3,936 U/ml). All measurements
were performed in triplicate.

Activity without metal ions was set as 100% (4,897 U/ml). All measurements
were repeated three times.

Effect of detergents and reductors on esterase

The effects of detergents and reductors on esterase
activity are shown in Table 4. A significant increase in
lipolytic activity was observed with addition of 3 mM
CTAB (130%), 0.5% Triton X-100 (129%), Tween 80
(138%), and Tween 20 (156%), after 0.5 h preincubation
with detergents at 35°C. Moreover, 3 mM b-mercaptoethanol and DTT did not affect the lipolytic activity
(101% and 106%, respectively), whereas DEPC and SDS
had a strong inhibitory effect on esterase activity. In
accordance to our results, Nawani et al. [40] also found
a total inactivation of activity in the presence of SDS
but an enhanced activity in the presence of Triton
X-100, Tween 80, and Tween 20. Interestingly, the
esterase EstMY activity was not impacted by 3 mM
PMSF, suggesting EstMY may possess a lid structure,
which could eliminate the inhibition effect of PMSF.
This is a special characteristic of carboxylesterases
[11,41,42] and site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid
Ser203 will be carried out to confirm the function of
Ser203.
In conclusion, we identified a new esterase EstMY
belonging to family IV lipases, whose encoding gene was
isolated from activated sludge of a sewage treatment
plant treating nitrogen-containing aromatic wastewater.
EstMY is expected to show high potential for downstream biotechnological applications including synthetic
organic chemistry. This was confirmed by its extensive
biochemical characterization, which revealed the
enzymes substrate specificity, wide pH and temperature
spectra, and also, stability towards addictives including
metal ions and detergents. Future work will establish
the structure of this enzyme to gain more information
about its catalytic mechanism. Our research also
demonstrated the potential of metagenome strategy in
bioprospecting novel genes and biocatalysts and
expanded our knowledge of biocatalyst diversity, especially for bacterial esterases. Enlargement of the lipases/
