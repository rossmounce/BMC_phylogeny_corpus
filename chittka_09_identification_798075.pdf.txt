Abstract
Background: During the development of the central nervous system (CNS), patterning processes
along the dorsoventral (DV) axis of the neural tube generate different neuronal subtypes. As
development progresses these neurons are arranged into functional units with varying
cytoarchitecture, such as laminae or nuclei for efficient relaying of information. Early in
development ventral and dorsal regions are similar in size and structure. Different proliferation
rates and cell migration patterns are likely to result in the formation of laminae or nuclei, eventually.
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that establish these different structural
arrangements are not well understood.
We undertook a differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) screen to identify genes
with distinct expression patterns between dorsal and ventral regions of the chick midbrain in order
to identify genes which regulate the sculpturing of such divergent neuronal organisation. We
focused on the DV axis of the early chick midbrain since mesencephalic alar plate and basal plate
develop into laminae and nuclei, respectively.
Results: We identified 53 differentially expressed bands in our initial screen. Twenty-six of these
could be assigned to specific genes and we could unambiguously show the differential expression
of five of the isolated cDNAs in vivo by in situ mRNA expression analysis. Additionally, we verified
differential levels of expression of a selected number of genes by using reverse transcriptase (RT)
PCR method with gene-specific primers.
One of these genes, QR1, has been previously cloned and we present here a detailed study of its
early developmental time course and pattern of expression providing some insights into its possible
function. Our phylogenetic analysis of QR1 shows that it is the chick orthologue of Sparc-like 1/
Hevin/Mast9 gene in mice, rats, dogs and humans, a protein involved in cell adhesion.
Conclusion: This study reveals some possible networks, which might be involved in directing the
difference in neuronal specification and cytoarchitecture observed in the brain.

Background
The precise neural networks of the adult brain are a consequence of early embryonic development, when nerve
cells acquire their unique identity, location and connections. Early in development the neural tube is regionalized along its anterior-posterior (AP) axis into forebrain,
midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord [1]. Shortly after, the
dorso-ventral (DV) axis is determined [2-6]. This morphological development is accompanied by the expression of
specific transcription factors, which dictate the overall
plan of the central nervous system (CNS). Within each
region a large diversity of neurons appears in a precise spatial and temporal pattern [3].
Brain regions not only differ in their neuronal subtypes, but
also in their cytoarchitectural structures – they can either
form laminae or nuclei. Such functional organization
within the brain requires that the newborn neurons not
only acquire the correct phenotype, but that they migrate to
the appropriate positions within the brain. Multiple factors
such as different types of neuronal migration, cell division
patterns and the identity of specific neurons, contribute to
the final cytoarchitectural organization of the CNS. For
example, radial migration of neurons prevails in the generation of laminae, whereas nuclei are formed as a result of
more tangential migration. Furthermore, differences in the
pattern of cell division have been suggested to influence the
formation of laminae and nuclei. An initial higher symmetric division of progenitor cells in the ventricular zone
results in a more lateral extension of the neuroepithelium,
a feature observed in many laminae forming brain regions
[7]. There is also increasing evidence that early events,
which specify neuronal identity, also influence the migratory patterns these neurons will follow. The proneural basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors Neurogenin
1 and 2 (Ngn1 and Ngn2) not only specify neuronal versus
glial fates, but also support neuronal migration [8-10].
Thus, the processes of neurogenesis and fate specification
may be intimately co-regulated with the subsequent migration and final connectivity from a very early stage of neuronal development.
Several genes have been implicated in forming the right
laminar structure in the mammalian cortex. One of the
best studied pathways of altered neuronal migration is
exemplified by the reelin and mdab genes, whose mutations affect neuronal migration and laminar architecture
of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum [11].
The superficial layers of the superior colliculus of the reelin-deficient mice show some defects; however, they are
not as pronounced as in the other areas of the brain [12].
Another complex of proteins that affects neuronal migration is the microtubule motor complex, which includes
dynein, dynactin, Lis1 and Nde1. Loss of function of these
proteins leads to defects in cortical lamination [13-16].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/29

Interestingly, mice which lack Lis1 gene also exhibit a
reduction in neuroblast proliferation [17] and mice lacking Nde1 are characterized by a small brain [18]. Taken
together, these results emphasize the importance of coordinated regulation of neuronal precursor proliferation,
fate specification and migration (for reviews see [19,20]).
The aim of this study was to identify known or novel candidate genes with potential roles in the regulation of differential cytoarchitecture and neuronal specificity
observed in the midbrain. The chick midbrain is one of
the brain regions, which gives rise to laminae and nuclei.
Dorsally, in the tectum, neurons are organized in layers
and receive and process visual and auditory information.
Ventrally, the tegmentum forms discrete nuclei including
the substantia nigra where the dopaminergic neurons
affected in Parkinson's disease are found. Early in development ventral and dorsal parts of the mesencephalon are
similar in size and structure. After embryonic day 3 of
chick development the dorsal half of the midbrain undergoes rapid cell proliferation to form an enlarged tectum.
This massive enlargement along the medio-lateral axis is
not observed in the ventral midbrain, where immigrating
cells from the rhombic lip contribute, for example, to the
isthmic nuclei in birds ([21] and references therein). Thus,
the midbrain provides an ideal model system to address
the question of molecular mechanisms orchestrating differential neuronal cytoarchitecture. We used a differential
display (DD) screen [22,23] to identify genes with different expression patterns between ventral and dorsal midbrain of the chick some of which might be involved in
regulating DV patterning of the mesencephalon.
Different methods have been designed to identify and sample the different sets of genes expressed by specific tissue or
cell types. Although the preferred current method for screens
is a microarray, we feel that there is less bias in the production of a representative library from the tissue directly rather
than relying on the microarray representation. Compared to
a microarray, it is a cheap method, which might identify
novel genes that haven't been annotated yet. In addition, at
the time this screen was initiated, chicken based microarray
systems were not available. Taken together a differential display is ideally suited for addressing developmental questions. We used chick embryos between stages HH 9–11 [24]
to isolate midbrains. Separate cDNA representation libraries
were prepared from dorsal and ventral parts of the midbrains
and compared. cDNA bands that showed differential representation were isolated to verify the expression patterns in
vivo by in situ RNA hybridisation analysis of whole mount
chick embryos at the appropriate stages of development and/
or with RT-PCR.
In our initial screen we identified 53 bands, which were
differentially represented between the dorsal and ventral

parts of the midbrain. Twenty-six of these bands could be
assigned to known genes and are listed in this work. Additional 8 bands could not be assigned to any known genes.
Their chromosomal locations within the genome are presented. To date we do not have sequence information
about the remaining 19 bands isolated in the screen. The
differential expression pattern for five of the genes was
verified by RT-PCR and by in situ mRNA hybridization to
validate the screen. We also present a detailed expression
study of one of the clones, M11d1, that was found to correspond to a previously identified gene, called QR1
[25,26].

Results and discussion
Differential Display of mRNAs from the dorsal and ventral
Parts of the Chick Midbrain
To identify genes with different spatial distribution
between dorsal and ventral chick midbrain, we chose to
use embryos from developmental stages HH 9–11 for our
screen. At these stages there is no obvious anatomical difference between the ventral and dorsal parts of the midbrain, although the anterior-posterior subdivisions of the
neural tube into the different parts of the brain are clearly
visible. A schematic drawing of our screening strategy is
presented in Fig. 1 and detailed in the materials and methods section. Here, we present the results of the 40 primer
combinations we used in the initial screen.

The overview of the different steps of the screen is shown
on figures 2A–D. Midbrains were excised as outlined in
Fig. 2A and cut into dorsal and ventral parts, which were
then processed for total RNA isolation. We performed
three independent dissections and collections of embryos
to isolate total mRNA, which was subsequently used for
three independent cDNA syntheses. We assessed the
integrity of the isolated RNA by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining the samples with ethidium bromide to
visualize the 28S and 18S RNA (Fig. 2B). The cDNA products were amplified using radioactive nucleotides and different primer combinations by PCR amplification and
separated on sequencing polyacrylamide gels. Representations from the ventral and dorsal cDNA were compared
and bands, which showed differential representation,
were excised from the gel (Fig. 2C displays an example of
such a band, M5v4). All sample synthesis and amplification were performed in triplicate and only those bands,
where all three PCR fragments from a particular primer
combination showed differential representation were
used for subsequent analysis. Bands isolated from
sequencing gels were further amplified with the same
primers that were used in the first round of amplification.
We identified 53 differentially represented bands in our
initial screen that were revealed by PCR analysis of the isolated cDNA. Of these, 19 were isolated from the ventral
part of the midbrain and 34 from the dorsal part. The PCR

products were separated on an agarose gel for further isolation and subcloning into a plasmid vector (Fig. 2D
shows examples of some re-amplified cDNA products
with different primer combinations and Fig. 2E shows the
inserts retrieved after subcloning the amplified products
into pBS plasmid). A schematic representation of the different functional subclasses of genes identified in the
screen is presented in Fig. 2F. Employing RNA in situ
hybridisation we not only validated a differential dorsoventral expression of the candidate genes, but also
detected the actual distribution of the mRNA transcripts
in the chick midbrain at the appropriate stage (HH10).
We used the original cDNA that was isolated and amplified from the acrylamide gels as templates for mRNA
detection in in situ analysis. Antisense and sense RNA of
the cDNA fragments were transcribed in vitro using T3 and
T7 RNA polymerases. Of the clones, which were analysed
in this manner we could unambiguously show that at
least four (M5v1, M5v4, M7v1, and M11d1) had differential dorso-ventral expression pattern in the midbrain at
HH10. The expression patterns of these four genes in the
midbrain of the chick embryo at HH10 are shown on Fig.

We also verified different dorso-ventral expression levels
by performing RT-PCR amplification with gene-specific
primers for a selected group of genes to further validate
the screening strategy (see Fig. 3E). The RT-PCR from
cDNA of ventral and dorsal midbrain confirmed the original differential expression of the clones found in the DDPCR. Clone M4d2 is strongly expressed in dorsal midbrain at HH10 and HH16, weakly in ventral midbrain at
HH10 but has disappeared ventrally at HH16. F1d1 is
present in ventral and dorsal midbrain at HH10 and
HH16 but has a stronger expression in dorsal midbrain.
F0d3 and F0d2 are only expressed in dorsal midbrain and
M5v6 is only present in ventral midbrain. A summary of
the gene identities obtained from this screen by comparing representational libraries from dorsal and ventral tissues is presented in table 1. Sequence information for the
DNA fragments with no homology to any of the known
genes is shown in table 2 along with the chromosomal
locations of the sequences.

3. M5v4 shows a clear dorso-ventral gradient with much
stronger expression in the ventral region of the neural
tube (Fig. 3A). M7v1 displays a dorso-ventral gradient
with a stronger dorsal expression in the neural tube (Fig.
3B). M11d1 shows a rather interesting pattern of expression with the highest concentration at the medio-lateral
part of the neural tube (Fig. 3C). M5v1 has a clear strong
expression in the ventral aspect of the midbrain (Fig. 3D).

Clone M11d1 – the chick QR1/Sparc-like 1
We next concentrated on the identification of the extensions of the original 3' clones in order to obtain the full
length coding sequences of these genes. To this end we
utilised a SMART-RACE kit from Clontech to amplify
extended cDNA products using the total RNA isolated
from HH10 chick midbrain. We were able to obtain the 5'
extension of M11d1 cDNA. BLAST search revealed this to
be a known gene, QR1, which was originally isolated from
the neural retina of quails [25,26]. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed that this gene is orthologous to the vertebrate SPARC-like1/Hevin/Mast9 gene and related to but
different from SPARC/osteonectin/BM40 (Fig. 4) [27-33].
QR1 encodes a protein, which is found in two forms,
either associated with the extracellular matrix or diffusible
in the medium [26]. The presence of QR1 protein in the
Müller retinal glial cells coincides with cell cycle arrest and
differentiation in these cells [25,26]. More recently, a
screen for genes specifically expressed in the gliogenic
ventral neuroepithelium of the chick at E6 identified QR1
expression in the medial spinal cord [34]. Its role in the
astroglial cell specification was postulated, but not further
investigated. An intriguing role for this family of proteins
in neuronal histogenesis is revealed by the role of Sparclike 1 protein in organizing the cortical layering. Sparclike 1 was shown to act as an anti-adhesive molecule that
is expressed by radial glia and dislodges the neurons from
radial glia after they have migrated to the appropriate
position in the cortex [35]. Our expression analysis of
QR1/Sparc-like 1 during early embryonic stages demonstrated that QR1 was first expressed in the anterior neural
tube up to the first somite, which coincides with the
rhombencephalon – spinal cord boundary at HH 8 to 12
(Fig 5A–C). At these stages no expression was detected in
the spinal cord. Coronal sections through the brain region

confirmed a diffuse expression in the brain and no expression in the spinal cord (Fig. 5E, F) at HH 8. At later stages
QR1 expression became more prominent in the ventral
and lateral neural tube (see HH 20, Fig. 5D, G, J, K) and
expression in lens tissue and in the medial part of the retina was observed (Fig. 4I). Coronal sections through the
spinal cord at stage HH20 showed QR1 expression in the
chorda (Fig. 5J, K) and around the ventricular zone of the
intermediate spinal cord (Fig. 5K). At the level of the hind

limbs (Fig. 5K) QR1 expression was also seen in more ventral parts of the spinal cord. No QR1 mRNA was detected
in the most posterior part of the spinal cord (Fig. 5L). This
expression pattern was still observed at embryonic day
four (see also [34]. Given that Sparc-like 1 regulates neural
migration in the murine cortex [35] and might be
involved in the Mueller retinal glial cell differentiation in
the retina of the quail [26], our expression data support a
role of QR1/Sparc-like 1 in guiding migration and thus

Additional Genes identified in the Screen
The genes that were identified hitherto from our screen
are summarized in table 1 and a representation of the different functional subclasses is shown in Fig. 2F. Some of
the genes have been shown to have predominantly dorsal
or ventral distribution within the neural tube. For example, clone M5v1 encodes an estrogen receptor α, and has
been detected in ventral neurons of the rodent midbrain
[36] and shown to regulate the serotonergic system of
rodents and primates ([36] and references therein). The
fact that we isolated this transcript from the ventral part of
the midbrain validates our screening strategy. The functional implications of this early expression of estrogen
receptor α remain to be investigated in future work.

Another interesting cDNA isolated with two different sets
of primers used in the screen, M5v4 and M12v3, encodes
a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 5
(MEKKK 5/MAP4K5). This group of serine/threonine
kinases are widely implicated in intracellular signalling.
Interestingly, MEKKK 5 contains an additional functional
domain, referred to as the citron domain. Another kinase

with citron domain, the myotonic dystrophy kinaserelated Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK alpha), has been
shown to regulate neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells
through binding to the small GTPases cdc42 and Rac [37].
A related kinase, germinal center kinase-related enzyme
(GCKR), has recently been shown to act as a positive regulator of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling in B-lymphocytes. The pathway requires Rac and
leads to JNK activation [38]. Furthermore, a recent report
has implicated non-canonical Wnt5a signalling and
downstream activation of JNK and ROCK kinases in the
guidance of facial branchiomotor neuron migration during mammalian development [39]. The non-canonical
Wnt pathway also known as the planar cell polarity (PCP)
pathway identified in Drosophila is a conserved mechanism that polarizes cells along specific axes in a tissue.
PCP regulates many developmental processes including
convergent extension during gastrulation, neural tube closure, hair orientation in mammals and other processes
(for review see [40,41]). The most prominent role of PCP
is to regulate the dynamics of polarized cells and to impart
directional motility to the cells ultimately contributing to
tissue morphogenesis [40,41]. It will be interesting to
address a possible role of the MEKKK 5 clone in the regulation of neuronal specification and/or migration during

the development of the midbrain by modulating noncanonical Wnt signalling.
A potentially intriguing clone derived from our screen is
M4d2, which corresponds to a Naked cuticle homologue
1 (Nkd1) gene. Nkd1 encodes a protein with a single EF
hand (a calcium-binding motif) that is most similar to the
Recoverin family of myristoyl switch proteins. It was proposed to link ion fluxes to the regulation of the potency,
duration or distribution of Wnt signals [42]. Nkd 1 is one
of the antagonists of Wnt signalling in vertebrates [43]. In
Drosophila, Nkd 1 has been shown to target dishevelled
and thus, to antagonize the canonical Wnt signalling as
well as the non-canonical PCP pathway [44]. Wnt genes
are widely expressed both in the dorsal and ventral midbrain [45-47]. Thus, the role of Nkd1 as a putative antagonist of Wnt signalling might be of great interest for the
development of neurons in the dorsal midbrain.
Clone M5v6 encodes a transmembrane domain protein
with homology to nidogen and a plexin repeat, called
Plxdc2/TEM7R. Recently, its expression was analysed in
the developing mouse embryo and was found in many

patterning centres of the brain at early stages, e.g., in the
cortical hem, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, and the
midbrain floor plate [48]. Interestingly, the authors show
a striking overlap of Plxdc2 expression with Wnt3a, Wnt5a
and Wnt8b expression in certain areas [48]. In an intriguing study a ligand for Plxdc2/TEM7R was identified to be
cortactin [49]. Cortactin is a substrate of Src kinase and Factin-binding protein. It has been implicated in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity [50], in IgCAM-triggered actin assembly, which is
involved in growth cone motility and guidance [51] and
in mediating morphogenic cell movements during
zebrafish (Danio rerio) gastrulation as well as in the development of the CNS [52]. Consequently, Plxdc2/TEM7R is
of great interest as a potential regulator of cell migration
during development and might have possible implications for the final location of different midbrain neurons.
Another class of molecules, which can modulate signalling pathways, are the heparan sulphate proteoglycans
(HSPGs). These are found at the cell surface and can be
modified by the addition of sulphate groups at specific
sugar residues along the heparin sulphate (HS) chain. The

addition or removal of sulphate groups creates a structural
heterogeneity within the HSPGs, which can influence
their ability to bind different proteins, notably growth factors and their receptors. In our screen, we identified Sulf1
that was encoded by clone M13v1a and is an extracellular
HS 6-O-endosulfatase enzyme, which is a major regulator
of HS 6-O-desulfation [53]. In Xenopus embryos, Xtsulf1
was shown to play an important role in modulating cell
signalling during development by enhancing the axisinducing activity of Wnt11 and restricting BMP and FGF
signalling [54]. Sulf1 has also been shown to modulate
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) activity during oligodendrocyte
differentiation in the spinal cord at a later stage of chick
development [55]. Sulf1 is expressed just prior to the oligodendrocyte precursor specification in the ventral spinal

cord and is likely to be responsible for the change in the
distribution of Shh at this time point [55].
It is intriguing that the clones, which were isolated in our
screen as putative positive regulators of Wnt signalling,
i.e., M5v4/M12v3/MEKKK5 and M13v1a/Sulf1 homologue were enriched in the ventral part of the midbrain.
This result raises the possibility that a differential regulation of Wnt activity in the chick midbrain might constitute
part of the mechanism responsible for the subsequent formation of different types of neurons and cytoarchitectural
arrangements found in the dorsal and ventral parts of this
brain structure. Importantly, the putative antagonist of
Wnt signalling, Nkd1 encoded by M4d2, was found in the
dorsal part of the chick midbrain. Other known inhibitors

Developmental expression profile of QR1 in the chick embryo
Figure 5
Developmental expression profile of QR1 in the chick embryo. (A-D) show RNA in situ hybridisation against QR1 of
whole embryos at different developmental stages. (E-L) are coronal sections except for (H), a horizontal section. The plane of
the sections is indicated in (A) and (D). (A) At HH 8 QR1 mRNA is detected in the entire brain region up to the boundary with
the spinal cord (arrowheads). Coronal sections through HH8 show a diffuse expression of QR1 in the lateral neural tube of the
brain (E) but no expression in the spinal cord (F). This expression pattern is also observed at HH 10 (B) and HH 12 (B). However, at stage 10 the expression is more intense medio-laterally (see fig. 3C). (D-I) At HH 20, QR1 mRNA is also present in spinal cord, lens and retina but no longer in the more anterior regions of the brain. A coronal section through the midbrain (G) at
HH 20 shows QR1 expression in the ventral part. An horizontal section through the hindbrain (H) reveals QR1 expression also
in ventral regions adjacent to the floor plate. Coronal sections through the spinal cord at HH stage 20 show a medial expression (J, K) and at hind limb level (K) an additional diffuse ventral expression. In the tail region of the spinal cord (L) QR1 expression is not detected. Scale bars are 50 μm.

of Wnt signalling, e.g., Dkk1 (ACW, unpublished observations) and several SFRPs [56-58] are expressed in the dorsal midbrain as well, strengthening the possibility that
differential Wnt signalling within the dorsal and ventral
midbrain parts accounts at least in part for differential
cytoarchitecture of this part of the brain. Recent work
implicating the non-canonical Wnt5a/PCP pathway and
the canonical Wnt pathway in the specification and regu-

lation of dopaminergic progenitors and in ventral midbrain morphogenesis further supports the idea that
differential Wnt regulation could account for differences
in cytoarchitectural organization observed in the midbrain [59-61].
Another aspect of the general regulation of morphogenetic patterning involves proteins found in the extracellu-

lar matrix (ECM). In our screen, we identified an
interesting candidate from this category of proteins, clone
F0d2/F0d1, encoding Tenascin-C, a gene that is known to
be involved in the regulation of cell migration. Tenascins
are a family of large multimeric proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM). These proteins promote weak cell adhesion and do not activate cell spreading [62].
Abnormalities have been found in the nervous system of
Tenascin-C defective mice ([62] and references therein).
ECM proteins are of paramount importance in the regulation of cellular migration during development. Cells with
different histories move together and influence each other
during migration resulting in specific cytodifferentiation
events. These induction events result in early embryonic
morphogenetic patterning. Thus, the interactions between
groups of cells and their collective movements are in part
responsible for the morphogenetic patterning during
development. The regulated expression of ECM proteins
can create specific microenvironments, within which
groups of cells can move and thus influence the morphogenetic events. Tenascin-C, also known as cytotactin has
been shown to have a dynamic and restricted pattern of
expression in the chick embryo and specifically within the
CNS [63]. This raises the possibility that Tenascin-C may
help to guide morphogenetic movements and subsequent
pattern formation by providing a temporally and spatially
regulated extracellular environment for interacting groups
of cells. Such regulation of cellular migration in groups
could then account for the different neuronal cytoarchitecture within the dorsal and ventral parts of the chick
midbrain.

coincide with the cell cycle arrest in the Mueller retinal
glial cells of the quail. QR1 has also been suggested to play
a role in the differentiation of the astroglia in the spinal
cord based on the timing and spatial distribution of its
expression in the spinal cord [26,34]. More recent work
implicated the mouse orthologue of QR1, Sparc-like 1
protein in restricting migration of cortical neurons [35].
We could show a very early onset of expression of QR1 in
the chick embryo in the midbrain at HH8–10. It is interesting to postulate a possible role for QR1 in regulating
some aspects of neural migration in the chick midbrain as
was demonstrated for Sparc-like 1 [35]. However, proof of
this will need a detailed analysis of its function in vivo.
Further work on the elucidation of the function of the
clones obtained from our screen should provide valuable
insight into the mechanisms that govern the organisation
of higher neural structures, which are necessary for the
correct processing of information by the animal.

Conclusion
Here, we present evidence for the differential expression
of several genes in the dorsal and ventral parts of the chick
midbrain, which expands our knowledge of the molecular
repertoire used during early development in the midbrain. The identified genes should also provide a useful
starting platform to address questions that concern regulating mechanisms involved in the sculpturing of the different neuronal cytoarchitectural arrangement in this part
of the brain.

Methods
The other genes identified in our screen are likely to be
important in the regulation of different processes, which
ultimately lead to the formation of a fully patterned midbrain in the developing chick. Both of the chromatin
modifiers we found, M1v1a that corresponds to MLL5 and
F0d4, which represents the SMARCA5 gene, are highly
interesting as the role of chromatin modifications in the
regulation of differentiation programmes of the developing organisms is just now beginning to be elucidated. It
will be exciting to investigate the involvement of these
genes in the regulation of patterning.
In this work we present the results of a screen performed
with the final goal of identifying genes that are not only
involved in the specification of neurons but also in establishing the different cytoarchitectural patterns found in
the dorsal and ventral midbrain of the chick. These two
regions show a distinctly different arrangement of neurons, that is a laminar organization in the dorsal/tectal
part and a nuclear organization in the ventral/tegmental
part. We identified several differentially expressed mRNAs
from midbrains of chicks at HH9–11. The expression of
one of the clones, QR1, has been previously shown to

Fertile hen's eggs were incubated at 37°C in a humidified
chamber to the required stage. The embryos were isolated
and staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton [24].
Midbrains were isolated and separated into dorsal and
ventral parts. These were used to prepare the cDNA libraries used in the screen.
RNA Isolation
Total RNA from ventral and dorsal parts of the midbrains
was prepared using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of RNA was
assessed on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and the 28S
and 18S rRNA were visualized using ethidium bromide.
The concentration of RNA was determined by densitometry and normalization to the known amounts of standards, which were loaded onto the gels in parallel with the
samples.
Differential Display Analysis
We employed a previously published method of DD-PCR
[22] using the primers previously described [23]. Briefly,
combinations of 11 different oligo-dT primers (A-M) and 20
different 5' random primers (0–19) were used for the cDNA

synthesis and DD-PCR (for primer sequences, see [23]. As it
was previously reported [23] and personally communicated
to us (Leimeister C and see [64]), that the primers M and F
give the most results, we present here our initial screen with
the combination of these two oligo-dT primers with the 20
5' random primers. Total RNA (300 ng) from ventral or dorsal midbrain was mixed with 2.5 μl of 20 μM oligo dT (3')
primer in a total volume of 13 μl. This mixture was then
heated to 75°C for 10 minutes and cooled on ice. The
remainder of the reverse transcription (RT) reaction containing 5 μl 5× synthesis buffer, 2.5 μl 0.1 MDTT, 2.5 μl 250 μM
dNTP-Mix, 1.5 μl H2O, and 50 U SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Gibco) were then added to the reactions containing ventral or dorsal RNA and the reactions were allowed to
proceed at 37°C for 70 minutes. The enzyme was then denatured at 95°C for 10 minutes prior to further processing of
the samples. The DD-PCR reactions were prepared as follows: 1 μl of the above cDNA already containing the
3'primer, 1 μl 10 × PCR buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH9.0,
500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton-X 100, 2 mg/ml
bovine serum albumin), 0.375 μl 100 μM dNTP, 0.625 μl 20
μM 5'random primer, 1 μCi α32P-dCTP, 0.5 U Taq DNA
polymerase (Gibco), and 0.025 U Pwo polymerase (AGS) in
a total volume of 10 μl. The reactions were overlaid with Paraffin oil and PCR carried out as follows: 60 second denaturation at 94°C, eight cycles of 45 second denaturation at
94°C, 60-second annealing at 41°C, and 120 second elongation at 72°C, followed by 15 cycles of 45 seconds at 94°C,
45 seconds at 60°C and 120 seconds at 72°C, completed by
a final elongation of 5 minutes at 72°C. Subsequently, the
PCR reactions were mixed with 4.5 μl denaturing sequencing
dye (10 mM NaOH, 95% formamide, 0.05% bromophenol
blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol) and 7 μl aliquots were separated
on standard 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea sequencing gels.
Gels were then dried and exposed to X-ray films overnight at
room temperature.
Re-amplification and Sequencing of PCR Products
Candidate bands for differentially expressed mRNAs were
excised from the dried gels. For re-amplification, we used
one third of the excised gel slice directly. The PCR mixture
(50 μl) contained 60 pmol of upstream and downstream
primers, 50 μM dNTP, and 5 U Taq polymerase. The
cycling was performed as follows: 2 minutes at 94°C initially and 30 cycles at 94°C for 45 seconds, 60°C for 60
seconds annealing, and 72°C for 120 seconds elongation
followed by a final extension for 5 minutes at 72°C.
Amplified products were prepared for restriction digestion
with Hind III (the site was incorporated into the primers
facilitating the subcloning) by purification of the amplified DNA bands from the agarose gels with the Qiagen
mini-columns. The bands were subcloned into pBS plasmid digested with Hind III and treated with calf alkaline
phosphatase. Subcloned fragments were then used for
making probes for in situ hybridisation and sequencing of
the inserts.

5' Race to obtain the Extension of the original PCR
Products
Race-SMART kit from Clontech was used to obtain extensions of original PCR clones isolated in the differential
display-PCR (DD-PCR) screen and followed according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences were compared to GeneBank and EMBL databases using the BLAST
program (GCG program package, Genetics Computer
Group Inc., Madison, WI).
mRNA In Situ Hybridisation
Differential expression of the candidate genes was verified
by performing whole mount mRNA in situ hybridisation
using the subcloned inserts at different stages of chick
development. Digoxygenin-labelled RNA probes were
synthesized from the cDNA clones with T3 and T7 RNA
polymerases and both were used for subsequent in situ
hybridisation analysis, whereby one copy represented
sense and the other – anti-sense orientation of the corresponding transcript. The hybridisations were performed
as described [65]. Embryos were photographed and subsequently embedded in gelatine-albumin mixture and
sectioned on a vibratome. Sections were then mounted
under coverslips using a mixture of PBS: Glycerol (1:10)
and the staining visualized under a light microscope.
Reverse Transcription and PCR amplification of identified
genes
Midbrains were collected from staged chick embryos, as
described above and total RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy kit according to manufacturer's instructions.
We used 300 ng of total RNA from a collection of HH10
and HH16 midbrains for reverse transcription. The RNA
was treated with RNase-free DNase to remove genomic
DNA. M-MLV reverse transcriptase was used to synthesise
the first strand of cDNA using random hexamers as primers. The cDNA template was then used directly in a PCR
reaction with gene-specific primers to detect the presence
of transcripts in dorsal and ventral parts of the midbrains.
The primers used were as follows: GAPDH fwd 5'-ACG
