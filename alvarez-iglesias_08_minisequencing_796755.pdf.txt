Abstract
Background: There are a number of well-known mutations responsible of common
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases. In order to overcome technical problems related to the
analysis of complete mtDNA genomes, a variety of different techniques have been proposed that
allow the screening of coding region pathogenic mutations.
Methods: We here propose a minisequencing assay for the analysis of mtDNA mutations. In a
single reaction, we interrogate a total of 25 pathogenic mutations distributed all around the whole
mtDNA genome in a sample of patients suspected for mtDNA disease.
Results: We have detected 11 causal homoplasmic mutations in patients suspected for Leber
disease, which were further confirmed by standard automatic sequencing. Mutations m.11778G>A
and m.14484T>C occur at higher frequency than expected by change in the Galician (northwest
Spain) patients carrying haplogroup J lineages (Fisher's Exact test, P-value < 0.01). The assay
performs well in mixture experiments of wild:mutant DNAs that emulate heteroplasmic conditions
in mtDNA diseases.
Conclusion: We here developed a minisequencing genotyping method for the screening of the
most common pathogenic mtDNA mutations which is simple, fast, and low-cost. The technique is
robust and reproducible and can easily be implemented in standard clinical laboratories.

Background
There are over 100 point mutations putatively associated
with human mtDNA diseases [1]; however, only a small
percentage of these mutations were properly confirmed
http://www.mitomap.org/rimtab2.html. In fact, the pathogenicity of some mutations is still under question due to
the fact that the conclusions claimed in a substantial
number of studies do not rest on solid grounds or are partially or completely flawed [2-5].

During this last two decades, many different techniques
were designed for the screening of mtDNA pathogenic
mutations, including restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, heteroduplex analysis (HDA),
single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP), etc
[6-11]. The main disadvantage of these classical screening
methods is that, due to the intrinsic nature of the techniques, many mutations usually pass unnoticed. Novel
and more efficient strategies have recently been proposed

that allow the screening of entire mtDNA genomes; for
instance, the mismatch-specific DNA endonuclease "Surveyor™ Nuclease" seems to be particularly useful when the
most common pathogenic mutations have been ruled out
previously (e.g. [12]). Ideally, the gold standard of
sequencing the whole genome would solve the problem;
nevertheless, this strategy is labor-intensive and therefore
unfeasible for routine molecular diagnosis (taking into
account the capacities of standard laboratories). Screening
methods are also difficult to standardize and some of
them are not suitable for replication assays due to their
dependence on for instance electrophoretic conditions.
Minisequencing techniques have demonstrated to be efficient in other fields of research, such as forensic and population genetics [13-18], but also in clinical research [19].
This approach, also known as single nucleotide primer
extension, allows the determination of the polymorphic
position by DNA polymerase addition of the ddNTP complementary to the base interrogated. The primer anneals
therefore to its target DNA immediately adjacent to the
SNP under scrutiny. Here we present a minisequencing
multiplex design which is a rapid, sensitive and low cost

assay for screening mtDNA pathogenic mutations in
patients suffering mtDNA disease.

Methods
Subject and SNP selection
Blood sample of 15 patients was sent to the Fundación
Pública Galega de Medicina Xenómica located in the Hospital Clínico of Santiago de Compostela (Galicia, Spain).
Six of these patients are from Galicia (northwest Spain;
[20]), and three other patients are from southeast Spain
(in the Mediterranean coast); the regional Spanish provenance of the other two patients is unknown. Four of these
patients presented clinical features of an undetermined
neuropathy, while the rest of the patients were analyzed
under suspicion of Leber disease. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was
approved by the institutional review board of the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain). All the samples
were genotyped for a set of 25 variants, 21 are confirmed
pathogenic mutations related to different mtDNA diseases
such as MELAS, LHON, Leigh Disease, and NARP. These
mutations are distributed all around the mtDNA molecule and 'hit' different mtDNA genes (Table 1). All the
selected mutations, with the only exception of

m.3243A>G, consist of non-synonymous substitutions
(both transitions and transversion, but note that the minisequencing technique could be also suitable for interrogating indels [17]).
Primer design
The primers both for PCR amplification (Table 2) and
minisequencing reaction (Table 3) were designed to have
an annealing temperature around 60°C using Primer3
software http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3. The
sequence databases at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
were interrogated using the online BLAST tool to test the
primers against possible repetitive sequences and
sequence homologies in the autosomal genome. Each
primer pair for PCR amplification and each single base
extension primer were selected independently and AutoDimer
http://www.cstl.nist.gov/biotech/strbase/Auto
DimerHomepage/AutoDimerProgramHomepage.htm
was used to test for potential hairpin structures and
primer-dimer problems.

Although the simultaneous occurrence of more than one
pathogenic mutation in a single individual is infrequent,
it could be possible that the presence of m.14484T>C
could interfere with the genotyping of m.14487T>G (due
to their physical proximity). Therefore, in order to avoid
potential artifacts due to deficient annealing, we have
designed a degenerate extension primer containing a mixture of nucleotide C and T at site 14484. The same rationale applies to variation at other two positions. According
to our design, m.14482C>G mutation could interfere
with the genotyping at position 14484; and the presence
of m.3946G>A could alter the genotyping of m.3949T>C;
we therefore designed another extension degenerate
primer containing C and G at site 14482 and another
additional extension degenerated primer carrying G and A
at site 3946 (Table 3).

PCR multiplex amplification
The SNPs were PCR amplified in 13 amplicons with sizes
ranging from 89 and 196 bp. The amplicons are deliberately designed to be small in order to facilitate the analysis
of samples that are highly degraded or with low quantity
of DNA. Some amplicons encompass several SNPs (Table
1). We performed multiplex reaction using 5 ng of DNA
template and PCR master mix of QIAGEN Kit Multiplex
PCR (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), amplification primers
and their final concentrations are in Table 2. Amplification was carried out in a 9700 Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). After a 95°C preincubation step for 15 minutes, PCR was performed in a
total of 30 cycles using the following conditions: 94°C
denaturation for 30 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 90
seconds and extension at 72°C during 90 seconds, followed by a 15 minutes of final extension at 72°C and 4°C
until removed from thermocycler. PCR products were
checked by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (T9, C5)
visualized by silver staining.
Minisequencing reaction
Previous to minisequening reaction, PCR products are
treated with ExoSAP-IT (Amershan Bioscences, Uppsala,
Sweden) to remove excess primers and un-incorporated
dNTPs: 3 µl of PCR product was incubated with 1.5 µl for
15 minutes at 37°C followed by 15 minutes at 80°C for
enzyme inactivation. Minisequencing reaction is performed using SNaPshot™ Kit (AB). We modified the
length of the primers (between 25 and 76 bp) by the addition of non-homologous tails, poly(dGACT) added at the
5'- end (Table 3). The minisequencing reaction was carried out in a total volume of 10 µl comprising 3 µl of the
SNaPshot™ Kit (AB), 1.5 µl PCR product, 1.5 µl of extension primers mix (final concentrations are between 0.1
and 0.6 µM) (Table 3), and water up to 10 µl. The reaction
was performed in a 9700 Thermocycler (AB) following the
recommendations of the manufacturer: 25 cycles of dena-

turation at 96°C for 10 seconds, annealing at 50°C for 5
seconds and extension at 60°C during 30 seconds. Unincorporated ddNTPs are eliminated with a treatment
with SAP (Amershan Bioscences). The final volume (10
µl) was treated with 1 µl of SAP for 60 minutes at 37°C
followed by 15 minutes at 80°C for enzyme inactivation.
The minisequencing products (1.5 µl) were mixed with 10
µl of HiDi™ formamide (AB) and 0.25 µl of GeneScan 120 LIZ (AB) and capillary electrophoresis was undertaken on an ABI PRISM 3130 ×l Genetic Analyzer (AB).
The data was analyzed using GeneMapper™ 3.7 Software
(AB).
Sequencing reaction
All the 13 amplicons were sequenced in an ABI PRISM
3130 ×l Genetic Analyzer (AB) for all the patients with the
aim of corroborating the mutations observed with the
minisequencing assay. Technical details regarding
sequencing reaction are given in [17].

Results
Only 13 amplicons are needed to interrogate the selected
25 variants. This is because (i) 'neighbouring' variants are
genotyped using different minisequencing probes annealing at the same amplicon, and (ii) different minisequencing probes were designed to genotype different
pathogenic substitutions occurring at the same mtDNA
site. Therefore, for each of the sites 7445, 9176, and
14482, there are two common mtDNA mutations

described in the literature as pathogenic, the most common one for each of these three sites was already confirmed (m.7445A>G, m.9176T>C, and m.14482C>G),
while the alternative one (m.7445A>C, m.9176T>G, and
m.14482C>A) still bears the status of 'provisional' in
MITOMAP. In addition, position 8993 has two already
confirmed variants, namely, T to C and T to G substitutions.
We did not observe mutations in four patients presenting
neurological symptoms. On the other hand, a pathogenic
mutation was found for each of the other 11 patients with
clinical suspicion of Leber disease (Table 4). All the mutations were confirmed by sequencing and were observed as
homoplasmic using both minisequencing and automatic
sequencing (Figure 1). Nine patients carried mutation
m.11778G>A whereas two patients carried m.14484T>C.
The two carriers of m.14484T>C lived in the same geographic (relatively isolated) village (namely, Burela) in
the northern cost of Galicia [20,21]. These samples were
submitted at different times to the laboratory and according to the carriers, their families were unrelated. Both
patients share also the transition m.12696T>C (observed
by sequencing), indicating that these individuals could
actually share some recent common ancestor. The
m.12696T>C transition is not a frequent variant in Europe
and likely constitutes a diagnostic variant of a minor HV1
sub-lineage (although this variant is also recurrent in at
least other eight non-European haplogroups, including

haplogroup J, see below): it appears in at least six haplogroup HV1 complete genomes (see for instance [22,23]).
Therefore, the m.14484T>C transition could represent a
founder pathogenic mutation responsible of Leber disease

in Galicia (as it is the case of a wide spectrum of different
non-mtDNA diseases [24,25].

detected by automatic sequencing (putatively unrelated to the disease outcome). Position 12705 is heteroplasmic C/T.

In order to further investigate this hypothesis, we additionally genotyped all the Galician samples for a set of
haplogroup diagnostic mtDNA SNPs following [16]
(Table 5). The two carriers of m.14484T>C but also two
other Galician samples carrying m.11778G>A could be
allocated to haplogroup J (and not to HV1 as it could be
inferred by the presence of m.12696T>C). Therefore, the
observation of the m.14484T>C mutation in two unrelated patients from the above mentioned small Galician
village could just reflect the already reported high incidence of Leber mutations within haplogroup J [26,27]. In
fact, we also observe that the frequency of haplogroup J in
healthy unrelated Galician individuals is ~14.7%
[20,21,28] but it occurs in four out of our six Galician

patients (~66.7%); the difference in prevalence is statistically significant (Fisher's Exact test, P-value < 0.006)
Other variants were also observed by sequencing analysis
in m.11778G>A carriers. For instance, the transition
A11812G is diagnostic of haplogroup T2 and G10172A
identifies haplogroup J2b; these variants also appear sporadically in other haplogroup backgrounds. In addition,
we observe a heteroplasmy at position 12705; transition
C12705T is a well-known diagnostic site that (together
with T16223C) leads from macro-haplogroup N to R.
Mixtures of two different DNA bearing different SNP profiles were carried out in order to simulate mtDNA heteroplasmy, a common state in mtDNA disease patients. As

shown in Figure 2, the minisequencing assay is perfectly
able to detect the mixtures at different proportions.
According to [29] "the single most important disadvantage of
the SNaPshot is that it seems less accurate than conventional
PCR-RFLP analysis for [detecting] high levels of mutant
mtDNA". Our results however indicate that the ability of
SNaPshot for detecting heteroplasmy is actually equivalent to standard sequencing. Some fluorocromes 'project'
more intensity in the electropherogram than other (as it
also occurs with some sequencing chemistries), and this
should be taking into account when quantifying the real
proportions of wild:mutant DNA (heteroplasmy).
Although our primer design take into account the proximity of two pathologic mutations, it is not possible to consider all the potential polymorphisms that could hit
within the annealing segments, and therefore alter the
PCR efficacy (and in the worst of the cases, produce an
artefact related to e.g. the spurious amplification of a
NUMT; see below). This is however an universal problem
affecting most of the genotyping techniques (including
RFLP and sequencing) and therefore, the expert should be
always alert under the possibility of false negative results.
The experience of previous SNaPshot designs [16,18,30]
indicates however that the method is robust under the
presence of polymorphisms.
Finally, the multiplex reaction was also tested in 102 control individuals. There were not false positives in this control sample and the SNP-minisequencing profiles were
phylogenetically concordant [31,32].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/26

later, some were recently questioned [2,33,34]. We here
selected a total of 25 mutations, 21 of them were confirmed as pathogenic in common mtDNA diseases in multiple independent studies and considering different
criteria, including the score system proposed by [33] (see
also [35]) and also the complementary phylogenetic
approach [2]. For instance, we included all the MTND
gene mutations evaluated with the complex I pathogenicity scoring system of [33] (see their Table 2) and reaching
the 16 top values (≥ 30). Apart from the 21 confirmed
mutations included in the design, the remaining four
mutations were additionally included because they occur
at lower frequencies at four of the initially 21 selected
positions.
Among the selected mutations, we have the transition
m.3243A>G which is a typical cause of MELAS [36] and
MIDD [37]; transition m.8993T>G, responsible of a
number of patients suffering NARP [38] and MILS [39];
transitions m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A, m.14484T>C,
which are common causal mutations in LHON patients
[40,41], etc. (see [42] for a review). It can be tentatively
said that the selected SNPs actually cover an ample spectra
of the fully confirmed causal mutations in the most common mtDNA diseases. For instance, according to [43], the
prevalence of m.3243A>G is about 1 in 6,135 in the general (European) population; see also [44]. It is also worth
to mention that it is straightforward to add mutations to
our initial multiplex design because SNaPshot minisequencing is very flexible in this regard [17].

Conclusion
Discussion
MtDNA mutations are responsible for various clinical features, which often make diagnosis a considerable challenge. Since the mitochondria constitute the energetic
'factory' of all nucleated cells, mtDNA diseases affect
many tissues with variable clinical outcomes. When
searching the Mitomap database for pathogenic mtDNA
mutations, many of them harbour the status of 'provisional', while some other stated as 'confirmed'; among the

Partial electropherograms showing the performance of the
SNaPshot assay with mixtures of wild:mutant DNAs. Numbers in the top indicate the percentages of wild:mutant mixture.

The minisequencing reaction presented here detected 11
mutations in an easy and straightforward manner in 11
different patients with clinical suspicion of Leber disease.
All the mutations and their homoplasmic status were
finally confirmed by automatic sequencing. We did not
observed false positives in a substantial number of controls. We also simulated heteroplasmic states by mixing
wild:mutant DNAs; the minisequencing technique demonstrates a good performance in detecting at least mixtures up to 1:10.
The multiplex reaction shows various advantages in the
clinical field with respect to other techniques (see [17] for
more details). For instance, the primers were designed in
order to obtain amplicons of size ranging 89–196, a feature of special interest in a clinical context where often the
laboratories have to deal with suboptimum samples containing low amounts of DNA or highly degraded DNA
(paraphine imbibed samples, biopsies, etc.) as it is also
the case with forensic samples [13]. Finally, we estimate
that the cost of genotyping 25 SNPs is at least 20 times
lower than the cost of RFLP genotyping (considering genotyping of one mutation at the time), and it can be done

in less than three hours (including post-PCR purification,
minisequencing reaction, purification of minisequencing
products, electrophoresis, and documentation) for as
many samples as the number of capillaries of the automatic sequencer.

Also important is the fact that minisequencing is robust
respect potential artefacts related to false positives at
NUMTs (author's unpublished data). Multiplex genotyping also prevents from artificial recombination; the later is
a kind of common artefact that more easily arise as more
independent fragments are genotyped for the same sample [31,32,45-49].

Finally, the screening method presented here should not
be considered as a substitute of complete genome
sequencing. The latter should be performed when the
minisequencing screening (or the use of other alternative
strategies) fails to identify the causal mutation.

Availability and requirements
There are over 100 point mutations putatively associated
with human mtDNA diseases [1]; however, only a small
percentage of these mutations were properly confirmed
http://www.mitomap.org/rimtab2.html. The primers
both for PCR amplification (Table 2) and minisequencing
reaction (Table 3) were designed to have an annealing
temperature around 60°C using Primer3 software http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3. The sequence databases at the National Centre for Biotechnology Informawere
tion
(NCBI;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
interrogated using the online BLAST tool to test the primers against possible repetitive sequences and sequence
homologies in the autosomal genome. Each primer pair
for PCR amplification and each single base extension
primer were selected independently and AutoDimer http/
www.cstl.nist.gov/biotech/strbase/AutoDimer
Homepage/AutoDimerProgramHomepage.htm was used
to test for potential hairpin structures and primer-dimer
problems.
