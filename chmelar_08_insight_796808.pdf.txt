Abstract
Background: In recent years, there have been several sialome projects revealing transcripts
expressed in the salivary glands of ticks, which are important vectors of several human diseases.
Here, we focused on the sialome of the European vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes ricinus.
Results: In the attempt to describe expressed genes and their dynamics throughout the feeding
period, we constructed cDNA libraries from four different feeding stages of Ixodes ricinus females:
unfed, 24 hours after attachment, four (partially fed) and seven days (fully engorged) after
attachment. Approximately 600 randomly selected clones from each cDNA library were
sequenced and analyzed. From a total 2304 sequenced clones, 1881 sequences forming 1274
clusters underwent subsequent functional analysis using customized bioinformatics software.
Clusters were sorted according to their predicted function and quantitative comparison among the
four libraries was made. We found several groups of over-expressed genes associated with feeding
that posses a secretion signal and may be involved in tick attachment, feeding or evading the host
immune system. Many transcripts clustered into families of related genes with stage-specific
expression. Comparison to Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus transcripts was made.
Conclusion: In addition to a large number of homologues of the known transcripts, we obtained
several novel predicted protein sequences. Our work contributes to the growing list of proteins
associated with tick feeding and sheds more light on the dynamics of the gene expression during
tick feeding. Additionally, our results corroborate previous evidence of gene duplication in the
evolution of ticks.

Background
Hard ticks (family Ixodidae) are well known ecto-parasites of vertebrates, with worldwide distribution and high
medical importance due to their extraordinary ability to
transmit various disease agents. Among hard ticks, the
genus Ixodes is one of the most important vectors of

human diseases. Lyme borreliosis, human granulocytic
anaplasmosis (ehrlichiosis) and babesiosis are the main
diseases transmitted by I. scapularis and I. pacificus in
North America. In addition to these diseases, Ixodes ricinus
in Europe and Ixodes persulcatus in Asia transmit tickborne encephalitis (TBE). An increase of TBE-virus (Flavi-

viridae) prevalence among I. ricinus ticks in middle
Europe has been recorded during the last few decades and
the findings of I. ricinus at higher altitudes (above 1000
m) suggest that it is spreading to new areas, which correlates with the spread of human TBE cases [1]. Ticks and
tick-borne diseases are becoming a more important health
issue and detailed knowledge of the interactions among
the tick, host and pathogen is crucial for understanding
the mechanisms of pathogen transmission. The knowledge of saliva components is the basis for further understanding of these interactions.
Tick saliva is a powerful mixture of hundreds of different
proteins and other pharmacologically active molecules.
The effects of tick saliva or SGE (salivary gland extract) on
the host are well described in several reviews [2-4]. Hard
ticks require an array of molecules to evade the host haemostatic and immune systems and for successful completion of feeding, which usually lasts for 7–9 days for I.
ricinus. Tick saliva is able to inhibit all three components
of the host haemostatic system: blood coagulation, platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction [3,5]. The innate
immune response is altered by the impaired activation of
complement, resulting in a decrease in chemokine production and subsequent inhibition of inflammation.
Acquired immunity is affected as well; in vitro experiments
showed the inhibition of T-cell proliferation after incubation with Ixodes ricinus saliva [6]. Salivary gland extract
alters the production of many cytokines by immunologically responsive cells leading to immunosuppression [7].
The changes in the expression profile of different
cytokines indicate a polarization from Th1 toward the Th2
branch of the immune response, which could be a disease-determining factor for tick-borne pathogens [8]. During the late eighties, it was discovered that tick saliva is
able to facilitate the transmission of viruses to the host
and to another co-feeding tick [9]. This phenomenon was
called saliva activated transmission (SAT) and has since
been revealed for additional pathogens such as Borrelia
spp. [10].

other proteins, tick saliva contains a metalloprotease with
fibrinolytic activity, involved in extracellular matrix
remodeling [23], a group of anti-complement proteins
[24,25] and an IL-2-binding protein [26]. Many of these
proteins were discovered using a high-throughput
approach [27] that opened a vast new area for tick
research and helped reveal a large number of novel proteins with completely unknown function, as well as many
homologous proteins. From this point of view, tick saliva
is a rich source of medical compounds. As an example, the
immunosuppressive tick salivary protein Salp 15 was
shown to suppress the development of experimental
asthma in mice [28] and, as an immunosuppressor, Salp
15 is believed to become useful during allogenic transplantation [29].
This work augments the existing knowledge of tick
sialomes. High-throughput studies of tick salivary glands
have been completed for several ticks, such as American
species I. scapularis, I. pacificus and Dermacentor andersoni
[30-33] or tropical tick Amblyomma variegatum [34]. This is
the first high-throughput work on the European tick Ixodes
ricinus, which is the most important disease vector in
Europe. In this study, four cDNA libraries from salivary
glands were constructed and 576 EST were sequenced and
analyzed per library, resulting in a total of 2304 EST. The
four libraries cover the main phases of an adult female tick
feeding period: 1) unfed tick, 2) early phase of feeding (24
hours after attachment), 3) middle phase of feeding (4
days after attachment) and 4) late phase of feedingengorged tick (7 days after attachment).
Although many proteins that we identified were already
known from I. scapularis and I. pacificus, several novel
putative proteins were discovered. Moreover, analysis of
mRNAs expressed at four points in the blood meal enables us to gain insight into the dynamics of tick feeding,
and indirectly sheds light on the evolution of tick genes
and genome composition.

Results
During the past decade, there has been great progress
toward the description of particular molecules responsible for the host immunomodulation. It was shown that
tick saliva contains various protease inhibitors with anticoagulant activity [11-13], as well as anti-inflammatory
and immunosuppressive activity [14,15]. Anti-inflammatory activity is a result of several pharmacologically active
molecules, including prostaglandins [16,17], apyrase [18]
and histamine-binding proteins belonging to the lipocalin family [19,20]. Additionally, immunosuppressive protein Salp15 was identified from Ixodes scapularis [21].
Moreover, Salp15 was identified as saliva activated transmission (SAT) factor that facilitates the establishment of
Borrelia burgdorferi in the mammalian host [22]. Among

Characterization of data
Four different salivary gland cDNA libraries from I. ricinus
females were analyzed in this work. The following feeding
stages were used for mRNA isolation: Unfed (IRUF), 24
hours after attachment (IR24H), four days (IR4D) and
seven days (IR7D) after attachment to the host. From the
total of 2304 sequenced EST, 1881 were considered of
high quality (less than 5% of undetermined base calls,
phred quality ≥ 20, at least 80 bases not including poly A).
The length of analyzed sequences (after removal of vector
sequence) ranged between 84 and 1253 bp with average
length of 503 bp. The sequences were clustered and
aligned resulting in 1274 clusters comprising 268 contigs
with two or more sequences and 1006 singletons. The

high proportion of singletons is due to stringent analysis
conditions rather than under-sampling; however, a larger
dataset would be beneficial for statistic analysis. BLAST
search was done for the consensus of each contig or singleton against the set of databases (NR, GO, KOG, CDD,
Pfam, Smart, ACARI, rRNA and mitochondrial). The bioinformatic analysis was combined into a single Excel table
where the clusters were manually annotated and sorted
into functionally related groups based on the BLAST
results from the various databases. Out of 1881 sequenced
EST, approximately 30% (550) were identified as housekeeping genes due to a functional prediction and/or intracellular localization, and 32% (583) of ESTs contained a
predicted signal for secretion from the cell suggesting their
function in saliva (group of secreted genes). Several ESTs
were 5' truncated, which restricted prediction by the SignalP server, yet had high similarity to secreted proteins on
GenBank and were grouped with secreted genes. Fortynine ESTs compiled in 37 clusters (3%) contained proteins that are conserved among different organisms but
lack any functional prediction and were named 'unknown
conserved'. The last largest group comprises 658
unknown transcripts (35%) without a predicted signal
peptide and with no match to any database. There are
three main reasons for such a high amount of unknowns
and all of them probably participate in the resulting
number: 1) Sequences contain only 5' untranslated
region, 2) Truncated cDNA was cloned into the vector and
only the part of 3' non-coding region was sequenced, and
3) Tick salivary glands contain many unknown and
unique proteins with no similarity throughout all organ-

isms. The group of unknowns was sorted for illustration
between two groups, in accordance with the length of the
open-reading frame; the threshold for the division was
decided at the length 100 bp. Putative proteins similar to
reverse transcriptases or transposases were classified as a
single group. Although the protocol for cDNA library construction is designed for elimination of other than messenger-type of RNA, several ribosomal RNAs were
sequenced, which is due to AT-rich profile of such transcripts. Main data characteristics are summarized and visualized in Figure 1.
Distribution of transcripts among libraries
All libraries contain a similar number of high-quality
sequences ranging from 432 for IR7D to 492 for IR4D.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the main groups among
all libraries. The distribution of different gene types varies
markedly. There is a large increase in the expression of
secreted proteins between IRUF and IR24H libraries,
while in IR4D and IR7D the ratio of secreted proteins
decreases. This trend results from the distribution of the
three most abundant families of secreted proteins: Collagen-Like Secreted Proteins (CLSP), Basic Tail Secreted Proteins (BTSP) and proteins containing Kunitz domains
(Kunitz). These three groups represent only 1.7% of all
transcripts in IRUF, but 37.6% in IR24H, 20.6% in IR4D
and 17.1% in IR7D library. We can assume that during the
early phase of feeding, the tick utilizes a large amount of
energy for the production of proteins that enable it to feed
successfully despite the host defense system. During the
first few days after attachment, it is mainly innate defense

that the tick has to fight against in a naïve host, and all
three groups mentioned above could be involved in antihaemostatic activity. During the later phases of feeding,
the tick starts to digest and process the ingested meal
while the site of attachment is already full of pharmacologically active molecules. The slight increase in production of housekeeping genes in the last two stages of
feeding is in accordance with the need for higher metabolic activity during rapid growth of the salivary glands.
However, at least two groups of secreted proteins appear
to be produced in later phases of feeding. Histaminebinding proteins (HBP) and 4.9 kDa proteins are significantly overrepresented in the IR7D library (Table 3). The
function of the 4.9 kDa group is completely unknown but
HBP are known for their anti-inflammatory activity.
Quite interestingly, 66.8% (323 out of 483 EST) of the
unknown proteins are present in the IRUF library. The reason could be the lack of data from unfed tick salivary
glands as only cDNA libraries from unfed Argas monolakensis and Amblyomma americanum were published to date
in the GenBank. The lack of a signal peptide in full-length
clones suggests housekeeping function of these peptides.
In order to identify proteins up-regulated by feeding, a
comparison of the four libraries was conducted. Only 38
contigs out of 1274 contain five or more ESTs, the threshold for statistical evaluation (Table 1); therefore, we conducted statistical analysis on both individual contigs and
whole classes of peptides. While housekeeping genes were
sorted into functional categories, classification of secreted
proteins was based on their primary structure similarity
because exact function is not usually known. The distribu-

tion and statistic evaluation of both housekeeping and
secreted proteins are shown in Table 2 (housekeeping)
and Table 3 (secreted). Accession numbers for the GenBank EST database in the following sections always represent the largest clone of each mentioned contig. All
additional sequences, assembled contigs and other data
from the analysis can be downloaded [see Additional file
1].
Housekeeping genes
The group of housekeeping genes was divided among
more detailed functional subgroups. The subgroups comprise a large number of diverse proteins with diverse intracellular functions (Table 2). As expected, proteins
involved in energetic and nutrient metabolism, such as
compounds of the respiratory chain, various ATPase subunits or enzymes participating in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids, are well represented
in the dataset, comprising 217 out of a total 1881 ESTs
(11.5%). Their expression increases during feeding, probably due to higher metabolic requirements during digestion of the blood meal (Table 2). For the sake of
simplification six proteins were compiled together in a
group labeled metabolism. The group (metabolism)
includes proteins with various metabolic roles. There are
two proteins involved in defense and detoxification. Two
ESTs coding for dopachrome-tautomerase, the key
enzyme in the process of melanization [35] were detected
in the IR4D library (Contig 259, EY199700). Another protein, possibly involved in detoxification, is a peptide similar to nicotinamide N-methyltransferase and is
represented by only one EST in IR7D library (Contig 946,

EY200443). This enzyme is engaged in N-methylation of
nicotinamide and other pyridines to form pyridinium
ions. Its activity is important for biotransformation of
many drugs and xenobiotic compounds in humans and
other mammals. Its function in ticks or other arthropods
is not clear; moreover, there is no previous report of a
nicotinamid N-methyltransferase in any arthropod spe-

cies. Although the cDNA is truncated, the e-value (2.10-5)
is convincing and BLASTp search detected a methyltransferase domain; thus we can assume that the 33% identity
and 57% similarity between contig 946 and human nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NP_006160) strongly suggest the homology between tick and human proteins.

P values show significance of expression difference between two libraries; P – ALL shows which contig has random and non-random distribution. Significant values are (P ≤
0.05) are marked in bold. Obs – observed, Exp – expected.

in this group are those involved in coenzyme transport
and metabolism or synthesis of secondary metabolites
(Contig 323, EY200796; 543, EY199519; 815, EY200185;
and 825, EY200205).
The group of proteins involved in post-translational modification and protein degradation contains various heatshock proteins, proteases, subunits of proteasome
machinery and glycosyltransferases, among others. Proteosynthetic proteins involved in translation, including
ribosomal proteins, represent 10.3% of the total ESTs (n =
193 EST). There is a significant decrease in expression of
ribosomal proteins between IR4D and IR7D. This suggests
that there is a decrease in the production of salivary proteins during the final phase before detachment, which is
supported by the putative expression profile of secreted
proteins (Figure 2).
The group of cytoskeletal proteins is represented by actin,
actin-related proteins, myosin, dynein, alpha tubulin, collagen precursor and a protein similar to microtubulebinding protein called translationally-controlled tumor
protein (TCTP). TCTP functions in chromosome partitioning during the cell division [36], but it also stimulates
the release of histamine by basophils [37]. Homologues
of TCTP were found in other ixodid ticks and are referred
to as histamine release factors (HRF). One of them was
detected in the saliva of Dermacentor variabilis, despite the
lack of a putative signal peptide. In the same work recombinant tick TCTP/HRF proved its histamine releasing features [38]. The I. ricinus TCTP/HRF transcript is truncated
at the 5' region, but its high homology with I. scapularis (e-

value = 7e-86), which lacks a signal peptide, suggests that
the signal peptide is not present in I. ricinus TCTP/HRF as
well. TCTP/HRF seems to be expressed constitutively and
independently during feeding [39]. In light of the fact that
the only transcript found in our library originates from
unfed ticks (Contig 999, EY200552) and that TCTP/HRF
proteins are well conserved among different organisms,
we can assume that the main function of tick TCTP/HRF
homologue is a function of tick physiology although the
presence of TCTP/HRF in D. variabilis saliva suggests some
function in the host.
Proteins associated with the transport and metabolism of
ions create a single group with four singletons. The group
contains manganese superoxide dismutase (Contig 660,
EY199845), CutA1 divalent ion tolerance protein homologue (Contig 744, EY200030), ferritin (Contig 590,
EY199666) and protein similar to Rhodanese-related sulfur transferase (Contig 1131, EY200876). Superoxide dismutase catalyses the dismutation of superoxide into
oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and functions as an
important defense against superoxide radicals [40]. CutA1
divalent ion tolerance protein is found throughout all
organisms and is involved in tolerance to divalent ions
such as copper or iron ions. This is the first reported
CutA1 from the ticks, where it may be important in tolerance to iron ions from the blood meal. Another protein
connected to iron transport and deposition is ferritin,
which is expressed in all tick tissues [41]. Ferritin is a
cytosolic protein usually composed of 24 subunits and is
involved in the storage of ferric ions. It was shown that
Ornithodoros moubata ferritin is expressed constitutively

and independently upon feeding in the midgut [42]. Ixodes ricinus salivary ferritin is represented by only one EST
in IR4D library (Contig 590). Proteins involved in signal
transduction and intracellular trafficking create two functionally related groups where proteins associated with G
proteins, receptors, ion channels associated proteins and
various transporters, among others, can be found. Contigs
294 (EY200035), 295 (EY200423), 299 (EY200084) and
802 (EY200163) were found in a group of cell cycle proteins and are most likely involved in the cell division
cycle, however concrete functions remain unknown.

Putative secreted genes
The group of secreted genes includes many of the transcripts with predicted signal peptide and truncated transcripts with high similarity to secreted proteins from other
tick species. Secreted proteins (both predicted and determined by BLAST) represent 32% of all ESTs. From the distribution among the libraries, it is obvious that the
number of secreted protein transcripts is dramatically
increased by feeding. There is an 11-fold increase in
secreted molecules in the IR24H library compared to the
IRUF library. During the last two stages of feeding the proportion of secreted proteins decreases while the number
of housekeeping genes, mainly involved in energy and
nutrient metabolism, is slightly higher (Figure 2). Table 3
shows the most abundant secreted groups with more than
5 ESTs and their distribution among the libraries.

Reverse transcriptase-like proteins
Besides housekeeping and secreted salivary proteins there
are several transcripts similar to reverse transcriptases (RT)
or reverse transcriptase-like proteins from other arthropods, mainly insects. It is interesting that 10 out of 11
ESTs similar to RT were found in the unfed tick library and
only one originates from IR7D library, as though such
mechanisms are suppressed during feeding. Additionally,
eight ESTs are similar to RT only as reverse complement.
The presence of anti-sense transcripts has been previously
reported in eukaryotes and their regulative function on
the transcription process has been proposed [43-45]. One
clone (Contig 1006, EY200559) shows 51% similarity to
a transposase from Danio rerio (CAK05416), and contig
255 (EY199575) displays 50% similarity to a mariner-like
transposase (2124399A). The presence of these genes suggests an ongoing process of transposition in the tick
genome. This mechanism could be responsible for the
high duplication rate of some multigenic families.
Another explanation is a lysogenic viral origin of these
proteins.

Collagen-like secreted proteins (CLSP)
The most abundant group in the combined library dataset
comprises 209 ESTs within 71 contigs. Collagen-like
secreted proteins are significantly upregulated by feeding,
as only one contig with two ESTs was found in the IRUF
library. The CLSP are small proline- and glycine-rich peptides with mature molecular mass ranging from 4.5 to 5.5
kDa in I. ricinus. In I. pacificus even smaller peptides (3.6
kDa) were found [31]. The name of the group refers to the
high ratio of proline and glycine amino acid residues
found in collagen. The presence of several X-Pro-Gly
motifs points on the possibility of proline hydroxylation
to hydroxyproline, which is responsible for collagen fibers
production [46]. Hypothetically, CLSP may be able to create polypeptide chains at the site of attachment and function as the attachment glue or could affect the function of
collagen in the interactions among cells, ligands and
matrix [31,32]. Comparison of CLSP from I. ricinus with
homologues from I. scapularis and I. pacificus reveals four

major clades, one of which is exclusively found in I. ricinus, one is exclusively found in I. scapularis and the two
other clades include transcripts from all three Ixodes species (Figure 3). The distribution of ESTs from this multigenic group among libraries implies the sequential
expression of paralogs during the feeding process. Table 4
illustrates the temporal distribution of the CLSP clusters
with more than 5 ESTs, their best match to the Acari database and distribution among the libraries. Some genes are
expressed throughout all feeding stages after attachment
while other genes appear to be expressed strictly within a
specific feeding phase. There are two distinct major groups
of CLSP that differ mainly in the length of C terminal
region and create two distinct clades on the phylogram as
shown in Figures 3 and 4. These groups likely originated
from multiplication of two homologs. Others transcripts,
scattered throughout the tree in Figure 3 diverged before
the speciation of genus Ixodes. Alignment of CLSP contigs
with ≥ 5 ESTs, their relationship and the library of contig
origin are shown in Figure 4. The pattern of gene expression shows different timing for very similar peptides from
the same clade. These proteins possibly play the same role
in the tick or the host during different feeding periods.
One possibility could be an antigenic shift in the most
abundant proteins. Ixodes ricinus is a long term blood
feeder; therefore, a specific immune response is raised
against the tick by the host. The humoral branch of specific immune response is based on the elaboration of specific antibodies by B lymphocytes. The production of
antibodies is activated by tick saliva that contains many
different antigens. It is possible that antibodies raised
against CLSP expressed during the early stages of feeding
can be ineffective against CLSP that are produced later.

[48]. Antigenic variability is usually associated with an
increased genome size and lower genome complexity,
often due to recombination events [47]. This is the case of
the parasitic protozoa in which the genome is much larger
compared with their free-living relatives. Hard ticks possess almost twice as large genome as soft ticks and the
complexity of hard tick genome appears to be much lower
compared with soft ticks [49]. It is unknown if multigenicity and high recombination rates in hard ticks are related
to antigenic variation as stated above or if it is the need for
fast production of large amounts of immunoactive and
other feeding-associated peptides. This question undoubtedly deserves further investigation.
Basic tail secreted proteins (BTSP)
Secreted proteins rich for lysine residues at the C terminus
create the second most abundant peptide family with 95
ESTs in 46 contigs (5.1%). This group is well represented
in both I. scapularis and I. pacificus salivary transcriptomes
[31,32]. Anticoagulant Salp14 (AAY66785), which was
found in I. scapularis and has been shown to inhibit factor
Xa [13], is a member of the BTSP family suggesting an
anticoagulant role for the whole family. The anticoagulation function of the BTSP family is also supported by the
fact that positively-charged proteins can interfere with
negatively-charged membranes of activated platelets [31].
The timing of protein expression of the BTSP related ESTs
is similar to that of the CLSP family; up-regulation by
feeding and then subsequent decrease between the IR24H
and IR4D time points (Table 3). The phylogram in Figure
5 shows all BTSP sequences from the three Ixodes species.
We can see a pattern similar to the CLSP group where each
species creates its own clade. This suggests very fast gene
duplication after speciation.

Mechanisms of antigenic variability are well described for
protozoan parasites and spirochetes [47], yet only one
example has been reported for metazoan parasites thus far

Colagen-like secreted proteins (CLSP)
Colagen-like secreted proteins (CLSP). Unrooted tree of CLSP family based on mature protein sequences and created by
NJ algorithm. Only full-length sequences are included.

Peptides containing Kunitz domain
Kunitz-type domains are present mainly in inhibitors of
trypsin and trypsin-like serine proteinases as chymotrypsin, kallikrein or plasmin. Another type of Kunitzdomain peptides lacking inhibitory properties are toxins
from snake venom called dendrotoxins [50]. We found 31
clusters comprising 62 sequences of Kunitz domain-containing peptides expressed only in the stages after attachment. The expression of Kunitz proteins is highest during
the first day after attachment (34 sequences) and then
decreases throughout the next stages to 11 ESTs on the
seventh day after attachment. Among the contigs containing Kunitz sequences, contig 117 was the most abundant
with 11 ESTs found in the IR24H library.

Twenty six contigs contain a single Kunitz-domain peptide with the general cysteine framework Xn-C-X8-CX(16/18)-C-X5-C-X12-C-X3-C-Xn, similar or identical to

monolaris II, according to nomenclature used by Francischetti et al. [31]. Within the monolaris II group, there are
11 very similar contigs containing a conserved SMGRL
motif in the signal peptide cleavage site. An identical
motif is also present in I. scapularis homologous group,
suggesting common ancestral gene for both I. ricinus and
I. scapularis groups. The phylogram in Figure 6 contains
only full-length monolaris II sequences. Sequences from I.
ricinus are scattered among sequences from I. scapularis
and I. pacificus creating one large group (containing the
SMGRL motif) that is common for I. scapularis and I. ricinus. The subgroup containing the SMGRL motif displays
higher polymorphism than other Kunitz peptides. Contigs 771 (EY200101), 792 (EY200139) and 302
(EY200141) show similarity to tissue factor pathway
inhibitor (TFPI) and contain Xn-C-X(7/9)-C-X15-C-X(5/
7)-C-X12-C-X3-C-Xn framework, which resembles the
monolaris III subgroup. Contig 400 contains two Kunitz

domains and shows high similarity to I. pacificus Ixolaris2 (AAT92212). One EST (contig 807, EY200173) is related
to the five-domain (penthalaris) Kunitz proteins.
Although it is not a full-length clone, similarity to penthalaris group is evident (81% identity with I. scapularis
sequence, AAY66743; e-value = 4e-86). The rate of gene
duplication appears to be slower in the Kunitz-domain
groups compared with the BTSP and CLSP groups, in that
each species chose two or three genes for rapid multiplication. We can presume that the Kunitz-domain group
diverged before speciation of the genus Ixodes.

Kunitz domain-containing proteins function as inhibitors
of serine proteases. Serine proteases can act as inhibitors
of the blood clotting and coagulation systems. It has been
shown that Ixolaris and Penthalaris inhibit the tissue factor pathway of blood clotting [11,12]. Monolaris subgroups can also play a role in anti-clotting and anticoagulation activity, but such activity has not been proved
thus far [32]. Another function could be deduced from the
similarity with snake venom dendrotoxins that function
as K+ channel blockers [50].

Kunitz domain-containing peptides from monolaris II group. Unrooted tree of all full-length monolaris II peptides
from Ixodes ricinus and related sequences from I. scapularis and I. pacificus. The tree is based on protein sequences and created
by NJ algorithm.

18.7 kDa group
Fifteen clusters containing 34 ESTs showed similarity to
an 18.7 kDa group reported previously from both I. scapularis and I. pacificus [31,32]. The overexpression of 18.7
kDa ESTs in the IR24H library (Table 3) suggests the role
of this group during the early phase of feeding. The most
abundant cluster (Contig116, EY200914) contains 10
ESTs from the IR24H library. The 15 clusters create three
main clades together with I. scapularis and I. pacificus
sequences (Figure 7). The mature peptides from all the

three Ixodes species contain 12 conserved cysteines. Four
of the I. ricinus contigs (Contig 115, EY199897; 116,
EY199123; 389, EY199138; 415, EY199200) contain the
same insertion with two additional cysteines as three I.
pacificus and one I. scapularis sequences found on GenBank (for accession numbers see Figure 7). Contigs 115,
116 and 389 contain another insertion of six identical
amino acids (YFDSHS), which appears to be unique for I.
ricinus among all Ixodes species. Two contigs (Contig 450,
EY199271; 477, EY199343) cluster together with three

sequences from I. scapularis (for accession numbers see
Figure 7) creating a single clade, which appears to have a
common ancestral gene. The remaining sequences form
the last and largest clade in Figure 5.
The 18.7 kDa group is comprised of at least three different
polymorphic genes that share a conserved cysteine framework and few domains that suggest the same tertiary structure. The tertiary structure could be more important for
protein function than the individual amino acid composition and conservation. Although we know nothing
about the function of the 18.7 kDa family, the early production after attachment is typical for proteins used
against blood coagulation and platelet aggregation.
Peptides containing Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) domain
Integrins are cell receptors responsible for cell adhesion
by recognition of an RGD motif on several extracellular
matrix proteins such as fibrinogen, vitronectin, collagen
or Von Willebrand factor [51]. RGD-containing proteins
promote cell adhesion when insolubilized in the matrix,
and inhibit cell-cell associations when they are soluble.

Such soluble proteins are called disintegrins and were first
reported from snake venom [52]. Tick peptides containing an RGD domain were shown to inhibit platelet aggregation by targeting GPIIbIIIa receptor and integrin αIIbβ3
[53-55]. Both I. pacificus and I. scapularis produce several
types of RGD motif-containing proteins that are related to
snake venoms [31,32]. Peptides with homology to disintegrins were also found in I. ricinus. Two non-homologous
groups containing RGD motif were found and may act as
disintegrins. The first group (Ixodegrins) is related to Ixodegrins described previously [31] and a snake venom
component dendroaspin. Proteins in the second group
are similar to prokineticin.
The alignment in Figure 8 compares Ixodegrins from I.
ricinus, I. pacificus and I. scapularis. Contig 934
(EY200415) shows high similarity to peptides found in
other Ixodes ticks. The remaining I. ricinus contigs contain
two insertions unique for I. ricinus and show high similarity to each other, suggesting another example of multigenic family. Contigs 146 (EY199187) and 147
(EY199165) contain an Arg-Ala-Asp (RAD) domain rather

than a RGD. It was shown that a change from RGD to RAD
can block the binding and thus disintegrin activity of the
peptide [56]. Ixodegrins are strongly over-expressed 24
hours after attachment and then their expression
decreases (Table 3).
Peptides in the second group contain prokineticin (PK)
domain and the group contains two subgroups related to
Ixodegrin-2A (AAY66752) that differ in molecular mass.
The alignment and phylogram of both subgroups is
shown in Figure 9. The first subgroup includes acidic peptides with a mature molecular mass of 6.4 kDa and a conserved cysteine framework C-X5-C-X4-C-C-X(9–13)-CX9-C. These peptides have no RGD motif; however, they
contain one or even two XGD motifs in the loops between
the cysteines. The second subgroup of PK domain-con-

taining peptides includes acidic peptides with a molecular
mass of 9.3 kDa and contain four additional cysteines at
the C-terminus of 6.4 kDa subgroup creating the framework C-X5-C-X4-C-C-X(9–13)-C-X9-C-X13-C-P-C-X(4–
5)-C-X(4–7)-C. The 9.3 kDa subgroup shows 36% identity and 50% similarity to astakin, a prokineticin domaincontaining peptide isolated from Pacifastacus leniusculus
(Q56R11) and 31% identity and 50% similarity to a prokineticin from Bos taurus (NP_001029190). Astakin was
shown to be an important hematopoietic cytokine in
invertebrates [57] and prokineticin can induce intestinal
contraction in mammals [58]. Prokineticin domain proteins were originally identified as non-toxic peptides from
black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) venom and later isolated from skin secretion of the frog Bombina variegata
[59]. Prokineticin domain peptides appear to be involved

in various biological processes such as control of circadian
rhythm, differentiation of endothelial cells in steroidogenic glands and promotion of angiogenesis in endocrine
tissues [60]. Although RGD motifs were found in I. pacificus and I. scapularis suggesting their disintegrin function,
no RGD motif was found in I. ricinus sequences from the
9.3 kDa group. The lack of RGD implies a different function of the 9.3 kDa subgroup in I. ricinus. Prokineticin
domain-containing peptides from both 6.4 and 9.3 kDa
appear to be expressed equally during all three stages after
attachment. The function of 6.4 kDa and 9.3 kDa subgroups remains to be tested.

Trp-Cys (WC) containing proteins
A group of proteins containing a Trp-Cys (WC) doublet
has been found previously in the sialome of I. scapularis
[32] and appeared to be unique for that species. We can
now provide evidence that this group is common for at
least I. scapularis and I. ricinus. Most of the WC-containing
proteins share a similar seven-cysteine framework C-X11C-X(13–15)-C-X3-C-X(10–14)-C-X(6–7)-C-X(22–26)-C
and several very conserved residues that could be important for proper folding or activity of the mature protein.
The most significant conserved residue other than cysteine
is the tryptophan residue before the last cysteine residue.
It has been proposed that the WC doublet can create a
hydrogen bond resulting in a bend of the peptide chain.

Page 15 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:233

Fifteen contigs consisting of 18 ESTs with homology to
WC containing proteins were identified in all cDNA
libraries except IRUF. The expression of WC peptides is
increased after attachment and the distribution of ESTs is
equal among the three post-attachment libraries (Table
3). The function of this group remains unknown.
Histamine-binding proteins (HBP)
Ten genes coding for the proteins from the HBP lipocalin
family were found in the IR24H, IR4D and IR7D libraries.
The function and evolution of these proteins were
described in detail elsewhere [20,61,62]. Briefly, tick
lipocalins are able to bind histamine in a binding cavity
resulting in the inhibition of inflammation, as histamine
is a very potent mediator of the inflammatory response
[20]. All I. ricinus sequences are similar to other I. scapularis and I. pacificus HBPs except contig 972, which shows
only low similarity to other tick HBP (e-value = 5E-005).
Additionally, BLASTp analysis found no HBP domain
within the sequence, suggesting a potentially different
function yet similar ancestral origin with other HBP coding genes. Histamine-binding proteins may only be
expressed during the later phases of feeding as no
sequences were captured in the unfed library and only one
in IR24H.
Metalloproteases
Thirteen clusters consisting of 18 ESTs showed similarity
to metalloproteases. All sequences were truncated; no fulllength clones have been obtained. Contigs 218
(EY200183), 401 (EY199170) and 841 (EY200242) have
extremely high identities (e-values = 1E-158, 1E-121 and
1E-97) with both I. scapularis and I. pacificus sequences,
suggesting homology to coding genes. Notably, there is
no feeding-induced associated overrepresentation of metalloproteases sequences (Table 3)

The main function of tick metalloproteases is probably
related to anti-clotting activity at the site of attachment.
Proteolytic metal-dependent activity toward fibrin(ogen),
fibronectin and gelatin has been proved for I. scapularis
saliva [23]; however, genes coding for metalloproteases
have been found in 6 ixodid and 2 argasid species thus far,
suggesting the presence of metalloproteases in saliva of
more tick species.
Rare expressed genes similar to known proteins
α-2 macroglobulin
Alpha 2 macroglobulin is a protease inhibitor with a wide
range of specificity [63]. The mechanism of inhibition is
based on the capturing of the protease inside the large
molecule of α-2 macroglobulin. This inhibitor has been
detected in the hemolymph of I. ricinus and Ornithodoros
moubata and possibly functions in tick innate immune
defense against some pathogens [64]. Contig 680 con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/233

tained one EST (EY199886) coding for a peptide with
34% identity and 55% similarity to a receptor region of α2 macroglobulin previously found in I. scapularis
(AAM93645) and I. ricinus (unpublished). The finding of
another α-2 macroglobulin domain provides evidence
that there are at least two different α-2 macroglobulin
homologues in I. ricinus.
Calreticulin
Calreticulin is a protein highly conserved throughout all
animals and usually functions in calcium storage. We
have found only one clone in the IR4D library (Contig
614, EY199726) with 96% identity to I. scapularis calreticulin (AY271305) at the nucleotide level. It has been proposed that tick calreticulin is secreted into the host and
possesses an immunoactive function [65].
Defensins
Defensins are small antimicrobial peptides common for
both vertebrates and invertebrates. Defensins are important in defense against various microbial pathogens
including Borrelia spp. [66]. We found two different
defensins in the IR7D library (Contig 921, EY200392 and
969, EY200491). Contig 921 is a homologue of preprodefensin 1 and 2 isolated from I. ricinus (ABC88432,
AAP94724) suggesting polymorphism in this gene. Contig 969 shows the highest similarity to Varisin A1 from D.
variabilis (AAO24323).
Neuropeptide-like protein (NPL) with GYG repeats
Peptides with GYG repeats were found in Caenorhabditis
elegans and show high antimicrobial activity against certain microbial organisms [67]. Three homologues (Contig
279, 494, 935) of NPL proteins from I. pacificus
(AAT92111, AAT92131) have been identified in IR24H,
IR4D and IR7D libraries. NPL proteins could act as antimicrobial peptides at the site of attachment [30] or they
may be secreted into the hemolymph and be involved in
tick humoral antimicrobial defense.
Carboxypeptidase inhibitor precursor
Contig 929 (EY200408) found in IR7D library showed
66% similarity (e-value = 1E-22) to a carboxypeptidase
inhibitor from Rhipicephalus bursa salivary glands
(AAW72225). The R. bursa carboxypeptidase inhibitor is a
potent anticoagulant which accelerates fibrinolysis in
blood clots [68]. This putative I. ricinus carboxypeptidase
inhibitor adds to the growing family of tick anticoagulants.
Ixoderin B
Ixoderins are tick lectins related to ficolins, which are
responsible for complement activation, and to arthropod
lectins, which act as plasma agglutination activators. In
tick plasma, lectins also play a role in antimicrobial activ-

Page 16 of 21

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:233

ity, potentially against transmitted pathogens [69]. There
are at least two ixoderin families in I. ricinus: Ixoderin A,
which is expressed in all tick tissues and Ixoderin B
expressed only in salivary glands [70]. Contig 617
(EY199735) is homologous to Ixoderin B (AAV41827)
which implies the multigenicity of ixoderin B group. As
ixoderins are related to lectins, they can be involved in tick
innate immunity, but specific expression of Ixoderin B in
salivary glands suggests also some immunomodulatory
function in the host.
Keratinocyte associated protein 2-like protein (KAP2-like)
One transcript (Contig 624, EY199752) coding for KAP2like protein was found in the IR4D library. KAP2-like proteins have been identified in almost all major groups of
eukaryotes according to a tBLASTn search against the EST
database of all organisms. Nothing is known about the
function of KAP-2 protein, but it probably possesses
important housekeeping functions as it is highly conserved among phylogenetically distant organisms.
Phospholipase A2 (PA2)
PA2 activity was found in Ammblyoma americanum saliva
[71] and the genes homologous to the secreted type of
PA2 were identified in other ixodid ticks, according to
tBLASTn search against EST database. This suggests that
PA2 activity in saliva is common for hard ticks. One clone
(Contig 1024, EY200582) was found in the IRUF library
and showed approximately 40% identity and 60% similarity to PA2 from various organisms.
Pitituary tumor transforming protein 1 interacting protein – like
Contig 982 (EY200521) displayed high similarity (45%
identity, 64% similarity, e-value = 2E-30) to PTTG-1-IP
from Gallus gallus (XP_422649). PTTG-1-IP is a protein
that binds PTTG, a protein with multiple regulative functions in mitosis, gene expression, cell transformation and
also angiogenesis [72]. This is the first report of PTTG-1-IP
from invertebrates. The exact function of PTTG and PTTG1-IP is not clear either for mammals or invertebrates.
Other minor secreted proteins
Many tick salivary proteins with a predicted signal peptide
are novel peptides with no similarity among other organisms other than ticks or they are unique for I. ricinus. These
proteins are named after the mature predicted molecular
mass [see Additional file 1]. Many peptides are very small
with molecular weight below 5 or 3 kDa. This may be due
to sequencing artifacts creating false stop codons; however, small peptides can be functional in ticks. For example, there is one thrombin inhibitor isolated from the
hard tick Boophilus microplus called microphilin with a
molecular mass of about 2 kDa [73].

Conclusion
The work presented here highlights several major themes
concerning tick salivary proteins. There is an enormous
overrepresentation of secreted protein transcripts after
attachment and a subsequent shift to the production of
molecules associated with energetic metabolism. This is
probably a result of increased metabolic rate associated
with blood ingestion and digestion. The difference in the
production of mRNAs coding for secreted proteins
between unfed ticks and ticks 24 hours after attachment is
remarkable. An increase of 11 fold shows that hard ticks
possess mechanisms allowing a rapid switch in physiology. While many secreted proteins appear to be induced
after attachment, they are probably important in the feeding process. Protein production is an energetically
demanding process so these proteins should have some
function either in ticks or in the host. Similar abundance
of secreted proteins among the three Ixodes species gives
us an idea of which proteins could be crucial for successful
feeding. The most abundant protein groups (i.e., CLSP,
BTSP, Kunitz-domain or 18.7 kDa groups) are common
for all three species and should be the first to be tested for
any activity in the host. On the other hand, some proteins
that have been tested for activity by other research groups
do not belong into any of the most abundant groups. For
example homologs of Salp15, the only salivary protein
proven to be a SAT factor (peptide facilitating pathogen
transmission) were found in only seven ESTs. The same
EST number was found for the anti-complement proteins
related to ISAC and IRAC isolated from I. scapularis and I.
ricinus. Therefore, rare transcripts should also be evaluated
for functionality. Hypothetically, abundant and strongly
feeding-induced peptides can be aimed against innate
defense mechanisms already active in the early phase of
feeding. The less abundant proteins could possess more
specific immunomodulatory function and could also participate in the SAT effect.
The most abundant protein families display interesting
expression profiles throughout the feeding period and
show temporal control of expression of very similar molecules. Feeding phase-specific expression, as was shown in
the CLSP family, is an interesting phenomenon with several possible explanations: 1) It can be a result of gene
arrangement on the chromosome without any further
importance; 2) There can be sequential production of
functionally identical peptides with different antigenicity
and finally; 3) Similar peptides can have different functions in different stages of feeding. The second explanation is very tempting, because it would be a completely
new aspect of the tick-host interaction, which is common
among parasitic microorganisms, but very rare among
metazoan. However, some points will need to be elucidated. We must know first whether the candidate proteins
for possible antigenic variation are antigenic. If these mol-

ecules are antigenic they would then need to be checked
for cross-reactivity by antibody recognition.
As there is a wide range of I. ricinus hosts, we can discuss
the possibility of expression profile differences among
ticks that were fed on different hosts. It was shown that
different feeding conditions, including different hosts,
result in protein profile changes of the saliva [74]. Ticks
used in our work were fed on guinea-pigs, which are not
natural host of I. ricinus; however, it is widely used laboratory model in tick research. Although there is no direct
evidence of differences between sialomes of ticks fed on
different animals, we assume that the data obtained with
ticks fed on guinea-pigs can be applied to other hosts.
Future research may be needed to test the possible effects
of host influences on the tick sialome.
There is a high ratio of unknown transcripts in unfed ticks.
To date, only one salivary gland library from unfed Ixodid
ticks (A. americanum) was published in the GenBank. The
lack of sequences from comparable feeding stage could be
the reason for such high proportion of unknown transcripts in unfed library. As the main function of tick salivary glands during the starving phase is osmoregulation
[75], some of unknown proteins could be involved in the
process of water balance regulation.
The presence of multigenic, highly polymorphic families
supports the theory of gene conversion and duplication in
tick genome evolution. Comparison of the three phylogenetically close species shows an unusually high rate of
gene duplication in many multigenic families. The cause
of such fast gene multiplication in hard ticks is still not
known; although, there is suspicion for the role of transposition in this process. It is notable that a number of
organisms that use multigenic proteins, mainly for antigenic variation, are pathogens transmitted by hard ticks. It
would be worthwhile to know whether there is any relationship between tick and transmitted pathogen multigenicity.
There are several abundantly secreted and blood mealassociated proteins that are probably very important for
successful feeding. All of the most abundant proteins
appear to be multigenic with an amount ranging from several to tens of paralogs. There is also a high probability of
polymorphism and the number of homologs is probably
higher than the number found in this work. Now, we have
large databases of putative proteins expressed in tick salivary glands, but for the most part, the proper function is
unknown. For some proteins a prediction based on
sequence homology can be made; however, it is still
unclear whether similar proteins from one family possess
the same function as the homologs. On the whole, there
are many salivary proteins that need to be tested for their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/233

function. It appears that a high-throughput approach
would be highly beneficial for functional screening of tick
salivary proteins. Additionally, the contribution of new
sequences into the public databases will bring benefits for
all the scientific community interested in tick and vector
research or comparative phylogenetic studies.
As we unfold more peculiarities about tick genetics,
thanks to the sialome research, we can see that ticks are
interesting – not only for study of parasite-host interaction or searching for novel pharmacoactive molecules, but
they prove to be an important model organism for disclosing some mechanisms of gene and genome evolution.

Methods
Ticks and tissue isolation
Ixodes ricinus adult females were obtained from the colonies maintained at the Institute of Parasitology of Czech
Academy of Sciences in Ceske Budejovice. Pathogen-free
ticks were fed on the guinea pigs complying with Act No.
207/2004 Coll. and approval AVCR 51/2005 given by the
committee of Czech Academy of Sciences. Approximately
10 pairs of salivary glands were dissected from both unfed
and fed adult ticks. Dissections were done in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS); glands from each stage were washed
in sterile ice-cold PBS, pooled together into a single tube
and stored in RNAlater (Ambion, USA) until mRNA isolation.
Synthesis of cDNA libraries and sequencing
Messenger RNA was isolated using Micro Fast Track
mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the
manufacturer protocol. Precipitated, washed and dried
mRNA was diluted into 4 μl of DEPC-treated H2O and 3
μl of mRNA were used for first strand cDNA synthesis. The
construction of cDNA libraries was done using the SMART
cDNA library construction kit (BD Clontech, USA)
according to the protocol provided by manufacturer, with
some modifications. In order to determine optimal
number of cycles, two identical amplification reactions
were prepared. After 10th amplification cycle the first one
was stored on the ice, while the second one was used for
the PCR cycles number optimization by removing 3 μl
samples from the reaction every two cycles until cycle
number 22. The samples were checked by visualization on
an agarose gel. The optimal number of cycles with visible
and equally represented products was used for the first
amplification reaction (e.g. When 18 cycles were optimal,
8 additional cycles were used). The amplified DNA was
treated with proteinase K, which was subsequently
washed away by several washings with ultrapure water
using Microcon YM-100 (Millipore). After Sfi I digestion
and fractionation using a Chroma Spin-400 column (BD
Clontech, USA) the fractions were checked using agarose
gel and pooled into three tubes in a size-dependent man-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:233

ner (large, medium and small PCR products). Each
pooled cDNA was washed with ultrapure water and concentrated to 4–7 μl using Microcon YM-100 column (Millipore). Three microliters from each tube were used for the
ligation into the λTripleEx2 vector. The ligation reaction
was packed into the phages using the Gigapack III Gold
Packaging extract (Stratagene). Three libraries (large,
medium, small) were constructed for each feeding phase
resulting in total of 12 libraries. Each un-amplified library
was plated onto LB agar plates aiming for approximately
300 clones per one 150 mm plate. Randomly selected
clones were picked into the 96-well plate with 75 μl of
water per well. Two plates were picked per library resulting in 6 plates for each feeding phase and 24 plates (2304
clones) for the experiment. Polymerase chain reaction
with vector-specific primers (PT2F1 5'- AAGTACTCTAGCAATTGTGAGC -3' and PT2R1 5'- CTCTTCGCTATTACGCCAGCTG - 3') was done on selected clones.
Cleaned PCR products were used as template for cyclesequencing reaction using BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and
forward primer PT2F3 primer 5' - CTCGGGAAGCGCGCCATTGT - 3'. Samples were directly
sequenced on an ABI 96 capillary DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems), or stored at -80°C.
Bioinformatics
A detailed description of the bioinformatic treatment of
the data appears elsewhere [33,76]. For this analysis, EST
trace files were analyzed using a customized program
based on the Phred algorithm [77]. Resulting sequences
with average quality score greater than 20 were retained
for subsequent analysis. Primer and vector sequences were
removed from the 5' and 3' ends of the ESTs. The resultant
sequences were grouped into clusters using a customized
program (Cluster 6) based on identity (95% identity, 64
word size) and aligned into contiguous sequences (contigs) using the CAP3 sequence assembly program [78].
BLAST searches of individual contigs and singletons using
executable programs obtained from the NCBI FTP site as
previously described [76,79] were conducted against the
non-redundant (NR) protein database of the NCBI, the
gene ontology (GO) fasta subset [43], the conserved
domains database (CDD) of NCBI [80] which contains
the KOG [81], Pfam [82] and Smart databases [83] and to
custom-downloaded databases containing ACARI (a subset containing mite and tick sequences), mitochondrial
and rRNA nucleotide sequences available from NCBI.
Peptides were submitted to the SignalP server as previously described [76,84] to detect signal peptides indicative of secretion. The individual cDNA libraries were
directly compared with each other using a customized
program (Count Libraries) that assesses the individual
contribution of each individual library to the combined
contig of interest. This analysis indicates putative proteins

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/233

that may be over- or under-represented at a given time
point. Chi-square analysis was conducted on contigs that
contained more than 5 ESTs.
