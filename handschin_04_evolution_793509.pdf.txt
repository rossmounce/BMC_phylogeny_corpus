Abstract
Background: Drugs and other xenobiotics alter gene expression of cytochromes P450 (CYP) by
activating the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in
mammals. In non-mammalian species, only one xenosensor gene has been found. Using chicken as
a model organism, the aim of our study was to elucidate whether non-mammalian species only have
one or two xenosensors like mammals.
Results: To explore the evolutionary aspect of this divergence, we tried to identify additional
xenobiotic sensing nuclear receptors in chicken using various experimental approaches. However,
none of those revealed novel candidates. Ablation of chicken xenobiotic receptor (CXR) function
by RNAi or dominant-negative alleles drastically reduced drug-induction in a chicken hepatoma cell
line. Subsequently, we functionally and structurally characterized CXR and compared our results
to PXR and CAR. Despite the high similarity in their amino acid sequence, PXR and CAR have very
distinct modes of activation. Some aspects of CXR function, e.g. direct ligand activation and high
promiscuity are very reminiscent of PXR. On the other hand, cellular localization studies revealed
common characteristics of CXR and CAR in terms of cytoplasmic-nuclear distribution. Finally,
CXR has unique properties regarding its regulation in comparison to PXR and CAR.
Conclusion: Our finding thus strongly suggest that CXR constitutes an ancestral gene which has
evolved into PXR and CAR in mammals. Future studies should elucidate the reason for this
divergence in mammalian versus non-mammalian species.

Background

Results and Discussion

A gene superfamily of heme-proteins, the cytochromes
P450 (CYP), encodes the main enzymatic system for
metabolism of structurally diverse lipophilic substrates
[1]. A subset of these CYPs can be activated or inhibited in
the liver by a variety of xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds. Transcriptional activation of these CYPs is part of
an adaptive response to exposure to drugs and other xenobiotics and has major clinical and toxicological implications. The enzymatic capacities of the affected CYPs are
changed, leading to an altered metabolic profile in the
liver [2]. The barbiturate phenobarbital (PB) is prototypical for a class of compounds that induce or repress hepatic
CYPs and many other genes [3]. PB-responsive enhancer
units (PBRU) have been identified in the 5'-flanking
regions of several of these CYPs and transcription factors
binding to those units could be isolated (reviewed in [47]). In mammals, the pregnane X receptor (PXR, official
nomenclature NR1I2) and the constitutive androstane
receptor (CAR, NR1I3), both belonging to the gene superfamily of nuclear receptors, have been identified to be
involved in hepatic drug-induction [8-12].

Orthologs of PXR and CAR have been isolated from man,
monkey, pig, dog, rabbit, mouse and rat [15]. In nonmammalian species, only one xenosensor gene is found
and sequence-wise, the corresponding receptors from
chicken, zebrafish, fugu fish and C. elegans are about
equally related to the mammalian PXRs and CARs (Fig.
1A). Of the 18 nuclear receptors in the fruitfly Drosophila
melanogaster genome, DHR96 shares considerable similarity to the xenosensors but the functions of this receptor
have not been elucidated yet. Although the African clawed
frog Xenopus laevis has two nuclear receptors, benzoate X
receptor α and β (BXRα/β, NR1I2), that are related to the
xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors, the BXRs are pharmacologically distinct from PXR and CAR and do not
respond to xenobiotics [15,20]. No drug-sensing nuclear
receptors have thus been isolated in amphibians so far.
Figure 1A shows the phylogeny of the xenobiotic-sensing
nuclear receptors from different species. The completion
of the rat genome allowed a global analysis of the nuclear
receptors from three mammalian species, man, mouse
and rat. In the nuclear receptor subfamily NR1I which
includes the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor (VDR,
NR1I1) in addition to PXR and CAR, intron-exon junctions are highly conserved [21]. Human and rodent CARs
and PXRs have the same number of introns. Moreover,
apart from one intron which is found in the variable
region 5' of the DNA-binding domain, all other seven
introns are located in the same position on the corresponding genes, even in the ligand-binding domains that
in the case of CAR and PXR are unusually divergent for
nuclear receptor orthologs [22]. Using a chicken genomic
library, we isolated the gene encoding CXR and analyzed
its structure. Again, the number of introns in the CXR coding sequence was the same as those in the mammalian
xenosensors and the intron-exon junctions occur at the
same locations (Figure 1B). The apparent conservation of
gene structures between the single chicken xenosensors
and the two mammalian orthologs suggest a close relationship between these receptors and supports the
hypothesis that CXR constitutes an ancestral gene in
chicken from which two receptors diverged in mammals.

Strikingly, in contrast to the two xenobiotic-sensing
nuclear receptors in mammals, only one xenosensor has
been found in non-mammalian species, e.g. chicken [13],
fish (fugu Fugu rubripes [14] and zebrafish Danio rerio
[15]) or the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [16]. The
amino acid sequence of the full-length chicken xenobiotic
receptor (CXR, NR1I3) is about equally related to those of
mammalian PXRs and CARs [17]. Moreover, chicken CXR
and mammalian PXR and CAR as well as drug-inducible
CYP enhancer elements from these species could be freely
interchanged in transactivation and electrophoretic
mobility shift assays suggesting evolutionary conservation
of the fundamental hepatic drug-induction mechanisms
from birds to man [18].
In this report, we studied the evolutionary aspects of these
findings. Despite using various methods and techniques,
we were unable to isolate further genes that encode
chicken xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors confirming
the hypothesis that non-mammalian genomes only have
one xenosensor gene. Since PXR and CAR exhibit different
typical features concerning their activation, localization
and regulation [6,19], we examined the properties of CXR
to see whether on the functional and structural level, the
chicken xenosensor shares common aspects with one or
both of the mammalian receptors. Our findings give
important insights the evolution of hepatic detoxification
systems that protect different species from toxic compounds in their particular diet and environment.

To further test this hypothesis, we used different experimental approaches in order to isolate additional chicken
xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors. Neither high- and
low-stringency screening of a chicken liver cDNA library
using CXR, CAR and PXR fragments as probes nor PCRbased strategies with degenerate primers designed on CAR
and PXR alignments or degenerate primers based on
generic nuclear receptor DNA-binding domains [23]
resulted in the identification of novel chicken xenobioticsensing receptors (data not shown). The sequences of the
previously unknown chicken orthologs for estrogenrelated receptor γ (ERRγ, NR3B3) and a partial fragment of

AY702439, respectively).
If CXR in fact is the only chicken xenobiotic-sensing
nuclear receptor, ablation of CXR expression or function
is predicted to drastically reduce drug-induction of CYPs
and other target genes. To reduce CXR expression, we
designed RNAi oligonucleotides targeting CXR and stably
expressed those in the chicken hepatoma cell line leghorn
male hepatoma (LMH). LMH cells express endogenous
CXR and retain induction of genes by PB-type inducer
compounds and other drugs [18]. As shown in Figure 2A,
endogenous mRNA levels of CXR were reduced about
60% by the RNAi. LMH cells expressing either control vector or CXR RNAi were subsequently transfected with drugresponsive enhancer elements from CYP2H1 [17],
CYP3A37 [24], CYP2C45 [25] and δ-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-1) [26] and treated with vehicle or 400 µM
PB for 16 hours. ALAS-1 is the first and rate-limiting
enzyme in heme biosynthesis and its transcription is regulated by a variety of factors and stimuli, including PBtype inducers and other drugs [26,27]. In the case of ALAS1, the 2-fold PB-induction was completely abolished by
the CXR RNAi (Figure 2E). In contrast, PB-activation of
the CYP2H1, CYP3A37 and CYP2C45 PBRUs was only
partially reduced by 50 to 60% (Figure 2B,2C,2D). In
these cases, reduction of CXR levels by 60% might not be
enough. Alternatively, these findings could also be
explained by the presence of additional drug-sensing signalling mechanism independent of CXR.
Thus, we used an alternative method that aimed at reducing CXR activity by designing dominant-negative CXR
alleles. These CXR mutants were then tested in reporter
gene assays on drug-responding enhancer elements. In
our case, we generated three different CXR alleles (Figure
3A): first, we deleted the N-terminus since in some
nuclear receptors, this part harbours a ligand-independent
activation domain AF-1 [28,29]. Second, site-directed
mutagenesis of the cysteine residues in the zinc-fingers of
the DNA-binding domain results in a CXR mutant that is
expected to lack DNA-binding but to retain its ability to
bind activators and to heterodimerize with its partner
retinoid X receptor (RXR, NR2B1/2/3). Third, helix 12 in
the ligand-binding domain was deleted which harbours a
ligand-dependent activation domain AF-2. Nuclear receptors that act as dominant-negative alleles due to the
absence of a functional AF-2 domain have been observed
in some diseases (e.g. see refs. [30,31]). These findings
were subsequently used to generate various dominantnegative nuclear receptor mutants for cellular assays [32].
First, the three CXR mutants were tested for their ability to
bind to and activate a 264-bp PBRU isolated from the 5'-

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/2/1/7

flanking region of chicken CYP2H1 [17,33]. As shown in
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Figure 3B), CXR can
heterodimerize with RXR and bind to the 264-bp PBRU as
wild-type, full-length receptor and when the N-terminal
region from amino acid 1–29 (called ∆N-term) or the Cterminal region from amino acid 383–391 (referred to as
∆AF-2) are deleted, respectively (Figure 3B, lanes 8, 10 and
12). As expected, site-directed mutagenesis of four
cysteine within the DNA-binding domain into alanine
residues (denominated DBD) that participate in forming
the zinc-finger domains abolishes protein-DNA interaction (lane 11). These results show that removal of the Nterminus or the C-terminus of CXR does not influence its
binding to DNA. Subsequently, the CXR mutants were
tested in CV-1 transactivation assays for functionality. The
CV-1 monkey kidney cells constitute an excellent tool to
study nuclear receptor function in a cellular system which
does not express endogenous xenosensors, is not druginducible and thus has a very low background in these
assays. Neither CXR lacking its C-terminal activation
domain AF-2 (∆AF-2) nor CXR with the mutated DNAbinding domain (DBD) are able to transactivate the
CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU in CV-1 cell assays (Figure 3C). In
contrast, removal of the N-terminus of CXR (∆N-term)
has no effect on its transactivation potential suggesting
that no activation function AF-1 is present in these 29
amino acids. Finally, the test whether any of these CXR
mutant alleles acts in a dominant-negative fashion is performed in the LMH cells which do express endogenous
CXR and which are drug-inducible [18]. When co-transfected with the 264-bp PBRU, the CXR allele lacking a
functional AF-2 domain (∆AF-2) drastically decreases PBinduction of the PBRU (Figure 3D). In contrast, the DNAbinding domain (DBD) and the N-terminal truncated
(∆N-term) mutants have no effect. Similar results were
obtained with PBRUs from other drug-responsive genes
(data not shown). Together, the RNAi experiments and
the findings using the dominant-negative CXR mutants
show that functionally, CXR is the major drug-sensing
nuclear receptor in chicken.
A significant difference between PXR and CAR in mammals is their mode of activation and their cellular
localization [19]. PXR is strongly activated by a huge
number of compounds. In contrast, CAR exhibits less promiscuity but high constitutive activity in most cellular
assays [34]. However, CAR activity can be modulated by
inverse agonists, agonists and different protein phosphorylation events [35]. In terms of activation, CXR is also
highly promiscuous and normally has a low basal activity,
thus pharmacologically more resembling a PXR-type than
a CAR-type receptor [13,15]. Regulation of CAR activity
can in part be explained by its unusual cellular localization. Both PXR and CAR undergo cytoplasmic-nuclear
shuttling upon activation [36-40]. However, in contrast to

PXR, CAR translocates after activation by PB, other xenobiotics or bilirubin for which no direct binding to the ligand-binding pocket was found. Although some progress
in identifying CAR-interaction partners have been made
recently [41,42], the mechanisms controlling the
cytosolic-nuclear translocation are not clear. Interestingly,
CAR translocation is independent of the C-terminal AF-2
function but instead requires the xenochemical response
signal (XRS) LXXLXXL located between leucine 313 and
leucine 319 in the human CAR sequence [37]. In contrast,
cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of VDR, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, NR3C1) and the progesterone receptor
(PR, NR3C3) is dependent on AF-2 suggesting a different
mechanism for CAR shuttling [37,43]. A putative XRS
(LLLLTEL) is also found in the CXR sequence between leucine 356 and leucine 362. Thus, to assess the relatedness
of CXR to PXR and CAR in terms of cellular localization,
we engineered different CXR-green fluorescent protein
(GFP) fusion proteins. These were subsequently tested for
functionality in CV-1 cell transactivation assays using the
264-bp PBRU as drug-sensitive enhancer. CXR with N-terminal, but not C-terminal GFP is activated by 400 µM PB
and 10 µM clotrimazole after 16 hours of incubation (Figure 4A). Site-directed leucine to glycine mutagenesis in
the CXR XRS reduces its ability to confer drug activation in
these assays (Figure 4A).

cell (Figure 4B). As depicted in Figure 4C, GFP-CXR in
vehicle-treated LMH cells is exclusively in the nucleus.
Treatment of transiently transfected LMH cells with 400

µM PB for 16 hours leads to an increase of GFP-staining in
the cytosol (Figure 4D). Similar observations have been
made for a variety of nuclear receptors where activation
stimulates their export from the nucleus and subsequent
degradation in the cytosol [44,45]. Accordingly, PB-treatment of LMH cells results in decreased CXR protein levels
in total cell lysates (Figure 5, lanes 1 and 2) and even more
dramatic in nuclear extracts (Figure 5, lanes 3 and 4)
suggesting that activated CXR protein is more rapidly
exported from the nucleus and degraded of this receptor.
Most nuclear receptors that are exported and degraded
upon activation share a conserved KXFFK/RR motif
between the two zinc-fingers in the DNA-binding domain
that can serve as binding site for calreticulin which is
involved in the nuclear export [45]. PXR, CAR and CXR
also contain a KGFFRR-motif but whether calreticulin
plays a role in nuclear export of these receptors remains to
be investigated. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid inhibits PB-induction of mammalian and
chicken PBRUs [13,18,46,47]. In transiently transfected
LMH cells, 100 nM okadaic acid prevents nuclear localization of CXR after 16 hours (Figure 4E). Moreover, protein
levels of the GFP-CXR fusion protein were reduced. Okadaic acid treatment prevents the drug-induced cytosolicnuclear translocation of CAR [36]. Our findings regarding
CXR are therefore very reminiscent of those results. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of the XRS reduces
the nuclear localization of CXR (Figure 4F) but not as
completely as XRS mutations of CAR in mouse primary
hepatocyte cultures [37]. The nuclear-cytoplasmic redistribution of this CXR mutant correlates with the decrease in
its ability to activate the 264-bp PBRU in transactivation
assays (Figure 4A). Thus, although CXR is normally found
in the nucleus like PXR, it shares some features with CAR
concerning its localization after treatment with okadaic
acid or when its XRS is mutated.
In primary human hepatocytes, glucocorticoids have a
dual effect on the expression of the drug-inducible
CYP3A4 that is regulated by both PXR and CAR [48]. At
low concentrations, these compounds activate GR which
subsequently induces transcript levels of PXR and CAR
[49,50] whereas higher concentrations of glucocorticoids
directly activate PXR [9,51]. We thus wanted to test
whether the chicken CXR is regulated in the same way as
the mammalian xenobiotic-sensing receptors. Treatment
of LMH with 50 µM dexamethasone (Dex) for 16 hours
did not alter CXR expression (Figure 6). Moreover, dexamethasone does not activate CXR directly, at least at this
concentration [13]. In contrast, dexamethasone increases
transcription of the chicken peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα, NR1C1), the chicken liver X
receptor (LXR, NR1H3) and the chicken farnesoid X
receptor (FXR, NR1H4). These receptors play important
roles in maintaining hepatic bile acid, cholesterol and

changes in intrahepatic lipid levels which then potentially
affects transcription of the other receptors. However, the
regulatory network of these receptors is still under
investigation.

lipid homeostasis, respectively [52]. PXR, CAR and CXR
have been found to be activated by bile acids and thus are
involved in the regulation of the intrahepatic levels of
lipid soluble compounds by stimulating metabolism and
subsequent excretion of these compounds [12,53,54].
Therefore, activation of one of these receptors leads to

Molecular modelling studies confirm the close relationship between chicken and fish xenosenors to mammalian
PXR. X-ray structures of human PXR revealed several peculiarities of the PXR ligand-binding domain which are not
found in other nuclear receptors [55,56]. First, PXR has an
expanded β-sheet with two more strands. Moreover, helix
6 is completely and helix 7 partially unwinded which
leaves a solvent-accessible hole in the ligand-binding
pocket that is capped by an extension in helix 1–3.
Although an extended β-sheet is not obvious in chicken
and fish xenosensors, both receptors have long helix 1–3
inserts which could potentially induce partial unwinding
of helix 6 and 7. Thus, molecular modelling of aligned
amino acid sequences suggest enlarged ligand binding
pockets for both fish and chicken xenobiotic-sensing
receptors which could explain their high promiscuity [15].
In striking contrast, CARs not only lack an extended βsheet but also have a much shorter helix 1–3 resulting in
a more rigid and less promiscuous ligand binding pocket
[15,57,58]. Therefore, the relatively high degree of
promiscuity of CAR could at least partially be due to the
ability of different compounds to trigger cytoplasmicnuclear translocation of this receptor independent of
direct binding [35]. The loop connecting helix 11 and 12
is much shorter in the CAR sequence than most other
nuclear receptors [15,57]. This short loop might reduce
the ability of helix 12 and AF-2 to reach an inactive conformation and thus could explain the constitutive activity
of CAR [57]. CAR also has a shorter helix 12 than most
other nuclear receptors [57]. Interestingly, helix 12 of CXR
is very conserved to that of mammalian CARs in terms of
amino acid composition and of length whereas the length
of the zebrafish xenosensor helix 12 is intermediate
between CARs and PXRs.

Conclusions
In summary, our results confirm that in contrast to mammals which have two xenobiotic-sensing receptor PXR
and CAR, the genome of other species encodes for only
one xenosensor. This hypothesis is supported by analysis
in the fugu fish genome (data not shown), unsuccessful
attempts to isolate further xenosenors in chicken and
functional assays showing that ablation of CXR function
drastically reduces drug-inducibility in a chicken
hepatoma cell line. Our findings presented here and those
of other laboratories imply that PXR and CAR origin from
one ancestral gene which diverged into two genes in
mammals. This ancestral gene, in chicken coding for CXR,
is a promiscuous, PXR-like receptor. Thus, CXR and
related receptors from fish are activated by a variety of dif-

ferent compounds [13,15]. Interestingly, in a
comprehensive study of different classes of ligands on
xenosensors from man, monkey, pig, dog, mouse, chicken
and fish, CXR was one of the most promiscuous receptors
in regard to the compounds tested [15]. Therefore, the
ancestral xenosensors in non-mammalian species might
have a broader substrate spectrum than their mammalian
counterparts where the task for detoxification is split
between two receptors [59]. On the other hand, CXR also
shares some features with CAR that are not found in PXR:
its short helix 12, the xenochemical response signal and in
part its cellular localization after okadaic acid treatment.
Finally, in contrast to both PXR and CAR, CXR is not regulated by glucocorticoid treatment in the chicken LMH
cells suggesting that this regulation was acquired only
after birds and mammals diverged from a common
ancestor.
Evolution of drug-metabolizing CYPs and xenobioticsensing nuclear receptors is influenced by diet and
exposure to other environmental chemicals. Accordingly,
drug-induction is very species specific. This is reflected in
the unusually divergent ligand-binding domains of PXRs
and CARs orthologs [22]. When comparing PXRs and
CARs from human, mouse and rat, nonsynonymous
nucleotide substitution rates are considerably higher in
comparison to any other nuclear receptor [21] and reflect
the different evolutionary adaptations of these species to
their specific environment. It is thus extremely puzzling
why in non-mammalian species, one xenosensor is sufficient whereas two xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors
have evolved in mammals. Furthermore, it is unclear why
in addition to the ligand-activated PXR, mammalian
genomes encode CAR, a nuclear receptor that is unorthodox in many ways. On one hand, CAR and PXR might just
share the workload in hepatic detoxification of xenobiotics. On the other hand, evidence accumulated in recent
years that both PXR and CAR have functions that go
beyond detoxification. As example, PXR and CAR form an
intricate network with other nuclear receptors and transcription factors to regulate hepatic cholesterol and bile
acid homeostasis [60]. It is thus conceivable that these
receptors have so-far unidentified functions in mammals
which require two receptors and that are thus absent in
non-mammalian species. Therefore, further insights into
the evolution of drug-sensing nuclear receptors are
extremely important in order to gain novel insights into
the role of these factors in the physiology and pathophysiology of the liver.

Methods
LMH and CV-1 cell culture, transfection and reporter gene
assays
Culture and transfection of LMH cells with FUGENE 6
Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals,

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/2/1/7

Rotkreuz, Switzerland) were performed as published
[17,33]. Before transfections, LMH cells were kept in
serum-free medium for 24 hours. CV-1 cell transactivation
assays have been described in detail [17,33]. Sixteen or
twenty-four hours after drug-treatment, cells were harvested and assays for CAT expression using a CAT ELISA
Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). CAT concentrations were normalized against βgalactosidase activities to compensate for different transfection efficiencies.
Isolation of the CXR gene
Chicken BAC filters (UK Human Genome Mapping
Project Resource Center, UK) were hybridised with a
probe encoding for CXR. Positive clones were purchased,
digested with different restriction enzymes and Southern
blots obtained using the same probe. Bands hybridising
with the CXR probe were isolated, subcloned and CXR
genomic information obtained by PCR using primers
designed after the CXR mRNA sequence.
Site-directed mutagenesis
Mutagenesis was carried out using overlapping primers as
described [17]. Mutated fragments were excised, cloned
into new vectors and verified by sequencing.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays have been described
in detail [33]. Proteins were expressed using the TNT in
vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega, Wallisellen,
Switzerland) before being subjected to non-denaturing
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with [32P]-radiolabeled CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU.
Targeting of CXR in LMH cells by RNAi
Expression of CXR in LMH cells was repressed by RNAi as
described [61]. In brief, a 19 bp fragment ranging from
position 857 to 875 in the open reading frame of CXR was
chosen for targeting. A double-stranded oligonucleotide
containing this sequence and compatible ends for cloning
into pSUPER was obtained by annealing single stranded
oligonucleotides for the sense (GATCCCCGGATGGGGCTCTGGCCGGCTTCAAGAGAGCCGGCCAGAGCCCCATCCTTTTTGGAAA) and the anti-sense strand
(AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGGATGGGGCTCTGGCCGGCTCTCTTGAAGCCGGCCAGAGCCCCATCCGGG) and
subsequent ligation into pSUPER cut with BglII and HindIII (underlined letters refer to CXR-specific targeting
sequence). After verification of the ligation product the
pSUPER-CXR-RNAi expression cassette was cut out using
BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into BglII/XhoI-digested
pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). The ScaI-linearised
construct was transfected into LMH cells using FUGENE 6
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).
Stable transfectants were selected by addition of 175 µg/

ml G418 (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) to the cell
culture medium. A control cell line was selected in parallel
which was stably transfected with pcDNA3 carrying the
empty pSUPER expression cassette. Reporter gene assays
in LMH cells using the CXR-RNAi clones were performed
using reporter constructs for CYP2H1, CYP3A37,
CYP2C45 and ALAS-1 described previously [17,24-26].
Cellular localization studies
LMH cells were cultivated on glass cover slips and subsequently transfected with pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-N1 expression plasmids (Clontech, Allschwil, Switzerland) before
cells were either treated with vehicle, 400 µM PB or 0.1
µM okadaic acid for 16 hours. Cells were washed with
PBS, fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 30 minutes, washed
again with PBS, stained with 300 nM DAPI and subsequently mounted on glass slides. Digital images were captured using a Leica DC 300F camera (Leica, Nidau,
Switzerland) mounted on a Leitz DMRB microscope with
the Leica IM50 Image Manager program version 1.20. Figures were assembled with Adobe Photoshop version 5.0.

CXR antibodies, nuclear extracts and Western blots
CXR ligand-binding domain was expressed in bacteria,
purified and injected into rabbits for antibody production
according to standard procedures. Anti-CXR-ligand-binding domain antibody from rabbit serum was subsequently
used in Western blots. LMH cells were grown under standard conditions and treated with vehicle or 400 µM PB
overnight. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS and
protein extracts prepared using RIPA buffer. As control,
CV-1 cells were transfected with empty pSG5 expression
vector or vector expressing CXR and subsequently lysed
with RIPA buffer. Nuclear extracts were prepared as published [62].
Northern hybridisation
LMH cells were treated with the indicated compounds for
16 hours before total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL
Reagent (Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland). Twenty
µg of total RNA were subjected to electrophoresis and analysed in Northern hybridisations as described [17,33].
