Abstract
Background: Transposable elements are selfish genetic sequences which only occasionally
provide useful functions to their host species. In addition, models of mobile element evolution
assume a second type of selfishness: elements of different familes do not cooperate, but they
independently fight for their survival in the host genome.
Results: We show that recombination events among distantly related Athila retrotransposons
have led to the generation of new Athila lineages. Their pattern of diversification suggests that
Athila elements survive in Arabidopsis by a combination of selfish replication and of amplification of
highly diverged copies with coding potential. Many Athila elements are non-autonomous but still
conserve intact open reading frames which are under the effect of negative, purifying natural
selection.
Conclusion: The evolution of these mobile elements is far more complex than hitherto assumed.
Strict selfish replication does not explain all the patterns observed.

Background
Mobile elements are selfish genomic parasites that only
rarely benefit their hosts [1-4]. They belong to two main
classes, with or without RNA intermediates, and most
eukaryotic genomes contain several types or families of
elements of each class [5-7]. A family is a set of very similar sequences that generally include some active elements
plus a variable number of non-autonomous, defective
copies derived from the active ones. Classical mobile element evolution models suggested that selfishness drives
the evolution of each family. Altruistically amplifying
either defective copies or elements of other families would
decrease the likelihood of long-term survival for a family
of elements [5,6,8]. The available data for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster genomes, among
others, in which the rule is to find families of recent ori-

gin, composed by almost identical and highly active elements [9,10], agrees well with those models. However,
whether elements that pervade other genomes, especially
those with larger amounts of repetitive sequences, follow
the same dynamics has been less extensively studied. In
fact, the replication of some types of non-autonomous
sequences (e. g. SINEs, MITEs, probably several types of
retrotransposon-derived plant repeats) present in large
numbers in some genomes depend on mobile elements
(reviewed in [11-13]). It is not obvious what kind of
advantage may obtain the mobile elements involved, and
therefore those non-autonomous sequences are considered to replicate parasitically. However, it is possible to
envisage situations in which the amplification of nonautonomous elements contributes to the survival of active
elements, a possibility that remains largely unexplored.

Some evidence for such type of cooperation within a family is available. For example, active Drosophila P elements
may improve their likelihood of survival by replicating
particular types of defective elements that negatively control the transposition rates of the active ones, thus diminishing the harmful effects on the host (reviewed in [14];
see also [15] for related examples).
Athila is one of the best-known plant long-terminalrepeat (LTR) retrotransposons [16-20]. It belongs to the
Ty3/Gypsy group, evolutionary closely related to mammalian retroviruses [21]. Actually, some Athila retrotransposons and a few related plant elements are structurally
identical to simple retroviruses. They have, in addition to
their gag and pol genes, a third ORF, generally absent in
other LTR retrotransposons. It may encode an envelope
(Env) protein, potentially able to allow the generation of
viral infective particles ([17,19,20]; see review [22]). However, whether Athila behaves as an infective retrovirus is
still unknown. The evolution of Athila retrotransposons
has been traced back using phylogenetic analyses based
on their reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences, which are
part of the pol gene [17,18,20,22,23]. These analyses demonstrated that Athila elements are highly heterogenous.
Particularly, our group showed that Athila RTs are more
variable than those of other eight lineages of Arabidopsis
Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons and that there is no relationship between the degree of similarity among elements and
the pattern of presence or absence of env sequences, suggesting that Athila evolution follows a complex pattern
[18].
In this study, we show that the combined analyses of
Athila gag, env and pol sequences provides a novel view of
the evolutionary forces acting on these retrotransposons
in the Arabidopsis genome. We determine that most Athila
elements lack pol sequences and therefore are non-autonomous. Some of these elements have however retained
intact ORFs that encode for Gag and Env proteins. These
ORFs are under the effect of negative, purifying selection
and therefore they must be functional. Moreover, diversification and survival of Athila elements in Arabidopsis has
often involved recombination among distantly-related
elements. In one particular case, recombination involving
non-autonomous elements has contributed to generate an
active element that moreover has acquired a typical retroviral structure. These results are not compatible with the
simplistic view of selfish amplification of independent
Athila families.

Results
Arabidopsis Athila elements can be divided into ancient
families, many of them exclusively composed by nonautonomous elements
As already indicated above, the evolutionary analyses performed so far on Athila elements have been focused on
comparing RT sequences. However, when we deeply
examined the diversity of Athila elements, we detected
that the analysis of pol-derived sequences may offer at
most a partial view of the patterns of evolution of these
elements. We found that many Athila elements are characterized by either of two alternative structures, typical of
non-autonomous retrotransposons: 1) LTRs plus a single
ORF encoding Gag proteins, or, 2) LTRs plus two ORFs,
encoding Gag and Env proteins. We also found that all
potentially autonomous Athilas, those with pol sequences
(including RTs), also have gag sequences, although they
may or may not have env sequences.

These results led us to the idea of reassessing Athila evolution from the point of view of their gag sequences. We reasoned that gag sequences, common to all types of both
complete and non-autonomous elements, would provide
the most precise picture of the evolutionary history of
Athila retrotransposons. We thus built phylogenetic trees
based on Athila gag sequences. We must note here that in
a previous study, based on RT sequences, Athila and the
closest relative of Athila, the env-lacking retrotransposon
that we named Little Athila [18] were confounded [20].
However, the recent addition of many novel sequences
allowed us to confirm that Athila and Little Athila elements are not only often structurally different (Athilas
often contain env sequences, while Little Athilas always
lack env), but also possess very different sequences and
thus are better defined as two different elements. Particularly, we found that they appear as two separate lineages
not only in Arabidopsis, but also in species of the Brassica
genus. This result demonstrates that Athila and Little
Athila split at least 15–20 millions of years ago (our
results are summarized in [22]). This result was also found
by Zhang and Wessler [23] in their general comparison of
the elements present in Arabidopsis and Brassica. Those
authors also considered Athila and Little Athila as two different elements. Thus, all the subsequent results shown
here refer solely to Athila elements, as defined by Marín
and Lloréns [18] and Zhang and Wessler [23].
Neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony phylogenetic
trees based on gag sequences confirmed that Athila is a
complex ensemble, formed by highly differentiated families. Twelve monophyletic, divergent Athila families
became apparent in those trees (Figure 1; data for the elements can be found in [Additional file 1]). One of them
("Family 0" in Figure 1) included only highly defective
copies and was not further analyzed. Table 1 contains the

description of canonical copies for the other 11 families.
Apart from the gag sequences of different families being
very different, further demonstration for the high degree
of diversification among Athila lineages was provided by
the fact that LTRs of elements of different families were in
general highly divergent and only partially alignable. We
obtained estimates for the time when families diverged in
the only two cases in which the full sequences of their
LTRs could be compared (see Methods). Thus, families
IVa and IVb were estimated to split about 2.7 millions of
years ago, while families IIIa and IIIb diverged about 3.0
millions of years ago. These results agree well with the
upper estimates for the time of insertion within a family,
again according to LTR divergence, which reaches 2.4 millions of years (Table 1). If we now extrapolate from the
data shown in Figure 1, assuming that divergence in gag
sequences is roughly proportional to divergence time, an
age of 6 to 10 millions of years for the most ancient splits
among Athila families can be estimated. Thus, we can conclude that Athila families, as defined according to gag
sequences, are ancient evolutionary lineages. An upper
limit of less than 15–20 millions of years can be deduced
from the fact that these eleven Arabidopsis families appear
as a monophyletic group separated from all Brassica Athilas (data not shown).
Most significantly, only four of the eleven gag-defined
families (I, IIIb, IVb and VII) contained elements with pol
sequences (see Table 1). These results suggest that most
Athila elements, in fact complete families, are non-autonomous, and that they propagate by using the enzymatic
machinery provided by elements of other families. Comparative analyses of LTRs demonstrated that non-autonomous families have been multiplying in the genome for
periods of time of up to 2 millions of years (Table 1).
Obviously, these results also show that all accounts of

Athila element evolution published so far, based on RT
sequences, offered a very incomplete view of the evolutionary dynamics of this complex ensemble of retroelements.
Activity of Athila retrotransposons
If we assume that the available sequences correctly represent the diversity of the Athila elements present in Arabidopsis thaliana, we may infer the degree of activity of the
different families of elements by their number of active
copies. Significantly, most Athila sequences are non functional. Out of the almost 200 sequences of Athila elements analyzed, we detected only 10 potentially active
elements, which contained ORFs without any frameshifts
or stop codons. These elements also contain all characteristic conserved amino acids of Athila Gag proteins and,
those that contain pol sequences, also contain the typical
motifs of the active centers of reverse transcriptases and
integrases. The 10 elements belonged to seven different
families, as follows: 1 element from family II, 1 element
from family IVb, 2 elements from family IVc, 1 element
from family Va, 1 element from family Vb, 3 elements
from family VI and 1 element from family VII codons (see
arrows in Figure 1). Interestingly, no element in four of
those families (II, IVc, Va and VI) has pol sequences, they
just contain gag or gag + env sequences. Thus, only three
copies among all Athila elements found so far are potentially autonomous, pol-containing copies. Two of them are
from family IVb – corresponding to the "Athila4" element
already characterized as potentially autonomous by Marín
and Lloréns [18] and Wright and Voytas [20] – and family
VII, respectively. These two families contain other elements with pol sequences, albeit defective. The third one
belongs, according to its gag sequence, to family Vb, but,
surprisingly, all but two elements in this family lack pol

sequences. These peculiar elements, named Va-rec in Figure 1, will be discussed in detail in the next section.

Athila cDNAs were found in the NCBI EST database and
121 of them could be unambiguously assigned to one of
the defined Athila families (Table 2). Of them, just 48
ESTs could be assigned to pol-containing elements. However, none of them derived from the pol gene of those elements. Moreover, only 2 ESTs derived from one of the
potentially active elements described above (the one in
sequence AL163975; family IVc). If we consider that finding ESTs does not necessarily mean that these elements
can transpose, that most of these ESTs derive from experimental conditions in which Athilas are known to be derepressed (see review by [24]) and that the NCBI database
currently contains 1.3 millions of ESTs (an average of
more than 40 per gene), it is clear that the level of Athila
transcription and in general its ability to replicate must
indeed be very limited.

LTR comparative analyses showed that the youngest elements in three of the families without potentially active
copies, IIIa, IIIb and IVa, retrotransposed 0.8, 1.8 and 1.0
millions of years ago respectively (Table 1). This result
may imply that these families are currently extinct. However, the presence of active Athila elements of these families in other Arabidopsis genomes cannot be excluded. For
the fourth family without active copies (family I), a very
recent insertion (estimated to have occurred 0.07 ± 0.03
millions of years ago; Table 1) was detected, suggesting
that this family is still active. On the other hand, the most
recent copies of the families with potentially active elements are in general quite young (average: 0.28 ± 0.09
millions of years) suggesting that most or perhaps all of
them are still currently replicating.

Recombination among elements of distantly related
families
As just detailed, one of the potentially active elements
(Va-rec) contained a gag sequence that was included in
family Vb in our phylogenetic tree (Acc. No. AB073163;
Figure 1). However, closer inspection of this particular
copy demonstrated that it was not a typical Vb element.
We found that, while no element in family Vb has env
sequences (Table 1), the Va-rec element contained an env

The low number of potentially active copies and of
recently inserted retrotransposons suggest that Athila elements, at least in the strains from which the examined
sequences were derived, have in general a very low level of
activity. We specifically searched for Athila cDNAs in
order to obtain further evidence for the level of activity of
these elements. A total of 169 ESTs corresponding to

sequence very similar to those found in family Va. In addition and as already indicated above, Va-rec and another
very similar but defective element (Acc. No. AB046433;
Figure 1), were the only two elements having Vb-like gag
sequences but containing also pol sequences. We noticed
that these pol sequences were actually very similar to those
found in family VII elements. These strange results, suggestive of a recombination process, led us to consider in
more detail the relationships among gag, pol and env
sequences for the whole set of Athila retrotransposons
(see Figures 2, 3 and [Additional files 2, 3] for the details
of the RT and env sequences).
When trees generated with the gag (Figure 1), RT (polderived; Figure 2 and see [Additional file 2] for details)
and env sequences (Figure 3 and [Additional file 3]) were
compared, it was found that they were often congruent
(Figures 4A, 4B). However, we observed several significant
differences (outlined also in Figures 4A and 4B). They
could only be explained by four independent recombination events among elements of distant families. Comparisons among LTRs and coding sequences allowed us to
determine the evolutionary histories for those events:
1) Origin of Va-rec elements: We were able to determine
that although these elements appeared in the gag-based
phylogenetic trees as members of the Vb family, this was
an artifact caused by them having a gag sequence of mixed
origin. They emerged by the acquisition by an element of
family Va of part of the gag gene and a complete pol gene
derived from a family VII element (Figure 5A). Va-rec is
therefore an element of recombinant origin, generated
from a non-autonomous progenitor of the Va family that
lacked pol. As we already mentioned, a second Va-rec element, but with stop codons and frameshifts was also
detected. This finding demonstrates that Va-rec elements
have been active after the recombination process that originated them. The only apparently active Va-rec element
found has a relatively recent origin, becoming inserted
0.27 ± 0.07 millions of years ago.
2) Acquisition by a family IIIb element of env sequences
originated from a family Va element. This event explains
the shift in the position of family IIIb elements in the gagand env-based trees (Figures 4A, 5B).
3) Recombination between elements of the IVc and VII
families, to give rise to family VI. Family VI elements have
LTRs and part of the gag sequences that are extremely similar to family VII elements, while the rest of the gag and
the env sequences are very similar to those in family IVc
(Figure 5C)
4) Acquisition of some family IIIa elements of an env of
uncertain origin, generating an additional branch of ele-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/219

ments in the env-based tree, that we named IIIa-rec (Figure
5D).
In summary, these results demonstrate that recombination between elements of different families has occurred
frequently in the past: at least 4 of the 13 lineages
observed in this study (i. e. the 11 families described in
Table 1 plus the IIIa-rec and Va-rec lineages, which cannot
be detected in gag-based trees), are of recombinant origin.
This is probably an understimate, because ancient recombination events or those involving short sequences would
remain undetected with our methods. In any case, recombination has been so frequent that none of the phylogenetic trees obtained properly reflected the diversity of
Athila retrotransposons. Only tree comparisons allowed
us to understand the evolution of these elements.
Selective pressures acting on Athila retroelements
The fact that 70% of the potentially active copies encode
for Gag or Env proteins but not for Pol proteins raises the
question of whether the pol-less elements are simply parasites of the pol-containing copies or, alternatively, they
may be contributing to their own propagation or to the
propagation of other Athila elements. This contribution
would require the production of active Gag or Env proteins by the non-autonomous elements. Of course, to conclude that these elements may contribute functional
proteins is not enough to find out that the non-autonomous copies contain potentially coding ORFs or finding
ESTs derived from these elements. Even then, all they
could be propagating strictly in a parasitic way, i. e.
depending solely on proteins provided in trans by other
elements with their own genes being non-functional or
fully repressed.

The question of whether particular elements contain functionally relevant sequences can be tackled by considering
the selective pressures acting on them. Particularly, if they
are functionally irrelevant, we would expect the coding
regions of non-autonomous copies to evolve at a neutral
rate. If, on the other hand, we find that evolution in certain coding regions of non-autonomous copies are under
negative, purifying selection, then this would be a strong
evidence for them being functionally significant. However, a problem that arises in this type of studies is the
potential confusion caused by the past effects of negative
selection. Imagine that, after an element replicates, there
follows a period of time in which the coding sequences of
both copies remain active. In that period, selection on
their coding regions would generate an accumulation of
changes in permissive positions (e. g. third positions of
codons) respect to more constrained positions. If later one
of these copies becomes inactive, and starts evolving neutrally, changes will accumulate at random. However, if,
after some time, we compare both sequences, we may still

find evidence for negative selection, due to the imprint of
pass negative selection being still detectable. To avoid this
problem, we followed the strategy of comparing the ORFs
of potentially active Athila elements only with copies that
were very closely related. More precisely, we analyzed trios
of sequences, consisting on the sequence that we want to
analyze, one of its closest relatives and a third, more distant relative. With these trios, for which phylogenetic relationships are obvious, we performed codon-based
analyses of the relevant ORFs to establish the specific rates
of non-synonymous vs. synonymous changes (ω) for the
different branches (see details in Methods). All the relevant results are shown in Table 3 and the whole set of
analyses is detailed in [Additional file 4]. The summary of
these results is very simple: in all cases, the best model
implies strong negative selection on the branch that corresponds to the elements with potentially active ORFs

(branch "z" in the schematic tree shown at the top of
Table 3). These results strongly reinforce the idea that
these ORFs indeed encode functional proteins, which may
contribute to either the replication of the copies that carry
them or of other elements in trans.

Discussion
We may now recapitulate the observations described in
the previous chapter. First, we have shown that Athila is
composed by at least 11 different families, defined as
monophyletic groups of closely related elements (Figure
1). Most of these families emerged in the distant past. We
dated the splits between families as having occurred at
least 2.7 millions of years ago. Even considering all types
of elements, autonomous or not, Athilas are not present
in large numbers. Our results agree very well with a previous estimation of about 200 structurally intact copies of

Athila per genome [25]. There are no predominant families, so the number of elements for each family is low,
ranging from 3 to 31 in our dataset and with an average of
13.2 ± 2.8 (see also Figure 1). Finally, there are only 3
potentially autonomous, active copies in the whole dataset. All these results, together with the low number of ESTs
found, suggest that Athila activity is very low. If our results
can be extrapolated to other Arabidopsis genomes, we can
conclude that Athila as a whole is not a particularly succesful parasite, i. e. it survives at low numbers, and that
individual Athila families are at the verge of extinction, at
least in individual genomes (although perhaps they are
doing fine in the whole species).
Our second main result is that we have shown that families that contain very similar elements without pol
sequences have been replicating in the Arabidopsis genome
for more than 2 millions of years. These elements are characterized by containing gag or gag + env sequences and several copies have kept apparently intact ORFs with coding
potential and which are under a purifying selection
regime. Thus, the proteins derived from elements of these
families may be contributing to its own replication or to
the replication of other Athila elements. Finally, the third

main result is that recombination between elements of
distantly related families is relatively frequent.
These results are quite different from those observed for
most other LTR retrotransposons. For example, in the
thoroughly analyzed Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster genomes, most LTR
retrotransposons are active, and there are no descriptions
of abundant non-autonomous copies with coding potential [9,10,26]. Recombination between elements of different families of LTR retrotransposons (Ty1 and Ty2)
leading to the generation of a new lineage (Ty1/Ty2) was
first observed in S. cerevisiae [27,28]. However, differently
for what we have found for recombinant Athilas, all Ty1/
Ty2 recombinant copies are recent [29] so their long-term
evolutionary potential is unclear. Similar cases, in which
new lineages of active elements are produced by recombination, have been described in other species [30,31].
Finally, a case in which a novel non-autonomous element
that retains coding potential has emerged by recombination has been described in Hordeum [32,33], but, again,
this element is very young and therefore their ability to
propagate for long periods of time is unknown. Significantly, recombination leading to ORFs encoding for
"hybrid" proteins of mixed origin, as occurred in Athila

families Va-rec and VI (Figures 5A, 5C) was not found in
any of these cases.
We may now ask what are the evolutionary processes that
explains the particular pattern of evolution observed for
Athila elements. First, we may consider whether our
results are compatible with the hypothesis of full evolutionary independence of Athila families. To consider fully
independent those families for which we have found only
non-autonomous copies, we ought to hypothesize that
hitherto undiscovered autonomous copies exist for those
lineages. This is formally possible but very unlikely. These
copies should be promoting the expansion of highly similar, structurally identical defective copies for periods of
millions of years while not leaving any detectable pol-containing remnant in the genome. The best argument
against this happening is that such peculiar pattern is
never observed for the families that do have pol sequences.
That is, although many copies in families with pol-containing elements are defective – having accumulated stop
codons and frameshifts –, we never observed pol-less elements within those families. We may thus reason that, if
in families for which pol-containing elements are known,
we never detect a set of related pol-less elements, it is
highly unlikely that precisely in those families for which
we have not detected pol-containing elements, they actually exist. Therefore, the simplest explanation for the
observed pattern is that pol-less elements are mobilized, at
least in part, in trans, by enzymes provided by elements
that belong to different, pol-containing, families.
We may then ask whether this is just another case of parasitism in which non-autonomous copies use the enzymatic machinery of the active ones without providing any
compensation or, alternatively, some kind of cooperation
between autonomous and non-autonomous elements
might exist. There are two ways in which such cooperation
may arise. First, non-autonomous elements with coding
potential could contribute to the replication of autonomous copies. To demonstrate this process would require
direct biochemical analyses, which is beyond the scope of
this work. Our data show however that two necessary conditions for the process to occur are present: 1) there are
non-autonomous elements with coding potential, with
proteins which are under negative selective pressures; and,
2) the products of distant Athilas are biochemically compatible, as it is demonstrated by the emergence, by recombination, of new families with genes of different origin.
The second way in which cooperation might arise is indirect: generation of coding, non-autonomous copies could
be advantageous for the long-term survival of Athila elements as a whole, if the non-autonomous copies occassionally contribute to the generation of novel successful
families. Our results demonstrate that this type of event

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/219

has occurred. We have shown that Athila autonomous
and non-autonomous families are linked by recombination events and that several successful recombinant Athila
lineages, defined as lineages able to replicate and survive
for long periods of time, have arisen. They are of three different types: 1) novel autonomous lineages such as the Varec elements; 2) non-autonomous recombinant lineages
that have survived while one or perhaps both progenitor
families have become extinct, as seems to be the case for
the family that provided the env sequences now found in
IIIa-rec elements (Figure 5D); or, 3) simply recombinant
non-autonomous lineages that are able to propagate in
the genome as efficiently as autonomous ones (e. g. family VI, which has been replicating for at least two millions
of years). Among all these results, it is most interesting
that we may have detected the birth of a new evolutionary
entity: if env sequences indeed provide Athila elements
with the possibility of becoming infective, Va-rec elements would be an example of how recombination
between an autonomous retrotransposon (env-less, from
family VII) and a non-autonomous element (pol-less,
from family Va) generates a novel active retrovirus (with
gag, pol and env; Figure 5A). In any case, these events demonstrate that non-autonomous copies are not strictly parasitic. They are contributing to the long-term survival of
Athila elements in Arabidopsis.

Conclusion
In summary, our results suggest that distant Athila families may be cooperating to survive in the Arabidopsis
genome. Cooperation among other type of mobile elements, bacterial IS elements, has recently received attention, with the conclusion that it may appear under precise
selective regimes [34]. Recent models also suggest situations in which mutualism may occur [35]. In fact, we
think that the accepted view that all elements behave
strictly selfishly may be due to the great difficulties
involved in discovering patterns of sequence evolution
compatible with cooperative processes. It is possible that
other mobile elements follow dynamics similar to the one
we have just described. For example, evidence for a related
pattern of interchange to generate novel lineages is also
available for human endogenous retroviruses ([36,37];
see also discussion in [38]). Therefore, this may be the
first formal description of a widely-used survival strategy
for eukaryotic mobile elements.

Methods
Data mining and phylogenetic analyses
We built databases of Gag, reverse transcriptase and Env
proteins using BlastP and TblastN searches against the
databases available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). We used as queries multiple representative Athila elements until the searches become
saturated. After each search, we aligned the sequences

obtained and removed duplicates and partial sequences.
All alignments were performed with ClustalX 1.83 [39]
using default parameters. Alignments were manually corrected when necessary with GeneDoc 2.6 [40]. We used
two methods of phylogenetic inference, neighbor-joining
and maximum parsimony, implemented in MEGA2 [41]
following the methods described in [42]. For both methods, statistical support for the branches was assessed performing 1000 bootstrap replicates.

Structural analyses
To determine the structure of Athila elements, we first
used Blast2sequences searches [43], comparing each element with known gag, RT, integrase and env Athila
sequences. ORFs were detected with ORF finder [44]. LTR
locations were determined by looking for similarity
within an element, also with Blast2sequences.

Estimation of the insertion time or divergence time
between elements
We estimated the insertion time for an element or the
divergence time for elements of two different families following the strategy described by San Miguel et al. [45]. The
nucleotide sequences of either both LTRs of each element
or single LTRs of two different elements were aligned and
the Kimura two-parameter distance [46] was estimated
using MEGA2. The distance obtained was then divided by
two (because it refers to changes accumulated in both
LTRs) and then again divided by the substitution rate at
synonymous sites estimated for the brassicaceae Chs and
Adh genes [47], that is, 1.5 10-8 per site per year.

Characterization of recombination events
Recombination events were deduced from incongruent
phylogenetic positions of two proteins of a same element
or group of elements [48]. We searched for the recombination breakpoints by analyzing pairwise alignments of
amino acidic sequences and also, at the nucleotide level,
following a sliding-window approach implemented in
SimPlot [49], which utilizes the DNAPARS and NEIGHBOR programs of the Phylip package [50].

Estimations fo synonymous and nonsynonymous
nucleotide substitutions
The rate of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution were estimated using the PAML3.1 package [51], following the strategy of branch-dependent analyses
described previously in [52]. Three models were analyzed.
M0 refers to a model in which all branches are assumed to
have the same rate. M1 is a model in which all branches
are assumed to evolve at different rates. Finally, M2 is a
model in which the branch that leads to the active element ("z" in Table 2) is assumed to evolve at a different
rate than the rest.
