Abstract
Background: Thermophilic Bacillus strains of phylogenetic Bacillus rRNA group 5 were described
as a new genus Geobacillus. Their geographical distribution included oilfields, hay compost,
hydrothermal vent or soils. The members from the genus Geobacillus have a growth temperatures
ranging from 35 to 78°C and contained iso-branched saturated fatty acids (iso-15:0, iso-16:0 and
iso-17:0) as the major fatty acids. The members of Geobacillus have similarity in their 16S rRNA gene
sequences (96.5–99.2%). Thermophiles harboring intrinsically stable enzymes are suitable for
industrial applications. The quest for intrinsically thermostable lipases from thermophiles is a
prominent task due to the laborious processes via genetic modification.
Results: Twenty-nine putative lipase producers were screened and isolated from palm oil mill
effluent in Malaysia. Of these, isolate T1T was chosen for further study as relatively higher lipase
activity was detected quantitatively. The crude T1 lipase showed high optimum temperature of
70°C and was also stable up to 60°C without significant loss of crude enzyme activity. Strain T1T
was a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore forming bacterium. On the basic of 16S rDNA
analysis, strain T1T was shown to belong to the Bacillus rRNA group 5 related to Geobacillus
thermoleovorans (DSM 5366T) and Geobacillus kaustophilus (DSM 7263T). Chemotaxonomic data of
cellular fatty acids supported the affiliation of strain T1T to the genus Geobacillus. The results of
physiological and biochemical tests, DNA/DNA hybridization, RiboPrint analysis, the length of
lipase gene and protein pattern allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain T1T from
its validly published closest phylogenetic neighbors. Strain T1T therefore represents a novel species,
for which the name Geobacillus zalihae sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain T1T (=DSM 18318T;
NBRC 101842T).
Conclusion: Strain T1T was able to secrete extracellular thermostable lipase into culture medium.
The strain T1T was identified as Geobacillus zalihae T1T as it differs from its type strains Geobacillus
kaustophilus (DSM 7263T) and Geobacillus thermoleovorans (DSM 5366T) on some physiological
studies, cellular fatty acids composition, RiboPrint analysis, length of lipase gene and protein profile.

Background

Results and discussion

The Bacillus rRNA group 5 which comprised thermophilic
Bacillus strains was transferred into new genus Geobacillus
which represented a phenotypically and phylogenetically
coherent group of thermophilic bacilli with high levels of
16S rRNA sequence similarity (96.5–99.2%) [1]. The
members of this genus are widespread in various thermophilic and mesophilic geographic areas on the earth
such as oilfields, hay compost, hydrothermal vent or soils
[1-5]. At present, the members of this genus included Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Geobacillus thermocatenulatus,
Geobacillus thermoleovorans, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius, Geobacillus thermodenitrificans,
Geobacillus subterraneus, Geobacillus uzenensis, Geobacillus
caldoxylosilyticus, Geobacillus toebii, Geobacillus vulcani, Geobacillus lituanicus, Geobacillus tepidamans, Geobacillus gargensis, Geobacillus jurassicus, Geobacillus caldoproteolyticus,
Geobacillus pallidus and Geobacillus debilis with growth temperatures ranging from 35 to 78°C [1,4-19].

Screening and isolation of thermophilic lipolytic bacteria
Rubbish dump sites and palm oil mill effluent are potential sites containing thermophilic lipolytic bacteria
because these sites served as sewage discharge areas for
household waste and palm oil factory. The oily environment may provide a good environment for lipolytic
microorganisms to flourish. Samples were collected from
the rubbish dump site and palm oil mill effluent at different treatment areas. Samples were enriched with enrichment medium (EM-1) containing olive oil as the sole
carbon source at 60°C for 2 days under shaking condition
to promote the growth of thermophilic lipolytic bacteria.
Twenty nine putative lipase producers gave positive
results on triolein agar plate by forming an intense blue
color around the colonies (Table 1). Of these, 23 and 6
isolates were isolated from rubbish dump site and palm
oil mill, respectively. Further confirmation test was performed quantitatively on the 29 putative lipase producers
that gave positive results on triolein agar plates. Various
basal media M1, M3, TYEM and BM-1 were tested for
lipase production during the selection. Low lipase activities ranging from 0 ~ 0.044 U/ml were detected colorimetrically in culture supernatant, except for isolate T1T, which
showed high lipase activity (0.150 U/ml) after 24 h incubation (Table 1).

Recently, microorganisms such as Bacillus sp. RSJ-1 [20],
Bacillus thermoleovorans ID-1 [21], Bacillus sp. THL027
[22], Bacillus sp. strain A30-1 [23], Bacillus sp. strain 398
[24], Bacillus thermocatenulatus [25], Bacillus spp. [26-30]
were reported as thermostable lipase producers. As thermophilic bacterial strains have an optimum growth temperature of 65–70°C, lipases isolated from such strains
are good candidates for lipid modifications [31].
The stability of biocatalysts is an important criterion when
dealing with bioprocesses at high temperature for sustainable operation. Enzyme stability is dictated by its threedimensional configuration, which in turn is determined
by genetic and environmental factors [32]. Therefore,
thermophiles are promising sources of heat-stable
enzymes. In addition to higher thermostability, proteins
from thermophiles often showed higher stability toward
organic solvents and higher activity at elevated temperature [33]. In addition, genetic engineering in altering the
stability of enzymes is a difficult task and laborious processes. Therefore, efforts have been focused on the screening of microorganisms harboring intrinsically stable
biocatalysts. Putative lipase producers were screened
quantitatively across various basal media to check for
lipase production and the stability of lipase. The highest
lipase producing strain have been identified and characterized intensively. Screening and isolation of heat-stable
lipase producers are important to fulfill industrial requirements for the desired characteristics. Identification of
industrially important enzyme producer is conducted to
determine its phylogenetic position in systematic microbiology.

On the basis of relatively higher lipase activity detected for
isolate T1T, the effect of temperature on the activity and
stability of crude T1 lipase was further investigated. The
effect of temperature on the lipase activity and stability
was examined from 40 to 80°C. As shown in Fig. 1, the
crude enzyme from isolate T1T manifested its maximal
activity at 70°C with olive oil as substrate. Crude T1 lipase
was fairly stable up to 60°C for 30 min and gradually
decreased upon prolonged temperature treatment. This is
due to T1 lipase tended to lose its native conformation as
a result of breaking of the intrinsic interaction above its
stable range. This is a discrepancy between temperature
activity (70°C) and stability (60°C), as the enzyme is tend
to be protected by heat denaturation in the presence of
olive oil. In addition, the enzyme thermostability is
greatly influenced by the presence of water, because denaturation is linked to its conformational mobility in aqueous mixture [34]. The crude enzyme of isolate T1T was
fairly active at higher temperature as compared to other
thermostable lipases from Bacillus spp. [26,30,33] which
exhibited maximal activity at 60°C. High temperature
activity and stability of enzyme offer great potentials in
industrial applications, and hence attempts have been
made to identify isolate T1T.
Identification of isolate T1T
During the characterization of organism isolated from
palm oil mill effluent, strain T1T was recovered on nutri-

ent broth at 60°C. The growth condition for strain T1T was
50–70°C and between pH 5 and 9 with the optimum
growth temperature and pH of 65°C and pH 6.5, respectively, in nutrient broth. These met the criteria of thermophilic bacteria, which grew at temperatures above
50°C [35]. To verify the systematic position of this bacterium, a study of morphological and physiological characteristics, 16S rRNA analysis, cellular fatty acids analysis,
DNA composition, DNA/DNA hybridization, RiboPrint
analysis, lipase gene analysis and protein profile were
undertaken.
The cellular morphology of isolate T1T is rod-shaped, 0.8–
1.0 μm width and 2.5–6.0 μm length, gram positive bac-

teria. The terminal spore is oval/cylindrical in shape and
swollen the sporangium. The DNA base composition of
strain T1T is around 52.6% mol G + C. The partial
sequencing of the 16S rDNA shows 99.5% similarity to
validly described Geobacillus kaustophilus (DSM 7263T)
and Geobacillus thermoleovorans (DSM 5366T). The 16S
rRNA sequence of strain T1T is a continuous stretch of
1519 bp (AY166603). Construction of phylogenetic trees
using the neighbour-joining method in determining the
evolutionary relationship among a group of validly
described closely related species is indicated in Fig. 2. A
comparison of biochemical, morphological and physiological properties of strain T1T with its closest phylogenetic neighbors is presented in Table 2. Strain T1T can be
distinguished from Geobacillus thermoleovorans (DSM
5366T) phenotypically by oxidase test, arabinose, mannitol, inositol, lactose and casein hydrolysis. However,
strain T1T differs from Geobacillus kaustophilus (DSM
7263T) by lysozyme test, arabinose, mannitol, ribose,
adonitol, lactose, gelatin and casein tests. Since the
sequencing result and physiological data did not allow
strain T1T to be identified with one of the above mentioned species, further analysis need to be carried out to
verify its phylogenetic position.
Result of chemotaxonomic analyses is given in the species
description. The fatty acid profile of strain T1T is typical for
the Bacillus rRNA-group 5 (thermophilic Bacillus strains).

Taxa 1, G. zalihae T1T; 2, G. Kaustophilus (DSM 7263T); 3, G.
thermoleovorans (DSM 5366T). Characteristics are scored as: +,
positive; -, negative; w, weak; v, variable within the group; ND, not
determined. Data were obtained from the present study (G. zalihae
strain T1T), Nazina et al. [16], Sunna et al. [3], Kuisiene et al. [14] and
Markossian et al. [54] (G. thermoleovorans DSM 5366T and G.
Kaustophilus DSM 7263T). All strains were negative for anaerobic
growth, growth at 30°C, VP reaction, indole production and acid from
L-rhamnose, sorbitol. All strains were positive for catalase, hydrolysis
of starch, use of citrate and acid from D-fructose and D-glucose.

The major content of cellular fatty acids of strain T1T is isofatty acids. Among them, iso-branched pentadecanoic
acid (iso-C15), hexadecanoic acid (iso-C16) and heptadecanoic acid (iso-C17) making up 78.33% of the total fatty
acids for strain T1T. Strain T1T can be differentiated from
Geobacillus thermoleovorans DSM 5366T based on percent
composition of iso-fatty acids (iso-C15, iso-C16 and isoC17 making up 62.1%). There was only 6.14% of iso-C16
for strain T1T but 21% for Geobacillus thermoleovorans DSM
5366T (Table 3).
Although FAME is not always a reliable tool for preliminary identification of bacilli, it could be used in combination with other identification methods [36]. DNA/DNA
hybridization experiments were performed in DSMZ
(Germany) with strain T1T and its type strains of closest
phylogenetical neighbors. The genomic DNA/DNA relat-

edness between strain T1T and its type strains Geobacillus
kaustophilus (DSM7263T) Geobacillus thermoleovorans
(DSM 5366T) were 73.6% and 68.2%, respectively.
Whereas, the type strains Geobacillus kaustophilus (DSM
7263T) and Geobacillus thermoleovorans (DSM 5366T)
showed a DNA/DNA similarity of 71.8%. The DNA/DNA
reassociation values were below the threshold value of
70% DNA/DNA similarity for definition of species [37]
between strain T1T and Geobacillus thermoleovorans DSM
5366T but above the threshold between strain T1T and
Geobacillus kaustophilus DSM 7263T. Neither the species
Geobacillus kaustophilus DSM 7263T and Geobacillus thermoleovorans DSM 5366T can be differentiated from one
another nor strain T1T can be differentiated at the species
level from its closest phylogenetic neighbors by DNA/
DNA hybridization. However, DNA/DNA hybridization
tests between Geobacillus kaustophilus DSM 7263T and Geobacillus thermoleovorans DSM 5366T were 84% and 54% as
reported by Sunna et al. [3] and Nazina et al. [13]. This disagreement may be due to the absence of adequate hybridization controls in the experiments. Therefore, further
tests need to be carried out to accurately place the strain
T1T phylogenetically.
The RiboPrint analysis was carried out for the decision on
the affiliation of strain T1T. However, the RiboPrint pattern of strain T1T was not identified by the Dupont identification library to give rise to the identification at the
species level (>0.85). Its RiboPrint pattern showed the
highest similarity to Geobacillus kaustophilus DSM 7263T
(0.69). The similarity to the pattern of Geobacillus thermoleovorans DSM 5366T was somewhat lower (0.57). The patterns between type strains Geobacillus kaustophilus DSM
7263T and Geobacillus thermoleovorans DSM 5366T show a
binary similarity of 0.64.
Further analysis was also carried out by amplifying fulllength thermostable lipase gene using primers as
described in materials and methods [38]. Fig. 3 showed
amplified full-length lipase genes of strain T1T and its type
strains. The amplified lipase gene of strain T1T was around
2 kb but 1.8 kb for its type strains Geobacillus kaustophilus
DSM 7263T and Geobacillus thermoleovorans DSM 5366T. A
stretch of about 220 bp insertion could be seen at downstream of the open reading frame of thermostable lipase
gene (Fig. 4). In addition, the intracellular protein profiles
were determined by SDS-PAGE. Samples (30 μg) were
separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained
using Coomassie blue. Strain T1T showed obvious different protein profile as compared to its type strains at region
between 34 to 47 kDa (Fig. 5).

Conclusion
As a consequence, the strain T1T merits recognition as a
member of a novel species through morphological and
physiological studies, cellular fatty acids composition,
DNA composition, DNA/DNA hybridization, RiboPrint
analysis. Sizes of full-length lipase genes and protein profiles were additional evidences. The Geobacillus zalihae
strain T1T was deposited in DSMZ (DSM 18318T) and
NITE (NBRC 101842T).

Methods
Bacterial isolation
Numerous enrichment cultures that were derived from
samples of rubbish dump site and palm oil mill effluent
were screened for their ability to degrade olive oil. The
strain described here was isolated from a sample from
palm oil mill effluent in Semenyih, Malaysia. Samples
(5%) were inoculated into enrichment medium (EM1)
with olive oil as the sole carbon source and incubated at
60°C under shaking condition (150 rpm) for 2 days at an
initial pH 7.0. The composition of EM1 is as follows: olive
oil 2%; NaCl 0.2%; MgSO4.7H2O 0.04%; MgCl2.6H2O
0.07%; CaCl2.2H2O 0.05%; KH2PO4 0.03%; K2HPO4
0.03%; (NH4)2SO4 0.05% [21], to which 0.01% of trace
elements solution containing 0.026% B, 0.05% Cu,
0.05% Mn, 0.006% Mo and 0.07% Zn were added [27].
The enriched cultures were further screened by using triolein agar plate. Triolein agar comprising of triolein
(0.25%), bacteriological agar (1%), nutrient broth (0.8%)
and Victoria Blue (0.01%) was adjusted to pH 7.0. The

medium was homogenized for 5 minutes before sterilization. The sterilized triolein agar was poured into petri
dishes. Isolates that showed positive results on the triolein
agar were then tested for their lipase production in basal
media.
Selection of thermostable lipase producer
Lipase production was determined aerobically at 60°C in
500 ml blue cap bottle containing 100 ml basal medium.
The composition of basal mineral media used in this
study was (g/L): BM1 (NaNO3: 7; K2HPO4: 2; KH2PO4: 1;
KCl: 0.1; MgSO4.7H2O: 0.5; CaCl2: 0.01; FeSO4.7H2O:
0.012; yeast extract: 1 in which 0.01% trace elements and
2% olive oil were supplemented) [39]; M1 (peptone: 3;
yeast extract: 1; NaCl: 0.5 in which 1% olive oil was supplemented) [30]; M3 (nutrient broth: 0.325; gum Arabic:
1; CaCl2.2H2O: 0.05; Tween.80: 1 in which 1% olive oil
was supplemented) [40] and TYEM (tryptone: 6; yeast
extract: 2; CaCl2.2H2O: 0.2; MgSO4.7H2O: 0.1;
FeCl3.6H2O: 0.4 in which 1.5% olive oil was supplemented) [21]. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 and the
medium was sterilized for 15 min at 121°C. Bacterial
inoculum (3 ml) was then inoculated into 100 ml basal
medium and incubated by shaking at 150 rpm, 60°C. The
cell free supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 10,
000 rpm, 4°C for 10 min prior to lipase assay.
Lipase assay
The lipase activity was assayed by colorimetry [41]. Culture filtrate (1 ml) was shaken with 2.5 ml of olive oil
(70% oleate residues) emulsion (1:1, v/v) and 20 μl of
0.02 M CaCl2 in a water bath shaker at an agitation rate of
200 rpm. The emulsion was prepared by mixing together
an equal volume of olive oil (Bertoli, Italy) and 50 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with a magnetic stirrer for 10
min. The reaction mixture was shaken for 30 min at 50°C.
The enzyme reaction in the emulsion system was stopped
by adding 6 M HCl (1 ml) and isooctane (5 ml), followed
by mixing using a vortex mixer for 30 s. The upper isooctane layer (4 ml) containing the fatty acid was transferred
to a test tube for analysis. Copper reagent (1 ml) was
added and again mixed with a vortex mixer for 30 s. The
reagent was prepared by adjusting the solution of 5% (w/
v) copper (II) acetate-1-hydrate to pH 6.1 with pyridine.
The absorbance of the upper layer was read at 715 nm.
Lipase activity was measured by measuring the amount of
free fatty acids released based on the standard curve of free
fatty acid. One unit of lipase activity was defined as the
amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmole of fatty acid per
minute.
Characterization of crude lipase
The effect of temperature of the crude lipase was evaluated
by assaying at temperatures ranging from 50 to 80°C.
Crude enzyme (1 ml) was shaken with 2.5 ml of olive oil

(70% oleate residues) emulsion (1:1, v/v) and 20 μl of
0.02 M CaCl2 in a water bath shaker at an agitation rate of
200 rpm. The lipase activity was measured colorimetrically. Assessment of the thermostability of crude lipase
was performed by measuring the residual activity after 30
min pre-incubation at various temperatures ranging from
50 to 80°C. The treated enzyme was immediately put in
ice-bath for 10 min before measuring the residual activity
at 50°C for 30 min.
Identification of strain T1T
A study of morphological and 16S rRNA analysis was conducted in UPM. Its physiological characteristics, cellular
fatty acids analysis, DNA composition, DNA/DNA
hybridization and RiboPrint analysis was undertaken in
Deutsche Sammlung Von Mikroorganismen (DSMZ),
Germany.
Morphological and physiological study
For the morphological study, pure bacterial strain was
streaked on nutrient agar plate and incubated for 24 h at
60°C prior to gram staining. It was then observed under a
light microscope. Morphological and physiological char-

acteristics were further determined in DSMZ (Germany).
The physiological characteristics study included catalase
and oxidase test, anaerobic growth, Voges-Proskauer test,
growth at 30, 40 and 70°C, growth in medium at pH 5.7,
2% and 5% NaCl, lysozyme broth, fermentation of D-glucose, L-arabinose, D-xylose, D-mannitol, D-fructose, Minosit, D-ribose, D-cellobiose, L-rhamnose, sorbitol, Dgalactose, adonit, D-lactose, hydrolysis of starch, gelatin,
casein and Tween 80, decomposition of tyrosine, use of
citrate and propionate, nitrate reduction, indol production, phenylalanine deaminase and arginine dihydrolase
test.
Cellular fatty acids analysis
Fatty acids were extracted and analysed following the
instructions of Sherlock microbial identification system.
The culture of Bacillus thermocatenulatus was used as control during cellular fatty acids analysis.
16S rDNA analysis
The 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR using two universal
primers: 16S-F (5'-GAG TTT GAT CCT GGC TCA G-3') and
16S-R (5'-CGG CTA CCT TGT TAC GAC TT-3'). The PCR

Downstream sequence alignment of lipase genes derived from Geobacillus zalihae T1T and its phylogenetic neighbors
Downstream sequence alignment of lipase genes derived from Geobacillus zalihae T1T and its phylogenetic neighbors. The alignment was generated using Lip7263 (G. Kaustophilus DSM 7263T), Lip5366 (G. thermoleovorans DSM 5366T), and LipT1 (G. zalihae
T1T). The C-terminal of the open reading frame coding sequences is bracket in red, and the stop codon was labeled as STOP.

product was purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit
(Qiagen, Germany). The purified PCR product was cloned
into TOPO TA PCR 2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen, USA).
The recombinant plasmid was extracted with QIAprep
plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) and was then
sequenced using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, USA) as recommended by the manufacturers. The 16S rDNA sequence of Geobacillus zalihae
T1T was analyzed using software package MEGA 3.1 [42].
DNA base composition
The chromosomal DNA was isolated and purified according to the procedure of Cashion et al. [43]. The G + C contents were determined by using chromatography
conditions adopted from Tamaoka and Komagata [44].
The DNA was hydrolysed and the resultant nucleotides
were analysed by reverse-phase HPLC [45].
DNA/DNA hybridization
DNA/DNA hybridization was carried out as described by
De Ley et al. [46], with the modifications described by
Huss et al. [47] and Escara & Hutton [48], using a model
2600 spectrophotometer equipped with a model 2527-R
thermoprogrammer and plotter (Gilford Instrument Laboratories). Renaturation rates were compared with the
TRANSFER.BAS program by Jahnke [49].

Ribotyping analysis
Standardized automated ribotyping is performed using
the QualiconTM RiboPrinter system as described by Bruce
[50]. The RiboPrinter system combines molecular
processing steps for ribotyping in a stand-alone, automated instrument. Steps included cell lysis, digestion of
chromosomal DNA with restriction enzyme EcoR1, separation of fragments by electrophoresis, transfer of DNA
fragments to a nylon membrane, hybridization to a probe
generated from the rrnB operon from E. coli, chemiluminescent detection of the probe to the fragments containing rrn operon sequences, image detection and
computerized analysis of RiboPrint patterns.
Amplification of full-length thermostable lipase gene
Genomic DNA was extracted by using conventional
method [51]. In order to amplify the full length sequence
of thermostable lipase gene, a set of primers was designed
based on the thermostable lipase gene sequence of Bacillus
thermoleovorans (AF134840), as follows: BTL-F: 5'-GGC
GGT GAT GGA ACG CTG CCA TGA-3' and BTL-R: 5'-CCG
ACG ATA GAC TGG CGG ACA AAT G-3'. Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) was carried out in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing DNA template (10–100 ng), 10
mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) (0.2 mM),
10 × PCR buffer (10.0 μl), 25 mM MgCl2 (2 mM), oligonucleotide primers: BTL-F (30 pmol) and BTL-R (30

pmol), and Taq DNA polymerase (2 U). The gene was
amplified with a thermocycler (Gene Amp PCR system
2400, Perkin Elmer, Foster, CA) with the temperature program of predenaturation at 94°C for 4 min, 30 cycles PCR
of 1 min denaturation at 94°C, 2 min annealing at 55°C
and 2 min extension at 72°C. The final extension step at
72°C was 7 min and preservation was at 4°C. The amplified products were electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gel
(w/v) with 1 kb marker as the standard marker. The PCR
products were purified and sequenced as described earlier.
The sequences alignment was generated using CLUSTALW
and TEXSHADE in Biology Workbench 3.2 [52].
Protein pattern analysis
SDS-PAGE was done on 12% running gels by using the
method of Laemmli [53]. A broad range of protein standard (MBI Fermentas, Germany) was used as a molecular
mass marker. Extracellular protein was concentrated with
5,000 MWCO cut-off vivaspin 15R (Vivascience, Germany). Protein samples (30 μg) were loaded for analysis.
