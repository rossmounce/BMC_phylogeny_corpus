Abstract
Background: Chloroquine (CQ) has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro as well as in
vivo and has been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern of the gp120 envelope. These
activities indicate that the compound can be used not only as an effective HIV-1 therapeutic agent
but also as a modulator of the gp120 envelope protein structure enabling for the production of
broader neutralizing Ab responses.
Results: We confirm here that HIV-1 replication on CD4+ T-lymphocytes can be reduced in the
presence of CQ and show that the reduced replication is producer cell mediated, with viruses
generated in the presence of CQ not being inhibited for subsequent infectivity and replication. By
analysing the gp120 envelope protein sequences from viruses cultured long-term in the absence or
presence of CQ we demonstrate variant evolution patterns. One noticeable change is the
reduction in the number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the V3 region as well as within
the 2G12 Ab binding and neutralization epitope. We also demonstrate that HIV-1 produced in the
presence of CQ has a reduced capacity for transfer by Raji-DC-SIGN cells to CD4+ T-lymphocytes,
indicating another means whereby virus transmission or replication may be reduced in vivo.
Conclusion: These results indicate that CQ should be considered as an HIV-1 therapeutic agent
with its influence exerted through a number of mechanisms in vivo, including modulation of the
gp120 structure.

Background
The anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxyl
analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have both been
shown to inhibit the in vitro replication of HIV-1 and HIV2 [1]. The cheap cost and wide-availability in resource
restricted settings make them prime candidates as antiretroviral agents, most likely to be used in conjunction with
other anti-HIV-1 medications. A previous report has indicated that CQ may mediate its effect through modulating

glycosylation patterns of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein [2]. Since HIV-1 neutralizing Ab responses can be
modulated by alterations in the potential N-linked glycosylation (PNG) sites of gp120 [3-5], CQ and HCQ may
therefore have the beneficial effect of changing the immunogenicity of the molecule and induce a broader Ab
response.

Several clinical trials have been performed where CQ or
HCQ was given to HIV-1 infected individuals. In one
study a decrease in HIV-1 viral load measurements was
observed [21] whilst in another a decrease in plasma CAp24 levels was noted in comparison to the control group
[22]. No alterations to CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts were
identified in either study. In one trial a decrease in IL-6
and immunoglobulin G levels were found, suggesting a
further means whereby HIV-1 viral loads can be modulated [22].

Results
Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by CQ
To confirm that CQ has an inhibitory effect on the in vitro
replication of HIV-1 we separately cultured an R5 (JRCSF) and X4 (LAI) virus on CD4+ T-lymphocytes and
monitored replication in the presence of variant concentrations of CQ (200, 100 and 50 μM). We observe that CQ
inhibits the replication profile of both viruses in comparison to the control cells (Fig. 1). When comparing the
dose dependent inhibitory effect of CQ on viral replication the R5 virus (Fig. 1A) appears more sensitive than the
X4 virus (Fig. 1B), suggesting a co-receptor phenotype
restriction to inhibition by CQ. The observed inhibition
by CQ was not due to enhanced cell death since cell

In order to determine whether the inhibitory effect of CQ
was mediated through altered infectivity of generated
virus particles we analyzed replication on CD4+ T-lymphocytes of HIV-1 produced in C33A cells pre-treated
with 100 μM CQ. The viruses JR-CSF (R5), 299.10 (R5/
X4) and LAI (X4) produced from cells not treated with CQ
showed higher CA-p24 levels than viruses produced from
cells treated with CQ (data not shown). When we studied
the replication kinetics of the viruses away from CQ with
a set CA-p24 viral input there was no difference in replication of the viruses generated in the presence or absence of
CQ (Fig. 2). TCID50/ml values were identical for all three
viruses generated in the presence or absence of CQ (data
not shown). These results indicate that viruses produced
in the presence of CQ are as equally infectious as those
produced in its absence and that the effect of the drug on
lowering CA-p24 production is mediated at the cellular
level.

CA-p24 (ng/ml)

Dendritic cells (DCs) have been implicated to play an
important role in the transmission of HIV-1 and the establishment of infection through capturing virus and enhancing infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes [10-12]. DC-SIGN
has been shown to specifically interact with HIV-1 and
allow for the enhancement to infection [13-15], although
an array of C-type lectins have been postulated to perform
the same function [16,17]. The interaction of HIV-1 with
DC-SIGN can lead to either infection of DCs or internalization of the virus and subsequent transfer [18,19]. The
interaction of HIV-1 and DC-SIGN is mainly dependent
on the glycosylation of gp120 and in particular the V3
region of the protein [20].

The HIV-1 inhibitory effect of CQ and HCQ is likely mediated by variant properties of the drugs. As a weak base CQ
is known to increase pH in lysosomal and trans-Golgi network vesicles [6], thereby disrupting the cellular acid
hydrolase enzymes and altering the level of post-translational modification of newly synthesized proteins and
reducing the level of gp120 glycosylation. The cellular
endosomal pH has also been shown to be increased
through CQ treatment which can lower IL-6 synthesis [7].
Down-modulation of IL-6 has been shown to diminish
HIV-1 production from chronically infected T-cells and
monocyte cell-lines [8], providing an additional HIV-1
suppressing effect. CQ has also been shown to decrease
Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR in vitro,
thereby decreasing HIV-1 production [9].

was consistently lower for the virus passaged in the presence of CQ compared to the control passsaged virus (Fig.

results demonstrate that HIV-1 does not evolve to escape
the inhibitory effects of CQ.

(R5X4) replication and C) LAI (X4) replication. All three
viruses were produced by transfection of C33A cells pretreated with 100 μM CQ or in its absence as a control. The
replication capacity of the produced viruses were determined on CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the absence of CQ. CAp24 at 1 ng/ml was used as viral input with the CA-p24 concentration determined during the course of the infection.
Standard deviations are depicted in all panels. All replications
were performed in triplicate.

Prolonged culture in the presence of CQ does not alter
replication of HIV-1
To monitor the effect of long-term culturing of HIV-1 in
the presence of CQ we passaged virus 293.10 (R5X4) for
30 weeks either in the absence or presence of CQ (100
μM). Each week, or when CA-p24 levels were sufficiently
high, a set viral load (15 ng/ml) was transferred to fresh
CD4+ T-lymphocytes and cultured. CA-p24 production

Since we have shown previously that viral replication was
not altered after HIV-1 production on C33A cells in the
presence of CQ we wished to identify whether this was the
same for the long-term cultured virus stocks. The replication profile of harvested viruses from various time-points
during the passage in the presence or absence of CQ was
determined on CD4+T-lymphocytes (Fig. 4). The replication at day 37 showed an increase in replication for the
CQ passaged virus population versus the non-CQ treated
culture (Fig. 4A). On the contrary for day 77 (Fig. 4B), day
103 (Fig. 4C), day 147 (Fig. 4D), day 183 (Fig. 4E) and
day 206 (Fig. 4F) no differences in replication between the
CQ passaged viruses and the non-CQ passaged viruses
were observed. These results indicate that there is no difference in replication of HIV-1 after long-term culture in
the presence or absence of CQ, although the virus from
the CQ treated day 37 culture showed an enhanced replication over the non-CQ treated stock. The fact that the
later viruses did not show such an increase indicates that
the result observed for the day 37 CQ passaged virus was
most likely due to experimental variation and reflects the
poor infectivity of the viruses from that time-point. However, the main finding is that CQ did not diminish the replication capacity of HIV-1. TCID50/ml values were
determined for stocks generated on days 37, 77, 103, 147,
183 and 206 during the prolonged passage in the absence
or presence of CQ. Both culture conditions demonstrated
an increased infectivity of virus over time (Fig. 4G), indicating that viruses in the presence of CQ adapt as efficiently as non-CQ treated cultures. This again reiterates
that CQ exerts a cellular restriction to viral production and
not a direct effect on viral infectivity.
Sequence analysis of the viruses passaged in the presence
of CQ
A previous study has suggested that CQ can modify the
PNG patterns of the gp120 envelope [2]. We therefore
wished to determine whether HIV-1 passaged in the presence of CQ had a similar gp120 envelope sequence to
virus passaged in the absence of CQ. DNA sequence analysis of a number of cloned PCR products of gp120 identified that the overall amino acid charge of the V1V2 region
(Fig. 5A) is significantly higher for the CQ passaged virus
compared to the control passage (P = 0.001), or the original virus (P = 0.001) (Table 1). On the contrary, the overall positive charge of the gp120 V3 region (Fig. 5B) is
significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in the CQ passaged virus
but equal to the original virus (Table 1). A significant
decrease in V4 region length (Fig. 5C) is also identified in

Prolonged passage of HIV-1 in the presence of CQ. An R5X4 virus (293.10) was cultured for 206 days in the presence
or absence of CQ (100 μM). The concentration of CA-p24 was determined in culture supernatants on either day 7 or 10 of
culture and 15 ng/ml CA-p24 was added to fresh CD4+ T-lymphocytes. The culture was monitored for CA-p24 and the culture

the CQ passaged virus in comparison to the control (P <
0.0001), or the original 293.10 virus (Table 1). Of particular interest is the observation that the PNG profile of the
V3 region (Fig. 5B) was significantly reduced after passage
of the 293.10 virus in the presence of CQ with the virus
reducing the number of PNG sites in V3 region from 2 to
0 (P < 0.0001), whilst in the non-CQ treated culture it is
reduced from 2 to 1.7 (Table 1). Overall the sequence
analysis reveals that there are differences in the envelope
sequences of viruses cultured in the presence of CQ that
may have an influence on the virus phenotype or the
immunogenic properties of gp120.
Prolonged passage of HIV-1 in the presence of CQ results
in a loss of PNG sites important for 2G12 binding
We compared the gp120 sequences of the passaged viruses
with what is known for the 2G12 binding site, a monoclonal Ab with broad neutralizing activity against HIV-1
subtype B isolates. This antibody has a known PNG component to its recognition epitope [23]. For the virus passaged in the presence of CQ we observed a loss of two
PNG sites (332 and 397) that have been shown to express
carbohydrates important for 2G12 binding [23], as well as
an additional site in the V3 region of gp120 (data not
shown). The PNG site expressing carbohydrates involved
in 2G12 binding (397) is lost in the V4 region due to a

deletion of 5 amino acids. Loss of a PNG site in the V4
region is also observed in the control passage (Table 1)
but does not involve this specific site under question since
the deletion is 7 amino acids upstream from position 397.
DC-SIGN mediated transfer of HIV-1 is decreased for both
C33A generated viruses and after prolonged culture in the
presence of CQ
Since PNG sites were altered in the CQ passaged viruses
and these events are known to be involved with HIV-1
binding to DC-SIGN [20,23] we tested the efficiency by
which the viruses were transferred by Raji-DC-SIGN cells
to CD4+ T-lymphocytes. When comparing the viruses produced on days 14, 77, 135 and 197 we observe that for
viruses produced in the absence of CQ there is a significantly higher level of DC-SIGN mediated transfer than
viruses produced in the presence of CQ (day 14, P = 0.001;
day 77, P = 0.004; day 197, P = 0.005) (Fig. 6A). These
results indicate that the alteration of the PNG sequence of
gp120 may alter its binding to DC-SIGN, or alternatively
the glycosylation machinery of the cell can influence the
interaction of the virus with DC-SIGN. To test the latter we
monitored the Raji-DC-SIGN mediated transfer to CD4+
T-lymphocytes of viruses produced on C33A cells (CQ or
non-CQ treated). All three viruses were shown to have a
reduced capacity for DC-SIGN mediated transfer when

produced in cells treated with CQ over viruses generated
in non-CQ treated cells (JR-CSF, P = 0.0009; 299.10, P =
0.002; LAI, P = 0.003) (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that
the same virus produced in the presence of CQ has a
reduced capacity for transfer by DC-SIGN expressing cells
to CD4+ T-lymphocytes.

Discussion
We demonstrate, in support of previous in vitro and in vivo
studies [1,21,22,24-27], that CQ has an inhibitory effect
on HIV-1 production. We further demonstrate that viruses
produced in C33A cells or which have been extensively
passaged through CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the presence or
absence of CQ show no difference in their infectivity profile and TCID50/ml values when cultured away from CQ,
indicating that the inhibitory effect on viral replication is
provided at the level of the producer cell. Sequence analysis of the viruses after prolonged passage in the presence
or absence of CQ demonstrates a loss of PNG sites in the
gp120 region. Previous results have shown that N-glycosylation is of importance for the pathogenisis of HIV-1 but
does not alter replication or infection of target cells [28],
which is in correspondence to our results. CQ has been
shown previously to reduce viral yield in vitro [1,25,27],
but also viral infectivity [1,27]. However, in our study we
do not observe inhibition of infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes. This may be explained by the fact that in our
experiments we compensate for the presence of CQ in the
produced virus stock, thereby eliminating the possibility
of CQ transfer inhibiting viral replication in the stocks
produced in the presence of the drug. It also should be
noted that the inhibitions observed in the two previous
reports are low, varying between 5 – 50% of viral inhibition.

Sequence analysis of HIV-1 extensively passaged through
CD4+ T-lymphocytes revealed a number of genotypic differences between the CQ and the control passaged virus,
including an increased V1V2 charge, a lack of increase in
the V3 overall charge, a shortened V4 region and modulation of the PNG patterns in the variable loops, suggesting
some pressure on the envelope structure exerted through
culturing in the presence of CQ. Interestingly, it has been
reported that CQ may modulate the PNG sites of the
gp120 envelope [1,2,27], which is supported by our
results. When we specifically analyze the epitope of the
2G12 neutralizing Ab, which is known to be expressed by
PNG sites [23], we observe a high degree of variation with
a number of PNG sites lost. Whether this modulation at
the genetic level increases or decreases the capacity of the
virus to be neutralized by 2G12 remains to be elucidated.
This would support our hypothesis that CQ could be considered as a therapeutic agent that does not only reduce
viral load but which can also modify the gp120 envelope
to induce a broader array of neutralizing Abs. Previous
reports have indicated that alterations to PNG sites of the
gp120 structure can provide for altered immune escape
[3-5]. The PNG events on the gp120 molecule have been
referred to as providing a "glycan shield", whereby the
epitopes responsible for neutralization are protected.
Modulating the gp120 envelope glycosylation patterns
through treatment with CQ may have the benefit of
broadening the Ab repertoire in treated individuals and
hence providing better control of in vivo viral replication.
CQ has been shown to impair the formation of glycosylated epitopes on gp120 which are known to be
involved with the binding of 2G12 [1,2]. The epitopes on
the gp120 envelope that are involved with the 2G12 inter-

Sequence analysis of passages viruses in the presence or absence of CQ
Sequence analysis of passages viruses in the presence or absence of CQ. HIV-1 RNA was isolated from culture
supernatant and viral RNA was converted to cDNA and then subjected to a nested PCR in order to amplify a fragment covering the V1V2 – C4 region of the gp120 gene. Sequence analysis was performed on several clones of the CQ and control passages. The sequence of the original virus 293.10 is shown. A) the V1V2 region. B) the V3 region including the PNG site at the
base of the loop. C) the V4 region. The black lines above the original sequence represent PNG sites.

action are at amino acid positions 295, 332, 386, 392, 397
and 448 [23]. It is known that the binding sites on gp120
that interact with 2G12 and DC-SIGN are overlapping and
encompass PNG events. Binding of cellular DC-SIGN can
be reduced by the 2G12 Ab [29], although there have been
reports demonstrating that 2G12 does not block the DCSIGN interaction [30]. Our results with the CQ passaged
virus show a loss of PNG sites at positions 332 and 397 of
gp120, which have been shown to be an integral part of
the 2G12 binding epitope. The loss of these amino acids
may also explain the reduction in the DC-SIGN mediated
transfer of the CQ passaged virus. Variation in the V1V2
and V3 regions have also been shown to be involved with
altered DC-SIGN interactions [20], hence the genotypic
alterations observed in the long-term culture may well be
expected to alter the ability of the virus to be transferred to
CD4+ T-lymphocytes by cells expressing DC-SIGN. Our
results with the C33A produced viruses indicate, however,
that the decrease in DC-SIGN mediated viral transfer can
also be exerted through single-cycle production of virus
suggesting that CQ can affect the post-translational modification of the gp120 molecule. The similar infectivity
phenotype of these viruses on CD4+ T-lymphocytes alone
suggests that the reduction in infectivity in the presence of
Raji-DC-SIGN cells is mediated via the interaction with
the DC-SIGN molecule.
The observed reduction of DC-SIGN mediated transfer
could have implication for HIV-1 transmission. DC-SIGN
has been implicated to play a role in the sexual transmission of HIV-1 and presumably other mucosal transmission routes, such as via breast-feeding [10,14,31-34]. The
virus can interact with DC-SIGN and other C-type lectins
expressed by DCs, which results in internalization of the
virus. Maturation of the DCs results in migration to the
lymph nodes where HIV-1 can be presented to a pool of
CD4+ T-lymphocytes and establish infection. Transmission of viruses from a CQ treated patient may therefore be
more difficult to transmit via this route due to weaker DCSIGN interactions. Although the reduction we observe in
DC-SIGN mediated transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ lymphocytes is low any reduction in DC-SIGN mediated capture of virus at sites of exposure may have a significant
repercussion on lowering rates of transmission, given the
relative inefficiency of infection [35,36]. The effect of CQ
on DC-SIGN binding in vivo remains to be determined,
but if the DC-SIGN binding is indeed reduced than CQ
treatment could be considered as a strategy to reduce
transmission of HIV-1, again advocating for the use of the
drug in specific cases where infection is more likely to
occur.

Conclusion
We have shown in this study that the effects exerted by CQ
on reducing HIV-1 replication in vitro of both R5 and X4

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/6

viruses is exerted at the cellular level and that viruses produced via single round replications or via multiple passage are as infectious and replicate as efficiently as those
produced in the absence of CQ. We have shown that HIV1 passaged with CQ or produced in a single cycle production assay are less efficiently transferred to CD4+ T-lymphocytes via DC-SIGN expressing cells than viruses
produced in the absence of the drug. These results indicate
that the effectiveness of CQ in reducing viral loads may
have its effects exerted through multiple mechanisms.
Additionally, we have identified that PNG patterns of the
virus can alter when passaged in CQ indicating that in vivo
the drug could be utilized as an agent to alter the immunogenic properties of gp120 in order to induce a broader
range of neutralizing antibody responses and hence aide
in the lowering of viral loads. The significance of these
findings to the in vivo setting will be identified through the
study of HIV-1 infected individuals treated with CQ.

Methods
Cells
Raji and Raji-DC-SIGN cells were cultured and utilized as
previously described [10,37]. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated from three buffy coats
from different HIV-1 uninfected donors by standard FicolHypaque density centrifugation, pooled and frozen in
multiple vials. After thawing, PBMCs were activated with
phytohemagglutinin (2 μg/ml) and cultured in RPMI
medium containing 10% FCS, penicillin (100 units/ml)
and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) with recombinant interleukin-2 (100 units/ml). On day 3 the cells underwent
CD8+ cell depletion using CD8 immunomagnetic beads
according to the manufacturers instructions and CD4+ Tlymphocytes were cultured with IL-2 (100 units/ml). The
human carcinoma cell line C33A was cultured in DMEM,
with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml).
Generation of HIV-1 stocks
Replication competent HIV-1 stocks of JR-CSF (R5), LAI
(X4) and 293.10 (R5X4) molecular cloned viruses (previously described in ref [38] were generated by passaging
virus through isolated CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Virus stocks
were also produced by transfection of C33A cells with
plasmid expressing the specific virus strain to be analyzed
and using the assay described below. The CA-p24 levels in
the culture supernatants were determined using a standard ELISA protocol. Virus stocks were generated either in
the presence (100 μM) or absence of CQ.
Long-term passage of HIV-1 in the presence and absence
of CQ
The R5X4 dual-tropic molecular cloned virus (293.10)
was the starting virus for the passage and has been previously described [38]. Fifteen ng/ml of CA-p24 was added

Retrovirology 2007, 4:6

to 10 × 106 CD4+ T-lymphocytes in a volume of 5.0 ml
RPMI medium with 100 μM CQ being added to the CQ
passage culture flask. HIV-1 CA-p24 concentration was
determined once a week with new virus being added to
fresh CD4+ T-lymphocytes. If the CA-p24 levels were too
low then the CA-p24 was re-determined 3 days later with
15 ng/ml subsequently added to fresh cells. Remaining
culture supernatants and cell pellets after each passage
were stored at -80°C until required for analysis.
TCID50/ml determination of generated viral stocks
TCID50/ml values were determined by limiting dilution of
the viral stock on CD4+ T-lymphocytes, as previously
described [38]. In short the CD4+ T-lymphocytes were
plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 96 well plates with 5 fold
serial dilution of the virus. On day 7 the wells were scored
for CA-p24 levels and the number of positive wells determined. These values were used to determine the TCID50/
ml values for each virus. For the determination of the
TCID50/ml for the C33A generated viruses and the viruses
after prolonged culture, the input was standardized at 105
ng/ml CA-p24 and 10.5 ng/ml CA-p24, respectively.
Replication curves of HIV-1 stocks
CD4+ T-lymphocytes were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 96
well plates. One hundred TCID50 of virus stock was utilized with CQ being added either at 200 μM, 100 μM or
50 μm/well. For replication analysis of the C33A generated viruses and the viruses obtained from the prolonged
CQ passage 1 ng/ml of CA-p24 was utilized as virus input.
When analyzing viruses obtained from CQ cultures the
level of CQ in the culture supernatant was compensated
for in the control culture or TCID50/ml determination
assay. CA-p24 values were determined using a standard
ELISA assay for the culture supernatants obtained from
the infection assay collected over time. All experiments
were performed in triplicate with the standard means
depict.
Transfection of C33A cells with virus expressing plasmids
Transfection of C33A cells was performed with 10.0 μg of
plasmid DNA expressing HIV-1 using the CaCl2 precipitation method. All plasmid DNA used was prepared using
Qiagen kits. The DNA precipitate was split between two
wells of C33A cells plated 24 hours earlier at 1.5 X106
cells/well in a 6 well tissue culture plate in DMEM
medium either in the absence or presence of CQ (100
μM). The transfections were performed in a final concentration of 6 ml of DMEM, with penicillin (100 units/ml),
streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and 10% FCS. The following
day the cells were washed with PBS and fresh media was
added, the viral stock was harvested on day 3 of culture
with the viral CA-p24 levels determined by standard
ELISA.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/6

DC-SIGN mediated HIV-1 transfer assay
The assay was performed as previously described [37]. The
Raji and Raji-DC-SIGN cells were plated at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/well in a 96 well format. Four hundred ng/ml of the appropriate virus was added to the RajiDC-SIGN or Raji cells when studying the C33A produced
virus stocks. For the CQ passaged viruses a set CA-p24
input of virus was utilized for each virus set (range 100 –
400 ng/ml). For the CQ passaged viruses the presence of
CQ in the supernatant was compensated for in the control
virus stock with an equal concentration of CQ added.
After 2 hr incubation the culture was washed with PBS
before addition of CD4+ T-lymphocytes at a concentration
of 1 × 105 cells/well. CA-p24 values were determined on
day 7 using a standard ELISA protocol and all experiments
were performed in triplicate.
Sequencing and sequence analysis
HIV-1 RNA was isolated from culture supernatant according to the method of Boom [39]. Viral RNA was converted
to cDNA and then subjected to a nested PCR to amplify a
fragment covering the V1V2 to C4 region of the gp120
gene. DNA sequence alignments were performed manually. Positions containing an alignment gap were included
for the pair-wise sequence analysis. Phylogenetic analysis
of the amplified region was performed with the neighborhood-joining (N-J) analysis of MEGA [40]. The PNG sites
were analyzed using the program available at the HIV-1
sequence database [41].
Statistics
All statistical comparisons were performed using ANOVA
with P < 0.01 being considered as statistically significant.
