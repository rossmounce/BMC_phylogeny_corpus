Abstract
Background: When rearing morphologically indistinguishable laboratory strains concurrently, the
threat of unintentional genetic contamination is constant. Avoidance of accidental mixing of strains
is difficult due to the use of common equipment, technician error, or the possibility of self
relocation by adult mosquitoes ("free fliers"). In many cases, laboratory strains are difficult to
distinguish because of morphological and genetic similarity, especially when laboratory colonies are
isolates of certain traits from the same parental strain, such as eye color mutants, individuals with
certain chromosomal arrangements or high levels of insecticide resistance. Thus, proving genetic
integrity could seem incredibly time-consuming or impossible. On the other hand, lacking proof of
genetically isolated laboratory strains could question the validity of research results.
Results: We present a method for establishing authentication matrices to routinely distinguish and
confirm that laboratory strains have not become physically or genetically mixed through
contamination events in the laboratory. We show a specific example with application to Anopheles
gambiae sensu stricto strains at the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center. This
authentication matrix is essentially a series of tests yielding a strain-specific combination of results.
Conclusion: These matrix-based methodologies are useful for several mosquito and insect
populations but must be specifically tailored and altered for each laboratory based on the potential
contaminants available at any given time. The desired resulting authentication plan would utilize the
least amount of routine effort possible while ensuring the integrity of the strains.

Background
Experimental research often relies on the use of genetically similar animals to ensure that results can be generalized and are repeatable. A research animal's value, or its
"uniqueness", consists of its known genotype and phenotype. Inadvertent contamination could call into question
the validity of research conducted with the same strain
over the course of time: genotypic changes can create dif-

ferent phenotypic properties [1,2]. Thus, research results
reliant on the genotypic or phenotypic nature of the strain
could be invalidated.
Concurrent maintenance of multiple genetically similar
laboratory strains requires much attention to detail along
with a strict program for guaranteeing that they are reared
without contamination. Even with meticulous handling

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/91

and rearing practices, the possibility of inadvertent contamination still exists [3]. Researchers often consider contamination events only after deviations in research results
occur [4,5]. However, by the time laboratory strains are
found to be contaminated, research time and effort have
already been consumed. Thus, using routinely authenticated strains with a known genetic pedigree is worthwhile.
Anopheline colonies may be highly genetically diverse
when initially established, but over time diversity
decreases [6,7]. Continual inbreeding of a population
inevitably leads to loss of genetic diversity, or genetic deterioration [8]. Therefore, after a number of generations,
laboratory strains could be considered unique "monomorphic" entities representing a specific time, place, and
phenotype. In the laboratory, establishment of near monomorphic lines, or phenotypic and genotypic homogenization has importance in reproducible research and is also
of great benefit when attempting to establish discrimination methods. The colonization process often results in
fixed differences in highly conserved genes that can be
used as genetic markers: for example, single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) or established chromosomal
arrangements emerging from an originally polymorphic
wild population.
Some genetic methodologies to differentiate colonized
research animal strains earned publication [9-11], yet
none for routine discrimination of conspecific mosquito
laboratory strains exist. We present a simple methodology

for the routine authentication of laboratory strains reared
in the same space involving a combination of standardized techniques that, when applied together, provide
assurance of the absence of strain contamination. We
illustrate with a specific example of 16 standard lines of
Anopheles mosquitoes housed at the Malaria Research and
Reference Reagent Resource Center (MR4, http://
www.mr4.org).

Results
Development of authentication matrix
To develop an authentication matrix, a survey of all strains
for known, available distinguishing characteristics is done
initially. Considering the MR4 holdings, many strains are
morphologically distinct from all others maintained such
as An. dirus, An. minimus, or An. freeborni. For those,
authentication standards were prepared based upon adult
morphology. The remaining strains were sorted by species
(i.e. An. gambiae s.s. - henceforth referred to as An. gambiae) and their known (as observed over time in our laboratory) genotypic/phenotypic traits were compiled. As an
example, if the red-stripe character was noted in one strain,
the remaining strains were surveyed for that character.

To create a matrix, the authentication methods initially
identified were ordered from least to greatest in terms of
cost and/or time consumption (see Table 1). Once the
techniques applied generated a unique resulting combination, it was then possible to distinguish a cohort from
all others available in the repository and to consider

authentication complete for that strain. The objective of
any authentication should be confidence to the level of
the individual, rather than cohort, when possible. Methods were then analyzed to see where assays could be combined to save time and resources, aiming to complete
authentication in the least number of steps (or in the least
amount of time/cost) with a high degree of confidence.

Phenotypic discrimination
Phenotypic markers are highly useful in routine strain
authentication, when available, because phenotypic
examination is quick and inexpensive. Even if these markers are not practical as a unique strain identifier, in combination with other methods, they may limit the total
number of steps necessary. We employed only phenotypic
traits that had been observed over years in our laboratories and had been previously reported and described by
other researchers. Development of new phenotypic markers as identifying characteristics requires extensive knowledge about the inheritance of characters. The traits
employed in the MR4 authentication matrix follow.

Once the matrix is completed, each line of the table (see
Table 1) represents an authentication method for a particular strain. Additionally, a flow chart was created that represents how an unknown cohort of An. gambiae reared at
the MR4 can be distinguished (Figure 1). This decision
tree presents a different way of thinking about the same
authentication scheme. Of note, authentications must be
conducted on a cohort, see discussion.

Homochromy (cuticle darkening)
Non-wild eye strains (i.e. eye color mutants) will not melanize when cultured in a dark-bottomed pan while the

rently houses several eye color mutants therefore all An.
gambiae were reared in a dark-bottomed pan parallel to
counterparts reared in a white-bottomed pan until the
fourth instar. At this point, the larvae from the dark bottomed pan were transferred to a white-bottomed pan and
the two groups were compared. Among the stocks kept at
MR4, the larval cuticles of 4ARR, M2 and RMOSPW (eye
color mutants) reared in dark pans were not different in
appearance to those reared in white pans while all the
remaining strains display homochromy save one. (Figure
2A &2B). The MR4 maintains IN22C+ which has wild eye
individuals which do not melanize necessitating further
screenings (c+ individuals are typically resistant to dieldrin and melanize while cc individuals which are susceptible to dieldrin and do not melanize).
Eye Color
All An. gambiae strains were examined for eye color in the
pupal or adult stages because both wild type and mutant
strains are reared in this facility. The eye color mutants
reared at the MR4 are not genetically dominant; therefore
any introgression of foreign DNA would lead to a reversion of the eye color phenotype to the wild-type state.

strain exhibiting pink, white, and mosaic (red and white
mixed) colors respectively.
Collarless
Following the method of Benedict et al [14], the collarless
trait was employed as an additional phenotypic marker.
The collar trait presents as a white spot on the dorsal side
of the larval thorax and is easy to observe in a black-bottom pan (Figure 2C). This phenotypic character was used
to separate the strains into three groups: c+: all larvae display the distinctive white patch (SUA2La, RSP-ST, MALINIH, PIMPERENA, and AKRON), c+/cc: on the cohort
level, some larvae have the white patch and others do not
(RSP, ZAN/U, IN22C+, KISUMU, MOPTI, G3), and purebreeding for cc: the white patch is absent from all larvae
(L3-5 and ASEMBO1).
Insecticide resistance
The use of insecticide resistance assays serves the purpose
of authentication as well as guaranteeing resistance
thresholds. Over time, resistance levels in a strain can
decline therefore routine treatment is necessary. After
authentication, only individuals surviving the treatment
are used for strain propagation.

Genotypic discrimination
Screening for genetic markers is more time consuming
and costly than the previously mentioned methods. However, for many of the strains housed at the MR4, the value
of the strain depends on fixed genetic characters; so this
method of screening is logical and necessary. The first criteria for molecular characteristics in our scenario were
those that were of distinct importance to the value of our
strains such as the refractory nature of the thioester-containing protein gene for L3-5 or the 2La chromosomal
arrangement for SUA2La. It was determined that these
two established PCR methods (TEP1 [15] and 2La [16])
could be multiplexed reducing the time, cost, and effort
(Figure 3). Similarly, SNPs commonly associated with the
Mopti/Savanna (M/S) rDNA types were previously used to
create a molecular assay combined with an established
method for An. gambiae species identification assay as
described in Wilkins et al. [17] (Figure 4). The white gene
was also useful in separating genetically similar MOPTI,
MALI and ZAN/U, PIMERPENA using strain-specific SNPs
(Figure 5).

Quantities required for establishment of traits and routine
testing
The colonies illustrated in this example have been maintained for many years and the traits tested extensively. For
initial screenings of new colonies, it is recommended that
100% of the individuals be examined for each characteristic for no less than 5 sequential generations and continuing in a recurring pattern (every nth generation, based on
laboratory constraints) to ensure stability and reproducibility of characters and testing mechanics. For each laboratory and situation, the quantity of individuals to test

routinely should also be based on frequency of testing and
laboratory constraints. For morphological traits or insecticide resistant strains, we screen 100% of the individuals
every fifth generation due to ease of inspection. Screening
all individuals provides the most confidence but is not
necessarily imperative if testing occurs frequently. For
molecular traits, no less than 48 individuals are tested
every fifth generation in our laboratories. Required numbers were chosen somewhat arbitrarily by our group based
on laboratory constraints, feasibility, and the animal of
interest. However, recurring and frequent testing over the
course of generations is most important.

Record keeping
An authentication record of laboratory strains is useful for
historical assurance that uniqueness has not been compromised. Conversion of the chosen authentication methodologies into records is important. At the MR4, each line
of Table 1 was converted into a stock-specific authentication form including dates, generation number, and specific criteria (how many individuals should be viewed,
expected result, etc.). The observer is responsible for signing and dating a record log after the completion of each
assay. If any result is incomplete or ambiguous, the process begins anew with the next generation. Once all assays
are completed, the paperwork is archived and available
for future researchers. A full evaluation of each strain
should be conducted in a recurring fashion determined by
the individual researcher. Storing individual insect samples after each authentication evaluation may be useful in
the future for determining the timeline of any genetic
changes. Archived material may also be valuable for future
determinations of whether newly discovered alleles have
always been present or if, and possibly when, a strain's
genetic makeup may have changed, for example.

By employing an assortment of markers, an authentication matrix such as this one (Table 1, Figure 1) can be
established to discriminate large or small numbers of
strains. At the MR4, similar matrices are kept for all morphologically indistinguishable strains.

Discussion
Phenotypic characteristics are most commonly employed
for strain discrimination due to ease and cost efficiency.
Knowledge of how strains normally behave (larval resting
postures, growth rate, size, feeding preferences) serves as
an ongoing incomplete authentication process. Observation is also an important part of colony health maintenance as observable factors such as slow growth are a
quick indicator of unhealthy conditions or potential contamination. For both reasons, regular monitoring of all
strains being housed should be performed by trained personnel, and any unexpected behavioral observations
should be evaluated with authentication testing. Nitzki et
al. [5], for example, showed practical application of phenotypic markers alerting of genotypic introgression
between laboratory populations.
Fixed phenotypic characteristics such as insecticide resistance or visible traits can be used to easily, inexpensively,
and routinely scan for contamination events if available
in the strains. For example, larvae of An. gambiae often
express visible characteristics such as collarless, red-stripe,
and black diamond [18] (Figure 2) which may be unique to
certain strains. These same characteristics can be selected
out of a polymorphic group as a strain-specific marker
[19]. It is important to note that deviations in phenotypic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/91

expression are not always a result of inter-strain contamination but can be caused by changes in the rearing environment, for example. Also, the expression of some traits
can be variable making it difficult to use for routine
authentication. For example, the collarless trait can be
weakly expressed, making it more difficult to confirm. For
these reasons, using genetic markers in concert with phenotypic markers is advisable where possible. Detailed
information about the phenotypic characteristics of An.
gambiae at the MR4 is not presented here but was considered in the development of these methods.
Routine challenge of an insecticide resistant strain
removes any potential susceptible contaminants and
maintains the strain's insecticide resistance levels which is
of particular interest to our laboratory's research apart
from authentication methods making it a very useful tool
since we would be conducting this selection process anyway. Exposing larvae to an insecticide is an advantageous
method of treatment as the concentration is more uniform in solution and all individuals remain in constant
contact with the insecticide eliminating the threat of individual underexposure. Resistant populations should
always be tested concomitantly with susceptible populations as a control, and if susceptible strains are reared
alongside resistant populations, their susceptible nature
should be monitored as well.
PCR was our chosen method for genetic discrimination
because it can be standardized and reproduced in most
laboratories, and it was, therefore, favored over more
complicated (Luminex) or technical (karyotyping/allozyme) methods evaluated.
In many animal groups, the use of isogenic lines, or
clones, are employed to overcome inter-laboratory variation since individuals tested are genetically homogenous.
However the development of these lines involves sibling
inter-mating resulting in inbreeding depression [2,3]. The
deleterious effects on longevity and fecundity are undesirable in routine colony maintenance [20]. Standard lines,
including phenotypically unique strains as well as "wild
type" strains, are more often chosen due to their ease in
maintenance and higher fitness levels. In higher orders,
there is some debate of whether research employing
standard lines is valid due to variable genotypes [3]. This
is also of concern for culicids [21,22]. However, with alternate technologies such as microarray expression analyses,
genetic function can be directly linked regardless of
knowledge of the individual's genotype [23].
Hii et al. [6] and Dejong et al. [24] reported inter-laboratory genetic variability in sub-populations of anopheline
strains. Although these differences may be due to genetic
drift and selection, contamination cannot be initially

excluded. Since genetic contamination can occur without
complete mixing of the chromosomes, an assay only
detecting one marker on a single chromosome could miss
this type of contamination. Therefore, assays should
employ multiple markers on multiple chromosomes
where possible for a higher level of confidence in results.
In the example presented in this paper, we chose molecular markers located on the X, 2L, and 3L chromosomes.
Alternate methods
We analyzed Luminex technology as an alternative
method for authentication. With this technology, large

numbers of SNP sites can be simultaneously detected in a
gene(s) [25]. By multiplexing a PCR with several genes of
interest, we were able to create a successful Luminex procedure for screening samples for authentication (data not
presented). However, the PCR plus Luminex procedure
was more time consuming and expensive than the 1 or 2
PCR methods required as presented here. If more cost- or
time-efficient, Luminex technology could be a valuable
authentication tool, assuming adequate SNP sites were
available for discrimination. The different genes of interest would need to be limited as well to avoid many preliminary PCR steps.

Allozyme analyses and karyotyping are successfully used
to discriminate between conspecific laboratory strains
[6,26,27]. These methods, however, require extensive
training in sample preparation and analyses making routine usage difficult, especially if simpler, less expensive
methods are available.
We also considered insertion patterns of transposable elements (TEs) (i.e. mobile genetic units capable of replicating and spreading in the host genome) which have
recently been applied to study genetic differentiation
between An. gambiae molecular forms [28-32]. Among
TEs, Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) have been
extensively used as phylogenetic and population genetic
markers in primate taxa and An. gambiae [28,30,32].
Despite the discriminative value for our strains detected in
a few loci during preliminary research (data not presented), we did not pursue this approach for a number or
reasons. Most loci tested were polymorphic in most
strains and therefore only a few presented fixed variants
with discriminative value. Moreover, most loci presented
a high percentage of PCR failure (6-49%). For routine
screenings, this was especially important as the absence of
any amplification product for a particular sample could
indicate the presence of a particular mutation in the
primer binding sequence or simply a PCR failure. Also,
using this method, common "stutter" bands and shadow
bands made routine scoring quite difficult. In addition,
the few strains that could be classified with this approach
could also be authenticated using other techniques with
greater reliability.

Conclusion
In many laboratories, multiple, conspecific strains are
often reared simultaneously with limited separation.
Physical separation of strains and their associated rearing
instruments is the simplest method to prevent inter-strain
contamination. However, implementing this level of perfect separation is often not feasible due to space limitations or other constraints. Routine genetic-based
validation protocols are highly recommended, but few
laboratories report routinely employing such methods
[2,5].

Ultimately, development of routine methods requires a
thorough review of which potential contaminants are
available in an individual laboratory and what is known
about each strain. Tests can then be organized by ease of
implementation, cost efficiency, availability of equipment, transferrable protocols, and most importantly,
what is important to the particular group. Combining the
tests for strain-specific outcome combinations yields a
matrix for assurance of genetic isolation. Authentication
implementation should occur at a frequency that fits the
laboratory environment. Authentication procedures and
endpoints, however, should never be considered fixed.
Revision may be necessary based on the discovery of new
phenotypes, genetic markers, or other methods that could
be used to discriminate between strains as well as introduction of new genetically similar colonies into the laboratory.

Methods
Mosquito rearing and manipulation
Mosquitoes were obtained from the MR4 (CDC Atlanta,
GA USA, Table 2). Larvae were reared at 27Â°C using a
standard method [33] with larval diet from Aquaricareâ¢
(Koi Floating Blend). Two cohorts of approximately 300
second instar larvae from each strain were reared concurrently in white and black bottomed pans in order to elicit
the homochromy response as described by Benedict et al
[13].
Insecticide treatment
Cohorts of 600 fourth instar larvae were treated with
insecticides as described in the MR4 Methods in Anopheles
Research Training Manual (section 4.3.1) [34] with final
concentrations and exposure times as follows: Permethrin
(1 ppm, 24 h), Propoxur (20 ppm, 1 h), Dieldrin (1 ppm,
1 h), DDT (0.4 ppm, 24 h).
PCR
Mosquito samples were prepared for PCR by the method
of Rafferty et al [35]. PCR products were observed by separation on 0.5Ã TBE agarose gels run in 0.5Ã TBE buffer at
12 v/cm and fragment sizes were estimated using a 1 kb
ladder marker (Invitrogen Â®). Thermal cycling for all analyses was performed in a Bio-Rad iCyclerÂ®. Go-Taq DNA

Sequencing of white gene
In order to obtain SNP sites to discriminate MOPTI from
MALI and ZAN/U from PIMPERENA, the white gene from
these mosquito strains was amplified using primers WG2
and WG5 and conditions as described by Mukabayire et al
[37]. PCR products were sequenced and matched those of
Genbank:U29485 with the exceptions of SNP sites shown
in Table 4. SNP sites were used to design primers using the
intentional mismatch primer (IMP) method [17] as
shown in Table 3.

Authors' contributions
EW developed the unique molecular assays presented,
participated in the creation of the authentication matrix,
produced the Tables, and co-drafted the manuscript. PM
tested the SINEs as an authentication method and wrote
the portion of the paper covering that topic. AS participated in the sequencing of the white gene and the creation
of several Figures. PH participated in the creation of the
authentication matrix and co-drafted the manuscript. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
