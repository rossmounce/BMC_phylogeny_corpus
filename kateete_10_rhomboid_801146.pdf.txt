Abstract
Background: Rhomboids are ubiquitous proteins with diverse functions in all life kingdoms, and are emerging as
important factors in the biology of some pathogenic apicomplexa and Providencia stuartii. Although prokaryotic
genomes contain one rhomboid, actinobacteria can have two or more copies whose sequences have not been
analyzed for the presence putative rhomboid catalytic signatures. We report detailed phylogenetic and genomic
analyses devoted to prokaryotic rhomboids of an important genus, Mycobacterium.
Results: Many mycobacterial genomes contained two phylogenetically distinct active rhomboids orthologous to
Rv0110 (rhomboid protease 1) and Rv1337 (rhomboid protease 2) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, which were
acquired independently. There was a genome-wide conservation and organization of the orthologs of Rv1337
arranged in proximity with glutamate racemase (mur1), while the orthologs of Rv0110 appeared evolutionary
unstable and were lost in Mycobacterium leprae and the Mycobacterium avium complex. The orthologs of Rv0110
clustered with eukaryotic rhomboids and contained eukaryotic motifs, suggesting a possible common lineage. A
novel nonsense mutation at the Trp73 codon split the rhomboid of Mycobacterium avium subsp. Paratuberculosis
into two hypothetical proteins (MAP2425c and MAP2426c) that are identical to MAV_1554 of Mycobacterium avium.
Mycobacterial rhomboids contain putative rhomboid catalytic signatures, with the protease active site stabilized by
Phenylalanine. The topology and transmembrane helices of the Rv0110 orthologs were similar to those of
eukaryotic secretase rhomboids, while those of Rv1337 orthologs were unique. Transcription assays indicated that
both mycobacterial rhomboids are possibly expressed.
Conclusions: Mycobacterial rhomboids are active rhomboid proteases with different evolutionary history. The
Rv0110 (rhomboid protease 1) orthologs represent prokaryotic rhomboids whose progenitor may be the ancestors
of eukaryotic rhomboids. The Rv1337 (rhomboid protease 2) orthologs appear more stable and are conserved
nearly in all mycobacteria, possibly alluding to their importance in mycobacteria. MAP2425c and MAP2426c provide
the first evidence for a split homologous rhomboid, contrasting whole orthologs of genetically related species.
Although valuable insights to the roles of rhomboids are provided, the data herein only lays a foundation for
future investigations for the roles of rhomboids in mycobacteria.

Background
The genus Mycobacterium consists of ~148 species [1],
of which some are leading human and animal pathogens. Tuberculosis (TB), the most important mycobacterial disease, is caused by genetically related species
commonly referred to as “the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex” (MTC: Mycobacterium tuberculosis;

M. bovis, also the causative agent of bovine TB; M. bovis
BCG; M. africanum; M. carnetti and M. microti [2]). M.
leprae and M. ulcerans are respectively the causative
agents for two other important diseases, Leprosy and
Buruli ulcer [3,4]. Besides the three major diseases, M.
avium subsp. Paratuberculosis causes John’s disease (a
fatal disease of dairy cattle [5]) and is also suspected to
cause Crohn’s disease in humans [5]. In addition, M.
avium and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
have become important opportunistic pathogens of
immunocompromised humans and animals [6,7].

Mycobacteria have versatile lifestyles and habitats,
complexities also mirrored by their physiology. While
some can be obligate intracellular pathogens (i.e. the
MTC species) [8], others are aquatic inhabitants, which
can utilize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (i.e. M.
vanbaalenii) [9]. The biology of pathogenic mycobacteria remains an enigma, despite their importance in
human and veterinary medicine. Except for the mycolactone of M. ulcerans, glycolipids (such as PDIMs) and
proteins (such as ESAT-6) of MTC species [10,11], largely, in contrast to most bacterial pathogens, pathogenic
mycobacteria lack obvious virulence factors and the
mechanisms in which they cause diseases are still
obscure [12]. Genome sequencing projects have provided invaluable tools that are accelerating the understanding of the biology of pathogenic mycobacteria. As
such, genome sequencing data has guided the characterization of genes/pathways for microbial pathogens,
accelerating discovery of novel control methods for the
intractable mycobacterial diseases [5,13-16].
The rhomboid protein family exists in all life kingdoms and has rapidly progressed to represent a ubiquitous family of novel proteins. The knowledge and the
universal distribution of rhomboids was engendered and
accelerated by functional genomics [17]. The first rhomboid gene was discovered in Drosophila melanogaster as
a mutation with an abnormally rhomboid-shaped head
skeleton [17,18]. Genome sequencing data later revealed
that rhomboids occur widely in both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes [17]. Many eukaryotic genomes contain several copies of rhomboid-like genes (seven to fifteen)
[19], while most bacteria contain one homolog [19].
Despite biochemical similarity in mechanism and specificity, rhomboid proteins function in diverse processes
including mitochondrial membrane fusion, apoptosis and
stem cell differentiation in eukaryotes [20]. Rhomboid proteases are also involved in life cycles of some apicomplexan parasites, where they participate in red blood cell
invasion [21-25]. Rhomboids are now linked to general
human diseases such as early-onset blindness, diabetes
and pathways of cancerous cells [20,26,27]. In bacteria,
aarA of Providencia stuartii was the first rhomboid homolog to be characterized, which was shown to mediate a
non-canonical type of quorum sensing in this gram negative species [28-30]. Since then, bacterial rhomboids are
being characterized, albeit at low rate; gluP of Bacillus subtilis is involved in cell division and glucose transport [31],
while glpG of Escherichia coli [17,32] was the first rhomboid to be crystallized, paving way for delineation of the
mechanisms of action for rhomboid proteases [33,34].
Although universally present in all kingdoms, not all
rhomboids are active proteases [19,35]. Lemberg and
Freeman [35] defined the rhomboid family as genes
identified by sequence homology alone, and the

Page 3 of 18

rhomboid proteases as a subset that includes only genes
with all necessary features for predicted proteolytic
activity. As such, rhomboid-like genes in eukaryotic genomes are classified into the active rhomboids, inactive
rhomboids (known as the iRhoms) and a diverse group
of other proteins related in sequence but predicted to
be catalytically inert. The eukaryotic active rhomboids
are further divided into two subfamilies: the secretase
rhomboids that reside in the secretory pathway or
plasma membrane, and the PARL subfamily, which are
mitochondrial [35].
Despite their presence in virtually all eubacteria, there
is a paucity of information about the functions of bacterial rhomboids. Hitherto, full phylogenetic analysis of
rhomboids from the complex and populous prokaryotes
has not been done; although it can provide important
functional and evolutionary insights [17,35], it is a huge
and difficult task to perform at once. Many species of
mycobacteria contain two copies of rhomboid homologs
whose sequences have not been investigated for the presence of functional signatures. Furthermore, actinobacteria can have up to five copies of rhomboids, the
significance of which is currently not known. This study
aimed at determining the distribution, evolutionary
trends and bioinformatic analysis of rhomboids from an
important genus -Mycobacterium.
Herein we report that mycobacterial rhomboids are
active proteases with different evolutionary history, with
Rv0110 orthologs representing a group of prokaryotic
rhomboids whose progenitor may be the ancestor for
eukaryotic rhomboids.

Results and discussion
A quest for the role(s) of rhomboids in mycobacteria is
overshadowed by their diverse functions across kingdoms and even within species. Their presence across
kingdoms implies that rhomboids are unusual useful
factors that originated early in the evolution of life and
have been conserved [20]. However, neither the reason
for their implied significance nor the path of their evolution are understood; the key to answering these questions is rooted in understanding not only the sequence
distribution of these genes, but more importantly, their
functions across evolution [17,20]. This study reports
that mycobacterial rhomboids are active rhomboid-serine-proteases with different evolutionary history. Reverse
Transcriptase-PCRs on mycobacterial mRNA indicate
that both copies of rhomboids are transcribed.
The distribution of rhomboids in mycobacteria: a nearly
conserved rhomboid with unique genome organization
across the genus

In determining the distribution of rhomboid homologs
in mycobacteria, we used the two rhomboids of M.

tuberculosis H37Rv, Rv0110 (rhomboid protease 1) and
Rv1337 (rhomboid protease 2) as reference and query
sequences. Many mycobacterial genomes contained two
rhomboids, which were orthologous either to Rv0110 or
Rv1337. However, there was only one homolog in the
genomes of the MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex)
species, M. leprae and M. ulcerans, which were orthologous either to Rv1337 (MAC and M. leprae rhomboids)
or Rv0110 (M. ulcerans rhomboid). M. ulcerans was the
only mycobacterial species with an ortholog of Rv0110
as a sole rhomboid. Thus, with the exception of M.
ulcerans which had a rhomboid-like element
(MUL_3926, pseudogene), there is a genome-wide conservation of the rhomboids orthologous to Rv1337
(rhomboid protease 2) in mycobacteria (figure 1).
Despite evolutionary differences across the genus, the
Rv1337 mycobacterial orthologs shared a unique genome
organization at the rhomboid locus, with many of the
rhomboid surrounding genes conserved (figure 1). Typically, upstream and downstream of the rhomboid were
cysM (cysteine synthetase) and mur1 (glutamate racemase) encoding genes. Since Rv1337 orthologs are almost
inseparable from mur1 and cysM, it is likely that they are
co-transcribed (polycistronic) or functional partners. As
such, we may consider the cluster containing mycobacterial Rv1337 orthologs as a putative operon. According
to Sassetti et al [36,37], many of the rhomboid surrounding genes are essential while others (including rhomboid
protease 2, Rv1337) are required for the survival of the
tubercle bacillus in macrophages [38].
Despite massive gene decay in M. leprae, ML1171
rhomboid had similar genome arrangement observed for
mycobacterial species. Upstream of ML1171 were gene
elements (pseudogenes) ML1168, ML1169 and ML1170
(the homolog of cysM which is conserved downstream
most Rv1337 orthologs). Similar to M. lepare, the MAC
species also had an ortholog of Rv1337 as a sole rhomboid; perhaps the ortholog of Rv0110 was lost in the
progenitor for MAC and M. leprae (these species are
phylogenetically related and appear more ancient in
comparison to M. marinum, M. ulcerans and MTC species [39]). In contrast to most mycobacterial genomes,
cysM was further upstream the M. marinum rhomboid
(MMAR_4059); and despite being genetically related to
MTC species [40], MMAR_ 4059 does not share much
of the genome organization observed for Rv1337 MTC
orthologs (figure 1).
The rhomboid-like element of M. ulcerans
(MUL_3926, pseudogene) was identical to MMAR_4059
(~96% similarity to MMAR_4059) with a 42 bp insertion
at the beginning and eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Perhaps the insertion disrupted the open
reading frame (ORF) of MUL_3926, converting it into a
pseudogene. Interestingly, MUL_3926 nearly assumed

Page 4 of 18

the unique organization observed for mycobacterial
orthologs of Rv1337, in which the rhomboid element
was upstream of mur1.
The functional and evolutionary significance for the
unique organization of the Rv1337 orthologs in mycobacteria is not clear. Since physiological roles are not
yet ascribed to mycobacterial rhomboids, it is not certain whether MUL_3926 (psuedogene) would mimic
similar roles in that it almost assumed similar genomic
organization (note: functions have been ascribed to certain pseudogenes [41-43]). However, the fact that M.
ulcerans is a new species (recently evolved from M.
marinum [40]) that has undergone reductive evolution,
MUL_3926 could be a consequence of these recent phenomena [44]. Interestingly, MUL_3926 was the only
rhomboid-like element in mycobacteria.
In contrast, the genome organization for Rv0110
orthologs was not conserved, and mirrored the genetic
relatedness of mycobacteria (figure 2). As such, the
orthologs from MTC species, M. marinum and M.
ulcerans, which are genetically related and are assumed
to have the same M. marinum-like progenitor
[39,40,45,46] had similar organization for Rv0110 ortholog. Downstream and upstream of the rhomboid were
respectively, the transmembrane acyltransferase and the
Proline-Glutamate polymorphic GC rich-repetitive
sequence (PE-PGRS) encoding genes. PE-PGRS occurs
widely in M. marinum and MTC genomes [39] but it
was a pseudogene upstream MUL_4822 of M. ulcerans.
The distances between MTC Rv0110 orthologs and the
neighboring genes were long, in contrast to the short
distances between Rv1337 rhomboids and their neighboring genes.
Similarly, the genome organization for the Rv0110
orthologs of M. gilvum, M. vanbaalenii and Mycobacterium species M.Jls, Mkms and Mmcs was also similar.
Upstream and downstream the rhomboid was, respectively, the glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance protein/dioxygenase encoding gene and a gene that encodes a
hypothetical protein. In contrast to MTC species, the
Rv0110 orthologs in these species were close or contiguous with the neighboring genes (figure 2). The genome
organization of MAB_0026 of M. abscessus and
MSMEG_5036 of M. smegmatis were unique to these
species (not shown).
Many bacterial genomes contain a single copy of
rhomboid. However, filamentous actinobacteria such as
Streptomyces coelator and Streptomyces scabiei have as
many as four or five copies of rhomboid-like genes.
Since multi-copy rhomboids in prokaryotic genomes are
not yet characterized, it is not certain whether prokaryotic rhomboids can also have diverse functions, similar to
multi-copy rhomboids in eukaryotic genomes. Mycobacteria and actinobacteria at large exhibit diverse

physiological and metabolic properties. It remains to be
determined whether the diversity in number, nature and
functions of rhomboids can contribute to the complex
lifestyles of these organisms [8].
Similarity between the two mycobacterial rhomboid
paralogs

Across the genus, the similarity between the two mycobacterial rhomboid paralogs was as low as that between
prokaryotic and eukaryotic rhomboids (~10-20% identity) [19]. Since paralogs perform biologically distinct

functions [47], the two mycobacterial rhomboids may
have distinct roles. Eukaryotic rhomboid paralogs are
also dissimilar and differ in functions in a particular species [17]. In contrast, the orthologs had significantly
high homology (see table 1), with an average identity of
74%. Rv0110 orthologs within the MTC and MAC species had an identity of ~100% while those from other
mycobacterial species had identities ranging from 61 to
78% (table 1). The exception was MAB_0026 of M.
abscessus, which shared a significantly low homology
with Rv0110 (38% identity at 214 amino acid overlap).

genes (which were big except in M. gilvum, M. vanbaalenii, and Mycobacterium spp. JLS, Mks and Mmcs).

This could be due to the large evolutionary distance
between M. abscessus and other mycobacteria. Since
proteins of ~70% identity or more are likely to have
similar functions [48], MAB_0026 may have unique
roles.
The two mycobacterial rhomboids were acquired
independently

To determine evolutionary relationship between the two
rhomboid paralogs, phylogenetic analysis was done and
included distant eukaryotic and prokaryotic rhomboids.
The mycobacterial rhomboids clustered into two distinct
clades with high Bootsrap values (99-100%), indicating
that the rhomboids could have been acquired independently (figure 3A). Each clade consisted of rhomboids
orthologous either to Rv0110 or Rv1337, grouped
according to genetic relatedness of mycobacteria [39],
with MAB_0026 of M. abscessus appearing the most distant. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the two
mycobacterial rhomboids are paralogs, but their

progenitor could not be determined. Thus, the mycobacterial rhomboid paralogs may be “outparalogs” (i.e.
they could have resulted from duplication(s) preceding a
speciation event [47]), while the orthologs could have
originated from a single ancestral gene in the last common ancestor [47]). The Neighbor-Joining and Minimum Evolution phylogenetic trees were compared and
gave almost comparable results.
The Rv0110 (rhomboid protease 1) mycobacterial
orthologs (boxed blue) clustered with eukaryotic secretase and PARL rhomboids with a high Bootstrap value
(85%, figure 3A). When grouped with eukaryotic
iRhoms, the Bootstrap value for this clade increased to
90%, with iRhoms forming a distinct clade (not shown).
The Rv0110 mycobacterial orthologs may represent prokaryotic rhomboids with similar lineage or progenitor
for eukaryotic active rhomboids. This was previously
noted by Koonin et al [19], who hinted on a subfamily
of eukaryotic rhomboids that clustered with rhomboids
of Gram positive bacteria. Indeed, the Rv0110

mycobacterial orthologs contained extra eukaryotic
motifs and have topologies similar to that of rho-1 of
drosophila. Koonin et al [19] alluded that rhomboids
could have emerged in a bacterial lineage and were
eventually widely disseminated (to other life kingdoms)
by horizontal transfer [19]. Conversely, the Rv1337
mycobacterial orthologs (boxed red) formed a distinct
clade, different from Rv0110 mycabacterial orthologs.
These rhomboids appeared evolutionary stable and did
not cluster with eukaryotic rhomboids.
MAB_0026 of M. abscess which had low homology
with Rv0110 also appeared distant and clustered poorly
with mycobacterial orthologs, in contrast with its paralog
MAB_1481 (figure 3A). Since orthologs have an ancestral
gene in the last common ancestor [47], MAB_0026 could
be a “pseudoortholog” (i.e. it is a distant paralog that
appears orthologous due to differential, lineage-specific
gene loss [47]). In phylogenetic analysis of mycobacterial
rhomboids orthologous to Rv0110, MAB_0026 was also
distant from rhomboids of other actinobacteria (figure
3B). Since M. abscessus is one of the earliest species to
diverge of all mycobacterial species [39], the low homology could reflect evolutionary distance or stability of this
rhomboid. However, the high homology of MAB_1481
(62% identity with Rv1337) contrasts the low homology
of MAB_0026 (38% identity with Rv0110), negating the
notion of evolutionary distance and instead favors evolutionary stability of MAB_0026.

Multiple sequence alignment revealed that all mycobacteria rhomboids contain the putative rhomboid catalytic
residues Gly199, Ser201 and His254. The mycobacterial
rhomboids also contained two additional C-terminal
Histidins (His145 and His150, which together with
His254 are universally conserved in the rhomboid proteins [19]) and five invariant transmembrane residues
(Gly202, Gly257, Gly261, Asn154 and Ala200) that are
also conserved in many rhomboid proteins [33]. However in mycobacteria, Ala252 which occurs in many
eukaryotic and prokaryotic rhomboids was substituted
by Gly (figure 4). Furthermore, Tyr205 which stabilizes
the rhomboid protease active site of glpG [17,33] and of
many rhomboid proteases was only conserved in
MAB_0026 of M. abscessus, being substituted by Phe in
mycobacterial rhomboids (figure 4). Thus, Phe is the
stabilizing residue in the protease active site for majority
of mycobacterial rhomboids (Phe is an additional stabilizing residue for rhomboid proteases [17]).
The nature of the transmembrane helices (TMHs)
formed by mycobacterial rhomboids was analyzed to
determine whether they conform to those of active

Figure 3 Mycobacterial rhomboids have different evolutionary history. A: Mycobacterial rhomboids clustered into two distinct clades
(boxed blue and red). The Rv0110 mycobacterial orthologs (boxed blue) clustered with eukaryotic active rhomboids (unboxed). The Rv1337
mycobacterial orthologs (boxed red) appeared unique. Mycobacterial rhomboids could have been acquired at the same time, and the orthologs
of Rv0110 were eventually lost in the MAC species and M. leprae. Mouse-protein farnesyl transferase, FT, [GenBank: AAI38303] was the outgroup.
B: MAB0026 of M. abscessus (underlined blue) is conspicuously distant from its mycobacterial orthologs (boxed blue).

rhomboid proteases. Mycobacterial orthologs of Rv0110
formed seven TMHs and topologies similar to those of
eukaryotic rhomboid rho-1 of Drosophila (see figure 5).
As in rho-1, the rhomboid catalytic residues GxSx & H
(Gly199, Ser201 and His254, × being any residue) were
localized respectively, in TMH4 and TMH6 (see figure 5

and details in additional file 1). In mycobacterial orthologs of Rv0110, the two C-terminal histidine and asparagine (His145, His150 and Asn154) were localized in
TMH2, in contrast to eukaryotic rhomboid proteases
which have these residues in TMH3 [17,19,23]. However, in our analyses, we found His145, His150 and

Figure 5 The topology of mycobacterial rhomboids. Boxed (yellow) are the transmembrane domains containing the rhomboid catalytic
residues and locations for the C-termini conserved residues. The Rv0110 mycobacterial orthologs formed topologies similar to those of the
secretase eukaryotic rhomboid rho-1. The Rv1337 mycobacterial orthologs formed either six or five TMHs. The orthologs of pathogenic
mycobcateria formed six TMHs while the orthologs of non-pathogenic mycobacteria formed five TMHs.

Asn154 in TMH2 in rho-1, similar to Rv0110 (see additional file 2). Despite the proteins being evolutionary
diverse, other studies found the overall structure of
TMHs of rhomboid proteases conserved, with eukaryotic rhomboid proteases containing seven TMHs while
archaea and eubacteria contain six [23,49]. It is not clear
whether these similarities infer evolutionary or functional significance; similar topologies with eukaryotic
rhomboids could imply occurrence of a common bacterial universal progenitor for the eukaryotic rhomboids
[19]. Nevertheless, prokaryotic and eukaryotic integral
transmembrane proteins can have similar architecture,
with striking similarity in the amino acid frequency distribution in their TMHs [50].
In contrast, the mycobacterial orthologs of Rv1337
formed either six or five TMHs, as observed in most
bacterial and archaeal rhomboids [19]. The orthologs of
pathogenic mycobacteria formed six TMHs, while those
of non-pathogenic mycobacteria formed five (see figure
5). The GxSx and H catalytic residues were found
respectively, either in TMH4 and TMH6 (for Rv1337

orthologs of pathogenic mycobacterial with six TMHs
-see details in additional file 3) or in TMH3 and TMH5
(for Rv1337 orthologs of non pathogenic mycobacterial
with five TMHs, see additional file 4). The mycobacterial orthologs with six TMHs had the two C-terminal His
and Asn residues in TMH2, as in the Rv0110 orthologs;
however, in the orthologs with five TMHs, these residues were outside the TMHs (see additional file 4).
Although His145, His150 and Asn154 are not essential
for catalytic activity [33], it is not clear whether their
absence in TMHs can affect functionality. This seems
unlikely in that functions have been ascribed to the catalytically inert eukaryotic iRhoms lacking the minimum
catalytic sites [26,27]. Alternatively, the observed differences may imply functional divergence, with rhomboids
of pathogenic mycobacteria being functionally different
from those of non-pathogenic mycobacteria. Indeed,
Rv1337 was essential for the survival of the tubercle
bacilli in macrophages [38]. Nevertheless, experimental
evidence will be necessary for validation of these
assertions.

Extra protein domains in mycobacterial rhomboids

Mycobacterial rhomboids contained extra protein
motifs, many of which were eukaryotic. The orthologs
of Rv0110 contained diverse eukaryotic motifs, while the
Rv1337 orthologs maintained a fairly constant number
and type of motifs, either fungal cellulose binding
domain or bacterial putative redox-active protein

domains (table 2). It is difficult to account for the origin
of eukaryotic motifs in mycobacterial rhomboids; nevertheless, extra protein motifs are common in eukaryotic
rhomboids where their significance is also not known
[17]. Since eukaryotic rhomboids are presumed to have
been acquired from bacteria through horizontal gene
transfer mechanisms [19], the extra protein motifs may

have originated from prokaryotic progenitors. Mycobacterial rhomboids also contained N-signal peptides and
eukaryotic subcellular localization target signals which
were either mitochondrial or secretory (see table 2),
with scores higher than or comparable to those of rho-7
and PARL. These observations further allude to a common ancestor for mycobacterial and eukaryotic active
rhomboids [17].
A novel nonsense mutation at the Trp73 codon split the
MAP rhomboid into two hypothetical proteins

The annotated rhomboid of M. avium subsp. Paratuberculosis (MAP) in the genome databases appeared truncated; MAP_2425c (hypothetical protein) was
significantly shorter than MAV_1554 of genetically
related M. avium (147 vs. 223 residues, respectively).
Upstream of MAP_2425c was MAP_2426c (74 residues),
similar to the amino-terminal portion of MAV_1554
(100% identity) while the former (MAP_2425c) was
similar to the carboxyl-terminal portion of MAV_1554
(100% identity). MAP_2425c and MAP_2426c were
separated by 10 bp that translate into three residues

(Gln, His and Lys, present in similar location in
MAV_1554) and a stop codon TGA, at nucleotide position 217, which split the homolog into two ORFs.
Because MAP and M. avium are genetically related,
initially, we thought MAP2425c and MAP2426c are
truncated portions (resulting from genome annotation
errors) and should have been a whole rhomboid of
MAP. Thus, we aimed to determine the correct annotation for the MAP rhomboid. Using MAV_1554 specific
primers, we PCR-amplified and sequenced homologs of
MAP2425c and MAP2426c (954 bp) from a cattle isolate of MAP (strain 27, see table 3); the amplicon was
similar to MAP2426c and MAP2425c (containing an
internal stop codon TGA at nucleotide positions 217219, and 10 bp translating into residues Gln, His and
Lys, in similar location as those of MAV1554). Thus, we
confirmed the annotations for MAP2425c (hypothetical
protein) and MAP2426c (hypothetical protein). It was
later revealed that a nonsense mutation at nucleotide
positions 217-219 (formerly TGG, the codon for Trp73),
substituted guanine at the wobble position for adenine,
creating a stop codon (i.e. TGG[Trp73]®TGA[stop

codon]). Usually, nonsense mutations disrupt ORFs
resulting in truncated and non-functional proteins; however, this rare scenario resulted into two unique ORFs
of MAP, providing the first evidence of a split rhomboid, contrasting whole orthologs of genetically related
species. Although the significance of this is currently
not known, cDNA was amplified from both ORFs,
implying that both hypothetical proteins may be
expressed (see figure 6).
What are the lengths of MTC rhomboids?

In genome databases, the lengths for annotated
sequences of rhomboids from genetically related mycobacteria vary, and initially we thought this reflected
strain diversity. For instance, lengths for Rv0110 orthologs of MTC species are either 249 or 284 residues,
while Rv1337 orthologs from the same species are 240
residues. In contrast, MT1378 (ortholog of Rv1337) of
M. tuberculosis CDC 1551 is 227 amino acids, 13 residues shorter at the NH2-terminus. Thus, we aimed to
validate the sizes of rhomboids from related strains/species. Genomic analyses at the rhomboid loci for the
sequenced MTC genomes revealed that MTC rhomboid
orthologs are 100% identical and are of equal length.
Rhomboids were PCR-amplified from MTC with common primer sets for each ortholog (see methods), and
sequencing data confirmed that MTC rhomboid orthologs are identical and are of the same size (284 residues

Page 13 of 18

for Rv0110 orthologs and 240 residues for Rv1337
orthologs). Rhomboid sequences were deposited in GenBank and accession numbers were assigned (see table 3).
Putative gene clusters for mycobacterial rhomboids

To determine putative functional coupling between
mycobacterial rhomboids and other genes, genes in clusters formed by mycobacterial rhomboids at the KEGG
database [51] were analyzed. The gene cluster formed
by Rv1337 was conserved across the genus and extended
to other actinobacteria such as Norcardia and Corynebacteria. This cluster included 58 genes (Rv1311 to
Rv1366, see additional file 5) of which some are essential and others are required for the growth of M. tuberculosis in macrophages [38], a necessary step during
pathogenesis of the tubercle bacillus. Conversely, the
Rv0110 orthologs formed clusters reflecting the genetic
relatedness of mycobacteria. Thus, the orthologs from
MTC species and M. marinum formed similar clusters
consisting of 61 genes (Rv0080 to Rv0140, see additional
file 6). These clusters also included essential genes and
those required for survival of the tubercle bacillus in
macrophage. However, MUL_4822 of genetically related
M. ulcerans was not included in the MTC/M. marinum
cluster, and formed a unique cluster consisting of only
19 genes (MUL_4791 to MUL_4824) with two genes
upstream of the rhomboid (MUL_4823 and MUL_4824,
see additional file 7). It is not certain whether this

reflects functional divergence of MUL_4822 from
Rv0110, in spite of evolutionary relatedness of M. ulcerans and MTC species.
The gene cluster of Rv0110 orthologs of M. vanbaalenii, M. gilvum and Mycobacterium species Jls, Kms and
Mcs were also similar, and consisted of 48 genes
(Mjls_5512 to Mjls_5559, see additional file 8), whose
orthologs in MTC species are required for the growth of
the tubercle bacillus in macrophages [38]. Conversely,
the cluster for MAB_0026 of M. abscessus consisted of
only three genes (MAB_0024, MAB_0025 and
MAB_0026), shared with actinobacteria other than
mycobacteria. Many MTC orthologs in the gene clusters
of MUL_4822, Mjls_5529 and MAB_0026 are required
for the growth of the bacillus in macrophages, the implication of which requires further study. There was no
gene cluster formed by MSMEG_5036 of M. smegmatis.
The essential genes in mycobacterial rhomboid gene
clusters are described in additional file 9.

of M. ulcerans, (the only mycobacterium lacking the
Rv1337 ortholog) is known and it culminates in skin
ulcerations caused by the plasmid encoded polyketide
toxin -mycolactone [4,40,44,57]. Buruli ulcer contrasts
with the tuberculous nature of lesions formed by many
pathogenic mycobacteria, whose pathogenesis is not well
understood and remains a vast field of study.
Moonlighting properties?

It is possible to predict functional coupling between
genes based on conservation of gene clusters among
genomes [56,58]. Since proteins encoded by conserved
gene pairs appear to interact physically [58], the evolutionary conservation of the Rv1337 genome arrangement
might have functional implications. mur1 is a moonlighting protein (ability to perform multiple independent
functions [59]) that exhibits both racemization and
DNA gyrase activities [59]. Since rhomboids are known
for diverse functions, the proximity of Rv1337 orthologs
with a moonlighting protein makes them suspects for
moonlighting properties.

Transcription analysis

Due to their ubiquity in eubacteria, we aimed to determine the expression of mycobacterial rhomboids in a
preliminary fashion by screening for in vivo transcription. RT- (Reverse Transcriptase) PCRs amplified rhomboid cDNAs from mycobacterial mRNA, indicating that
both copies of mycobacterial rhomboids are transcribed,
and possibly expressed (see figure 6).
Functional insights
Signal transduction and Metabolite transport

Since mycobacterial rhomboids contain rhomboid catalytic signatures, they may be functionally similar to
aarA and rho-1, rescuing phenotypes associated with
deletion of these genes in P. stuartii and D. melanogaster rhomboid mutants [52]. Due to their diverse functions, rhomboids appear good candidates for
investigation in studies elucidating inter/intra-species/
kingdom signaling mechanisms [29,53-55].
Furthermore, gluP (contains a rhomboid domain) of B.
subtilis is involved in sugar transport [17,32], while aarA
activates the TatA protein transporter in P. stuartii [31].
As such, the putative gene clusters for mycobacterial
rhomboids contained putative metabolite transporters
and transcriptional regulators. Since genes in clusters
for transport and signal transduction genes tend to have
similar roles [56], mycobacterial rhomboids may have
such roles.
Roles in pathogenesis?

In a TraSH analysis by Rengarajan et al, Rv1337 was
required for the survival of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in
macrophages [38], a necessary step during the development of TB. The genome wide conservation of Rv1337
alludes to a possibly important protein. The pathogenesis

Conclusions
Mycobacterial rhomboids have different evolutionary
history

The two mycobacterial rhomboids are phylogenetically
distinct and could have been acquired independently.
The mycobacterial orthologs of Rv0110 (rhomboid protease 1) appear to be under evolutionary pressure; hence
they were lost in the MAC species and M. leprae. These
orthologs represent prokaryotic rhomboids whose progenitor may be the ancestor for eukaryotic rhomboids.
The Rv1337 (rhomboid protease 2) mycobacterial orthologs appear more stable and are conserved nearly in all
mycobacteria, possibly alluding to their importance in
mycobacteria.
MAP2425c and MAP2426c provide the first evidence
of a split rhomboid contrasting whole orthologs of
genetically related species.
Mycobacterial rhomboids are active rhomboid proteases

Mycobacterial rhomboids are active rhomboid proteases,
with the active site being stabilized by Phe. Although
valuable insights to the roles of rhomboids are provided,
the data herein only lays a foundation for future investigations for the roles of rhomboids in mycobacteria.

synthesis. Reverse Transcriptase-PCRs were performed
with the Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) to amplify
Rv0110 and Rv1337 cDNAs in separate reactions.
Except for the initial cDNA synthesis step (50°C for 30
min), PCR conditions were similar to those described
above. RT-PCRs were repeated with primers (1337int1:
TGGACGTCAACGGCATCAG, forward, and 1337int2:
CCAGCCCAATGACGATATCCC, reverse) that amplify
an internal fragment (~350 bp) of Rv1337 orthologs.

PCR conditions

Chromosomal DNA was extracted from mycobacteria by
boiling heat-killed cells for 10 min and centrifuging
briefly at 5000 g to obtain the supernatant containing
DNA. Amplification reactions contained 20 pmol each
of the rhomboid specific forward and reverse primers
(see below), 1.5 U of high fidelity Taq polymerase
(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), Custom
PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific, Surry, UK), ~200
ng template DNA and nuclease-free water in a reaction
volume of 10 μL. The reactions were performed in a
Peltier thermocycler (MJ Research, Waterman, MA,
USA) at the following conditions: initial denaturation at
94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles each consisting of
94°C, 0.5 min; 60°C, 0.3 min & 72°C, 1 min, with a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. Following amplification,
the amplicons were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced at
ACGT (Wheeling, IL, USA). After analyzing with BioEdit software and BLAST algorithm for similarity
searches, rhomboid sequences were deposited in the
GenBank database (see table 3 for accession numbers).
The following primers were used: 0110F, 5’-ATA
TTCGGCTTCGCCGGAACC-3’ (forward) and 0110R,
5’-ACGCGAAGACAAGCGGCTATC-3’ (reverse) for
MTC Rv0110 orthologs; 1337F, 5’ ACGCCGGGTGGAAGTATCTG-3’ (forward) and 1337R, 5’-CCG
ACGCCGGAATCAAAGACTC-3’ (reverse) for MTC
Rv1337 orthologs. For MAC species, primer pair 1554F,
5’-TCGACGGTGACACCGTGTTC-3’ (forward) and
1554R, 5’-TGCCGAGCTCATGTCTTGGG-3’ (reverse)
was used. For M. smegmatis, primer pairs 5036F, 5’ACGGCCGGGTGAGACAAATC-3’ (forward) and
5036R, 5’-TGGACCCGGACAACATCCTG-3’ (reverse)
for homolog MSMEG_5036; 4904F, 5’-ACGCCGGATGGAAGTATCTG-3’ (forward) and 4904R, 5’-ACACCGGAATCGAAGATCCC-3’ (reverse) for homolog
MSMEG_4904 were used. Primers were synthesized by
IDT (Leuven, Belgium).

[GenBank: L28755] of P. stuartii were obtained from
GenBank [62]. These sequences were used as queries in
BLAST-searches for rhomboid homologs from an array
of mycobacterial genome databases: “tuberculist” [63],
GIB-DDBJ [64] and J. Craig Venter institute [65].
Sequence analysis

The similarity between mycobacterial rhomboids was
determined using specialized BLAST bl2seq for comparing two or more sequences [66]. Multiple sequence
alignments were performed with ClustalW [67] or MUSCLE [68]. Mycobacterial rhomboids were examined for
the presence of rhomboid family domains and catalytic
signatures (GxSx). The TMH predictions were done
using the TMHMM Server v. 2.0 [69]. The data generated was fed into the TMRPres2D [70] database to generate high resolution images. Cellular localization signals
were predicted using TargetP 1.1 server [71].
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA4 software [72]. The evolutionary history of mycobacterial
rhomboids was determined using the Neighbor-Joining
method. The percentage of replicate trees in which the
associated taxa clustered together was determined using
the Bootstrap test (1000 replicates). The evolutionary
distances were computed using the Poisson correction
method and are in the units of the number of amino
acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps
and missing data were eliminated from the dataset
(complete deletion option). For comparison of evolutionary history, trees were also constructed using “Minimum Evolution” and “Maximum Parsimony”.
Functional predictions

To predict possible roles for mycobacterial rhomboids,
sequences were analyzed at the KEGG database [51] for
the genome arrangement, presence of extra protein
domains, nature of gene clusters, orthologs and paralogs.
Other parameters used to glean functions from mycobacterial rhomboid sequences included analyzing their

topologies. To predict functional relatedness among
genes within mycobacterial rhomboid clusters,
sequences in the clusters were aligned by ClustalW, and
Neighbor-Joining trees deduced using default settings.

Additional material
Additional file 1: The topology and location of catalytic residues in
mycobacterial rhomboid protease 1 (Rv0110 orthologs). As in rho-1,
the catalytic residues are located in TMH4 (Gly199 and Ser201) and TMH6
(His254), while His145, His150 and Asn154 are in TMH2.
Additional file 2: The topology and location of catalytic residues in
rho-1 of Drosophila. As in mycobacterial rhomboid protease 1, the
catalytic residues are located in TMH4 (Gly199 and Ser201) and TMH6
(His254), while His145, His150 and Asn154 are in TMH2.
Additional file 3: The topology and location of catalytic residues in
mycobacterial rhomboid protease 2 (Rv1337 orthologs). The
orthologs of pathogenic mycobcateria formed six TMHs, with catalytic
residues in TMH4 (Gly199 and Ser201) and TMH6 (His254). His145, His150
and Asn154 are located in TMH2 as in rhomboid protease-1 (Rv0110
orthologs).
