Abstract
Background: Dengue (DEN) is an infectious disease caused by the DEN virus (DENV), which
belongs to the Flavivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae. It has a (+) sense RNA genome and is mainly
transmitted to humans by the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Dengue fever (DF) and dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are caused by one of four closely related virus serotypes (DENV-1,
DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4). Epidemiological and evolutionary studies have indicated that host
and viral factors are involved in determining disease outcome and have proved the importance of
viral genotype in causing severe epidemics. Host immune status and mosquito vectorial capacity are
also important influences on the severity of infection. Therefore, an understanding of the
relationship between virus variants with altered amino acids and high pathogenicity will provide
more information on the molecular epidemiology of DEN. Accordingly, knowledge of the DENV
serotypes and genotypes circulating in the latest DEN outbreaks around the world, including
Mexico, will contribute to understanding DEN infections.
Results: 1. We obtained 88 isolates of DENV, 27 from Oaxaca and 61 from Veracruz. 2. Of these
88 isolates, 16 were serotype 1; 62 serotype 2; 7 serotype 3; and 2 serotype 4. One isolate had 2
serotypes (DENV-2 and -1). 3. Partial nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding C- prM (14
sequences), the NS3 helicase domain (7 sequences), the NS5 S-adenosyl methionine transferase
domain (7 sequences) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain (18 sequences)
were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed that DENV-2 isolates belonged to the Asian/
American genotype. In addition, the Asian/American genotype was divided into two clusters, one

containing the isolates from 2001 and the other the isolates from 2005–2006 with high bootstrap
support of 94%.
Conclusion: DENV-2 was the predominant serotype in the DF and DHF outbreak from 2005 to
2006 in Oaxaca State as well as in the 2006 outbreak in Veracruz State, with the Asian/American
genotype prevalent in both states. Interestingly, DENV-1 and DENV-2 were the only serotypes
related to DHF cases. In contrast, DENV-3 and DENV-4 were poorly represented according to
epidemiological data reported in Mexico. We found that isoleucine was replaced by valine at
residue 106 of protein C in the isolates from these 2005–2006 outbreaks and in those from the
1997, 1998 and 2001 outbreaks in the Caribbean islands. We suggested that this amino acid change
may be used as a signature for isolates arising in the Caribbean islands and pertaining to the Asian/
American genotype. Other amino acid changes are specific for the Asian/American, Asian and
American strains.

Background
DF and DHF/DSS are mosquito-borne infectious diseases
transmitted by the vector Ae. Aegypti and have become a
major global health concern. This mosquito vector is
endemic in several regions of Mexico, especially the South
Pacific Coast [1-3]. DF and DHF/DSS occur in tropical and
sub-tropical regions around the world, predominantly in
urban and suburban areas. The illness is endemic in more
than 100 cities in Africa, America, the Mediterranean
region and Southeast Asia [4]. Fifty million people are
infected every year; approximately 500,000 of them are
hospitalized and between 5% and 15% die [5]. This viral
illness is characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms
including high fever, severe headaches, extreme myalgias
and arthralgias, retro-orbital pain, anorexia, gastrointestinal disturbances, exanthema, nausea and vomiting; a rash
may appear three or four days after the fever begins [6,7].
The infection caused by any of the four serotypes of DENV
confers specific permanent immunity to the virus but does
not protect against the other serotypes [8]; however, shortterm cross-immunity against the other three serotypes has
been reported [9]. People living in an endemic area can be
infected with any of the four serotypes of DENV and can
even be simultaneously infected by two serotypes [10].
The relevance to pathology of the serotype and genotype
of the infecting strain has been described several times
[11-13].
The increase in the number of DHF and DSS cases worldwide is not fully understood. It was first explained by
mutations making DENV more virulent, but this hypothesis has not been supported. Then, the "secondary infection" or "immune enhancement" hypothesis was
proposed to explain the increased virulence of DENV in
patients with secondary infections. This hypothesis is still
favoured [14]. However, observations in Southeast Asia,
some Pacific islands and the Americas are not consistent
with it, so it has been modified several times. Advances in
molecular biology have led to the recognition that some

viral strains are more virulent than others [11-13]. The
introduction of DHF into Cuba in 1981 was linked to the
arrival of a Southeast Asian strain of DENV-2 on the island
[15]. Subsequently, an extended outbreak of DHF/DSS
occurred in Venezuela and Mexico, and this was linked to
the introduction of the same Southeast Asian strain of
DENV-2 [16,17]. Furthermore, a major epidemic of DF
due to DENV-2 with the American genotype was reported
in Peru in 1995, about 5 years after an epidemic of DENV1 [18]. The American DENV-2 genotype strains may have
lacked the properties necessary to cause severe disease.
The American genotype has been associated with mild disease (DF), while the Southeast Asian genotype coincided
with the appearance of DHF on the American continent
[11]. On this basis, viral virulence and immune responses
have been considered two major factors in the pathogenesis of DHF.
Early phylogenetic studies organized DENV sequences
into clusters on trees and classified them into a series of
genotypes or subtypes [19-22]. Within DENV-2, six genotypes have been proposed, five of which occur in humans
[22,23]. Although the Asian/American genotype originated in Southeast Asia and spread to the Americas in the
early 1980s [22], the strains phylogenetically classified as
Asian I and Asian II are currently restricted to Southeast
Asia [24]; the American genotype is mostly found in the
Americas and its frequency is now decreasing; and the
Cosmopolitan genotype is widely distributed across the
tropical and subtropical world [24,25]. DENV-1 consists
of five subtypes (I-V) [22]. The DENV-3 and -4 viruses are
currently classified into four and two genotypes, respectively [19,20].
As mentioned above, DENV genotypes differ in virulence,
including their human pathogenicities and epidemic
potential. Therefore, phylogenetic studies were conducted
to determine the epidemic potential of DENV isolates
from Veracruz and Oaxaca. These studies were carried out
using partial sequences of the genes encoding C-prM, NS5

and NS3. C and prM were chosen because they represent
a region that is commonly analyzed in studies of the
molecular epidemiology of DEN [17,26]. NS5 and NS3
are important because they may be useful for determining
the genotype and may help us to establish additional specific genetic markers. Also, NS5 has more nucleotide substitutions [27] and five of the eight amino acid differences
between the American and Asian genotypes are located in
the N terminus of this protein [12]. The RdRp of NS5 is
crucial for viral RNA replication. NS5 also contains an
MTase domain that is essential for the interaction with
RdRp required for virus replication and/or infectivity [28].
In addition, NS5 has been used thoroughly in studies of
flavivirus phylogenies [29,30].
The interdomain (linker) region 169–179 of NS3 and the
two loops that encircle the entrance of the ATP binding
pocket [31] were also studied because of the role of this
protein in virus replication. This region has also been
implicated in the intrinsic flexibility that couples movements between the NS3 protease and helicase domains
[32].
In summary, phylogenetic and genetic analyses of Oaxaca
and Veracuz virus isolates reveal the putative geographic
origins of the viruses and potential molecular determinants of virulence.

Results
Virus isolation and serotyping
The Mac-Elisa test has been implemented by the Ministry
of Health in Mexico for diagnosing DENV infections [33].
Patients whose clinical reports show symptoms of DHF
are exclusively evaluated using an IgG-ELISA kit. Reported
cases are under-notified and the circulating serotype is not
widely known. Analysis of the circulating serotype is
important since it has been observed that DEN cases in
Mexico are increasing annually (Figure 1). This Figure also
shows that the percentage of DHF cases has increased in
comparison to DF cases [34].

The serotypes of 88 DENV samples from different sites in
Oaxaca and Veracruz States, Mexico (Figure 2) were evaluated and the results are shown in Figure 3. Serotyping
was performed by RT-PCR using the RNA obtained from
isolates in C6/36 cells; each test to determine serotype was
repeated at least twice. C6/36 cells were chosen because
the nucleotide sequence of the virus genome is conserved
[35,36].
Out of 27 isolates from Oaxaca, 18 were diagnosed with
DHF; 12 were serotype 2 and six were serotype 1 (Table 1).
Among the 61 isolates obtained from patient sera in Veracruz State, fifteen with DHF were serotype 2, two were
serotype 1 and the isolate VER/MEX013A/06 showed both
serotypes 1 and 2.

phylogenetic study. These strains are from Caribbean countries and are grouped in the same branch as the sequences of our
isolates corresponding to the Asian/American genotype.

Out of a total of 52 isolates with DF, 35 were serotype 2,
seven serotype 3, eight serotype 1 and two serotype 4
(Table 1). Known strains of DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4 were
used as positive controls for the RT-PCR assays.
Figure 3 shows the percentages of cases of DENV-1 (22%,
16%), DENV-2 (67%, 72%) and DENV-3 (11%, 6%) in
Oaxaca and Veracruz respectively; DENV-4 cases had the
lowest percentages (0%, 3%). These values were consistent in both States.
Phylogenetic analysis of Oaxaca isolates
Portions of the C91-prM1, NS573, NS52206 and NS3484
genes were amplified and sequenced as described in the
Methods section. Fourteen sequences were obtained from
8 isolates from Oaxaca and 6 from Veracruz for the C-prM

fragment (11 with DF and 3 with DHF); 7 sequences were
obtained from 5 Oaxaca isolates and 2 from Veracruz isolates for the MTase domain (NS573) fragment (4 with DF
and 3 with DHF); 18 sequences were obtained from 7
Oaxaca isolates and 11 from Veracruz isolates for the
RdRp domain (NS573) fragment (12 with DF and 6 with
DHF); 7 sequences were obtained from 7 Oaxaca isolates
for the helicase domain fragment (6 with DF and 1 with
DHF).
Phylogenetic analysis was then performed on these
sequences, including other prototype sequences of characterized isolates for DENV-2 (Table 2, 3).
This analysis showed that C91-prM1, NS575 and NS3484 in
the DENV-2 isolates from Oaxaca and Veracruz were most

closely related to strains from the Caribbean islands Cuba,
Dominican Republic and Martinique (Figure 4). The phylogenetic tree for NS575 and NS3484 is not shown. The
strains from Brazil, Venezuela and Jamaica formed an

different clade from those obtained in 2005–2006, with a
high bootstrap support of 94%.
Phylogenetic analysis of NS52206 gave a somewhat different pattern: essentially, the isolates belonged to the same
clade as those from Venezuela, Brazil and Jamaica and
were distinct from the Caribbean islands isolates (Figure
5). Bootstrap support was maintained in this analysis.
All the genotypes clustered in separate branches with high
bootstrap support, as previously shown in phylogenetic
analysis of other virus sequences [25,17,37]. Our analysis
supports the view that the Asian/American strains are phylogenetically different from the main Asian and American
genotypes.

Most of the amino acid (aa) differences were associated

&Amino acid sequence was numbered starting from protein NS5 or NS3 to the end of the last codon sequenced.

44 aa). In addition, phylogenetic analysis of NS3484
showed low variability (1.9%, 2/103 aa). Tables 2 and 3
summarizes the aa changes among the Asian I, Asian II,
Cosmopolitan, American and American/Asian Genotype
viruses. We compared the aas related to C91-prM1, NS575,
NS52206 and NS3484 in all Southeast Asian genotype
viruses with American genotypes (Table 2 and 3). The
former have greater potential to cause DHF while the latter are associated with DF [18,25]. The Oaxaca isolates in
this study and all genotypes with potential to produce
DHF contained valine at position 145 in C-prM (prM-31),
except for the isolate S707OAX05/MEX, which contained
threonine at this position as did in the American genotype. In addition, the Oaxaca isolates in this study and all
genotypes with potential to produce DHF contained isoleucine, lysine and glutamine at positions 179, 192 and
818 respectively in NS5. In contrast, the American genotype had valine, arginine and leucine at these positions.
Frequency analysis included in addition to the sequences
of Table 2, one sequence with Asian II genotype
(M29095) and twelve with Cosmopolitan genotype

DQ448233,
DQ448234,
AB189123,
DQ448235, DQ448236, DQ448237, AB111454). In
addition to the sequences in Table 3, it was included 9

(EU570976,
EU552540,

EF595827) from Veracruz and 1 (EF595826) from Oaxaca
in RdPd domain; and 1(EF591291) from Oaxaca in the
Helicase domains.
Interestingly, the Oaxaca isolates in this study and the
Caribbean islands strains contained valine at position 106
in C91-prM1 with a frequency of 0.65 in the Asian/Ameri-

can genotype, while all other genotypes had isoleucine at
this position (Table 2). All American/Asian viruses had
valine, alanine and glycine at positions 104 (C), 112 (C)
and 129 (prM-14), respectively, with a frequency of 1, and
isoleucine at position 153 (prM-39) with a frequency of
0.95 because HUAT2/MEX/01 had leucine at this position. The Cosmopolitan genotype had valine and alanine
at positions 104 and 112 with a frequency of 0.67 and
0.61, respectively (Table 2). American viruses had lysine
and threonine at positions 142 (prM-28) and 145 (prM31) respectively, with a frequency of 1. Three isolates from
Oaxaca 2001 also contained lysine at position 142 (prM28), resulting in a frequency of 0.075 in the Asian/American genotype. Asian I genotype viruses had serine and isoleucine at positions 101 (C) and 130 (prM-15) with
frequencies of 1 and 0.73 respectively. The other genotypes did not contain these amino acids. Cosmopolitan
viruses had methionine and asparagine at positions 108
and 143 (prM-29) with a frequency of 0.44 in this genotype. The other genotypes did not contain this aa.
The American/Asian genotype viruses contained isoleucine, lysine, threonine, alanine and valine at positions
155, 748, 762, 810 and 835 in NS5 (Table 3) with a frequency of 1 for positions 155 and 748 and 0.96 for the
positions 762, 810 and 835 (Table 3). Asian I contained
the same aa at position 762 with a very low frequency of
0.035 in this genotype. Interestingly, our analysis showed
that the Asian I genotype, unlike the others, had alanine
at position 864 in NS5 rather than threonine with a frequency of 1 (Table 3). Furthermore, the American genotype had valine, arginine, serine and leucine with a
frequency of 1 at positions 179, 192, 799 and 818 in NS5;
none of the other genotypes has these aas at these positions, resulting in a frequency of 0 (Table 3).

Minimal 5
Minimal evolutional tree of DENV-2 derived from
NS52206 gene. The tree was constructed as described in Figure 4. The isolates from Veracruz and Oaxaca clustered in
the Asian/American genotype. DENV-1, 3 and 4 were used as
outgroups.

American/Asian and Cosmopolitan genotypes had
arginine at position 187 with a frequency of 1 in NS3
(Table 3). Oaxaca isolates had lysine and threonine at
positions 249 and 250 in NS3 with frequencies of 0.33
and 0.38. Oaxaca and Veracruz isolates had valine and
proline at positions 26 in NS5 and 784 in NS5 with frequencies of 0.33 and 0.56 respectively in the Asian/American genotype. Lysine at position 249 in NS3 may be
signature of the Oaxaca strains, and valine and proline at
positions 26 and 784 in NS5 may be signatures for the
Oaxaca and Veracruz strains.
It is evident that the genotypically different strains contain
specific aas that may be used as genotype markers.

Discussion
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) led a
campaign to exterminate Ae. aegypti, which resulted in the
eradication of YF and disappearance of DF in America. Ae.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/117

aegypti was absent from Mexico in 1947 until 1970.
Because the mosquito was not completely exterminated in
America and the campaigns were gradually relaxed, Ae.
aegypti reappeared in most countries. There was a DENV1 outbreak in Mexico in 1978 and epidemics spread
throughout the country. The first reports of outbreaks of
DENV-2 were in 1981 and 1984, with 30,000 and 23,000
cases respectively. There were 8 reported DHF cases and 4
deaths associated with DENV-4 in Mexico in 1984. Four
DHF cases and one death were reported in 1989 and 2
cases in 1991. DENV-1, -2 and -4 were isolated in 1994,
and DENV-3 was reported in 1995. Furthermore, DENV1, -2, -3 and -4 were isolated in 1997 [34]. This data shows
that even when DENV serotypes were co-circulating in
Mexico, DHF cases were rare, suggesting that simultaneous circulation of several serotypes (hyperendemicity) is
not necessarily sufficient to cause DHF epidemics in the
absence of highly virulent strains, as previously reported
[18]. Interestingly, the DENV-2 American genotype was
replaced by the Asian/American genotype over this
period. DF and DHF epidemics increased dramatically in
the closing decades of the 20th century, especially in the
New World, and Mexico was not excluded [34]. Furthermore, in south Texas (US), all dengue serotypes have circulated periodically, but locally acquired DHF has been
recently reported [38]. The causes of this increased incidence of DENV infection, apart from the introduction of
the DENV-2 Asian genotype, include demographic, cultural, environmental and political changes. This is clearly
shown in Figure 1; DF and DHF cases have increased significantly since 2001 [34]. Furthermore, the proportion of
DHF to DF cases has also increased (Figure 1), as in Thailand, where three DENV-2 genotypes have circulated but
only viruses assigned to Asian genotype I have been sampled from the population since 1991 [25]. The genotype
distribution in Mexico is mostly unknown; consequently,
it is very important for epidemiological studies to determine the serotypes and genotypes of the viruses circulating in this country to contribute to the knowledge of
geographic distribution, evolution and dispersion of
DENV; besides, knowing the virus genotype may allow
doctors to judge the risk of DHF to the patient. This may
also be useful for laboratory diagnosis, which is an issue
of serious concern in all endemic countries; diagnosis may
well help in the rigorous follow-up of patients and could
save them from the most severe DEN infection (DSS) and
death.
Our results showed that DHF was associated with DENV1 and -2 and one case showed both serotypes (Table 1).
Interestingly, we observed no DHF cases associated with
DENV-3, as has been shown in epidemiological studies in
Mexico [39]. Recently, DENV-3 has been isolated in Brazil
but its association with DHF has not been clearly established [40]. In contrast, DENV-3 was associated with DHF

in an outbreak in Cuba [13]. Phylogenetic analysis using
portions of C91-prM1, NS575, NS52206 and NS3484 showed
no substantial differences (Figures 4, 5).
In this study, we detected the amino acids glutamic acid
and valine in place of lysine and threonine at positions 28
and 31 in prM. These aas have been described as specific
for the Asian strains correlated with DHF [12]. NS5 also
contains lysine 46, arginine 47 and glutamic acid 49 in the
MTase domain, essential for the interaction with RdRp
required for virus replication and/or infectivity [28]. These
three aas are conserved in all sequences of all strains or
isolates.
We detected lysine and glutamine at positions 800 and
819 of NS5; these have been reported as markers of the
Asian and Asian/American DENV-2 genotypes that have
the potential to produce DHF [12]. The interdomain
(linker) region 169–179 and the two loops that encircle
the entrance of the ATP binding pocket of NS3 [31] were
also studied because of the role of this protein in virus replication. This region has also been implicated in the
intrinsic flexibility required to couple movements
between the NS3 protease and helicase domains [31,32].
We found no change in these amino acids. However, at
position 250 in the helicase domain, alanine (apolar) was
replaced by threonine (polar) in the isolates in this study
and in one strain from China (Table 3). It would seem
important to study the structure of this region to determine whether this aa has any role in the enzymatic activity
or in maintaining the protein structure.
The NS5 polymerase fragment (737 to 877 residues) contains conserved aas: cysteine at position 847, which participates in the zinc pocket; threonine 790 to aspartic acid
808 and arginine 815 in the priming loop motif; and
arginine 737, threonine 794, tryptophan 795 and serine
796, which are involved in GTP binding. However, the aa
at position 810 in the priming loop is changed from threonine (polar) to alanine (apolar) in the Asian/American
strains including our isolates (Table 3). It would seem
important in the future to study the structure around this
region to determine the function of this amino acid, particularly whether it has any role in polymerase activity
[41].
A dramatic observation was obtained from the analysis of
longitudinally sampled data on a temporal scale, where
individual lineages or entire clades of viruses frequently
arise, persist for a period of time and then disappear
[42,43]. All strains analyzed in this work clustered in one
branch with the Asian/American strains. Previously, in a
survey during 2001 by the Department of Health [17,33],
we reported this genotype in isolates from Oaxaca on the
basis of the protein C sequence and a fragment of the prM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/117

gene (438–572). The finding of the same Asian/American
genotype in the isolates from the 2005 and 2006 outbreaks indicates that they circulated and became prevalent
in Oaxaca and Veracruz States; however, the isolates in
this study were grouped with the strains from the Caribbean islands, and the 2001 isolates with the Jamaica
strain, with a high consistency of 94%. Also, these 2005–
2006 isolates from Oaxaca and Veracruz showed valine in
position 106 in prM, which was also shown by the Caribbean islands strains. These isolates also clustered with the
Caribbean islands strains Cuba 97, Dominican Republic
2001 and Martinique 98 in the phylogenetic analysis of
NS575 and NS3484 (results not shown), supporting this
view of their geographic origin (Figure 2). All trees clearly
distinguish among the five genotypes of DENV-2, as
reported previously [24,25], with strong bootstrap support (Figures 4, 5). Little is known of the history of this
American/Asian signature circulating in the Caribbean
islands. However, Rodriguez-Roche et al. [44] found that
clinical severity increased over time during the epidemics
expressed by a higher ratio DHF to DF for the Cuban
strains.
Apparently, there has been a clade replacement of the
American genotype for the Asian/American genotype originated in Southeast Asia in Oaxaca (2001 outbreak) and
lately that strains were substituted for the Oaxaca strains
(2005–2006 outbreaks) with the probable origin in the
Caribbean islands, possibly Cuba (1997 outbreak). Furthermore, the geographic origin of the Veracruz strains
may be also the Caribbean islands.
Since analysis of the 98 C-prM sequences showed that all
Asian/American viruses had valine, alanine, glycine and
isoleucine at positions 129 (prM-14) and 153 (prM-39)
with a frequency of 1, while none of the other genotypes
had these aas, they may be used as signatures of this genotype. The signature for American genotype viruses may
be threonine at position 145 (prM-31) since none of the
other genotypes had this amino acid. The signature for the
Asian I genotype viruses may be serine at position 101 (C)
with a frequency of 1.
From the 65 (MTase) and 76 (RdRp) sequences analyzed,
all Asian/American genotype viruses contained isoleucine, lysine, threonine, alanine, lysine and valine at positions 155, 748, 762, 810 and 835 (Table 3) and none of
the other genotypes had these aas. Our analysis also
showed that the Asian I genotype, unlike the others, had
alanine at position 864 (RdRp). The American genotype
had valine, arginine, serine and leucine with frequency of
1 at positions179, 192, 799 and 818, but none of the
DENV-2 genotypes had it. All aas specific for a genotype
may be used as signatures for that genotype. Although
fewer sequences were analyzed than for C-prM, because

these genes have been less studied and consequently fewer
sequences have been reported. The Asian 2 and Cosmopolitan genotypes showed no specific signature in the
present study. This may be attributable to the broad spectrum of the Cosmopolitan genotype strains and the low
number of Asian 2 sequences reported.

2005–2006. We also identified amino acids encoded in
C91-prM1, NS575, NS52206 and NS3484 that are specific to
the Asian/American strains; and one amino acid specific
to the isolates of this study and the Caribbean islands
strains. These aas may be used as markers of genotypes
and geographic origins.

Lysine at position 249 in NS3 may be signature of the
Oaxaca strains, and valine and proline at positions 26 and
784 in NS5 may be signatures for the Oaxaca and Veracruz
strains, since none of the other genotypes or strains from
the Asian/American genotype had these aas.

Methods

Some of the observed changes in the viruses could be due
to mosquito adaptation as well as to the vertebrate hosts,
since there is evidence that strains of DENV-2 may differ
in their ability to infect Ae. aegypti [45], perhaps through
specific virus-cell receptor interactions [46,47] by strong
selection, or competition between DENV serotypes [48]. It
has been suggested that the Asian genotype may spread
more readily because it infects Ae. aegypti mosquitoes
more efficiently than the American genotype [45].
The amino acid changes between the isolates of this study
and those from 2001 may be due to a high mutation rate
[49] or recombination [50] contributing to the generation
of new biologically successful strains.
Phylogenetic analysis of the C91-prM1, NS575, NS52206 and
NS3484 sequences in the DENV-2 isolates demonstrated
that the Asian/American genotype is circulating in Oaxaca
and Veracruz, showing specific amino acid changes that
may be used successfully as genotype markers. Differences
in the NS52206 tree, which showed that the isolates in this
study clustered with the strains from the contained American genotype, may be due to the low variability of this
domain. In addition, this analysis shows a clear correlation between genetic diversity and geographical location.
As has been suggested previously [43,51], viral dispersion
may play a significant role in generating new varieties and
effects on people who contract the illness.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that DENV-1, -2 and -3 are circulating in Oaxaca and DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4 in Veracruz
(2006), resulting in many DHF cases (Figure 1, 3). Eight
DHF cases were associated with DENV-1, 27 with DENV2 and one case with both DENV-1 and -2. The origin of the
isolates in this study appears to be linked to the signature
from the Caribbean islands genotypes. Our results confirm that DHF is endemic in Oaxaca and Veracruz States
and that the presence of the DENV-2 Asian/American genotype and DENV-1 contributes to the increased number of
DHF cases, a finding linked to the epidemiological data
showing an increase in the ratio of DHF to DF cases in

Viruses
The strains of DENV used in this study were: DENV-1
Hawaii; DENV-2 New Guinea C (NGC); DENV-3 H-87;
and DENV-4 H-341. These strains were provided by Dr. D.
J. Gubler (Division of Vector-borne Infectious Diseases,
Center for Disease Control, Fort Collins, CO, USA) and
kindly provided by Dr. Blanca Ruiz (Biomedicas, UNAM).
Isolates of DENV-2 viruses were obtained from acutephase plasma collected from patients with DF or DHF by
the Secretaria de Salud in Oaxaca, Mexico during 2005–
2006, and by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social
(IMSS) during 2006. Twenty-nine isolates were kindly
provided by the State of Oaxaca Public Health Laboratory
and 65 by the IMSS in Veracruz. These were anonymous
samples; only information about the clinical disease associated with the respective infection was provided (Tables
1).
DENV infected cells and virus isolation
Ae. albopictus clone C6/36 cells were grown at 28°C. After
18 h of culture, cells (2 × 106/100 mm plate) were infected
with 0.2 ml DENV-2 inoculum with an input MOI of 600
PFU/cell and were incubated at 28°C for 10 days.

Viruses were isolated as previously described [17] with a
few modifications. After 18 h of culture, C6/36 cells (106/
15 ml tube) were infected with 0.01 to 0.1 ml of serum
specimen per tube, diluted to 1 ml with medium, and
incubated for 2 h at 28°C. After one wash, 3 ml MEM was
added and the cells were cultivated for approximately 15
days at 28°C (passage number 1). Cells were observed
every day and when a cytophatic effect was apparent from
syncytium formation and cellular lysis, the cells were harvested and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet
was suspended in 0.6 ml of MEM and stored in aliquots of
0.15 ml at -70°C. The supernatant (approximately 2.5 ml)
was stored in 2 aliquots of 1 ml and one of 0.5 ml at 70°C. To obtain passage numbers two and three, C6/36
cells were incubated with 1 ml of the supernatant
obtained from the first or second passage for 2 h at 28°C
and the same procedure described above was followed.
Serotypes in all samples were determined in the isolates
obtained from the first, second or third culture passages.
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant
using Trisol® LS (Gibco BRL., Gaithersburg, Md.) accord-

ing to the manufacturer's recommendations. Ethanol-precipitated RNA was recovered by centrifugation and airdried. The RNA pellet was suspended in 50 μl water
treated with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC, Sigma-Aldrich)
and used as template for Reverse Transcription with the
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)
The RT-PCR protocol described by Seah et al. [52] was followed to determine the DENV serotype. Reaction mixtures were stored at -20°C pending further processing.

Synthetic oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed on
the basis of published sequence data for DENV strains
16681, New Guinea C and Jamaica 1409 to amplify and
partially sequence the following genes: protein C from
nucleotides 91 to 351(C91); prM from nucleotides 1 to
123 (prM1) [17]; NS5 from nucleotides 73 to 588 (NS573)
and 2206 to 2613 (NS52206); and NS3 from nucleotides
484 to 786 (NS3484). All assays were performed using the
ThermoScript™ RT-PCR System containing PlatinumR Taq
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies). A mixture of 5 μl total
RNA (0.1–0.5 μg), 50 ng of hexamers/reaction and DEPCtreated water (total volume 50 μl) was incubated at 85°C
for 5 min and chilled on ice. The first extension was carried out at 25°C for 10 min and then at 50°C for 70 min.
The PCR reaction was carried out by incubation of 50
pmol of the corresponding sense and antisense PCR primers, 2 μl of the cDNA synthesis reaction mixture and 2.4
mM magnesium sulfate as per the manufacturer's recommendations.
To amplify the NS5 gene we used the sense primer from
nucleotides 7398–7413 (CAT GGG CNY TNT GYGA) and
the antisense primer from nucleotides 10551–10570
(GGA GGG GTC TCC TCT AACC). The PCR conditions for
amplifying the 2700 bp fragment for NS5 were: 95°C for
5 min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 49°C for 30 s, 72°C
for 2 min 30 s, and final extension of 72°C for 10 min followed by storage at 4°C.
Sequencing of PCR fragments
For automated sequencing, spin column-purified (Quiagen, Chatsworth, CA.) DNA fragments were analyzed by
the cycle-sequencing dye terminator method. A Big Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (ABIPRISM 100, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was chosen and sequencing was conducted using an Applied
Biosystems Prism 310 in a short capillary (47 cm by 50
μm inside diameter), and Performance Optimized Polymer 6 (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems).

Phylogenetic analyses
Neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum parsimony and minimal evolutionary [53] analysis methods were used to
reconstruct phylogeny. Distance with gamma correction
was generated by Neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood
and Tamura and Nei [54] evolutionary models. Support
for the derived phylogenies was examined with bootstrapping over 1000 replications. For all DENV-2 analyses,
DENV-1, -3 and -4 were used as outgroups. All these analyses were performed using MEGA V4 [55].

Authors' contributions
