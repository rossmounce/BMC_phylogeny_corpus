Abstract
Background: The retention of ancestral juvenile characters by adult stages of descendants is
called paedomorphosis. However, this process can mislead phylogenetic analyses based on
morphological data, even in combination with molecular data, because the assessment if a character
is primary absent or secondary lost is difficult. Thus, the detection of incongruence between
morphological and molecular data is necessary to investigate the reliability of simultaneous analyses.
Different methods have been proposed to detect data congruence or incongruence. Five of them
(PABA, PBS, NDI, LILD, DRI) are used herein to assess incongruence between morphological and
molecular data in a case study addressing salamander phylogeny, which comprises several
supposedly paedomorphic taxa. Therefore, previously published data sets were compiled herein.
Furthermore, two strategies ameliorating effects of paedomorphosis on phylogenetic studies were
tested herein using a statistical rigor. Additionally, efficiency of the different methods to assess
incongruence was analyzed using this empirical data set. Finally, a test statistic is presented for all
these methods except DRI.
Results: The addition of morphological data to molecular data results in both different positions
of three of the four paedomorphic taxa and strong incongruence, but treating the morphological
data using different strategies ameliorating the negative impact of paedomorphosis revokes these
changes and minimizes the conflict. Of these strategies the strategy to just exclude paedomorphic
character traits seem to be most beneficial. Of the three molecular partitions analyzed herein the
RAG1 partition seems to be the most suitable to resolve deep salamander phylogeny. The rRNA
and mtDNA partition are either too conserved or too variable, respectively. Of the different
methods to detect incongruence, the NDI and PABA approaches are more conservative in the
indication of incongruence than LILD and PBS.
Conclusion: Paedomorphosis induces strong conflicts and can mislead the phylogenetic analyses
even in combined analyses. However, different strategies are efficiently minimizing these problems.
Though the exploration of different methods to detect incongruence is preferable NDI and PABA
are more conservative than the others and NDI is computational less extensive than PABA.

Background
The amount of molecular and morphological data used in
phylogenetic reconstructions is steadily increasing in the
past decades [e.g., [1,2]]. Thus, phylogenies based on mul-

tiple data sets (i.e., partitions) bearing on both molecular
and morphological data are common nowadays [e.g., [24]]. However, conclusions regarding phylogenetic relationships based on either morphological or molecular

data do not always result in congruent phylogenies [e.g.,
[2,5-7,7-12]]. Molecular evolutionary events like genome
fusion, gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, heterotachy or gene extinction or saturation and model misspecifications disconnect gene trees in part from species
trees [e.g., [13-18]]. On the other hand, in morphological
data sets signal-like pattern due to other processes than
speciation can also occur and thus disconnect species trees
from morphological trees. The assessment of absent characters is especially difficult for morphological characters:
Have they never evolved in these species or are they secondary lost [e.g., [19-21]]? The problem of primary
absence or secondary loss is well known for taxa of supposedly paedomorphic origin [2,22]. The retention of
ancestral juvenile characters by adult stages of descendants is called paedomorphosis [23,24]. Paedomorphosis
can arise either by a retardation of somatic development
(neoteny) or by an acceleration of sexual maturation (progenesis) [23]. Thus, such adults lack several characters
exhibited in adults of non-paedomorphic sister taxa.
Paedomorphic evolution has been assumed for several
taxa from different metazoan clades such as polychaetes
or tetrapods [e.g., [2,6,7,22,25-36]]. However, usually
always the reconstruction of their phylogenetic position is
hampered using morphological data due to the absence of
comparable adult character traits [see [2,22]]. Molecular
data nearly always result in different phylogenetic positions [see [2,22]]. Comparing incongruent branches from
molecular and morphological data sets and examining the
evolution of individual morphological characters Wiens
et al. [2] showed the problems in morphological cladistic
analyses of paedomorphic taxa. However, the strength of
the conflict induced by paedomorphosis was not assessed
by any statistical or methodological means. In their combined analyses strategies were adopted to circumvent the
problems introduced by paedomorphosis. Wiens et al. [2]
coded the adult morphology of paedomorphic taxa as
unknown, because adult, sexually mature stages of paedomorphic and non-paedomorphic species are not comparable ontogenetic stages. Though this strategy might be
overly conservative by deleting characters not affected by
paedomorphosis Wiens et al. [2] favoured this strategy
over another strategy, which was also adopted by them as
well as other authors [e.g., [33]]. This second strategy
excludes supposed paedomorphic character traits. However, this means that paedomorphic character traits must
be identified a priori, which may be difficult. Furthermore,
Wiens et al. [2] showed that other character traits such as
bone structures can also have a negative influence on
reconstructions of phylogenetic trees due to convergent
adaptation to the same aquatic habitat or the lack of metamorphosis and thus of 'adult' apomorphies. However,
priority of the first strategy over the second one was not
tested using a statistical rigor.

Salamanders provide a good and actually the only model
system to date to analyze the impact of paedomorphosis
on phylogenetic reconstructions. Only a few other metazoan taxa have similar numbers of paedomorphic taxa.
However, none of them is adequate for such a study in the
moment. For example, the dorvilleid annelids have several paedomorphic genera, which are most times very
small in size with less than one mm [9,22]. Eibye-Jacobsen & Kristensen [9] conducted thorough morphological
cladistic analyses covering all dorvilleid genera. However,
their data set contained only 38 characters in contrast to
the 326 morphological characters of Wiens et al. [2]. Furthermore, it cannot be expected that this number can be
increased much more, because the matrix of the dorvilleids is already comprehensive regarding the number of
possible characters. Though first preliminary molecular
analyses based on rRNA genes indicate that strong incongruence between morphological and molecular data can
also be shown for paedomorphic dorvilleids [5-7,22] no
comprehensive molecular data set covering different
genes exist to date. Furthermore, the establishment of
such a data set cannot be expected in the near future due
to both the small size of some taxa and difficulties to collect some of the crucial genera. Besides the comprehensive
molecular data set of Wiens et al. [2] consisting of rRNA
data published by Larson and Dimmick [35] and their
RAG1 sequences Weisrock et al. [37] presented a comprehensive mtDNA data set in a recent study addressing the
utility of mitochondrial sequences for salamander phylogeny. This analysis also comprised the rRNA data published by Larson and Dimmick [35], but not the RAG1
data. Thus, both the most comprehensive morphological
and molecular data sets for metazoan taxa with paedomorphic species have been collected for salamanders.
Interestingly, all molecular analyses of Weisrock et al.
[37], including the individual rRNA analyses, recovered
phylogenies generally similar to each other, but quite different from the molecular tree presented by Wiens et al.
[2], who did not conduct individual analyses of their two
molecular partitions. Although Weisrock et al. [37] found
that mtDNA might not be able to resolve nodes deep in
salamander phylogeny I included their mtDNA nonetheless to further investigate the conflict between the molecular data sets as well as their contributions to combined
analyses. For example, can the combined molecular data
overwhelm the phylogenetic signal-like pattern in the
morphological data set due to paedomorphosis?
How to detect incongruence?
Thus, the development of tools to detect congruence or
incongruence (also called conflict) between partitions is
important to test the reliability of reconstructions using
concatenated data sets in simultaneous analyses [e.g., [3840]] and to guide the design of future studies. Albeit given
that the term phylogeny can have a far more general con-

notation, herein it is used for trees obtained from a data
matrix using a specific reconstruction method. Furthermore, I also acknowledge that conflict cannot only appear
between data sets and their corresponding trees, but also
to the fossil record, biogeography, scenarios of organ evolution, model specifications and so on. However, herein
conflict is restricted to incongruence between partitions.
Perhaps the most popular method for assessing incongruence in signal-like patterns across partitions is the Incongruence Length Difference (= ILD) test [[41], but see also
[42]]. Another recent approach testing for congruence
employs reciprocal Shimodaira and Hasegawa [[43], SH]
tests comparing trees obtained by different partitions or
combinations of partitions [e.g., [42,44,45]]. Both
approaches are global in that the overall topology is
tested. The taxa or nodes causing incongruence are not
revealed. Thus, the tests may be prone to reject congruence
between partitions even though the conflicting signal is
restricted to a limited number of nodes or taxa [e.g., [44]].
Therefore, employing taxon jackknifing procedures has
been suggested as a refinement for both tests [42,44]. This
successive taxon deletion approach may be useful for
detecting conflict due to a particular terminal node, but it
is not guaranteed to find conflict at internal nodes and
incongruence resulting from more than one or two terminal nodes [5].
The Relative Apparent Synapomorphy Analysis (RASA)
[46] has also been used to determine combinability and
phylogenetic signal of data matrices [47-49]. However,
Simmons et al. [50] showed that RASA is not able to detect
phylogenetic signal and thus in consequence also not congruence or incongruence. Furthermore, RASA does not
specify if certain sets of taxa cause the conflict or if the
conflict is more evenly distributed. Although usually
regarded as an alternative to simultaneous analyses of
concatenated partitions super tree or consensus tree methods can be used to investigate congruence between different partitions based on the trees obtained from analyses
of the individual partitions [e.g., [51]]. To further visualize the conflict at nodes phylogenetic networks instead of
trees can be employed [e.g., [52]]. However, trees
obtained only from single partition analyses might not
reveal the hidden support or conflict at some nodes,
which becomes apparent in simultaneous analyses [e.g.,
[40,53]]. Furthermore, these approaches do not provide
specific values, which can be compared between the
nodes.
Approaches utilizing a node-by-node procedure accompanied by specific values substantially increase insights into
sources of congruence and conflict. Herein I used
approaches based on two different nodal support measurements. The general rationale of these tests is that signal

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/22

from additional data will increase nodal support for a
given node if the evolutionary history of the node is congruent in the partitions. In contrast, incongruent evolutionary histories between partitions at a given node will
result in a decrease. Several authors investigated alterations of bootstrap (BP) support to identify the source of
congruent or incongruent signal [39,54-59]. However,
these investigations were not systematically conducted
and only nodes or partitions already suspected of conflict
or of a priori interest are considered. Reed and Sperling
[60] analyzed the effect of two partitions on the butterfly
genus Papilio phylogeny using differential weights for the
partitions. The BP support at each node was investigated
for trends as the weight of the EF1α partitions increased
relative to the COI/COII partition. However, such analyses are more or less restricted to bipartitioned data sets as
weighting schemes become increasingly complicated as
numbers of partitions increase and are less straightforward to be analyzed. O'Grady et al. [61] modified this
procedure by just downweighting a particular partition to
zero. Though proposed for a bipartitioned data set this
modification is easily adaptable for data sets with more
than two partitions. However, in data sets with only two
partitions the procedure of Reed and Sperling [60] is preferable over this modification and the Partition Addition
Bootstrap Alteration (PABA) approach of Struck et al. [5],
because the latter two are less likely to reveal trends in BP
support if only two partitions are defined. Struck et al. [5]
developed the PABA approach, which can expose congruence or incongruence, respectively, by examining methodologically the alteration (δ) of BP values at a given node
when additional data partitions are added. δ is examined
under all possible combinations of partition addition
(both number of partitions and order of addition) to elucidate how all partitions interact with each other:
PABAn = δn = BPA - BPB

(1)

with n being the order of addition (e.g., as 2nd, 3rd, 4th),
BPA is the BP support after addition of the partition and
BPB before addition. For example, partition C is added as
2nd in turn to each other partition in the data set and the
alteration of BP support is determined. Then partition C is
added as 3rd to all possible combinations of all other partitions comprising only two partitions and so on, till it is
added as the last partition to the combined data set of all
other partitions. This is repeated for each partition in the
data set and each node of interest, usually all nodes of the
best tree of the combined data set, but any node can be
analyzed. To condense the results the mean values of δ are
calculated for each partition and order of addition. Thus,
the PABA approach is a thorough investigation on a nodeby-node and partition-by-partition basis of BP alteration.
The principle of analyzing trends of nodal support alteration due to addition of partitions does not depend upon

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:22

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/22

BP values, but can be used for any nodal support measurement. For example, Bond and Hedin [62] implemented a
similar procedure using posterior probabilities. For several nodes of the combined data set they determined in
which combinations of partitions these nodes were also
present and if the posterior probabilities were above 0.90.
However, they did assess the actual alteration in posterior
probabilities in contrast to the PABA approach. Thus, they
utilized a qualitative instead of a quantitative approach.
Struck et al. [5] did not provide a procedure to determine
how significant the alteration of BP values actually is.
Herein, I propose such a procedure based on the generation of random partitions of the same size (see below)
[41,63].
Other approaches to investigate congruence or incongruence on a node-by-node basis use another measurement
of clade support. Bremer support (BS) values [64-66] were
proposed as measurements of support for nodes reconstructed in the most parsimonious tree(s) and thus are
equal to or larger than zero. For each node of this tree, the
difference in tree length (TL) between the most parsimonious tree and the most parsimonious alternative tree not
containing this particular node is determined. Additionally, the definition and use of BS has been extended
beyond the nodes obtained in the most parsimonious tree
[40,63,67] and thus the values can also be negative. BS
values can be calculated using the following general formula:
BS = TLalternative - TLnode

(2)

with TLnode being the tree length of the best tree containing
the node of interest and TLalternative being the best tree not
containing this node. TLnode can be determined running
analyses constraining the particular node and TLalternative
keeping only trees not agreeing with this constraint [e.g.,
[40,63-65,67]].
Based on the Bremer support [64-66] Baker and DeSalle
[68] developed the Partitioned Bremer Support (PBS),
which assesses the contribution of each partition to the BS
value of the combined analysis of all partitions [40]. Positive PBS values show that the partition is in agreement
with the node of interest, but negative values point to a
source of conflict. PBS values are calculated in a similar
manner as the BS values. As for the BS values the best tree
and the best alternative for each node are obtained using
the complete data set. However, each partition is separately optimized on these two trees and the difference in
tree length is calculated using Equation 2.
The Localized ILD (LILD) test [63] uses directly the BS values of individual partitions. For each node of the combined analysis, which was not recovered in the analysis of

an individual partition, Thornton and DeSalle [63] determined the BS value of that partition for that node. Therefore, they obtained only negative BS values. Herein, I used
an extended definition of the LILD test to include all
nodes regardless whether they were obtained in the analysis of an individual partition or not. In essence, these are
all the BS values of an individual partition for the set of
nodes analyzed and thus they can be positive, zero or negative.
In contrast to PBS and LILD, which are based on the analysis of individual partitions, the Nodal Data set Influence
(NDI) approach [40] determines the alteration of BS values at nodes as a partition is removed from the complete
data set. Thus, NDI not only assesses the contribution of
the individual partition to the BS support of the combined
data set, but also the contribution the partition brings out
of the other partitions in simultaneous analyses [40]. NDI
is in its calculation similar to the highest order of partition
addition in PABA. As mentioned above, PABA does not
depend on the nature of the nodal support measurement.
Therefore, besides NDI I also determined the alteration of
BS values at lower orders of partition addition (i.e., as 2nd
and 3rd). In accordance with PABA this approach is called
Partition Addition Bremer Support Alteration (PABSA)
and for a total of four partitions PABSA4 is synonymous
with NDI:
NDI/PABSAn = BSA - BSB

(3)

with n being the order of addition (e.g., as 2nd, 3rd, 4th),
BSA is the BS value after addition of the partition and BSB
before addition.
Finally, analogous to the clade stability index [69], which
is too time consuming to be computed in larger data sets
because it is based on the removal of single characters,
Gatesy et al. [40] introduced the Data set Removal Index
(DRI). DRI is the minimum number of partitions to be
removed to collapse a node obtained in the analysis of all
partitions. For nodes not recovered in the combined analysis DRI is always zero. The DRI provides a measurement
of how many and which data sets are necessary to recover
a node in a simultaneous analysis. The higher the DRI the
more partitions agree with the node. DRI has an upper
limit with the number of partitions defined.
Determination of significance
To test the significance of PBS and BS values several
authors suggested employing the Templeton [70] test to
examine clade significance [71-74]. However, strictly spoken this test does not measure the significance of the
actual values, but the differences of the underlying trees.
The Templeton [70] test compares two trees to each other
by assessing at each position which of the two trees is

Page 4 of 27

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:22

favored and to what degree. Then a Wilcoxon signed rank
test (WRST) is used to determine the significance of the
obtained differences in support. It remains unresolved if
the compared trees are a priori or a posteriori hypotheses,
in other words, if they were postulated before or after the
phylogenetic reconstruction [74]. Results of Templeton
[70] tests are only reliable if two a priori hypotheses are
compared to each other [75]. Finally, the test cannot be
adopted for the PABA and NDI/PABSA approaches.
Thornton and DeSalle [63] adopted the procedure of the
ILD test to assess significance [41] for their LILD test. The
test procedure generates new partitions of same sizes as
the defined partitions by randomly assigning positions
from the complete data set to partitions. Thus, the procedure can assess if the same value can be obtained just by
chance due to randomly partitioning the data set in partitions of same sizes as defined partitions. Except for DRI it
can be adopted for all approaches used herein. Therefore,
herein significance with respect to values obtained by PBS,
NDI/PABSA, LILD or PABA means that this value could
not have been obtained by randomly partitioning the data
set.
In contrast to the ILD test however, the two-sided tail
probability has been determined herein. In all approaches
used herein the values can be either positive, zero or negative. Randomly partitioning the data set and determining
the specified values (e.g., NDI) will generate a distribution
of these values for which it cannot be predict beforehand
if our test value will be on the right-hand or left-hand side
of the mean value, which is not necessarily zero. Therefore, the two-sided tail probability has been determined.
On the other hand, the values of the ILD test can never be
smaller than zero and thus the one-sided tail probability
has to be determined. An analogous differentiation is
encountered in hypotheses testing [e.g., [75]]. If two a priori hypotheses are compared it cannot be predicted, which
one is the preferred one by the data set and two-sided tail
probabilities have to be determined. However, if the best
tree is compared against an a priori hypothesis than the a
priori hypothesis can never be better than the best tree and
the one-sided tail probability has to be determined [75].
Furthermore, using the two-sided tail probabilities allows
not only assessing excess conflict, but also excess support.
This means, that the support of a node is mainly derived
from one or only a few partitions. Thus, single gene artifacts within combined analyses can eventually be
revealed. Finally, in comparison to one-sided tail probabilities two-sided ones are more conservative (i.e., indicate significance less often). Herein I used a significance
level of 0.95. This means, that tails of 2.5% at each end of
the distribution were used to determine significance. In
case of a one-sided tail probability a tail of 5% at the lefthand side of the distribution would have been used for

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/22

excess conflict. Thus, to convert the two-sided results into
one-sided ones they have just to be divided by two.
In this study the potential of DRI, PABA and BS based
approaches to detect conflict in data sets affected by
paedomorphosis were compared analyzing compiled data
of Wiens et al. [2] and Weisrock et al. [37]. Herein I will
show that paedomorphosis affects the phylogenetic
reconstruction of salamander phylogeny though the morphological partition provides only 14% of the parsimonyinformative positions in the combined data set. Both
strategies suggested by Wiens et al. [2] to ameliorate this
effect are equally efficient, but overall the strategy to
exclude paedomorphic character traits has to be favored
over the strategy to recode paedomorphic taxa, because it
deteriorates the phylogenetic signal in the morphological
partition less severely. Concerning the molecular data, the
rRNA partition seems to be too conserved to reliable
reconstruct the salamander phylogeny while the mtDNA
is too variable. The different approaches to detect incongruence are generally congruent to each other. However,
the disagreement to the other methods is the lowest for
approaches utilizing alteration measurements like NDI or
PABA. Therefore, these approaches are preferable and
with respect to computation time NDI outperforms PABA.

Results
Complete data set
The complete data set comprised 21 taxa and 6,427 characters in four partitions (morphology: 326; RAG1: 1,530;
rRNA: 2,742; mtDNA: 1,829). The rRNA partition comprises sequence information of the small and the large
subunit of the nuclear rRNAs and the mtDNA partition
includes COI (subunit one of cytochrome c oxidase),
ND1, ND2 (subunits one and two of NADH dehydrogenase), tRNAAla, tRNAAsn, tRNACys, tRNAGln, tRNAIle,
tRNAMet, tRNATrp, tRNATyr and the origin for light-strand
replication. Of these characters 1,902 were parsimony
informative and 482 uninformative. Thus, on average
105.7 informative characters per internal node could be
expected. The phylogenetic reconstruction showed that
families except for Hynobiidae are well supported by both
BS and BP values (Fig. 1). Beyond the family level only the
closer relationship of Ambystomatidae and Dicamptodontidae and the monophyly of Cryptobranchoidea
(Hynobiidae plus paedomorphic Cryptobranchidae) as
well as of Caudata are well supported. The paedomorphic
Amphiumidae are placed as sister to Plethodontidae,
whereas Sirenidae and Proteidae are sisters to each other
and this group is then sister to the other Salamandroidea
(i.e., Plethodontidae, Amphiumidae, Rhyacotritonidae,
Ambystomatidae, Dicamptodontidae and Salamandridae) (Fig. 1).

Phylogenetic analysis of combined data and indicated conflicts
Phylogenetic analysis of combined data and indicated conflicts. Most parsimonious tree of the analysis of all data [Tree length
(TL) = 858,325; Number of trees (NT) = 1]. Red branches are incongruent to trees obtained in analyses of all possible combinations of
partitions (Figs. 3–5). The labels at the branches indicate the following from top to bottom: 1st) Significant contribution (green) or conflict
(red) indicated by PABA (P) or NDI (N) for morphology (M), RAG1 (R), rRNA (r) or mtDNA (m); 2nd) Node labels; 3rd) BS values, with
significant ones based on the Templeton [70] test indicated by an asterisk; 4th) BP values above 50; 5th) Degree of conflict indication.
Paedomorphic taxa are highlighted with grey boxes.

Given the taxa in common, this tree (Fig. 1) is generally
congruent with the combined analyses of Wiens et al. [2].
However, in their combined analyses Desmognathus
ochrophaeus is more closely related to Pseudotriton montanus and Eurycea longicauda than is Pseudoeurycea rex. Furthermore, Proteidae and Sirenidae are not sister taxa to

each other, but either Sirenidae occupy a more basal position [Fig. 7 in [2]] or Proteidae are sister to the clade comprising Ambystomatidae, Dicamptodontidae and
Salamandridae [Fig. 8 in [2]]. On the other hand, this
combined analysis (Fig. 1) and the combined analyses of
Weisrock et al. [37] seem to be completely incongruent.

However, a closer examination shows that the major difference is the placement of outgroups and thus the rooting of the tree. In their analyses the root is placed at the
branch leading to paedomorphic Amphiumidae [Fig. 5 in
[37]]. Furthermore, their analyses also do not support a
sister group relationship of the paedomorphic taxa Sirenidae and Proteidae, but a paraphyletic assemblage of these
with respect to the clade comprising Ambystomatidae,
Dicamptodontidae and Salamandridae.
Only the nodes 3, 4, 7, 9, 14, 16 and 17 are consistently
recovered in all possible combinations of partitions and
thus have a DRI of 4 (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). These nodes are
all well supported and show no significant conflict due to
any of the partitions except for node 4. At node 4 the rRNA
partition exhibits a significant conflict based on the NDI
and PBS approaches (Figs. 1, 2). Additionally, a few nonsignificant negative values are also obtained for others of
these nodes (Fig. 2). However, all other approaches either
result in positive values or are not applicable for these
nodes. The degree of negative values and thus the indication of possible conflict ranges from 0–8.7% (Figs. 2 &6).
This means, for example, that only 8.7% of the values are
negative at node 4 (2 out of 23). Therefore, these values
are most likely false negative ones.
The nodes 1, 8 and 18 are also within this low range of
conflict indication (Figs. 2 &6). These three nodes are
recovered in 14 out of the 15 trees (Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5), have a
DRI of 3 and only one significant conflict is indicated for
each (Fig. 2). The other negative values could have been
obtained just by chance. Node 1 is not recovered by the
individual rRNA partition analysis, because the rRNA partition cannot resolve ingroup relationships of Plethodontidae (Fig. 4E). In the mtDNA analysis (Fig. 4F)
Dicamptodontidae are placed as sister to Cryptobranchoidea in contrast to node 8 and the morphological partition
splits the outgroups apart (Fig. 5B). However, support for
these placements is low in contrast to the well-supported
alternatives in the combined analysis (Fig. 1). Overall, it
seems safe to conclude that no partition really disagrees
with the nodes belonging to group A in Fig. 6 (i.e., 1, 3, 4,
7–9, 14, and 16–18) and thus these nodes can be treated
as conflict-free.
All other nodes of Fig. 1 exhibit a much higher degree of
conflict indication ranging from 31.3% to 46.9%, which
is accompanied by a DRI of only 1 (Fig. 2). Furthermore,
the number of significant conflicts at these nodes is higher
than at the other nodes of Fig. 1 (Fig. 2). For example, considering only PABA and NDI values significant conflict is
indicated by morphology, RAG1 or mtDNA at five of
seven nodes in contrast to one out of 11 (Fig. 1). The
mtDNA partition exhibits strong and significant conflicts
by nearly all methods at nodes 10 and 11 (Fig. 2). Further-

more, at these nodes as well as at nodes 5, 6, 13 and 15
negative values are consistently obtained by the different
methods for the mtDNA partition. The same can be
shown at nodes 12 and 15 for the RAG1 partition,
although significant are only a few values. At node 12 also
the rRNA partition nearly consistently results in negative
values. The morphological partition indicates consistent
and/or strong conflict at the nodes 2, 4 and 6. On the
other hand, for the nodes 12 and 15, which in part place
paedomorphic taxa, the major contribution of support is
due to the morphological partition (Figs. 1, 2). Node 12
groups Sirenidae and Proteidae together and node 15, in
concert with node 17, places Cryptobranchidae as sister to
Hynobiidae (Fig. 1). Finally, these nodes (i.e., 2, 5, 6,
10–13, 15) are only found 3 to 9 times in the other 14
trees (Figs. 3, 4, 5) and none of these nodes is well supported (Fig. 1). Therefore, for each node at least one of the
partitions is strongly disagreeing and thus they exhibit
conflict due to that partition. Additional data or treatment
of the data is necessary to either strengthen the support or
minimize the conflict.
Molecular versus morphological data
The combined molecular partitions have 1,636 parsimony informative and 430 uninformative positions.
Thus, on average 90.9 informative characters per internal
node could be expected. The most parsimonious tree (Fig.
5A) was nearly congruent with the tree obtained by the
complete data set (Fig. 1). The paedomorphic Cryptobranchidae are a subtaxon of Hynobiidae and Sirenidae
and Proteidae are not sister taxa to each other. Sirenidae
branches off first within the Caudata and Proteidae are sister to the clade comprising Plethodontidae, Amphiumidae and Rhyacotritonidae. Not surprisingly the
morphological partition is strongly disagreeing and in
conflict with these four nodes different from the combined data set (i.e., 19–22; Figs. 2 &5A). The range of conflict indication at these nodes is overlapping with the
range of the conflicting nodes of Fig. 1 (Figs. 2, 5A &6).

The morphological partition has 266 parsimony informative and 52 uninformative positions. Thus, on average
14.8 informative characters per internal could be
expected. The most parsimonious tree (Fig. 5B) is incongruent to Fig. 1 in eight of 18 nodes. For example, the
paedomorphic taxa Proteidae, Sirenidae and Amphiumidae are in a basal position and closely related to the outgroup, which is split apart. This is similar to the results of
Wiens et al. [2] also showing a close relationship of these
paedomorphic taxa analysing only the morphological
data. The molecular data clearly and strongly reject these
nodes except for node 28, which is the placement of
Desmognathus closer to Pseudotriton and Eurycea (Figs. 5B
&7). Only the mtDNA partition exhibits significant conflicts with this node, the other two molecular partitions

Conflict 2 contribution at the first 27 nodes
Conflict or contribution at the first 27 nodes. Negative (red boxes) or positive (green boxes) values at each node are indicated for
each partition and approach: P4 = PABA4, P3 = PABA3, P2 = PABA2, B = PBS, N4 = NDI, N3 = PABSA3, N2 = PABSA2, L = LILD. Significant values are indicated by a stronger colour than non-significant ones (dark green vs. light green; dark red vs. light red). For PBS, the
results of the Templeton [70] test are also indicated in the first half of the box. Grey boxes indicate a value of 0 and white boxes that the
approach was not applicable due an alteration from maximal or minimal support (i.e., BP = 100 or 5) to maximal or minimal support (i.e.,
BP = 100 or 5). Furthermore, DRI, degree of conflict indication (%C) and number of times (#F) the node was found in the most parsimonious trees or consensus trees of the 15 different possible combinations of partitions (Figs. 1, 3-5) is given. The DRI is only given for the
first 18 nodes corresponding to the tree of the analysis of all data (Fig. 1). At all other nodes DRI is 0.

Phylogenetic analyses of combined molecular data and only morphology with indicated conflicts for both. Most parsimonious trees of the analyses of the combined molecular data (A) as well as only the morphological partition (B) [A: TL = 772,700; NT = 1;
B: TL = 83,625; NT = 1]. Red branches are incongruent to the tree obtained in the analysis of all data (Fig. 1). The labels at the branches
indicate the following from top to bottom: 1st) Significant contribution (green) or conflict (red) indicated by PABA (P) or NDI (N) for
morphology (M), RAG1 (R), rRNA (r) or mtDNA (m); 2nd) Node labels; 3rd) BS values, with significant ones based on the Templeton [70]
test indicated by an asterisk; 4th) BP values above 50; 5th) Degree of conflict indication. Paedomorphic taxa are highlighted with grey

show more positive values than negative ones. Furthermore, this node is also found in six other consensus trees
and has with 40.6% a degree of conflict indication similar
to the conflicting nodes of Figs. 1 and 5A. All other nodes
(i.e., 32, 34, 36, 46–49) have a degree of above 72% (Figs.
5B &7).
Plotting the degree of conflict indication against itself as
well as against the number of trees encompassing the particular node (Fig. 6) three distinct groups can be differentiated. Group A encloses all nodes with a degree of 0–11%
and which are found in at least 14 consensus trees. These
nodes can all be regarded as conflict-free (see above).
Group B contains all nodes with a degree ranging from
30% to 60%. However, the number of times they were

found is wide spread from one to 10, but a weak negative
correlation between the number of times found and the
degree of conflict indication can be seen. The third group
C encompasses all nodes with a degree of conflict larger
than 69% and the nodes are only found one to three
times. These nodes are generally strongly and consistently
rejected by three partitions indicating that their reconstruction is due to a single partition. In contrast to the
nodes of group B, which are in need of further investigation, these nodes can be regarded single partition artefacts.
The nodes of group B are still or only recovered in combined analyses of all four partitions (i.e., 2, 5, 6, 10–13,
15; Fig. 1), of three partitions (i.e., 19–28; Figs. 3A–C, 5A)

and of combinations of two molecular partitions (i.e.,
29–31, 50; Fig. 4B&C). The nodes of group C are found
either only in single partition analyses (i.e., 39–49; Figs.
4E&F, 5B) or in analyses of two partitions with one partition being the morphological one (i.e., 32–34, 36–38; Fig
3E&F). Node 35, which is found in the combined analysis
of morphological and mtDNA data (Fig. 3F), is the only
node of a bipartition analysis including morphological
data that belongs to group B instead of C. All incongruent
nodes of the morphology alone analysis belong to group
C except for node 28 and thus can be regarded as nodes
only supported or reconstructed by a single partition.
Comparison of partitions
Comparing the degree of pairwise disagreements, that is
one partition indicates a conflict or a contribution and the
other one the contrary, reveals that the disagreement is the
lowest for the pair RAG1 and rRNA (Table 1). On average
the rRNA partition is slightly better than the RAG1 partition for all nodes and both being clearly better than

mtDNA and morphological data. Considering only the
nodes obtained in the analysis of all data (Fig. 1) RAG1
and rRNA are equally good, whereas the morphological
partition exhibits lower average disagreement to the other
partitions than the mtDNA partition. The results are similar for the nodes of the combined molecular data (Fig.
5A). Thus, RAG1 and rRNA show the lowest disagreement
to each other as well as to the other two partitions. Considering all nodes morphology has the strongest disagreement to the other partitions, but regarding only the nodes
of the two most inclusive analyses (Figs. 1 &5A) the
mtDNA is disagreeing stronger than morphology.
The mean contribution to the nodes of Fig. 1 is the strongest for the RAG1 partition, but the smallest for the rRNA
partition with an average rank of 1 and 3.4, respectively
(Table 2). The morphological partition is in between these
two with an average rank of 2.9. This order is congruent
with their number of parsimony informative positions
ranging from 108 (rRNA) via 266 (morphology) to 533
(RAG1). However, the mtDNA partition does not fit into
this order. With 995 it has the highest number of parsimony informative positions, but is only in 2nd place for all
BS based approaches and in 4th for the PABA approach. Its
average rank is similar to the morphological one (Table
2).
Finally, using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (WRST) it can
be checked for any given set of nodes if the addition of a
partition results in an increase or decrease of overall support despite the detection of some significant conflicts.
Therefore, the value of the chosen approach (e.g., NDI or
PBS) of each node of this set is ranked based on its absolute value, i.e. without its algebraic sign. Then the ranks of
the positive values are summed up as well as the ranks of
the negative values. Finally, it is determined if the rank
sum of the positive and thus contributing values is larger
or smaller than the rank sum of the negative ones and if
this difference is significant. For example, if 10 of the 18
internal nodes had a positive value and all of them were
larger in their absolute value than the other eight negative
values the positive rank sum would be 135 and the negative one 36. Thus, it can be assessed if the inclusion of a
partition is beneficial or detrimental over all considered
nodes. Herein, I considered two sets of nodes. One set
comprised the nodes of the tree of the analysis of all data
(Fig. 1) and the other one the nodes of the tree of the combined molecular data (Fig. 5A). For nearly all BS based
approaches the addition of any of the partitions is beneficial and most times this is significant at p ≤ 0.05 (Table 3).
However, the results of the PABA approach are not that
clear cut. The addition of any partition as 2nd is beneficial
for all partitions. Whereas this holds also up for later additions as 3rd or 4th for RAG1 and rRNA, the morphological
partition is becoming increasingly detrimental the later

titions (Table 4). The mtDNA partition results only in the
pairwise comparison with the rRNA partition in a non-significant p value, in all other comparisons this value is
below 0.05. In contrast to these three partitions, the rRNA
partition exhibits incongruence only in the pairwise comparisons to either the morphological or the RAG1 partition.
Strategies ameliorating effects of paedomorphosis
Wiens et al. [2] suggested two strategies to ameliorate negative effects of paedomorphosis on phylogenetic reconstructions using morphological data. The first one (S1) is
to code characters of the adult morphology of non-paedomorphic species as unknown in paedomorphic species.
The other one (S2) is to remove specifically characters
from the data set, which are supposedly affected by paedomorphosis. Additionally, it is also possible to combine
these two strategies in one (S12) [2]. In analyses based on
all four partitions each of these three strategies resulted in
the same topology, which is identical with the topology of
the analysis of the combined molecular data (Fig. 5A).
Each strategy minimizes the conflict at the nodes 19 to 22
induced by the morphological partition, i.e. the values
increase (e.g., from -800 to 400 for the LILD approach, the
strategy S12 and node 20). The only exception is the PBS
value at node 21, which decreases using strategy S2 from 650 to -950.

Strategy S1 codes 27.8% of the morphological data as
unknown and thus effectively deletes them. Strategy S2
deletes 9.2% of the morphological data and the combination of both strategies S12 results in a deletion of 34.4%.
Thus, though the three strategies minimize the conflict at
nodes 19 to 22 due to morphology the effect at the

p values of the WRST are given for each partition, each approach and the two sets of nodes. Italic values indicate that the negative rank sum was
larger than the positive rank sum and thus the contribution of the partition is detrimental to this set of nodes given the used approach. If they are
also bold this difference was significant.

remaining nodes of Fig. 5A has also to be assessed to show
whether the strategies are overall beneficial or detrimental. Using the WRST it can be tested if the rank sum of the
positive changes, i.e. an increase in the values, is larger or
smaller than the rank sum of the negative values as well as
if this difference is significant for all nodes of Fig. 5A.
Therefore, the difference of the values after and before the
treatment at a node is calculated (e.g., 400-(-800) = 1200
for the LILD approach, the strategy S12 and node 20).
These differences are ranked based on their absolute values and the ranks of the positive values are summed up as
well as the ranks of the negative values. All three strategies
are overall significantly detrimental to PBS values (Table
5). On the other hand, strategy S2 is significantly beneficial in all other approaches. Furthermore, the average
degree of disagreement of the treated morphological partition to the other partitions is only 31.14% and thus is
4.64% smaller than for the untreated morphological partition (Tables 1 &5). For strategy S1 and S12, the results
are not so unequivocal. PABA and LILD generally exhibit

due to the fact that the amplitude of alteration is different

Pairwise comparisons of the NDI/PABSA approaches to
each other. The values of each NDI/PABSA approach (NDI,
PABSA3 and PABSA2) are plotted against each other to analyse the
correlations of their values. The other comparisons are shown in
Fig. 8.

In pairwise comparisons of the approaches both
approaches can have either the same algebraic sign or different ones. Table 6 shows the percentage of pairs, in
which one approach has a negative and thus a conflicting
value for a node and partition while the other one has a
positive contributing one. On average LILD indicates in
24.84% of the comparisons a conflict, while the other
approach indicates a positive value. The PBS approach has
the 2nd highest mean with 11.27%. PABA and NDI/PABSA
range from 5 to nearly 8%. In both, addition as 2nd has the
highest percentage (Table 6).
Considering only pairs, in which at least one of the two
values is significant, clearly decreases the mean values as
well as the values of the individual pairwise comparisons
(except for a few instances) (Table 6). LILD and PBS still
exhibit the highest mean values with 21.75% and
10.38%, respectively. PABA and NDI/PABSA range from
0.65% to 5.77% and from 2.59% to 4.23%, respectively.
In both, the mean values decrease with increasing order of
addition. Especially strong is the decrease in the PABA
approach, when a partition is added as 4th. The percentage
decreases from 5.85% to only 0.65%. In five out seven
individual comparisons the percentage is even 0.00%.
This means that there is no negative value, which is

The percentage is relative to the total number of data pairs in pairwise comparisons of the approaches. The upper values were obtained considering
all pairs and the lower value considering only pairs, which had at least one significant value. For example, in the comparison of PABA4 to PABA3 in
4.3% of the data pairs PABA4 had a negative value while PABA3 had a positive one, when all pairs were considered, and in 0% of the data pairs, when
only pairs with at least one significant value were considered. For PBS, the Templeton [70] test results were not considered.

Discussion
Paedomorphosis, morphology and conflict
The addition of morphological data to molecular data
changed the phylogenetic positions of three of the four
paedomorphic taxa included in this study. Cryptobranchidae moved to a more basal position within Cryptobranchoidea and Sirenidae and Proteidae are grouped
together. Additionally, the morphological partition exhibits strong conflict with nodes separating Proteidae and
Sirenidae in the combined molecular analysis. The same
can be shown for the node placing Cryptobranchidae as a
subtaxon of Hynobiidae. Thus, morphology can exhibit
even in the combination with large molecular data sets
strong misleading effects due to paedomorphosis [2,3135]. For example, the molecular data recover the monophyly of Salamandroidea, which also comprises Proteidae, but not Sirenidae. Sirenidae and Cryptobranchoidea
reproduce by external fertilisation [76]. Salamandroidea
are characterized by internal fertilisation, which requires a
specific complex of male and female cloacal glands, life
history and behaviour [77]. This complex has never been
lost within any of these families. This indicates that it is
evolutionary highly 'burdened' in the sense of Riedl [78]
and Donoghue [79] and is unlikely to be secondarily lost
[37]. Still the morphological data render Salamandroidea
paraphyletic.

Furthermore, all strategies to minimize the negative
impact of paedomorphic taxa and/or character traits
resulted in trees identical to the molecular one as well as
reduced conflicts at the corresponding nodes. Thus, morphological data of paedomorphic taxa and/or character
traits can mislead the phylogenetic reconstruction, but
this impact can be ameliorated by different strategies
employed herein. On the other hand, in the analyses of
Wiens et al. [2] no major difference could be observed
between the tree obtained from their untreated combined
data set and the trees obtained from their treated combined data sets. Wiens et al. [2] used the same strategies to
treat their combined data set as employed herein. Additionally, their obtained trees for the combined data were
relatively similar to the trees obtained only from the
molecular data. Thus, in the analyses of Wiens et al. [2]
the negative impact of morphological data of paedomorphic taxa on the phylogenetic reconstruction using the
combined data set was much less influential than in the
analyses presented herein. The analyses of Wiens et al. [2]
comprised 50% more paedomorphic and non-paedomorphic taxa than this analysis. Therefore, not only the strategies analyzed herein may reduce the effect of
paedomorphosis on combined analyses, but also an
increased taxon sampling.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/22

Based on the results presented herein the strategy to
exclude paedomorphic character traits is to be favoured
over the strategy to recode paedomorphic taxa or the combination of both. Due to possible difficulties to securely
determine paedomorphic character traits Wiens et al. [2]
favoured the strategy to recode taxa. Furthermore, Wiens
et al. [2] showed that other factors like synapomorphies of
adult characters in non-paedomorphic taxa and convergent evolution have an impact on the phylogenetic assessment of paedomorphic taxa. Both strategies were able to
ameliorate the effects of paedomorphosis on morphological data sets herein. However, based on the WRST results
the strategy to just exclude supposedly paedomorphic
character traits seems to be also overall beneficial. The
other strategy and the combination of both are overall
either beneficial or detrimental depending on the
method. The latter means that though the conflict at the
nodes affected by paedomorphosis is minimized the support at the other nodes due to the morphological partition
is strongly reduced as well. The number of effectively
deleted characters is at least three times higher in these
two strategies than in the strategy to exclude traits. Thus,
not only conflicting characters are deleted with a higher
probability, but also supporting characters.
The analyses revealed that there is substantial disagreement concerning the position of paedomorphic Cryptobranchidae.
Monophyly
of
Cryptobranchoidea
comprising Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae is well
supported by both BP and BS values. However, the position of Cryptobranchidae within Cryptobranchoidea is
controversial. Morphology and rRNA contribute to the
placement as sister to Hynobiidae, whereas RAG1 and
mtDNA contribute stronger to a derived position within
Hynobiidae. Different strategies ameliorating the negative
impact of paedomorphosis show that the contribution for
the more basal placement of Cryptobranchidae by morphology is in part due to paedomorphic character traits.
Interestingly, the combined analyses of both Wiens et al.
[2] and Weisrock et al. [37] recovered monophyletic
Hynobiidae, whereas the combined molecular analyses of
Wiens et al. [2] found their paraphyly. Therefore, to
securely resolve the phylogenetic position of Cryptobranchidae within Cryptobranchoidea more molecular
data are needed.
Molecular partitions and conflict
Though the morphological partition is influenced by
paedomorphosis the molecular partitions show substantial conflicts as well. RAG1 and rRNA are disagreeing the
least with each other and with other partitions, though the
topologies obtained in the individual analyses are very
different [Fig. 4D&E and see also [2,37]]. Taxonomic congruence approaches would have indicated that there is
substantial disagreement between the two partitions and

Page 18 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:22

thus would have given misleading results to not combine
the two. The addition of both partitions to the data set is
always beneficial based on WRST results and only one significant conflict based on PABA or NDI can be detected
for each at the nodes of the two most inclusive data sets,
the complete one and the complete molecular one. However, the contribution of RAG1 to the analyses is much
stronger than that of rRNA. This is not surprising given
that RAG1 has nearly five times more parsimony-informative positions. On the other hand, the rRNA partition has
nearly twice the size. Thus, with respect to salamander
phylogeny the rRNA genes might actually be too conserved given that only 3.9% of positions are informative
for parsimony reconstructions. If genes are too conserved
they might not be able to resolve nodes, especially short
internal ones as in the case of the salamander phylogeny
[37], because not enough phylogenetic signal is picked up
to robustly resolve the phylogeny [80,81]. This is also
reflected in the ILD results. While the other three partitions are at odds which each other, the rRNA partition
shows congruence to nearly all possible combinations of
partitions.
In contrast, the mtDNA partition exhibits significant conflicts based on PABA or NDI at three nodes of the two
most inclusive data sets and disagrees the strongest with
the other partitions on the nodes obtained by these data
sets. The addition of mtDNA data as third or fourth is detrimental for bootstrap support. Upon addition BP values
decline more often and stronger than they increase. This is
congruent with the average contribution, which is slightly
negative. The contribution of mtDNA is always smaller
than that of RAG1 though it has nearly twice as much parsimony informative positions in only 1.2 times as much
positions. Using simulation studies Weisrock et al. [37]
showed that mtDNA might lack the potential to robustly
resolve short internal branches deep in the salamander
phylogeny. Two taxa splitting 35 million years ago must
have had an ancestral lineage of at least 5 to 9 million
years to be robustly reconstructed by Bayesian inference or
parsimony, respectively, using mtDNA data [37]. However, fossil records for some extant families such as Cryptobranchidae date back to the early Cretaceous [e.g., [82]]
while the earliest salamanders are found in the late
Jurassic [36]. Thus, salamander presumably showed a
rapid radiation resulting in short internal branches and
long terminal ones [37,83]. Such phylogenies are hard to
resolve [e.g., [80,81,84-86]]. Furthermore, though
mtDNA adds twice as much parsimony informative positions it is not able to overwhelm the phylogenetic signal
of RAG1 in combined analyses. For example, the outgroup taxa are never placed in such cases close to the
Amphiumidae (Figs. 1, 3B, 4B, 5A) as they are in the
mtDNA alone analysis [Fig. 4F and [37]]. A consequence
of the latter is also that Salamandroidea are not mono-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/22

phyletic as they are for example in the RAG1 alone analysis (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, BS based approaches and
PABA2 show that the addition of the mtDNA is beneficial
to nodal support values. This is due to more recent
branching events in the salamander phylogeny to which
the mtDNA contributes positively. This is in agreement
with the results of Weisrock et al. [37] and indicates that
mtDNA can add substantial support to more recent evolutionary events. Therefore, while rRNA seems to be too
conserved for the reconstruction of salamander phylogeny mtDNA seems to be too variable for nodes deep in the
salamander phylogeny. However, to robustly resolve salamander phylogeny more molecular data are advisable,
because they are in contrast to morphological data not
affected by paedomorphosis [e.g., [22]]. Future studies
concerning salamander phylogeny should concentrate on
genes with properties similar to the RAG1 gene, which
seems to be the most potential gene in this study to
resolve the deep salamander phylogeny.
Wilcoxon signed rank tests and partition congruence
Herein I presented a new approach to determine congruence of partitions based on node-by-node values of different methods. This approach utilized the Wilcoxon Signed
Rank Test (WRST) to test whether more negative or positive values are obtained for a set of nodes and also takes
into account the magnitude of these values. Concerning
WRST results there seems to be a discrepancy between
PABA3&4 and both the BS based approaches and PABA2, if
the addition of the morphological or mtDNA partitions is
detrimental or beneficial, respectively. This discrepancy is
not contradictory. The WRST is conservative in the indication of a detrimental effect and thus in its advice against
merging the partitions. Therefore, the negative rank sum
has to be larger than the positive rank sum. To achieve this
either more than half of the nodes exhibit slight conflicts
without the positive ones showing strong contributions or
less than half, but several of the nodes have very strong
conflicts and the other nodes provide only small positive
contributions. To be significant the difference between the
rank sums has to be even more pronounced. With increasing numbers of partitions more and more nodes are maximally supported by a BP value of 100 and cannot be
increased anymore if a new partition is added. Thus, the
PABA approach is not applicable at these nodes anymore
and the nodes will not be counted in the WRST. On the
other hand, conflicts induced at nodes by a partition
might still be detected as long as the conflict is able to
decrease the BP value below 100. As a consequence, the
ratio of the nodes with negative values to the ones with
positive values is shifted to the negative ones with increasing order of addition. In contrast, BS based approaches are
not hampered by such an upper limit and thus the ratio of
these nodes will not be altered. However, this is not necessarily a disadvantage for the PABA approach. Due to the

Page 19 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:22

PABA approach conflicts, which are persistent in a partition and thus might cause strong incongruence, can be
more easily detected by means of WRST. Thus, while the
mtDNA and morphology is contributing to several nodes,
which are also supported by other partitions, both show
also significant incongruence at some nodes. On the other
hand, the ILD test [41] seem to be too sensitive to incongruence at a few internal nodes by indicating that except
for the very slowly evolving rRNA partition all partitions
are at odds with each other. For the more detailed discussion of the pros and cons of ILD see the Background section and literature cited therein.
Comparison of conflict detecting approaches
The results presented herein indicate that approaches
using alteration estimations, NDI/PABSA and PABA, are
more conservative in the indication of conflict than the
approaches only analyzing individual partitions such as
PBS and LILD. The latter ones indicate more often a conflict while other approaches indicate a positive contribution. Alteration approaches such as NDI assess not only
the conflict and support within individual partitions, but
also the support or conflict the addition of a partition
brings out in the other partitions, which is also known as
hidden support [40]. Thus, alteration methods also take
into account the reciprocal effects of partitions to each
other.

In both approaches the addition as 2nd and thus the first
possible addition is the least conservative one. Combining partitions might increase the weak phylogenetic signal
in each individual partition while the phylogenetic signallike pattern due to homoplasy remains constant or even
decreases [e.g. [40,56]]. Thus, with only two partitions the
influence of homoplasy in each partition can still be
strong enough to indicate conflict with one approach and
contribution with another one, though either the conflict
or the contribution is weak. Or in other words, the full
hidden support is not revealed yet for both partitions.
With increasing amount of data in one of the partitions
(i.e., later addition of the other partition) the reciprocal
influence of the partitions to each other is more easily
revealed and thus PABA and NDI/PABSA, which are able
to assess this influence, are increasingly conservative with
later additions. Additionally, for PABA sample size may
also be in part accountable for this trend. With increasing
number of addition more nodes are either maximally or
minimally supported (i.e., 100% or 5%, respectively) and
are not altered anymore. Thus, the sample sizes decrease
and the chance to disagree with other approaches. Weak
conflicts or contributions cannot be revealed any longer,
because they are not able to overwhelm the signal in the
other partitions. This might also in part explain the very
low percentages of disagreement obtained for PABA4 considering only significant values of conflict or contribution.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/22

However, PABA and NDI/PABSA results are generally congruent to each other. Thus, a full-blown PABA or NDI/
PABSA might not always be needed to reveal the conflict
at nodes, but only the last possible addition (e.g., as 4th).
Especially for NDI/PABSA only NDI seems to be necessary
given that NDI is not affected as PABA by already maximally supported nodes. In PABA these nodes are often not
applicable anymore for the detection of conflict or support and lower orders of additions are needed, if effects of
partitions on BP support of these nodes shall be shown.
Additionally, NDI is less computational intensive than
PABA (see below). On the other hand and as discussed
above, due to the 'removal' of maximally supported nodes
PABA is more efficient to show persistent conflict using
WRST.
LILD is less conservative than PBS. LILD assesses the contribution of a partition to a node based on tree reconstructions of the individual partition. Therefore, LILD suffers
from the same problems as taxonomic congruence
approaches [e.g., [40,53,56-58]]. They cannot recognize
hidden support in the data sets due to overwhelming signal-like noise. In concatenated analyses the hidden support might be revealed, because the noisy positions cancel
each other out while the signal increases [40]. For PBS, the
individual partition is mapped on trees obtained by the
complete data sets. Therefore, the tree search takes the
hidden support into account whereas the calculation of
PBS is based on the individual partition. Gatesy et al. [40]
pointed out that PBS is not able to assess the contribution
a partition reveals in the other partitions, but the contribution the partition has in the simultaneous analysis. PBS
is the sum of the BS value of the partition (= LILD value)
and the hidden support/conflict of the partition for that
node [40]. Thus, PBS is in contrast to the LILD test able to
show some of the hidden support in the data set, but not
all as in alteration approaches.
However, in revealing the degree of conflict at specific
nodes as well as disagreement between partitions the
combination of all approaches were most powerful. For
example, due to 20 to 32 conflict assessments at each
node an overall degree of conflict for each node could be
obtained. This procedure revealed three distinct groups of
nodes. The first group could be regarded as undisputed by
all partitions and thus regarded as unequivocal supported
by them. This support is equivalent to a taxonomic congruence approach in that these nodes gain positive contribution from different partitions and methods over and
over again and thus gather increasing verification [e.g.,
[51,87-90]]. In contrast the third group contained nodes,
which were opposed by the vast majority of the tests and
are usually accompanied by low nodal support in analyses, which recovered the node. Thus, these nodes can be
seen as falsified in a Popperian sense [89-92]. The second

Page 20 of 27

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:22

group contains all nodes, which are equivocally supported. These nodes gather support by some of the partitions and are in conflict with others. Therefore, these
nodes are in need of further investigations and eventually
data. Based on the definition of Grant and Kluge [93] and
their provided example of unweighted parsimony I would
regard the procedure presented herein as scientific
employing empirical tests. For unweighted parsimony the
"propositions of relative recency of common ancestry
[i.e., the nodes herein] are tested according to the congruence/incongruence of available [empirical] character evidence" [93]. The methods invoked herein similarly tested
the congruence or incongruence of nodes using the available character evidence, which was grouped into different
partitions. On the other hand, WRST and the randomization of partitions can be seen as heuristic methods in the
sense of Grant and Kluge [93] to investigate the strength
of the obtained values.
Although the application of several different approaches
is preferable to gain a more thorough overview of support
and conflict this might not be always feasible due to computation limits (see below). In this case the number of
approaches should be reduced in such a way, that the
number of tree searches is reduced, but also that different
kinds of nodal support measurements are exploited to
check whether support and conflict are similar for these as
in this study. For example, one could use only the addition as last partition for PABA (e.g., PABA4 herein) in combination with NDI. Furthermore, if NDI is done the tree
searches for PBS are already conducted as well. Therefore,
if NDI is chosen, PBS can be easily obtained as well with
not much additional computation time. If the last addition in PABA is not applicable at all nodes or most nodes,
PABA2 or the next lower addition (e.g., PABA3 herein)
could be used instead because of all alternative additions
these two require the fewest tree searches. Especially in
analyses with several partitions, e.g. more than 10, PABA2
might be more suitable as the first choice to effectively
balance between the number of tree searches and the
number of results actually obtained.
Computation time and likelihood methods
Assuming that computation time of a tree search is
roughly the same regardless if it is an unconstrained, constrained, anti-constrained or single bootstrap replicate
search, the computation time to calculate BS based and
PABA values is proportional to the number of tree
searches to be conducted albeit some time has to be added
for actual calculations of the values. For PBS the number
of trees searches depends on the number of nodes to be
analyzed. These are usually at least the nodes of the best
tree of all data. Thus, one tree search is necessary to find
the best tree as well as anti-constrained searches for each
internal node. The number of internal nodes is the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/22

number of taxa minus three. However, for each additional
node of interest not obtained in the best tree constrained
searches are also needed:
SPBS = t - 2 + any additional node

(4)

with S being the number of tree searches and t the number
of taxa.
For LILD and NDI equation 4 has to be multiplied by the
number of partitions P, because each node or its best alternative has to be searched for in either each individual partition or each data set minus that partition, and
additionally the number of tree searches necessary for the
complete data set (Equation 4) has to be added for NDI:
SLILD = P * SPBS

(5)

SNDI = P * SPBS + SPBS

(6)

and

For DRI, NDI/PABSA and PABA the number of all possible
combinations of partitions has to be known:
P

P

⎛P⎞
P!

⎜ ⎟=
k⎠
k !(P − k)!

k =1
k =1
For DRI less than these might be necessary in a successive
approach as done by Gatesy et al. [40]. For NDI/PABSA
equation 7 has to be multiplied with equation 4 and for
PABA with the number of bootstrap replicates r:

∑

∑

SNDI/PABSA = (2P - 1) * SPBS ,

(8)

SPABA = (2P - 1) * r .

(9)

Table 7 shows the number of tree searches necessary for
different numbers of partitions and taxa. The number of
bootstrap replicates was kept constant with 100. PBS generally needs the fewest tree searches and thus the shortest
computation time to provide the raw data. PABA generally
needs the most time except when the number of bootstrap
replicates is smaller than the number of PBS tree searches.
In this case NDI/PABSA needs more tree searches. However, a complete NDI/PABSA approach also comprises the
tree searches needed for PBS and LILD approaches. If the
significance test presented herein is used or different strategies to analyze the data, the number of tree searches
increases accordingly. For example, for each data set
herein (1 untreated, 3 treated and 99 resampled) a minimum of 15,765 tree searches is necessary. However, due
to programming the PAUP files and downstream calculations of the values it was much more efficient to conduct

For BS based calculations it is assumed that only the nodes of the best tree are analyzed and no additional ones. For PABA the number of bootstrap
replicates was kept constant with 100. NDI = only NDI is determined; NDI/PABSA = NDI and all lower orders of additions are also determined, a
full-blown PABSA approach.

for each node a constrained and anti-constrained search
individually, although this meant to search for the best
tree 50 times. Thus, 16,500 tree searches were performed
for each data set and the total number of tree searches conducted was 1,699,500.
Herein all data were obtained using the parsimony criterion. However, all these approaches can also be used
using the likelihood criterion, because they employ either
differences in tree lengths or bootstrap values, which can
be obtained using Maximum Likelihood. However, no
maximum likelihood program exists to date, which
employs likelihood substitution models for morphological data. Such models were developed for Bayesian inferences [94]. PABA was actually developed using maximum
likelihood bootstrap values [5]. PBS likelihood derivates
have also been proposed and used [53,74]. NDI/PABSA
and LILD values could be obtained in a similar way using
Maximum Likelihood. However, given the sheer amount
of tree searches with more than 1.5 millions conducted in
this study maximum likelihood analyses would have been
too computational intensive to be performed in reasonable time despite the small number of 21 operational taxonomic units (OTUs).
All these methods can also be inferred using Bayesian
inferences and in the case of PABA posterior probabilities
instead of bootstrap values. However, for the BS based
approaches it has first to be tested whether the harmonic
mean tree length or the best tree length of the equilibrium
has to be used. The first one is, for example, used for Bayes
factor tests [e.g., [95]]. As for Maximum Likelihood the
time to conduct the analyses presented herein would not
have been reasonable. The total number of Bayesian infer-

ences to be conducted would have been at least 78,795.
This number is much smaller than that for the parsimony
criterion, because the posterior probability distribution
and thus the bipartition table is already determined during the unconstrained tree search [e.g., [96]]. However,
assuming on average the short time of only 10 minutes for
each Bayesian inference the time to complete the tree
searches would have taken more than 500 days.
Conclusion
Paedomorphosis can influence the phylogenetic reconstruction of salamander phylogeny even in combination
with a large molecular data set. The impact is less severe
than in the morphological alone analysis, but still three of
the four paedomorphic taxa included in this study are
affected. To ameliorate the negative impact of paedomorphosis the strategy to exclude paedomorphic character
traits is preferable over the strategy to code the adult morphology of paedomorphic taxa as unknown because it
deteriorates the phylogenetic signal in the morphological
partition less severely. Nonetheless, both strategies reduce
the conflict at nodes directly affected by paedomorphosis.
Concerning the molecular data, RAG1 seems the gene
with the highest potential to unravel salamander phylogeny. The rRNA partition is too conserved and the mtDNA
data too variable. The different approaches to detect conflict are generally correlated in their results. NDI/PABSA
and PABA are more conservative than PBS and LILD.
Therefore, these approaches are preferable and with
respect to computation time NDI outperforms PABA.

Methods
The data set and its partitions
The data sets of Wiens et al. [2] and Weisrock et al. [37]
were compiled herein to achieve a larger data set in terms
of character positions. Both data sets employed the
nuclear rRNA data set published by Larson and Dimmick
[35], which was also included in this study. The rRNA partition comprises sequence information of the small and
the large subunit of the nuclear rRNAs [35]. In contrast to
the analyses of Weisrock et al. [37], which used the morphological data set published by Larson and Dimmick
[35] comprising only 32 characters, Wiens et al. [2] established a new morphological data set of 326 characters.
Therefore, I used this more recent and comprehensive
data set of Wiens et al. [2] in the analyses present herein.
Finally, the RAG1 data set of Wiens et al. [2] and the
mtDNA of Weisrock et al. [37] were also incorporated.
The mtDNA partition included COI (subunit one of cytochrome c oxidase), ND1, ND2 (subunits one and two of
NADH dehydrogenase), tRNAAla, tRNAAsn, tRNACys, tRNAGln, tRNAIle, tRNAMet, tRNATrp, tRNATyr and the origin for
light-strand replication [37]. In the compilation of the
data set only OTUs were used, which covered all four partitions (morphology, RAG1, rRNA and mtDNA). However, to achieve a more representative coverage of
salamanders I used composite OTUs like Wiens et al. [2].
In the Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5 the composite OTUs are indicated by
either a representative species or genus name except for
the outgroup OTUs, which are indicated by a higher taxonomic level. The composite OTUs are as follows: Anura
(morphology: Discoglossus jennae; RAG1, rRNA, mtDNA:
Xenopus laevis), Gymnophiona (morphology, RAG1: Dermophis mexicanus; rRNA, mtDNA: Typhlonectes compressicaudata), Ambystoma gracile (rRNA, mtDNA: A. tigrinum),
Ambystoma opacum (rRNA, mtDNA: A. californiense),Amphiuma pholeter (rRNA, mtDNA: A. tridactylum),
Desmognathus ochrophaeus (RAG1: D. quadramaculatus),
Dicamptodon aterrismus (morphology: D. ensatus; RAG1:
D. tenebrosus),Hynobius nebulosus (mtDNA: H. leechi), Necturus beyeri (morphology: N. maculosus),Pseudoeurycea rex
(morphology: P. werleri), Pseudotriton montanus (rRNA: P.
ruber), Rhyacotriton variegatus (morphology: R. olympicus;
rRNA: R. kezeri), Taricha rivularis (morphology: T. torosa).
All other OTUs were not composite ones. For accession
numbers of sequence data and data sets refer to Wiens et
al. [2] and Weisrock et al. [37].

Data sets can be partitioned in numerous ways, especially
in the case of molecular data sets. For example, molecular
data sets can be partitioned based on genes, codon positions, secondary structure features or certain properties
such as substitution rates [e.g., [17,51]] and in the most
extreme down to single character positions. However, the
smaller a partition gets the larger becomes the random
error. Furthermore, for some of the procedures invoked in

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/22

this study too many partitions are not computable in reasonable time. Herein I was interested in the conflict
between morphological and molecular data due to the
process of paedomorphosis. Thus, the morphological
data were assigned to one partition. However, the molecular analyses of Wiens et al. [2] and Weisrock et al. [37]
were quite different in their results indicating conflicts
also between them. Both data sets had the rRNA data in
common, but used either RAG1 or mtDNA. Therefore, the
molecular data was split into three partitions accordingly
based on the 'gene' assignment.
Phylogenetic Analyses
Phylogenetic analyses of the complete data set as well as
of all possible combinations of partitions were conducted
using the parsimony criterion in PAUP4b11 [97]. In this
data set these are: morphology, RAG1, rRNA, mtDNA,
morphology + RAG1, morphology + rRNA, morphology +
mtDNA, RAG1 + rRNA, RAG1 + mtDNA, rRNA + mtDNA,
morphology + RAG1 + rRNA, morphology + RAG1 +
mtDNA, morphology + rRNA + mtDNA and RAG1 +
rRNA + RAG1.

The weighting strategies for morphological characters
employed by Wiens et al. [2] were adopted here to facilitate comparability. 20 multistate characters expressing
quantitative variation along a single axis (e.g., length of a
structure) were treated as ordered. 20 binary characters
showing variation within a species were weighted using
the frequency step-matrix approach [98,99] and 1 polymorphic multistate character was coded using the polymorphic method [98,99]. The remaining 285
morphological and all molecular characters were unordered and equally weighted. To balance the maximal step
cost of 100 in the step matrices, the 21 characters employing step matrices got a character weight of 1 and all others
one of 100 [for detailed discussion see [2,98,99]]. Heuristic searches with 10 replicates of random taxon addition
and TBR branch swapping were performed to reconstruct
the most parsimonious trees. Congruence between partitions was also tested using the ILD test [41] with 1,000
replicates. Each partition was compared with each possible combination of other partitions.
BS based approaches
For the 50 different nodes obtained in the most parsimonious trees of the different combinations of partitions
(Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5) BS values were calculated obtaining most
parsimonious trees based on the procedures described in
the subsection "Phylogenetic analyses" and constrained
or anti-constrained tree searches for all possible combinations of partitions [67,68]. For PBS values, each individual
partition was optimized on the constrained and anti-constrained most parsimonious trees obtained for the complete data set for each node. The significance of each BS

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:22

and PBS value was tested using the Templeton [70] test
[74]. Furthermore, NDI, PABSA3, PABSA2 and LILD were
calculated for each node using equations 2–3 [40,63].
PABA
To assess congruence between partitions node-by-node
Struck et al. [5] proposed an approach based on the alteration of BP values on a given node as partitions are added.
Therefore, the BP bipartition table of each partition and
possible combination of partitions has to be determined.
The same settings as for the phylogenetic analyses were
used in the bootstrapping analyses with 1,000 replicates
based on the maximum parsimony criterion. The general
PABA approach is outlined below. For a detailed example
see Struck et al. [5].

1) Determine BP bipartition table for each partition and
all possible combinations of partitions. Because the bipartition tables in PAUP were restricted to show only BP values of 5 or higher all BP values ≤ 5 were set to 5 (thus the
maximum of δ is 95).
2) For each node of interest, calculate the alteration, δ, of
BP values when a partition is added to an existing data set
for all possible combinations and orders of partition addition.
3) Calculate for each given node and partition the mean δ
at each possible position of addition. δ is not included in
calculating the mean if and only if both the before and
after BP value is either 100 (δ = 0) or ≤ 5 (δ = 0). In the
case of an already maximally supported node (BP = 100),
further increase of BP value cannot be achieved, although
the underlying phylogenetic signal may still change. Similarly, in the case of a minimally supported node (BP ≤ 5),
further decrease can also not be achieved.
Alterations in BP support were examined for the 50 nodes
of interest using the Java application PABA Explorer b0.1
(Meyer & Struck, pers. comm.; available from the author
on request) and Microsoft Excel.
For both PABA and the BS based approaches, the average
contribution of a partition to any set of nodes can be estimated by calculating the mean value of all δ, NDI,
PABSA3, PABSA2, LILD or PBS values belonging to this set
of nodes as well as to the partition. For PABA, this is in
contrast to the average calculation of Struck et al. [5],
which was based on the mean δ values of the nodes and
not the actual δ values. Thus, the former approach was a
weighted averaging approach, whereas this one is
unweighted.

Strategies ameliorating the effects of paedomorphosis
Though I acknowledge that individuals and taxa are
always patchworks of paedomorphic and non-paedomorphic character traits and can never be themselves paedomorphic, herein the term paedomorphic taxon refers to
taxa possessing a high degree of paedomorphic character
traits. Wiens et al. [2] proposed two different strategies to
ameliorate the negative impact of paedomorphosis. One
was to code the adult morphology of paedomorphic taxa
as unknown, because the sexual mature stages of metamorphosing and paedomorphic species are not comparable ontogenetic stages (S1). The other one was to exclude
paedomorphic character traits from the data sets, if they
can be identified (S2). Thus, in this study as in the one of
Wiens et al. [2] both the characters 1–317 coding for adult
morphology were treated as unknown in the supposedly
paedomorphic taxa Amphiuma means, Amphiuma pholeter,
Necturus beyeri, Siren intermedia, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis, and Andrias davidianus (S1) and 30 supposedly paedomorphic character traits were excluded (S2). Wiens et al.
[2] identified paedomorphic character traits based on the
presence of states in both larvae of metamorphosing taxa
and adults of paedomorphic taxa prior to any phylogenetic reconstruction. To compare these different strategies
as well as the combination of the two strategies (S12)
based on a statistical rigor the Wilcoxon signed rank test
was used. Therefore, differences between the data set
treated by the particular strategy and the untreated data set
were determined at each node for both the PABA and the
BS based values. Positive values indicate a decrease in conflict using the particular strategy and negative ones an
increase. These values were ranked according to their
absolute value, i.e. without their algebraic signs. The sum
of the ranks of the positive values as well as the sum of the
negative ones was calculated. The Wilcoxon signed rank
test can exhibit if significantly more positive or negative
changes occurred based on their rank sum using a z test.
The values for the treated data sets were obtained the same
way as they were for the untreated one.
Random partitioning of the data set
To test the significance of the PABA and the BS based values 99 data sets were generated encompassing partitions
of the same size as the morphological, RAG1, rRNA and
mtDNA partition, but the positions of the data set were
randomly assigned to these partitions. This means, the
complete data set remains the same though the positions
within the partitions have changed. The exact procedure
was as follows:

1.) Generate 99 data sets with positions randomly
assigned to the partitions.
2.) Repeat for each resampled data set all BS based
approaches and PABA to calculate all values anew.

resampled values.

4.) Determine the two-sided test probability p of the particular value.
If p is smaller or equal to 0.05 then the particular value is
significantly different from a randomly assembled partition of the same size. This means, the value obtained cannot be achieved by chance and thus is due to the particular
partition. For PABA the distribution has been centered at
zero. Examples how to conduct all these analyses are provided in the Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
