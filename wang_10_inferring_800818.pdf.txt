Abstract
Background: Enterovirus (EV) 71 is one of the common causative agents for hand, foot, and, mouth disease
(HFMD). In recent years, the virus caused several outbreaks with high numbers of deaths and severe neurological
complications. Despite the importance of these epidemics, several aspects of the evolutionary and epidemiological
dynamics, including viral nucleotide variations within and between different outbreaks, rates of change in immunerelated structural regions vs. non-structural regions, and forces driving the evolution of EV71, are still not clear.
Results: We sequenced four genomic segments, i.e., the 5’ untranslated region (UTR), VP1, 2A, and 3C, of 395 EV71
viral strains collected from 1998 to 2003 in Taiwan. The phylogenies derived from different genomic segments
revealed different relationships, indicating frequent sequence recombinations as previously noted. In addition to
simple recombinations, exchanges of the P1 domain between different species/genotypes of human enterovirus
species (HEV)-A were repeatedly observed. Contrasting patterns of polymorphisms and divergences were found
between structural (VP1) and non-structural segments (2A and 3C), i.e., the former was less polymorphic within an
outbreak but more divergent between different HEV-A species than the latter two. Our computer simulation
demonstrated a significant excess of amino acid replacements in the VP1 region implying its possible role in
adaptive evolution. Between different epidemic seasons, we observed high viral diversity in the epidemic peaks
followed by severe reductions in diversity. Viruses sampled in successive epidemic seasons were not sister to each
other, indicating that the annual outbreaks of EV71 were due to genetically distinct lineages.
Conclusions: Based on observations of accelerated amino acid changes and frequent exchanges of the P1
domain, we propose that positive selection and subsequent frequent domain shuffling are two important
mechanisms for generating new genotypes of HEV-A. Our viral dynamics analysis suggested that the importation
of EV71 from surrounding areas likely contributes to local EV71 outbreaks.

Background
Since its initial isolation in California in 1969 [1,2],
enterovirus (EV) 71 was identified to have caused
outbreaks of severe neurological disease in Australia,
Europe, Asia, and the Americas [3]. Several epidemic
outbreaks with high mortality rates have occurred in
Bulgaria in 1975 with 44 deaths [4], in Hungary in 1978

with 47 deaths [5], and in Malaysia in 1997 with at least
31 deaths [6]. In a 1998 epidemic, Taiwan had 405
severe EV71 cases with 78 deaths. In 2000 to 2002,
there were dozens of fatal EV71 cases each year in
Taiwan [7,8]. A stage-based management scheme was
developed to reduce the number of case fatalities in Taiwan [9], but most survivors of brainstem encephalitis
plus cardiopulmonary failure might have neurologic
sequelae and impaired cognition [10]. Clinically, EV71 is
capable of causing paralytic disease indistinguishable
from poliomyelitis due to the poliovirus. After the

poliovirus was nearly eradicated by vaccination, EV71 is
now considered one of the most important enteroviruses. Its genome consists of a positive single-stranded
RNA molecule of approximately 7400 nucleotides long.
The RNA is translated to give a polyprotein which is
then proteolytically processed to yield the mature structural P1 domain (encoding the capsid proteins VP4,
VP3, VP2, and VP1) and non-structural P2 (non-structural proteins) and P3 domains (non-structural proteins
and viral replicase).
There are two major EV71 genotypes (B and C) cocirculating worldwide (the EV71 prototype strain BrCr,
isolated in 1969, is the only known example of genotype
A). Genotypes B and C are subdivided into sub-genotypes
B1~B5 and C1~C5, respectively [11-14]. Despite many
studies having focused on the molecular epidemiology of
EV71 [11,15-19], several aspects of the evolutionary and
epidemiological dynamics are still not clear. In particular,
most studies of molecular epidemiology focused only on
a single region, particularly VP1, without exploring the
dynamics at the genomic scale. There are no rigorous
measurements of viral variations within an outbreak and
among different epidemic seasons. In addition, although
the evolutionary rate of VP1 was estimated [11], little is
known as to whether there are discrepancies in immunerelated structural vs. non-structural regions and in
protein-coding vs. non-coding segments of the EV71
genome. Finally, the processes through which new viral
genotypes are generated and evolve are largely unknown.
To help resolve these issues, we examined the evolutionary dynamics of EV71 by analyzing 395 viral isolates
sampled in 1998 to 2003 in Taiwan. Four genomic
regions, including one capsid protein (VP1), two proteases which cleave the viral polypeptide (2A in the P2
domain and 3C in the P3 domain), and the 5’untranslated region (UTR), were sequenced. Phylogenetic relationships of viruses isolated from different outbreaks
were analyzed. We investigated the nucleotide diversity
and divergence for different genomic segments, which
revealed contrasting patterns for different protein coding
regions. Based on the above results, we propose a possible scenario of how new EV71 genotypes emerge and
evolve. Finally, we estimated the evolutionary rate and
population dynamics of EV71.

Results
The complete VP1, 2A, and 3C and partial 5’UTR regions
of 395 EV71 and 6 coxsackievirus A 16-like (CA16-like)
strains isolated in Taiwan in 1998 to 2003 were determined. The aligned lengths of VP1, 2A, and 3C were 891,
450, and 549 nucleotides, respectively. The aligned
5’UTR region including indels was 561 nucleotides long,
which spans 151 to 701 nucleotides of EV71-A (BrCr,
U22521). Therefore, 2451 nucleotides were sequenced

from each of the 401 viral isolates. The strains examined
in this study are listed in Additional file 1, Table S1, with
the year of isolation and associated clinical symptoms, if
known. According to sequence similarities of VP1, genotypes of the recovered viral strains are listed in Table 1.
As previously reported [19], EV71-C2 was the major etiologic group in 1998, and EV71-B4 became predominant
during the period from 2000 to 2003. Our large-scale
survey also revealed that in addition to the major genotype, there were genotypes with very low frequencies
co-circulating each year. For example, in addition to the
previously reported EV71-C2 and -B4, EV71-C1 and
CA16-like were also recovered in 1998. In addition, genotype C2 was found in 1999, and genotypes C4 and CA16like were discovered in 2001.
Phylogeny and recombination of EV71

Within each segment, the homoplasy test [20], GENECONV [21], and GARD [22] failed to identify any recombination event for either within- or between-genotype
comparisons. In order to test for possible recombinations
between sequenced regions, we combined the four
segments for further analysis. The concatenated dataset
was divided into 10 lineages at the 1% level of divergence.
According to sequence similarities of VP1, genotype B4
included four lineages (1 to 4); genotype C contained
three lineages, i.e., lineages 5 (genotype C4), 6 (C1), and
7 (C2); and CA16-like had two lineages, 8 and 9. The last
lineage which contained only one viral isolate, TW-205198, was identified as a recombinant of lineages 4 and 7
(p < 0.01; KH test after GARD and homoplasy test) with
the breaking point located between 2A and 3C, and thus it
was excluded from further analysis (Additional file 2,
Figure S1). No other recombination was detected within
any lineage. The occurrences of major lineages from 1998
to 2003 are given in Figure 1. With the exception of 2000,
EV71 outbreaks in each season contained only one major
lineage. In addition, each lineage was unique to that
sampled season with no recurrence in later outbreaks. For
example, lineage 4 was from 1998 and 1999, lineages 2
and 3 contained viral strains recovered mainly from 2000,
and lineage 1 included viruses from 2001 to 2003.

Figure 1 Occurrences (left y-axis) and temporal changes in the relative genetic diversity (right y-axis) of major enterovirus (EV) 71
lineages each month. Occurrences of major lineages, lineages 1~4 (EV71-B4) and lineage 7 (EV71-C2), are shown as a bar plot. The lines
represent median (red line) and 95% highest posterior densities (HPDs; gray line) of the Bayesian skyline plot derived from VP1 of lineages 1~3.

Phylogenetic relationships of viral strains derived from
different genomic regions are given in Figure 2 which
only shows abridged phylogenies. The complete phylogenetic trees are available in Additional file 3, Figure S2.
With the exception of the 2A region, phylogenies
derived from different regions, including the 5’UTR,
VP1, and 3C, support monophyletic origins of the different lineages (> 70% bootstrap replicates) in most cases,
further supporting no recombination existing between
them. Since essentially identical relationships of different
EV71 lineages were yielded by the maximum-likelihood
(ML), neighbor-joining (NJ), and Bayesian inference (BI)
methods, we only present the phylogenetic trees constructed by NJ method with nodal supports derived
from NJ, ML, and BI analyses given at the nodes.
In the VP1 region, EV71-B4 recovered from different
years closely agreed with the phylogenetic positions. Lineage 4 was at the base of the B4 clade followed by lineages
3, 2, and 1. A monophyletic origin of genotype C,
including lineages 5, 6, and 7 was strongly supported by
the NJ method but with only a 50% bootstrap value in
the ML method (Figure 2a). These three lineages

together with EV71-A and -B4 formed a monophyletic
group with a high bootstrap value (99%). CA16 and its
related strain, CA16-like, formed a sister group to
EV71. In the 2A region (Figure 2b), all above mentioned lineages are still formed but with low bootstrap
support. CA16 did not form a sister group to lineages 8
and 9 as shown in Figure 2a. In the 3C region, lineages
5, 6, and 7 were not clustered together as in Figure 2a
and 2b. Instead, lineages 6 and 7 were a sister group to
CA8 with 99% bootstrap support in both the ML and
NJ methods and 73% probability for BI analysis (Figure
2c). Furthermore, CA16 was not a sister group to
lineages 8 and 9. The former was clustered with CA4,
and the latter pair was clustered at the bottom of the
tree with CA2, CA3, CA6, CA10, CA12, and EV71-A
(with 99% bootstrap support in both the ML and NJ
trees and 73% probability for BI analysis). In the NJ
tree constructed using the 5’UTR, lineages 6 and 7
together were a sister group to CA8 (Figure 2d).
Inconsistent phylogenies derived from different genomic regions imply frequent recombinations between different species of human enterovirus species (HEV)-A as

71 isolates. The trees were constructed based on the nucleotide substitution model determined by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) using
Modeltest 3.06 from the alignment of VP1 (A), 2A (B), 3C (C), and the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) (D), respectively. Numbers, from left to right,
close to the nodes are percentages of bootstrap support values of > 70% by the NJ and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods and percentages of

respectively, within each lineage. Dashes (–) indicate that the nodes were not supported by the method. Numbers of sequences in lineages 1, 2,
3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 are 216, 20, 44, 8, 105, 3, and 3, respectively.

previously noted [23]. In Figure 2, lineages 5 and 6 clustered tightly with CA8 in the 3C and 5’UTR regions,
but they were recognized as EV71 genotype C (C1 and
C2, respectively) based on the VP1 sequences. It is likely
that genotypes C1 and C2 were generated by acquiring
the structural domain of ancestral EV71. We further
used the bootscan program to detect the region of possible recombination. When EV71-C1 and -C2 were
compared against different viruses of HEV-A, two
recombination events between CA8 and EV71 (either
genotype A or B or both combined) in the 5’UTR
(within nucleotide 400~600) and 2A regions (within
nucleotide 3400~3600) were clearly demonstrated
(Figure 3a). Other examples of sequence acquisition
were provided by the analyses of the EV71-C4 (Figure
3b) and CA16-like (Figure 3c) viral strains, the structural domains of which only resembled those of EV71C1+C2 and CA16, respectively. Interestingly, in the
above three cases, the break points of recombination
were all located at the 3’ end of the 5’UTR and 2A
regions which neatly covers the entire structural (= P1)
domain of the enterovirus.
Nucleotide diversity and divergence

Average numbers of mutation per site for each year are
given in Table 2. We focused only on the major genotypes of each year, including EV71-C2 from 1998 and
EV71-B4 from 2000 to 2002. The nucleotide polymorphisms (θ) of the 5’UTR in different years were
1.52%~2.46% which were significantly lower than those
of synonymous sites (θ s ) of the three protein coding
regions (p = 0.014; Mann-Whitney test). In addition to
low polymorphism, the 5’UTR had higher proportions
of singletons than did synonymous sites of protein coding regions. Proportions of non-singletons polymorphisms, i.e., the number of mutations which occurred
more than once divided by the number of total mutations, in the 5’UTR was significant lower than those of
synonymous sites of VP1 (p = 0.021), 2A (p = 0.041),
and 3C (p = 0.041). θs values derived from different coding regions ranged 8.11%~10.03% for VP1, 8.37%
~12.33% for 2A, and 9.34%~11.38% for 3C, and the differences among them were not significant (p > 0.05).
Nevertheless, nucleotide polymorphisms at nonsynonymous sites (θa) of VP1, ranging 0.19%~0.40%, were significantly lower than those of 2A and 3C which were
0.46%~0.97% (p = 0.014). Consequently, the ratios of
nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms (θa/θs) of VP1, ranging 0.024~0.04, were 2~3-times
smaller than those of 2A and 3C (p = 0.014). We also
analyzed differences in ratios of nonsynonymous (N) to
synonymous (S) mutations among the three coding
regions. The N/S ratios for VP1, at 0.08~0.14, were
smaller than those of 2A (p = 0.001) and 3C (p =

insignificant after the singletons were removed.
Ka and Ks values between EV71 and HEV-A are shown
in Table 3. Since the outgroup of EV71 was difficult to
identify, other than for the VP1 region (Figure 2), results

are expressed as the average divergence between EV71
and different species of HEV-A. Divergences of the
5’UTR (K), ranging 0.116~0.139, were much lower than
Ks values of the protein coding regions, which ranged
1.1~1.8 (Table 3). The Ka of VP1 between EV71 and
other HEV-As, being 0.384 for EV71-B4 and 0.383 for
EV71-C2, were higher than those of 2A and 3C which
were 0.038~0.057. As a result, rates of protein evolution

Ka/Ks

after calibration by the neutral mutation rate (as presented by Ka/Ks) for VP1, at 0.211 and 0.221, were much
higher than those of 2A and 3C, at 0.023~0.034. Small
Ka and Ka/Ks values between EV71-B4 and -C2, at 0.016
and 0.015, respectively, indicated that among different
genotypes of EV71, VP1 was extremely conserved.
Tests for positive selection

Since Ks was saturated, the Ka/Ks ratio should be interpreted with care. We tested whether different protein coding regions had different selection regimes by HyPhy (see
“Methods”). The results of likelihood ratio test (LRT)
revealed no sign for codon under positive selection. In
addition, compared to VP1, 2A and 3C were under stronger purifying selection (p < 10-3 for VP1 vs. 2A, p < 0.05
for VP1 vs. 3C, and p = 0.91 for 2A vs. 3C). Therefore,
higher Ka/Ks ratio in VP1 cannot be solely imputed to the
saturation on synonymous sites, which suggests that different evolutionary forces may have dominated different
regions of the genome.
Different approaches were applied to test the hypothesis of positive selection in the VP1 region. We first performed site model tests implemented in PAML to
search for evidence of positive selection. The results of
LRTs for M1a vs. M2a and M7 vs. M8 were both insignificant, suggesting that the evidence of positive selection working on a particular codon was limited. Using
model M2a, we estimated that 98% of the codons were
subject to negative selection with an average Ka/Ks ratio
of 0.01, 2% had evolved under near neutrality with Ka/
Ks ≈ 1, and there was no site with Ka/Ks > 1. We also
used branch-site model A to test for positive selection
on individual sites along specific lineages (foreground

Wang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:294
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/294

branches). Different lineages were sequentially assigned
as foreground branches to test against the null model
with Ka/Ks = 1. This test also failed to detect a signature of positive selection on specific branches. PAML
also implemented a Suzuki and Gojobori-style [24]
method to test the effects of selection at individual sites
with changes according to ancestral states reconstructed
by the likelihood method. The results suggested that
98% of the sites were under negative selection, and that
only 2% had Ka/Ks values of > 1, but they were all insignificant. Similar results were noted in the analysis of the
poliovirus surface protein [25]. Therefore, within enterovirus, evidence of positive selection at individual sites
was limited.
Because synonymous substitutions were saturated
(Ks > 1; Table 3), the standard Ka/Ks analysis might not
be a suitable statistical test for positive selection. We,
therefore, performed computer simulations. In each of
10,000 simulations, the number of nucleotide changes
was drawn from a Poisson distribution until Ks was
equal to the average Ks between EV71 and HEV-A (see
“Methods”). Ratios of nonsynonymous (N) to synonymous (S) mutations were chosen according to the
observed N/S ratios in the polymorphisms, which were
0.10, 0.24, and 0.21 for VP1, 2A, and 3C, respectively
(Table 2). The objective of this test is to detect natural
selection in the sequences. If the selection intensity is
constant over the evolutionary time scale, the ratio of N
to S fixations should be equal to the ratio of N to S
polymorphisms. The pattern will differ, however, when
other forms of selection act on nonsynonymous mutations. Positive selection will increase the divergence relative to polymorphisms at selected sites, whereas negative
selection is expected to result in the opposite pattern.
Simulations were done for both EV71-C2 and B4, and
the results were essentially the same. For illustrative
purposes, we only present the results of genotype B4
(Figure 4). For VP1, the observed Ka and Ka/Ks values
were significantly higher than the simulated results (p <
10-3; Figure 4a), indicating accelerated fixation of amino
acid replacement substitutions. Such a pattern was
reversed for 2A and 3C (Figure 4b, c). In the 3C region,
the observed Ka and Ka/Ks values were lower than the
predictions, but the difference was insignificant. Significantly lower Ka and Ka/Ks values in the simulations
than in observations for 2A suggest the effect of negative selection preventing deleterious mutations from
becoming fixed. Deleterious mutations are usually at a
low frequency and inflate the N/S ratio of polymorphisms. This problem can be partially overcome by removing rare mutations from the sample [26]. The N/S ratio
of 2A was largely reduced, from 0.24 to 0.12 (Table 2),
after singletons were removed. We then reset the N/S
ratio from 0.24 to 0.12 for 2A in the simulation, and

Simulated Ks values were set equal to the observations. The
proportions of nonsynonymous (N) and synonymous (S) mutations
were determined according to the observed N/S ratios in
polymorphisms which were 0.10 for VP1, 0.24 and 0.12 for 2A, and
0.21 for 3C (see Table 2 and text for details). The error bar represents
1 standard deviation. p values were determined by 10,000
simulations. * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; NS, not significant (p > 0.05).

differences in Ka and Ka/Ks between observations and
predictions became non-significant (Figure 4b). In short,
when singletons were not counted, 2A and 3C showed
good agreement with the neutral mutation hypothesis.
Reduced levels of polymorphism and divergence in the
5’UTR resemble general patterns of protein evolution
and indicate that the 5’UTR was either under selection or
was subjected to a lower mutation rate than were synonymous sites. A framework, proposed by McDonald and
Kreitman (MK), of comparing levels of polymorphism
within and divergence between different viruses can distinguish neutrality from selection in the sequences [27].
If reduced levels of polymorphism and divergence in the
5’UTR can be explained by a lower mutation rate, the
ratio of polymorphisms to divergences should be similar
to that for synonymous sites. Although, the MK test was
originally developed to detect selection at classes of different sites that have the same evolutionary history, it
can also be generalized to consider other classes of
selected sites from different regions, including noncoding regions [26], even when they are completely
unlinked [28]. We then applied the MK test to the 5’UTR
of EV71-C2 vs. CA8 and EV71-C2 vs. -C1 using polymorphisms and divergence in the 3C region as a reference,
because CA8 was strongly supported as the outgroup of
EV71-C1 and -C2 in these two regions (Figure 2c, d) and
because Ks values between CA8 and EV71-C2 at 0.73 and
between EV71-C1 and -C2 at 0.42 were not saturated.
We first applied the MK test using all polymorphisms,
and the non-significant results suggested a neutral pattern of molecular evolution which seemed to support a
low mutation rate in the 5’UTR of HEV-A. Nevertheless,
since the 5’UTR exhibited many rare variants (Table 2)
which may be deleterious and are likely to be a factor
limiting the power to detect selection in the sequences
[29], we next removed all singletons from the sequences.
Applying this approach revealed a significant excess of
divergence in the 5’UTR of EV71-C2 compared to CA8
(p = 0.045; Chi-square test) and EV71-C1 (p = 0.026;
Table 4). This result suggested that a significant fraction
of divergence in the 5’UTR was probably driven to fixation by positive selection.

Population demographics and the rate of change

Evolutionary dynamics, represented by the VP1 region,
were estimated using an established Bayesian Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach that incorporates
the month of viral sampling. In the absence of natural
selection, the genetic diversity obtained reflects the
change in the effective number of infections over time
[30]. Nevertheless, a possible role of selection was
demonstrated for VP1 of EV71 in a previous section;
the plot was interpreted as a measure of the relative
genetic diversity. Changing patterns of genetic diversity
clearly showed temporal dynamics of EV71 isolated
from 1998 to 2003 (Figure 1). Two peaks, from left to
right, respectively represent the outbreak from late 1999
to 2000 (lineages 2 and 3) and the epidemic seasons of
2001 to 2003 (lineage 1). Genetic diversities were largely
reduced at the end of each epidemic season demonstrating genetic bottlenecks. Because EV71-C2 (lineage 7)
was mainly recovered in 1998 which yielded a large
uncertainty in the diversity estimation, we did not
include lineage 7 in Figure 1.
For each region, the time to the most recent common
ancestor (TMRCA) recovered from different outbreaks
was separately estimated (Table 5). For lineage 1, and
lineages 2 and 3, the TMRCAs derived from different
segments were very close, indicating that within these
epidemic seasons, different genomic regions may have
shared similar evolutionary histories. For lineage 7, the
TMRCAs of four different segments exhibited greater
variation than the above three lineages. All the TMRCAs
predated the beginning of the outbreaks. For example,
the TMRCA of VP1 of lineages 2 and 3, both of which
caused the epidemic from late 1999 to 2000, was 1998.6
(i.e., June 1998) with the 95% highest posterior density
(HPD) ranging 1997.9~1999.2. The TMRCA of VP1 for
viral strains recovered from 2001 to 2003 (lineage 1) was
2000.8 (95% HPD, 2000.5~2001.1). Since our sequences
were collected within a relatively short period of time
which may have constrained the posterior distribution of
that TMRCA, we next included VP1 sequences collected
between the 1990 s and 2003 from surrounding areas for
TMRCA estimation (see “Methods”). The results shown

in Table 5 are close to our original estimations with narrower 95% HPDs. We also performed a Bayesian MCMC
analysis using randomly associated sequences and dates.
For the VP1 region, the TMRCAs of the generated dataset were 1852 (95% HPD, 1480~1991) for lineage 1 and
1725 (95% HPD, 1063~1985) for lineages 2 and 3. Therefore, our estimation of TMRCAs is sound.
The evolutionary rates of different genomic segments of
EV71-B4 recovered in this study between 1998 and 2003
were estimated. The overall rates of change estimated by
the linear regression method for the VP1, 2A, 3C, and
5’UTR regions were 4.6 × 10-3, 6.8 × 10-3, 7.1 × 10-3, and
5.3 × 10-3 per site per year (/site/year), respectively. These
values are generally in good agreement with those derived
from the Bayesian MCMC method which were 5.7 × 10-3,

6.7 × 10-3, 6.3 × 10-3, and 5.5 × 10-3/site/year for VP1, 2A,
3C, and 5’UTR, respectively (Table 6). In addition, evolutionary rates estimated by the linear regression fell within
the 95% HPDs derived from the Bayesian MCMC
method. Similar values derived from different approaches
indicated that our estimates were authentic. For the protein coding regions, approximately 70%~90% of all
changes were synonymous changes (Table 2). We then
estimated the rate of change for the third codon position
by Bayesian MCMC and on synonymous sites by the linear regression method (see “Methods”). The evolutionary
rate for third codon position for VP1, 2A, and 3C were
1.48 × 10 -2 , 1.66 × 10 -2 , and 1.51 × 10 -2 (/site/year),
respectively. Because not all changes on the third codon
position are synonymous, these values are smaller than

Discussion
Signature of the positive selection of EV71

VP1 was previously demonstrated to have rapidly evolved
[1]. The question is whether positive selection needs to
be invoked to account for the high rate of amino acid
substitutions or whether alternative explanations of past
population demographics, relaxation of selective constraints, and elevation of the mutation rate are sufficient.
It was argued that accelerated amino acid substitutions
can occur if some nonsynonymous mutations are slightly
deleterious, and the current effective population size is
larger than the long-term effective population size [27];
this is because slightly deleterious mutations that are currently not segregated in the population may have been
fixed in the past. A historical reduction in population size
will also have generated an excess of amino acid substitutions in divergence [33]. For viruses producing only acute
infections, such as EV71 and influenza, the population
size (judged by the number of transmissions) exponentially increases during an outbreak and then experiences
a dramatic reduction after the epidemic. The population
dynamics shown in Figure 1 clearly demonstrate that
EV71 experienced dramatic population size changes
between the different epidemic seasons. Nevertheless,
while positive selection acts on specific target regions,
the influence of population demographics affects all
regions of the genome. Smaller Ka and Ka/Ks values
found in non-structural regions (2A and 3C) than in the
structural region (VP1) (Table 3) demonstrated that
accelerated amino acid substitutions in the latter are not
a genome-wide phenomenon and, thus, are unlikely to
solely be the consequence of population size changes. If
relaxation of selective constraints is responsible for the
rapid amino acid replacement between different viruses,
levels of θ a and θ a /θ s in VP1 should have increased
accordingly. This is not expected under positive selection
because mutations would have short retention times in
the population and hence would contribute little to polymorphisms. Significantly lower θa and θa/θs values in VP1
than in 2A and 3C (Table 2) indicate no sign of relaxation in the former. Finally, comparable levels of θs among
the three protein coding regions clearly illustrate no significant differences in their underlying mutation rates.
Consequently, the rapid evolution of VP1 cannot be
reconciled with past population demographics, relaxation
of selection, or differences in mutation rates. The

Page 10 of 17

contrasting patterns of polymorphism and divergence in
VP1, thus, should best be explained by the hypothesis
that positive Darwinian selection is responsible for the
high rate of amino acid replacements.
Among the three outer surface proteins, VP1, VP2, and
VP3, which comprise the outer surface of the viral capsid,
serotype-specific immune epitopes are predominantly
located in VP1 [34]. Immunization using a recombinant
VP1 protein of EV71 was shown to confer protection
against lethal EV71 infection in newborn mice, indicating
that VP1 contains important antigenic sites [35]. In addition, VP1 plays an important role in cell attachment [36].
It is, therefore, temping to speculate that VP1 is under
strong selection by host immune systems which would
result in accelerated amino acid changes between different species of HEV-A.
While our simulation results suggest positive selection in the VP1 region, codon-based LRTs failed to
detect such a signal. This inconsistency was probably
due to the following reasons. First, simulations demonstrated that LRTs are not robust to frequent recombinations [37] which is very common in enteroviruses
(Figure 3). Nevertheless, recombination does not create
contrasting patterns of polymorphisms and divergences
in different genomic regions. Second, as shown in
Tables 2 and 3, nucleotide sequences were highly
diverged between different species and genotypes of
HEV-A, but were very similar within each genotype. It
was proposed that highly biased trees might harbor too
many changes along the long branches and too few
changes along the short branches, leading to a lack of
information and low power of the detection method
[38]. Tee et al. (2010) applied globally sampled VP1
sequences and identified three putative sites under
positive selection [39], suggesting that a more comprehensive sampling may be necessary to identify site
under selection.
Couple lines of evidence also suggest that the 5’UTR
may be under positive selection. First, after singletons
were removed, the results of the MK test in Table 4
suggested an excess of nucleotide substitutions in divergence, implying the action of selection. Second, a higher
proportion of singletons in the 5’UTR than in synonymous sites of protein coding regions (Table 2) implied
that the effect of selection has kept deleterious mutations at low frequencies. The 5’UTR of EV71 contains
six putative stem-loop structures [40]. Stem-loop I is
essential for viral RNA synthesis, while stem-loop II-VI
comprise the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) necessary for translation initiation [41,42]. The maintenance
of these structure elements is critical for viral viability.
Mutations which destroy base pairing within the stem
are therefore deleterious [42] and will be eliminated or
kept in low frequency. On the other hand,

Wang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:294
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/294

compensatory mutations which restore base pairing
might have to be fixed at once in order to maintain
proper secondary structure. In short, the 5’UTR plays
important roles for viral RNA synthesis and translation
initiation, and the reduced levels of polymorphism and
divergence may be a result of selection.
Mechanism generating new genotypes

It was proposed that recombination contributed to the
emergence of various species/genotypes of enterovirus
[43]. Instead of random recombinations, however, we
observed a consistent phenomenon of acquiring the P1
domain from different genotypes or species of HEV-A.
It is unreasonable to expect that chance alone would
generate such a repeating pattern (Figure 3). Frequent
sequence shuffling, i.e., acquiring a piece of a nucleotide
sequence from different viruses, may have had important impacts on the evolution of enteroviruses. As
shown by the signature of positive selection in the VP1
region, it is possible that acquiring the P1 domain from
donors which carry rapid and presumably adaptive
changes would cause these recipient viral strains to gain
immediate advantage over others. Consequently, based
on the current molecular genetic analysis and previous
phylogenetic studies [23,43], we hypothesized that positive selection and frequent domain shuffling are two
important mechanisms for generating new types of
enteroviruses.
It must be pointed out that the results in Figure 3 do
not themselves provide evidence that these genotypes
were generated by recombination between particular
viral strains. For example, in the analysis of EV71-C1
+C2, when we used either EV71-B or EV71-A, separately,
or combined them as one reference group, the results
were identical. But when EV71-A and -B were both presented as different reference groups, neither of them
showed high relatedness with EV71-C1+C2 in the P1
domain. That is because both EV71-A and -B are equal
distances from EV71-C1+C2 in that region (Figure 2a).
Therefore, it is possible that EV71-C1+C2 was generated
by ancestral sequences of CA8 and EV71 or viral strains
very close to them.

Page 11 of 17

the viral strains causing the 1999~2000 outbreak were
first sampled in September 1999 (1999.75; Figure 1). As
the TMRCA estimated for that outbreak ranged
1998.6~1998.9, the above hypothesis suggests that the
virus had been circulating for approximately a year
before it was sampled. Nevertheless, as EV71 has been
rigorously monitored since the 1998 outbreak in Taiwan, it seems unlikely that the virus was able to remain
unnoted or did not cause any severe case for almost a
year while in circulation. Furthermore, the estimated
TMRCAs were all beyond the beginning of the outbreak
in which they were sampled (Table 5). To further investigate the phylogenetic origin of different lineages, we
acquired EV71 sequences from surrounding areas during
the 1990 s to 2003. Phylogenetic relationships of different viral strains is given in Figure 5. Lineage 7 is phylogenetically close to viral strains reported in Malaysia,
Australia, and Japan between 1995 and 1999. Lineage 4
from 1998 and 1999 was tightly clustered with the B4
strain from Malaysia in 1997. Lineages 2 and 3 were
grouped with viral isolates from Malaysia between 1999
and 2000. Finally, lineage 1 was closest to the B4 strain

Origin of local outbreaks

Observations of high viral diversity during epidemic
peaks with periodic reductions suggest that either the
viruses were maintained in the population and across
inter-epidemic intervals or the viruses were imported
from other sources as shown in a previous study [13].
Co-circulation of different viral genotypes in extremely
low frequencies might be an indication of the former
(Table 1). It is possible that these viral strains had been
in circulation for some time before the number of
cases became large enough to be noted. For example,

(EV) 71 isolates in Taiwan between 1998 and 2003 and from

from Australia in 2000. Figure 5 suggests that EV71 in
Taiwan is frequently imported and perhaps moves from
and to surrounding areas. Because local viral isolates
showed more than 97% identity to their sister group
which had been circulating in surrounding areas immediately prior to an outbreak, the importation of viral
strains to the local area is the most parsimonious explanation. Both TMRCAs and phylogenetic analyses failed
to support the maintenance of viral diversity locally.
Alternatively, our results may actually indicate that viral
diversities were not maintained in the local area, but
were imported from other sources.
Our conclusion of viral importation is not consistent
with previous study which suggested that EV71 outbreaks caused by the same subgenotype in different
countries may be the result of different lineages and
were less likely to have been caused by transmission
between countries [39]. This conclusion was drawn
from the analysis of VP1 sequences at global scale,
nevertheless. It is possible that different lineages are
indeed maintained in a large area with occasional movement of viral lineages between continents, while within
each area, e.g. east Asia, transmissions between borders
may be still common [13].
Evolutionary rate estimation

Our estimated rates of change for synonymous sites of
2A and 3C were close to that of the poliovirus (3.96 ×
10 -2 /site/year) [31], but higher than estimations by
Hanada et al. (1.00 × 10-2) [32], and Brown et al. (1.35 ×
10-2) [11] of enterovirus. This discrepancy is reconcilable by distinguishing the mutation rate, which is related
to the tempo of change at the population level, from the
substitution rate, which reflects long-term evolutionary
change. When mutations are selectively neutral, or
nearly so, the rate at which they are generated (the
mutation rate) should have a simple relation with the
rate of fixation (the substitution rate) [44]. Deviation
from this neutral expectation can reveal fundamental
aspects of evolutionary and biological processes [32,45].
Under negative selection, mildly deleterious mutations
can linger in populations, contributing to polymorphisms, but have little chance of fixation [46]. Therefore,
the rate of evolutionary change based on populationlevel estimates would be larger than those based on
long-term follow-up studies, as the former includes
mutations doomed by elimination. In our simulations,
after singletons were removed, the difference in N/S
ratios between polymorphisms and divergences became
insignificant (region 2A, Figure 4b), indicating the existence of low-frequency deleterious mutations in polymorphisms. The rates of change for the poliovirus [31]
and EV71 in the current study were derived in a short
period of time and are expected to be close to

Page 12 of 17

population-level estimates. It is then not unreasonable
that these values are larger than those of previous longterm studies [11,32].
The above scenario can also explain the seemingly counterintuitive observation that the rate of change for the VP1
capsid protein was slower than those of 2A and 3C which
have only internal functions (Table 6). It is generally
expected that segments expressed on the surface of a virion will have higher rates of evolutionary change than
those that only have internal functions, because the former
have roles in immune evasion. We showed that VP1 has
experienced strong positive selection which increased its
divergence and decreased polymorphisms. As a result, the
rate of change derived from the polymorphic data should
be slower for VP1, because strong selection makes the
population less polymorphic (Table 2).
Lack of recombination in the current viral isolates

Only one recombination event identified in 401 viral
isolates seems inconsistent with the general notion that
enteroviruses frequently recombine. Nevertheless, except
for the year 2000, there was only one dominant lineage
in each epidemic season. The chance of recombination
between different lineages was, thus, reduced. In addition, levels of nucleotide variations within lineages were
<1%. Most methods for detecting recombinations perform poorly at this level of divergence [47]. It is, then,
not surprising that only one recombined viral strain was
identified. It is worth pointing out that even though
there might be a small chance of unidentified recombinants, our conclusions might not or only minimally be
affected for a couple of reasons. First, recombination
within a lineage does not change the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations or the N/S ratio
in a circulating viral population, and, thus, will not
influence the observed nucleotide diversities and simulation results. Second, in the analysis of the TMRCA and
mutation rate, BEAST assumes no recombination and
accounts for deviations from this in the data with multiple mutations. As a result, it may overestimate genetic
diversities and mutation rates (Table 5) with the existence of recombinations [48]. While the effect of recombinations on TMRCA estimations is still being debated
[49-51], TMRCAs from different regions were in generally agreement with each other. Thus, unless different
genomic regions have similar patterns of recombination,
the existence of unidentified recombinations, if any,
should not largely affect our conclusions.

Conclusions
Contrasting patterns of polymorphisms and divergences between different protein coding regions suggest that different evolutionary forces have been
dominant in different regions of the EV71 genome.

The results of a computer simulation demonstrated a
significant excess of amino acid replacements in the
VP1 region of local viral isolates which implies a possible role of adaptive evolution. Among different species
of HEV-A, exchange of the P1 domain was frequently
observed. We propose that positive selection followed
by domain shuffling contributed to the emergence of
new HEV-A genotypes. Consistent patterns of an
increase in viral diversity in the epidemic peak followed by severe diversity reduction were observed in
different epidemic seasons. In addition, the viruses
sampled in local successive epidemic seasons were not
sister to each other, indicating that annual outbreaks
of EV71 were due to genetically distinct lineages. It is
likely that the importation of EV71 from surrounding
areas contributed to local outbreaks.

Methods
Viral isolation, reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), and sequencing

Throat swabs, rectal swabs, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
were obtained from patients who had clinical manifestations of HFMD or herpangina, viral exanthema, viral
meningitis, encephalitis, polio-like syndrome, or cardiopulmonary failure with CNS involvement at Chang Gung
Children’s Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan. Viral isolation was
performed by inoculating human embryonic fibroblast
(MRC-5), LLC-MK2, HEp-2, and RD cell cultures with
the above specimens. Once the enteroviral cytopathic
involvement exceeded 50% of the cell mono-layer,
cells were scraped off and subjected to indirect fluorescent antibody staining with a panenteroviral antibody
(catalog no. 3360, Chemicon International, Temecula,
CA) to confirm the enterovirus. These isolates were
subsequently identified as EV71 by an immunofluorescence assay if they had simultaneously positive immunofluorescence reactions to both EV71-specific antibodies
(catalog nos. 3323 and 3324, Chemicon International).
EV71 isolates were found in 395 EV71 patients from
1998 to2003. Six cases were identified as EV71 by the
immunofluorescence assay which turned out to be the
coxsackievirus A16-like virus based on their VP1
sequences (see “Results”). Therefore, 401 isolates were
collected and processed for this study. The demographic
data, clinical severity, the year of isolation, and the site of
the specimens are listed in Additional file 1, Table S1.
EV71 isolates were stored at -80°C and re-cultured in
rhadomyosarcome (RD) cells. Viral RNA was extracted
from RD cells using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A one-step RT-PCR was performed using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Additional file 4, Table S2,
lists the primers and PCR conditions for different genomic
regions of EV71, including the 5’UTR, VP1, 2A, and 3C.

After amplification of the viral RNA, the PCR products
were purified using a High Pure PCR Product Purification
Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Cycle sequencing was performed using an ABI Prism BigDye® Terminator cycle sequencing kit and ABI Prism 3730 DNA
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Sequence analysis

Sequences were aligned using ClustalW [52] and edited
manually. Watterson’s estimator of nucleotide diversity (θ)
was calculated using the custom C++ software based on
the libsequence package [53]. For protein coding regions,
mutations were classified as either synonymous or nonsynonymous, and from these we calculated the nucleotide
diversity for synonymous (θs) and nonsynonymous (θa)
sites. Numbers of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and numbers of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) were calculated
according to the modified Nei and Gojobori method
[54,55]. This method has two advantages. First, when
sequence divergence is high, the number of inapplicable
cases is much lower than that with other methods [56-58].
Second, its calculations take the transitional/transversional
(TS/TV) mutation bias into account. Because of a high
viral mutation rate, nucleotide substitutions in synonymous sites were saturated (Ks > 1, see “Results”). In addition, mutations in EV71 were highly biased toward
transitions. In the Ka and Ks calculations, TS/TV ratios of
different genomic segments were determined based on the
results of model selection (see below).
Recombination and phylogenetic reconstruction

Three methods, including the method of Sawyer [21]
implemented in GENECONV 1.81a http://www.math.
wustl.edu/~sawyer, the homoplasy test [20] implemented in START [59], and GARD (Genetic Algorithm
Recombination Detection) [22] available online http://
Datamonkey.org [60] were applied to detect possible
recombination events between and within EV71 genotypes. The first is suitable for 5%~20% nucleotide differences which was the range of divergence between
different genotypes of EV71, and the second is particularly useful for <5% differences, which was the level of
divergence within genotypes. The numbers of permutations were 10,000 for GENECONV and 1000 for the
homoplasy test. The significance level used was 5%. To
visualize the recombination break points, the bootscan
program implemented in SIMPLOT [61] was applied.
We used a sliding window size of 200 nucleotides
with a step size of 20 nucleotides. TS/TV ratios were
estimated from the sequences. NJ trees were estimated
using F84 distances, and bootstrap support values
were obtained from 500 replicates. Bootstrap values
were then plotted along the position of the genome.

Wang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:294
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/294

A recombination event was suggested when high levels
of phylogenetic relatedness (>70% bootstrap values)
between the query group and more than one reference
group in different genomic regions were observed. Bootscan was further applied to detect possible recombinations between different species of HEV-A. All settings
were the same, except that a sliding window of 400
nucleotides was used.
The nucleotide substitution model for phylogenetic
reconstruction was determined by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [62] using Modeltest 3.06 [63] and
is listed in the online Additional file 5. The neighborjoining (NJ) tree was constructed using PAUP* vers.
4.0b10. The maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis was
conducted using PhyML 3.0 online [64] with the starting
tree derived from the NJ method, and the NNI topology
search option was used. Bayesian inference (BI) was performed using MrBayes vers. 3.1.2 [65]. Analyses were
initiated with random starting trees, and Metropoliscoupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses
were run for 4 × 106 generations and sampled every 100
generations. The first 4000 trees were excluded while
the remaining 36000 trees were retained to compute a
50% majority-rule consensus tree. Human enterovirus
(HEV)-A, including coxsackievirus A2 (CA2), CA3,
CA4, CA5, CA6, CA7, CA8, CA10, CA12, CA14, and
CA16, and the prototype EV71 BrCr-CA-70 (EV71- A)
were also included in the tree construction with enterovirus 90, AY773285 and AB192877, as the outgroups.
Bootstrap replications for nodal support were 500 for
the ML and 1000 for the NJ analyses. To further trace
the origin of the viruses, we included and aligned EV71
sequences from surrounding areas in the 1990 s to 2003
[11,13,15,17,18]. Phylogenetic relationships of these
sequences were constructed using the NJ method with
1000 bootstrap replications.
Computer simulation

To test whether nucleotide substitutions in different
genomic regions followed the neutral mutation hypothesis, i.e., variations within populations and divergences
between species were both mainly due to neutral or
nearly neutral mutations, we carried out the following
computer simulations. (1) Using the consensus sequence
of EV71-B4 or -C2 as a starting point, the position of
change in the sequence was randomly chosen. (2) For
different protein coding regions, the change was then
determined to be either synonymous (S) or nonsynonymous (N) according to the N/S ratio of the polymorphism. Stop codon changes were not counted. (3) The
change was then assigned as a transition or transversion
based on the results of the model selection (see “Additional file 5“). (4) The process was repeated until the Ks
value equaled the average Ks value between EV71 and

Page 14 of 17

HEV-A. (5) The simulation was repeated 10,000 times.
The results were tallied for each replicate, and distributions were used to determine the p value for the
observed Ka and Ka/Ks values.
Codon-based maximum likelihood ratio test for positive
selection

To detect the signal of positive selection, two
approaches were applied. Natural selection can be
detected by comparing Ks with Ka. Ka > Ks indicates
positive selection, whereas Ka < Ks indicates negative
selection. Several methods were developed to test for
positive selection that acts on given branches (branch
method), on a subset of sites (site method), or at individual sites along specific branches (branch-site method)
[66-68]. To identify the putative amino acid residues
under positive selection and to estimate the strength of
the selection, two pairs of likelihood-based models
implemented in the PAML [69] package was used.
These models allow the Ka/Ks ratio to vary among sites.
The first pair include M1a (nearly neutral) and M2a
(positive selection) [70], while the second pair includes
M7 (beta) and M8 (beta&ω) [71]. We also used branchsite test 2 to detect positive selection of the lineages of
interest [68]. To test whether different protein coding
regions are under similar selection regimes, we used
dNdSDistributionComparison.bf implemented in HyPhy
2.0 [22]. This program divides codons into four categories, two negatively selected (Ka < Ks), one neutral
(Ka = Ks), and one positively selected (Ka > Ks), and
tests whether different genes have similar (1) strengths
of positive selection, (2) proportions of sites under positive selection, and (3) distributions for all sites.
Estimates of population dynamics and evolutionary rates

The evolutionary dynamics of EV71 were estimated
using an established Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) approach [72,73] that incorporates the
exact month of viral sampling. This approach estimates
the rate of nucleotide changes and the dynamics of
population genetic diversity through time [74]. In addition, the time to the most recent common ancestor
(TMRCA) of viruses isolated from each epidemic season
was also estimated. Because EV71-C2 was mainly recovered from the 1998 epidemic season, the mutation rate
and population dynamic estimated were primarily based
on EV71-B4 collected from 1998 to 2003.
The analyses were performed using the SRD06 [75]
model of nucleotide substitution by BEAST v1.4.8. Both
strict and relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular
clock model [76] were used and the results are essentially the same (Bayes factor = 0.18). For population
demographic, three models, including constant size,
exponential growth, and Bayesian skyline plot (BSP)

Wang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:294
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/294

[74], were tested and the BSP performed significantly
better than the other two (Bayes factor > 20). In cases
where sequences were sampled in the same month with
higher than 99% nucleotide identity, four of the
sequences were randomly selected. This resulted in a
dataset of 145 EV71-B4 and 22 EV71-C2 sequences
(listed in the “Additional file 5“). For each genetic segment, we used two independent runs with 2 × 10 7
MCMC steps, of which the first 10% was discarded as
burn-in. The results were compared to confirm that
both were sampling the same distribution and then were
combined. The log files were checked using TRACER,
and the effective sample size for each parameter was
found to exceed 200. Since the time span in this study
was less than 6 years, in order to test whether the
sequences contained a sufficient signal to estimate evolutionary rates and divergence time, two approaches
were applied. First, we included 108 and 48 dated B4
and C2 sequences, respectively, from other areas
between the 1990 s and 2003 [11,13,15,17,18] for the
TMRCA estimation (listed in the “Additional file 5“).
Second, we randomized the sampling dates of our
sequences and repeated the BEAST analysis [77]. In the
second analysis only Taiwanese sequences were used.
The 95% HPDs of real and randomized data were compared to test whether the distributions overlapped.
The evolutionary rate was also estimated for EV71-B4
by a linear regression of the genetic distance from the
oldest isolate versus the time of isolation. For each protein coding region, two separate analyses were conducted: one for all nucleotide positions (representative
of both synonymous and nonsynonymous changes) and
a second one for only synonymous changes. The former
was calculated based on the best model suggested by
Modeltest and the latter was calculated according to the
modified Nei and Gojobori method.
