Abstract
Background: The Yakuts contrast strikingly with other populations from Siberia due to their cattle- and horsebreeding economy as well as their Turkic language. On the basis of ethnological and linguistic criteria as well as
population genetic studies, it has been assumed that they originated from South Siberian populations. However,
many questions regarding the origins of this intriguing population still need to be clarified (e.g. the precise origin
of paternal lineages and the admixture rate with indigenous populations). This study attempts to better understand
the origins of the Yakuts by performing genetic analyses on 58 mummified frozen bodies dated from the 15th to
the 19th century, excavated from Yakutia (Eastern Siberia).
Results: High quality data were obtained for the autosomal STRs, Y-chromosomal STRs and SNPs and mtDNA due
to exceptional sample preservation. A comparison with the same markers on seven museum specimens excavated
3 to 15 years ago showed significant differences in DNA quantity and quality. Direct access to ancient genetic data
from these molecular markers combined with the archaeological evidence, demographical studies and
comparisons with 166 contemporary individuals from the same location as the frozen bodies helped us to clarify
the microevolution of this intriguing population.
Conclusion: We were able to trace the origins of the male lineages to a small group of horse-riders from the CisBaïkal area. Furthermore, mtDNA data showed that intermarriages between the first settlers with Evenks women
led to the establishment of genetic characteristics during the 15th century that are still observed today.

Background
The Yakuts (or Sakhas) from the Republic of Sakha are
of particular interest because they contrast with other
populations from Siberia in many respects such as in
their specific funeral practices. Before Christianization,
part of the population was buried, which is exceptional
in this region of the world as most bodies were put in
aerial graves on platforms or on trees. At the same time,
the Yakuts are considered as the most remarkable example of northward expansion into Siberia [1] and especially as these semi-nomadic herders contrast so
strikingly with surrounding Siberian populations on the
basis of their Turkic language and their horse- and cattle-breeding economy. The geographic specificities of
Central Yakutia, favorable to the development of a pastoralist economy and reflecting the environmental

conditions of the South, certainly initiated the development of the Yakut culture in this region. Although several hypotheses regarding the geographic origin of this
atypical population have been proposed from results of
the first archaeological investigations of AP Okladnikov
[2] to the latest population genetic studies [3-6], the
precise origins of the Yakuts and their admixture with
the indigenous tribes of Siberia, especially the Tungus,
have been debated. Nevertheless, archaeological data
currently agree with the appearance of the Yakut culture
around the 14th century A.D. [7].
Recent population genetics data tend to support a dual
origin for the maternal lineages of the Yakuts and
admixture with the Tungus, and demonstrate that the
paternal lines observed today result from a strong bottleneck that led to the restriction of these lineages in
the Yakut population [3,4,6]. This does not, however,
address the question of the number of settlers and the
precise origin of the paternal lineages, or the admixture

rate with indigenous populations [6]. Furthermore, the
demographic changes occurring in the Yakut population
since the Russian colonization make it difficult to reconstruct the genetic history using present day samples.
Russians came into contact with the Yakuts in 1632.
Christianization began around 1760 and by the beginning of the 19 th century, a Christian ritual was performed in the majority of burials. From the 17th to the
19th century smallpox and measles epidemics, caused by
contact with Russians settlers, decimated the Yakut people and their neighbors, and during the Second World
War a large proportion of young Yakut males was killed.
Therefore ancient DNA (aDNA), which allows the direct
study of an ancient population without their descendants, represents a major advantage in order to avoid
the possible bias represented by recent genetic events
[8,9].
This study adopts a population genetics approach to
an ancient sample composed of 65 individuals from
Central Yakutia in order to address the questions
detailed above. Human aDNA studies’ outcome quality
is closely related to the preservation of DNA and to the
absence of potential contaminations (Figure 1). The
environmental conditions present in Yakutia, one of the
coldest parts of the world, are generally favorable to a
good preservation of nucleic acids. Indeed, the exceptional preservation state of most of the excavated graves
enabled us to successfully analyze several samples collected from 58 frozen bodies or skeletons from the last
six centuries (Figure 2).

Results
Nuclear DNA quantification

The results of the nuclear DNA quantification are summarized in Table 1. The purification protocol was efficient in removing inhibitors in all except six bone
extracts. In order to avoid the effect of PCR inhibitors,
the samples YAKa33, 36, 69, 70 and 79 were diluted by
a factor of 1/2 to 1/5 and successful amplifications were
subsequently obtained. For the sample YAKa28 it was
not possible to remove the inhibitors and therefore no
results were obtained for further amplifications. No inhibitors were detected in the teeth or hair extracts. Moreover, the DNA extracts obtained from teeth showed the
highest mean concentration of nuclear DNA and the
highest frequency of samples yielding a concentration
superior to 100 pg.μl-1.
Y-chromosomal analyses

The multiplex amplification of the Y-chromosomal
STRs was successful for 27 of the 38 (71%) male samples, where full profiles or profiles with only one missing
marker were obtained (See Additional file 1). The lowest
amplification success rate (69%) was observed for the

Page 2 of 16

DYS392 locus that is the largest marker included in the
STR panel. All loci with a length over 200 bp showed
more than 20% amplification failures. This molecular
behavior is a well known phenomenon and has been
described as an effective way to ensure the authenticity
of results [10].
Twelve different haplotypes were observed. Nine were
unique, one was common to two individuals (YAKa17
and 19) and two haplotypes were widely shared among
our ancient sample set. These two haplotypes were present in eight (Ht1: YAKa15, 21, 29, 31, 34, 39, 40, 41)
and seven individuals (Ht2: YAKa64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70,
78), and differed from each other by only one mutation
step at the loci DYS389II and DYS392. Therefore, Ht1
and Ht2 could share a recent common ancestor, since
two mutation events in a single father/son transmission
have been previously described [11]. Besides, Ht1 and
Ht2 were the most frequent lineages in our present day
sample set (Ht1: 16.5% and Ht2: 27.8%) as well as in the
data published by Pakendorf et al [6] (Ht1: 43% and
Ht2: 10%).
The genetic diversity indices (Table 2) show equivalent values for the ancient and the present day sample
sets of our study. Surprisingly, the diversity observed in
our Central Yakut sample set is higher than the one
presented by Pakendorf et al [6] although the samples
were collected in the same area.
Sixty one percent (8 out of 13) of the haplotypes (Ht1,
Ht2, Yaka56, 65, 71, 80, 81, 86) were affiliated to the
N1c (TAT-C) haplogroup on the basis of the SNP analyses. This haplogroup is considered as the most frequent in the Yakut population, and its frequency varies
across studies from 75% [12] to 100% [13]. Sample
YAKa26 was affiliated to haplogroups K. The SNP typing was inconclusive for 5 individuals (YAKa17, 19, 47,
49 and 57); nevertheless the affiliation to N1c was
excluded on the basis of the absence of the TAT-C
mutation.
Although all the Y-STR haplotypes have been transmitted to the present day Yakuts, only a few of them
are shared with other populations. A comparison to the
YHRD database and other literature data showed that
only Ht1 and the haplotype of the YAKa26 individual
matched with Evenk male lineages; confirming the specificity of the N1c lineages. In this case, one can assume
that N1c comes from Yakut ancestors considering the
low N1c frequency in Evenks [6,14]. Moreover, the ethnical affiliation of one individual to either the Yakut or
the Evenk population could be difficult nowadays, considering that these two ethnic groups share a similar
lifestyle or language in some areas of Yakutia. The YSTR haplotypes of YAKa17 and YAKa26 were found in
present day Mongols, Buryats, Kalmyks and Central
Asians.

performed. 1: Tattinsky, 2: Churapchinsky, 3: Khangalassky.

The MDS plot based on pairwise Fst values clearly
shows the separation of the Yakuts from all the other
populations, since the ancient and present day Yakuts
are clearly isolated (Figure 3). Indeed, the Fst distance
computations revealed significant differences for each
comparison excepted for the two Yakut sample sets.
The median network based on the Y-STR haplotypes
belonging to the N1c haplogroup is undoubtedly affected
by sample sizes. Nevertheless, the separation between the
Yakuts and the other populations is visible (Figure 4).
Indeed, both ancient and present day Yakuts are grouped

in one isolated cluster together with the Evenks. The different haplotypes of this cluster are separated by one
mutation step (except YAKa56), indicating that these closely related paternal lineages have emerged from a
reduced number of individuals in a short period of time.
This observation is consistent with earlier studies [6,15].
Mitochondrial DNA analysis

The HVS-1 sequences were unambiguously validated for
60 individuals (See Additional file 2). Five subjects were
excluded from the analysis: YAKa28, 42, 48, 49 and 72.

No amplification was obtained for the sample YAKa28
due to the presence of inhibitors in the DNA extracts.
Amplification failures were also observed for the sample
YAKa42 and only one of the two sub-regions of HVS-1
was successfully amplified for sample YAKa72. Finally,
multiple heteroplasmies were observed in the electropherograms of YAKa48 and 49. The fact that these two
samples were collected in museums, increasing the risk
of pre-laboratory contamination, led us to exclude these
two subjects from our study.

Two heteroplasmic positions were observed for three
distinct samples. One T/C heteroplasmy at position
16093 was observed in the samples YAKa20 and
YAKa39 in teeth and hair DNA extracts only. This heteroplasmic position is observed in the present day Yakut
population (this study; [6]) and is also well known as a
hotspot of post-mortem damage [16]. The second heteroplasmy was observed at position 16293 in the sample
YAKa58. This position has been reported as a potential
post-mortem mutation [16]. Therefore, these

heteroplasmic sites were treated as missing data for
these specific samples in all the subsequent analyses.
Gene diversity in our ancient sample was calculated
using the ARLEQUIN 2.001 program and then compared with different populations. Both ancient and present day populations from Central Yakutia showed a
gene diversity of 0.9627 (+/- 0.0117). This value is in
agreement with the data from [6]. We observed 30 different haplotypes among the 60 studied individuals, and
19 were found only once. Twenty nine haplotypes were
assigned to different haplogroups with the near matching method. The subject YAKa83, plausibly a young

shaman from the early 18 th century, was affiliated to
haplogroup H6 due to the typing of coding region SNPs
[17] since the assignment on the basis of the HVS-1
haplotype was inconclusive.
The overall haplogroup distribution (Table 3) in our
ancient sample set corresponds with earlier studies
focused on the present day Yakuts [6,18-20]. As can be
seen in Table 3, the ancient Yakuts present high frequencies of haplogroups C and D. Haplogroup C and
specifically the lineage C4 represents the most abundant haplogroup in our ancient sample set with a frequency of 30%. The highest frequency of this lineage is
observed in the Evenks, but C4 is also prevalent in
South-Western Siberian populations such as Tuvans,
Buryats and Tofalars [15,21]. Among haplogroup D,
the D5 lineage is present in seven out of 13 individuals
and represents 12.5% of the ancient sample set (the
analysis of the autosomal STRs revealed that YAKa34,
35, 36, 37 and 38 shared close familial relationships,
therefore only one individual was included in the calculations). This sub-haplogroup is usually present at
low frequency in Siberian populations [15,21,22] and
in Central Asian or Mongolian populations [23,24].
Interestingly, the two most frequent D5 haplotypes
seem to share a recent common ancestor as they differ

[6]. The Buryat ascendance of the D5 lineages demonstrated in their analyses was not clearly supported by
our ancient DNA data.
The sequence of YAKa23 belonged to haplogroup
A4b, that is present at low frequencies in Western and
Middle Siberian populations such as the Mansis, Tuvans

and Evenks [21,22]. YAKa78 was assigned to the novel
haplogroup A8, found in the Kalmyks and Buryats [15].
Two haplotypes were assigned to haplogroup B:
YAKa24 to subhaplogroup B4, which is dispersed
throughout Mongolia and China [25,26] and the
sequences of YAKa52 and YAKa53 to subhaplogroup B5
due to the presence of transitions at positions 16111,
16140, 16189 and 16243, also present in one Buryat studied by Derenko et al [27].

Two sequences belonged to the F1b lineage (YAKa22
and YAKa68), widespread in populations from South
Siberia [27]. The haplotype of YAKa71 was affiliated to
the M13a subhaplogroup present in Buryats, Khamnigans [15] and Mongols [28].
The proportion of the sequences affiliated to the West
Eurasian haplogroups (H, J, K, T and W) was low in our
ancient sample set, as the merged frequencies corresponded to 8.3% (5 samples). The sequence of YAKa83
was affiliated to subhaplogroup H6 which is characteristic for Central Asians [29] and less frequent in Western
Europe. These sequences were observed in samples distributed in the second and third period, and no increase
in the frequency of the West Eurasian lineages could be
noted for the period following the Russian colonization.
Besides, these haplogroups are observed at similar frequencies in various Siberian populations [21,27].
The size of the sample set should be considered as a
potential source of bias in the overall haplogroup distribution. Nevertheless, we observed the same distribution
as was found in the present day population. This statement has been verified by the calculation of the Fst distances since there are no significant distances between
the Yakuts from the pre-colonization era and the ones
from the Christian and present day periods.

Sub-haplogroup frequencies have been merged under the name of the basal
haplogroup to simplify the comparison. Frequencies are given in percent.

In an attempt to trace the origins of the ancient
mtDNA lineages, each haplotype was compared to data
from the literature (See Additional file 3). This comparison showed that more that 73% of the haplotypes found
in our ancient samples have been transmitted to the
present day Yakut population. Among the nine haplotypes absent in the present day Yakuts, four were not
found in any of the populations included in the database
due to their unique combination of polymorphisms or
private mutations. The haplotypes belonging to haplogroup C are shared with various populations but most
specifically with Buryats (6 out of 11 haplotypes), Evenks
(5 out of 11) and Tuvans (6 out of 11). On the contrary
the sequences assigned to haplogroup D appear to be
more restricted to the Yakut population. This specificity
is even higher for the D5 lineages since they are shared
only with two Yakut speaking Evenks, one Buryat, one
Mongol and one Daur.
To evaluate if this comparison could bring some information on the different migration waves which led to
the formation of the Yakuts, we took the chronological
repartition of the samples into consideration. Unfortunately, this approach failed to reveal any clear pattern,
since individuals from different periods were distributed
among all the haplogroups and matched to populations
without any identifiable preference.
The MDS plot based on Fst distances (Figure 5)
revealed, as for the Y-chromosomal STRs, a high stability through time of the maternal lineages. Indeed, the
distances between the chronological groups were not
significant. Besides, the Fst values confirm the previous
statements based on the comparison of individuals since
non-significant distances were observed between ancient
Yakuts, Evenks and Tuvans.
In order to clarify the previously obtained results,
migration rates were computed with the MIGRATE
software. The populations used for the analyses were
selected taking the previous results into consideration.
To avoid a potential bias related to the sample size,
ancient Yakuts from different periods were merged into
one group. As mentioned earlier, this approximation
should not be deleterious since the two groups showed
non-significant genetic distances. The results are presented in Table 4 and indicate that the major genetic
contribution to the maternal lineages of the Yakuts
came from the Evenks. This observation could be
explained by the fact that new settlers were more susceptible to admixture than the autochthonous population due to their reduced number and to their cultural
practices (e.g. paternal exogamy). This assumption is
also corroborated by the higher genetic diversity of the
ancient Yakuts compared to the Evenks and by the
important number of mtDNA lineages shared with this
population.

First presence of the Yakutian ancestors and
demographic data

The first Yakut graves discovered are dated from the
15th and 16th century. From this period until 1689, only
male graves with horse riding equipment (children and
adults) and weapons from the steppe area (in most adult
ancient graves) are found. The funerary ritual was influenced more by Turkish than by Mongolian culture
(although this changed at the beginning of the 18th century). It is unlikely that these graves are the first graves
of the new settlers, and it is more probable that this
period corresponds to the first time with a relatively
high population density. During this early period, Ychromosomal Ht1 and Ht2 are already present. Simulations (Table 5) suggest two possibilities: either a very
small group arrived around the 10th century, or a more
important one arrived between the disintegration of the
Mongol empire (around 1294 AD) and the discovery of
the first graves.
Authenticity of sequences and profiles

The possibility that our data arose from contaminated
DNA was considered highly unlikely, since morphological and molecular typing results for sex determination
were always in accordance with each other. Moreover,

no contamination was observed in the extraction or the
PCR blanks. Reproducible PCR results were obtained
from multiple extractions and amplifications of the
same samples performed at different times.
The choice of autosomal STR markers as a first
approach for analyzing the ancient Yakut remains was
based on their ability to detect degraded and/or contaminated DNA. 57 out of the 65 human samples
yielded amplifiable DNA for more than two markers,
but only 20 of the genetic profiles were complete (See
Additional file 4). The loci D18S51, CSFP1O, D7S820
and D2S1338 were often not amplified, probably
because they are expressed in the higher molecular
weight range. Such an inverse dependence of the

40,000 people is an historical estimation for 1632 AD and we have made estimation for different steps: the beginning of the 9th century, which is a period of an
important Mongolo-Turkish expansion with some contacts between these populations and Yakutia [1], 1294 AD which corresponds to the disintegration of the
Mongol Empire with the dispersion of many nomad groups, and 1400 AD, a date prior to the most ancient Yakut graves excavated.

amplification efficiency on the size of the DNA fragment
to be amplified is typical of DNA retrieved from ancient
remains and results from the degradation of the DNA
[10].
Various factors are thought to affect the success of
DNA analysis from ancient tissues: (i) the time from
excavation [9,30,31], as post-excavation storage conditions are less favorable for DNA preservation than preexcavation condition, (ii) the cortical thickness of long
bones which favors good DNA preservation (cf. the case
of horses) and (iii) the age-at-death of the individual, as
it is more difficult to obtain profiles from newborn compared to adult bone. Thus, as time passes after excavation, one would expect a reduction in the number of
endogenous DNA and an increase in the number of
exogenous contaminant template DNA molecules
extracted from a tissue sample, with additional difficulties for newborn and young children compared to adult
samples. Of the ten human samples that yielded no STR
profiles, four came from the museum and six from frozen burials including four newborn samples.

Discussion
During the last few years, several studies have focused
on the Yakuts using genetic analyses to trace their origins [4-6,20,32-36]. However, to date the use of ancient
DNA has been limited due to small numbers of individuals sampled [37,38], in spite of the exceptional taphonomic conditions of Siberia and the possibility of
retrieving high quality DNA from remains buried in the
permafrost [39,40]. Therefore, this study represents the
first attempt to trace the origins of the Yakut population
by ancient DNA analyses.
Out of the 65 ancient individuals analyzed in this
study, 27 complete Y-chromosomal STR haplotypes
were obtained from 38 male individuals, and mtDNA
sequences were validated for 60 individuals. The quality
of the results obtained in our study may be explained by
the presence of permafrost which favors the preservation of DNA [41]. The excavation strategy and the
absence of any post-excavation treatment prior to
laboratory analyses might have played an important role

in the quality of DNA and confirms the statements of
Pruvost et al. [31]. Besides, this limited handling of the
ancient remains represents a key factor in the reduction
of contamination risk by modern DNA. The combination of the precautions against contamination and the
validation strategy (i.e. comparison between the profiles
of the samples and the researchers, analyses of different
substrates, multiple analysis of one sample, phylogenetic
validation of the mtDNA sequences) validate the data
presented here, even if not all the traditional criteria
[42] could be met due to the large number of samples.
The Y-chromosome results obtained from our ancient
sample are consistent with earlier studies [6,43]. The
specificity of the male lineages was confirmed by statistical analyses (MDS plot, MJ network) and by individual
comparison of the Y-STR haplotypes with the literature
data since only three haplotypes were shared with other
populations. The high frequency of the haplogroup N1c,
which is present from the most ancient graves, and the
non-significant Fst values between ancient and present
day Yakuts, indicates their stability through time. Thus,
this genetic result corroborates the assumption that the
Yakuts are a highly homogenous population not only
geographically [6] but also from a chronological
standpoint.
The origin of the most frequent Y-chromosomal haplotypes (Ht1 and Ht2) was difficult to establish on the
basis of genetic information. Indeed, these two lineages
belonging to haplogroup N1c seem to be restricted to
Yakut populations, and were probably present since the
period they were first located in Central Yakutia. Interestingly, the comparison with archaeological data
revealed that the male individuals (YAKa34, 39, 40, 69,
78) at the beginning of the 18 th century, identified as
Clan Chiefs (or tojons) on the basis of their grave goods
(weapons, jewelry, silk clothes, richly ornamented saddles and signet rings), belonged to these two haplotypes.
Therefore, archaeological data could bring interesting
information in tracing back the origin of these enigmatic
male lineages. Indeed, the grave goods of the 15th/17th
centuries (weapons and horse harnesses) and the construction of coffins with an empty trunk from the 18th

century are similar to the burial customs of the Cis-Baïkal area [44] and of the Egyin Gol Necropolis during the
3 rd century BC [45-47]. This suggests that the male
ancestors of the Yakuts were probably formed of a small
group of horse-riders originating from Northern Mongolia or the Baïkal Lake. Later, the patrilineal clan organization of the Yakuts would have facilitated the
diffusion of male lineages borne by the individuals of
high social rank. This hypothesis is supported by the
fact that the Y-chromosomal haplotypes identified by
the warriors of the 15th/17th centuries were transmitted
to the tojons of the 18th century. After Russian colonization, the influence of the tojons was strengthened by the
decrees made by the Empress Anna Ivanovna [1], and
this official reinforcement of their power might have
increased the spread of a limited number of Y-chromosomal lineages for a second time. Therefore, the early
founder effect combined with the Yakutian traditions
and the Russian influence would have led to the present
day genetic pattern observed for the paternal lineages.
Conversely, the results obtained from the mtDNA
analyses revealed a more important diversity and varying
origins of the maternal lineages. Indeed, the gene diversity observed in our ancient sample is intermediate compared with the diversity found in small and isolated
Siberian groups such as the Chukchi and Mongolian
[15,48], Buryatian [4] or Central Asian [23] populations.
The haplogroup distribution observed in our sample
matched that found in present day Yakuts and is constituted by distant haplogroups found in Siberian, Mongolian and Central Asian populations. The major
haplogroup, C4, indicates more specific affinities with
the Evenks [21]. Nevertheless, the individual comparison
of maternal lineages with data from literature allowed us
to precise that four out of the six lineages belonging to
the C4 haplogroup were present in the Buryat population. Therefore, the Buryat origin of some of the D5
sub-haplogroups found in the Yakuts as demonstrated
by Pakendorf et al. [6] could be expanded to the C4
haplogroup.
The influence of both Buryat and Evenk populations is
clearly visible in the mtDNA lineages of the ancient
Yakuts. Concerning the contribution of the Evenks to
the Yakut’s mtDNA gene pool, the admixture might
have mostly occurred between Yakut men and Evenk
women (as assumed by Pakendorf et al. [6]) according
to the high frequency of the C4 haplogroup in these two
groups, and since the Y-chromosomal lineages are
highly specific to the Yakuts and the genetic diversity
indices are lower for Y chromosome than for mtDNA.
Moreover, the number of first settlers who arrived in
Central Yakutia was certainly limited and the patrilocal
exogamy practiced by the traditional Yakut society [49]
corroborates the inclusion of autochthonous women.

Page 10 of 16

This assumption is further confirmed by linguistic data
that reveals intermarriages between the Yakuts and
Evenks [50].
Finally, the stability through time demonstrated by the
Y chromosome is also observed in the maternal lineages.
Indeed, most of the sequences present in our ancient
sample (83%) have been transmitted to the present day
population. However, this could signal a small loss in
variation over the two last centuries, which could be
associated with stochastic processes linked to demographic changes undergone by the Yakut population
(plague, smallpox) or other phenomena [51-53]. Besides,
the Yakuts from all chronological periods are grouped
together in the MDS plot and the Fst calculation
revealed the absence of significant distances between
them. Thus, even if the Russian colonization had an
important impact on the expansion of the Yakuts
throughout Yakutia [1], its genetic influence appears to
be relatively low.
Based on the analyses of the maternal and paternal
lineages of ancient Yakuts, we were able to demonstrate
that the formation of this population started before the
15th century, with a small group of settlers composed of
horse-riders from the Cis-Baïkal region and a small
number of women from different South Siberian origins.
These assumptions are in agreement with archaeological
data [54,55], the founder effect dates calculated by
Pakendorf et al. [6] and with the recent coalescent simulations of Yakut mtDNA variation by Zlojutro et al. [56].
The early expansion of the Yakuts was accompanied by
intermarriages between Yakut men and Evenk women
as evidenced by the migration rates. Our data also suggest that the genetic characteristics of the Yakuts were
already well established in the Central Yakutian population during the 15th century and have remained stable
until the present day.

Conclusion
There are few regions in the world where the microevolution of a population over several centuries, based on
Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA analyses, can
be understood. It is the case, however, in Siberia, notably in Yakutia, where frozen bodies facilitate the exceptional preservation of biological samples. In this article
we compared 65 individuals from Central Yakutia: 58
frozen bodies from the 15 th to the late 18 th century
which were excavated over three years, and seven bodies
of a later period from more ancient excavations, with
166 individuals from a well-defined contemporary
population.
Data authenticity from the frozen bodies was determined by the concordance of morphological and molecular typing for sex determination, reproducible PCR
results from multiple extractions, and the amplification

Crubézy et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/25

and analysis of autosomal STR markers based on their
ability to detect degraded and/or contaminated DNA. If
the time from excavation and post-excavation storage
conditions were less favourable for DNA preservation,
age at death also plays a role, as it is more difficult to
obtain profiles from newborn compared to adult bones.
We were able to demonstrate that the Yakutian population formed before the 15 th century, from a small
group of settlers from the Cis-Baïkal region and a small
number of women from different South Siberian origins.
The genetic characteristics of the Yakuts were well
established in the Central Yakutian population during
the 15 th century, even if there was a small loss in
genetic variation during the last two centuries associated
with stochastic processes or other phenomena.

in Yakutia) to 1689 when the trading post of Nertchinsk
between Yakutia and China was created, influencing the
traditional Yakutian culture to include many Chinese
and/or Mongolian traditions; the second period spans
from 1689 to 1728, representing the golden age of
Yakutia with Mongolian influences; the third period
spans from 1728 to the late 18 th century, a cultural
decline since a new trading post in Kiakhta partially
excluded Yakutia from the travel roads; and the latest
period begins from the 19th century (Christianization).
The location of the graves, the dating and the type of
substrates collected are presented in Additional file 5.
Finally, we also analyzed seven samples; six from protohistoric times and one from the 15th century, coming
from ancient excavations in Yakutia and deposited in
museums and other institutions 3-15 years ago.

Methods
Ancient material

Present day samples

The 58 ancient individuals originating from Central
Yakutia were excavated over three years in three different districts (ulus) (Figure 1). In these areas the winter
temperature is less than -40°C for three months and in
summer (July and August) the permafrost is located
between 30-165 cm under the surface according to our
observations, depending on the orientation and the presence/absence of trees which block the sunlight in summer. The graves and the associated artifacts were intact
or well preserved (especially wood) and were dated by
dendrochronology [57]. The preservation state of the
bodies varied from well preserved skeleton remains to
naturally mummified bodies, depending on the depth of
the graves and/or the presence of overhanging trees.
The excavations took place in July and August when
the temperature of the graves varied between 1-2°C,
and several graves were still frozen upon opening (Figure 2). Sampling took place a few minutes after the
graves were opened by a specialist, and some of them
were doubled at the autopsy or at the excavation. Bone
samples (e.g. long bone fragments and/or patella for
adults, full long bones for children) were collected from
all the subjects (except for YAKa83 in order to preserve
the body). Teeth free from cracks or carious lesions and
hairs were collected depending on the availability of
these two substrates. The dating of the graves was
inferred by archaeologists taking into consideration the
dendrochronological analyses made on the wood of the
graves, radiocarbon 14C dating in cases of bad preservation of the wood, and archaeological features such as
the artifacts associated with the body; the type of the
coffin and the construction of the grave. The samples
were distributed across five periods archaeologically
dated according to changes in the funerary ritual and
the grave artifacts found: the first period spans from the
15th century (the most ancient Yakut graves discovered

Buccal swabs were taken from 166 volunteers from different regions of Central Yakutia. Informed consent was
obtained. The sampling was carefully planned in order
to avoid any familial relationship between the donors,
the birthplaces of the donors’ parents and grandparents
were recorded. Autosomal and Y-chromosomal STRs
were analyzed employing the same methodologies as for
the ancient samples. MtDNA sequencing was conducted
at the Institute of Legal Medicine at the Innsbruck Medical University, Austria. All experiments were performed
according to EMPOP standard procedures in sequencing
and validation in order to ensure a high sequence quality and reliable base calling (full control region [CR]
analysis, double amplification of the CR in two separate
reactions using different DNA polymerases, sequencing
of both strands of the template molecule, minimum
double sequencing coverage, automated data transfer,
double inspection of data by two independent scientists
and final validation by a third) [58]. According to their
SNP pattern, samples were assigned to the most terminal haplogroups possible [89]. Data are presented in
Additional file 6. On publication, mtDNA sequences will
be included in the EMPOP mtDNA database http://
www.empop.org.
DNA extraction and amplification

The outer surface of the bones was abraded to a depth
of 2-4 mm using a sanding machine (Dremel, Breda,
Netherlands). The decontamination of the teeth was
performed as follows: the sample was soaked in deionized and decontaminated water, followed by a brief
cleaning with a DNase solution (DNA away MSDS,
Molecular Bioproducts, San Diego, USA). The sample
was then rinsed in deionized water, soaked in absolute
ethanol and finally irradiated under UV light for ten
minutes. Bone powder was generated using a column

Crubézy et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:25

drill and a surgical trepan for long bones. Small pieces
of bones and teeth were ground in liquid nitrogen using
a Spex 6800 freezer-mill (Metuchen, USA). DNA was
extracted from two grams of bone or tooth powder
according to the method described by Keyser-Tracqui
and Ludes [59]. This protocol includes the overnight
incubation at 50°C in a demineralization/lysis buffer, the
phenol-chloroform extraction, the purification of the
DNA on silica-filter columns (Cleanmix kit, Talent,
Trieste, Italy) and finally the concentration of the samples with Microcon® YM30 (Millipore, Billerica, USA).
DNA was extracted from hair shafts according to the
protocol described by Amory et al. [60].
Real time PCR quantification

Nuclear DNA quantification was performed on an ABI
Prism 7000 SDS (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf,
France) using the Quantifiler® Human DNA Quantification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In addition to the
quantification of the nuclear DNA, the presence of PCR
inhibitors was determined by the co-amplification of an
Internal PCR Control included in each reaction.
Y-chromosomal STRs and SNPs amplification and analysis

Two commercial kits were used for Y-chromosomal
STRs amplification. The PowerPlex®-Y System (Promega,
Madison, USA) which includes 11 STR loci and the
AmpF lSTR® Y-Filer™ kit with 17 loci (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The PCR amplifications were
performed on a T3 Biometra thermocycler (Whatman
Biometra, Goettingen, Germany) using the conditions
recommended by the manufacturer. Capillary electrophoresis was run on an ABI Prism 3100 system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and data analysis performed with the Genemapper software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
Since the assignment to haplogroups is not possible
on the basis of the STR data only, we analyzed 13 Ychromosomal SNPs characterizing Asian and Amerindian populations (See result in Additional File 7). These
SNPs were amplified and analyzed according to the protocol developed by Bouakaze et al. [61].
The STR haplotypes obtained were individually compared to the YHRD database and to Y-STR data from
literature. Molecular diversity indices and Fst genetic
distances were calculated for Y-chromosomal STRs data
using the ARLEQUIN v2.001 software [62]. Only the
nine markers of the “minimum haplotype” (DYS19,
DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392,
DYS393, DYS385a/b) were used as most of the data
available for comparison do not include all the markers
amplified in our study. A Multi Dimensional Scale
(MDS) analysis based on pairwise Fst distances was

Page 12 of 16

computed with the software SPSS v13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) (references included in Figure 3). Finally, we
constructed a Median Joining (MJ) network based on
STR haplotypes belonging to the N1c haplogroup (previously known as N3, [63]) from various Siberian populations (references included in Figure 4). The MJ
network computations were realized with Network
4.2.0.1 http://www.fluxus-engineering.com/. The different loci were weighted considering the mutation rates
published by Kayser et al. [11].
MtDNA amplification and analysis

A 421 base pair sequence of the HVS-1 region (from the
position 15989 to 16410 of the Cambridge Reference
Sequence [64]) was amplified in two overlapping fragments as described by Keyser-Tracqui et al. [47]. The
cycle sequencing reaction was performed with the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The products were
detected on an ABI Prism 3100 automatic sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and analyzed
with the Sequence Navigator Software package (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The haplotypes were
assigned to the different haplogroups using the “near
matching” method [26] based on the patterns of shared
haplogroup-specific or haplogroup-associated polymorphisms of the HVS-1 region. Through this strategy
the potential haplogroup status can then be inferred
through a motif search and (near-) matching with the
sequences used for comparative analysis selected from
our database (in the local database of the Institute of
Legal Medicine of Strasbourg including 24155 Asian
HV1 sequences) and for which (i) haplogroup status has
been confirmed with coding-region information in most
cases and/or (ii) the full HVS-I haplogroup motif is
represented. This allows us to link combinations of
HVS-I mutations with certain mutations in the coding
region or with sequences harbouring a full HVS-I haplogroup motif and anticipate the haplogroup status of
our samples. The potential and utility of the nearmatching method has previously been described (e.g.
[26]).
The ARLEQUIN software v2.001 [62] was used to calculate genetic diversity and pairwise Fst distances
between our ancient sample and 14 populations from
Siberia and Central Asia (references included in Figure
5). Pairwise Fst genetic distances were plotted in a MDS
graph using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).
Finally, migration rates between our ancient Yakut sample and Buryat [4], Evenk [6,65], Mongol [48] and
Tuvan [3,6] populations were inferred with MIGRATE
[66,67] using coalescence theory. For each population,
sequences were selected from different data sets to
obtain a sample comprising of approximately 100

Crubézy et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/25

individuals, in order to limit the bias linked to heterogeneous sample sizes. The parameters were set as recommended by Brandstätter et al. [68] (i.e. ten short and
two long chains were run, each with a short sampling
increment of 20, the number of discarded trees per
chain ["burn-in"] was set to 10,000, the search was run
with four chains at different temperatures (1.0, 1.2, 1.5,
and 3.0) with an “adaptive heating” scheme).
Measures against contaminations and validation of the
data

Bearing in mind the critical issues of pre-laboratory contaminations encountered in ancient DNA studies [69],
all the excavations were performed with extensive precautions using face masks and latex gloves. Bones, teeth
and hairs were collected by a trained scientist. Samples
were stored for a short period in sealed plastic bags
under the appropriate conditions before being transferred to the laboratory, where they were stored at -20°
C until analysis. Moreover, the samples underwent no
prior treatments before laboratory analyses, to avoid
possible contamination and to prevent deleterious
effects on the DNA [31]. A comparison was done
between morphological and molecular sex typing
methods.
In addition to the Y chromosome and mtDNA, autosomal STRs were analyzed due to their high discrimination power, and results were systematically compared
with the profiles of the archaeologists involved in the
excavations and the two scientists leading the DNA
extractions. DNA profiles of each ancient specimen are
given in Additional file 4. Indeed, this comparison of
the results obtained for the ancient samples and the
genotypes of the researchers is considered as a key for
the validation of data [47,69,70]. The precautions concerning the facilities, the laboratory equipment and the
reagents were thoroughly respected (laboratory dedicated to ancient DNA only, strict separation of pre- and
post-PCR areas, UV irradiation of the rooms and the
laboratory equipment between each experiment, multiple DNA extractions and PCR amplifications, systematic
use of negative controls, etc.). The comparison of the
results obtained from different substrates for the same
individual was used in this study as an additional validation step. The DNA extractions, separated in time, from
different types of tissue, reinforce the possibility to identify potential contaminations in one of the DNA extracts
since it is unlikely that a contaminant would spread to
all of them. Moreover, the comparison of the results
obtained from these different extracts is extremely useful to highlight allelic dropouts, spurious alleles or point
heteroplasmies.
A posteriori data quality control was performed
applying the NETWORK software that is freely

Page 13 of 16

available from the EMPOP website http://www.empop.
org. By filtering speedy or even all known mutations
from a dataset, this program is able to pinpoint potential errors in a data set among the remaining mutations (e.g. caused by mistakes in transcription, artificial
recombination, phantom mutations). All these mutations in the Yakuts dataset were carefully inspected
and verified. The parameters for this analysis were set
as recommended by [71]. An independent laboratory
repeated mtDNA analyses for three of the samples and
found the same results as we did [72].
First presence of the Yakutian ancestors and
demographic data

Our surveys and excavations focused specifically on
ancient graves. At the same time, we developed a
research program to estimate the number of Yakut people in the middle of the 17th century according to the
tax collectable in pelt imposed by Russians (Ϊassak). The
number which seems the most probable is approximately 40,000 including children (Gogolev, personal
communication). We postulated that this number results
from a demographic expansion and we tried to reconstruct its origin by a simulation using logistic regression
[73] with a growth coefficient/year of between 0.6% to
3%. The first percentage is typical for animal-breeding
farmers in new territories, for example it was 1% for the
Vikings when they arrived in Iceland in the 9th century
[9]; the last seems too high on the long term but not
impossible over a short period [74].
