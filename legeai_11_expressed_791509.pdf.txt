Abstract
Background: Nocturnal insects such as moths are ideal models to study the molecular bases of olfaction that they
use, among examples, for the detection of mating partners and host plants. Knowing how an odour generates a
neuronal signal in insect antennae is crucial for understanding the physiological bases of olfaction, and also could
lead to the identification of original targets for the development of olfactory-based control strategies against
herbivorous moth pests. Here, we describe an Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) project to characterize the antennal
transcriptome of the noctuid pest model, Spodoptera littoralis, and to identify candidate genes involved in odour/
pheromone detection.
Results: By targeting cDNAs from male antennae, we biased gene discovery towards genes potentially involved in
male olfaction, including pheromone reception. A total of 20760 ESTs were obtained from a normalized library and
were assembled in 9033 unigenes. 6530 were annotated based on BLAST analyses and gene prediction software
identified 6738 ORFs. The unigenes were compared to the Bombyx mori proteome and to ESTs derived from
Lepidoptera transcriptome projects. We identified a large number of candidate genes involved in odour and
pheromone detection and turnover, including 31 candidate chemosensory receptor genes, but also genes
potentially involved in olfactory modulation.
Conclusions: Our project has generated a large collection of antennal transcripts from a Lepidoptera. The
normalization process, allowing enrichment in low abundant genes, proved to be particularly relevant to identify
chemosensory receptors in a species for which no genomic data are available. Our results also suggest that
olfactory modulation can take place at the level of the antennae itself. These EST resources will be invaluable for
exploring the mechanisms of olfaction and pheromone detection in S. littoralis, and for ultimately identifying
original targets to fight against moth herbivorous pests.

Background
Olfaction serves to detect environmental chemical information. Nocturnal insects such as moths appear as ideal
models to study the physiology of olfaction, since this
sensory modality is essential for their survival and thus

highly developed. In particular, the moth pheromone
detection system is extremely sensitive: a male can smell
and locate a female miles away for mating [1]. It has
been for long an established model to study the molecular bases of olfaction [2]. In addition, moths include
diverse and important pests of crops, forests and stored
products. Olfaction underlies several behaviours critical
for crop aggression, including sex pheromone-mediated
reproduction, host selection and oviposition [3]. It is

thus an attractive target for pest control. For example,
several olfactory-based strategies have been developed to
control moth populations, such as mass trapping and
mating disruption [4]. Better knowledge on the molecular mechanisms by which an odour generates a neuronal
signal could lead to the identification of targets for the
development of new safe control strategies.
The olfactory signals are detected by the antennae, the
peripheral olfactory organs, where they are transformed
in an electrical signal that will be further integrated in
the central nervous system. Located on the head, the
antennae carry thousands of innervated olfactory structures, the sensilla, which house the olfactory receptor
neurons. Within these sensilla, odour recognition relies
on the expression of a diversity of olfactory genes
involved in different steps (reviewed in [5]). First, volatile odours are bound by odorant-binding proteins
(OBPs) in order to cross the aqueous sensillum lymph
that embeds the olfactory neuron dendrites. The OBP
family notably includes two sub-families: the pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs), thought to transport
pheromone molecules, and the general odorant-binding
proteins (GOBPs), thought to transport general odorants
such as plant volatiles [6,7]. Many other soluble secreted
proteins are also found in abundance within the sensillum lymph, examples are the so-called chemosensory
proteins (CSPs), the antennal binding proteins X
(ABPX) and the sensory appendage proteins (SAPs) [8],
but their role in olfaction remains elusive. After crossing
the lymph, odorant molecules interact with olfactory
receptors (ORs, called pheromone receptors or PRs
when ligands are pheromones) located in the dendritic
membrane of receptor neurons (reviewed in [9]). The
chemical signal is then transformed into an electric signal that will be transmitted to the brain. Sensory neuron
membrane proteins (SNMPs), located in the dendritic
membrane of pheromone sensitive neurons [7,10], are
thought to trigger ligand delivery to the receptor [11].
Signal termination may then be ensured by specific
enzymes, the odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs, called
pheromone-degrading enzymes or PDEs when substrates
consist of pheromones) (reviewed in [7]). Although we
still lack a consensus on the exact function of each protein family, the occurrence of a large diversity within
these families suggests they participate in the specificity
of odour recognition [2]. The combinatorial expression
of these proteins within a sensillum may ensure the specificity and the sensitivity of the olfactory reception,
defining the functional phenotypes of olfactory receptor
neurons.
Complete or partial repertoires of putative olfactory
genes have been established in insect species with an
available sequenced genome. In other species for which
no genomic data are yet available, such as crop pest

moths, we still lack a global view of the olfactory genes.
Homology-based cloning strategies led to the identification of conserved genes, such as OBPs [12], but failed to
reliably identify divergent genes, in particular ORs.
Insect ORs constitute an atypical family of seven transmembrane domain receptors exhibiting a pronounced
intra - as well as inter-specific sequence diversity. As a
result, OR repertoires have been established using the
complete or partial genome databases of, among examples, the dipterans Drosophila melanogaster [13-15] and
Anopheles gambiae [16], the hymenopterans Apis mellifera [17] and Nasonia vitripennis [18], the coleopteran
Tribolium castaneum [19] and the lepidopteran B. mori
[20,21]. In other Lepidoptera, only few ORs and PRs
have been identified to date [22-27]. Among them, one
atypical subtype of ORs, defining the so-called D. melanogaster OR83b orthologue family, is required for the
functionality of the other ORs [28,29]. This subtype is
highly conserved among insects and orthologues have
been identified in numerous species, including a variety
of moths [30,31]. The identification of additional moth
ORs and PRs is thus challenging. This will provide
information on the evolution and diversification of this
receptor family in this biodiverse group of insects and,
in a context of plant protection, ORs appear as good
targets for the design of molecules capable to interfere
with the ligand and thus the receptor response and the
associated insect behaviour.
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequencing strategies
are efficient in identifying a large number of genes
expressed in a particular tissue, thus providing information on the physiological properties of this specific tissue. Such approaches are particularly relevant when no
genomic data are available for the target species. EST
collections are now established for various tissues in
several Lepidoptera species, especially in B. mori, the
only Lepidoptera for which the genome has been
sequenced [32]. However, only two EST strategies have
been previously engaged on antennae. In 1999, Robertson et al [33] sequenced 300 ESTs from Manduca sexta
antennae and identified a variety of candidate OBPs, but
no ORs. In 2008, Jordan et al [34] sequenced 5739 ESTs
from the antennae of the tortricid, Epiphyas postvittana,
whose analysis revealed members of families implicated
in odorant and pheromone binding (PBPs, GOBPs,
ABPXs, CSPs) and turnover (putative ODEs). Only three
genes encoding putative ORs were found, including one
encoding an orthologue of the non-canonical odorant
receptor OR83b from Drosophila.
In view of these difficulties in identifying ORs, we
combined high-throughput sequencing and normalization of a cDNA library, prepared from the antennae of
the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis. This polyphagous noctuid species is one of the major pests of cotton,

and much is known about its olfaction, thanks to previous behavioural and electrophysiological investigations:
the sex pheromone, plant volatiles activating olfactory
neurons, and various functional types of olfactory sensilla have been characterized [35]. S. littoralis thus
appears particularly well-suited to establish the molecular bases of olfactory and pheromone reception in a
crop pest from the noctuid family, which groups some
of the most aggressive herbivorous pests.
In this paper, we report the analysis and annotation of
20760 ESTs obtained from S. littoralis male antennae.
First, this allowed us to establish the use of transcriptome sequencing to identify putative olfactory genes,
and among them chemosensory receptor-encoding
genes. We report on the identification of 31 candidate
olfactory/gustatory receptor genes in a species for which
no genomic data are available. Second, we provide evidence that the antennae express different non olfactory
genes possibly involved in processes such as defense,
plasticity and circadian rhythms. These EST resources
will be invaluable for exploring the mechanism of olfaction and pheromone detection, but also other antennal
processes, in a pest model species.

Results and discussion
EST statistics and unigene prediction

A total of 20760 ESTs (mean length: 958.1 bp, median
length: 820 bp, max length: 1525 bp, min length: 40 bp,
table 1) were obtained from male antennae of S. littoralis. A first batch of 2211 sequences, obtained by
Genome-express (Grenoble, France), has been deposited
in the GenBank database [GenBank:GW824594GW826804]. A second batch of 18549 ESTs, sequenced
by the Genoscope (Evry, France), has been deposited in
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)
[EMBL:FQ014236-FQ032656,] and GenBank [GenBank:
HO118288-HO118415]. Full description of all ESTs is
available in additional file 1. The ESTs were processed
and assembled. 14385 ESTs (69.3%, mean length: 929.5
bp, median length: 804 bp) were assembled into 2705

contigs, 6328 sequences corresponded to singletons and
47 were removed due to vector contamination. The contigs have been submitted to INSDC into the TSA division [EZ980986-EZ983690]. All together, singletons and
contigs were merged into a set of 9033 unigenes that
putatively represent different transcripts (mean length:
1095.2 bp, median length: 1198 bp, max length: 3609
bp, min length: 40 bp, table 1). Full description of the
unigenes is available in additional file 2. On average,
each contig was assembled from 5.32 ESTs. 6328
(~70%) of the unigenes were singletons, 899 (33.23%) of
contig sequences had two ESTs, 481 (17.78%) had three
ESTs, and 275 (10.20%) had more than 10 ESTs. It has
to be pointed out that we did only 5’ end sequencing
that, together with splice variants, polymorphism or
reverse transcriptase errors, may have led to underassembly and thus over-estimation of unigene counts.
Examples of such under-assembly, revealed by manual
OBP and OR analyses, are discussed later.
Identification of putative ORFs

Among the 9033 unigenes, 6738 presented a coding
region (74.6%, mean length: 215.14 aa, median length:
221 aa, max length: 922 aa, min length: 30 aa, table 1).
Protein sequences translated from the predicted open
reading frame (ORF) set were compared to the nonredundant protein database (NR) and to the D. melanogaster and B. mori complete proteomes (e-value cut off:
1e-5) (Figure 1). Most of the sequences (90%) translated
from predicted ORFs, showed similarity to known proteins. 678 ORFs presented no similarity at all. The 972
protein sequences having no similarity with the B. mori
proteome were further compared to the B. mori genome
using TBLASTX (e-value cut off: 1e-20), since the
B. mori protein prediction available in SilkDB may have
missed some genes. 713 remaining S. littoralis protein
sequences had no similarity with any B. mori gene.
50 were classified in a gene ontology term and were
analyzed using BLAST2GO (Additional file 3). Interestingly, we found enrichment in putative proteins involved

Specificity analysis using ESTs

The unigenes were compared to all published ESTs
from other Lepidoptera retrieved from NCBI’s dbEST
(550 623 entries, June 2009) using BLASTN (Figure 2).
3831 sequences (42.4%) gave no similarity to any other
ESTs (e-value cut off: 1e-10). The size of these
sequences (mean size: 1041.7 bp) is significantly shorter
(t-test, t = 354.283, df = 10402, p value < 2.2e-16) than
the size of the 5202 sequences matching with other lepidopteran ESTs (mean size = 1134.7 bp). 1448 (37.8%) of
the 3831 sequences without EST match had no predicted ORF, which is also significantly higher than the
847 (16.3%) observed in the set of 5202 sequences with
an EST match (Chi2, X-squared = 537.7, df = 1, p-value
< 2.2e-16) (Figure 2). The assigned 1448 ORFs, which
have no match in other EST libraries, correspond to
genes that were never isolated from transcriptomic
approaches before and likely represent antennal specific
transcripts. The 849 ORFs without EST match but with
a gene ontology (GO) classification were compared to
the 2766 ORFs with at least one EST match and a GO

classification (Additional file 5). This comparison should
reflect gene enrichment in the antennal transcriptome.
Interestingly, the set showed enrichment in odorant
binding, olfactory receptor activity, sensory perception
of smell and G-protein coupled receptor signalling pathway, in correlation with the sensory function of this
organ.
Gene identification and functional annotation

Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of the S. littoralis
unigene set in GO terms, compared to the distribution
of all B. mori genes having GO terms (retrieved from
http://www.silkdb.org/cgi-bin/silkgo/index.pl). Among
the 6738 S. littoralis ORFs, 3619 corresponded to at
least one GO term. 3072 were assigned to a molecular
function (45.6%), 2586 to putative biological processes
(38.4%), and 2282 to a cellular component (33.9%). In
the molecular function category, binding and catalytic
activities were the most abundant and enriched compared to the B. mori genome, in correlation with the

available ESTs (see previous paragraph). In the biological process terms, cellular and metabolic processes were
the most represented, the other terms being more abundant than in the B. mori genome. In the cellular component terms, cell, cell part and organelle were the most
abundant and over represented compared to the B. mori
genome.
Identification of putative enzymes and secretory proteins

Enzymes are supposed to be abundantly expressed in
antennae, as part of the signal termination pathway, but
may also participate in neuron protection by xenobiotic
degradation [38]. A total of 941 S. littoralis ORFs were
classified in enzymatic categories using BLAST2GO. In
addition to this large analysis, we searched the S. littoralis ORF BLASTP results for enzymes expressed in the
antennae, with specific key-words corresponding to
putative ODEs: carboxylesterase (CXE), glutathione

S-transferase and cytochrome P450, which led to the list
of 71 unigenes reported in table 2. We found 18 ORFs
presenting significant similarities with CXEs. Among the
insect putative ODEs, the CXE family is the most studied, and esterase activities were identified in several
species that use acetates in their sex pheromone blends
[38-42]. In a previous search for CXEs expressed in the
antennae of S. littoralis (a species that mainly uses acetates as pheromone components) we were able to identify 19 putative esterases [43], among which two were
specifically expressed in the antennae. Further comparison of these two sets of esterases will complete the
putative CXE repertoire in S. littoralis antennae. Other
enzyme families proposed to participate in olfactory signal turnover include glutathione S-transferases and cytochrome P450, which can modify odorants to produce
odour-inactive compounds [7]. We found 14 and 39
ORFs presenting high similarities with glutathione
S-transferases and cytochrome P450, respectively. Our

(88.8%) have matches with known proteins in the NR
protein database. Among them, candidate binding proteins were found. A complete analysis of candidate
OBPs found in the S. littoralis ESTs is detailed in the

analysis confirms that antennae are a hot-spot for enzymatic activities, as suggested by the previous analysis of
antennal ESTs from E. postvitana [34]. The role of all
these enzymes in olfaction remains to be studied, since
these enzymes could also be involved in other processes,
such as xenobiotic degradation [38].
The olfactory process within the antennae is thought
to be triggered by a large family of proteins, the socalled OBPs, secreted in the sensillum lymph [8]. We
thus found it relevant to search for secretory proteins

Identification of putative S. littoralis odorant-binding
proteins

35 putative S. littoralis OBP (SlitOBP) and 12 putative
CSP (SlitCSP) fragments were first extracted from the
unigenes by scanning the Interproscan result for the
Interpro accession IPR006170, TBLASTN search in NR,
and specific TBLASTN search among the ESTs with the
B. mori OBP [45] and CSP [46] (further defined as
BmorOBP and BmorCSP) complete repertoires as
queries. After a detailed analysis of sequence alignments,
several contigs and/or singletons that were not automatically assembled were considered to encode a same
putative protein (Table 3). In some cases, pairwise alignments revealed a few nucleotide mismatches, which possibly mirror polymorphism or enzyme errors in the
cDNA synthesis process (eg EZ982609/FQ016892). In
other cases, alignments revealed the presence of large
inserts within nucleotide sequences, likely corresponding
to unspliced introns. GT splice donor sites were found
at the beginning of these inserts and their location
appeared to be similar to intron locations described in
B. mori OBP and CSP genes [45,46] (eg EZ981038/
EZ982027 for OBPs; EZ983373/GW825922 for CSPs).
In total, we annotated 17 SlitOBPs (including six ABPs)
and nine SlitCSPs (including one SAP) listed in table 3.
Some SlitOBP/CSP unigenes were incomplete at their 5’
ends and the corresponding proteins missed the signal
peptide (Table 3).
Interestingly, using Interproscan, a new putative OBP
type was found (FQ020630) that presented no sequence
identity with any known insect OBPs (only 27% identity
with its BLASTX best hit D. melanogaster OBP59a, evalue 0.27, unexpected for insect OBPs). The deduced
encoded protein seemed to be complete (with start and
stop codons) but SignalP analyses did not reveal the
occurrence of a signal peptide, suggesting that this protein is not secreted or that we missed its N-terminal
part. This latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that
the amino acid sequence contains only five cysteine residues, one less than usually observed in insect OBPs.
Alternatively, this sequence could encode a protein
belonging to the Takeout or juvenile hormone-binding
protein families, since these protein families also bind

lipophilic molecules. However, alignment with Lepidoptera Takeout or juvenile hormone-binding proteins was
not possible. Further molecular (eg localisation of the
expressing cells) and functional (eg binding properties)
analyses are now needed to definitely annotate this new
protein as an OBP.
Although the best BLASTX hit for two unigenes, the
contig EZ983259 and the singleton FQ014244, consisted
of putative BmorOBPs, they could not be aligned with
insect OBPs and both presented similarity with juvenile
hormone-binding protein and Takeout-like proteins.
Thus, they were not included in the following phylogenetic analyses.
A phylogenetic analysis of OBPs (Figure 4) was carried
out using protein sequences from S. littoralis, B. mori
and other Lepidoptera (accession numbers provided in
additional file 6). In view of these analyses, at least one
lepidopteran orthologue could be found for each putative SlitOBP identified, except for the new type of OBP
identified in this study (FQ020630). In particular, we
were able to annotate three SlitPBPs (EZ982949 =
SlitPBP1; EZ981038 = SlitPBP2; EZ983456 = SlitPBP3)
and two SlitGOBPs (EZ982647 = SlitGOBP1 and
EZ981811 = SlitGOBP2). Since we found one candidate
in each of the three lepidopteran PBP lineages and in
each of the two GOBP lineages, it suggests that we identified the complete repertoire of these OBP families in
S. littoralis. Interestingly, the BLASTX best hit for
EZ981091 was S. frugiperda PBP4, but the phylogenetic
position of the protein translated from this contig
strongly argues that it does not belong to the PBP
family.
Identification of S. littoralis candidate chemosensory
receptors
31 candidate chemosensory receptors were identified in
male antennae

The chemosensory receptor family includes ORs and
gustatory receptors (GRs). In B. mori, the recently available sequenced genome offered the opportunity to identify the almost complete repertoires of ORs [20,21] and
GRs [47] in a lepidopteran species. 41 candidate B. mori
ORs (BmorORs) previously identified [20] were compared to the unigenes using TBLASTN, leading to a
first identification of 25 putative ORs in S. littoralis (SlitORs). Only six BmorORs gave no result when used as
query sequences (BmorOR17, 18, 21, 22, 23 and 43). In
parallel, the Interproscan result was scanned to retrieve
sequences including one or more domains related to
olfactory reception (IPR004117), resulting in the identification of seven putative ORs. Among them, three new
sequences (EZ982994, EZ981047, FQ015038) were not
identified during the precedent analysis using BmorORs.
Additional searches using described insect OR families

Page 8 of 18

(D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, A. mellifera, T. castaneum, Aedes aegypti), as well as some isolated lepidopteran sequences [22-24,26,27] and additional BmorORs
recently identified [21] led to the identification of a total
of 35 candidate chemosensory receptor partial sequences:
33 olfactory receptors (SlitORs) and two gustatory receptors (SlitGRs). These S. littoralis sequences were in turn
employed in searches to find more genes in an iterative
process, which did not lead to the identification of additional candidates.
As for OBPs and CSPs, some ORFs appeared to overlap with a high sequence identity, and sequence alignments were further manually analyzed. We propose that
the following unigenes encode a single protein:
EZ982777/FQ025462 (residual intron in the latter, identified by the presence of intron/exon boundaries),
EZ981960/FQ025873/FQ021134 (incomplete 5’ end for
the singletons and presence of several punctual mutations) and FQ023155/FQ021957. The final number of
candidate chemosensory receptors identified is then 31,
including 29 ORs and two GRs, and the corresponding
unigenes are listed in table 4.
Putative gustatory receptors expressed in adult antennae

The two GR candidates are, to our knowledge, the first
identified in Lepidoptera antennae. It is not surprising
to find candidate GRs since these organs are known to
carry some taste sensilla [48]. Interestingly, one of these
GRs (GW825869) presented similarity with members of
the GR21a family (Table 4). In Drosophila, GR21a forms
a heteromeric receptor in combination with GR63a,
which allows the detection of CO2 [49,50]. Putative CO2
receptors have been described in B. mori [47], one of
which (BmGr2NJ as described by [47]) presented 78%
identity with the partial sequence we obtained in S. littoralis. Since CO2 receptors are quite conserved among
insects [51], this high sequence identity supports the
annotation of this S. littoralis GR as a candidate CO2
receptor. Receptor cells to CO 2 were found on the
antennae of some insect species, such as the honey bee
[52] and Drosophila [53], but up to now, moth receptor
cells for CO2 have been only described on labial palps
[54]. Thus, annotation of this GR as a candidate CO2
receptor awaits further demonstration of CO2 detection
by S. littoralis antennae.
Annotation of the S. littoralis putative ORs

In S. littoralis, 63 glomeruli could be identified in the
antennal lobe [55]. Considering the one receptor-one
glomerulus paradigm [56,57], by which the number of
expected ORs in a given species should correlates with
the number of glomeruli in the antennal lobe, we estimate that the 29 candidate OR genes identified represent half of the S. littoralis OR repertoire. 45% of the
SlitOR amino acid sequences showed low sequence conservation with already known receptor proteins (less

level (from 57 to 85% identity, table 4) with lepidopteran
PRs previously described [21,22,26]. Since lepidopteran
PRs form a relatively well conserved lineages [24], these
unigenes could encode candidate PRs in S. littoralis.
A phylogenetic analysis was conducted with the putative SlitORs and other lepidopteran OR sequences,
including the annotated BmorORs (accession numbers
provided in additional file 6) (Figure 5). At least one
lepidopteran orthologue could be assigned to the majority of the putative SlitORs, only five of them having no
counterpart. Without surprise, the highly conserved SlitOR2 (EZ981047) clustered with other OR2 sequences
(D. melanogaster OR83b orthologues) (Figure 5). In correlation with the BLAST results, the four candidate
SlitPRs clustered in the lepidopteran PR clade, supporting their annotation.
qPCR analysis of S. littoralis chemosensory receptors

Insect chemosensory receptors usually exhibit a specific or enriched expression in chemosensory organs
[13,20,27]. We thus conducted a preliminary study on
a single set of samples and considering a single time
point, using quantitative real-time PCR, to address the
tissue-distribution of the candidate chemosensory
receptors we identified in S. littoralis. Data were
obtained for 26 unigenes (Figure 6A). For the others,
we encountered primer design problems and/or bad
efficiencies. As expected, most of our candidates were
expressed in a tissue-specific manner, being enriched
in chemosensory tissues (antennae and/or proboscis),
thus supporting our annotation. EZ983645 was
expressed in all tissues tested, unexpected for a chemosensory receptor. One of the two GR candidates
expressed in the antennae (FQ016677) appeared to be
also well expressed in the proboscis, supporting its
annotation. Interestingly, two candidate ORs were well
expressed in the proboscis (EZ981646 and EZ982362).
Consistent with this observation, a previous study
demonstrated that the taste organ of the mosquito A.
gambiae does express ORs and exhibited olfactory
responses [58].
Since pheromone receptors are usually male-specific
or male-enriched [22-24,59,60], we next compared SlitOR expression levels between male and female antennae (Figure 6B). Although this preliminary analysis is of
limited value, we found that four unigenes were
enriched in male antennae (EZ981394, EZ982621,
EZ983328 and EZ982777) (Figure 6B). Only two of
them (EZ983328 and EZ982777) corresponded to the
SlitORs annotated as putative PRs after the BLAST and
phylogenetic analyses (see paragraph above). The two
additional putative ORs enriched in male antennae
(EZ981394 and EZ982621) did not present high
sequence identities with other moth PR candidates or
functionally characterized PRs.

Other genes putatively involved in the olfactory process
and its modulation
Ionotropic receptors (IRs), sensory neuron membrane
proteins (SNMPs) and transduction

Recently, the ionotropic receptors (IRs), that constitute a
family of ionotropic glutamate receptor-related proteins,
have been identified as defining a new class of chemosensory receptors in D. melanogaster [61]. The 61
described D. melanogaster IRs were used to search for
homologues in the S. littoralis ESTs by TBLASTN. This
led to the identification of five putative S. littoralis IRs.
However, further studies are needed to annotate these
candidates as IRs or classical glutamate receptors, such
as obtaining the full length sequences for detailed examination of the binding site.
We also identified two unigenes encoding putative
SNMPs, annotated as SNMP1 and SNMP2 in accordance
with their best hit (accession numbers: EZ982816 and
EZ982501, additional files 1 and 2). SNMPs were first
identified in pheromone-sensitive neurons of Lepidoptera
[10,62] and are thought to play a role in pheromone
detection, as demonstrated for the D. melanogaster
SNMP1 homologue [11].
Our EST analyses (see above) revealed that the antennae appeared to be enriched in genes involved in metabotropic activity. Among examples, we annotated unigenes
putatively encoding proteins such as G-proteins and
G-protein related elements, second messenger-related
enzymes and ions channels such as voltage-gated ion
channels, calcium and chloride channels (additional files
1 and 2). Some of these genes have been previously
described in detail, such as a diacylglycerol kinase [63]
and a transient receptor potential channel [64], whose
function in pheromone signal transduction was suspected. However, the way insect ORs transduce the signal
is currently under debate and although a classical metabotropic pathway via G-protein was assumed [65], recent
studies proposed an alternative or complementary ionotropic process [66,67].
Modulation/regulatory process

Unigenes were identified as encoding proteins putatively
involved in modulation/regulatory process, such as hormone receptors (including ecdysone receptors EcR and
USP), juvenile hormone-binding proteins, Takeout-like
proteins and biogenic amine receptors (additional files 1
and 2). Consistent with the present data, we have previously characterized an octopamine/tyramine receptor
expressed in the olfactory sensilla of an other noctuid,
Mamestra brassicae [68]. Biogenic amines act as neurohormones, neuromodulators or neurotransmitters in
most invertebrate species [69], and evidence has been
accumulated over the last decades that such biogenic
amines participate in the modulation of olfactory reception [70,71]. Ecdysone and juvenile hormone are key

female antennae (B). Gene expression levels were determined by real-time PCR and calculated relatively to the expression of the rpL8 control
gene and expressed as the ratio = ESlitCR(ΔCT SlitCR)/ErpL8 (ΔCT rpL8). The Y-axis shows the percentage of expression in each tissue with a total of
100% and the X-axis reports the accession numbers of the candidate olfactory and gustatory receptors. See table 4 for unigene details.

hormones involved in the maturation [72] and the plasticity [73] of the olfactory system.
Among our unigenes, we have also annotated putative
circadian clock components. In addition to the previously described period and cryptochrome genes [74],
we identified in S. littoralis antennae other fragments
homolog to circadian clock encoding genes, such as
timeless and vrille (additional files 1 and 2). These data
support our previous finding that S. littoralis antennae
house a peripheral circadian clock [74].
LepidoDB implementation

Lepido-DB (http://www.inra.fr/lepidodb) is a centralized
bioinformatic resource for the genomics of major lepidopteran pests [75]. This Information System was
designed to store, organize, display and distribute various genomic data and annotations. Beside a BLAST
search and a full text search facilities, the system was
constructed using open source software tools from the
Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) including
a Chado database. All the data, unigenes, ORFs and
their annotation generated in this project have been
included in LepidoDB. As a result, from the project
page http://www.inra.fr/lepidodb/spodoptera_littoralis
one can retrieve the whole sequence set, query with a
keyword and retrieve the corresponding sequences.

Conclusions
The main objective of this study was to identify genes
potentially involved in olfactory signal detection in a
crop pest model, S. littoralis. We annotated a total of
~130 unigenes encoding putative proteins involved in all
the steps of ligand detection (transport, docking, recognition, degradation). In particular, the normalization
process, alongside with the high number of sequenced
ESTs compared to previous antennal libraries, allowed
enriching the EST collection in rare or low abundant
transcripts. This strategy appeared to be particularly
relevant for the identification of new insect chemosensory receptors in a species for which no genomic data
are available. Concerning the pheromone detection process, we identified in this species three PBPs, two
SNMPs, candidates PRs and many CXEs as putative
PDEs, as a prerequisite to further identify which PBP/
PR/SNMP/PDE act in concert to ensure the specificity
of the recognition process within a given functional type
of pheromone-sensitive sensilla. Their respective expression patterns remain to be elucidated to crack the code
of their combinatorial expression.
Our analyses also suggest that the olfactory sensitivity
may be modulated as early as the antennal level, before
signal integration in the brain. Indeed, we annotated a
long list of biogenic amine/hormone targets and circadian elements expressed in the antennae, as a first step

Page 14 of 18

toward understanding olfactory plasticity at the peripheral level.
Moreover, our study revealed that antennae express
abundant defense-related elements involved in xenobiotic and pathogen protection. This observation could be
explained by the fact that antennae, whose morphology
is adapted to let odorant molecules enter the organism,
represent an open space for harmful molecules.
Besides olfaction, insect antennae are involved in different non-olfactory processes, such as taste, balance/
gravity, wind and sound sensing [76-78], and, as recently
demonstrated, sun compass orientation [79]. The availability of an antennal transcriptome is thus a valuable
resource for olfaction and pheromone detection studies,
but also for investigation of the molecular bases of other
antennal functions.

Methods
Insect rearing and male antennae cDNA library
construction

Insects originated from our inbred laboratory strain of
S. littoralis. Insects were reared on semi-artificial diet
[80], under 23°C, 60-70% relative humidity and 16:8
light:dark cycle. Pupae were sexed and males and
females were kept separately. Antennae were collected
from 1-2 day old naïve adult males and stored at -80°C
until we obtained a total number of 12 000 antennae.
Two mg of total RNA were isolated using the TriZol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), quantified in
a spectrophotometer, and the quality verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. A custom normalized EvoQuest™ cDNA library was created by Invitrogen in
the pSPORT 6.1 vector, using 1 mg of total RNA as
starting material, without any amplification. The normalization step (performed by Invitrogen) introduced
in the library construction consisted of a single
stranded antisense DNA target-biotinylated sense RNA
driver hybridization and a capture with streptavidin to
remove target/driver hybrids and un-hybridized drivers,
leftover DNA representing the normalized library. This
led to a 20 fold reduction of abundant genes as measured for b-actin, while maintaining a good average
insert size of 2.1 kb. The normalization procedure was
used to minimize EST redundancy and to enrich the
library for rare and low abundant genes, to allow new
gene discovery.
EST sequencing

The library was plated, and 2400 clones were randomly
picked. Their 5’ ends were sequenced using REV primer
(Genome-express, Grenoble, France). 93% of the clones
(2218) presented an insert, we thus undertook a highthroughput sequencing project (20000 sequences) in
partnership with the Genoscope (Evry, France). The

Legeai et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:86
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/86

plated library was arrayed robotically and bacterial
clones had their plasmid DNA amplified using phi29
polymerase. The plasmids were end-sequenced using
BigDye Termination kits on Applied Biosystems 3730xl
DNA Analysers. Adaptor and vector were localized
using cross_match (http://www.phrap.org/) using default
matrix (1 for a match, -2 penalty for a mismatch), with
mean scores of 6 and 10, respectively. Sequences were
then trimmed following three criteria: vector and adaptor, poly(A) tail or low quality (defined as at least 15
among 20 bp with a phred score below 12). Moreover,
while submitting the unigenes to GenBank, the
sequences were also compared to known vectors using
the vecscreen software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
VecScreen/VecScreen.html). We finally obtained the 5’
end sequences of 20760 ESTs.
Sequence processing, assembly, unigene and peptide
generation

EST assembly was processed using the TGI Clustering
tools (TGICL, http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software) using the default parameters (minimum percent
identity for overlaps: 94, minimum overlap length: 30
bp, maximum length of unmatched overhangs: 30), generating unigenes and singletons. Peptides were extracted
from the unigenes using FrameDP 1.03 [81], with three
training iterations and using Swissprot (398 181 entries,
August 2009) as reference protein database.
Specificity analysis using EST

The unigenes were compared to the 550623 lepidopteran ESTs retrieved from the NCBI Entrez server (July
2009), using BLASTN with an e-value cut-off of 1e-10.
The analysis of the enrichment of the EST library was
performed with the help of the BLAST2GO application
[82] using GOSSIP [83]. In this application, GO terms
are tested for enrichment in a test group when compared to a reference group using Fisher’s exact test with
multiple testing correction. The statistical tests were
achieved with the R t-test and Chi2 methods.
Gene identification and functional annotation

The unigenes were compared to the NCBI non redondant protein database (7686184 entries, July 2009 version), the FlyBase translational database v5.16 [84] (21
647 entries) and 14623 B. mori Glean peptide predictions from SilkDB (April 2008 release, ftp://silkdb.org/
pub/current/Gene/Glean_genes/silkworm_glean_pep.fa.
tar.gz) [85] using BLASTX, with a 1e-5 e-value threshold. The Gene Ontology mapping and distribution were
done with the help of BLAST2GO (GO association
done by a BLAST against the NCBI NR database).
Finally, the functional domain protein profile and

Page 15 of 18

domain were predicted by queries against InterPro using
InterproScan [37], running a batch of analyses (BLASTProDom, Coil, FprintScan, Gene3D, HMMPanther,
HMMPfam, HMMPIR, HMMSmart, HMMTigr, PatternScan, ProfileScan, RNA-BINDING, Seg and Superfamily) on the predicted ORFs. The protein sequences
were searched for the occurrence of a signal peptide
using SignalP 3.0 [44].
Identification of odorant-binding proteins and
chemosensory receptors

The S. littoralis antennal unigenes were searched with
B. mori OBPs, CSPs, chemosensory receptors and all available insect ORs retrieved from Swissprot as queries using
TBLASTN [86]. Additionally, the Interproscan results
were scanned for the Interpro accession IPR006170 (Pheromone/general odorant-binding protein, PBP/GOBP
Molecular Function: odorant binding GO:0005549) and
IPR004117 (Molecular Function: olfactory receptor activity
GO:0004984). S. littoralis putative chemosensory receptor
sequences were in turn employed in searches to find more
genes in an iterative process.
Phylogenetic analyses

We built OBP and OR neighbor-joining trees based on
Lepidoptera data sets. The OBP data set contained the 43
complete amino acid sequences deduced from the genome of B. mori, together with the largest OBP repertoires
characterized within noctuid moths (7 sequences from H.
virescens and 5 from Spodoptera exigua) and outside noctuid moths (13 from M. sexta and 4 from Plutella xylostella) (Accession numbers available in additional file 6).
Signal peptide sequences were removed following predictions of cleavage site location made by SignalP 3.0. The
OR data set contained 58 amino acid sequences from B.
mori (6 sequences were removed from the alignment
because of their short length) and the 21 sequences characterized from H. virescens, completed with subsets of
sequences characterized within noctuids (3 sequences
from Mythimna separata) and outside noctuids (4 from
P. xylostella, 3 from Diaphania indica and 3 from E.
postvittana). Amino acid sequences were aligned using
ClustalW2 [87]. Unrooted trees were constructed by the
neighbour-joining method, with Poisson correction of
distances, as implemented in MEGA4 software [88].
Node support was assessed using a bootstrap procedure
base on 1000 replicates, and nodes supported by a bootstrap value under 70% were collapsed to an horizontal
line when drawing cladograms.
Quantitative real-time PCR

Naïve males and females in the middle of their second
scotophase were used in the following experiments. Male

Legeai et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:86
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/86

antennae, proboscis, legs (mixture of front, middle, and
hind legs), brains, abdomens and female antennae were
collected and stored at -80°C. Total RNAs were extracted
with the RNeasy® MicroKit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
that included a DNase treatment. Single-stranded cDNAs
were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNAs with 200 U of
M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Mountain View,
CA, USA) using buffer and protocol supplied in the
Advantage® RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech). Gene-specific primers for S. littoralis chemosensory receptors and the
endogenous control rpL8 were designed using the Beacon
Designer 4.0 software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), yielding PCR products ranging from 100 to 250 bp (see additional file 7). qPCR mix was prepared in a total volume of
20 μl with 10 μl of Absolute QPCR SYBR Green Mix
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Epsom, UK), 5 μl of diluted
cDNA (or water for the negative control or RNA for controlling for the absence of genomic DNA) and 200 nM of
each primer. qPCRs were performed on S. littoralis
cDNAs using a MJ Opticon Monitor Detection System
(Bio-Rad). The PCR program began with a cycle at 95°C
for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 20 s at 95°C, 15 s at
53 to 62°C (depending on the primer pair) and 20 s at
72°C. To assess the purity of the PCR reactions, a dissociation curve of the amplified product was performed by
gradual heating from 50°C to 95°C at 0.2°C/s. Standard
curves were generated by a five-fold dilution series of a
cDNA pool evaluating primer efficiency E (E = 10(-1/slope)).
All reactions were performed in duplicate. Chemosensory
receptor expression levels were calculated relatively to the
expression of the rpL8 control gene and expressed as the
ratio = ESlitCR(ΔCT SlitCR)/ErpL8 (ΔCT rpL8) [89].
