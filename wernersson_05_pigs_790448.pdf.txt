Abstract
Background: Comparative whole genome analysis of Mammalia can benefit from the addition of
more species. The pig is an obvious choice due to its economic and medical importance as well as
its evolutionary position in the artiodactyls.
Results: We have generated ~3.84 million shotgun sequences (0.66X coverage) from the pig
genome. The data are hereby released (NCBI Trace repository with center name "SDJVP", and
project name "Sino-Danish Pig Genome Project") together with an initial evolutionary analysis.
The non-repetitive fraction of the sequences was aligned to the UCSC human-mouse alignment and
the resulting three-species alignments were annotated using the human genome annotation. Ultraconserved elements and miRNAs were identified. The results show that for each of these types of
orthologous data, pig is much closer to human than mouse is. Purifying selection has been more
efficient in pig compared to human, but not as efficient as in mouse, and pig seems to have an
isochore structure most similar to the structure in human.
Conclusion: The addition of the pig to the set of species sequenced at low coverage adds to the
understanding of selective pressures that have acted on the human genome by bisecting the
evolutionary branch between human and mouse with the mouse branch being approximately 3

times as long as the human branch. Additionally, the joint alignment of the shot-gun sequences to
the human-mouse alignment offers the investigator a rapid way to defining specific regions for
analysis and resequencing.

Background
The domesticated pig (Sus scrofa) is an obvious choice for
genome sequencing, because of its important economic
value for meat production and its relevance to biomedical
research. The evolutionary position of the pig as an artiodactyl, where no other large scale sequencing efforts have
so far been published, makes it valuable for comparative
genomics.
Comparative vertebrate genome analysis – e.g. with the
aim of understanding evolutionary pressures on the
human sequence – is most cost-effective with relatively
low coverage, genome wide sequencing of species at different evolutionary distances [1,2]. The mouse and rat
genomes [3,4] and the chimpanzee genome [5] have
offered sequences, which are evolutionary quite distant
and very close to the human genome sequence, respectively. The evolutionary close chimpanzee sequence can
pinpoint significant recent changes in genes, but is not
efficient for identification of important regions by comparative approaches because many regions are extremely
conserved by chance effects and differences in mutation
rates over the genome. The more distantly related rodent
sequences are useful in the search for conserved regions of
biological importance. However, more species are
needed, and an artiodactyl like pig is an obvious choice
for the following reasons. 1), By comparing rodents and
human, it is not possible to determine whether observable
differences, e.g. difference in isochore structure, are
mainly due to changes in the rodent or primate lineage
since their divergence (approximately 90 million years
ago, see 6); 2) Rodents have only a subset of the biological
functions important to humans. By including pig additional functions will be covered; 3) Even though rodents,
artiodactyls and primates diverged at approximately the
same time [6,7], molecular evolution has been faster in
the rodent branch, thus the pig is expected to be closer in
sequence to human than mouse is. The importance of
these points is generally appreciated and comparative
genomics sequencing initiatives focusing on restricted
regions of the genomes have recently provided much
insight [e.g. [1,2]].
The Chinese-Danish pig sequencing consortium has generated about 3.84 million high quality sequences from 5
pig breeds. The present study releases these data and
reports an initial evolutionary analysis which confirms
that pig and human are closer in sequence space and
quantifies the rates of evolution in the pig, rodent and

Results
Table 1 shows the amount of high quality sequence
obtained from 5 pig breeds (NCBI Trace repository under
center name "SDJVP", and project name "Sino-Danish Pig
Genome Project"). The average trimmed length of the
~3.84 million sequences was 543 base pairs, yielding a
total of 2.1 billion base pairs, equivalent to 0.66X coverage of redundancy of the 3.15 billion base pair pig
genome. It is expected that 1-(1-543/3.15 × 109)^3.84 ×
106 = 48% of the pig genome sequence has been hit at
least once by this sequencing project. The low coverage
prevents making a real assembly of the pig sequences and,
thus, the contig coverage is not estimated. The analyses are
therefore based on a very large number of short alignments. Repeatmasking (supplementary Table 1) masked
36% of all base pairs. The distribution of repeat types is
overall very similar to what is observed in human, except
for the expected absence of Alu-elements (Additional file
1). Overall, 38% of the coding fraction of the humanmouse alignment, 38% of the 5' UTR, 33 % of the 3' UTR,
23% of the intron region and 24% of the intergenic region
could be expanded to a three-species alignment with the
addition of the pig reads. This coverage of the humanmouse alignment by the pig genome sequences was close
to our prior expectation. Since only 48% of the base pairs
in the pig genome are expected to have been hit, we would
only expect to hit at most 48% of the human-mouse alignment, assuming perfect conservation. However, in practice there is some lack of power in BLAST due to the
fragmented nature of the pig shotgun reads (being

fragmented even more by the repeatmasking), and we
expect that some of the human-mouse alignment has no
longer an orthologues region in the pig genome. For the
non-coding regions, the coverage of the human-mouse
alignment by the pig genome sequences is lower than for
the coding regions, but this may be explained by lower
selective constraints and a much higher rate of insertionsdeletions in these regions.
The alignments were used to generate the phylogenetic
trees in Figure 1. As the pig, mouse and human lineages
are believed to have diverged at approximately the same
time, the trees allow for separate studies of evolution on
the human and mouse branches since the divergence of
the two species (the root). Due to a generally lower rate of
nucleotide substitutions in the pig and human lineages,
the porcine sequences are more similar to the human than
to the mouse sequences. Overall, the exonic sequences
show the slowest evolution, followed by 5' UTR, 3'UTR,

intergenic and intronic regions, reflecting different levels
of selective constraint on these domains.
Ultra-conserved sequences
By aligning the set of ultra-conserved regions against the
pig genome reads using BLAST, we were able to find 239
of the 481 known regions reported in Bejerano et al.
(2004) with a significant hit of at least 150 bp. Only 12 of
these regions were less than 98% conserved (85–97%
identity). This result agrees very well with the expected
48% of the pig genome being covered and the assumption
that these regions are very well conserved within
Mammalia.

By aligning the pig shotgun data against all human transcripts (NCBI build 34) we found 758 completely conserved sequences exceeding 200 bp in length. Of these, 41
were also found to be completely conserved in the mouse
genome, while 590 were less conserved (more than 95%

GC content
The intra-genomic variation in GC content among the
individual alignments reflects the isochore structure of the
genome. Thus, from the three species alignments, we calculated the GC content for each functional sequence class
for each aligned fragment. For a given type of sequence,
only alignments having more than 40 nucleotides of the
specific type were used. Table 2 shows that the mean GC
content is similar among the three species. The variance
among alignments in GC content is generally lower in
mouse than in pig and human, but mostly so for coding
sequences, followed by the UTR and intron regions (Table
2). Figure 2 shows the distribution of GC% for the coding
alignments. The reduced variability in GC content in
mouse compared to human has been shown previously,
e.g. Figure 8a in [4]. The results presented here suggest a
very similar pattern in human and pig.

miRNA
The set of pig miRNAs (1) was compared to human and
mouse and it was possible to obtain 50 three-way alignments. The evolutionary tree in Figure 1 was constructed
using the HKY+gamma model from these alignments with
gap positions removed. By construction, the miRNAs are
more conserved than even the protein coding sequences,
but with pig and human being phylogenetically closest.
For the 50 triple-alignments, we obtained 25 cases where
pig is closer to human than to mouse, 2 cases where pig is
closer to mouse than to human, and 23 cases where pig is
equally distant to human and mouse.

transcripts vs. the fully assembled mouse genome (NCBI
build 32), we found 2709 ultra-conserved regions. When
aligning this set of sequences against the artificially fragmented mouse genomic dataset using BLAST it was only
possible to classify 664 (24.5%) as ultra-conserved – less
than the 758 elements found in the human-pig
comparison.

Discussion
Even though divergence between pig and human occurred
approximately at the same time as the divergence between
human and mouse, the pig sequence is much more similar to the human sequence. Thus, the availability of the
pig sequence effectively subdivides the human-mouse
evolutionary branch at a position closest to human. This
implies that one can determine which changes occurred
on the human and mouse branches, respectively, since
their divergence. The results of the phylogenetic analysis

show that the relative length of the mouse, human and pig
branches are different for the different types of data.
Intronic sites and intergenic sites show a similar pattern,
which also closely resembles that of synonymous sites
[see [7]], reflecting that purifying selection is probably
weak and similar for these regions. It is noteworthy that
intergenic branch lengths are slightly shorter than intronic
ones (and both are shorter than synonymous sites, see
[7]). This may reflect either 1) more selective constraints
on intergenic sequences than intronic, i.e. parts of the
annotated intergenic sequences are indeed genic, or 2) a
bias in the construction of the human-mouse alignment
that make it easier to align sequence close to the conserved exons so that somewhat more divergent intronic
sequence can be detected. The differences in evolutionary
rates among the three species are most likely attributable
to differences in generation times since they diverged.
Non-synonymous sites show shorter branches that are
much more similar in lengths among the species [7]. This
reflects purifying selection, which has been strongest in
the mouse lineage, followed by pig and then human
[20,21]. The reason for this may be the larger average
population size in the mouse since divergence. The UTR
regions shows more selective constraint than introns.
The similarity between human and pig adds to the
recently reported ultra-conserved regions [14]. Pig and
human share more ultra-conserved regions than human
and mouse, and (correcting for the coverage in the data
presented) virtually all of the ultra-conserved elements
defined by Bejerano et al. [14] are also found in pig and
therefore most likely in the artiodactyls lineage.
Variation in GC content along the genome (isochore
structure) is more pronounced in primates than in
rodents [4,5]. The present results extend these findings
and put artiodactyls in line with primates – lending further support to the suggestion that isochore evolution in
rodents deviates from all other lineages, possibly because
of extensive genome rearrangements [22].

Conclusion
A 0.66X coverage pig genome survey is hereby released.
Even though it is only a beginning, the data offer many
analytical possibilities and should also stimulate the
international initiatives to generate a complete draft of the
pig genome. The initial analysis of the data adds to our
understanding of the evolutionary relationships of
humans, mice and pigs. Further comparative genomic
studies and more detailed genetic analyses will greatly
improve our ability to elucidate pig as well as human biology and medicine.

Methods
Generation of pig shot-gun sequences
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples from 5
different breeds of Sus scrofa (domestic pig): ErHuaLian,
Duroc, Landrace, Yorkshire and Hampshire. Following
mechanical shearing, DNA fragments (1–3 kb) were isolated by gel electrophoresis and cloned into the SmaI
restriction site of the pUC18 plasmid using blunt-end
ligation. After transformation into E. coli (strain DH5a)
and selection on LB-plates, individual clones were picked
for the library. The quality of a library was checked by
sequencing a small number of plasmids, which were
assembled by phrap and aligned by BLAST to validate the
randomness of the library and the proportion of contaminations – including mitochondrial DNA, human fragments and vector sequences. If the library was eligible,
plasmid DNA was extracted from the individual clones
using the membrane-filter method (Millipore). The pig
genomic inserts were sequenced using the M13 bidirectional sequencing primers on the MegaBACE1000
platform using ET dye terminator. The chromatograms
were registered in a relational database tracking all
generated data to eliminate duplicated work and check for
errors. Using phred v. 0.020425.c with a quality cut-off of
0.05 and the -trim_alt parameter the chromatograms were
traced and the resulting traces were masked for vector
sequences using CROSSMATCH (0.990329). Resulting
sequences were resubmitted to the relational database and
prepared for submission. Following removal of contamination from vector and bacterial host, we retained
3,835,271 reads of at least 150 bp.

All sequences with trace files have been submitted to the
Ensembl/NCBI Trace repository under the center name
"SDJVP", and project name "Sino-Danish Pig Genome
Project".
Repetitive elements
Standard masking of repetitive sequences was performed
using Repeatmasker version 2004/03/06 with RepBase
Update 8.12 with Sus scrofa as query species, using default
settings.
Construction of three species alignments
The newest build of the human-mouse pairwise alignment (hg17/mm5) based on the improved blastZ algoritm [8] was downloaded from the UCSC genome
browser [9] and the repeatmasked shotgun-sequences
were BLAST'ed up against this alignment using Megablast
[10] with the following settings: (w) word size = 12, (e)
minimum e-value = 0.0001, (x) extension parameter = 50,
(u) Repeatmasked query sequences = True. Resulting hits
were then used as tags to build the alignment around (see
below).

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:70

All query sequences with multiple blast hits on different
parts of the human-mouse alignment (approximately
10%) were removed at this point and only the remaining
pig sequences were used in the further analyses. This was
done to conservatively eliminate paralogous hits. The
individual blast hits were used to position the pig query
sequences on a specific part of the human-mouse alignment. For each BLAST hit a region extending 300 base
pairs in both directions was then realigned using DIALIGN version 2.2.1 with default parameters [11]. Regions
that afterwards were not considered by DIALIGN to be
aligned were removed at this point. Subsequently an
annotation file (refGene.txt) of the human genome
(hg17) was downloaded from the UCSC genome server
and used to annotate each position in the alignment
according to the following classes 1) protein-coding exon
(with reading frame position), 2) intron, 3) 5' UTR, 4) 3'
UTR, and 5) intergenic. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on each of these classes separately.
Estimation of phylogenetic trees
A combined alignment for each of the five functional
classes was constructed by concatenating the many small
three species alignments, and gap positions were
removed. For each class of data (exon, 5'UTR, 3'UTR,
intron and intergenic), the implementation of the
HKY85+GAMMA model [12] in PAML v. 3.14 [13] was
used to estimate the number of substitutions in each evolutionary branch.
Analysis of ultra-conserved regions
The data set containing the 481 ultra-conserved regions
defined by Bejerano et al. [14] was downloaded and used
for the first part of this analysis. We estimated how many
of these regions that can be found in the pig genome shotgun sequences by a simple BLAST (blastn) approach
retaining only hits of a length of 150 bp or more. Since
these ultra-conserved regions are based on external data,
artefacts due to the relatively low coverage of the pig
genome sequences are not important here.

In the second part of the analysis (searching for novel
ultra-conserved regions), it was important to address the
artefacts that arise from searching for ultra conserved
regions in a fragmented dataset. In order to do a comparable search for ultra-conserved regions against the mouse
and pig genomes, we artificially created a mouse data set
resembling the fragmented pig shotgun data set. Since the
identification criteria we use is 100% conservation over
200 bp or more, the length of the individual read as well
as the quality become a major factor. The fragmented
mouse data set was generated by downloading all ~79
million reads of the NCBI trace database, shuffle these
randomly, and pick single reads until the same amount of
nucleotides was reached as in the pig genomic reads data-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/70

set. Only pig reads with length > 200 bp were used and the
data set consisted of 2,034,999,640 bp from pig and
2,665,153 reads (2,034,999,649 bp) from mouse.
Construction of the miRNA data set
The reads were BLAST searched [15] (default options)
against the miRNA hairpin database [16] and matches of
at least 60 nucleotides clustered. The obtained set of 219
clusters contained redundancy as the same pig reads hit
the same miRNAs from different species (human, mouse,
etc.). This could be converted into a unique set of 68 clusters (each containing 2–5 reads), i.e. each type of miRNA
is now only represented once. Each cluster was assembled
with Cap3 [17] from TGICL [18]. As a result 84 contigs
and singletons were obtained and BLAST searched back
against the miRNA database. Matches with more than
95% identity in an alignment length larger than 95% of
the miRNA hairpin length were selected. This resulted in
54 hairpins complying with the criteria defined in Ambros
et al. [19]. In total 51 different mature sequences are covered in the 54 hairpins.
