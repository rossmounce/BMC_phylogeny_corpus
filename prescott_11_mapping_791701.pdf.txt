cytoplasmic mechanism

Abstract
Background: The ETS family transcription factor ESE-1 is often overexpressed in human breast cancer. ESE-1
initiates transformation of MCF-12A cells via a non-transcriptional, cytoplasmic process that is mediated by a
unique 40-amino acid serine and aspartic acid rich (SAR) subdomain, whereas, ESE-1’s nuclear transcriptional
property is required to maintain the transformed phenotype of MCF7, ZR-75-1 and T47D breast cancer cells.
Results: To map the minimal functional nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export (NES) signals, we fused inframe putative NLS and NES motifs between GFP and the SAR domain. Using these GFP constructs as reporters of
subcellular localization, we mapped a single NLS to six basic amino acids (242HGKRRR247) in the AT-hook and two
CRM1-dependent NES motifs, one to the pointed domain (NES1: 102LCNCALEELRL112) and another to the DNA
binding domain (DBD), (NES2: 275LWEFIRDILI284). Moreover, analysis of a putative NLS located in the DBD
(316GQKKKNSN323) by a similar GFP-SAR reporter or by internal deletion of the DBD, revealed this sequence to lack
NLS activity. To assess the role of NES2 in regulating ESE-1 subcellular localization and subsequent transformation
potency, we site-specifically mutagenized NES2, within full-length GFP-ESE-1 and GFP-NES2-SAR reporter constructs.
These studies show that site-specific mutation of NES2 completely abrogates ESE-1 transforming activity.
Furthermore, we show that exclusive cytoplasmic targeting of the SAR domain is sufficient to initiate transformation,
and we report that an intact SAR domain is required, since block mutagenesis reveals that an intact SAR domain is
necessary to maintain its full transforming potency. Finally, using a monoclonal antibody targeting the SAR domain,
we demonstrate that the SAR domain contains a region accessible for protein - protein interactions.
Conclusions: These data highlight that ESE-1 contains NLS and NES signals that play a critical role in regulating its
subcellular localization and function, and that an intact SAR domain mediates MEC transformation exclusively in
the cytoplasm, via a novel nontranscriptional mechanism, whereby the SAR motif is accessible for ligand and/or
protein interactions. These findings are significant, since they provide novel molecular insights into the functions of
ETS transcription factors in mammary cell transformation.

Background
The human ETS (E26 Transformation-Specific) protein
family is a diverse group of 27 known transcription factors
that regulate such varied cellular processes as differentiation and apoptosis, but also appear to induce oncogenesis
when mutated or aberrantly expressed [1-4]. In particular,
aberrant ETS protein activity and/or expression has been
implicated in human mammary epithelial cell (MEC)

transformation [5]. The ER81 ETS protein, for example, is
activated in human breast cancer cells by the oncoprotein
HER-2, resulting in over-expression of the prosurvival telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene [6]. In addition, ETS-1 mRNA overexpression appears to be a strong
independent predictor of poor prognosis in primary
human breast cancers [7]. Furthermore, ETS-2 overexpression can inhibit expression of the tumor-suppressor
gene BRCA1, the downregulation of which is clearly linked
to familial breast cancer [7,8].
Overexpression of one ETS protein in particular, the
epithelium-specific ETS factor ESE-1, is implicated in

human mammary transformation. ESE-1 mRNA is overexpressed in primary human ductal carcinomas in situ
(DCIS), and the genomic ESE-1 locus (1q32.1) is commonly amplified in primary human breast cancer cells
[9-11]. In addition, we have shown that ESE-1 expression confers a transformed phenotype to the nontransformed MCF-12A and MCF-10A human MECs,
including enhanced invasiveness and motility, anchorage
independent growth, epidermal growth factor-independent proliferation, and formation of disorganized structures in three-dimensional cultures on matrigel [12-14].
A later study screening a collection cDNAs associated
with breast cancer independently identified ESE-1 as a
factor that promotes motility and induces formation of
disorganized structures on matrigel in MCF-10A cells
[15].
While previous publications have established ESE-1’s
transcription factor function, we have reported that ESE1 initiates transformation of MECs via a novel nonnuclear, non-transcriptional mechanism [13]. We have
shown that a 40-amino acid (AA) serine and aspartic acid
rich (SAR) domain within the ESE-1 is both necessary
and sufficient to mediate ESE-1 transforming function
and that enforced nuclear localization of full-length ESE1 or of the SAR domain alone, abrogates ESE-1 ability to
initiate transformation [13]. These results imply that
ESE-1 contains an endogenous nuclear export signal that
is required for ESE-1-mediated initiation of MEC transformation via a cytoplasmic mechanism. In addition to
transformation initiating function that requires cytoplasmic localization of ESE-1, we have reported that ESE-1 is
required for the maintenance of transformed phenotype
in breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that shRNAmediated downregulation of ESE-1 protein levels in
MCF7 and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines results in
decreased anchorage independent growth, and that
in these cells lines, as well as in T47D, ESE-1 is localized
to the nucleus [16]. Thus, nuclear function of ESE-1 is
required for the maintenance of transformed phenotype.
Together these reports establish that nuclear-cytoplasmic
shuttling of ESE-1 is essential for transformation initiation in benign MECs as well as for the maintenance of
transformed phenotype in breast cancer cells, and imply
that ESE-1 contains both nuclear export (NES) as well as
nuclear localization (NLS) signals.
In the current report we use fusion between green
fluorescent protein (GFP) and specific ESE-1 motifs to
map functional ESE-1 NES and NLS sequences and to
define the role of these motifs in ESE-1 transforming
function. We localize the functional ESE-1 NLS to a six
AA basic motif within the ESE-1 A/T Hook domain and
we demonstrate that, unlike in other ETS proteins
[17-19], in-frame deletion of the ESE-1 DBD does not
abrogate ESE-1 nuclear localization. Using both gain-of-

function and loss-of-function approaches, we identify a
single NES within the ESE-1 DBD that is required for
ESE-1-mediated initiation of MCF-12A cell transformation. Furthermore, we sequentially mutagenize 11-14
AAs blocks in the SAR domain to establish that while
each of the SAR mutants partially retains transformation
function in MCF-12A cells, an intact SAR domain is
required for its full transforming activity. Finally, we
identify ESE-1 region 216-228 within the SAR domain as
the site of interaction with anti-ESE-1 antibody mAB405,
what suggests that this region is surface exposed and
thus likely to mediate protein-protein interactions. In
summary, these data represent a paradigm shift in our
understanding of the specific subcellular functions of
ETS transcription factors, by revealing a novel NES2
and providing insights into SAR domain-dependent cytoplasmic mechanism by which ESE-1 initiates MEC
transformation.

Results
ESE-1 contains a single, basic amino acid-rich NLS that
maps to the A/T hook domain

The nuclear localization signal (NLS) in Elf3, the murine
ortholog of human ESE-1, has been mapped to four basic
residues 244KRKR247 within the AT Hook domain [20],
with additional NLS motifs within the AT hook (AA 236252 and 249-267) and DBD (318KKK320) also contributing
to nuclear localization [21]. We have previously shown
that in-frame deletion of AA 231-268, spanning the AT
hook domain in human ESE-1, resulted in exclusive cytoplasmic localization [13]. To precisely map the functional
NLS motif(s) within human ESE-1 and to assess whether
these motif(s) are the same as in murine Elf3, we designed
a gain-of-function assay, in which each putative NLS was
fused between the GFP and SAR portions of the GFP-SAR
construct [13] and the resulting GFP signals were then
used as reporters of the subcellular localization of each
fusion protein in transiently transfected MCF-12A cells
(Figure 1). We identified one putative SV40-like NLS
(NLS1: 240PKHGKRKR249), and two putative bipartite NLS
sequences (NLS2: 236 KKGDPKHGKRKR247 and NLS3,
251
RKLSKEYWDCLEGKKSKH 268 ) (Figure 1A), which
were also in murine Elf3 [21]. Subsequently, we generated
GFP-NLS1-SAR, GFP-NLS2-SAR, and GFP-NLS3-SAR
fusion constructs, in which each putative NLS was fused
in-frame between GFP and a 189-239 AA fragment of
ESE-1 spanning the SAR domain and 10 AAs just distal to
the SAR domain (Figure 1A &1B). In transiently transfected MCF-12A cells, GFP-SAR protein is distributed to
both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Figure
1C, panel 6) and [13]. In contrast, MCF-12A cells transiently transfected with the NLS fusion constructs demonstrate exclusive nuclear localization of GFP-NLS1-SAR
(Figure 1C, panel 1) and GFP-NLS2-SAR (Figure 1C,

panel 2). Whereas, GFP-NLS3-SAR is diffusely cytoplasmic and nuclear (Figure 1C, panel 3) and is indistinguishable from GFP-SAR protein (Figure 1C, panel 6). Thus,
NLS1 and NLS2, but not NLS3, have intrinsic nuclear
localization function, narrowing ESE-1 nuclear localizing
activity to AA 236-249 (Figure 1A). To further localize
ESE-1 NLS activity, two plasmids with progressive aminoterminal truncations of the ESE-1 NLS region were generated: pEGFP-NLS4-SAR and pEGFP-NLS5-SAR, in which

the ESE-1 sequences 241KHGKRKR247 and 242HGKRKR247
were fused between GFP and SAR, respectively (Figures
1A &1B). Transient expression of both GFP-NLS4-SAR
(Figure 1C, panel 4) and GFP-NLS5-SAR (Figure 1C,
panel 5) demonstrated exclusive nuclear localization in
MCF-12A cells. Taken together, these findings map more
precisely ESE-1 nuclear localizing activity to AA 242-247
and define the ESE-1 NLS as a six amino acid sequence
similar to the SV40 large T antigen NLS (PKKKRKV) [22].

Previous reports have shown that basic AA-rich
sequences in the DBDs of several different ETS proteins, including ETS-1 ( 376 GKRKNKPK 383 ), ELK-1
(47GLRKNKTN54), and ER71 (275GERKRKPG282), mediate the nuclear localization of these proteins [17-19]. In
murine Elf3, internal deletion or site-specific mutation
of the 318 KKK 320 sequence, within the context of the
entire DBD, resulted in the localization to both the
nucleus and the cytoplasm [21]. Considering these data,
we tested whether a similar putative NLS sequence,
316
GQKKKNSN 323 (ESE-1 NLS6) in the ESE-1 DBD
also shows NLS function, using the GFP fusion strategy
described above (Figure 1D). Transient expression of
GFP-NLS6-SAR in MCF-12A cells revealed diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence (Figure 1D) that was
indistinguishable from that of GFP-SAR (Figure 1C,
panel 6) and [13], indicating that ESE-1 NLS6 is insufficient to mediate nuclear localization. To test whether
the ESE-1 NLS6 is necessary to mediate nuclear localization, we generated an additional construct in which
the ESE-1 DBD was deleted in-frame from the previously described pEGFP-ESE-1 expression plasmid,
containing the full-length ESE-1 protein, to generate
pEGFP-ESE-1ΔDBD (Figure 1E). Transient transfection
in MCF-12A cells revealed exclusive nuclear GFP-ESE1ΔDBD localization, thus demonstrating that in the
human ortholog of ESE-1, the DBD is not required for
ESE-1 nuclear localization. Together with the data
shown in Figures 1C & Figure 1D, these findings indicate that, unlike previously examined ETS proteins,
the ETS DBD does not play a role in ESE-1 nuclear
localization.

activate nuclear export by binding directly to the CRM1
nuclear exporter protein [24], we next tested the role of
CRM1 in the nuclear export mediated by each ESE-1
NES motifs. MCF-12A cells transfected with the GFPNES1-SAR or GFP-NES2-SAR constructs were treated
with the CRM1-specific inhibitor leptomycin B [25],
which resulted in the redistribution of GFP-NES1-SAR
(Figure 2C, panels 3 & 4) and GFP-NES2-SAR (Figure
2C, panels 9 & 10), respectively, from the cytoplasm
both to the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.
This leptomycin B-induced inhibition of nuclear export
reveals that both ESE-1 NES motifs function via a
CRM1-dependent mechanism. The four conserved leucine/isoleucine residues characterizing the NES (L/I)X24(L/I)X1-4(L/I)X(L/I) sequence are known to play a crucial role in the function of this motif [26]. Thus, we
next tested the functional importance of the conserved
leucine/isoleucine residues in each ESE-1 NES by engineering two leucine/isoleucine-to-alanine mutations
within the NES sequences of the GFP-NES1-SAR and
GFP-NES2-SAR constructs (Figure 2B). NES1 was
altered from LCNCALEELRL to LCNCAAEEARL
(NES1Mut-SAR), and NES2 was altered from LWEFIRDILI to LWEFARDALI (NES2Mut-SAR). For both NES
mutant plasmids, the GFP signal was diffusely nuclear
and cytoplasmic (Figure 2C, panels 5, 6, 11 & 12),
mimicking the GFP-NES1-SAR and GFP-NES2-SAR
fluorescence patterns observed following leptomycin B
treatment (Figure 2C, panels 3 & 9). These data demonstrate that the nuclear export function of each ESE-1
NES depends on conserved leucine/isoleucine residues
within each of the NES sequences.

ESE-1 contains two separate CRM1-dependent NES motifs

Site-specific mutation of ESE-1 NES2 inhibits GFP-ESE-1induced MCF-12A cell transformation

Having shown that internal deletion of the AT hook
domain containing the functional NLS results in exclusive cytoplasmic localization of ESE-1 [13], we speculated that ESE-1 contains two putative NES signals
corresponding to the consensus sequence (L/I)X2-4(L/I)
X1-4(L/I)X(L/I) [23]: 102 LCNCALEELRL 112 in the
Pointed domain (NES1) and 275LWEFIRDILI284 in the
DBD (NES2) (Figure 2A). To test the function of these
NES motifs, we inserted each sequence in-frame
between the GFP and SAR portions of the GFP-SAR
construct to produce GFP-NES1-SAR and GFP-NES2SAR, respectively (Figure 2B) and we used the GFP
fluorescence as a reporter of subcellular localization.
MCF-12A cells transiently transfected with these constructs demonstrate a predominantly cytoplasmic localization for both the GFP-NES1-SAR and GFP-NES2-SAR
proteins (Figure 2C, panels 1, 2, 7 & 8). Thus, both the
ESE-1 NES1 and NES2 sequences are sufficient to mediate nuclear export. Because NES motifs conforming to
the (L/I)X2-4(L/I)X1-4(L/I)X(L/I) consensus sequence

Having shown that ESE-1 contains two separate, CRM1dependent NES signals (Figure 2), we next sought to
determine their role in the transforming function of fulllength ESE-1 (Figure 3). We have previously reported that
in-frame deletion of the ESE-1 Pointed domain, which
contains NES1 (AA 102-112, Figure 3A), does not impair
GFP-ESE-1-induced MCF-12A cell transformation [13].
Thus, the nuclear export function of NES1 is not required
for the transforming function of GFP-ESE-1, since ESE-1initiated transformation requires cytoplasmic localization,
and inactivation of the critical NES signals should eliminate ESE-1 transforming activity. To test the role of NES2,
we generated the same inactivating NES2 mutations as
described for the GFP-NES2Mut-SAR construct (Figure
2B), but in the context of the full length ESE-1 protein
(Figure 3A). As expected, this GFP-ESE-1 NES2Mut protein is exclusively nuclear in transiently transfected MCF12A cells (Figure 3B). To test the effect of NES2 mutation
on GFP-ESE-1-mediated transformation, we generated

two independent stable MCF-12A transfectant populations
for the GFP-ESE-1 NES2Mut construct, as well as for the
GFP-ESE-1 and GFP-only constructs. In addition, because
both the PEA-3 and ETS-2 ETS factors have been implicated in human breast cancer (although neither contains a
SAR domain) we also fused GFP, in-frame, to the N-terminus of each of these ETS proteins and used these two
fusions to test both their transforming potency and to
control for nonspecific transforming effects of ETS protein
expression in MCF-12A cells. Two independent MCF-12A
stable cell populations were generated for each GFP-PEA3
and GFP-ETS-2 constructs. Subsequently, soft agar colony
assays for all transfectant populations were performed in
triplicate. Representative colonies in each culture were
imaged at eight days (Figure 3C) and quantitated at 21
days (Figure 3D) post seeding. The GFP-only negative
control did not yield multicellular colonies at eight days,
whereas large multicellular colonies were formed by the
GFP-ESE-1 positive control (Figure 3C). Further, the GFPPEA3, GFP-ETS-2 and GFP-ESE-1 NES2Mut stable transfectants produced colonies similar to those observed in
the GFP-only negative control. Colony quantitation for
each stable transfectant revealed that the GFP-only negative control produced on average 379 colonies per plate
and that the GFP-ESE-1 positive control formed 1239
colonies (Figure 3D). The GFP-PEA3 and GFP-ETS- 2

stable transfectants formed only 43 and 143 colonies,
respectively (Figure 3D), suggesting that these two fusion
proteins may exert a dominant negative effect on basal
MCF-12A cell growth in soft agarose. Finally, stable GFPESE-1 NES2Mut expression resulted in only 350 colonies
(Figure 3D). These data indicate that NES2 mutation abrogates GFP-ESE-1 transforming function in MCF-12A cells,
confirming the colony imaging data shown in Figure 3C
and also demonstrating that NES1 cannot compensate for
lost NES2 function in full length ESE-1. Moreover, these
findings indicate that neither PEA-3 nor ETS-2 possess
transforming activity and that the nuclear export function
of NES2 is essential for full-length ESE-1 transforming
function in mammary epithelial cells. To confirm the
expression of each GFP-ETS fusion construct in respective
stable transfectants, we performed RT-PCR analysis and
we sequenced the resulting PCR products for all stable cell
populations described above. As shown in Figure 3E, these
RT-PCR studies revealed that the two independently generated GFP-only stable populations (GFP-only A and
GFP-only B) yielded only the expected 169-bp product.
Similarly, only the expected 1624-bp GFP-PEA3-specific
product was amplified from each GFP-PEA3 stable population (PEA3 A and PEA3 B), and each GFP-ETS-2 stable
population demonstrated only the expected 1579-bp RTPCR product (ETS-2 A and ETS-2 B). The ESE-1 A, ESE-

(ETS-2 A and B), GFP-ESE-1 (ESE-1 A and B), GFP-ESE-1 NES2Mut (ESE-1NES2MutA and B). PEA3 A (R) and PEA3 B (R) - RNAse treated samples.

1 B, ESE-1NES2Mut A and ESE-1NES2Mut B lanes, each
representing a corresponding stable transfectant population, all exclusively demonstrated the same expected 1285bp RT-PCR product. The presence of DNA contamination
was assessed by treating total RNA from each stably transfected GFP-PEA3 pool with RNAse A (PEA3 A (R) and
PEA3 B (R), respectively) prior to RT-PCR. Furthermore,
DNA sequencing of these RT-PCR products demonstrated
both the predicted in-frame GFP fusion and the absence
of mutations in each case (data not shown).

Stable expression of the GFP-NES1-SAR protein is
sufficient to transform MCF-12A cells

Using a GFP-fusion strategy similar to that described
above, we have shown that the SAR domain of ESE-1 is
both necessary and sufficient to mediate MCF-12A cell
transformation and that enforced nuclear localization of
the SAR domain abrogates this effect [13]. These data
suggest that the SAR domain transforms MCF-12A cells
via a cytoplasmic mechanism. Having generated GFPNES-SAR fusion constructs whose expression is

Prescott et al. Molecular Cancer 2011, 10:103

restricted to the cytoplasm (Figure 2), we used these
reagents to directly test whether cytoplasmically
restricted SAR protein is sufficient to initiate transformation. To this end, we generated two independent
stable MCF-12A transfectant cell populations for GFPNES1-SAR. As negative controls we generated stable
MCF-12A transfectant populations for the GFP-only
and GFP-NLS-SAR fusions, and as positive control we
generated stable transfectants for GFP-SAR. Figure 4A
shows representative subcellular GFP fluorescence patterns for MCF-12A cells stably expressing the GFP,
GFP-SAR, GFP-NLS-SAR and GFP-NES1-SAR proteins.
Note that while Figures 1 and 2 show GFP fluorescence
patterns in transiently transfected MCF-12A, Figure 4A
shows stable transfectants. As shown in Figure 4A, in
each case, stable fusion protein localization is identical
to that observed in transient transfectants. Specifically,
GFP-only and GFP-SAR are both nuclear and cytoplasmic, the GFP-NLS-SAR is exclusively nuclear and stable
GFP-NES1-SAR is exclusively cytoplasmic (Figure 4A).
This restricted localization of GFP-SAR constructs is
further corroborated in large-field images of transiently
transfected MCF-12A and HeLa cells (Additional file 1).
Of note, the selection of the GFP-NLS-SAR and GFPNES1-SAR constructs for this experiment was arbitrary;
any GFP-SAR fusion targeted to the nucleus (i.e. GFPNLS1-SAR, GFP-NLS2-SAR, or GFP-NLS4-SAR, Figure
1C) or to the cytoplasm (GFP-NES2-SAR, Figure 2B)
should function equivalently to the respective constructs
chosen for analysis here (GFP-NLS-SAR and GFPNES1-SAR). To test the transforming function of each
stably expressed protein, each of the two independent
stable MCF-12A transfectant cell populations were used
to seed triplicate soft agarose cultures and colonies in each
culture were quantitated at 21 days post seeding (Figure
4B). Quantitation studies revealed that the GFP-only and
GFP-NLS-SAR negative control stable MCF-12A transfectants formed ~269 colonies and ~305 colonies, respectively (Figure 4B), demonstrating that GFP-NLS-SAR and
the GFP-only are equivalently deficient in transforming
function. In contrast, stable GFP-SAR and GFP-NES1SAR expression produced ~1979 and ~1022 colonies,
respectively (Figure 4B), revealing that both constructs
transform cells, although NES-SAR shows 50% reduced
colony formation. These data establish that cytoplasmically-restricted ESE-1 SAR domain is sufficient to transform MCF-12A cells.

transforming activity

Having shown that the SAR domain is necessary and sufficient to initiate transformation of benign MECs [13], we
next sought to fine map the subregions within the SAR
domain that are essential for MEC transformation. To

this end, we generated GFP-SAR mutants, in which we
sequentially replaced 11-14 amino acid blocks of the SAR
domain, in-frame, with 8-11 amino acid sequences of the
Myc epitope, derived from the human c-myc protein, and
we tested the ability of the resulting constructs to transform MCF-12A cells. Specifically, we replaced SAR
amino acids 1-14 (SAR-myc Box 1, replaced AAs correspond to ESE-1 AAs 189-202), SAR amino acids 15-27
(SAR-myc Box 2, ESE-1 AAs 203-215), and SAR amino
acids 28-40 (SAR-myc Box 3, ESE-1 AAs 216-228), each

targeting sequential amino acid blocks of the 40-AA SAR
domain (Figure 5A). As a control we also replaced amino
acids 41-50, just distal to the SAR domain (SAR-myc Box
4, ESE-1 AAs 229-239), (Figure 5A). For each GFP-SAR
mutant we generated three separate MCF-12A stable
transfectant cell populations, and each stable transfectant
population was then used to seed triplicate soft agarose
cultures. Colony counts, performed 21 days post seeding,
revealed that SAR-myc Box 1, SAR-myc Box 2 and SARmyc Box 3 stable transfectants formed 1117, 1105, and
975 colonies, respectively, while SAR-myc Box 4 control
transfectants formed 1823 colonies (Figure 5B). Thus,
MCF-12A cells transfected with SAR-myc Box 1, SARmyc Box 2 and SAR-myc Box 3 constructs formed 50%
less colonies than cells transfected with either intact

Page 8 of 15

GFP-SAR (1987 colonies, Figure 4C & Figure 5B, purple
bar) or control SAR-myc Box 4 transfectants. This result
reveals that while SAR-myc Box 1, SAR-myc Box 2, and
SAR-myc Box 3 mutants are capable of conferring the
transformed phenotype to MCF-12A cells, their transforming activity is reduced by 50% compared to GFPSAR, indicating that an intact SAR domain is required
for the full transforming effect.
The SAR domain contains the epitope for anti-ESE-1
mAb405

The ability of the SAR domain to initiate transformation
via a cytoplasmic mechanism most likely requires SAR
interaction with other proteins. To gain further insight
into the mechanism of SAR domain action, we examined

whether the SAR domain is surface exposed, and therefore has the potential to mediate protein-protein interactions. As a test of whether the SAR domain is surface
exposed, we generated monoclonal antibodies to an antigen spanning ESE-1 amino acids 129-259, containing the
TAD through AT hook domains of ESE-1 and tested
whether any of these antibodies could recognize the SAR
domain. Using the panel of anti-ESE-1 monoclonal antibodies in Western blot analysis, we found that mAb405
recognized the SAR domain with high affinity (data not
shown). To map the precise region of SAR that interacts
with mAB405 antibody we took advantage of the four
aforementioned SAR-myc box mutants, and performed
immunofluorescence analysis of MCF-12A cells transfected with these constructs (Figure 6). As shown in
Figure 6, monoclonal antibody mAB405 detected intact
GFP-SAR, as well as mutants SAR-myc Box 1, Box 2, and
Box 4, revealing that amino acids 189-215 of the SAR

CY3 ( ESE-1)

domain and amino acids 229-239 just distal to the SAR
domain do not contain the mAB405 epitope. However,
the immunofluorescence signal was completely lost with
the Box 3 mutant spanning amino acids 216-228 of the
SAR domain, indicating that this 13-AA SAR fragment
contains the mAB405 epitope. This finding identifies
ESE-1 amino acids 216-228 as an antibody-accessible
region, which is likely to be surface-exposed and readily
accessible for protein-protein interactions.

Discussion
ETS family proteins have been shown to function in the
nucleus as regulators of gene transcription [1-4]. However, despite previous documentation of ESE-1 transcription factor function [12,13,20,27-30], we have proposed a
novel nontranscriptional, cytoplasmic model whereby
ESE-1, functioning via its SAR domain, initiates mammary epithelial cell transformation [13]. For ESE-1 to

mediate transformation from a cytoplasmic location,
ESE-1 must contain a functional nuclear export
sequence. In this report, we used molecular and pharmacological methods to define functional NLS and NES
sequences within human ESE-1 and to characterize the
critical role of nuclear export of ESE-1 in its transforming
function. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cytoplasmically-restricted SAR domain is sufficient to initiate MEC
transformation and that full transforming activity
requires an intact SAR domain.
ESE-1 has been documented to operate as a nuclear
activator of promoter function in transient transfection
reporter assays [28-30]. Indeed, transient transfection of
GFP-ESE-1 into several different cell lines, including
HeLa cervical carcinoma and T47D and SKBR-3 breast
cancer cells, demonstrates nuclear localization of this
fusion protein (data not shown). In this report we use
progressive truncations in GFP-fusion gain-of-function
studies to map ESE-1 nuclear localizing activity to a
basic, six AA sequence (242HGKRKR247) located within
the A/T Hook domain, but outside of the ESE-1 DBD
(Figures 1A, B, & 1C). We confirmed that the DBD
does not contain an NLS sequence required for nuclear
localization of ESE-1, using a loss-of-function deletion
study of the ESE-1 DBD, demonstrating that DBD deletion does not impair ESE-1 nuclear import (Figure 1E).
Furthermore, we have previously reported that in-frame
deletion of the ESE-1 A/T Hook domain (AAs 236-267),
which includes the functional ESE-1 NLS identified
here, completely inhibits ESE-1 nuclear import [13].
Indeed, Elf3, the murine ortholog of ESE-1, has been
shown to contain a functional NLS located at an equivalent position and, in contrast to ESE-1, an additional
NLS in its DBD [21]. Interestingly, while both Elf3 NLS
motifs function autonomously in fluorescent proteinfusion assays, they appear to target to different subnuclear regions. However, since neither of the Elf3 NLS
motifs has been individually mutated or deleted in the
context of full-length Elf3, the requirement of either
NLS in Elf3 nuclear targeting remains unknown. Nevertheless, our data confirm that the functional ESE-1 NLS
resides within the A/T hook domain and that ESE-1
DBD is neither necessary nor sufficient to mediate ESE1 nuclear localization. This finding is surprising in light
of previous reports demonstrating an essential role for
the highly conserved ETS DBD in ETS factor nuclear
localization [17-19]. Finally, amino acid comparison analyses performed by us and others [31] reveal that the
ESE-1 NLS discovered here is not present in any other
ETS factor, including other members of the ESE
subfamily.
Extensive evidence supports nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling as a regulatory mechanism for ETS protein function
[32-35]. A common regulatory mechanism involves

Page 10 of 15

MAPK signaling cascades, which trigger nuclear export
of ETS repressors such as NET (new ETS), YAN, ERF
(ETS-2 Repressor Factor) and TEL (Translocation
ETS Leukemia) and thus release ETS-mediated gene
repression. For example, the ETS DBD of the ternary
complex factor NET contains a functional, CRM1dependent NES (7 LWQFLLQLLL16) that appears to be
highly-conserved within the DBDs of most ETS proteins
[32], including ESE-1 (i.e. NES2: 275 LWEFIRDILI 284 ).
Activation of the c-Jun N terminal kinase kinase (JNKK)
pathway mediates nuclear exclusion of NET, relieving
transcriptional repression induced by NET. Moreover,
site-specific mutation of the NET NES traps NET in the
nucleus, resulting in increased NET repressor function
[32]. These data point to a crucial regulatory role for the
NET NES.
In this report, we identify two ESE-1 NES signals, NES1
and NES2, but we demonstrate that only one, NES2,
plays a critical role in the nuclear export and transforming function of intact ESE-1 protein. NES1 is located in
the ESE-1 Pointed domain but appears to mediate
nuclear export, in a CRM1-dependent manner, only
when outside of the context of full length ESE-1 protein
(Figure 2C). In addition, comparative analysis of ETS factors Pointed domain sequences reveals that most other
ETS factors, including ESE-2 and ESE-3, do not conserve
the NES1 motif. In contrast, NES2 appears to be well
conserved in the DBD region of most ETS proteins, suggesting a conserved function of this motif in the ETS
family (analysis not shown). Here we show that inactivating mutations in the ESE-1 NES2 completely inhibit
GFP-ESE-1 transforming function (Figures 3C & 1D),
indicating that GFP-ESE-1 nuclear export plays an essential role in GFP-ESE-1-mediated transformation. An
alternative to this conclusion is that mutation of DBDembedded NES2 disrupts ETS DBD-DNA binding and
that it is this disruption, rather than the inhibition of
NES2 function, that impairs GFP-ESE-1 transforming
activity. However, crystallographic structural data for the
DNA-bound ESE-1 DBD indicate that NES2 is localized
to a DBD subregion that does not make direct contact
with target DNA, except for leucine 275 [36]. This finding is consistent with our previously published data
showing that the domains of ESE-1 that are required for
transcription factor function (e.g. the ESE-1 TAD) are
not necessary to initiate transformation in benign MECs,
whereas the SAR domain alone is sufficient in this type
of transformation assay (Figure 4) [13]. As noted above,
the ESE-1 NES2 is similar in sequence and location to
the functional MAPK-regulated NES motifs in NET and
ERF. However, we have been unable to identify any specific kinase(s) that regulate ESE-1 subcellular localization.
Specifically, co-transfection studies using constitutively
active forms of JNK, MAPK, ERK and v-SRC protein

Prescott et al. Molecular Cancer 2011, 10:103
http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/10/1/103

kinases revealed that none of these kinases enhanced
cytoplasmic shuttling of transiently co-expressed nuclear
GFP-ESE-1 (data not shown). Taken together, our data
suggest that basal ESE-1 subcellular localization represents the summed influences of NES and NLS functions.
A key finding in this report is that the ESE-1 SAR
domain alone, as GFP-NES-SAR, can be stably and specifically targeted to the cytoplasm in MCF-12A cells and
that this cytoplasmic localization is sufficient to initiate
MEC transformation (Figure 4). The decreased transformation potency of GFP-NES-SAR vs. GFP-SAR observed
in our study is most likely due to the differential levels of
expression of GFP-NES-SAR vs. GFP-SAR. However,
another possible explanation of this result is that the
nuclear fraction of SAR contributes to the transformation, even though it is insufficient to evoke any transformation effect by itself. Furthermore, all of the data to
date point to the likely requirement that the SAR domain
interacts with other protein(s) to initiate transformation.
Supporting this notion are the observations that amino
acids 216-228 are accessible to mAB405 (Figure 6), and
that Pak-1 phosphorylates serine 207, with b-TrCP ubiquitinating the S207-dephosphorylated form and targeting it for proteosome-mediated degradation [37]. Indeed,
the report by Manavathi et al. [37] provided important
insights into the mechanisms of transformation initiation
in benign MCF-12A MECs by ESE-1, revealing that Pak1 mediated phosphorylation of serine 207 within the SAR
domain, results in increased protein stability and
increased transformation potency of ESE-1 [37]. Of note,
site-specific mutation of serine 207 to alanine resulted in
50% loss of soft agar colony formation, which is consistent with our SAR-myc Box 2 data, also showing 50%
reduction (Figure 5). However, mutation of Box 1 and
Box 3 which span the amino- and carboxy- terminal
regions of the SAR domain, respectively, also resulted in
about 50% loss of transformation activity (Figure 5), suggesting that an intact three-dimensional structure of the
SAR domain is required for optimal transformation
potency. One caveat in this study was that myc Boxes 1,
2, and 3 all contain the sequence LISEEDLL, while in
myc Box 4 the two terminal “LL” amino acids are missing. This may lead to an alternative interpretation that
the LISEEDLL motif within the myc sequence functions
as an active inhibitor of transformation, and that the two
terminal “LL” amino acids are required for inhibitor
function. To gain further insight of the key structurefunction aspects of the SAR domain, we performed a
phylogenetic analysis of SAR domain protein sequences
derived from fifteen different species, of which fourteen
are mammalian, in order to identify the most conserved
regions (Figure 7). This comparison revealed that the
SAR domain is found only in ESE-1 orthologs and in no
other proteins in the NCBI database (not shown).

Page 11 of 15

However, the SAR domain is highly conserved among
mammals, with a clear reduction in conservation in the
chicken SAR sequence (Figure 7). Furthermore, there
appear to be two highly conserved subregions: amino
acids 189-198 and amino acids 208-220. While the conserved amino terminal region appears not to contain any
known functional motifs, the region containing amino
acids 208-220 coincides with the PEST sequence,
209
SSDSGGSDVD 218 identified previously [37], and a
highly conserved putative CKII phosphorylation site,
217
SDVD220 . However, S207 is mutated to proline in 6
out of 15 species in the database.

Conclusions
Our data precisely define NLS and NES signals in the
human version of ESE-1 that play a pivotal role in regulating its subcellular localization and its ensuing transforming function. Furthermore, we report that
transformation of human MECs requires an intact SAR
domain that can be targeted exclusively to the cytoplasm,
and that the SAR motif is accessible for protein and/or
ligand interactions. This report is important, since it provides critical mechanistic details of ESE-1 function, and it
significantly expands our understanding of the role of
ETS factors in mammary cell transformation.

Generation of GFP-ESE-1ΔDBD and GFP-ESE-1 NES2Mut was accomplished using a two-step PCR overlap
extension strategy [38,39]. In both cases, the 5’ ESE-1
sense primer [13] was used with the following antisense
primers to generate the 5’ segment of each construct,
respectively: 5’-GGCAAAAACTCAAGCGGCTGGAAG
(GFP-ESE-1ΔDBD antisense) and 5’-GATGAGGGC
GTCCCGGGCGAACTCCCACAG (ESE-1 NES2Mut
antisense). To generate 3’ overlap segments, the 3’ ESE-1
antisense primer [13] was used with the following respective sense primers: 5’-AGTTTTTGCCGTGGGTGC
CTCTG (GFP-ESE-1ΔDBD sense) and 5’- CTGTG
GGAGTTCGCCCGGGACGCCCTCATCCACCCGGA
GCTCAACGAG (ESE-1 NES2Mut sense). The resulting
PCR overlap extension products were ligated into the
pEGFP-C3 plasmid as described previously [13]. Similar
PCR strategy, followed by ligation into pEGFP-C3 plasmid,

was used to generate GFP-SAR-myc Box 2 and GFP-SARmyc Box 3 constructs. In both cases, 5’ SAR sense primer
[13] was used with the following respective antisense primers to generate the 5’ segments of each construct: 5’gtcttcctcgctgatcagtttctgctcACCAGTCCCTGCGGTGGAG
(GFP-SAR-myc Box 2 antisense), 5’- gtcttcctcgctgatcagtttctgcTCACTTCCACCGGAGTCTGAGG (GFP-SARmyc Box 3 antisense). Whereas, the 3’ SAR antisense

ACTG (GFP-SAR-myc Box 2 sense), 5’- ctgatcagcgaggaagacctgttgAGCGATGGTTTTCGTGACTGC (GFP-SARmyc Box 3 sense). To produce the GFP-SAR-myc Box 1
construct, the following sense primer was used in a PCR
with the 3’ SAR antisense primer [13]: 5’- ccggaattcatctgatcagcgaggaagacctgttgGCTTCTCGGAGCTCCCACTCC.
Similarly, the GFP-SAR-myc Box 4 sequence was amplified using the following antisense primer in a PCR with

Prescott et al. Molecular Cancer 2011, 10:103

the 5’ SAR sense primer [13]: 5’- ccggaattcatgtcttcctcgctgatcagtttctgctcGGGGAAGAGCTTGCCATC. Both sequences
were ligated into the pEGFP-C3 EcoR I site, to produce
the GFP-SAR-myc Box 1 and GFP-SAR-myc Box 4 constructs, respectively. For each primer used in generation of
GFP-SAR-myc Box mutants, capital letters show SAR
domain coding sequence, and italicized text shows myc
epitope sequence. To generate the pEGFP-PEA3 and
pEGFP-ETS-2 expression plasmids, the full-length human
PEA3 and ETS-2 coding sequences were amplified by RTPCR from T47D human breast cell line whole cell RNA.
The respective primer pairs used in these amplifications
were as follows: 5’-cgagatctccggaattcatATGGAGCGG
AGGATGAAAGCCGG vs. 5’-cgagatctccggaattcatCTAGTAAGAGTAGCCACCCTTG (PEA3) and 5’-cgagatctccggaattcatATGAATGATTTCGGAATCAAG vs. 5’-cgag

In each case, restriction sites are in bold, and start and
stop codons are underlined. Each full-length coding
sequence was then ligated into the pEGFP-C3 plasmid as
described [13]. The absence of mutations in each expression construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Fluorescence microscopy

MCF-12A cells were transfected with GFP-fusion
expression plasmids and plated as described previously
[13]. Alternatively, stable MCF-12A transfectants were
plated directly onto glass coverslips for confocal microscopy. For nuclear staining, some cover slips were
stained with 300 nM 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) [13]. In addition, some coverslips were incubated
for 15 minutes at 37°C in PBS containing 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Cell
imaging and image acquisition were performed as
described previously [13].
Stable cell lines

Stable MCF-12A cell expression of each GFP fusion
protein was obtained as described in [13] and two or
three independent stable transfectant populations were
generated for each expression plasmid.
Soft agarose assays

Triplicate soft agarose cultures were prepared for each

[13]. Each experiment was repeated as noted in the text.
Representative colonies were imaged and quantitated as
described in [13].

directed against a terminal portion of the GFP openreading frame and an antisense primer specific for a transcribed but untranslated sequence immediately downstream of the DNA insertion site in the pEGFP-C3
plasmid. The Omniscript™ RT kit (Qiagen) was used for
reverse transcription as described in [13]. Some RNA samples were treated with RNAse A (Five Prime Three Prime,
Inc., Boulder, CO) prior to reverse transcription. All RTPCRs were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Immunofluorescence

Cells were plated directly onto glass cover slips in a 12well tissue culture plate and transfected with GFP-SAR
constructs using Effectene (Qiagen). Two days post-plating, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20-25
min at room temperature and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, cells were permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes, followed
by three washes in 100 mM glycine in PBS. Permeabilized
cells were blocked in blocking buffer containing 0.5%
Tween-20, 10% goat serum in PBS for 1-2 h. Cells were
incubated with anti-ESE-1 monoclonal antibody mAB405
[16] diluted 1:500 in the blocking buffer overnight at 4°C.
After washes, cells were incubated for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson
Immunoresearch). Nuclei were counterstained using
300 nM DAPI (Invitrogen, #D-1306).
Alignments of SAR protein sequences

Amino acid sequences were retrieved from non-redundant protein sequences NCBI database using BLASTP
2.2.24+ program and the human SAR sequence (ESE-1
AAs 189-239) as a query (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,
[40]). For the purpose of calculation of percent identity
to human sequence, conservative substitutions and gaps
were considered as non-identical amino acids. When
there was an insertion, percent identity was calculated
with the number of amino acids in the longer protein as
the denominator. For the purpose of calculation of percent conservation at a given AA position between human
and the remaining species, conservative substitutions and
gaps were considered as non-identical amino acids, while
insertions were excluded from analysis.

RT-PCR

Whole cell RNA was prepared from individual stable
transfectant populations using an RNA STAT-60 kit (Teltest, Inc., Friendswood, TX). GFP fusion transcripts in
each RNA sample were identified using a sense primer
