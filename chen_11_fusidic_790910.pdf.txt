Abstract
Background: The prevalence of resistance to fusidic acid of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was
increased each year in a Taiwan hospital. Thirty-four MRSA clinical isolates collected in 2007 and 2008 with reduced
susceptibility to FA were selected for further evaluation the presence of resistance determinants.
Results: The most common resistance determinant was fusC, found in 25 of the 34 MRSA isolates. One of the 25
fusidic acid-resistant MRSA harboured both fusB and fusC, which is the first time this has been identified. Mutations
in fusA were found in 10 strains, a total of 3 amino-acid substitutions in EF-G (fusA gene) were detected. Two
substitutions with G556S and R659L were identified for the first time. Low-level resistance to fusidic acid (MICs, ≤ 32
μg/ml) was found in most our collection. All collected isolates carried type III SCCmec elements. MLST showed the
isolates were MRSA ST239. PFGE revealed nine different pulsotypes in one cluster.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that the increase in the number of fusidic acid resistant among the MRSA
isolates in this hospital is due mainly to the distribution of fusC determinants. Moreover, more than one fusidic
acid-resistance mechanism was first detected in a same stain in our collection.

Background
The frequently-encountered multi-antibiotic resistance
of MRSA has become a major health problem [1,2]. The
prevalence of MRSA isolates, most of which are health
care associated, has slowly increased since 1982, and the
appearance and increasing incidence of communityassociated MRSA infections has been documented.
Globally, methicillin resistance among nosocomial S.
aureus isolates is common [3,4].
Fusidic acid has been used to treat infections with S.
aureus for over 35 years. It is usually used in combination
with agents such as vancomycin or rifampin in the treatment of systemic infections caused by MRSA [5]. Fusidic
acid inhibits protein synthesis by blocking the elongation
of the nascent polypeptide chain through binding to EFG on the ribosome and preventing the dissociation of EF* Correspondence: ltwu@mail.cmu.edu.tw

G⋅GDP from the ribosome [6,7]. The frequency of fusidic
acid resistance is not very high; however, the emergence
of clinical staphylococcal species that are resistant to fusidic acid has been reported [8-11].
The primary mechanism of fusidic acid resistance in S.
aureus relates to mutations in fusA, the gene that encodes
the ribosomal translocase and translation elongation factor
EF-G [12,13]. More than 30 different amino acid substitution mutations in fusA have been identified [12,14,15].
Subsequently, resistance in natural isolates may also result
from the horizontal acquisition of fusB, a poorly characterized plasmid-mediated resistance mechanism [13]. The
gene fusB is usually carried by a 21-kb plasmid, pUB101
[16], however, it can also be chromosomal [17]. The fusB
gene encodes an inducible protein that protects an in vitro
translation system against the inhibitory action of fusidic
acid [8]. Recently, two fusB homologues, designated fusC
and fusD, have been identified in the chromosome of clinical isolates of S. aureus and S. saprophyticus, respectively
[18]. In addition, fusidic acid-resistant small-colony

variants (SCVs) of S. aureus with mutations in rplF have
been designated as FusE mutants [14]. Although frequencies of resistance to fusidic acid have remained generally
low, each of these mechanisms has multiple genetic
causes, and emerging resistance is a problem that could
limit the therapeutic options available for treatment of staphylococcal infections [19].
In this study, a series of MRSA clinical isolates recovered at a regional teaching hospital in middle Taiwan
showing fusidic acid MIC ≥ 2 μg/ml. The high distribution of fusidic acid resistance determinants fusC was
confirmed in MRSA. In addition, different fusidic acid
resistance determinants-containing in one isolate was
also demonstrated.

Methods
Bacterial isolates

From April 2007 to January 2008, 34 clinical isolates of
MRSA with fusidic acid resistance were recovered from
34 different patients at Tungs’ Taichung MetroHarbor
Hospital (TTMHH), a 1405-bed regional teaching hospital in central Taiwan. S. aureus ATCC 29213 and NCTC
8325 have consistently been used as a quality control
strain and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) standard strain, respectively. Luria-Bertani (LB) agar and LB
broth were used for bacterial growth at 37°C with aeration. Mueller-Hinton agar was used for all determinations of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). All
isolates were identified on the colony morphology,
Gram’s stain, a positive catalase reaction and/or results
obtained with the phoenix system (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) and frozen at -80°C until used.

(Promega, Madison, WI) with 0.5 mg/ml of lysostaphin
and 0.3 mg/ml of RNase for the lysis step. The multiplex
PCR assay for fusB and fusC used oligonucleotide primers
BF (5’-CTATAATGATATTAATGAGATTTTTGG), BR
(5’-TTTTTACATATTGACCATCCGAATTGG), CF (5’TTAAAGAAAAAGATATTGATATCTCGG), and CR
(5’-TTTACAGAATCCTTTTACTTTATTTGG) to generate amplicons of 431 and 332 bp from the fusB and
fusC genes, respectively. The cycling conditions consisted
of an initial denaturation step (94°C for 3 min), followed
by 25 cycles of 94°C (30 s), 57°C (30 s) and 72°C (45 s)
[20]. For further identification of the fusB and fusC
genes, primers FusB-R (5’-ACAGGATCCATTTTCAC
AAACATAGT) and FusB-F1(5’-AGGGATCCCATATTTAAAGCTATTG) were used to generate an amplicon
comprising the 642 bp fusB with 122 bp of upstream
DNA [8], and primers sas0043U (5’-GTAGGATC
CATTGGGAATGATAAATAGTGA) and sas0043L (5’TTTGGATCCATCGATTAAGAGTGAGGTACA) were
used to generate a 2.5 kb amplicon with fusC [18]. The
fusA gene was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide primers rpsU and tufL and sequenced with these and three
additional primers (AintS1, 5’-TAAGGGTCAGTCATAACTTT; AintS2, 5’-TTCAAAAACAAAGGTGTTCA;
and AintS3, 5’-ATGTATTCACGAGGAAC) [20]. The
PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels
and visualized under ultraviolet light. The PCR products
were then purified with a commercial kit and both
strands of the amplicons were sequenced on an ABI
PRISM 370 automated sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Sequence analyses were performed online at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests

MICs of different antimicrobial agents were determined
using the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (BD
Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) and interpreted
according to the criteria provided by the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Fusidic acid susceptibility was screened by the disk diffusion method
with 10 μg fusidic acid containing disks. The interpretive criterion of susceptibility was an inhibition zone ≥
22 mm in diameter. Fusidic acid MICs were further
determined by an agar dilution method following the
CLSI guidelines, and susceptibility was categorized using
the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)/British Society of Antimicrobial
Chemotherapy (BSAC) criteria (susceptible, MIC < 2
μg/ml; resistant, MIC ≥ 2 μg/ml). The testing MIC
range of fusidic acid was 0.12-512 μg/ml.
DNA manipulation and PCR

Total DNA from three to five isolated colonies was prepared using a Wizard genomic DNA preparation kit

Southern blot hybridization

DNA samples were digested by EcoR1 and analyzed by
electrophoresis at 30 V for 2 h in a 1% w/v agarose
gel. The gel was denatured in a solution of 0.5 M
NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl, neutralized in 0.5 M Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5) and 1.5 M NaCl on Whatman filter paper
(Maidstone, UK), and finally saturated with 10% w/v
SDS (15 min for each step). DNA was transferred to a
positively charged nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) using an electrophoretic
transfer cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
A probe for fusC was prepared by randomly labelling
the 2.5 kb PCR product of fusC with digoxigenin using
a commercial kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The fusC gene for the hybridization probe was
amplified using oligonucleotide primers fusCU 5’GAGG AATATCATATGAATAAAATAGAAGTGTA
and fusCL 5’-AGAGTGGATCCCAAAATATAACAAC
CCTGATC [18].

SCCmec typing by PCR

The presence of mecA was determined using the primers MR1 5’-GTGGAATTGGCCAATACAGG and
MR2 5’-TGAGTTCTGCAGTACCGGAT, which were
used to PCR-amplify a 1,339 bp internal fragment of the
gene [21]. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles of 1 min at
95°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C. Characterization of SCCmec elements was performed by multiple
PCR as previously described [22].
PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST)

Genotyping of S. aureus strains was conducted by
macrorestriction of bacterial DNA followed by PFGE
separation of the resulting fragments. Whole chromosomal DNA of the clinical isolates embedded in agarose
gel plugs (FMC Bioproducts, Philadelphia, PA) were
treated with proteinase K and SmaI restriction endonuclease according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). PFGE and
DNA fingerprints analysis were performed as described
previously [23]. The isolates were also analyzed by
MLST as described previously [24].
Plasmid curing

The clinical isolate with pUB101-like plasmid was subjected to elevated temperature-mediated plasmid elimination by sequential passages in LB (approximately 100
cells into 100 ml) at 43°C with shaking for about 30
generations. Cured strains were diluted and plated on
LA plates (LB plus 1% agar; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to obtain single colonies. Loss of cadmium resistance was screened by replica plating at 37°C [25]. Loss
of the plasmid was confirmed by loss of unselected phenotypic traits (ampicillin resistance) and by PCR of
cadXD [15].
Ethics

This study was reviewed by the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) of the TTMHH and it was decided not to
constitute the research involving human subject. An
exemption certificate was issued by the IRB to attest
this fact.

phenotype. All isolates were uniformly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, clindamycin, erythromycin,
ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The susceptible rates and
MIC ranges of other antibiotics were as follows: rifampin 91%; chloramphenicol 88%; moxifloxacin 6%; levofloxacin 3%; tetracycline 3%; and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole 3%. The study results revealed that
fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus was resistant to nearly all
tested antibiotics except for vancomycin, teicoplanin,
linezolid, nitrofurantoin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, chloramphenicol, and rifampin.
Genetic basis of resistance to fusidic acid: fusB and fusC

The genetic basis for resistance to fusidic acid in the
isolates was determined by a multiplex PCR assay capable of detecting both the 431 bp fusB and 332 bp fusC
genes [20]. Twenty-five of the 34 isolates (73.5%) were
found to harbour the gene encoding fusC and one (isolate 32) among the 25 isolates also harboured the gene
encoding fusB. Furthermore, using plasmid DNA of isolate 32 as a template, PCR with FusB-specific primers
FusB-R1 and FusB-F1 and subsequent sequence analysis
of the 764 bp PCR product confirmed the 100% identity
of the fusB gene from plasmid pUB101. A curing study
revealed that both the cadXD and fusB genes were plasmid encoded, and that fusC remained in the plasmid
cured isolate 32. The MIC of fusidic acid for isolate 32
was 8 μg/ml after curing of the plasmid.
The full-length fusC gene was identified by PCR and
sequenced in isolates 4, 24, 29, 30, and 32. The alignment of the amino acid sequences deduced from these
isolates 4, 24, 30, and 32 fusC DNA sequences revealed
100% identity with FusC protein of S. aureus MSSA476
[18]. However, fusC from isolate 29 carried a nonsense
mutation (S175 was encoded by TAA rather than TCA)
that produced a change from fusidic acid resistance
(MIC = 8 μg/ml) to fusidic acid susceptibility (MIC <
0.125 μg/ml) following two non-selective subcultures.
The other isolates were screened for the presence of the
fusC gene by Southern hybridization, and all tested isolates were positive for fusC (Figure 1).
Detection of fusA gene mutations

Results
Isolates and susceptibility tests

The sources of the 34 fusidic acid-resistant MRSA isolates included sputum (n = 9), pus (n = 16), blood (n =
5), urine (n = 2), ascites (n = 1), and tip of a central
venous catheter (n = 1) (Table 1). All 34 clinical isolates
were analyzed in more detail with regard to their antibiotic resistance profiles, and they were all susceptible
to vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin-dalfopristin,
linezolid, and nitrofurantoin. The MICs for fusidic acid
(2-64 μg/ml) were low to moderate level resistance

PCR amplification and complete sequencing were performed to detect fusA gene mutations in the 34 isolates
(Table 1). Five isolates possessed a mutation in H457Y,
two isolates (isolates 9 and 33) exhibited a G556S mutation, and two isolates (isolates 10 and 21) harboured
mutations in H457 Y and G556 S. In addition, isolate 31
possessed a mutation in H457Y and R659L. Single amino
acid substitutions were found in seven isolates, and two
amino acid substitutions were found in the other three.
This is the first time that two different amino acid substitutions, G556S and R659L, have been reported in fusA

encoded with fusC and fusA gene mutation. In this
study, the most common amino acid substitution H457Y
did not result in a high level of fusidic acid resistance
(MIC ≥ 128 μg/ml).
Molecular epidemiological analysis

All 34 isolates included in this study met the criteria of
being health care associated. The genotype analyses and
their frequencies are shown in Table 1. Only one defined
MLST type (ST239) was evident. All 34 isolates carried
SCCmec type III elements. PFGE patterns of SmaI
macrorestriction fragment analysis of these 34 isolates
revealed nine distinct pulsotypes (A1-A9) that were

classified into one cluster (> 80% similarity) (Figure 2).
The results of PFGE patterns are summarized in Table 1.

Discussion
Previous studies of fusidic acid-resistance in clinical isolates have mostly focused on methicillin-susceptible S.
aureus (MSSA) and other staphylococci [17,20,26]. Chen
et al. recently reported that the prevalence of fusidic
acid-resistance determinants was quite different between
MRSA and MSSA groups [27]. In northern Taiwan collections, the fusA mutations were the major determinant
(84%) followed by fusC with 16% fusidic acid-resistance
in MRSA isolates [27]. In the present study based in
central Taiwan, we found that the fusidic acid-resistant

predominant determinant in MRSA was a high prevalence of fusC with 74% in clinical isolates. Furthermore,
one isolate carried the fusB determinant on the plasmid
and fusC determinant on the chromosome in a clinical
fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus isolate. The FusC protein
has a 45% amino acid similarity to FusB. The fusC gene
was originally identified in the genome sequence of S.
aureus MSSA476, and has been reported in fusidic acidresistant S. intermedius and S. epidermidis [18,20]. In
most European collections, fusC has been shown to be
responsible for resistance to fusidic acid in all S. aureus
strains examined that do not carry fusB or resistance
mutations in fusA [17,18]. Moreover, the fusB gene has
only been detected in MSSA, not in MRSA in most clinical collections in Taiwan [27]. Therefore, the present
study shows the spread of fusC in Taiwan and for the
first time demonstrates the presence of both fusB and
fusC in a MRSA clinical isolate.
The most common mutation in fusA that conferred
resistance to fusidic acid was the substitution H457Y in
our study (Table 1). We reviewed the English literature
and did not find any reports of two amino acid substitutions in EF-G of G556S and R659L relative to the resistance of fusidic acid. Mutations in EF-G are associated
with fitness cost in the fusidic acid-resistance of S. aureus in vitro and in vivo [12,14]. The resistance mutations with amino acid substitutions occur mostly in
structural domain III of EF-G, but some occur in
domains I and V [28,29]. We identified a novel substitution present in fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus (isolates 9
and 33), which conferred an identical resistance mutation in fusA (G 556 S). The two isolates exhibited

Page 5 of 8

resistance to fusidic acid with MIC = 16 μg/ml and carried neither fusB nor fusC. In addition, substitution
G556S was found in isolates 10 and 21 and was accompanied by mutations in fusA (H 457 Y). Another novel
substitution amino acid substitution R 659 L located in
domain V of EF-G was found to be accompanied with
fusC mutations in our study. The role of this newly
found amino acid substitution in fusA on the level of
resistance is unknown and needs further investigation.
Of the 34 isolates that were studied completely, isolate 4
harboured fusC and a resistance mutation in fusA
(H457Y). This indicates that the fusidic acid-resistance in
these MRSA clinical isolates had multiple genetic
lineages.
The isolates with fusB and fusC determinants usually
displayed higher level resistance to fusidic acid (> 16 μg/
ml) [8,17]. The MICs of fusidic acid in our collections
carrying fusC ranged from 2-64 μg/ml. It is not clear
the reason why in non-selective subcultures, isolate 29
with one mutation site of the fusC gene lost the resistance to fusidic acid. We hypothesized that the mutation
may result in FusC truncated after amino acid 174, and
thus isolate 29 became susceptible. In this study, the
single-amino-acid substitutions in EF-G substitution did
not result in a high level fusidic acid resistance which is
similar to previous report in MRSA strains belonging to
CC8, H 457 Y mutation was associated with MIC of 64
μg/L and H 457 Q was associated with MIC of 4 μg/L
[30]. The level of fusidic acid resistance in the isolate 4
with two fusidic acid resistance determinants couldn’t
be accounted for by their genotypes when compared
with other clinical isolates with one of the determinants.
A previous study showed a similar result that a laboratory strain containing both fusA resistance mutation and
fusB failed to increase the level of fusidic acid resistance
[17]. The chromosomal gene fusC confer resistance to
fusidic acid on S. aureus or S. intermedius is identified
with 45% amino acid similarity to FusB, protect EF-G
from the antibiotic [18]. Genes for FusB-type resistance
(fusB and fusC) are thought to act by the same mechanism of protection the drug target [18]. It remains
unclear whether these resistance mechanisms of a strain
do act in combination or not. The precise action mode
of FusB-type resistance awaits further investigation. The
level of fusidic acid resistance in isolate 32 did not
decrease after curing the pUB101 plasmid. The result
may indicate that the resistance mechanisms do not act
synergistically or additively.
In this study, all MRSA isolates met the criteria of
being health-care associated. PFGE patterns revealed
that there was greater than 80% similarity among the
isolates. MLST and SCCmec typing showed that all isolates belonged to ST239 and carried SCCmec III elements, which is the most prevalent health care-

associated strain of MRSA in Taiwan [31]. A previous
study conducted in 2002-2007 in northern Taiwan also
revealed that most of fusidic acid-resistant MRSA isolates carried SCCmec type III [27]. The two studies
results suggest that a clonal strain had disseminated in
Taiwan during the period of the study. In contrast to
our findings, a previous European study finding indicated that the majority of fusidic acid-resistant MRSA
isolates belonged to CC80-MRSA-IV clone carrying fusB
and CC5 clone harbouring fusC [30].

Conclusion
In conclusion, we hypothesize that the prevalence of
fusidic acid-resistance in S. aureus was commonly associated with the fusC determinant in our isolates. It is
interesting to note that some studied isolates possessed
more than one fusidic acid-resistance mechanism in our
collection. The fusC and acquired FusB-family determinants in a single isolate were first detected and one isolate with fusC also carried a fusA mutation in H457 Y.
Phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated the spread of

a major clonal strain of fusidic acid-resistant MRSA in
our institution. Due to the concern of clonal spread and
growing expansion of fusidic acid-resistant determinants,
particularly FusC in MRSA, large-scale, prospective surveillance monitoring for fusidic acid-resistance in S. aureus and MRSA is now ongoing in Taiwan.
