Abstract
We describe the establishment and analysis of a genus-wide comparative framework composed of
12 bacterial artificial chromosome fingerprint and end-sequenced physical maps representing the
10 genome types of Oryza aligned to the O. sativa ssp. japonica reference genome sequence. Over
932 Mb of end sequence was analyzed for repeats, simple sequence repeats, miRNA and single
nucleotide variations, providing the most extensive analysis of Oryza sequence to date.

Background

Comparative genomics is a powerful tool for unraveling the
evolutionary history and gene functionality of related species.
The availability of high resolution genetic and physical maps
and genome assemblies has established comparative genomics platforms in organisms ranging from bacteria and fungi to
animals and plants [1-7]. The majority of sequence-based
eukaryotic platforms have focused on comparisons between
genera [8-11]. Although highly informative, the divergence
times between genera are often too distant to be useful for the
identification of conserved noncoding sequences such as
transcription factor binding sites, enhancers and matrix
attachment regions (for example, see [12,13]). Sequence com-

parisons between species within a single genus have focused
primarily on orthologous loci or genomic regions [14,15].
Whole genome comparative platforms within a genus are still
in their infancy, with the most notable exception being the
generation of whole genome shotgun assemblies of 12 Drosophila species that span an evolutionary time frame of
approximately 60 million years [16].
In plants, rice (Oryza sativa) and thale cress (Arabidopsis
thaliana) are important model systems for functional and
evolutionary biology. Both genomes have been completely
sequenced [17,18] and serve as the reference sequences for
the major monocot and dicot plant lineages. Rice has added

significance by virtue of being the world's most important
crop, directly feeding half the human population. The population that depends on rice is expected to double in 25-50 years
and there is thus an intense effort by breeders to double current rice yields using less land and water and on poorer soils
[19]. To achieve this goal, the plant biology community is
engaged in a concerted effort to functionally characterize all
plant genes in both model plants using approaches including
genetics, transgenetics, and comparative genomics. These
efforts have significance not only to world food and bioenergy security issues but also to fundamental eukaryotic
biology.
Comparative genomics across the cereals and within the
genus Oryza will play a major role in these efforts. Oryza is
composed of 24 species, including 2 domesticated (O. sativa,
and O. glaberrima) and 22 wild species [20,21]. These species are classified into ten genome types (six diploids and four
allotetraploids) based on crossing barriers [22,23], chromosome pairing [24,25], morphology [26,27], and molecular
phylogenetics [28]. Compared to the domesticates, the wild
relatives of rice are phenotypically inferior grass-like plants,
but are a virtually untapped reservoir of agriculturally important genes and allelic variants that can be used to improve cultivated rice [21,29]. Therefore, comparative genomics of wild
and domesticated Oryza species may not only provide useful
materials for breeding, but will also shed light on the evolution and domestication of cultivated rice.
Our long-term objective is to develop a genome-level comparative experimental system for the genus Oryza (the Oryza
Map Alignment Project (OMAP)). Our strategy is to develop
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-end sequence (BES)
physical frameworks of the ten genome types of Oryza and
align them to the reference sequence. These frameworks can
then be populated with an array of phenotypic, genetic, biochemical, and physiological data to address fundamental
questions in biology and agriculture. Previously, we described
the construction and characterization of 12 BAC libraries
from representative species that encompass the 10 genome
types of Oryza [30]. Here we report the construction of 12
BAC/BES framework physical maps derived from these
libraries and an analysis of the BESs in terms of transposable
element, simple sequence repeat (SSR), microRNA (miRNA),
and single nucleotide variation (SNV) content.

Results
Fingerprinting, BAC end sequencing and contig
assembly to generate phase I physical maps for the ten
genome types of Oryza
BAC-based physical maps for the ten genome types of Oryza
were generated using a two-step procedure. First, clones from
12 Oryza BAC libraries [30] were fingerprinted [31] and BAC
end sequenced. Fingerprints from each library were then
assembled into contigs using FPC [32]. Fingerprint, BES and

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R45

FPC assembly statistics are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
Briefly, we generated a total of 710,536 fingerprints and
1,452,912 BESs (approximately 932 Mb). Fingerprinting and
BES success rates ranged from 85-94% and 88-96%, respectively. BESs represented approximately 8-17% of each Oryza
genome, corresponding to one sequence tag per every 4-8 kb.
From 90-98% of the BESs were paired and ranged in
sequence length from 559 bp in O. minuta [BBCC] to 717 bp
in O. officinalis [CC]. More importantly, an average of 89% of
the fingerprinted clones had paired BESs. An average of 95%
of the fingerprints assembled into contigs, with the remainder
existing as singletons. The number of assembled contigs for
each species ranged from 422 in O. brachyantha [FF] to
3,962 in O. minuta [BBCC], which roughly correlated with the
size of each genome. The 12 unedited FPC assemblies are
defined as phase I physical maps (Table 2) and are available
interactively using WebFPC [33] or CMap, or as downloadable FPC files (see Materials and methods).
To determine the approximate genome coverage of each of
the 12 phase I physical maps, we estimated the size of the
ordered consensus bands for each map in kilobases based on
the average insert size of each BAC library and the average
number of fingerprint bands observed for each species. Using
this estimation, the genome coverage of the phase I physical
maps ranged from 136% in O. granulata [GG] to 77% in O.
brachyantha [FF]. In total, 7 of the physical maps had coverages greater that 100% (O. nivara, O. rufipogon, O. glaberrima, O. minuta, O. alta, O. granulata, and O. ridleyi), 4 had
coverages between 98% and 87% (O. punctata, O. officinalis,
O. australiensis, and O. coarctata) and 1 had a coverage of
77% (O. brachyantha). Coverage discrepancies above or
below 100% could be due to a number of parameters, including: possible overlaps between the contigs that were not
merged by the criteria used in this study; inaccurate estimation of genome size; and over-estimation of average insert
sizes of the BAC libraries that would lead to an over-estimation of kilobases per consensus band (CB).

Alignment of phase I physical maps to the O. sativa
reference sequence
To evaluate the coverage of the phase I physical maps graphically, we aligned the BESs associated with each FPC contig to
the O. sativa reference sequence (RefSeq) [18] using SyMAP
[34]. SyMAP displays for all 12 physical maps can be viewed
at [35] (display details are in Additional data file 1) and are
summarized in Table 3 and Additional data file 2. Overall,
between 61% and 95% of the contigs from each of the phase I
physical maps could be aligned to the O. sativa RefSeq. Contigs not assigned a chromosomal position were generally
small (133-289 CB/contig) and had few clones per contig (338 clones/contig) (Table 3). The percentage of BESs aligned,
under identical parameters, was the least in O. alta [CCDD]
(8% alignment) and the greatest in the AA genome type species O. nivara (60% alignment). Interestingly, the FF (O.
brachyantha) and HHKK (O. coarctata) genome type species

showed substantially more alignments to the O. sativa RefSeq than more closely related species (CC, BBCC, CCDD, EE,
GG, and HHJJ).
Figure 1 shows a SyMAP alignment of chromosome 1 of the
eight diploid Oryza species to the O. sativa RefSeq as an
example. As expected, the most co-linear map alignments
were observed with species that were evolutionarily less
divergent (for example, AA, BB, CC). Regions of disrupted
colinearity were detected mostly in the centromeric regions of
the O. sativa genome. Although SyMAP alignments were also
performed for the four polyploid species, we cannot conclude
anything conclusive about their genome organization until
their physical maps can be manually subdivided into each of
their subgenomes.

Sequence analysis of the OMAP BES data set: repeats,
SSRs, miRNAs, and SNV
The large BES data set produced by this project offered a
unique opportunity to explore sequence content and variation across the Oryza. We next investigated repeat and SSR
content across all twelve species and identified miRNA content and SNV amongst the three AA and one BB genomes.

Repeats
RepeatMasker [36] in conjunction with a curated rice (O.
sativa) repeat database was used to identify and classify previously identified repetitive elements. RECON [37] was used
to identify repeats de novo. Results reported here relate to the
number of bases covered by each element class, rather than
the total number of members of each element class with the
exception of small transposable elements (that is, miniature
inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) and short

interspersed elements (SINEs)), as BES reads are too short to
span complete elements. The repeat content results ranged
from a high of 76% in O. australiensis [EE] to a low of 36% in
O. coarctata [HHKK] (Table 4). The repeats extracted by
RECON overlapped with those identified by RepeatMasker by
32% in O. coarctata [HHKK] to 74% in O. punctata [BB].
This is expected as the curated repeat library used for RepeatMasker is O. sativa [AA] specific and, therefore, more distantly related species would be expected to share fewer
repeats. Interestingly, the total repeat content of two CC
genome containing allotetraploid species (O. minuta [BBCC]
and O. alta [CCDD]) was less than the CC diploid genome of
O. officinalis. It was also observed that the highest amount of
unique or species-specific repetitive DNA was present in O.
australiensis [EE] (21% corresponding to 203 Mb) and the
lowest in O. granulata [GG] (10% corresponding to 92 Mb).
These sequences were compiled into species-specific repeat
databases.
The amount of repeats in each genome was directly proportional to the genome size except for O. granulata [GG] (Additional data file 3), suggesting that repetitive sequences play a
major role in genome size expansion in the genus Oryza. O.
australiensis [EE] had a high amount of repetitive DNA, consistent with the observation of a rapid burst of retrotransposons in this species [38].
We attempted to sub-classify the repetitive elements identified by their class. Only the results from the RepeatMasker
search were used for classification (Figure 2) as the de novo
repeats identified by RECON were mostly truncated. Retrotransposons (both long terminal repeats (LTRs) and nonLTRs) comprised the major fraction of the total repeats in all

species and ranged from 46% of the genome in O. australiensis [EE] to 9% in O. brachyantha [FF]. Among all types of retroelements, the Ty-3/gypsy elements were the most
predominant, followed by Ty-1/copia, LINEs and SINEs,
respectively. The second most abundant class was DNA (nonMITE) transposons consisting mainly of the cacta-En/Spm,
mutator, mariner, ping/pong/snoopy, hAT, and Ac/Ds elements, with En/Spm being the most predominant. These
non-MITE DNA transposons ranged from 7% of the genome
in O. ridleyi [HHJJ] to 2% in O. coarctata [HHKK]. An
exception to this trend was O. brachyantha [FF], which had
more MITEs (7%) than DNA (non-MITE) transposons (2%).
MITEs were the third most abundant elements in the genus
Oryza with the exception of O. brachyantha; MITEs ranged
from 0.9% of the genome in O. australiensis to 7% in O.
brachyantha. The three AA genome species, as well as O.
sativa, have approximately equal amounts of both DNA (nonMITE) transposons as well as MITEs, although with slight
differences. Since MITEs represent a large class of repeats
with many different types, we calculated the percentage of
different MITEs from the overall total as shown in Additional

data file 4. Some types of MITEs were more abundant than
others and also some were specific to a particular species - for
instance, the three AA genome species illustrated a similar
pattern for each element. Similarly, the distribution pattern
of the MITE elements to the classification of MITE types and
their proportion was more comparable among O. punctata
[BB], O. officinalis [CC], O. minuta [BBCC] and O. alta
[CCDD] genome species rather than those of the other
genomes. A similar pattern was also detected between O. ridleyi [HHJJ] and O. coarctata [HHKK] species. This result
indicates that the abundance and composition of the MITE
elements are closely related to genome type evolution in the
genus Oryza.
Analysis of O. alta [CCDD] revealed that approximately 9% of
the BESs were categorized as unclassified repeats, high relative to other 12 Oryza species (2% in O. minuta [BBCC] to
0.2% in O. coarctata [HHKK]), implying the existence of one
or more unique classes of repeats in O. alta or the presence of
highly diverged repeats that were recognized by our current
stringency parameters. On closer inspection, we identified a

copia type LTR retrotransposon in a fully sequenced BAC
(OA_BBa0237I11) representing a large family of retrotransposons that accounts for the majority of these unclassified
repeats. This element, considered in detail elsewhere [39],
accounted for two-thirds (2,939,525 bases of 4,392,322
bases) of these unclassified repeat sequences when assayed
using cross_match alone.

Simple sequence repeats

and tri-nucleotide SSRs were the most abundant, representing 48.6% and 26.7% of the total dataset, respectively. The
relative frequency of di-nucleotide SSRs in all the Oryza species was 6-7% higher than in the O. sativa reference genomes
(Table 5; Additional data file 5). In contrast, the relative frequency of tri-nucleotide SSRs was 4-5% lower than in the O.
sativa reference genomes and was inversely related to that of
the di-nucleotide repeats in each species (Additional data file
5).

SSRs are extremely useful for detecting variation between
species and generating molecular genetic maps. A total of
16,980 non-redundant SSRs were detected from the 1.45 million BESs analyzed, which equates to approximately 18 SSRs/
Mb of Oryza sequence. Overall, the AA and FF genome species (O. nivara [AA], O. rufipogon [AA], O. glaberrima [AA]
and O. brachyantha [FF]) showed the highest SSR content,
with an average of 27 SSRs/Mb, whereas the tetraploid (O.
minuta [BBCC], O. alta [CCDD], O. ridleyi [HHJJ] and O.
coarctata [HHKK]) and non-AA genome diploid species (O.
punctata [BB], O. officinalis [CC], O. australiensis [EE], and
O. granulata [GG]) showed 17.6 and 17.2 SSRs/Mb, respectively (Table 5). Among the 16,980 non-redundant SSRs, di-

The top ten predominant motifs from the five most frequent
SSRs in each species comprised between 68% (O. sativa ssp.
japonica) and 80% (O. granulata) of all the SSRs identified
(Figure 3). The TA, GA and CGG motifs were the most abundant and accounted for a total of 51% (30%, 15%, and 6%,
respectively) of all the Oryza SSRs. Interestingly, two SSR
motifs showed biased compositions in a species-specific manner. The TAA and CAA motifs were significantly higher in O.
ridleyi (9.6% for TAA, 13% for CAA) and O. granulata (9% for
CAA) compared to the average (4.2% and 3%, respectively)
for all Oryza species (Figure 3). Further investigation using
the rice repeats revealed that 137 of 235 BESs (58%) contain-

ing the TAA motif in O. ridleyi were associated with an
uncharacterized LTR retrotransposon (Additional data file
6a). We failed to detect the known interspersed rice repeats in
BESs containing the CAA repeat, but a BLAST search against
O. granulata and O. ridleyi BESs revealed that more than
76% of total CAA-BESs in both species hit other BESs more
than 50 times. This suggests the amplification of certain
repeat elements contributed to increase the TAA and CAA
repeats in both species (Additional data file 6b).
The di-nucleotide SSRs showed the longest tracks of repeats,
with an average of 44.5 ± 45.2 bp in the OMAP SSRs (Table
6). The TA repeat class showed the most variable repeat
length among SSRs analyzed, with an average of 53.3 ± 55 bp
(Additional data file 7). O. coarctata showed the least variable
TA repeat length (31 ± 22.8 bp) and O. rufipogon showed the
most variable length (73.8 ± 92.1 bp) in the Oryza species. We

observed that the length of tri-nucleotide SSRs was inversely
related to the G/C composition of their motifs (Additional
data file 7). G/C rich motifs (CGA, CAG, CGG, TGG and GGA)
revealed a shorter repeat length, with an average of 24.6 bp ±
4.5 bp in OMAP SSRs. The same trend was detected in
japonica (24.9 ± 5.6 bp) and indica (24.8 ± 5.6 bp). However,
A/T rich tri-nucleotide repeats (CAA, CAT, TAG, GAA and
TAA) showed relatively longer tracks of repeats, with a length
of 33.6 ± 18.2 bp in OMAP SSRs, 42.3 ± 30.1 bp in japonica,
and 40.2 ± 25.9 bp in indica.

scores of neighboring regions to exclude variations that were
due to possible sequencing error.

In total, 64 paralogous miRNA precursors of O. sativa
belonging to 22 miRNA families were identified among the
four Oryza species (Table 7). O. rufipogon showed the
highest number of conserved O. sativa miRNAs while O.
punctata showed the lowest (22 and 7, respectively). This is
consistent with our expectations since, as the evolutionary
distance among species increases, the divergence within the
miRNA precursor structure also increases [44]. The miRNA
families of miR166 and miR171, known to play a key role in
apical meristem development, were detected in all four species; the highest number of copies of each was 9 and 7, respectively. Both of these miRNAs are known to be widely shared
among plant lineages. In addition, four unknown locus miRNAs (miR420, miRNA441, miR442, and miR446) appeared
to be AA genome specific.

Our initial data set contained 330,993 high quality BESs
(73,716 from O. rufipogon, 110,589 from O. nivara, 73,344
from O. glaberrima and 73,344 from O. punctata). Since two
assemblies of the O. sativa ssp. japonica RefSeq
(International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) V.4
and The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) V.4) were
available, we detected variations on both assemblies using a
quality score cutoff of 23. We were able to accurately map
217,202 BESs (53,426 from O. rufipogon, 76,886 from O.
nivara, 50,736 from O. glaberrima, and 36,154 from O.
punctata) to the IRGSP V.4 assembly and 217,258 BESs
(53,273 from O. rufipogon, 76,833 from O. nivara, 50,833
from O. glaberrima, and 36,319 from O. punctata) to the
TIGR V.4 assembly. A total of 1,619,446 non-redundant SNVs
(Additional data file 8a) and 319,974 insertions and deletions
(INDELs; Additional data file 8b) were detected between the
BESs from the four Oryza species (O. rufipogon, O. nivara,
O. glaberrima, and O. punctata) and the O. sativa genome
assembly from IRGSP V.4. Likewise 1,619,557 SNVs (Additional data file 8c) and 320,592 INDELs (Additional data file
8d) were detected on the TIGR V.4 assembly. The overall
divergence rate was found to be 1.22%, 1.32%, 1.59% and
7.15% for O. rufipogon, O. nivara, O. glaberrima and O.

Variation discovery in four wild rice species and O. sativa
Candidate SNVs between wild rice BESs and the O. sativa
genome were detected with a multi-tiered alignment strategy
[45] using BLASTZ [46] and cross_match followed by a baseby-base analysis of the resulting high quality alignment (see
Materials and methods). Putative nucleotide variations were
further filtered using sequence quality scores and quality

12.2, 13.2, 15.9 and 71.5 SNVs/kb and 1.5, 1.6, 2.0 and 11.4
INDELs/kb for O. rufipogon, O. nivara, O. glaberrima and
O. punctata, respectively. In comparison, the polymorphism
rate reported by the Beijing Genomics Institute [47] between
the indica and japonica cultivars of O. sativa was 1.70 SNPs/

kb and 0.11 INDELs/kb [48]. Therefore, the rate of variation
between Oryza species is roughly an order of magnitude
greater than the polymorphism rate within species, as we
would expect. The variation data are available through dbSNP
and Gramene [49]. An example view of the variation data in
Gramene is shown in Additional data file 9.

Discussion

We describe here the generation and analysis of a comparative genomics resource for the genus Oryza that can be used
as a research platform to address grand challenge questions
in basic and applied biology. The primary resources developed were 1,452,912 BESs, 710,536 fingerprints, 12 phase I
physical maps aligned to the rice RefSeq, and repeat, SSR,
miRNA and SNV analyses. All sequences and variations have
been deposited in GenBank and dbSNP, and all physical maps
can be visualized using SyMAP [34] and CMAP at the OMAP
[50] and Gramene [49] websites, respectively. The BAC
libraries, BESs, SNaPshot fingerprints, and phase I physical
maps have been publicly available since January 2006 and
have been extensively accessed by the international community [31,38,51-56].
Estimates of genome coverage of the physical maps relative to
flow cytometry data were quite close except for O. granulate.
To make the Oryza physical maps more useful for future
research, they must now be manually edited to merge contigs
and resolve any conflicts and mis-assemblies, as was done for

O. punctata [BB] [31]. Manual editing will be particularly
challenging for the four allotetraploid species, where contigs
need to be assigned to one of two subgenomes for each species. Fortunately for two tetraploids, O. minuta [BBCC] and
O. alta [CCDD], we can use BES information from their diploid progenitors to assist in this process.
The BES data set represents an unprecedented sampling of
genomic sequence from the Oryza. This resource is enhanced
by the fact that the majority of BESs are binned in FPC contigs
where 6-60% of BESs (depending on species) can be mapped
to the rice RefSeq, and approximately 95% are paired. Here,
we mined the BES data set for repeat, SSR, miRNA and SNV
content. Repetitive sequences, especially transposable elements, are major components of plant genomes and contribute significantly to genome size variation. Detailed analysis of
the BES resource for O. australiensis [EE] and O. granulata
[GG] BESs have already demonstrated that retrotranspositional bursts of RIRE2, Wallaby and Kangaroo in the EE
genome [38] and Gran3 in the GG genome [51] account for
50% and 25% of the genome sizes of these species, respec-

tively. The RECON data described here for O. alta [CCDD]
may likely represent yet a third retrotransposon burst
accounting for genome size variation, subsequent to speciation [39].
Further analysis of the Oryza BES data identified 16,980 and
1,619,446 non-redundant SSRs and SNVs, respectively. The
SSRs and SNVs can be immediately translated into polymorphic markers for breeding crosses between the two sequenced
O. sativa genomes with the AA genome OMAP accessions to
accelerate crop improvement. Further, the SSRs will serve as
candidates to identify polymorphic genetic makers for
intraspecific Oryza mapping populations currently under
development (for example, BB × BB; CC × CC, and so on). The
availability of molecular genetic maps tied to our physical
maps for all 12 accessions will make these resources even
stronger for functional and map-based cloning applications.
Paired-end data are also extremely important for studying
structural variation, such as expansions, contractions, inversions and translocations [57,58]. Using our paired BES database, we plan to catalogue all such variation across the Oryza
in order to address fundamental questions on the roles of
such variation on the speciation process.
To our knowledge, the combined resources described herein
comprise the most comprehensive within-genus comparative
genomics framework available for any higher eukaryote,
exceeded only by Drosophila, for which 12 draft genome
sequences of wild flies are available [16]. We envisage that the
OMAP system will be a model for other within-genus
comparative frameworks, including large genome plant genera like Gossypium (cotton), Solanum (tomato), Zea (corn)
and Phaseolus (soybean). Having physical map frameworks
for all genome types of a particular genus aligned to a reference genome provides immediate access to any orthologous
or unique region of a genome(s) for functional and evolutionary analysis. Such frameworks are also highly compatible
with next generation sequencing technologies whereby whole
genomes can be sequenced in 4-8 Mb chunks, thereby reducing assemblies to the size of a bacterial genome [59].

colinearity to the O. sativa RefSeq. We analyzed the BES for
repeats, SSRs, miRNA and SNVs. The repeat analysis not only
cataloged the repeat content of each species, it suggested the
possible roll they have played on genome size variation during the course of evolution. The SSR analysis identified
16,908 non-redundant SSRs from OMAP BESs, providing 18
SSRs/Mb of SSR density in the Oryza. We also found that the
amplification of certain repeat elements contributed to an
increase of the TAA and CAA motif repeats in the O. granulata [GG] and O. ridleyi [HHJJ] genomes. A total of 1,619,446
non-redundant SNVs and 319,974 insertions and deletions
(INDELs) were detected between the BESs from four Oryza
species (O. rufipogon, O. nivara, O. glaberrima, and O.
punctata) and the O. sativa RefSeq. The SSR, SNV and
INDEL markers can be immediately used for marker assistant selection as well as evolutionary studies. The miRNA
analysis identified 64 paralogous miRNA precursors of O.
sativa with more conservation in evolutionarily closer
species. In addition, we observed species-wide miRNA families (miR166 and miR171) and AA genome specific miRNAs
(miR420, miRNA441, miR442, and miR446).
All biological reagents are available at the AGI BAC/EST
Resource Center [60] and all fingerprints and BESs are available at [49,50] and GenBank. We envision that the resources
and analysis presented here will serve as a model for the
establishment of similar genus-wide frameworks for plants
and animals. The genus-wide physical framework also fits in
well with next generation sequencing technologies where an
entire genome or targeted regions across a genus can be
reduced to bacterial genome size chunks that can be easily
sequenced and assembled as opposed to a whole genome
sequencing approach.

FPC map alignment to the O. sativa RefSeq

Conclusion

The development and analysis of genus-wide research platforms is the next frontier in comparative systems biology. The
genus Oryza, which includes the world's most important
cereal, rice, is composed of 24 species (2 domesticated and 22
wild) with wide geographical distribution and contains 10 distinct genome types (6 diploid (2N = 24) and 4 polyploid (2N
= 48)) and a 3.6-fold genome size variation (357-1,283 Mb).
We generated BAC-based physical maps of 12 Oryza species
representing all the 10 genome types and aligned them to the
O. sativa RefSeq. The 12 physical maps covered between 77%
and 136% of each Oryza genome and revealed extensive

SyMAP [34] was used for alignment and display of FPC contigs from each of the 12 phase I physical maps to the O. sativa
RefSeq (IRGSP V.4). Briefly, the 12 BES data sets were
repeat-masked [36] and then searched for sequence similarity to the rice genome using BLAT [61]. To capture weaker
sequence similarities from the more divergent species, BLAT
parameters were adjusted as follows (-minIdentity = 70 -tileSize = 10 -minScore = 30 -qMask = lower -maxIntron =
10,000). BLAT results were filtered, to reduce false-positives,
by retaining the top two hits for each query, as measured by
match length, and subject to the additional criteria that no
retained hit had a match length within 25% of a discarded hit.
Approximate linear chains were computed from the retained
hits using dynamic programming and then merged to form

synteny blocks that were displayed by SyMAP. After the
Oryza BESs were positioned on the O. sativa RefSeq, contigs
containing the aligned BESs were anchored to the chromosomes and then renumbered in FPC. Contigs that aligned to
less than 200 bp of O. sativa RefSeq were ignored in the
alignment analysis (Table 3). All 12 SyMAP alignment results
are available at [35].

Synteny analysis pipeline and incorporation of data in
the CMap, Genome Browser and SyntenyView displays
in Gramene
We constructed a pipeline to align clones and contigs from the
OMAP species to O. sativa by combining data from the BES
alignments to O. sativa and the phase I physical maps. The
pipeline consisted of 6 steps: 1) upload phase I physical maps
and BES data, 2) align BES to the RefSeq, 3) determine the
best alignments for each clone, 4) assemble the clone positions to determine the region where the contig is found to
align, 5) create blocks of synteny between selected OMAP species and O. sativa, 6) utilize the data to create visualizations
in CMap, the Genome Browser, and SyntenyView in
Gramene. Details on each step can be found at [62] Screen
shots of the data in Gramene are shown in Additional data file
9.

Repeat analysis
RepeatMasker (V3.1.5), loaded with a custom Oryza repeat
database, was used to identify repeats from the Oryza BES
data set and the O. sativa RefSeq. The custom database was
composed of annotated repeats from: TIGR rice repeat
database [63]; Dr Susan Wessler (University of Georgia,
USA); and Dr Tom Bureau (McGill University, Canada).
RECON [37] was used to identify de novo repeats from the
Oryza BES data set. To increase the speed and efficiency of
the program, the BLAST output was parsed to discard self hits
as well as hits with an e-value greater than 1e-5. The RECON
output, which identified repetitive elements and classified
them into distinct families, was parsed for sequences greater
than 40 bp in length that were found at least 5 times/family.
Overlap between the de novo and the custom library was
determined using RepeatMasker. Sequences left unmasked
by this process and, thus, were not a part of our custom repeat
database, were extracted, assembled using PHRAP [64] and
annotated using BLASTN at an e-value = 1e-4 against the
NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database [65] and a dataset
of 2,050 full length LTR-retrotransposons identified from the
whole genome sequence of Nipponbare through LTR_STRUC
[66]. Finally, these sequences were compiled into repeat databases specific to each species. The procedure is outlined in
Additional data file 10.

Simple sequence repeat analysis
A total of 20,064 SSRs were identified from 1,452,912 BESs
using RepeatMasker (V3.1.5) with a cutoff of longer than 20
bp and less than 5% sequence divergence. BESs containing

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R45

Kim et al. R45.12

SSRs (SSR-BES) were assembled for each species using CAP3
[67] to collect a total of 16,980 non-redundant SSRs. An SSR
was considered redundant when the BAC clones came from
the same FPC contig, and an assembled CAP contig contained
the same SSR motif, repeat length and sequence divergence.
Abundance and relative frequency of SSRs from the Oryza
BESs were compared to SSRs identified from two rice
genomic sequences: 20,653 SSRs from the japonica RefSeq
[18] and 19,370 from the indica draft [68,69] sequences using
identical criteria. Other interspersed repeats in SSR-BESs
were detected using RepeatMasker with a custom repeat
database (courtesy of Dr Ning Jiang, Michigan State
University).

Identification of Oryza miRNA genes
O.sativa japonica miRNA precursors from miRBase (Version
8.2) [70], including 250 nucleotides upstream and downstream, were extracted from the O. sativa RefSeq [18] and
aligned, using BLASTN [71], against BES of four closely
related wild rice species (AA and BB genomes). Alignments
were filtered and multiple hits to the same region of a BES
were discarded, keeping the hit with the lowest e-value. The
best orthologous match typically had more conservation in
the region surrounding the precursor and, therefore, had a
much lower e-value. If two miRNAs aligned to different
regions of the same BES, they were not discarded, since they
were likely to be tandemly duplicated miRNA genes. To
obtain the exact coordinates and secondary structure of the
miRNA precursor within the remaining BES, a pattern
matching approach was used to align the mature miRNA precursor to the BES. Once the mature miRNA was mapped to
the BES, the extended sequence was then submitted to MFold
to determine if it could form a stable hairpin structure [72].
MFold alignments were checked for the following criteria:
had conserved orientation; contained fewer than eight
mismatches; was not overlapping the loop region; and lacked
some types of asymmetric bulges. A precursor was discarded
if the bulge had four or more nucleotides that failed to match
with any nucleotide from the opposite strand. A precursor
was retained if a bulge of four or fewer nucleotides on one
stem corresponded, although not necessarily matching, with
one or more nucleotides on the opposite strand. If the
sequence that aligned to the mature miRNA met these criteria, it was categorized as the opposing stem (miRNA*). Both
stems and the intervening loop region were extracted and
resubmitted as input to MFold. If this refined sequence
formed a stable hairpin structure under the four conditions, it
was categorized as a paralogous miRNA precursor.

Variation discovery
BES trace files from O. rufipogon, O. nivara, O. glaberrima
and O. punctata were compared to the O. sativa genome with
BLASTZ [46] using the S1-S2 scoring method to select only
the best alignment for each read. Each chromosome was then
divided into 5 Mb segments and BESs aligned to each region
from the previous step were re-aligned to the segment using

cross_match [64] (-bandwidth 100 -alignments discrep_lists) with variation filtering using the neighborhood
quality standard (NQS) [73]. Settings for NQS were such that
candidate variation in the read had a Phred quality value (Q)
of at least 23, its neighboring 7 bases on either side of the candidate variation all had Phred quality values of ≥ 15 and at
least 11 of the 14 neighbors matched. If a read aligned to more
than one place in the genome, then only the longest alignment
with the fewest SNVs was reported. To decrease the number
of false positive insertions or deletions, variations were filtered out if they had a single base variation and the quality
score was less than 40 or if they were multiple base variations
and the quality score was less than 23. Since two assemblies
of the O. sativa RefSeq were available (IRGSP V.4 and TIGR
V.4), variations were detected using both assemblies (Additional data file 8a-d). All data have been deposited into
dbSNP and can be viewed at Gramene [49].
