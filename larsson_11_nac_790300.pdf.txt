Background
In most gymnosperms the cotyledons develop as a
crown surrounding the incipient shoot apical meristem
(SAM), which maintains the radial symmetry of the
plant throughout embryogenesis. This is in contrast to
the Arabidopsis embryo in which a symmetry-breaking
event (from radial to bilateral symmetry) is associated
with the emergence of the SAM and the two cotyledons
[1]. We have previously shown that the differentiation
of cotyledons and the establishment of the SAM and the
root apical meristem (RAM) in somatic embryos of Norway spruce (Picea abies) is dependent on polar auxin
transport (PAT) [2]. In Arabidopsis PAT restricts the
expression of several genes belonging to the large plant
specific NAC family of transcription factors [3-5], which
in turn induce developmental processes involved in
booth shoot and root formation. Members of the NAC
family have a conserved DNA-binding domain in the Nterminal region known as the NAC domain, and a more
diverse domain in the C-terminal region, proposed to be
responsible for the trans-activation capacity of the protein [6]. Despite the diversity of the NAC gene family,
and the importance of NAC proteins in fundamental
processes, no NAC genes have to our knowledge been
characterized in conifers.
Methods
Phylogenetic analyses of NAC domain containing genes
from Picea glauca, Arabidopsisthaliana, Medicago truncatula and Physcomitrella patens were performed using
PAUP* and MrBayes. Full-length cDNAs of two NAC
genes were isolated from maturing somatic embryos of
Norway spruce and cloned using standard protocols.
The promoters were amplified using the Genome

Walker™ kit (Clontech). The motif discovery tool
MEME was used to find conserved motifs in the Cterminal regions and in the promoters of the NAC
sequences from different species. The expression pattern
of the two isolated NAC genes was analyzed in Norway
spruce somatic embryos using quantitative real-time
PCR. Their expression was also analyzed in embryos
that had been treated with the PAT inhibitor NPA as
described earlier [2]. Promoter::GUS fusions were
inserted into embryogenic cultures of Norway spruce
using Agrobacterium mediated transformation.

Results and discussion
We identified several different NAC sequences from
white spruce in GenBank and deployed them to different sub-clades within the NAC gene family. Two fulllength cDNAs (gene 1 and gene 2) were cloned from
Norway spruce. Both genes have elements in their promoter region which are significant for specific NAC
genes. Furthermore, gene 1 harbors previously characterized motifs that have been shown to have functional
importance in NAC genes in Arabidopsis.
The relative expression of gene 1 increased as early
embryos differentiated, and remained at a high level
until separated cotyledons were clearly visible. However,
the up-regulation was blocked in embryos that formed
fused cotyledons and lacked distinct SAM and RAM
after being treated with NPA. The relative expression of
gene 2 was high in proembryogenic masses and early
differentiating embryos but decreased as the embryos
developed and matured. Interestingly the down-regulation occurred at about the same time as the cotyledons
were delineated. The expression of gene 2 was not
dependent on PAT. Spatial expression analysis using
promoter::GUS fusions revealed that the spruce genes
have specific expression patterns, distinct from the

expression patterns of their most closely related Arabidopsis counterparts.

Conclusion
Taken together, our results show that NAC genes with
distinct signature motifs existed before the separation of
angiosperms and gymnosperms approximately 300 million years ago. However, through evolution the expression of closely related genes has diversified leading to
induction of distinct developmental programs in angiosperms and gymnosperms.
