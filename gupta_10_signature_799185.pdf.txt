Signature proteins for the major clades of
Cyanobacteria
Radhey S Gupta*, Divya W Mathews

Abstract
Background: The phylogeny and taxonomy of cyanobacteria is currently poorly understood due to paucity of
reliable markers for identification and circumscription of its major clades.
Results: A combination of phylogenomic and protein signature based approaches was used to characterize the
major clades of cyanobacteria. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for 44 cyanobacteria based on 44 conserved
proteins. In parallel, Blastp searches were carried out on each ORF in the genomes of Synechococcus WH8102,
Synechocystis PCC6803, Nostoc PCC7120, Synechococcus JA-3-3Ab, Prochlorococcus MIT9215 and Prochlor. marinus
subsp. marinus CCMP1375 to identify proteins that are specific for various main clades of cyanobacteria. These
studies have identified 39 proteins that are specific for all (or most) cyanobacteria and large numbers of proteins
for other cyanobacterial clades. The identified signature proteins include: (i) 14 proteins for a deep branching clade
(Clade A) of Gloebacter violaceus and two diazotrophic Synechococcus strains (JA-3-3Ab and JA2-3-B’a); (ii) 5 proteins
that are present in all other cyanobacteria except those from Clade A; (iii) 60 proteins that are specific for a clade
(Clade C) consisting of various marine unicellular cyanobacteria (viz. Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus); (iv) 14 and
19 signature proteins that are specific for the Clade C Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus strains, respectively; (v) 67
proteins that are specific for the Low B/A ecotype Prochlorococcus strains, containing lower ratio of chl b/a2 and
adapted to growth at high light intensities; (vi) 65 and 8 proteins that are specific for the Nostocales and
Chroococcales orders, respectively; and (vii) 22 and 9 proteins that are uniquely shared by various Nostocales and
Oscillatoriales orders, or by these two orders and the Chroococcales, respectively. We also describe 3 conserved
indels in flavoprotein, heme oxygenase and protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase proteins that are specific for either
Clade C cyanobacteria or for various subclades of Prochlorococcus. Many other conserved indels for cyanobacterial
clades have been described recently.
Conclusions: These signature proteins and indels provide novel means for circumscription of various
cyanobacterial clades in clear molecular terms. Their functional studies should lead to discovery of novel properties
that are unique to these groups of cyanobacteria.

Background
Cyanobacteria are the sole prokaryotic group that carries
out oxygenic photosynthesis. The species from this phylum exhibit enormous diversity in terms of their morphology, physiology and other characteristics (e.g.
motility, thermophily, cell division characteristic, nitrogen fixation ability, etc.) [1-5]. The taxonomy and evolutionary relationships among cyanobacteria is presently
poorly understood. In the 16S rRNA trees, which provides the current basis for understanding microbial

phylogeny, cyanobacteria species/strains form 14 unresolved clusters [6]. Although cyanobacteria is a large
phylum with >4000 isolates [7], only a small number of
species and higher taxonomic groups within this phylum
have been validly described [8-10]. Except for 16S
rRNA, sequence information for cyanobacteria for other
genes/proteins sequences until recently was very limited.
Hence, the availability of genome sequences has provided new opportunities for understanding cyanobacterial phylogeny and taxonomy. Based upon these
sequences, several investigators have assembled phylogenetic trees for cyanobacteria based upon combined
sequences for different large sets of proteins. These

studies have included analyses of 14 cyanobacteria based
upon 34 proteins by Sanchez-Barcaldo et al. [4], trees
for 24 cyanobacteria based upon 583 orthologous proteins by Swingley et al. [11], and branching patterns of
13 cyanobacteria based upon 682 proteins by Shi and
Falkowski [12]. Additionally, Zhaxybayeva et al. [13]
have examined individual phylogenies of 1128 proteincoding genes from 11 cyanobacterial genomes to identify phylogenetic signal exhibited by the plurality of
these proteins and to recognize the incidence of lateral
gene transfers. These studies have proven very useful in
establishing the existence of certain important clades
within the sequenced cyanobacteria and in clarifying
their relative branching positions [4,11,12].
The studies of the above kind, although very useful,
are limited to species whose genomes are sequenced.
Further, as indicated by earlier work [4,11,12], integration of sequence information from any new genome by
this approach requires reassembly of the entire phylogenomic tree(s). Based upon the phylogenomic approach it
is also difficult to circumscribe various cyanobacterial
clades in definitive biochemical or molecular terms,
which is important for developing a stable taxonomy
[14-16]. Hence, it is important to identify other reliable
molecular markers that are consistent with the results of
phylogenomic studies, but which can also be used to circumscribe different phylogenetic clades in more definitive (molecular) terms. One approach that has proven
very useful in this regard consists of identifying molecular markers or synapomorphies that are specific for different phylogenetically defined clades. Two different
kinds of molecular markers are proving very useful for
these studies. The first of these consists of conserved
inserts and deletions (indels) in widely distributed proteins that are distinctive characteristics of either a given
phylum or its different main subgroups [17-21]. Our
recent work has identified >40 conserved indels in
important proteins that are exclusively present in either
all cyanobacteria or many of its major clades that are
observed in phylogenomic trees [22,23]. The presence of
several of these indels in the plants/plastids homologs
has also provided evidence for the derivation of plastids
from cyanobacterial ancestors [22-24]. The second kind
of molecular markers consists of whole proteins that are
uniquely found in various species from a given phylogenetic clade [25-28]. Martin et al. [29] have earlier
reported Blast analysis on 8 cyanobacterial genomes (6
finished and 2 unfinished) to identify 181 proteins that
were uniquely found in at least 7 out of 8 of these cyanobacteria. A later study by Mulkidjanian et al. [30] on
15 cyanobacterial genomes identified 50 proteins that
were uniquely present in at least 14 out of 15 cyanobacteria and 84 others that were exclusively present in
plants/plastids and cyanobacteria.

These earlier studies primarily looked for proteins that
were uniquely found in most cyanobacteria and no work
was carried out on identifying proteins that are specific
for various main clades of cyanobacteria, observed in
phylogenetic trees. In the past 2-3 years, the number of
sequenced cyanobacterial genomes has also more than
doubled to a total of 36 genomes. Hence, it was of
much interest to carry out both phylogenomic as well as
gene content analyses on these genomes to identify signature proteins that are distinctive characteristics of
either all cyanobacteria or its various main clades in the
phylogenomic trees.

Results
Phylogenomic/phylogenetic analyses on Cyanobacteria

Prior to undertaking studies on identifying proteins that
are specific for different cyanobacterial clades, it was
necessary to determine the branching pattern of
sequenced cyanobacteria in phylogenetic trees. Although
detailed phylogenetic studies have been previously
reported for a limited numbers of cyanobacteria
[4,11,12], sequence information for many other genomes
has become available in the past 2-3 years (see Table 1).
Hence, it was necessary to carry out phylogenetic studies on all of these cyanobacteria to determine their
branching pattern. The phylogenetic trees are now commonly constructed based on concatenated sequences for
large number of proteins [4,11,12,31]. Their main
advantage is that because they are based on large numbers of characters derived from many independent proteins, they are generally considered to provide a better
reflection of organismal phylogeny than trees based on
any single gene or protein, where the observed relationship could be affected by various factors including lateral gene transfer, differences in evolutionary rates
among species, long branch attraction effect, etc. [32].
However, it should be recognized that the trees based
on concatenated sequences, due to the possibility of
their lumping together gene sequences with discordant
evolutionary histories, can sometime result in unreliable
inferences [32-34]. In the present work, phylogenetic
trees were constructed based on a combined sequence
alignment for 44 widely distributed proteins (see additional file 1) from 44 cyanobacterial species/isolates for
which sequence information was available (see Materials
and Methods). Most of these proteins carry out important housekeeping functions, and they are universally
present in various species [35], making them a good
choice for phylogenetic analysis.
A rooted maximum likelihood (ML) distance tree
based on the combined sequences for these proteins is
shown in Fig. 1 and a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree for
the same dataset is provided as additional file 2. A number of distinct clades of cyanobacteria were observed in

both these trees. Very similar branching patterns and
the grouping of cyanobacterial species in various clades
have been observed in earlier studies based on other
large and independent datasets of protein sequences
[4,11,12], giving confidence in the observed results. One
of the observed clades, referred to here as Clade A, consists of Gloebacter violaceus and Synechococcus sps. (JA3-3Ab and JA2-3-B’a). The ML and NJ tree differ from
each other in the branching position of this clade. In
the ML tree, the Clade A species/strains formed the
deepest branching lineage within cyanobacteria. In contrast, in the NJ tree, the cyanobacteria were divided into
two main clades at the deepest level and the Clade A
formed the outermost branch of one of these clades,

separated from all other species/strains by a long branch
(additional file 2). However, the branching of Clade A in
this position is not reliable, as in our recent studies
based on the same dataset of protein sequences but
with smaller numbers of cyanobacteria, the clade A species/strains branched in the same position as seen here
in the ML tree [23]. The deep branching of Clade A
species/strains has also been observed in a number of
earlier studies based on different datasets of protein
sequences [4,6,11,12,23,36-39]. Further strong and independent evidence that the Clade A species/strains constitutes the earliest branching lineage within sequenced
cyanobacteria is provided by our recent identification of
several conserved indels in broadly distributed proteins

(viz. 18 aa insert in DNA polymerase I, 4-5 aa insert in
the tryptophan synthase beta chain, 4 aa insert in tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase and a 2 aa insert in the DNA
polymerase III) [23]. The indicated conserved inserts in
these proteins are commonly shared by all other
sequenced cyanobacteria, but they are lacking in Clade
A as well as all other phyla of bacteria [23]. The species
distributions of these conserved indels strongly indicate
that these synapomorphies were introduced in a common ancestor of various other cyanobacteria after the
branching of Clade A. In a recent proposal for the classification of cyanobacteria, the thylakoids lacking Gloebacterales are placed into a separate subclass
(Gloebacterophycidae) [15]. It is unclear whether the
Synechococcus sps. (JA-3-3Ab and JA2-3-B’a), which
group with G. violaceus, also lack thylakoids or not.
Most other cyanobacteria could be grouped into two
main clades in these trees. One of these clades (designated here as Clade B) is comprised of diverse cyanobacteria including Thermosynechococcus, Acaryochloris,
as well as other cyanobacterial groups such as Chroococcales (Synechocystis/Crocosphaera/Microcystis/Cyanothece), Nostocales (Nostoc/Nodularia/Anabaena) and
Oscillatoriales (Trichodesmium/Lynbya)[15]. Within
Clade B, a subclade comprising of the Chroococcales,
Nostocales and Oscillatoriales is also observed in both
ML and NJ trees (Fig. 1 and additional file 2). The other
main clade (clade C) is composed entirely of different
strains/isolates of marine unicellular Prochlorococcus
and Synechococcus cyanobacteria. This latter clade has
been referred to as the Syn/Pro clade [4] and it corresponds to the subclass Synechococcophycidae in the
proposal by Hoffman et al. [15]. Within clade C, different Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus strains/isolates
were not completely separated from each other. In particular, two of the Prochlorococcus strains, MIT 9303 and
MIT 9313, branched within the Synechoccous strains/
isolates, in both ML and NJ trees (Fig. 1 and additional
file 2). Similar polyphyletic branching of these strains
has been observed in earlier studies [12,23]. However, in
both these trees, one subclade of Prochlorococcus strains,
which is referred to as the low B/A ecotype subgroup
[40,41], was separated from all others Prochlorococcus
strains by a long-branch. The branching position of the
freshwater unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus
elongatus (strains PCC 6301 and PCC 7942), although it
appeared as a deep branching lineage of Clade C, was
uncertain in these trees (discussed later).
Signature proteins for Cyanobacteria and its major
subgroups

These phylogenetic trees provide a framework for identifying proteins that are specific for either all cyanobacteria or their different well-resolved clades. Based upon
earlier studies, within any given group of bacteria or

Page 4 of 20

organisms, signature proteins are present at various phylogenetic depths [25,27,28,42-44]. Hence, to identify
proteins that are specific for different main clades of
cyanobacteria, Blastp searches were carried out on each
ORF in the genomes of the following 6 cyanobacteria:
Synechococcus sp. WH8102, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803,
Nostoc sp. PCC7120, Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab, Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9215 and Pro. marinus subsp. marinus str. CCMP1375. These cyanobacteria are present at
the tips of various clades in phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1
and additional file 2). Hence, blast searches with the
proteins in them should enable us to identify proteins
that are specific for various main clades of cyanobacteria
at different phylogenetic depths. The results of these
studies are summarized below.
Signature proteins that are specific for Cyanobacteria

Blast searches on the above genomes have identified 39
proteins that are specific for cyanobacteria and which
are present in virtually all of the sequenced genomes
(Table 2a). Thirty-three of these proteins are present in
all sequenced cyanobacteria (Table 2a) whereas the
remaining 6 (marked with *) are missing in 1-2 isolated
species/strains. The homologs of some of these proteins
are also found in a few algae or plants. Because of their
specific presence in practically all cyanobacteria, but
generally no other bacteria, these proteins could be
regarded as the cyanobacterial signature proteins. The
number of cyanobacterial signature proteins identified
in the present work is much smaller than those reported
in earlier studies [29,30]. However, this difference is
mainly due to the large increase in the number of
sequenced cyanobacterial as well as other genomes in
the past few years. In earlier work, we have also
described 15 conserved indels in broadly distributed
proteins that are distinctive characteristics of all available cyanobacteria and which are not found in any
other bacterial groups/phyla [22,23].
These analyses have also identified 5 proteins whose
homologs are present in all other cyanobacteria, except
those from Clade A (Table 2b). Based upon solely the
genomic distributions of these proteins, it is difficult to
interpret whether the genes for these proteins first
evolved in a common ancestor of all cyanobacteria followed by their loss in Clade A species/strains, or they
originally evolved in a common ancestor of the Clade B
and C cyanobacteria after the branching of Clade A.
However, based upon the results of phylogenomic analyses, and more importantly the species distribution patterns of several conserved indels in widely distributed
proteins that provide evidence that the Clade A is
ancestral to other cyanobacteria [23], the most parsimonious explanation for the observed distribution of these
genes is that they first evolved in a common ancestor of
the Clade B and C cyanobacteria, as indicated in Fig. 2.

Figure 1 A maximum-likelihood distance tree for sequenced cyanobacteria based on concatenated sequences for 44 conserved
proteins. The distance scale (bar = 0.1 substitutions per site) is shown in the top right hand corner. The tree was rooted using B. subtilis and S.
aureus sequences. The numbers at the nodes indicate % of puzzling quartets supporting various nodes. The low B/A ecotype clade refers to the
Prochlorococcus spp. containing lower ratio of chlorophyll b/a2 that are adapted to growth at high light intensities.

Table 2c lists 13 other proteins for which high scoring
homologs are present in all (or most) cyanobacteria
from Clades A and B, but which are lacking in Clade C
strains/isolates. Because of the deep branching of Clade
A, it is likely that the genes for these proteins also first
evolved in a common ancestor of cyanobacteria, followed by their loss in an ancestor of Clade C. The alternate possibility that the Clade A and B cyanobacteria
shared a common ancestor exclusive of Clade C is not
supported by the species distribution pattern of conserved indels in several proteins, as noted above. Blast

searches with proteins in the genome of Synechococcus
sp. JA-3-3Ab have also identified 14 proteins that are
specific for the Clade A cyanobacteria (additional file 3).
The Clade A species/strains can also be distinguished
from other cyanobacteria based upon a 15 aa conserved
insert in the protein synthesis elongation factor-G that
is specific for this clade [23].
Signature proteins for the Clade B cyanobacteria

Fig. 1). This clade as defined in our work includes all of
the species/strains from the orders Chroococcales, Nostocales and Oscillatoriales as well as the deeper branching
cyanobacteria, A. marina and Thermosyn. elongatus. Of
these latter cyanobacteria, Acaryochloris is unique in
containing chlorophyll d as its primary photosynthetic
pigment [45], whereas Thermosynechococcus is a unicellular thermophilic cyanobacterium [46]. Our analyses
have identified 38 proteins that are uniquely shared by
all or most of the species/strains from this clade. Two
of the Synechococcus strains viz. PCC7002 and

PCC7335, also consistently appeared in this group and
of these Synechococcus PCC7002, for which sequence

(Fig. 1 and additional file 2).
The branching position of Syn. elongatus (strains PCC
6301 and PCC 7942) is not resolved in phylogenetic
trees [4,11,12,37,47]. It generally branches in between
the Clades B and C species/strains in phylogenetic trees

work, which are specific for different groups of cyanobacteria, likely evolved. Many conserved indels that are specific for the same
groups/clades of cyanobacteria, have also been described in recent work [23].

cyanobacteria are also present in Syn. elongatus (Table
3b). It is known from earlier work that a number of cyanobacteria contain split DnaE protein due to the presence of intervening inteins [46,48,49]. Examination of
DnaE gene/protein from various cyanobacteria indicates
that the split DnaE proteins are found in all of the
Clades B cyanobacteria as well as Syn. elongatus,
whereas all other species/strains from clade A and C do
not contain split DnaE [4](Gupta, R. S., results not
shown). This rare genetic characteristic together with
the various proteins in Table 3b suggests that Syn. elongatus and Clade B cyanobacteria probably shared a common ancestor exclusive of other cyanobacteria.

Within Clade B, the cyanobacterial species/strains
belonging to the orders Nostocales, Oscillatoriales and
Chroococcales form a distinct clade (NOC clade) in phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1 and additional file 2). This clade
has been referred to as the SPM clade in earlier work
[4,47]. We have recently described a number of conserved indels in important proteins (viz. a 19 aa insert
in DnaE protein, a 13 aa deletion in GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase and a 22 aa insert in NAD(P)H-quinone
oxidoreductase subunit D) that are distinctive characteristics of this clade of cyanobacteria [23]. In the present
work, we have identified 9 proteins (Table 4a) that are
also uniquely present in all of the species/strains from

A homolog showing significant similarity is also found in Sorganum cellulosum

the NOC clade of cyanobacteria. In addition, 33 other
proteins listed in the additional file 4 are also specific
for the NOC clade, but they are missing in some species/strains. Within the NOC clade, species/strains
belonging to the orders Nostocales and Oscillatoriales
exhibit a closer relationship in phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1
and additional file 2). A 4 aa deletion in the translation
initiation factor IF-2 is also uniquely shared by various
sequenced cyanobacterial species/strains from these two
orders [23]. In this study, we have come across 22 proteins that are specifically present in various sequenced
species/strains from these two orders of cyanobacteria
(Table 4b), providing further support that these two
groups are more closely related.

Within Clade B, the heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria
form a monophyletic group (subclass Nostocophycidae)
[6,10,47,50]. We recently described two conserved indels
(a 4 aa insert in the PetA protein, a precursor of the
apocytochrome f, and a 5 aa insert in the ribosomal protein S3) that are specific for these bacteria [23]. In the
present work, blast searches on the genome of Nostoc
sp. PCC7120 have identified 65 proteins that are
uniquely shared by all of the sequenced Nostocales species/strains (Nostoc, Anabaena and Nodularia) (Table
4d and additional file 5). Fifty-eight additional protein
listed in the additional file 5 are also specific for this
order, but they are missing in 1-2 species/strains. These
proteins provide potential molecular signatures for the
Nostocales order (Nostocophycidae subclass).

The cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis, Microcystis,
Crocosphaera and Cyanothece, belonging to the order
Chroococcales, form another well-defined clade in phylogenetic trees (see Fig. 1 and additional file 2)
[4,11,12,37,47]. A 1 aa insert in a highly conserved
region of the RecA protein is also specific for these cyanobacteria [23]. This insert is also present in Synechococcus sp. PCC7002, which branches with this clade in
the phylogenetic trees (see Fig. 1 and additional file 2)
[4,47]. In this work, we have identified 8 proteins that
are uniquely present in various sequenced Chroococcales
species/strains (Table 4c). The evolutionary stages where
the genes for these proteins have likely evolved are indicated in the interpretive diagram (Fig. 2).
Signature proteins for the Clade C Cyanobacteria

The Clade C is comprised of different strains/isolates of
marine Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus [40,41,51-53].
We have recently described a number of conserved indels
in widely distributed proteins that are specific for all of
the species/strains from Clade C [23]. These signatures
include a 3 aa insert in the RNA polymerase beta subunit,
a 2 aa insert the proteins KsgA, a 6 aa insert in tyrosyltRNA synthetase, a 2 aa insert in the tRNA (guanine-N1)-methyltransferase, a 1 aa insert in the RNA polymerase
b’ subunit and a 12 aa insert in the DNA polymerase I
[23]. These signature indels are not found in the Clades
A or B cyanobacteria or other phyla of bacteria. Additionally, they are also absent in Syn. elongatus as well as
Synechococcus sps. PCC7002 and PCC7335. Another
example of a signature insert that is specific for Clade C
species/strains is presented in Fig. 3. In this case, a 6 aa
insert in a flavoprotein is commonly present in all Clade
C species/strains, but absent from all other cyanobacteria
as well as other bacteria. This latter observation indicates
that this indels is an insert in the Clade C species/strains.
Interestingly, this insert and also several of the other
Clade C signature indels are also present in Cyanobium
sp. PCC7001 (Fig. 3), supporting its placement within the
Clade C (Fig. 2) [4,15].
Our blast analyses on proteins from the genomes of
Synechococcus sp. WH8102, Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9215
and Pro. marinus subsp. marinus str. CCMP1375 have
identified 60 proteins that are uniquely shared by virtually all of the species/strains from Clade C cyanobacteria (Table 5a). These signature proteins provide further
evidence and molecular markers indicating the distinctness of Clade C. Eight additional proteins in Table 5b are
also specific for Clade C cyanobacteria, but they are
absent in all of the low B/A ecotype Prochlorococcus
strains, indicating that the genes for these proteins were
lost from a common ancestor of the low B/A clade.
As noted earlier, in phylogenetic trees, the branching
position of Syn. elongatus is not resolved. In our analyses, we have come across only 3 proteins (marked

Page 10 of 20

with + in Table 5a) that are uniquely found in Clade C
species/strains as well as Syn. elongatus. This is in contrast to 22 proteins that are uniquely shared by Clade B
cyanobacteria and Syn. elongatus (Table 3b). These
observations in conjunction with the unique presence of
split DnaE genes in Clade B cyanobacteria and Syn.
elongatus make a strong case that Syn. elongatus is
more closely related to the Clade B cyanobacteria than
to the Clade C species/strains.
The two genera, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus,
which make up most of the Clade C cyanobacteria, differ from each other in important respects, particularly
with regard to the main pigments in their light harvesting systems [40,41]. In contrast to various Synechococcus
strains/isolates and most other cyanobacteria, which
contain chlorophyll a and phycobiliproteins as the major
pigments in their photosynthetic systems, all Prochlorococcus strains/isolates utilize divinyl chlorophyll a and
both mono and divinyl chlrophyll b as the main pigments in their light-harvesting systems [40,41]. Further,
while Synechococcus isolates are ubiquitous in different
aquatic environments including estuarine, coastal and
offshore waters [53], Prochlorococcus strains are mainly
found in warm oligotrophic oceanic settings [40].
Among the sequenced cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus
strains/isolates have the smallest genomes (see Table 1).
Although Prochlorococcus are indicated to be polyphyletic in phylogenetic analyses (with strains MIT 9303
and MIT 9313 branching within the Synechococcus
strains/isolates; see Fig. 1 and additional file 2)
[12,23,33], our blast searches have identified 19 proteins
that are uniquely shared by all or most of the Prochlorococcus strains (Table 6b). These results indicate that
despite their polyphyletic branching in phylogenetic
trees, all Prochlorococcus strains/isolates form a monophyletic clade, which is in accordance with their distinctive photosynthetic pigments composition. In this work,
we also describe a 2 aa conserved insert in the protein
heme oxygenase that is also exclusively present in various Prochlorococcus strains (Fig. 4). The unique presence of this insert in various Prochlorococcus strains
provides further evidence that this group is monophyletic. The enzyme heme oxygenase, which contains this
conserved insert, plays an important role in the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments phyto-chromobilin
and phycobilins [54]. Because Prochlorococcus are
unique in terms of their photosynthetic pigment composition, it is of much interest to determine the functional
significance of this conserved indel.
If Prochlorococcus strains/isolates form a monophyletic
lineage, then one expect that other cyanobacteria that
are part of Clade C might also share many unique proteins in common. Indeed, our blast searches have identified 14 proteins that are uniquely present in various

light driven reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide - a key regulatory reaction in the chlorophyll
biosynthetic pathway [55]. Hence, it is again of much
interest to understand the functional significance of this
conserved indel. The rare genetic change leading to this

These proteins are primarily present in various Synechococcus species/strains that are part of Clade C (see Figs. 1 and 2). However, Synechococcus genus is not
monophyletic and many Synechococcus strains group with Clade and B (viz. Synechococcus sp. PCC7002, Synechococcus sp. PCC7335, Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab
and JA-2-3B’a) and these proteins are absent in those strains. Besides Synechococcus, homologs of many of these proteins are also found in Cyanobium sp.
PCC7001 as well as in Paulinella chromatophora, indicating that these species may also belong to the Clade C cyanobacteria.

Prochlorococcus strains after the branching of MIT9303
and MIT9313 (Fig. 2). These observations, in conjunction with the branching pattern of these strains in phylogenetic trees, provide evidence that these two
Prochlorococcus strains comprise the deepest branching
group (high B/A clade IV) [41] within the Prochlorococcus genus, exhibiting closest relationship to the Synechococcus strains/isolates.
Earlier studies have led to the division of Prochlorococcus strains/isolates into two physiologically distinct
groups (high B/A and low B/A ecotypes), based upon
the ratios of chlorophyll b and a2 in their light-harvesting systems and their ability to grow at different light
intensities [40,41,56]. Of these two groups, strains from
the high B/A ecotype, which have larger ratio of chlorophyll b/a2 are able to grow at extremely low irradiance,
whereas those from the low- B/A ecotype containing
lower ratio of chlorophyll b/a2 are unable to grow under
these conditions. The low- B/A ecotype strains instead
are adapted to growth at high light intensities, where
the growth of high B/A ecotype strains is inhibited. The
strains from these two ecotypes also differ in terms of
their sensitivity to copper and their ability to use nitrite
or nitrate as nitrogen sources [41,57]. In phylogenetic
trees, the low B/A ecotype Prochlorococcus isolates (viz.
MIT9515, CCMP1986, MIT9312, MIT9215, MIT9301

and AS9601) formed a distinct subclade that was well
separated from all other Clade C species/strains by a
long-branch and 100% bootstrap score (Fig. 1 and additional file 2)[23,41]. We have also described two conserved indels (viz. a 5 aa deletion in leucyl-tRNA
synthetase and 1 aa insert in the Ffh protein) that are
uniquely shared by all of the low B/A ecotype Prochlorococcus strains [23]. In the present work, we have identified 67 proteins that are exclusively found in all of the
sequenced strains from the low B/A ecotype clade (additional file 7a). Seventy-two proteins listed in the additional file 7b are also specific for this clade, but they are
missing in 1-2 of the strains/isolates. These signature
proteins and indels together with the distinct branching
of the low B/A strains in phylogenetic trees provide
strong evidence that this group of Prochlorococcus
strains are phylogenetically, physiologically and molecularly distinct from all other Prochlorococcus strains.
Based upon species distribution patterns of various cyanobacteria-specific proteins, evolutionary stages where
the genes for these proteins likely evolved are indicated
in the interpretive diagram in Fig. 2.

Discussion and Conclusions
In this work, we have used a combination of phylogenomic and signature proteins based approaches to

elucidate the evolutionary relationships among cyanobacteria. Phylogenetic trees were initially constructed for
44 cyanobacteria based on concatenated sequences for
44 widely distributed proteins present in various cyanobacteria. The branching pattern of cyanobacteria in
these trees was very similar to that observed in other
recent studies based on different large sets of proteins
for smaller numbers of cyanobacteria [4,11,12]. In all of
these trees a number of distinct clades of cyanobacteria
are consistently observed. However, the main focus of
the present work was on comparative analyses of

cyanobacterial genomes to identify unique sets of genes/
proteins that are limited to particular groups of cyanobacteria, corresponding to various phylogenetically identified clades. This work complement our recent studies,
where a comparative genomic approach was employed
to identify >40 conserved indels in widely distributed
proteins that are also specific for the same groups/clades
of cyanobacteria [23].
Recent analyses of genomic sequences have revealed
that whole proteins that are limited to different monophyletic clades are present at different phylogenetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/24

depths [26-28,43,44,58,59]. Unlike ORFan proteins,
which are unique to a given species or a strain and are
subject to rapid gene loss [44,60,61], these lineage-specific proteins are retained in a conserved state by all or
most species/strains from a given clade, indicating that
they are conferring selective advantage to species from
these clades [28,58,62]. Although the mechanism
responsible for the evolution or acquisition of genes for
these proteins is unclear [28,61], their specific presence
in different clades indicates that the genes for these proteins first evolved (or introduced) in a common ancestor
of these clades followed by their retention by various
descendents of these clades. Because of their clade specificity, these lineage specific-proteins or conserved signature proteins (CSPs) provide valuable molecular
markers for these clades [26-28,43,59]. Our recent analyses of CSPs from several major groups of bacteria (viz.
alpha proteobacteria, epsilon proteobacteria, gamma
proteobacteria, chlamydiae, Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi and
Actinobacteria) provide evidence that the species distribution of most of these CSPs show high degree of concordance with different clades in the phylogenetic trees
[25-27,42,63,64]. This inference is strongly reinforced by
the results of present study, where most of the identified
CSPs correspond to well-defined clades in the phylogenetic trees.
It should be mentioned that in our analyses we have
not come across significant numbers of CSPs that support alternate groupings i.e. where the proteins are commonly shared by various species/strains from clades that
are phylogenetically unrelated (e.g. Nostocales and Clade
C, or Oscillatoriales and Clade C). However, one commonly observed pattern is that if two clades are close to
each other in phylogenetic trees, but their branching is
not clearly resolved (i.e. weakly supported by bootstrap
scores), then in addition to observing many proteins
that are unique to each of these two clades, several proteins that are commonly shared by them are also
observed. This could be due to either that genes for
many of these proteins probably evolved in a common
ancestor of these clades prior to their becoming phylogenetically distinct or due to lateral gene transfers
among closely related taxa [13,65]. Nevertheless, our
results that most of these proteins are distinctive characteristics of phylogenetically well-defined monophyletic
clades strongly suggest that their species distribution
has not been significantly affected by lateral gene transfers, which is indicated to be very common in cyanobacteria [13,66].
When a protein is confined to only a certain group of
species/strains, then based upon this information alone,
it is difficult to determine whether the group of species
containing this protein form a clade in the phylogenetic
sense or not. To properly evaluate the results of such

Page 16 of 20

studies, it is necessary to carry out these studies in conjunction with phylogenetic as well as other forms of
analyses (e.g. studies based on conserved indels), where
it is possible to establish a rooted relationship among
different groups or taxa under consideration [23,26,59].
Based on these studies, if a given protein is uniquely
found in all or most of the species from a well-defined
monophyletic clade, and generally no where else, then
the simplest and most parsimonious explanation for this
is that the gene for this protein first appeared in a common ancestor of this group and then passed on vertically to its various descendants [17,20,67]. We have
interpreted the results of species distribution of various
unique proteins based on this minimal assumption.
Based on this interpretation, various identified signature
proteins or CSPs could be regarded as molecular synapomorphies that are specific for different clades of
cyanobacteria.
The branching order and interrelationships among
cyanobacteria that emerges based upon all of these different approaches is shown in Fig. 2. All of these
approaches indicate that a clade consisting of Gloebacter
and the Synechococcus strains JA-3-3Ab and JA2-3-B’a
(Clade A) forms the deepest branching lineage within
cyanobacteria. A large number of sequenced cyanobacteria correspond to marine unicellular Synechococcus
and Prochlorococcus strains (Clade C). We have identified numerous proteins and conserved indels that are
specific for this clade. Although Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus strains do not form monophyletic clusters
in phylogenetic trees, the shared presence of many novel
proteins as well as some conserved indels by various
Prochlorococcus strains provide evidence that this group
is monophyletic. The unique pigments that are found in
the light harvesting system of Prochlorococcus also support their distinctness from other cyanobacteria. The
monophyletic grouping of marine unicellular Synechococcus strains/isolates based upon these molecular and
biochemical characteristics is at variance with their polyphyletic branching in different phylogenetic trees (see
Fig. 1, additional file 2) [4,11,23]. This discordance
could be explained by either lateral migration of genes
responsible for these characteristics [11,13,33,68], or due
to inability of the phylogenetic trees to resolve the
branching order among closely related species/strains.
Among the Prochlorococcus strains, our analyses confirm
that the strains corresponding to low B/A ecotype are
distinct not only in physiological and phylogenetic terms
[40,41,56], but that they also share large numbers of
proteins that are unique to them. Several conserved
indels that are specific for the low B/A ecotype clade
have also been identified [23]. Recent study by Zhaxybayeva et al. [33] also provides evidence that the highlight adapted low B/A ecotype Prochlorococcus strains

Gupta and Mathews BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:24
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/24

form a monophyletic clade, in contrast to the paraphyletic grouping of the low-light adapted (i.e. high B/A
ecotype) Prochlorococcus spp. [33]. All of these observations make a strong case for the recognition of low B/A
ecotype Prochlorococcus strains as a distinct taxonomic
entity.
Within Clade B, many CSPs were identified that are
specific for the Nostocales and Chroococcales orders. In
addition, several other CSPs are uniquely present in the
Nostocales and Oscillatoriales orders, or by the Nostocales, Oscillatoriales and Chroococcales. In recent work,
a number of conserved indels that are unique to these
orders of cyanobacteria have also been identified [23].
Although, the clade comprising of these cyanobacterial
orders is not clearly resolved in phylogenetic trees
[4,11], the shared presence of large numbers of novel
CSPs as well as some conserved indels by these cyanobacteria strongly suggests that species/strains from these
groups shared a common ancestor exclusive of other
cyanobacteria and that this clade represents a deeper
branching grouping within cyanobacteria. The results
presented here also suggest that Syn. elongatus is more
closely related to Clade B in comparison to either clade
A or C of cyanobacteria.
The signature proteins and conserved indels for different cyanobacterial clades that are described in this work
and in our recent studies [23] provide novel and powerful means for understanding cyanobacterial phylogeny
and taxonomy. Based on these molecular markers, all of
the main clades of cyanobacteria can now be identified
and circumscribed in molecular terms. These signature
proteins and indels should also prove useful for the
identification and assignment of cyanobacterial species/
strains to specific clades based upon the presence or
absence of various signature indels or CSPs. Because
many of these CSPs, or proteins containing the conserved indels, are highly conserved, degenerate PCR primers could be readily designed to sequence the
corresponding genes/proteins from any given cyanobacteria. The assignment of any species/strains into a given
clade by this approach is based upon several independent signatures that provide complementary information. Some of these signatures serve to exclude a given
species/strains from particular groups or clades, whereas
others point to its inclusion in more and more specific
clades. Blast searches with these cyanobacteria-specific
CSPs should also prove useful in determining the presence or absence of different groups of cyanobacteria in
metagenomic sequences [69]
Most of the cyanobacterial signature proteins identified in this work are of unknown functions. However,
the retention of these genes by all cyanobacteria from
the indicated clades strongly suggests that these proteins
perform important functions in these groups of

Page 17 of 20

cyanobacteria [70-72]. Likewise, our recent work shows
that the conserved indels in protein sequences are also
essential for the group or clade of species where they
are found [73]. Hence, further work on understanding
the cellular functions of these cyanobacterial signature
proteins and signature indels should be of great interest.
These studies should provide valuable insights regarding
biochemical and physiological characteristics that are
unique to different clades of cyanobacteria [64,74-76].

Methods
Phylogenetic/phylogenomic analyses

Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on a set of 44
proteins involved in important housekeeping functions
that are present in most organisms (see Additional file
1) [35]. Blast searches with these proteins revealed that
their homologs were present in all 34 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes (listed in Table 1), the two outgroup
species (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), as
well as 10 other cyanobacteria (viz. Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501, Cyanothece sp. CCY0110, Lyngbya sp.
PCC8106, Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806, Nodularia
spumigena CCY9414, Syenchococcus sp. WH5701,
Syenchococcus sp. BL107, Syenchococcus sp. RS9917,
Syenchococcus sp. RS9916 and Syenchococcus sp.
WH7805). Hence, sequence information for all of these
cyanobacteria was included in our analyses. The multiple sequence alignments for these proteins were created
using the ClustalX 1.83 program [77] and they were
concatenated into a single large file. This unedited
sequence alignment was imported into the Gblocks
0.91b program to remove poorly aligned regions [78].
This program was used with default settings except that
allowed gap position parameter was changed to half.
The resulting final alignment of 16834 amino acid sites
was used for phylogenetic analyses. A neighbour-joining
(NJ) tree based on 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed by the Kimura model [79] using the TREECON
1.3b program [80]. The maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis was carried out using the WAG+F model with
gamma distribution of evolutionary rates with four categories using the TREE-PUZZLE program with 10000
puzzling steps [81].
Identification of proteins and conserved indels that are
specific for Cyanobacteria

The Blastp searches were carried out on each ORF in
the genomes of Synechococcus sp. WH8102, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Nostoc sp. PCC7120, Synechococcus sp.
JA-3-3Ab, Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9215 and Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. marinus str. CCMP1375 to identify proteins that are uniquely present in various clades
of cyanobacteria seen in the phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1).
The blast searches were performed against all organisms
(i.e. non-redundant (nr) database) using the default

Gupta and Mathews BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:24
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/24

parameters, without the low complexity filter [82]. The
proteins that were of interest were those where either
all significant hits were from the indicated groups of
cyanobacteria, or which involved a large increase in E
values from the last hit belonging to a particular clade
to the first hit from any other bacteria/cyanobacteria
and the E values for the latter hits were >1e-04, indicating weak similarity that could occur by chance. Higher
E values are often significant for smaller proteins as the
magnitude of the E value depends upon the length of
the query sequence [82]. Hence, the lengths of the
query proteins and those of various hits were also taken
into consideration when analyzing the results of these
studies. In most cases, the lengths of various significant
hits were very similar to those of the query proteins.
Some proteins, which in addition to cyanobacteria were
also found in the plants/plastids, or in an isolated species from some other groups (noted appropriately), were
also retained. The proteins, which were uniquely found
in a given species or strain were not examined in this
work. For all cyanobacterial proteins that are specific for
various clades or subgroups, their accession numbers,
any information regarding cellular functions, and protein
lengths, were tabulated and are presented. Identification
of new conserved indels that are specific for cyanobacterial clades was carried out as described in our earlier
work [22,23].

Authors’ contributions
The initial Blastp searches on various cyanobacterial genomes were carried
out by RSG with the computer assistance provided by Venus Wong. DWM
analyzed the results of these searches to identify various group-specific
proteins. All of these results were checked by RSG. DWM also generated a
