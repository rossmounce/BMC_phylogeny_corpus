Abstract
Background: Rat models are frequently used to find genomic regions that contribute to complex
diseases, so called quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In general, the genomic regions found to be
associated with a quantitative trait are rather large, covering hundreds of genes. To help selecting
appropriate candidate genes from QTLs associated with type 2 diabetes models in rat, we have
developed a web tool called Candidate Gene Capture (CGC), specifically adopted for this disorder.
Methods: CGC combines diabetes-related genomic regions in rat with rat/human homology data,
textual descriptions of gene effects and an array of 789 keywords. Each keyword is assigned values
that reflect its co-occurrence with 24 different reference terms describing sub-phenotypes of type
2 diabetes (for example "insulin resistance"). The genes are then ranked based on the occurrences
of keywords in the describing texts.
Results: CGC includes QTLs from type 2 diabetes models in rat. When comparing gene rankings
from CGC based on one sub-phenotype, with manual gene ratings for four QTLs, very similar
results were obtained. In total, 24 different sub-phenotypes are available as reference terms in the
application and based on differences in gene ranking, they fall into separate clusters.
Conclusion: The very good agreement between the CGC gene ranking and the manual rating
confirms that CGC is as a reliable tool for interpreting textual information. This, together with the
possibility to select many different sub-phenotypes, makes CGC a versatile tool for finding
candidate genes. CGC is publicly available at http://ratmap.org/CGC.

Background
Type 2 diabetes is one of the fastest growing health problems all over the world and accounts for more than 90%
of all cases of diabetes. The total number of people with
diabetes worldwide was estimated to be between 151 and
171 million in 2000, and is expected to rise to 366 million
by the year of 2030 [1]. The disease is defined by chronically elevated plasma glucose levels, but the development
of the disorder is complex, depending on both environ-

mental as well as multiple genetic factors. This complexity
seriously complicates the study of the disease. Here, animal models are very useful since their environment can be
well controlled and inbred animals ensure a homogenous
genetic background [2]. Consequently, inbred rat strains
predisposed for developing phenotypes closely resembling type 2 diabetes have frequently been used to explore
the relation between the diabetes phenotype and the genotype.

In most genetic studies of type 2 diabetes using rat models, two different inbred strains have been utilised, GotoKakazaki (GK) and Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty
(OLETF). Rats from both these strains spontaneously
develop phenotypes that resemble human type 2 diabetes.
The GK-rat is a non-obese model of type 2 diabetes that is
characterised by glucose intolerance, insulin resistance,
hyperinsulinaemia, altered insulin secretion and reduced
beta cell mass [3,4]. The OLETF-rat on the other hand is
an obese model of type 2 diabetes. At the age of 25 weeks,
male OLETF-rats develop a diabetic syndrome in nearly
100% of the cases [5]. OLETF-rats lack the cholecystokinin-1 receptor, which has been shown to lead to increased
food intake due to decreased satiety [6]. The obesity in
these rats is secondary to increased food intake and exercise is effective at preventing diabetes in OLETF-rats [6,7].
DNA-marker characterizations of offspring from backand F2-crosses of inbred non-diabetic and diabetic rat
strains (i.e. most often GK or OLETF) reveal regions associated with the trait under study, so called QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus) analysis [8,9]. In most studies, traits
quantified in the type 2 diabetes models include glucose
level, insulin level, body weight, gland mass, lipid level or
body fat amount. At present, at least 70 Niddm-(non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus) QTLs have been reported
in rat [10]. However, limitations in the number of animals
used to define a given QTL most often result in very large
suggestive genomic regions covering several hundred
genes. This poses a great problem in further search for the
disease-causing gene(s) and thus a limitation in the
number of potential candidate genes is of great value.
In order to facilitate the search for such candidate genes,
we have previously developed a web-tool that uses textual
gene information as a basis for gene ranking. This tool was
adopted for arthritis phenotypes and proved to be very
successful in ranking appropriate candidate genes [11].
Based on these experiences, we are now releasing a similar
tool for the diabetes rat model. However, the larger
number of QTL-regions and the multitude of phenotypic
measurements used in the diabetes rat models have raised
the need for a much more extended web-tool with new
functions for handling the more complex features. In this
paper we present this new tool together with an evaluation of its functions.

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/6/1/12

fying selection criterion [11]. Now, we are building a
related web-tool using QTL-regions from diabetic rat
models, a large set of diabetes-relevant keywords and a
range of different selection criteria.
QTL data
QTL information containing QTL-symbols, descriptions
and flanking markers were collected from the rat genome
databases Ratmap http://ratmap.org/ and RGD http://
rgd.mcw.edu/. This information was stored in a MySQLtable called "QTL". The handling of the data was done
according to the same protocol as for the CGC arthritis
web-tool [11].
Gene homology data
Gene homology data between rat and human was assembled as previously described [11]. In addition, the human
genomic regions homologous to each rat QTL are now
automatically loaded, based on flanking markers and
homology data. This enables an easy updating of databases containing gene homology data between rat and
human.
Downloading Gene Functional Data
The OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/ contains a
comprehensive record of gene function and clinical data,
which is used as a source for keyword querying in the CGC
application. For each human gene, gene function information is downloaded from OMIM and stored in a table
labelled "OMIMdata".
Selecting reference terms and ranking keywords
A reference term is the selection criterion used to estimate
the association of a given keyword to a phenotype of interest. In total, 24 reference terms related to different aspects
of metabolic disorders were selected from the literature.
Keywords were selected from MeSH terms as well as other
terms associated with metabolic disorders.

For each keyword, a so called relevance index was calculated by dividing the number of PubMed http://
www.pubmed.gov abstracts containing both the keyword
and the selected reference term with the number of
PubMed abstracts containing the keyword alone. The ratio
is multiplied by 100 to get the percentage figures. In total,
789 keywords are used in the application.

Methods
Previously, we have developed a web-based tool that facilitates the identification of candidate genes that contribute
to experimentally induced autoimmune arthritis. This
application, called Candidate Gene Capture (CGC), was
created by combining QTL regions in rat with human gene
homology data, descriptions of phenotypic gene effects
and selected keywords using the word "arthritis" as a uni-

Keywords with relevance indices of less than 0.1 are omitted since they will have very little impact on the gene ranking. Depending on which reference term that is being
used, the list of available keywords varies widely. For the
reference term "diabetes", 330 of the keywords are found
to be relevant and included in the search, whereas for the

Page 2 of 9

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2009, 6:12

reference term "diabetic foot" only 24 relevant keywords
are found.
Furthermore, a subset of 28 keywords was selected based
on how often they occur in literature on diabetic disorders. This subset of keywords was used in a quick version
of the CGC diabetes application. When ranking genes
with high CGC scores, keywords with low keyword values
have minor impact on the ranking. By excluding these
keywords from the analysis, the quick version of the application will run much faster with low risk of missing highly
ranked genes. The keywords were stored in MySQL-tables
called "DiabetesKeywords" and "DiabetesKeywordsShort".
All reference terms and keywords included in the CGC
application are available in Additional file 1.
Web application
QTL data from the MySQL-table "QTL" has been made
accessible through an introductory web page http://

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/6/1/12

www.ratmap.org/CGC/diabetes.php. Here, the user can
find a QTL of interest by searching for a QTL-symbol, a
brief functional description or a chromosomal position.
When a QTL has been selected, the individual QTL is presented together with a list of known orthologous rat genes
and human genes within the homologous interval.
To search this gene list for the most likely candidate genes,
the user first selects a reference term reflecting a sub-phenotype of interest (i.e. glucose tolerance, insulin resistance
etc). A list of keywords with relevant keyword indices
above 0.1 is generated. The user may select or deselect an
optional number of keywords, and/or change relevance
indices. The user may also assign up to ten keywords of
his/her own choice and the relevance index for each new
keyword is calculated (Figure 1).
When performing the query, the OMIM-text for each of
the homologous human genes is scanned for all keywords
selected. The keyword indices of all keywords found
within the OMIM-text of each gene are added to a total

score. A list of all matching genes is presented ranked by
their total score.
Manual evaluation
In order to evaluate the CGC tool we manually rated genes
found within four randomly chosen QTLs (Niddm8,
Niddm18, Niddm38 and Niddm46) [12-15]. The genes
were rated from 1 to 5, 1 meaning that the connection to
diabetes was obvious and 5 meaning that we found no
connection to diabetes whatsoever. Our manual rating
was then compared with the ranking obtained from the
CGC tool using "diabetes" as reference term. In two of the
evaluated QTLs, a large number of genes with at least one
matching keyword were found (Niddm18; 72 genes,
Niddm46; 80 genes). The other two QTLs resulted in a
lower number of matching genes (Niddm8; 9 genes,
Niddm38; 16 genes). In the two smaller QTLs, all genes
with at least one matching keyword were manually rated,
whereas in the two larger ones, only genes with a CGC
score of 15 and above were manually rated. The manual
ratings of the genes were done without prior knowledge of
their CGC-scores.

Results
To evaluate the CGC application, we made a manual rating of genes within four randomly chosen QTLs (Niddm8,
Niddm18, Niddm38 and Niddm46). Genes within each
QTL were divided into five categories according to how
likely they were to infer susceptibility to type 2 diabetes: 1
– "Obvious" candidate gene, 2 – "Likely" candidate gene,
3 – "Possible" candidate gene, 4 – "Unlikely" candidate
gene and 5 – "Irrelevant" gene. The outcome of the manual evaluation was then compared to a ranking made by
the CGC application. This CGC ranking was made with
"diabetes" as the reference term. (Note that the database
is updated on a regular basis, hence the present version of
CGC may not coincide totally with this manual evaluation.) Detailed descriptions of the top ranked genes in
each QTL are available as Additional file 2.
Niddm8
In total, 9 genes were ranked by the CGC application.
SHC1 and ENSA were ranked as the two top candidates
with CGC points exceeding 100. No "obvious" candidate
gene was found in the manual inspection, but SHC1 and
ENSA were considered to be the only two "likely" candidate genes. The remaining seven genes were all considered
to be "irrelevant" in the manual rating. The mean CGC
point in this group of genes was 7.5, ranging from 2.4 to
20.3.
Niddm18
In total, 72 genes were ranked by the CGC application. In
the manual inspection only genes with a CGC ranking of
15 and above were evaluated. GCK was ranked as the out-

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/6/1/12

standing top candidate and was also considered to be an
"obvious" candidate gene in the manual inspection. Two
additional genes were rated as "obvious" candidate genes
in the manual rating: GC and NKX6A. These two genes
were ranked as number 2 and 5 in the CGC ranking. Two
genes ranked 3 and 4 (CCKAR and WFS1) were both manually rated as "likely" candidate genes.
A middle group of 18 genes had a mean manual ranking
of 3.9 and ranged from 2 to 5. Specifically, three genes
were manually ranked 2; CD38, SLC2A9 and SLC5A1. The
mean CGC point in this middle group was 22.4, ranging
from 15 to 75.5. The remaining 49 ranked genes had a
mean CGC score of 4.7 and were not manually evaluated.
Niddm38
In total, 16 genes were ranked by the CGC application.
Five genes (RRAD, FANCA, CETP, FOXC2 and HP)
obtained a CGC score above 100. The RRAD and FOXC2
genes were manually rated as "obvious" candidate genes
and the remaining three genes were rated as "likely".

A middle group of 7 genes had a mean manual ranking of
3.0 and ranged from 2 to 5. Specifically, three genes were
manually ranked 2; AGRP, CDH13 and HSD11B2. The
mean CGC point in this middle group was 44.4 ranging
from 18.7 to 88.8. The remaining 4 ranked genes had a
mean CGC score of 12.8 and were all manually rated as 5.
Niddm46
In total, 80 genes were ranked by the CGC application. In
the manual inspection, only genes with a CGC ranking of
15 and above were evaluated. Nine genes (GAD1,
NEUROD1, DPP4, MAPK8IP1, GCG, GPD2, CD59, CAT,
FUT7) obtained a CGC score above 100. Five of these
genes (NEUROD1, DPP4, MAPK8IP1, GCG, GPD2) were
manually rated as "obvious candidate genes". These genes
were ranked among the 6 best candidate genes by the
CGC application.

A middle group of 15 genes had a mean manual ranking
of 3.5 and ranged from 2 to 5. Specifically, two genes were
manually rated 2; RXRA and SLC2A8. The mean CGC
point in this group was 29.7 ranging from 15.5 to 66.2.
The remaining 56 ranked genes had a mean CGC score of
2.3 and were not manually evaluated.
Evaluating the significance of different reference terms
To evaluate how much the results from CGC differ when
using different reference terms, for one single QTL
(Niddm46) we calculated the difference in ranking position between the results obtained from searches using all
reference terms. For example, the gene NEUROD1 is
ranked 1 when using "diabetes" as the reference term, but
ranked 6 when using "glucose uptake" as a reference term.

Page 4 of 9

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2009, 6:12

Hence, the difference in ranking position is 6-1 = 5. The
sum of such differences between two reference terms was
used as an estimate of similarity in gene ranking between
two reference terms. This calculation was made for the ten
genes ranked highest by CGC in Niddm46 for all reference
terms and all these gene rankings were compared with
each other.
To get an overview of which reference terms that result in
the most similar rankings, the sum differences between all
reference terms were used to construct a tree.
The tree was constructed using the program "FITCH" from
Phylip (Phylogeny interference package version 3.66)
[16]. FITCH was developed to create phylogenic trees
based on distances computed from molecular sequences,
restriction sites or fragment distances or from genetic distances computed from gene frequencies. FITCH is based
on the Fitch-Margoliash method, a distance based optimization, which searches for a tree with the smallest squared
distance between the computed distances and their predictions from the tree. FITCH estimates phylogenies from
distance matrix data under the "additive tree model"
according to which the distances are expected to equal the
sums of branch lengths between the species compared.
For our tree however, we used the differences in ranking
positions of the CGC as the distance matrix (Figure 2).
Four reference terms were omitted from this final presentation because of limitations in the number of ranked
genes.
The rankings used to construct this tree were based on a
quick version of the CGC application. In this quick version only 28 keywords are used in each query. The 28 keywords were manually selected based on their frequency in
diabetes related literature as well as on high keyword values. This quick version is available through the website.

Discussion
A recurrent problem when performing genetic studies of
complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, is that genomic
regions found to be associated with the phenotype are
rather large. Finding appropriate candidates within these
regions is generally not a simple task. In this paper we
present a tool (CGC) that facilitates the search for candidate genes within type 2 diabetes associated QTL regions
in rat. This is done by analysing textual gene information
for a large set of keywords weighted against a set of phenotypical reference terms. The outcome of the analysis is
a ranking of all genes in a selected QTL region.
Niddm8
The two genes that obtained more than 100 CGC points
in Niddm8 were also manually considered to be the best
candidate genes (manual rating 2). The seven remaining

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/6/1/12

genes all obtained less than 30 CGC points and were also
manually considered to be "irrelevant".
Niddm18
Out of the five genes that obtained more than 100 CGC
points in Niddm18, four were manually considered to be
"obvious" candidate genes and the fifth was rated as
"likely ". The 18 remaining genes with CGC points
between 15 and 75.5 were all manually rated as "unlikely"
or "irrelevant" except for one that was rated as "possible"
and three that were rated as "likely" candidate genes;
CD38, SLC2A9 and SLC5A1.

Although rather briefly mentioned in OMIM, CD38 participates in the Ca-dependent activation of insulin secretion [17]. Autoantibodies against CD38 in several type 2
diabetes patients also suggest an important role in the disease, however these results are under debate [18]. CD38 is
not reaching 100 CGC points which most likely is due to
lack of the word "diabetes" in OMIM. Still, CGC rates
CD38 quite high (49.6 points) because of hits from four
separate keywords.
SLC2A9 and SLC5A1 are both glucose transporters over
the cell membrane [19,20] and are as such interesting candidate genes for diabetes. However, neither SLC2A9 nor
SLC5A1 has been shown to be closely associated with diabetes and this is reflected in the descriptive text in OMIM,
which is very brief. Thus, the difference between CGC and
our manual rating for these two glucose transporters is not
based so much on evidence as on human expectations.
Niddm38
Out of the five genes that obtained more than 100 CGC
points in Niddm38, two were manually considered to be
"obvious" candidate genes and three were rated as
"likely". Among the eleven remaining genes eight were
manually rated as "possible", "unlikely" and "irrelevant",
whereas three were rated as "likely"; AGRP, CDH13 and
HSD11B2.

AGRP normally regulates body weight in mice through
central melanocortin receptors [21]. AGRP is increased in
obese men and AGRP levels are correlated with various
parameters of obesity [22]. Although AGRP does not reach
100 CGC points, it still obtains a high score (88.8 points),
placing it at the fifth position among the candidates
within this QTL.
CDH13 is expressed in endothelial and smooth muscle
cells, where it is positioned to interact with adiponectin.
CDH13 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored extracellular protein, and may act as a coreceptor for the transmission of adiponectin metabolic signals [23]. Since
adiponectin is a hormone secreted by adipocytes that reg-

Comparison of results using different reference terms
Comparison of results using different reference terms. The horizontal branches of the tree illustrate the distances
between reference terms. Two reference terms with a short distance separating them will rank genes in a similar way, while
terms with larger distances between them will generate rankings where the order of genes will be more different.

ulate energy, glucose and lipid metabolism, CDH13 is
rated high in our evaluation. Furthermore, several studies
of human population suggest an increased risk of type 2
diabetes as a consequence of low adiponectin levels [24].
In the CGC application, CDH13 obtains 38.9 points from
only one single matching keyword ("adiponectin"). However, the close connection between adiponectin and type
2 diabetes is not discussed further in the OMIM-text
explaining the low CGC point.
HSD11B2 confers specificity to the mineralocorticoid
receptor (MR) by converting biologically active glucocorticoids (cortisol) to inactive metabolites (cortison). We
find the gene interesting in the manual evaluation since
elevated cortisol levels contribute to the development of
the entire spectrum of the metabolic syndrome, including
visceral obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia
[25,26]. In CGC, HSD11B2 is ranked tenth, obtaining

35.1 CGC points due to as much as nine matching keywords, although each contributes with a relatively small
amount.
Niddm46
Out of the nine genes that obtained more than 100 CGC
points in Niddm46, five were manually considered to be
"obvious" candidate genes, two were rated as "likely", and
another two were rated as "possible". The 15 remaining
genes with CGC points between 15 and 66,2 were all
manually rated as "possible" or "unlikely" except for one
that was rated as "irrelevant" and two genes that were
rated as "likely"; RXRA, and SLC2A8.

RXRA is a versatile regulator of metabolic function including glucose and lipid homeostasis. RXRA is a member of
the Retinoid × Receptor family which is reported to play
an important role in different metabolic disorders includ-

ing type 2 diabetes [27]. Due to its multiple functions, the
glucose regulating function of RXRA is only briefly mentioned in OMIM resulting in a CGC point of 32.3.
SLC2A8 is another glucose transporter and the difference
in rating between CGC and our manual evaluation is
explained by the same argument as stated for SLC29A2
and SLC5A1 above.
CD59 has 121.9 CGC points but is only considered to be
a "possible" candidate gene in our evaluation. The reason
for this discrepancy is that although CD59 is very much
involved in the diabetes phenotype, it seems to be responsible for the vascular changes that follow from type 2 diabetes. Thus, several keywords fit very well, but the CGC
application cannot distinguish a secondary function from
a primary.
FUT7 has 105.6 CGC points but is only considered to be
a "possible" candidate gene in our evaluation. The reason
for this discrepancy is that the OMIM text makes a rather
extensive description of one patient that has a
homozygous loss of function mutation in FUT7. One of
the symptoms mentioned was noninsulin-dependent diabetes, which brings 100 points to the gene although it is
stated that the connection is unclear.
In summary, for all four QTLs, a total of 21 genes obtained
a CGC score exceeding 100. Of these genes, 11 were manually rated as "obvious" candidate genes, 8 were rated as
"likely" candidate genes and 2 were rated as "possible"
candidate genes.
In the QTLs Niddm8 and Niddm38, all genes with a CGC
score less than 100 were manually evaluated. In Niddm18
and Niddm46, only genes with a score of 15 to 100 were
manually evaluated. Out of these genes, 8 were considered to be "likely" candidate genes, 7 were considered to
be "possible" candidate genes, 17 were considered to be
"unlikely" candidate genes and 18 were considered to be
"irrelevant". Thus, no genes with a CGC score less than
100 were considered to be an "obvious" candidate gene.
Overall, this comparison between our manual evaluation
and the CGC ranking shows an exceptionally good agreement. The manual consideration did not only involve
reading the OMIM text but was also based on exploration
of a great number of additional references and took considerable time to undertake. This is in contrast to the
much faster process of simply running the CGC application.
Using different reference terms
As shown above, using "diabetes" as the reference term
works very well when searching for genes related to the

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/6/1/12

disease. The term diabetes is rather general though, and
many phenotypes are categorised under this diagnosis. If
the trait under study is well specified, a more specific reference term will probably be more informative. The physiologic phenotypes of the different inbred rats used to
construct the Niddm-QTLs are well studied and the resulting candidate genes will probably be more accurate if the
choice of reference term reflects these phenotypes. For
example, if the GK-rat was used, reference terms like "glucose intolerance", "insulin resistance" and "hyperinsulinaemia" would probably be good choices, since these are
all among the defined characteristics of this strain.
Another thing to bear in mind is that each diabetes-QTL
analysis is constructed by quantifying a specific trait.
These traits include "glucose level", "insulin level", "body
weight", "gland mass", "lipid level" and "body fat
amount". Selecting reference terms corresponding to the
quantified trait is thus probably a good idea.
Comparison of results when using different reference terms
To evaluate the use of different reference terms, we compared the rankings for all 24 reference terms within one
single QTL (Niddm46). By calculating the sum of differences in gene position obtained with different reference
terms, we could measure the similarity in rankings. Sums
of differences in gene rankings were calculated for all pair
wise comparisons between reference terms. These sums
were used as a distance matrix for constructing a "phylogenetic" tree using the FITCH software [16]. The tree
makes it possible to get an overview of how similar the reference terms are in ranking possible candidate genes.

In the tree, certain reference terms are grouped together.
For example, there is a group of five reference terms that
are all associated with insulin ("insulin action", "insulin
resistance", "insulin sensitivity", "hyperinsulinemia" and
"hyperinsulinaemia"). Other reference terms that cluster
together are "glucose uptake" and "glucose transport" as
well as "microalbuminurea" and "diabetic nephropathy".
In all, the distances between and clustering of reference
terms in the tree are very close to what can be expected
from a functional perspective. Thus, these results clearly
demonstrate that functionally related terms generate,
more or less, the same candidate genes. Consequently, the
tree can be useful as guidance for choosing reference
terms.
Since the ranking of genes is based on matching keywords
and their reference points, the distances between reference
terms in the tree do not only reflect gene ranking, but also
the order in which the keywords are ranked. Based on our
analysis it seems that the total point for each gene in
searches with two closely related reference terms may vary
widely, but the order of the gene ranking will still be very
similar. The same goes for the keywords included in the

search and is merely a reflection of the frequency of the
reference terms among PubMed abstracts. This is most
likely caused by the tendency of certain keywords to cooccur at a higher frequency, whereas more specific reference terms will be mentioned in fewer papers and hence
generate lower points. However, the order of the keywords will be more or less the same using related reference
terms.

Conclusion
We believe that the very good agreement between our
manual rating for the four evaluated QTLs (Niddm8,
Niddm18, Niddm38 and Niddm46) and the ranking made
by the CGC application proves that the application makes
reliable predictions when selecting candidate genes for
diabetes. Furthermore, the differences in gene ranking
observed when using different reference terms (visualised
in Figure 1) indicate that the application will generate candidate genes appropriate for each sub-phenotype. Overall,
we believe that the CGC application can be of great use
when selecting candidate genes for phenotypes related to
type 2 diabetes within defined QTL regions.
