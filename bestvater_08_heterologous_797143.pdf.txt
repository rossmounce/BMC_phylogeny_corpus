Abstract
Transcription of the ectoine biosynthesis genes ectA, ectB and ectC from Marinococcus halophilus in
recombinant Escherichia coli DH5α is probably initiated from three individual σ70/σA-dependent
promoter sequences, upstream of each gene. Consequently, mRNA-fragments containing the single
genes and combinations of the genes ectA and ectB or ectB and ectC, respectively, could be detected
by Northern blot analysis. Under the control of its own regulatory promoter region (ectUp) a
seemingly osmoregulated ectoine production was observed. In addition, aspartate kinases were
identified as the main limiting factor for ectoine production in recombinant E. coli DH5α. Coexpression of the ectoine biosynthesis genes and of the gene of the feedback-resistant aspartate
kinase from Corynebacterium glutamicum MH20-22B (lysC) led to markedly increased production of
ectoine in E. coli DH5α, resulting in cytoplasmic ectoine concentrations comparable to those
reached via ectoine accumulation from the medium.

Background
To master the osmotic stress of saline environments, halophilic organisms accumulate highly water-soluble organic
osmolytes, so-called compatible solutes [1-3]. Ectoine
(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidine
carboxylic
acid), the compatible solute that was first discovered in
Ectothiorhodospira halochloris [4], is one of the most commonly found osmolytes in nature [5-9]. Besides their
osmotic effect, ectoines as well as other compatible solutes have been found to improve protein folding and to
protect biomolecules such as enzymes, nucleic acids, antibodies and even whole cells against heating, freeze-thawing, drying or chemical treatment [10-14]. Additional
applications of ectoine include use as protective additive,
modulator of proinflammatory response and moisturizer

for skin care products [15-17], and potentially also for
treatment of diseases related to protein misfolding [1821]. In view of its potential as a stabilizing, protective and
pharmaceutical agent, a bioprocess for ectoine production
named "bacterial milking" has been developed for commercial exploitation using the halophilic eubacterium
Halomonas elongata [22].
The non-halophilic Escherichia coli has been shown to
accumulate ectoine from the surrounding medium, and as
a consequence its tolerance to elevated salinities is
increased [23]. Also, recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue is able
to express the ectoine genes ectABC from the Gram-positive moderately halophilic Marinococcus halophilus and
exploit the enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway for

osmoregulated ectoine production [7]. The organization
of the ectoine gene cluster and its relation to the ectoine
biosynthetic pathway is shown in Fig. 1A and 1B. A search
for consensus sequences for σ70/σA-dependent promoters
revealed two potential promoter sites upstream of ectB,
but none at the beginning of the gene cluster [7]. Using
deletion derivatives, however, the authors were able to
conclude that regulating sequences must extend up to or
beyond 150 bp upstream of ectA.
In this study, we report the transcription initiation sites of
the ectoine gene cluster as determined by RACE (rapid
amplification of cDNA ends) in both, the donor Marinococcus halophilus as well as the genetically engineered E. coli
DH5α. In addition, we report on potential metabolic limitions for heterologous ectoine production and the generation of a new recombinant production strain freed from
one such metabolic "bottle-neck" which limits substrate
supply of the ectoine biosynthetic pathway.

Results
Northern analysis
Expression of a genomic library of the halophilic Marinococcus halophilus in low-copy number vector pHSG575
[24] resulted in the identification of the gene cluster
encoding ectoine biosynthetic genes ectA, ectB and ectC
and the construction of two vectors, pOSM12 and
pOSM2, enabling ectoine synthesis and enhanced salt tolerance in E. coli Xl-1 blue [7]. Whereas the former carries
a region 720 bp upstream of the start codon of ectA
(ectUp), the latter lacks regulatory elements because of a
truncated upstream region (100 bp only). By Northern
blot analysis with specific RNA-probes for ectA (approx.
0.6 kb), ectB (approx. 1.3 kb) and ectC (approx. 0.4 kb),
we could identify both, mRNAs of the single gene products and mRNAs containing ectAB and ectBC, respectively,
in heterologous E. coli DH5α pOSM12 (Fig. 2A). However
we were not able to distinguish between the bands of
ectAB (approx. 2000 bp) and ectBC (approx. 1800 bp) on
the ectB blot. A band corresponding to ectABC mRNA with
an approx. size of 2500 bp could not be detected in E. coli
DH5α. In E. coli DH5α pOSM2 the transcription pattern
was different with respect to ectA. Transcription of ectA or
ectAB in DH5α pOSM2, which had its osmoregulatory
DNA region upstream of ectA replaced by a lac promoter,
could not be detected in the abscence of IPTG, whereas
after IPTG induction, only ectA mRNA, but no ectAB
mRNA was produced (Fig. 2B). Transcription of ectB, ectC
and ectBC in DH5α pOSM2 was not influenced by IPTG
and conformed with that of DH5α pOSM12.
Determination of transcription start points by rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
Putative transcription initiation sites for both, the donor
(Marinococcus halophilus) and the genetically engineered

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/12

acceptor (E. coli DH5α) were identified using the RACE
technique. The identified sites are shown in Fig. 3. Subsequently potential promoter recognition sites were investigated by homology search using the Neural Network
Promotor Prediction programme and assigned to the previously identified initiation sites. Primary eubacterial
sigma factors are responsible for the transcription of most
genes expressed in exponentially growing cells and essential for cell survival. They are known as σ70 in E. coli and
σA in Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive bacteria and
have identical consensus sequences. Non-essential stationary-phase or general stress response σ-factors of the
Enterobacteriaceae are called σS and similar in function
(but not in consensus sequence) to σB of B. subtilis and
related organisms [25].
In the donor (M. halophilus) single gene transcription of
ectA and ectB appears to be under control of σA-dependent
promoters (Fig. 3A and 3B). The initiation sites are located
114 nucleotides and 44 nucleotides upstream of the start
codon for the genes ectA and ectB, respectively. In addition
to the transcription initiation sites for the single gene
products, in M. halophilus, a site for the transcription of
ectAB and/or ectABC could be found 34 bp upstream of
the start codon of ectA. These results were obtained when
the mRNA in the RACE procedure was transcribed to
cDNA over two consecutive genes (approx. 0.9 kb), starting from an ectB-specific primer. Unfortunately, we were
unable to detect an analogous transcription initiation site
for ectBC, probably because of the length of the potential
RACE product (1.6 kb for ectBC compared to only 0.9 kb
in the case of ectAB). In contrast to the promoters for single gene transcription, the transcription initiation site of
ectAB and/or ectABC is under the control of a putative σBdependent promoter (Fig. 3A). Taken into consideration
that the primary sigma factor σA is responsible for the
expression of the essential genes for cell survival, whereas
σB mediates the general stress response, this could point
towards an interplay of various mechanisms regulating
the expression of the ectoine genes in M. halophilus. The
RACE reverse transcription product of ectC mRNA appears
to stop 83 nucleotides upstream of the start codon (|**
in Fig. 3C), but no corresponding promoter consensus
sequence could be assigned to this initiation site. Therefore, the possibility remains that this initiation site is an
artefact, possibly due to the formation of a secondary
structure of mRNA (terminating loop), or the result of
mRNA processing. Downstream of this hypothetical transcription initiation site a potential σA-dependent promoter site, comprising a -10 and a -35 region, could be
found (Fig. 3C) with a potential transcription initiation
point 29 bp upstream of ectC. This promoter site is apparently not used in M. halophilus under the conditions
employed, it is however recognized by the genetically
engineered host, E. coli DH5α.

Northern blot analysis
Northern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from E. coli DH5α pOSM12 at 1% and 3% NaCl (A) and
from E. coli DH5α pOSM2 at 3% NaCl (B) in minimal medium MM63 was performed with specific RNA probes for each of the
ectoine genes ectA, ectB and ectC (0.4 kb = ectC, 0.6 kb = ectA, 1.3 kb = ectB, 1.8 kb = ectBC, 2.0 kb = ectAB). Arrows indicate
where mRNA bands matching the calculated size of gene should be located. (+) and (-) refer to presence and absence of IPTG.

In E. coli, transcription of each single gene ectA, ectB and
ectC is under control of a σ70/σA-dependent promoter
with both -10 and -35 region. Transcription is initiated 29
bp upstream of the start codon for ectC, 44 bp for ectB and
probably 114 bp for ectA (Fig 3). In the case of ectA, experimental proof of the predicted transcription initiation site
posed a problem as resulting cDNA fragments were terminated 89 bp upstream of the start codon (|** in Fig. 3A).
No suitable promoter sequence was found in this region.
Even though the experimental characterization of a transcription initiation site upstream of ectA was not successful, we were able to reveal the likely initiation site shown
in Fig. 3A from the data available. Louis and Galinski [7]
were able to demonstrate that a deletion 146 bp upstream
of the start codon (shaded area in Fig. 3) resulted in unregulated ectoine production in E. coli XL1-Blue pOSM16. In
this work we demonstrated, using DH5α pOSM2, that a
deletion 100 bp upstream of the start codon ( pOSM2 in
Fig. 3A) completely disabled transcription of ectA. From
this we concluded a promoter region beyond 100 bp and
somewhere around 150 bp upstream of ectA, probably
identical to the σA-dependent site identified for M. halophilus. (Fig. 3A). This proposal is corroborated by the finding that the deletion in pOSM16 changes the first two

thymidine nucleotides (TT) of the sequence of the potential σ70-dependent -35 region TTGAAA (Fig. 3A). The consensus sequence for this -35 region is TTGACA [25].
Growth and ectoine production of genetically engineered
E. coli
Plasmid pOSM12 carries a 3.5 kb DNA fragment from M.
halophilus containing the ectoine biosynthetic genes
ectABC and a putative promoter region (ectUp) 720 bp
upstream of ectA, whereas on pOSM2 this upstream
region is deleted 100 bp short of ectA and substituted by a
lac promoter (Fig. 1B). Expression of the ectoine biosynthetic genes ectABC in E. coli DH5α using both pOSM12
and pOSM2, the latter supplemented with IPTG, led to an
accumulation of ectoine in the cells (Fig. 4). The amount
of intracellular ectoine increased with salinity of the
growth medium in both cases but appeared to be slightly
lower in the strain DH5α pOSM2. The most obvious difference was that the E. coli construct devoid of the promoter region (pOSM2) was unable to grow at 5% NaCl
(Fig. 4). The levels of ectoine accumulation were, however, always lower than those of the control strain (DH5α
pHSG575) in the presence of externally supplied ectoine
(Fig. 4).

DH5α pOSM12 displayed slower growth than the control
at salinities below 3% NaCl (Fig. 5). At salinities above

3% NaCl, however, a growth promoting effect was
observed, which enabled the organism to tolerate up to
5% NaCl (Fig. 5). Although the intracellular concentration of ectoine increased linearly with salinity, it remained
below ectoine levels achieved by the control strain DH5α

between 3 and 5% NaCl, resulting in a strong promotion
of cell growth (Fig. 5). Comparison with Halomonas elongata, an extremely halotolerant ectoine-producing bacterium, revealed that the intracellular ectoine levels were
similar up to 3% NaCl but approximately 1.5-fold higher
in H. elongata at 5% NaCl (data not shown). This indicates
that E. coli DH5α, when grown in an ectoine-containing
medium, is able to establish the required ectoine levels in
a salinity range of 1–3% NaCl through uptake mechanism, but not at higher salinities. The heterologous
ectoine production, on the other hand, appears to be
restricted, leading to markedly lower ectoine levels in the
cells (Fig. 4).
The comparatively low ectoine levels in recombinant E.
coli DH5α pOSM12 could not be explained by limitation
of the cells' capacity because the ectoine-accumulating
control strain tolerated higher intracellular ectoine concentrations nor by leakage because ectoine was not detectable in the medium (HPLC sensitivity limit: 10 μM). In
addition, higher cytoplasmatic ectoine levels caused a significant growth-promotion of the control strain and
appeared to have no negative effect on the cells. We therefore assumed that regulatory mechanisms in the metabolism of E. coli caused the limitation of ectoine production
in the recombinant strains. To determine potential candidates for the limiting steps, the ectoine biosynthetic pathway had to be analyzed in context with E. coli's metabolic
network, where L-aspartate β-semialdehyde, the substrate
of the first enzyme of the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, is
an intermediate of the biosynthetic pathway of the amino
acids of the aspartate family (Fig. 1A). As E. coli has three
aspartate kinase activities (I-III), which are regulated by
feedback inhibition and/or transcriptional repression
[26], we suspected a bottle-neck for the supply of this metabolic precursor in E. coli DH5α pOSM12.

Role of aspartate kinases in ectoine synthesis
In order to obtain more information about the presumed
bottle-neck in E. coli DH5α pOSM12, growth experiments
at 3% NaCl were performed in the presence of the end
products and regulators of the synthesis of the aspartate
family amino acids: L-lysine, L-threonine and L-methionine (each 1 mM). In the presence of these amino acids,
ectoine biosynthesis was significantly reduced, leading to
an almost complete inhibition by a mixture of all three
amino acids (Fig. 6). In contrast, the addition of L-aspartate (1 mM), the substrate of the aspartate kinases, or its
precursor fumarate (1 mM) to the growth medium
resulted in 2.3-fold and 1.4-fold elevated ectoine levels,
respectively. Higher L-aspartate or fumarate concentrations in the medium did not cause a further increase in
ectoine production. As expected, the enhancing effect of
aspartate or fumarate on ectoine biosynthesis was again

drastically reduced in the presence of L-lysine, L-threonine
and L-methionine (Fig. 6).
Opening the bottle-neck with plasmid pAKECT1
The results obtained from the supplementation experiments provide strong evidence that the aspartate kinases,
which are the key regulatory enzymes for the biosynthetic
pathway of aspartate family amino acids in E. coli, represent a bottle-neck for ectoine production in the non-halophilic host DH5α pOSM12 because of stringent feed-back
inhibition and/or transcriptional repression. Our strategy
to relieve this metabolic restriction was to alter the regulation of the biosynthetic pathway by co-expression of the
ectoine biosynthetic genes together with the feedbackinsensitive aspartate kinase (lysC) from C. glutamicum
MH20-22B, which had already been successfully
expressed in E. coli [27,28].

The plasmid pAKECT1 (Fig. 7) contains lysC under the
control of a tac promoter and the gene cluster ectABC with
the putative osmoregulated promoter sequence upstream
of ectA (ectUp), just as in pOSM12. The possibility to separately induce the ectoine biosynthetic genes by osmotic
stress and the aspartate kinase by IPTG enabled us to
directly investigate the effect of the deregulated aspartate
kinase on growth rates and ectoine production. As shown
in Fig. 5, induction of aspartate kinase increased the

growth rate at low salinity (1% and 2% NaCl) to the same
level as the control. Without IPTG-induction of the feedback-insensitive aspartate kinase gene the ectoine levels in
the cells were similar to those in DH5α pOSM12, but
upon addition of IPTG, ectoine production increased
approx. 3-fold in the range of 1–3% NaCl and reached a
maximum of 0.4 mmol (g dry weight)-1, which remained
relatively constant at salinities of 3% NaCl, to 5% NaCl
(Fig. 8). The observed saturation level at 3% NaCl and
higher perfectly correlated with the levels achieved by
ectoine uptake from the growth medium (Fig. 4). This
observation provides strong evidence that we succeeded
in by-passing the regulatory mechanisms which caused
the metabolic restriction for ectoine production in recombinant E. coli DH5α.
Enzymatic activity of the aspartate kinases
The enzyme assay for aspartate kinases proved the presence of a feedback-insensitive aspartate kinase from C.
glutamicum MH20-22B (Table 1). In E. coli DH5α
pAKECT1 the enzyme activity after IPTG induction was
about 2-fold higher than in pOSM12 and pOSM2. Furthermore, no inhibition by L-lysine and L-threonine
occurred in the strains expressing deregulated aspartate
kinase, whereas E. coli aspartate kinases from DH5α
pOSM12 and DH5α pOSM2 displayed a 55% lower activity after addition of L-lysine and L-threonine (10 mM in

in E. coli DH5α pAKECT1 is the same, both in the presence and absence of the inhibitors (L-lysine and L-threonine) indicates that a deregulated aspartate kinase from C.
glutamicum leads to increased levels of aspartate family
amino acids, and that as a consequence, the contribution
of E. coli aspartate kinases I, II and III is insignificant,
probably due to complete inhibition/repression under
these conditions.

Discussion
Transcription of ectoine genes in M. halophilus and
recombinant E. coli DH5α
Data on transcription regulation are still rare for halophilic eubacteria, but have been investigated in detail for
the Gram-positive non-halophilic model organism Bacil-

lus subtilis, and, of course, E. coli. Transcription of genes
essential for cell survival during exponential growth is
controlled by the primary sigma factors σA and σ70, respectively, which recognize a promoter consensus sequence
comprising a -35 region TTGACA, a spacer of 16–18
nucleotides and a -10 region TATAAT [25]. Of the three
σA/σ70 promoters identified in this study, only the one
upstream of ectB (ATGACA-N18-TATTAT) had previously
been identified by Louis & Galinski [7], because the other
two (TTGAAA-N17-TAAGCT and TCGACT-N17-TATGAT)
deviated by 4 and 3 nucleotides, respectively, from the
consensus sequence.
General stress response, on the other hand, is mediated by
the alternative sigma factor σB in Bacillus subtilis (among
other Gram-positive bacteria) and σS in E. coli [29,30]. For

σB-dependent promoters a -35 region GTTTAA and a -10
region GGGTAT, separated by a spacer of 12–14 nucleotides, have been proposed [31]. For σS-dependent promoters in E. coli Espinosa-Urgel et al. [32] proposed a -10
region CTATACT, which is only slightly different from the
-10 region recognized by σ70. A conserved -35 region
could not be defined so far, but an intrinsic curvature in
this region is proposed to compensate for it. Due to these
marked differences it is rather unlikely that a genuine σBdependent promoter of a Gram-positive bacterium
should be recognized by the Gram-negative E. coli.
In earlier work Louis and Galinski [7] could not resolve
the question whether the three ectoine biosynthetic genes
(ectA, ectB, ectC) are transcribed separately or as a single
operon. Using the RACE method we have now shown that
they are transcribed both as single genes and as mRNA's
comprising ectAB, ectBC and possibly ectABC in M. halophilus (not shown). Heterologous expression of the
ectoine gene cluster in E. coli, also resulted in single and
double gene mRNA products.
We have shown here the successful expression of the
ectoine biosynthesis genes ectA, ectB and ectC (as well as
ectAB and ectBC) from the Gram-positive M. halophilus in
the Gram-negative E. coli. This is explained by recognition
of all three σA-dependent promoters preceeding individual genes of the ectoine biosynthesis gene cluster of M.
halophilus. Due to the conformity of the consensus
sequence of σA- and σ70-dependent promoters this result
is not surprising. In addition to the σA-dependent promoters, a σB-dependent promoter for the transcription of
ectAB (and possibly ectABC) could be characterized
upstream of ectA, suggesting that transcription of the single and the multiple gene products is initiated via different
regulatory mechanisms in the donor M. halophilus. This
promoter recognition sequence (GTTTGT-N13-AGGTAT)
deviates by 3 nucleotides from the consensus sequence
and had, therefore, previously not been recognized by
Louis and Galinski [7]. A potential σB-dependent promoter 280 bp upstream of ectA, which was proposed by
Louis and Galinski [7], is apparently not involved in the
regulation of transcription of ectoine genes under the
experimental conditions employed. Use of the σBdependent promoter by recombinant E. coli was neither
demonstrated nor to be expected. Due to the similarity of
the σS-dependent -10 region CTATACT to a σ70-dependent
promoter, it cannot be stated without further investigation, e.g. by sigma-factor binding studies, whether transcription of ectoine biosynthetic genes in E. coli is under
control of σ70, σS or an interplay of both. In addition it has
already been shown in several studies that σ70-dependent
promoters could also be recognized by σS [33,34], and a
regulatory interplay of σ70 and σS, based on changes in

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/12

binding affinity affected by global regulatory factors, was
proposed [35,36].
Recent work on Bacillus pasteurii has shown that the
ectABC genes are organised in a single operon in this
organism. Expression of ectoine genes was only observed
when cells were grown at elevated osmolarity and a single
gene transcript (2.6 kb) and a typical σA-dependent promotor region were identified [37]. Unfortunately upshock
experiments were not conducted, hence the possibility
still remains that an additional stress response promoter
(σB-dependent) may also be involved in the organism's
short-term adaptation. In contrast to B. pasteurii (a halotolerant species) M. halophilus is a true halophile with a
growth optimum at around 2 M salt. It is therefore not
surprising that its salt stress response strategies are apparently more complex.
In a comprehensive promoter analysis of the ectoine gene
cluster in Chromohalobacter salexigens (member of the
Halomonadaceae) four putative transcription initiation
sites were identified, at 44, 96, 134 and 149 bp upstream
of the ectA start codon. Two of these were of the σ70-type,
one probably σS and a fourth promoter with no similarity
to known sigma factors. Consequently, the authors concluded the existence of a complex regulation pattern of
ectoine synthesis in this true halophile [38].
The observation of osmoregulated ectoine production in
E. coli DH5α pOSM12 could of course result from posttranscriptional regulation, including for example controlled uptake and/or excretion. However, as both transport
systems for ectoine (ProP and ProU) are functional in E.
coli DH5α pOSM12 and ectoine was not detected in the
medium (at 10 μM sensitivity), we propose that ectoine
synthesis is, at least partly, controlled at the level of
enzyme activity. Still, the inability of E. coli DH5α pOSM2
to transcribe ectA and ectAB in the absence of IPTG and
ectAB even under IPTG-induction, as well its impaired
ectoine production, stresses the importance of the DNA
region upstream of ectA (ectUp) for controlled expression
of the ectoine biosynthesis genes. A transcriptional fusion
of this promoter region (ectUp) with the reporter gene gfp
was shown to be osmotically induced in E. coli and, more
importantly, down-regulated in the presence of externally
supplied compatible solutes [39]. The promoter region
upstream of ectA, therefore, appears to sense a regulatory
signal, apparently common for both the Gram-positive M.
halophilus and the Gram-negative E. coli.
Opening up of a metabolic bottle-neck for ectoine
production
Successful heterologous expression of the ectoine biosynthetic genes from the halophilic M. halophilus in E. coli
XL1-Blue by Louis and Galinski [7] enabled us for the first

Saline Systems 2008, 4:12

time to utilize genetically engineered strains for ectoine
production. However, as E. coli XL1-Blue in medium
MM63 displayed a narrow salinity range (1–3% NaCl)
and growth rates were by a factor of 2–5 lower than with
DH5α, experiments in this study were conducted with E.
coli DH5α. The pivotal role of E. coli aspartate kinases as a
limiting metabolic bottle-neck had been realised before,
as shown by the use of E. coli feedback-insensitive aspartate kinase to enhance threonine production in transgenic
alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) [40]. The data presented here
prove that stringent feedback-regulation and/or transcriptional repression of the aspartate kinases in E. coli is in fact
also the main limiting factor for recombinant ectoine production in this host.
When growth rates of E. coli DH5α pAKECT1 are compared to those of the control which accumulates ectoine
from the medium (Fig. 5), one can see that the ectoinesynthesizing construct has a 40% lower growth rate at 2%
and 3% NaCl. This difference may be explained by energy
requirements and side-effects of a deregulated amino acid
metabolism within the aspartate family. However, as this
difference is diminished at higher salinities and completely abolished at 5% NaCl, one may conclude that, at
the upper range of salt tolerance, ectoine production in
the genetically engineered strain is equally efficient as
ectoine uptake and that growth-limitations caused by
overexpression of foreign genes and overproduction of
aspartate family amino acids become less important.
As highest cytoplasmic ectoine concentrations (0.4 mmol
(g dry weight)-1) were already achieved at a medium salinity of only 3% NaCl, this could be seen as an opportunity
for ectoine production at comparatively low salt concentrations and relatively high growth rate (μ = 0.21, td = 3.3
h) [41]. Louis and Galinski [7] have previously reported
similar cytoplasmic ectoine levels (0.38 mmol (g dry
weight)-1) in recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue (containing
plasmid pOSM11) at 3% NaCl. This strain however has a
much lower growth rate (approx. 0.1) under the same
conditions and appears to experience other growth-limiting restrictions. In order to improve the space-time yield
of heterologous ectoine production even further, future
work will address the option to combine the ectoine biosynthetic gene cluster with its corresponding genuine
aspartate kinase from M. halophilus. The chances are that
this enzyme will be feed-back regulated and/or transcriptionally repressed when osmotic equilibrium is achieved.
Unfortunately, this postulated gene has so far not been
identified in M. halophilus.
Co-expression of ectoine biosynthetic genes from M. halophilus and feedback-insensitive aspartate kinase from C.
glutamicum MH20-22B in E. coli DH5α pAKECT1 resulted
in strongly elevated ectoine levels, which correlated with

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/12

the levels obtained when ectoine was accumulated from
the growth medium (0.4 mmol (g dry weight)-1). A most
important observation during all our studies with E. coli
DH5α pAKECT1 was that ectoine levels increased only up
to 3% NaCl (as in accumulating cells) and that ectoine
was not detected in the growth medium at the end of the
experiments. In case of unregulated synthesis an efflux of
the overproduced ectoine via mechanosensitive channels
(Msc) would have been conceivable [42-44]. The above
conclusion appears to stand in contrast to the findings by
Schubert et al. [45] who demonstrated continuous excretion of ectoine from a transgenic E. coli. The authors introduced the ectoine gene cluster from Chromohalobacter
salexigens (devoid of the promoter region) into E. coli
DH5α under the control of a tet promoter. Following a
high-cell density fermentation to 20 g L-1 (cell dry weight)
and subsequent induction, they observed continuous
excretion of ectoine at a rate of 2 mg g-1 h-1, while the cellular level of ectoine stayed low (5 mg (g dry weight)-1).
Such a low leakage rate would not have been detected
under the low-cell density conditions employed here.
Another experimental difference of the work reported
here, besides the different origin of the genes, is transcriptional control by the orginal promoter region (ectUp) and
use of growth conditions, under which compatible solute
uptake systems are activated.
It is intriguing that ectoine levels were nearly identical in
accumulating cells with ectoine in the growth medium,
and in synthesizing cells harbouring pAKECT1. The only
viable conclusion seems to be that heterologously
expressed ectoine biosynthetic enzymes of M. halophilus
are, according to osmotic needs, tuned and regulated in
the phylogenetically distant host E. coli. This phenomenon may be explained by allosteric regulation of gene
products at the level of enzyme activity, caused by yet
unkown general osmotic response mechanisms shared by
a large range of different bacteria.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated that a metabolic bottleneck for ectoine production in the non-halophilic recombinant E. coli DH5α can be relieved by coexpression of a
deregulated aspartate kinase from C. glutamicum, and in
doing so we paved the way for alternative, economically
viable production methods. The surprising observation,
however, that heterologous expression of the ectoine biosynthetic genes does not lead to overproduction in the
host under the conditions employed, stresses the need to
investigate regulatory mechanisms at enzyme level in
order to disclose the biochemical signal which indicates
osmotic balance to the cell.

aerobically at 37°C either in Antibiotic Medium No.3
(Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) or in minimal medium MM63
[46] with 3.0 ml L-1 vitamin solution [47] and 1–5%
NaCl. For selection of cells harbouring the plasmid
pHSG575 [24] or derivatives, chloramphenicol was added
to the medium at a final concentration of 25 μg ml-1. For
supplementation experiments, the medium MM63 with
3% NaCl contained 1 mM L-lysine, L-threonine, Lmethionine, L-aspartic acid or fumaric acid. For induction
of the lac and tac promoter on plasmid pOSM2 and
pAKECT1, respectively, the medium contained 1 mM
IPTG. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 g;
4°C) and freeze-dried.
Plasmid pRK1 containing the gene lysC from Corynebacterium glutamicum MH20-22B was kindly provided by
Lothar Eggeling (FZ Jülich, Germany). Plasmids pOSM2
and pOSM12, comprising vector pHSG575 and DNA fragments encoding the ectoine gene cluster, were isolated
from E. coli XL1-Blue pOSM2 and pOSM12 [7,24,48].
Northern analysis
Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells
using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) according to the recommendation of
the manufacturer. Northern blots were performed following standard methods [49], except for using DIG-labeled
RNA probes, produced with the DIG RNA Labeling Kit
(Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), at 68°C for prehy-

bridisation and hybridisation. After blocking the membrane and binding of anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase
conjugate (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) to the DIGlabeled RNA, chemoluminescence of CDP-Star™ (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) was detected by exposure
of the membrane to a chemiluminescence film.
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
Identification of putative transcription initiation sites was
performed by RACE, according to the method of Bertoli
and Burrows [50], using 5 μg isolated total RNA and the
first strand reverse transcription primers (RT primers) and
PCR primers shown in Table 2. The amplified cDNA ends
were cloned into the plasmid pGEM®-T (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and sequenced by GATC (Koblenz,
Germany). Each of the identified transcription initiation
sites was confirmed in three independent experiments.
DNA manipulation
Plasmid isolation from E. coli was performed using the
GFX™ Micro Plasmid Prep Kit (Amersham, Braunschweig,
Germany). DNA fragments were isolated from agarose
gels with the Silica Spin Fragment DNA Kit (Biometra,
Göttingen, Germany). Restriction digests, ligations and
PCR reactions were performed according to the recommendations of the enzyme manufacturer (New England
Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany). Transformation of E. coli
was carried out by the calcium chloride/rubidium chloride method [51,52]. Sequencing was performed by GATC
(Konstanz, Germany).
Construction of the plasmid pAKECT1
The construction of plasmid pAKECT1 (Fig. 7) was performed in three steps. First the ectC DNA sequence was
amplified from the plasmid pOSM12 using PCR primers,
which created an additional XmaI restriction site upstream
and additional BamHI, ClaI and SalI restriction sites
downstream of ectC. After subcloning into the vector
pGEM-T® (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and sequencing, XmaI- and SalI-digested ectC was ligated to XmaI- and
SalI-digested pHSG575 [24]. In a second step the DNA
fragment of plasmid pRK1 (Fig. 7), containing lysC under
the control of a tac promoter and lacIq, was ligated to this
plasmid downstream of ectC, using ClaI and BamHI

restriction sites. From the resulting intermediate plasmid
a DNA fragment, containing the genes lysC and lacIq, was
re-cut by BamHI- and SpeI-digest and ligated to BamHIand SpeI-digested pOSM12 (Fig. 7).
The ectoine gene cluster in pAKECT1 is under the control
of its own regulatory promoter region (ectUp), whereas
lysC is under the control of a tac promoter. Consequently,
we were able to separately induce ectoine synthesis via
osmotic stress and deregulated aspartate kinase activity via
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
Analytical Methods
Approx. 30 mg of freeze-dried cell material from an exponentially growing shaking culture (medium MM63) was
used for the extraction of intracellular solutes according to
a modification of the method of Bligh and Dyer [53] with
methanol/chloroform/water (10:5:4) as described previously [54]. The cell extracts were analysed by isocratic
HPLC using a GromSil® aminopropyl column (Grom,
Herrenberg, Germany) and acetonitrile/water (75:25 v/v)
at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 as the mobile phase. For 13CNMR analysis of cell extracts 1.5 g freeze-dried cell material was processed as above. The polar phase was evaporated to dryness at 70°C and dissolved in 1 ml D2O
supplemented with 10 mg 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic
acid sodium salt (TMSP) as an internal reference and 30 μl
acetonitrile as internal standard. 1H -decoupled 13C-NMR
spectra relative to TMSP were recorded in pulsed Fouriertransform (FT) mode on a Bruker ARX 400 spectrometer
operating at 100.62 MHz (13C) and 400 MHz for the proton channel.
Enzyme assays
Aspartate kinase was assayed in extracts of cells resuspended in 50 mM (NH4)2SO4, 50 mM triethanolamine, 5
mM dithioerythritol, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5 according to the
method described by Black and Wright [55]. The assay
mixture was composed of 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 14.5
mM ATP, 42 mM MgCl2, 431 mM (NH4)2SO4, 613 mM
NH2OH·HCl, 95 mM sodium L-aspartate and 125 μl of
extract in a total volume of 1.2 ml. After incubation at
30°C for 30 minutes the reaction was stopped by the
addition of 600 μl 3.8% (w/v) FeCl3. 6H2O and 5.8%
trichloroacetic acid in 1.4 M HCl. After centrifugation the
absorbance of the assay mixture at 546 nm was measured
and compared to a calibration curve obtained with aspartyl hydroxamate. Total protein concentrations were determined using the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) Protein Assay
Kit (Pierce, Rockford, USA) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.
