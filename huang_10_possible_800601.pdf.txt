Abstract
Background: Yersinia enterocolitica is an enteric pathogen that invades the intestinal mucosa and proliferates
within the lymphoid follicles (Peyer’s patches). The attachment invasion locus (ail) mediates invasion by
Y. enterocolitica and confers an invasive phenotype upon non-invasive E. coli; ail is the primary virulence factor of
Y. enterocolitica. The ferrioxamine receptor (foxA) located on the Y. enterocolitica chromosome, together with its
transport protein, transports a siderophore specific for ferric ion. Currently, ail is the primary target gene for nucleic
acid detection of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica.
Results: The genes ail and foxA in 271 pathogenic and 27 non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains isolated from China
and 10 reference strains were sequenced, aligned, compared to the ail and foxA sequences of Yersinia enterocolitica
subsp. enterocolitica 8081 (Genbank: NC_008800), and analyzed for sequence polymorphism. The ail from the 282 strains
showed 3 sequence patterns: 277 strains of serotypes O:3, O:9 and O:5, 27 with identical nucleic acid sequences formed
pattern A1; 4 strains of serotype 1B/O:8 with identical nucleic acid sequences formed pattern A2; and one Chinese
isolate 2/O:9 formed pattern A3. In the primary coding region of the foxA ORF (Genebank: X60447 nt 433-1866; nt 28 to
1,461 in the ORF), the sequences formed 3 groups and were further divided into 8 sequence patterns.
Conclusion: The ail and foxA loci of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica have been analyzed. The ail sequence was highly
conserved among the same serotype strains from different sources; and foxA was highly conserved among the
pathogenic strains, although there was some sequence diversity. Fewer strains were used from outside China,
which is a limitation of the study.

Background
Yersinia enterocolitica is a food-borne pathogen [1] that
causes a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes. A primary
characteristic of the microorganism is that it penetrates
the intestinal epithelial cells and replicates in lymphatic
nodules, causing a wide variety of clinical and immunological manifestations [2-4]. All pathogenic Y. enterocolitica
strains harbor ail, which is different from the inv sequence
(which encodes a protein of similar function), and renders
Y. enterocolitica capable of invading the intestinal epithelium. In addition, the Ail protein confers a serum resistance phenotype on Y. enterocolitica [5]. In contrast to inv,

which exists in non-pathogenic as well as pathogenic
strains of Y. enterocolitica, ail only exists in Y. enterocolitica strains epidemiologically related to human disease [6],
and is therefore an important virulence marker. Environmental isolates not associated with disease have a nonfunctional inv and no ail [7].
Ferric ion uptake is essential for bacterial growth
and survival. The supply of iron and production of the siderophore transport system is a central factor in infections
with Yesinia pestis and Y. enterocolitica. Pathogenic
Y. enterocolitica can be divided into 2 groups, those producing the siderophore, such as biotype 1B/O:8, and those
producing no siderophore, as in serotypes O:3 and O:9 [8];
the latter take up ferric ion using ectogenic siderophores,
such as ferrioxamin B and ferrioxamin E [9]. The 2 groups
have different ferric ion uptake abilities, which may explain
the differences in virulence among serotypes [10]. A 77 kDa
receptor on the Y. enterocolitica outer membrane [11]

combines with ferrioxamin to take up ferric ion rapidly [12].
This process is energy-dependent and requires the action of
the TonB protein, part of a complex known as the Ton system. This complex undergoes a conformational change driven by the proton motive force (PMF), which interacts with
the outer membrane receptors and activates transport [13].
The FoxA receptor of Y. enterocolitica, the ferrochrome
receptor and the TonB-dependent receptor share high
amino acid homology [14,15]. The foxA was chosen for
study because it exists in all Y. enterocolitica strains.
Using polymorphic gene analysis, we show that combined detection of ail and foxA confirms the identity of
pathogenic Y. enterocolitica.

PCR, DNA sequencing and sequence analysis

Bacteria were cultured as previously described [18].
The bacterial DNA was extracted using a Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, USA). PCR was performed in a 200
μl volume containing 10 ng DNA template, 5U Taq
DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, China), 0.2 mM of each
dNTP, 1 μM of each forward and reverse primer, 1.5
mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.3). Thermal cycling was done in a MJ PTC200 (BioRad, USA) and the conditions were: one cycle of denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of
melting at 94°C for 15 s, annealing for 30 s at various
temperatures depending on the primers used (Table 3),
elongation at 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension at
72°C for 10 min. Five microliters of PCR product was
electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel image
was captured using a Gel Documentation 2000 (BioRad, USA).
The specific PCR products were purified using a Gel
Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, USA) and sequenced using an
ABI PRISM® BigDyeTM Terminator cycle sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit with AmpliTag DNA Polymerase,
following the manufacturer’s instructions, and an ABI
PRISM® 377XL DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) at TaKaRa Biotechnology
(Dalian) Co., Ltd. The sequences were aligned with the
reference sequences. Nucleotide sequence alignments
and cluster tree construction were performed using
Clustal X (Version 1.8) and MEGA (Version 4).

Methods
Bacterial strains and identification of biotype and
serotype

We chose 271 pathogenic and 27 non-pathogenic
Y. enterocolitica strains isolated from diarrhea patients,
animals, food and the environment in China. They
included 205 strains of serotype O:9, 72 of serotype O:3,
10 of serotype O:8, 5 of serotype O:5, 3 of serotype O:6,
30 and 3 of undetermined serotype (Table 1), together
with 11 reference strains from Europe, the United States
and Japan (Table 2). The serotypes, biotypes and pathogenesis of these strains were determined as previously
described [16-18].
Primer nucleotide sequences

The primers for ail and foxA were designed in our
laboratory, referencing sequences from GenBank (ail:
M29945, foxA: X60447), and synthesized by Shanghai
Sangon Biological Engineering & Technology and Service Co., Ltd, China. The primers for ail amplify
the entire ORF, while those for foxA amplify the ORF
coding region from nt 28 to nt 1,461 (Table 3).

a cleavage site between residues 23 and 24, where the
first 23 amino acids act as a signal sequence [19].
foxA has an ORF of 2,129 bp encoding a protein of
710 amino acids, MW: 78,565 Da. The first 26 amino
acids are a signal sequence, and a mature protein of 684
aa, MW: 75,768 Da, is formed after cleavage [14]. There
is a sequence ahead of foxA with homology to the putative ferric ion uptake regulator (Fur) of Yersinia [21].
The expression of foxA may be regulated by iron via the
Fur protein, as in other known siderophore receptors
[14]. Fur may be a transcription inhibition protein acting on the ferric regulation promoter using Fe2+-dependent DNA binding activity homologous to that in E. coli
[22-25].
Analysis of ail

The entire ail ORF for 271 pathogenic Y. enterocolitica
strains isolated from China and 10 reference strains
were analyzed and compared to strain 8081. The data
showed that all the strains can be divided into 3
sequence patterns. The Chinese isolates, 270 strains (70
of serotype O:3 and 200 of serotype O:9) and 7 reference strains (5 of O:3, one of O:9 and one of O:5,27),
were sequentially identical and formed pattern A1. Four
highly pathogenic strains of serotype 1B/O:8 showed
identical sequences and formed pattern A2. Compared

to pattern A1, pattern A2 showed 21 base mutations
among which 9 were sense and 12 were nonsense mutations. In addition, one pathogenic Chinese isolate O:9
serotype (isolated from the tongue of a rat in Ningxia,
1997) showed 3 base mutations compared to the entire
ail of pattern A1, one sense and 2 nonsense; it formed
pattern A3 (Fig. 1). This new ail genotype was submitted to Genbank and given the accession number
GU722202.
Analysis of foxA

Analysis of the primary coding region of foxA from nt
28 to nt 1,461 in 271 pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains
isolated from China and 11 reference strains showed
that all the strains can be divided into 3 groups including 8 sequence patterns (Fig. 2). Group I comprised patterns F1, F2 and F3 and included 201 serotype O:9
strains isolated from China and 2 reference strains (one
strain O:9 and one O:5,27). Among these, 199 strains of
O:9 and 2 reference strains showing identical sequences
formed pattern F1, and 2 other strains of O:9 with 2
and 3 base mutations formed patterns F2 and F3. Group
II comprised patterns F4 and F5, and included 70 Chinese isolates and 5 reference strains of serotype O:3.
Sixty-nine serotype O:3 strains (67 Chinese isolates and2
reference strains) showing identical sequences formed

pattern F4; and 6 other strains of O:3 had one base
mutation and formed pattern F5. Group III comprised
five reference strains including patterns F6, F7 and F8.
Pattern F6 (2 Japanese strains) had 2 base mutations
compared to pattern F7 (52211). Compared to pattern
F7, pattern F8 (8081) had 5 base mutations (Fig. 3).
To analyze foxA polymorphism in Y. enterocolitica
overall, we chose 27 strains of non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica as controls (Table 1). The results showed 13

sequence patterns for the 27 strains with 10’s to 100’s
more polymorphic sites and no apparent regularity. This
indicated that foxA was less polymorphic and more conserved in pathogenic strains than in non-pathogenic
strains.

Discussion
Only pathogenic Y. enterocolitica contains ail, which
confers a bacterial invasion and serum resistance

Huang et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:211

phenotype, that is an important virulence marker on the
chromosome [6,19]. The entire ORF of ail was
sequenced and analyzed from strains from different
sources and biotypes and serotypes. The data showed
that the 282 pathogenic Y. enterocolitica formed 3
sequence patterns (Fig. 1); the strains were pathogenic
O:3 and O:9 isolated from various hosts in China and
the reference strains. Only one Chinese isolate formed
pattern A3, a new ail genotype submitted to Genbank
and given the GenBank accession number GU722202.
When it was compared to the sequence of pattern A1,
three base mutations were found, one sense and two
nonsense. We presume that pathogenic Y. enterocolitica
had 2 original ail patterns, A1 represented in serotypes
O:3 and O:9 and A2 represented in bio-serotype 1B/O:8;
pattern A3 may be a mutation of A1. Pathogenic
Y. enterocolitica can be divided into a high-pathogenicity
group (Y. enterocolitica biogroup 1B) and a low-pathogenicity group (Y. enterocolitica biogroups 2 to 5) on
the basis of the lethal infectious dose in the mouse
model [26]. The typing of ail in this study is consistent
with this grouping of pathogenic strains. Therefore, we
presumed that lethality in mice (50% lethal dose <1,000
microorganisms) not only depends on the presence of
the yersiniabactin (ybt) locus, which carries the genes
for biosynthesis, transport and regulation of the siderophore yersiniabactin [8,27-29], but is also closely related
to the ail sequence. We conjecture that synergism with
ail is necessary for Y. enterocolitica pathogenesis.
ail is not only an important virulence gene for pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, but also harbors highly conserved
sequences, mutation of which may change the virulence
of the bacterium. For instance, in the 1B/O:8 strain,
which is highly lethal to mice, the ail belongs to pattern
A2, while ail in other pathogenic bioserotype strains
belongs to pattern A1. So we believe that a change in
ail is closely related to the pathogenesis of the strain. A
pathogenic O:9 strain isolated from Cricetulus triton in
Ningxia contains ail pattern A3, the sequence of which
has 3 site mutations, only one being a sense mutation.
Further study is needed to see whether amino acid
change alters the function of Ail protein or bacterial
virulence.
Analysis of the 1,434 base pairs of the foxA primary
coding region showed that the foxA sequence correlated
with the biotype and serotype of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica. Comparing the primary sequences of groups I and
II, 13 base mutations at fixed positions were found; 5
were sense and 8 were nonsense mutations, indicating
that the primary difference in the pathogenic Y. enterocolitica foxA was located in these 13 sites. Strain 8081
showed 26 base mutations compared to F1 and 31 compared to F4. From these findings we presume that
pathogenic O:3 and O:9 have similar foxA sequences

Page 6 of 7

(Fig. 2) and mutation sites additional to strain 8081 bioserotype 1B/O:8 (Fig. 3). Thus, there is a correlation
between pathogenesis and the different bio-serotypes of
Y. enterocolitica. More mutation sites and no obvious
regulation were found in non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica foxA, although some strains showed an identical
foxA sequence type (Fig. 2). The identical sequence patterns of the pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains isolated
from different areas, at different times and from different host sources show the foxA sequence pattern to be
closely correlated to pathogenesis. Unfortunately, fewer
strains from outside China were used, which is a limitation of the study and needs adding strains for future
study.
ail is a primary marker for pathogenic Y. enterocolitica
and is an important tool for detecting it, making it a
very important gene to analyze. Some scholars have
established a real-time PCR assay to detect Y. enterocolitica using ail or ystA as the target gene [30-33]. According to the current identification standards, strains having
no ail and harboring ystB isolated from diarrhea
patients are classified as non-pathogenic. However,
other researchers believe that strains harboring ystB are
pathogenic and cause the diarrhea, as inferred from epidemiology and the etiology of disease outbreaks [34,35].
Therefore, it is necessary to detect other conserved
genes as a complement to these markers because reliance on only ail and ystA to detect pathogenesis
remains questionable. We chose to detect foxA, which is
found in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica. The results showed that both ail and foxA were
conserved together in pathogenic strains and can therefore be used to confirm the detection of pathogenic
Y. enterocolitica. Currently, we are attempting to extract
bacterial DNA from clinical specimens to detect foxA in
order to identify Y. enterocolitica directly from humans
and other animals; and we have some preliminary data
(unpublished).
Almost all Y. enterocolitica carry foxA while pathogenic strains carry ail. It is very important for real-time
PCR detection of Y. enterocolitica to study sequence
polymorphism in ail and foxA. It will be helpful to
design specific primers and probes in the conserved
region in order to develop real-time or traditional PCR
methods. We are trying to establish a duplex real-time
PCR to detect Y. enterocolitica from clinical samples
and to confirm its pathogenicity. Designing specific primers for foxA and ail in a combined detection system is
valuable for increasing sensitivity and specificity in the
detection of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica.

Conclusion
Analysis of polymorphisms in ail and foxA of pathogenic
Y. enterocolitica strains from different times and regions

showed ail to be an important virulence gene for pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, and that it has a highly conserved
sequence. The gene encoding the ferrioxamine receptor,
foxA, is also conserved in pathogenic strains, where 2
primary sequence patterns were found. More strains
from outside China are needed for further study.
