Abstract
Background: The human rhinoviruses (HRV) are one of the most common and diverse respiratory pathogens of
humans. Over 100 distinct HRV serotypes are known, yet only 6 genomes are available. Due to the paucity of HRV
genome sequence, little is known about the genetic diversity within HRV or the forces driving this diversity. Previous
comparative genome sequence analyses indicate that recombination drives diversification in multiple genera of the
picornavirus family, yet it remains unclear if this holds for HRV.
Results: To resolve this and gain insight into the forces driving diversification in HRV, we generated a representative set
of 34 fully sequenced HRVs. Analysis of these genomes shows consistent phylogenies across the genome, conserved noncoding elements, and only limited recombination. However, spikes of genetic diversity at both the nucleotide and amino
acid level are detectable within every locus of the genome. Despite this, the HRV genome as a whole is under purifying
selective pressure, with islands of diversifying pressure in the VP1, VP2, and VP3 structural genes and two non-structural
genes, the 3C protease and 3D polymerase. Mapping diversifying residues in these factors onto available 3-dimensional
structures revealed the diversifying capsid residues partition to the external surface of the viral particle in statistically
significant proximity to antigenic sites. Diversifying pressure in the pleconaril binding site is confined to a single residue
known to confer drug resistance (VP1 191). In contrast, diversifying pressure in the non-structural genes is less clear,
mapping both nearby and beyond characterized functional domains of these factors.
Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for understanding HRV genetic diversity and insight into the underlying
biology driving evolution in HRV. It expands our knowledge of the genome sequence space that HRV reference serotypes
occupy and how the pattern of genetic diversity across HRV genomes differs from other picornaviruses. It also reveals
evidence of diversifying selective pressure in both structural genes known to interact with the host immune system and
in domains of unassigned function in the non-structural 3C and 3D genes, raising the possibility that diversification of
undiscovered functions in these essential factors may influence HRV fitness and evolution.

Background
Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are the major cause of the
common cold, accounting for as much as 80% of upper
respiratory infections in the fall cold season (reviewed in
[1]). In the United States, the common cold is estimated
to account for approximately 1 billion upper respiratory
infections per year, 22 million days of missed school, and
$40 billion in direct and indirect costs due to lost work
and productivity [2]. Thus, despite typically presenting as
a mild, self-limited upper respiratory infection, HRVs
exact a significant health and economic burden on society
in general. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that HRV
infections may not always be mild or restricted to the
upper respiratory tract. Results from in vitro and in vivo
experimental studies have demonstrated that HRVs can
both penetrate and damage bronchial epithelial cells in
the lower respiratory tract [3-8]. HRV infections can cause
acute bronchitis in healthy children and adults (especially
the elderly), precipitate exacerbations in patients with
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic
fibrosis, and can lead to fatal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients (reviewed in [9-12]).
Despite the ubiquity of HRV infections among healthy
populations and their potentially severe clinical consequences in vulnerable populations, no preventive or curative therapies are currently available. Development of
such therapies against HRV has in large part been hampered by the great diversity within the HRV genus, and the
fact that multiple serotypes co-circulate during each cold
season. This diversity has been traditionally characterized
via a set of distinct types of phenotypic assays. Antisera
neutralization studies performed in the 1960s to 1970s
identified 102 distinct HRV serotypes [13]. Subsequent
drug susceptibility analysis divided these 102 HRV prototype strains into two major groupings, subgroup A
(HRVA), with 77 serotypes, and subgroup B (HRVB), with
25 serotypes [14]. A single serotype, HRV87, falls into neither of these two groups and is actually more similar to
human enteroviruses (HEVs) than human rhinoviruses
[15,16]. Identification of two cellular receptors for HRV
further divided these serotypes into 2 additional groups
[17,18]: the major cellular receptor (intracellular adhesion molecule 1, ICAM1) group, composed of 90 HRV
serotypes [19,20], and the minor cellular receptor (low
density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR) group, made up of 11
HRV serotypes [21].
More recent molecular genetic analyses of a number of
subgenomic regions of HRV have largely corroborated
these phenotypic classifications of the HRVs [17,22-29].
However, due to the paucity of available HRV genome
sequences, it is unclear how well the diversity detected in
these assays reflects the genome-wide diversity present
among the characterized HRV serotypes. The genomes of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/40

only six HRV serotypes are publicly available (HRV2 [30],
HRV16 [31], HRV1b [32], HRV14 [33,34], HRV89 [35],
and HRV39 [36]). These genome sequences represent
only a small fraction of the HRV genomic sequence space,
and provide limited insight into the genome-wide diversity within this genus, or how this diversity is generated
and continues to propagate from year to year.
Here, we expand this set of 6 fully sequenced HRV
genomes to a more representative set of 34 genomes
through whole genome shotgun sequencing of 27 diverse
HRV reference serotypes and a single clinical isolate of
HRV associated with an outbreak of severe lower respiratory illness in an elder care facility in Santa Cruz, CA [37].
We have used this larger and more diverse set of HRV
genomes to analyze the genome-wide diversity in HRVs
and to determine the selective pressure operating at each
codon of the HRV genome. Mapping these selective pressure data onto available three dimensional HRV protein
structures relative to known functional domains has provided insight into the underlying biology driving evolution of these HRV prototypes and serves as a springboard
for future analyses of novel and currently circulating HRVs
and the drugs developed to inhibit them.

Results
Generation of a representative set of HRV genome
sequences for analysis
In order to obtain an accurate picture of the genetic diversity and selective pressure across the HRV genome, our
first task was to expand the set of 6 fully sequenced HRV
serotypes to a larger set of HRV genomes that more fully
captured the genetic diversity of the known set of 102
serotypes. Since the capsid region has been found to be
the most variable portion of other fully sequenced picornavirus genomes [38,39], we utilized previously generated capsid gene phylogenies of the 102 HRV serotypes
[25,26,28] to identify an additional set of HRV serotypes
that would prove most informative for our analysis. We
identified 28 additional serotypes from across the HRV
gene capsid phylogenies (Additional File 1, Figure S1) that
yielded selective pressure results for the VP1 gene that
were well-correlated with the results obtained from the
full set of 102 HRV serotype VP1 gene sequences (Materials and Methods, Additional file 1, Figure S2). We thus
focused our whole genome shotgun sequence analysis
efforts on recovery of genome sequence from these 28
HRV serotypes. Combined with the 6 previously
sequenced HRV genomes and the rhino/entero HRV87
genome, this provided a larger, more representative set of
35 HRV genomes for further analysis.

Consistent phylogenetic pattern observed at every locus of
the HRV genome
With this expanded set of HRV genomes in hand, we next
examined the agreement between the HRV genomic and
subgenomic phylogenies. Prior comparative sequence
analysis of two other picornaviruses, the human enteroviruses (HEVs) and the Foot-and-Mouth Disease viruses
(FMDVs) have uncovered significant incongruences
between the genomic and subgenomic phylogenies of
these viruses that suggest that recombination plays a significant role in generating diversity in the picornavirus
family [38,40-42]. Comparison of the phylogenies of
more extensively sequenced structural and non-structural
subgenomic regions of the HRV genome have suggested
that similar phylogenetic incongruences may be present
in the HRV genome [25,26,28,29]. However, more recent
analysis of the prior set of 5 fully sequenced HRVA
genomes and a review of the subgenomic data has cast
doubt on these conclusions [43].

Our analysis indicates that the whole genome phylogeny
of HRV is essentially identical to the subgenomic phylogenies derived from every locus of the HRV genome, at
both the nucleotide and amino acid level (Figure 1A;
Additional file 1, Figure S3; Additional file 1, Data S1 and
Data S2). The HRVs separated into two main branches,
HRVA and HRVB, which correlated directly with their
prior classification based on drug susceptibility [14].
Within each of these two major HRV genetic subgroups,
the HRVs further clustered in a manner consistent with
previously described cellular receptor usage [19,20] and
antisera inhibition and cross-neutralization properties
[13]. Consistent with its reclassification as a member of
HEVD, HRV87 clustered more closely with HEVs than
HRVs [28].
Pairwise sequence analysis shows consistent diversity
across the genome
Average pairwise sequence analysis of both the genomic
and subgenomic regions of the HRVA and HRVB genomes
corroborated our phylogenetic findings (Figure 1B),
revealing a consistent level of sequence identity at every
locus of HRV genome (Tables 1 and 2). However, spikes
of genetic diversity were detectable in multiple loci (1B,
1C, 1D, 2C, 3A, 3C, and 3D genes) at both the nucleotide
(Figure 2B) and amino acid level (Figure 2C). These profiles are quite distinct from those previously observed for
other picornaviral genome sequences which display high
diversity in the structural genes and low diversity in the
non-structural genes (Additional file 2, Figure S4 [43]).
This distinct pattern of pairwise sequence identity and the
lack of detectable incongruence between HRV genomic
and subgenomic phylogenies raises the possibility that in
contrast to other picornaviruses, recombination may not
be the major driver of diversification of the HRV genome.

Recombination scan predicts only small, scattered events
in the HRV genome
To directly compare the type and frequency of recombination events in HRV relative to other members of the picornavirus family, we performed a genome-wide scan for
recombination events among the fully sequenced HRV
genomes (Materials and Methods). This analysis identified ten putative recombination events (Additional file 2,
Table S1). However, in contrast to the large-scale single
crossover events that have been previously detected
between the structural and non-structural genes of HEV
and FMDV genomes [38-44], all of the events detected in
the HRV genomes were small in size (average length: 281
bp, range: 84–474 bp) and predicted to result from double crossover events localized mainly in the 5'NCR of the
genome and a few distinct loci scattered throughout the
coding region of the genome (Additional file 2, Table S1).
Thus, the extent and scope of recombination predicted to
have occurred in these representative HRV genomes is
indeed quite different from that seen for HEVs and
FMDVs.
Selective pressure across the human rhinovirus genome
We next investigated how HRV diversity might have arisen
by analyzing the types of evolutionary forces acting on the
HRV genome. We utilized the genome-based HRV phylogeny and the available genome sequences to compute the
ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes (dN/
dS) for each codon in the HRVA and HRVB genomes
(Materials and Methods). Such calculations allowed us to
create selective pressure profiles for the HRVA and HRVB
genomes as a whole, providing an overview of the evolutionary landscape of the HRV genome (Figure 2D).

Overall, we detected similar selective pressure profiles for
the HRVA and HRVB genomes (Figure 2D). Intriguingly,
this selective pressure analysis reveals that a large proportion of the genome is under purifying selective pressure
(82.65% for HRVA and 86.74% for HRVB), exhibiting
codon-specific dN/dS ratios at the lower limits of detection (<0.06), despite the high level of genetic diversity we
detected across the HRV genomes by scanning pairwise
analysis. However, this purifying selective pressure is not
distributed uniformly across the genome. It predominates
in the central region of the genome that includes a set of
non-structural genes (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, and 3B) that interact
with both viral factors and essential host cell factors during the viral replication cycle, and is also detectable across
the majority of the 1A gene, which encodes the VP4 capsid
protein that assembles on the interior side of the viral particle. Interrupting these regions of purifying selective pressure are two major clusters of residues with elevated dN/
dS values: one in a subset of the structural genes (1B, 1C,
and 1D) which lie on the outer surface of the viral capsid,
and another in a pair of the non-structural genes (3C and

To gain insight into the functional significance of these
clusters of diversifying selective pressure detected within

the HRV genome, we next examined how the location of
the clusters of diversifying residues correlated with previously characterized functional and structural domains
within the HRV genome. We first focused on the diversifying structural genes and examined the location of diversifying capsid residues relative to three previously

neutralizing immunogen (NIm) sites, the cellular receptor
contacts, and the binding pocket of pleconaril, a potent
capsid inhibitor of HRVs and HEVs [45].
The diversifying capsid residues are distributed throughout the VP2, VP3, and VP1 capsid genes in generally overlapping positions within the HRVA and HRVB genomes
(Figures 3C and 3D, respectively). Overlap can also be
detected between these diversifying residues and the primary sequence location of a set of empirically determined
NIm sites in HRVA (Figure 3B, [46-50]) and HRVB (Figure
3E, [51,52]). Mapping the HRVA diversifying residues
onto the 3-dimensional structure of the viral pentamer
subunit of the HRV particle revealed that virtually all of
the diversifying capsid residues localize to protrusions or
ridges on the external face of the viral particle (Figure 4).
Direct comparison of the location of the diversifying capsid residues in HRVA and HRVB on the surface of the viral
pentamer demonstrated significant overlap in their three-

dimensional locations (p < 0.00001 Figure 5, inset histogram; Additional file 3, Figure S5, Materials and Methods). Mapping the diversifying capsid residues relative to
the previously defined NIm sites (Figure 6A) and the characterized contacts for the major (ICAM1R, Figure 6B,
[53]) and minor (LDLR, Figure 6C, [54]) cellular receptors
for HRV also revealed detectable overlap with each of
these functional domains of the HRV virion. However,
quantitation of the minimum distances between the
alpha carbons of the diversifying residues and the residues
within each of these functional domains revealed that
only the NIm sites lie within statistically significant proximity to the diversifying capsid residues (p < 0.00001; Figure 6A, inset histogram, Additional file 3, Figure S6).
These results hold even if our analysis is restricted to the
most diversifying capsid residues (Additional file 3, Figure
S7). Thus, the distribution of the diversifying capsid residues in the structural genes are best explained by their
proximity to the NIm sites, indicating that the diversifica-

tion detected in the structural genes of the HRV genome
may be driven in large part by pressure to evade the host
humoral response.
In contrast, analysis of the selective pressure in the capsid
residues within the pleconaril binding site revealed an
overall paucity of diversifying selective pressure (Additional file 3, Table S2). However, one of the residues lining the pleconaril binding site in the VP1 gene (residue
#191) has diversifying selective pressure detectable above
background. Intriguingly, this residue corresponds to one
of two residues in the binding pocket shared among naturally occurring pleconaril resistant HRVB serotypes. When
mutated in a susceptible HRVB serotype, residue #191 has
been shown to confer a 30-fold reduction in pleconaril
susceptibility [55].
Structure-function mapping of diversifying residues in nonstructural genes
Given the essential nature of the functions performed by
the products of the non-structural genes, it was quite surprising to detect a cluster of diversifying selective pressure
within the 3C and 3D genes of the HRV genome. The
wealth of structural and functional observations concerning these two factors allowed for analysis of the correlation in location of diversifying residues relative to the
structural and functional domains previously characterized in each of these two non-structural genes.

The diversifying residues of the 3C protein (Figure 7A)
wrap around the circumference of the protein, along an
axis between its RNA binding/VPg interaction domain
and protease active site. None of the diversifying residues

overlap with the protease active site (Figure 7C) or contacts with the characterized inhibitor, ruprintrivir ([22],
Additional file 4, Table S3). However, approximately half
of the diversifying residues map adjacent to the boundary
of residues implicated in RNA binding/VPg interaction,
with one residue directly overlapping a residue implicated
in VPg binding (Figure 7B, overlapping residue in yellow).
The remaining diversifying residues are present in regions
of the 3C protein that are distant from both the protease
active site and the RNA binding/VPg interaction domain.
The close proximity of a large proportion of the diversifying residues in the 3C protein to the RNA binding/VPg
primer interaction domain raises the possibility that
diversification in the 3C protease may be driven in part by
pressure to modulate the RNA binding or VPg binding
activity during viral replication. However, given our current understanding of the 3C protein, the possible functions of the remaining diversifying sites are less clear.
In the 3D polymerase, a number of diversifying residues
also overlap or lie in close proximity to previously
described functional domains known to influence polymerization activity and catalysis. This is most obvious on
the backside of the polymerase (Figure 8C). Here, a set of
diversifying residues directly overlap with a domain previously implicated in coordinating movements in the
polymerase that are required for catalytic activity or map
nearby the binding domain for VPg, the protein primer for
replication. Overlap was also detected in the thumb
domain (Figures 8A and 8D), with a residue implicated in
forming part of a domain analogous to the Interface I oligomerization domain of the poliovirus 3D polymerase
[56].

A number of diversifying residues were also observed in
regions of the 3D protein for which functional data is
lacking. This is the case for a large set of diversifying residues found to localize to the outer surface of the fingers
subdomain of the polymerase (Figures 8A and 8B). The
role that this large domain plays in polymerase activity is
not completely resolved. Recent work has demonstrated
at least one residue in this domain (the highly conserved
G64) can influence polymerase fidelity [57-60]. However,
because this residue lies distant from the diversifying residues we detect on the surface of the fingers subdomain,
their possible functional significance is unclear. Taken
together, these data indicate, that like the 3C protease,
proximity to characterized functional domains of the 3D
polymerase does fully explain the diversifying pressure
detected in this essential viral factor.

Conservation of non-coding RNAs and essential structural
elements

required for, or enhance viral replication [61]. An essen-

tial cloverleaf structure and internal ribosomal entry site
(IRES) have been identified in the 5' non-coding region of
the genome, while a small hairpin RNA element that
enhances replication has been found in the 3' non-coding
region. An additional essential RNA structure, a small

of each letter is proportional to the fraction of the observed
frequency relative to the expected frequency at each position.

stem-loop cis-acting replication element (CRE) resides
within the coding sequences of the Picornaviridae
genomes.
In our analysis of 34 HRV genome sequences, evidence for
conservation of each of these elements was detected at
both the primary sequence and secondary structure level
(Additional file 4, Data S3 and S4). While these structures
have been inferred previously from phylogenetic comparisons of available HRV genomes [61], our analysis provides a robust HRV consensus structure for each element
in the 5' and 3' non-coding region (Additional file 4, Data
S3 and S4).
Since sequence from all 102 HRV prototypes is available
for regions in which the CREs have been mapped, we uti-

lized the entire set of HRV prototypes to assess the conservation of the HRVA and HRVB CRE sequence and
structure. Within the HRVA genomes, a highly conserved
CRE-like sequence and structure containing a short stem
with a 14 nucleotide loop conforming to the published
CRE loop consensus, R1NNNAAR2NNNNNR3 [62] was
detected in the same location in the P2A gene as the experimentally verified CRE of the HRV2 genome ([63]; Figure
9A, Additional file 4, Figure S8A). This appears to be subgroup-specific, in that a similar sequence or structure is
not detected among the HRVB genomes in this region
(Additional file 4, Fig. S8B). Conversely, a subgroup Bspecific CRE-like sequence and structure can be detected
in the same location in the VP1 gene as the empirically
defined CRE from the HRV14 genome, but not in the
HRVA genomes ([64,65]; Figure 9B, Additional file 4, Figures S8C and S8D). Overall, these elements possess essentially identical structures, with loop sequences that vary
according to HRV subgroup (Figure 9).

Discussion
Here, we have addressed a gap in our understanding of the
evolutionary forces driving diversification of HRV and
deepened our understanding of HRV biology in a number
of ways. First, we have augmented the set of 6 fully
sequenced HRV serotypes to a more representative subset
of 34 genomes from across the HRV phylogeny. Second,
we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the
genetic diversity and evolutionary pressures operating
upon the HRV genus. We have found a uniform pattern of
genetic variability across the genome that is unlikely to be
driven by large-scale recombination events as has been
observed among other genera of the picornavirus family.
We have also obtained a molecular portrait of the HRV
genomic evolutionary landscape, which has revealed clusters of diversifying residues in both structural and nonstructural genes cast against a background of purifying
selective pressure. Finally, we have provided insight into
the possible functional relevance of the detected diversifying pressure in both the structural and non-structural
genes of HRV through comparison of the overlap in these
residues with structural and functional domains previously characterized in HRV.
Correlation in genetic and phenotypic subgroupings of
HRV
Our results indicate that the 2 major genetic subgroups of
HRV correlate directly with phenotypic groupings based
on in vitro studies of HRV susceptibility to a set of early
generation "pocket factor" binding drugs that interact
with the capsid gene products of the virus [14]. This puzzling correlation between pocket factor susceptibility and
the genetic relationships of non-structural genes in HRV
was first noted almost 20 years ago in the original drug
susceptibility study when only a limited set of non-struc-

Virology Journal 2007, 4:40

tural gene sequences were available [14]. More recent subgenomic sequence analyses have largely corroborated
these findings [25,26,28]. Here, we extend these results to
every locus of the HRV genome.
In general, this observation has been somewhat difficult
to understand since these drugs could not have shaped
HRV evolution, given that they have not been commonly
used to treat viral infections in general, or HRV infections
in particular. Our results provide a possible explanation.
Because there is a consistent level of sequence diversity
across the HRV genome, each locus in the genome possesses a genetic relationship identical to that of the structural genes targeted by the drug. Thus, the correlation
between genotype and drug susceptibility phenotype is
easily detectable at each loci in the genome, regardless of
its potential to interact directly with the drug.
Recombination and diversification in the HRV genome
Our analysis has also revealed a lack of significant recombination within the HRV genome that is surprising in light
of the fact that multiple serotypes that utilize the same cellular receptor are known to co-circulate during each HRV
season [66]. Moreover, this is also quite distinct from
what has been observed for other genera in the Picornaviridae family, where recombination has been proposed to
play a significant role in genetic diversification (reviewed
in [39]). Taken together, our results favor the possibility
that genetic drift is likely to be the major driving force for
diversification in the HRV genus. These conclusions
extend and agree with the recent work of Simmonds [43].
It would appear that the known HRV isolates act as independently segregating genomes, with little potential for
inter-genome recombination, in contrast to the non-segregating, highly recombinant genomes such as HEV,
FMDV, the teschoviruses, and bovine enteroviruses.

Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that there is a biological compatibility barrier for recombination among
HRV serotypes, since experimental evidence has demonstrated recombinants from similarly diverged picornaviruses tend to be inviable (reviewed in [39]). It is also
possible that there may be additional barriers related to
the characteristics of HRV infection (intracellular partitioning, persistence time in the cell, viral titer, blocks to
co-infection, etc) that might preclude the opportunity for
recombination to occur. With a diverse array of HRV
genome sequences in hand, such hypotheses can now be
directly tested.
Purifying selective pressure dominates in the HRV genome
Despite a notoriously error-prone polymerase and a significant amount of genetic diversity across the HRV
genome, our selective pressure analysis indicates that
overall, the HRV genome is under strong pressure to pre-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/40

serve the amino acid sequences encoded within genome.
This sort of profile is not unique to HRV, since a similar
bias towards purifying selection has been detected in
selective pressure analysis of the capsid region of FMDV
field isolates [67]. A preponderance of purifying selective
pressure is particularly obvious for the central region of
the genome encoding the non-structural P2 gene products
(P2A protease, P2B 'viroporin', and P2C ATPase and
membrane association factor) and the 3A and 3B gene
products. Each of these viral gene products is known to
proteolyze or to interact with essential cellular factors,
which are highly conserved. Thus, it may be that the lifecycle of HRV and its requirement to interact with and
inactivate a variety of host factors results in significant
sequence constraints within this portion of the genome.
Although these results may appear to contradict recent
studies demonstrating that at least one Picornaviridae family member, poliovirus, evolves through quasispeciation
[68], they actually do not rule out a similar process occurring in HRV. Rather, our results reflect the overall selective
pressure acting on the HRV genome derived from the consensus sequences generated from our shotgun assemblies,
and we have not focused on the potential minority polymorphisms that may exist within the population of each
of the HRV prototypes. Inspection of each of our shotgun
assemblies does reveal high quality sequence polymorphisms in a minority of the shotgun reads throughout the
assembled genomes (data not shown). However, a greater
depth of sequencing for each isolate would be required to
unambiguously address the extent of HRV quasispeciation.
Implications of diversifying selective pressure in the
structural genes
Although we detected overlap with each of the functional
domains found on the viral particle, the diversifying capsid residues overlap significantly only with previously
identified antigenic sites from both the HRVA and HRVB
genomes. This result is intriguing in light of the variability
in genetic diversity and serotype diversity known to exist
in some of the Picornaviridae family members, such as the
FMDVs and HEVs. The FMDVs are similar to HRVs, in that
over 100 distinct serotypes have also been identified [38].
These observations suggest that the icosahedral viral particle of these picornaviruses is relatively flexible, and is
able to accommodate a wide array of non-synonymous
changes. However, this immunogenic diversity is not generally shared among the capsids of all Picornaviridae family members. In particular, poliovirus has only 3
characterized serotypes. Moreover, recent analysis of vaccine-derived poliovirus isolates indicates that many of the
most frequent non-synonymous changes which develop

Page 12 of 19

Virology Journal 2007, 4:40

in the capsid genes do not alter the immunogenicity of the
virus, despite being present in antigenic determinants
[69]. It is unclear if these results are unique to poliovirus
or extend to other picornaviruses.
This is particularly relevant for our analysis, since we were
unable to explain all of the diversifying selective pressure
by direct overlap with antigenic sites on the surface of the
viral pentamer. While many of our diversifying residues
map within close proximity to these NIms, it is unclear if
diversification of sites proximal to NIms actually alters
their antigenicity. Such questions are difficult to resolve at
this time, since the known antigenic determinants of HRV
have been identified through sequence analysis of HRVs
able to escape neutralization of a limited set of monoclonal antibodies raised against only 2 of the 102 HRV
serotypes [46-52]. Thus, a more complete understanding
of the statistically significant proximity detected here
between diversifying capsid residues and the NIms awaits
more comprehensive characterization of additional distinct antigenic sites on the HRV capsid.
Although not statistically significant, a surprising amount
of overlap was also detected between the diversifying capsid residues and the characterized HRV cellular receptor
contacts. Whether diversification of in these residues actually alters the functionality of these domains in the capsid,
or merely reflects as-yet undiscovered functions, or
regions of the HRV capsid that are under immune surveillance is unclear from these observations. However, it has
been established that important functional domains in
viruses are not excluded from immune surveillance, and
that mutations within antigenic targets that overlap functional domains can abolish antibody interaction with little or no impact on interactions required in the functional
domain (reviewed in [70]). Whether such observations
also apply to this set of diversifying residues requires a
more comprehensive understanding of both the antigenic
determinants of the HRV capsid as well as the binding
affinities to the HRV cellular receptors across different
HRV serotypes.
Implications of diversifying selective pressure in the nonstructural genes
Perhaps one of the most surprising results from this analysis was the detection of clusters of diversifying residues
within two non-structural genes that perform essential
functions during viral replication. Why did we detect any
diversifying residues in these genes? We attempted to
investigate this question through similar mapping of the
location of the diversifying residues onto available crystal
structures of the 3C protease and 3D polymerase. As was
observed for the diversifying capsid residues, the diversifying residues in both the 3C protease and 3D polymerase
map to surface-exposed residues; however, here we

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/40

observed less of a bias towards a particular location or
functional domain on the surface of each of these factors.
We did detect a large proportion of the diversifying residues in the 3C protease and 3D polymerase positioned in
the vicinity of characterized domains that are likely to
influence RNA/VPg primer binding (for 3C protease) or
hypothesized oligomerization domain interactions, protein binding and/or the coordination of subdomain
movements that have been hypothesized to influence catalytic activity (for 3D polymerase).
However, the remaining fraction of the diversifying residues within these non-structural genes map to regions in
each of these factors for which functions have not yet been
assigned. We have not detected a correlation between the
3C protease and 3D polymerase diversifying residues with
MHC class I presenting peptides detectable in 3C and 3D.
Likewise, we were also unable to detect any correlation
between variation in electrostatic potential on the surface
of the 3C protease and 3D polymerase, or significant covariation with any other diversifying residues in the
genome. Thus, the role these diversifying residues may
play in specific functions of the 3C protease and 3D
polymerase, or in overall viral fitness, requires further
exploration.
Such studies are particularly relevant given recent discoveries highlighting our incomplete knowledge of the functional domains within these two factors. Recently, a
previously uncharacterized region of the poliovirus 3D
polymerase lying outside the catalytic domain was shown
to influence polymerase activity and thus fidelity
[58,59,68]. Similarly, mutational analysis of the poliovirus 3C protein has recently uncovered a number of residues required for viral replication and VPg binding that
happen localize outside the defined protease and RNA
binding/VPg primer binding domains but in proximity
with these unassigned diversifying residues, (C.E. Cameron, personal communication). Additional progress in
structural analysis of the poliovirus 3CD precursor also
indicates potential intersubunit (3C–3D) and intrasubunit (3D–3D) interactions in domains of the 3C and 3D
subunits within close proximity to a number of the diversifying residues we have identified within regions of currently unassigned function [71]. A complete
understanding of the possible functional role that these
diversifying residues may play in either of these individual
factors or the active 3CD precursor awaits additional functional studies. The convergence of our results with these
independent studies suggesting novel functional domains
and interactions within the non-structural genes points to
the utility of selective pressure analysis to uncover potentially important functional domains within a genome that
may influence viability and overall fitness.

Conservation of essential non-coding RNA elements in the
HRV genome
Analysis of RNA elements present in both the non-coding
(5' cloverleaf and IRES, and 3' stem-loop element) and
coding regions (CRE) of the HRV genome indicates conservation of both sequence and secondary structures in
these regulatory elements in both HRVA and HRVB
genomes. Although the consensus secondary structures
among these elements appear similar to those generated
based on a much smaller set of HRV genome sequences
[61], subtle sequence variations can be detected between
the HRVA and HRVB subgroup members, as well as
within each of the subgroup members (Additional file 4,
Data S3 and S4). Such differences are of particular interest
as these elements have been shown to be essential for viral
replication, translation, overall viability, and in the case of
poliovirus, for pathogenicity and tissue tropism [72-75].
Comprehensive analyses of the functional implications
and associated clinical implications of diversity in
sequence and secondary structure of these regions of the
HRV genome have not been performed. Correlations in
variation of the known functions of these RNAs with the
sequence variation and structural diversity found within
this subset of HRVs will shed light on the role they play in
viral growth and replication, and may further clarify the
role non-coding regions in HRV pathogenesis.
Potential role for selective pressure analysis in drug
development
To date, two drugs targeting conserved regions of the HRV
genome have advanced to Phase III clinical trials. Pleconaril, a potent capsid inhibitor of HRVs and HEVs, binds
to a surface-accessible hydrophobic pocket in the VP1 protein on the external face of the viral particle [45].
Ruprintrivir targets the proteolytic active site of the 3C
protein and exhibits broad inhibition of HRV growth in
vitro [45].

Unfortunately, neither of these drugs has demonstrated
sufficient symptom relief, or in the case of pleconaril,
exhibited untoward interactions with other drugs. Thus,
FDA approval was not granted for either of these potential
therapies. Moreover, pleconaril treatment has been shown
to give rise to drug resistant viruses at a low frequency
[76]. This has not been observed with rupritrivir. Such
observations can be explained in the context of our selective pressure analysis. Inspection of our data for the residues targeted by these two drugs reveals only a single
residue to possess diversifying selective pressure above
background (Additional File 3, Tables S2 and Additional
file 4, Table S3). This residue lies within the pleconaril
binding site and corresponds to VP1 residue 191. Prior
work identified this residue to be one of two residues that
varied from the consensus valine in pleconaril susceptible
HRV serotypes to leucine in resistant HRV serotypes [55].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/40

In fact, a V191L mutation engineered in a susceptible
HRVB serotype was found to be sufficient to confer a 30fold reduction in susceptibility to pleconaril [55].
Having identified the only residue known to yield pleconaril resistance, these results illustrate the potential utility
of selective pressure analysis with respect to drug development. In early stages of drug development, selective pressure analysis combined with assays for drug efficacy and
viral pathogenicity could prove valuable in de novo choice
of drug targets. The diversifying potential of residues
within or flanking drug binding sites could be evaluated
in silico, and mutations in such residues could be engineered and assayed for drug binding, normal substrate
binding, and viral growth. Ultimately, incorporating such
analysis in the drug development pipeline may allow the
avoidance of targets with high potential for drug resistance or increased virulence.

Conclusion
This analysis has closed a gap in our understanding of the
genetic diversity and evolutionary pressures across the
HRV genome. It has provided a deeper understanding of
the similarities and differences between the genetic diversity present in HRV compared to other genera of the picornavirus family. These results have also raised several
testable questions related to several domains of unknown
function and HRV evolution itself. Ultimately, such
knowledge may serve to elucidate the determinants of
pathogenicity within the HRV genome and aid in the
development of therapeutics to reduce or eliminate the
clinical symptoms associated with this ubiquitous respiratory pathogen.

Methods
Isolation of RNA from low passage HRV prototype stocks
Low passage tissue culture supernatants from tissue culture cells infected with the HRV serotypes (indicated in
Additional File 1, Figure S1 and Additional File 5, Table
S4) were obtained from the California Department of
Health Services (CaDHS). Supernatants were centrifuged
briefly to pellet cellular debris, then passed through 0.2
μm filters, brought to 10 mM CaCl2, and incubated with
600 units of micrococcal nuclease (Fermentas) for 3 hours
at 37°C. RNA was then isolated from the culture supernatants via Trizol:chloroform extraction, followed by isopropanol precipitation.
Amplification and shotgun sequencing of HRV prototype
stock RNA
RNA isolated from HRV prototype culture supernatants
was reverse transcribed, randomly amplified as previously
described [77], and cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) to generate plasmid libraries for each
HRV serotype. The resulting libraries were transformed

into bacteria. Plasmid DNA prepared from each library of
transformants was sequenced using the Big Dye terminator v. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) containing either -21 universal or -28 reverse primer and analyzed on an ABI
3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

Scanning average pairwise sequence identity plots were
generated using a moving window of 100 nucleotides or
50 amino acids across the whole-genome nucleotide
alignment and the corresponding amino acid translation
in the coding region of the genome.

Shotgun sequence analysis and assembly of HRV genomes
Approximately 7 Mb of DNA derived from 14,208 reads,
with an average length of 500 bp, were shotgun sequenced
to generate the initial HRV genome assemblies. Contaminating human and bacterial reads (60% of all reads) were
identified and removed through BLAST analysis [78]. A
total of 8,278 viral reads were processed and assembled
with the CONSED software suite [79]. Overall, each
genome assembly contained an average of 304 input viral
reads, with an average read depth of 22, and average quality score of 86.4 (Additional file 5, Table S5). Specific PCR
was performed to obtain sequences at the extreme 5'end
and 3'end of each genome sequenced and to close any
internal gaps. For the ends, a single high quality (minimum phred score of 20) sequencing read with at least 100
nucleotides of overlap with the shotgun assembly reads
was required to consider each genome finished. For the
internal gaps, a minimum of 2 high quality forward and
reverse reads with overlap of at least 100 nucleotides with
shotgun contigs were required to consider internal gaps
closed. A shotgun sequence assembly derived from the
previously sequenced HRV001b [32] was used to validate
the quality of sequences obtained by these methods. The
resulting shotgun assembly of HRV001b was 99.6% identical (6198 identities of 6223 nucleotides assembled) to
the fully sequenced HRV001b present in NCBI (genbank
identifier 221708).

Recombination analysis
The genomic nucleotide alignment of the 34 complete
HRV genomes was analyzed using RDP version 2 [83]. Six
automated recombination analysis algorithms were run:
RDP, GENECONV [84], BOOTSCAN [85], MaxChi [86],
Chimaera [87], and Sister Scanning [88]. These algorithms were selected from the set of published recombination detection methods based on their ability to identify
recombinant sequences, the associated breakpoints, and
parental sequences. In computational and empirical comparative tests, no single method performed best under all
conditions, and consistent results from more than one
method was the best indicator of recombination [87,89].
Resulting predictions of recombination events with p-values less than 0.05 were analyzed manually using all six
methods. Events supported by evidence from more than
one method were further characterized by manual analysis of bootstrapped phylogenetic trees of the relevant
genomic locus to determine the genotypes involved in the
recombination event.

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Inferred amino acid sequence of the coding regions of the
34 complete HRV genomes were aligned using the CLUSTALW program [80]. This alignment was then back-translated into nucleotide sequence and combined with
alignments of the 5' and 3' non-coding regions, generated
using CLUSTALW, to form the whole-genome nucleotide
alignment used for analysis. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were generated from the alignment using
CLUSTALW with Kimura's correction for multiple base
substitutions. Maximum likelihood trees were generated
using baseml from the PAML [81] package and DNAML
from the Phylip [82] package. Trees generated using
neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods contained similar topologies, and differed only in computed
branch lengths. The HKY85 model of nucleotide substitution was used, and the values of the transition/transversion rate and the alpha parameter in baseml were
estimated through maximum likelihood calculation.
Alignment positions with gaps were ignored in all cases.

Selective pressure analysis
Codon-based models of evolution of coding sequence
allowing for variable selection pressure among sites in a
maximum-likelihood framework were used to evaluate
the selective pressure operating on each gene individually.
Codon-substitution models [90,91] were compared using
likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to test for significant diversifying selection within each gene.

These codon-substitution models, allowing for variable ω
(dN/dS) parameters among sites, were fit to the nucleotide alignment of the coding sequence of the genome.
Model M1a, or the neutral model, incorporates a class of
sites under purifying selection with ω0 < 1, and a second
class of sites with ω1 = 1. Model M2a adds a third class of
sites ω2 > 1, to allow for diversifying selection. Similarily,
Model 7 incorporates a discrete beta distribution (10
classes) to model values of ω between 0 and 1, while
Model 8 adds an additional parameter ω > 1. Likelihood
ratio tests were performed between nested models (M1a
versus M2a, or M7 versus M8) to calculate the significance
of diversifying selection within a gene (Additional file 5,
Table S6). An empirical Bayesian approach was then used
to calculate the posterior probability that a site belongs to
each of the ω site classes. This probability value was then
used to compute an estimate of dN/dS for each site in the
sequence. Maximum likelihood calculations on the sub-

stitution models were implemented using the codeml
program from version 3.14 of the PAML package [81].
To ascertain how well the resulting dN/dS values computed from the subset of 34 reference genomes reflected
the selective pressure present in the full set of 102 known
HRV serotypes, we compared the dN/dS values computed
for each residue in the VP1 gene of this set of HRVA and
HRVB serotypes to the same dN/dS values obtained independently from the available VP1 sequences of all 102
HRV serotypes [25,26]. Although the absolute value of the
dN/dS ratios differed between the two sets, their relative
rankings were well correlated (0.91 and 0.80, for HRVA
and HRVB genomes, respectively; Additional file 1, Figure
S2), with few potential false positives and false negatives
detected. Thus, it appears that the relative rank, rather
than absolute magnitude of the dN/dS values we have
computed from this subset of HRV genomes accurately
approximates the selective pressures detectable among the
full set of 102 HRV reference serotypes.
Tests of heterogeneous synonymous substitution rates
among sites were performed using the REL analysis implemented in the HYPHY [92] phylogenetic package. This
method of analysis is very similar to that described above,
but differs in codon models available, and in the modeling of site classes (REL site classes are modeled as N discrete classes, similar to model M3 in codonml). Analysis
using the GY [93] model of codon evolution with six discrete classes of non-synonymous and synonymous mutation rates was used to determine the effects of variable dS
across sites on the data. Although varying dS resulted in a
lowered magnitude of a number of capsid residues in the
smaller dataset of HRVB genomes, it did not significantly
impact the per-residue dN/dS values for the HRVA
genomes or confer any significant changes in the overall
identity or localization of the 5% highest scoring dN/dS
residues of the capsid genes (Additional file 5, Figure S9).
Thus, for the sake of simplicity, dN/dS values discussed in
the results section were those derived from the calculations described above assuming a homogeneous synonymous substitution rate.
Mapping dN/dS values onto 3-dimensional crystal
structures
Viral pentamer structures were generated from the NCBI
Protein Database (pdb) files of HRV2 (pdb id 1FPN),
HRV14 (pdb id 4RHV), and HRV16 (pdb id 1AYM) using
the Oligomer Generator utility from the VIPERdb website
[94]. Analysis of the 3C protease and 3D polymerase was
performed using the HRV2 3C protease (pdb id 1CQQ),
and HRV14 3D polymerase (pdb id 1XR5), respectively.
The molecular structure visualization program, Chimera
[95], was used to generate images of the viral proteins.

Distance calculations
Calculations of the significance of the overlap in structure
space between sets of dN/dS data were calculated using an
average minimum distance between residues metric.
Observed average minimum distance between two sets (A
and B) of residues was calculated by taking the average of
the minimum three-dimensional Cartesian distance from
each residue of set A to the nearest residue from set B. In
effect this is a measurement of how closely correlated the
positions of set A are to any subset of the positions in set
B. To calculate the significance of this observed distance,
100,000 iterations of this calculation were computed, randomizing the locations of the residues in set A for each
calculation. The distribution of the resulting average minimum distance values was used to calculate a p-value for
the significance of the observed value.
