Leishmania infantum causes visceral and cutaneous
leishmaniasis in northern Morocco. It predominantly
affects children under 5 years with an incidence of 100
cases per year. Genetic variability and population structure has been investigated for 55 strains isolated from
infected dogs and humans in Morocco. A multilocus
microsatellite typing (MLMT) approach was used in
which a MLM type based on size variation in 14 independent microsatellite markers was compiled for each
strain. MLMT profiles of 10 Tunisian, 10 Algerian and
21 European strains which belonged to zymodeme
MON-1and non-MON1 according to multilocus enzyme
electrophoresis (MLEE) were included for comparison.
A Bayesian model-based approach and phylogenetic
analysis inferred two L. infantum sub-populations; Subpopulation A consists of 25 Moroccan strains grouped
with all European strains of MON-1 type; and subpopulation B consists of 25 Moroccan strains grouped
with the Tunisian and Algerian MON-1 strains. Theses
sub-populations were significantly different from each
other and from the Tunisian, Algerian and European
non MON 1 strains which constructed one separate
population. The presence of these two sub-populations
co-existing in Moroccan endemics shed the light on the
possible scenarios of multiple introduction of L. infantum from/to Morocco; (1) Introduction from/to the
neighboring North African countries, (2) Introduction
from/to the Europe. These scenarios are supported
by the presence of sup-population B and sub-population
A respectively. Gene flow was noticed between suppopulations A and B. Five strains showed mixed A/B
genotypes indicating possible recombination between

investigations in Leishmania.
