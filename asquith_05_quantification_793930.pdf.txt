Abstract
Background: HTLV-I causes the disabling inflammatory disease HAM/TSP: there is no vaccine, no
satisfactory treatment and no means of assessing the risk of disease or prognosis in infected people.
Like many immunopathological diseases with a viral etiology the outcome of infection is thought to
depend on the virus-host immunology interaction. However the dynamic virus-host interaction is
complex and current models of HAM/TSP pathogenesis are conflicting. The CD8+ cell response is
thought to be a determinant of both HTLV-I proviral load and disease status but its effects can
obscure other factors.
Results: We show here that in the absence of CD8+ cells, CD4+ lymphocytes from HAM/TSP
patients expressed HTLV-I protein significantly more readily than lymphocytes from asymptomatic
carriers of similar proviral load (P = 0.017). A high rate of viral protein expression was significantly
associated with a large increase in the prevalence of HAM/TSP (P = 0.031, 89% of cases correctly
classified). Additionally, a high rate of Tax expression and a low CD8+ cell efficiency were
independently significantly associated with a high proviral load (P = 0.005, P = 0.003 respectively).
Conclusion: These results disentangle the complex relationship between immune surveillance,
proviral load, inflammatory disease and viral protein expression and indicate that increased protein
expression may play an important role in HAM/TSP pathogenesis. This has important implications
for therapy since it suggests that interventions should aim to reduce Tax expression rather than
proviral load per se.

Background
Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type I (HTLV-I) is a persistent retrovirus. The majority of infected individuals remain
lifelong, asymptomatic carriers of the virus (ACs). However, 2–3% of infected individuals develop an aggressive

malignancy named Adult T cell Leukemia. A further 2–3%
develop inflammatory disease of one or more organs. The
best characterised inflammatory disease is HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP),
a chronic inflammatory condition of the central nervous

CD4

that this was more likely to be directly associated with the
amount of viral antigen rather than the amount of proviral DNA. However, investigation of viral antigen is confounded by the presence of CD8+ cells which effectively
kill HTLV-I-expressing cells ex vivo [11-13], and presumably in vivo [3,7]. We therefore investigated viral protein
expression in cells from HAM/TSP patients and ACs following ex vivo CD8+ cell depletion with the aim of quantifying the relative importance of proviral load, viral
protein expression and CTL surveillance in HTLV-I infection.

system. It is not understood why most HTLV-I infected
individuals remain asymptomatic yet some develop
inflammatory disease.
The two factors most often associated with HAM/TSP are
high proviral load [1] and high HTLV-I-specific CD8+
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) frequency [2,3], suggesting
that virus-host immunology interactions are important in
determining the outcome of infection. It is not known
whether the HTLV-I-specific CD8+ cellular response is
pathogenic and contributes to the tissue damage in HAM/
TSP, or whether it is protective and reduces proviral load
and the risk of the development of HAM/TSP. There is evidence supporting both pictures [3-8], and they are not
necessarily mutually exclusive [9]. What is clear is that a
good understanding of the CTL-virus interaction is crucial
to understanding the control of HTLV-I infection and the
progression to HAM/TSP.
Although a high proviral load is associated with HAM/TSP
there is large amount of overlap in proviral load between
HAM/TSP patients and ACs [1]. There exist ACs with high
proviral loads (> 3% PBMC infected) and HAM/TSP
patients with low proviral loads (<1% PBMC infected),
indicating that a high proviral load is neither necessary
nor sufficient to cause HAM/TSP. Current theories of
HAM/TSP pathogenesis postulate excess activation of
CD4+ and/or CD8+ lymphocytes [5,6,10]. We reasoned

Tax expression was higher in HAM/TSP patients than ACs
Tax protein is the first HTLV-1 protein to be expressed in
an infected cell; we therefore focused on Tax protein as an
index of HTLV-1 proviral expression. Tax protein expression is usually below the detection limit in lymphocytes
immediately ex vivo but increases spontaneously over time
during culture [12]; we therefore measured the proportion
of CD4+ lymphocytes expressing Tax after 18 h. CD8+
cells were depleted prior to culture to prevent lysis of Taxexpressing cells. Tax expression was measured in 16
patients; representative staining is shown in Fig. 1, results
from all subjects are shown in Fig. 2.

Tax expression (i.e. the proportion of CD4+ cells expressing Tax protein) at any given proviral load was significantly higher in the HAM/TSP patients than in the ACs
(permutation test P = 0.017, ANOVA P = 0.014 two
tailed). Grouping the patients by proviral load (Table I)
showed that Tax expression was 2.5–3 times higher in
HAM/TSP patients compared with ACs of similar proviral
loads. We found that the median probability of an
infected cell expressing Tax after 18 h ex vivo culture was
50% in HAM/TSP patients and 28% in ACs (Methods).
Tax expression and risk of HAM/TSP
We analysed the association between proviral load, Tax
expression and clinical status using logistic regression. In
our patient sample, although there was a trend for a
higher proviral load in HAM/TSP patients, there was no
significant association between proviral load and HAM/
TSP. In contrast we found that Tax expression was a significant predictor of disease. This was true whether we considered the proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes that were
Tax+ (fraction of cases correctly classified = 82%; P =
0.031) or the rate of Tax expression (proportion of Tax+
lymphocytes at a given proviral load) (fraction of cases
correctly classified = 89%; P = 0.035). The odds of having
HAM/TSP were 20 fold higher in the subjects with a high
rate of Tax expression compared to the subjects with a low
rate of Tax expression (P = 0.02). A high rate of Tax expression is therefore significantly associated with the disease
HAM/TSP, independently of proviral load.

Tax expression in CD4+ lymphocytes from HTLV-I infected individuals. The proportion of CD4+ cells expressing
the viral protein Tax after 18 h ex vivo incubation in the absence of CD8+ cells was measured by flow cytometry. Tax expression was significantly higher in lymphocytes from HAM/TSP patients than from ACs of comparable proviral load (ANOVA, two
tailed test p = 0.014. Permutation test two-tailed test p = 0.017). This result was robust to removal of outliers: the P value
either remained unchanged or decreased on removal of outliers.

Tax expression and the control of proviral load
Next we identified factors significantly associated with a
high proviral load, using multiple regression. The factors
considered were Tax expression and CTL lysis rate of
infected cells ex vivo. The rate at which an individual's
CTLs killed infected cells was measured during an 18 h ex
vivo "CD8+ cell mediated anti-viral efficacy" assay (Methods, Table I). Proviral load and the proportion of CD4+
cells that were Tax+ were strongly positively correlated as
expected. If the proportion of CD4+ cells that were Tax+ is
used as a predictor variable then this will result in a highly
significant model with a large proportion of the betweenindividual variation in proviral load "explained". However, this will simply be because we have identified a surrogate marker for proviral load. Instead, we consider Tax
expression after correcting for proviral load. That is, we
divide the patient sample into those whose infected cells
have a high probability or rate of Tax expression (high
proportion of Tax+CD4+ cells at a given proviral load after
18 h culture) and those whose infected cells have a low
rate of Tax expression. We then asked whether subjects
with high and low rates of Tax expression with equally
efficacious CTL responses (similar rates of CTL lysis of
infected cells) had different proviral loads. It was found
that the rate of Tax expression (high or low) was a significant predictor of proviral load (P = 0.005, 13% of proviral

load predicted) independent of the CTL lysis rate, which
was also a significant predictor (P = 0.003, 30% of proviral load predicted). Overall, 43% of the between-individual variation in proviral load could be explained by
variation in these two parameters. We conclude that the
rate of CTL-mediated lysis and the rate of Tax expression
are significant independent predictors of HTLV-I proviral
load.
Why is an increased rate of Tax expression associated with
an increased proviral load?
Initially it would seem that a high rate of Tax expression
should be associated with a low proviral load since it
would result in the exposure of a high proportion of
infected cells to the immune response (as well as possibly
having a toxic or pro-apoptotic effect [14]). We therefore
modelled this to understand how an increased rate of Tax
expression could lead to increased proviral load at a given
CTL lysis rate. The model is represented in diagrammatic
form in Fig. 3 (details in Additional file 1). The model predicted that Tax expression could increase proviral load
because, although Tax expression exposes infected cells to
the CTL response, it can also increase infected cell proliferation by upregulating cellular genes involved in proliferation and deregulating cell cycle checkpoints [15-17].

The choice of groups of "comparable" proviral load is, to some extent, subjective but a range of alternative groupings gave similar results. This
included a grouping in which the mean proviral load of ACs was higher than the mean proviral load of HAM/TSP patients in each group (it was
necessary to omit some high proviral load HAM/TSP patients in order to obtain this alternative grouping). We have illustrated our results using this
particular grouping because it is a representative grouping and because it yields two or more subjects in each group thus minimising the effect of
outliers.

determines the net effect of increased Tax expression on
proviral load. If the CTL response is weak then the
increase in proviral load due to a high rate of Tax expression is large. If the CTL response is stronger then the
increase in proviral load conferred by a high rate of Tax
expression decreases. That is, the model predicted that the
gain in proviral load conferred by a high rate of Tax
expression should fall as the CTL lysis rate increases (Fig.
4A). To test if the experimental data fulfils this prediction
we grouped the 16 subjects into groups of similar CTL
lysis rate, then subtracted the mean proviral load of subjects with a low rate of Tax expression from the mean proviral load of subjects with a high rate of Tax expression
within each group. On plotting this difference against the
mean CTL lysis rate for the group (Fig. 4B) it can be seen
that the experimental data accord with the prediction,
with a progressive decrease in difference between the proviral load of subjects with high and low rates of Tax
expression as the lysis rate of the CTL response increases.

Discussion

accounted for. In contrast, Yamano et al. [19] reported
that Tax mRNA remained significantly higher in HAM/
TSP patients after correction for proviral load. Our work
extends this earlier research by investigating Tax protein
rather than mRNA and, most importantly, by removing
the potentially confounding factor of the CD8+ cell
response. Earlier work was done in the presence of CD8+
cells, making it hard to interpret since it was not known
how much of the between-individual variation in Tax
mRNA was attributable to variation in the HTLV-I-specific
CTL response. In particular, systematic differences in the
frequency of HTLV-I specific CTLs between ACs and
HAM/TSP patients are widely reported [2,5]; it was possible that this difference was sufficient to explain the
reported differences in Tax mRNA. Measuring Tax protein
expression by flow cytometry also provides information at
a per cell level enabling us to determine whether an
increase in Tax expression is due to an increase in the
number of cells expressing Tax or an increase in the
amount of Tax expressed per Tax expressing cell -a refinement that is not possible with RT-PCR.

Two earlier studies have quantified Tax mRNA in HTLV-I
infection [18,19]. These papers reported conflicting
results. Furukawa et al. [18] reported that there was no difference in Tax mRNA levels between HAM/TSP patients
and ACs after variation in proviral load had been

We found that Tax expression (proportion of CD4+ cells
expressing Tax) was a significant predictor of HAM/TSP
status in our patient sample. Interestingly, this was in a
subject group where proviral load was not significantly

Death of silently infected CD4+ cells will include all normal
cell death processes such as necrosis and apoptosis. Death of
Tax-expressing CD4+ cells is divided into two: that which
can be directly attributed to CTL (e.g. perforin mediated lysis
or Fas-mediated apoptosis) and that which is independent of
CTL (including normal cell necrosis and apoptosis as well as
Tax-induced apoptosis and activation induced cell death).
Natural proliferation describes the normal background rate
of CD4+ cell turnover. Tax-driven proliferation describes
the extra proliferation that may be caused by Tax expression
due to its upregulation of cellular genes involved in cell proliferation and deregulation of cell cycle checkpoints [15–17,
33].
associated with HAM/TSP. We can therefore be confident
that the association between Tax expression and HAM/
TSP is not simply because Tax expression acted as a surrogate for proviral load per se. On the other hand, the association between proviral load and HAM/TSP reported in
the Japanese population [1] may not result from a high
proviral load increasing the risk of disease as is often
assumed. Instead, it could be that high Tax expression
causes HAM/TSP and that since Tax expression and proviral load are correlated this is manifest as an association
between proviral load and HAM/TSP. Current hypotheses
of HAM/TSP pathogenesis centre around excess activation
of CD4+ and/or CD8+ lymphocytes [6,20,21]. That excess
T cell activation should be associated with the expression
rather than simply the possession of a provirus is intuitively reasonable. HAM/TSP pathogenesis remains poorly
understood and surprisingly few factors have been identified that distinguish HAM/TSP patients from ACs. The

observation that high Tax expression is significantly associated with HAM/TSP, the odds of having HAM/TSP being
20 fold higher in subjects with a high rate of Tax expression compared with subjects with a low rate of Tax expression, is an important step towards identifying why some
individuals develop HAM/TSP but most remain asymptomatic. The absence of a significant association between
proviral load and HAM/TSP in our subject group could be
because the overlap in proviral load between HAM/TSP
patients and ACs, which is considerable in the Japanese
population [1], is even broader in our, mainly Afro-Caribbean population.
We also report that subjects with a high rate of Tax expression have high proviral loads. We suggest that although
Tax expression exposes infected cells to the CTL response
it also increases infected cell proliferation by upregulating
cellular genes involved in proliferation and deregulating
cell cycle checkpoints. This increase in infected cell proliferation results in a net increase in proviral load at a given
CTL strength. If the CTL response is weak then the "benefit" to the virus of a high rate of Tax expression is very
large, resulting in a considerably higher proviral load than
a low rate of Tax expression. If the CTL response is
stronger then the "benefit" conferred by a high rate of Tax
expression decreases. If the CTL strength is extremely high
then the virus "benefits" from remaining silent. Consistent with this explanation we found that the increase in
proviral load associated with a high rate of Tax expression
was reduced in subjects with a strong CTL response (high
rate of lysis of infected cells). It might be expected that this
would drive within-host evolution of HTLV-I with low
Tax-expressing strains being selected for in individuals
with a strong CTL response and vice versa. However,
HTLV-I has, compared to other retroviruses, little scope
for within-host evolution due to the low frequency of variant strains [22]. So, although virus infecting an individual with a very strong immune response may benefit from
reduced Tax expression this will not necessarily result in
the emergence of new virus variants. Why Tax expression
should vary between individuals is not known and is the
subject of ongoing research. Possible reasons include differences between individuals in the proportion of defective proviruses, in CD8+ cell-independent immunity, in
proviral integration site or in epigenetic alterations to the
proviral DNA such as methylation. Finally, Tax expression
may be affected by the expression of other HTLV-1 regulatory proteins such as p30, HBZ and Rex [23-25]. It is possible that increased Tax expression could explain the
reported associations between HAM/TSP and HTLV-I phylogenetic subgroup [26] since variations in the viral LTR
could result in increased rates of Tax expression.
The relationship between Tax expression ex vivo and Tax
expression in vivo is not fully understood. The fact that Tax

and CTL lysis of infected cells to proviral load, finding that
a low CTL lysis rate and a high rate of Tax expression are
independently significantly associated with a high proviral load (P = 0.003, P = 0.005 respectively) and suggested
causal mechanisms for both of these relationships. Importantly, we also find that a high rate of Tax expression is a
significant risk factor associated with HAM/TSP (P =
0.017) and that the rate of Tax expression correctly classifies 89% of infected subjects. We propose that high Tax
expression rather than high proviral load is causally associated with HAM/TSP pathogenesis. If correct, this conclusion implies that therapeutic intervention should aim to
reduce Tax expression rather than proviral load per se.

The increase in proviral load due to a high rate of

that one explanation for the increase in proviral load associated with a high rate of Tax expression is that expression of
Tax promotes cell division. The model predicts (4A) that the
difference in proviral load between individuals who have high
and low rates of Tax expression decreases as the CTL lysis
rate increases. The experimental data (4B) are consistent
with this prediction. The experimental data "change in proviral load with increased rate of Tax expression" was calculated by grouping all 16 subjects into groups of similar rates
of lysis. Within each group the mean proviral load of the subjects with a high rate of Tax expression and the mean proviral load of subjects with a low rate of Tax expression was
calculated. The difference between these two means is the

expression ex vivo is significantly associated with disease
status suggests that Tax expression ex vivo and Tax expression in vivo are correlated. More direct evidence of this correlation is provided by a recent study of in vivo CD4+ T
lymphocyte kinetics in HTLV-I infected subjects in which
it was found that cells that expressed Tax ex vivo had proliferated more rapidly in vivo than cells from the same
individual that did not express Tax [27].

Conclusion

Subjects
All subjects attended the HTLV-I clinic at St Mary's Hospital, London and gave informed consent. The study was
approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee of St
Mary's Hospital NHS Trust and all procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
HTLV-I infection was diagnosed by the presence of antibodies to HTLV-I Gag and Env antigens in sera by Western
blot and confirmed by detection of HTLV-I Tax by DNA
PCR. Diagnosis of HAM/TSP was made following World
Health Organisation criteria. 16 HTLV-I infected subjects
were studied, the median age was 60 yrs (range 36–74
yrs). One subject (HS) was studied on two separate occasions (6 mths apart); as both proviral load and Tax expression had changed both data points were included in our
analysis. Exclusion of one or the other of the data points
did not qualitatively alter any of the results.
Measurement of Tax expression
CD8+ cells were positively selected from thawed cryopreserved PBMC using magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). The CD8- fraction was washed twice and
resuspended in standard culture medium (total volume 1
ml) in 5 ml round-bottomed, vented capped tubes. After
18 hours' culture at 37°C, 5% CO2, the cells were washed
in PBS, fixed for 20 mins at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4; Sigma), washed then surface
stained for CD4 and CD8 antigens by incubation at room
temperature for 20 mins in PBS/7% Normal Goat Serum
with relevant mAbs (15 µg/ml of PC5-conjugated antiCD4 and ECD-conjugated anti-CD8; Beckman Coulter).
The cells were washed once and stained intracellularly for
Tax protein [12] using the Tax monoclonal antibody Lt-4
[28], then analysed by flow cytometry on a Coulter EPICS
XL. All assays were done in duplicate and the proportion
of CD4+ lymphocytes that were Tax positive was calculated. The average purity of CD8- cells was 96%, minimal
purity was 88%.

In summary, we present two main findings. We have
quantified the contribution of viral protein expression

Proviral load measurement
Proviral load was measured as previously described [13].
Briefly DNA from PBMC was amplified for HTLV-I DNA
(Tax specific primers as in [29,30]) and β-actin by real
time quantitative PCR. Standard curves were generated
using DNA from the C10 cell line. The sample copy
number was estimated by interpolation from the standard
curve, calculated as an average of three dilutions and
expressed as the proportion of HTLV-I infected PBMC,
assuming one provirus per infected cell [31].
Measurement of CD8+ cell lysis of Tax-expressing cells
CD8+ cell lysis was measured using an ex vivo "CD8+ cell
mediated anti-viral efficacy" assay as previously described
[13]. Briefly, CD8+ and CD8- cell fractions were isolated
from PBMC using magnetic microbeads; washed, resuspended in standard culture medium and aliquotted into 5
ml round-bottomed, vented capped tubes at 3 to 6 different CD8+:CD8- ratios (lower, including and higher than
the subject's normal ratio). No mitogens, cytokines or
artificial peptides were added. After 18 hours' culture at
37°C, 5% CO2, the cells were washed in PBS, fixed for 20
mins at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde (pH
7.4; Sigma), washed then surface stained for CD4 and
CD8 antigens (as described above). The cells were washed
once and stained intracellularly for Tax (as described
above), then analysed by flow cytometry on a Coulter
EPICS XL. 30,000 events were routinely collected. All
assays were done in duplicate.

The resulting data (the proportion of Tax+CD4+ cells surviving at different CD8+:CD8- ratios) was analysed mathematically. The CD8+ cell lysis rate, i.e. the rate at which
Tax+CD4+ cells were killed by CD8+ cells, was estimated
in each subject using the following model:

dy
= c − ε yz
dt

(1)

where y is the proportion of CD4+ cells expressing Tax
(i.e. Tax+ CD4+ cells/CD4+ cells), c is the rate of increase
of Tax expression, ε is the CD8+ cell mediated lysis rate
and z is the proportion of lymphocytes that are CD8+.
This model was solved analytically and fitted to the data
using nonlinear least squares regression, providing an
estimate of the lysis rate (ε) in each individual. We have
previously shown [13] that the CD8+ cell-mediated loss
of Tax expressing cells was due to cell death (by propidium iodide staining); was perforin-dependent (i.e. is
blocked by the perforin inhibitor concanamycin A) and
was MHC class I restricted.
Permutation test: Tax expression at a given proviral load
A permutation test [32] was used to test the null hypothesis "the proportion of CD4+ cells expressing Tax at a given

proviral load is the same in HAM/TSP patients and ACs"
in a model independent way (ANOVA assumes a linear
relationship between Tax expression and proviral load).
This was done by grouping the data into bins of similar
proviral load. The binning algorithm used was to start
from the lowest proviral load and then extend the boundary of the bin until at least one HAM/TSP and one AC data
point were included. A boundary was then drawn and the
next bin started. The maximum number of bins that could
be constructed was 6. The mean frequency of Tax expressing cells (Tax+CD4+/CD4+) in the HAM/TSP patients and
in the ACs in each of the 6 bins was calculated. The test
statistic, "number of bins in which the proportion of
CD4+ cells expressing Tax was higher in the HAM/TSP
patients than the ACs" was counted.
The distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis was estimated using a Monte Carlo approach. That is,
the AC and HAM/TSP labels were removed from the proviral load-Tax expression data pairs and randomly reassigned. The resulting "data" was binned using the
algorithm defined above, and the test statistic calculated.
This was repeated 1,000 times to estimate the distribution
of the test statistic. The distribution was estimated in 10
different runs to check that it was stable. Using the resulting distribution, the probability of observing the test statistic under the null hypothesis was estimated and
doubled to obtain a two-tailed P value. The grouping of
subjects produced by the algorithm was Bin 1 TAQ, HT,
HY, HBD; Bin 2 TAY, HSa; Bin 3 TBA, HBF; Bin 4 TAT,
HBH; Bin 5 TAU, HSb; Bin 6 TW, TAC, TBI, TBG, HAY.
Definition: high/ low rate of Tax expression
The sample group was divided into subjects whose provirus-positive cells had a high or low rate of Tax expression
i.e. into subjects with a high or low proportion of
Tax+CD4+ cells at a given proviral load after 18 h culture.
This was done by fitting a straight line through the pooled
HAM/TSP and AC proviral load-Tax expression data using
linear regression. Subjects lying above this line were
classed as having a high rate of Tax expression (high frequency of Tax+ cells at a give proviral load), subjects lying
below it were classed as having a low rate of Tax expression (low frequency of Tax+ cells at a given proviral load).
The figure in Additional file 2 illustrates this classification.
Duplicate measurements of the frequency of Tax+ cells
were made. For every subject except TAC both duplicates
yielded the same classification into a high or low rate of
Tax expression. We therefore excluded TAC from any analysis requiring this classification but always checked that
including TAC as having either a low or a high rate of Tax
expression did not qualitatively alter the results. We use
"rate" of Tax expression to refer to the rate at which
silently infected (i.e. provirus positive, viral protein negative) cells express Tax. This enables us to distinguish

between the absolute level of Tax expression and the rate
(or probability) of a silently infected cell expressing Tax.
Logistic regression: predictors of disease status
Logistic regression was used to quantify the contribution
of Tax expression to the odds of having HAM/TSP in our
patient sample. Tax expression was considered in two
ways: 1) as a continuous variable: % of CD4+ cells that are
Tax+ after 18 h ex vivo culture and 2) as a dichotomous
variable: high/low rate of Tax expression (frequency of
Tax+CD4+ cells at a given proviral load) as defined above.

point a boundary was drawn and the next bin started. The
maximum number of bins that could be obtained was 5.
The difference in mean proviral load between the subjects
with a high rate of Tax expression and the subjects with a
low rate of Tax expression in each of the 5 bins was calculated and plotted against the mean CTL lysis rate in that
bin (Fig. 4B). The grouping of subjects produced by the
algorithm was Bin 1 TBG, TBI, HSa, HAY, HSb; Bin 2 TW,
HBH; Bin 3 TAU, HBF; Bin 4 TAT, TBA, HT, HY; Bin 5 TAY,
TAQ, HBD, TAC.

Abbreviations
Multiple regression: predictors of proviral load
Multiple linear regression was used to identify predictors
of proviral load across all individuals. Three independent
variables were considered: CTL lysis rate (continuous),
rate of Tax expression (dichotomous: high/low) and a
constant. Models were constructed by forwards and backwards stepwise procedures. The optimal model was

AC: asymptomatic carrier, CTL: cytotoxic T lymphocyte,
HAM/TSP: HTLV-I associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic
paraparesis, HTLV-I: Human T Lymphotropic Virus-I.

Ln [pvl] = -A(CTL lysic rate) + b(if rate of Tax expression =
high).

Authors' contributions

Using this model the fraction of the observed variation in
proviral load that could be explained by the variation in
CTL lysis rate and rate of Tax expression was calculated.
The significance of predictors quoted is the significance of
that variable given the other variable in the regression
equation.

Probability of an infected cell expressing Tax in 18 h
To estimate the probability of an infected (provirus-positive) cell expressing Tax in 18 h we expressed the fraction
of CD4+ cells that were Tax+ after 18 h culture as the fraction of infected cells that were Tax+ after 18 h using the
formula

probability =

In this calculation we made the simplifying assumption
that all proviral load was carried in CD4+ cells.
Grouped data: relationship between Tax expression,
proviral load and CTL lysis rate
A theoretical model (Fig. 3) predicted that the difference
in proviral load between subjects with a high and low rate
of Tax expression would decrease as the CTL lysis rate
increased (Fig. 4A). To test this prediction the subjects
were grouped into "bins" of similar lysis rate. The binning
algorithm used was to start from the lowest CTL lysis rate
and then extend the boundary of the bin until at least one
subject with a high rate of Tax expression and one subject
with a low rate of Tax expression were included (using the
definition of rate of Tax expression given above). At that
