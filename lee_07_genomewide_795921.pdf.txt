Abstract
Background: Previous studies have shown that burn-elicited stress signals alter expression of
certain murine endogenous retroviruses (MuERVs) in distant organs of mice. These findings suggest
that MuERVs may participate in a network of pathophysiologic events during post-burn systemic
response. To gain a better understanding of the biological roles of MuERVs in post-burn systemic
response, we examined the genome-wide changes in the MuERV expression profiles in distant
organs and the biological properties of the putative-burn related MuERVs were characterized.
Results: Female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to an approximately 18 % total body surface area
flame burn and tissues (liver, lung, and kidney) were harvested at 3 hours and 24 hours after injury.
The changes in the MuERV expression profiles in these tissues were examined by RT-PCR using a
primer set flanking the non-ecotropic MuERV U3 promoter region within the 3' long terminal
repeat. There were differential changes in the expression profiles of MuERV U3 regions after injury
in all three tissues examined. Subsequently, a total of 31 unique U3 promoter sequences were
identified from the tissues of both burn and no burn mice. An analysis of viral tropisms revealed
that putative MuERVs harboring these U3 promoter sequences were presumed to be either
xenotropic or polytropic. Some putative transcription regulatory elements were present
predominantly in U3 promoter sequences isolated from burn and no burn mice, respectively. In
addition, in silico mapping using these U3 sequences as a probe against the mouse genome database
identified 59 putative MuERVs. The biological properties (coding potentials for retroviral
polypeptides, primer binding sites, tropisms, branching ages, recombination events, and neighboring
host genes) of each putative MuERV were characterized. In particular, 16 putative MuERVs
identified in this study retained intact coding potentials for all three retroviral polypeptides (gag,
pol, and env). None of the putative MuERVs identified in this study were mapped to the coding
sequences of host genes.
Conclusion: In this study, we identified and characterized putative MuERVs whose expression
might be altered in response to burn-elicited systemic stress signals. Further investigation is needed
to understand the role of these MuERVs in post-burn systemic pathogenesis, in particular, via
characterization of their interaction with host genes, MuERV gene products, and viral activities.

Background
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are found in the genome
of all vertebrates. They are derived from retroviral infections of germ-line cells followed by permanent incorporation, called colonization, into the host's genome. ERVs are
transmitted vertically to the offspring as part of the parental genome by Mendelian order [1]. It is estimated that
human ERVs (HERVs) and murine ERVs (MuERVs) constitute approximately 8 % and 10 % of their genomes,
respectively [2,3]. The majority of ERVs have defective
genomes as a result of the accumulation of deletional or
insertional mutations as well as recombinations since
their initial colonization. However, certain ERVs retain
the full coding potentials for all or individual retroviral
polypeptides [2,3]. It has also been well-documented that
retroviral long terminal repeats (LTRs), which harbor
unique U3 promoter and enhancer sequences, are capable
of directly regulating the transcriptional activities (e.g.,
primary transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation) of
neighboring host genes [4-6]. Therefore, in conjunction
with the diversity of the ERV U3 promoter sequences,
these findings infer active participation of ERVs in a range
of normal physiologic as well as pathologic events of the
host [7,8].
The association between ERVs and pathologic events
underlying tumorigenesis and autoimmune diseases has
been described in a number of reports [9,10]. For
instance, expression of retroviral proteins from the
human teratocarcinoma-derived virus (HTDV), a member
of the HERV-K family, has been detected in tetratocarcinoma cell lines, breast cancer, and testicular tumors [11].
Further support for the ERVs' roles in various disease processes comes from studies that show some HERVs (HERVH, HERV-W, and HERV-R) contain the intact envelope
(env) gene capable of coding an env glycoprotein called
syncytin [12-14]. Syncytin was originally identified as a
fusogenic glycoprotein, which plays a crucial role in syncytiotrophoplast formation and placenta morphogenesis
during periimplantation of embryos [15]. In recent studies, the proinflammatory properties of syncytin have been
attributed to axonal demyelination, at least in part, during
the development of autoimmune multiple sclerosis in
humans [16]. In addition, HERVs are implicated in the
pathogenesis of a number of other autoimmune diseases,
such as schizophrenia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and systemic lupus erythematosus [17-19]. However,
further investigations are needed to fully understand the
roles of ERVs in these and other disease processes in
humans and animals.
In our previous studies, we demonstrated that burn-elicited stress signals altered the expression of MuERVs in distant organs of mice in a tissue-specific manner [20-22].
These MuERVs had unique U3 promoter sequences sug-

gesting different profiles of transcription regulatory elements in each of these sequences. Interestingly, some of
these MuERVs are very similar in viral genome structure to
the murine acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(MAIDS) virus, which is known to cause immune disorders in infected mice [20,23]. These findings led to the
hypothesis that burn-elicited stress signals are responsible, at least in part, for the genome-wide response of specific MuERVs. In addition, they may play causative roles in
post-burn pathogenesis as well as in other stress-related
disease processes. In this study, we identified putative
MuERVs whose expression was altered in response to
burn-elicited stress signals. Subsequently, the biological
properties (coding potentials for retroviral polypeptides,
primer binding sites (PBSs), viral tropism, branching ages,
recombination events, and neighboring host genes) of
these MuERVs were analyzed, and their roles in post-burn
pathogenesis are discussed.

Results
Differential alterations in MuERV expression profiles in
distant organs of mice after burn
To investigate the changes in genome-wide MuERV
expression after burn, we examined the transcription profiles of non-ecotropic MuERV U3 regions in the liver,
lungs, and kidney from both burn and no burn mice
(female C57BL/6J) by RT-PCR (Figure 1). It needs to be
noted that the no burn groups were subjected to anesthesia and fluid resuscitation. The U3 regions were selected
for expression analysis because of their highly polymorphic sequences among the MuERV population compared
to the rest of the viral genome. The U3 expression profiles
of these individual tissues were compared to the genomic
(C57BL/6J) profile as well as the expression profiles of
corresponding tissues harvested without any treatment,
such as anesthesia and resuscitation (no treatment control). Changes in the U3 expression profiles in all three tissues were evident at 24 hours after burn and these changes
were tissue-specific. In addition, substantial differences in
U3 expression profiles were observed in lung samples at 3
hours after burn (Figure 1B). These changes were manifested by either an increase or decrease in the expression
of specific U3 regions after burn. The U3 regions amplified in this experiment, which include an approximately
120 bp of additional sequence upstream and downstream
of the U3, were represented by seven major groups ranging in size from 461 bp to 798 bp. Interestingly, the U3
expression profiles of no burn controls (treated with
anesthesia and resuscitation) of all three tissues at 3 hours
were different at 24 hours. In addition, the U3 expression
profiles of tissues without any treatment were substantially different from no burn controls at both time points.
The difference in the U3 expression profiles among no
burn controls at two different time points and no treat-

region included the presence and/or absence of several
direct repeats and a 190 bp insertion. These variations
may be directly associated with the different transcription
potentials of each U3 promoter. It has been documented
that MuERV tropism is closely linked to their U3
sequences. The tropism characteristics of each U3
sequence was determined by comparison analysis using
the reference sequences (direct repeats, unique region,
and 190 bp insertion) first reported by Tomonaga et al.
[30]. A total of three intact direct repeats (1/1*, 5/5*, and
6/6*), one 190 bp insertion, and one unique sequence (2)
were identified among the U3 sequences examined (see
Additional file 1, Figure S1). In Additional file 1, Figure
S1, two other direct repeats (3 and 4/4*), which were not
identified or were partially identified in this experiment,
were marked as a reference. Primarily, four direct repeats
(1/1*, 4/4*, 5/5*, and 6/6*), one unique region (2), and
one 190 bp insertion were used for the tropism analysis.
No obvious difference was noted between groups of burn
and no burn in regard to tropism. Table 1 summarizes the
tropism analysis of all 31 U3 sequences, 14 polytropic and
17 xenotropic. The phylogenetic analysis of the U3
sequences yielded a significant branching pattern with
bootstrap values of greater than 50. It revealed six major
U3 groups, which paralleled the size of the U3 sequences
(346 bp, 384 bp/392 bp, 406 bp, 433 bp, 556 bp, and 600
bp) (Figure 3). It was of interest to note that the 600 bp
group (marked with "I") consists of predominantly U3

Identification and characterization of differentially
regulated MuERV U3 sequences after burn
To determine genetic variations among differentially
expressed MuERV U3 sequences in distant organs after a
burn, the U3 sequences isolated from the RT-PCR products were subjected to multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses. Amplified MuERV U3 sequences from each
experimental group were subjected to cloning after purification of the PCR reactions. Clones from each group were
picked for sequencing analysis primarily based on the differences in size. A total of 75 MuERV U3 sequences were
initially cloned from all three tissues of both burn and no
burn mice, and subsequent multiple alignment analyses
identified 31 unique U3 sequences with nine different
sizes (346 bp, 384 bp, 392 bp, 405 bp, 406 bp, 433 bp,
556 bp, 600 bp and 601 bp) (see Additional file 1, Figure
S1). Of the 31 U3 sequences, 11 were isolated from tissues
of burn mice, 17 were isolated from no burn mice, and
three were from both burn and no burn mice. Both the 5'end and 3'-end regions of the U3 sequences analyzed in
this experiment were conserved, however, the sequences
spanning the middle region were highly variable (see
Additional file 1, Figure S1). The variations in this middle

examined. Naming scheme of U3 sequence: Letter (K-kidney; L-liver; U-lung), first number ("1"â3 hours control; "2"â3 hours burn; "3"â24 hours

sequences isolated from no burn mice, in contrast to the
346 bp group (marked with "II"), which mostly were
derived from burn mice. Comparison analysis of the sizes
of differentially expressed U3 fragments (Figure 1) and U3
clones provided information regarding the origins of
these U3 clones. Based on these comparison data, four U3
sequences isolated from burn mice (K-4-5 U3, K-4-10 U3,
L-4-3 U3, and U-4-1 U3 within group II) were likely
derived from the ~450 bp fragment (before trimming 120
bp of non-U3 sequences), which was induced 24 hours
after burn (Figure 1). In addition, five U3 sequences in
group I (K-3-3 U3, K-3-6 U3, K-3-8 U3, L-3-5 U3, and U1-7 U3) were presumed to originate from the ~700 bp
fragments (before trimming 120 bp non-U3 sequences)
whose expression was evident in no burn control mice
compared to burn mice (Figure 1). The L-1-1 U3 and U-1-

8 U3 in the group II were likely to be derived from the
baseline expression of the ~450 bp fragment expressed in
no burn mice (3 hours). It is also possible that these U3
sequences could be associated with stress signals from
anesthesia and resuscitation. Further comparison analysis
of the RT-PCR data and U3 clones will elucidate the relations between each differentially expressed U3 fragment
and U3 clones of different sizes examined in this study.
Comparative analysis of transcriptional potentials of 31
unique U3 promoter sequences
To gain insights into the transcription potential, the profile of putative transcription regulatory elements within
each U3 promoter sequence was determined. A total of 73
putative transcription regulatory elements were identified
within all 31 U3 promoter sequences using the database

from Genomatix (Munich, Germany) (see Additional file
1, Table S1). Among these transcription regulatory elements, five (marked with "a") (HMGA1/2 [high mobility
group A protein 1/2], Thing1/E47 heterodimer, C/EBPÎ²
[CCAAT/enhancer binding protein Î²], PAX6 [paired-boxcontaining protein 6], and SZF1 [stem cell zinc finger protein 1]) were present predominantly in the U3 sequences
isolated from burn mice. On the other hand, 15 elements
(marked with "b"), such as NF-ÎºB, c-Myb, gut-enriched
Krueppel-like factor, and PPAR/RXR heterodimer, were
mostly mapped to the U3 sequences originating from no
burn mice. Further characterization of the specific roles of
the transcription regulatory elements predominantly
present in the U3 sequences from either burn or no burn
mice in burn-elicited systemic pathogenesis is warranted.
Genomic mapping and characterization of putative
MuERVs harboring individual U3 sequences
In this experiment, the putative MuERVs harboring the
individual U3 sequences within their LTRs were identified
and mapped by a systemic search of the mouse genome
database (C57BL/6J strain) using each U3 sequence as a
probe. When the search homology was limited to â¥ 98%,
different U3 probes often resulted in an overlapping set of
putative MuERVs. A total of 59 unique putative MuERVs
were identified and their genomic map was established
(Table 2). The size (5'-end of 5' LTR to 3'-end of 3' LTR) of
these MuERVs ranged between 5,312 bp and 9,054 bp.
Among them, the U3 sequences of six putative MuERVs
(marked with "c") (K-4-11.1b, U-4-8.1, U-4-8.5, U-48.11, U-4-8.18, and U-4-11.1) had 100 % homology with
the respective U3 sequences isolated from burn mice. In
addition, 13 putative MuERVs (marked with "b") harbored U3 sequences matching 100 % to their respective
U3 sequences isolated from no burn mice. The precise
location and orientation on the genome, proviral genome
size, PBS, and coding potential for the three major retroviral polypeptides of each putative MuERV were also characterized. In regard to PBS, the 18 bp sequences located
immediately downstream of 5' LTR were surveyed to
determine the PBS of each putative MuERV. The tRNAGln
(indicated as "Q" in the table) primer is known to be used
by the reverse transcriptase of polytropic as well as modified polytropic MuERVs during replication. In contrast,
the tRNAPro (indicated as "P" in the table) primer is predominantly used by ecotropic and xenotropic MuERVs.
Except for the two putative MuERVs (L-3-9.5 and U-411.1) harboring a tRNAPro PBS, the rest (57 putative
MuERVs) had a tRNAGln PBS. The results from the analyses
of coding potentials revealed that the majority of putative
MuERVs had a defective genome leading to a missing start
codon and/or introduction of a premature stop codon.
However, 16 of them retained intact open reading frames
(ORFs) for all three retroviral polypeptides (gag, pol, and
env), therefore, they were presumed to be full-length

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/440

ERVs. Some of those defective MuERVs had intact ORFs
for gag, pol, and/or env polypeptides. The putative MuERVs
cloned by U3 probes, which were presumed to originate
from the burn-induced U3 fragments, will be the primary
focus for future studies.
Examination of evolutionary relationship among putative
MuERVs by phylogenetic analysis of their reverse
transcriptases
Due to the highly conserved nature of the reverse transcriptase (RT) among different retroviruses compared to
the rest of viral proteins, the RT sequence has been used to
determine phylogenetic relationships among retroviruses
as well as other retroelements [24,25]. To examine the
evolutionary relationship of the putative MuERVs identified in this study, a phylogenetic tree of RT sequences was
constructed following a multiple alignment analysis (Figure 4). This phylogenetic analysis was based on the seven
conserved domains of the RT, a total of 178 amino acids,
which served as a reference for a number of evolutionary
studies [24]. Among the 59 putative MuERVs, only 42 of
them were subjected to the analysis because the other 17
MuERVs had an incomplete RT due to a deletion and/or
premature stop. It appeared that they were subgrouped
into four main branches (I ~ IV). The putative MuERVs
derived from the same U3 probes tended to cluster into
the same branches. Interestingly, four out of the five putative MuERVs (red triangle) identified using the U3 probes
from burn mice (K-4-11, U-4-8, and U-4-11) clustered
into a unique branch (III), implicating a close evolutionary relationship. It needs to be noted that these MuERVs
had 100 % sequence homology with the respective U3
probes used for mapping.
Examination of tropism of 16 putative full-length MuERVs
by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
The MuERV coding sequences are relatively conserved
except for the env sequences. For instance, the env amino
acid sequences of ecotropic MuERVs are substantially
divergent from the other classes (xenotropic, polytropic,
and modified polytropic) [26,27]. MuERVs can be
grouped into four different classes (ecotropic, xenotropic,
polytropic, and modified polytropic) based on restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) following digestion with three enzymes (BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII) [27].
In this experiment, 16 putative full-length MuERVs with
intact coding potentials for all three polypeptides were
subjected to an in silico RFLP analysis to determine their
tropism (Figure 5). Six (U-1-5.5b, K-4-11.2, K-4-11.4b, K4-11.10b, K-4-11.11a, and K-4-11.X) of them were polytropic and another six (K3-3.3b, K-3-3.5b, K-3-3.10b, K-33.11a, K-3-3.11c, and K-3-6.7) were modified polytropic.
The RFLP tropism data (polytropic and modified polytropic) was consistent with the results regarding the tropism of the corresponding U3 probes/sequences (Table 1

Phylogenetic relationship of RTs of putative MuERVs
Phylogenetic relationship of RTs of putative MuERVs. Seven conserved domains of full-length RT sequences from 42

and Figure 5). In addition, four putative MuERVs (L-12.19, L-1-2.8a, K-3-5.13, and L-3-9.5) had unique RFLP
profiles, which did not match with the reference, suggesting "xenotropic-like" tropism [26,27]. Further investigation is necessary to confirm the tropism of these four
"xenotropic-like" putative MuERVs.
Genetic evidence of recombination events in certain
putative MuERVs
There are two unique features of MuERVs: two identical
(at least at the time of integration) copies of flanking LTRs
and a short direct repeat created at the genomic target during integration. They serve as indicators of integration
ages as well as genomic recombination events that
occurred in the host after the initial integration. The integration age of MuERVs can be estimated based on the
degree of accumulated mutations within the presumed to
be identical flanking LTRs of each MuERV. Among the 59
putative MuERVs examined, only 6 of them had mutations within each pair of LTRs ranging from 0.1349 % to
0.2869 % (Table 3). The integration ages of these MuERVs

were calculated based on a formula of "0.13 % mutation
rate between two flanking LTRs/one million years (MYr)"
[28]. The integration ages of the putative MuERVs analyzed in this study ranged from 1.037 MYr to 2.206 MYr.
In addition, as an indicator of genomic rearrangements
between MuERVs as well as in other parts of the genome,
we examined a short stretch of sequences (4 bp to 12 bp)
flanking each MuERV for a direct repeat. It turned out that
11 out of 59 MuERVs were not flanked by a direct repeat,
indicating that they were formed via recombination
between two different MuERVs (Table 3). The rest had
direct repeats of 4 bp except for the U-1-5.15 MuERV,
which had direct repeats of 12 bp.
Host genes near the integration sites of putative MuERVs
The U3 promoter and enhancer sequences residing in the
MuERV LTRs often regulate the transcriptional activities of
neighboring host genes at different levels (e.g., primary
transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation) [4-6]. To
gain insights regarding potential roles of the putative
MuERVs identified in this study, host genes within 110 kb

Tropism5analysis of putative full-length MuERVs
Tropism analysis of putative full-length MuERVs. Cellular tropism of 16 putative full-length MuERVs was determined by
in silico RFLP analysis using three restriction enzymes (BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII). Relative locations of each restriction enzyme
site were mapped on each MuERV. Expected RFLP patterns of ecotropic and xenotropic MuERVs are presented on the bottom
as a reference [27].

upstream and downstream from the integration sites of
each putative MuERVs were identified (Table 4). Nine
putative MuERVs were integrated within the introns of
various types of host genes, either in the same or opposite
orientation. This suggests that expression of these host
genes might be controlled by the U3 promoter and
enhancer sequences of the respective putative MuERVs. In
addition, at least one known host gene was identified
from the 42 putative MuERVs (total of 145 genes) within
the search range (see Additional file 1, Table S2). For
instance, the K-3-3.13 putative MuERV was integrated

near a cluster of various isotypes of histone genes on chromosome 13. Other host genes found near the integration
sites of selective putative MuERVs include Selp, F5, Fcgr3a,
and Scpep1, which are known to participate in various
physiologic processes, such as inflammation and vascular
wall homeostasis [31-34]. Although these putative
MuERVs are not located within the host genes, their LTRs
are still capable of controlling the transcriptional activities
of nearby host genes. No known host genes were mapped
near the integration sites of the last eight putative MuERVs
within the search range.

Discussion
Burn-elicited stress signals are directly linked to pathologic changes in distant organs contributing to systemic
inflammatory responses syndrome and often multiple
organ failure [29,30]. The results from our previous studies demonstrated that the expression of certain MuERVs
was differentially altered in various tissues of mice after
burn, suggesting that MuERVs may play a role in postburn pathologic changes. Involvement of ERVs in inflammatory disease processes was exemplified by the direct
role of syncytin, an envelope protein of HERV-W, in the
development of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease [16]. In addition, ERVs are implicated in an array of
other diseases such as breast cancer, schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, IDDM, myeloid leukemia, and T cell
lymphoma [9,17-19,31-34]. However, a substantial
amount of further studies are essential to gain clear
insights into the ERVs' role in a number of disease processes, including systemic response after burn injury.
In this study, we confirmed that burn-elicited stress signals alter the expression of certain MuERVs in a U3 promoter- and tissue- specific manner. During the course of
this study, 31 unique MuERV U3 sequences were identified from distant organs (liver, ling, and kidney) of burn
and no burn mice. Size-based comparison analysis of the
differentially expressed U3 fragments (RT-PCR products)
and 31 U3 clones allowed us to determine whether the U3
clones are derived from the burn-induced U3 fragments.
Each U3 promoter sequence had a unique transcription
potential. It is likely that burn-elicited stress signals alter
the intracellular transcription environment by activation
or inactivation of certain transcription factors in a cell
type- and tissue-specific manner, thereby, leading to differential genome-wide regulation of specific MuERVs. The
MuERVs that were induced after a burn may have a pathophysiologic role in the systemic response different from
repressed MuERVs. It was of interest to note that the U3
expression profiles in all three tissues of no burn mice
(subjected to anesthesia and resuscitation only) at 3 hours
were significantly different from the profiles at 24 hours.
In addition, the U3 profiles of no burn mice at both time
points did not match corresponding control tissues harvested without any treatment. These findings suggest that
the initial treatments (anesthesia and resuscitation) during the burn procedure contributed to changes in the U3
expression profiles in a tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, the genomic U3 profile was distantly related to the
U3 expression profiles from both burn and no burn mice,
including mice without any treatment. It suggests that not
all MuERVs on the mouse genome were actively transcribed and/or responded to stress signals in the tissues
examined in this study. It will be worthwhile to perform a
comprehensive examination of the MuERV expression
profile in various cell types as well as tissue types.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/440

Several transcription regulatory elements were identified
more frequently in U3 sequences isolated from burn mice.
These include binding sites for HMGA1/2, C/EBPÎ², PAX6,
SZF1, and Thing1/E47 heterodimer. These genes are
known to participate in various normal as well as pathologic processes, such as SZF1's role in hematopoiesis and
the involvement of C/EBPÎ² in the regulation of proinflammatory genes [35-37]. In addition, recent reports
demonstrated that HMGA1 functions as a mediator of the
development of sepsis, as evidenced by its increased
serum levels in patients with septic shock [38]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that four of the U3 sequences (K-45 U3, K-4-10 U3, L-4-3 U3, and U-4-1 U3) whose transcriptional activities are presumed to be induced in burn
mice were clustered into a unique branch (Figure 3) and
all have the HMGA1/2 binding element. We can speculate
that the elevated systemic levels of HMGA1 protein during
burn-elicited septic development may enhance transcriptional activities of certain MuERV U3 promoters, such as
K-4-5 U3, K-4-10 U3, L-4-3 U3, and U-4-1 U3, through
the HMGA1/1 binding element. It will be necessary to
determine whether the transcription regulatory elements,
predominantly present on the U3 promoters from burn
mice, interact with corresponding proteins which in turn
result in altered transcriptional activities. In addition, two
hormone-related binding elements for steroidogenic factor 1 and estrogen-related receptor 1, were identified in
both burn and no burn groups. It is possible that these elements may play a role in MuERV responses to changes in
hormone levels due to various types of stress signals [3941]. Since there is an increase in systemic glucocorticoid
levels after burn, we tried to find a glucocorticoid response
element on the U3 promoters isolated from burn mice,
but we were not able to.
Almost all ERVs are considered to be defective in their
genomic organization, and as a result, they are not capable of encoding intact retroviral polypeptides and are replication-incompetent. In this study, in silico mapping/
cloning experiments using the 31 U3 sequences as a probe
revealed 59 putative MuERVs. Among them, 16 putative
MuERVs retained coding potentials for all three retroviral
polypeptides and at least 12 of them were classified as polytropic or modified polytropic in regard to their tropism.
These findings indicate that a substantial fraction of the
MuERV population on the mouse genome is capable of
encoding functional proteins and can infect host cells
when they are activated for replication. Another group of
putative MuERVs, defective in their genome structures,
had intact coding potentials for gag, pol, and/or env
polypeptides and it is likely that changes in the expression
of these individual proteins affect the host cells' normal
physiology, such as overexpression of syncytin in the
brain of multiple sclerosis patients. It might be necessary

to further characterize the biological roles of MuERVs presumed to be derived from U3 probes induced after burn.
One of the key findings from this study was that the
majority of putative MuERVs are integrated into introns or
near the host genes, suggesting that burn-mediated regulation of some of these MuERVs may be linked to the
expression of neighboring host genes. The U-1-7.1 putative MuERV was integrated between exon 1 and exon 2 of
the cathepsin E gene, which is essential for immune
defense against microbial pathogens via its protease activity [42]. Interestingly, the U-1-7 U3 probe was derived
from the lung and cathepsin E was differentially expressed
in the lung compared to other tissues, such as kidney [43].
In addition, the L-1-1.8 putative MuERV derived from the
L-1-1 U3 probe (isolated from the liver of no burn mice)
was integrated between exon 2 and 3 of chromosome
domain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 9 (CHD9), a chromosome remodelling factor [44,45]. Our recent study
provided evidence suggesting a potential chromosomal
remodelling in the liver after burn [46]. It will be of interest to investigate whether the U3 promoter and enhancer
sequences of the L-1-1.8 putative MuERV affect the expression of CHD9 in the liver after burn. Furthermore, the U4-11.1 putative MuERV, which was derived from the U-411 U3 probe (isolated from the lung of burn mice), was
integrated near a cluster of immunoglobulin gamma
(IgG) Fc receptor genes. Among these IgG Fc receptors,
Fcgr3a has been described as a susceptibility factor for
autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis [47-49]. An investigation
into the role of the U-4-11.1 putative MuERV in the transcriptional control of IgG Fc receptor genes after burn,
especially the Fcgr3a gene, will allow us to better understand interactions between this MuERV locus and nearby
IgG Fc receptors.

Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated that burn-elicited stress
signals were responsible for a differential genome-wide
alteration in MuERV expression in a tissue- and U3 promoter-specific manner. Biological properties of the 59
putative MuERVs, which were isolated using the U3
sequences as a probe, were examined in silico and their
potential roles in post-burn pathologic changes were discussed. Further characterization of the full-length as well
as defective MuERVs identified in this study is warranted
to gain insights into their biological roles, including their
interaction/relationship with neighboring genes, in both
normal physiology and disease states of the host.

Methods
Animal experiments
Female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor,
ME) were housed according to the guidelines of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/440

National Institutes of Health. The Animal Use and Care
Administrative Advisory Committee of the University of
California, Davis, approved the experimental protocol.
The burn protocol employed in this study has been
described previously [20]. Briefly, under general anesthesia, an approximately 18 % total body surface area (TBSA)
full-thickness flame burn injury was generated on the
shaved back of mice accompanied by immediate resuscitation. Control mice were shaved, anesthetized, and resuscitated, but not burned. Three mice from each group were
sacrificed by CO2 inhalation for tissue (liver, lung, and
kidney) collection at 3 hours and 24 hours after burn. In
addition, no treatment control mice (three) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation for tissue collection.
RT-PCR analysis of MuERV expression
Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed
based on protocols described previously [20]. Briefly,
total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.,
Valencia, CA) and 100 ng of total RNA from each tissue
sample was subjected to reverse transcription using Sensiscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen Inc.). A set of primers, ERV-U1 (5'-CGG GCG ACT CAG TCT ATC GG-3') and
ERV-U2 (5'-CAG TAT CAC CAA CTC AAA TC-3'), were
used to amplify the MuERV U3 region. These primers have
previously been used to amplify non-ecotropic MuERV
U3 regions [50].
Western blot analysis
Protein extracts were prepared from snap-frozen tissues
and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously [51]. Briefly, the membrane, blocked in 5% horse
serum, was incubated with goat antibody specific for
gp69/71 of Rauscher murine leukemia virus (MLV)
(ViroMed Biosafety Laboratories, Camden, NJ) followed
by anti-goat-HRP antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The reactive signal was visualized via chemiluminescence.
Cloning and sequence analysis
PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen Inc.) and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy
vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNAs for
sequencing analysis were prepared using a Qiaprep Spin
Miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc.). Sequencing was performed at
Davis Sequencing Inc. (Davis, CA) using the ABI Prism
377 DNA sequencer from PE Biosystems (Foster City,
CA).
Multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses
The U3 promoter sequences and conserved 178 amino
acid residues of RT sequences were aligned using Lasergene (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) and/or Vector NTI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) [25]. Phylogenetic trees were
established using the neighbor-joining method within the

performed with 100 replications within the program.

ures, and drafted the manuscript. RT performed the Western blot experiment. All authors read and approved the
final manuscript.

Transcription regulatory elements on MuERV U3
sequences
The profile of transcription regulatory elements on the U3
promoter sequences was determined using the MatInspector program from Genomatix (Munich, Germany). The
parameters were set at a core similarity of 90 %, resulting
in a 10 % or less mismatch within the core sequence and
the matrix similarity was optimized to reduce false positives [54].

Additional material

In silico cloning/mapping of putative MuERVs using U3
sequences as a probe and ORF analysis
Putative MuERV sequences were identified by surveying
the entire mouse (C57BL/6J) genome database from the
NCBI using individual U3 promoter sequences as a probe.
Initially, the genomic U3 sequences with greater than 97
% homology with respective U3 probes were selected for
further cloning/mapping analyses. We then searched for
putative MuERV sequences in the genome ranging from
approximately 5 kb to 9 kb and flanked by almost identical LTRs at both 5' and 3' ends. Subsequently, these putative MuERV sequences were subjected to ORF analyses for
gag, pol, and env polypeptides using reference retroviral
sequences encoding intact polypeptides (GenBank accession number: AF033811, J02255, DQ241301, S80082,
M17327, and AAO37285).
Analyses of tropism, primer binding sites (PBSs), and
neighboring cellular genes of putative MuERVs
Cellular tropism of 16 putative full-length MuERVs were
determined by in silico RFLP analysis using three restriction enzymes, BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII, using Vector
NTI (Invitrogen). The RFLP data of each putative MuERV
were compared to the reference profiles for each tropism
(ecotropic, xenotropic, polytropic, and modified polytropic) [27]. A stretch of 18 bp, located immediately
downstream of the 5' U5 region, was examined to determine PBSs for all putative MuERVs identified in this study.
The conserved PBS sequences for tRNAProline(P) and tRNAGlutamine(Q) were used as a references [55,56]. In addition,
host genes residing near (within 110 kb upstream and 110
kb downstream) the individual integration sites of putative MuERVs were mapped based on the NCBI and
Ensemble mouse genome database [57].
