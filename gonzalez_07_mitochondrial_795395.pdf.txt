Abstract
Background: The out of Africa hypothesis has gained generalized consensus. However, many
specific questions remain unsettled. To know whether the two M and N macrohaplogroups that
colonized Eurasia were already present in Africa before the exit is puzzling. It has been proposed
that the east African clade M1 supports a single origin of haplogroup M in Africa. To test the validity
of that hypothesis, the phylogeographic analysis of 13 complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
sequences and 261 partial sequences belonging to haplogroup M1 was carried out.
Results: The coalescence age of the African haplogroup M1 is younger than those for other M
Asiatic clades. In contradiction to the hypothesis of an eastern Africa origin for modern human
expansions out of Africa, the most ancestral M1 lineages have been found in Northwest Africa and
in the Near East, instead of in East Africa. The M1 geographic distribution and the relative ages of
its different subclades clearly correlate with those of haplogroup U6, for which an Eurasian
ancestor has been demonstrated.
Conclusion: This study provides evidence that M1, or its ancestor, had an Asiatic origin. The
earliest M1 expansion into Africa occurred in northwestern instead of eastern areas; this early
spread reached the Iberian Peninsula even affecting the Basques. The majority of the M1a lineages
found outside and inside Africa had a more recent eastern Africa origin. Both western and eastern
M1 lineages participated in the Neolithic colonization of the Sahara. The striking parallelism
between subclade ages and geographic distribution of M1 and its North African U6 counterpart
strongly reinforces this scenario. Finally, a relevant fraction of M1a lineages present today in the
European Continent and nearby islands possibly had a Jewish instead of the commonly proposed
Arab/Berber maternal ascendance.

Background
The reconstruction of human history is a multidisciplinary objective. Alternative models proposed to explain
the origin and dispersion of modern humans on the basis

of paleoanthropological data [1] have received uneven
support from other disciplines. From a genetic perspective, uniparental non-recombining markers have depicted
the most complete and coherent picture of the origin of

modern humans, clearly favoring the recent out-of-Africa
hypothesis. The greatest diversity and the deepest phylogenetic branches for both Y-chromosome [2,3] and
mtDNA [4,5] have been found in Africa. These African lineages have coalescence ages [6-9] compatible with a recent
African origin of modern humans as proposed by fossil
[10,11] and archaeological studies [12]. Furthermore,
only more derived lineages have been found out of Africa
supporting the hypothesis that, in their worldwide dispersion, modern humans replaced archaic humans inside
and outside Africa. It seems that radiation in Africa of Ychromosome M168 derived lineages [13] and L3 mtDNA
lineages [14] preceded the out-of-Africa expansion. Focusing on mtDNA, all non-African lineages belong to two
founder clusters, named M and N, which share a common
root with their L3 African counterpart. Two possible outof-Africa routes have been proposed: A southern coastal
route bordering the Read Sea and an Eurasian continental
route through the Levant. Based on mitochondrial phylogeography it was proposed that M lineages expanded with
the coastal route to southern Asia and Oceania and N lineages by the continental route to Eurasia [7]. However, the
posterior detection of primitive N lineages in southern
areas as India [15,16] and Australia [6,17] weakened that
hypothesis [18]. As, in addition, the founder ages of M
and N are very similar, the alternative hypothesis, that M
and N founders derived from a single African migration,
was favored by several authors [16,19-21]. Another
related disjunctive yet not settled is whether M and N (and
its main branch R) arose inside or outside Africa [20]. The
detection of a basal branch of haplogroup M in Africa
(M1) gave support to the idea that haplogroup M originated in eastern Africa and was carried towards Asia with
the out-of-Africa expansion [22]. The alternative hypothesis, that haplogroup M1 could trace a posterior backflow
to Africa from Asia, considered by several authors
[7,21,23,24] has not yet gained experimental support
because, until now, no ancestral M1 lineages have been
found outside Africa [21,24,25].
To shed light on this haplogroup we have constructed a
phylogeny of the M1 clade based on the analysis of 13
complete or nearly complete mitochondrial sequences
representing the main branches of M1 and realized a phylogeographic study using 261 partial M1 sequences to
determine the most probable age and origin of this clade
and the temporal and spatial frame of its secondary
expansions in Africa and Eurasia.

Results
Although we have only completely sequenced a limited
number of M1 lineages, the combination of HVSI haplotypes and RFLP status carried out for the rest of our M1
samples allow us to be confident that we have not missed
any new basic M1 lineage.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/223

As an outgroup of the M1 genomic phylogenetic tree (Fig.
1) we used a published Indian M30 complete sequence
[25]. When this M30 lineage is compared to the rare M
sequence previously detected in two Palestinians [26], it is
evident that it belongs to the Indian super-clade M4'30, as
it shares the basal mutation 12007. More specifically it
belongs to the M30 branch because it also has transition
15431. M30 has a broad geographic, ethnic and linguistic
range in India. It has been detected in northern and southern India, in Australoid and Caucasoids, and in Dravid
and Indo-European speakers [24,25]. So, instead of an
autochthonous Near East M lineage, its presence in Palestine is probably due to a recent gene flow from India. After
careful re-reading and partial re-sequencing of two previously published M1 sequences [7], we have detected in
them the following errors: both have the 12950C transversion, and, in addition M1,1 has the 6671 transition and
M1,2 the 13111 transition. Taking these modifications
into account, from the M basal type, haplogroup M1 is
characterized by one transversion (12950C) and four
transitions (6446, 6680, 12403, and 14110) in the coding
region and by a five transitions motif (195, 16129, 16189,
16249, and 16311) in the non-coding region (Fig. 1). This
haplogroup can be RFLP diagnosed by a MnlI site loss at
position 12402. Two main branches, M1c and M1abde,
respectively defined by transitions 13111 and 6671,
sprout from the root. Based on partial sequences M1c was
defined by transition 16185 [21]. However, not all M1c
lineages present this mutation that, in addition, recurrently appears in a M1b1 lineage. It seems that for population studies M1c could be better diagnosed by a DdeI
site loss using a modified reverse primer (Table 1). It is
surprising that none of the three M1c complete sequences
have an eastern Africa ancestry: one (Jor771) has a Levantine origin and the other two belong to West sub-Saharan
Africa (SER558) and West Mediterranean (VAL1881)
areas. The latter two sequences conform a new M1c1 subclade defined by transitions 10895 and 16399 that can be
RFLP diagnosed at 10895 position (Table 1). In relation to
the M1abde cluster, it is also surprising that one lineage
that directly branched out from the root (BER957) has a
northwestern, not eastern, Berber ancestry. All the rest of
lineages shared the 813 transition forming the M1abd
cluster. Again, an isolate offshoot of Basque ancestry
(BASV82) sprouts from its root. Subclade M1b was characterized by an RFLP site gain (+15882 AvaII) and loss of
-15883 HaeIII [22]. Later an M1b subclade defined by the
non-coding motif 16260–16320 and restricted to East
Africans was identified [21]. Consistently, none of our
M1b sequences from western areas has that motif. The last
cluster, M1a, was first distinguished by RFLP +12345 RsaI
[22] and, after that, further characterized by transition
16359 [21]. In addition it also has transition 3705 at its
root (Fig. 1). M1a is the most prominent clade in eastern
Africa. However, its expansion occurred later than the

other M1 branches (Fig. 1). An M1a subclade, M1a2,
defined by transition 9053, that can be RFLP diagnosed
(Table 1), testifies a posterior spread of M1a to western
Asia.

Geographic distribution of M1
Figure 2 shows the reduced median network obtained
from the 261 M1 haplotypes found in a global search
comprising more than 38,713 HVSI sequences. In Africa,
haplogroup M1 has supra-equatorial distribution (see
additional files 1 and 2). As previously reported its highest
frequencies and diversities (Table 2) are found in Ethiopia
in particular and in East Africa in general. Two appreciable
gradients exist. Frequencies significantly diminished from
East to West and also going South to sub-Saharan areas.
M1 is not uncommon in the Mediterranean basin showing a peak in the Iberian Peninsula. However, it is rare in

continental Europe. Although in low frequencies, its presence in the Middle East has been well established from the
South of the Arabian Peninsula to Anatolia and from the
Levant to Iran. The central HVSI haplotype (16129–
16189–16223–16249–16311) has been found only once
in northwestern India [27]. Another possible Indian M1
candidate is the derived sequence: 16086–16129–16223–
16249–16259–16311 [28]. However, in two recent studies in which 24 [24] and 56 [25] Indian M complete
sequences were analyzed no ancestral M1 lineages have
been found. M1 haplotypes have also been occasionally
spotted in the Caucasus and the Trans Caucasus [23,29]
and in Central Asia [30]. It seems that, going east, M1 even
reached the Tibet as the HVSI diagnostic motif was sampled there [31]. However, although haplotypes sharing
four of the five HVSI transitions defining M1 (16129–
16223–16249–16278–16311–16362;
16129–16223–
16234–16249–16311–16362) have been sampled in
Thailand and Han Chinese [32,33], complete sequencing
have unequivocally allocated them in the D4a branch of
D, the most abundant haplogroup representing M in East
Asia. As commented previously, this is a clear example of
the danger of establishing affinities between geographically distant areas only on the basis of HVSI homologies
as, often, they are the product of geographic isolation and
molecular convergence [18]. Within this sparse but geographically wide range of M1 distribution its three identified branches also had uneven radiations. Although M1a
(HVSI identified by the 16359 transition) is present in all
the M1 range, its greatest frequencies and diversities are
found in Ethiopia and eastern Africa (Table 2), pointing to
this area as the most probable origin of the M1a expansion in all directions, with particular incidence in western
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Not all the M1b lineages can
be HVSI identified; however, several specific subclades
have different locations. Those characterized by transitions 16260–16320 [21], and by presence of 16182 transition and 16265C transversion [22] are restricted to
Ethiopia with occasional spreads to eastern Africa. In
addition, there is an M1b branch, identified by 16185
transition and 16190 deletion that has a northwestern distribution excepting a Jordan haplotype (Fig. 2). Despite
that M1c cannot be unequivocally defined by transition
16185, it can be stated that M1c is an overwhelmingly
Northwest African clade which spreads to the Mediterranean and West sub-Saharan Africa areas. Finally, other
unclassified M1 branches have also different geographic
ranges. Those identified by the presence of 16357 transition and by the reversion of the diagnostic position 16129
are of Ethiopian eastern Africa adscription, while clusters
characterized by loss of the diagnostic position 16223 and
by the 16399 transition have a northwestern distribution
(Fig. 2). However, M1 assignation of haplotypes, which
lack any of the basic positions, based only on HVSI information is risky when they share other diagnostic positions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/223

with different haplogroups. For instance, the Russian haplotype 16183C–16189–16249–16311, classified as M1
on the basis of its HVSI sequence [34] also matches with
haplotypes assigned to the U1a clade [35].
The presence in the Mediterranean basin and in West subSaharan Africa of M1a and M1c lineages can be taken as
proof that these areas received influences both from the
West and East North African centers of M1 radiation.
Quantitative confirmation of the above described patterns
are provided by AMOVA and pairwise distances based on
FST analyses using the groups and populations described
in Material and Methods and taking into account haplotypic molecular differences. As usual the bulk of the variation, 90%, is within populations, 6% is due to
differences among groups and 4% to differences among
populations within groups. Pairwise differences between
populations (Table 3) offer a more detailed view. There is
homogeneity between populations within eastern Africa,
small differences (p < 0.05) within western Africa and
strong heterogeneity between these main areas (p <
0.001). On the contrary, Iberian Peninsula has significant
differences with the rest of Europe. In turn, West Asia conforms an homogenous continuum with East Africa and
Europe excepting Iberian Peninsula and the latter is not
significantly different of western Africa. All these results
can be explained as due to the differential radiation of
M1a from East Africa and M1c from Northwest Africa, the
Iberian Peninsula being mostly influenced by Northwest
Africa and the rest of Europe and western Asia by East
Africa.
M1 haplotypes in Jews
Several M1 haplotypes have been detected in Jewish communities albeit in low frequencies [36,37]. However,
when compared with non-Jew populations they show significantly higher frequencies for the whole M1 haplogroup (p = 33.54***) and for M1a in particular (p =
24.90***). The only striking exception is that of the
Moroccan Jews for which no M1 lineages have been
detected at all [36]. Interestingly, all M1 lineages found in
Jews, except two, belong to the eastern clade M1a (Fig. 2).
Therefore, as for the bulk of the M1 Near East haplotypes,
the most probable origin of these Jewish M1 lineages is
the result of an eastern African expansion around 5000
years ago. Another peculiarity of M1 in Jewish communities is its reduced haplotypic diversity (Table 2) which has
been already detected for other mtDNA lineages [36,38].
In addition, there is a strong M1 geographic differentiation among Jewish communities. For example, all European Ashkenazi Jews have only one M1a lineage
characterized by a transition in the 16289 position that
has not been detected in other Jew or non-Jew populations. Similarly, all West Asian Jews shared an identical
M1a motif characterized by a transition in the 16209 posi-

tion that has been detected only once in Ethiopia. These
results are congruent with the proposition that, in the
majority of the cases, Jewish migrations implied strong
maternal founder effects [36-38]. Nevertheless, as M1a
Jewish lineages are unique and different in different
groups, we think that its source Near East population
should not suffer strong genetic bottlenecks. Finally, it is
worth mentioning that M1 frequencies of Jewish groups
and their host populations are significantly correlated (r =
0.942**) which suggests that some genetic interchange
must have happened between them as already proposed
by others authors [36,37].
Radiation ages and evolution of lineages
Radiation ages for M1 and its subhaplogroups have been
estimated on the basis of complete coding and HVSI
sequences using different mutation rate estimations
(Table 4). The ages obtained for M1 and M1a from HVSI
data are more coherent with those calculated for the coding region using the Ingman et al. [6] mutation rate than
that proposed by Mishmar et al. [8]. Our coalescence age
estimations for the whole M1 clade (20,000–30,000
years) are younger than those previously published [22];
however, the approximate expansion ages for the eastern
Africa M1a subclade (10,000–20,000 years) are in the
same range. Although standard errors overlap, it seems
that the northwestern Africa expansion represented by
M1c subclade (19,040 ± 4916 years), preceded the M1a
eastern Africa expansion (16,756 ± 5997) M1b being the
youngest branch (10,155 ± 3590). It must be stated that
coalescence ages are only rough estimations biased by
mutation rate estimations, small sample size, demographic history and, possibly, selection. There are recent
examples of clock-like evolution violations in several
mtDNA lineages that have been explained by selective or
demographic effects [39-41]. Here, subclade M1a2 (Fig. 1)
represents a new example of constant mutation rate violation. The mean number of substitutions accumulated in
M1a2 lineages (12.5 ± 0.7) is significantly higher (p =
0.008) than that in the rest of M1 lineages (8.4 ± 1.3). This

result is not compatible with a uniform rate of evolution.
The small standard errors show that there is high lineage
homogeneity within groups, which weakens the possibility that stochastic processes have played a main role. Different patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous
changes among different lineages have been taken as hints
of a role for selection in other studies [8,39]. In our case
differences between synonymous vs. nonsynonymous
changes within groups does not reach statistical signification (p = 0.75). However, the mean number of coding
region substitutions accumulated in M1a2 lineages (11 ±
0.0) is significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in the rest of
M1 (5.6 ± 0.7). Conversely, the mean number of regulatory region substitutions accumulated in M1a2 lineages
(1.5 ± 0.7) is smaller than in the rest (2.8 ± 0.9) although
not reaching statistical significance (p = 0.175). If the
mutation rate was constant along the whole mtDNA molecule, for each mutation in the regulatory region roughly
fourteen mutations should accumulate in the coding
region. However, selection pressure is higher in the coding
than in the regulatory region so that the substitution rate
is ten times faster in the latter. The mean coding/regulatory ratio is 8.3 for M1a2 lineages and only 2.4 for the rest
of M1. We interpret these results as due to different ages of
expansion between clades. M1a2 would be the youngest
clade with a more recent expansion than the others so that
purifying selection has not had enough time to eliminate
mutations with small deleterious effects in the coding
region. We think that differences in the rate of evolution
among subgroups of the North African U6 haplogroup
[40] could be better explained by the same pattern assuming that the U6a subclade, with the highest coding/regulatory ratio, had a more recent radiation than the U6b
subclade. In spite of its anomalous behavior, M1a2 has
only a minor effect on the estimation of the whole M1
coalescence age although its omission significantly diminishes that of the M1a subgroup (Table 4).

Discussion
Phylogeographic parallelism between M1 and U6
haplogroups
There are striking similarities between the geographical
dispersals and radiation ages observed here for M1 lineages and those previously published for the North African
U6 haplogroup [40]. It was proposed that U6a first spread
was in Northwest Africa around 30,000 ya. Coalescence
ages for M1 also fit into this period and the oldest clade
M1c has an evident northwestern Africa distribution;
however it had to have a wide geographic range as some
M1c lineages are today still present in Jordanians (Figs. 1
and 2). It is curious that this prehistoric Near Eastern colonization was also pointed out by the uniqueness of the
U6a haplotypes detected in that area. A posterior East to
West African expansion around 17,000 ya was indicated
by the U6a1 relative diversity and distribution. Again, age,
relative East to West diversities and geographic range accurately correspond with the M1a1 expansion detected here.
More recent local spread of lineages U6b and U6c also
parallel the M1b and M1c1 distributions. Furthermore,
these similarities also hold outside Africa. U6 lineages in
the Iberian Peninsula have been considered traces of
northward expansions from Africa. Based on the uneven
distribution of U6a and U6b lineages in Iberia, with the
former predominating in southern and the latter in northern areas, it was proposed that U6b in Iberia represents a
signal of a prehistoric North African immigration whereas
the presence of U6a could be better attributed to the long
lasting historic Arab/Berber occupation [40]. Again, this
pattern is accurately repeated by the M1c and M1a distribution in the Iberian Peninsula, the northwest African M1
being more abundant in northern areas (56%) and the
East African M1a in southern areas (85%) although, due
to the small sample size, difference does not reach a significant level (p = 0.07). Additional support to the
hypothesis of a prehistoric introduction are the recently
detected presence of a Northwest African M1c lineage in a
Basque cemetery dated to the 6th–7th centuries AD, prior

to the Moorish occupation [42], and the ancestral phylogenetic position of another Basque M1d sequence (Fig. 1)
that does not match any African sequence. Finally, two
autochthonous U6 lineages (U6b1 and U6c1) traced the
origin of the Canary Islands prehispanic aborigines to
Northwest Africa [43]. Although exclusive M1 lineages
have not been detected in the Canary Islands, it is worth
mentioning that those sampled belong to the Northwest
African area [44]. Outside Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, as with U6, M1 has been mainly detected in other
Mediterranean areas with main incidences in islands such
as Sicily. It is customary to attribute these incidences to
the above mentioned Arab/Berber historic occupations.
However, taking into account the major Jewish assignation for all the M1a haplotypes detected in Europe, the
possibility of a Jewish maternal ascendance for at least
some of these lineages should not be rejected.
Note that the two M1 lineages sampled in the Balearic
isles were of Jewish adscription [45]. Also, there were well
documented Jewish settlements in Sicily since early
Roman times [46] and, coincidentally, half of the M1 lineages sampled in that island [47,48] belong to the M1a
cluster. Finally, the Atlantic archipelagos of Canaries and
Madeira, where the rigor of the Spanish Inquisition was
stronger, only have M1c representatives. In contrast, in the
Azores Islands, that were used as a refuge by Sephardim
Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula, half of the M1
sequences detected are of M1a assignation [49,50]. These
possible Jewish contributions might be also extended to
the U6 lineages of eastern origin because all U6 haplotypes detected in Ashkenazim and other Jewish groups,
excepting one that is a basal U6a (16172–16219–16278),
belong to the eastern Africa clade U6a1 [36,26]. An additional proof of the striking parallelism between M1 and
U6 lineages is the fact that, as for M1, no U6 representatives were sampled in Moroccan Jews in spite of the high
frequency of this clade in the Moroccan and Berber host
populations [36].

Most probable origin of M1 ancestors
Mitochondrial M lineages in Ethiopia were first detected
by RFLP analyses [51]. To explain its presence in that area
the authors suggested two possibilities: 1) the marker was
acquired by Ethiopians through interchanges with Asians
or 2) it was present in the ancient Ethiopian population
and was carried to Asia by groups who migrated out of
Africa. Later, the second hypothesis was favored and a single origin of haplogroup M in Africa was suggested, dating
the split between Asian and African M branches older than
50,000 ya [22]. Although not completely discarding this
last scenario other authors considered that the disjunctive
was unsettled. The vast diversity of haplogroup M in Asia
compared to Africa pointed to the possibility that M1 is a
branch that traces a backflow from Asia to Africa [7,23].
Due to the scarcity of M lineages in the Near East and its
richness in India, this region was proposed as the most
probable origin of the M1 ancestor [7,52]. However,
recent studies based on Indian mtDNA sequences [24,25]
have not found any positive evidence that M1 originated
in India. Nevertheless, the inclusion of M1 complete
mtDNA lineages in the construction of the macrohaplogroup M phylogeny clearly established that the antiquity
of Indian lineages, as M2, as compared to Ethiopian M1
lineages support an Asian origin of macrohaplogroup M
[24]. Furthermore, the comparison within Africa of eastern and western M1 sequences left the origin of M1 in
Africa uncertain [21]. On the light of our and other
authors results, it seems clear that by their respective coalescence ages and diversities, M1 is younger than other
Asiatic M lineages. Although it is out of doubt that the L3
ancestor of M had an African origin, macrohaplogroup M
radiated outside Africa and M1 should be considered an
evolved branch that signals its return to this continent.
Even more, as the coalescence ages of the northwestern
M1c clade is older than the eastern M1a clade, we think
that the most ancient dispersals of M1 occurred in northwestern Africa, reaching also the Iberian Peninsula,
instead of Ethiopia. The detection of an ancestral M1c
sequence in Jordanians could be explained by two alternative hypotheses: 1) that the Near East was the most probable origin of the primitive M1 dispersals, West into Africa
and East to Central Asia. This supposition would explain
the presence of basic M1 lineages, instead of the most
common M1a derivates, as far as the Tibet. The actual scarcity of these types in eastern areas could be explained by
posterior migrations that erased these primitive lineages.
The absence of these ancestral M1c lineages in Ethiopia
would point to the Sinai Peninsula as the most probable
gate of entrance of this backflow to Africa. 2) That M1 is
an autochthonous North African clade that had its earliest
spread in northwestern areas marginally reaching the
Near East and beyond. This would explain the shortage of
basic M1 lineages in the Near East but would leave the Asiatic origin of the M1 ancestor undetermined. In any case,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/223

both alternatives envisaged M in Africa as an offshoot of
the Asiatic M trunk. The striking phylogeographic parallelism between U6 and M1 haplogroups adds additional
support to these hypotheses. It is possible to correlate the
dispersion ages of the different M1 clades with their contemporary climatic, archaeological, paleoanthropological
and linguistic information. For instance, the first M1 backflow to Africa, dated around 30,000 ya, is coincidental
with a harsh glacial period which suggests that this human
retreat to Africa could be forced by climatic conditions.
The low sea level in the Gibraltar Strait at that time could
also facilitate the Iberian Peninsula colonization. The
northwestern African M1c and the probable north central
M1b expansions are coincidental with the Iberomaurusian and Capsian industries. The anomalous evolution of
M1a2 lineages left the coalescence ages of the eastern
Africa M1a expansion uncertain, but as suggested for the
sister U6a1 radiation; these movements could be correlated in time with an African origin and expansion of
Afroasiatic languages [40]. Finally, from a maternal
genetic perspective it seems that Neolithic occupation of
the Sahara had both eastern and western influences. Most
probably other mtDNA lineages participated in this
human back flow to Africa. It has been suggested that the
North African X1 branch of the Euroasiatic haplogroup X
could be one of them [63].
Whilst this paper was under review, a new paper also dealing with U6 and M1 haplogroups was published [53].
Haplogroup topologies and phylogeographic conclusions
proposed by Olivieri et al. [53] are highly coincidental
with those proposed by us in our previous paper on U6
[40] and in the present paper, dealing with M1. Regrettably, there are differences in nomenclature for M1.
Whereas our M1 phylogeny adhered to that proposed previously by other authors [21], Olivieri et al. [53] chose to
apply their own. Nevertheless, the diagnostic positions for
the different M1 subhaplogroups allowed us to establish
subhaplogroup homologies between the two works.
Clearly their M1b subgroup (defined by transition 13111)
corresponds to our M1c subgroup; their M1a2 subgroup
(defined by transition 15884) corresponds to our M1b
subgroup. Finally, their M1a1 subgroup (defined by transitions at 3705, 12346 and 16359) corresponds to our
M1a subgroup. In addition to the reinforcing overlap of
ideas, it is worthwhile mentioning the high coincidence
for the coalescence ages of M1 and the majority of its subhaplogroups, when the same substitution rate [8] is used.
Olivieri et al. [53] calculated a coalescence time estimate
of 36.8 ± 7.1 ky for the entire haplogroup M1 that
matches our estimate of 35.2 ± 7.1 ky. Our coalescence
time for M1c (25.7 ± 6.6 ky) also overlaps with Olivieri et
al. [53] haplogroup M1b (23.4 ± 5.6 ky). Likewise, the
coalescence age calculated for our M1a subhaplogroup
(22.6 ± 8.1 ky) is in the range of the Olivieri et al. [53] esti-

Page 9 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:223

mation for their M1a1 subhaplogroup (20.6 ± 3.4 ky).
The only discrepancy is about the coalescence time estimate between our M1b subhaplogroup (13.7 ± 4.8 ky)
that is younger than that calculated by Olivieri et al. [53]
for their homologous M1a2 (24.0 ± 5.7 ky). As our calculations are based only on three lineages and that of Oliveri
et al [53] on six, we think that their coalescence time estimation should be more accurate that ours. In fact, when
time estimation is based on the eight different lineages
(AFR-KI43 is common to both sets) a coalescence age of
20.6 ± 5.0 ky is obtained. Although with overlapping
errors, these results, together with the relative ancestral
positions of each subgroup in the phylogenetic tree (Fig.
1), would suggest that the northwestern M1c clade radiation was older than those for the ubiquitous M1b and the
eastern M1a clades, as also proposed by Olivieri et al. [53].

sequences were established using the reduced median network algorithm [56]. In addition to the thirteen complete
or nearly complete M1 sequences, a complete M Indian
sequence [25], assigned to the Indian subhaplogroup
M30, was used as an outgroup.
M1 phylogeographic analyses
Relationships among the different M1 haplotypes were
inferred using the reduced median network algorithm
[56]. To resolve reticulations, the highly recurrent mutations, 16182C, 16183C, 16093 and the in M1 recurrent
16249, were half weighted.

Conclusion
This study provides evidence that M1, or its ancestor, had
an Asiatic origin. The earliest M1 expansion into Africa
occurred in northwestern instead of northeastern areas;
this early spread reached the Iberian Peninsula even
affecting the Basques. The majority of the M1a lineages
found outside and inside Africa had a more recent eastern
Africa origin. Both western and eastern M1 lineages participated in the Neolithic colonization of the Sahara. The
striking parallelism between subclade ages and geographic distribution of M1 and its North African U6 counterpart strongly reinforces this scenario. Finally, a relevant
fraction of M1a lineages present today in the European
Continent and nearby islands possibly had a Jewish
instead of the commonly proposed Arab/Berber maternal
ascendance.

Methods
Lineages
We have analyzed thirteen complete or nearly complete
mtDNA sequences belonging to the M1 subhaplogroup.
Eight of them are new sequences. Two were published previously [7] but have been partially re-sequenced to confirm some dubious diagnostic positions. One additional
Asiatic [54] and two Ethiopian M1 sequences [55] are
from other authors. In addition we analyzed 261 partial
M1 sequences gathered, in a global search, from more
than 38,713 published or unpublished subjects
sequenced mainly for the mtDNA HVSI segment.
Complete mtDNA sequencing
Complete mtDNA were amplified in 32 overlapping fragments with primers and PCR conditions previously
described [7]. The same primers were utilized to directly
sequence both strands of the fragments on an ABI 3100
analyzer using Big-Dye Terminator chemistry (Applied
Biosystems). Sequence data were assembled and com-

Differences in accumulated mutations among M1
branches
The non-parametric test, resampling probability estimates
for the difference between the means of two independent
samples
(http://feculty.vassar.edu/lowry/Vassar
Stats.html) was used to calculate the significance level of
accumulated mutations between the different M1 subclades. Synonymous vs. nonsynonymous substitutions
between lineages were compared by the exact-Fisher test.
Differences between mean number of substitutions for
coding and non-coding regions were t-Student tested.
M1 diversity and differentiation within and between areas
Arlequin package [57] was used to evaluate the M1 diversity within areas using molecular nucleotide diversity (π)
and gene diversity (h). AMOVA was used to test population structure. Pairwise differences between areas were
obtained by means of linearized FST. Contingence tests
were used to compare differences in M1 and M1a frequencies between groups.
Time estimates
For the complete sequences only substitutions in the coding region, excluding indels, were taken into account. The
mean number of substitutions per site to the most common ancestor (ρ) of each clade [58] was estimated, and
converted into time using two substitution rates: 1.7 × 108 [6] and 1.26 × 10-8 [8]. For HVSI, the age of clusters or
expansions was calculated as the mean divergence (ρ)
from inferred ancestral sequence types [58] and converted
into time by assuming that one transition within np
16090–16365 corresponds to 20,180 years [59]. The
standard deviation of the ρ estimator was calculated as
previously described [60]. Ages for HVSI of complete
sequences were also independently calculated.
