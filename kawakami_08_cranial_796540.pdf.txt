Abstract
Background: Little is known about the molecular mechanism which regulates how the whole
cranium is shaped. Mouse models currently available for genetic research include several hundreds
of unique inbred strains and genetically engineered mutants.
By cross comparing their genomic structures, we can elucidate the cause of any differences in the
phenotype between two strains. The craniometry of subspecies, or closely related species, of mice
provide a good systemic model to study the relationship between genetic variance and cranial shape
evolution. The lack of a quantified framework for comparing and analyzing mouse cranial shape has
been a problem. For this reason, we performed quantitative analysis of cranial shape morphology
between several mouse strains.
Results: This article reports on a craniometric assay of seven mouse strains: four inbred strains
(C57BL/6J, BALB/cA, C3H/HeJ, and CBA/JNCr) from Mus musculus domesticus (M. m. domesticus);
one closed colony strain (ICR) from M. m. domesticus; one inbred strain (MSM/Ms) from Mus
musculus molossinus; and, Mus spretus as a strain from a species other than M. m. domesticus. We
performed linear measurements and geometric morphometrics. Geometric morphometrics
revealed that the cranial characteristics of each strains were clearly distinguishable. We obtained
mean scores for each species using the tpsRelw Program and plotted them.
Conclusion: Geometric morphometrics proved to be useful for identifying and classifying
variations in form, and it revealed that M. spretus has a slender cranium when compared with our
other strains. The mean cranial shape of C3H or CBA was more similar to MSM/Ms, which is
derived from M. m. molossinus, than to either C57BL/6J, BALB, or ICR which are derived from M.
m. domesticus. Future work in this field will aid in elucidating the mechanism of whole cranial shape
regulation.

Background
Over 450 inbred mouse strains have been described and
developed up until now, providing plentiful phenotypes
and genomic backgrounds for genetic studies. Most
inbred laboratory strains are known to have originated
from a limited founder population of Mus musculus mus-

culus and M. m. domesticus housed within a small number
of research facilities and laboratories [1]. Most of these
strains have been bred for over 150 generations; they are
isogenic and homogeneous for over 98.6% of their
genomes [2]. In the past few years, there have been several
articles on the phylogenetic relationships among these

inbred strains based on the available genome data. Wade
et al reported on the fine structure of variation in the
mouse genomes using SNPs [3]. They suggested these
genomes to be mosaics, most being derived from M. m.
domesticus and a minority from other subspecies. Recently,
Sakai et al used the information from more than 1200
microsatellite loci to refine the fine phylogenetic relationships among inbred strains [1].
Here, we studied craniometric relationships among
mouse strains. The mouse cranium has many significant
features. Firstly, like all vertebrate crania, it is a complex
structure comprising and protecting many important
organs: brain; jaws; and, sensory organs, such as the eyes,
the ears, and the nose. It is therefore appropriate and logical that the morphological diversity of the cranium
should reflect phylogenetic and functional aspects of the
adaptive evolution of each species after speciation. Secondly, the morphology of hard tissues, such as cranial
bones, is easily measured and compared. Thirdly, the cranium is constructed from multiple bony components: the
developmental process of the formation of the bones, and
the sutures between them, has already been described in
detail [4-6]. Fourthly, it is already known that mutations
at many loci affect craniometric characteristics [7]. Considering the above, it would seem reasonable to assume
that the craniometry of subspecies, or of closely related
species, of mice provides a good systemic model for studying the relationship between cranial evolution and
genetic variance.

species, correspond or not. To solve this question, the first
thing that was necessary to be done was to select an appropriate method to quantify the cranial morphology of each
sample. Next, we had to examine whether utilizing this
method we could identify the quantitative differences
among those species.
Questions concerning the extent and nature of morphological diversity, among closely related species and subspecies, are best addressed within a morphospace [8], and
geometric morphometrics is a powerful tool for providing
a morphospace for studying this diversity. Traditional
multivariate methods are known to have weaknesses
[9,10]. Relative warp analysis, which is a technique within
the family of geometric morphometrics, offers a useful
way to quantify shape variation independently of variation in the three parameters: size; translation; and, orientation. Algorithms for calculating relative warps are given
by Bookstein [10] and Rohlf [11]. In this approach, landmark coordinates for all the specimens are superimposed
using Procrustes methods [12], such that the fit between
all the specimens is as close as possible. A reference specimen is computed and established as the mean of the fitted
landmark coordinates. Relative warp analysis can be performed using the tpsRelw program by F. J. Rohlf [13]. We
used geometric morphometrics in a craniometric assay of
several mouse strains, subspecies and species: it was
revealed that the cranial characteristics of each strain, subspecies or species were clearly distinguishable.

Results
The main purpose of this paper is to find whether the
craniometric relationship and the phylogenic pattern,
which is obtained from genomic data, among our subject

differ from each other in their general appearance. We first
performed a preliminary morphometric study using conventional linear distance measurements. We placed 11
landmarks on the cranium, based upon which we made
eight measurements (Fig. 2). These landmarks were
located on the boundaries between the bones, of different
parts of the cranium, for measuring the dimensions of
these bones. Table 1 shows the results of linear distance
measurements for each sample. The standard deviations
of the measurements indicate that intraspecies variations
in the specimens are sufficiently small.
Morphospace Axes
It is not easy to integrate the results of linear measurements analyses into a comparative morphological study
systematically. We therefore performed morphological
comparisons, with shape variables, using geometric morphometric methods [10]. We photographed all specimens
in dorsal view, using a Keyence Digital Microscope;

thusly, 14 biologically homologous cranial landmarks
were digitized (Fig. 3).
Four relative warp axes (RW1-4) together accounted for
75.1% of the total shape variation in the data. The major
axes of shape variation in the crania of the seven strains
can be seen in the plot (Fig. 4) of all specimens on RW1
and RW2 which accounted for 30.6% and 28.0%, respectively, of all variation in the samples. Significant interspecific clustering was observed in this morphospace. RW1
accounted for 30.6% of the variance and described the
length of the frontal bone and the sphenoidal angle of the
parietal bone (Fig. 4). M. spretus was characterized by relatively short frontal bones and a short sphenoidal angle of
the parietal bone; in contrast, CBA possessed relatively
long frontal bones and a long sphenoidal angle of the
parietal bone. RW2 accounted for 28.0% of the variance
and described the width of the frontal bone (Fig. 4).
C57BL/6J had relatively wide frontal bones in contrast to
the narrow frontal bones of MSM. RW3 accounted for

Correlation Between Relative Warp and Centroid Size
Shape and size are correlated in many cases. So we performed analysis to find the precise correlation between
size and shape. Analyses of cranial size used the standard
measure of geometric scale, which is centroid size (CS),
defined as the square root of the squared distance between
each landmark and the centroid of the landmark configurations summed over all landmarks. Then we performed a
univariate regression analysis between each of the first 4
relative warps and CS (Table 2).

RW2 produced a significant regression on CS (P = 1.48E05, R = 0.576152) (Fig. 7), indicating that the RW2 axis
largely describes shape variation associated with size.
RW4 produced a weak regression on CS (P = 0.005847, R
= 0.388199) (Fig. 8). Regressions of RWs 1 or 3 on CS
were not significant (P > 0.05). In terms of size, MSM/Ms
animals are smaller than are the others, and they have relatively small RW2 values (Fig. 7).
Cluster Analyses
We obtained mean scores for each species using the
tpsRelw Program and plotted them in RW1 and RW2.

Figure Analysis of the Mean Cranial Shape of Each Species
Cluster 9
Cluster Analysis of the Mean Cranial Shape of Each
Species. Cluster analysis based on the distance between
mean cranial shape of each species on the scatter plot for
relative warps 1 and 2.
Based on the mean distance between species, we generated a phylogenic tree using the UPGMA Method (Fig. 9).
This tree reflects morphological similarity between species; however, only a part of this pedigree matches the tree
that was created from the genomic sequence (for example
C3H and CBA), whereas some parts of this pedigree did
not match the genomic sequence tree.

Discussion
The current classical laboratory strains were derived (in
unequal percentages) from three parental subspecies: Mus
musculus domesticus; M. m. musculus; and, M. m. castaneus.
M. m. domesticus is common in Western Europe, Africa,
and the Near East [14]. The range of M. m. musculus spans
from Eastern Europe to Japan, across Russia and northern
China. M. m. castaneus is found from Sri Lanka to SouthEast Asia, including the Indo-Malayan archipelago. None
of these subspecies was completely isolated genetically,
and in the common regions there is evidence of genetic
exchange ranging from limited introgression to complete
blending. Such exchanges have occurred between M. m.
musculus and M. m. domesticus in Europe, and between M.
m. musculus and M. m. castaneus in China and Japan. In
Japan, M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus have hybridized
extensively and have given rise to a unique population
referred to as Mus musculus molossinus [15,16]. M. spretus is
the well-known western Mediterranean short-tailed
mouse, a different species of the genus Mus.
In this study, we performed geometric morphometrics, a
method developed by Fink and Zelditch (1995)[17].
There are three main points with respect to these results to
take note of. Firstly, the cranial morphology of each strain
is clearly distinguishable by geometric morphometrics.
RW1 and RW2 discriminated among C57BL/6J, MSM/Ms,
and M. spretus, although C3H overlapped with CBA and
BALB overlapped with ICR. RW1 and RW3 discriminated
between C3H and CBA, and RW1 and RW4 distinguished

ICR from BALB. Secondly, according to our morphometric data, the mean cranial shapes of C3H and CBA were
morphologically close to each other, at least with respect
to RW1 and RW2 which represent the major axes of shape
variation in the crania of the seven strains we studied.
Strains C3H and CBA are considered genealogically
closely related [18] and a small genetic distance between
them has been demonstrated by SNP analysis [19]. On the
other hand, M. spretus, a different species from the other
six strains, showed a quite different mean cranial shape.
Thirdly, our data also suggests that genetically close
strains do not always possess morphologically similar crania; for example, the mean cranial shape of C3H and CBA
were more similar to MSM/Ms, which is derived from M.
m. molossinus [20], than to either C57BL/6J, BALB, or ICR
which are paradoxically genetically closer strains. There
are several possible explanations for this inconsistency.
The first is that the genomic regions, which specifically
control cranial morphology, are well conserved compared
with the overall low homology of genomes between two
genetically distant but morphologically similar species: in
this case, only small regions are synapomorphic. The second possibility is that some epigenetic factors affect the
morphology. The third possibility is that the resemblance
of cranial morphology is caused by homoplasy: in this
case, functional factors predominate over phylogenetic
factors. The fourth, unknown environmental effects can
also account for the results.
There have been craniometric studies in mice or other animals by several groups. HallgrÃ­msson et al (2004)
reported that A/WySnJ mice had different craniofacial
shapes compared with C57BL/6J mice [21]. Klingenberg
et al (2004) compared the mandibles between the strains
LG/J and SM/J utilizing geometric morphometrics [22]. In
this study, we analyzed seven strains, and our results are
applicable to comparative morphological studies of mice.
Mutations in cis-regulatory sequences have been implicated as being the predominant source of variation in
morphological evolution. Fondon and Garner (2004)
reported that variation in repeats, in coding regions, is
associated with morphology [23]. In the case of cichlid
fish, some loci are significantly associated with jaw shape
[24]. It is possible that some of our results from geometric
morphometrics could be explained by association with
some particular genomic structure. It is also possible that
the epigenetic factors or functional factors could account
for the results. For example, epigenetic interactions were
reported by HallgrÃ­msson et al (2007)[25], and functional
effects were analyzed by Zelditch et al (2004,
2006)[26,27], or Willmore et al (2006)[28]. Recently,
there have been many reports describing the detailed
expression patterns, or the functional studies, of many
genes during cranial development. Many examples of
gene mutations that affect cranial morphology have been

accumulating [7]; however, the developmental process of
the cranium is so complicated that many questions
remain unanswered.

Conclusion
Geometric morphometrics revealed that the cranial characteristics of each species and subspecies were clearly distinguishable. M. spretus, a different species from the other
6 strains, has an extremely slender cranium compared
with the other strains. HallgrÃ­msson et al argued that A/
WySnJ mice exhibit altered facial morphology which
results from a reduction in the growth of the maxillary
process during formation of the face, and that this is relevant to evolutionary changes in facial prognathism in
nonhuman primates and in human evolution [21]. M.
spretus has a long maxillary and is the opposite to A/WySnJ
mice. M. spretus diverged from M. musculus about 3 million years ago and developed into a different mouse species. Our data also suggests that genetically close strains
do not always possess morphologically similar crania; the
mean cranial shape of C3H and CBA were more similar to
MSM/Ms, which is derived from M. m. molossinus [20],
than to either C57BL/6J, BALB, or ICR which are paradoxically genetically closer.

Methods
Specimens
The mice used in this study were all 12 weeks old. C57BL/
6J, BALB/cA, C3H/HeJ, and ICR mice were purchased
from Clea Japan Inc. (Meguro Ward, Tokyo, Japan). CBA/
JNCr mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc. (Kohoku Ward, Yokohama, Japan). MSM/
Ms mice and Mus spretus were obtained from the Riken
BioResource Center (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan). After
euthanasia, the mice were skinned and the crania were
removed and cleaned. All animal experiments were carried out with the approval of the Ethical Committee at the
Center for Animal Resources and Development,
Kumamoto University (D-18-090, A-19-154).
Linear Distance Measurement
We measured distances between 11 landmarks directly
using digital calipers (Fig. 2). Statistical analyses were performed using the ystat 2000 Program.
Morphometrics
Crania were photographed in dorsal view using a Keyence
Digital Microscope and 14 landmarks were digitized (Fig.
3). Relative warp analysis was performed using the
tpsRelw Program.

rics Programs (IMP), produced in Matlab6 [29]. Univariate regression analysis was done in Microsoft Excel.
Cluster Analysis
Cluster analyses (unweighted pair-group average [UPGA])
were performed for interspecies distance between their
mean shapes (acquired with the tpsRelw Program) on a
scatter plot of relative warp (RW) 1 versus RW2, and a
dendrogram was constructed.
