XMRV-like sequences

Abstract
Background: In 2006, a novel gammaretrovirus, XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus), was
discovered in some prostate tumors. A more recent study indicated that this infectious retrovirus can be detected
in 67% of patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), but only very few healthy controls (4%).
However, several groups have published to date that they could not identify XMRV RNA or DNA sequences in
other cohorts of CFS patients, while another group detected murine leukemia virus (MLV)-like sequences in 87% of
such patients, but only 7% of healthy controls. Since there is a high degree of similarity between XMRV and
abundant endogenous MLV proviruses, it is important to distinguish contaminating mouse sequences from true
infections.
Results: DNA from the peripheral blood of 112 CFS patients and 36 healthy controls was tested for XMRV with
two different PCR assays. A TaqMan qPCR assay specific for XMRV pol sequences was able to detect viral DNA from
2 XMRV-infected cells (~ 10-12 pg DNA) in up to 5 μg of human genomic DNA, but yielded negative results in the
test of 600 ng genomic DNA from 100,000 peripheral blood cells of all samples tested. However, positive results
were obtained with some of these samples, using a less specific nested PCR assay for a different XMRV sequence.
DNA sequencing of the PCR products revealed a wide variety of virus-related sequences, some identical to those
found in prostate cancer and CFS patients, others more closely related to known endogenous MLVs. However, all
samples that tested positive for XMRV and/or MLV DNA were also positive for the highly abundant intracisternal
A-type particle (IAP) long terminal repeat and most were positive for murine mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase
sequences. No contamination was observed in any of the negative control samples, containing those with no DNA
template, which were included in each assay.
Conclusions: Mouse cells contain upwards of 100 copies each of endogenous MLV DNA. Even much less than one
cell’s worth of DNA can yield a detectable product using highly sensitive PCR technology. It is, therefore, vital that
contamination by mouse DNA be monitored with adequately sensitive assays in all samples tested.

Background
XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus)
is a novel gammaretrovirus that was identified in 2006
in 10% of prostate cancers [1]. Its functional significance
was implied by the recent observation that it is prevalent mainly in more aggressive tumors [2]. In 2009, it
was reported that 67% of chronic fatigue syndrome

(CFS) patients had this infectious gammaretrovirus,
while only a small fraction of healthy volunteers was
XMRV-positive [3]. These data were received with
enthusiasm because they pointed to a possible infectious
etiology of CFS, a chronic disability that is clinically illdefined. However, several research groups challenged
these conclusions almost immediately [4-11] because
they could not detect the predicted PCR products or
antibodies in cohorts of CFS or prostate cancer patients
(reviewed in [12-15]).

Recently, sequences related to other murine leukemia
viruses (MLVs) were reported in 80% of CFS patients versus only a small percentage of healthy controls [16]. This
finding implicated different retroviruses specifically linked
to this patient population than the originally described
XMRV [3]. The similarity of such sequences to large numbers of endogenous MLVs present in any mouse strain
[17-19] complicates interpretation of detection of such
sequences in clinical studies since possible contamination
of the human samples with mouse DNA [14,20] has to be
rigorously ruled out to validate such results.
Our laboratory has been involved in CFS research
since 2005 and has a substantial library of samples
stored from a cohort of patients and controls. Using a
nested PCR for XMRV, we detected one XMRV-like
and various MLV-like sequences, but also observed a
100% correlation between samples that were positive for
XMRV/MLV sequences and those positive for mouse
DNA, while most samples negative for XMRV/MLV
were also negative for mouse DNA. These results imply
frequent laboratory contamination with minute and
highly variable quantities of mouse DNA.

Results
Study populations

We analyzed a library of 111 stored DNA samples that
had been collected from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CFS patients in 2005 for an unrelated project (see Methods section for description). In
addition, we collected 37 blood samples (one CFS and
36 healthy controls) in 2009-2010.
TaqMan qPCR specific for XMRV did not reveal positive
individuals

The original XMRV results from patients with prostate
cancer and CFS were obtained using a sensitive nested
PCR assay for XMRV [1,3] that also detects endogenous
MLV sequences in murine genomic DNA. These data
were later extended, employing a qPCR assay specific
for a region in the XMRV pol gene not cross-reactive
with any sequence known to be present in mouse DNA
[2, Singh, personal communication]. To test our cohort
for the presence of XMRV sequences, we analyzed
PBMC DNA with this 2 nd qPCR assay, using the primers and probe as described in [2]. Titration of DNA
from an XMRV-positive lymphoblastoid cell line, WPI1282 (kindly provided by the Whittemore Peterson
Institute (WPI)), resulted in detection of XMRV down
to 10-12 pg, equivalent to two cells, in the presence or
absence of 5 μg control DNA isolated from the human
LnCaP cell line (Figure 1). However, no positive
response (C t > 60) was obtained with DNA from 112
CFS patients and 36 healthy controls, when tested at
600 ng to 5 μg per reaction (data not shown). These

data indicated that our samples were either XMRVnegative or had more divergent MLV sequences than
originally described [1,3]. In the latter case, the qPCR
assay used, which is sensitive to small sequence differences, would not have allowed detection.
Nested PCR for XMRV gag yielded a high frequency of
positive samples

To explore the possibility that XMRV sequences in
humans are more divergent than previously reported,
we used the nested PCR assay for XMRV gag sequences
mentioned above, which also detects many endogenous
MLV proviruses, as described [1]. A preliminary titration experiment revealed that MLV-like sequences could
be detected in 2-3 pg of WPI-1282 DNA, equivalent to
<1 cell, when mixed with 200 ng control DNA (see
above) (Figure 2). This assay was used to test DNA in
triplicates of 200 ng each from our CFS and control
cohorts. Surprisingly, a high proportion of DNA samples
from the healthy volunteers (19/36), but only 2/112 of
the CFS patients, yielded PCR products of the correct
size, as tested on an agarose gel. None of the “no template” control samples, included in each assay at least in
triplicate, gave positive results. These data suggested
that XMRV-related viruses may be highly prevalent in
the human population, but no special link of these
viruses to CFS patients was indicated. While all the
blood samples were processed in the Huber laboratory,
it should be noted that the CFS cohort mainly consisted

of banked samples collected and processed in 2005,
whereas the healthy volunteers were recruited more
recently, between November of 2009 and May of 2010,
and, as discussed later, were processed using a slightly
different protocol.
Sequence analysis of the gag PCR products revealed high
polymorphism

To determine the relationship among the various PCR
products, we obtained their DNA sequences. We observed
that most amplicons contained mixtures of sequences,
thus, necessitating limiting dilutions of the original DNA
samples to obtain pure sequences for analysis (Figures 2B
&3, Additional File 1; Table S1). A total of 37 clean
sequences of single PCR products (designated TH for
“Tufts Huber”) were obtained in this way from 21 samples
(19 healthy controls and 2 CFS). Surprisingly, a high
degree of diversity was seen in these viral sequences

Page 3 of 10

(Figure 3 Additional File 1; Table S1), revealing both
XMRV-like and endogenous MLV sequences and implying
15 different virus strains. While 3 healthy controls had
sequences that were identical to the corresponding segment of XMRV strain VP42, a viral isolate that was originally found in prostate cancer [1] and later in CFS patients
[3], the remaining samples were either identical or closely
related to known endogenous MLVs [17-19].
The sequences obtained were also analyzed by constructing neighbor-joining trees (Figure 4). Again, our
data indicate a high degree of polymorphism in the
MLV-like sequences found. In contrast to the published
VP [1] and WPI [3] XMRV sequences, which are tightly
clustered, the gag sequences found in this study were
dispersed, similar to the sequences reported in [16]; i.e.,
the 15 unique XMRV-related partial gag sequences
found among from the 37 single PCR products were distributed over a minimum of 3 clusters, each of which
contains endogenous MLV sequences of a different subtype (XMV, PMV, and MPMV (xenotropic, polytropic,
modified polytropic MLV)).
Tests for mouse DNA contamination revealed correlation
with viral sequences

Endogenous MLVs are present in high copy number in
all inbred and many species of wild mice, making mouse
DNA a possible source of the sequences observed. To
test whether contamination with mouse DNA might
account for the observed results, all human DNA samples were screened using two different assay systems, a
TaqMan qPCR assay for murine mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, cox2 (W. Switzer, personal communication) and a single PCR assay for the highly abundant
intracisternal A-type particle (IAP) long terminal repeat
sequences, developed by us (OC and JMC, in preparation) (see DNA sequences of some IAP amplicons in
Additional File 2; Figure S1). Both assays had similar
sensitivity, detecting the target sequences in 0.6 pg of
mouse DNA, equivalent to 1/10 of a cell in a background of 200 ng LnCap DNA (Figure 5A &5B). Using
these two test systems, we observed that many samples,
both CFS and control, were positive for these types of
sequence, while all “no template” controls were negative.
A direct comparison of the gag PCR results with those
obtained in the two assays for mouse DNA revealed a
100% correlation between samples positive for the former and mouse DNA; all human DNA samples that
were positive in the gag PCR assay were also positive for
IAP sequences, and all but 2 were positive for mouse
cox2 sequences (Table 1). In addition, nearly half (62/
127) of the samples were positive for mouse DNA by
either IAP or both assays, but did not yield a detectable
MLV signal. These findings are in agreement with our
observation that the two PCR assays for mouse DNA

are at least 10-fold more sensitive than the XMRV gag
PCR assay, when tested on genomic mouse DNA, and
that the IAP assay is more sensitive than the cox2 assay
for detection of mouse DNA. Overall, our data are consistent with the conclusion that the positive results
obtained with the XMRV gag PCR assay are due to variable contamination of the human samples with mouse
DNA, most likely in laboratory reagents.

Discussion
In 2005, we initiated a study to examine the expression
level of an endogenous human betaretrovirus, HERV-

K18, in chronically ill CFS patients versus healthy controls. For this purpose, we accumulated a library of
DNA samples from CFS patients which has allowed us
to investigate the possible association of XMRV with
this disease [3]. We initiated our studies on XMRV
using a TaqMan qPCR assay for a region in XMRV pol
that is unique to XMRV and does not detect any
sequences in genomic DNA from laboratory strains of
inbred mice [2]. None of the samples from either CFS
patients or healthy controls was positive in this assay,
although we were able to detect a signal from two
XMRV-infected lymphoblastoid cells (cell line WPI-

detected from the PBMC DNA of 17 healthy controls and 2 CFS
patients, along with various endogenous and exogenous MLV
sequences. Identical sequences were collapsed into individual
clusters, where a representative member is shown followed by
“+(N)”, where N is the total number of sequences in that cluster.
Distances were calculated based on the absolute number of base
substitutions; all sites containing gaps were ignored. Note the

1282) in a background of DNA from up to 106 human
LnCaP cells. In our hands, the qPCR assay is 10-fold
less sensitive than the nested XMRV gag PCR assay
when tested on the same XMRV-positive cell line, since
the latter can detect a signal in DNA from <1 cell. This
difference is a consideration for the negative results we
obtained as the sensitivity of the qPCR assay may not
have been adequate for the detection of minute amounts
of XMRV. We are not aware of any other group who
has used this technique for the detection of XMRV in
the DNA of freshly isolated PBMC. However, Danielson
et al. recently reported that they could only detect
XMRV sequences, using XMRV env, but not gag, primers [21].
In contrast to the qPCR results, we were able to readily detect XMRV using the nested PCR originally
described by Urisman et al. [1], and we found many
more positive samples in our healthy control cohort,
compared to the CFS cohort. Of possible relevance for
the interpretation of these findings may be the fact that
the samples from the two cohorts were prepared years
apart, although all in the same laboratory using somewhat different protocols and reagents. It is also important to point out that individual DNA samples remained
reproducibly positive or negative on repeat examination
rendering the possibility of random contamination of
the PCR assays very unlikely. Furthermore, each assay
contained positive and negative controls which were
100% correlative; i.e., the DNA from the XMRV-infected
cell line was always positive and the no-template control
or LnCaP DNA was always negative. Thus, it is unlikely
that contamination occurred at the time of setting up
the PCR reactions.
To further understand the origin of the positive PCR
signals, we determined the DNA sequences of the gag
PCR products. In most cases, it was only possible to
obtain unique sequences from PCR products after dilution of the input DNA to an extent where single molecules were amplified, since initial studies showed that
most of the positive samples contained mixtures of closely related sequences. In this way, we obtained 15 different sequences from a total of 37 single PCR products.
When compared to the collection of endogenous MLV
sequences extracted from the sequenced mouse genome
[18,22], these sequences included examples from all
parts (XMV, PMV, and MPMV) of the resulting neighbor-joining tree, as well as a cluster of three sequences
identical (in this region) to the VP42 isolate of XMRV.
With regard to the latter result, it is of significance that
no VP42 plasmid, nor VP42-containing cell line, nor
isolated DNA, was present in the Huber laboratory that
could have resulted in contamination (WPI-1282 contains VP62 which differs by one base change in the
region analyzed). The genomic DNA from the three

healthy volunteers who had XMRV VP42 sequences also
contained other MLV sequences. Thus, it is not possible
for us to distinguish which one of the retroviruses
stemmed from mouse DNA contamination; i.e., it is formally possible that VP42 is an actual human retrovirus.
It is also possible that it is an endogenous provirus, not
present in the sequenced C57Bl/6 genome, but present
in the mouse species responsible for the sequences
observed [19]. In the former case, the presence of VP42
in DNA from healthy control samples, but not CFS
patients, would indicate that this virus is spread randomly through the human population, with no particular link to CFS. Further analyses are required to clarify
this issue.
The presence of mixtures of MLV sequences, all closely related to known endogenous MLVs [17-19], in
many of the DNA samples tested is not easily reconciled
with infection of human hosts with the corresponding
viruses (reviewed in [14,20]). Two assays specific for
murine DNA, for mitochondrial cox2 and IAP
sequences, were used to test the possibility that there
might be trace amounts of mouse DNA contaminating
some of the samples. Consistent with this idea, we
found that each DNA sample that was positive for
XMRV/MLV also was positive for mouse DNA by the
IAP assay, while >50% of XMRV/MLV-negative samples
were positive for mouse DNA which is particularly striking in the CFS group. Again, these results were confirmed in repeat experiments and never deviated in
subsequent analyses, suggesting that contamination happened either during collection of blood, isolation of
PBMC, or during the preparation of the DNA from the
PBMC. We interpret these data that possible contamination with mouse DNA is ubiquitous, but the level
seemed to vary significantly from batch to batch of sample preps, although all experimental procedures were
carried out in the same facility. In particular, although
samples collected at both times showed signs of contamination, the level of contamination in the normal

controls collected in 2009-2010 was noticeably greater
than in the CFS samples from 2005. To date, we have
not been able to pinpoint a specific reagent or laboratory vessel for being consistently positive for mouse
DNA, but preliminary experiments implicate both fetal
calf serum (FCS) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
although large variations in the surmised amount of
contaminating mouse DNA were observed from bottle
to bottle. All blood samples were collected in heparin
tubes rendering the anti-coagulant also a likely suspect
for mouse DNA contamination. However, a comparison
of parallel blood collections from the same healthy individual in heparin, Na-citrate and EDTA tubes did not
support this hypothesis. In this particular set of samples
only one DNA aliquot from Na-citrate-collected blood
was positive for mouse DNA (results not shown).
Currently there are highly discordant reports in the literature about the prevalence of XMRV in CFS and prostate cancer patients (reviewed in [12-15]). The original
publication on CFS patients reported that almost 70% of
these patients, but less than 5% of healthy individuals,
harbor this virus [3], and that infectious virus and antiviral antibodies could be detected in blood from these
patients. Several reports have appeared in the literature
since then contesting these findings [4-6,8,9], while a
recent publication claimed that 80% of CFS patients, but
not healthy controls, contained endogenous MLV-like
sequences, but were negative for mouse mitochondrial
DNA [16]. The sequences from CFS patients identified in
this latter paper were distinct from the XMRV of the original reports. A plausible explanation for these discrepant
results has not been put forward to date [13,14], but it is
worth pointing out that the sequences identified in the
latter report were similar to the ones we found in the
present study. Endogenous MLVs are abundant in all
laboratory mouse strains [17,18], as well as in wild Mus
species [19] and are carried by some human cell lines
that have been propagated in vivo in nude mice [20].
Thus, extreme precautions have to be taken to exclude

Oakes et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:109
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/109

contamination with mouse DNA or DNA from any abundant MLV-producing cell line.

Conclusions
In our study we have observed that 100% of human DNA
samples prepared in our laboratory that were positive for
XMRV/MLV sequences were also positive for minute
quantities of mouse DNA. Together with the similarity of
the MLV sequences to multiple identified endogenous
MLVs [17-19], this result provides a strong suspicion that
the viral sequences detected in these samples were actually
of murine origin. It is important to point out that negative
controls included in each assay never yielded positive
results, either for XMRV/MLV, or for mouse DNA,
excluding the possibility that contamination with mouse
DNA occurred at the bench during the final PCR assay,
even though mouse derived cells and tissues are regularly
used in our laboratory. Of particular interest is the wide
variety of sequences that we obtained, spanning both
XMRV and various MLV sequences. While most of the
MLV-related sequences were identical to gag segments in
nonecotropic MLVs from inbred mice [17,18], some were
found to be unique; i.e., they have so far not been identified in the sequenced mouse genome [22], but may be present in other laboratory strains or wild mice. Thus, our
data are compatible with the conclusion that the detection
of MLV-related sequences in human genomic DNA samples could be due to contamination with minute and variable quantities of mouse DNA, most likely contained in
various laboratory reagents.
Methods
Sample collection

All samples were collected according to the institutional
guidelines of Tufts University, after receiving informed
consent. The 36 healthy individuals (15 females and 21
males) were recruited on a voluntary basis by the Huber
laboratory and were between 18 and 65 years of age. The
112 CFS patients (89 females, 20 males and 3 unknown),
recruited by Dr. Susan Levine, were between 18 and 65
years of age and resided in the Northeastern United
States. All patients were diagnosed for CFS according to
CDC criteria [23], and the majority was completely disabled. The cohort comprised a combination of those with
an abrupt and others with a gradual onset of symptoms.
Preparation of human blood samples

Approximately 30 ml of blood were drawn into three
heparinized tubes (Becton Dickinson) and shipped overnight (CFS patients) or processed immediately (healthy
controls). The blood collection tubes from each individual
were consolidated into one 50 ml tube and diluted with
PBS, containing CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Sigma) at a 1:1 ratio.
15 ml of Ficoll (GE Healthcare) was added to two new 50

Page 8 of 10

ml tubes, and 25 ml of the diluted blood was gently layered
on top of the Ficoll, followed by a 30 min centrifugation in
a Sorvall RT7plus rotor at 2000 rpm at room temperature
and collection of PBMCs from the interface. 10 ml of
plasma were also collected from each sample and stored at
-80°C. The collected PBMCs were diluted with PBS (2005
collection) or RPMI-1640 Medium (Sigma), supplemented
with 10% FCS (Gemini BioProducts), 100 U/ml penicillin
(Sigma), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma) (2010
collection) (2009-2010 collection) (complete RPMI) at a
1:1 ratio and then pelleted at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The
supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet of PBMCs was
resuspended in 20 ml of PBS (2005 collection) or complete
RPMI (2009-2010 collection). Cells were counted using a
light microscope and a hemocytometer, aliquoted to 5 ×
106 cells per tube, spun down and resuspended in 350 μl
of Buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen) (1% b-mercaptoethanol).
Samples were stored in this lysis buffer at -80°C.
DNA isolation from PBMCs

DNA was isolated using the procedures provided by the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Briefly, 350 μl of PBMC
lysate (RLT buffer, see above) (5 × 106 cells) were placed on
the DNA spin column, which was centrifuged at 10,000
rpm for 30 s in an Eppendorf 5417C Centrifuge. The column was then transferred to a new collection tube. 500 μl
AW1 Buffer (Qiagen) was added to the column, followed by
a 15 s spin at 10,000 rpm. The flow-through was discarded,
and the column was transferred to a new collection tube.
500 μl of AW2 Buffer (Qiagen) was added to the column,
followed by a 2 minute centrifugation at full speed. The
flow-through was discarded, and the column was transferred
to a new 1.5 ml collection tube. 100 μl of Buffer EB (Qiagen)
was added directly to the column, followed by 1 minute
incubation at room temperature. Finally, the column was
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 min to elute DNA. DNA
concentration was determined using 1 μl of sample on a
Thermo Scientific Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer.
TaqMan qPCR assay for XMRV pol

Primers and probe, as designed by Schlaberg et al. [2],
were ordered from Applied Biosystems (see Table 2 for
sequences). The reaction mix for the TaqMan qPCRs
contained 1× Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems), 900 nM forward and reverse primers, 250
nM probe, and 200 ng of DNA in a reaction volume of
20 μl. The assay was validated with DNA from the
WPI-1282 cell line containing VP62 XMRV (kindly supplied by J. Mikovits, WPI). The same DNA served as
positive control in each assay, which also included a notemplate negative control. Thermocycler conditions
were 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 60 cycles of 95°C
for 15 s and then 60°C for 1 minute, using 96-well

PCR assay for Mouse IAP sequences

Nested PCR assay for XMRV gag

Identical primers as originally described by Urisman et al.
[1] and also employed by the Mikovits group [3] were
used. The reaction mix for all PCRs consisted of 1× HotStart-IT™FideliTaq™Master Mix, 200 nM forward and
reverse primers, and 200 ng of sample DNA in a 50 μl
reaction volume. The WPI-1282 lymphoblastoid cell line
was used as a positive control [3]. Thermocycler conditions for the first PCR were 2 minutes at 94°C, followed by
30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s
and then finished off with 72°C for 7 minutes. Once the
first PCR was complete, 2 μl of DNA from the first PCR
was used for the second PCR. The second PCR consisted
of 1× HotStart-IT™FideliTaq™Master Mix, 200 nM forward
and reverse primers, and 200 ng of sample DNA in a 50 μl
reaction volume. Thermocycler conditions for the second
PCR were 2 minutes at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C
for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s and then finished
off with 72°C for 7 minutes. Once the second PCR was
complete, 15 μl of the samples were run on a 1.5% agarose
gel for 1 h at 100 volts. Images of gels were taken using a
VersaDoc Imaging System (Biorad). The expected fragment size of the second PCR is 413 bp [1].
All positive samples from the second XMRV nested PCR
were isolated using a Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). DNA sequencing was performed by the Tufts University Core Facility. Once sequenced, the traces were
