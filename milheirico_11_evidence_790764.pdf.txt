Evidence for a purifying selection acting on the
b-lactamase locus in epidemic clones of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus

Abstract
Background: The b-lactamase (bla) locus, which confers resistance to penicillins only, may control the transcription of
mecA, the central element of methicillin resistance, which is embedded in a polymorphic heterelogous chromosomal
cassette (the SCCmec element). In order to assess the eventual correlation between bla allotypes and genetic lineages,
SCCmec types and/or b-lactam resistance phenotypes, the allelic variation on the bla locus was evaluated in a
representative collection of 54 international epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical strains
and, for comparative purposes, also in 24 diverse methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains.
Results: Internal fragments of blaZ (the b-lactamase structural gene) were sequenced for all strains. A subset of
strains, representative of blaZ allotypes, was further characterized by sequencing of internal fragments of the blaZ
transcriptional regulators, blaI and blaR1. Thirteen allotypes for blaZ, nine for blaI and 12 for blaR1 were found. In a
total of 121 unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) detected, no frameshift mutations were identified and
only one nonsense mutation within blaZ was found in a MRSA strain. On average, blaZ alleles were more
polymorphic among MSSA than in MRSA (14.7 vs 11.4 SNP/allele). Overall, blaR1 was the most polymorphic gene
with an average of 24.8 SNP/allele. No correlation could be established between bla allotypes and genetic lineages,
SCCmec types and/or b-lactam resistance phenotypes. In order to estimate the selection pressure acting on the bla
locus, the average dN/dS values were computed. In the three genes and in both collections dN/dS ratios were
significantly below 1.
Conclusions: The data strongly suggests the existence of a purifying selection to maintain the bla locus fully
functional even on MRSA strains. Although, this is in agreement with the notion that in most clinical MRSA strains
mecA gene is under the control of the bla regulatory genes, these findings also suggest that the apparently
redundant function of blaZ gene for the MRSA resistant phenotype is still important for these strains. In addition,
the data shows that the sensor-inducer blaR1 is the primary target for the accumulation of mutations in the bla
locus, presumably to modulate the response to the presence of b-lactam antibiotic.

Background
Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of nosocomial
infections and has recently emerged as a community
acquired pathogen [1-3]. S. aureus is also a paradigm of
adaptive power to antimicrobial chemotherapy, able to
develop resistance to virtually all classes of antibiotics

[4].The acquisition of resistance to b-lactam antibiotics
is particularly relevant in clinical terms. Although b-lactams (i.e. penicillin G) were the first class of large-spectrum antibiotics to be introduced into clinical practice,
they are still the most widely used due to their high
effectiveness, low cost, ease of delivery and minimal side
effects [5].
In response to b-lactam chemotherapy, S. aureus has
sequentially acquired two resistance genes: first blaZ,
which codes for a b-lactamase and confers resistance to

penicillins only, and then mecA, which codes for an extra
penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) with reduced affinity
for virtually all b-lactams [6,7]. The transcription of both
resistance genes may be controlled by homologous twocomponent systems consisting on a sensor-inducer
(BlaR1 and MecR1) and a repressor (BlaI and MecI).
Interestingly, in spite of the cross-resistance to virtually
all b-lactams provided by mecA, the great majority (>
95%) of contemporary MRSA are still positive for the blactamase locus [8]. Moreover, the regulators of blaZ,
BlaR1 and BlaI, can efficiently induce mecA transcription
and, do it faster than the “natural” mecA regulators,
MecR1 and MecI [9,10]. In addition, since many MRSA
strains do not have functional mecI-mecR1 genes due to
polymorphisms in the mecA regulatory region [11], the
mecA transcription is presumably under the control of
the blaI-blaR1 genes only. In line with these observations, the presence of the blaZ locus has been shown to
promote mecA acquisition and stabilization [12,13].
In S. aureus, the b-lactamase genes may be located in
a plasmid or mobilized into the chromosome by transposon Tn552 [14]. In contrast to the diversity of b-lactamase genes found in gram-negative bacteria, all
staphylococcal enzymes studied so far are molecular
class A serine b-lactamases placed in functional group
2a [8]. The mature form of the enzyme has a molecular
mass of 30 kDa, contains 257 amino acids, and is
secreted extracellularly [15]. In 1965, Richmond proposed the subdivision of staphylococcal b-lactamases in
four serotypes [16], but the structural basis of the distinction between types is still uncertain and no clear
relationship between sequence and serotype was found
[17]. Interestingly, serotypes were shown to have specific
geographic distributions [8], which may suggest a relationship between bla-type and genetic lineage. Recently,
Olsen et al have studied the allelic variation of the blaZ
gene among several staphylococcal species and 11 BlaZ
protein types were identified [14]. The multiplesequence alignment of those sequence types suggest a
separate evolution for plasmid- and chromosomallyencoded blaZ and a very low frequency for exchange of
the b-lactamase locus between strains and species.
In evolutionary terms, MRSA may be regarded as a
recent sub-branch of the S. aureus population which has
acquired the heterelogous chromosomal cassette containing the mecA gene - the SCCmec element [18].
Molecular epidemiology studies on large collections of
MRSA isolates have clearly shown that MRSA has a
strong clonal structure and that very few lineages,
defined by specific macro-restriction patterns of chromosomal DNA and/or multi-locus sequence types,
account for the great proportion of MRSA infections
worldwide [19,20]. The clonal structure of MRSA population may result from a “host barrier” for the mecA

acquisition, which restricts the number of acquisitions
to few more permissive lineages [13,21] and/or from the
clonal expansion of previously highly epidemic (MSSA)
lineages, which have acquired the mecA gene. Recent
data based on comparative genomics of MRSA lineages
[22-24] supports both mechanisms as it seems that,
within the same genetic (epidemic) lineage, SCCmec
acquisitions may occur continuously at the local level.
In spite of the several lines of evidence suggesting an
important role of the bla locus in the acquisition, stabilization and regulation of the mecA gene, the variability of
bla genes at the sequence level has never been evaluated
among pandemic MRSA lineages. The present study was
conducted in order to evaluate the allelic variability of blactamase locus in a representative collection of internationally epidemic MRSA clones and also, for comparative
purposes, in a diverse collection of methicillin-susceptible
S. aureus strains (MSSA), in an attempt to make evolutionary correlations between b-lactamase allotypes and
b-lactam resistance phenotypes (i.e. MRSA vs MSSA),
SCCmec types and/or genetic lineages.

Methods
Strain collection

S. aureus strains used in the present study are listed in
Tables 1 (MRSA) and 2 (MSSA). All strains have been
previously assigned to genetic lineages by Pulse-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing
(MLST) and protein A sequence typing (spa typing).
MRSA strains have been additionally characterized in
terms of their SCCmec types. The presence of a functional b-lactamase locus was confirmed by nitrocefin
disks (Sigma) for all strains, in the presence and absence
of an inducer (oxacillin at 0.05 mg/L).
Media and growth conditions

Strains were grown overnight at 37°C on tryptic soy agar
or tryptic soy broth under aerobic conditions.
DNA isolation

Total DNA was prepared using the Wizard genomic
DNA preparation kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations,
except for the addition of lysostaphin at 0.5 mg/mL and
RNase at 0.3 mg/mL for the lysis step.
DNA amplification and sequencing

The allelic variation on the b-lactamase locus was evaluated by sequencing internal fragments of blaZ and its
transcriptional regulators, blaI and blaR1, amplified by
PCR. Based on the available sequence at GenBank
(accession number: X52734) for Tn552 of S. aureus,
three pairs of primers were designed as follows (5’ ®
3’): blaZ F1, GAT AAG AGA TTT GCC TAT GC; blaZ

DNA sequences analysis and phylogenetic tree
reconstruction

DNA sequencing raw data analysis and multi-sequence
alignments were performed using the DNA Star software package (Lasergene). For the multi-sequence alignments, the Clustal W algorithm was used. In order to
maximize sequence reads, raw sequences for blaZ and
blaR1 were trimmed immediately after the primer
sequences keeping the reading frame. As the reverse primer for blaI (BlaI R1) is located outside of the coding
region, the 3’ end of the sequence was trimmed at the
end of the coding region. For each gene, allotypes were
defined taking as reference the extant sequences of the
bla locus of Tn552, which were assigned to allotype 1.
Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were
conducted using MEGA version 4 [25] and the resultant
phylogenetic trees were obtained using the neighbourjoining (NJ) method with bootstrap analysis using 1000
replicates. In order to evaluate the diversity of the bla
locus, the Simpson’s indexes of diversity (SID) were calculated [26,27] for each locus using the online tool
available at http://www.comparingpartitions.info. To
estimate selection pressure acting on the bla locus, we
computed the dN/dS ratios for the three genes. The
dN/dS ratios were computed for all pairs of alleles with
more than 1% substitutions, in order to give an estimate
of the divergence of the alleles while excluding those
pairs that, being too similar, would give anomalous dN/
dS ratios. The dN/dS ratios were computed by Model
Averaging, as described in [28] and implemented in the
KaKs_Calculator application [29]. This approach fits a
set of models by maximum likelihood and then computes the weighted average of the models using a second-order Akaike Information Criterion (AICC).
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

All nucleotide sequences determined in this study were
deposited in Genbank under accession numbers
GQ980053-GQ980139 (blaZ alleles), GQ980140GQ980187 (blaI alleles) and GQ980188-GQ980236
(blaR1 alleles).

Results
The allelic variation in the b-lactamase locus (bla) was
evaluated by sequencing internal fragments of blaZ, blaI
and blaR1 genes in a representative collection of international epidemic MRSA clones and also, for comparative purposes, in a diverse collection of MSSA strains.

found four alleles present in MRSA strains only and two
present in MSSA strains only. Moreover, the relative frequencies of each allele were different among MRSA and
MSSA strains (Table 3); for instance, blaZ allotype 1
was dominant in MRSA strains accounting for 43% (23
out of 54) of the isolates whereas in MSSA it accounted
for 21% (5 out of 24) of the isolates, and blaZ allotype 6
was present in 11% (6 out 54) of MRSA but was dominant among MSSA accounting for 46% (11 out 24) of
the isolates. The diversity of blaZ gene as measured by
the Simpson index of diversity (SID) was higher for the
MRSA collection than for MSSA, although not statistically significant due to the partial overlapping of the
confidence intervals (SID = 79.18, 95%CI 69.6-88.8 vs
SID = 76.09, 95%CI 61.3-90.9, respectively) - see Table
4. Within the length of blaZ region analyzed (492
nucleotides), we detected 43 unique single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) and on average, each blaZ allele
has 12.4 SNP comparing to the prototype blaZ sequence
of Tn552 (allele 1) - see Tables 3 and 4. Overall, blaZ
alleles were more variable in MSSA than in MRSA (14.7
and 11.4 SNP/allele, respectively). As illustrated by the
allelic frequency distribution per MRSA lineage (Figure
1) or the cluster tree of the thirteen blaZ alleles found
in our collections (Figure 2), there is no clustering
according to genetic lineages, as defined by MLST
sequence type and SCCmec type, or MSSA/MRSA phenotype; i.e. the same allele could be detected in different
genetic lineages or among MRSA and MSSA, and the
same lineage could be characterized by several alleles. In
addition, there was also no clear clustering of blaZ allotypes according to geographic origin or isolation date of
the MRSA isolates (see Table 1).
The BlaZ variability in the MRSA and MSSA strains at
the protein level was evaluated by comparison of the
deduced amino acid sequence of all alleles against the
deduced amino acid sequence for the BlaZ of Tn552.
Overall, the deduced amino acid sequences of blaZ
alleles from the MRSA and MSSA strains revealed on
average 5.8 silent mutations, 1.8 conservative missense
mutations and 4 non-conservative missense mutations
per allotype (see Tables 3 and 4). For MRSA strain
HAR40, a nonsense mutation at Gln76 was detected
which presumably originates a non-functional truncated
BlaZ protein. As this strain was positive for the nitrocefin test, the DNA extraction and the blaZ sequencing
were repeated and the nonsense mutation was confirmed. No frameshift mutations were found in blaZ
allotypes.

blaZ allelic variability

Thirteen different blaZ allotypes were identified within
our collection, which comprised 54 MRSA and 24
MSSA (Tables 1 and 2, respectively). Although seven
alleles were common to MRSA and MSSA strains, we

of these strains failed in the amplification of one of the
blaZ regulatory genes (see Tables 1 and 2).
Within the length of blaI region analyzed (351 nucleotides), we detected 13 unique SNP, which account for
the nine blaI allotypes detected (see Tables 3 and 4).
Four of the nine blaI allotypes were present in both
MRSA and MSSA, while three blaI allotypes were found
in MRSA strains only and two in MSSA only. The SID
was higher for MRSA than for MSSA although not statistically significant (SID = 82.1, 95%CI 74.6-89.5 vs SID
= 74.2, 95%CI 60.5-87.9, respectively) (Table 4). On
average, each blaI allele has 3.4 SNP comparing to the

prototype blaI sequence of Tn552 (allele 1), and blaI
alleles were on average more polymorphic for MRSA
than for MSSA (3.9 vs 2.5 SNP per allele, respectively) see Tables 3 and 4.
Within the length of blaR1 region analyzed (498
nucleotides), we detected 65 unique SNP, which account
for the 12 blaR1 allotypes detected (see Tables 3 and 4).
Six of the 12 blaR1 allotypes were present in both
MRSA and MSSA, while four blaR1 allotypes were
unique for MRSA strains and two were characteristic of
MSSA strains. The SID values were virtually identical
for both MRSA and MSSA (SID = 88.8, 95%CI 83.2-

4). On average, each blaR1 allele has 24.8 SNP comparing to the prototype blaR1 sequence of Tn552 (allele 1),
with no significant differences between MRSA and
MSSA (24.4 and 24.6 SNP/allele, respectively) - see
Tables 3 and 4.
In agreement with what was observed for the blaZ
gene, the cluster trees of blaI and blaR1 alleles found in
our collections also showed no clustering according to
MSSA/MRSA phenotype or genetic lineages (Figures 3
and 4). For those strains in which the alleles of the three
genes were determined, we constructed a cluster tree
with the concatenated sequences - see Figure 5. In spite

of the relatively low number of allelic profiles, there was
still no clear clustering of bla allotypes according to
MSSA/MRSA phenotype or lineage, as the same allelic
profile was present in different genetic lineages (e.g. profile 8/4/9 present in clonal complexes 5, 8 and 45) and,
the same genetic lineage was characterized by profiles
from different brunches (e.g. clonal cluster 8 characterized by profiles 8/4/9, 1/1/1, 3/3/6, etc.).
The BlaI and BlaR1 variabilities at the protein level
in the MRSA and MSSA strains were evaluated by
comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of
all alleles against the corresponding deduced amino
acid sequences of Tn552 (see Tables 3 and 4).

Overall, the deduced amino acid sequences of the
blaI alleles revealed on average 2.3 silent mutations,
0.1 conservative missense mutations and 1 non-conservative missense mutation per allotype. The
deduced amino acid sequences of the blaR1 alleles
showed on average 10.2 silent mutations, 5.3 conservative missense mutations and 8.1 non-conservative
missense mutations per allotype. None of the SNP
detected within the blaI or blaR1 resulted in nonsense or frameshift mutations.
Selection pressure acting on the bla locus

Based on the allelic data obtained, we computed the dN/
dS ratios as estimates for the selective pressure acting
on the bla locus. The dN/dS ratios were computed for
all pairs of alleles differing more than 1%, in order to
give an estimate of the allelic divergence, excluding the
anomalous dN/dS ratios of those pairs being very similar. The average of the obtained dN/dS values and
respective standard deviations are summarized in Table
4. The dN/dS values for the three genes in the MRSA,
MSSA and MRSA/MSSA partitions were well below 1
(between 0.08 and 0.25 with standard deviations
between 0.05 and 0.1), which suggests a negative or purifying selection acting on the bla locus. In agreement
with the average number of SNP per allele, the dN/dS
ratios were significantly higher for the blaR1 gene (0.24
- 0.25) and lower for mecI (0.08 - 0.11).

Discussion
The rationale for this study comes from several observations strongly suggesting a role of bla genes in the
acquisition, stabilization and regulation of mecA gene,
the central element of “broad-spectrum” b-lactam resistance characteristic of MRSA strains. The purpose of
this study was to evaluate the allelic variability of the
bla locus in a representative collection of international
epidemic MRSA clones and also, for comparative purposes, in a diverse collection of MSSA strains, in an
attempt to establish evolutionary correlations between
bla allotypes and b-lactam resistance phenotypes (i.e.
between MRSA and MSSA), SCCmec types (i.e. polymorphisms in the mecA regulatory locus) and/or genetic
lineages.
MRSA lineages are much less diverse than MSSA
lineages in terms of their genome content, a consequence of their more recent evolutionary history [19,20]
and, apparently, also due to some “host barrier” to the
SCCmec acquisition [13]. These differences in genetic
background variability were well illustrated in our collections since the international MRSA collection comprised eight lineages as defined by MLST clonal
complexes, whereas in the smaller and local MSSA collection 15 lineages were represented.
In contrast to the genetic background diversity, we
could not detect significant differences between MSSA
and MRSA in terms of the bla locus allelic variability.
Actually, there were disparate subtle differences in
terms of number of allotypes and number of point
mutations per allotype: e.g. 11 vs 9 blaZ allotypes and
11.4 vs 14.7 SNP/allele in MRSA and MSSA, respectively. These subtle differences may reflect the more

Milheiriço et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:76
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/76

ancient evolutionary history of MSSA or a selective
pressure to improve the bla locus activity in these
strains. That is to say, although fewer bla types have
been retained by the natural selection in MSSA, on
average, these allotypes seem to have accumulated more
adaptive mutations, in comparison to MRSA strains. In
particular for blaZ, for which differences in terms of
number of alleles and SNP/allele were more significant,
the presence of the alternative b-lactam resistance
mechanism mediated by the mecA gene in MRSA
strains might have allowed a release in the selective
pressure to keep blaZ with optimal activity, in contrast
to MSSA, which rely only on blaZ-mediated resistance
to b-lactams.
No correlation could be established between bla allotypes and strain backgrounds, b-lactam resistance phenotypes, strain origin and/or isolation dates, indicating
that bla genes have evolved independently from S. aureus clonal lineages. This is particularly striking for
MRSA strains, which have a very strong clonal structure. These observations may be explained either by differences in evolutionary clock speeds between the
genetic background and the bla locus or may result
from the horizontal transfer of bla genes between different lineages, which are usually integrated in mobile elements (plasmids and composite transposons).
Interestingly, based on the characterization of a collection of several staphylococcal species, Olsen et al, suggested that there is little exchange of bla genes between
strains or species [14], which somehow contradicts our
findings. In our study, the most parsimony explanation
for the presence of the same bla type in different
genetic lineages either MRSA or MSSA or the presence
of several bla types in the same lineage, is indeed a high
frequency for the horizontal transfer of bla genes across
S. aureus clonal clusters.
In spite of the lack of evolutionary links between bla
allotypes and genetic lineages, our data strongly suggests
a selective pressure to keep the bla locus fully functional, as illustrated by the calculated average dN/dS
values well below 1. This observation is valid even on
MRSA for which one could expect the accumulation of
nonsense or frameshift mutations that would render the
bla locus non-functional, due to presence of the mecA
gene. Actually, the majority of the mutational events
detected in this study were either silent or neutral mutations, being the blaR1 the gene with the highest mutational rate and the blaI the one with the lowest. The
increased allelic variability detected for blaR1 (in terms
of number of alleles, Simpson’s index of diversity, average SNP/allele, and dN/dS values) may suggest that this
sensor-inducer gene is the primary target for the evolutionary adaptive mechanisms in the bla locus, presumably to improve the induction efficiency of blaZ

Page 9 of 11

expression or even mecA expression, in the case of
MRSA strains with no functional mecI-mecR1 regulatory
system. In contrast, the relatively lower variability of the
much smaller blaI gene, may suggest a fine-tuned
repressor activity and a selective pressure to maintain
the repressor activity; i.e to maintain the blaZ expression inducible.
Despite the cross-resistance to virtually all b-lactam
antibiotics provided by mecA, most contemporary
MRSA strains still carry, besides the SCCmec element,
the b-lactamase locus. This might be due to the fact
that not enough time has elapsed since the mecA acquisition for MRSA strains start loosing the bla genes,
because there is a little or no fitness cost associated to
the bla genes, or because these genes may be linked to
other positively selected genes (e.g. the cadmium resistance genes present in some b-lactamase plasmids).
Alternatively, the bla locus may be involved in the
“domestication” of the mecA gene, as bla genes have
been shown to stabilize the in vitro mecA acquisition
[12,13] and efficiently control mecA transcription [9,10],
explaining the “retention” of a functional bla regulatory
system by most contemporary MRSA strains [8]. Interestingly, as no correlation could be established between
bla allotypes and SCCmec types, which have polymorphisms in the mecA regulatory locus, this maintenance of
functional blaI-blaR1 genes seems to be independent of
the functional status of the mecA “natural” regulators
mecI-mecR1.
Concerning the maintenance of a functional blaZ gene
in MRSA strains one can speculate that, even in the presence of mecA, it might be useful for the bacteria to
keep blaZ as a “first-line defense” against b-lactams. In
fact, first generation b-lactams (i.e. penicillins) are still
widely prescribed either empirically or for the treatment
of specific infections (e.g. streptococcal infections).
Moreover, penicillins have also been widely used prophylactically in the livestock industry. This means that,
both in the nosocomial and community settings, MRSA
are still exposed to penicillins and, under these circumstances, expression of b-lactamase is enough for survival
under antibiotic pressure. From a physiological perspective, this ability to choose between the expression of two
resistance genes may be advantageous for the bacteria
since the expression of b-lactamase is likely to impose a
smaller fitness cost than the expression of PBP2a. In
fact, besides being much smaller than PBP2a (257 vs
668 amino acids), BlaZ is a secreted enzyme whereas
PBP2a is a transpeptidase protein, which must be incorporated into the complex cell-wall metabolism.

Conclusion
In this study we have evaluated the allelic variation of the
bla locus in MRSA and MSSA clinical strains. Although

Milheiriço et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:76
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/76

no correlation between bla allotypes and genetic lineages,
SCCmec types and b-lactam resistance phenotypes could
be established, we provided evidence for the existence of
a selective pressure to maintain the bla system fully functional even on MRSA strains and that the sensor-inducer
gene blaR1 is the primary target for the accumulation of
adaptive mutations in the bla locus.
