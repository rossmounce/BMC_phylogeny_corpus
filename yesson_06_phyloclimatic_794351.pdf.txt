Abstract
Background: The impact of global climate change on plant distribution, speciation and extinction
is of current concern. Examining species climatic preferences via bioclimatic niche modelling is a
key tool to study this impact. There is an established link between bioclimatic niche models and
phylogenetic diversification. A next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a
phylogenetic perspective. We present such a study using Cyclamen (Myrsinaceae), a group which
demonstrates morphological and phenological adaptations to its seasonal Mediterranean-type
climate. How will the predicted climate change affect future distribution of this popular genus of
garden plants?
Results: We demonstrate phylogenetic structure for some climatic characteristics, and show that
most Cyclamen have distinct climatic niches, with the exception of several wide-ranging,
geographically expansive, species. We reconstruct climate preferences for hypothetical ancestral
Cyclamen. The ancestral Cyclamen lineage has a preference for the seasonal Mediterranean climate
characteristic of dry summers and wet winters.
Future bioclimatic niches, based on BIOCLIM and Maxent models, are examined with reference to
a future climate scenario for the 2050s. Over the next 50 years we predict a northward shift in the
area of climatic suitability, with many areas of current distribution becoming climatically unsuitable.
The area of climatic suitability for every Cyclamen species is predicted to decrease. For many
species, there may be no areas with a suitable climate regardless of dispersal ability, these species
are considered to be at high risk of extinction. This risk is examined from a phylogenetic
perspective.
Conclusion: Examining bioclimatic niches from a phylogenetic perspective permits novel
interpretations of these models. In particular, reconstruction of ancestral niches can provide
testable hypothesis about the historical development of lineages. In the future we can expect a
northwards shift in climatic suitability for the genus Cyclamen. If this proves to be the case then
dispersal is the best chance of survival, which seems highly unlikely for ant-dispersed Cyclamen.
Human-assisted establishment of Cyclamen species well outside their native ranges offers hope and
could provide the only means of dispersal to potentially suitable future environments. Even without
human intervention the phylogenetic perspective demonstrates that major lineages could survive
climate change even if many species are lost.

Background
The prospect of global climate change has directed interest
towards investigating the impact of the environment on
floral and faunal distribution, speciation and extinction
[1,2]. One way to investigate species response to climate
is through examination of climatic preferences by constructing bioclimatic niche models (these are also known
as species distribution models or environmental niche
models) [3-6]. These methods establish preferences of a
given species, based on its known distribution, and provide a model of the climate parameters correlating with
this. One of the earliest and simplest methods is BIOCLIM, which uses the minimum and maximum (or 95th
percentiles) of observed values for each climate parameter
to define the environmental niche [3,7]. BIOCLIM's models are more conducive to interpretation than some more
complicated methodologies [8], although many comparisons demonstrate that more complex algorithms such as
Maxent can have greater predictive value under most conditions [4,9]. Once built, the models can be used in conjunction with different climate scenarios and timeframes
to estimate past [10-13], present [9,14,15] and future
[2,6,16-18] distributions.
There is an established link between bioclimatic niche
models and phylogenetic diversification. Peterson et al.
[12] suggest that bioclimatic envelopes are heritable and
are conserved across evolutionary time. Martinez-Meyer et
al. [19] demonstrated this using bioclimatic niche models
of Passerina birds to successfully predict the distribution of
sister species. This is further supported by a wider link
between climate and phylogenetic diversification [1].
Many researchers are now examining species' climatic
preferences across phylogenetic trees [10,20-23]. Of these
studies, those concerned with distributions have focussed
on present or past distributions [10,20-23]. Yet bioclimatic niche models have also been used to predict future
distributions, and their impact on extinction risk [2,6,24].
A clear next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a phylogenetic perspective.
The genus Cyclamen (Myrsinaceae) is a good candidate for
such a study, having a well established phylogeny [25],
good distribution data [26] and exhibiting adaptations to
their seasonal climate [27]. Cyclamen are popular garden
flowers [26]. They have their own global society of followers in the Cyclamen society [28] who have mounted
numerous well-documented collection and recording
expeditions. Cyclamen are primarily distributed around
the Mediterranean, but extend eastwards as far as the
shore of the Caspian sea [26]. There is also a single isolated species (C. somalense) to be found in a small patch of
Somalia [29]. Figure 1 shows a complete distribution map
for Cyclamen based on the maps of Grey-Wilson [26].
Some Cyclamen, such as C. somalense and C. libanoticum

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/72

have a very limited distribution, and are known from only
a few locations. Others such as C. hederifolium are widely
spread across Europe, even expanding their range into the
Southern United Kingdom [30]. The limited dispersal
capacity of Cyclamen arises from the dependence on ant
dispersal of small numbers of large seeds [27], this places
them at higher risk from climate change as they cannot
disperse easily to newly appearing areas of suitable climate. They are a phenologically interesting group, with at
least one species flowering in every month of the year
[28], which is unusual for Mediterranean genera which
usually show consistent seasonality. The seasonal Mediterranean climate, characterised by hot-dry summers and
cooler-wetter winters, is a very important factor for Cyclamen. Most Cyclamen species remain dormant as tubers
during the dry summer months [27]. Current distribution
patterns within Cyclamen have also been linked to past climate change events [31], prompting the question how
could the current predicted climate change affect the
potential future distribution of this well-known genus?
Distribution data were gathered for Cyclamen from herbarium specimens and distribution maps and these data were
used to develop climate profiles for each species. The difference between direct observations and distribution
maps was tested and shown to give similar results. BIOCLIM [7] bioclimatic niche models were produced using
modelled present day climate data from the Climate
Research Unit [32]. These models and underlying climatic
parameters were examined from a phylogenetic perspective on the recent, complete species-level phylogeny of
Compton et al. [25], and a reconstruction of the ancestral
Cyclamen bioclimatic niche model was performed.
Each species' bioclimatic niche model was examined
within a future climate scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the 2050s [33].
Future areas of climatic suitability were compared with
present day suitable areas and actual distribution. Many
species show no future area of climatic suitability and
these are considered to be at high risk of extinction due to
climate change. This extinction risk measure is examined
from a phylogenetic perspective. For full details of methods see methods section below.

Results
When constructing bioclimatic niche models, many
authors suggest using direct observations of species locality to construct the model, either via direct collection or
through examination of natural history collection data
[5,34]. However, sufficient direct observation data is not
always available, and in these circumstances good quality
distributional data can be used to create "pseudo" observations [20]. For Cyclamen, 13 of the 21 species have good
direct observations of locality data (min. 20, max. 1,587

points), sourced from herbarium specimen labels or
Cyclamen Society collecting trips. The remaining species
have fewer than 5 observations each, three have none at
all. However, all 21 Cyclamen species have good extent of
occurrence data available via the distribution maps of
Grey-Wilson [26]. There is good agreement geographically
between the observed data and the distribution maps
(some examples are shown in fig 2, 3). The distribution
maps encompass most of the directly observed points, but
also cover areas for which no observed data are available.
For example, C. persicum has no direct observations for
Tunisia in our locality data sets, but is known to occur in
this region (fig 2). In contrast, the directly observed points
that occur outside the known distribution are near
enough to the known areas to be accounted for by errors
of geographic resolution. For example, examining the data
for C. parviflorum as a worst case scenario (fig 3), we find
the point in the sea is as far from land as any other
observed point is from the known distribution. There are

a few exceptions to this such as the central Israeli distribution for C. persicum (fig 2).
Bioclimatic niche models were built using both direct
observation data and those gained from distribution
maps. The resulting models were compared for the 13 species with sufficient data. Figure 4 shows the results of this
comparison. The models demonstrate a high level of similarity, directly comparing the selected envelopes using
kappa values gives a minimum of 0.96. If we use a cross
projection method then all but two of the models built
from the distribution maps predict more than 80% of the
observed points. The observed-data models are less efficient at predicting the full distribution, but this is because
the observed points do not fully cover all the known areas
(e.g. Tunisia for C. persicum). For the two outlying species,
it is noted that C. hederifolium is a widespread species
which has an established non-native range as far northwards as the UK. The one species for which the models

perform poorly is C. parviflorum, it is noted that this is also
the species with the fewest observed localities.
The models built via the distribution (area) maps of GreyWilson [26] provide a good alternative to those built from
direct (point) observations, they also provide the opportunity to study models for all 21 species of Cyclamen in a
consistent fashion. If there is any bias, it is likely to be due
to the distribution maps encompassing an area greater
than the true range, which will have the affect of widening
the bioclimatic envelope [16]. However, the high agreement of point and area data suggest this effect is minimal,
and all subsequent analyses are performed using models
built from distribution maps.
The bioclimatic niche models give us estimates of the climatic range for each Cyclamen species. The Maxent models
more closely reflect the original distribution maps (kappa:

mean = 0.484, min = 0.067, max = 0.800) than the BIOCLIM models (kappa: mean = 0.430, min = 0.052, max =
0.897). By cumulatively overlaying the areas selected for
each species, we get a genus-wide picture of the climatic
tolerance of Cyclamen. A map of this is displayed in figure
5a, b. These maps can be contrasted with the current distribution displayed in figure 1. The climatic tolerance
according to the BIOCLIM models is much wider than the
achieved distribution, particularly in the northward direction, in contrast the Maxent models closely mirror the current distribution. The distribution map shows that Greece
and Western Turkey are a centre of diversity for Cyclamen.
The models loosely conform to this pattern. It is noted
that the red "hotspot" areas for the distribution map contain 4 species compared with 8â9 for the climatic tolerance hotspots. This shows that several Cyclamen species
are not present everywhere that is climatically suitable for
them.

an excluded point due to poor geographic resolution. Blue Marble satellite image.

Focussing on individual species, we can see a detailed
breakdown of the individual climatic layers for each species in table 1 and figure 6. This demonstrates the wide climatic tolerance within Cyclamen. The classic
Mediterranean-type climate pattern of hot-dry summer
(fig 6) and cool-wet winter is evident for species such as C.
cyprium and C. libanoticum, in fact all but 5 species average
less than 1 mm of rain in the warmest month of the year.
In contrast, there are several species with a wide range of
tolerance, for example C. coum grows in places with summer rainfall ranging from low to high (fig 6). Species such
as C. rohlfsianum, C. graecum, C. persicum and C. somalense
all tolerate highest temperatures above 30 degrees in the
warmest month, in contrast species such as C. purpurascens, C. colchicum and C. parviflorum surviving freezing
temperatures in the coolest month (table 1).

The substantial difference in winter minimum temperatures (-8 to +21Â°C) is indicative of the contrast between
both inland vs. coastal distributions and latitudinal/altitudinal variation. C. somalense is substantially nearer the
equator than any other species and experiences warm
summers and winters, whilst C. purpurascens, the most
northerly species, tolerates freezing winter temperatures
for at least four months of the year. C. creticum, an island
species with its climate controlled by proximity to the sea,
experiences one of the lowest annual temperature ranges
with a mean summer temperature of +25Â°C compared
with +11Â°C in the coldest winter month. C. colchicum, a
species growing in continental Asia, experiences one of
the highest annual temperature ranges with a mean summer temperature of +18Â°C compared with -8Â°C in the
coldest month.

Phylogenetic structure
There is some phylogenetic structure to this data, 8 of the
14 climate parameters demonstrate phylogenetic conservancy using the randomisation test of the quantitative convergence index. Figure 7 shows the mean values of the
climatic parameter Annual Temperature Range, plotted
on the phylogeny of Compton et al. [25]. It is evident that
the clade comprising C. repandum, C. balearicum and C.
creticum (Subgenus Psilanthum) all share low temperature
ranges, whilst the clade C. parviflorum-C. elegans share
higher ranges. In contrast, other climate parameters
appear similar for much of the genus, all but 5 species
share a dry season with the driest month providing less
than 1 mm of rainfall per day. However the phylogenetic
structure in the data is not uniform across the tree; for
example, comparing C. elegans with its wide-ranging sister
taxon, C. coum, shows that they differ for most precipitation values. Overall, the climate variable mean precipita-

tion in the warmest month has the best fit for this
phylogeny (QVI = 0.27). This may, in part, be due to the
high level of similarity of this value amongst most Cyclamen, also the two highest rainfall values (C. purpurascens
and C. colchicum) are sister taxa.
The phylogeny in figure 7 shows ancestral state reconstruction for annual temperature range. The lineage leading to subgenus Psilanthum shares the low range exhibited
by its constituent species (fig 7 node 2). Table 2 shows the
ancestral reconstruction for the means of all the climatic
parameters. The ancestral Cyclamen lineage (node 1) has
the Mediterranean climatic characteristic of dry summers
and wet winters, demonstrated by mean daily precipitation 5 times lower in the warmest month than in the coldest. There is also some frost tolerance exhibited, averaging
more than 1 month with minimum temperature below
freezing.

Table 2: Ancestral reconstruction of climate preference.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:72

If we examine the ancestral model with reference to
today's climate (fig 8), an area of central Greece and Western Turkey is selected which is close to the current centre
of diversity highlighted in figure 5. Other internal nodes
on the phylogeny each show differing present-day realisations of model reconstructions. For example the lineage
leading to the clade comprising C. hederifolium â C. colchi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/72

cum demonstrates the broad tolerance of its wider-ranging
constituent species. However, there is a predominance of
Turkish areas for the majority of these models.
We can examine which of the extant species of Cyclamen is
closest in climatic preference to our model reconstruction.
It is not possible to use the full interpredictivity measure

to determine which of the present day Cyclamen is most
like the ancestral lineage. However, in the area selected by
the model you can find the species C. hederifolium, C.
repandum, C. coum, C. graecum and C. intaminatum. No
extant species has a distribution similar to this area
(Kappa < 0.02 for all species). However, a crude measure
of model similarity based on the sum of squares of the differences of means for each climate layer suggests C. balearicum is overall the most similar to our ancestral
reconstruction.

We can combine sets of these predictions together to produce measures of group similarity, this permits an examination of climatic preferences within a clade. Table 3
shows the mean model similarity amongst the subgenera
recognised by Grey-Wilson [26] (Tab. 3a) and selected
clades from the Cyclamen phylogeny (Tab. 3b). Notice
that subgenus Corticata, subgenus Persicum and the clade
above node 13 (C. parviflorum-C. libanoticum) all show
similarity levels of zero. Several groups (subgenus Psilanthum and the clade above node 16) demonstrate mean
similarity levels which are almost double that within
Cyclamen as a whole (Tab. 3c). However, if we test
whether these similarity values are above that of a random
group of Cyclamen of a similar size we find that the group
means are not significantly different from the random
groups. On closer examination we find that the higher
similarity values are driven by the presence of a single
wide-ranging species within the groups.

As well as comparing the constituent climatic parameters,
we can compare directly the resulting BIOCLIM models
for each species. Figure 9 displays a measure of model
similarity for each pair of Cyclamen species. More than two
thirds of all comparisons show zero prediction of other
species distributions, which suggests that most Cyclamen
are climatically isolated. It is also clear that there are several climatically wide-ranging species (C. coum, C. hederifolium, C. cilicium, C. graecum, C. persicum, C. repandum)
which account for the majority (69%) of all positive predictions. The bioclimatic envelope for C. coum shows
some overlap with the envelopes of all other Cyclamen
except C. somalense.

els with unrestricted dispersal demonstrate a northward
shift in the area of climatic preference, which is particularly evident for the Maxent models (fig 10b). The unrestricted dispersal scenario is highly unlikely without
substantial human intervention, a more likely scenario is
the restricted dispersal hypothesis demonstrated in Figure
11. Here we see major reductions in suitable climate suggested by both algorithms, particularly in central Italy, the
former Yugoslavia, Sicily, Southern Turkey and the far
eastern extent. Overall, Greece & Turkey still show the
most diversity, but the extent is greatly reduced. When we
consider the models for each species in turn (Table 4), we
find that the area of climatic suitability for every Cyclamen
has reduced for both modelling algorithms, the majority
by more than 60%. Many of these species are considered
to be at high risk of extinction due to climate change.

Discussion
Ancestral model reconstruction
Many Cyclamen share a preference for seasonal Mediterranean climate characteristics. The ancestral Cyclamen was
probably well suited to this environment, and may have
had a similar climatic preference to the extant species C.
balearicum. A question remains on the timing of the origin
of Cyclamen and how this compares with estimates of the
emergence of the Mediterranean climate zone.

Although, for some ancestral model reconstructions, no
present-day area was within the suitable envelope, this
does not invalidate the model, as past climates could
exhibit climate types not seen in the present day [35].
However, failure to predict any suitable areas of the rele-

vant palaeoclimate could demonstrate the invalidity of
the models. Yesson and Culham [23] have demonstrated
the plausibility of this general approach to estimates for
ancestral areas based on reconstruction of climate preferences for ancestral lineages in other taxa.
Phylogenetic signal
There is not a phylogenetic pattern of inherited range size
for Cyclamen. Several sister pairs of species are seen to have
drastically different ranges, all but two species pairs on the
phylogeny differ in their total area of distribution by more
than 90%. This fits the pattern of schizo-endemic distribution of C. balearicum and C. repandum found by Thompson et al. [36], whereby a single wide ranging species is
assumed to be progenitor to a narrow ranging isolated sister species. This is supported by the lack of overlap in bioclimatic niche models. This suggests a combination of
geographic, edaphic and climatic constraints are limiting
the maximum area of distribution of some species more
than others.

Examining the extinction risk from a phylogenetic perspective (fig 12a, b) we see clearly that within each major
lineage there is a pattern of contrasting extinction and survival predictions. BIOCLIM and Maxent predict contrasting patterns of individual species threat. When examined
from an overall phylogenetic viewpoint, while many individual species are at high risk, each major lineage is seen
to contain at least one species with a reasonable chance of
survival. This pattern lowers the overall risk to phylogenetic diversity, and presents the risk in a more favourable

Present day models for BIOCLIM and Maxent algorithms examined within 2050s climate scenarios with restrictions of limited dispersal. Kappa
statistic for present day models compared with Grey-Wilson maps.

Whilst many of the constituent climatic variables demonstrate phylogenetic conservancy, the resulting models
which combine the individual variables into bioclimatic
envelopes show little overlap between adjacent nodes. It
may be the case that measures for comparing these envelopes are inadequate when the majority of species are climatically isolated from one-another. The only point of
comparison of bioclimatic niche models that is currently
used is to compare the areas that they select when overlaid
into present day data [19,39]. This is also true for the comparison measures used in model validation such as
Cohen's Kappa [40]. This is not a direct measure of model
similarity. Furthermore such measures may 'hide' real differences for climate types not evident in the present day.
Climate type
Some studies have found patterns of risk associated with
a particular type of climate [18,41]. Thuiller et al. [41]
found species from Mediterranean climates to be at lower
risk of extinction than species from other climates,
whereas Thuiller et al. [18] found species in Mediterranean regions to be the most sensitive to the changing climate, with species in mountainous regions under great
threat but other species having the potential to expand.
For Cyclamen there is no particular climate-type which is
more at risk than another. There is little overlap between

any of the bioclimatic niche models of the high-risk Cyclamen species, many of these species occur in differing climates and geographies. For example the highest risk
group (BIOCLIM models) includes the Mediterraneantype climate of C. rohlfsianum; the continental climate of
the mountain dwelling C. colchicum; the island endemic
C. cyprium; and the African C. somalense which is barely
10Â° north of the equator. However, for the Maxent models the wide-ranging, more generalist species are consistently assigned a high risk.
Measures of risk
These broad classifications of risk can hide some noteworthy detail. For example, although C. balearicum is designated Endangered (>50% area loss), it is noted that the
BIOCLIM future area selection gives no suitable area for
this species within the Balearics, and less than 5% of its
present day French distribution is considered climatically
suitable, indeed most of the predicted suitable climate
occurs in Northern France. It is interesting to note that the
Balearics are still suitable for other Cyclamen species. It is
reassuring to note that the French populations of C. balearicum have a far higher genetic diversity than the Balearic populations, but the latter demonstrate the higher
ecological diversity [31].

There is a link between current range size and extinction
risk due to climate change. For the BIOCLIM models every
species with a current distribution of under 35,000 km2 is
considered the highest risk with the exception of C. pseudibericum. In contrast no species with a range size above
35,000 km2 loses all area. Range size and proportion of
area lost is strongly negatively correlated for the BIOCLIM
(Pearson correlation = -0.816, P < 0.001). In contrast the
Maxent models show weak positive correlation of proportion loss and range size (Pearson correlation = 0.332, P =
0.142). The changes in range size show a distinct scattering across the cladograms whether modelled with BIOCLIM or Maxent (fig 12).

found a relationship between niche breadth and projected
range loss [18,41], (it is trivial to note that for Cyclamen
the widest-ranging species have the broadest niches).
However, the relationship between range size and range
loss reported by Thuiller et al. [41] is a bell shaped curve
with the largest ranges suffering substantial losses,
although it is possible that no Cyclamen would fall into
the category of truly wide-ranging. In contrast the Maxent
models demonstrate the opposite pattern (albeit weakly),
with widest-ranging species losing proportionally more
area. It should be noted, however, that bioclimatic niche
models may be less accurate for wide-ranging generalist
species [4,50].

Methodological issues
There are of course other factors than climate limiting species distributions. At the fine scale factors such as soil,
aspect, and surrounding vegetation will have a role in
determining the establishment of individuals given an
otherwise suitable climate. Such fine-scale limiting factors
are of secondary importance when modelling species distribution at a global or regional scale [42]. These criticisms
of species distribution modelling and the extinction risk
measures based on them are discussed at length in other
places [6,19,41-47] and we refer the reader to these references.

Thuiller et al. [51] considered selecting the best algorithm
for each species in turn based on validation scores. Such a
policy, in this case, would combine the highest area loss
of both methods producing high overall area loss and
high numbers of species with 100% projected area loss.
However it is to be noted that present day validation may
not reflect model validity for the future [46,51].

The BIOCLIM models are restrictive in their definitions of
the edge of a suitable climate, predictions for all areas are
essentially a binary presence/absence and do not allow
any climatic parameter to be outside the observed range
[47]. For example, the BIOCLIM models predict no Cyclamen in the UK, but we know that three species are naturalised there. Alternative modelling algorithms such as
Maxent have the advantage of producing probability
measures rather than binary presence/absence, which provide more realistic edges to ranges [48]. However, for the
UK naturalised Cyclamen, the Maxent models also fail to
select any of their naturalised distribution within the
selected threshold.

The main advantage of BIOCLIM in the context of Phyloclimatic modelling is its independent treatment of climatic variables. As far as we are aware, this is the only
method that permits independent optimisation of environmental characteristics on a phylogeny following established phylogenetic reconstruction methods. These
optimised variables can then be directly converted into a
BIOCLIM bioclimatic niche models. Reconstruction of
ancestral states on a phylogeny requires a distance metric
to directly compare the output models of different species.
There are many problems associated with using the more
complex (and often more precise) models currently being
developed. For example, many discard non-informative
input parameters, meaning models are not directly comparable amongst species as different species models will
be built with different subsets of variables. Other models
are based on the amalgamation of multiple model outputs, again making direct comparison of models difficult.

Both modelling algorithms predict large range loss for all
Cyclamen species, and the predicted future diversity maps
are broadly similar (fig 11). However, predictions for
individual species differ dramatically. The Maxent models
show the highest area loss, yet the BIOCLIM models suggest many more species at the highest extinction risk. This
kind of algorithm dependent difference has been
observed in other studies [44,49].

Conclusion

For the BIOCLIM predictions, it is evident that range size
is a key factor in determining extinction risk due to climate change. Those species at high risk tend to have
smaller distributions and smaller climatically suitable
areas. This is in general agreement with others who have

Climate parameters often show phylogenetic conservancy
within Cyclamen. Despite this, the resulting bioclimatic
envelopes show startling contrast between many sister
species. The consequence is that while individual species
are often at high risk, extinction is not predicted for most

Examining climate preference envelopes from a phylogenetic perspective brings new insight into this field. Ancestral climate envelope reconstruction can provide testable
hypotheses about the development of lineages. In the case
of Cyclamen, the ancestral lineage most probably developed in a Mediterranean type climate similar to parts of
present day Greece and Turkey.

major lineages. The pattern of contrasting niches may not
always be the case and it is likely that in groups demonstrating clearer patterns of niche conservatism it may be
possible to assign risk of area loss due to a changing climate by phylogenetic proximity. This approach may be
useful where data for full scale niche modelling is not
available.
Many Cyclamen species are at high risk from the changing
climate, and none will remain unaffected. Over the next
fifty years we can expect a northwards shift in climatic
suitability for the genus Cyclamen. Many species face the
prospect of their local climate changing so much that their
current distribution will be outside their current observed
climate tolerance. If this proves to be the case then survival requires either adapting over a very short timeframe
(implying exaptive changes or potentially suicidal rates of
natural selection) or dispersing to new areas. The long distance migration option seems highly unlikely for ant-dispersed Cyclamen. This is worsened by the presence of
many geographic barriers, the largest being the Mediterranean sea. Although all Cyclamen are listed in CITES, which
protects them from trade exploitation from the wild, this
does not per-se prevent their extinction though habitat
loss by climate change. There are, however, still reasons
for hope, the garden use of several Cyclamen species in
more northern areas of Europe has facilitated the establishment of some Cyclamen species well outside the climatic zone of their native ranges. This suggests at least
some climatic exaptation and the presence of a nucleus of
plants in an area that will become climatically optimal for
Cyclamen in the future. This provides a novel means of dispersal to, and colonization of, potentially suitable future
environments.

Methods
Phylogeny
The 21 species recognised by Compton et al. [25] were
used for this study. Their phylogenetic study of Cyclamen
is used to define relationships within Cyclamen for this
paper. Their study produced phylogenies based upon
nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnL-F) DNA, as well as morphological data. The phylogenetic trees have strong topological similarity, differing mainly in degree of resolution.
One of the two maximum parsimony trees based on the
combined ITS + trnL-F dataset is used throughout this
analysis. The alternative topology differs only in the position of C. graecum relative to C. rohlfsianum within series
Persicum, our chosen topology agrees with findings of
Clennett [52] with regards to this clade.
Locality data
Locality data were collected for each of the 21 Cyclamen
species. These data came from four sources. Firstly from
Cyclamen Society collecting trips, which has made many

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/72

trips over the period 1987â2004 covering Greece and the
Greek islands, Israel, Sardinia and Turkey, providing
2,315 observations for 12 species [28]. Secondly, data
from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [53],
provides 232 observations for 6 species from 6 institutions covering Austria, Croatia, Germany, Greece and the
Greek islands, Israel, and Italy (a full list of institutions in
provided in the appendix [see Additional file 1]). Thirdly,
data from specimen labels at the University of Reading
Herbarium (RNG) containing 61 observations for 12 species covering the Balearics, Algeria, Austria, the Caucasus,
Corsica, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece and the Greek islands,
Israel, Italy and Turkey.
Points were excluded if they fell in an ocean or sea. Exclusions were minimal, comprising fewer than 3% of the
total observations, primarily being records from near
coastlines with poor geographic resolution (fig 3 shows
an example of poor geographic resolution). Species with
fewer than 10 observations were excluded from analyses,
following Graham et al. [20]. Data from the UK National
Biodiversity Network for C. hederifolium, C. repandum and
C. coum were excluded from the analysis as these represent
records outside the native range of these species [34].
Exclusions reduced the number of analysable Cyclamen
down to 13 species.
The fourth source for distribution data was the detailed
distribution maps of Grey-Wilson [26]. This alternative
approach allowed analysis of all Cyclamen species. These
maps were digitally captured and pseudo distribution
points were produced by taking the centroid of every overlapping quarter degree square. Quarter degrees were chosen as this is the resolution of the climate data used in this
study. This produced distribution data for all 21 Cyclamen
species. Due to its restricted distribution C. libanoticum
has only 5 pseudo-localities following this methodology,
and is the only species that falls below the 10 observations
recommended by Graham et al. [20], however reasonable
models were still produced for this species, and this species is included in all analyses.
Cyclamen range size was estimated by summing the area of
each quarter degree grid square that overlapped with the
digitised distribution maps.
Climate data
Present day observed climate data were taken from an
observed climatology dataset (known as CRU CL1) from
the Climate Research Unit [32,54]. Future data were taken
from the Hadley centre general circulation model
(HadCM3) from the IPCC website [33]. The period 2040â
2069 hereafter referred to as 2050s was chosen as the
future time-frame. This allows sufficient time for the
effects of climate change to be detectable, whilst minimis-

ing the overall timeframe to reduce uncertainties [55,56]
There are many different future climate scenarios based
on different predictions of socio-economic factors, we
have chosen the A2 scenario representing the mid-range
of climate change severity [56]. In order to produce future
climate datasets which are directly comparable with the
observed data, we applied modelled changes in climate to
the present day observed data. The modelled changes
were calculated by subtracting the 2050s prediction from
directly comparable modelled present day climate following Peterson et al. [24] and IPCC recommendations [57].

is analogous to 1 minus the retention index for discrete
characters. A randomisation test of this value was performed [63]. A random shuffle of the terminal node values was optimised on the chosen topology, this was
repeated 100 times for each character. The observed QVI
was compared with the distribution of the randomisation
replicates to test if the observed value is different from a
random placement of data on the fixed phylogeny. If the
observed QVI was outside the 95% confidence interval of
the randomisation replicates then it was considered significantly different from random [63].

Both the present and future datasets were processed into
biologically meaningful climate profile parameters [7].
Standard deviation of mean temperature, mean daily precipitation in wettest month, mean temperature in warmest month, mean temperature, standard deviation of
mean precipitation, number of months with minimum
temperature above freezing, mean temperature in coolest
month, mean daily precipitation in warmest month,
annual temperature range, mean daily precipitation in
driest month, lowest temperature in coolest month, mean
daily precipitation in coolest month, mean daily precipitation, highest temperature in warmest month. These are
similar to Busby [7] and were processed using the "Climate Data Processor" plug-in developed by Tim Sutton as
part of the Quantum GIS project [58].

Only the variables demonstrating phylogenetic conservancy, with reference to the QVI, were used in the construction of ancestral bioclimatic niche models. This reduced
the number of variables used in this stage of the modelling from 14 to 8.

Modelling
The mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum
values were collected for all climatic parameters, for all
species. Each value was independently optimised as a continuous character across the chosen phylogeny, using
square change parsimony optimisation implemented in
Mesquite [59], following the methodology of Graham et
al. [20]. A table showing each of these optimised values
for every node on the tree is provided in the appendix [see
Additional file 2]. These values define a BIOCLIM bioclimatic niche model [3] for each node on the tree. Models
were created and manipulated using the BIOCLIM algorithm of the openModeller software package version 0.3.4
[60].

Additional models were constructed using the maximum
entropy method (Maxent) for modelling species geographic distributions [9]. This new method has been
shown to be very effective for species distribution modelling [4]. Models were built using the same data as the BIOCLIM models using Maxent version 2.3.0 [61]. Thresholds
were calculated for models to maximise the Kappa statistic. These thresholds were used to determine presence/
absence for present day and future projections.
The quantitative convergence index (QVI) [62] was calculated for each optimised climate parameter. This measure

Similarity of bioclimatic niche models was assessed using
interpredictivity calculations [19,39]. This involves the
overlaying of locality records of one species (Species A)
into the predicted area of another (Species B). Similarity is
measured as the percentage of points of A falling within
the prediction area of the model of B, and vice versa [19].
Note this is not a symmetric measure, for example, if the
envelope for A completely encompasses B then we could
have BâA but AâB, therefore both directions of similarity
were performed. Similarity was also assessed using
Cohen's Kappa statistic [40,64]. Mean similarity for a
group of species was assessed by averaging similarity values of each pair of species within the group.
Summary 'hotspot' maps were produced by creating
binary presence/absence maps for each species based on
their bioclimatic niche model output, then summing the
number of species predicted in each quarter degree cell.
This was accomplished using software accessible through
the openModeller project [60].
Present day bioclimatic niche models were examined
within the 2050s climate scenario to produce a future distribution estimate based on climate suitability. Species
with zero area predicted as climatically suitable are
selected as high extinction risk [65]. When predicting
future distributions and extinction risk it is necessary to
take dispersal rates into account [2,66]. Plant migration
rates have been estimated at 20â40 km over a 100 year
timescale [67], more recently even lower rates have been
suggested [68], it is highly unlikely that the ant-dispersed
Cyclamen will exceed these dispersal rates. Our analysis
uses a fifty year timescale and a geographic resolution of
approx 25 Ã 25 km squares, so we employ a model permitting dispersal only within cells immediately adjacent to
the current distribution. Therefore species which have
future predictions which do not overlap with this the

slightly expanded present distribution are also considered
at risk, though this is regarded as lower risk than the case
where there is no suitable area. Risk categories are
assigned according to IUCN classifications based on area
loss over 505 years [16,69], namely: Extinction 100% loss,
Critical >80%, Endangered >50%, Vulnerable >30%
