Abstract
Background: Microorganisms are a large and diverse form of life. Many of them live in association with
large multicellular organisms, developing symbiotic relations with the host and some have even evolved to
form obligate endosymbiosis [1]. All Carpenter ants (genus Camponotus) studied hitherto harbour primary
endosymbiotic bacteria of the Blochmannia genus. The role of these bacteria in ant nutrition has been
demonstrated [2] but the omnivorous diet of these ants lead us to hypothesize that the bacteria might
provide additional advantages to their host. In this study, we establish links between Blochmannia, growth
of starting new colonies and the host immune response.
Results: We manipulated the number of bacterial endosymbionts in incipient laboratory-reared colonies
of Camponotus fellah by administrating doses of an antibiotic (Rifampin) mixed in honey-solution. Efficiency
of the treatment was estimated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH), using Blochmannia specific primers (qPCR) and two fluorescent probes (one for all
Eubacterial and other specific for Blochmannia). Very few or no bacteria could be detected in treated ants.
Incipient Rifampin treated colonies had significantly lower numbers of brood and adult workers than
control colonies. The immune response of ants from control and treated colonies was estimated by
inserting nylon filaments in the gaster and removing it after 24 h. In the control colonies, the encapsulation
response was positively correlated to the bacterial amount, while no correlation was observed in treated
colonies. Indeed, antibiotic treatment increased the encapsulation response of the workers, probably due
to stress conditions.
Conclusion: The increased growth rate observed in non-treated colonies confirms the importance of
Blochmannia in this phase of colony development. This would provide an important selective advantage
during colony founding, where the colonies are faced with severe inter and intraspecific competition.
Furthermore, the bacteria improve the workers encapsulation response. Thus, these ants are likely to be
less susceptible to various pathogen attacks, such as the Phoridae fly parasitoids, normally found in the
vicinity of Camponotus nests. These advantages might explain the remarkable ecological success of this ant
genus, comprising more than 1000 species.

Background
An increasing set of data is shedding light on the role of
microorganisms that have co-evolved with their hosts,
including humans [3]. They illustrate the high diversity of
endosymbiotic forms among living organisms. Moreover
the evidence of gene transfer between bacterial cells or
viruses and eukaryotic cells supports the theory of symbiotic relationships as a major force driving evolution [4]
and as a source of phenotypic complexity [5]. Multiple
new symbionts are regularly discovered in the same host,
which can compete or cooperate [3,6]. Normally, they
play a role in host nutrition; defence against pathogens
remains an underappreciated benefit of such associations,
both in invertebrates and vertebrates [7,8]. Social insects
are particularly concerned as they are highly susceptible to
infectious diseases, due to their lifestyle, and have evolved
several associations with microorganisms [9].
Endosymbionts are very common among insects, especially in those sucking plant sap, feeding on vertebrate
blood for their entire life span, and those that eat wood
and keratin. As they are all strict specialists in nourishment, it is assumed that endosymbionts play a role in providing complementary elements absent from these
restricted diets. Camponotus genus, carpenter ants, have
established an association with intracellular endosymbionts Blochmannia, a taxon of γ-Proteobacteria, found in all
Camponotus species studied hitherto [10]. The bacteria live
within specialized cells, the bacteriocytes. The function of
the endosymbionts is not fully elucidated but their role as
dietary complement suppliers has been pointed out after
the genome sequence analysis of two Blochmannia species.
The bacteria is probably able to supply nitrogen and sulphur compounds to the host [11-13]. Moreover, bacteria
elimination using antibiotic treatment is deleterious and
chemically defined diets can complement bacteria suppression [2,14] demonstrating the necessary nutritional
role of bacteria. However, the presence of Blochmannia in
omnivorous Camponotus species suggests that bacteria
may also have other functions beneficial to the ants. Some
studies have suggested that Blochmannia may play a more
important role during the colony founding phase and
growth rather than in adult worker maintenance [15] or
may play a role in pheromone production [16].
Microbes that forms chronic infections in a host lineage
may evolve to promote host survival or benefits to its
host, as this will help to maintain its immediate ecological
resource [17]. In this context, secondary endosymbionts
can provide hosts with defences against parasites, beyond
nutritional advantages [18,19]. So far, no similar example
with primary endosymbionts has been reported. Externally located bacteria are also capable of conferring protection to insect hosts against parasite infections [20].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/29

Here, we tested the hypotheses that Blochmannia provide
faster colony development in the initial stages (incipient
colonies) as previously stated [15] and/or improve the
host immune system of the host. We used the encapsulation rate as an index of the immune response and analysed whether it was correlated or not with the number of
bacteria. The use of incipient colonies, obtained from
founding queens, is a suitable choice since it allows the
study of animals of similar ages and reduces the effects of
natural selection operating on colonies throughout their
development.

Results
Endosymbiont identification
The 16S rDNA endosymbiont sequence was deposited in
the GenBank database under accession number
EF422835. According to the Ribosomal Database Project
[21], the 16S rDNA sequence of Camponotus fellah endosymbiont correspond to an unclassified γ-Proteobacteria
closely related to 16rDNA sequences from Blochmannia
endosymbionts bacteria of various Camponotus ant species. This sequence has G+C content of 47% which is near
to that of other Blochmannia symbionts.

When compared with the nucleic sequences of other Blochmannia (tools available in NCBI/Blast), maximum identity ranged from 91–93%. However, other Blochmannia
species present in GenBank exhibit up to 98% of identity
to each other. Phylogenetic comparisons showed the
existence of a monophyletic group containing classified
and unclassified endosymbionts from Camponotus ant
species, closer to other insect endosymbionts and distinct
from other outgroup bacteria (data not published).
The use of FISH with primers specific for Eubacteria and
Blochmannia endosymbionts showed that bacteriocytes of
midgut preparations were full of bacteria. In these preparations it was possible to see the individual bacterium and
its rod form. The bacteriocytes were also detected in the
oocytes by FISH as well.
Effectiveness of antibiotic treatment
The quantity of Blochmannia in midgut bacteriocytes was
estimated after Rifampin treatment using two complementary methods: real-time quantitative PCR and Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The two methods
showed a reduction of Blochmannia numbers in midgut
bacteriocytes after 12-weeks of antibiotic treatment.
Within this period, FISH did not detect the presence of
Blochmania in the bacteriocytes (Fig. 1). However quantitative real-time PCR indicated that the bacteria were not
completely eliminated as a low quantity of 16S rDNA bacteria molecules can be detected in the midgut. Treated and
control groups differed significantly in their content of
Blochmannia measured as 16S rDNA molecules (Mann-

significantly throughout the time of the experiment but
no difference between treated and control colonies was
observed (Fig 3b). The variation in workers numbers was
significatively different between treated and control colonies with untreated colonies having more workers (Fig

The treatment reduced the quantity of bacteria by 75%.
Moreover, the individual variation in bacteria amount
was more constant in antibiotic treated colonies than in
control colonies.
Evaluation of colony development
Each colony was composed of at least one larva, pupa or
worker and queen. Colonies composed only with the
queen or colonies with a dying queen during the experiment were excluded. After seven months, seven control
colonies and nine treated colonies were kept for further
analysis. Workers, larvae and pupae numbers were not significantly different during the first three months after the
beginning of the experiments. After this time, untreated
colonies displayed more accentuated larvae production

Amount of Blochmannia endosymbiont versus
encapsulation response
When expressing encapsulation rate versus 16S rDNA
molecules amount (as measure of Blochmannia amount in
individual midgut), control and treated colonies displayed different patterns of immune response. We found
a significant positive correlation between encapsulation
rate and bacteria amount in the ants from control colonies: the bacteria did facilitate the encapsulation response
(Pearson's r, p = 0.003, n = 27, Fig. 4). On the contrary,
ants from treated colonies did not display a correlation
between the amount of bacteria in the midgut and the
encapsulation response (Pearson's r, p = 0.92, n = 29, Fig.

An ANCOVA analysis with the encapsulation rate as independent variable showed that treated workers present a

Antibiotic treatment with Rifampin considerably reduced
the endosymbiont number in the midgut, although they
were never totally eliminated and there was a great variability between workers. This may be due to different access
to the antibiotic and some ants may not drink the antibiotic solution or, as observed by Feldhaar et al. (2007),
may be explained by the fact that DNA of the endosymbiont may still be detectable by qRT-PCR when bacteria are
not alive or active. Additionally, it was confirmed that
bacterial sequences were not integrated in the genome of
the ant by a PCR test performed on ant DNA from legs
using Blochmannia 16S rDNA and ant 18S rDNA primers
(data not shown).

The treatment had a remarkable impact on colony development by reducing larvae production and worker numbers, corroborating previous worker [2]. Carrying out the
studies in entire incipient colonies, we can demonstrate
the importance of endosymbionts in this phase of colony
development. According Feldhaar et al. (2007), essential
amino acids provided by endosymbionts improve work-

ers ability to raise pupae. Here, we have verified that control colonies exhibited a bigger population in the first
seven months of colony development. Since the establishment phase is critical for new colonies, harbouring more
bacteria may have major ecological consequences in a
context of inter and intraspecific competition: more workers confers a special advantage to maintain a young colony, occupy and monopolize food resources. Indeed,
animal protein food resources are more unpredictable in
the time-space scale. Blochmannia presence could signify a
possible adaptation for ants to fluctuations in protein
availability, permitting the colony growth even in absence
of preys. We do not know the mechanisms allowing an
increase in brood production, beyond the direct nutritional effects on treated queen, but several mechanisms
are plausible, including a direct oogenesis control. For
example, it has been demonstrated that Wolbachia bacteria are necessary for the host oogenesis in a particular
strain of the parasitic wasp Asobara tabida [22]. Furthermore, it was evidenced that apoptosis prevention of nurse
cells by Wolbachia can regulate the host oogenesis [23].
We have demonstrated that Blochmannia play another
important function by improving Camponotus host
immune system. The encapsulation rate measured in
Rifampin treated workers was significantly higher when
compared with control colonies. Although no evident
toxic effect (like increase in mortality) was observed, it is
expected that antibiotic treatment has stressing effects on
workers and that the increase of the encapsulation rate
might correspond to an adaptive response to stress. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment seemed to mask the effects
of endosymbiont number on encapsulation response
observed in control colonies, where the bacteria favoured
the encapsulation response. Positive effects of symbionts
on host immune system have been described in the last
years. For example, the facultative symbionts of Acyrthosiphon pisum (the pea aphid) confer it resistance to parasitoid attacks [18]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that
Wolbachia confer vigorous antiviral protection to Drosophila [19]. The mechanisms by which the resistance is
expressed is still unknown, but in another example it was
showed that symbiotic bacteria could compete directly for
space and resources and thus prevent host colonization by
pathogens [24,25].
Encapsulation is the principal physiological response
against parasitoids suggesting an important role of the
stimulation induced by Blochmannia in the protection
against parasites. This strong interaction between symbiotic bacteria and ants may explain the persistence and
broad occurrence of symbiotic bacteria in the Camponotus
genus. Ants from Camponotus genus are abundant almost
everywhere in the world where ants are found, comprising
more than 600 described species within an estimated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/29

number greater than 1,000 species [26]. Its large distribution, the diversity of forms and food behaviour and the
occurrence on diverse environments make the system
Camponotus/Blochmannia an interesting model to study
how ecological forces determine symbiont characteristics
and how bacteria determine the ant traits. For example, it
is interesting to determine how genetic differences found
among different species of Blochmannia could be related
to host ecological characteristics.
The social habits of the ants make them particularly vulnerable to several parasites and parasitoids. Phoridae flies
are frequently found around Camponotus nests and their
influence is fundamental in regulating the ant communities [27]. So, it can be expected that Camponotus species
more exposed to Phoridae attack should harbour more
bacteria. The physiological mechanism linking bacterial
amount and encapsulation response remains unknown.
Although the better workers "quality" due to extra nutrients furnished by bacteria is the more probable explanation, direct production of biomolecules in stress situation
should not be excluded.
An efficient immune system is a major trait allowing the
existence of social insect colonies with thousand of individuals, genetically related [28], living close together, constantly exposed to parasitic disease risks. Competition in
the first stages of colony growth constitutes also a great
challenge to reach the reproductive stage. Thus, Blochmannia endosymbionts appear to be a fundamental partner,
responsible for the ecological success of Camponotus ants.
As more than 10% of insect species depend on obligate
bacterial mutualists for their viability and reproduction
[29], the research on symbiosis between bacteria and animals appears to be a new and promising field, particularly
in social insects.

Methods
Camponotus fellah: sampling sites and culture
Camponotus ants develop by complete metamorphosis,
like all hymenopterans, going through stages of the egg,
larva, pupa, and adult worker or reproductive. Pupae exist
in conspicuous silk cocoons. Newly fecundated females
start a new colony, caring for their first brood of larvae
until they develop into workers, which then begin to forage for food. Founding queens of C. fellah were collected
in Tel-Aviv in March 2006 and 2007. Colonies were kept
in plastic containers (20 × 20 × 10 cm) with plaster nests
in a climate chamber (constant temperature of 28°C, 12
h light per day), and were fed twice a week with Tenebrio
molitor larvae and commercial honey solution (BeeHappy®, France). In 2006 and 2007 we used 10 control
colonies (fed with Tenebrio and honey) and 10 treated colonies (fed with Tenebrio and honey in the first week, and
Tenebrio larvae and honey solution containing 1% of the

antibiotic Rifampin the second week and after). In previous studies on other Camponotus species [30] Rifampin
was shown to reduce the number of bacteria without
increasing mortality and did not cause damage to the ant
midgut tissues. The treatment was maintained during
three months.
Because the occurrence of Wolbachia is widespread in ants
[31] and these symbiotic bacteria can have negative effects
on immunity-related traits of insects [32], their incidence
was checked in the C. fellah colonies studied, using two
pairs of primers based on Wolbachia ftsZ sequences [31],
so as to amplify A and B-group Wolbachia specific product
[31]. No incidence of Wolbachia was detected.
Symbiont identification
Symbiont identification was based on sequencing of the
16S rRNA gene and Fluorescent in situ hybridization. The
16S rRNA gene was amplified using the previously
described primers SL (TTGGGATCCAGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAGAT) and SR (CACGAATTCTACCTTGTTACGACTTCACCCC) [33]. The PCR reactions were
performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 2.5 mM
dNTPs, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 5 pmol each oligonucleotide and
2.5 U/μl Taq DNA polymerase (GoldStar®). Amplification
was performed in an Eppendorf thermocycler according
to the following conditions: 30 s denaturation at 94°C, 30
s primers annealing at 55 °C and 1.5 min primer extension at 72°C, running 35 cycles. The amplified DNA fragment of approximately 1,550 bp was purified using a
QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen) and directly
sequenced using the ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle.
The sequencing reactions were performed using the SL
and SR primers and using the two internal primers
sequences CampL (5'-GAATTACTGGGCGTAAAGAGT-3')
and CampR (5'-GGAACGTATTCACCG TGAC-3'). Additionally, two reverse primers were designed to complete
the sequences: P1rev(5'-CTCTCAGACCAGCTAAGGAT3') and P2rev(5'-ACCGCTACACCTGGAATTCT-3').

The oligonucleotides used for in situ hybridization were
described previously. Bacteriocytes were visualized by
FISH with oligonucleotide probes Eub338 (5'-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3') [34], targeting a conserved
region of the eubacterial 16S rRNA, and with Bfl172 (5'CCTATCTGGGTTCATCCAATGGCATAAGGC-3'), targeting a 16S rRNA region specific for B. floridanus [33].
Probes were labelled with the fluorescent dyes Cy3 or
FITC at the 5' end (MWG-BIOTECH AG, Ebersberg, Germany). For protocol process details see [2]. The ovaries of
three years old queen were dissected, fixed and hybridized
like the midguts. The slides were analyzed with a Leica
DMR microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and pictures were taken with a RT Slider digital
camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI,
USA).

Evaluation of colony development
Colonies collected in 2006 were used to evaluate control
colonies versus treated colonies development. Over a
period of seven months (including the first three months
of antibiotic treatment) the number of brood (larvae and
pupae) and workers in each colony were counted each
month, during seven months.
Encapsulation rate assay
Encapsulation followed by melanisation is an efficient
innate immune response against parasites. We can trigger
this response by inserting an inert antigen, like nylon filament. To measure the ant immune response, an encapsulation test was performed by inserting a 1.5 mm-long
piece of nylon monofilament (0.12 mm diameter) in the
pleural membrane between the second and third tergite.
This procedure was carried out on three workers from
each colony, with a total of 30 workers for each group,
based on the procedures adopted by Rantala & Kortet
[35]. Twenty four hours after, the implants were removed
from the haemocoel and placed on a glass slide to be
mounted into Clarion™ medium. The filament was examined under a light microscope and photographed using a
digital camera (Olympus DP50). The mean grey value of
the whole implant was measured using the ImageJ 1.37v
software. We assumed that the darkest grey received the
highest encapsulation rate (total black). The background
grey value was subtracted to correct the values of the
implants. The midgut of each worker was dissected in sterile PBS (137 mM NaCl-2.7 mM KCl-4.3 mM sodium
phosphate-1.4 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2) and
conserved in tubes independently at -20C° for quantitative PCR.
Assessing antibiotic treatment effects
Antibiotc treatments effects were assessed by two different
and complementary techniques: Real time qPCR and Fluorescent in situ hybridization (Fish).
Real time qPCR
DNA was isolated from the whole midgut of individual
workers that were previously tested for encapsulation rate
(see Encapsulation assays) using DNA extraction commercial kit (Gentra Systems Puregene©, Minneapolis, MN,
USA) according to manufacturer's recommendations then
resuspended in 20 μl double distilled water. Quantitative
PCR reactions were performed in presence of SYBR Green
on ABI Prism 7000 gene expression system according to
the manufacturers' instructions (Applied Biosystems,
France) using 5-time dilution of each DNA. Bacteria were
quantified using specific primers designed to amplified a
16S rDNA 150-bp-length fragment of Blochmannia
(16SFor
5'-AGAATTCCAGGTGTAGCGGTG-3'
and
16SRev 5'-TACGGCATGGACTACCAGGG-3'). Ant DNA
were quantified using specific primers designed to amplify

and
18SRev
5'ACCTCTAACGTCGCAATACG-3'). These primers had
been efficiently used in another study with Blochmannia
floridanus [14]. The 18S rRNA ant gene copy number was
used so as to normalize each dissected sample with the
same quantity of ant DNA material. This gene was first
specifically cloned and sequenced. Then real-time PCR
specific primers (18SFor 5'-TTAGAGTGCTTAAAGCAGGC-3' and 18SRev 5'-ACCTCTAACGTCGCAATACG3') were design based on the sequence and used to generate by classic PCR a 18S rDNA specific amplicon used to
establish a standard curve expressing the Cycle Threshold
(Ct) versus the logarithm of the copy number of 18S
rDNA purified PCR products. These specific primers were
also used to amplify 18S rDNA using DNA extracted from
dissected samples. The exact copy number of 18S rDNA
was established based on the experimentally obtained Ct
value and the standard curve. This value was used to correct the calculated copy number of bacterial 16S rDNA.
