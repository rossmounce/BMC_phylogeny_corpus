Abstract
Background: Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is the aqueous effluent of olive oil producing processes.
Given its high COD and content of phenols, it has to be decontaminated before being discharged.
Anaerobic digestion is one of the most promising treatment process for such an effluent, as it combines
high decontamination efficiency with methane production. The large scale anaerobic digestion of OMWs
is normally conducted in dispersed-growth reactors, where however are generally achieved unsatisfactory
COD removal and methane production yields. The possibility of intensifying the performance of the
process using a packed bed biofilm reactor, as anaerobic treatment alternative, was demonstrated. Even
in this case, however, a post-treatment step is required to further reduce the COD. In this work, a
biological post-treatment, consisting of an aerobic biological "Manville" silica bead-packed bed aerobic
reactor, was developed, tested for its ability to complete COD removal from the anaerobic digestion
effluents, and characterized biologically through molecular tools.
Results: The aerobic post-treatment was assessed through a 2 month-continuous feeding with the
digested effluent at 50.42 and 2.04 gl-1day-1 of COD and phenol loading rates, respectively. It was found to
be a stable process, able to remove 24 and 39% of such organic loads, respectively, and to account for 1/
4 of the overall decontamination efficiency displayed by the anaerobic-aerobic integrated system when fed
with an amended OMW at 31.74 and 1.70 gl-1day-1 of COD and phenol loading rates, respectively. Analysis
of 16S rRNA gene sequences of biomass samples from the aerobic reactor biofilm revealed that it was
colonized by Rhodobacterales, Bacteroidales, Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales, Rhodocyclales and genera
incertae sedis TM7. Some taxons occurring in the influent were not detected in the biofilm, whereas
others, such as Paracoccus, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter, enriched significantly in the biofilter
throughout the treatment.
Conclusion: The silica-bead packed bed biofilm reactor developed and characterized in this study was
able to significantly decontaminate anaerobically digested OMWs. Therefore, the application of an
integrated anaerobic-aerobic process resulted in an improved system for valorization and decontamination
of OMWs.

Background
Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is the effluent resulting
from olive oil producing processes. Due to their high
COD loading rates and content of toxic phenolic compounds, OMWs have to be decontaminated before being
discharged [1,2]. Among the treatment methods currently
available for this effluent, anaerobic digestion is generally
considered the most promising because of its ability to
combine a marked OMW decontamination potential with
the ability to generate biogas rich of CH4 [3,4]. The large
scale anaerobic digestion of OMWs is normally conducted
in dispersed-growth reactors, where however the removal
of the toxic phenolic fraction is often unsatisfactory [5,6].
The possibility of intensifying the dephenolisation potential of the process by performing it in anaerobic column
reactor packed with granular activated carbon (GAC) was
recently demonstrated [7,8]. GAC-digestor resulted to be
a reproducible and stable OMW digesting process capable
of a tolerance to high OMW organic loads and methanogenic performances significantly higher than those of the
other bench-scale up-flow packed-bed biofilm OMW
digestors described so far in the literature [3,9-11] and of
those of the dispersed-growth digestors previously developed with the same microbial inoculum [7,12,13]. Molec-

ular analysis of GAC-packed bed biofilm showed that it
was heterogeneously composed by a large number of Proteobacteria, bacteria of the Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides
group, sulfate-reducing bacteria and low G+C gram-positive bacteria along with a limited number of highly abundant Archaea taxons mostly due to Methanobacterium
formicicum [8].
Despite of its improved OMW decontamination performances, GAC-digestor generated effluents with a COD generally too high to allow their release in the environment
or their use in agriculture [14]. Thus, the opportunity to
implement the GAC-digestor decontamination potential
by integrating it with an aerobic biological post-treatment
was explored in this study. A "Manville" silica bead (SB)packed bed aerobic reactor was developed, hydraulically
connected to the GAC-digestor and employed to posttreat OMW digested effluents. The integrated anaerobicaerobic process was operated in continuous mode and
assessed through a 2 month experiment. In this paper the
decontamination potential and main microbial features
(e.g., structure and spatial distribution of reactor microbial community) of the aerobic post-treatment are
reported and discussed. Despite the large number of stud-

ies already published on the biotreatment of OMWs [24,7,8,11-13,15], this is the first work in which the use of
an integrated anaerobic-aerobic continuously operating
biofilter system is proposed for such a purpose. Furthermore, this is also the first work in which an aerobic biofilter colonized by the native microflora of an anaerobically
digested OMW is assessed under a technological and biological point of view.

Results
Performances of the integrated anaerobic-aerobic biofilter
system
The integrated anaerobic-aerobic system was fed with
AOMW at high and constant organic loading rate for a 2
month period (Table 1). Fig. 2 shows the evolution of
COD and total phenol concentration in the influent of the
integrated system and in the influent and the effluent of
the aerobic biofilter throughout the whole experiment.
The pollutant removal attained with the anaerobic digestion (expressed as COD or phenol removal efficiency, and
calculated by dividing the amount of pollutant removed
by the amount of pollutant occurring in the reactor influent) was of about 45 and 60% of initial AOMW COD and
phenolic compounds, respectively. These removal efficiency were improved by about 30% through the aerobic
post-treatment, thus permitting an overall removal of
AOMW COD and phenol loading rates applied to the
sequential anaerobic-aerobic treatment of about 59 and
76%, respectively (Table 1). No HPLC-detectable aromatic metabolites accumulated in the aerobic SB-biofilter
throughout the whole experiment. A large array of volatile
fatty acids (acetate, propionic acid, iso-butyric acid,
butyric acid and valeric acid) occurred in the SB-reactor
influent, where they were responsible for about 30% of
the influent COD, but they were not detected in the reactor effluent. pH and redox potential of the SB-reactor
influent were 5.2 ± 0.2 and -290 mV, respectively, but they

increased markedly (up to 6.5 and 150 mV, respectively)
as a result of the aerobic treatment.
Biological features of the SB-biofilter
The biological properties of the SB aerobic biofilter were
investigated at the end of the 2 months of operation by
determining its content of immobilized biomass and the
structure and spatial distribution of its microbial community. The amount of immobilized biomass detected at 5,
20 and 38 cm of height (from the bottom) of the reactor
packed-bed was (in mg of dried biomass/g of dried support) 12.74 ± 0.85, 11.38 ± 1.01 and 27.51 ± 1.58, respectively. Running the average of such values (17.21 mg/g)
and considering that the reactor was packed with 0.213 kg
of dried support, it can be estimated that the SB-reactor
harbored a total immobilized biomass of 3.67 g (on dry
weight basis).

The structure of the microbial community occurring at
different regions of the reactor packed-bed as well as in
the influent and effluent of the reactor, was investigated
through T-RFLP analysis. Fluorescent amplifications of
16S rRNA genes with universal eubacterial primers were
successful for all of the samples examined. T-RFLP analysis of biofilm consortia obtained at 5, 20 and 38 cm height
of the reactor packed bed yielded the same three major TRFs of 81, 280 and 392 bp length with RsaI restriction
enzyme digestion. The three biofilm samples displayed
similar T-RFLP patterns with a predominant T-RF with 81
bp of length (Fig. 3). Also the abundance of each bacterial
population (represented as the peak height of each T-RF in
relation to the total peak height of all T-RFs detected) was
almost identical in the three biofilm samples. The major
T-RFs detected in the influent after RsaI digestion were 98,
280 and 386 bp in length (Table 2). These peaks, which
were detected and characterized in the effluent of the GAC
reactor [8], were affiliated with Synergistes (clone B12, TRF of 98 bp), Bacteroides (clone B25, T-RF of 280 bp) and

Table 1: COD and phenol removal efficiency. COD and total phenol loading rates with which the reactors were fed along with removal
efficiency (%) of COD and total phenol biodegradation occurred both in the sole reactors and in the whole integrated anaerobicaerobic system in steady state conditions.

γ-Proteobacteria (clone B1, T-RF of 386 bp), respectively.
Only T-RF of 386 bp in length was detected in the AOMW
introduced in the integrated biofilters. A microbial community displaying T-RFLP patterns very similar to those
obtained from biofilm was found to occur in the SB-reactor effluents (data not shown).
A total of 34 clones from 16S rRNA gene clonal libraries
of biofilm consortia were randomly picked for PCR
amplification and the amplified products digested with
EcoRI, EcoRI plus KpnI and RsaI restriction enzymes. Eight
different types of RFs (C81, C183, C280, C392, C610,
H172, PS1 and PS156) were obtained (data not shown).
Sequencing analysis of these RFs showed that clones from
biofilm samples taken at different regions of the reactor
having the same RF pattern were identical. The corresponding rDNA inserts were considered to belong to the
same sequence type, resulting in the identification of 8
operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The sequences
retrieved from the biofilm libraries were compared with
the 16S rRNA reference sequences of the Ribosomal Database Project II database and were found to be > 80% identical to known rDNA sequences. Clone C280 was identical
to clone B25 (Bacteroides group; Accession number
AJ608923), which was detected in the effluent of the GAC
reactor [8]. Clone C81 was closely related to Paracoccus
versutus type strains ATCC 25364 (Accession number
Y16962) and DSM 582 (Accession number Y16931) with
97.2% similarity (Fig. 4 panel A) and to Paracoccus spp.
strains isolated from a solid-phase denitrification process
using poly(ε-caprolactone) as carbon and energy source

[16] with 97.6% similarity. The remaining six clonal
sequences loosely related to Pseudomonadales (clone H172
with 80.7% similarity to Acinetobacter schindleri type strain
LUH5832; clone PS1 with 80.7% similarity to Pseudomonas nitroreducens type strain LMG 1224; clone PS156
with 96.4% similarity to Pseudomonas alcaliphila type
strain AL15–21), Enterobacteriales (clone C392 with 75%
similarity to Enterobacter cloacae), Rhodocyclales (clone
C610 with 94.0% similarity to Dechlorosoma spp. strain
PCC) and genera incertae sedis TM7 (clone C183 with
89.5% similarity to uncultured bacterium TM7 LH21, Fig.
4 panel B). Analysis of clone distribution indicated that
Paracoccus and Bacteroides were the major groups in the
biofilm consortia obtained from the different portions of
the reactor packed-bed (70%, Fig. 5).
T-RFLP analysis of each RF showed that clone C81 could
be matched with the 81 bp length fragment after RsaI
digestion and clone C280 could be matched with the 280
bp length RsaI-fragment. In addition, clone C81 generated
a small T-RF with the size of 385 bp after RsaI digestion
due to incomplete digestion. Clone C183 generated a 183
bp length fragment which was a low abundant T-RF in the
T-RFLP patterns of biofilm consortia. Clone C392 generated T-RF with the size of 392 bp, while clone H172 did
not generate a RsaI T-RF.

Discussion
An intensified OMW anaerobic digesting process consisting of a GAC-packed bed biofilm reactor was recently
developed and assessed [8]. In order to further reduce

COD of the effluents resulting from the process, the possibility of implementing the GAC-digestor with a tailored
aerobic post-treatment was explored in this study. Integrated anaerobic-aerobic treatments have been often proposed for a high rate, cost effective and sustainable
disposal of agroindustrial effluents [17-22]. However, a
little is known [13,23] about the feasibility of this
approach in the management of OMWs. In the present
study, a SB-packed bed biofilter was selected to post-treat
digested OMW as the same technology was recently found
to be very effective in the final decontamination of a similar anaerobically digested wastewater [23]. However, differently from this previous work, where it was inoculated
with a defined co-culture of specialised bacteria and
applied in discontinuous mode [23], SB-biofilm reactor
was here hydraulically connected to the OMW digestor
and allowed to be colonized by the influent native microflora able to grow on the SB surface under the aerobic conditions provided. To the very best of our knowledge, this
is the first integrated anaerobic-aerobic biofilm system

developed so far for an improved, continuous biomethanization and decontamination of OMWs.
The integrated biofilter system was assessed through a 2
month experiment performed under open mode of operation by feeding it with a high and constant AOMW
organic loading rates. It was found to remove about 59
and 76% of COD and phenol loading rates, respectively.
The aerobic post-treatment contributed for about 1/4 of
such removal efficiency, and these performances were
comparable to those displayed on a similar anaerobically
digested effluents by the aerobic conventional activated
sludge post-treatment developed by Beccari et al. [13] and
lower than those observed by Bertin et al. [8] with a similar aerobic SB-biofilm reactor. However, it has to be
pointed out that the latter two processes were operated at
lower COD and phenol loading rates and under batch
mode.
SB-reactor biofilm was found to consist of Rhodobacterales,
Bacteroidales, Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales, Rhodocy-

clales and genera incertae sedis TM7. T-RFLP analysis and
16S rRNA gene cloning indicated that Paracoccus and
uncultured strain B25 were the major groups occurring at
different depths of the biofilter. Strain B25, an anaerobic
bacterium of the Bacteroides group, was one of the major
strains colonizing the GAC anaerobic digestor [8], whose
effluents were used to feed the SB-aerobic biofilter.
Instead, other members of the same group occurring in
the anaerobic GAC biofilm digestor (i.e., uncultured bacteria B23 and B24) [8], were not found in the SB-biofilter.
The presence of anaerobic Bacteroides in aerobic reactors
has been already reported in the literature. The occurrence
of these bacteria has been documented in conventional
aerobic reactors treating municipal wastewaters [24] or
anaerobically pre-treated tert-butyl alcohol-contaminated
wastewaters [25], as well as in packed-bed biofilm reactors
developed for the oxidization of sulfide-containing effluents [26]. Members of the Bacteroides group are often able
to degrade various refractory biomacromolecules, such as
cellulose, chitin, DNA, lipids, and proteins, which generally are abundant in a biofilm, in which dead microorganisms are trapped. These species are also known for their
ability to produce exopolysaccharide slime, that generally

has a primarily role in biofilm formation and development [27]. Thus, as suggested by Ferrera et al. [26], the
presence of Bacteroides strains in aerobic biofilm reactors
might be correlated to their role in the biofilm development and in the long-term functioning and versatility of
the process. The abundant occurrence of the Paracoccus sp.
T-RF clone C81 in the biofilm is also interesting because
Paracoccus is a quite biochemical versatile genus, able to
display a wide range of degradative capabilities. Some
Paracoccus strains are capable of aerobic denitrification
(simultaneous reduction of oxygen and nitrate) and heterotrophic nitrification (oxidation of ammonium to
nitrite during heterotrophic growth), whereas other
strains are capable of a) aerobic growth on formate, b)
aerobic chemolithoautotrophic growth using carbon
disulfide as energy sources, c) methylotrophic growth on
methanol or d) heterotrophic growth on diethyl sulfide,
thioethanol, thioacetic acid or substituted thiophenes.
Some other strains of this group can also grow anaerobically using thiosulfate, carbon disulfide, methanol or formate as energy sources and nitrate as final electron
acceptor [28]. The classification of the genus Paracoccus
(alpha subgroup of the Proteobacteria) has undergone seri-

ous changes during the past decade [29]. Several new species have been isolated and, currently, the genus consists
of 17 species, which can be found in different environments, including soil [30], contaminated groundwater
[31], biofilters [32], sewage sludge [33], denitryfing reactors [34] and industrial wastewaters [35]. Bacteria belonging to the genus Paracoccus are important components of
many wastewater treatment system communities [36].
Most species in the genus can use nitrate and its reduction
products as an alternative electron acceptor to oxygen during anaerobic respiratory growth [37,38], and, therefore,
can survive and proliferate in ecosystems with fluctuating
aerobic/anaerobic conditions. In our study, 16S rDNA
sequences belonging to Paracoccus populations (T-RF 81
bp) were not detectable in the AOMW that entered the
integrated process and in the SB-reactor influent. (Table
2). These bacteria were therefore massively enriched in the
aerobic biofilm throughout the treatment to become the
dominant eubacterial group. This finding might be
ascribed to the ability of some Paracoccus species to denitrify in the presence of oxygen up to levels of 90% of air
saturation [39,40], ability that might allow the same
strains to use both oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron
acceptors [39] and therefore to have nutritional advantages that, in turn, might have allowed them to extensively
colonize the reactor system developed in this study
exposed to varying oxygen concentrations. The clonal
analysis of the 16S rRNA genes suggests that the microbial
consortia that inhabit the aerobic biofilter also included
minor members belonging to the uncultivated bacterial
division TM7 (Fig. 4, panel B). Candidate division TM7

has no cultivated representatives and has been exclusively
characterized by environmental sequence data. This division takes its name from the German peat bog from which
the first sequence was obtained [41], but additional TM7
sequences deposited by several other investigators have
demonstrated that members of this division are present in
extremely diverse environments, including soil, freshwater, seawater, hot springs, mouse feces, termite guts, activated sludges and in human subgingival plaque samples
[42-44]. In situ analysis revealed that members of the
uncultivated TM7 division are capable of surviving and
growing under a wide range of conditions. Ouverney et al.
[45] suggested that TM7 members may be involved in the
formation of a scaffold or biofilm, which could support
the development of a disease-associated microbial community in human plaque. Thus, the evidence that TM7like 16S rDNA could be amplified from the samples taken
at different regions of the reactor let to speculate that TM7related bacteria have had a role in the SB-biofilm formation. Unfortunately, the current limited knowledge on
this uncultivated bacterial division does not allow us to
speculate on the contribution that TM7 bacteria might
have had on the aerobic decontamination of the anaerobic digested AOMW.
Other bacteria occurring in the biofilm consortia consisted of phylotypes affiliated with Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter genera, which are common
members of aerobic microbial consortia involved in the
biodegradation of biogenic and xenobiotic compounds
[46-48]. These members of Pseudomonadales and Enterobacteriales were not detected in the effluents of the anaerobic digestor and therefore enriched in the reactor
throughout the 2 months-experiment. This suggests that
they were significantly involved in removing organic compounds occurring in the anaerobically digested influent of
the SB-aerobic reactor.

Conclusion
In conclusion, an effective aerobic biofilm technology
able to significantly decontaminate anaerobically digested
OMWs was developed, integrated with the anaerobic
digestor and assessed in this study. To the very best of our
knowledge, this is the first report in which a similar biofilm process is proposed for such a purpose and assessed
through an integrated chemical and molecular biotechnology monitoring.

beads (diameter: 5 mm) (SB) were supplied by Manville
Filtration and Minerals (Denver, CO, USA).
An industrial OMW containing about 30 g/l of COD and
2.0 g/l of total phenols was collected from an Italian olive
oil producing plant, stored in filled and sealed plastic jars
at 4°C and employed to prepare an amended OMW,
AOMW, that was then used in the study. AOMW was prepared from the industrial OMW by a) diluting the latter
with an equal volume of tap water, b) amending the
obtained wastewater with Ca(OH)2 (up to have its pH
equal to 6.5), urea (0.45 g/l) and then 1 N NaOH (to
adjust its pH to 7.8 ± 0.2). AOMW was placed in 4 l glass
jars, where it was vigorously mixed (through a magnetic
stirrer) and purged with 0.22 µm filter (Millipore, MO,
USA)-sterilized O2-free N2 at room temperature for 3 h,
before being employed in the experiments. AOMW COD
and total phenol concentration were about 15 and 0.8 g/
l, respectively.
Bioreactors, their inoculation, working conditions and
sampling
The bioreactor system employed in the study was composed by a GAC-packed bed anaerobic biofilm reactor
hydraulically connected to an aerobic SB-packed bed biofilm reactor. AOMWs were continuously introduced in the
first reactor and allowed to undergo sequential anaerobic
biomethanisation and aerobic decontamination (Fig. 1).

Configuration, development procedure and working conditions of the GAC-anaerobic biofilter are reported in Bertin et al. [8], where this innovative bioreactor system has
been described in detail. In brief, it was a 2.400 l, hermetically closed and thermostated glass column reactor
equipped with a recycle line, an AOMW inlet line at the
bottom and an outlet line (for treated wastewater and produced biogas) departing from the top and reaching a
closed reservoir hydraulically connected to a 4 l "Mariotte" bottle. After its packing with GAC (its working volume became 1.032 l) it was inoculated with the
anaerobic, OMW-digesting microbial consortium developed by Beccari et al. [12,13] and then employed under
strictly anaerobic conditions for 9 months of experiments
(see Bertin et al. [8] for more details). Biofilm occurring in
the reactor at the end of the study was composed by Proteobacteria, bacteria of the Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides
group, sulfate-reducing bacteria, low G+C gram-positive
bacteria and, in a minor extent, Methanobacterium formicicum [8].
The aerobic reactor consisted of a 0.7 l glass column reactor with an external jacket in which water at 30°C was
continuously recycled (Fig. 1). The inlet line and the line
for supplying 0.22 µm filter-sterilized air were at the bottom of the column, whereas the outlet lines for exhaust air

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/5/1/16

and treated wastewater were placed on a small reservoir
located at the top of the reactor. A recycle line continuously carried wastewater from such a reservoir to the bottom of the reactor. In the same reservoir, a probe for
dissolved oxygen (97–08 model, ATI-Orion, Boston, MA)
and a probe for pH (81–04 model, ATI-Orion, Boston,
MA) were also placed. The bioreactor system, sterilised by
recycling an aqueous ethanol solution (70 % v/v) containing HCl (1% v/v) for 2 days, was washed with sterile water
and then packed with 213 g (dry weight) of SB previously
sterilised in autoclave (110°C per 30 min). The developed
reactor was made aerobic by supplying sterile air at 60 ml/
min and then fed with the effluent of anaerobic digestor.
Considering the medium displacement due to the support
(0.330 l) and the supplied air (0.020 l), the actual reactor
working volume was 0.350 l. The reactor was allowed to
operate in batch mode at high recycling flow rate (upflow;
at 0.030 l/min) for 2 weeks to permit a preliminary native
biomass adhesion on SB surface. Then, it was forced to
operate under continuous mode, and this by feeding it
with the anaerobic digested wastewater at the same rate at
which it was produced by the anaerobic digestor.
The sequential anaerobic-aerobic biofilter system was fed
with AOMW at a high and constant organic load (calculated by multiplying COD or total phenol content of the
influent by the dilution rate at which each reactor operated) for a 2-month period (Table 1). In particular, the
anaerobic GAC-digestor was fed at a dilution rate (D,
expressed as the ratio between wastewater influent flow
rate and the reactor reaction volume) of 2.077 day-1 with
COD and total phenol loading rates of about 31.74 and
1.70 gl-1day-1, respectively. Given the AOMW decontamination efficiency achieved in the anaerobic digestor, such
operative conditions imposed to the aerobic biofilter to
operate at a D of 6.171 day-1 and with COD and total phenol loading rates of 50.42 and 2.04 gl-1day-1, respectively
(Table 1). The recycle flow rate of each reactor was set up
as a function of D to have a recycle ratio (defined as the
ratio of the returned flow rate to the influent flow rate) of
77 for both reactors.
Six ml samples of wastewater were taken daily through
sampling ports placed along the inlet line of the integrated reactor system, the inlet and outlet lines of the aerobic reactor (Fig. 1). The collected samples were filtered
on 0.22 µm cellulose-nitrate filters (Millipore, MO, USA)
and then analysed for COD, the concentration of total
phenols and that of volatile fatty acids as detailed in previous papers [7,8]. An aliquot of each sample was also
analysed for low molecular weight phenols and aromatic
compounds by HPLC [23]. At the end of the 2 monthexperiment, the aerobic reactor was opened and triplicate
3 g-samples of SB carrier were collected at 5, 20 and 38 cm
of height (from the bottom) of the reactor packed-bed

and subjected to gravimetric measurements of immobilized biomass. To this aim, the carriers were gently washed
with distilled water, dried at 105°C for 16 h, weighted and
then suspended in a 1 M NaOH solution at 90°C for 20
min to induce the releasing of the attached biomass.
Again, the biomass free carriers were washed with distilled
water, dried at 105°C for 16 h and weighted. The biomass
weight was calculated as the weight difference of the dried
carrier before and after the NaOH treatment. A second set
of SB samples (of about 20 g each) collected from the
same regions of the reactor were washed and subjected to
DNA extraction as described below.
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from the biofilm, influent and effluent
samples by using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Italy) as
described previously [8]. The amount and quality of
nucleic acids were checked by electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gel.
16S rRNA amplification and T-RFLP analysis
16S rRNA genes from the extracted DNA samples were
amplified with universal eubacterial primers 63F and
1389R [49]. The primer 63F was labeled with 6-FAM (5[6]-carboxy-fluorescein) on the 5'-end (Applied Biosystems, Italy). Fluorescently labeled PCR products (100 ng)
were digested with 10 U of restriction enzyme (Invitrogen,
Italy) at 37°C for at least 4 h. T-RFLP profiles were generated using the restriction enzyme RsaI. Additional profiles
were generated using the restriction enzyme HhaI in order
to confirm results obtained with RsaI, and to assist in the
assignment of tentative phylogenetic affiliations to T-RFs.
The digested samples were run on an ABI Prism 310
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) operating in a
GeneScan mode with filter set D and the sizes of fragments were compared with internal standards. Replicate
T-RF profiles gave reproducible fingerprints.
DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Partial clone libraries of 16S rRNA genes were generated
from community samples. Unlabeled PCR products, purified as described above, were cloned using the pGEM-T
easy vector system (Promega) and Escherichia coli JM109
according to the manufacturer's instructions. From each
library randomly selected clones were screened for positive inserts and by T-RF analysis using RsaI and HhaI
restriction enzymes for digestion. Thirtyfour clones from
the bacterial libraries were subjected to cycle sequencing
using the M13 primers and the BigDye terminator cycle
sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). The
DNA sequences were bi-directionally resolved on an ABI
Prism 310 in a sequencing mode. Nucleotide sequences
were checked for potential chimeric sequences using the
CHIMERA-CHECK software, and compared with the
sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) data-

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/5/1/16

base to identify the closest relatives. The phylogenetic
analysis was carried out according to the maximum likelihood method and neighbor-joining topology using the
appropriate tools of the RDP program package. Bootstrapping using 1000 replicates was performed to test reliability of the branches of the trees.
