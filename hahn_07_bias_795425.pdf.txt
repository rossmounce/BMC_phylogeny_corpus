Abstract

Conclusion: Based on the results presented, it is likely that most tree reconciliation analyses show
biases, unless the gene trees used are exceptionally well-resolved and well-supported. These
results cast doubt upon previous conclusions that vertebrate genome history has been marked by
many ancient duplications and many recent gene losses.

importance of gene loss has only recently attracted attention
[7,8].
Though there exist many widely used methods for studying
the evolution of nucleotide substitutions, the study of gene
gain and loss presents many more challenges. These challenges exist in both data collection (for example, accurate
assembly of whole-genome shotgun sequencing) and data
analysis (for example, accurate estimation of duplication
times). Fortunately, a number of complementary methods
have arisen to enable researchers to accurately study gene
gain and loss at a genome-wide level. The most commonly

information

Comparative genome sequencing of many closely related
organisms has revealed remarkable similarities in the total
number of genes among taxa. However, this similarity in total
number masks numerous changes in the underlying identity
of the genes in each species (for example, [1-4]). Differences
in the identities of constituent proteins arise because genes
are gained and lost throughout evolution: gains occur
through the duplication of whole genomes or individual
genes, and losses occur via the deletion or pseudogenization
of previously functional genes. The importance of gene duplication has been appreciated for a long time [5,6], while the

refereed research

Results: I show that tree reconciliation methods are biased when the inferred gene tree is not
correct. This bias places duplicates towards the root of the tree and losses towards the tips of the
tree. I demonstrate that this bias is present when tree reconciliation is conducted on both multiple
mammal and Drosophila genomes, and that lower bootstrap cut-off values on gene trees lead to
more extreme bias. I also suggest a method for dealing with reconciliation bias, although this
method only corrects for the number of gene gains on some branches of the species tree.

deposited research

Background: Comparative genomic studies are revealing frequent gains and losses of whole genes
via duplication and pseudogenization. One commonly used method for inferring the number and
timing of gene gains and losses reconciles the gene tree for each gene family with the species tree
of the taxa considered. Recent studies using this approach have found a large number of ancient
duplications and recent losses among vertebrate genomes.

used methods compare the species tree that describes the
relationships among taxa to the gene tree inferred from the
sequences of the gene family being studied [9-14]. By reconciling the gene tree with the species tree, both gene gains and
losses can be inferred and mapped onto the species tree. This
method has been applied to many individual gene trees (for
example, [15]), and is only now finding wider usage in whole
genome analyses (for example, [16]).
A major problem with the gene tree/species tree reconciliation method is that it assumes that both trees are free from
error [9]. While thousands of orthologous genes can be used
to construct the species tree - with commensurately increased
confidence in any topology - each individual gene tree can
only be inferred from the gene family it represents. For this
reason, some methods for carrying out the reconciliation
explicitly take into account the support at every node, usually
via bootstrap values (for example, [13,14]). Nodes with little
support are collapsed, which prevents the non-parsimonious
addition of both duplications and deletions. However,
because of the limited number of characters used to build
each gene tree and the vagaries of reconstruction methods,
there may be incorrectly inferred topologies even with 100%
bootstrap support (for example, [17,18]).
In this paper I describe a consistent bias in such tree reconciliation methods. This bias leads to an overestimation in the
number of duplicates placed near the root of the species tree,
and an overestimation of the number of losses across the tree.
The bias increases when topologies with weaker support are
allowed, though it appears to exist even when poorly supported topologies are taken into account. Finally, I show how
this bias has led to incorrect inferences regarding the nature
of vertebrate genome evolution, but how careful analysis of
the data can still allow some conclusions to be made.

Tree reconciliation bias
Tree reconciliation proceeds by adding the minimum number
of gains and losses to the species tree to make it consistent
with the gene tree. Figure 1 gives two examples of such reconciliations, explicitly showing the inferred history of gain and
loss and how these are then mapped onto the species tree. If
both the species tree and the gene tree are correct, then the
various reconciliation algorithms in use should all recover the
correct history of duplication and loss, albeit with varying
computational efficiency [11]. These methods also assume
that there are no missing data, a problem that could result in
incorrectly inferred gene losses [14].
If one of the trees is not correct (I assume in the following that
this will usually be the gene tree), then additional gains and
losses are added to the species tree in order to completely reconcile the two trees. Figure 2a gives an example of an incorrectly inferred gene tree, one that simply has the branching
order of two of the homologous genes switched (lineages B
and C). In order to reconcile this gene tree with the species
tree, a single duplication must be placed above the point at
which the affected lineages split and three separate gene
losses must occur on the terminal lineages (Figure 2a). When
tree reconciliation methods are conducted taking into
account bootstrap (or other) support for each node, incorrectly inferred topologies may be collapsed back to the
branching order in the species tree. This has the effect of minimizing the number of proposed gains and losses of genes.
Figure 2b shows the same example as in Figure 2a, but relatively low bootstrap support (65%) has been given to the node
that will cause the extra duplication and deletions. In this
case, any bootstrap cut-off used that is above 65% will result
in the collapse of this node, and no duplications or losses
would be inferred.

interactions

A further possibility to account for reconciliation bias on noninformative branches is to iteratively remove descendant
branches from the gene trees to be reconciled. Because incorrect duplications are placed on these branches only when
there are genes from three or more descendant branches,
pruning the trees so that only two or fewer lineages are represented may allow for more accurate reconstruction of the
number of duplicates on these branches. This method then
essentially turns 'non-informative' branches into 'informative' branches by reducing the possibility that gene trees are
incorrect. Further work will need to be done as to how exactly
such pruning is implemented.

refereed research

Errors in gene tree reconstruction result in two consistent
biases in tree reconciliation: more duplications must be
assigned to branches further up the tree, towards the root;
and more losses must be assigned to branches below these
duplications. As shown in Figure 2a, topological disagreements between the species tree and gene tree always result in
the placement of duplications above the branches that are
inconsistent between the two trees; this is the only way to reconcile the differences. As a result of the duplications added to
the tree, multiple losses must also be added, always on lineages further toward the tips. This bias results in an inferred
history of many older gene gains and many recent gene losses.

The effect of this bias means that terminal lineages and many
of the lineages leading to them will not be incorrectly assigned
duplications. Terminal lineages ('tips') and lineages giving
rise to only two terminal lineages ('doublets'; for example, the
branch leading to [A, B] in the example species tree) will not
have duplications added to them erroneously, no matter how
inconsistent the gene tree and species tree are with each
other. Therefore, information about the number of gene
duplicates inferred on these branches should be accurate. I
consequently define these branches of the species tree as
'informative,' and use them in further comparisons below.

deposited research

be assigned to branches with more than two descendant lineages. This effect occurs because sub-topologies of a larger tree
involving two or fewer lineages cannot be incorrectly inferred
(for example, the topology [A, B] is the same as [B, A]). Inconsistencies between the gene and species tree must be due to
the mis-ordering of three or more branches (for example, the
topology [A, B]C] is not the same as [A, C]B]). Tree reconciliation can only proceed by adding duplications to lineages preceding mis-ordered branches (Figure 2a), and, therefore, can
only be added to lineages with three or more descendants.

reports

As discussed above, the small number of characters used to
build a given gene tree means that many trees may be
incorrectly inferred. Even with relatively long sequences, the
requirement that trees are found for every family in a genome
in reasonable time means that approximate methods, such as
neighbor-joining [19] must be used. If bootstrap support at
every node is needed, likelihood-based methods for inferring
gene trees become computationally prohibitive even for a
small number of trees. It is also recognized that high bootstrap support can be dependent on the exact phylogenetic
method and model of sequence evolution used [17,18,20-22].
Furthermore, short inter-node distances can result in individual gene trees that are different from the species tree because
of incomplete lineage-sorting, and not because of any errors
in tree reconstruction methods [23-25]. For all of these reasons, it appears likely that many of the gene trees in whole
genome studies will have been incorrectly inferred, or will
have artificially high bootstrap support for incorrect topologies. Additionally, some of the most widely used methods for
conducting reconciliation do not make it possible to consider
the support for topologies [10,11], so that no allowance can be
made for incorrect topologies.

and 50%. My prediction is that the number of duplications on
non-informative branches should increase as the bootstrap
cut-off decreases. This is because more topologies with lower
support (which are likely to be incorrect topologies) are
included with lower cut-offs. There should be no directional
effect on the number of duplications inferred on informative
branches. In addition, the number of losses should increase
across all branches as the bootstrap cut-off decreases.

no losses can be inferred on this branch - all branches of the
species tree descend from lineages that could contain false
duplications. This means that the number of gene losses will
be over-estimated for all branches of the tree, and will
increase in number towards the tips.

Molecular evidence for reconciliation bias
In order to provide an example of the bias described here, I
conducted tree reconciliation for 9,920 gene trees from 6
mammalian genomes and 11,388 gene trees from 12 Drosophila genomes (Materials and methods). To show the effect
that increasing errors have on the number of inferred gains
and losses, I carried out the reconciliations with six different
values for the bootstrap cut-off: 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%,

Figure 3 shows the mammalian species tree and Figure 4a the
number of gains and losses inferred across the tree at varying
bootstrap cut-offs. This tree contains three non-informative
branches (indicated by arrows) and eight informative
branches. The number of duplications on non-informative
branches does in fact increase with decreasing bootstrap cutoffs; this trend is strongly significant (Table 1). Summing
across all non-informative branches, we would infer 14,966
duplications with a 100% bootstrap cut-off, but 22,031 with a
50% cut-off. Also as predicted, the number of losses on all
branches increases with decreasing cut-offs: the total number
increases from 25,092 to 47,074 as one goes from a 100% to a
50% bootstrap cut-off. On average, a 10% decrease in the
bootstrap cut-off used results in a 16% increase in the number
of inferred losses on any given branch and an 8% increase in
the number of inferred gains on non-informative branches.
The same trends are found for the Drosophila tree, with significant increases in duplication and loss resulting from
decreasing support for tree topologies (Figure 4b and Table
1).
One surprising result is that there appears to be a slight but
significant correlation between the number of gains on
informative branches and the bootstrap cut-off used - the
number of duplications increases with increasing bootstrap
cut-off values. This trend is the opposite of the one predicted

mammals and Drosophila (Figure 5 and Table 1). In comparison to the effect bootstrap cut-off values have on noninformative branches, the consequence of this pattern is
much smaller. The total number of inferred duplications on

The apparent cause of this slight bias is shown in Figure 6. As
the bootstrap cut-off is increased, even relatively well-supported topologies will be collapsed. The aim of collapsing
nodes is to minimize the total number of gains and losses that
must be invoked to explain the history of any given gene tree.

Slight bias towards placing duplicates on the tips of the tree
Slight bias towards placing duplicates on the tips of the tree. (a) Shows how gains and losses would be inferred for the gene tree shown. (b) Taking into
account bootstrap support can result in placing duplicates towards the tips as gene tree topologies are collapsed.

The minimum number of changes can be achieved by pushing
all duplicates towards the tips of the tree, as no further losses
can be added. The addition of duplicates to non-informative
branches always results in an equal or greater number of
losses on descendant lineages, and, therefore, a greatly
increasing total number of changes. This slight bias has consequences for methods that attempt to choose the 'true' gene
tree by minimizing gains and losses (for example, [26,27]):
placing duplicates towards the tips of the tree will often be
favored. The pattern shown in Figure 6 may also be caused by
missing data, such that the gene that has been 'lost' (one of the
B genes) results in an inferred duplication.
The above explanation for the positive relationship between
bootstrap cut-offs and number of duplications predicts that
the increase seen on informative branches should be found
predominantly on tip branches; placing duplications on the
few informative branches that lead to two descendant lineages does not minimize the total number of changes. In fact,
this is exactly what is observed in both mammals and Drosophila. As shown in Table 1, there is no significant
correlation between the number of gains and bootstrap cutoff for doublet branches in Drosophila (r = -0.12, P = 0.83),
and only a marginally significant relationship in mammals,
but in the opposite direction from the relationships found
earlier (r = -0.82, P = 0.045). The correlation on just tip
branches remains strong and highly significant (mammals: r
= 0.99, P = 0.0001; Drosophila: r = 0.97, P = 0.001).

Independent estimation of gene gain and loss
As a further check on the accuracy of the number of estimated
gene duplicates on informative branches, I estimated the
number of gene duplicates and gene losses using an unrelated
likelihood method [3]. This method does not use gene trees,
and is therefore expected to provide independent support for
the inferred number of duplications on informative branches.
Briefly, the method infers gains and losses only from the
number of copies of genes present in each of the species
included, and does not consider the relationships among the
constituent genes. I do not expect there to be any similarity

between the numbers of losses estimated by the two methods,
on any branches of the species tree.
Figure 7 shows the correlation in the number of duplications
inferred across informative branches by the two methods for
both mammals and Drosophila. There are highly significant
correlations in both: r = 0.95 (P = 0.0003) for mammals and
r = 0.89, (P < 0.00001) for Drosophila. This provides evidence for the accuracy of tree reconciliation methods when
considering only the number of genes gained on informative
branches (those with two or fewer descendants). Duplications
on these branches should be correctly inferred by all methods.
Including non-informative branches, however, the correlation in number of gene duplications inferred between methods is no longer significant (mammals: r = 0.25, P = 0.48;
Drosophila: r = -0.18, P = 0.43). As an example of the disconnect between the two methods when applied to non-informative branches, the likelihood method infers 15 gene
duplications on the short (approximately 4 million year)
branch leading to the 4 non-canine mammals; tree reconciliation infers the gain of 2,774 genes on the same branch.
The number of gene losses also appears to be badly estimated
by tree reconciliation methods: correlation with likelihood
estimates is either non-significant (mammals: r = 0.52, P =
0.18) or mildly significant (Drosophila: r = 0.63, P = 0.01).
Even the mildly significant correlation observed for losses is
deceptive - the number of losses estimated by the reconciliation method is, on average, seven times as great as the
number estimated by likelihood. For example, on the lineage
leading to Drosophila melanogaster the likelihood method
infers the loss of 547 genes since the split with D. simulans
(approximately 5 million years ago [28]). The tree reconciliation method infers the loss of 3,461 genes.
On average, the number of duplicates on informative
branches inferred via tree reconciliation is 1.25 (Drosophila)
to 1.5 (mammals) times as high as the number inferred via the
likelihood method (Figure 7). The higher estimate using tree
reconciliation may have two causes: the slight bias towards

information

In a recent paper, Blomme et al. [16] used tree reconciliation
to infer the history of gene gain and loss among seven vertebrate species. Gene trees for 8,165 families were constructed
using neighbor-joining and reconciled with the known species tree using a 70% bootstrap cut-off [16]. Two of the con-

One further conclusion of the Blomme et al. study relates to
the association of a large number of inferred duplications
with multiple whole genome duplications (WGDs). It is not
immediately obvious that the precise placement of gene
duplications on the non-informative branches of the vertebrate tree should be affected by reconciliation bias, and,
therefore, that the timing of WGD events should be wrongly
inferred. There is no significant correlation between the
number of duplications inferred on a branch and the distance
from the tips, though there is a trend in that direction (Drosophila: r = 0.44, P = 0.39). This indicates that there does not
appear to be a bias (among non-informative branches) in
placing duplicates on the root branch, exactly where two
WGD events are inferred in vertebrate history.

interactions

The bias described here will affect all previous studies that
have used tree reconciliation methods. The effects of this bias
will be mitigated by using reconciliation methods that take
into account bootstrap support (for example, [13,14]) rather
than those that do not [10,11]; the effects will be further minimized by using more accurate gene tree inference methods
(such as maximum likelihood) rather than fast and approximate methods (such as neighbor-joining). Finally, as the
vagaries of tree inference are strongly influenced by the particular information contained within the protein sequences of
the genes being considered, reconciliation of any particular
gene tree may or may not be affected by the bias described
here. However, when genome-scale analyses are conducted,
even the slight effects of reconciliation bias will be magnified
across the thousands of gene trees considered.

refereed research

Implications for vertebrate genome evolution

clusions of the paper were that "the majority of duplicated
genes in extant vertebrate genomes are ancient," and that "all
vertebrates continue to lose duplicates that were created at
much earlier times." Based on the biases in tree reconciliation
methods demonstrated here, it appears likely that the patterns observed by Blomme and colleagues are largely
artifactual. The same biases that tree reconciliation methods
show - spurious inferences of a large number of ancient duplications followed by an even larger number of recent losses are precisely the results of their analyses. Given the relatively
low bootstrap cut-offs used in the published analyses, one
would expect a reduction in both gains and losses with
increasing topological stringency.

placing duplicates on the tips of the tree with increasing
bootstrap cut-off stringency; or the tendency for the likelihood method to undercount the number of gains and losses
when both types of events occur in the same gene family on
the same branch of the phylogenetic tree [3]. However, the
discrepancy between the two methods remains the same on
informative branches even when using a bootstrap cut-off of
60%, suggesting that the more likely cause is underestimation
via the likelihood method.

plete lineage-sorting, then a large number of duplications
from many different gene trees will be placed on the branch
immediately preceding such an event. Incomplete lineagesorting is due to short inter-node distances, such that polymorphism in the ancestral population is not completely fixed
between speciation events. Incomplete lineage-sorting can
result in disagreements between gene trees and species trees,
even though none of the inferred gene trees is incorrect per se
[23,24]. These disagreements can extend to whole genome
analyses of single-copy orthologs, where no single gene tree is
found from the majority of orthologs considered (for example, [25]).
As there appears to be an instance of incomplete lineage-sorting among the Drosophila [25], I asked whether a large
number of duplications were placed on the branch preceding
the topological discordance (the branch marked with an
asterisk in Additional data file 1). As predicted, a large
number of duplications were inferred on this branch: 2,757 in
the best-supported topology, compared to 278 and 415 duplications on the non-informative branches above and below
this one. The number of duplications inferred on the branch
preceding the incomplete lineage-sorting was much higher in
the two alternative topologies as well (data not shown). These
analyses appear to show that short divergence times between
speciation events can lead to an excess of inferred duplication
events. One case in which incomplete lineage-sorting is common is during adaptive radiations - such radiations are notoriously hard to construct consistent species trees for [23].
This implies that tree reconciliation analyses will associate a
large number of duplication events with adaptive radiations.
Methods that allow for non-binary species trees (for example,
[14,29]) should be used in these cases so that a large number
of incorrect duplications are not inferred. Though it does not
seem that there has been an adaptive radiation at the origin of
the vertebrate species considered by Blomme et al. [16], caution should be used in inferring WGD events from the large
number of duplications placed on any particular branch by
tree reconciliation methods.

Conclusion

The sequencing of a large number of whole genomes has
made it possible to study patterns of gene gain and loss on an
enormous scale. Even though methods for inferring gain and
loss have been around for almost 30 years, only with the analysis of whole genomes has the effect of small biases become
clear. The net effect of the bias in tree reconciliation methods
demonstrated here is that the number of gene losses inferred
should not be taken at face value, and the number of duplications inferred should be parsed with care.
How might we overcome the bias in current reconciliation
methods? Algorithms that provide an estimate of statistical
support for each inferred gain or loss (for example, [12,30]) or
that take into account the length of species tree branches may

both offer improvements to current methods. This latter possibility offers a way to improve inferences because short species tree branches are the ones that are most likely to lead to
wrongly inferred gene trees, as is seen in the case of incomplete lineage sorting. It is also important to note that most of
the biases described here occur when there are equal numbers of genes among taxa - if there are unequal numbers of
genes, then duplications and losses can be inferred from presence/absence information. In this case the problem simply
reduces to one concerning the evolution of copy number,
which is exactly the approach of the likelihood method mentioned above. But this method is also not without its own
biases [3].
Finally, biases in tree reconciliation methods cast doubt on
previous work into the evolution of vertebrate genomes.
However, the results presented here cannot disprove previous results, as an excess of ancient duplicates and recent gene
losses were inferred even when using bootstrap cut-offs of
100%. Discovering the true pattern of vertebrate genome evolution will require simulation results, better gene trees, more
data, or some combination of all three.

Materials and methods
Gene family data
Mammalian gene families were taken from Ensembl version
41 [31] for human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), and dog (Canis familiaris). I
included only the longest isoform of each gene in the analysis.
The resulting dataset includes 119,746 genes in 9,990 gene
families across all six species. Drosophila gene family data are
from the 12-genomes consortium [32]. This dataset includes
149,097 genes in 11,521 gene families across the 12 species.
See Hahn, Han, and Han (in review) and Hahn, Demuth, and
Han (in review) for more details on both datasets.

Gene trees
Amino acid alignments for each mammalian gene family were
downloaded from Ensembl. Alignments for the Drosophila
proteins were made using MUSCLE [33]. Neighbor-joining
trees for both sets of families were generated in PHYLIP [34]
using JTT protein distances and 100 bootstrap runs. Gene
trees could be constructed for 9,920 of the 9,990 mammalian
gene families and 11,388 of 11,521 Drosophila gene families
(PHYLIP could not handle trees with more than about 250
genes). I reconciled the resulting gene trees with the appropriate species trees using the NOTUNG software package [13]
and varying the bootstrap cut-off parameter; equal weights
for gains and losses were used.

Likelihood analysis of gene families
Using the same 9,920 mammalian and 11,388 Drosophila
gene families, I used the CAFE software package [35] to estimate the number of gains on each branch of the species trees.

comment

The number of gains was calculated by comparing the size of
each family between the parent and daughter nodes for each
branch; larger daughter-node sizes imply the gain of genes.
Gains were then summed across all gene families for each
branch. The correlation shown in Figure 7 is with the number
of gains inferred using a 90% bootstrap cut-off for the gene
tree data. All statistics were calculated in JMP (SAS Institute,
Inc. Cary, NC, USA).
