Abstract
Background: Class III Homeodomain Leucine Zipper (HD-Zip III) proteins have been implicated in the regulation of
cambium identity, as well as primary and secondary vascular differentiation and patterning in herbaceous plants.
They have been proposed to regulate wood formation but relatively little evidence is available to validate such a
role. We characterised and compared HD-Zip III gene family in an angiosperm tree, Populus spp. (poplar), and the
gymnosperm Picea glauca (white spruce), representing two highly evolutionarily divergent groups.
Results: Full-length cDNA sequences were isolated from poplar and white spruce. Phylogenetic reconstruction
indicated that some of the gymnosperm sequences were derived from lineages that diverged earlier than
angiosperm sequences, and seem to have been lost in angiosperm lineages. Transcript accumulation profiles were
assessed by RT-qPCR on tissue panels from both species and in poplar trees in response to an inhibitor of polar
auxin transport. The overall transcript profiles HD-Zip III complexes in white spruce and poplar exhibited substantial
differences, reflecting their evolutionary history. Furthermore, two poplar sequences homologous to HD-Zip III
genes involved in xylem development in Arabidopsis and Zinnia were over-expressed in poplar plants. PtaHB1 overexpression produced noticeable effects on petiole and primary shoot fibre development, suggesting that PtaHB1 is
involved in primary xylem development. We also obtained evidence indicating that expression of PtaHB1 affected
the transcriptome by altering the accumulation of 48 distinct transcripts, many of which are predicted to be
involved in growth and cell wall synthesis. Most of them were down-regulated, as was the case for several of the
poplar HD-Zip III sequences. No visible physiological effect of over-expression was observed on PtaHB7 transgenic
trees, suggesting that PtaHB1 and PtaHB7 likely have distinct roles in tree development, which is in agreement with
the functions that have been assigned to close homologs in herbaceous plants.
Conclusions: This study provides an overview of HD-zip III genes related to woody plant development and
identifies sequences putatively involved in secondary vascular growth in angiosperms and in gymnosperms. These
gene sequences are candidate regulators of wood formation and could be a source of molecular markers for tree
breeding related to wood properties.

Background
The differentiation of vascular tissues is an intensively
studied aspect of plant development. Part of this interest
is driven by the economic importance of xylem as a
major constituent of forage crops, wood, and lignocellulosic biomass for transport fuels. Xylem is characterised

by highly specialised and easily identifiable water-conducting cell types, i.e. tracheids in gymnosperms and
tracheary elements (TEs) in angiosperms. Xylem also
contributes to the physical support of plant structures,
which is imparted by either fibres (in angiosperms) or
tracheids. Primary xylem arises through the differentiation of pro-vascular cells near the apical meristem and
secondary xylem differentiates from fusiform initials in
the cambial zone [1]. Environmental conditions and
developmental state modulate xylem composition and

properties [2], as well as cell characteristics [3], through
the action of growth regulators such as auxin, ethylene,
and gibberellins, together with regulatory proteins such
as transcription factors.
Insights into the regulatory components of xylem
development, including transcriptional regulators, have
been derived from functional analyses in the herbaceous
model plants Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., Zinnia
elegans (Jacq.), and Oryza sativa (L.) [4,5]. HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER CLASS III (HD-Zip III)
proteins represent a group of transcription factors that
have been extensively implicated in the regulation of
primary and secondary vascular tissue pattern formation,
as well as lateral organ and cambial polarity in herbaceous annual plants. It stands to reason that HD-Zip IIIs
may also play key roles in secondary vascular growth
and wood formation in perennials including shrubs and
trees, but there is relatively little evidence to elucidate
such a role, except for the report by Ko et al. (2006) [6].
There are several different classes of plant homeobox
genes [7]. One of the major groups of these genes is
HD-Zip, which is divided into classes I to IV. Both the
DNA-binding Homeodomain (HD) and the basic leucine
zipper domain (bZIP), the latter of which has protein
dimerization properties [8], are conserved in all four
classes. Members of the HD-Zip III and IV classes also
share a steroidogenic, acute regulatory protein-related
domain associated with the lipid-Transfer (START)
domain [9]. In addition, class III HD-Zips have a characteristic C-terminal MEKHLA domain that shares significant similarity with the PAS domain, reported to
dimerize with the AP2 domain of the transcription factor DRN/ESR-1 [10] involved in embryo patterning and
auxin transport [11].
Five different HD-Zip III proteins have been functionally characterised by different approaches in A. thaliana.
They include Revoluta (REV/IFL-1/AVB-1), Phabulosa
(phb/AtHB-14), Phavoluta (phv/AthHB-9), Corona (cna/
AtHB-15) and AtHB-8. Arabidopsis REVOLUTA (rev)
mutants have altered interfascicular fibre development
and impaired auxin polar transport [12,13]. Overexpression of REV in Arabidopsis resulted in weakly
radialized vascular bundles, and altered leaf, stem and
carpel organ abaxial, adaxial pattern polarity. Overexpression of the Z. elegans ZeHB-12, a homologue of
REV, led to an increased number of xylem precursor
cells and the accumulation of a variety of transcripts,
including brassinosteroid-related sequences and vascular
preferential transcripts in Zinnia [14]. Analyses of double phb:phv mutants showed that the two genes share
redundant functions both in establishing organ polarity
and in vascular development [15]. In Arabidopsis,
AtHB-8 is an early marker for procambial development,
vein patterning, and differentiation [16]. Its over-

Page 2 of 17

expression caused ectopic proliferation of xylem cells
and precocious initiation of secondary growth; however,
the Athb-8 loss-of-function mutant had no obvious vascular phenotype [17]. In contrast, cna mutants and antisense plants have increased vascular tissues and defects
in organ polarity [18], while CNA over-expression leads
to smaller vascular bundles, indicating that it likely acts
as a negative regulator of procambial cell identity or
proliferation. Transcript accumulation in a few HD-Zip
III sequences is regulated by auxin (specifically AtHB-8)
[16] and brassinosteroids [12]. Post-transcriptional gene
silencing by microRNAs is highly conserved in plants
and specifically targets all of the HD-Zip III genes
through the binding of mir165/166 [19].
Functional analyses of HD-Zip III genes in herbaceous
plants, including A. thaliana and Z. elegans, have provided a useful template against which similar functions
regulating secondary vascular growth can be investigated
in woody plants (shrubs, trees) [20]. As genetic selection
and breeding activities in trees are being expanded to
include genetic mapping and molecular markers, candidate genes like HD-Zip III are considered as potential
markers which could be associated with wood properties. In this context, the aim of this study was to characterise the HD-Zip III transcription factor family and
assess potential involvement in vascular development of
trees. Previous reports [21,22] have provided indications
that the number of HD-Zip III genes and gene family
structure may vary between species, especially between
angiosperms and gymnosperms. We evaluated and compared gene family structure in poplars (Populus spp.)
and white spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss with that
described for herbaceous annuals to clarify the evolutionary status of HD-zip III in these groups. Transcript
profiles were examined across several tissues to assess
their putative involvement in secondary vascular growth.
In poplar, the accumulation of HD-Zip III gene transcripts was specifically examined in differentiating secondary xylem (2X) in relation to auxin transport, a key
driver of tracheary element differentiation [23]. The
putative roles of poplar genes PtaHB1 and PtaHB7from
to distinct well characterised subclades with contrasted
functions in crops were examined with respect to overexpression effects upon vascular differentiation and
RNA transcript profiles.

denoted PaHB1 and PaHB2 [24]. Therefore, we designated the sequences that we isolated as PgHB3 [25] to
PgHB6 (Additional file 1 Figure 1 HQ391914 to
HQ391917). Predicted amino-acid sequences display the
structural features of HD-Zip III, except that PgHB6 has
a partially degenerated leucine zipper motif.

The Populus trichocarpa genome sequence [26] was
reported to contain eight different HD-Zip III
sequences, which are designated HB1 to HB8 [6]. HDZip III genes are distributed on seven of the nineteen
poplar chromosomes (Additional file 1). We isolated
full-length coding cDNA sequences for eight on the

putative poplar HD-Zip III genes by RT-PCR, amplification, starting from the P. trichocarpa (Torr. & Gray) ×
P. deltoides (W. Bartram) hybrid clone H11-11 and from
the P. tremula Minch × P. alba L. clone 717-1B4. For
each of the eight cDNA clones, nearly perfect sequence
identities were used to match the cDNA sequences with
previously identified ESTs and genes predicted from the
poplar genome [6], thus providing evidence that all of
the predicted genes are expressed in Populus spp.
There are five HD-Zip III genes in the Arabidopsis
genome belonging to the two major phylogenetic clades
RVB and C8, each of which is divided into two subclades [27]. Floyd et al. (2006) [21] and Prigge and
Clark (2006) [22] conducted phylogenetic investigations
that included HD-zip III sequences from diverse plants,
along with full-length and partial Pinus taeda L. cDNA
sequences. They concluded that conifer HD-Zip III
genes could be assigned to the two major angiosperm
clades of C8 and RVB, but two of the conifer sequences
were likely part of gymnosperm-specific clades. In this
report, a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree [28] was constructed with complete amino acid sequences from several seed plants, including gymnosperms such as P.
glauca and P. taeda, and angiosperms such as A. thaliana and P. trichocarpa, as well as lower plants such as
the moss Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) Bruch &
Schimp. The resulting tree topology was consistent with
previous reports; however, our data suggest that conifer
sequences may in fact be uniquely represented in the
C8 clade and absent in the RVB clade (Figure 1). The
conifers that we analysed may thus have three C8 members, including sequences previously assigned to the
RVB clade. The full-length P. glauca PgHB6 and the
partial P. taeda PtaHD-34 and PtaHD-35 fell outside
angiosperm clades and formed a monophyletic group,
consistent with previous reports [21,22]. Sequence similarity and tree topology clearly grouped the Populus
sequences as four pairs of closely related paralogues,
which is consistent with the ancestral salicoid genomewide duplication and reorganisation described in modern Salicaceae [29].
HD-zip III transcripts accumulate during secondary
vascular growth in Picea and Populus

Transcript accumulation was profiled in young P. glauca
and P. trichocarpa × deltoïdes trees (refered as PtdHB)
grown under controlled conditions by using RT-qPCR
to compare steady mRNA levels in several organs and
tissues (Figure 2). Transcripts of the four spruce
sequences accumulated preferentially in the differentiating secondary xylem of stems (2X) and roots (R2X) and
gave similar profiles overall (Figure 2A). PgHB3, PgHB4
and PgHB5 RNAs were also abundant in the differentiating secondary phloem (2P), and PgHB5 had the highest

Page 4 of 17

relative abundance in the young foliage (YL) (Figure
2A). The data suggested that the different transcripts
differ substantially in abundance since the normalised
number of RNA molecules varied by two orders of magnitude between the highest and lowest RNAs, i.e.,
PgHB3 and PgHB6, respectively. The aforementioned
data are consistent with putative roles in vascular differentiation, with little indication of diversification between
the gene sequences.
Compared with spruce, poplar HD-Zip III genes gave
more diversified transcript accumulation profiles across
the panel of organs and tissues, even within pairs of closely related paralogues (Figure 2B). The pair PtdHB1
and PtdHB2, which are close homologues of REVOLUTA, gave relatively similar profiles across the panel,
except that PtdHB1 was less abundant in mature and
old leaves than in developing tissues. Furthermore,
PtdHB1 transcript abundance was two orders of magnitude higher than PtdHB2. The pair PtdHB5 and
PtdHB6, closest homologues of Corona/AtHB-15, shared
similar transcript profiles which varied strongly between
the organs surveyed. Both were clearly most abundant
in the developing secondary xylem (2X), but also accumulated in the apex and primary stem. On average,
PtdHB5 was five to ten times more abundant than
PtdHB6. The pair PtdHB7 and PtdHB8, which are the
closest homologues of AtHB-8, gave dissimilar and even
opposite transcript profiles. PtdHB7 transcripts were
abundant in nearly all organs and lowest in the apex (A)
and developing secondary xylem (2X), whereas PtdHB8
transcripts were most abundant in these same tissues
(A, 2X). Transcripts of PtdHB3, which was a close
homologue of PHV and PHB, largely accumulated in the
apex and to a much lower degree than in other parts of
the trees, especially the roots. Data are not reported for
PtdHB4 because its amplification by RT-qPCR was not
strong enough for reliable determinations.
Over-expression of wild-type PtaHB1 and PtaHB7 genes
in transgenic poplars

Transgenic poplar trees that overexpressed the complete
coding sequence of PtaHB1 and PtaHB7 were obtained
to investigate the potential roles of these HD-Zip III
genes in tree development. The hybrid poplar clone
INRA-717-1B4 (P. tremula × P. alba) was transformed
using Agrobacterium with either one of the PtaHB constructs or an empty vector control (WT). Several hygromycin-resistant and GUS-positive lines were recovered
and used to produce viable plants grown to an average
height of 1.20 m in the greenhouse. All of the lines had
transgene transcript accumulation levels which were significantly above levels detected for the INRA-717 endogene (Table 1). Interestingly, all of the lines
overexpressing PtaHB1 (UBI::PtaHB1) had a visible

external phenotype that was not seen in the controls
(Figure 3), but no phenotype was observed upon overexpression of PtaHB7 (data not show).
Further characterisation of the PtaHB1 transformed
trees showed that PtaHB1 transgene transcripts were
five to eight times more abundant than the PtaHB1
endogene in the controls. The most obvious phenotype
in these trees was their drooping leaves. The trees
appeared to have a water-stress phenotype (Figure 3A)
which was clearly not the case given that they were
grown alongside perfectly healthy control trees. Upon
closer inspection, it was evident that PtaHB1 overexpression resulted in altered petiole development, causing the leaves to hang downward. Other than the
petiole, the leaves seemed to develop normally and to be

perfectly healthy, with no indications of altered water
relations. On average, the transgenic poplars had
petioles that were 15% shorter, and the angle between
the adaxial side of the leaf and the stem was 30% wider
than those of control trees (Figure 3B). The increased
angle and decreased length were statistically significant
starting at the 10th internode from the apex (where the
first internode is the first leaf longer than 1 cm) (p <
0.05) (Figure 3C, D).
The vascular organisation of petioles from mature
leaves was examined to further investigate the altered
development. Cell wall autofluorescence associated with
lignin accumulation was observed in transverse sections
under UV-illumination, and clearly indicated that the
distribution of fibres and vessels was altered in the

lignified cells; Figure 4) to vascular elements (large lignified cells) was 0.80 in the transgenic trees, compared to
1.55 in the controls (p < 0.001).
Furthermore, quantitative determinations of fibre
lengths in stems and petioles through FQA (Fiber Quantitative Analyser, Methods) showed that petiole fibres
from immature (LPI 6) and mature leaves (LPI 21 and
LPI 43) were slightly, but significantly shorter in the
transgenic trees (p < 0.05, Figure 4D). Shorter fibre
classes < 0.5 mm were over-represented in the transgenic trees, whereas longer fibre classes (from 0.75 to 1,
from 2.0 mm and up) were significantly under-represented compared to the control trees (p < 0.05, Figure
4C). The fibre length classes from primary stems (internode between LPI 5 and LPI 6) followed a similar distribution pattern, but the mean fibre length was not
significantly different between controls and transgenics.
Secondary xylem fibres from the main stem, which were
sampled from the same internodes as the petioles (LPI
6, LPI 21, LPI 43), did not differ between the transgenic
and wild-type trees.

cDNA microarray (GSE24703 for raw data on GEO
database). A total of 48 transcripts that accumulated differentially were expressed with a false discovery rate
(FDR, [30]) threshold set to 5% (q < 5.00) (SAM package
release 3.0; [31]). Out of the 48 significantly misregulated genes, 8 transcripts were up-regulated and 40 were
down-regulated in the transgenic trees (Table 1). The
portion of the stem that we targeted in this analysis is
also the part of the tree where petioles are actively
developing and growing. Approximately one-third of the
misregulated genes (14 out 48) had strong statistical
support (q < 0.001). However, the fold-change of all
genes identified was less than two (-1 < M < 1).
RT-qPCR analyses were carried out with gene-specific
DNA primer pairs representing 20 putatively misregulated genes, to confirm the microarray data. These analyses used the same RNA samples as those used for
microarray profiling plus two additional biological

replicates (n = 6). Fold difference ratios from RT-qPCR
results showed that twelve transcripts were congruent
with the microarray results, while four genes gave no difference and four genes yielded conflicting results (Table
2). Data indicate that we were able to validate a subset of
these misregulated sequences by RT-qPCR, which is consistent with a previous study reporting low rates of RTqPCR validation when microarray fold-changes are less
than two [32]. Thus, our relatively low validation rate is
not surprising and could be explained by other factors,
including cross-hybridisation of closely related genes to
the cDNA probes, for which we could not account [33].
The predicted functions of the misregulated transcripts in the PtaHB1 transgenics were examined and

separated into four categories: growth factor-related, cell
wall-related, membrane trafficking, and general functions. The growth factor group included sequences
related to brassinosteroid action, which are putative leucine-rich BAK1-like proteins (CN520805, CN519565).
These genes were down-regulated and suspected to be
involved in steroid signal transduction [34]. Genes for
ethylene perception and response were also down-regulated (HO702822, CN522424, and HO702885). Cell
wall-related sequences were an abundant category of
down-regulated transcripts. Other sequences related to
cell expansion and cell proliferation were down-regulated, including sequences encoding two fasciclin-like
proteins (CN518490) [35] two glyoxalases (CN519263,
CN521180) [36], a farnesylated protein (HO702768) [37]
and an elongation factor 2 (CN524724). The down-regulated sequences also included a 4CL gene (CN522696)
that is involved in the synthesis of G-lignin precursors,
and which is consistent with the decrease in auto-fluorescent fibres [38]. The up-regulated sequences encoded
transketolase-like proteins putatively involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis (CN523609) [39] and in decreasing
cell proliferation in preparation to dormancy [40].
The impact of PtaHB1 and PtaHB7 transgene expression on the other HD-Zip III gene transcripts was investigated in the transgenic poplars (Table 1). In general,
the UBI::PtaHB1 constructs led to decreased transcript
accumulation of all other HD-Zip III genes. However,
the number of RNA molecules was quite variable and
the effect was significant only for PtaHB5 (Student’s t
test, mean log 2 ratio -0.7920, p = 0.0430). In UBI::
PtaHB7 transgenic trees, the HD-Zip III genes had
slightly increased transcripts levels, but only PtaHB1,
PtaHB3 and PtaHB5 were significantly upregulated
(mean log2 ratio 0.5521, p = 0.0318; 0.7675, p = 0.0148
and 0.7263, p = 0.0046).
Accumulation of some, but not all HD-Zip III transcripts is
linked to auxin in Poplar

Given that some HD-Zip III genes have been linked to
auxin transport during vascular development [12] and
that PtaHB1 overexpression affected the accumulation of
several transcripts related to growth regulators, we examined whether or not auxin influenced transcript accumulation of HD-Zip III genes in developing secondary xylem
of young poplar trees. Removal of the stem apex, which
is the primary source of auxin in the plant, significantly
decreased the transcript level of PtdHB5 in the xylem tissue by nearly four-fold (mean log2 ratio = -1.9739) and
had a similar effect PtdHB7 but it was not found to be
statistically significant (mean log2 ratio = -1.6421; p-value
= 0.0776), and did not affect PtdHB1 (Table 3). The
application of N-(1-naphthyl) phthalamic acid (NPA) to a
portion of the stem undergoing secondary growth (see

derives from the apical meristem, whereas secondary
vascular tissues derive from the cambium. The specific
spatio-temporal control and action of regulators enable
the coordinated differentiation of the vasculature and
other tissues during plant development. In plant model
systems such as Arabidopsis and Zinnia, it has been
established that key events underlying vascular differentiation involve a few different HD-Zip III transcription
factors. This small family of regulators are known for
their overlapping expression profiles and their functional
redundancy. The aim of this study was to develop
insights into the role of HD-Zip III genes in secondary
xylem formation in forest trees. We examined the HDZip III gene family in two unrelated tree species belonging to the angiosperms (Populus spp.) and the gymnosperms (P. glauca).
Distinct HD-Zip III gene family evolution in gymnosperm
and angiosperm trees

Gene sequences isolated from the moss P. patens with
features typical of HD-Zip genes of class I, II, and III
clearly indicate that they were acquired early in plant
evolution [41]. The sequence analyses presented here
(Figure 1) are consistent with the idea that HD-Zips
have evolved through gene or genome duplications and
potential gene losses [21,22].
The phylogenetic tree we described (Figure 1)
included four full length HD-Zip III cDNA sequences of
P. glauca and was similar but not entirely congruent
with the tree topology previously predicted with a Bayesian procedure that used full length and partial cDNA
sequences from P. taeda [21,22]. On one hand, previous
authors have reported that gymnosperm HD-Zip III
sequences could be assigned to both the C8 and RVB
clades defined in angiosperm plants. On the other hand,

Côté et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:273
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/273

they showed that gymnosperms also formed two independent clades not represented in angiosperms. Our
results are consistent with the existence of gymnosperm
clades with representatives from Pinus and Picea. These
findings support the hypothesis that modern HD-Zip III
family structure derives from four ancestral sequences,
and that two of the ancestral sequences have been lost
in angiosperms leading to clades C8 and RVB, whereas
all four clades have potentially been retained in gymnosperms. However, our finding that the RVB clade lacked
conifer sequences and the lack of a reference gymnosperm genome sequence led us to conclude that further
analyses are needed to confirm whether or not gymnosperms are in fact represented in the RVB subclade.
Poplars have three more HD-Zip III sequences than
Arabidopsis, which is consistent with the inferred genome evolution of the former [26]. The poplar sequences
clearly formed four pairs of closely related paralogues.
The salicoid plant lineage that gave rise to the family
Salicaceae (including Populus spp.) appears to have
undergone a relatively recent genome-wide duplication
and reorganisation [26], whereas Arabidopsis is thought
to have undergone genome size reduction [42]. These
different evolutionary paths could have led to the loss of
certain functions as well as neofunctionalisation or subfunctionalisation within the angiosperms.
Transcription profiles identify HD-Zip III putatively
involved in vascular development

Delineating the potential role of HD-Zip III genes in
regard with vascular development is aided by comparing
RNA transcript accumulation in different organs, tissues
and cell types, despite the overlapping profiles that may
be observed within the family. Members of the C8 clade
have been most strongly linked to vascular development
and have not been implicated in leaf formation as such.
In Arabidopsis, AtHB-15/CNA is expressed in procambial cells where it is involved in early initiation of vascular cells, and has been implicated in embryo polarity.
The AtHB-8 gene product has been shown to promote
the proliferation and differentiation of xylem cells. Its
expression also localizes to pro-cambium cells, in addition to being modulated by auxin [16]. The transcripts
corresponding to the three P. glauca sequences we
assigned to the C8 clade were detected in all tissues but
preferentially in differentiating secondary vascular tissues both in the stem and in the roots. This observation
may represent evidence in support of the phylogenetic
position of Picea sequences PgHB-3 to PgHB-5, along
with several other gymnosperm sequences, in clade C8
rather than RVB. In Populus, there are four C8
sequences PtdHB5 to PtdHB8 with varied transcript
accumulation profiles in vascular tissues. The accumulation of PtdHB5 and PtdHB-6 transcripts were also

Page 10 of 17

clearly preferential to secondary xylem tissues. In contrast, the paralogous sequences PtdHB7 and PtdHB8
have very dissimilar profiles and were distinctly not preferential to secondary xylem. These transcript accumulation profiles of PtdHB7 and PtdHB8 indicated that
Populus C8 sequences may have undergone relatively
recent neofunctionnalisation or subfonctionnalisation,
compared to the pair of PtdHB5 and PtdHB6 which
share the most similar expression patterns. Overall, it
appears that gene duplications found in gymnosperm
C8 clade, and even the more ancient duplications at the
family level (PgHB6), have not led to strong diversification of expression profiles compared to that observed in
angiosperms.
Lateral organ formation has been assigned to RVB
clade that includes REV, AtHB-9 (PHB) and AtHB-14
(PHV). The closely related genes PHB and PHV are
involved in leaf polarity, while REV has been implicated
in several developmental processes, including vascular
cambium identity and activity, as well as fibre differentiation. Two putative homologues of Arabidopsis REV genes
have been detected in the genomes of Populus, Z. elegans,
O. sativa and Z. mays L. [43,44]. The functions of the
Zinnia REV homologues appear to have diverged, with
one being implicated in vascular development and the
other in lateral organ formation [9]. In contrast, the
Populus HB1 and HB2 have similar transcript patterns,
except that HB2 transcripts accumulate more strongly in
maturing leaves (Figure 2B). Arabidopsis may represent a
unique case with a REV paralog potentially having been
lost during ancestral genomic rearrangements [42], and
resulting in a gain of function for the remaining REV
sequence in developing xylem and leaves. Ko et al. (2006)
[6] found that PtdHB1 was associated with secondary
growth in poplar stems and hypothesised that HD-Zip III
genes played a role in secondary xylem differentiation in
trees. Our expression survey indicated that PtdHB1 transcripts are present at a similar level in the apex, primary
stems, secondary xylem, and young roots.
Poplar HD-zip III genes play a role in fibre development

Constitutive over-expression of the poplar PtaHB1 gene
in poplar led to greater transcript abundance corresponding to this gene, and resulted in shorter petioles
and a wider angle between the stem and adaxial side of
the petiole. The fibres with reduced lignification and
shorter length suggested that development of primary
xylem fibres was either impaired or delayed in the transgenic trees. Our hypothesis is that the increased angle
between the petioles and the stem is caused by a
delayed or incomplete fibre development relative to leaf
expansion. Asynchronous development may cause the
petioles to lack the necessary strength to support a fully
expanded leaf. This phenotype bears a resemblance to

Côté et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:273
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/273

that of the ifl-1 mutant (REV gene) in which interfascicular fibre development is impaired and inflorescence
stems lack sturdiness [43]. Moreover, it has been
observed that REV gain-of-function promotes xylem differentiation and accumulation, leading to dysfunctional
vascular patterning [13]. It thus appears that the
PtaHB1 over-expression phenotype is closer to the ifl-1
mutant phenotype than the REV gain-of-function phenotype. This result contrasts with our initial hypothesis
that PtaHB1 over-expression might promote fibre
differentiation.
Furthermore, the vascular phenotype observed in
PtaHB1 transgenic poplars was not consistent with previous observations that over-expression of non-mutated
HD-Zip III genes had no effect on plant development
because of gene silencing by microRNAs. In Arabidopsis, all of the HD-Zip III family transcripts are targeted
and negatively regulated by microRNAs (MiR165/166)
found in multiple copies in the genome [6]. Moreover,
the over-expression of the HD-Zip III sequences was
shown to trigger the production of these microRNAs
[45]. An hypothesis to explain our observations may be
that HD-Zip III PtaHB1 over-expression triggered the
accumulation of microRNAs that down-regulated the
other members of the HD-Zip III family. Transcript
accumulation of the other poplar HD-Zip III sequences
provided evidence in support of this hypothesis. Interestingly, PtaHB7 over-expression did not appear to have
a similar effect on other family members.
It has long been known that fibre differentiation or
stem elongation is controlled by growth factors such as
auxin, GA and brassinosteroids, and that overproduction
of auxin decreases primary stem elongation in Arabidopsis [46]. The REV/IFL-1 gene of Arabidopsis has
been implicated in polar transport of auxin [43]. Considering the known relationship between plant growth regulators and HD-Zip III genes, the delay in petiole
elongation in PtaHB1 transgenics may be linked to a
perturbation of growth regulation activity. For example,
auxin accumulation may be shifted due to altered polar
transport. Our observations in young wild-type poplar
trees suggested a putative link between auxin and the
expression of three different HD-Zip III genes (PtdHB1,
PtdHB5 and PtdHB8), the transcript levels of which
were affected by the application of an auxin transport
inhibitor (Table 3). This observation is consistent with
the fact that those gene transcripts are well represented
in secondary xylem (Figure 2B). Plant decapitation (from
the apex to LPI 3 inclusively) significantly down-regulated transcripts of PtdHB5 and had a smaller effect on
PtdHB7 transcripts. These results are partially consistent
with previous reports from Arabidopsis, where AtHB-8
was clearly modulated by auxin. Gene regulation may
have evolved differently in poplar compared to

Page 11 of 17

Arabidopsis, reflecting the developmental and physiological differences between a woody perennial plant and
an herbaceous annual.
The differentially expressed sequences identified in the
PtaHB1 over-expressing poplars were classified into a
few broad categories based upon putative functional
assignments. Most of the transcripts were down-regulated and included sequences related to development
pathways: brassinosteroid and ethylene growth regulators, ethylene perception and response, and putative
steroid signal transduction proteins, in addition to cell
wall-related and cell expansion or cell proliferation proteins. Many of the sequences have putative functions
that appear consistent with developmental activities of
IFL1/REV in Arabidopsis. They also appear to be consistent with the functions or pathways related to the phenotype observed in transgenic poplars.

Conclusions
The analysis of HD-Zip III genes in vascular development has been complicated by the complex interactions
between family members and the pleiotropic nature of
the mutant phenotypes [22]. Nevertheless, the experiments and findings reported here contribute to confirming the involvement of this group of genes in woody
plants, including primary and secondary vascular development. Taken together, the observations indicate that
HD-Zip III gene family structure has considerably
diverged between angiosperms and gymnosperms, and
suggest that individual genes within each taxonomic
group have acquired distinct and specialised functions,
some of which are related to secondary xylem growth.
The phenotype observed upon over-expression of a
wild-type poplar PtaHB1 gene represents a departure
from previous reports in Arabidopsis, where gene silencing by miRNAs suppressed potential effects of overexpression. The transgenic poplars likely represent a
useful system to continue investigating the functions of
PtaHB1. Transcript profiling identified a set of
sequences which may be targets of PtaHB1 or perhaps
lay downstream of PtaHB1 in the developmental cascade. Microarray profiling experiments using whole-genome arrays and targeting of other plant tissues related
to the transgenic phenotypes would likely help to consolidate the list of candidate targets.
Future studies could continue to explore and compare
more broadly the role of HD-Zip III genes in primary
and secondary vascular growth of woody plants, particularly the poplar PopHB5 (closest homologues to CNA)
which appeared the most specific to secondary xylem of
all other poplar HD-Zip III. In this regard, HD-Zip III
knock-downs (RNAi or anti-sense) could potentially
help to clarify the putative role of poplar HD-Zip III
genes. Genes encoding regulators of wood formation

potentially represent a rich source for identifying genetic
markers of wood properties that could used in targeted
breeding and selection. It typically takes 10-15 years or
more to grow trees to the point where they can be
selected to develop improved or new varieties; therefore,
if such markers are proven effective, they could potentially reduce the selection time and cost.

Methods
Plant material and growth conditions

Picea glauca (Moench) Voss (white spruce) tissues were
obtained from two sources. The gene isolation work
used plantlets of clone Pg-653, which are produced by
somatic propagation by the Canadian Forestry Service
(Klimaszewska et al., 2001). For the transcript-level survey, samples were obtained from two wild field grown
33-year-old trees in a progeny trial that had been established near Québec City. Two hybrid poplar clones were
used: Populus trichocarpa (Torr. & Gray) × P. deltoides
(clone H11-11, for gene expression experiments) and
Populus tremula L. × P. alba L. clone INRA clone 717
1-B4 (referred to as clone 717 for transgenic analysis).
Rooted softwood poplar cuttings were produced in 25
cm3 pots protected in clear plastic bags, transferred to 3
L pots after five weeks, and maintained in a greenhouse.
Both the spruce and poplar plants were grown in a
greenhouse with 16 hours light per day, with a temperature regime of 22/17°C (day/night), and relative humidity of at least 70%. Natural daylight was supplemented
with light from HQI-TS 400W/DH metal halogen lamps
(Osram, Munich, Germany). Plants were fertilised
weekly with 1 g L-1 20/20/20 (N-P-K) and supplemented
with calcium every two weeks.
Tissues for transcript profile survey

All tissues were frozen in liquid N2 immediately upon
removal from the tree and stored at -80°C until further
use. Several organs/tissues were isolated from two 33year-old field-grown white spruce P. glauca for transcript accumulation profiling. These included the terminal leader (1T), young needles from the upper crown
(YN), differentiated secondary phloem (2P) and xylem
(2X), as well as bark (B) tissues collected from three 3040 cm bolts taken from the lower third of the main
stem. The secondary phloem and xylem issues were
scraped with scalpel immediately after removing the
bark: 2P was scrapped from the exposed inner side of
the bark and the 2X from surface of the exposed wood.
This method relies on cleavage of tissues at the cambial
zone and yields relatively pure tissue types, although the
purity of 2X and 2P samples were not verified as such.
Similarly, tissues from large roots, including differentiating xylem (R2X) and phloem (RPP; with phelloderm)
were collected taken in a one-meter radius from the

Page 12 of 17

base of the stem. Each sample was kept separate for
total RNA extraction. Tissues were also collected from
two trees of clone H11-11 selected to be similar in size,
i.e., average of 80 cm tall and possessing at least 25
leaves with a plastochron index (LPI) greater than zero
[47]. LPI 0 denotes a leaf blade that is 1 cm long and is
undergoing laminar expansion. The tissues consisted of:
Apex LPI 0 without leaves (A); shoot tips up to and
including LPI 1 (1T); young leaves up to LPI 3 (YF);
mature leaves LPI 15-16 (ML); old leaves LPI 30-31
(OL), and differentiating xylem and phloem scrapped
with a scalpel from the portion of the main stems exhibiting secondary growth (2X and 2P, respectively)
between LPI 15 and LPI 20; and actively growing white
coloured roots (R).
Auxin-related treatments in poplar

Two treatments were applied to young poplar trees (P.
trichocarpa × P. deltoides H11-11, described above)
averaging 80 cm in height in order to assess the potential effect of auxin on HD-Zip III transcript accumulation in poplar. Six randomly selected trees which
possessed at least 25 leaves with a plastochron index
(LPI) greater than zero were assigned to each treatment
and to the control untreated group. The first treatment
removed the shoot apex, which involved cutting off the
top part of plants down to LPI 3 inclusively. The second
treatment applied an inhibitor of polar auxin transport,
N-(1-naphthyl) phthalamic acid (NPA, 1 mM for treatment and 0 mM for control) mixed with lanolin as a
carrier. The mixture of NPA and lanolin was placed on
the bark (after removing the layer of cuticle), entirely
covering a segment of the stem of 2.5 cm centered at
the internode LP15, and covered with paraffin film. Secondary xylem tissues were collected 72 h after the treatments were applied, from internodes LPI14 to 16 and
consisted of whole stem segments without the bark. For
the NPA treated trees, the sampling consisted of stems
segments without bark 3 cm above and 3 cm below the
region of NPA application (LPI15 was excluded). The
transcript accumulation data (see below) obtained from
these tissues were analysed using Student’s t test applied
to each gene separately comparing the treated and
untreated plants. For the NPA treated trees, tissues
obtained below and above the region of application
were analysed separately and the data were averaged for
each tree.
RNA extraction, sequence isolation and phylogenetic
analyses

Total RNA extractions were carried out using the CTAB
method of Chang et al. (1993) [48] from spruce and
poplar tissues, which were stored at -80°C until used.
The quantity and integrity of total RNA were evaluated

Côté et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:273
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/273

by spectrophotometry (OD 260/280 ratio of 1.8:1 to
2.1:1), and by using a Bioanalyzer 2001 using an RNA
6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA,
USA) to achieve a 28S:18 S ratio of 1.2:1 to 2.2:1 and an
RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7.
Partial HD-Zips III gene sequences were identified
among EST (Expressed Sequenced Tags) obtained from
the conifers P. taeda [49] and P. glauca [50] through
BLAST analysis (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool).
Completed coding sequences and untranslated 3’ and 5’
region (UTRs) were isolated by using PCR-cloning with
degenerate primers or 3’ RACE, 5’ RACE (SMART
RACE cDNA Amplification, BD Biosciences Clontech,
Mountain View, CA, USA) or both cloning methods
with mRNAs from needles or xylem. The cDNAs were
cloned in pCR2.1 with the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), then sequenced with a 16-capillary
genetic analyzer (ABI Prism 3130XL and an ABI Prism
3100XL, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Public databases were searched by use of the BLAST
algorithms to identify HD-Zip III sequences in the
Poplar genome (JGI, P. trichocarpa v1.0, [26] and
updated v2.0 http://www.phytozome.net/poplar), and the
non-redundant NCBI database (nr; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/). Corresponding cDNAs were amplified from
first-strand cDNA which had been derived from pooled
total RNA extracted from developing secondary xylem,
tips and young leaves (P. trichocarpa × P. deltoides and
P. tremula × P. alba). The identity of each cDNA clone
was confirmed by complete and partial sequence comparisons with the poplar genome and previously identified EST sequences [6].
The predicted HD-Zip III amino acid sequences from
multiple species were aligned using ClustalW algorithm
[51], which is included in the Bioedit software [52], and
then refined manually. Phylogenetic analyses used the
alignment of complete amino acid sequences via MEGA
software [53]. A Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic tree
[28] was constructed based on a Poisson correction
model and pair-wise deletion algorithm (1,000 bootstrap
replicates). The phylogenetic tree was rooted with three
members of other HD-Zip class 1 and 4 sequences
found in the Genbank database [54].
RT-qPCR procedures

Total RNA (2 μg) was DNase-treated and reverse-transcribed using the SuperScriptII First-Strand Synthesis
System for RT-PCR following manufacturer’s recommendations (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The resulting first-strand cDNA was diluted 1:10 in deionised
water before quantitative PCR determinations. An aliquot of cDNA equivalent of 20 ng of total RNA was
used per 20 μL of PCR reaction. Amplifications were
performed in a QuantiTect™PCR SYBR® Green Kit

Page 13 of 17

(Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) with 0.3 μM of 5’
and 3’ primers, with a DNA Engine Opticon TM 2 System (MJ Research Inc., Ramsey, MN, USA) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers were designed
with Primer3 software [55], with a melting temperature
(Tm) between 55°C and 62°C, and produced amplicons
between 100 and 250 bp (Additional file 1). The poplar
RT-qPCR primers were tested on the clones H11-11
and INRA-717. Amplification reaction efficiencies were
between 90 and 105% for each primer pair. The thermal-cycling parameters were as follows: 95°C for 15
min; 45 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 1 min and
72°C for 40 sec; followed by a melting curve analysis
from 54°C to 95°C with increments of 0.1°C per step to
verify the specificity of the amplification and presence of
primer dimers. The number of target copies in each
sample was determined from Ct values (cycle threshold
values) using a linearised plasmid or purified PCR product to produce a standard curve, which was obtained
by averaging values from several runs. Two to six independent sample assays were performed and each sample
was loaded in duplicate. Results were normalised relative
to the absolute RNA used in a single reaction and with
the transcript level of a reference gene. The spruce data
were normalised to the reference of transcript level gene
encoding Elongation factor 1 alpha, EF1a, (AJ132534)
[56]. The EF1a gene were strongly expressed and
showed low variation between spruce tissues [57]. In
poplar, the reference was a cell division cycle 2 gene
homologue, CDC2 (AF194820) [58]. CDC2 cycle threshold values (Ct) averaged 18.5 + 0.5 (Standard Deviation),
which is the experimental error range of the RT-qPCR
cycler device. For statistical analyses of the RT-qPCR
data from auxin-related treatments and transgenic
experiments (Tables 1, 2, 3) a log2 transformation was
applied to the number of target copies.
Agrobacterium transformation and growth of transgenic
poplars

Over-expression constructs were obtained by inserting
the complete coding sequences of PtaHB1 and PtaHB7
from P. tremula × P. alba clone INRA-717 between the
maize ubiquitin promoter [59] and a 35 S terminator
into the pCambia1305.2 vector http://www.cambia.org.
The resulting plasmids were then transferred into A.
tumefaciens strain C58 pGV2260 [60].
For transformation, in vitro plantlets of the hybrid
poplar clone INRA-717 were micropropagated on hormone-free 1/2 MS medium [61] supplemented with vitamin D3. Internodes from in vitro plantlets were cocultivated with the engineered A. tumefaciens according
to the method of Leple et al. (1992) [62], with the following modifications. After co-cultivation, the explants
were decontaminated of A. tumefaciens with cefotaxim

Côté et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:273
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/273

and transferred onto M2 medium containing cefotaxim
alone [62]. Transgenic calluses were selected on M3
medium supplemented with hygromycin (10 mg L -1 )
and emerging shoots were transferred for rooting to 1/2
MS medium without hygromycin, screened for positive
X-glucuronidase activity [62], and assayed for poplar
PtaHB1 and PtaHB7 mRNA accumulation by RT-qPCR.
Shoots with elevated PtaHB1 and PtaHB7 mRNA levels
relative to WT control were transferred to the greenhouse where they were grown under a photoperiod of
16 h of light, at 24/20°C (day/night). For each construct,
four to six trees for each of six lines (independent transformation events), and 10 to 15 WT INRA-717 trees
were propagated and carried forward together for phenotypic determinations.
Phenotype characterisations of transgenic poplars

Morphometric measurements were performed on two
trees from three independent transformation events per
line and six control trees (WT). Internode length,
petiole length, and petiole angle were measured from
LPI 1 to the bottom of each tree. Vascular tissue organisation was visualised on samples taken from fresh stem
and petiole sections from LPI 20. Samples were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde - 2% glutaraldehyde cacodylate
buffer (pH 7.2) for 12 hours under vacuum, and stored
at 4°C before embedding in paraffin blocks. Microtome
cross-sections (10µm thick) were mounted on glass
slides; after the paraffin was removed, the sections were
rehydrated for observation under UV light on an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Montreal, QC,
Canada). Fibre and vessel distributions in petioles were
visualised by lignin autofluorescence and counted (75 to
150 cells per field imaged). The average fibre to vessel
ratio was computed from four transgenic plants and
four WT plants. Fibre Quality Analysis (FQA; OpTest
Equipment, Hawkesbury, ON, Canada) used freshly
debarked internodes, and intact petiole sections from
LPI 6, LPI 21 and LPI 43. The samples were macerated
in Franklin’s solution until they were completely
bleached and the fibres could be separated [63]. The
FQA weighted, fibre length (lw) data (8000 individual
fibres per petiole or internode) were obtained from
three trees per transgenic line on six lines and on six
control trees. For analyses, the data were placed into
bins of 0.10 to 0.25 mm.
Statistical analyses of phenotypic and RT-qPCR data

Statistical treatment of phenotypic data compared transgenic poplars transformed empty vector (control lines)
and those transformed with the PtaHB1 gene construct.
Except where otherwise noted, the data were not transformed and each tree was considered an individual

Page 14 of 17

experiment unit. Normality was confirmed and Student’s
t tests were used for petiole length and angle data (Figure
3), with each internode tested separately in SYSTAT 13
(Cranes Software International Ltd., Chicago, IL). Student’s t tests were also used to compare the proportion
fibres to vessels within the petioles, determined by using
UV microscopy (Figure 4A and 4B). The fibre length
data (FQA) were analysed by comparing the proportion
(%) of fibres in each length class (bin) (Figure 4C) with a
one-way ANOVA, on each bin independently, and also
by comparing the overall fibre length data (Figure 4D).
Before analysis the normality of the data was confirmed,
and ANOVAs were carried out using procGLM in SAS
(Version 9.01, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
For RT-qPCR data comparing control and PtaHB1
transgenic lines (Table 1, 2) and comparing the impact
auxin-related treatments (Table 3) normality and Student’s t tests were applied to log2 transformed numbers
of transcript targets in SYSTAT 13 (Cranes Software
International Ltd., Chicago, IL).
Microarray RNA profiling

A poplar 3.4 K cDNA microarray was prepared by the
ARBOREA project and is described in Pitre et al. (2010)
[64]. RNA transcript profiling was carried for each of
the transgenic constructs, with four samples from two
independent transformation events compared with four
control samples from two independent transformation
events (empty vector controls). Primary stem tissues
(LPI 0 to 5) were used for profiling PtaHB1 over-expressing lines and secondary stem xylem tissues (LPI 21 to
43) were used for the PtaHB7. The microarray hybridization methods were as described in Pitre et al. (2010)
[64]. Each microarray hybridisation used 1 μg of total
RNA that was amplified using the SuperScript™ Indirect
RNA Amplification System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and 5 μg of the aRNA were labelled with Alexa
Fluor®555 and 647 dyes (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA, USA),
for use in dye-swap experiments. The poplar 3.4 K
microarray slides were pre-hybridised for 2 hours at 42°
C in a solution containing 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.02%
BSA (w/v), 0.01% herring sperm DNA (w/v), and 50%
formamide. The slides were then washed twice in 0.1×
SSC, once in water, rinsed in 2-propanol, and finally
dried by centrifugation. The labelled targets (3.5 μL)
were mixed with 52.5μL of hybridisation solution containing 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.01% herring sperm DNA
(w/v), and 50% deionised formamide. The mixture was
heat-denatured for 4 min at 95°C and cooled for 5 min
on ice prior to hybridisation to the microarray. The
microarray was then covered with a LifterSlip (Erie
Scientific Company, Portsmouth, NH, USA) and placed
in a hybridisation chamber II with increased depth

Côté et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:273

(Corning, Lowell, MA, USA) and incubated for 12 h at
45°C in a model 1012 hybridisation oven (Shel Lab, Cornelius, OR, USA). After hybridisation, the slides were
iteratively washed for 15 min in 2× SSC + 0.5% SDS,
0.5× SSC + 0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSC solutions at 45°C.
The slides were scanned using a ScanArray™Express
scanner (Packard BioScience, Meriden, CT, USA) and
the image files were analysed using QuantArray® software (Packard BioScience, Meriden, CT, USA). Scan
intensities were comparable between sets of slides for a
given hybridisation. Data analysis was carried out using
Bioconductor packages http://www.bioconductor.org
distributed in R (R Development Core Team 2008).
Median foreground intensity minus median background
intensity was the response variable used for the statistical analysis. Data quality was assessed using graphical
analysis tools in the marray and olin packages available
in Bioconductor, and by assessment of within- and
between-slide Pearson product-moment correlation
coefficients (r), which were calculated both from the
raw intensities and after normalisation. The composite
normalisation method [65] was applied by using the two
functions maNorm2 D and maNormLoess in the marray
package [66]. We identified differentially expressed
sequences with the SAM package release 3.0 [31] using
a false discovery rate (FDR) [30] threshold set to 5% (q
< 5.00). Data reported in the article are log2 -ratios of
Alexa Fluor®555/647, which are denoted M. Raw data
are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database (accession number: GSE24703, http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
