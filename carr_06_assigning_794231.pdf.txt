Abstract
Background: In stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae) the eyes and antennae are laterally displaced at the
ends of elongated eyestalks. Eyespan and the degree of sexual dimorphism in eyespan vary
considerably between species and several sexually dimorphic species show sexual selection
through female mate preference for males with exaggerated eyespan. The genes on which selection
acts to regulate eyespan remain to be identified. This could be achieved by comparing gene
expression during eyestalk development in males and females if the sex of pre-adult flies could be
reliably assigned. Here we describe two techniques, one morphological and one microsatellitebased, that identify the sex of stalk-eyed fly larvae and pupae.
Results: We showed that genital discs of the stalk-eyed fly Teleopsis dalmanni have two highly
distinct morphologies, compact ("C") and lobed ("L"). Segment composition (revealed by Engrailed
expression) was consistent with C morphology being typical of males and L morphology of females.
We confirmed the proposed association between disc morphology and sex by evaluating the
combined heterozygosity of four X-linked microsatellite markers. We demonstrated that
individuals with C genital discs had hemizygous (male) genotypes while those with L discs were
heterozygous (female) genotypes. Similar dimorphism in genital disc morphology was observed in
eight other species spanning three representative Diopsid genera. In every case the segment
composition supported C morphology being male and L morphology female. We assigned larval
sex by C or L morphology and compared cell division frequencies in male and female eye-antennal
discs in two species (T. dalmanni and Diasemopsis meigenii) sexually dimorphic for eyespan. The
number of mitotic (anti-H3-labelled) cells did not differ between the sexes in either species.
Conclusion: We have made novel use of two complementary techniques for identifying the sex
of pre-adult stalk-eyed flies. These procedures will facilitate studies of the evolution of sexually
dimorphic development in a variety of other species. Morphology and En expression in male and
female genital discs are highly conserved within each genus of Diopsidae. Finally, sexual dimorphism
for eyespan in two Diopsid species is unlikely to be due to an increased rate of cell division at the
third larval instar in males.

Background
Understanding the evolution of sexually dimorphic development is a key goal in many biological contexts [1-3].
However, in many taxa the ability to investigate dimorphism in early gene expression and development is
impeded by the lack of a reliable method for assigning sex
to embryos, larvae or other early life stages. For example,
in holometabolous insects adult morphology is determined largely prior to formation of the primary sex organs
and eclosion. Investigation of sexually dimorphic development would be greatly facilitated by the identification
of sex in the absence of traditional cues such as gonads or
genitalia.
Hypercephaly, in the form of lateral extensions of the
head capsule, is observed in several families of Diptera
[4]. A particularly exaggerated form is found in the Diopsidae (stalk-eyed flies) in which eyes and antennae are laterally displaced at the end of eyestalks in both sexes. In
many Diopsid species eyespan (the distance between the
eyes) is sexually dimorphic, with males being larger than
females. Eyespan and the degree of sexual dimorphism in
eyespan varies considerably within the family [5,6], and
there is empirical evidence that the highly exaggerated
eyestalks found in males have evolved under sexual selection through strong female mate preference for males with
larger eyespan [7-10]. Eyespan is determined prior to
eclosion and is sensitive to external stress during pupation
(e.g. heat shock; [11]). Developmental studies indicate
that the expression of key regulatory genes involved in
early head capsule specification is similar to that observed
in other Dipterans [12-14].
From an evolutionary standpoint there is considerable
interest in identifying the timing of expression of the hitherto unknown genes on which selection acts to regulate
eyespan in sexually dimorphic Diopsid species. One
potentially powerful approach is to compare gene expression during the development of eyestalks in between the
sexes, since sexual dimorphism likely results from differential gene expression with respect to sex. However, this
requires a method for determining the sex of pre-adult
flies. In the model Dipteran Drosophila melanogaster it is
possible to do this either on the basis of gonad size (the
male gonad being significantly larger than the female in
3rd instar larvae), or by using X-linked genetic markers
such as the cuticle pigmentation gene yellow. Neither
method is applicable in stalk-eyed flies in which the larval
gonads of both males and females are equally small and
undifferentiated and visible genetic markers are lacking.
Here we present an alternative, novel method based on
genital disc morphology and X-linked DNA markers,
which can be applied in principle to many different Diopsid species, and potentially to other taxa.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/6/29

The adult structures of Dipteran flies, including stalk-eyed
flies, develop from the larval imaginal discs, which originate as invaginations of the embryonic ectoderm. In D.
melanogaster it has been shown that with the exception of
the eye-antennal and genital discs all of the imaginal discs
are composed of cells derived from a single embryonic
segment [15]. Imaginal disc cells multiply throughout larval development and differentiate during metamorphosis.
While the other imaginal discs exist as pairs, in Drosophila
the genital disc is a single disc in each sex [16].
In Drosophila the genital disc develops into the internal
and external genitalia and the analia, collectively known
as the terminalia. It is the only imaginal disc with an
unambiguous sexually dimorphic morphology. The genital discs of both sexes comprise cells from the eighth,
ninth and tenth/eleventh abdominal embryonic segments
and the fate of these cells depends on the fly's sex [17,18].
In male larvae, the cells of the eighth segment have
repressed proliferation, as these cells would otherwise
develop into the female genitalia; while in female larvae,
cells from the ninth segment, which would otherwise give
rise to the male genitalia, do not develop. In both sexes
cells from the tenth/eleventh abdominal segments
develop into the analia [19].
In the model stalk-eyed fly species, Teleopsis dalmanni
(previously known as Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni; [20]), we
found that the genital discs have two distinct morphologies. We have termed these "compact" and "lobed" morphologies to reflect the fact that the former morph is
relatively flat and compact. In D. melanogaster, segment
polarity genes such as engrailed (en) have very different
expression patterns in the male and female discs, which
reflect later differences in eventual segment fate [21]. The
pattern of en protein expression in T. dalmanni genital
discs showing the compact morphology resembled that
observed in the male genital discs of D. melanogaster. As in
D. melanogaster, male Diopsids have a single X chromosome whilst females have a pair [22]. We confirmed the
proposed association between disc morphology and sex
by evaluating the combined heterozygosity of four Xlinked microsatellite markers; individuals with a compact
form of genital disc had hemizygous (male) genotypes,
whereas individuals with lobed discs tended to exhibit
heterozygous (female) genotypes.
To determine the extent to which male and female genital
disc structure and segmental composition is conserved
across the Diopsid clade, we characterised morphology
and EN expression in a panel of Diopsid species spanning
three genera. A compact/lobed dimorphism similar to
that of T. dalmanni was observed and in all species studied
EN expression patterns were consistent with the compact
morphology being typical of males across genera.

We exploited our ability to assign sex by genital disc morphology to compare cell division rates in male and female
eye-antennal discs. In T. dalmanni the larger eyespan of
males is due, at least in part, to the eyestalks being composed of more cells. This could reflect a higher rate of cell
division or a prolonged period of proliferation in males.
We used genital disc morphology to determine whether
the frequency of cell division differs between male and
female H3 antibody-labelled eye-antennal discs in two
sexually dimorphic species, T. dalmanni and Diasemopsis
meigenni. We found no significant differences in dividing
cell counts between the sexes in either species.

Results
Genital disc morphology in D. melanogaster and T.
dalmanni
Most of the imaginal discs in D. melanogaster are essentially two-dimensional with folds in the plane of the disc
epithelium. In contrast, the genital disc epithelium is
folded into a fully three-dimensional structure with distinct ventral and dorsal sides [21]. By the third larval
instar the morphology of the male and female genital
imaginal discs is clearly dimorphic. Both discs are bilaterally symmetrical. The male discs have a somewhat flattened structure. The posterior half of the disc contains the
repressed female primordia on the ventral side and the
anal primordia on the dorsal side. Both primordia have
undergone relatively little proliferation and form single
layers of cells with little folding. The anterior of the disc
consists of the male primordia, which have grown to form
a series of concentric folds. The female discs have a complex folded structure reflecting the outgrowth of the left
and right female primordia on the ventral side of the disc.
Both the repressed male primordia and the anal primordia lie on the dorsal side of the disc and, having undergone relatively little proliferative growth, form a single
thickened layer.

In both male and female discs the three primordia (male,
female and anal) are contiguous. As each is derived from
a different segment, their boundaries can be revealed by
staining the discs with an antibody raised against a highly
conserved epitope of the en protein product, the expression of which is restricted to the posterior compartments
of all segments. In the male disc, EN expression in the
male primordium forms a broad anterior band on both
ventral and dorsal sides of the discs. On the dorsal side
two lateral stripes representing the anal primordium are
visible, while a small central patch corresponding to the
posterior compartment of the repressed female primordium is visible ventrally (Figure 1A). In the female disc,
EN is expressed in one ventral anterior band at the boundary of the female and repressed male primordium, a dorsal anterior band at the boundary of the repressed male
and anal primordium and in two laterally placed stripes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/6/29

along the dorsal posterior edges of the disc revealing the
location of the posterior compartments of the left andright anal primordium (Figure 1B).
In the stalk-eyed fly, T. dalmanni, two distinct genital disc
morphologies can be observed. One type, which we have
termed "compact", resembles the morphology of the male
genital disc in Drosophila. The posterior half of the disc has
a relatively simple flattened structure while the anterior
forms a series of concentric folds. EN is expressed in two
posterior strips similar to the staining of the anal primordium in Drosophila and in two large anterior patches,
which could correspond to male primordium expression
(Figure 1C). The other type, which we have termed
"lobed", has a complex folded structure with the left and
right discs connected only by a thin bridge of tissue. Bands
of EN expression are visible dorsally and laterally (Figure
1D).
Genital disc morphology and microsatellite genotypes
We used a microsatellite-based approach to verify the sex
of the compact (putatively male) and lobed (putatively
female) genital discs of T. dalmanni. A panel of six Xlinked microsatellite markers were assayed for the 1989
and 1993 populations and four markers showing the
most variation were selected for further analysis. In order
to determine the accuracy of assays using these loci to distinguish reliably between the sexes in T. dalmanni, a trial
was conducted using adult males and females. Using combined data from the 4 loci, 91.7% of males (n = 12) were
hemizygous at all four loci and 90% of females (n = 20)
were found to carry two different alleles for at least one
marker locus (see Table 2).

A further assay based on the same 4 loci was used to test
for an association between the sex of a larva (inferred on
the basis of their number of alleles per microsatellite
locus) and the morphological type of genital disc. Genital
discs were dissected from 3rd instar larvae, stained with
methylene blue and typed for morphology (compact or
lobed). DNA for microsatellite analysis was extracted
from the remaining larval tissue of 16 with the compact
type of genital disc and 16 individuals with the lobed type
(Table 3). Individuals with the compact disc type were
found always to have only one allele at each genotyped
microsatellite. With the exception of one individual who
could be assayed at only 3 of the loci, the members of the
lobed disc type invariably had two alleles for at least one
marker locus. A contingency test revealed a highly significant association between type of disc morphology and X
chromosome zygosity level (χ2 = 28.69, df = 1, P < 0.001).
The expected values for this test have been adjusted using
the observed error levels from the genotyping trials of
adults. Note that even if this error level is omitted from
the contingency test, the significant association between

anterior (arrows) and one more posterior and lateral (arrowheads). Anterior is uppermost in all panels.

disc morphology and level of X chromosome zygosity
remains (χ2 = 28.25, df = 1, P < 0.001). Thus the microsatellite genotyping confirms the inferences from the comparative morphology and en expression analyses that
individuals with compact genital disc morphology are
male and those with lobed morphology are female.
Genital disc morphology among Diopsid species
We investigated the morphologies and en protein expression patterns of the male and female discs in a further
eight species sampled from three representative genera of
Diopsids in order to characterise morphological variation
among the clade. Three further Teleopsis species were chosen (T. breviscopium, T. quinqueguttata and T. species n) to
supplement our findings described above for T. dalmanni.
Also we selected three more distantly related Diasemopsis
species (D. meigenii, D. comoroensis and D. dubia). The
Sphyracephalae have been shown to form a basal genus
within extant Diopsidae [23] and so finally we analysed
two species from this genus (S. beccarii and S. europaea).
Examples of representative species from each genus are
presented in Figure 1C–H and their position within the
clade of Diopsid species is shown in Figure 2.

In all species, two distinct morphologies of genital disc
with associated EN patterns were found (examples shown
in Figure 1C–H). In the species sampled we found that
discs from one genus could be distinguished from those of
the other two on the basis of subtle morphological differences. Within each genus, morphology and en staining
patterns of both types of disc were effectively identical in
all species. In Teleopsis species, we can assign sex according
to genital disc morphology with some confidence given
the consistent results of our microsatellite-based assay to
identify the male and female disc types in one genus
member, T. dalmanni (Figure 1C and 1D).
In the Diasemopsis species, one of the disc morphologies
(putatively male) showed an almost identical pattern of
EN expression to that seen in male Teleopsis discs (Figure
1E). One slight difference was that the right and left discs
were connected by only a thin band of tissue in Diasemopsis while nearly fused in Teleopsis. The other disc morphology and EN patterns observed were very similar to those
of the female discs in the Teleopsis species (Figure 1F). We,
therefore, putatively identify this morphology as female.
In the basal Diopsids, one disc type closely resembled the
morphological and en protein expression patterns of male
discs found in Teleopsis species (Figure 1G). The other disc
had a unique morphology consisting of four loosely connected lobes (Figure 1H). Given the strong conservation
of male patterns, the former disc morphology is assumed,
putatively, to be male and, by exclusion, the latter unusual
morphology is assumed to be female in this species.

Cell division rates of males and females during prepupal
growth
Counts of mitotic cells in the eye-antennal discs at the prepupal stage were obtained for males and females of two
sexually dimorphic Diopsid species (T. dalmanni, n = 8
males and 5 females; D. meigenii, n = 6 males and 9
females). Cell counts were non-normally distributed and
therefore analysed by non-parametric methods (Wilcoxon
test). In both species, cell counts did not differ significantly between the sexes (T. dalmanni, χ2 = 3.09, df = 1, P
= 0.08; D. meigenii, χ2 = 0.06, df = 1, P = 0.81).

Discussion
Analysis of the development of sexually dimorphic characters requires a method for identifying the sex of preadult individuals. Here we describe two different techniques one morphological and one microsatellite-based
that can be used to identify the sex of stalk-eyed fly larvae
and pupae. However, these procedures will likely be of use
to investigators studying the evolution of sexually dimorphic development in a variety of other species. We also
highlight some of the uses and applications of these techniques.
Complementary approaches to determining sex of preadult flies
The morphological approach relies on the strong sexual
dimorphism we observe in genital disc morphology (two
highly distinct forms, compact and lobed), present in all
Diopsid species examined. However, it is not intrinsically
obvious whether these forms reflect sexual identity. A
comparative argument can be made based on the similarities between stalk-eyed fly disc morphologies and those
of the male and female discs in Drosophila but, given the
evolutionary distance between Diopsids and Drosophilids, independent verification of the sex of each disc type
is desirable. X-linked microsatellite genotyping [24], correctly identified the sex of adult stalk-eyed flies in over
90% of cases. The level of accuracy could be further
increased by the use of additional microsatellite loci or by
using flies of greater heterozygosity. A single adult male
was heterozygous at two of the X-linked microsatellite
loci. This was unexpected and potential explanations
include contamination of the genomic DNA or a duplication of the region of the X chromosome containing ms125 and ms-167, with each duplicated locus evolving
independently.

Each method, morphological or genetic, has advantages
and disadvantages. Assays of genital discs in order to
assign sex are only possible for a limited period during
development. For example, in D. melanogaster, sexual
dimorphism in genital disc morphology is not apparent
until the third larval instar and it becomes progressively
more difficult to observe the genital disc as metamorpho-

sis proceeds. In contrast, the use of microsatellites has the
advantage over simple observation of genital disc morphology as they can be used to identify the sex of individuals at any growth stage. However, there are constraints to
the adoption of a microsatellite-based approach, as it is
also more costly, more time-consuming and currently less
reliable than morphological observation; in Diopsids, Xlinked microsatellites are currently limited to only a few
species within the Teleopsis genus [24].
In the three genera we have studied at least one of the
discs has proved almost identical in terms of morphology
and EN expression to either the male or the female disc in
T. dalmanni. We are therefore confident that the morphological assay can be used to identify the sex of larvae from
these species. In the absence of X-linked microsatellite
markers it may be possible to verify this by in vivo culture
of male and female discs, as has been achieved for analysis
of eye-antennal discs in T. dalmanni [13].
Genital disc variation within the Diopsidae
We have described differences between the genital discs of
males and females in three stalk-eyed fly genera. EN
expression patterns and morphology are very highly conserved within Diopsid genera and, with one notable
exception, quite similar to that described in D. melanogaster. EN expression patterns are consistent with the
hypothesis that the genital discs are derived from more
than one embryonic segment and suggest that as in D.
melanogaster, the posterior part of each disc gives rise to
the analia and the anterior to the genitalia. It should be
possible to verify these assumptions by in vivo culture of
male and female discs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/6/29

erally situated discs are derived from cells displaced from
the eighth abdominal segment (Calliphora erytrocephala
[27]; Musca domestica [28,29]). In contrast, the acalypterate D. melanogaster possesses a single genital disc [16]. Our
study of T. dalmanni shows that for a second acalypterate
species, individuals of each sex possess one genital disc
and lateral genital discs are absent. Two recent studies
have established that the acalypterate Diopsidae are the
basal family within Schizophorans based on morphological [30] and molecular phylogenies [31]. Consequently it
can be inferred that a single genital disc is the likely ancestral form of Schizophoran flies and possession of a pair of
lateral discs is a derived feature of calypterate flies. However, further studies of genital disc morphology in other
Schizophoran species such as the Centrioncidae [32,33],
or outgroup families from the lower Cylcorrapha [34] are
needed to confirm this inference.
Cell division rates of males and females during prepupal
growth
The cellular basis of the sexual dimorphism for eyespan in
T. dalmanni may be due, at least in part, to differences in
cell number. We have exploited our ability to identify larval sex in this species to compare rates of cell division in
male and female eye-antennal discs. The difference
between the number of mitotic H3-labelled cells in males
and females at the prepupal stage was not significant, suggesting that the rate of cell division is similar in both sexes
at this timepoint. We are currently developing techniques
for assessing cell division at subsequent stages of metamorphosis, when the developing eyestalks are less accessible to experimental manipulation.

Conclusion
Male discs are highly conserved within and between Diopsid genera. The female discs of Teleopsis and Diasemopsis
are similar in appearance, suggesting a conserved morphology since the two lineages diverged. Female discs in
the phylogenetically basal Sphyracephala exhibit a more
complex morphology quite unlike their counterparts in
the other Diopsid genera or in D. melanogaster so that it is
unclear which regions of the disc represent the genital and
anal primordia. Although we have not tried to assign functionality to these differences, our data provide a firm basis
for future studies of the evolution of genital disc morphology and sexual dimorphism in stalk-eyed flies.
Evolution of genital disc morphology in Schizophoran flies
Phylogenetically the Schizophoran dipterans are traditionally viewed as comprising two sister groups, the acalypterates and calypterates [25,26]. Genital discs have
been characterised in a pair of calypterate species and in
each case individuals exhibit three genital discs. One disc
comprises cells from the ninth, tenth and eleventh
abdominal embryonic segments and a further pair of lat-

We describe the novel application of two complementary
techniques, one morphological and one microsatellite
based, for identifying the sex of pre-adult stalk-eyed flies.
Both procedures will aid studies of the evolution of sexually dimorphic development in Diopsid and other flies
and the microsatellite-based approach may be applied to
a wide range of species. To demonstrate the potential
value of our methods, we used them to assign larval sex in
a study comparing cell division frequencies in male and
female eye-antennal discs of two sexually dimorphic species. Our findings indicate that sexual dimorphism for
eyespan in Diopsids is unlikely to be due to an increased
rate of cell division in males at the end of the third larval
instar.

Methods
Fly stocks and rearing methods
Experimental samples of T. dalmanni for this study were
obtained from a pair of laboratory populations originally
derived from field collections in 1989 and 1993 near the
Gombak River in Malaysia and maintained subsequently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/6/29

as independent stocks. To minimise the potential effects
of inbreeding, both stocks have been maintained in population cages containing at least 200 individuals, kept at
at 25°C on a 12 hour: 12 hour light: dark cycle, and fed
ground sweetcorn. In order to maximise X-chromosomal
heterozygosity in females when genotyping microsatellites, we analysed the hybrid offspring of males from the
1989 stock crossed to females of the 1993 stock.
A further six stalk-eyed fly species were used during this
study. They were T. quinqueguttata (originally collected
from Ulu Gombak, Malaysia), T. species n (Chiang Mai,
Thailand), T. breviscopium (Bukit Timah, Singapore), Sphyracephala beccarii (Pietermaritzberg, South Africa), S. europaea
(Szeged,
Hungary),
Diasemopsis
dubia
(Pietermaritzberg, South Africa), Diasemopsis meigenii
(Pietermaritzberg, South Africa) and D. comoroensis
(Mohéli, Comoros). All species were maintained under
similar conditions to those of T. dalmanni.
The sample of wild-type D. melanogaster came from a
stock established in 1972 from a collection in Dahomey
(now Benin, West Africa). Subsequently this has been
maintained on standard sugar-yeast food medium at large
population size in cage culture at 25°C and exhibits high
levels of genetic variation [35].
Imaginal disc preparation
Third instar T. dalmanni larvae were dissected in 1 × PBS,
with the larval cuticle being inverted to expose the genital
disc. Discs were stained in 0.1% methylene blue (Fisher
Scientific) for 5 minutes and fixed in 1% gluteraldehyde
(Sigma) in 1 × PBS, before being removed from the cuticle
wall and scored for their morphology.
Immunohistochemistry
Antibody staining was performed using the protocol of
[12]. For D. melanogaster and the suite of stalk-eyed fly
species, third instar genital discs were labelled with a 1:20
dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-EN mAb 4F11 antiserum (gift from N. Patel). T. dalmanni eye-antennal discs
from the early pupal stage were labelled with a 1:1000
dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Histone H3

(Ser10) antiserum (Upstate). Labelled discs were
mounted in 90% glycerol and photographed using a
Nikon Coolpix 4500 digital camera attached to a Leica
DMLB microscope. Labelled cells from each eye disc
(excluding the portion of connecting tissue between the
eye and antennal discs) were counted from the photographs.
DNA extraction
Tissue from individual adults or larvae was ground in
TNES (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA,
0.5% SDS), to which Proteinase K (1 mg/ml) was added.
The mixture was incubated overnight at 37°C. 5 M NaCl
was then added and the DNA was precipitated with absolute EtOH.
PCR
X chromosome zygosity levels were determined by genotyping individuals for the X-linked microsatellite loci ms054, ms-125, ms-167 and ms-395 (described in Wright et
al. 2004 and see Table 1) Amplification was performed in
10 μl volume reactions (1 μl template DNA, 0.5 U DNA
polymerase (Abgene), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1.3 mM forward
primer labelled with a fluorescent dinucleotide and 19.7
mM reverse primer). PCR was initiated with a two minute
denaturing step at 94°C, followed by thirty cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 30
seconds and extension at 72°C for 45 seconds. The final
step was a ten minute extension at 72°C. Microsatellite
genotyping was carried out using a 3100 DNA Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems) and analysed with Genescan 3.1.2
software (Applied Biosystems).
