Abstract
Background: Anaemia is the most common haematological complication of HIV and associated with a high morbidity
and a poor prognosis. The pathogenesis of HIV-associated anaemia is poorly understood and may include a direct effect
of HIV on erythropoiesis. In vitro studies have suggested that specific HIV strains, like X4 that uses the CXCR4 coreceptor present on erythroid precursors, are associated with diminished erythropoiesis. This co-receptor affinity is
determined by changes in the hypervariable loop of the HIV-1 envelope genome. In a previous case-control study we
observed an association between HIV and severe anaemia in Malawian children that could not be fully explained by
secondary infections and micronutrient deficiencies alone. We therefore explored the possibility that alterations in the
V1-V2-V3 fragment of HIV-1 were associated with severe anaemia.
Methods: Using peripheral blood nucleic acid isolates of HIV-infected children identified in the previous studied we
assessed if variability of the V1-V2-V3 region of HIV and the occurrence of X4 strains were more common in HIVinfected children with (cases, n = 29) and without severe anaemia (controls, n = 30). For 15 cases bone marrow isolates
were available to compare against peripheral blood. All children were followed for 18 months after recruitment.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis showed that HIV-1 subtype C was present in all but one child. All V1-V2-V3 characteristics
tested: V3 charge, V1-V2 length and potential glycosylation sites, were not found to be different between cases and
controls. Using a computer model (C-PSSM) four children (7.8%) were identified to have an X4 strain. This prevalence
was not different between study groups (p = 1.00). The V3 loop characteristics for bone marrow and peripheral blood
isolates in the case group were identical. None of the children identified as having an X4 strain developed a (new) episode
of severe anaemia during follow up.
Conclusion: The prevalence of X4 strains in these young HIV-1-subtype-C-infected children that were most likely
vertically infected and naïve to anti-retroviral therapy can be considered high compared to previous results from Malawi.
It is unlikely that V1-V2-V3 fragment characteristics and HIV co-receptor affinity is an important feature in the
development of severe anaemia in Malawian children.

Background
Anaemia is the most common haematological complication of HIV in adults and children worldwide [1-3] and is
associated with a reduced quality of life and a high morbidity [4]. Inadequate erythropoiesis is generally considered to be the main pathophysiological mechanism of
HIV-associated anaemia [1,5,6]. Despite the obvious
medical importance of anaemia the aetiology of this
erythropoietic failure is still not well understood. Several
possible pathways have been investigated including
opportunistic infections, micronutrient deficiencies and
the more recently identified direct effect of HIV on erythropoiesis [3,7]. The induction of anaemia by specific
strains of HIV is an example of this direct of effect of HIV
[8].
Early in infection the HIV-1 population usually consist of
a strain that has the capacity to bind to both CD4 and the
co-receptor CCR5 (R5 strain)[9,10]. Later in infection a
broadening or switch occurs and HIV evolves to infect
cells expressing CD4 and the co-receptor CXCR4 (R4
strains) [10,11]. This switch is thought to occur in 50% of
infections and is associated with an accelerated loss of
CD4+ T-cells and progression to AIDS [12].
Like the T-helper cells, erythropoietic stem cells express
both CD4 and CXCR4 on their membrane[13,14].
Although productive infection is uncommon in erythroid
precursor cells [3], several in vitro studies have associated
X4 strains with cell death in erythroid and other cell lines
[7,15-17]. Another similarity between T-helper cells and
erythroid cells is the decline in both cell types during disease progression [3,7]. Large studies have suggested that
anaemia might even be a better predictor of mortality
than loss of CD4 cells or HIV load increase [5,18,19]. A
decline of 1 g/dL in the haemoglobin concentration was
associated with a greater increased hazard of death than a
halving of the absolute CD4 count or a log increase in
viral load [18]. The reversal of anaemia, again similar to
an increase in T-helper cells, was associated with a better
life expectancy [18,19]. Despite these similarities to T
cells, no study has evaluated if the decrease in erythrocytes
might be a direct or indirect consequence of an alternated
co-receptor affinity [16].
Co-receptor affinity is a consequence of changes in the
variable loops (V1-V2-V3) of the envelope protein (env) of
HIV-1. Especially a high V3 amino acid charge was found
to be associated to X4 co-receptor affinity [20-24] and several models have been published to predict co-receptor
affinity using V3 data [25-28]. Changes to the V1-V2 fragment appear to be more indirectly linked to X4 affinity
and are increasingly associated with a neutralizing antibody escape [29-37]. These changes include an increased
number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in V1-V3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/26

[30-35] and possibly an extended length of the (V1-)V2
fragment [29,36,37].
In a recent case-control study we found a strong association between HIV and severe anaemia in African children
[38]. This association could partly be explained by opportunistic infections with micronutrient deficiencies playing
only a modest role. After correction for this an independent association remained which can be explained by a
direct effect of HIV on erythropoiesis. We hypothesized
that the occurrence of X4 strains and other alterations of
the hypervariable loops V1-V2-V3 of the HIV-1 env
genome would be associated with severe anaemia. Using
nucleic acid isolates of HIV-infected children with (cases)
and without (controls) severe anaemia we assessed the
prevalence of: (1) high V3 and total V1-V2-V3 amino acid
charge; (2) an extended V1-V2 length; (3) an increase of
potential N-linked glycosylation sites of the V1-V3 and V3
fragments; (4) a HIV-1 subtype C position specific scoring
matrix (C-PSSM) that predicts co-receptor usage[25].

Methods
In two hospitals in southern Malawi we recruited two
groups of children aged 6–60 months into a case-control
study on severe anaemia (Haemoglobin concentration < 5
g/dL) as previously described [38]. In short, a severely
anaemic child requiring a blood transfusion (Case, Haemoglobin concentration < 5 g/dL) was recruited at presentation to hospital alongside two controls (Haemoglobin
concentration ≥ 5 g/dL). One control was recruited from
apparently healthy residents living within proximity of
the case-patient (Community Control, CC) the other randomly selected at the outpatient department (Hospital
Control, HC). On enrolment, a standardized study questionnaire and physical examination were completed, and
blood samples were collected. In cases only, a bone marrow aspiration was performed under anaesthesia if the
clinical condition permitted. Nutritional Z-scores were
calculated in EPI info 2000 [39]. 'Wasting' (weight-forheight), applied to children with Z-scores <-2. Children
requiring admission were treated in a study ward. All conditions were managed according to standard protocols.
All three study groups (cases, HC and CC) were actively
followed at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. In addition, children were passively followed by asking guardians to
return to study clinics whenever the child was sick. During
follow-up visits clinical data was collected and a peripheral blood haemoglobin concentration was determined.
Fully informed consent was obtained from a parent or
guardian in all three study groups. HIV testing was discussed after transfusion for the cases and on a follow-up
visit for controls. The study was approved by the ethics
committees of the College of Medicine, Malawi, and the
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK.

Laboratory tests on site
Haemoglobin was measured on site using a Hemocue system (Angelholm, Sweden). A full blood and reticulocyte
count was performed by Coulter counter (Coulter,
Hialeah, Fla).

C-reactive protein (CRP) was analyzed in heparin plasma
on a Roche p800/p170 system (Roche, Switzerland). HIV
testing was performed using two rapid tests (Determine,
Abbott-Laboratories, Japan; Unigold, Trinity-Biotech, Ireland). Reactive results in children less than 18 months
and discordant outcomes were resolved by PCR. Lymphocyte subsets including CD4 cell counts were measured, during the second year of recruitment, by adding 50
μl of whole blood to TRUECOUNT absolute count tubes
(Becton Dickinson, USA) and incubated with 20 μl MultiTest reagent. After incubation and red cell lysis, the cells
were analysed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow
cytometer and analysed using MultiSet software (Becton
Dickinson, USA). CD4 expressing T-cells were expressed
as percentage of the total lymphocyte population and age
adjusted cut-offs were used to define immunodeficiency[40]. Peripheral blood samples were separated and
aliquots of serum and plasma were stored at -80C for later
testing.
DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
DNA was isolated from the blood and bone marrow samples with a silica-guanidiniumthiocyanate based
method[41]. The target DNA (env gene) was amplified
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a pair of target-specific sense and antisense primers (Figure 1) in a 96well 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, USA). First
a reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed using 10
μl of the eluated nucleic acid solution and Avian Myeloblastosis Virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT, Boehringer
Mannheim) to generate cDNA. Five microliter of the PCR
product was used with Amplitaq (Applied Biosystems,
USA) to amplify the V1-V2-V3 env (810 bp) gene fragment, or in case this failed a combination of nested PCRs
was performed to amplify this region as fragments (primers Figure 1).
Sequencing and cloning
PCR products were directly sequenced with the ABI Prism
Big-dye Terminator v 1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit in an ABI
Prism 377 DNA sequencer using multiple fluorescent dyes
(Applied Biosystems, USA). PCR fragments showing evidence of recombinants or a dual infection were cloned
with TA TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen, USA). For each
sample at least eight clones were sequenced and from
these a consensus sequence was made. All sequences were
manually analysed and assembled with CodonCode
Aligner (version 1.5.2.). Multiple sequences were aligned

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/26

with CLUSTAL W [42] and optimised manually with
BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (version 7.0.1).
Viral Load determination
The HIV-1 viral load in plasma was determined with an
in-house real-time PCR assay, with primers located in the
HIV-1 pol gene. Primer/probe sequences were: upstream
primer 5'TGC ATT YAC CATACC TAG T 3', downstream
primer 5'ATT GCT GGT GAT CCT TTC CA 3', and probe
5'AAA CAA TGA GAC ACC AGG GAT TAG ATA 3'. The
probe was 6-FAM labelled. The detection limit of this
assay was 5 HIV-1 RNA copies per reaction.
Phylogenetic analysis
Genetic subtypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis. The env gene sequence fragments were aligned with
the corresponding reference sequences obtained from the
Los Alamos HIV sequence database [43]. Phylogenetic
reconstruction was carried out with Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 3.0. A
model based upon the Kimura two-parameter model with
pair wise deletion was used. Bootstrap values were based
on a generation of 1000 replicate trees. Newly found
recombinant forms were analysed using Simplot (version
3.5.1.0.) comparing recombinant sequences against a
background of reference sequences.
Potential N-linked glycosylation sites and Amino acid
charges
All protein fragments containing Asparagine (N) and Serine (S) or Threonine (T) that were separated by any third
amino acid (X) other than Proline (P) were counted as a
glycosylation site (N-X-S/T) [44]. All possible glycosylation sites and the amino acid charges were counted for the
V3 and V1-V2-V3 fragment separately.
Subtype C-specific phenotype predictor (C-PSSM)
A C-PSSM predictor is available online [45]. This predictor
is based on the computational techniques presented in
the paper from Jensen and colleagues [25].
Statistics
We compared characteristics of HIV-infected cases to HIVinfected controls using the Fisher exact and Chi-square
test (categorical data) and the t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum
test (continuous data). For 2 × N contingency tables the
Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact test was used. For all tests a
two-sided alpha of <0.05 was used to assess significance.
The tested sample size would be able to detect an odds
ratio of 8 or more assuming an X4 strain prevalence of 8%
in the control population, a power of 80% and an alpha
of 0.05. Analyses were performed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS
inc, USA) and StatsDirect 2.6 (StatsDirect ltd, UK).

Results
Patient Characteristics
The current study was embedded into a larger case-control
study that followed children for an additional 18 months.
That study recruited 381 children with severe and 757
children without severe anaemia over a two year period.
Overall 1039 (91%) parents consented to HIV testing, 57
(5.0%) refused and 42 (3.7%) were lost to follow up

before counselling. Of all children tested 45 (13%) of
severely anaemic cases and 41 (6%) non-severely anaemic
controls were HIV-infected (p < 0.001). These 86 children
formed the current study population and their baseline
characteristics are described in Tables 1 and 2. Haemoglobin levels were lower in cases than controls but reticulocyte counts were not different between the study groups
(p = 0.72). Of all HIV-infected children, cases were more

more wasted, immunodeficient for age and had higher
plasma viral loads. Though the latter two results were only
tested in a subset of children, none of these differences
reached significance (Table 2). During follow-up, HIVinfected children with severe anaemia had a significant
increased mortality (53%) compared to those without
severe anaemia (15%).
Sample Processing
Overall 29 (64%) of HIV-infected cases and 30 (73%) of
HIV-infected controls had samples available for further
analysis of the env fragment (Table 3). For one patient the
PCR failed, resulting in a recovery rate of 98%. For seven
other samples the env fragment could only be partially
amplified (V3 failed: n = 5 and C2 failed: n = 2). Cloning
was needed to determine consensus sequences for 14 samples. In one sample V1-V2 fragment the nucleotide differences were too large between clones, two consensus
sequences were made and separately analysed. However
V3 loops of these clones were found to be identical.
Degenerate base counts were taken into account and were
not different between cases and controls (p = 0.33, Table
3).

erence sequences (bootstrap value: 99%, Figure 2). Only
one child, a child recruited as control, had a new circulating recombinant form that showed similarity with CRF13cpx, which has genomic regions identified as subtypes A,
G, and J [46].
Amino acid charges V fragments
Amino-acid charges of the V3 loop and the total V1-V3
fragment are displayed in Figure 3 and 4 respectively. The
charges of the subtype C isolates ranged from +2 to +5
(V3) and from 1 to +7 (V1-V3) and were not significantly
different between the study groups (p = 0.19 and 0.36
respectively). Higher V3 charges (+5 or more) were found
in four isolates tested (7.7%), all in controls (Table 3).
Additional file 1 shows the amino acid logos for the V3
loop per study group. Alterations of the amino acid in
positions, 5–9, 11 and 25 of the V3 loop were not different (p > 0.2 for all).
Potential N-linked glycosylation sites
All isolates contained one potential N-linked glycosylation site in the V3 loop. The number of potential glycosylation sites on the V1-V3 fragment ranged between 10
and 17 (Figure 5) and was not different amongst cases and
controls (p = 0.75).

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of V1-V2 nucleotide sequences
showed that 57 of 58 isolates clustered with subtype C refTable 3: Variability and predictors of co-receptor affinity per study group.

Length of the V1-V2 fragment
The distribution of the length of the V1-V2 fragment
ranged from 177 to 255 base pairs and is displayed in Figure 6. Mean length for cases was not significantly different
from controls (214 vs. 211 base pairs respectively, p =
0.55).
C-Position Specific Scoring Matrix
C-PSSM scores were used to predict co-receptor affinity for
HIV-1 subtype C strains using V3 loop data. Within our
study X4 tropism was found in 2 of 25 (8.0%) cases and 2
of 27 controls tested (7.4%, p = 1.0, Table 3). Both CPSSM results for the child with two different clones suggested identical co-receptor affinity (CCR5). One of four
children identified with an X4 strain according to this
method had previously received a blood transfusion.

Bone Marrow isolates
Some studies have suggested different compartments of
the body may contain different viral strains. For 15 cases
bone marrow samples were available. Synonymous
changes in the amino acid sequences of the V3 fragments
between bone marrow and peripheral blood isolates were
observed in three children (20%). These patients showed
alterations of amino acid structure at position 25 (n = 2,
both e->d), and 29 (n = 1, n->d), changes that did not
effect the C-PSSM prediction.
Follow-up
After recruitment all children were followed during an 18
month follow-up period as part of this study. During this
follow-up period none of the four children (two cases and
two controls) that were infected with an R4 virus were
diagnosed with a (new) episode of severe anaemia. The
two cases died during follow up at 65 and 182 days from
recruitment from other causes than severe anaemia.

Discussion
Severe anaemia is major cause of morbidity and mortality
in African children [47]. We previously reported that in an
urban environment as many as 21% of children admitted
with severe anaemia were HIV-infected which was more
than twice as prevalent as for the control population. This
association could only partly be explained by more prevalent secondary infections and an additional modest contribution of nutrient deficiencies. A direct effect of HIV on
erythropoiesis was suspected and we assessed if HIV-1
envelope characteristics and co-receptor affinity were
associated with the occurrence of severe anaemia in these
children. In this first study to assess this association using
a case-control design, we found no variations in the
genetic domain of HIV env or the predicted prevalence of
X4 strains between children with and without severe anaemia.
HIV-1 subtype C appeared to be the most prevalent subtype in our sample. Previous reports on adults and children in the region have confirmed that in Malawi HIV-1

subtype C is the most prevalent variant [48,49]. A new
recombinant form was identified in one of the control
children and showed similarities to CRF13-cpx, recently
found in Cameroon [50]. Since this strain is very different
from all other isolates found in Malawi, it might have
spread from Central Africa by the major transports route
running through the rural area in which this was found.
The phylogenetic tree based on the data from the env protein did not show clustering of cases as compared to controls and argues against our hypothesis that specific
strains of HIV would predispose to the development of
severe anaemia. More specifically we assessed V3 amino
acid charge, overall V1-V2-V3 fragment charge, potential
N-linked glycosylation sites on the V1-V2-V3 and the V3
fragments, and V1-V2 length and did not identify any significant difference between HIV-infected children with
and without severe anaemia.
Although much has been published on co-receptor affinity for HIV-1 subtype B, the strain commonly found in

western settings, relatively little is known on HIV-1 subtype C and co-receptor affiliation. Recently Jensen et al.
published a validated algorithm to predict co-receptor
usage in subtype C [25]. This C-PSSM score predicted X4
affinity in four strains, two in each study group.
The X4-strain prevalence of 7.7% in the case and control
groups combined was higher than expected in this predominantly HIV-1 subtype C infected population
[20,48,51,52]. Both studies reporting on co-receptor
usage in Malawian populations did not identify a single
X4-strain in both an adult [52] and paediatric [48] population. Others have published higher prevalences of X4strains in HIV-1 subtype C-infected patients, however
these reports came from Zimbabwe and South Africa and
concerned adults in end-stage HIV infection (17–36%)
[20,51]. Furthermore, this prevalence is remarkable since
most children will have been vertically infected which is
commonly considered to occur by R5 variants [9]. Previous studies have suggested that the occurrence of X4

strains in subtype C infections was associated with the use
of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) [51]. No child was receiving ART at the time of this study.
The link between the occurrence of an X4 strain and disease progression is well studied in HIV-1 subtype Binfected persons. Little data is available concerning this
association in HIV-1 subtype C-infected individuals. Our
results suggest X4 variants are not uncommon in a HIV-1
subtype C-infected population and their survival, especially in the presence of anaemia, may be limited. Therefore more attention should be given to the clinical
importance of the occurrence of this variant in HIV-1 subtype C infected children and adults.
A limitation of our study is that we used indirect measures
to define co-receptor affinity rather than to assess actual
infectivity of cell-lined expressing CXCR4 or CCR5. Since
the C-PSSM method applied had a 94% specificity and
75% sensitivity [25], we might have underestimated X4

tropism in our entire population. Since this underestimation would have affected both our cases and controls it is
unlikely to have had a major impact effect on our findings. We therefore did not pursue assessing our hypothesis
using the more costly and laborious exercise of infecting
cell lines expressing CXCR4 and CCR5. Although our data
cannot fully refute an association between X4 strains and
severe anaemia, X4 tropism is not a major cause of severe
anaemia.
The study had several strengths including the case-control
design and the long term follow-up period. This allowed
a cross-sectional analysis of X4 infected children with a
longitudinal assessment. We hypothesized that the occurrence of an X4 strain would predispose to severe anaemia.
The cross-sectional design used may have been underpowered to detect a difference finding only four X4-infected
children. However none of these four children developed
a new episode of severe anaemia in the longitudinal
study. This may be considered additional evidence against

our hypothesis. Another strong point of the study was the
availability of bone marrow samples in a subgroup of
patients. The similarity of these isolates to those obtained
from the peripheral blood argues against compartmentalisation in the bone marrow and strengthens our findings.

Conclusion
In summary, we assessed whether HIV-1 env characteristics and CXCR4 co-receptor affinity were associated with
the occurrence of severe anaemia in Malawian children. In
this first study assessing clinical relevance we were unable
to find any differences either by phylogenetic analysis and
several tests used to assess co-receptor usage. We identified a relatively high prevalence of X4 strains in these HIV1 subtype C-infected children that were young, most likely
vertically infected and naïve to anti-retroviral therapy.
More attention should be given to the clinical importance
of the occurrence of this variant in HIV-1 subtype C
infected children and adults.
