Abstract
Background: Plants respond to low temperature through an intricately coordinated
transcriptional network. The CBF/DREB-regulated network of genes has been shown to play a
prominent role in freeze-tolerance of Arabidopsis through the process of cold acclimation (CA).
Recent evidence also showed that the CBF/DREB regulon is not unique to CA but evolutionarily
conserved between chilling-insensitive (temperate) and chilling-sensitive (warm-season) plants. In
this study, the wide contrast in chilling sensitivity between indica and japonica rice was used as
model to identify other regulatory clusters by integrative analysis of promoter architecture (ab
initio) and gene expression profiles.
Results: Transcriptome analysis in chilling tolerant japonica rice identified a subset of 121 'early
response' genes that were upregulated during the initial 24 hours at 10°C. Among this group were
four transcription factors including ROS-bZIP1 and another larger sub-group with a common feature
of having as1/ocs-like elements in their promoters. Cold-induction of ROS-bZIP1 preceded the
induction of as1/ocs-like element-containing genes and they were also induced by exogenous H2O2
at ambient temperature. Coordinated expression patterns and similar promoter architectures
among the 'early response' genes suggest that they belong to a potential regulon (ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs
regulatory module) that responds to elevated levels of ROS during chilling stress. Cultivar-specific
expression signatures of the candidate genes indicate a positive correlation between the activity of
the putative regulon and genotypic variation in chilling tolerance.
Conclusion: A hypothetical model of an ROS-mediated regulon (ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs) triggered by
chilling stress was assembled in rice. Based on the current results, it appears that this regulon is
independent of ABA and CBF/DREB, and that its activation has an important contribution in
configuring the rapid responses of rice seedlings to chilling stress.

Background
Transcriptional regulation is an important aspect of the
complex genetic and biochemical networks involved in
plant responses to low temperature. In plants like Arabidopsis that evolved to withstand freezing by cold acclimation (CA), the transcriptional regulatory network is
defined by the interaction between a number of coldresponsive transcription factors and their cognate cis-elements in the promoters of a suite of downstream target
genes [1-4]. The downstream target genes, which are activated in concert not only by low temperature but also by
other related environmental (dehydration, high salinity)
and chemical (abscisic acid or ABA) signals were referred
to as COR for cold regulated, rd for responsive to desiccation, lti for low temperature induced or kin for cold-inducible [5-8]. Evidence supporting the important roles of
COR genes in cellular protection against the common biochemical perturbations caused by low temperature and
dehydration via protein chaperoning (e.g., LEA proteins),
membrane stabilization (e.g., COR15a) and osmotic
adjustment (e.g., Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase) has
been established by transgenic analysis [9-11].

dehydration [18,19]. Thus, the CBF/DREB regulon was
the first example and most prominent regulatory cluster
associated with cold stress in plants.
More recently, global gene expression profiling experiments revealed that a large number of Arabidopsis genes
are responsive to low temperature. Of the more than 500
candidates so far identified, about 60% and 40% were
upregulated and downregulated during CA, respectively
[13,20]. Analysis of the transcriptome of CBF-overexpressing Arabidopsis revealed that the CBF/DREB regulon is a
large cluster comprised of about a hundred CBF/DREBresponsive genes that includes both the known COR genes
as well as many newly identified members. Potential subregulons defined by RAP2.1 and RAP2.6 transcription factors were also identified and presumed to function under
the larger CBF/DREB regulon [10,13]. Furthermore, transcriptome data also revealed that the low temperature
genetic network involves other regulatory clusters in addition to the CBF/DREB regulon. An example of this is the
ZAT12 regulon, which is comprised of more than 20
downstream target genes. Candidate cognate enhancers in
the promoters of ZAT12-target genes have also been identified. Potential target sites of this transcription factor contain the core motif CATTG [1,20].

Molecular dissection of the promoters of several COR
genes of Arabidopsis (e.g., rd29A/lti78/cor78, rd17/cor47,
cor15a, cor6.6/kin2) indicated that they are regulated in an
ABA-dependent or ABA-independent pathway under cold,
dehydration and high salinity conditions. However, their
cold-induced expression is largely through the ABA-independent pathway mediated by highly conserved promoter
cis-elements that function as binding sites for transcriptional activators [6,12]. For example, ABA-responsive
expression of rd29A/lti78/cor78 requires a highly conserved promoter motif PyACGTGGC called ABAResponse Element (ABRE). On the other hand, low temperature, dehydration and high salt- inducible expression
of rd29/lti78/cor78 requires a 9-bp sequence TA(C/
G)CGACAT called C-repeat/Dehydration-Responsive Element (CRT/DRE) that is not independently activated by
ABA alone [8]. Many Arabidopsis genes with ABRE-like and
CRT/DRE-like motifs in their promoters have been identified and these genes have been characterized at least in
terms of their stress-responsive expression [10,13].

Although the precise hierarchical organization of the low
temperature genetic networks is yet to be defined, it
appears that CBF/DREB and ZAT12 pathways (and perhaps other unidentified pathways) constitute a 'super regulon' that configure the overall low temperature stress
tolerance mechanisms in Arabidopsis. These pathways are
further fine-tuned by additional components (e.g., HOS1,
LOS1 and LOS2) either by positive or negative regulation
[21,22]. Related studies involving a global survey of metabolic changes also showed that the CBF/DREB regulon
plays a prominent role in configuring the biochemical status of Arabidopsis during exposure to low temperature
[11,13,20]. Given the evolutionary conservation of CBF/
DREB regulon between temperate and warm-season
plants, all these findings established the prominent role of
this pathway in the cold stress global regulatory networks
of plants in general.

The transcription factor(s) that interact with the ABRE
(AREB or ABF) are bZIP-type proteins that belong to a specific group (Class A) of stress-related bZIP proteins
[14,15]. The activators of CRT/DRE-containing genes
belong to a plant-specific group of AP2/EREBP-type DNAbinding proteins referred to as CBF1/DREB1b, CBF2/
DREB1c, CBF3/DREB1a, CBF4, DREB2A and DREB2
[12,16,17]. Overexpression of either CBF1/DREB1b or
CBF3/DREB1a in Arabidopsis resulted in strong and coordinated activation of the target COR genes, and subsequently CA-independent tolerance freezing and

Many cold-responsive genes containing CRT/DRE-like
promoter elements have also been identified in plants
that do not acclimate to freezing, indicating that various
cold stress response regulatory modules are highly conserved even between chilling-insensitive (temperate) and
chilling-sensitive (warm-season) plants [23-26]. However, despite the current models of the Arabidopsis CA regulatory networks and the identification of functional
homologs of CBF/DREB transcription factors and their
corresponding regulatory modules in rice and other
warm-season plants, the precise composition and hierar-

chical organization of the component pathways of the
global networks in this group of plants is yet to be defined
[27,28].
Indica and japonica rice cultivars exhibit wide contrast in
terms of their sensitivity to chilling. At the seedling stage,
most japonica cultivars survive continuous exposure to as
low as 10°C for up to 7 days better than most indica cultivars. Having a complete genome sequence and a variety
of expression profiling platforms, the japonica rice is an
ideal model to assemble the various component pathways
of the cold stress regulatory networks of chilling-sensitive
plants. Parallel assembly of the homologous networks
involved in regulating the transcriptome in chilling-insensitive (Arabidopsis) and chilling-sensitive (rice) plant models will contribute to the understanding of the
evolutionary changes that led to such differences in low
temperature sensitivity between the two groups of plants.
To contribute to this goal, we performed a semi-global
survey of the chilling stress transcriptome of rice using a
cDNA microarray representing about 6,000 seedlingexpressed genes whose ESTs were enriched in a cold stress
subtracted library [29]. The goal of this initial survey was
to identify the early components of the network through
the identification of a set of co-regulated genes during the
initial exposure to 10°C.
The results of the survey presented here revealed an early
response regulatory cluster that is potentially independent
of the CBF/DREB regulon perhaps activated via reactive
oxygen species (ROS). Although many ROS inducible
genes have been identified in Arabidopsis [30], our knowledge of how these genes are organized into regulatory
clusters lags behind our understanding of the hierarchical
organization of the CBF/DREB and other known regulons.
Here we present evidence of an ROS-mediated regulatory
module that functions as an early component of the chilling stress response pathway in japonica rice based on integrative genomics analysis.

Results
Snapshot of the cold stress early response transcriptome of
rice
Our previous studies showed that the cold stress library
used to assemble the 5,855-feature cDNA microarray was
enriched with candidate chilling-upregulated genes
[23,29]. Analysis of transcript profiles at 0.5, 2, 6, 12, and
24 hours after the initiation of chilling identified 121
unique features (~2% of the total) that were significantly
upregulated in one or more time points at a cut-off level
of 1.8-fold. We refer to this subset of candidates as 'early
response' genes (see Additional files 1 and 2). The cut-off
level was based on the assumption that induction of early
response regulatory genes (transcription factors) occurs at
low to moderate levels. A few representatives of the candidate genes identified from this survey were confirmed by
northern blot analysis (data not shown).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/175

The expression profiles of the 'early response' genes were
grouped according to temporal patterns. Hierarchical
clustering dendogram shows a complex pattern of gene
induction characterized by multiple waves that were
detectable as early as 2 hours after the initiation of chilling
(Figure 1, left panel). In this scheme, many clusters were
established but a meaningful trend was not apparent due
to the small number of member genes in each group. We
further reduced the branch-complexity of the hierarchical
clustering into fewer groups with larger number of member genes by transforming the fold-change values to a
binary data (Figure 1, right panel). In this scheme, genes
with fold-change values at or above the 1.8-fold cut-off
were assigned a value of '1' (green squares) and those
below the cut-off a value of '0' (black squares). This clustering scheme showed that the early response upregulated
genes can be classified into a 'rapid response' (Group-I) or
'slow response' (Group-II) with either sustained or transient
induction. Cold-induced expression of Group-I genes

a sustained or transient induction during the initial 24 hours
under chilling stress (see Additional files 1 and 2 for the list
of genes in each group).

started during the initial 2 hours, while induction of
Group-II genes did not start until after 2 hours. Of the 121
early response genes, 20 and 101 belong to Group-I and
Group-II, respectively (see Additional file 1).
Since our primary goal was to decipher possible 'regulatortarget' gene pairs (regulatory module) that comprise the
'early response' regulon, we first scrutinized the subset of
upregulated genes by searching for candidate transcription factor(s). Of the eight transcription-related genes in
this subset, four appeared to be bona fide DNA-binding
proteins based on characteristic signature domains. Two
of the 'early response' transcription factors (bHLH-type protein – Os01g70310 and bZIP-type protein – Os08g43090)
were rapidly induced during the initial 2 hours of chilling
(Group-I). The bZIP-type protein, which we refer to as
ROS-bZIP1 belongs to the Class-I bZIP that includes the
RF2a and RF2b genes of rice. ROS-bZIP1 has not been
reported previously to be induced by any type of abiotic
stress and it is structurally distinct from the other known
members of the family of stress-related bZIP transcription

factors (Class-A and Class-D) that also include the TGAtype (Figure 2) [15]. The other two 'early response' transcription factors were OsMyb4 (Os04g43680) and an
EREBP1-type protein (Os02g54160) distinct from any
member of the CBF/DREB family. These genes were
induced later (around 6 hours after the initiation of chilling treatment) than ROS-bZIP1 (Os08g43090) and the
bHLH-type protein (Os01g70310), hence classified under
Group-II. Except ROS-bZIP1, all of these transcription factors have been reported previously to be involved in cold
stress either in rice or Arabidopsis based on published data
or EST and genomic annotations [23,31,32].
In addition to the transcription-related genes that comprised about 7% of the total number of 'early response'
genes identified in this survey, other functional categories
were represented as follows: protein synthesis or turnover
(21%), intracellular transport and membrane trafficking
(13%), metabolism of simple and complex carbohydrates
(13%), unknown proteins (11%), stress-related proteins
including disease-related (11%), signal transduction

(7%), growth and development (6%), metabolism of
nitrogenous compounds (4.0%), metabolism of lipids
(3.2%) and others including chromatin-related and cellular energetics (4%). These results suggest that rice seedlings respond rapidly to chilling by modulating cellular
processes related to growth in order to accommodate the
necessary adjustments to the various physiological strains
under sub-optimal temperature condition.
Common regulatory features of 'early response' genes
The distribution of signature motifs of various cis-elements in the promoters of genes with similar expression
profiles often provides corroborating evidence that such
group of genes may in fact be co-regulated by the same or
related groups of transcription factors. With this reasoning, we surveyed the promoter sequences of the 'early
response' genes with the aim of evaluating the relationships among them in terms of the presence of common
sequence motifs with possible function as transcription
factor binding sites. The genomic locus of each candidate
gene in the microarray was identified by aligning the EST
with the Nipponbare reference sequence. BlastN analysis
identified 117 genomic loci with high level of confidence
(e-value of at least 10-40 or in most cases 0).

Initial search for conserved sequence motifs through the
Dragon Motif Builder [33] detected a total of 280 candidates. Motifs obtained in a single run were considered to
be highly relevant to this subset of the chilling stress tran-

scriptome if they were present in at least 50% of the promoters. Under this premise, a total of 140 motifs were
identified and their potential biological significance
inferred by their presence in public promoter databases
[34-36]. The results of these analyses revealed at least sixteen motif families to be most likely associated with the
regulation of the 'early response' genes (Table 1). The
enrichment levels of these motifs were indicated by the evalue and their percentage occurrence in the target promoters relative to the background sequence. These parameters indicate sufficient enrichment of the candidate
motifs in the promoters of the target gene group. The most
significant motifs also matched the core sequences of
known transcription factors associated with abiotic stress
based on established experimental evidence [34-36]. For
instance, as we expected the occurrence of the CRT/DRElike ((C/G)CGAC) core motifs was statistically significant.
A ferritin gene (Os11g01530) that has been previously
reported as a putative CBF/DREB target was among the
'early response' genes that we found to contain the CRT/
DRE [24]. This result was consistent with the expectation
based on previous findings that the CBF/DREB regulon is
activated within the same time period used in the current
experiments [23]. Overall, the result of this analysis was
nearly identical to the results generated by MEME/MAST
and with the motifs detected by manual inspection of representative genes [37]. We concluded that the consensus
motifs identified by the search algorithm(s) are likely

components of the regulatory modules of the early
response transcriptome.
In addition to CBF/DREB modules, two other prominent
regulatory features of the 'early response' genes are highlighted in this report (Tables 1 and 2). First, different types
of Myb-target motifs (MybR) occur at relatively high frequencies. This includes the pyrimidine box, GARE, CAACbox, Myb2-box and GAMyb. The second highly conserved
feature is the prominence of TGACG, GATGA and
TTGATC motifs, many of which are located within the 700 bp regions. TGACG is the signature sequence of the
as1/ocs element that functions as binding site of a TGAtype bZIP transcription factor under various conditions
that induce oxidative stress. Similarly, the GATGA motif is
another known target of a TGA-type bZIP known to
respond to xenobiotic stress, which also involves reactive
oxygen species (ROS). TTGATC is the signature sequence
of W-box found in the promoters of WRKY-target genes,
which are activated by pathogen attack and oxidative
burst. This promoter element has also shown to be regulated by the same group of TGA-type bZIPs that bind to
the as1/ocs elements (as1/ocs-like) [38,39].
Assembly of ROS-mediated regulatory module
Enrichment of the signature sequences of certain families
of regulatory elements (including as1/ocs-like motifs) in
the promoters of the 'early response' group of genes (Tables
1 and 2) established a rationale that these genes are possible components of a certain regulatory cluster of the early
response transcriptome. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we performed detailed examinations of a representative subset of Group-I and Group-II genes in order to
determine how they may be associated to each other in
terms of possible 'cause and effect' type of relationships.

gene induction were compared within each group by
quantitative PCR (qPCR), and similarities and differences
in expression patterns were correlated to the distribution
and enrichment of putative promoter cis-elements. The
general premise is that the expression of a given transcription factor precedes the induction of its downstream regulatory cluster, and that such cluster contains a consensus
element as binding site for the common transcriptional
activator.
We have also shown in our previous report that the cultivars CT6748-8-CA-17 (japonica) and INIAP12 (indica)
exhibit a wide contrast in chilling sensitivity with the
former being more tolerant than the latter [23]. We reasoned that comparing the activity of the putative regulatory cluster between these two cultivars should provide
further justification for the potential significance of the
predicted regulatory cluster to genotypic variation in chilling tolerance. We examined all four transcription factors

each treatment time points. Relative expression values are

correlated with genotypic variation in chilling tolerance (tolerant – CT6748-8-CA-17; intolerant – INIAP12). Early induction of the ATP synthase-like protein and auxin-induced

whose induction within the initial 2 hours was evident
only in the qPCR data. Based on these results, the composition of Group-I was redefined to include these two genes
in addition to ROS-bZIP1 and the bHLH-type transcription factors (Figure 3A). In CT6748-8-CA-17, all four
genes were activated early as shown by their induction
peaks within the initial 2 hours. Transcript levels
remained significantly higher than basal (control) levels
during the entire 24 hours of exposure to chilling. ROSbZIP1 also had a second induction peak that occurred at
the end of the 24 hours exposure to chilling. In contrast,
expression levels of the representative Group-I genes in
INIAP12 were generally several fold lower, less robust,
and delayed compared to CT6748-8-CA-17. These patterns were reproducible in multiple tests with independent replicates. Analysis of the promoter structures (-1,000
bp region) of this representative subset of Group-I genes
based on the Nipponbare reference sequence showed a
prominence of MybR motifs (different types combined)
within the -600 bp region (Figure 3B). Chilling tolerance
of Nipponbare is comparable to CT6748-8-CA-17 and its
expression signatures for the Group-I genes including
ROS-bZIP1 and bHLH-type transcription factors were also
very similar to CT6748-8-CA-17 (data not shown). The
as1/ocs-like sequences also occurred in this group of
genes but the enrichment level was not as significant as
the MybR-related sequences.
The qPCR expression profiles of the representative subset
of Group-II genes that include two transcription factors
(OsMyb4 and an EREBP1-type protein) and three nontranscription factors (HMG protein, ferritin, and putative
ATP sulfurylase) confirmed that their cold induction
occurred at much slower pace than the Group-I genes.
Nevertheless, the differential expression patterns of
Group-II genes between CT6748-8-CA-17 and INIAP12
were very similar to the cultivar patterns observed on the
Group-I genes (Figure 4A). For instance, CT6748-8-CA-17
exhibited steady increases in the expression of all five
genes from the onset of chilling and reached the highest
level at 24 hours. In contrast, activity of the Group-II
genes in INIAP12 was several fold lower compared to
CT6748-8-CA-17 at all time points, thus cold induction in
this cultivar was much weaker and in some cases appeared
transient. These patterns were quite reproducible in multiple tests with independent replicates.
Apart from the fact that the representative subset of
Group-II genes exhibit similar temporal induction patterns, ab initio analysis of their promoters based on the
Nipponbare reference sequence showed another common
feature, defined by the presence of two closely related signature sequences characteristic of the as1/ocs element and
W-box/as1/ocs-like element. Either or both of these signature sequences were found at least within the -800 bp

region of this representative subset of Group-II genes (Figure 4B, Table 1). Among the motif families detected on
the Group-II promoters, which include CRT/DRE, G-box,
GCC-box, ABRE and various types of MybR, the as1/ocslike motifs were the most prominent (consensus). This

enrichment is suggestive of a role of these putative elements in the regulation of these genes.
Because TGA-type bZIP transcription factors are known to
bind to as1/ocs-like motifs [38,40], we hypothesized that
between the two transcription factors (ROS-bZIP1 and
bHLH-type) that were rapidly induced and differentially
expressed between CT6748-8-CA-17 and INIAP12, ROSbZIP1 was the more likely regulator of the as1/ocs-like element-containing Group-II genes. We tested this possibility by examining the patterns of sequential induction of
ROS-bZIP1 and representative subset of as1/ocs-like element-containing Group-II genes by integrating the qPCR
expression profiles shown in Figures. 3A and 4A in a composite time-course model (Figure 5). This model showed
that ROS-bZIP1 expression preceded the induction of
Group-II genes as shown by a major induction peak in
CT6748-8-CA-17 within the initial 2 hours. The induction
peaks of the Group-II genes were evident only after
approximately 6 hours and most of the genes reached
their highest expression levels at the end of the 24 hours
period. This trend suggests that such induction was a
likely consequence of the expression of a transcription factor at least during the initial 6 hours. These sequential patterns of induction appeared to occur proportionately with
respect to the expression differences observed between
CT6748-8-CA-17 and INIAP12.
Based on the relationships suggested by the combined
analysis of induction profiles and promoter motif enrichment, it appears that ROS-bZIP1 and the as1/ocs-like ele-

ment-containing Group-II genes are likely components of
a possible regulatory cluster (ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs regulatory module). Because as1/ocs-like elements are known to
play important roles in ROS-responsive gene expression
[30,38,41], we reasoned that the functionality of the predicted regulatory module in relation to a possible ROSmediated signaling can be further justified by demonstrating that the different components of the module can
indeed be induced by exogenous ROS. With this reasoning, we studied the effect of exogenous sub-lethal levels of
H2O2 in the absence of cold stress on the expression of the
putative ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs regulatory module.

(OsMyb4, high mobility group (HMG) protein, ferritin, and ATP sulfurylase). Rice seedlings (CT6748-8-CA17) were subjected to a continuous 2 hours treatment with 1
mM H2O2. Transcript levels of H2O2-treated and nontreated (control) seedlings were monitored at specific time
intervals during the 2 hours continuous H2O2 treatment and
another 10 hours after the removal of the exogenous H2O2.
Known H2O2-responsive gene that contains as1/ocs elementlike motifs in its promoter (catalase) and a non-H2O2responsive gene that do not contain as1/ocs-like motifs in its
promoter (germin) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Transcript levels at each time point were
normalized against the expression of constitutively expressed
actin gene. Relative expression of control (0 hour; not shown
in the graph) was set to zero by subtracting from the relative
expression values of each treatment time points. Relative
expression values are averages of independent replicates (n =
3; ± SE).

Results of the quantitative analysis of gene induction by
exogenous H2O2 are summarized in Figure 6. The expression profile of a known H2O2-responsive catalase gene
(Os03g03910) that contains as1/ocs-elements in its promoter showed that exogenous H2O2 at a concentration of
1 mM was sufficient to cause a detectable increase in transcript abundance from the basal level within just 2 hours
of treatment. This catalase gene was also induced by chilling based on 'unreplicated' microarray data and northern
blot (data not shown). In a parallel analysis of a negative
control, the expression of a gene that does not contain
as1/ocs-like element in its promoter (germin –
Os08g08970) in the presence of exogenous H2O2 was not
significantly different from the basal expression level in
the absence of exogenous H2O2.
Of the two Group-I transcription factors, only ROS-bZIP1
showed significant H2O2-induced increase in transcript
levels (Figure 6), while exogenous H2O2 had negligible
effects on the expression of the bHLH-type transcription
factor (data not shown). The expression profile of ROSbZIP1 was characterized by a steady increase in transcript
abundance during the 2 hours of treatment with 1 mM
H2O2 and an immediate drop upon the removal of exogenous H2O2. Under the same experimental condition, all
of the as1/ocs-like element-containing Group-II genes
tested (OsMyb4, HMG protein, ferritin, and putative ATP
sulfurylase) exhibited expression profiles similar to that of
ROS-bZIP1. The positive control catalase also showed the
same response to the removal of exogenous H2O2, which
confirmed that the observed induction in the expression
of the candidate ROS-regulated genes are indeed direct
effects of exogenous H2O2 (Figure 6).
The results of the H2O2-induction experiment were consistent with the hypothesis that the representative 'early
response' genes represent a potential regulatory cluster that
responds to both low temperature and ROS (H2O2 in particular). Given the degree of enrichment of the as1/ocslike motifs among the 121 candidate genes, this relationship is probably applicable to any member of Group-II
genes with similar promoter architecture. These interpre-

tations are of course subject to further confirmation with
more direct experimental evidence involving microarray
analysis of H2O2-treated and untreated rice seedlings and
direct protein-DNA binding studies.
We established based on the integrative analysis of
genomics data that the 'early response' transcriptome associated with chilling stress (in rice at least) involves ROSmediated gene expression. Abscisic acid (ABA) is another
key signal in abiotic stress response signaling in plants
and its associated pathway has known linkages with other
regulatory groups like the CBF/DREB regulon [8]. To further explore whether other chemical signals in addition to
ROS (H2O2) were also involved in the activation of the
putative ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs regulatory module, we examined the effect of exogenous ABA on the expression of rep-

Chilling-induced physiological imbalance leads to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells
[42-45]. In particular, H2O2 is generated rapidly under
stress conditions either by enzymatic means (plasma
membrane NADPH oxidase, cell wall peroxidase, amine
oxidase) or by the normal metabolic routes in the chloroplast (Mehler reaction) and mitochondria (electron transport and photorespiration). Steady state levels depend on
the balance between synthesis and degradation, which is
facilitated by the ROS-scavenging system of the cell [44].
With a subset of experimentally validated chilling- and
H2O2-responsive genes, we inferred possible regulatory
relationships among a group of genes that were induced
in coordinated manner within a short time window during the initial stages of exposure of rice seedlings to 10°C.
We hypothesized that the early response transcriptome
might involve reactive oxygen species (ROS) via ROSmediated gene expression defined by the as1/ocs-like promoter elements. Microarray data supports an elevated
ROS level in rice seedlings during such period by virtue of
the upregulation of ROS scavengers such as catalase,
ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and
superoxide dismutase. Transcript levels of these genes
were significantly higher than the control levels based on
the combined results of microarray, northern blot and RTPCR analyses (data not shown). Additionally, our current
data indicated that a mechanism for effective reduction of
the rate of the Fenton reaction is activated during the initial 24 hours based on chilling- and H2O2-induced expression of a ferritin gene (Os11g01530). The Fenton reaction
is responsible for the conversion of H2O2 to more potent
hydroxyl radicals via a Fe2+-requiring chemical reaction.
Thus, the functional significance of the observed induction of ferritin expression can be explained in terms of its
function in Fe2+ sequestration, which would then limit the
rate by which unsuccessfully scavenged H2O2 (which
could occur during periods of oxidative burst) would be
converted to hydroxyl radicals [46].
It has been established that H2O2 plays a very important
role in mediating signal transduction in response to both
abiotic and biotic stresses in plant cells. H2O2 diffuses rap-

Hypothetical model of the ROS-mediated gene regulon involved in early responses to chilling in rice and its possible relationHypothetical model of the ROS-mediated gene regulon involved in early responses to chilling in rice and its
possible relationship with the CBF/DREB and ABA-mediated regulons. The proposed hierarchical organization of the
as1/ocs regulatory cluster is shown in pathway-1. An unknown Myb is expressed constitutively and perhaps activated by change
in redox state that is mediated by chilling stress-induced elevation of intracellular ROS. The ROS-activated Myb regulates the
transcription of a low temperature-inducible bZIP-type transcription factor that functions as transcriptional activator of as1/
ocs-like element-containing genes. A possible alternative or complementary route for regulating the as1/ocs-like element-containing genes is via a constitutively expressed Myb protein (dotted arrow). Pathway-2 shows a general overview of the CBF/
DREB and ABA-mediated regulons involved in low temperature and dehydration stress response in plants [1, 2, 3, 4]. This
hypothetical model proposes that some members of the putative ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs regulatory module might also be regulated

idly from its site of synthesis within subcellular microdomains depending on concentration and it can transmit
intracellular signals to the nucleus by oxidizing various
upstream components of the signaling pathway including
protein kinases (MAPK cascades), protein phosphatases,
transcription factors and membrane-bound calciumchannels. The end response is change in gene expression
[47-49]. Although many ROS-inducible genes have been
identified in Arabidopsis [30], direct involvement of an
ROS-mediated regulatory module in the low temperature
transcriptional networks has not been studied to the same
level as the CBF/DREB regulon had been scrutinized in
Arabidopsis.
We assembled a hypothetical model of the ROS-mediated
regulon and we propose a hypothesis on its potential relationship with other major regulon(s) involved in low
temperature response of the chilling-tolerant japonica

rice. Our working hypothesis described in this model is
that gene expression during the initial 24 hours at 10°C
can be defined (at least partially) in terms of a regulatory
cluster (transcription factor-target gene module) that
appears to be independent of the CBF/DREB and ABAmediated regulons (Figure 8). The downstream components of this regulatory module (pathway-1 in Figure 8)
contain either the prototype as1/ocs element, which is a
known target of TGA-type bZIP transcription factors, or
the related W-box that is known to bind to TGA-type bZIP
and WRKY transcription factors or both. These elements
are known to be activated in response to various conditions that trigger the production of excess ROS (particularly H2O2) including biotic, abiotic and xenobiotic
stresses. Genes that contain these promoter elements have
also been shown to be induced by exogenously supplied
H2O2 and other chemical signals such as salicylic acid and
auxin [31,38,39,50-52].

We also confirmed that a representative subset of 'early
response' genes containing as1/ocs-like promoter elements
were responsive to exogenous H2O2. Based on the percentage of occurrence and enrichment level of the as1/ocslike elements, we predict that about 80% of the 'early
response' genes that we identified in the semi-global microarray survey are probably responsive to exogenous H2O2
hence potential members of this regulatory cluster. The
specific ferritin gene (Os11g01530) that was profiled in
this study was an interesting example of a potential target
of regulation by H2O2. We have shown that this ferritin
gene not only contains as1/ocs-like promoter elements
but it was also induced by exogenous H2O2. Ferritin is also
directly related by function to H2O2 metabolism by virtue
of its role in the regulation of the Fenton reaction [46]. In
addition to ferritin, many of the genes that we identified
in this group have also been shown to be responsive to
exogenous H2O2 in Arabidopsis [30]. The downstream target cluster of the proposed ROS-mediated regulon also
includes a number of transcription factors such as OsMyb4
and an EREBP1-type protein, suggesting the possible
occurrence of other secondary regulatory clusters under
this regulon. This layered organization appears to be consistent with the fact that the ROS-mediated regulon is an
'early response' mechanism that may be functioning as an
initial trigger to a more complex transcriptional network
involved in cellular defenses against the physiological
injuries caused by chilling.
We hypothesized that a bZIP-type protein is the most
likely component of the ROS-mediated pathway
upstream to the as1/ocs-like element-containing genes
based on the known fact that this family of elements is
involved in the recruitment of TGA-type bZIP factors in
the promoters of target genes [40]. Based on the composition of the 'early response' regulatory cluster that we have
assembled, this likely regulator is a novel Class-I bZIP protein (ROS-bZIP1) that is distinct from the family of known
stress-related bZIP transcription factors (Class A). This
class of bZIP proteins is quite diverse in function that
includes those that are involved in the regulation of vascular development. Recently, some of the members of this
class have also been shown to be involved in the development of symptoms to the rice tungro disease [15,53,54].
The significance of this classification with respect to our
proposed role of ROS-bZIP1 is unclear at this point but
can be explained with better understanding or confirmation of the function of ROS-bZIP1 during chilling stress.
We have a good rationale to hypothesize that ROS-bZIP1
is a likely regulator of the as1/ocs-like element-containing
genes based on several peculiar features. First, the timing
of expression of ROS-bZIP1 is consistent with being an
upstream regulator of a cluster of co-regulated genes. For
instance, among the 'early response' transcription factors

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/175

identified in this study, only ROS-bZIP1 showed an induction peak within the initial 2 hours and it was also
induced by exogenous H2O2. The other transcription factors were either induced by chilling at a much later period
(same time period as the as1/ocs-like element-containing
genes) or not induced by exogenous H2O2 or both. Based
on the differential expression analysis of the chilling-tolerant and intolerant rice cultivars, the timing of expression of the as1/ocs element-containing genes appeared to
be a consequence of the early induction of ROS-bZIP1
(i.e., ROS-bZIP1 precedes the as1/ocs-like element-containing genes). Additionally, we also revisited the original
EST libraries used in the assembly of the microarray and
we confirmed that ROS-bZIP1 and many of the as1/ocs
element-containing genes (ferritin, HMG protein, and
putative ATP sulfurylase) were co-represented in the same
cold stress subtracted EST library but not in the drought
stress EST library, consistent with their parallel expression
in the microarray. This information provided additional
circumstantial evidence in support of our hypothesis that
ROS-bZIP1 and the as1/ocs element-containing genes are
most likely related in a regulatory context. Induction of
ROS-bZIP1 by exogenous H2O2 indicates that this gene is
a direct target of an ROS-activated upstream component.
The second rationale is that ROS-bZIP1 is differentially
regulated between tolerant and intolerant rice cultivars
and its early and robust expression appeared to be positively correlated with chilling tolerance. It appears that
timely expression of ROS-bZIP1 is one of the initial triggers leading to the activation of the early transcriptome
that plays critical roles in the initial physiological adjustments and configures subsequent defenses.
We also acknowledge the possibility that co-expression of
ROS-bZIP1 and as1/ocs-like element-containing genes
could be a mere coincidence, and that they are in fact not
directly related in the context of a regulator and downstream target module. This is a possibility that we cannot
ignore completely because of the fact that the microarray
that we used in the survey consisted of only about 15% of
the total genes encoded by the rice genome. There is a possibility that the regulator of the as1/ocs-like element-containing genes was not represented in the miroarray. Our
on-going studies that include the analysis of the chilling
stress transcriptome using a 45,000-oligonucleotide
microarray representing the entire set of rice genes and in
vitro binding of ROS-bZIP1 to the as1/ocs-like sequence
will address this issue.
ROS-bZIP1 (or any of its homologs in other plants) has
not yet been characterized in terms of its potential role in
chilling tolerance. With the presumed large size of the
putative ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs regulatory module, functional analysis of ROS-bZIP1 offers an opportunity to
reveal another important switch of cold stress gene expres-

sion that has not been previously examined in detail in
Arabidopsis. A cautionary note is that at this point the predicted regulatory relationship between ROS-bZIP1 and
the as1/ocs element-containing genes awaits further confirmation by promoter deletion-reporter analysis, and
direct protein-DNA binding assays such as gel-shift, yeast
one-hybrid or chromatin immunoprecipitation. Nevertheless, the regulatory module that we inferred through an
integrative genomics approach provides a strong justification for future use of these candidate genes as prototype
model for further dissection of the early response ROSmediated gene regulon by genome-wide transcriptome
analysis of transcription factor-overexpressing or knockout lines.
We found that the upstream regions (-1,000 bp) of the
Group-I 'early response' genes were enriched with potential
Myb-target (MybR) motifs. ROS-bZIP1 in particular contains three CAAC-type and three other types of MybR
motifs, suggesting a possibility that the next component
upstream to this gene in the ROS-mediated pathway is
probably a Myb-type transcription factor. Constitutively
expressed transcription factors could be direct targets of
ROS [55]. An H2O2-sensitive Myb protein is the most
likely direct link of the putative ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs regulatory module to the chilling induced-H2O2 signal possibly by activating such protein. Evidence showed that
constitutively expressed Myb proteins are activated by
redox state-mediated conformational changes in their
DNA-binding domains [56]. This could be one possible
way by which H2O2 activates a putative upstream Myb
protein that regulates the expression of ROS-bZIP1. Alternatively, an inactive Myb protein may be activated
through phosphorylation by an upstream kinase that is
sensitive to H2O2. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration may be involved in this activation [57]. Either way,
a bZIP-type transcription factor appears to be the most
upstream component that is regulated at the transcriptional level by an ROS-activated Myb protein (pathway-1
in Figure 8).
Another interesting feature of the as1/ocs-like elementcontaining genes is the significant occurrence of MybR
motifs (different types combined) in their promoters. For
instance, all five genes studied in detail by qPCR including
those that were confirmed to be induced by exogenous
H2O2 (OsMyb4, EREBP1-type transcription factor, HMG
protein, ferritin, and putative ATP sulfurylase) contain different types of MybR motifs. However, unlike the as1/ocs
and W-box elements, which are very closely related
(nearly identical in sequence), there was no obvious consensus MybR motif found in the promoters of this group
of genes. Nevertheless, it is likely that the as1/ocs-like element-containing genes might also be regulated through a
secondary route, perhaps involving a possible MybR ele-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/175

ment and a constitutively expressed but ROS-activated
Myb similar to the proposed regulation of ROS-bZIP1. In
this case, the chilling- and H2O2-induced expression of
this group of genes may be the result of the interaction
between as1/ocs-like and certain MybR elements. The
slight variation in expression profiles among the Group-II
genes examined may be attributable to the potential interaction between as1/ocs-like and certain MybR elements.
Alternatively, since all the as1/ocs-like element-containing genes examined by qPCR had significant basal expression level (constitutive level) but highly induced by
chilling, the occurrence of certain MybR motifs may be
related to a possible modulator function or potential
determinants of the basal expression of this specific group
of genes.
A number of genes that belong to the proposed ROS-bZIP
– as1/ocs regulatory module also contain CRT/DRE-like
motifs in their promoters. An example of this is ferritin
(Os11g01530), which has been reported as a putative
CBF/DREB target [24]. Previously, we also reported a
sequential activation of CBF/DREB homolog and CRT/
DRE-containing gene (OsLti6a) in CT6748-8-CA-17 during the initial 24 hours at 10°C [23]. Both ferritin and
OsLti6a had genotype-specific expression profiles
(CT6748-8-CA-17 vs. INAP12) that were very similar to
the patterns of the representative Group-II genes. Therefore, ferritin and OsLti6a represent a group of genes that
are potentially regulated by both an ROS-responsive bZIP
and CBF/DREB transcription factors (pathway-2 in Figure
8). This result suggests a potential link between the ROSmediated and CBF/DREB regulons through common
downstream target genes. Promoter motif distribution
data also showed that less than 40% of the 'early response'
genes identified in this study contain both as1/ocs element and CRT/DRE in their promoters (at least within the
-500 region), suggesting that the overlap between these
two regulons is probably not that extensive. Comparative
microarray analysis of transgenic lines overexpressing
ROS-bZIP1 and CBF/DREB is currently underway to
address this hypothesis.
ABA signaling has known linkages with ROS-mediated
signaling [41,49]. However, based on our current results it
does not appear that the putative ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs regulatory module is directly linked to ABA-mediated pathway at least by virtue of the lack of detectable ABAmediated induction of representative as1/ocs-like element-containing genes. Alternatively, it is possible that
the ROS-mediated regulon is upstream to ABA in the signaling pathway. More detailed analysis of the effect of
exogenous ABA on a larger set of confirmed H2O2-responsive genes is required to validate these hypotheses.
Genome-wide microarray survey is also currently underway to address this hypothesis.

Conclusion
Rice is sensitive to even mild cold stress (chilling) particularly at the early stages of seedling establishment. However, japonica cultivars are generally more tolerant than
most indica cultivars. Studies aiming to dissect the regulatory networks that define the mechanism by which the
responses of a chilling-sensitive plant like rice might differ
from the responses of chilling-insensitive plants are just in
the early stages. Based on the analysis of a subset of candidate genes, we hypothesized that the early response transcriptome has an important role in the short-term
defenses, which are crucial to the survival of a chillingsensitive plant like rice under above-freezing temperature
conditions.
In this study, we have established the rationale that ROS
is involved in the early branches of the chilling stress
response transcriptional network of rice. We have identified the components of a putative ROS-mediated regulatory module by an integrative analysis of genomics data.
We propose that ROS regulates an important component
of early response transcriptome by mediating the rapid
induction of a group of as1/ocs-like element-containing
genes, hence ROS-dependent regulon. We also hypothesized that this regulon is probably independent of the
CBF/DREB or ABA-mediated regulons in rice. The putative
ROS-bZIP – as1/ocs regulatory module is currently being
validated by biochemical and genetic tests. Given the rapidly growing functional genomics resources for rice, our
next step is also to validate the putative regulatory module
described in this report with the use of mutants and overexpression lines. Physiological experiments are currently
underway to compare the intracellular ROS levels
between japonica (chilling tolerant) and indica (chilling
intolerant) rice seedlings during the initial 24 hours of
chilling.

Methods
Plant materials, growth conditions, and stress treatments
Two rice cultivars that exhibit contrasting sensitivity to
chilling (CT6748-8-CA-17, tolerant; INIAP12, intolerant)
were used in this study [23]. Mature, non-dormant seeds
were sterilized in 30% ethanol, rinsed in sterile water and
allowed to germinate in 1.5% agar or moist filter paper.
Seedlings were allowed to grow to S3 stage for 8 to 10 days
at 29°C (± 1°C). For the cold stress treatment, S3-stage
seedlings on agar plates were placed in a growth chamber
(Percival Model E-30BHO, Percival Scientifc, Perry, IA)
maintained at a constant temperature of 10°C (± 1°C),
continuous light (73 μmol sec-1m-2) and 50–60% RH for
the 24 hour duration of the experiment. Control seedlings
were grown under the same condition but at 29°C (±
1°C).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/175

ABA and H2O2 treatments were performed under the same
temperature and light conditions as the control experiment. ABA treatment was performed by placing S3-stage
seedlings on 4 layers of filter paper soaked in 100 μM
ABA. H2O2 treatment was performed by placing S3-stage
seedlings on four layers of filter paper soaked in 1 mM
H2O2 for 2 hours and then transferring them back to layers of water soaked filter paper for another 10 hours
(pulse-treatment). In both ABA and H2O2 experiments,
control seedlings were grown on four layers of watersoaked filter paper. Total RNA was isolated from frozen
shoot tissues with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Microarray analysis
A cDNA microarray was assembled by the Michigan State
University Genomics Technology Support Facility (East
Lansing, MI). This microarray contains 5,855 features
derived from a unigene set of a subtracted EST library of
cold stressed rice at S3 seedling stage and a normalized EST
library of drought stressed rice plants at booting stage
[29]. Individual microarray features were spotted in duplicate, hence each slide consists of 11,710 spots (technical
replicate) representing 5,855 unique features. The target
RNA samples for microarray hybridization were from
seedlings (S3 stage) of the chilling tolerant cultivar
CT6748-8-CA-17 after 0.5, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours at 10°C.
Separate control RNA from seedlings maintained at 29°C
was used for each stress time point to cancel out potential
developmental effects between control and chilling
stressed seedlings.

Two independent biological replicates were performed for
each pair of control and chilling stress treatments. Equal
amounts of total RNA (20 μg) from chilling stressed and
control seedlings were reverse transcribed and labeled
with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes, respectively, using the CyScribe
post-cDNA synthesis labeling kit (Amersham-GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Microarray slides were hybridized for 16 hr in
humidified chambers maintained at 42°C. Following
hybridization, the microarray slides were subjected to
three-step stringency washes (2X SSC + 1% sarcosyl, 2X
SSC, 0.2X SSC). Gene expression data was acquired by
measuring the fluorescence intensity of each spot at 532
nm (Cy3) and 635 nm (Cy5) with the GenePix Pro 4200
scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The signal
intensity of each spot was expressed as medians of pixels
after background subtraction, i.e., signal minus background (F635 or F532) Median – B635 or B532). Expression
values were normalized so that mean of the ratio of medians of all of the features is equal to 1. This normalization
method is based on the premise that most genes on the
array are not differentially expressed, and therefore the
arithmetic mean of the ratios from every feature on a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/175

given array should be equal to 1. Microarray data can be
accessed at the Gene Expression Omnibus (Acc.
GSE7071).
Microarray data was analyzed using the Acuity Bioinformatics Suite (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The
average signal intensity values of the duplicate spots were
averaged between biological replicates and values were
expressed as a base2 logarithm of the ratio of medians, i.e.,
log2 (F532median-B532)/(F635median-B635). Log ratios
were transformed to fold-change values in subsequent
analyses. Significant change in gene expression was
defined as fold-increase in chilling stress relative to control at or above a cut-off level of 1.8-fold.
Ab initio analysis of promoters
ESTs for all upregulated microarray features were
anchored to the map-based sequence of japonica rice
using the TIGR rice genome browser. The designated
genomic ORF for a feature was identified based on the
closest match in blastN alignment (lowest e-value; in
most cases this is equal to or very close to 0), hence, fea-

tures were subsequently designated by the locus number
of the corresponding genomic ORF. Based on the most
current genome annotation, the transcription start site
(TSS), initiation codon and predicted TATA box of a given
locus were determined. The upstream region of a genomic
locus from the start codon was extracted from the genome
sequence and used for subsequent analysis. Our analysis
of the sequences of few CT6748-8-CA-17 genomic clones
of Group-II genes showed identical sequences with the
Nipponbare reference.
Significantly overrepresented promoter motifs were identified using an ab initio method implemented in the
Dragon Motif Builder program with EM1 and EM2 option
[33]. With the EM1 option the system attempts to extend
or shrink motifs to find the best motif length for a family,
while in the EM2 option all possible motif lengths within
certain range are examined and the best collections of
motifs are selected. Up to 30 motif families were detected
in each run using motif length in the range of 5–10
nucleotides. The threshold values used for detection were
set at 0.85, 0.875, 0.90 and 0.95 from the range of (0, 1).

Since the identification of motif families is heuristic and
influenced by the overall DNA sequence composition, the
variations in the length of the searched regions may influence the type of motifs identified. As we had no prior
information where the motifs of interest could be located,
we experimented with different lengths of promoters covering (-1000, -1), (-1000, +350), (-500, -1), (-500, +350)
and (-500, +200) relative to the TSS. Details of motif families identified are given in the Table 2.
To enhance the detection of stress-related motif families,
promoter sequences of genes not associated with cold
stress were selected at random and used as background or
negative control dataset. The biological significance of the
identified motifs was inferred by their presence in databases such as PLACE [34], TRANSFAC [35], and AGRIS
[36]. Enrichment levels of the candidate motifs were
based on the e-value and percentage of occurrence relative
to the background sequence. The homogeneity of the
motifs in each individual group (total information content) is related to the average binding energy for the collection of sites [58]. The motifs predicted using this
scheme were also compared with the results of similar
analysis using the MEME/MAST System for motif discovery [37].
RNA gel-blot analysis
Equal amounts (20 μg) of total RNA samples from control
and ABA-treated seedlings were fractionated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde gels (Ambion, Austin, TX). The
RNA was blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane
(Amersham-GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) using standard procedures. EST probes were random-prime labeled
with α32P-dCTP using the RediPrime kit (Amersham-GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). RNA gel blot was hybridized
with 32P-labeled probes (Amersham-GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) by standard procedures.
Real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis
Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using oligo-dT
and random primer cocktail and iScript cDNA Synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) following the
manufacturer's instructions. Gene-specific primers for the
control (actin, Os10g36650) and experimental genes
were designed based on the sequences of corresponding
genomic ORF (Table 3). The actin gene was chosen as the
reference based on its constitutive expression in the
microarray and RNA gel blot data. The actin-specific primers were designed to span an exon interrupted by 100-bp
intron. Thus, amplified actin fragments from cDNA and
genomic DNA templates were 120 bp and 220 bp, respectively. This method allowed effective use of the control
actin gene to assess background amplification from
genomic DNA contamination.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/175

Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis of the control
(actin) and experimental genes were performed in at least
three independent replicates using a single color real-time
PCR system with SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Each qPCR cocktail consisted of the
cDNA template (2 μl) and gene-specific oligonucleotide
primers (4 ng/μl) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The
cycling parameters were as follows: cDNA template denaturation at 94°C (20 sec), annealing at primer-specific
temperature (15 sec), extension at 72°C (20 sec) for a
total of cycles, followed by a final extension step at 72°C
(5 min). The qPCR profiles of experimental genes were
normalized relative to the control actin gene expression.
The relative expression of each experimental gene was
based on ΔCT normalized against the reference actin gene
(Bio-Rad PCR Manual, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). The relative expression values of the control (time
point 0 hour) was set to zero by subtracting the values
from the treatment values at all time points.
