Abstract
Background: SIVsmm is a simian immunodeficiency virus that persists efficiently without causing
disease in naturally infected sooty mangabeys (SMs) but induces AIDS upon cross-species
transmission to humans and macaques. Current phylogenetic data indicate that SIVsmm strains
comprise a highly diverse group of viruses that can be subdivided into different lineages. Since only
certain SIVsmm strains have successfully crossed the species barrier to humans and macaques, the
question has been raised whether there are lineage specific differences in SIVsmm biology. In the
present study we examined whether representatives of five different SIVsmm lineages show
differences in the function of the accessory Nef protein, which plays an important role in viral
persistence, transmission and pathogenesis.
Results: We found that nef alleles from all SIVsmm lineages down-modulated CD4, MHC-I, CD28
and CD3 and up-regulated the invariant chain (Ii) associated with immature MHC-II molecules in
human-derived cells. Moreover, they generally suppressed the responsiveness of virally infected T
cells to activation, enhanced virion infectivity and promoted virus replication in human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells. The functional activity of these nef alleles in the various assays varied
substantially between different strains of SIVsmm but quantitative analyses did not reveal any
significant lineage-specific differences in Nef function.
Conclusion: Nef alleles from different lineages of SIVsmm do not require adaptive changes to be
functionally active in human cells. Strain rather than lineage-specific differences in Nef function may
impact the virological and immunological feature of SIVsmm in SMs and possibly affected viral fitness
and pathogenicity in human and macaque hosts.

Background
To date primate lentiviruses have been detected in about
40 African non-human primate species [1,2]. Two of these
viruses, SIVcpz from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (SMs) (Cercocebus atys) have been transmitted to humans and generated
the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) types 1 and
2, respectively [3,4]. SIVcpz strains are known to have
crossed the species barrier on three occasions, generating
HIV-1 groups M, N and O. In contrast, SIVsmm has been
transmitted to humans no fewer than eight times [5,6].
Nonetheless, HIV-2 is much less prevalent than HIV-1,
with only two transmissions (leading to HIV-2 groups A
and B) resulting in significant secondary spread in the
human population [7-9]. The remaining transmissions
appear to have caused dead-end infections affecting only
a handful of individuals [9-11]. SIVsmm was also inadvertently transmitted to captive macaques, generating SIVmac. Currently, experimental infection of macaques with
SIVmac is commonly used as a model for studies of AIDS
pathogenesis and vaccines [12].
SIVsmm exhibits a prevalence of about 60% in the wild
[6] and comprises a genetically highly diverse group of
viruses [13]. Previous studies suggest that different
SIVsmm strains may differ in their fitness and pathogenic
features after cross-species transmission. As mentioned
above, only groups A and B of HIV-2 resulted in epidemics. Furthermore, SIVmac strains differ substantially in
their ability to persist efficiently and to cause disease in
infected rhesus macaques [14,15]. It has been shown that
serial passage of SIVsmm in macaques increases viral
pathogenicity in this experimental host [16,17]. Thus, differences in viral adaptation to human or macaque hosts
may play a role in the ability of this virus to persist and
cause disease after cross-species transmission [18-20].
However, intrinsic differences in viral properties may also
exist. For example, it has recently been suggested that different SIVsmm lineages vary in their ability to cause a significant loss of CD4+ T cells [21] that is observed in about
10 to 15% of the naturally infected SMs [22]. Lineage-specific differences in viral fitness may also have contributed
to the differential spread of the various groups of HIV-2 in
the human population.
One viral factor that plays an important role in the efficiency of primate lentiviral persistence and transmission
is the Nef protein. Nef performs multiple activities, such
as modulation of cell surface expression of CD4, CD28,
class I MHC (MHC-II) and the invariant chain (Ii) associated with immature MHC-II molecules, as well as
enhancement of viral infectivity and replication [23-29].
In addition, most SIV and HIV-2 Nefs also down-modulate CD3, a key component of the T cell receptor (TCR)
complex from the cell surface [30]. It is well established

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/36

that differences in Nef function affect the virological,
immunological and clinical outcome of HIV and SIV
infection [31]. Perhaps most importantly, the lack of a
functional nef gene is associated with very low viral loads
and an attenuated clinical course in HIV-1-infected
humans [32-34] and SIVmac-infected rhesus macaques
[35]. Some HIV-1 and SIVmac strains that contain naturally occurring point mutations or small deletions in Nef
are less virulent [36-39], while other alterations in Nef are
associated with acutely fatal disease in SIV-infected
macaques [40,41]. Recently, it has been shown that inefficient Nef-mediated down-modulation of CD3 and
MHC-I correlates with low CD4+ T cell counts in SIVsmminfected SMs [42].
It has been shown that primary SIVsmm nef alleles are
functionally active in human-derived cells [42,43]. It is
currently unknown, however, whether SIVsmm shows lineage-specific differences in Nef function that may affect
virus replication or pathogenicity. To address this question we performed a comprehensive functional analysis of
nef alleles derived from five different lineages of SIVsmm.
We found that all nef alleles were capable of modulating
cell surface expression of human CD4, CD28, CD3, MHCI and Ii molecules. Furthermore, they enhanced virion
infectivity, promoted viral replication and suppressed the
responsiveness of virally infected T cells to activation.
Although the magnitude of these various Nef functions
varied, we did not find significant lineage-specific differences.

Methods
Animals
Blood samples were collected from seven naturally
infected SMs housed at the Tulane National Primate
Research Center (TNPRC), which represented five different SIVsmm lineages (Ls) based on previous analyses: L1
(M919, M923), L2 (M926, M946), L3 (M949, M951) and
L4 (G932) (summarized in Table 1). One L5 SIVsmm
strain was isolated on SM PBMC from an animal (FTq)
housed at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center
(YNPRC) of Emory University. We also included data
derived from 22 naturally SIVsmm-infected SMs with differential CD4+ T cell counts housed at the YNPRC [42]. All
SMs were maintained in accordance with NIH guidelines.
The identification and characterization of the different
lineages of SIVsmm has been described [13,21].
Nef alleles and proviral constructs
SIVsmm nef alleles were amplified by RT-PCR from the
plasma of seven naturally infected SMs or the supernatant
of an SIVsmm FTq infected SM PBMC culture as described
previously [42]. Splice-overlap-extension PCR was used to
replace the NL4-3 nef gene of HIV-1 (NL4-3 based) proviral constructs carrying functional nef genes followed by an

internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [30] with the bulks of
SIVsmm nef genes [42]. Cloning and transformation efficiencies were determined and the integrity of all PCRderived inserts was confirmed by sequence analysis as
reported previously [42]. For comparison, we also
sequenced the nef coding region of three individual clones
from each of the proviral plasmids expressing bulk
SIVsmm nef alleles. The control HIV-1 NL4-3-IRES-eGFP
constructs expressing the NL4-3, NA7 and SIVmac239
Nefs or containing a disrupted nef gene (nef-) and the
amplification and functional analysis of nef alleles from
22 naturally SIVsmm-infected SMs housed at the YNPRC
have been reported previously [42].
Cell culture and virus stocks
Jurkat and 293T cells were cultured as described previously [30]. Briefly, 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum. PBMC from healthy
human donors were isolated using lymphocyte separation
medium (Biocoll Separating Solution, Biochrom), stimulated for 3 days with PHA (1 μg/ml) and cultured in
RPMI1640 medium with 10% FCS and 10 ng/ml IL-2
prior to infection. To generate viral stocks, 293T cells were
transfected either with the proviral HIV-1 constructs alone
(to measure viral infectivity or replication) or cotransfected with a plasmid (pHIT-G) expressing the Vesicular
Stomatitis Virus G protein (VSG-G) for flow cytometric
analyses [44]. The medium was changed after overnight
incubation and the virus was harvested 24 h later. Residual cells in the supernatants were pelleted and the supernatants were stored at -70°C. Virus stocks were quantified
using a p24 antigen capture assay provided by the NIH
AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.
Transduction and flow cytometry
Jurkat T cells or PBMC were transduced with HIV-1 (NL43) constructs coexpressing eGFP and various nef alleles
and CD4, TCR-CD3, MHC-I, CD28, CD25, CD69 and
eGFP expression was measured as described [30,42]. For
quantification of Nef-mediated modulation of specific
surface molecules, the levels of receptor expression (red
fluorescence) were determined for cells expressing a specific range of eGFP. The extent of down-modulation (nfold) was calculated by dividing the MFI obtained for cells
infected with the nef-minus NL4-3 control viruses by the
corresponding values obtained for cells infected with
viruses coexpressing Nef and eGFP.
NFAT assay
Jurkat cells stably transfected with an NFAT-dependent
reporter gene vector [45] were either left uninfected or
transduced with HIV-1 Nef/eGFP constructs expressing
various nef alleles. Except for those cells used as controls,
cultures were treated with PHA (1 μg/ml; Murex). Luci-

ferase activity was measured and n-fold induction determined by calculating the ratio between measured relative
light units of treated samples over untreated samples as
described previously [30].
Viral infectivity
Virus infectivity was determined using P4-CCR5, TZM-bl
and CEM-M7 cells as described [46]. Briefly, the cells were
sown out in 96-well-dishes in a volume of 100 μ1 and
infected after overnight incubation with virus stocks containing 1 ng of p24 antigen produced by transiently transfected 293T cells. Two days post-infection viral infectivity
was detected using the Gal screen kit from TROPIX as recommended by the manufacturer. β-galactosidase activities were quantified as relative light units per second
(RLU/s) using the Orion Microplate Luminometer.
Virus spread in PBMCs
To assess the ability of Nef to promote viral spread, 2 × 105
pre-stimulated PBMC per well were sown out in 48-well
dishes and infected with 293T cell derived virus stocks
containing one 1 ng of p24 antigen. Aliquots of the cells
were obtained at 3, 5 and 7 days post-infection and the
number of virally infected GFP+ cells was determined by
flow cytometric analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis
The nef sequences derived from the different lineages of
SIVsmm analyzed in the present were compared to published SIVsmm nef sequences (accession numbers
AF334679, DQ408682 to DQ408725 and EU636907 to
EU636923). They were aligned using ClustalW [47]. The
tree in Fig. 1 was inferred by the Bayesian method [48] in
MrBayes [49] using 10 million generations and the HKY
model [50] with gamma distributed rates at sites [51] and
burn in of 25%. Average standard deviation of split frequencies (< 0.003) was checked to see that a sufficient
number of generations had been run.
Statistical methods
The activities of nef alleles were compared using a twotailed Student's t test. The PRISM package version 4.0
(Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) was used for all calculations.
GenBank accession numbers
The GenBank accession numbers for the SIVsmm nef
sequences are FJ943640 to FJ943647.

Results
Generation of viral constructs coexpressing Nefs from
different SIVsmm lineages and eGFP
Extensive studies of SIVsmm diversity identified no less
than nine different phylogenetic lineages of this virus in
the animal cohorts housed at the Yerkes and Tulane

National Primate Research Centers [13,21]. To assess
whether SIVsmm shows lineage-specific differences in Nef
function, we cloned nef alleles from 8 animals known to
belong to five different clades based on the analysis of
their gag, pol and env sequences [13,21] in bulk into an
HIV-1 NL4-3-based IRES-eGFP proviral vector co-expressing Nef and eGFP from a bi-cistronic RNA. To generate
these proviral constructs, the 3' end of the HIV-1 env gene
and the SIVsmm nef alleles were fused by splice-overlapextension (SOE) PCR using outer primers containing
unique HpaI and MluI restriction sites and overlapping
inner primers and cloned in bulk into the proviral constructs. As summarized in Table 1, the nef alleles represented SIVsmm lineages 1 (M919, M923), 2 (M926,
M946), 3 (M949, M951) and 4 (G932). Nef genes from an
L5 SIVsmm strain (FTq) were amplified from the supernatant of an infected SM PBMC culture. We found that
sequences obtained by direct analysis of the PCR products
and bulk inserts in the NL4-3-based IRES-eGFP vector
were indistinguishable (data not shown). As further control, we sequenced three individuals' proviral clones for
each of the eight animal samples. We found that all 24
proviral constructs encoded intact nef open reading
frames and that these sequences were closely related to

those obtained by direct sequencing of the corresponding
PCR fragments and formed animal-specific clades for each
of the eight SIVsmm strains. These results verified the
accuracy of the proviral constructs and showed that the
frequency of defective nef alleles is low.
SIVsmm nef sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses showed that the proviral NL4-3
IRES/eGFP plasmid preparations contained highly divergent nef alleles that belonged to distinct clusters (Fig. 1).
Importantly, this analysis demonstrated that all sequences
were animal specific, thus confirming the authenticity of
the amplified nef genes and excluding cross-sample PCR
contaminations. Closer examination of the amplified
sequences showed that all nef genes predicted full-length
proteins of 265 or 267 amino acid residues (Fig. 2). The
N- and C-termini of the SIVsmm Nef amino acid
sequences were highly variable, whereas the central core
region was well conserved. Some domains and protein
interaction sites known to be relevant for HIV-1 function
[52], such as the N-terminal myristoylation signal, an Nproximal basic region involved in membrane targeting, an
acidic region, a di-arginine motif, a "di-leucine-based"
(EXXXLM/V) adaptor-protein interaction site in the C-

Alignment of SIV and HIV-2 Nef sequences. The SIVmac239 sequence is shown in the upper panel for comparison. Some
conserved sequence elements in Nef, including the N-terminal myristoylation signal, N-proximal tyrosines (52–54), PA residues known to be critical for CD4 down-modulation by 239 wt Nef (58), the acidic and proline-rich regions, a diarginine motif,
a C-proximal adaptor-protein (AP) interaction site (52), a diacidic putative VlH binding site and a Y residue involved in MHC-I
down-regulation (52, 56,57) are indicated schematically. Dots indicate identity with the 239 wt Nef sequence and dashes gaps
introduced to optimize the alignment.

proximal flexible loop and a di-acidic putative V1H binding site were preserved in all SIVsmm Nef sequences (Fig.
2). In contrast, N-proximal Y residues, proposed to represent endocytosis signals [53,54], and the "proline-rich"
region, which is highly conserved and involved in the
interaction with cellular kinases in HIV-1 Nefs [55], differed in several SIVsmm Nef sequences. In contrast, Y223,
which is critical for MHC-I down-modulation by SIVmac
Nef [56,57] and residues P73A74 and D204, critical for
CD4 down-modulation and efficient replication of
SIVmac239 [58], were generally conserved at the corresponding position. Altogether, the examination of the nef
sequences from the different clades of SIVsmm did not
reveal any peculiar abnormalities.
Nef alleles from different clades of SIVsmm modulate
human receptors
To compare the potency of nef alleles from different
SIVsmm lineages in down-modulating CD3, CD4, CD28
and MHC-I, and in up-regulating Ii, we transduced
human PBMC with the proviral constructs and analyzed
them by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A). As reported previously
[30], the proviral NL4-3 Nef/eGFP constructs have the
advantage that infected cells co-express Nef and eGFP
from single bicistronic RNAs, thus allowing to correlate
Nef and receptor expression levels (Fig. 3A). To ensure
that the nef alleles were representative for each of the eight
infected SMs investigated, they were cloned in bulk into
the proviral vector and viral stocks were derived from ≥50
independent transformants (data not shown). For comparison, we also analyzed clones expressing an individual
primary SIVsmm nef allele from each animal. The results
confirmed the data obtained from the analyses of Nef
function in bulk (data not shown). As expected, the control HIV-1 NL4-3 construct containing a disrupted nef
gene only affected CD4, since Vpu and Env also reduce its
expression at the surface of infected T cells (Fig. 3, column
2). In agreement with published data [30], the NL4-3 Nef
did not down-modulate TCR-CD3 (Fig. 3A, column 3). In
contrast, the 239 wt and the eight SIVsmm Nefs modulated the surface expression of all four receptors investigated (Fig. 3A, columns 4–12). Quantitative analyses
demonstrated that Nefs from all five lineages of SIVsmm
showed similar potency in down-modulating CD3, CD4,
MHC-I and CD28 (Fig. 3B). Notably, the 239 wt Nef was
more active than all SIVsmm Nefs in receptor modulation.
This difference was particularly striking in Nef functions
involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signalling. SIVsmm Nefs
generally reduced CD3 cell surface expression about 3fold, whereas the 239 wt Nef caused 6-fold down-modulation. The functional difference in down-modulation of
the co-stimulatory factor CD28 was even more pronounced: all SIVsmm Nef alleles caused only about 2-fold
lower levels of CD28 surface expression, whereas the 239
wt Nef reduced it by 6-fold (Fig. 3B). We also examined

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/36

the effect of the SIVsmm nef alleles on CXCR4, which is
down-modulated by many SIV and (to a lesser extend)
HIV-1 Nefs to inhibit T cell migration [59]. This analysis
was performed in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4A) instead of PBMCs
because the latter express very low levels of CXCR4 upon
PHA stimulation precluding the meaningful analysis of
the Nef function (data not shown). We found that the 239
wt Nef down-modulated CXCR4 by 7.6-fold, whereas all
SIVsmm Nefs had only 3.0- to 4.5-fold effects (Fig. 4B).
Thus, nef alleles from all five lineages of SIVsmm modulate human receptors involved in TCR signalling and T cell
migration, albeit generally with lower efficiency than the
239 wt Nef. Unfortunately, no SIVsmm-specific Nef antibodies are available. Thus, the Nef expression levels could
not be determined, although the fact that all nef alleles
were functionally active implies that they are efficiently
expressed.
It has been previously shown that HIV and SIV Nefs upregulate Ii, most likely to impair MHC-II antigen presentation [29,60]. We transduced the human monocytic
leukemia THP-1 cell line with the NL4-3 Nef-IRES/eGFP
constructs to study Ii up-modulation because it shares
many properties with human monocyte-derived macrophages [61] and expresses high levels of MHC-I and MHCII. As expected [60], THP-1 cells infected with the HIV-1
construct expressing the NL4-3 nef allele showed strongly
enhanced levels of Ii surface expression (Fig. 4C). The
SIVsmm Nefs varied substantially in their ability to upmodulate Ii. Those from M949 (L3) and G932 (L4) upregulated Ii cell surface expression about 4-fold, whereas
the M919 (L1) and FTq (L5) nef alleles caused less than 2fold effects (Fig. 4D). Notably, the HIV-1 NL4-3 Nef was
about 2-fold more effective than all SIV Nefs in up-modulating Ii. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the
ability of Nef to modulate various human receptors
involved in TCR signalling and MHC antigen presentation
is conserved between the different lineages of SIVsmm.
Our results also strongly suggest that the SIVmac239 Nef
became more effective in some of these functions during
its adaptation to rhesus macaques.
SIVsmm Nefs suppress T cell activation
We next examined the effect of the various SIVsmm nef
alleles on the responsiveness of virally infected T cells to
activation. It has been previously shown that Nefs that
down-modulate TCR-CD3 to suppress the responsiveness
of infected T cells to stimulation, whereas those that do
not perform this function have little inhibitory effect or
even render the cells hyper-responsive to stimulation
[30,43,45,62,63]. In agreement with these previous
results, the about 5-fold increase in the expression levels
of the early T cell activation marker CD69 upon PHA stimulation was blocked in PBMC infected with the HIV-1
construct expressing the 239 wt Nef but not in those

expressing the HIV-1 NL4-3 or NA7 Nef proteins (Fig. 5A,
panels 2–4). Consistent with their lower activity in CD3
down-modulation, the SIVsmm Nefs suppressed the
induction of CD69 expression less efficiently than the 239
wt Nef (Fig. 5B, left). Nonetheless, they interfered with
early T cell activation substantially more severely than
those of HIV-1. In comparison, the SIVsmm Nefs had only

weak inhibitory effects on the induction of CD25 at 2 days

scription of many cellular genes, including that encoding
for IL-2. It has been established that primate lentiviral Nef
proteins differ fundamentally in their effect on the induction of NFAT [30,45]. To assess the effect of nef alleles
from different lineages of SlVsmm on NFAT activation in
virally infected cells, we transduced Jurkat T cells stably
transfected with the luciferase reporter gene under the
control of an NFAT-dependent promoter [45], with the
proviral HIV-1 eGFP/Nef constructs and examined their

responsiveness to activation. T cells infected with nef
defective HIV-1 construct showed about 5-fold enhanced
levels of NFAT activity upon PHA stimulation compared
to mock infected cells (Fig. 6). As expected from previous
studies [30,45], this increase was further enhanced by
expression of the HIV-1 NL4-3 and NA7 Nefs but entirely
blocked by the 239 wt Nef. Despite their reduced potency
in CD3 and CD28 down-modulation, all SIVsmm Nefs
suppressed the induction of NFAT-dependent luciferase

activity almost as efficiently as the 239 wt Nef (Fig. 6).
Compared to T cells infected with viral constructs containing HIV-1 nef alleles they expressed about 5- to 10-fold
lower levels of NFAT-dependent luciferase activity. Thus,
nef alleles from all five lineages of SIVsmm suppress the
responsiveness of infected T cells to stimulation, albeit
with lower potency than that of SIVmac239.
SIVsmm Nefs enhance viral infectivity and replication
The proviral HIV-1 IRES/eGFP constructs are replicationcompetent and hence allow to measure the ability of Nef
to promote viral infectivity and replication. To assess the

ability of the SIVsmm Nefs to enhance virion infectivity
we infected P4-CCR5 [64], TZM-bl [65,66] and CEMx174
5.25 M7 (CEMx-M7) indicator cells with virus stocks containing 1 ng of p24 antigen derived from 293T cells transiently transfected with the different proviral constructs.
We found that the control NL4-3 and 239 wt Nef proteins
enhanced virion infectivity 4.0- and 5.6-fold, respectively,
in P4-CCR5 cells (Fig. 7A) but had little if any enhancing
effects in TZM-bl and CEM-M7 cells (Fig. 7B and data not
shown). All eight SIVsmm nef alleles analyzed also
enhanced viral infectivity in P4-CCR5 cells (Fig. 7A).
However, although they showed similar potency in down-

modulating CD3, CD4, CD28 and MHC-I (Fig. 3) and in
suppressing T cell activation (Figs. 5 and 6) they varied
substantially in their ability to promote virion infectivity
(Fig. 7). The L1 and L2 M919, M923, M926 and M946
Nefs were more effective than the NL4-3 and 239 wt Nefs
and increased virus infection between 10.0- and 17.4-fold
(Fig. 7A). In comparison, the L4 G932 Nef was poorly
active in enhancing virion infectivity (2.4-fold enhancement) and the remaining L3 and L5 Nefs showed an intermediate phenotype. Next, we investigated whether the
eight SIVsmm bulk nef alleles promote viral spread in
human PBMC cultures. We found that all SIVsmm Nefs
enhanced viral replication with 239wt-like efficiency (Fig.
8A). In contrast to their differential effects on virion infectivity in P4-CCR5 cells, the eight SIVsmm nef alleles did
not differ significantly in their ability to promote viral
spread in human PBMC (Fig. 8B). This is consistent with
previous results showing that the efficiency of HIV-1 replication does not correlate with the ability of Nef to
enhance the infectivity of progeny virions [67,68]. Thus,
nef alleles from all five lineages of SIVsmm are capable to
promote viral spread and infectivity in human cells without adaptive changes.
Subgroup-specific analysis of previously investigated
SIVsmm Nefs
The data described above show that Nefs from different
lineages of SIVsmm are basically capable to modulate various receptors and to enhance viral infectivity and replication in human-derived cells. As a first step to elucidate

whether different lineages of SIVsmm show quantitative
differences in Nef function, we re-analyzed data derived
from the functional analysis of 22 nef alleles from 14 naturally infected SMs with low (<500/μl) and eight animals
with high (>500/μ1) CD4+ T cell counts [42]. This study
showed that inefficient down-modulation of CD3 and
MHC-I by Nef is associated with low CD4+ T cell counts in
this natural simian host of SIV but did not assess whether
these SIVsmm Nefs show lineage-specific differences in
Nef function. Phylogenetic analyses showed that two of
the 22 nef sequences clustered with the L5 FTq sequence
and four with the L3 M951 and M949 sequences (Fig. 1).
These L3 and L5 nef sequences formed two distinct clusters. In comparison, the remaining 16 SIVsmm nef
sequences were more closely related to those derived from
the more common SIVsmm L1 and L2 strains (Fig. 1).
These nef sequences showed a high degree of genetic
diversity and L2 nef alleles fell within the L1 cluster. Therefore, we grouped them together and refer to them herein
after as L1/2 Nefs. Examination of the functional data
showed that, on average, L1/2, L3 and L5 SIVsmm Nefs
showed similar activities in down-modulating CD4 and
CD3 (Fig. 9A, B). All 22 SIVsmm nef alleles had only weak
effects on CD28, although those derived from L3 were
usually a little more active than others (Fig. 9C). These lineages of SIVsmm did also not show a significant differences in Nef-mediated modulation of MHC-I (Fig. 9D). In
agreement with the results shown in Fig. 8, L1/2 nef alleles
were, on average, more potent in enhancing virion infectivity than L3 Nefs (Fig. 9E). As reported previously [42],
Nef alleles from a single SIVsmm-infected SM with very
low numbers of CD4+ T cells rendered T cells hyperresponsive to activation, similarly to those of HIV-1 (Fig.
9F). The remaining SIVsmm Nefs all suppressed NFAT
induction and did not show significant lineage-specific
differences in this activity (Fig. 9F). Altogether, these
results demonstrate that SIVsmm nef alleles from SMs
with different numbers of CD4+ helper T cells show substantially functional differences but these are strain rather
than lineage dependent.

Discussion
In the present study, we show that nef alleles from different lineages of SIVsmm modulate the surface expression
of human CD4, CD3, CD28, MHC-I and Ii molecules,
suppress T cell activation and enhance viral spread and
infectivity. This result is in agreement with our previous
findings showing that SIVsmm and SIVcpz nef alleles
[43,69] but also those derived from SIVs that have not
been found in humans [30] do not require adaptive
changes to be functionally active in human cells. We did
not find any significant lineage-specific differences in
SIVsmm Nef function. Thus, although a larger number of
nef alleles from all clades of SIVsmm must be analyzed to
definitely exclude this possibility, our results suggest that

lineage-specific differences in SIVsmm Nef function do
not play a major role in the virological and immunological features of natural SIVsmm infection in SMs. In comparison, strain-dependent differences in Nefs ability to
facilitate viral immune evasion and to promote viral
spread may significantly affect the fitness and pathogenicity of SIVsmm in its natural SM, human and experimental
macaque hosts.

One remarkable observation was that SIVsmm nef alleles
were generally less potent in down-modulating various
human receptors and in suppressing T cell activation than
that of SIVmac239. This difference was not due to the fact
that the bulk nef preparations contained a high frequency
of inactivating point mutations, since all 24 individual
proviral constructs encoded intact nef open reading

alleles from about 40 different SMs and belonging to five
different lineages have been functionally analyzed to date
[42,43]. The fact that SIVsmm Nefs are generally less
active in modulating CD3, CD28 and CXCR4 than that of
SIVmac239 suggests that the latter evolved to become
more active in suppressing the migration and activation of
infected T cells during its adaptation to rhesus macaques.
At first view this may seem counterintuitive since
SIVmac239 infection of rhesus macaques is associated
with high levels of chronic T cell activation and rapid loss
of CD4+ T cell loss and progression to simian AIDS [35].
It is conceivable, however, that for effective viral persistence in their respective hosts, HIV and SIV must balance
the activation of virally infected T cells to levels that are
high enough to ensure efficient proviral transcription but
also so low that they do not cause apoptosis before the
viral replication cycle is completed. The necessity to carefully adjust the responsiveness of virally infected T cells to
activation to achieve this balance most likely explains why
primary SIVsmm Nefs show only moderate activity in
functions affecting the interaction and stimulation of T
cells by APCs. The experimental macaque host reacts with
much higher levels of immune activation and T cell activation to SIV infection than the natural SM host [70]. It is
thus plausible that SIVsmm/SIVmac may have evolved
not only to persist efficiently at high levels but also to
become more active in suppressing T cell activation in
macaques to compensate for the aggravated immune
response in this new host.
One limitation of the present study is that the data on
SIVsmm Nef function were derived using an HIV-1-based
proviral construct in human derived cells. We have previously shown, however, that HIV-1, SIVmac and SIVagm
derived proviral constructs expressing various HIV and
SIV nef alleles exhibited the same phenotype in human
and SM PBMC [30]. Thus, the effect of Nef on receptor
modulation and T cell activation is independent of the
proviral context and conserved in target cells from divergent primate species. Moreover, one goal of the present
study was to assess whether lineage-dependent differences
in Nef function in human cells may have affected the fitness and hence the subsequent spread of SIVsmm/HIV-2
in the new human host. Lack of Nef function could potentially play a relevant role because Nef is required for effective viral persistence [32-35] and the efficiency of sexual
viral transmission correlates with the viral load. Our finding that nef alleles from all five lineages of SIVsmm analyzed modulated various human receptors, suppressed T
cell activation and promoted viral infectivity in humanderived cells suggests that this was most likely not the
case. However, larger numbers of nef alleles from the different lineages of SIVsmm need to functionally to exclude
the possibility that some (perhaps subtle) functional dif-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/36

ferences do exist. For example, L1 and L2 nef alleles usually enhanced virion infectivity more efficiently than
those derived from L3. Whether or not it is just coincidence that SIVsmm L1 and L2 are more widespread and
associated with higher viral loads compared to L3 in the
animal cohorts housed at the YNPRC and TNPRC [21]
remains to be determined. Previous results in the SIVmac/
macaque model suggest that Nef-mediated enhancement
of virion infectivity contributes to efficient viral replication in vivo [58,70], although the fact that the nef alleles
used in these studies also differed in other functional
aspects precludes definitive conclusions.
Another issue that warrants further study is the previous
finding that 3 out of 4 SMs infected with L5 SIVsmm
strains showed a significant loss of CD4+ T cells, whereas
this only observed in about 10–15% of animals infected
with SIVsmm lineages 1, 2 and 3 [21,22]. Since inefficient
Nef-mediated downmodulation of CD3 and MHC-I correlates with numbers of CD4+ T cells in natural SIVsmm
infection [42] it was tempting to speculate that L5 Nefs
may be poorly active in these functions. In the present
study we did not observe a particularly low activity of L5
Nef in modulating CD3 or MHC-I. However, only three
L5 nef alleles were available for functional analyses. Furthermore, the FTq nef that has not been analyzed in the
previous study [42] was derived from the only SIVsmm L5
infected SM with normal CD4+ T cell counts (~850/μl)
and no plasma sample was available from the animals
with the lowest number of CD4+ T cells. Finally, the comparison of the functional activity of the remaining two L5
Nefs with those derived from other lineages shown in Fig.
9 is not suitable to address the question because SIVsmm
L1, L2 and L3 infected SMs with low CD4+ T cell counts
are strongly over-represented in this set of nef alleles [42].
The fact, that these previously examined nef alleles were
derived from SMs selected based on their different CD4+ T
cell counts may also explain why they are functionally
more divergent than the newly analyzed nef alleles.
The fact that primary nef alleles from all lineages of
SIVsmm analyzed are functional in human-derived cells
suggests that Nef facilitated HIV-2 to maintain high viral
loads and spread in the new human host without requiring adaptive changes. In contrast to natural SIVsmm infection, HIV-2 is associated with AIDS in a significant
number of infected individuals, although it causes lower
levels of immune activation and is substantially less pathogenic than HIV-1 [71,72]. Furthermore, in strict contrast
to natural SIV infections, non-progressing HIV-2 infections are typically associated with low viral loads [73,74]
and hence most likely also with ineffective virus transmission. In fact, HIV-2 has spread substantially less efficiently
in the human population than HIV-1 and recent findings
suggest that the HIV-2 epidemic is now declining [75].

Currently, too little information is available to assess how
SIVsmm/HIV-2 Nef function evolved in the new human
host. Preliminary data suggest, however, that the prevalence of defective nef genes may be higher in HIV-2 than
in SIVsmm and HIV-1 infections [42,43,76]. Furthermore,
HIV-2 Nefs are usually less active in enhancing viral replication in vitro than both HIV-1 and SIVsmm Nefs [43] and
HIV-2 isolates show lower replicative fitness compared to
HIV-1 isolates in infected PBMC cultures [77]. To obtain
further insights into the evolution of SIVsmm/HIV-2 Nef
function after zoonotic transmission and its role in HIV-2
replication and pathogenesis it will be interesting to perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis of primary
HIV-2 nef alleles from infected individual who are clinically well characterized. Taken together, our current
knowledge shows that SIV and HIV nef alleles are usually
functionally active in cells of a new host species, such as
humans or macaques. However, the fine-tuning of Nef
function to allow effective viral replication and spread
without causing harm to the infected host is obviously difficult to achieve.

Conclusion
Our analysis of nef alleles from different clades of
SIVsmm shows that they are all capable to modulate the
surface expression of various receptors and to enhance
viral infectivity and replication in human derived cells.
These results suggest that lack of these Nef functions was
not the reason why only two of eight zoonotic transmission of SIVsmm from SMs to humans resulted in significant spread in the human population. Our finding that
primary SIVsmm Nefs are generally only moderately
active in functions that affect the migration of T cells and
their responsiveness to stimulation most likely reflects
the necessity for SIVsmm to curb T cell activation to levels that warrant effective viral replication without damaging the host immune system. Together with the results
of previous studies [30,42,43,46,69], the present data
show that SIV nef alleles from African non-human primate species are usually functional in human or
macaque derived cells. Obviously, however, the fine-tuning of various Nef (and possibly other) functions to
establish an elaborative well-balanced virus-host relationship similarly to that found in some natural SIV
infections is also dependent on various host factors and
seems difficult to achieve. Further studies with well characterized molecular SIVclones differing in the repertoire
(e.g. the presence of vpr, vpx, vpu and nef gene) or function of their accessory genes in adapted and non-adapted
monkey hosts are needed to achieve a better understanding of these complex virus-host interactions.
