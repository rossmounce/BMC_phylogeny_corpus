Abstract
Background: Paedocypris, a highly developmentally truncated fish from peat swamp forests in
Southeast Asia, comprises the world's smallest vertebrate. Although clearly a cyprinid fish, a
hypothesis about its phylogenetic position among the subfamilies of this largest teleost family, with
over 2400 species, does not exist. Here we present a phylogenetic analyses of 227 cypriniform taxa,
including 213 cyprinids, based upon complete mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b nucleotide
sequences in order to determine the phylogenetic position of Paedocypris and to study the evolution
of miniaturization among cyprinids.
Results: Our analyses reveal a strongly supported sister group relationship (clade C) between
Paedocypris and Sundadanio, another developmentally truncated miniature cyprinid. Clade C was
resolved as sister group of a larger clade characterized by small rasborine taxa (clade D). We found
that miniaturised taxa are more numerous in the rasborine clade A, formed by clades C and D, than
in any other cyprinid clade. The consensus cytb in cyprinids includes 380 amino acids and an
incomplete T–– stop codon. We noted that a few cyprinids mostly rasborine taxa placed within
clade A had either a TAA or TAG stop codon, 376, 378, or 381 amino acids, and up to 10 base
pairs (bp) of noncoding region before the 5' end of the tRNA-Thr. Our relaxed molecular clock
estimates revealed high divergence times for the Sundadanio and Paedocypris clades and provide a
first temporal framework for the evolution of miniaturization among cyprinids.
Conclusion: Paedocypris belongs to a clade (Rasborinae clade A) that shows recurrent
miniaturization, including both taxa characterized by developmental truncation and by
proportioned dwarfism. Its closest relative is another miniaturized taxon, the genus Sundadanio.
We conclude that the miniaturized cyprinids with remarkable morphological novelties, like
Paedocypris and Danionella, are at the same time the most developmentally truncated taxa. The
miniaturized cyprinids with no or few developmental truncations like Boraras, Microrasbora, and
Horadandia show no such evolutionary novelties.

Background
Miniaturisation, an evolutionary process that leads to
dwarfed sexually mature organisms, is widespread among
vertebrates and best documented in amphibians and
fishes [1-4]. Miniaturized taxa are frequently characterized
by a trend towards reduction and simplification of various
structures and organs. In a number of cases such miniature taxa, in the example of fishes, species maturing at
sizes under 20 mm [2], have defied various attempts over
a number of decades to determine their phylogenetic
position with any confidence. The two most prominent
examples among bony fishes in this context are Schindleria, which had previously been assigned to various higher
level taxa among teleosts and even been put in its own
order, until it was shown to be a gobioid [5], and Sundasalanx, which was first described as a salmoniform [6],
but later demonstrated to be a clupeoid [7].
We recently described a new genus of miniaturized
cyprinids, Paedocypris, with two new species P. micromegethes and P. progenetica, both from Southeast Asia [8].
Although clearly a member of the Cyprinidae among the
cypriniform Otophysi, the simplified anatomical structure of Paedocypris, combined with a number of highly
derived autapomorphic characters, have made it difficult
to develop a convincing hypothesis about its phylogenetic
position among the subfamilies of this largest teleost family [9]. A phylogenetic framework, however, is essential to
evaluate the number of evolutionary transitions from
non-miniature to miniature among cyprinids, and thus,
to determine whether Paedocypris is part of a larger group
of miniaturized taxa or the consequence of an independent evolutionary event of miniaturization. Among
cyprinids, 21 species from nine genera in South and
Southeast Asia can be considered miniaturized [8,10-12].
Miniature cyprinids are absent from North America and
Eurasia (not including India and southern Asia), however,
12 species in three genera are known from Africa [13]. To
determine the phylogenetic position of Paedocypris among
cyprinids, we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on
DNA nucleotide sequence data from a large range of
cypriniform representatives including many miniaturized
taxa.

Results
Cyprinid phylogenetics
The phylogenetic analyses were based on an alignment of
1131 nucleotide sites excluding some positions at the 3'
end of the cytb gene. We were unable to amplify the 5' end
of the cytb for nine taxa despite designing several new
primers located in the tRNA-Glu and internal reverse
primers (Additional files 1 and 2). The cytochrome b
(cytb) in the analysed taxa consists of 376, 378, 380, or
381 amino acids, with 380 amino acid positions being the
most common length of the ORF in cyprinids (Additional

file 1). Most cyprinids show an incomplete T–– stop
codon that is completed to a TAA stop codon posttranscriptionally by polyadenylation of the mRNAs [14]. We
noted that a few cyprinids had either a TAA or TAG stop
codon and up to 10 base pairs (bp) of noncoding region
before the 5' end of the tRNA-Thr. Changes of the 3' end
of the cytochrome b, the stop codon, noncoding region,
and the beginning of the tRNA-Thr of the taxa used in this
study are shown in Additional file 1. In this regard it is
noteworthy to mention that both Paedocypris sp "Pulau
Singkep" and "Banka" from Islands near Sumatra show a
complete TAA stop codon, whereas P. sp "Kalimantan
Tengah" and "Pontianak" from Borneo show an incomplete T–– stop codon [see Additional file 1].
The 50% majority-rule consensus tree recovered from the
partitioned Bayesian analysis of the complete cytochrome
b is depicted in Figure 1. As the focus of our study was to
place Paedocypris within a larger phylogenetic framework,
a detailed treatment of cyprinid intrarelationships based
upon complete cytb is beyond our scope. We are aware
that some nodes in Figure 1 are poorly supported or unresolved but this does not affect our conclusions. Clearly,
more nucleotide sampling both from mitochondrial and
nuclear DNA is needed to fully resolve the complex phylogenetic history of cyprinids.
Paedocypris was placed as sistergroup of Sundadanio with
high support (1.0 posterior probability, clade C in Figure
1). The Paedocypris-Sundadanio clade C was resolved with
moderate support as sistergroup to clade D (Figure 1; 1.0
posterior probability), which consists of an additional 21
rasborine taxa forming the Rasborinae clade A (0.86 posterior probability, clade A in Figure 1). Other taxa commonly classified as Rasborinae were not resolved in clade
A, rendering the Rasborinae non-monophyletic (Figure
1). The Rasborinae clade A was resolved as sister group of
clade B (Figure 1; 0.99 posterior probability) consisting of
the remaining cyprinid taxa with high support. The
monophyly of the Cyprinidae received a posterior probability of 1.00 (Figure 1). ML gave identical results regarding the main cyprinid intrarelationships as BI (see Figure
2). The maximum observed pairwise genetic distance (pdistances) between Paedocypris individuals sampled from
Sumatra and Borneo were 12.6%, whereas the genetic distance between the two Sundadanio individuals (one from
Borneo and the other with uncertain origin obtained
through the aquarium trade, but presumably from
Sumatra) was 13.5%.
Cyprinidae divergence time estimates
The ML phylogram used for the PL analyses is depicted in
Figure 2A. In both approaches, calibration based on substitution rate or fossil record, stem and crown group calibrations gave nearly identical results regarding cyprinid

divergence time estimates (Table 1). We therefore focus
on the results obtained using the crown group calibration.
Applying the cyprinid cytb molecular clock of 0.0082 substitutions per site per million year resulted in a cyprinid
crown group age of 33.2 MY (node 1 in Figure 2C), while
the age of the MRCA of rasborins (Clade A) was 31.89 MY
(node 2 in Figure 2C), that of Paedocypris and Sundadanio
was 23.97 MY (node 3 in Figure 2C), and that of Paedocypris was 6.34 MY (node 4 in Figure 2C) (Table 1). The
inferred standard deviation (sd) of the substitution rate
was 0.003. In contrast, when the cyprinid tree was calibrated with fossil data constraining the crown group age
to 51.9 MY (node 1 in Figure 2C), the MRCA of rasborines
(Clade A) was found to be 49.86 MY old (node 2 in Figure

2C), that of Paedocypris and Sundadanio 37.47 MY (node 3
in Figure 2C), and that of Paedocypris 9.91 MY (node 4 in
Figure 2C), respectively (Table 1). The inferred mean substitution rate with this calibration was 0.0052 (sd 0.002)
substitutions per site per million years.
Evolution of miniaturization in rasborines
The ML topology from the rasborine data set was used to
perform character-state reconstruction for the evolution
of miniaturization among Rasborinae clade A (Figure 1).
Using both, unweighted parsimony and ML ancestral
character state reconstruction we found that a miniature
body size has evolved recurrently among rasborines from
clade A (Figure 3). We note, however, that the topology of

Discussion
Molecular phylogenetics
To place Paedocypris within a larger phylogenetic framework we had to depend to a large degree on published cytb
sequences, by far the most commonly used molecular
phylogenetic marker for cyprinids thus far (e.g. [15-18]).
While most of the cyprinid subfamilies are rather well represented in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ database, complete
rasborine cytb sequences are scarce. This is surprising,
since the Rasborinae is a particularly speciose and widespread subfamily. Only one representative of the rasborine clade A (Figure 1) could be obtained from
GenBank (Danio rerio, NC 002333) whereas the other 26
species (clade A) were sequenced specifically for this
study. We were unable to amplify the 5' end of the cytb for
nine of these taxa [see Additional file 1]. It is therefore
possible that in some rasborines the tRNA-Glu is not
located directly 5' of the cytb or that it shows an unusual
structure compared to the consensus teleost tRNA-Glu.
This might partially explain the absence of published
complete rasborine cytb nucleotide sequences.
Divergence time estimates
The results derived from the substitution rate calibration
and those obtained under the fossil calibrations vary
widely in the inferred cyprinid root ages (Table 1). While

the root was fixed at an age of 51.9 My based on fossil evidence, using the substitution rate calibration we obtained
a root age of 33.2 My (Table 1). A possible source of error
in this calibration is the cyprinid cytb substitution rate
used. Recently, it was shown that there is a problem of
extrapolating molecular rates across different evolutionary timescales caused by marked differences between
short-term and long-term substitution rates [19]. It is
therefore likely that the cyprinid substitution rate we
employed is inflated (faster short term substitution rates
for the taxa used for the calculation [16] than the "real"
long term cyprinid substitution rate) and hence, the divergence time estimates have been underestimated.
Miniaturization
The evolution of small size is a recurrent theme among teleosts and especially striking in cyprinid and gobioid
fishes, which include the record holders for smallest vertebrates [8,20,21]. The recently described cyprinid genus
Paedocypris contains the smallest fish and vertebrate species, P. progenetica, with females maturing at 7.9 mm
standard length [8]. So far, the phylogenetic relationships
of Paedocypris among the Cyprinidae are unclear due to its
highly developmentally truncated anatomy. The mtDNA
based phylogenetic analyses, reported herein are part of a
dual approach to resolve this issue. An ongoing morphological study looks at non-truncated characters of Paedocypris and compares them with other cyprinid
representatives (Britz and Conway in prep.). Our phylogenetic analyses of a large number of cyprinids consistently
recovered Sundadanio as the sister group of Paedocypris.
Sundadanio is a genus established for a single miniature

species, S. axelrodi, originally described as a member of the
genus Rasbora [10,22]. Sundadanio (which includes at least
two or three undescribed species) has a maximum size of
22.5 mm SL [23] and occurs on Sumatra, Banka, Riau
Archipelago, and different parts of Borneo.
Both Sundadanio and Paedocypris are part of a larger clade
(Rasborinae clade A in Figure 1) comprising taxa that have
been referred to in the systematic literature as Rasborinae
[24] or Danioninae [25]. Among those, the genera Esomus,
Luciosoma, Rasbora, Nematabramis, Chela, Inlecypris, Danio
(= Devario), Brachydanio (= Danio), Bengala, Pseudorasbora,
and possibly Thryssocypris, were considered by Howes [24]
to form a monophyletic group, the Rasborini. The only
more recent comprehensive phylogenetic study looking at

relationships among some rasborine taxa is Fang [26],
who focused on the so-called danionins. Regarding the
position of Sundadanio, Fang ([26], p. 719) concluded:
"The genus is obviously well characterized, and it is apparently a danionin taxon, but a precise phylogenetic placement is presently elusive." Based on our molecular results
Sundadanio is the closest relative of Paedocypris.
Judging from the number of very small species, miniaturization seems to be much more frequent in the rasborine
clade A cyprinids than in any other subfamily (Figure 1).
In the taxa we have studied, miniaturization occurs in the
Sundadanio/Paedocypris clade (clade C: Figure 1), in Danionella, 'Danio' erythromicron, Microrasbora, Horadandia,
Boraras, Chela dadiburjori and in Rasbora kalbarensis. Based

on our tree, we hypothesize that miniature taxa evolved at
least seven times independently in rasborine clade A (Figure 3). The only other miniature cyprinid outside Rasborinae in our analysis is the African Barboides britzi, which
groups with the other African Barbus-like cyprinids (Figure
1). Other miniature cyprinid taxa, which we were unable
to include in the study, are Sawbwa resplendens, an Asian
member of the Cyprininae, Tanichthys micagemmae, sometimes considered a rasborine, although its sister taxon T.
albonubes was not resolved in the core rasborine clade A in
our analyses (Figure 1), and nine African species of the
genus 'Barbus' (Barbinae).
Our results indicate that Paedocypris is the sister genus of
the miniaturized Sundadanio and part of a larger clade, the
Rasborinae clade A (Figure 1). Paedocypris is thus not the
result of an independent miniaturization event, but an
extreme of the trend towards miniaturization in the Sundadanio – Paedocypris clade (Figure 3). Although miniature
fishes, by definition, share the character 'maturing at sizes
under 20 mm' [2], the anatomical outcome of the process
of miniaturization can be very different. Two extreme
results are possible with various intermediate stages in
between [27]: the miniaturized species may just be a
dwarfed but otherwise identical image of its larger ancestor (Gould's proportioned dwarfism [28]), or it closely
resembles an early developmental stage of the larger
ancestor (commonly referred to as developmentally truncated species). Among the miniature cyprinids, an example for the first case is Boraras, which, except for a few
reductions, closely resembles its larger relatives of the
genus Rasbora [29]. Two clearly developmentally truncated miniature cyprinids are Danionella and Paedocypris
that have the appearance and anatomical structure of larval cyprinids [8,11].
Hanken [1] noted that miniaturization is often not only
associated with the reduction of characters, but also with
the evolution of morphological novelties and some of the
developmentally truncated miniature cyprinids offer fascinating examples for this claim. Danionella is characterized by an anterior shift of the genital pore and anus in
males so that both open between the enlarged pelvic fins
[11], and by novel flanges, cartilages, and processes on the
Weberian apparatus with unknown function. Males of the
genus Paedocypris have a highly modified pelvic girdle,
and pelvic fin rays and associated muscles that along with
a conspicuous, keratinized knob of skin in front of the fins
possibly function as a clasping organ, although its precise
biological role is still unclear [8]. In contrast, species of
the genus Boraras, the proportioned dwarfs, which are in
roughly the same size class as Danionella and Paedocypris,
reveal no such evolutionary novelties. Morphological
novelties also seem to be lacking in some of the other
miniaturized, but hardly developmentally truncated,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/38

cyprinids, like Horadandia, Sawbwa, Microrasbora, and
'Danio' erythromicron. With the establishment of Danio
rerio, a member of rasborine clade A, as a model organism
for vertebrate developmental genetics [30] the proportioned dwarfs and the developmentally truncated miniatures offer a challenging system of "natural mutants" to
study the loss of characters and the evolution of morphological novelties comparatively at a genetic level.
Kottelat et al. [8] pointed out that peat swamp forests in
Southeast Asia house an unusually high number of miniature fishes. Regarding cyprinids only, this still holds true,
as six out of the 12 miniature cyprinids occurring in
Southeast Asia live in peat swamp forests and of these five
exclusively so (i.e. are stenotopic). The continued study of
these and other miniaturized fish is in jeopardy as their
preferred habitats in Southeast Asia are being lost at an
alarming rate [8].

Conclusion
Our phylogenetic analyses that include representatives of
all major cyprinid lineages show a strongly supported sister group relationship between Sundadanio and Paedocypris, two developmentally truncated taxa. They were
resolved as part of a larger clade containing small rasborines (rasborine clade A). Relaxed molecular clock analyses revealed unexpectedly old ages for the MRCAs of the
Sundadanio – Paedocypris clade (clade C; Figure 1) and the
Paedocypris and Sundadanio clades, respectively (Figure 1
and 3). Miniaturization seems to be a much more frequent event in the rasborine clade A than in any other
cyprinid subfamily. Based on our phylogenetic hypothesis, miniature taxa evolved at least seven times independently in rasborine clade A including developmentally
truncated taxa and taxa characterized by proportioned
dwarfism. The rasborine clade A is not only an ideal group
to study the evolution of miniaturization among vertebrates, but also to investigate the evolution of morphological novelties. While those miniature cyprinids that hardly
show any developmental truncation generally lack morphological novelties, they are common in miniature,
developmentally truncated cyprinids.

Methods
Biological material, DNA isolation, and DNA sequencing
To assess the molecular phylogenetic position of Paedocypris, DNA samples of 36 Cyprinidae, mostly Rasborinae,
and one species of Gyrinocheilidae were specifically
obtained for this study (appendix 1; see below). In addition, a total of 191 complete or nearly complete cytochrome b (cytb) sequences were obtained from GenBank
(177 Cyprinidae, five Catostomidae, three Cobitidae, four
Balitoridae, one species of Gyrinocheilidae, and one species of Gonorynchiformes as outgroup; see Additional file
1). Cytochrome b has been the most important and most

frequently used molecular marker in cyprinid phylogenetics, but we are aware that its phylogenetic performance
might not be suitable to address cyprinid intrarelationships at all taxonomic levels [31]. However, we still chose
to use cytb over alternative markers due to its huge taxonomic coverage that allowed wide ranging comparisons
regarding the phylogenetic position of Paedocypris.
Whole fish or fin clips were preserved in 70–100% ethanol, and total genomic DNA was isolated from white muscle tissue or fin clips using the QIAGENE DNeasy Tissue
kit. The complete cytochrome b gene was amplified with
two versatile primers DonGlu F and DonThr R [32]. For
some taxa additional primers were used [see Additional
file 2]. All PCR amplifications were conducted in 25 µl
reactions containing 75 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 2 mM
MgCl2, 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 µM of each primer,
template DNA (10–100 ng), and Taq DNA polymerase (1
unit, Promega), using the following program on a MJ
PTC-2000 thermal cycler: 1 cycle of 2 min at 94°C, 35
cyles of 60s at 94°C, 60s at 48–54°C, and 90s at 72°C,
and finally, 1 cycle of 5 min at 72°C. PCR products were
sequenced directly after PCR purification using the Millipore PCR cleanup kit.
Sequencing reactions were performed with the BigDye
Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following manufacturer's instructions in a 10 µl volume with 1 pMol of primer, 1 µl of
BigDye Terminator Mix, and 2–3 ng of DNA per 100 bps
of PCR product. The cycling profile for the sequencing
reaction consisted of 25 cycles of 10 s at 96°C, 5 s at 50°C,
and 4 min at 60°C. Cycle sequencing products were purified using standard ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation
and run on an Applied Biosystems 3730 × l DNA Analyzer. Sequences specifically obtained for this study have
been deposited in GenBank [GenBank: EF151088–
EF151123 and EF153103 ].
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
The cytochrome b nucleotide data set was aligned by eye.
The alignment is available from TreeBASE. The phylogenetic analyses comprised the complete cytb of 228 taxa
(including other families and outgroup; Appendix 1). The
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; [33]) implemented in
MODELTEST v3.06 [34] was used to determine the evolutionary model that best fits the data set. The model
selected was subsequently used for Bayesian inference
(BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses.

A Bayesian inference (BI) of cyprinid phylogeny was performed with MrBayes v3.1.2 [35] by Metropolis Coupled
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MC3) sampling for
2,000,000 generations (two independent runs each with
four simultaneous MC chains; chain temperature 0.2;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/38

sample frequency 200; burnin 1,500,000 generations (see
Results) under the GTR + I + Γ model as selected by MODELTEST v3.06. The cytb data set was run with three data
partitions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd codon positions) and model
parameters were estimated independently for each of the
respective data partitions using the unlink command in
MrBayes v3.1.2. Tracer v1.3 [36] was used to plot the – log
likelihood scores against generation time to evaluate mixing, run convergence, and the burn-in needed before
reaching stationarity. We then used PAUP* v4.0b10 [37]
to reconstruct the 50% majority-rule consensus tree of the
post burn-in trees. ML analyses were conducted with Garli
v0.94 [38] under the GTR + I + Γ model and using the
default settings.
Evolution of miniaturization
Ancestral character state reconstructions for the evolution
of miniaturization in the rasborine clade A were performed based upon ML topology obtained with PAUP*
from a restricted 29-taxon data set (henceforth referred to
as the rasborine data set). Miniaturized taxa are defined as
maturing at sizes under 20 mm [2]. Ancestral character
state reconstruction was performed under unweighted
parsimony and ML as implemented in Mesquite v1.06
[39,40].
Divergence times estimates
Chronograms were constructed using penalized likelihood (PL, [41]), as implemented in r8s v1.70 [42] based
on the ML phylogram to date major cladogenetic events.
The TN algorithm and the additive penalty function was
used for the PL analyses. In order to find the optimal
smoothing parameter (λ) for PL, cross-validation was performed over a range of values of λ ranging from 100 to
102.8 in 15 steps.

To roughly estimate divergence times between clades of
interest we used two approaches. The first approach does
not rely on the fossil record, but instead assumes an average cyprinid cytb substitution rate of 0.0082 substitutions
per site per million years. This substitution rate was
derived for the same gene for European cyprinids based
upon two independent, and well-dated geological events
(formation of the strait of Korinthos and the opening of
the Gibraltar strait after the Messinian salinity crisis) [16]
and was recalculated by Rüber et al. [43]. An iterative
approach was used to estimate divergence times for the
cyprinid data set by adjusting the age of the cyprinid root
(see below) until it fitted the average cyprinid substitution
rate (see also [44]). The second approach makes use of the
fossil record of cyprinids. The oldest known fossil of the
Cyprinidae is Parabarbus sp. from the Early Eocene (Ypresian, 49.0 – 54.8 MYA; Obailinskaya formation in Kazakhstan; [45,46]). We used the median age of the Ypresian
(51.9 MYA) to calibrate the cyprinid tree. Given the uncer-

tainty of assigning Parabarbus sp. to either the stem or
crown group Cyprinidae, we conducted both analyses
using either the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of
cyprinids and its sister group or the MRCA of cyprinids as
the fixed "cyprinid root", respectively.
