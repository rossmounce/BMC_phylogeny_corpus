Abstract
Background: Terpenoids are among the most important constituents of grape flavour and wine bouquet, and
serve as useful metabolite markers in viticulture and enology. Based on the initial 8-fold sequencing of a nearly
homozygous Pinot noir inbred line, 89 putative terpenoid synthase genes (VvTPS) were predicted by in silico
analysis of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera) genome assembly [1]. The finding of this very large VvTPS family, combined
with the importance of terpenoid metabolism for the organoleptic properties of grapevine berries and finished
wines, prompted a detailed examination of this gene family at the genomic level as well as an investigation into
VvTPS biochemical functions.
Results: We present findings from the analysis of the up-dated 12-fold sequencing and assembly of the grapevine
genome that place the number of predicted VvTPS genes at 69 putatively functional VvTPS, 20 partial VvTPS, and 63
VvTPS probable pseudogenes. Gene discovery and annotation included information about gene architecture and
chromosomal location. A dense cluster of 45 VvTPS is localized on chromosome 18. Extensive FLcDNA cloning,
gene synthesis, and protein expression enabled functional characterization of 39 VvTPS; this is the largest number
of functionally characterized TPS for any species reported to date. Of these enzymes, 23 have unique functions
and/or phylogenetic locations within the plant TPS gene family. Phylogenetic analyses of the TPS gene family
showed that while most VvTPS form species-specific gene clusters, there are several examples of gene orthology
with TPS of other plant species, representing perhaps more ancient VvTPS, which have maintained functions
independent of speciation.
Conclusions: The highly expanded VvTPS gene family underpins the prominence of terpenoid metabolism in
grapevine. We provide a detailed experimental functional annotation of 39 members of this important gene family
in grapevine and comprehensive information about gene structure and phylogeny for the entire currently known
VvTPS gene family.

Background
Terpenoids are a large class of metabolites that are
involved in the fragrance and aroma constituents of
flowers and fruits, plant defense, and primary plant
metabolism [2-4]. Although all terpenoids arise from a

few structurally simple prenyldiphosphate precursors, an
enormous assortment of thousands of possible molecules comes to fruition. This chemical diversity of terpenoid structures is attributed, in large part, to the myriad
ways of folding and the eventual quenching of reactive
carbocation intermediates in the reaction catalyzed by
terpenoid synthases (TPS) [5,6]. The products of TPS
can be further modified by other enzymes such a cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases and various
transferases.

The initial 8-fold sequencing and assembly of a grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) inbred Pinot noir genome
(PN40024) lead to the prediction of 89 grapevine TPS
(VvTPS) genes, which mirrors a vibrant role for terpenoid secondary metabolism in grapevine biology [7,8].
For example, in wine made from aromatic grape varieties, monoterpene alcohols such as linalool, geraniol,
and cis-rose oxide impart important floral flavour qualities [9]. Sesquiterpenes have also been identified as
important indicators of grape aroma. Recently, Parker
et al. [10] identified a-ylangene as a sesquiterpene metabolite marker associated with peppery aroma and taste
in Australian Shiraz grape berries, and the sesquiterpene
ketone, rotundone, was found to be the compound
responsible for this attribute in peppery/spicy Australian
Shiraz grapes and wines [11]. Monoterpenes such as
1,8-cineol, and sesquiterpenes such as a-humulene,
b-caryophyllene as wells as a- and g-muurolene have
been described in Cabernet Sauvignon pre-veraison berries [12]. Similar profiles of terpene volatiles have also
been documented from the headspace above Chardonnay leaves, flowers, and green berries [13]. The presence
of some terpenes early in berry development and in
other parts of the plant may indicate a role in defense.
Terpenoid volatiles are released from grapevines following insect feeding [14] or the application of methyl jasmonate [15].
Of all plant species for which genome sequences are
available, the TPS gene family has been comprehensively
explored only in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which 32
intact AtTPS genes were identified [16]; functions have
been established for several of these genes [17-20]. A
number of TPS genes have also been characterized
against the background of the sequenced rice (Oryza
sativa) genome [21-26] which has at least 40 TPS-like
sequences identified (S. Aubourg unpublished results).
For comparison, genome sequence analysis of poplar
(Populus trichocarpa) identified 47 TPS genes [27], only
two of which have been functionally characterized
[28,29]. Prior to the sequencing of a grapevine genome,
we reported on the cDNA cloning and product profiles
of three VvTPS [30,31] and we detailed the involvement
of valencene synthase, a sesquiterpene synthase, in the
evolution of grapevine floral scent [32], but a comprehensive analysis of VvTPS has not been reported thus
far.
The importance of terpenoids in grapevine biology and
wine flavour and quality motivated a genome-wide inventory and functional characterization of the VvTPS gene
family. We present the manually curated annotation of
the VvTPS gene family from the current 12-fold genome
sequence coverage. This work defines 69 putatively functional VvTPS, 20 partial VvTPS, and 63 probable VvTPS
pseudogenes including VvTPS gene architecture and

chromosome localizations. The VvTPS gene family shows
extensive gene duplication and in many instances, functional diversification across all subfamilies except those
involved in primary metabolism (subfamilies TPS-c and
TPS-e). Conclusions regarding diversification are supported by phylogenetic analyses of the VvTPS family and
functional characterization of heterologously expressed
VvTPS proteins.

Results and Discussion
Genome-wide identification of TPS genes in Vitis vinifera

Screening of the predicted proteome and the six-framestranslated 12-fold genome sequence of V. vinifera with
protein sequences of previously characterized TPS identified 152 loci exhibiting significant similarities with
known TPS (see the Methods section for details). Our
annotation of the 152 TPS-like gene models (Additional
File 1) classified them into four types: (i) 53 are complete VvTPS genes that contain the expected functional
motifs and domains [16,33,34] required to render them
functional; (ii) 16 are complete VvTPS genes but the
ORFs contain a frameshift or premature stop codon
either due to a point mutation or a possible sequencing
error; (iii) 20 are partial TPS genes disrupted by
sequence gaps or located in scaffold extremities; and (iv)
63 are obvious pseudogenes disrupted by numerous
deletions, frameshifts and/or stop codons (Additional
File 1). After removing the genes of this last type, the
number of potentially functional VvTPS ranges from a
minimum of 53 up to 89 genes. The missing sequences
of the partial genes (group iii) prevented meaningful
sequence alignments and gene classification; therefore,
we removed them from our further analysis which
focused on the 69 VvTPS genes of groups (i) and (ii).
The presence of cognate EST and/or cDNA sequences
provides proof of transcription for 40 (58%) of them
(Additional File 1).
The relatively high gene sequence and structure conservation across the plant TPS family [16] allow us to be
confident in the result of the genome-wide VvTPS gene
prediction, combining automatic and manual annotations. Manual curation and evaluation have substantially
improved the identification of VvTPS genes: For example, out of the 69 VvTPS genes 12 were missed by the
automated pipeline used for annotation of the grapevine
genome [1,35]. Furthermore, intron-exon structures of
40 VvTPS genes required manual correction to obtain
complete and consistent coding sequences. The results
of the VvTPS gene annotations confirmed a large VvTPS
gene family previously predicted from the 8-fold genome
assembly [1] and expand the previous estimation of the
VvTPS family size. While a lower estimate of only 35
VvTPS genes was reported from the analysis of a second
heterozygous Pinot noir genome sequence [36], the

sequence information available for this genome in NCBI
GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank also
revealed about 70 VvTPS. A comparison with other
plant genomes in which TPS genes have been annotated
showed that the grapevine VvTPS gene family is the largest identified to date. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 32 complete AtTPS genes and eight
AtTPS pseudogenes [16], while the rice and poplar genomes are predicted to encode 40 to 50 TPS-like genes
according to [27] and unpublished results (S. Aubourg).
Annotation of VvTPS relative to the overall plant TPS
gene family

The 69 candidate VvTPS sequences identified as intact
or potentially intact represent five of the seven plant
TPS gene subfamilies TPS-a through TPS-g previously
described [16,33,37] (Figure 1; Additional File 1). The
TPS-f subfamily of Clarkia brewerii linalool synthaselike genes and the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily [33], were the only subfamilies missing full-length
VvTPS members. Although the previous 8-fold grapevine genome assembly [1] contained one VvTPS-f subfamily member, in the manually curated assembly and
annotation of the 12-fold genome sequence, this gene
was now fragmented into two partial TPS (Additional
File 1).
The TPS-a subfamily is substantially extended in
grapevine with 30 VvTPS existing on just two chromosomes, chromosomes 18 and 19, compared to 22 AtTPS
of the TPS-a subfamily in A. thaliana [16]. This subfamily typically contains sesquiterpene synthases and possibly diterpene synthases of secondary metabolism. A
total of 19 VvTPS were found in the TPS-b subfamily of
angiosperm monoterpene synthases and these were
located on at least three chromosomes, chromosomes 8,
12 and 13. The TPS-g subfamily, which contains
synthases for acyclic monoterpenes of floral scent [37] is
greatly extended in grapevine with 17 VvTPS annotated
compared to Arabidopsis with just one AtTPS gene in
this subfamily. The chromosomal location of most of
the VvTPS of the TPS-g subfamily is unknown. We
found two VvTPS of the TPS-c subfamily and one
VvTPS of the TPS-e subfamily. These two subfamilies
contain TPS genes of primary plant hormone metabolism that are not typically represented with multiple
gene copies in plant genomes [16,33,38].

largest VvTPS cluster, localized on chromosome 18 and
spanning 690 kb, contains 20 complete VvTPS genes (all
are members of the TPS-a subfamily), 25 VvTPS pseudogenes and numerous traces of Copia-like retrotransposons (Figure 2). Although many VvTPS cluster
together, of the 152 VvTPS loci, only 2 VvTPS genes
also localize in the vicinity of other putative terpenoid
pathway genes with the same gene orientation: one
(VvTPS42) co-localizes with a prenyltranferase gene and
the other (the pseudogene GSVIVT01014893001) with a
cytochrome P450 gene. Dynamically expanding or contracting clusters of closely related genes can evolve as
the result of unequal cross-over, which enriches genetic
variability but limits the divergence through an opposing
mechanism of gene conversion as has been shown for
plant resistance genes [39,40]. These processes can be
intensified by the presence of pseudogenes which contribute to the frequency of crossing-over and increase in
gene diversity [41]. As previously shown for the Drosophila melanogaster genome, a high density of repeat elements can also impact the recombination dynamic
within gene clusters [42]. The genome architecture of
the VvTPS gene family (i.e., the number, size and nature
of VvTPS clusters in the grapevine genome) suggests a
large potential for diversification and variation of terpenoid metabolism in this species, and may thus account
for variability of terpenoid profiles among grapevine
varieties and cultivars. The identification of VvTPS gene
clusters allows for future work in which resequencing of
these regions in different varieties and testing for associations of gene cluster and terpenoid aroma traits can
be undertaken.
Intron-exon structure of VvTPS genes

In agreement with highly conserved intron-exon structure of plant TPS genes [16,43,44], all but one of the 66
VvTPS genes of the subfamilies TPS-a, TPS-b and TPS-g
contain seven coding exons (Figure 3). The only exception is VvTPS17 (TPS-a) in which the 3’-most exon was
disrupted by a large and probably recent intron insertion. The three genes of the subfamilies TPS-c and
TPS-e are characterized by longer sequences (15 and 13
exons respectively) as a consequence of the presence of
an additional exon encoding an ancestral 200 amino
acid N-terminal domain of unknown function [16,33,38].
Conserved motifs of the V. vinifera TPS protein family

Chromosomal location of VvTPS

The topological organization of the VvTPS family in the
grapevine genome is characterized by massively tandemly repeated genes. Of the complete set of 152
VvTPS loci identified in this study, 129 (85%) are organized in 13 distinct clusters covering from 2 to 45
VvTPS genes or pseudogenes (Additional File 1). The

The grapevine VvTPS protein family is characterized by
two large domains defined in the PFAM resource [45]:
PF01397 corresponds to the N-terminal region and
PF03936 corresponds to the C-terminal metal cofactor
binding domain [46]. Just upstream of the PF01397 Nterminal domain, in the region encoded by the first
exon, all VvTPS that putatively function as monoterpene

synthases, also contain the RR(x)8W motif. This motif
may play a role in the initiation of the isomerizationcyclization reaction [47] or act to stabilize the protein
through electrostatic interactions [48]; however, TPS in
subfamily TPS-g, as well as two VvTPS predicted in
TPS-a, and those in TPS-c and TPS-e do not consistently contain this motif or they have a highly modified
version of it (Figure 3 and 4A). Several of the TPS-g
members are also truncated with the starting M at position five of this motif. This may effectively open up the
three dimensional structure of these TPS or it may
affect subcellular compartmentation of these proteins.
Mono- and diterpene synthases typically contain an Nterminal plastidial targeting peptide upstream of the
conserved or modified RR(x)8W [33], and such targeting
peptides have been predicted in silico for 21 VvTPS
(Figure 3).
The C-terminal domain contains two highly conserved
aspartate-rich motifs. The first of these, the DDxxD
motif (Figure 3), is involved in the coordination of divalent ion(s), water molecules and the stabilization of the
active site [46,49,50]. Only four predicted VvTPS
(VvTPS48, VvTPS66 and the two TPS-c proteins
VvTPS67 and VvTPS68) lack the exact DDxxD motif
characteristic of class I TPS which catalyze reactions
initiated by cleavage of the diphosphate group of the
prenyl diphosphate substrate. The TPS-c proteins are
not expected to have this domain as they do not cleave
the prenyl diphosphate unit; however, they do contain
the DXDD sequence critical to the protonation initiated
reaction mechanism of class II TPS [51].
A second important motif in the C-terminal domain is
the NSE/DTE motif [52,53]. The reported consensus
sequence of this motif is (L,V)(V,L,A)(N,D)D(L,I,V)x(S,
T)xxxE and a modified version, (L,F)(M,I,S,C,W)(N,D)D
(L,M,I)x(S,T,D)xxxE, is found in almost all VvTPS of the
subfamilies TPS-a, -b, and -g (Figure 4B). Three predicted VvTPS are lacking the terminal E. Members of
the TPS-g subfamily have an altered and highly conserved sequence, LWDDLx(S,T)xxxE.
Functional characterization of VvTPS full length cDNAs

Figure 2 Genomic organization of a 690 kb multi-gene VvTPS
cluster. A 690 kb long genomic region of chromosome 18 contains
a large cluster of 20 complete VvTPS-a genes (dark green arrows),
25 pseudo-TPS-a genes characterized by several deletions,
frameshifts and/or stop codons (light green arrows), few traces of
other genes (orange arrows) and numerous vestiges of the Copialike transposable element (yellow arrows).

Since specific functions of TPS genes cannot be accurately predicted from sequence analysis alone, it was
important to clone and functionally characterize VvTPS
full length (FL)cDNAs. We used the previously published 8-fold [1] and the new 12-fold genome sequence
(GenBank, NCBI project ID 18785) assembly of the
Pinot noir inbred line for primer design to clone VvTPS
FLcDNAs from three grapevine varieties, Pinot noir
(PN), Cabernet Sauvignon (CS), and Gewürztraminer
(Gw). FLcDNAs were expressed in E. coli using one of
several cloning vectors (see Materials and Methods),
and recombinant VvTPS proteins were functionally

putative intact VvTPS gene models. Green arrows and black lines represent at scale protein coding exons and introns, respectively. The
conserved motifs RR(x)8W and DDxxD are represented by yellow and red boxes, respectively. Green circles indicate the prediction of an Nterminal plastidial targeting peptide. Classification into subfamilies is based on phylogenetic analyses supported, where applicable, by
corresponding functional data. Subfamilies TPS-a, TPS-b and TPS-g are characterized by a highly conserved structure of seven exons. The three

characterized via purified protein or in vivo recombinant
E. coli assays with each of the following potential substrates, geranyl diphosphate (C10, GPP), (E,E)-farnesyl
diphosphate (C15, FPP), and (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl
diphosphate (C20, GGPP). Although a couple of recent
studies identified two tomato TPS which utilize neryl
diphosphate or (Z,Z)-farnesyl diphosphate as substrates
[54,55], these TPS are members of the TPS-e subfamily
and none of the VvTPS that we characterized belonged
to this subfamily. In addition, a screen of the grapevine
genome sequence did not reveal the presence of Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (unpublished results, M.

Chavez, S. Aubourg, and J. Bohlmann), therefore, we did
not include these alternative substrates when assaying
for VvTPS activity. Products were analyzed by GCMS
and the majority of VvTPS analyzed produced multiple
products (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4), which
is a common feature of plant TPS [56,57]. Since many
of the VvTPS FLcDNAs arose from cloning efforts in all
three V. vinifera varieties PN, CS, and Gw, a number of
VvTPS were uncovered as cultivar-specific variants, each
differing by only a few amino acids. To ensure that
these were not unique genes capable of producing a distinct product profile, each variant was functionally

of Streptoccoccus pneumoniae was subcloned into a bacterial expression vector together with the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae FPP synthase. VvTPS FLcDNAs were additionally expressed into this engineered strain and product
formation was measured by GCMS in the culture
extract as has been done for the characterization of
other TPS and cytochrome P450 s [59].
Nomenclature for functionally characterized VvTPS
FLcDNAs

We assigned gene identifiers that include references to
both function and the cultivar (PN, CS, or Gw) from
which the gene was isolated (see Functional Gene ID in
Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). These functional gene identifiers will be used throughout the following sections to describe individual genes. Table 1,
Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 provide additional detailed
information for each FLcDNA regarding clone ID, tissue
origin (see table legend), product profiles with relative
quantitative information, as well as identification of the
closest annotated VvTPS gene model reported in this
paper. In some instances multiple cDNAs share the
same functional gene identifier, but are represented as

distinct genes because they occupy unique locations
within the VvTPS phylogeny. These functional gene IDs
are designated with numbers in both the tables and
within the phylogenetic trees.
Functions of VvTPS FLcDNAs of the TPS-a Subfamily

The majority of VvTPS genes belong to the TPS-a subfamily for which we functionally characterized 13 unique
FLcDNAs (Table 1). All of the VvTPS-a members were
characterized as sesquiterpene synthases, and all but one
formed multiple products with FPP as substrate. In several cases, the product profiles included both terpenoid
hydrocarbons and alcohols. As a group, the VvTPS of
the TPS-a subfamily produce a diverse array of sesquiterpene products.
All five individual VvGwECar and VvPNECar FLcDNA
clones produced predominantly (E)-b-caryophyllene. Four
of these clones also produced a-humulene and a small
amount of germacrene D, while one clone (CAN82172)
produced only (E)-b-caryophyllene (94%) and a-humulene
(6%). The two VvPNECar enzymes characterized in metabolically engineered E. coli (clones CAO16256 and
CAN82172) showed similar product profiles to VvGwECar
clones characterized by in vitro enzyme assays. One of the
VvPNECar enzyme (CAO16256) also produced a low
amount ( < 1%) of an unknown sesquiterpene alcohol in
addition to (E)-b-caryophyllene, a-humulene and germacrene D. The TPS VvGwGerA (Gw38F3) produced primarily germacrene A (52%) and a-selinene (24%) and a small
amount of selin-11-en-4-a-ol (12%). The product profile of
VvGwaBer (Gw56B1) consisted of (E)-a-bergamotene
(56%), zingiberenol (17%) and nerolidol (14%) as well as

two minor compounds. Germacrene D was the primary
product of VvGwGerD (Gw64B1). VvCSAFar (CS102B7)
was the only single-product member of the TPS-a subfamily identified here, producing 100% (E,E)-a-farnesene. Two
products, g-cadinene (83%) and an unidentified sesquiterpene (17%), were the only detected products of VvGwgCad
(Gw330M5). VvPNbCur (PN62M1) produced b-curcumene (22%) (E)-g-bisabolene (18%), iso-italicene) (16%),
(-)-a-bisabolol (14%), and at least 9 additional products.
The VvPNSesq (CAO16252) generated a sesquiterpene
olefin as major product that was not identified unambiguously by GCMS. The product was, therefore, produced in
larger quantity, purified by preparative GC and identified
by NMR spectroscopy as sesquithujene ((1 S,5S)-2-methyl-

5-((R)-6-methylhept-5-en-2-yl)bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene).
Additional reaction products of this TPS included a-bergamotene, sesquisabinene, b- and g-bisabolene, b-bisabolol
and a trace amount of an unidentified sequiterpene alcohol. VvPNaZin (CAO16257) is a zingiberene synthase that
also produced b-sesquiphellandrene and b-bisabolene. The
two major products generated by VvPNSeInt (CAO39293)
were found to be selina 4,11-diene and intermedeol. At
least, five other sesquiterpenes including a-guaiene, selina
5,11-diene, g-selinene, and 7-epi-a-selinene, were identified
as reaction products. VvPNCuCAD (CAN76781) encodes
a multi-product sesquiterpene synthase capable of producing cubebol, δ-cadinene, a-copaene, a-cubebene and an
unknown sesquiterpene alcohol as dominant reaction

Terpenoids produced by individual VvTPS clones when incubated with GPP (*) or FPP (**) are listed. Where noted are trifunctional TPS capable of producing

products; additional minor products included a-gurjunene,
g-cadinene, b-cubebene and an unknown sesquiterpene.
The VvPNaHum (CAN64791) produced a-humulene
(56%), (E)- b-caryophyllene (6.5%) and a sesquiterpene
alcohol (37.5%) that we initially failed to identify by GCMS;
the latter compound was then produced in milligram
quantities, purified by liquid chromatography and identified by 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy as hyemalol
(3,7,10,10-tetramethylcycloundeca-3,7-dien-1-ol) a humulane-type sesquiterpenoid recently discovered in Zanthoxylum hyemale [60]. VvPNEb/2epiCar (CAO39418), was
identified as a third type of caryophyllene synthase, which
in contrast to VvPNECar and VvGwECar also catalyzed
the formation of 2-epi-(E)-b-caryophyllene as a substantial
(25%) product.
Collectively, these characterized VvTPS-a enzymes
produce some of the major sesquiterpenes identified
from grapevine. Furthermore, the prevalence of VvTPS
producing (E)-b-caryophyllene, a-humulene and germacrene D may in part explain the reported prominence of
these compounds in grapevine berries and vegetative tissues [12-15].

(Table 2). All of the characterized VvTPS genes of this
group produce monoterpenes, and most are multi-product enzymes. The products of VvGwaPhe included
(+)-a-phellandrene (40%), myrcene (15%), terpinolene
(15%), and seven other minor products. VvPNaPIN produced (+)-a-pinene (47%), (+)-limonene (25%), (+)-camphene (9%), and eight other minor products. Five of the
nine VvTPS of the TPS-b subfamily (VvGwbOci,
VvCSbOci, VvCSbOciM, VvGwbOciF, VvCSbOciF) produced (E)-b-ocimene as a major product with individual
variations of additional products. VvGwbOci and
VvCSbOci produced additional minor amounts of (Z)-bocimene; VvCSbOciM produced additional major
amounts of myrcene (42%) along with minor amounts
of b-pinene and limonene; VvGwbOciF and VvCSbOciF
also converted FPP into (E,E)-a-farnesene. Lastly,
VvPNRLin produced a single oxygenated product, (3R)linalool. Together the VvTPS-b subfamily members
account for many of the acyclic and cyclic monoterpene
hydrocarbons and a few of the monoterpene alcohols
found in Vitis vinifera.

identified three unique gene functions (Table 3). All
VvTPS of this group produce exclusively acyclic terpene
alcohols, but the three types differ by their range of substrates. The first type of VvTPS gene function within the
TPS-g subfamily is represented by three genes,
VvPNLinNer1, VvPNLinNer2, and VvCSLinNer. These
enzymes accept two substrates, C10 GPP and C15 FPP,
and produce (3S)-linalool and (E)-nerolidol, respectively
(Table 3). The second group is represented by four
VvPNLNGl enzymes which also accept the additional
C20 substrate GGPP to produce (E,E)-geranyl linalool.
The third unique function in this subfamily is represented by three genes, VvGwGer, VvCSGer and
VvPNGer, which had activity only with GPP to produce
geraniol. While seven of the VvTPS of the TPS-g subfamily accept more than one substrate in vitro and contribute potentially to the formation of terpene alcohols
of different chain lengths, it is not known whether these
enzymes indeed encounter more than one type of substrate in vivo.
Functions of VvTPS FLcDNAs of the TPS-f subfamily

Although the analysis of the 12-fold genome sequence
coverage did not identify any intact VvTPS genes of the
TPS-f subfamily, a unique VvTPS function of the TPS-f
subfamily was characterized with the two FLcDNAs
VvCSENerGl and VvPNENerGl (Table 4). These
enzymes accepted either FPP or GGPP to produce (E)nerolidol or (E,E)-geranyl linalool, respectively. Unlike
the VvTPS of the TPS-g these enzymes had no activity
with GPP. VvCSENerGl and VvPNENerGl are only 62%
identical and 76% similar on an amino acid level.
Phylogeny of functionally characterized VvTPS and VvTPS
gene models

The phylogenetic analyses presented here include V.
vinifera TPS from the 12-fold sequence assembly of the
nearly homozygous Pinot noir genotype [1] and the
functionally characterized VvTPS described here. The
analyses also included full-length TPS sequences that
contained the known TPS motifs predicted from the
genome assembly of the heterozygous Pinot noir genotype [36] for a more complete annotation of the VvTPS
family. In this way, we have integrated the predictions
of VvTPS gene models from the two grapevine genome
sequences [1,36] in a compatible fashion and we are
proposing a unified VvTPS classification and
nomenclature.
Within the TPS-a subfamily of sesquiterpene
synthases the functionally characterized VvTPS are close
to most of the VvTPS predicted in the 12-fold genome
sequence assembly (Figure 5). This topology suggests
that the diversity of functions for grapevine sesquiterpene synthases is well represented with the functionally

Page 12 of 22

characterized VvTPS described in this work. Relative to
TPS-a enzymes of other plant species, the VvTPS exhibit
a large paralogous cluster with VvTPS-a members more
closely related to one another than they are to TPS
from other species, regardless of function. Paralogous
TPS gene clusters were found previously for other species examined in depth such as A. thaliana [16] and
Norway spruce [56] and indicate post-speciation gene
duplication events. The large number of VvTPS-a suggests that this subfamily plays an important role in
grapevine biology.
VvTPS of the TPS-b subfamily fall into two clades,
VvTPS-b clade I and VvTPS-b clade II, bifurcated by
representative TPS from other plants (Figure 6). The
majority of the VvTPS of clade I make cyclic products
while those of clade II produce only acyclic terpenoids.
It is possible that clade-specific conserved sequence features determine whether a TPS is able to produce cyclic
or acyclic products [53]; thus, the two clades may represent an evolutionary pattern of sub-functionalization
from cyclic-product TPS in clade I to those TPS producing acyclic products in clade II. In contrast to other
TPS subfamilies, the VvTPS clades of the TPS-b subfamily include members that have functional equivalents in
distantly related species. For example, Lotus japonica
(E)-b-ocimene synthase clusters closely with grapevine
ocimene synthases. Malus x domestica (E,E)-a-farnesene
synthases also clusters closest to VvTPS of the same
function. This pattern suggests that these functions
arose prior to speciation events.
The TPS-g subfamily of plant TPS was defined by previous work on TPS of floral scent biosynthesis in snapdragon (Anthirrrhinum majus) [37]. Phylogenetic
analyses that include the large number of VvTPS gene
(Figure 1) conclusively resolved a bifurcation of the
TPS-b and TPS-g subfamilies at a juncture that was previously ambiguous and had misclassified some TPS-g
genes as TPS-b members. Specifically, the newly characterized grapevine geraniol synthase VvPNGer which
matches gene model VvTPS52 (Figure 1) as well as the
geraniol and linalool synthases from basil (Ocimum
basilicum) (Figure 7), clustered closely with the TPS-g
subfamily. The phylogenetic proximity between the basil
and grapevine geraniol synthases indicates that these
TPS functions already existed in a common ancestor. In
contrast, the remaining VvTPS of the TPS-g subfamily,
which are all linalool/nerolidol synthases, cluster closest
to other VvTPS. As mentioned above, the entire predicted VvTPS-g subfamily has a conserved NSF/DTE
motif (Figure 4). This same motif is present in the
cloned VvTPS cDNAs as well as other members of the
TPS-g subfamily from different species. Prominent in
this motif of the VvTPS-g members is a W in the second
position; this residue may affect the magnesium binding

Martin et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:226
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/226

and/or substrate orientation. Also noteworthy is the
highly modified or absent RRX 8 W motif from this
group of TPS (Figure 4) and which may imply that
these acyclic products are formed via the geranyl cation
rather than the linalyl cation [37,53].
The TPS-e and TPS-c subfamilies in V. vinifera contain one and two members, respectively (Figure 8).
Although these were not functionally characterized in
this paper, they are almost certainly involved as diterpene synthases in ent-kaurene biosynthesis [61]. Surprisingly, the 12-fold sequence coverage of the grapevine
genome did not reveal any members of the TPS-f subfamily; however, our FLcDNA cloning identified two
members of this subfamily and both were characterized
as nerolidol/geranyl linalool synthases (Figure 8). These
are related to the Clarkia brewerii linalool synthases
[62] and the recently characterized A. thaliana geranyl
linalool synthase [20], each of which produces acyclic
terpene alcohols as a functional signature of this
subfamily.

Conclusions
The present study provides the first comprehensive
annotation of the very large VvTPS gene family with
regard to chromosomal localization, enzyme functions,
and phylogeny relative to the overall plant TPS gene
family. The VvTPS gene family is one of the largest
gene families of specialized (i.e., secondary) metabolism
in grapevine where TPS enzymes contribute to berry
and wine flavour, floral scent and potentially a diversity
of other biological functions such as defense and resistance. The emerging profile of the VvTPS family
described here illustrates how this large gene family has
expanded across the genome through gene duplication
events and functional diversification. Notably, the large
number of functionally diverse sesquiterpene synthases
identified in our biochemical characterization of the
VvTPS-a genes suggests that these enzymes and their
products may contribute substantially to grapevine biology and wine quality. The recent reports of sesquiterpenes in Shiraz grapes and wine [10,11] or the
identification of sesquiterpene volatiles in anthers and
pollen of grapevine flowers [32] are early insights to the
emerging roles for sesquiterpene metabolism in V.
vinifera.
Phylogenetic analyses of the VvTPS show a result
similar to many plant species studied thus far in that
most of the VvTPS form clusters of paralogous genes
within the plant TPS family. This finding indicates a
dominant process of post-speciation gene duplications,
although there are also examples of conserved TPS
functions of a more ancient order. Furthermore, our
analyses substantiate separation of the TPS-b and the
TPS-g subfamilies. The separation based on sequence

Page 13 of 22

relatedness is matched by separation of gene functions,
since all known members of the TPS-g subfamily produce acyclic products.
Of the monoterpene synthases presented here, those
that produce (3S)-linalool (VvTPS-g), geraniol (VvTPSg), and the previously identified a-terpineol synthase
(VvTPS-b) will be of much interest to viticulturalists and
wine makers as these are some of the most prevalent
compounds responsible for the floral characteristics of
aromatic varieties. Furthermore, compounds such as
geraniol and linalool can be further modified in grape
musts and wine to produce citronellol, rose oxide, and
wine lactone [63,64]. Linalool and a-terpineol have also
been found to contribute to the character of nonaromatic red grapevine varieties [65]. It is conceivable
that different viticultural regimes may modify the
expression of these TPS in grape berries and can thereby
impact the quality of the resultant wines.
While many of the terpenoid products of the VvTPS
enzymes characterized here have been described in the
viticulture and oenology literature [8,66], still several
have yet to be associated with traits in grapes or wine.
Taken together, the present VvTPS genomic annotations
and the VvTPS functional characterizations provide a
reference framework for future studies, including transcript and protein expression profiling, as well as terpenoid molecular marker development through, for
example association mapping.

Methods
VvTPS gene discovery and manual annotation

The predicted proteome of the 12-fold coverage grapevine genome sequence assembly (GenBank, NCBI project ID 18785; Genoscope website: http://www.
genoscope.cns.fr/externe/GenomeBrowser/Vitis/) was
screened with two HMM profiles of the PFAM motifs
[45] PF01397 (N-terminal TPS domain) and PF03936
(TPS, metal binding domain). In addition, the 12-fold
genome sequence assembly was screened (TBLASTN)
with known TPS sequences from Swiss-Prot in order to
be not dependent of the automatic annotation. The 152
loci exhibiting significant similarities with known TPS
(all BLAST hits with an e-value lower than 1.e-4 were
individually evaluated) were manually annotated to correct erroneous automatic annotation and to discriminate
between complete, partial and pseudo-TPS. Genomic
regions with similarities spanning on less than 50 amino
acids with TPS have not been considered. The manual
annotation is based on the results of the EuGène predictor-combiner software [67] that was specifically trained
for Vitis vinifera, sequence alignments with previously
characterized TPS proteins and related PFAM motifs,
spliced alignments [68] of cognate EST and cDNA
sequences and knowledge of TPS gene structure and

protein sequences. Data and other related information
were imported and merged in the ARTEMIS tool [69]
to evaluate each resource and produce the final annotation. The EuGène predictions, the manual structural
annotation of the 152 loci and the corresponding
sequences are available in the FLAGdb ++ database
http://urgv.evry.inra.fr/FLAGdb[70]. Protein sequences
deduced from the 69 full VvTPS genes were analyzed
with ChloroP for prediction of N-terminal plastidial targeting peptides [71]
Phylogenetic Analyses

Amino acid alignments were made using Dialign (dialign.gobics.de/anchor/submission.php) with a threshold
value of 10. Manual adjustments such as aligning conserved motifs and manual trimming were performed
using GeneDoc http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc. For
all analyses, sequence information upstream of the partially conserved RR(X) 8 W motif was trimmed. Maximum likelihood analyses were completed using Phyml
[72] available at http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.
For each analysis, the LG amino acid substitution model
and four substitution rate categories were used, the proportion of invariable sites and the gamma distribution
parameter were estimated, and the branch lengths and
tree topology were optimized from the data set. The
estimated values for the proportion of invariable sites
and the gamma shape parameter were then used when
performing 100 bootstrap replicas. Phylogenetic trees
were visualized using TreeView http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html.
RNA isolation and VvTPS cDNA cloning

RNA was isolated from Gewürztraminer, Pinot noir, and
Cabernet Sauvignon grapevine shoot cuttings grown in
the greenhouse as previously described [32]. RNA was
isolated from stem (S), leaf (L), berry (B), root (R) and
flower (F) tissues (see FLcDNA ID in Table 1, Table 2,
Table 3, and Table 4) as detailed in Reid et al. [73]. To
up-regulate expression of TPS genes, a subset of grapevine cuttings were treated with methyl jasmonate (0.01%
v/v in water and 0.1% Tween) two days prior to RNA
isolation. The Superscript Vilo cDNA synthesis kit
(http://www.invitrogen.com was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Primers for VvTPS cDNA
cloning were designed based on TPS sequences obtained
through iterative BLAST searches in NCBI GenBank
using members of each of the TPS subfamilies. Additional information for the design of PCR primers came
from the predicted VvTPS gene models identified in the
12-fold genome sequence assembly. To increase the
likelihood of a successful PCR amplification of VvTPS
cDNAs, cDNA templates from various tissues from the
same cultivar were often combined. These clones are

Page 18 of 22

designated “M” for mixed template while those TPS
cloned from individual tissues are labeled with the single
letter abbreviations described above (Table 1, Table 2,
Table 3, and Table 4). PCR reactions were done using
touchdown PCR with proofreading polymerases, as per
the product manufacturer’s instructions. PCR products
of the expected sizes were cloned into the pJet1.2 cloning vector http://www.fermentas.com and transformed
into E. coli a-select cells http://www.bioline.com. Plasmids containing a correctly sized insert were sequenced
followed by insert amplification and ligation into the
pET28b expression vector (Novagen, http://www.emdchemicals.com) using sticky end PCR [74]. When cloning difficulties were encountered, as was the case with
several sequences, pASK-IBA3plus (IBA, http://www.ibago.com) vector was used [20].
Expression of recombinant VvTPS proteins, in vitro
enzyme assays and product identifications by GCMS

For TPS protein expression, Cip41 Rare E. coli cells [75]
containing recombinant VvTPS plasmids were grown
until 0.8 OD, induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and then
grown for an additional 16 h at 16 °C. Recombinant
VvTPS were partially purified using His SpinTrap
columns (GE Biosciences, http://www.apbiotech.com).
Protein expression was verified using silver stained SDSPAGE gels and western blot analysis using Murine antipolyHistidine Monoclonal antibody (1/4000 dilution,
Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (CalBiochem, http://www.emdchemicals.com). For
Strep-tag II clones, the pASK-IBA3plus vector combined
with Cip41 Rare cells were used for expression and protein
was isolated as per the manufacturer’s instructions using a
Strep-Tactin affinity purification column (IBA).
For functional enzyme characterization, approximately
100 μg total protein of semi-purified recombinant
VvTPS were added to a single vial assay in 50 μL total
volume as described [32,75,76]. Each recombinant
VvTPS was incubated with GPP (109 μM), (E,E)-FPP
(92 μM) or (E,E,E)-GGPP (20 μM) for 2 h at 30 °C. Buffers used for sesquiterpene and diterpene synthase
assays contained 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2,
20 μM MnCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 1 mM DTT. For
monoterpene synthase assays, the buffer consisted of 50
mM HEPES pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 μM MnCl2 100
mM KCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 1 mM DTT.
Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry
(GCMS) analysis was employed to determine the product profiles of each TPS as previously described
[32,56]. Columns used to separate product mixtures
included HP-5MS (Agilent), DB-Wax (Agilent), SolGelWax (SGE), and Cyclodex-B (Aglient) for chiral analyses. For sesquiterpene analysis, a cool-on column inlet

Martin et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:226
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/226

(starting temperature of 35 °C and track oven program
after injection) was used to prevent thermo-rearrangements of terpenes in the injector. Identities of individual
terpenes were made using a combination of authentic
standards and/or retention indices along with MS library
matches (including WileyNist 2005, [77], and/or MassFinder4 [massfinder.com/wiki/MassFinder_4]).
In vivo enzyme assays using metabolically engineered
E. coli

A subset of VvTPS encoding sesquiterpene synthases
were codon-optimized for expression in E. coli, using
gene synthesis by DNA2.0 https://www.dna20.com/ and
subcloned into the pET-3a or pET-Duet1 expression
plasmids (Novagen, http://www.emdchemicals.com).
Enzymatic activity was assessed in E. coli cells coexpressing the TPS together with the enzymes of a fivestep biosynthetic pathway converting mevalonic acid to
FPP. The FPP synthase gene was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and ligated into the first multiple
cloning site (MCS) of the pACYCDuet-1 expression
plasmid (Novagen, http://www.emdchemicals.com) providing the plasmid FPPs-pACYCDuet. An operon
encoding the genes for a mevalonate kinase (MvaK1), a
phosphomevalonate kinase (MvaK2), a mevalonate
diphosphate decarboxylase (MvaD) and an isopentenyl
diphospahte isomerase (idi) was amplified from genomic
DNA of Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC BAA-334)
and ligated into the second MCS of the FPPs-pACYCDuet plasmid providing the plasmid pACYCDuet-4506.
BL21 Star™(DE3) E. coli cells http://www.invitrogen.com
were co-transformed with the plasmids, pACYCDuet4506 and either of the pET series plasmids harboring
candidate VvTPS coding sequences. Single colonies were
used to inoculate 5 mL of LB medium supplemented
with carbenicillin (50 mg/mL) and chloramphenicol (34
mg/mL). Cultures were incubated overnight at 37°C.
The next day 250 mL to 1 L of Terrific Broth medium
supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics were
inoculated with 1/100 volume of the overnight culture.
After 6 h incubation at 37°C, cultures were cooled down
to 28°C and then 1 mM IPTG, 2 mg/mL mevalonate
prepared by dissolving mevalonolactone http://www.sigmaaldrich.com in 0.5N NaOH at a concentration of 1 g/
mL and incubating the solution for 30 min at 37°C) and
0.1 volume of decane were added to the cultures. After
48 h incubation, the decane fraction was directly analysed by GCMS on a Hewlett Packard 6890 series GC
system equipped with a DB1 column 30 m × 0.25 mm ×
0.25 mm film thickness http://www.agilent.com and
coupled with a 5975 series mass spectrometer. The carrier gas was helium at a constant flow of 1 ml.min -1 .
Injection was in splitless mode with the injector temperature set at 120°C and the oven temperature was

Page 19 of 22

programmed from 60°C to 265°C at 5°C.min-1. Identification of VvTPS products was based on retention time
index, mass spectra of authentic standards, and on published [78] or Firmenich MS database. Co-injections
were also used for some of the compounds (caryophyllene, humulene, cubebol, cubebene, intermedeol). For
compounds that could not be identified by GCMS, the
products were purified and their structures determined
by NMR spectroscopy. Sesquithujene was isolated using
manual, preparative-GC. The crude sample (bi-phasic
bacteria culture) was first distilled using a Fisher column
to remove the decane (temperature: 95 °C; pressure: 25
mbar). The compounds were then separated using a GC
equipped with a.1.83 m × 2.1 mm i.d., 10% OV -1
packed column at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. The oven
temperature was programmed from 160 °C (held 10
minutes) to 230 °C at 10 °C/min. Helium was used as
the carrier gas. Hyemalol was purified by silica gel flash
column chromatography (Silicagel 60, 12*150 mm, 4063 μM, Merck) using a 98:2 mixture of toluene and
diethyl ether as solvent system. NMR data were
acquired at 298 K using a Bruker Avance 500 MHz
spectrometer. The structure was established by 1 D 1Hand 13 C- NMR, as well as 2 D HSQC, COSY and
HMBC experiments.

Additional material
Additional file 1: The Excel file contains all the information relative
to the 152 TPS loci detected and curated in the 12-fold PN40024
grapevine genome. The content of each column is: - Name: VvTPS
nomenclature for the 69 complete terpene synthases. - Gene ID (12x):
The official ID of the gene automatically annotated by IGGP
(International Grape Genome Program) and used by GenBank/EMBL. The
genes called ‘newX’ correspond to TPS loci completely missed by the
automatic annotation pipeline. The curated gene structures and
sequences are available in the FLAGdb++ database http://urgv.evry.inra.fr/
FLAGdb. - merged ID: If the re-annotated TPS genes fit or overlap with
several IGGP consecutive genes (erroneous splitting of the automatic
annotation), their IDs are mentioned here. - Prot size: The size (in amino
acids) of the re-annotated TPS proteins. For not complete or coherent
CDS (partial or pseudo-TPS), the size fits with the longest rebuilt protein
sequence (in italic). - Chr: The chromosome number. ‘10R’ means that
the gene is on the chromosome 10 but on a not mapped scaffold. ‘R’
means that the gene is inside an unmapped scaffold. - Exons: Number of
annotated exons in the CDS (after curation). - Subfamily: Classification of
TPS (TPS-a to TPS-g) according to the phylogeny and functional studies.
The table is colored according to this column. - DDxxD: ‘yes’ means that
the exact motif is present at the expected position (end of the exon 4).
‘?’ means that the corresponding part of the gene is absent (partial gene
or pseudogene). - RRx(8)W: ‘yes’ means that the exact motif is present at
the expected position (end of the exon 1). ‘?’ means that the
corresponding part of the gene is absent (partial gene or pseudogene). NSE/DTE: sequence of the NSE/DTE motif present in the C-terminal
region of the proteins from TPS-a, -b and -g subfamilies. - Start: first
position of the curated CDS in the 12-fold pseudo-chromosomes. - Stop:
last position of the curated CDS in the 12-fold pseudo-chromosomes. Strand: ‘m’ means minus strand and ‘p’ means plus strand relatively to
the pseudo-chromosomes. - Manual re-annotation result: information
about the evaluation and curation process. Protein IDs are listed for the
VvTPS genes where automatic annotation predicted a correct structure. Type: ‘full’ means that the TPS gene (CDS) is complete, without sequence

Martin et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:226
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/226

problem. ‘full ?’ means that CDS is complete excepted one punctual
sequence problem. A sequencing error is therefore possible and the
gene could be functional. ‘partial’ means that the gene is disrupted by
an un-sequenced region (gap of N) and additional sequencing is
necessary to have a full CDS. ‘pseudo’ means that the gene structure is
disturbed by stop(s) in frame, frameshift(s) and/or deletion(s). As it is, the
gene cannot be functional and is qualified as pseudogene. - EST: The
number of available cognate transcript sequences. (+) means that the
CDS is fully covered by the EST contig. - Note: Additional information
about the partial genes and pseudogenes (nature of the problem, gap
positions...). - Cluster: TPS with the same letter are organized in tandem
in the same physical cluster. - Subcell. loc.: The result of the ChloroP
prediction tool. A score greater than 0.5 means that the TPS protein is
probably targeted to the plastids. ‘x’ means that the prediction has not
been done because the N-terminal region of the protein is lacking. - Best
hit in SwissProt: Biochemical function of the first hit obtained in the
SwissProt database with BLASTP.
