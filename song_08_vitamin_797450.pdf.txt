Abstract
Background: Polymorphisms in the vitamin K-epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 gene, Vkorc1,
could affect blood coagulation and other vitamin K-dependent proteins, such as osteocalcin (bone
Gla protein, BGP). Here we sequenced the Vkorc1 gene in 40 mouse priority strains. We analyzed
Vkorc1 haplotypes with respect to prothrombin time (PT) and bone mineral density and
composition (BMD and BMC); phenotypes expected to be vitamin K-dependent and represented
by data in the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD).
Findings: In the commonly used laboratory strains of Mus musculus domesticus we identified only
four haplotypes differing in the intron or 5' region sequence of the Vkorc1. Six haplotypes differing
by coding and non-coding polymorphisms were identified in the other subspecies of Mus. We
detected no significant association of Vkorc1 haplotypes with PT, BMD and BMC within each
subspecies of Mus. Vkorc1 haplotype sequences divergence between subspecies was associated with
PT, BMD and BMC.
Conclusion: Phenotypic variation in PT, BMD and BMC within subspecies of Mus, while
substantial, appears to be dominated by genetic variation in genes other than the Vkorc1. This was
particularly evident for M. m. domesticus, where a single haplotype was observed in conjunction with
virtually the entire range of PT, BMD and BMC values of all 5 subspecies of Mus included in this
study. Differences in these phenotypes between subspecies also should not be attributed to Vkorc1
variants, but should be viewed as a result of genome wide genetic divergence.

Background
The warfarin-sensitive vitamin K epoxide reductase
enzyme complex (VKOR) converts vitamin K 2,3-epoxide
to vitamin K hydroquinone, a required cofactor for the
post-translational gamma-carboxylation of several blood
coagulation factors and other vitamin K-dependent proteins, such as osteocalcin (bone Gla protein, BGP) and
matrix Gla protein (MGP) [1,2]. MGP has also been found
in blood vessel walls and in association with atheroscle-

rotic plaques [3,4]. The vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 gene (Vkorc1) appears to be a critical
component of the VKOR [5,6].
The laboratory mouse is a widely used model organism to
study human physiology and medical conditions. Moreover, the Vkorc1 has recently been discussed in the context
of gene-drug interactions and disease. For example,
genetic polymorphisms in the Vkorc1 could affect anticoPage 1 of 6

agulant therapy with warfarin in humans [7,8]. Genetic
variants in the Vkorc1 have been shown associated with
genetically determined resistance to warfarin in rodents
[6,9]. Genetic polymorphisms in the Vkorc1 gene may also
affect other vitamin K-dependent reactions, such as bone
mineralization and atherosclerotic calcification [10-12].
For example, low VKOR activity may result in lower levels
of post-translational gamma-carboxylation of BGP, and,
conceivably, reduce the BGP-dependent phenotypic
measures bone mineral density (BMD) or bone mineral
content (BMC). Osteoporosis-related fractures have been
postulated side effects of anticoagulant treatment with
warfarin, which inhibits the VKOR [12].

dependent phenotypic measurements could be initiated.
However, so far only 5 Vkorc1 haplotypes have been identified in 16 strains representing 4 subspecies (c.f. MPD,
Perlgen data; accessed September 2008).
This shortage of data prompted us to collect genetic polymorphism data for the Vkorc1 gene in mouse priority
strains. In addition, we explored patterns of association
between Vkorc1 haplotypes and the vitamin K-dependent
phenotypes prothrombin time (PT), bone mineral density
and content (BMD and BMC) currently available in the
MPD.

Methods
So-called mouse priority strains currently are subjected to
intensive phenotyping surveys. The results of these are
accessible via the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD) at the
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine [13]. If genetic variation in the Vkorc1 for the panel of mouse priority strains
would be known then searches for possible associations
of Vkorc1 haplotypes with simple and complex vitamin K-

Discovery of Vkorc1 haplotypes
Forty mouse priority strains were obtained (the DNA
resource at the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine)
[c.f. Additional file 1]. Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR)
were used to amplify the entire Vkorc1 gene and its 5'
region (Figure 1a). PCR was performed with GoTaq®DNA
polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) in 1× buffer contain-

ing 1.5 mM Mgcl2. PCR thermocycling conditions were as
follows: 2 minutes at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30
seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 55°C, 1 minute at 72°C,
and a final 5 minutes at 72°C. Products were cleaned
using ExoSAP-IT (USB, Cleveland, OH), and sequenced in
both directions on ABI Prism™ 3730xl DNA sequencers
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Sequences were assembled, proofread and aligned to the
published sequence of the Vkorc1 of the mouse (C57BL/
6J) using LASERGENE 7.2 [14]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) were
identified and verified by eye. Haplotypes were inferred
by using ARLEQUIN 3.11 [15].
Phylogenetic analysis of the Vkorc1 haplotypes
Subspecies of the mouse may differ in their phenotypes
merely as a function of the genetic differences accrued
across the genome during independent evolution. Thus it
is important to limit direct tests for association of Vkorc1
haplotypes with phenotypic traits to groups of closely
related strains, or clades, of the same subspecies of Mus.
We used phylogenetic methods (ignoring recombination)
to identify such clades based on the identified Vkorc1 haplotypes.

Specifically, we studied five subspecies of Mus represented
by 31 inbred- and 9 wild-derived strains [see Additional
file 1]. M. m. domesticus is the commonly used laboratory
mouse. M. m. musculus, M. m. spretus, M. m. castaneus and
M. m. molossinus are subspecies of Mus that have contributed to varying degrees to the gene pool of some M. m.
domesticus strains. To reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between strains neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) trees were built using the option
of complete deletion and 1,000 bootstrap replicates as
implemented in MEGA 4.0 [16]. Genetic distances underlying the NJ method were corrected by the Kimura 2parameter model [17]. M. m. spretus (SPRET/EiJ) was used
to root the tree [18,19].
In silico association analyses based on the Mouse
Phenome Database (MPD)
Phenotypic measurements PT [20], BMD [21] and BMC
[21] for each strain were retrieved from the MPD [22]. The
strain PWD/PhJ was excluded for lack of data. STATISTICA
8.0 [23] was used to identify clusters of strains based on
each phenotypic measurement (transformed to the cityblock/Manhattan linkage distance) by applying the
unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means
(UPGMA). We tested for the association of Vkorc1 haplotypes with each phenotypic measurement within and
between clades (as defined by phylogenetic analysis)
using Mann-Whitney U tests.

Results and discussion
Vkorc1 genetic polymorphisms in mouse priority strains
We identified 10 haplotypes that were defined by 84 SNPs
and 153 indels [see Additional file 1]. Six haplotypes were
identified when the coding region was considered (Figure
1b). Five non-synonymous SNPs altering five amino acids
(R12W, A21T, A26S, A48T and R61L) and four synonymous SNPs were identified (Figure 1b). The C132C polymorphism unique to M. m. musculus mapped onto the
evolutionary conserved redox center C132-X-X-C135
motif of the Vkorc1 [24,25].

Consideration of SNPs and indels in the 5' region
increased the number of haplotypes to nine (Figure 1b),
and inclusion of intronic polymorphisms increased the
number of haplotypes to ten. All M. m. domesticus strains
were identical in the coding region but genetic polymorphisms in the 5' region separated M. m. domesticus into
two groups (Figure 1b). However, our comprehensive survey uncovered only two previously known Vkorc1 haplotypes (1 and 7) and two novel haplotypes (2 and 8) in M.
m. domesticus. Considering the coding and 5' regions, only
synonymous SNPs and 5' polymorphisms distinguished
M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus. A single non-synonymous SNP distinguished M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus from M. m. molossiunus and M. m. castaneus. Four
non-synonymous SNPs and at least eight 5' variants were
unique to M. m. spretus.
Phylogenetic analysis of Vkorc1 haplotypes
The analysis of Vkorc1 haplotypes using the NJ method
resulted in four main clades that were supported by bootstrap values of 93% or higher (Figure 2a). All 30 inbred
strains and one wild-derived M. m. domesticus strain fell
into clade I. One inbred and one wild-derived M. m.
domesticus strain together formed clade II. Wild-derived M.
m. musculus strains formed clade III and wild-derived M.
m. molossinus and M. m. castaneus strains formed clade IV.
The overall topology of the Vkorc1 haplotype tree is consistent with those obtained during previous phylogenetic
studies of mice [19,26]. It was also supported by bootstrap
values of 89% or higher when MP was used to analyze the
Vkorc1 haplotype data.
Relationship between Vkorc1 polymorphisms and
prothrombin time
Variation in PT within and between clades I-IV was substantial. However, variation in PT within M. m. domesticus
(clades I and II) overlapped with PT variation in the other
subspecies (Figure 2b). In particular, the mean (and
standard deviation) of PT was 10.318 (0.514) for clade I,
10.772 (0.857) for clade II, and 10.345 (0.541) for clades
(I + II) (i.e. within M. m. domesticus). The corresponding
values for clades III and IV, respectively, were 10.850
(0.451) and 11.075 (0.729).

The mean and standard variation of the phenotypes PT and BMD/C. The clades I-IV are shown on the X-axes and their corresponding PT, BMD and BMC measurements are shown on the Y-axes.

None of the clusters identified based on PT values for each
strain was comprised out of groups of related Vkorc1 haplotypes as defined by the phylogenetic analysis [see Additional file 2]. Most notably, haplotype 1 was observed in
conjunction with the entire range of PT values present in
the data, and it clustered with a wide range of genetically
different haplotypes from various distinct clades. For
example, the strains CBA/J (haplotype 1) and JF1/Ms
(haplotype 5), which differ by 5' polymorphisms as well
as one non-synonymous and two synonymous polymorphisms, clustered together based on their PT values (Figure 1b). Similarly, A/J (haplotype 1) and PWK/PhJ
(haplotype 9), which differ in at least 10 polymorphisms
in the 5' region and 3 synonymous SNPs, clustered
together.
Statistical analysis confirmed this suggested lack of association between PT and Vkorc1 haplotypes within each of
the clades I-IV (Mann-Whitney U tests, all N.S. at α =
0.05). Moreover, no significant association was found
between haplotypes identified in M. m. domesticus and PT
(clades I vs. II) (P = 0.389), suggesting 5' polymorphisms
have little if any effect. Even clades differing by a non-synonymous SNP (A21T) as well as 5' polymorphisms did
not significantly differ in PT (clades III vs. IV) (P = 0.733).
Thus, association between the vitamin K-dependent phenotype PT and haplotype variation of the Vkorc1 was not
statistically supported within subspecies and between sister clades of subspecies as defined by the Vkorc1 haplotype
tree.

However, the genetic distance between Vkorc1 haplotypes
accrued between more divergent subspecies was correlated with differences in PT (clades I vs. III; P = 0.022) and
(clades I vs. IV; P = 0.006). However, given the large
number of mutations across the genome separating these
clades, this association is, in our view, not an indication
of an association between Vkorc1 haplotypes and variation in PT between clades.
Relationship between Vkorc1 polymorphisms and bone
mineralization
Similar to the results for PT variation in BMD within and
between clades I-IV was substantial (Figure 2b), with the
entire range of variation present in M. m. domesticus
(clades 1+II). In particular, the mean (and standard deviation) of BMD was 0.055 (0.005) for clade I, 0.053
(0.005) for clade II, and 0.054 (0.005) for clades (I + II)
(i.e. within M. m. domesticus). The corresponding values
for clades III and IV, respectively, were 0.046 (0.001) and
0.046 (0.002). A similar pattern was observed for BMC
(Figure 2b).

Analysis of BMD and BMC values resulted in two major
clusters [c.f. Additional file 2]. One major cluster was
comprised out of the M. m. domesticus haplotypes 1, 2,
and 7. The other major cluster included a wide range of
genetically different haplotypes from all subspecies of
Mus, suggesting that there is no clear association of Vkorc1
haplotypes with BMD and BMC values. For instance, haplotype 1, which was found in conjunction with the entire

BMC Research Notes 2008, 1:125

range of BMD and BMC values, also clustered together
with SPRET/EiJ (haplotype 10) based on BMD. However,
these two haplotypes differ by as many as 4 non-synonymous SNPs and 21 polymorphisms in the 5' region (Figure 1b).
Statistical analysis confirmed this suggested lack of association between BMD and BMC and Vkorc1 haplotypes
within each of the clades I-IV (Mann-Whitney U tests, all
N.S. at α = 0.05). Moreover, no significant association was
found between haplotypes identified in M. m. domesticus
and BMD and BMC (clade I vs. II) (P = 0.510 for BMD and
P = 0.582 for BMC) suggesting 5' polymorphisms have little if any effect on the phenotypes. Even clades differing
by a non-synonymous SNP (A21T) as well as 5' polymorphisms did not significantly differ in BMD and BMC
(clade III vs. IV) (P = 0.671 for BMD and P = 0.497 for
BMC). Thus, within subspecies or between closely related
subspecies no association between the vitamin K dependent phenotypes BMD and BMC and haplotype variation
of the Vkorc1 was found.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/125

Overall, phenotypic variation in PT, BMD and BMC in M.
m. domesticus, which is substantial, appears to be dominated by genetic variation in genes other than the Vkorc1.
Phenotypic differences between subspecies should be
interpreted as a byproduct of genome wide divergence.
We suggest that it would be of interest to measure differences in warfarin tolerance between mouse priority
strains, particular, between strains belonging to clades I
and II, because warfarin tolerance in humans and warfarin
resistance in rodents had been attributed to Vkorc1 haplotype variation. In addition, MGP is a vitamin K-dependent
protein that is a potent inhibitor of the calcification of the
cardiovascular system. Thus, it would be of interest to
examine the degree to which the calcification of the cardiovascular system is associated with Vkorc1 haplotypes in
mouse priority strains belonging to clades I and II. However, in the current panel of the common laboratory
mouse priority strains of M. m. domesticus most variation
in potentially vitamin K-dependent phenotypes appears
to be due to variation in genes other than the Vkorc1.

Competing interests
However, when genetically more divergent clades were
compared an association of Vkorc1 haplotypes with BMD
and BMC was observed (clade I vs. III; P < 0.001 for BMD
and P = 0.001 for BMC and clade I vs. IV; P < 0.001 for
BMD and P = 0.001 for BMC). However, as discussed
above for PT, this association should not be interpreted as
direct evidence for the role of the Vkorc1 in determining
BMD and BMC.

The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Conclusion
The comprehensive SNP survey covering the Vkorc1 and
its 5' flanking region of 40 mouse priority strains should
be a valuable resource for future tests of an association
between vitamin K-dependent phenotypes and Vkorc1
haplotypes. For example, the absence of Vkorc1 haplotype
variation in M. m. domesticus in clade I enables a rapid
assessment of the role of the Vkorc1 underlying variation
in a phenotype. However, in this study, variation of PT,
BMD and BMC could not be explained by Vkorc1 haplotype, as evidenced in particular by the range of phenotypic
variation seen in conjunction with M. m. domesticus haplotype 1.
Contrasts between M. m. domesticus strains of clade I and
II may be informative with regard the role of polymorphisms in the 5' region of the Vkorc1. In our study of PT,
BMD and BMC, however, this 5' sequence variation of the
Vkorc1 did not significantly explain the variation in these
phenotypes. We note that only two strains currently
belong to clade II, which precluded more powerful statistical tests for association. Additional strains belonging to
this clade should be identified.
