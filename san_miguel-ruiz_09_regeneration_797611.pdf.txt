Abstract
Background: Regeneration of neurons and fibers in the mammalian spinal cord has not been
plausible, even though extensive studies have been made to understand the restrictive factors
involved. New experimental models and strategies are necessary to determine how new nerve cells
are generated and how fibers regrow and connect with their targets in adult animals. Nonvertebrate deuterostomes might provide some answers to these questions. Echinoderms, with
their amazing regenerative capacities could serve as model systems; however, very few studies have
been done to study the regeneration of their nervous system.
Results: We have studied nerve cord regeneration in the echinoderm Holothuria glaberrima. These
are sea cucumbers or holothurians members of the class Holothuroidea. One radial nerve cord,
part of the echinoderm CNS, was completely transected using a scalpel blade. Animals were
allowed to heal for up to four weeks (2, 6, 12, 20, and 28 days post-injury) before sacrificed. Tissues
were sectioned in a cryostat and changes in the radial nerve cord were analyzed using classical dyes
and immmuohistochemistry. In addition, the temporal and spatial distribution of cell proliferation
and apoptosis was assayed using BrdU incorporation and the TUNEL assay, respectively.
We found that H. glaberrima can regenerate its radial nerve cord within a month following
transection. The regenerated cord looks amazingly similar in overall morphology and cellular
composition to the uninjured cord. The cellular events associated to radial cord regeneration
include: (1) outgrowth of nerve fibers from the injured radial cord stumps, (2) intense cellular
division in the cord stumps and in the regenerating radial nerve cords, (3) high levels of apoptosis
in the RNC adjacent to the injury and within the regenerating cord and (4) an increase in the
number of spherule-containing cells. These events are similar to those that occur in other body
wall tissues during wound healing and during regeneration of the intestine.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that holothurians are capable of rapid and complete regeneration
of the main component of their CNS. Regeneration involves both the outgrowth of nerve fibers
and the formation of neurons. Moreover, the cellular events employed during regeneration are
similar to those involved in other regenerative processes, namely wound healing and intestinal
regeneration. Thus, holothurians should be viewed as an alternative model where many of the
questions regarding nervous system regeneration in deuterostomes could be answered.

Background
Post-traumatic nervous regeneration is a rarely seen phenomenon in the central nervous system (CNS) of adult
higher vertebrate animals. Organisms with CNS injuries
can suffer the loss of motor activity and sensory perception and, as a result, develop limitations or disabilities.
Some animal species, on the other hand, are capable of
functional regeneration after an injury to their CNS. In
these cases, severed neuronal fibers can find their targets
through axonal path finding and neurogenesis can be activated. Efforts in different fields have generated a large
amount of information as to what directs or limits the
potential of neuronal cells to achieve proper functional
regeneration. However, continued research and new
approaches are still needed before we fully understand
what governs the dynamics of injured nervous tissues and
its regeneration.
One of the approaches that have been used to study nerve
regeneration is the comparative analysis to determine the
differences between those species that readily regenerate
their CNS and those where regeneration is more limited
[1-4]. The regeneration capabilities of the CNS have been
said to decrease as we move higher in the phylogenetic
tree [4,5]. Thus, relatively simple organisms such as Hydra
and Planaria, can regenerate their neuronal network after
amputation of a body part [6]. Similarly, studies with
mollusks and annelids (including leeches) have shown
that they are capable of regeneration after a crush-type
injury to one of the CNS tracts [5]. However, the assumption that organisms in the lower phylogenetic scale are
more able to regenerate their nervous system is not always
true. This is highlighted by the fact that crustaceans, as
well as two of the most studied invertebrate model animals, C. elegans and Drosophila, show limited CNS regeneration [5,7,8].
Among deuterosotomes, most of the studies on CNS
regeneration have been done on the spinal cord of vertebrates. Here again, organisms can be grouped into good
regenerators and poor regenerators. Among the former are
lampreys, fishes, and urodele amphibians, the latter
include most amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals
[4,9-11]. Some fish species have served as models to study
axonal regeneration in the CNS of vertebrates, as these
animals are capable of functional regeneration after a CNS
injury [2,11,12]. Urodeles are among the most gifted to
regenerate their CNS; following an injury they can regenerate a spinal cord with some functional recovery at any
recovery time during their life cycle [3,13,14]. Other
amphibians are also capable of regrowing spinal nerves
after amputation of the tail, but only in an immature state
[15,16]. Even though these models have provided
detailed descriptions of the problems and limitations that
neuronal tissues must overcome before functional regen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/3

eration, still a great deal of basic knowledge is missing to
understand how this phenomenon could be regulated
and neuronal regeneration enhanced.
CNS regeneration has been little studied in lower deuterostomes. In ascidians, the regeneration of the neural complex has been shown to occur after complete ablation
[17,18], but no study of nerve transection or partial injury
is available. There is no information on CNS regeneration
in hemichordates or cephalochordates. In echinoderms,
organisms with an amazing regenerative capacity, a few
publications provide some information on CNS regeneration, mainly describing what occurs following arm amputation in asteroids and crinoids [19-22]. However, these
experiments provide a brief description of nerve regeneration that is part of an overall description of how the new
arm forms or focus on some specific processes such as cell
proliferation during regeneration. Only recently has a
study on CNS regeneration in echinoderms been done,
but it is limited to transmission electron microscopy [23].
Our work confirms some of their findings and greatly
expands the analysis of CNS regeneration in echinoderms.
In this study we use the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima to study nervous system regeneration. H. glaberrima,
is an echinoderm of the class Holothuroidea, and as such,
is an invertebrate deuterostome, placing this organism in
close evolutionary relationship with vertebrates. Moreover, these organisms have been known for a long time to
possess tremendous capabilities to functionally regenerate most of their organs and tissues in a very short time
[24,25]. We have previously used this model system to
study intestinal regeneration [26], the regeneration of the
enteric nervous system [27] and the wound healing of the
body wall [28].
The holothurian CNS main component is an anterior
nerve ring, at the base of the tentacles, from which 5 radial
nerve cords (RNCs) exit and travel within the bodywall,
spanning the length of the animal and ending blindly at
the posterior end [24,29,30]. RNCs are subdivided into
two components, the ectoneural (EN) or hyponeural
(HN) band which are separated by a band of connective
tissue (see Fig. 1A). In general terms the HN component is
thought to be primarily motor, while the EN has both sensory and motor functions. RNCs are ganglionated nerves,
meaning that they have neurons throughout their length.
The neurons can be found in the periphery of both HN
and EN components with the central portion, or neuropile, made up of nerve fibers. Innervation of organs occurs
by peripheral nerves that emerge from the RNCs. We have
developed a technique that allows for an accurate injury
to be made to the RNC and are now able to study the
regenerative potential of the holothurian CNS. We report
here that following transection, re-construction of the

(A) uninjured and regenerating RNC at (B) 2, (C) 6, (D) 12, (E) 20 and (F) 28 days post injury (dpi) were stained with Toluidene
Blue. (A) The uninjured RNC clearly shows the large ectoneural (EN) component separated from the thinner hyponeural (HN)

(arrowhead). (C) By 6 dpi, the RNC stumps have organized into club-shaped structures. (D) By 12 dpi the injury gap has been
filled with nervous tissue that now forms a continuous extension that joins the stumps. (E) By 20 dpi the RNC still appears
slightly disorganized and no connective tissue band is observed. (F) At 28 dpi, the RNC has recovered much of the structure

nerve stumps occurs by 12 dpi, as a result of axonal
growth; afterwards the RNC goes through a remodeling
phase to achieve its original morphology. Other events
associated with tissue development and regeneration were
also observed, including cell division, migration and
apoptosis. With this work we set the foundations for further studies on nervous regeneration by showing that this
animal model carries out the two most important processes for CNS regeneration, explicitly neurogenesis and
axonal pathfinding. More importantly, these occur as a
natural response to the injury, allowing for future characterization of a permissive environment for possible therapy-related studies.

Methods
Animals
Holothuria glaberrima specimens, 10–16 cm long, were collected from the northeastern rocky shores of Puerto Rico
and kept in an aquarium at 22–24°C with circulating seawater and constant oxygenation. All experiments conform

to the regulations on animal research at the University of
Puerto Rico.
Surgical procedures
The technique used to injure the RNC has been described
elsewhere [28]. Briefly, evisceration was induced by intracoelomic injection of 0.35 M KCl (3–5 ml). One hour following evisceration, animals were anesthetized by placing
them for 10 min in 0.1% 1,1,1-Trichloro-2-methyl-2-propanol hydrate (chlorobutanol) diluted in seawater. Severing of the RNC was done by pushing the dorsal bodywall
through the cloaca with a blunt rod, thus exposing the
coelomic surface of the bodywall. A transection-type
injury was made perpendicularly to the nerve using a scalpel, after which animals were reverted to their normal orientation and returned to their aquarium. By transecting
the radial nerve from the inside we could obtain a reliable
injury to the RNC with minimal damage to the surrounding tissues. Control animals were taken through the same
protocol, except that no transection was made.

Tissue harvesting and Histology
During the regeneration period, animals were sacrificed at
different days post-injury (2, 6, 12, 20, and 28 dpi). Animals were anesthetized with chlorobutanol as before, slit
open and pinned to a dissecting tray. Initially, they were
directly fixed within the tray with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 30 min and then the nerve-muscle complex, along
with the bodywall, was excised. The tissue block was
refixed overnight, washed in PBS and left in 30% sucrose
until used.

Tissue blocks were embedded in OCT (Tissue Tek OCT;
Miles Inc.), frozen at -35°C and longitudinally sectioned
(20 μm) in a cryostat (Leica CM 1900). Sections were
mounted on poly-L-lysine coated slides, left to dry for 1 hr
at room temperature and stored in a dry chamber until
needed. Since the RNCs are localized within the body
wall, the tissue sections contained the regenerating RNC,
the proximal regions that were 0.5 mm from the injury
site, and the distal regions that were approximately 5 mm
away.
Histological analyses
Chemical Dyes – Toluidine blue
To obtain a comprehensive view of the temporal modifications that the RNCs go through after an injury, longitudinal tissue sections were stained with toluidine blue, as
described by Presnell and Schreibman [31]. In brief, sections were rinsed in PBS for 2 min, and then immersed in
dye solution for 2 min. They were then rinsed with tap
water, mounted in PBS-buffered glycerol and viewed
under the microscope. Occasionally, staining was also
done on tissue sections previously processed for immunohistochemistry (see below).
Morphometric analysis
To evaluate changes in the RNCs following injury, tissue
sections stained with toluidine blue were studied under
light microscopy and the shortest distance between nerve
stumps of injured animals was recorded. At least ten tissue
sections were measured per animal and three to five animals were used for each stage. Sections were examined
and photographed using a Nikon E600 microscope.
Images were collected digitally with an RT Color Spot
camera (Diagnostic Inst. Inc.) with 1520 × 1080 pixel resolution, and analyzed using the MetaVue software (version 6.0; Universal Imaging, Inc.) and Image J (version
1.37;NIH, USA).
Immunohistochemistry
Protocols for the immunohistochemical procedures performed for this study have been described elsewhere [28].
Tissue sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X100 in PBS, blocked with goat serum (1:50), and incubated at room temp overnight with the corresponding pri-

mary antibody: α-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 1:5,
Amersham), Sph2 supernatant [32], α-GFSKLYFamide (αGFS, 1:1000, [33]), α-Galanin (1:500, [34]), α-Nurr1
(1:1000, Sigma) or RN1 (1:50,000, [35]) in a humid
chamber. The following day, sections were rinsed in PBS
and treated with the FITC-labeled goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:50, BioSource Int.). When double
labeling was performed, the Cy3-labeled goat-anti-rabbit
antibody (1:2,000) was used along with the FITC labeled
antibody. Sections were rinsed again in PBS and mounted
in buffered glycerol. Double or triple labeling with
Hoechst nuclear dye (Sigma) was done by immersing
slides in 1 μM Hoescht for 15 min after the secondary
antibody [28]. Sections were examined and photographed
using the Nikon E600 microscope equipped with FITC, R/
DII and DAPI filters. Images were recorded using the
MetaVue software as mentioned previously.
Cell counts
Various cellular populations were labeled and quantified.
These include (1) the overall number of cells within the
RNC using Hoescht nuclear dye, (2) spherulocytes, cells
that contained a large number of spherules within their
cytoplasm and were labeled with monoclonal antibody
Sph2, (see [32]), (3) morulas, cells that also contain vesicles or spherules and that are strongly stained with Toluidine blue (see [32]), (4) neuropeptide-containing
neurons labeled with anti-GFS and (5) a neuronal population labeled with an antibody against the transcription
factor NURR1. The number of cells was quantified by
counting labeled cells in a 280 mm2 area of the longitudinal RNC (this is the equivalent of the microscope field of
view-FOW using the 40× objective). In order to be
counted, cells had to be within the nerve or in close apposition with the somas in the nerve periphery, or with the
fibers that had exited the nerve stumps. Cell counts were
done in two fields of view chosen at random for each corresponding area in every animal and in at least five animals per regeneration stage.
TUNEL assay
The TUNEL method was used to label apoptotic cells
within the RNC. For this purpose we used the TdT-FragEl
DNA Fragmentation Detection kit (Calbiochem QIA33)
and followed the manufacturer specifications with only
minor modifications. Tissue sections were washed for 3
min in PBS to remove the embedding medium; afterwards
they were refixed in 4% formaldehyde (diluted in 1× PBS)
and washed in TBS for 15 min. Tissue sections were permeabilized with 50 μl proteinase K (5 μg/ml) for 15 min
and then washed in TBS. Prior to labeling apoptotic cells,
tissue sections were bathed with 1× TdT Equilibration
Buffer (80 μl per section) for 30 min. For the labeling reaction, 60 μl of the mixture (57 μl Labeling Reaction Mix: 3
μl TdT enzyme) were applied to each section and incu-

bated for 1 hr at room temperature. Slides were then
washed 2× for 2 min in TBS, counterstained with the
nuclear dye Hoescht for 10 min, washed for 5 min in TBS,
and mounted with phosphate buffered glycerol.
Proliferation Assays
Pulse-chase experiments
Incorporation of BrdU into cell nuclei was used to study
the spatio-temporal distribution of proliferating cells in
regenerating animals. Animals were injected intracoelomically at 2, 6, 12, 20 and 28 dpi with 100 μl of a 1 mg/
ml BrdU solution (approximately 0.01 mg/g wet weight)
and sacrificed 24 hrs after. Tissues were fixed and treated
as described above for immunohistochemistry. Cells
undergoing replication were identified with an antibody
against BrdU (Amersham). Prior to the incubation with
the antibody, tissue sections were bathed with 0.05 N HCl
for 1 h. This was done to improve the accessibility of the
antibody to the BrdU epitope, followed by an additional
15 min PBS wash. Cell division index was obtained by
dividing the number of BrdU-positive cells against the
total number of Hoescht-labeled nuclei within a longitudinal section of the RNC in the microscope field of view.
At least two measurements of corresponding areas chosen
at random from each of at least five different animals were
used for each stage.
Cellular birth-dating
To determine if dividing cells were giving rise to the neurons in the regenerating RNC, we injected animals with
BrdU every other day for a period of 6 days (4 BrdU injections per animal in each group). There were a total of 6
groups: 0–6, 8–14, 16–22, 24–30, 32–38, and 40–46 dpi;
all animals were sacrificed at 62 dpi. The rationale behind
the multiple and consecutive doses of BrdU stems from
the assumption that new neurons do not differentiate
immediately after the division, but that a dividing neuronal precursor will not necessarily express the neuronal
markers after the last division. Multiple injections were
thought to be necessary to assure that at least some cells
were caught at the time of division. Sections of RNCs from
the various groups were double labeled against BrdU and
markers for different subpopulations (GFS, Galanin,
Nurr1) to establish the date of birth of the neurons that
were repopulating the new RNC tissue.
Statistical Analyses
Student's t test and ANOVA's were used for statistical analyses. P values of < 0.05 were deemed to be significant.

Results
Overview of nerve regeneration
To assess the morphological changes that the RNC underwent during the regeneration period, longitudinal sections of body wall were stained with Toluidine blue and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/3

studied under light microscopy (Fig. 1). The first stage (2
dpi) was characterized by an injured RNC with fanshaped stumps (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, the pre-existing CT
band in the stumps were practically unaffected; if anything, it lost a bit of cohesiveness at its most proximal end,
adjacent to the injury. By 6 dpi, small bundles of fibers
had extended from both nerve stumps, giving the structure an overall needle-like shape laying on the substratum
provided by the body wall and pointing towards the
opposing stump (Fig. 1C). At this stage, the origin of nerve
bundles extending beyond the stump seemed to be,
mostly, the result of an outgrowth in the nerve EN component, which lies closer to the body wall. Still, the lack of
a substratum in the injury gap appeared to be the main
limitation for scouting bundles. Support for this comes
from observations of fiber bundles, which in the absence
of a direct intervening matrix between the stumps, were
found close to the trough of the injury gap. Nerve re-contact occurred by 12 dpi, concurrent with the appearance of
a provisional matrix that filled the injury gap (Fig. 1D).
The regenerated RNC spanned the injury gap but
remained disorganized with empty spaces that could be
seen. This was clearly observed by using the differential
interference contrast (DIC) filter in the microscope.
Although the nerve had reconnected by 12 dpi, the CT
band that normally separates the HN and EN was not
present. The RNC structure was much improved by 20 dpi
(Fig. 1E). At this stage the number and localization of
nuclei, both in the HN and EN, was similar to that of an
uninjured nerve. The CT band separating the HN and EN
was already perceptible at this stage in some, but not all
animals, as traces of thin filaments along the length of the
nerve. Approximately one month after the injury (28 dpi),
the regenerated nerve had a normal architecture (Fig. 1F).
The nuclear arrangement and density of fibers was now
similar to that of a normal uninjured nerve and the CT
band was already present and compact, although in some
areas it still seemed diffuse.
Regeneration of fiber subpopulations
To obtain an in-depth view of the events that occur in the
regenerating RNC, we studied the responses of different
fiber subpopulations to the injury. Using immunohistochemistry we were able to correlate the gross appearance
of the RNC, studied in light microscopy, with the growth
of particular fiber populations across the injury site of the
regenerated RNC.
RN1
This is a monoclonal antibody raised in our lab against H.
glaberrima RNC tissue [35] that provides very specific labeling of what appears to be a large fiber population of the
holothurian nervous system (Fig. 2A). RN1 does not label
the CT band that separates the HN and EN component,
thus, this band could be detected as a non-labeled distinct

nerve cords at (B) 2, (C) 6, (D) 12, (E) 20 and (F) 28 days post injury (dpi) were labeled with the monoclonal antibody RN1. (A)
Labeling in the uninjured RNC is highly specific to the nervous components, both ectoneural (EN) and hyponeural (HN) component while the connective tissue band remains unlabeled (arrowhead). (B) At 2 dpi nerve fiber debris is visible around the

RNC has recovered much of the structure and organization found within non-injured RNC including the connective tissue that

strip of tissue embedded within the high density of RN1
immunoreactive fibers. As a result, this antibody served as
a two-edged marker, to measure progress during the process of nerve regeneration, namely the tracking of fibers as
they elongate, and the appearance of the CT band as evidence of tissue organization into HN and EN components.

Most of the data collected with this antibody confirm the
observations made using the Toluidene blue dye; however, some interesting differences were found. The fanshaped morphology of the nerve stumps at the injury site
observed at 2 dpi was mostly the result of a swelling
(enlargement) in the EN component, while the HN component was not severely affected (Fig. 2B). At this stage,

Page 6 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Developmental Biology 2009, 9:3

the HN component proximal to the injury appeared to
retract in relation to the EN. At 6 dpi, the stumps acquired
a club-shaped appearance and RN1-labeled fiber bundles
could be observed protruding toward the opposite stump
(Fig. 2C). Unfortunately, because of the high density of
labeling, individual nerve fibers inside these pioneering
bundles were hard to identify. However, the RN1 fiber
bundles were always observed to be in direct contact with
the substratum of the body wall and continuous with the
injured stump. At this stage we observed the first difference in the rate of regeneration between the EN and HN
components; the EN component provided the first scouting bundles that traverse the substratum towards the
injury site, while RN1-labeled fibers of the HN appeared
to be in a latent state. At 12 dpi, RN1 fibers from opposing
nerve stumps came together, forming the newly regenerated RNC (Fig. 2D). At this stage, although RN1 fibers
filled the area between the stumps, the separation of the
RNC into its respective components had not occurred yet.
During this stage RN1 labeled side branches could be
observed originating from the same nerve bundles that
form the connection between the stumps. These branches
might be some that had gone astray into other injured tissues or they might be precursors to peripheral nerves. By
20 dpi the new RNC showed the first hint of connective
tissue separation between the HN and EN components,
albeit, rudimentary and irregular at times (Fig. 2E). The
EN component was now structurally comparable to that
of an uninjured RNC, as its wandering bundles of fibers
were no longer present or at least apparent. Additionally,
the regenerated RNC had a more cylindrical shape in
accordance with the rest of the nerve; nonetheless, the
staining intensity was now less than in uninjured areas. In
spite of all these improvements in the EN component, the
HN in most animals was still underdeveloped compared
to uninjured counterparts in the same section. The new
RNC was restored by 28 dpi with an HN and an EN component clearly separated from each other by the CT band
between them (Fig. 2F).
-GFS
α-GFS is a polyclonal antibody made in our lab against
the neuropeptide GFSKLYF-amide that recognizes a subpopulation of neuronal fibers and somas in both HN and
EN components of the RNC of H. glaberrima [33].

At 2 dpi, immunolabeling with GFS clearly showed the
fan-shaped morphology of the cut RNC and the fraying of
the nerve fibers close to the injury (Fig. 3A). The reduction
in fiber density close to the injury was accompanied by an
increase in labeling intensity close to the nerve stumps,
which could be attributed to the appearance of α-GFSlabeled varicosities along the fibers. At 6 dpi, GFS-immunoreactive fibers had sprouted from the nerve stumps and
the overall structure was clearly pointing towards the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/3

opposite stump (Fig. 1B). It is important to note that that
the previously observed varicosities were also present in
these migrating fibers. Similar to what was observed for
RN1, fibers expressing the GFS neuropeptide also reconnected by 12 dpi (Fig. 3C). The labeling with GFS showed
that immunoreactive fibers in the HN followed those of
the EN; instead of using the body wall as a substrate. Even
when the path taken by some fibers might be twisted and
indirect, the overall axis of the fibers inside the regenerated EN was parallel to the long axis of the RNC. By 20 dpi
both components were present in the regenerated RNC.
No major differences were observed a month after transection (28 dpi) between regenerated RNC segment and its
uninjured counterpart (Fig. 3D).
-Galanin
In the RNC this antibody labels a relatively small population of fibers [34]. At 2 dpi, galanin immunoreactive fibers underwent a change in their morphology forming
round varicosities with very intense labeling. This change
was more conspicuous closer to the injury site, where the
nerve fibers have became frayed; they were present in the
HN and EN component of the RNC. At 6 dpi, varicosities
were also found in the needle-shaped bundle of fibers
exiting the nerve stump (Fig. 4A). Once the RNC reconnected at 12 dpi, the area of the injury could be easily
identified by the presence of these large varicosities. At 20
dpi, galanin-positive fibers were present in both components of the RNC, although with a higher density in the
EN (Fig. 4B). Galanin-positive fibers passing between
these two components were also apparent at multiple
points along the regenerated RNC, as is usual in an uninjured nerve. At 28 dpi, the large varicosities had disappeared and α-galanin produced a labeling that was
virtually undistinguishable from that of a normal RNC.

In summary, all neuronal markers used showed that the
injury gap that separates the two RNC stumps is slowly
filled by a growth of fibers that originate from the stump
ends in the first two weeks of regeneration (Fig. 4C). This
process is complete by 20 dpi and a RNC with high similarity to the uninjured RNC is in place by 28 dpi.
Cell division
Pulse chase
RNCs are ganglionated nerves where the neuronal soma
and supporting cells can be mainly found in the periphery. To study the possibility that cell division is occurring
in the RNC as a result of the injury, animals were injected
with the thymidine analog, BrdU, and then checked for its
incorporation into the nuclei. Initially, at 2 dpi few cells
within the proximal stumps, both in the HN and EC
bands, of the injured nerves were undergoing cell division; no cell division was seen distal to the injury site (Fig.
5). At 6 dpi, the highest numbers of dividing cells were

were injected with BrdU 24 hrs prior to sacrifice. (B) GFS expressing fibers can be seen to elongate out of the nerve stump by

seen in the proximal region, with about 6% of cells (6.81
± 0.42 in HN and 5.36 ± 0.4 in EN) undergoing cell division. Cell division distal to the injury site never exceeded
2%. By 12 dpi, cell division in the proximal stumps
remained comparatively similar (6.54 ± 0.23 in HN and
383 ± 0.21 in EN) to the previous stage. However, an
impressive surge in cell division occurred in the regenerating RNC that is forming across the injury site, where close
to 20% of the cells (22.2 ± 1.06 in HN and 14.9 ± 1.15 in
EN) were undergoing cell division. Subsequently, at 20
dpi, a sharp drop in cell division was observed in the
newly formed RNC. Proximal to the injured nerve, cell

division did not exceed 2%. At the last stage studied (28
dpi), cell division was mainly restricted to the HN of the
regenerated RNC, where cell division was 3.28 ± 0.7% in
HN and 1.26 ± 0.3 in EN, everywhere else, cell division
was less than 1%.
Cell regeneration and birth dating
The next step was to determine whether the neurons in the
regenerated RNC were originating from dividing precursors. For this we used two neuronal markers that label
independent neuronal populations in the RNC, anti-GFS
[33] and anti-Nurr1 (unp. obs.). These markers labeled

done at the injury site and compared with sites proximal and distal to the injury. Animals were injected with BrdU 24 hrs
before sacrificed. Quantification of cell division at the injury site shows a peak in cell proliferation at 12 dpi both in the hyponeural and ectoneural components. A smaller increase in cell division is also observed in the nerve stumps proximal to the injury
site, but not so distal to the injury. Regenerated tissues in the injured area do not appear until 12-dpe. Each point represents

neuronal cell bodies in both the EN and HN components
of the RNC (Fig. 6A &6B). Initially, experiments were
made by injecting animals with BrdU at different time
periods and sacrificing animals at 30 dpi. However, these
animals showed few if any GFS or Nurr1 neurons in their
regenerated RNC. Thus, we decided to extend the experiment until day 62 dpi. For this, animals were separated
into 6 groups and each group received BrdU injections
during a particular 6-day period. All animals were sacrificed at 62 dpi. The rationale for this experiment was that
only those cells that stop proliferation close to the last
BrdU injections would retain the BrdU label until 62 dpi.
Cells that kept proliferating would dilute out the BrdU
and not be labeled. Thus, we would expect that dividing
neuroblasts would stop dividing and then differentiate, so
that most of the labeled cells that had stopped dividing
within the RNC would be neurons.
Sections of the regenerated RNC were obtained and the
cells in an area of equivalent length of RNC were determined on the microscope field of view (40×) were
counted at 62 dpi. Results showed that the total number
of cells (as measured by counting Hoescht-labeled nuclei)
within the regenerated RNC did not differ from that in the
proximal and distal RNC, suggesting that cell regeneration
had occurred after 2 months (Fig. 6C). At this time, neurons expressing GFS or Nurr1 were also found within the
regenerated RNC, albeit, in smaller numbers when com-

pared to those within the proximal and distal RNC (Fig.
6D &6E)
Birthdating studies showed a peak during the second and
third week of regeneration (groups 2 & 3, 8–22 dpi) when
close to 3% of the cells (group 2 – 3.16 ± 0.54%, group 3
– 2.81 ± 0.59%) stopped dividing, and were still BrdU
labeled at 62 dpi (Fig. 7A &7B). This would suggest that it
is during this time period that most neurons have stopped
dividing and started differentiation. To further verify that
some of the dividing cells were neurons, we used double
labeling with the neuronal markers GFS and NURR1. The
results were somewhat unexpected. None of the cells that
expressed GFS were double labeled with BrdU in any of
the injected groups, even when over 300 GFS neurons
were observed. In contrast, some cells labeled with Nurr1
were also labeled with BrdU (Fig. 7C). These cells were
present only in the HN component of animals injected
with BrdU during 8–22 dpi (which corresponds to the
peak in cells that stopped proliferation). However, the
number of neurons is rather small as only 2.5% of all
NURR1 immunoreactive cells present in these groups
were BrdU labeled (Fig. 7D).

ring (Fig. 8). As soon as 2 dpi, apoptotic cells were present
in the HN component of the proximal stumps. The highest number of apoptotic cells in the proximal stumps
occurred at 6 dpi, in both the HN and EC bands, although
the magnitude of apoptotic cells was higher in the HN
band. By 12 dpi and on to 28 dpi, few if any apoptotic
cells were observed in the nerve proximal to the injury
site. In contrast, at 12 dpi, a large wave of apoptosis
occurred in the regenerated RNC that had just formed
over the injury gap. The number of apoptotic cells in the
regenerating RNC dropped in the two subsequent stages,
until at 28 dpi, no apoptosis was observed in the EN and
only in 1% of cells of the HN band.
Spherule-containing cells
Two types of spherule-containing cells have been
described in our system: morulas, which are highly
basophilic and stain dark purple with toluidine blue, and

spherulocytes, which are recognized by a monoclonal
antibody prepared against sea cucumber tissues [28,32].
Only about 5% of spherule-containing cells are recognized by both markers.
Few (less than1 per visual field), if any, morula cells were
found within the normal RNCs (see Fig. 1). (As mentioned earlier, fields of view, FOV, were obtained with the
40× objective and encompassed an equivalent area in all
animals). Changes in their number within the RNC were
already seen at 2 dpi, when they invaded the nerve
stumps. They achieved their highest numbers at this stage,
when the average number of cells per field of view within
the proximal stumps was 6.9 + 0.2 cells per FOV (Fig. 9A,
and see Fig. 1). Most cells were closely apposed to the CT
band that separates the HN and EN components; this is
the same location where they are normally found in an
uninjured nerve. However, as a response to the injury,

morulas were also found interspersed within the neuropile, more commonly where the nerve stumps were
engorged, or fan-shaped. By 6 dpi, the number of cells in
the proximal stump remained the same (6.4 + 0.24 cells
per FOV) as in the previous stage. However, some of these
cells were also associated with the RNC cell bodies, in
both the HN and EN, adjacent to the coelomic side and
also with the regrowing fibers that originated from the
nerve stumps. At 12 dpi the number of morulas in the
proximal RNC decreased to levels just slightly higher (1.6
+ 0.1 cells per FOV) than the basal level and remained at
this level until 28 dpi. The changes in the morula population only occurred proximally to the injury site since distal
to the injury site the cell numbers were not significantly
different from uninjured nerves at any stage studied. The
number of cells was much higher in the new RNC bridg-

ing the injury site at 12 dpi, on average there were 7.12 ±
0.35 cells per FOV. At 20 dpi, the average number of cells
in the regenerated RNC declined to 2.61 ± 0.25 cells per
FOV; similar to the number of cells found at 28 dpi (2.89
± 0.23 cells per FOV)(see Fig. 1).
The number of spherulocytes within the RNCs also underwent changes during regeneration (Fig. 9D). These cells
were not normally found in uninjured nerves, however, as

increase was seen in the RNC stump by 6 dpi, when on
average 3.23 ± 0.34 cells per FOV were observed in the
RNC. By 12 dpi, the number of spherulocytes proximal to
the regenerated RNC decreased, but still remained signifi-

cantly higher than the basal level (see Fig. 9B). This was
accompanied by a relatively high infiltration of these cells
into the new RNC that had on average 4.34 ± 0.51 cells per
FOV. The number of cells seen in the regenerated RNC by
20 dpi decreased to 2.24 ± 0.25 cells per FOV; the range of
cells in proximal and distal parts relative to the injury site
was 1.59 ± 0.17 to 1.34 ± 0.04 per FOV. Distally, the
spherulocyte population remained unchanged from 3 dpi
until 20 dpi at less than 1.4 cells per FOV. At 28 dpi, spherulocytes could only be detected in the regenerated portion
of the RNC (see Fig. 9C), and although their levels were
lower than those of previous stages, they were still significantly higher than in uninjured nerves.

Discussion

In some ways, the formation of the new RNC can be compared to the "new" RNC segments that grow when the tip
of the arm is severed in starfish or crinoids [19,20,22]. In
all these cases the regenerated arm tip eventually grows to
form new segments that include all the components
found in the RNCs. Experimental evidence for the formation of a new RNC also comes from other closely related
deuterostomes, the ascidians, that have an impressive
ability to regenerate main components of their nervous
system as has been shown by Bollner and colleagues
[17,18] in studies where the main neural ganglion regenerates afer ablation. Similarly, lower vertebrates are able to
regenerate a lost segment of the spinal cord as has been
shown by nerve cord injury in amphibians [39,40] and
fish [1].

The regenerated RNC
Our results clearly show that the RNC of holothurians can
regenerate within a month following a transection. The
regenerated RNC looks amazingly similar to the noninjured RNC as judged by several histological and cellular
parameters: It is well organized into ectoneural and
hyponeural components, there is no scar or fibrotic tissue,
the number of cells is similar to those found in uninjured
tissue, neurons are localized to the nerve periphery, and
spherule-containing cells that have infiltrated the injured
cord have all but dissapeared. This is an amazing regeneration feat for an adult deuterostome, particularly if we
consider that the RNC conforms the echinoderm CNS
[24,29,30] and has been proposed to be evolutionary
related to the vertebrate CNS [36-38].

Phylogenetic analysis of regeneration following
transection
How does the regeneration of the holothurian RNC compares to that shown by other animals? To answer this
question we will focus on those experiments where injury
to the CNS is done by transection of the main nerve cord
(or spinal cord). This includes studies in protostomes,
such as mollusks and annelids and lower vertebrates, such
as fish and urodele amphibians. It also includes developing vertebrates, since experiments have shown that spinal
cord regeneration can occur at particular developmental
stages of some higher vertebrates, such as chicks or marsupials, and then becomes restricted as development continues [41,42].

Although we lack direct proof, a large amount of circumstantial evidence suggest that regeneration is not solely the
joining back of the severed nerve stumps but that actually
a new portion of the RNC is generated. First, from the
moment it is cut, the wound forms a V-shaped structure
where the nerve stumps are initially separated by a gap,
and then by connective tissue. Second, most of the ongoing cellular division occurs within the regenerating RNC.
Third, other tissues that surround the nerve and that also
regenerate, do so by forming new tissues. This is particularly true of the surrounding muscle and connective tissues, which regenerate in parallel to the RNC and where
very small differences in organization, cell density and
texture distinguish the "new" tissues from the adjacent
"old" [28]. Fourth, the initial and most visible regeneration event is the outgrowth of fibers from the RNC
stumps. These outgrowths increase with time and eventually completely fill the space between the stumps. The latter retain their original morphology throughout
regeneration, and it is the space in between that grows and
becomes organized. Finally, recent work in another holothurian, Eupentacta fraudatrix, also shows regeneration of
the RNC to be newly formed tissue [23].

RNC regeneration in H. glaberrima shows strong similarities to other animal species known to be capable of axonal
regeneration and/or formation of a missing part of their
CNS. In most species where CNS regeneration takes place,
two events can be highlighed to occur: the outgrowth of
fibers from the nerve stumps and the absence of fibrotic
tissue or glial scar. The growth of fibers into the lessioned
area provides the first indication of the regeneration process. As has been reported by TEM in the sea cucumber E.
fraudatrix [23] and by immunohistochemistry in the starfish, Asterias rubens [22], these fibers originate from the
lesioned stumps and move across the lesion eventually
forming a bridge between the two nerve stumps. Similarly, in urodele larvae, fibers extending from each of the
cut ends grow across the gap and eventually form a bridge
connecting the two nerve ends [39]. New fibers are mainly
attributed to the re-growth of fibers from lesioned cells as
has been shown by retrograde labeling at the time of
transection [43,44]. Another common observation in
regenerating animals, including holothurians, is the fact
that there seems to be a directionality to the process, since
fibers extending from one stump are directed toward the
opposite stump and are rarely observed to be traveling
toward another target, suggesting the participation of sol-

uble factors originating from the severed stumps and/or
guidance molecules in the surrounding environment.

ous system regeneration among animals will be established.

The absence of a glial scar or fibrotic tissue in regenerating
cords is another characteristic of those animals capable of
regenerating their main nervous system. No scar tissue is
detected or described in studies showing regeneration in
urodeles, fish or echinoderms. Similarly, chick embryos
that are capable of regeneration do not form scar tissue
[41]. In fact, what investigators regularly show to occur
during the regenerative response is an increase in cells or
cell activity associated with the removal of the injury
debris and of apoptotic cells.

Role of Cell division and apoptosis
Two related and at the same time, opposite processes are
occuring within the RNC during regeneration; cell proliferation and cell death. The two show a spatial and temporal profile that seems perplexing because they seem to be
occurring simultaneously; both show a peak in the nerve
stumps at 6 dpi and a peak within the regenerating RNC
at 12 dpi.

There are also differences in the regeneration process
among animals. One of these is the level or extent at
which regeneration occurs. In holothurians, the regenerated RNC appears almost indistinct from the non-injured
RNC. However, in other organisms where it has been
studied, the regenerated cord is not fully equivalent to the
normal one in spite of fibers crossing the lesion site. For
example, in the regenerating chick embryo, fibers do cross
the transection site and functional regeneration occurs,
but the site of transection shows a slight disorganization
of the gray matter [41]. Another example is the regenerating spinal cord of bullfrogs that have been transected as
tadpoles, where the transection site is still visible 8
months after injury (and 6 after metamorphosis), showing a considerable constriction in size [15]. The differences can be striking, as occurs in the lizard where it has
been shown that the regenerated spinal cord in the tail is
considerably different from the uninjured cord and that it
only contains descending fiber tracts from the old cord
and scattered glial cells [45]. Other species show subtle
differences, as in the case of regenerating 1 year-old goldfish, where the regenerated spinal cord appeared normal
after 90 days post injury, but there were no motor horn
cells in the regenerated area [46]. In H. glaberrima, the
regenerated RNC has NURR 1 and GFS expressing neurons (albeit in lower numbers) and appears to be normal
according to all anatomical parameters used. Nonetheless, more detailed experiments are needed to fully determine that all cell populations and fiber connections are
present.
Finally, it is important to acknowledge that structural differences do exist in the regenerating nervous systems of
animals. The echinoderm ganglionated nerve cord differs
greatly from the regenerating nerves of some invertebrates
where only fibers are found, and from the complex cellular and fiber organization of the vertebrate spinal cord.
Thus, it remains unclear whether similar events occur during the regeneration of the different structures. Nonetheless, it will be by performing comparative studies, such as
this one, that the commonalities and differences in nerv-

Apoptosis
In vertebrates, apoptosis is associated with neurons that
have been injured at the time of transection, but also with
a period of secondary injury where the lesion size
increases due to inflammation, immune-related events
and hemorrhage [47-49]. Therefore, in our system, apoptosis within the nerve stumps seems to occur in cells
whose fibers were damaged by the transection and that
eventually failed to survive, undergoing apoptosis during
the first week following injury. This was also observed at
the TEM level in regenerating RNC of E. fraudatrix [23]
and in regenerating fish CNS where apoptotic cells are
seen for a long period of time following the lesion [50].

A different explanation might be involved in explaining
the increase in apoptosis observed within the regenerating
RNC in the second week following the transection. In this
case the apoptosis event might be similar to what has been
shown to occur during embryonic development in vertebrates, where about half of the neurons that are formed in
the spinal cord undergo apoptosis [51]. Neuronal death
in regenerating spinal cord has also been reported in the
tail of the fish Sternachus [1,52]. In these fishes, younger
segments of the regenerated spinal cord have a larger
number of neurons than older segments, once again suggesting that the regenerating spinal cord recapitulates the
known embryonic developmental process of overproducing neurons that will eventually be discarded.
Cell division
Cell division has been shown to occur in the regenerating
arms of several echinoderms, mainly crinoids and starfish
[20-22]. In crinoids, the nerve stump is also an active
place of cell proliferation, although the dividing cells in
the early stages appear to be non-neuronal [20]. In the
starfish Asterias rubens, it was found that cell division in
the regenerating nerve began 6–7 days following transection and increased during the next 2 weeks, gradually
decreasing to control levels by day 60 post-injury [22].
Similarly, our results show cell division to occur within
the ectoneural and hyponeural components of the nerve
stump, but even more within the regenerating RNC. However, it is still unclear what type(s) of cells are proliferating

Page 16 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Developmental Biology 2009, 9:3

since support cells, macrophages or some type of precursor cell could be accountable for the extent of cell division. This is a crucial issue that will be addressed below.
Nonetheless, in recent studies Mashanov and colleagues
[23] describe neurons and glial cells undergoing division
in the regenerating RNC of E. fraudatrix.
The overall pattern of cell division within the regenerating
RNC has some similarities to what has been shown to
occur in the adjacent muscle and connective tissue, where
cell division peaks between 6 and 12 days following injury
[28]. These two weeks of extensive cell proliferation are
undoubtly responsible for the finding that, at 30 dpi, animals have the same number of cells in the regenerated and
in the uninjured RNCs.
Formation of new neurons has been shown to be an
important process in animals where CNS regeneration is
known to occur. In fish, BrdU labeling together with backtracing techniques have shown that in the adult fish, neurons are regenerated from proliferating precursors following CNS injury [53]. In urodeles, new neurons are known
to originate from proliferating ependymal cells [14].
Whether new neurons take part in the regeneration of the
spinal tract observed in the chick embryo and the
neonateal opposum is not known [54]. However, recent
results suggest that stages where the ability to regenerate is
still present, coincide with those stages where there is
ongoing formation of new neurons [55]. On the other
hand it is important to emphasize that some vertebrates
can undergo functional regeneration with little or no contribution of neurogenesis, or that new neurons can originate from undifferentiated precursors.
In view of these findings, our results showing that neurons are present within the regenerated RNC and that
some originate from dividing precursors provide for interesting comparisons to other systems. At the same time we
must reconcile the finding that the densities of GFS and
NURR1 neurons are lower in the regenerated RNC. One
possible explanation is that the appearance of neurons in
the regenerated RNC is a late event and that at 62 dpi
some neuronal precursors have not fully differentiated.
This would be consistent with experiments in starfish,
where the first neurons observed in the regenerated segment following transection of the RNC were not observed
until 28 days following injury [22]. These results might
appear to contradict the observations by Mashanov and
colleagues [23] in E. fraudatrix, who observed some neuronal division in the early stages of RNC regeneration,
however, this might be explained when we take into
account that early division was observed using TEM, while
we used markers for differentiated neurons. Nonetheless,
it is important to emphasize that in both E. fraudatrix and
H. glaberrima neurons appear in the regenerated RNCs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/3

and that at least some of these neurons originate from
dividing precursors. Similarly, in crinoid regenerating
arms, some BrdU labeled neurons were recognized using
electron microscopy, suggesting that in this echinoderm,
neurons also originate from dividing precursors [21].
However, there are striking differences between neuronal
populations since the GFS neurons were not observed to
express BrdU, suggesting that they do not originate from
dividing precursors. Once again this is consistent with
studies in the transected starfish RNC where none of the
neurons identified with the S1 neuropeptide (the starfish
equivalent of GFS) showed BrdU labeling, even when
enough time was allowed following the BrdU treatment
for differentiaton to occur [22].
In order to fully identify the origin of neurons it will be
important to determine the role of glia in holothurian
RNC regeneration. Particularly in view that in E. fraudatrix
Mashanov and colleagues propose that glial cells might be
paving the path for neuron and fiber migration and even
differentiating into neurons [23]. The role of the glial cells
is not the only question that remains to be studied; several
other questions remain to be answered. For example, does
the observed anatomical regeneration provides for complete functional recovery? In many other model systems
the extent of regeneration has been evidenced by backtracing neuronal connections and comparing the regenerated
versus the uninjured connections. However, in view that
little is known about the echinoderm radial nerve circuitry
and nervous system physiology, it is not possible to determine at present to what extent there is morphological
connectivity. Similarly, in other animals functional recovery can be documented by behavioral tests, that, at
present, are not available for holothurians.
Comparison with other wound healing/regenerative
processes
Transection of the nervous system, whether experimentally induced or by accidental cause rarely, if ever, exclusively affect the nervous system. Thus, it is always
important to view the regeneration of the nervous component as a process that occurs parallel to the regeneration
of surrounding tissues. Granted, there are nerve-specific
processes, such as axonal regeneration and synaptic specificity, that only occur in the nervous system. However, it
is interesting that events that occur in the surrounding
muscle and connective tissue previously published by our
group [28] parallel those occuring within the nerve cord
itself. One of them has already been addressed above: the
pattern of cell division, showing that in muscle, coelomic
epithelium and connective tissue the proliferation pattern
coincides with that observed in the regenerating RNC.

Another event that provides for an interesting comparison
is the presence of morula or spheruloytes cells within the

RNC. These cells are rarely observed in uninjured nerves,
however, their numbers increase after injury. This increase
in cell numbers parallels what occurs within the regenerating intestine [32] and following the transection injury in
the adjacent tissues [28]. These cells have been proposed
to play important roles in extracellular matrix remodeling,
phagocytosis and antimicrobial activity, among others
[32]. The presence of these cells within the regenerating
nerve is quite intriguing and should be studied in further
detail.
The extent of apoptosis observed after nerve transection
can also be compared to what occurs during intestinal
regeneration. We have recently completed a study of
apoptosis during intestinal regeneration showing that
high levels of apoptosis take place in the mesothelium 7
days following evisceration (unp. Observation). In both
events, nerve regeneration and intestinal regeneration,
apoptosis is rarely observed in the early days (2–5 days)
following the injury or evisceration but occurs more likely
during the second week (7–14 days). Moreover, apoptosis
is more likely to take place within "new" tissues that have
regenerated such as the newly formed intestinal blastemalike structure and the regenerated RNC, than in adjacent
"old" tissues, such as the remaining nerve stumps or the
intestinal mesentery.
For many investigators involved in studies of neurogenesis or neuronal regeneration, their focus has been strictly
on the nervous system. However, our previous results
show that the same events that occur during wound healing, also occur during intestinal regeneration [28]. And
now we show that some of these events also occur during
nervous system regeneration. Moreover, at the species
level, the same species that can successfully regenerate
their nervous systems are known to be exceptional regenerators of others tissues or organs, not just the nervous system. Thus, a major implication of our work is that the
capacity to regenerate nervous system might be determined by the same processes and mechanisms in all tissues and that some animals have developed or retained
these capabilities while in others they are absent.
Although there are obvious exemptions to this statement,
such as liver regeneration in vertebrates, the general rule
remains that animals that have some capacity to regenerate their nervous system are, in general, good regenerators
of many tissues or organs. If this is correct, then investigators interested in deciphering the mysteries of nervous system regeneration should also focus on regenerative or
wound healing phenomena in other tissues and organs
and on species where these regenerative processes are
prominent.
