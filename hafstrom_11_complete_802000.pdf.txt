horizontal gene transfer

Abstract
Background: Brachyspira spp. colonize the intestines of some mammalian and avian species and show different
degrees of enteropathogenicity. Brachyspira intermedia can cause production losses in chickens and strain PWS/AT
now becomes the fourth genome to be completed in the genus Brachyspira.
Results: 15 classes of unique and shared genes were analyzed in B. intermedia, B. murdochii, B. hyodysenteriae and
B. pilosicoli. The largest number of unique genes was found in B. intermedia and B. murdochii. This indicates the
presence of larger pan-genomes. In general, hypothetical protein annotations are overrepresented among the
unique genes. A 3.2 kb plasmid was found in B. intermedia strain PWS/AT. The plasmid was also present in the B.
murdochii strain but not in nine other Brachyspira isolates. Within the Brachyspira genomes, genes had been
translocated and also frequently switched between leading and lagging strands, a process that can be followed by
different AT-skews in the third positions of synonymous codons. We also found evidence that bacteriophages were
being remodeled and genes incorporated into them.
Conclusions: The accessory gene pool shapes species-specific traits. It is also influenced by reductive genome
evolution and horizontal gene transfer. Gene-transfer events can cross both species and genus boundaries and
bacteriophages appear to play an important role in this process. A mechanism for horizontal gene transfer appears
to be gene translocations leading to remodeling of bacteriophages in combination with broad tropism.
Keywords: Brachyspira intermedia, genome comparison, bacteriophages, horizontal gene transfer, AT/GC-skew

Background
The genus Brachyspira currently comprises seven validly
published species: B. aalborgi, B. alvinipulli, B. hyodysenteriae, B. innocens, B. intermedia, B. murdochii and
B. pilosicoli. Collectively these form a distinct evolutionary line within the phylum Spirochaetes [1]. Brachyspira
spp. are oxygen-tolerant anaerobes that colonize the
intestines of some mammalian and avian species but
they differ in enteropathogenicity from important pathogens of livestock to presumed commensals. B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli are important porcine pathogens,

causing swine dysentery and porcine intestinal spirochetosis respectively. Two species, B. pilosicoli and B. aalborgi, can colonize humans and are suspected causes of
colitis. For a review, see Tsinganou and Gebbers [2].
B. intermedia commonly colonize the large intestine of
commercially farmed pigs and chickens and has also been
isolated from rodents [3] and ducks (Jansson, D. unpublished data). The species was originally named Serpulina
intermedia and described as possessing characteristics
related to both the pathogen B. hyodysenteriae and the
commensal B. innocens [4]. Later the species was transferred to the genus Brachyspira [5]. Data from field studies
have suggested that B. intermedia may be a mild enteropathogen of pigs [6-8], but experimental challenge in porcine isolates has failed to produce clinical disease [9-11].

In contrast, an experimental challenge in chickens with B.
intermedia isolates caused diarrhea, slow growth, and
reduced egg production. [12-14]. Diagnostically relevant
features associated with both B. hyodysenteriae and B.
intermedia include tryptophanase and b-glucosidase activity. In addition, they lack a-galactosidase activity and are
unable to hydrolyze hippurate [4,7]. The two species can
be differentiated by haemolytic properties, i.e., there is
strong b-haemolysis in B. hyodysenteriae and weak b-haemolysis in B. intermedia. Other recognized representatives
of the genus Brachyspira lack tryptophanase activity. Identification of isolates of B. hyodysenteriae, B. intermedia
and the proposed species “B. suanatina“ [15] by 16S
rRNA gene- sequence analysis is not feasible because they
form a common phylogenetic cluster [16]. Moreover, the
high genetic diversity between isolates as seen from the
results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multi-locus
sequence typing, and E-burst analysis have recently challenged the species delineation of weakly b-haemolytic and
tryptophanase-producing isolates as B. intermedia. [17,18].
It remains to be seen whether all isolates with the phenotype described as characteristic for B. intermedia will be
included in this species in the future.
Complete genome data from the two important porcine
pathogens B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli and the presumed commensal B. murdochii have been recently published [19-21]. The B. hyodysenteriae genome consists of a
3 Mb chromosome and a ~36 kb plasmid. Many of these
genes are more related to Clostridium and Escherichia
species than to non-Brachyspira spirochetes which suggests that horizontal gene-transfer events have taken place
[19]. The 36 kb plasmid is conserved among a large number of B. hyodysenteriae isolates but is not detected in any
avirulent field strain, which suggests that it is important
for virulence [22]. The only recognized gene-transfer
agent in Brachyspira spp. is a mitomycin-inducible defective prophage (VSH-1), which transducts 7.5 kb random
genomic fragments [23]. The B. pilosicoli genome is somewhat smaller, 2.6 Mb, and contains no plasmids. The B.
pilosicoli genome has been compared to B. hyodysenteriae
and a draft version of B. murdochii [21]. In our study the
genome of B. intermedia type strain PWS/A T (ATCC
51140) of porcine origin was completed and subjected to
comparative genomic analysis. With this new data we can
now compare four completed Brachyspira genomes and
significantly increase the understanding of different and
shared properties of the genomes. We also discuss horizontal movements of genes and the potential involvement
of bacteriophages in this process.

Results and discussion
General genomic features and genome plasticity

The B. intermedia strain PWS/AT genome consisted of
a single circular 3,304,788 base pairs (bp) chromosome

Page 2 of 13

and a 3,260 bp plasmid (Table 1). The phylogenetic distances to the other available genomes within the Brachyspira genus and to the spirochete Leptospira interrogans
(AE016823-24), calculated from average nucleotide similarity of the whole core genome [24], showed that B.
intermedia strain PWS/AT was most closely related to
B. hyodysenteriae followed by B. murdochii; it was somewhat more distantly related to the B. pilosicoli genome
(Figure 1). Also, average similarity distances indicated
that the B. pilosicoli genome was closest to B. murdochii
followed by B. intermedia and furthest from B. hyodysenteriae. This was in concordance with 16S rRNA
gene-based phylogeny [21]. The size of the chromosome
was only slightly larger than that of B. murdochii 56150T (3,241,804 bp), somewhat larger than that of B.
hyodysenteriae WA1 (3,000,694 bp) and noticeably larger than that of B. pilosicoli (2,586,443 bp). A total of
2,870 protein-coding genes (average length of 970 bp)
were predicted in the chromosome. In addition 33
tRNA genes and single copies of the ribosomal RNA
genes 5S (rrf), 16S (rrs) and 23S (rrl) were present.
Comparisons to the other sequenced Brachyspira replicons are shown in Table 1.
The G+C content for the B. intermedia strain PWS/
AT chromosome was 27.2% which is similar to that of
the other genomes in the genus. Interestingly, the small
plasmid had only 21.0% G+C content (Table 1). The G
+C content in intergenic regions was 20.4%, and in the
third positions of synonymous codons it was less than
10%. This indicates that Gs and Cs are shunned and the
average G+C content is determined by the requirements
of the G+C-containing codons. The small plasmid had a
lower coding density and therefore also a lower G+C
content.
The approximate origin of replication on the chromosome was located on the basis of the GC-skew pattern
and the sequence file was permuted to start at this
point. The leading strands (LES), defined as the plus
strand from the first half of the genome and the minus
strand from the second half, were enriched in Gs and
also weakly enriched in Ts (Table 2). The origin of
replication has previously been assumed to be adjacent
to the dnaA gene [19,21]. It has also been suggested
that the origin of replication has been relocated during
evolution [21]. Our analysis showed that the origin of
replication was not linked to the dnaA gene and if the
origins for all Brachyspira genomes were set according
to the skew analysis; a distinct non-permutated X-pattern could be seen in the genome alignments (Figure 2).
These new positionings of the origin of replications are
also supported by the Ori-Finder program [25]. The
relative positions of the dnaA gene and the skew-analysis based origin-of-replication are shown in Figure 3.

skew) is usually considered to be associated with cytocine deaminations (C->T changes) in LES as a consequence of different exposure as single-stranded DNA.
However, the asymmetry can have many causes, such as
transcription-coupled cytocine deaminations or repairs,
differences in gene density between the strands, and
residue and codon bias [26]. An analysis of the local
GC-skew pattern in the B. intermedia genome gave
oscillating values that strongly correlated with gene
direction. In order to better understand the sources of
the asymmetry in this genome we broke down the skew
patterns into LES, LAS, and coding and noncoding
regions (Table 2). The overall LES skew was shown to
be strongly influenced by codon frequencies on LES and
LAS. In fact, the pattern seen in a sliding window GC-

skew plot was almost entirely a consequence of enrichment in the number of genes on LES, i.e., a total of
1639 genes (57%) on LES compared to 1231 genes
(43%) on LAS. This skew did not seem to be an effect
of transcription-induced mutations but rather constraints on codons. Codons starting with G were 3.3
times more frequent than codons starting with C. Since
there were more codons on LES, the result was a GCskew. Codons starting with A were 1.8 times more frequent than codons starting with T so one would expect
A enrichment on LES. However, since this was an ATrich genome, the impact of the mutationally induced
skew was stronger for AT than for GC. This counteracted the expected an enrichment, resulting in a very
weak T enrichment. Intergenic regions seemed to give a

Distances were measured by the Average Similarity of the conserved Core genome (ASC) method and the tree was constructed using the
UPGMA method.

more unbiased measure of mutational skew with G and
T enrichment on the leading strand (Table 2). In addition, for any given codon position, there were relatively
more Gs and Ts in LES than in LAS.
Genes can relocate symmetrically around the origin of
replication as a consequence of replication-dependent
rearrangements [27]. The effects of such rearrangements
could be seen as an X-pattern in our alignments (Figure
2). Interestingly, genes tended to switch between LES to
LAS at a certain frequency during this process, as represented by the intermixed red and blue dots in Figure 2.
LES and LAS genes could partially be distinguished
from each other because they had different AT-skews at
the third positions of synonymous codons (Table 2). An
examination of the AT-skew values of individual genes
showed that they were normally distributed around the
average for LES and LAS (Figure 4). Interestingly, deviations from the normal distribution were found at low
skew values for LES and high skew values for LAS (Figure 4). This suggests that some high AT-skew genes had
recently moved from LES to LAS and some low ATskew genes from LAS to LES. Thus, there seemed to be
equilibrium between LAS and LES gene movements that
slightly favored LES. This is probably related to reduced

fitness of the bacteria if certain highly expressed genes
are moved to LAS because of less efficient transcription.
The 3.2 Kb plasmid in B. Intermedia PWS/AT is also
present in B. murdochii 56-150T

A 3,260 bp plasmid was found with three putative genes:
Bint_4001 (48.7 KDa), Bint_4002 (15.3 kDa) and
Bint_4003 (4.4 kDa). We could not assign functional annotations to these genes, but a low level of similarity was
found between Bint_4002 and a Roseburia replication
initiator protein (48% similarity over 69% of the sequence,
GenBank accession no. ZP_04745519). By comparing the
coverage of the plasmid and the chromosome in the
assembly, we could estimate the copy number to be
approximately 36. We used four PCR reactions to amplify
the genes and an intergenic region to screen for the plasmid in a panel of 10 Brachyspira strains (Table 3). We
could detect the plasmid with all four PCR reactions in B.
Intermedia PWS/AT and B. murdochii 56-150T. None of
the other tested strains/isolates gave PCR products. The B.
murdochii 56-150 T genome has been sequenced and
deposited in GenBank but the plasmid has not been
described [20]. We downloaded the B. murdochii 454
reads from NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) and

mapped them onto our plasmid using the Roche GS mapper. The recreated draft B. murdochii plasmid sequence
was approximately 96% identical at nucleotide level to the
B. intermedia plasmid. Thus, the plasmid seems not to be
restricted to B. intermedia PWS/AT but it is far from ubiquitous in Brachyspira isolates.
The 55.9 kb B. hyodysenteriae WA1 plasmid previously described was not present in B. intermedia
PWS/AT. However, some of the B. hyodysenteriae WA1
plasmid genes were homologous to genes in the B. intermedia, B. murdochii and/or B. pilosicoli chromosomes.
Several of the homologous genes showed high conservation and only 10 genes, many of which encode glycosyltransferases (Additional file 1, “plasmids” tab), were
genuinely unique to the plasmid. A cluster of four genes
(rfbA, rfbB, rfbC and rfbD) has been discussed previously
in terms of virulence [19,22]. They were all conserved in
the B. intermedia chromosome although one gene
(rfbA) contained two nonsense mutations. The rfbaA-D

genes are involved in the rhamnose biosynthesis pathway and are believed to modify the O-antigen backbone
of the cell wall LOS. These data suggest that rhamnose
biosynthesis capacity may be present in B. intermedia
strains, independent of their 32 kb plasmid. However,
the inactivation of the rfbA gene in this strain suggests
it may not be essential for virulence in B. intermedia
PWS/AT. It will be interesting to see if the rfbA-D gene
cluster is present and if it is functional in other B. intermedia strains and correlates to pathogenicity.
Genome comparison

Complete genome sequences from B. hyodysenteriae

and a comparative analysis between the completed B.
hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli, and the draft version of
B. murdochii have been made [21]. We can now add a
fourth completed genome, B. intermedia, and also use a
completed version of the B. murdochii genome to

pan-genome of the brachyspira species B. intermedia (I),
B. hyodysenteriae (H), B. murdochii (M) and B. pilosicoli
(P) into 15 classes (IHMP, IHM, IHP, IMP, HMP, IH,

BLASTP e-value with a > 1e-9 cutoff. The number of

genes in each class is shown in Table 4 and Figure 5.
Some genes were close to the threshold cutoff value and
we therefore included the e-values in the table to
describe the genes so that a manual estimation can be
made for individual genes (Additional file 1). In the previous comparisons 1,589 genes unique to B. murdochii,

content unique to and shared between B. intermedia (I), B.
hyodysenteriae (H), B. murdochii (M) and B. pilosicoli (P) based on a
BLASTP comparison analysis with an e-value cutoff set to 1e-9. 15
classes can be recognized (IHMP, IHM, IHP, IMP, HMP, IH, IM, IP, HM,
HP, MP, I, H, M and P).

recombination and repair” compared to the other
unique classes. The IHM class (genes lost by B. pilosicoli) was particularly abundant in COGs representing
transport and metabolism of inorganic ions, amino acids
and carbohydrates. The lower number of inorganic ion
transport and metabolism genes in B. pilosicoli has previously been observed [21].
Species-unique genes

B. intermedia had the greatest number of unique genes
followed by B. murdochii whereas B. hyodysenteriae and
B. pilosicoli had lower numbers (Figure 6). The number
of unique genes at a cutoff set to 1e-9 and 1e-4 respectively was I = 269/226, H = 116/89, M = 212/167 and P
= 131/98 ("twilight” genes in the interval 1e-4 to 1e-9
are shaded grey in Additional file 1). The large number
of unique B. intermedia genes was partly a consequence
of two prophage regions. The number of B. intermedia
specific phage annotated genes was 22, but probably 60
of the genes belong to the phages.
More specialized species usually undergo reductive
evolution, thereby losing unnecessary genes [29]. The
smaller number of specific genes in the more niched
pathogens B. hyodysenteriae (swine dysenteriae) and B.
pilosicoli (intestinal spirochaetosis) suggests they have a
higher degree of specialization. Thus, the major reason
for the greater number of unique genes in B. intermedia
and B. murdochii is probably related to the presence of
larger pan-genomes due to higher diversity within these
species.
A majority of the unique genes, in all species, were
annotated as coding for hypothetical proteins. This
shows that, in general, the specific traits and aspects of
virulence mechanisms are poorly studied. In the high-

Page 8 of 13

cutoff comparison (BLASTP e-value < 1e-4), only 13
functionally annotated chromosomal genes specific for
B. hyodysenteriae were found. There were three citrate
lyases, two pepdidases, an acetyltransferase, a transmembrane protein, an ethanolamine utilization protein, an
Appr-1-p processing enzyme, a small MutS-related
domain protein, an ankyrin repeat-containing protein,
an YcfA-like protein, and an OrfC protein. The B. hyodysenteriae plasmid also contained several specific glycosyltransferases and hydrolases. B. intermedia specific
genes, apart from phage-related genes, included five
microcompartmental proteins, a beta-galactosidase,
three glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, several
restriction enzyme system-related genes and an extracellular solute-binding protein. B. pilosicoli specific genes
included several transporters, a peptidase, two sialidase
(neuraminidase) family-like proteins, a class D beta-lactamase and a protein possibly involved in chromosome
segregation. B. murdochii specific genes included a
CRISPR system, two capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis proteins, two SNARE associated Golgi -related proteins, two STAM (AMSH)-SH3 domain associatedproteins, several transcription regulators, and DNA
replication proteins.
Genes shared by two species

One could expect that the two more specialized pathogens, B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli, would share
some virulence-associated genes, but they had the least
number of shared genes. Actually, only two hypothetical
proteins were shared at the higher stringency level. This
most likely reflects the fact that these two species seem
to exploit distinctly different life strategies. The greatest
number of shared genes for any pair of species was that

and B. pilosicoli (P) were divided into 15 classes (IHMP, IHM, IHP, IMP, HMP, IH, IM, IP, HM, HP, MP, I, H, M and P) on the basis of a BLASTP
comparison and an e-value > 1e-9 cutoff. Gene classifications are color coded as follows: red for putative phage genes, green for putative
virulence genes, blue for genes coding for hypothetical proteins. The remaining genes are colored purple.

Håfström et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:395
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/395

for B. murdochii and B. pilosicoli. The high number was
partly a result of a common phage found in one copy in
B. pilosicoli and in three copies in B. murdochii. The
phages are described in more detail below.
Genes shared by three species (conserved genes lost by
one species)

The greatest number of shared genes between three species was in the class B. intermedia, B. hyodysenteriae
and B. murdochii. One could see these genes as conserved genes lost by B. pilosicoli during reductive evolution. In particular, B. pilosicoli has lost many transportrelated proteins which could reflect its adaptation to a
more specialized ecological niche. The higher level of
reductive evolution in B. pilosicoli suggests it is an older
pathogen than B. hyodysenteriae. The pathogenicity of
the younger B. hyodysenteriae could be related to its
acquisition of the 32 kb plasmid. The least number of
genes was found in the B. hyodysenteriae, B. murdochii
and B. pilosicoli category. This corresponds to conserved
genes lost by B. intermedia. This, once again, shows B.
intermedia to be the species with the largest number of
accessory genes.
Bacteriophages and their role in horizontal gene transfer
(HGT)

A phage-like gene transfer element named VSH-1 is
known to have the capacity to transduct randomly packaged genomic material between B. hyodysenteriae strains
[23]. The B. intermedia VSH-1 region had a small cluster of putative VSH-1 like genes located approximately
16 kb upstream of the main part of VSH-1, similarly as
previously described in B. hyodysenteria [30]. Here we
report two new B. intermedia bacteriophages, pI1 and
pI2 (Figure 3). pI1 was located almost completely adjacent to the VSH-1 phage-like element (Bint_0105Bint_0143). It had a size of ~28 kb and contained 37
genes (Bint_0068- Bint_0103) of which 36 were unique
to B. intermedia also at the high stringency level (evalue < 1e-4). Interestingly, one gene coding for a
hypothetical membrane-spanning protein, Bint_0072,
was conserved in B. hyodysenteriae (BHWA1_02012, evalue = 5e-18). This suggests that an HGT event has
taken place and that the pI1 phage has acquired this
gene from another B. intermedia or B. hyodysenteriae
strain and transferred it to this strain.
The second phage, pI2, was ~16 kb and contained 24
genes (Bint_1512- Bint_1535) divided into three regions.
The first region (Bint_1512-Bint_1525) and the third
(Bint_1531- Bint_1535) were unique for B. intermedia
also at the high stringency level. However, the second
region (Bint_1526-Bint_1530) had similarities to both
the VSH-1 phage-like element of the Brachyspira species and to the shared phage found in B. pilosicoli and

Page 9 of 13

B. murdochii. Thus, this phage seems to be a hybrid
that has acquired new properties from other phages or
VSH-1 phage-like elements. The genes in this region
were annotated as hypothetical proteins and endolysin
glycoside hydrolase.
In the gene classification described above, one bacteriophage was found conserved in B. pilosicoli and B.
murdochii. One copy was present in B. pilosicoli (pP1:
BP951000_1459- BP951000_1482) and three in B. murdochii (pM1: Bmur_1293- Bmur_1315, pM2:
Bmur_1677Bmur_1699,
pM3:
Bmur_2253Bmur_2275). Two of the B. murdochii phages, pM1 and
pM2, were almost identical to each other while the pM3
phage showed higher variability, especially in one region.
A comparison of the pP1 phage with the pM1-3 phages
revealed an extra gene, BP951000_1480, that codes for a
DNA methylase (Figure 7). This gene had a deviating
GC-skew value compared to all other phage genes suggesting that it recently had been inserted into the phage.
The DNA methylase was most related to a Lactobacillus
DNA-methylase (GeneBank accession no.: ADF83450, evalue: 4e-51). Thus, the gene has probably been
acquired from outside the Brachyspira genus.
It has been shown that Brachyspira spp. and Clostridium share an unexpected amount of significant gene
similarity [19]. When comparing the pP1 and pM1-3
phages to sequences in GenBank, we found homology to
a Clostridium phage in the complete genome of the C.
botulinum strain A2 Kyoto (Additional file 2). This suggests the phages may occasionally transfer between species and genera and exchange genetic material resulting
in cross-species and cross-genus HGT events.
In our analysis, we have seen several indications of
putative HGT events mediated by bacteriophages. However, we still have only a single genome sequence for
each species and this is a major limitation when analyzing HGT events. The rapid development of sequencing
technology will hopefully give us opportunity to characterize a larger set of genomic data from Brachyspira
spp. in the future. This will permit a more robust HGT
analysis. Also the gene classification will become more
robust as the dataset will grow. The accessory gene-pool
is likely to increase, but the truly unique genes for each
spices will likely decrease, sorting out the essential species specific factors better.

Conclusions
In this study, we classified the accessory gene pool into
different classes of shared and unique genes. In general,
the unique genes are poorly annotated, which shows our
lack of knowledge about species-specific processes. B.
intermedia and B. murdochii contain more material specific to them and probably a larger pan-genome. B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli are both more specialized

pathogens that have less accessory genetic material and
diversity. They have specialized independently, as seen
by the little genetic material shared only between them.
These two genomes were also the two smallest, indicating that reductive evolution had taken place [31]. The
traces of reductive evolution involved loss of genes,
especially transport proteins. This is most obvious in B.
pilosicoli suggesting it has been influenced by reductive
evolution for a longer time. The pathogenicity of B. hyodysenteriae could in analogy with Yersinia pestis [32], be
a result of the acquisition of a plasmid.

The gene content of the different classes of accessory
genes is under the influence of HGT. Here we outlined
a mechanism for HGT between classes that involves
gene rearrangements involving bacteriophages with
broad tropism. Our data also suggest cross genus HGT
events could have occurred via the phages. These
mechanisms need further studies if we want to understand the dynamics of the complete pan-genome of the
species.
Genome sequencing of more strains will probably
reduce the numbers of unique and shared features

Håfström et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:395
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/395

even more. Although we now have a markedly more
confined list of candidate genes, the large number of
annotations for “hypothetical proteins” among the
unique genes shows that it is of great importance to
study gene functions in order to understand speciesspecific traits.

Methods

Page 11 of 13

The skew analysis was made by functions in Artemis
and DNAplotter and by in-house made scripts. LES and
LAS genes were defined and exported in Artemis and a
perl script was used to count the number of a/c/t and
g’s in each codon position. The whole genome was also
analyzed using a perl script where LES and LAS were
separated based on the positioning of oriC and the genome feature file was used to identify non-coding regions.

Bacterial culture, DNA preparation and 454 sequencing

The B intermedia type strain PWS/A T was obtained
from the American type culture collection
(ATCC®51140). The strain was cultured twice on fastidious anaerobe agar plates supplemented with 10%
equine blood (FAA). The purity of the strain was
assessed by phase-contrast microscopy. Genomic DNA
was prepared using the Qiagen DNAeasy kit. Parallel
sequencing was performed using the Roche 454 FLX
platform. One half picotiterplate of shotgun sequences
was produced and de novo assembled using the GS
assembler (Newbler). In total, 193,367 reads with an
average length of 245 bp were assembled into 203 contigs with sizes ranging between 100 and 138,989 bp. The
average coverage was 14X. Contigs were handled by the
Consed package [33]. Gaps, uncertain regions, and misassemblies were closed and solved manually by PCR,
Sanger sequencing, and local reassemblies. The estimated average sequence quality as reported by Consed,
based on the Q values of the reads (-10log(Pe)) was 1.5
errors in 10,000 bp. Sequence reactions were performed
with the BigDye® Terminator v.3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems) and analysed in an ABI PRISM ® 3100 Genetic
Analyzer at Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA. A
total of 218 Sanger reads were incorporated into the
assembly.
Sequence analysis and annotation

Genes were predicted using Glimmer 3 [34]. Annotations were handled by the Artemis software [35]. Conserved genes for B. intermedia, B. hyodysenteriae, B.
murdochii and B. pilosicoli were automatically annotated
by comparison at protein level and transfer of annotation data. Less conserved genes were queried against the
proteins of all microbial genomes and NCBI nr. Manual
inspections were made when similarities were weak.
tRNAscan-SE [36] was used to identify tRNAs genes
and rRNA genes were defined by their similarity to
other Brachyspira sequences. Circular DNA plots of the
B. intermedia genome and plasmid were drawn with
DNAplotter [37]. Genome alignments were made with
Mummer [38] and ACT [39].
Complete nucleotide sequences and annotations of the
B. intermedia chromosome and plasmid have been
deposited in the GenBank database, accession numbers
CP002874 (chromosome) and CP002875 (plasmid).

Unique and shared genes

All-against-all protein sequence comparisons were made
and genome-specific best hits (BeTs) were calculated
[28]. A BeT was considered to represent conservation
between two proteins if the e-value was lower than 1e-9.
The BeTs were used to assign each gene to a class using
a perl script that compared all BeTs from every protein
to all proteomes in the analysis. The results were collected in Additional file 1. Genes were compared using
BLASTP. Genes with a best hit e-value < 10-9 were considered to be conserved. Gene pairs with e-values
between 1e-4 and 1e-9 were considered to be in a “twilight zone”. Genes were classified into 15 classes (IHMP,
IHM, IHP, IMP, HMP, IH, IM, IP, HM, HP, MP, I, H,
M and P) on the basis of the BLASTP values. Functional
classification into phage and putative virulence factors
were made by manual inspection.
Plasmid analysis

The plasmid was purified with a standard plasmid miniprep protocol. The PCR amplifications of plasmid genes
were made with the following primer-pairs G1f 5’CAATTTTAATGCTAAGACTTTGAA-3’, G1r 5’-CGC
TTTAATGTTCTATTCGG-3’, G2f 5’-GTTTTACCT
TTCATATCATCACAA-3’, G2r 5’-TTTTCTGTCG
TCATTATCTTTTC-3’, G3f 5’-GACTAACGCACCGA
CAATAAT-3’, G3r 5’-AATTCTTAATAGTTGCCTTT
CAGTA-3’. The following templates were used: B. intermedia PWS/AT , B. intermedia AN2004/1/01, B. hyodysenteriae AN1409:2/01, B. “suanatina” AN4859/03R , B.
innocens B256T, B. innocens AN64/1/04, B. murdochii
56-150 T B. murdochii AN1780/3/03, B. alvinipulli
AN1268/3/04 and B. pilosicoli P43/6/78T.
Genomic comparisons

Average Similarity of the conserved Core method (ASC)
[24] was used to measure the phylogenomic distance
between the complete genomes of B. intermedia PWS/
AT, B. hyodysenteriae WA1, B. murdochii 56-150T, B.
pilosicoli 95/1000 and Leptospira interrogans
(AE016823-24). A dendrogram was created by converting a similarity matrix to a distance matrix and calculating a tree rooted using Leptospira interrogans as
outgroup species with the UPGMA method using PHYLIP 3.67 through the Mobyle platform (http://mobyle.

Håfström et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:395
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/395

pasteur.fr/). A phylogenetic tree was then plotted using
PhyloDraw
(http://www.bioinformatics.org/wiki/
PhyloDraw).
Distribution of Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG)
categories

All proteins from all four Brachyspira genomes in the
analysis were compared with the COG database [28].
BeTs were identified and COG classes were assigned to
all proteins matching the COG database with an e-value
below 1e-9. The COGs for each species and gene content class were summarized in a table (Additional file 1)
and inspected to identify conservation patterns of specific functions.
