Abstract
Background: Microbes must sense environmental stresses, transduce these signals and mount
protective responses to survive in hostile environments. In this study we have tested the hypothesis
that fungal stress signalling pathways have evolved rapidly in a niche-specific fashion that is
independent of phylogeny. To test this hypothesis we have compared the conservation of stress
signalling molecules in diverse fungal species with their stress resistance. These fungi, which include
ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and microsporidia, occupy highly divergent niches from saline
environments to plant or mammalian hosts.
Results: The fungi displayed significant variation in their resistance to osmotic (NaCl and sorbitol),
oxidative (H2O2 and menadione) and cell wall stresses (Calcofluor White and Congo Red). There
was no strict correlation between fungal phylogeny and stress resistance. Rather, the human
pathogens tended to be more resistant to all three types of stress, an exception being the sensitivity
of Candida albicans to the cell wall stress, Calcofluor White. In contrast, the plant pathogens were
relatively sensitive to oxidative stress. The degree of conservation of osmotic, oxidative and cell
wall stress signalling pathways amongst the eighteen fungal species was examined. Putative
orthologues of functionally defined signalling components in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were
identified by performing reciprocal BLASTP searches, and the percent amino acid identities of these
orthologues recorded. This revealed that in general, central components of the osmotic, oxidative
and cell wall stress signalling pathways are relatively well conserved, whereas the sensors lying
upstream and transcriptional regulators lying downstream of these modules have diverged
significantly. There was no obvious correlation between the degree of conservation of stress
signalling pathways and the resistance of a particular fungus to the corresponding stress.
Conclusion: Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that fungal stress signalling components
have undergone rapid recent evolution to tune the stress responses in a niche-specific fashion.

Background
Microbes require robust stress responses to survive changing environments, and in particular, pathogenic microbes
must mount effective responses to counter the defences of
their host. The cellular and molecular responses to stress
involve both acute and adaptive phases. Acute responses
generally attempt to minimise the damage caused by
harmful effects of a stress, such as the immediate physicomechanical forces imposed by an osmotic stress [1]. In
contrast, adaptive responses generally promote the restoration of cellular homeostasis with a view to allowing the
growth of the microbe under the new conditions [1-3].
Cells that fail to adapt adequately to a relatively severe
stress may die [4,5].
To mount appropriate acute and adaptive responses, cells
must sense the change in their environment and activate
the cognate signal transduction pathways that induce
these responses [4]. In this study we focused on hyperosmotic, oxidative and cell wall stress signalling pathways
because these have been shown to contribute to fungal
virulence and their sensitivity to antifungal drugs [6-11].
However, these stress signalling pathways have been characterized to the greatest extent in the relatively benign
model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
In S. cerevisiae, the HOG (High Osmolarity Glycerol)
MAPK (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase) pathway is
required for responses to osmotic stress [4,12]. The Stress
Activated MAP Kinase (SAPK) Hog1 is central to this pathway. Hog1 activity is regulated by the MAP kinase kinase,
Pbs2 [13]. In turn Pbs2 activity is controlled by two independent osmosensing branches involving Sho1 and Sln1,
respectively [14,15]. Sho1 is a putative osmosensor that
regulates the Pbs2-Hog1 MAP kinase module directly
[16], whereas Sln1 controls a phosphorelay system that
down-regulates the MAP kinase module in the absence of
hyperosmotic stress [4,17]. In response to hyperosmotic
stress Pbs2 becomes activated, leading to the phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Hog1, and the subsequent activation of osmo-protective mechanisms such as
the accumulation of the osmolyte, glycerol. A well-characterized model of the osmotic stress pathway in S. cerevisiae
was recently described by Krantz and coworkers (2006)
[18].
Oxidative stress signalling in S. cerevisiae has been
reviewed by Moye-Rowley (2003) [19], and Ikner and
Shiozaki (2005) [20]. The transcription factor Yap1p
plays a key role in the activation of oxidative stress genes
[21,22]. Yap1 activity is regulated by the upstream regulators Gpx3, Ybp1 and Tsa1. The heat shock transcription
factor Hsf1p contributes to the activation of protective
functions during the oxidative stress response [23,24]. In
addition, HOG signalling is thought to regulate Yap1 syn-

thesis. Also, the cAMP-protein kinase A signalling pathway down-regulates the activity of the partially redundant
transcription factors, Msn2 and Msn4, which contribute
to the core stress response that helps to protect S. cerevisiae
against oxidative stress.
Genetic or chemical insults to the S. cerevisiae cell wall
lead to the activation of the cell wall stress (or cell integrity) pathway, which mediates compensatory changes in
cell wall architecture [25]. Cell wall stresses are detected
by specific sensors in the plasma membrane, such as
Wsc1, Wsc2, Wsc3, Mid2 and Mtl1 [26,27]. These sensors,
together with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate
(PI4,5P2), stimulate nucleotide exchange on the GTPbinding protein Rho1 [28]. PI4,5P2 activates the guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) Rom1/2 [29] at
the plasma membrane [30]. Then, Rho1 activates the protein kinase C (Pck1) MAP kinase cascade. This cascade
involves sequential activation of the MAPKKK Bck1, the
MAPKK's Mkk1 and Mkk2, and the MAPK Mpk1/Slt2 [3134].
Arguably these stress signalling pathways have been best
characterised in S. cerevisiae. However, it is becoming clear
that there are differences in stress signalling and stress sensitivities amongst fungal species, for example amongst S.
cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida albicans
[35-38]. This presumably reflects their evolution in dissimilar environments where they have been exposed to
different types and intensity of stress [39]. Approximately
1.5 million fungal species are thought to exist, and their
great diversity reflects the heterogeneity of the niches they
occupy [40]. For example, free-living ascomycetes are frequently found in the soil, tree products, plant roots and
on fruit, and are often transported between substrates via
insect vectors [41]. Numerous ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are important plant pathogens. Now that genome
sequences are becoming available for an increasing
number of diverse fungal species, it is becoming increasingly possible to perform broad bioinformatic comparisons of stress regulators across fungal species and thereby
to examine the evolution of fungal stress signalling pathways. The first step in such a comparison is the identification of putative orthologues of stress signalling molecules
in these fungal genomes. This approach has been used
effectively to assign provisional functional annotations to
protein coding genes identified by genome sequencing
[42-44], to measure the effects of functional genomic variables on protein evolution rates [45-47], and applied to
other areas of evolutionary genomics [48], thereby
increasing our understanding of eukaryotic evolution
[49,50].
The available data suggest that fungal stress signalling
pathways are evolving rapidly and in a niche-specific fash-

ion to protect different species against the contrasting
environmental stresses they encounter in their diverse
niches. This hypothesis implies that fungal stress resistance is evolving in a manner that is independent of fungal
phylogeny. To test this hypothesis we have explored the
degree of conservation of fungal stress regulators relative
to their relatively well-characterised orthologues in S. cerevisiae, focusing on the osmotic, oxidative and cell wall
stress pathways. We selected eighteen fungal species for
this analysis, all of which have had their genomes
sequenced and annotated. These species have evolved in
divergent niches, and they show a wide variety of virulence phenotypes. The data have highlighted the strong
conservation of particular fungal G-proteins and protein
kinases involved in stress signalling, and the rapid evolution of upstream sensors and downstream transcription
factors on these pathways. In addition we have performed
the first direct comparison of the sensitivities of these
fungi to osmotic, oxidative and cell wall stresses, thereby
confirming the diversity of stress phenotypes amongst the
species examined. Our data confirm the lack of correlation between stress sensitivity and the degree of conservation of stress regulators. Our data are consistent with the
rapid polyphyletic evolution of fungal stress responses.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships
A preliminary objective was to reconfirm the phylogenetic
relationships of the fungi under analysis (Methods).
Encephalitozoon cuniculi was selected as outgroup for the
reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). As
expected, the fifteen ascomycetes examined were separated into three well-resolved groups: the Saccharomycotina (7 genera, 99% bootstrap support), the
Pezizomycotina (7 genera, 100% bootstrap support) and
the Archiascomycetes (1 genus: S. pombe). The ascomycetes formed a well-supported clade, which was the sister
group of the basidiomycetes. Lastly, the microsporidial
species E. cuniculi is very different from the other two taxa,
based on its genetic distance. This was entirely consistent
with the recent work of Fitzpatrick and co-workers (2006)
[51] who described similar phylogenies when they created
a supertree based on 4,805 gene families from 42 complete fungal genomes. Therefore, our phylogenetic tree for
the 18 fungal species of interest is robust and consistent
with accepted views.
Phenotypic analyses
Our first main objective was to compare the sensitivities
of the various fungal species to osmotic, oxidative and cell
wall stresses. Fourteen of the eighteen fungal species were
subjected to these tests. Cryptococcus neoformans, Coccidioides immitis, Chaetomium globosum and E. cuniculi are classified as category 3 pathogens by the Advisory Committee
on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) and hence were

excluded from this part of analysis. The sensitivities of
yeast-like species were examined during their exponential
growth phase (OD600 = 0.8 – 1.0: data not shown). The
stress sensitivities of the filamentous fungi were examined
using established approaches. Hence we examined the
impact of various stresses conditions upon the germination of non-vegetative A. gossypii and M. grisea spores,
Aspergillus conidia, and F. graminearum and N. crassa macroconidia [52,53]. The data are presented in Figure 2 and
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (also see additional file 1).
Osmotic stress sensitivity
The sensitivity of each fungal species to osmotic stress was
examined using a range of NaCl and sorbitol concentrations, which impose ionic and non-ionic osmotic stresses,
respectively [54]. S. pombe and A. gossypii exhibited the
greatest sensitivity to NaCl, their growth being completely
inhibited by 1 M NaCl. In contrast, C. albicans, C. glabrata
and D. hansenii were the most resistant to NaCl (Figure 2,
Table 1). While C. albicans and D. hansenii are members of
the CTG clade (i.e. the clade of organisms in which the
CTG codon is decoded as serine instead of leucine), C. glabrata is not (Figure 1). The growth of these species was
only slightly inhibited by 1.5 M NaCl, and no growth was
observed at concentrations above 2 M NaCl. The rest of

1). Once again S. pombe and A. gossypii were the most sensitive to sorbitol, and C. albicans and C. glabrata were
amongst the most resistant species. Interestingly, compared with other species, the halotolerant yeast D. hansenii was relatively sensitive to sorbitol but resistant to NaCl
(Tables 1 and 2). Also the human pathogen, A. fumigatus
was more sensitive to NaCl than sorbitol, by comparison
with the other species. Indeed all of the human pathogens
tested were resistant to sorbitol. With the exception of A.
gossypii, M. grisae and N. crassa, the ascomycetes tested
were relatively resistant to sorbitol (Table 2). The basidiomycetes species tested (U. maydis) was sensitive to both
osmotic stresses.
Oxidative stress sensitivity
The sensitivities of the fungi to oxidative stresses were
tested by plating on media containing hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) and menadione (Tables 3 and 4; see also additional file 1). F. graminearum and M. grisae were particularly sensitive to H2O2 whereas the human pathogen C.
glabrata was exceptionally resistant to this oxidative stress.
M. grisea was also sensitive to menadione as well as H2O2,
suggesting that this plant pathogen is sensitive to oxidative stresses in general. In contrast F. graminearum, C. albicans and K. lactis were relatively resistant to menadione. It
is interesting to note that, in general, the human pathogens were relatively resistant to the oxidative stresses
tested, whereas the plant pathogens tested were relatively
sensitive.
Cell wall stress sensitivity
Finally, we tested the sensitivity of the cell wall stresses
using Calcofluor White and Congo Red. These inhibitors

cans, activating compensatory changes in cell wall architecture via the cell wall stress signalling (or cell integrity)
pathway. The majority of fungi investigated were resistant
to both Calcofluor White and Congo Red (Tables 5 and
6). S. pombe and C. glabrata stood out as the most resistant
species to these cell wall stresses, whereas D. hansenii and
Y. lipolytica were the most sensitive to these stresses. In
contrast, K. lactis and C. albicans were sensitive to Calcofluor White, but relatively resistant to Congo Red. The
basidiomycete U. maydis was sensitive to both inhibitors.
Regarding the other plant pathogens, F. graminearum was
relatively resistant to Calcofluor White, but sensitive to
Congo Red. The reverse was true for M. grisae. In general
the human pathogens were relatively resistant to both

stresses, the exception being the sensitivity of C. albicans
to Calcofluor White. The non-pathogenic Pezizomycotina

Having tested the sensitivity of the fungal species to
osmotic, oxidative and cell wall stresses, we examined the
degree of conservation of regulatory proteins on the corresponding stress signalling pathways. C. neoformans, C.
immitis, C. globosum and E. cuniculi were included in these
analyses. We assumed for the purposes of this study that
the functions of orthologues are conserved across the fungal species examined. This allowed us to map putative regulators to the corresponding stress signalling pathways

that have been characterized in S. cerevisiae. However, this
assumption does not always hold, and the possibility that
these regulators might execute alternative functions in a
particular species should be borne in mind.
First, putative orthologues were identified for each S. cerevisiae protein in the other seventeen fungal species by
screening for reciprocal best hits, as described in Materials
and Methods. Lists of fungal orthologues are presented as
additional file 2. Proteins involved in osmotic, oxidative
and cell wall stress signalling were then selected, based on
recent models of these pathways in S. cerevisiae. We used
the model of the osmotic stress signalling pathway
reported by Krantz and co-workers (2006) [18], the cell
wall stress pathway described by Levin (2005) [25], and a

model of the oxidative stress signalling pathway based on
the reviews of Moye-Rowley (2003) [19] and Ikner and
Shiozaki (2005) [20]. We then examined the conservation
of each signalling pathway in each fungus by collating the
percent identities for the relevant regulators, relative to
their S. cerevisiae orthologues, as reported by BLASTP (Figures 3, 4 and 5). The orthologues are listed in the additional file 2.
Mean percent identities were then calculated for each regulator. This allowed the comparison of osmotic, oxidative
and cell wall stress signalling components across the
eighteen fungal species under investigation (Figures 3, 4
and 5). The Hog1 SAPK and the G-protein Cdc42 stand
out as being the most highly conserved signalling molePage 6 of 18

play key roles in the oxidative stress response in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, C. albicans and C. glabrata [7,21,22,55]. This
also holds for Msn2/4 orthologues. However in this case,
while Msn2/4 orthologues contribute to oxidative stress
responses in S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata, they do not do so
in C. albicans [36,55,56].

With regard to oxidative stress signalling (Figure 4), members of the glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems are well
conserved (Tsa1 and Gpx3). Also, Ras (Ras1/2) and protein kinase A (Tpk1/2/3) are well conserved. (The strong
conservation of Hog1 has already been mentioned.) Once
again, downstream transcription factors involved in oxidative stress signalling are poorly conserved. This is the

kinase (Slt2). Also, the sensors of cell wall stresses (Wsc1/

signalling components. Also, the transcription factors that
are downstream targets of these signalling modules are
less well conserved (Swi4/6, Rlm1). However, subunits of
the glucan synthase are highly conserved (Fks1/2). These
lie downstream of Rho1 signalling, and are essential for
cell wall biosynthesis [25,57,58].
Individual diagrams have been created to illustrate the
degree of conservation of each regulator in each fungus
relative to S. cerevisiae (see additional file 3). Generally,
the above observations hold across the individual fungal
species we examined. In general core signalling molecules
are more highly conserved than upstream and downstream components.

Discussion
In this study we have compared directly the stress sensitivities of a diverse group of fungal species for the first time
(Figure 1). These species were selected on the basis that
their genomes had been sequenced and annotated (Table
7). This allowed us to examine the evolutionary conservation of stress signalling components amongst ascomycete,
basidiomycete and microsporidial species. Our study has
focused on osmotic, oxidative and cell wall stress signalling. A number of significant observations have been
made.
The first main observation was that the fungal species
examined displayed wide variation in their resistance to

osmotic, oxidative and cell wall stresses (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 and 6). For example, while some fungi showed acute
sensitivity to osmotic stress (S. pombe, A. gossypii), others
were relatively resistant (C. albicans, F. graminearum). Similarly, some fungi were relatively sensitive to oxidative
stress (D. hansenii, M. grisea), whereas others were
extremely resistant to this type of environmental insult (C.
glabrata).
Interestingly, some species showed differential sensitivities to the alternative osmotic, oxidative and cell wall
stresses. For example, D. hansenii was resistant to NaCl,
but less resistant to sorbitol (Tables 1 and 2). NaCl
imposes a salt (ionic) stress in addition to an osmotic
stress, whereas sorbitol imposes a non-ionic stress
[54,59]. D. hansenii has been isolated from saline environ-

ments such as sea water [60] and concentrated brines [61].
This species is known to be more osmotolerant than S. cerevisiae [60], accumulating glycerol and to a lesser extent
arabitol as compatible solutes [62,63]. This difference is
due in part to more effective sodium extrusion by D.
hansenii [64].
A. nidulans, F. graminearum, C. albicans, K. lactis and S. cerevisiae showed differential responses to the oxidative
stresses tested (Tables 3 and 4). These fungi were more
resistant to menadione than H2O2. This was consistent
with the findings of Mutoh and co-authors (2005) [65]
who previously reported that S. pombe is more sensitive to
H2O2 than menadione. This would appear to suggest that
these fungi are better able to detoxify the superoxide generated by menadione, than the peroxide anions generated

by H2O2. However in S. cerevisiae, peroxide is generated
from superoxide by superoxide dismutases, this peroxide
subsequently being detoxified by catalases [66,67]. Therefore it might seem counterintuitive for some fungi to be
more resistant to menadione. However when transition
metals are present, H2O2 can also be converted to the
hydroxyl radical, which is more potent than the superoxide radical [67,68]. Therefore the relative sensitivity of
some fungi to H2O2 might reflect a reduced capacity to
detoxify hydroxyl radicals.
Differential sensitivities to the cell wall stress were also
observed (Tables 5 and 6). Calcofluor White and Congo
Red responses interact with different components in the
fungal cell wall. Calcofluor White binds to nascent chitin,
inhibiting the assembly of chitin chains in the wall [6972]. In contrast, Congo Red is generally thought to inhibit
β-1,3-glucan assembly in the cell wall [73-76]. S. cerevisiae
mutants with an increased chitin content in the cell wall
are more sensitive to Calcofluor White, whereas mutants
with reduced chitin are more resistant to Calcofluor White
[76-78]. It follows that the differential fungal sensitivities
to Calcofluor White and Congo Red might be explained,
at least in part, by the different chitin and β-glucan contents of their cell walls. In S. cerevisiae, C. albicans and S.
pombe, β-1,3-glucan accounts for 50 – 55% of the cell wall
dry weight and is responsible for much of the mechanical
strength of the cell wall [58,79,80]. Chitin is a relatively
minor constituent of the yeast cell wall comprising 1 to

2% of the cell wall dry weight in S. cerevisiae, C. albicans
[58,81,82]. The S. pombe cell wall was reported to contain
no chitin [83-85], but more recently a small amount of
chitin was detected [0.3% of dry weight: [86]]. This low
chitin content probably accounts for the Calcofuor White
resistance of S. pombe (Table 5). However the filamentous
fungi were relatively resistant to Calcofuor White and
Congo Red, and yet chitin is a major component of their
cell walls [82,87]. The Neurospora cell wall contains 10–
20% chitin [87-89], whereas in A. nidulans chitin constitutes up to 40% of the cell wall [90]. Therefore additional
mechanisms must account for the relative Calcofuor
White resistance of the filamentous fungi.
Our second main observation was that there was no clear
correlation between fungal phylogeny and stress resistance (Figures 3, 4 and 5). In some cases closely related
fungi displayed similar stress sensitivities. For example,
the Aspergillus species examined (Eurotiomycetes) were
relatively resistant to the cell wall stresses (Calcofluor
White and Congo Red: Figure 5) and displayed similar
responses to osmotic stresses (NaCl and sorbitol: Figure
3). The Saccharomycetes, C. albicans and D. hansenii,
which also belong to the CTG clade (where the CTG
codon is translated as serine, rather than leucine), were
both highly resistant to NaCl (Figure 3). However in other
cases, closely related fungal species displayed contrasting
stress sensitivities. For example, C. glabrata was much
more resistant to osmotic, oxidative and cell wall stresses

Page 10 of 18

than S. cerevisiae (Figures 3, 4 and 5). F. graminearum was
more resistant to NaCl and menadione than M. grisae.
Also, C. albicans was more resistant to H2O2, menadione
and Congo Red than D. hansenii.
This was extended by more systematic analysis of individual stress response pathways. The mean percent identity
was calculated for all components of a given stress
response pathway in each species. These data were then
plotted against the differential impact of that same stress
upon S. cerevisiae and the comparator species (by calculating the difference between their mean growth inhibitions
for the stress in question). If pathway sequence divergence
is indicative of increasing differences in stress response,
then a negative correlation would be expected of this analysis (i.e. a lower mean pathway percentage identity would
correlate with greater differences in stress response). In
fact in every case, the regression R2 coefficients were less
than 0.09 (completely non-significant), and for all but
one stress, correlations were weakly positive (see also
additional file 4). Therefore, this analysis confirmed that
there is no correlation between the degree of conservation
stress regulators and the similarity of stress phenotypes.
We conclude that fungal stress phenotypes have evolved
rapidly and in a polyphyletic manner.
Presumably this rapid evolution of fungal stress phenotypes has been driven by local and niche-specific environmental pressures. If this was the case, one might expect to
observe a correlation between the stress phenotype of a
particular fungus and the nature of the environmental
niche that it occupies. Our data are consistent with this
view. For example as described above, D. hansenii, which
was has been isolated from saline environments, is resistant to salt stress but less resistant to a non-ionic osmotic
stress (Figure 3). Also, the human pathogens we examined
(A. fumigatus, C. glabrata and C. albicans) were highly
resistant to oxidative stress, whereas the plant pathogens
(M. grisea, F. graminearum, A. gossypii and U. maydis) were
sensitive to this type of stress (Figure 4).
Phagocytic cells are a first line of defence against fungal
infections, generating superoxide, H2O2, and hydroxyl
radicals in an attempt to destroy the phagocytosed pathogen [91-93]. The major fungal pathogen C. albicans activates oxidative stress responses when exposed to human
blood, macrophages or neutrophils [11,94-97]. Indeed
the virulence of C. albicans is dependent upon its ability to
counteract oxidative stress [6,8,10,11]. Therefore it is
hardly surprising that C. albicans has evolved to become
relatively resistant to oxidative stress [98]. The same is true
for another opportunistic fungal pathogen. C. glabrata is
highly resistant to oxidative stress [55,92,99-101] even
though phylogenetically it is more closely related to S. cerevisiae than to C. albicans [102].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/44

Our third main observation was that, despite the critical
importance of stress responses for the environmental
robustness of the fungi, the upstream sensors and downstream transcriptional regulators on three stress signalling
pathways show a low degree of sequence conservation
(Figures 3, 4 and 5). Core components of the stress pathways are relatively strongly conserved. In some cases these
core components play multiple cellular roles. For example, core components of the cell wall stress (cell integrity)
pathway and in Ras-cAMP-protein kinase A signalling
play key roles in the regulation of growth and cell polarity
[30,103,104]. Therefore their strong sequence conservation is to be expected. In contrast, the upstream sensors
and downstream transcriptional regulators generally play
more specific roles in the detection of environmental
stress and the activation of stress-specific responses.
Clearly the evolutionary divergence of specific sensors or
transcriptional regulators could contribute to the differential stress phenotypes of these fungal species by modulating the sensitivity of each species to a particular type of
stress and tuning the strength of the molecular response to
that stress. Therefore, the low degree of conservation of
the upstream and downstream signalling components is
entirely consistent with the rapid polyphyletic evolution
of fungal stress resistance in response to niche-specific
selection pressures.
Our evolutionary comparison of stress signalling components was based on the identification of the fungal orthologues of S. cerevisiae. Orthologues were defined on a
genome-wide basis by identifying the best reciprocal hits.
In some cases it was not possible to identify orthologues
in all of the species examined. In many of these cases this
probably reflects the lack of a genuine orthologue. However in some cases genuine orthologues might have fallen
below the BLAST cut-off due to their low level of sequence
similarity. In other cases the presence of an orthologue
was not detected because of the existence of closely related
paralogous gene pairs in S. cerevisiae that arose through
the ancient genome duplication [105]. In these cases, the
BLAST search for S. cerevisiae 'paralogue A' identified a
particular fungal 'gene X', but the reciprocal BLAST search
for 'gene X' identified S. cerevisiae 'paralogue B', thereby
yielding no reciprocal best hit. Despite these health warnings, most commonly used orthology resources are based
on reciprocal best hits. These include Clusters of Orthologues Genes [C/KOGs: [106,107]], INPARANOID
[108,109] and the NCBI resource, HomoloGENE [110].
Also, it should be noted that, as our comparisons were
based on S. cerevisiae, fungal proteins that exist in other
species but not in S. cerevisiae will not have been identified in this study. Nevertheless, our study has provided a
comprehensive list of fungal orthologues to S. cerevisiae
proteins in seventeen divergent fungal species (see additional file 2). We have used this resource to study fungal

stress signalling, but it is freely available for the analysis of
other aspects of fungal molecular and cell biology.

Conclusion
Our comparison of the stress resistance of diverse fungal
species has revealed a high degree of variation in their
resistance to osmotic, oxidative and cell wall stresses. Fungal species that are closely related in phylogenetic terms
did not necessarily display similar levels of stress resistance. Human pathogens tended to be more resistant to
stress, with the exception of Candida albicans which was
relatively sensitive to the cell wall stress, Calcofluor White.
Plant pathogens tended to be sensitive to oxidative stress.
We have examined the degree of conservation of osmotic,
oxidative and cell wall stress signal transduction pathways
in the eighteen diverse fungal species. Central components of these signalling pathways are generally well conserved, whereas upstream sensors and downstream
transcriptional regulators have diverged to a greater
extent. No correlation between the degree of conservation
of stress signalling pathways and the resistance of a particular fungus to the corresponding stress was observed. The
data reinforce the view that stress signalling components
have evolved rapidly to protect fungal species against the
environmental insults they experience in their specialized
niches.

Growth conditions
C. albicans, C. glabrata, D. hansenii, K. lactis, S. cerevisiae, S.
pombe, U. maydis and Y. lipolytica colonies were picked
from YPD plates, inoculated into 5 ml of YPD, and incubated overnight at 30°C at 200 rpm [112].

Fragments of A. gossypii mycelia were placed on AFM agar
plates and incubated for 7 days at 30°C [adapted from
[123]]. Mycelial mats were then removed, resuspended in
800 μl H2O and 200 μl zymolyase-100T, and incubated at
37°C for 4 hours. 1 ml of 0.03% Triton X-100 were added
and the spores were collected by centrifugation at 5000
rpm for 5 min. The spores were washed twice with 0.03%
Triton X-100.
Disks of A. fumigatus mycelia (2.5 cm diameter) were
inoculated on PDA plate and incubated upside down at
37°C for 5 days [115]. The conidia harvested by gentle
scraping three times into 3 ml 0.1% Tween 20, and the
conidial suspension filtered through 4 layers of Miracloth
(Calbiochem, Merck Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) to
remove hyphae.
Disks of A. nidulans mycelia (2.5 cm diameter) were inoculated on MNVUU plates and incubated upside down at
28°C for 7 days [117]. Conidia were then harvested using
the same procedure as for A. fumigatus but water was used
instead of Tween solution to scrape the plate.

Aspergillus nidulans mycelia or conidia were grown on
MNVUU (minimal medium: [116,117]). Fusarium
graminearum mycelia or macroconidia were grown on
SNA [synthetic nutrient poor agar: [118,119]]. Magnaporthe grisea mycelia or spores were grown on CM [complete medium: [120]]. Neurospora crassa mycelia were
grown on solid Vogel's medium using D-glucose instead
of sucrose as described by Vogel (1956) [121] and
Selitrennikoff and Sachs (1991) [122]. All strains were
maintained as frozen stocks and then cultured on the
appropriate media.

Using the above methods we were able to standardize the
growth conditions under which the stress phenotypes for
yeast and filamentous species were examined as far as was
practically possible. However, these growth conditions
were not optimal for some species, and this might have
affected their stress resistance.

Small fragments of agar containing F. graminearum mycelia were placed on fresh SNA plates [119]. Plates were
sealed with Parafilm and incubated under blue/white
light for 8–10 days at 25°C. Macroconidia were harvested
using the same procedure as for A. nidulans.
Filter papers containing M. grisea mycelia were placed on
CM plates and incubated upside down at 25°C for 14
days [adapted from [120]]. Spores were harvested using
the same procedure as for A. nidulans.
N. crassa mycelia were grown in 250 ml conical flasks containing 40 ml solid VgS medium [adapted from [124]].
Flasks were incubated in the dark at 28°C for 3 days, and
then in the light for 2 more days. Macroconidia were harvested into 50 ml dH2O, and the suspension transferred
to a 15 ml Falcon tube. This was repeated three times to
maximize the yield of macroconidia.
Stress sensitivity assays
Osmotic stress was applied using NaCl (0–3 M range) and
Dsorbitol (0–3 M range). Oxidative stress was imposed
using H2O2 (0–30 mM range) and menadione sodium
bisulfate (0–0.5 mM range). Cell wall stress was applied
using Calcofluor White (0–300 μg/ml range) and Congo
Red (0–500 μg/ml range).

Overnight cultures of C. albicans, C. glabrata, D. hansenii,
K. lactis, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, U. maydis and Y. lipolytica
grown in YPD at 30°C, were used to inoculate 10 ml of
YPD to a starting OD600 of 0.1. The cells were grown at
30°C at 200 rpm to an OD600 of 0.8 – 1.0. These exponential cells were then serially diluted and 3 μl drops of
each dilution (100–10-5) were spotted onto YPD plates
containing the appropriate stress treatment. Growth was
assessed after 2 days incubation at 30°C.
In general, the stress assays for the filamentous fungi were
performed under the growth conditions described above.
Exceptions were the media used for A. fumigatus and N.
crassa conidial stress assays. A. fumigatus conidia were
grown on YG [yeast extract agar: [125]]. For N. crassa Lsorbose was added to Vogel's growth medium to promote
colonial growth [126]. Fresh spore or conidial suspensions were serially diluted and 3 μl drops of each dilution
(100–10-5) were spotted onto plates containing the appropriate stress treatment. Growth of the filamentous fungi
was examined after 2 days incubation, except for M. grisea,
which was examined after 5 days incubation. Experiments
were repeated at least three times.
Quantitative analysis of stress resistance
To semi-quantitatively compare the stress resistances of
the fungal species analysed under the conditions tested,
the percentage of growth of each species was calculated
relative to their non-stress control for each stress condition. For each species, the total number of spots observed
across the dilutions (100–10-5) for each stress condition
tested was counted and expressed as percentages of those
on the corresponding control plates (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6). To obtain a global view of the response of each
fungal species to each osmotic (NaCl and sorbitol), oxidative (H2O2 and MD) and cell wall (CFW and CR) stress the
mean relative growth (%) was calculated for each species
under analysis for each condition tested. To measure relative growth, the amount of growth in the presence of stress
was divided by the amount of growth observed for
unstressed cells of the same species and expressed as a percentage.
Phylogenetic analyses
Eight S. cerevisiae proteins were used as queries for our
phylogenetic analyses: actin [127], 3- phosphoglycerate
kinase [128], translation elongation factor EF-1 alpha
[129], the cyclin-dependent protein kinase, Cdc28 [130],
adenylate cyclase [131,132], and the transcription factors
Gcn4, Mig1 and Fap1 [133-135], which belong to different gene families. These S. cerevisiae protein sequences
were retrieved from the Saccharomyces Genome Database
(SGD: http://www.yeastgenome.org). The sequences of
the orthologues of these proteins in the other fungal species under analysis were retrieved by BLASTP [136] using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/44

the SGD protein sequences as queries (see additional file
5). Manual searches were undertaken at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information using NCBI databases, including the non-redundant protein sequence
database (nr database) currently containing approximately 900,000 sequences http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/
BLAST/. BLASTP search parameters were set to default.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA3.1
[137] available at http://www.megasoftware.net/.
Sequences were aligned using ClustalW [138]. A concatenated phylogenetic tree was then produced by neighbourjoining (NJ) clustering [139]. The phylogeny was drawn
using the p-distances method to correct for multiple
amino acid substitutions per site and rate heterogeneity
amongst sites. The substitution of amino sites per site was
0.05 (scale bar underneath tree). Clade stability was
assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic
trees were presented using TreeView [140].
Identification of putative orthologues
The complete annotated fungal genome sequences were
retrieved from the databases in Table 7[144-155]. Putative
orthologues were identified for each S. cerevisiae protein
in each fungal species under analysis using the reciprocal
best hit (rbh) method [46,141]. We define 'putative
orthologues' as two proteins, one from each fungal
genome, that are each other's reciprocal best hit [142].
Perl scripts were used to reformat the amino acid sequence
data (formatdb), to perform reciprocal BLASTP searches,
and to generate output files that provide the accession
number for each orthologue, its percentage identity to the
corresponding S. cerevisiae protein and the match score.
Automated reciprocal BLASTP searches were performed
[143] using the default parameters except that scoring
parameter compositional adjustments were set to "no
adjustment" and the filter parameter was set automatically to "low complexity regions". Putative orthologues
were not identified for all S. cerevisiae proteins in every
species above the default BLASTP cut-off, which was set to
10 by default. Only the reciprocal best hits identified in
this way were considered for further analysis. Where no
significant reciprocal hit was identified, the score was left
blank.
