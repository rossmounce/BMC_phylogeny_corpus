Abstract
Background: The metabolism of the rigid bacterial cell wall heteropolymer peptidoglycan is a dynamic process
requiring continuous biosynthesis and maintenance involving the coordination of both lytic and synthetic enzymes.
The O-acetylation of peptidoglycan has been proposed to provide one level of control on these activities as this
modification inhibits the action of the major endogenous lytic enzymes, the lytic transglycosylases. The Oacetylation of peptidoglycan also inhibits the activity of the lysozymes which serve as the first line of defense of
host cells against the invasion of bacterial pathogens. Despite this central importance, there is a dearth of
information regarding peptidoglycan O-acetylation and nothing has previously been reported on its de-acetylation.
Results: Homology searches of the genome databases have permitted this first report on the identification of a
potential family of O-Acetylpeptidoglycan esterases (Ape). These proteins encoded in the genomes of a variety of
both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including a number of important human pathogens such as
species of Neisseria, Helicobacter, Campylobacter, and Bacillus anthracis, have been organized into three families
based on amino acid sequence similarities with family 1 being further divided into three sub-families. The genes
encoding these proteins are shown to be clustered with Peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferases (Pat) and in some
cases, together with other genes involved in cell wall metabolism. Representative bacteria that encode the Ape
proteins were experimentally shown to produce O-acetylated peptidoglycan.
Conclusion: The hypothetical proteins encoded by the pat and ape genes have been organized into families based
on sequence similarities. The Pat proteins have sequence similarity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa AlgI, an integral
membrane protein known to participate in the O-acetylation of the exopolysaccaride, alginate. As none of the
bacteria that harbor the pat genes produce alginate, we propose that the Pat proteins serve to O-acetylate
peptidoglycan which is known to be a maturation event occurring in the periplasm. The Ape sequences have
amino acid sequence similarity to the CAZy CE 3 carbohydrate esterases, a family previously known to be
composed of only O-acetylxylan esterases. They are predicted to contain the α/β hydrolase fold associated with
the GDSL and TesA hydrolases and they possess the signature motifs associated with the catalytic residues of the
CE3 esterases. Specific signature sequence motifs were identified for the Ape proteins which led to their
organization into distinct families. We propose that by expressing both Pat and Ape enzymes, bacteria would be
able to obtain a high level of localized control over the degradation of peptidoglycan through the attachment and
removal of O-linked acetate. This would facilitate the efficient insertion of pores and flagella, localize spore
formation, and control the level of general peptidoglycan turnover.

The Oacetylation of peptidoglycan occurs at the C-6 hydroxyl group of MurNAc residues (shown in red) to generate the corresponding 2-N-6-O-diacetylmuramyl residue (OAcMurNAc). B. The lytic transglycosylases (LT) require a free C-6 hydroxyl
group to catalyze the formation of 1,6-anhdyroMurNAc products. The R denotes the stem peptide associated with the C-3 lactyl moiety of MurNAc residues.

Background
Peptidoglycan is an essential component of most eubacterial cell walls (the exceptions are the mycobacteria). It provides osmotic stability by serving as an exo-skeleton
through which cellular shape is imparted. The tensile
strength of this multilayered polymer is provided by two
types of covalent linkages. The first consists of β-1,4 glycosidic bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc)
and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNaC), while the second
occurs through cross-linking of the tetrapeptides associated with MurNAC residues on adjacent glycan strands
(Figure 1).
Peptidoglycan biosynthesis occurs in three stages
(reviewed in [1]). The first involves the synthesis of soluble precursors in the cytoplasm leading to the production
of UDP-linked MurNAc-pentapeptide. This muropeptide
is then transferred to the membrane carrier bactoprenol
via a pyrophosphate group and a GlcNAc residue is added
to produce the membrane-associated, lipid II precursor.

By an unknown mechanism, this lipid-linked precursor is
translocated to the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane. Now exposed to the periplasm in this third stage of
biosynthesis, the available muropeptide is polymerized
into the existing peptidoglycan sacculus, a reaction catalyzed by the transglycosylase domain of the class A highmolecular weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
Once polymerized, the transpeptidase domain of both the
class A and class B high-molecular weight PBPs catalyze
the formation of cross-links between the peptides of
neighboring glycan strands.
The peptidoglycan sacculus which surrounds the entire
bacterium is not a static structure as it must permit the
growth and division of the bacterial cell [1]. Furthermore,
insertion of cell wall structures that transverse the peptidoglycan layer, such as secretion/transport complexes,
flagella, and pili, require the sacculus to be constantly
remodeled and reinforced [2]. These processes are performed by the coordinated action of peptidoglycan

synthesizing PBPs and the peptidoglycan lytic enzymes.
The peptidoglycan cleaving enzymes are numerous and
there exists a specific lytic activity for each linkage in peptidoglycan. The amidases cleave the stem peptide from the
MurNAc residues, glucosaminidases hydrolyze the β-1,4
linkage between GlcNAc and MurNAc residues, and both
the lytic transglycosylases and muramidases cleave the
other β-1,4 glycosidic bond that exists between MurNAc
and GlcNAc (reviewed in [3]). Collectively, these enzymes
are called autolysins because their uncontrolled activity
will lead to the lysis of bacterial cells. Given the potential
lethal activity of the autolysins, the cell has to control their
activity. This is accomplished, at least in part, by associating these enzymes in a holoenzyme complex that includes
both the lytic enzymes, which provide sites for the insertion of new peptidoglycan precursors, and the synthesizing PBPs. The major glycolytic enzyme associated with
these holoenzyme complexes appears to be the lytic transglycosylases [1]. These enzymes are not hydrolases but
cleave the β-1,4 linkage between GlcNAc and MurNAc
with the concomitant formation of 1,6-anhydromuramoyl residues [4] (Fig. 1).

incorporated muropeptides (reviewed in [5,6]). Two
models have been proposed to account for the transfer of
acetate from cytoplasmic pools of acetyl-CoA to
muramoyl residues in the peptidoglycan sacculus [6]. The
first is a two protein system involving an integral membrane protein responsible for the translocation of acetate
from the cytoplasm to the periplasm where it is accepted
by a second more soluble protein which transfers it specifically to the C-6 hydroxyl of muramoyl residues in peptidoglycan. This system is modeled on the proposed
pathway for the O-acetylation of the exopolysaccharide,
alginate, produced by the opportunistic human pathogen
Pseudomonas aeruginosa [14,15]. The other model invokes
a single-enzyme system, exemplified by the action of Nod
X for the O-acetylation of the carbohydrate-based nodulation factor by Rhizobium leguminosarum [16], which functions to concomitantly translocate and transfer the acetate
from the cytoplasm to peptidoglycan. Recently, an
enzyme has been identified within S. aureus that appears
to function according to the second pathway [17], but
more experimental evidence will be required to bear this
out.

Given the inherent importance of peptidoglycan, it is not
surprising that lysozyme, one of the most important components of the first line innate immune response of
eukaryotic hosts to invading bacteria, targets this polymer.
Hydrolysis of the β-1,4 glycosidic linkage between GlcNAc and MurNAc destabilizes the integrity of the sacculus
and ultimately leads to cell lysis. A number of pathogenic
bacteria are able to avoid the potentially lethal effects of
lysozyme through the addition of an acetate group to the
C-6 position of MurNAc (reviewed in [5,6]) (Figure 1).
These pathogens include both Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. Several studies have shown
that a direct correlation exists between the extent of Oacetylation and susceptibility to lysozyme-catalyzed
hydrolysis of peptidoglycan [7-11]. However, the Oacetylation of peptidoglycan has also been shown to preclude the action of the endogenous lytic transglycosylases
[12]. Intuitively, this would be expected given that the
mechanism of action of these latter enzymes requires a
free C-6 hydroxyl group on MurNAc to produce their reaction product, the corresponding 1,6-anhydro derivative.
This has prompted the proposal of two roles for peptidoglycan O-acetylation; one to protect the bacterium from a
host immune response, while the second would be to regulate the action of endogenous autolysins [13].

Herein, we describe the identification of a putative cluster
of ORFs that encode both hypothetical O-acetyltransferases and O-acetyl esterases that we propose act on peptidoglycan to provide a dynamic process for attachment
and removal of O-acetate, respectively. This proposal is
supported by experimental data which demonstrate that
representative bacteria harboring these ORFs do Oacetylate their respective peptidoglycan sacculi. This study
thus represents the first to identify the presence of Oacetylpeptidoglycan in a variety of other human pathogens and the proteins involved in both the attachment
and removal of this O-linked acetate.

There is a dearth of information concerning the pathway
for the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan, and nothing is
known about its subsequent removal. All available evidence indicates that O-acetylation is a maturation event,
occurring in the periplasm after the cross-linking of newly

Results and discussion
Initial identification of a peptidoglycan O-acetylation
cluster in N. gonorrhoeae
N. gonorrhoeae is known to O-acetylate its peptidoglycan
[5,6], however, the genes responsible for this process
remain unidentified. Based on the available data, we have
postulated that peptidoglycan O-acetylation may follow a
similar pathway to that involved with the O-acetylation of
the exopolysaccharide alginate produced by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa [6]. Thus, to help identify potential genes associated with O-acetylation, the N. gonorrhoeae genome was
probed with algI (U50202) [14,15], a P. aeruginosa gene
encoding a putative membrane-bound, family 1 O-acetyltransferase [6]. A homologue of AlgI with 33% amino acid
identity (51% similarity) was discovered in the raw
sequence data of the unfinished genome project of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 [18] even though this bacterium does not
produce alginate. The ORF encodes 478 amino acids and
sequence alignments revealed that the hypothetical

protein possesses the signature motifs associated with the
family 1 O-acetyltransferases [6], including the common
F-W-R/N-R-W-H motif in the central region of the proteins (Fig. 2). Given that N. gonorrhoeae does not produce
alginate, we propose that the hypothetical membraneprotein functions to O-acetylate peptidoglycan which is
known to occur as a periplasmic, maturation event [5].
Thus, we have named the gene patA for peptidoglycan Oacetyltransferase A.
Analysis of sequences downstream from the patA locus led
to the discovery of two more ORFs which, when subjected
to BLASTP sequence similarity searches, permitted their
tentative assignment of function to be associated also with
the metabolism of acetate (Fig. 3). Thus, the third ORF in

this cluster is predicted to be a hypothetical 44,087 Da
protein of 397 amino acids having 49% sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of an acetyl xylan esterase (EC
3.1.1.72) from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (Fig. 4). This R.
flavefaciens enzyme belongs to the family 3 carbohydrate
esterases (CE3) of the CAZY classification [19]. Each of
the other previously known members of family CE3 are
also acetyl xylan esterases which aid in the degradation of
xylan by removing the blocking O-linked acetate
(reviewed in [20]). Although not well characterized,
sequence similarity comparisons have permitted the identification of potential catalytic Asp, His, and Ser residues
which could form a catalytic triad characteristic of the
GDSL and TesA hydrolases [21]. As seen in Figure 4, these
invariant residues are also present in the hypothetical N.

gonorrhoeae protein together with associated signature
motifs. Given the significant sequence similarity, it follows that the N. gonorrhoeae protein also has similar secondary structural elements compared to the family CE3
proteins, as predicted by the Garnier and PSI PRED programs (Fig. 4).
As N. gonorrhoeae is not a xylanolytic bacterium and its
genome does not appear to encode xylanases, we postulate that the hypothetical family CE3 esterase functions on
peptidoglycan to specifically catalyze its de-O-acetylation.
This hypothetical protein was thus named Ape1 for Oacetylpeptidoglycan esterase 1. It has a high predicted pI
value of 8.782 which is typical of periplasmic proteins
associated with the metabolism of bacterial cell walls and
thus provides further evidence in support of its proposed

function. It should be noted that Ape1 (and all of the Ape
proteins described below) do not have any significant
sequence homology to either the Streptococcus pneumoniae
peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (EC
3.1.1.-) [22] or the recently discovered N-acetylmuramic
acid deacetylase (EC 3.5.1.-) from Bacillus subtilis [23],
each of which belong to family CE4.
BLASTP analysis of the second ORF in this potential cluster of genes suggested that its deduced sequence of 335
amino acids is weakly similar to lysophospholipase and
related esterases (E value 4e-04). Searches for known
domains within its sequence using the CD-Search program indicated that it too resembled the GDSL and TesA
hydrolases despite having only 18.6% identity with Ape1.
Notwithstanding this low identity, the alignment revealed

53.4% similarity between the two hypothetical proteins
and further analysis indicated that the second
hypothetical protein does possess some of the Ape1
sequence motifs, including the GDS and Dx(V/T)H motifs
containing the potential catalytic Ser, Asp, and His residues, respectively. Hence, this ORF was tentatively labeled
ape2.
The patA, ape1, and ape2 gene sequences discovered on the
N. gonorrhoeae chromosome were used in BLASTP
searches of both the finished and unfinished genome
sequences of the NCBI database. These searches led to the
identification of 18 other bacteria that possess this cluster
of genes (Fig. 3). This list includes some important human
pathogens, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive, such
as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Bacillus
anthracis, respectively.
Homology of Pat sequences
The recognition of homologs to the acetyltransferase AlgI
from P. aeruginosa and their organization into a family has
been described previously [6]. In the current study, we
extend the list with new family members that include
sequences from a variety of human pathogens such as species of Helicobacter, Campylobacter, Neisseria, and Bacillus,
in particular, Bacillus anthracis (Fig. 2). All of the additional sequences from these diverse bacteria have at least
49% amino acid similarity to the P. aeruginosa AlgI despite
the fact that none produce the exopolysaccharide alginate.
In addition, each of these sequences contain the membrane-bound O-acetyltransferase (MBOAT) domain
(pfam03062) [24]. However, none of the hypothetical
proteins have significant homology to the acyltransferase
3 domain (pfam 01757) in the recently identified peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase, OatA, from Staphylococcus
aureus [17].
Architecture of the hypothetical O-acetylpeptidoglycan
esterases (Ape)
The in silico identification of signature sequence motifs
within the hypothetical Ape proteins was performed using
a variety of programs. Predictions made using PSI PRED
indicated that the sequence of secondary structural elements was very similar amongst each of the deduced proteins and that each contained the α/β hydrolase fold
associated with the GDSL and TesA hydrolases (data not
shown). This analogy was extended using Clustal W alignments and MEME/MAST motif discovery searches which
demonstrated the strict conservation of two signature
motifs that are also associated with the GDSL and TesA
hydrolases (Fig. 5). The first of these, motif I, is
characterized by the sequence GDS(H/F) which contains
the potential catalytic serine residue, while the Dx(V/T)H
of the other (motif VII) includes both the catalytic aspartyl
and histidyl residues. In addition to these common

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/49

sequence motifs, unique signature motifs were discerned
within the intervening regions of the hypothetical proteins which permitted the subdivision of the individual
sequences into a total of three separate Ape families, with
family 1 being further divided into subfamilies (labeled a,
b, and c) (Fig. 6). While the intervening sequences motifs
distinguish the three Ape families, they nonetheless maintain the overall α/β fold of the proteins.
The Ape1 family of proteins are characterized by three
additional common segments of sequence similarity
which exist toward the C-terminal end of the proteins and
thus closer to motif VII (Figs. 5 and 6). Three respective
consensus motifs, labeled IV, V, and VI, were identified
within these regions and hence, the Ape1 sequences are
characterized by a total of five common sequence motifs.
The subfamily classification of the family 1 proteins is
based on the presence or absence of a large sequence of
approximately 100 amino acids immediately following
motif I. Ape1a and Ape1b subfamilies contain this segment while it is absent in the family 1c sequences. Within
this segment, only one conserved motif could be identified (motif II) and differences within it delineate the two
subfamilies 1a and 1b. Although the rest of this extra segment is not highly conserved amongst the Ape1a and 1b
homologs, a high amount of β-sheet structure is predicted
for each. In an attempt to identify its possible function,
the entire segment from each of the 12 hypothetical proteins was subjected to BLASTP searches. The only known
protein that could be retrieved with any significance (E ≥
1.0) from the database by this search was penicillin-binding protein 4 (PBP 4) from Bacillus subtilis which was
obtained by probing with the segment from B. thetaiotamicron Ape1b. Interestingly, amino acid sequences similar to
this N-terminal region of B. subtilis PBP4 are found in the
N-terminal regions of a variety of enzymes related to peptidoglycan metabolism, including S. aureus PBP4, Streptocococcus pneumoniae PBP3, Streptomyces K15 Dtranspeptidase, Escherichia coli PBP5, and TEM-1 β-lactamase. In S. aureus PBP4 [25] and Streptococcus pneumoniae
PBP3 [26] (1TVF and 1XP4, respectively), the homologous sequences comprise a lobe of four surface exposed αhelices as part of the N-terminal, D,D carboxypeptidaselike domain. These helices are positioned on the back side
of the active site cleft of the respective enzymes and perhaps participate in protein-protein interactions that contribute to the formation of peptidoglycan biosynthetic
complexes.
The family 1a sequences are characterized by the presence
of an additional region of sequence homology which is
unique to these proteins. Amongst the residues that comprise the consensus motif (motif III) identified within this
segment are two of the relatively rare tryptophan residues

Distribution of consensus sequence motifs within the three families of Ape proteins
Distribution of consensus sequence motifs within the three families of Ape proteins. The motifs of the family 1
Apes are colour coded, and the asterisks denote the locations of the catalytic serine and aspartyl/histidyl residues of motifs I
and VII, respectively. The numbers at the beginning of each sequence denote the length of the respective N-terminal
sequences.

present in these proteins. This segment may thus contribute to the proteins binding specificity given the prominent
role that tryptophanyl residues play in the binding subsites of carbohydrate-active enzymes through stacking
interactions.
The sequences of the family 2 Ape proteins are highly
homologous (Fig. 7) and, like the family 1a proteins, are
characterized by having five distinct segments of high similarity separating the proposed catalytic motifs I and VII
(Fig. 7). However, the consensus motifs identified are
unique to this family (Fig. 7). Whereas the GDS(H/F)
sequence is conserved in motif I, the conserved residues
separating the catalytic D and H of consensus motif VII are
distinctively G and I/V. As with the family 1 proteins, the
family 2 sequences are encoded within the genomes of a
number of important human pathogens, such as species
of Neisseria, Campylobacter and Helicobacter.
The family 3 proteins have very little in common with
either the family 1 or family 2 proteins (Fig. 6). In fact, the
GDS(H/F) motif is replaced with G(T/S)S and there does
not appear to be any consensus in residues separating the

catalytic D and H residues of motif VII (Fig. 8). Whereas
two other segments of some similarity are present
between the catalytic motifs, there is a large region with
minimal sequence similarity. This variation seen within
the grouping suggests that further division of this family
may occur once more genome sequences become available. Nonetheless, again this family does include
sequences from some important pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori and Bacillus anthracis.
Predicted cellular localization of Ape
The SignalP, PSORT and DAS prediction programs indicated that almost all of the hypothetical Pat and Ape protein sequences have an N-terminal localization signal. The
only exception appears to be with the Ape sequence from
H. hepaticus. Family 1 proteins from H. hepaticus, P. luminescnes, Z. mobilis and P. gingivalis may have a cytoplasmic
membrane association due to the retention of an α-helical
transmembrane anchor. However, the other Ape1
sequences contain a predicted signal peptidase I cleavage
site that should release the expressed proteins from the
cytoplasmic membrane. In the case of the Ape2
homologs, the Campylobacter sp. and P. luminescens

Sequence alignment of family 2 O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterases (Ape2) and identification of consensus motifs.
The residues in bold face and yellow highlight denote greater than 50% and 80% identity, respectively, while those in red are
invariant amongst all sequences. The numbers in brackets denote the length of intervening sequences and the potential catalytic residues are identified with the red asterisks. Abbreviations (accession numbers): Ng, N. gonorrhoeae (AAW89271); Nm, N.
meningitidis (NP284201); Cv, Chromobacterium violaceum (NP903735); Pl, Photorhabdus luminescens (NP927854); Cj, Campylobacter

sequences are predicted to associate with the cytoplasmic
membrane, while the Neisseria sp. and C. violaceum proteins would be cleaved by signal peptidase I releasing
them to the periplasm. The family 3 Ape from H. pylori is
also predicted to remain associated with the cytoplasmic
membrane. These predictions are thus consistent with the
proposed function of the expressed proteins as participating in the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan as a maturation
event occurring within the periplasm [5].
Genomic organization of the OAP cluster
Despite their distant phylogenic relationship, the patA
and ape genes are closely associated on respective chromo-

somes and comprise a small cluster we have called Oacetylpeptidoglycan (OAP) (Fig. 3). However, different
gene organizations were observed which appear to be
specified by the type of ape genes present. Thus, species
containing the Ape1a proteins possess the strict gene
order of pat immediately followed by ape2 and then ape1a.
In contrast, the ape1b gene always appears to be located
upstream of pat, sometimes with the addition of an intervening ape1c gene. The only ape2 not located downstream
of pat is found in Zymomonas mobilis where instead it is
positioned upstream together with an ape1b gene. All of
the other ape1b genes are situated at the start of the OAP
cluster and are followed in order by an ape1c and then pat.

Figure 8 alignment of family 3 O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterases (Ape3) and identification of consensus motifs
Sequence
Sequence alignment of family 3 O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterases (Ape3) and identification of consensus motifs.
The residues in bold face and yellow highlight denote greater than 50% and 80% identity, respectively, while those in red are
invariant amongst all sequences. The numbers in brackets denote the length of intervening sequences and the potential catalytic residues are identified with the red asterisks. Abbreviations (accession numbers): Hp, Helicobacter pylori (NP207650); Bj,
Bradyrhizobium japonicum (NP767014); Gv, Gloeobacter violaceus (NP923892); Ba, Bacillus anthracis (NP843402); Bc, B. cereus
(NP977300).

Interestingly, the family 3 Ape appears to be capable of
replacing the function(s) of both the family 1 and 2 proteins because its gene is situated alone immediately downstream of pat. Thus, this gene arrangement more closely
resembles that of distantly related organisms like Bacillus
anthracis, Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Gloeobacter violaceus than that of H. hepaticus.
Extent of peptidoglycan O-acetylation in Pat- and Apeproducing bacteria
With the exception of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, none of
the bacteria listed in Fig. 3 are xylanolytic suggesting that
the discovered genes may be used by the respective bacteria for the modification of their peptidoglycans as proposed for N. gonorrhoeae. However, of these listed
bacteria, only N. gonorrhoeae was previously known to Oacetylate its peptidoglycan [5,6,27]. Hence, we investi-

gated the presence of this modification in a selection of
the bacteria possessing the OAP cluster of genes.
Following the isolation and purification of the peptidoglycans from cultures of the respective cells grown to late
exponential phase, the quantification of base-labile, esterlinked acetate was determined by the HPLC-based
method previously described [27]. Of the nine species
tested, eight were found to possess O-acetylated peptidoglycan (Table 1). The levels of this O-acetylation were not
stoichiometric, consistent with previous observations
made with each of the other known bacteria that modify
their peptidoglycan in this manner [5,6,27]. Thus, the
extent of O-acetylation ranged from 14.7 % to 65.6 % relative to muramic acid content. These data thus provide
preliminary support for the ascribed function of the OAP
cluster of genes for the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan.

With A. tumefaciens, only minimal levels of peptidoglycan
O-acetylation were detected suggesting that the "Ape" proteins produced by this xylanolytic bacterium may function as authentic xylan esterases. Alternatively,
environmental signals may be required by this plant pathogen to induce the O-acetylation of its peptidoglycan.

Conclusion
A new cluster of genes putatively involved in regulating Olinked acetate levels has been identified in a number of
bacteria. These O-acetylpeptidoglycan clusters all consist
of an O-acetyltransferase and at least one O-acetyl esterase. The O-acetyltransferases demonstrate high amino
acid similarity to members of the MBOAT family of acetyltransferases [24] while the O-acetyl esterases share
similarity to the CAZy family 3 esterases (CE3). The previously recognized members of family CE3 are all acetyl
xylan esterases; no de-N-acetyltransferases belong to this
family. Acetyl xylan esterases aid in the degradation of
xylan by removing the blocking O-linked acetate and
thereby permitting its subsequent hydrolysis by xylanases
(reviewed in [9]). As many of the bacteria identified with
these O-acetyl esterases are not xylanolytic and their
genomes do not appear to encode xylanases, we postulated that these hypothetical esterases function on peptidoglycan to specifically catalyze de-O-acetylation.
Consequently, they have been termed Ape proteins for
their hypothetical O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterase activity.
Recognition of different domain structures for each of the
Ape proteins prompted us to divide them into three distinct families. Of the families, only Ape3 appears to lack a
clear conserved domain structure and this may represent a
group that needs more members to permit its definitive
subdivision. However, each of the bacteria possessing an
Ape3 protein contain the unique cluster order of an O-

acetyltransferase followed by a single O-acetyl esterase.
The other Ape proteins are associated with an O-acetyltransferase, but always seem to be found in pairs consisting of Ape1b and Ape1c or Ape1a/1b and an Ape2. This
ORF organization may translate into the evolutionary
development of the Ape families. In fact, evolutionary
divergence seems plausible for the Ape1 and Ape2 proteins, where duplication of an Ape1a/1b protein and
divergence into an entirely new protein could have easily
occurred. However, the ORF organization in Helicobacter
species makes this theory far more confounded. Alternatively, differences between the Ape families may be linked
to separate cellular functions. Some of the Ape proteins,
especially those associated with either the cytoplasmic
membrane and cytoplasm, may be involved in peptidoglycan recycling, while those in the periplasm and/or outer
membrane of the gram-negative bacteria may be involved
in the general maintenance of the peptidoglycan sacculus.
Regardless of their specific role in peptidoglycan metabolism, the activity of Ape proteins would be essential for the
removal of acetate which would otherwise preclude the
lysis of peptidoglycan by endogenous enzymes. Indeed,
the major lytic enzymes associated with both the biosynthesis and maintenance of peptidoglycan are the lytic
transglycosylases, enzymes that require a free C-6
hydroxyl group on muramoyl residues to produce their
1,6-anhydro product. Given that the bacteria harboring
genes apparently involved with this activity were demonstrated to produce O-acetylated peptidoglycan, Ape activity would be required to function in advance of the lytic
transglycosylase, many of which act processively along
peptidoglycan strands [1], to provide appropriate sites for
cleavage. Although strictly conjecture at this point, it is
likely that these Ape proteins would be associated with the
peptidoglycan 'replicase' holoenzyme complexes [1]

which have been shown to include both the lytic transglycosylases and penicillin-binding proteins [28-30]. In this
regard, it should be noted that many of the ape genes are
in close proximity to other genes encoding enzymes
involved in cell wall associated functions. For example,
the three Campylobacter sp. contain a ferritin gene (cft and
pfr) immediately upstream, while both C. coli and C. upsaliens also possess genes encoding a potential ABC transporter and an outer membrane protein directly
downstream of the OAP cluster. Similarly, both Bacteroides sp. encode a putative cation-efflux transporter
upstream of their OAP clusters, while the Z. mobilis chromosome encodes a nearby cell wall hydrolase. Hence,
through a dynamic process of removal and attachment of
O-acetate, the bacteria would be able to obtain a high
level of localized control over the degradation of peptidoglycan. This would facilitate, for example, the efficient
insertion of pores and flagella, localize spore formation,
and control the level of general peptidoglycan turnover.
It is difficult to determine whether or not a correlation
exists between O-acetylation levels and the type or
number of O-acetyl esterases present in a particular organism. In the case of the Ape1b/1c and Ape3 this may be
because so few organisms have been tested for peptidoglycan O-acetylation. However, even Neisseria sp., C. violaceum, and the Campylobacter sp., which all possess Ape1a
and Ape2, contain O-acetylation levels that vary significantly. This suggests that the level of O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterase activity may be regulated by
compartmentalization or at the level of transcription/
translation. The Ape family 1a/1b proteins are different
from the Ape1c proteins due to the presence of an extra
amino acid segment. The variation in each of these segments raises questions of substrate specificity and function that must be proven, but it is interesting to note that
one of the segments has partial similarity to PBP 4, a D,D
carboxypeptidase. These proteins are peptidoglycan maintenance proteins, and therefore suggest that the extra protein segment found in the Ape1a/b proteins may be a
peptidoglycan specific fragment or one directing proteinprotein interactions. This would certainly explain its
absence from the O-acetylxylan esterase CE3 family, but
not necessarily from the other Ape families.
Two models of peptidoglycan O-acetylation have been
proposed in a recent review [6]. The first model involves
the sequential action of two proteins. The first protein
would be located within the cytoplasmic membrane and
facilitates the transfer of acetate from acetyl-CoA to the
periplasm, where a second protein accepts the acetate and
attaches it to peptidoglycan. The second model consists of
a single membrane bound O-acetyltransferase that performs both the transport of acetate across the cytoplasmic
membrane and the peptidoglycan O-acetylation steps. A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/49

peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase recently identified in S.
aureus [17] is expected to act by the second peptidoglycan
O-acetylation pathway. This O-acetyltransferase bears no
resemblance to the O-acetyltransferases identified in the
present study. This strongly suggests that, as with the Oacetyl esterases together with the lytic transglycosylases
[31] and the PBPs [32], different classes of peptidoglycan
O-acetyltransferases exist.
In summary, experiments are still required to conclusively
demonstrate that the O-acetyltransferases and Ape proteins identified in this study are actually involved in controlling peptidoglycan O-acetylation. However, it is
important to note that all the organisms that demonstrated some level of peptidoglycan O-acetylation also
contain the putative O-acetylation cluster. Verification of
peptidoglycan O-acetylation in the other bacteria containing the O-acetylation cluster are in progress, and should
further strengthen the link between these two events. In
addition, experiments characterizing the gene product of
N. gonorrhoeae Ape1a have been initiated and preliminary
evidence supports its function as an O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterase.

Methods
Chemicals and reagents
DNase I, RNase A, and pronase were purchased from
Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Laval, PQ), while Fisher
Scientific (Nepean, ON), provided Luria Bertani (LB)

were both cultured in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) for 48 h at
ambient temperature with shaking (200 rpm) while Bacillus cereus was grown in Penassay Broth as previously
described [33]. Chromobacterium violaceum was cultured in
LB broth with shaking (200 rpm) for 48 h at ambient temperature. Bacteroides fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were
grown at 37°C under strict anaerobic conditions using
Bacteroides Bile Esculin Broth (BBE) supplemented with
100 mg/mL gentamicin while Ruminococcus flavefaciens
was cultured anaerobically using Dehority's Complete

Peptidoglycan isolation and determination of extent of Oacetylation
O-Acetylated peptidoglycan was isolated and purified
from the various bacteria, taking the necessary precautions to prevent the facile hydrolysis of O-acetyl groups as
previously described [36]. Quantification of O-acetyl content was performed by both the HPLC-based organic acid
analysis using an Aminex HPX-87H Bio-Rad column as
previously described [27] and using the Megazyme Acetic
Acid Assay kit (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd.,
Wicklow, Ireland). The extent of O-acetylation is presented as a percentage of muramic acid content as determined by quantitative aminosugar analysis [37].
Identification and genomic analysis of a putative cluster of
peptidoglycan O-acetylation ORFs
The raw nucleotide sequence data of the N. gonorrhoeae
FA1090 genome project [18] was searched for hypothetical proteins involved in acetate transport using the Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein sequence for AlgI as the probe
(algI encodes a putative acetate translocator involved with
the biosynthesis of alginate [14,15]). Identification of
open reading frames, protein translations, and isoelectric
points (pI) were performed using Clone Manager 5. Signal
sequence and cellular localization predictions were performed using signalP version 3 [38], PSORT [39], and the
DAS Transmembrane Prediction Server [40]. Searches for
homologs to the characterized N. gonorrhoeae ORFs in the
NCBI database were carried out using the BLASTP search
engine to tentatively identify functions for each of the
ORFs in the cluster[41]. Sequences with an (E) value
threshold of 1e-06 were used to generate multiple alignments using ClustalW Version 1.8 software [42]. Manual
correction of these alignments was performed based on
the original BLASTP results in conjunction with the
MEME/ MAST Version 3.0 motif discovery tool [43]. Predictions of secondary structure were performed using the
GOR IV Secondary Structure Prediction method [44] and
PSI PRED [45], while searches for known domains were
performed using CD-Search [46] at NCBI.
