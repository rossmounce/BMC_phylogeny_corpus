Abstract
Background: CpG islands (CGIs), clusters of CpG dinucleotides in GC-rich regions, are often
located in the 5' end of genes and considered gene markers. Hackenberg et al. (2006) recently
developed a new algorithm, CpGcluster, which uses a completely different mathematical approach
from previous traditional algorithms. Their evaluation suggests that CpGcluster provides a much
more efficient approach to detecting functional clusters or islands of CpGs.
Results: We systematically compared CpGcluster with the traditional algorithm by Takai and
Jones (2002). Our comparisons of (1) the number of islands versus the number of genes in a
genome, (2) the distribution of islands in different genomic regions, (3) island length, (4) the
distance between two neighboring islands, and (5) methylation status suggest that Takai and Jones'
algorithm is overall more appropriate for identifying promoter-associated islands of CpGs in
vertebrate genomes.
Conclusion: The generation of genome sequence and DNA methylation data is expected to
accelerate greatly. The information in this study is important for its extensive utility in gene feature
analysis and epigenomics including gene prediction and methylation chip design in different
genomes.

Background
CpG islands (CGIs) are clusters of CpG dinucleotides in
GC-rich regions. They are often associated with the 5' end
of genes and considered gene markers [1]. Methylation of
promoter-associated CGIs plays an important role in gene
regulation and carcinogenesis. Because of the functional
importance, multiple algorithms have been available for
identifying CGIs in a sequence. Traditional algorithms are
based on three sequence parameters (length, GC content,
and ratio of the observed over the expected CpGs

(ObsCpG/ExpCpG)) that were originally proposed by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer in 1987 [2] and later revised
by Takai and Jones [3] and others. These algorithms have
been widely used in the identification of CGIs in numerous studies. Among these algorithms, Takai and Jones' [3]
stringent algorithm seems to outperform the others
because it can effectively exclude short interspersed elements such as Alu and it can identify CGIs that are more
likely associated with the 5' regions of genes [3].

Recently, Hackenberg et al. [4] developed a new algorithm, namely CpGcluster. CpGcluster does not employ
the three parameters typically used in traditional algorithms, rather, it detects clusters of CpGs (i.e., CpG clusters) by statistical significance based on the physical
distance between neighboring CpGs on a chromosome
[4]. To save the space and to compare the CGIs by Takai
and Jones' algorithm, we abbreviate CpG clusters as
"CGCs" hereafter. Both CGIs and CGCs represent the
islands of CpGs in a genome. Their evaluation claimed a
better performance of CpGcluster due to its better benchmark, minimal overlap with Alu, and higher degree of
overlap with promoter and phylogenetic conserved elements. Here we performed an extensive evaluation of the
two algorithms (Takai and Jones' algorithm and CpGcluster) in two model organisms (human and mouse) and
demonstrated that Takai and Jones' algorithm has an
overall better performance in the identification of CGIs in
vertebrate genomes.

Results and discussion
CGIs versus CGCs: statistics in the human and mouse
genomes
Table 1 shows the statistics of CGIs by Takai and Jones'
algorithm and CGCs by CpGcluster in the human and
mouse genomes. The number of CGCs is remarkably
larger than that of CGIs. In the human genome, there are
198,702 CGCs, 5.3 times the number of CGIs (37,729).
Similarly, in the mouse genome, the number of CGCs
(121,885) is 5.7 times that of CGIs (21,326). The characteristics of CGIs and CGCs are different too. On average,
CGIs are much longer than CGCs. In the human genome,

CGIs have an average length of 1,090 bp, while CGCs
have an average length of only 273 bp. A similar large difference was observed in the mouse genome (1,045 versus
318 bp). This large difference is mainly due to CpGcluster's independence on the minimum length of a cluster.
Contrast to the length, CGCs have on average a higher GC
content and ObsCpG/ExpCpG ratio than CGIs (Table 1),
reflecting that CpGcluster tends to select shorter but CpGricher regions.
CGIs versus CGCs: evaluation on gene markers
The main interest in finding islands of CpGs is that they
may serve as gene markers [1]. Mammalian genomes have
similar sizes (2.0 – 3.0 Gb) and similar numbers of annotated genes (20,000 – 30,000) [5]. Surprisingly, the
number of CGCs in the human genome is ~8 times that of
human genes and the number of mouse CGCs is ~4 times
that of mouse genes. In contrast to the CGCs, the total
number of human CGIs (37,729) is moderately larger
than the number of human genes and the total number of
mouse CGIs (21,326) is even in the low range of the estimated number of mouse genes. It is worth noting that the
mouse genome has undergone faster CGI loss than the
human during genome evolution [6], thus, we observed a
smaller number in the mouse genome by both algorithms.

We then examined the distribution of CGIs or CGCs in
different genomic regions including promoter, genic and
intergenic regions (see Methods). Among the 37,729
human CGIs, 35.0% were mapped to the promoter
regions. However, only 14.7% of the 198,702 human

It is interesting to examine the short CGCs identified by
CpGcluster. The shortest CGCs were found to be 8 bp in
both the human and mouse genomes. For the 8-bp CGCs,
we counted a total of 232 times in humans and 775 times
in mice. Hackenberg et al. suggested that the very short
islands might be functional because they likely overlap
with the promoter regions. However, even this is true, we
found only few short CGCs (12 counts of human 8-bp
CGCs, 5.2%; 13 counts of mouse 8-bp CGCs, 1.7%) are
located in the promoter regions. In fact, the majority of
them are in the intergenic regions (Table 1). Furthermore,
we found all these 8-bp CGCs are octamer CGCGCGCG.
Our preliminary search in the TRANSFAC and JASPAR
databases indicates that this octamer is rarely part of the
regulatory motifs. Similar distribution was observed for
CGCs whose length is ≤ 50 bp (data not shown). These
results indicate that short CGCs may not serve as markers
for genes.
CGIs versus CGCs: length distribution
The main difference between the two algorithms is that
Takai and Jones' algorithm requires a minimal length but
CpGcluster does not. The shortest CGCs have only 8 bp
compared to the minimum length of 500 bp by Takai and
Jones' algorithm. Here we compared the length distribution of CGCs and CGIs in the human and mouse
genomes. As expected, the length distribution of the two
algorithms is remarkably different. In humans, most
CGCs are in a range of 50 – 400 bp long (83.6%), while
only 9.8% of CGCs are longer than 500 bp. For those long
CGCs (≥ 500 bp), their number distribution is not
strongly different from that of CGIs (Additional file 1).

Ioshikhes and Zhang [7] found that the CGIs overlapping
with TSS are much longer than those outside the gene
environment. A similar pattern was observed for CGCs
[4]. Here we examined and compared the length distribution for promoter-associated CGCs and intergenic CGCs.
When CGCs are shorter than 300 bp in the human
genome and 400 bp in the mouse genome, the proportion
of promoter-associated CGCs is smaller than that of intergenic CGCs, indicating that those short CGCs are more
likely in the intergenic regions rather than in the promoter
regions (Figure 1B, Additional file 1). Conversely, when

CGCs were mapped to the promoter regions (Table 1).
Similarly, we found 51.3% of mouse CGIs but only 16.2%

a similar observation when we examined the coverage of
islands of CpGs with the transcriptional start sites (TSSs).
For example, we observed 40.0% of the human CGIs but
only 10.9% of human CGCs covering TSSs (Table 1).
Most human CGCs (85.3%) are located outside of the
promoter regions and about half are in the intergenic
regions.

the length is > 500 bp, the proportion of promoter-associated CGCs is noticeably larger than that of intergenic
CGCs in both the genomes. The result indicates that the
length is an important factor in identifying islands of
CpGs that are associated with the promoter regions and,
thus, effectively reducing the false positives.
Multiple CGCs or CGIs in a promoter region
Because the number of CGCs is remarkably larger than
that of genes in both the human and mouse genomes, it is
necessary to examine whether multiple CGCs or CGIs are
located in a genic or promoter region. Among the 24,810
human genes extracted from the NCBI Refseq database,
we found that 9,387 (37.8%) have more than 1 CGC but
only 781 (3.2%) have more than 1 CGI. This strong difference was similarly found in the mouse genome (17.4%
versus 1.4%).

Our further examination revealed that many promoterassociated CGCs are short and "clustered" with short gaps
at a locus. In some extreme cases, we found 5–10 CGCs in
a promoter region. Figure 2 shows two examples: CAP1
and ADAM33. CAP1, a 32-kb long gene, has five CGCs
that lie within its promoter region, but has only one CGI
(1,897 bp) identified by Takai and Jones' algorithm. These
five CGCs are embedded in that CGI, separated by 52, 41,
96 and 48 bp, respectively (Figure 2A). For ADAM33, a 14kb long gene, we identified five CGCs that lie within or
overlap with its promoter region where only one CGI
(1,065 bp) was identified (Figure 2B). Three of these
CGCs (CGC3, CGC4 and CGC5) are nearly embedded in
the CGI. The other two CGCs (CGC1: 65 bp and CGC2:
110 bp) locate in the upstream of the CGI. Interestingly,
both CGC1 and CGC2 are overall within an Alu element
(AluSc), which supports that Takai and Jones' algorithm
could effectively exclude the repeats. This reflects that
CpGcluster tends to identify small parts of CpG islands
and, therefore, results in a substantially inflated number
of short CGCs.
We next examined the distance (gap length) between two
neighboring CGCs in the promoter regions. Among promoter-associated CGCs, 58.3% of them have distance
<100 bp in the human genome; this proportion is 57.2%
in the mouse (Figure 3). Moreover, 26.1% of human
CGCs and 26.7% of mouse CGCs are separated more than
200 bp. Of note, Takai and Jones' algorithm requires CGIs
to be separated at least 100 bp, otherwise they would be
merged [3]. When the distance is >100 bp, the proportions are similar in these two genomes (Figure 3). Further-

more, we found similar distribution of distance between
two neighboring CGCs in the promoter regions of
human-mouse homologous genes (Additional file 2).
This again suggests that the length is an important factor.
CGIs versus CGCs: evaluation on methylation status in the
promoter regions
Functional GC-rich regions are often unmethylated,
which is an important feature in the regulation of gene
expression. Ideally, a computationally identified CGI or
CGC is associated with a promoter region that is unmethylated or hypomethylated. To evaluate the performance of
these two algorithms on predicting islands of CpGs that
are unmethylated or hypomethylated, we obtained 7,684
genes with methylation status in their promoter regions
from Weber et al. [8]. We calculated sensitivity, specificity,
accuracy and correlation coefficient (see Methods).
Although CpGcluster has a slightly better sensitivity
(CGCs: 0.96; CGIs: 0.93) and accuracy (CGCs: 0.91; CGIs:
0.90), its specificity (0.42) is noticeably lower than that
(0.62) of Takai and Jones' algorithm. When all factors
combined, we found a larger correlation coefficient by
Takai and Jones' algorithm (0.48) than CpGcluster (0.40).

Conclusion
In this study, we systematically compared two representative algorithms: Takai and Jones' algorithm and the distance-based algorithm aiming for identifying functional
CpG clusters. Our comparison of the number of islands
versus the number of genes in a genome, the distribution
of islands in different genomic regions, the length distribution, the distance between two neighboring islands in

the promoter regions, and methylation status suggests
that Takai and Jones' algorithm is overall more appropriate for identifying promoter-associated islands of CpGs.
Although CpGcluster can uniquely identify some short
CpG clusters that are functional, its high false positive rate
strongly limits its utility in genome-wide or chromosomewide searching promoter-associated CpG clusters in vertebrate genomes. Since CpG islands represent an important
gene feature and are expected to be used extensively in
gene prediction, gene feature analysis, and epigenetic and
epigenomic projects, the information in our study is fundamental.

Methylation status of CGIs/CGCs in the promoter regions
Weber et al. [8] recently examined and measured methylation status of ~16,000 promoters in human WI38 primary lung fibroblast. They defined a promoter being
hypermethylated when its 5 mC log2 ratio was >0.4, otherwise hypomethylated. We used this dataset to evaluate
methylation status of CGIs/CGCs in the promoter
regions. We identified 7,684 genes with methylation status in their promoter regions including 697 hypermethylated and 6,987 hypomethylated promoters.

To evaluate the performances of two algorithms on predicting functional islands or clusters, we examined the
methylation status in promoter-associated CGIs or CGCs.
We calculated the sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), accuracy (Ac) and correlation coefficient (Cc). The equations
are:
Sn = TP/(TP + FN)

(1)

Sp = TN/(TN + FP)

(2)

Ac = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)

(3)

Methods
Identification of CGIs and CGCs
We used the stringent criteria in Takai and Jones [3] to
search CGIs: length ≥ 500 bp, GC content ≥ 55% and
ObsCpG/ExpCpG ≥ 0.65. We used default cutoffs in CpGcluster in Hackenberg et al. [4] to search CGCs: the
median distance and P-value = 10-5.
Genome sequences and gene annotations
We downloaded the assembled human and mouse
genome sequences and their gene annotation files from
the NCBI database (human build 36, mouse build 37) [9].
A gene may have more than one transcript. We determined the location of gene's TSS based on the transcript
that extends towards 5' most to avoid the influence of
other genic environment. Hackenberg et al. examined the
CGIs or CGCs that overlapped with the TSS. However,
mammalian genes tend to initiate transcription at multiple alternative start sites across a region, rather than a single well-defined site [10]. Thus, in this study we examined
the CGIs or CGCs that lie within or overlap with the promoter regions. A promoter region was defined -1,500 to +
500 bp around the TSS. Separately, we obtained 563,593

Cc = ( ( TP × TN ) − ( FN × FP ) ) /

( TP + FN ) × ( TN + FP ) × ( TP + FP ) × ( TN + FN )

(4)
where TP are true positives (hypomethylated promoters
containing CGIs or CGCs); TN are true negatives (hypermethylated promoters without detecting CGIs or CGCs);
FP are false positives (hypermethylated promoters containing CGIs or CGCs); and FN are false negatives
(hypomethylated promoters without detecting CGIs or
CGCs).
