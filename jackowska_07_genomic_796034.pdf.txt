Abstract
Background: Recent genome sequence analysis in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum
indicated that this highly crepuscular animal encodes only two single opsin paralogs: a UV-opsin and
a long wavelength (LW)-opsin; however, these animals do not encode a blue (B)-opsin as most
other insects. Here, we studied the spatial regulation of the Tribolium single LW- and UV-opsin gene
paralogs in comparison to that of the five opsin paralogs in the retina of Drosophila melanogaster.
Results: In situ hybridization analysis reveals that the Tribolium retina, in contrast with other insect
retinas, constitutes a homogenous field of ommatidia that have seven LW-opsin expressing
photoreceptors and one UV-/LW-opsin co-expressing photoreceptor per eye unit. This pattern is
consistent with the loss of photoreceptors sensitive to blue wavelengths. It also identifies Tribolium
as the first example of a species in insects that co-expresses two different opsins across the entire
retina in violation of the widely observed "one receptor rule" of sensory cells.
Conclusion: Broader studies of opsin evolution in darkling beetles and other coleopteran groups
have the potential to pinpoint the permissive and adaptive forces that played a role in the evolution
of vision in Tribolium castaneum.

Introduction
Photon absorption by visual pigments is the primary
event in the conversion of light to a neuronal signal in animal photoreceptor cells [1]. Visual pigments or rhodopsins form by an association of retinal-based
chromophores with a special class of G-protein-coupled
seven transmembrane receptor proteins (GPCRs). These
GPCRs are encoded by a diverse group of opsin gene family paralogs. Most insects encode members of three different opsin subfamilies. Ultraviolet (UV) and blue (B)
opsins correlate with maximal photoreceptor sensitivities
in the 300–400 and 400–500 nm ranges respectively.
Long wavelength (LW) opsin-expressing photoreceptors
show sensitivities that range between 480 and 600 nm [24]. The differential expression of these diverged opsin paralogs in the photoreceptors of individual eye units
(ommatidia) within the compound eye is a structural prerequisite for color discrimination by insects. Moreover,
differential opsin expression can correlate with cellular
specialization in color and brightness detection in insects.
In Drosophila, brightness is measured from the input of six
peripheral LW-opsin expressing photoreceptors (R1–R6),
which project into the first optic neuropil, the lamina.
Color vision is facilitated by the central photoreceptors R7
and R8 that express one of the UV-, B-, or LW-opsins and
have long axonal projections that synapse into the second
optic neuropil, the medulla (Fig. 1) (for review see [4-6]).
The existence of UV-, B- and LW-sensitive photoreceptors
in primitive insects implies that trichromatic vision is
ancient and highly conserved [2]. Consistent with this,
recent genome sequencing projects identified UV-, B- and
LW-opsin gene family paralogs in diverse endopterygote
insects including silkmoth, mosquito and honeybee [7].
Remarkably, only two opsin gene orthologs representing
members of the LW- and UV-opsin groups were detected
in the genome of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum,
suggesting the loss of B-opsin during the evolution of this
species [7,8] (Bao, Friedrich, in preparation). Like darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae) in general, the stored grain
pest Tribolium castaneum is highly secretive and avoids
broad daylight: all postembryonic life cycle stages hide in
tunnels driven through the food substrate [9,10]. The dramatic increase of chemoreceptor genes, compared to diurnal species like honeybee and Drosophila, suggests a strong
adaptive effect of Tribolium's cryptozoic ecology on its
genome and neurobiology [8]. Thus, it is conceivable that
a relaxation of color discrimination requirements allowed
for the loss of B-opsin in Tribolium. However, there are
also examples of trichromatic dark active insect species
like the tobacco hornworm moth Manduca sexta [11].
The highly regulated spatial expression of opsin paralogs
in Drosophila (Fig. 1) and other endopterygote species
allows specific predictions regarding the expression of the

remaining two opsin paralogs in Tribolium if B-opsin is
missing [5,12]. That is, in the absence of B-opsin, the
ancestral B-opsin expression niche in a fraction of the central R7 and R8 cells should be replenished by either UVor LW-expression. By examining the expression patterns
of the identified LW- and UV-opsin genes in the Tribolium
retina, we sought to answer if the spatial regulation of
these genes was consistent with a loss of B-opsin, and if so,
which specific changes in the regulation of either LW- or
UV-opsin expression would be associated with it.

Results
Each Tribolium ommatidium contains eight photoreceptors, each of which is unambiguously related to one of the
photoreceptor subtypes R1–R8 of Drosophila by position,
rhabdomere structure and ontogenetic origin [13]. We
therefore compared the spatial distribution of Drosophila

UV- and LW-opsins detected by immunohistochemistry
with Tribolium UV- and LW-opsin as detected by in situ
hybridization (Fig. 2 and data not shown).
Spatial regulation of the expression of the Tribolium UV
opsin gene
We first investigated the expression of Tribolium UV-opsin.
To generate a Tribolium UV-opsin RNA probe for whole
mount in situ hybridization, we cloned a 502 bp fragment
of the predicted Tribolium UV-opsin gene. In Drosophila,
the UV-opsin paralogs Rh3 and Rh4 are stochastically distributed in non-overlapping patterns in all central R7 photoreceptor cells (Fig. 1, Fig 2a and 2b) [14,15]. Similarly,
in situ hybridization experiments with an RNA antisense

probe against Tribolium UV-opsin in mature pupal and
early adult retina detected strong expression in a single
photoreceptor cell per ommatidia throughout the entire
retinal field (Fig. 2d). Differential interference contrast
microscopy at high magnification confirmed that the Tribolium UV-opsin paralog was selectively expressed in all
R7-type cells (Fig. 2e). The comparison with Drosophila
thus revealed that Tribolium UV-opsin is expressed in a
conserved R7-specific manner.
Spatial regulation of the expression of Tribolium LWopsin gene
Next we investigated the expression of Tribolium LWopsin. In Drosophila, the peripheral photoreceptors R1-6

express the LW-opsin paralog Rh1 (Fig. 2e and 2f), and
70% of central R8 cells express the LW-opsin Rh6 [16].
The remaining 30% of R8 cells express the Drosophila Bopsin paralog Rh5 [17,18]. For whole mount in situ
hybridization in Tribolium, we cloned a 972 bp long RTPCR fragment that includes the entire predicted Tribolium
LW-opsin ORF from head specific Tribolium total RNA.
Analysis of the expression of the single Tribolium LWopsin gene revealed uniform transcription in all photoreceptors of the retina (Fig. 2g). Importantly, expression was
not only detected in the peripheral photoreceptors, but
also in all central R7 and R8 photoreceptors (Fig. 2h). This
finding reveals a strongly expanded expression domain of
LW-opsin compared to Drosophila, and indicates that R7
cells in Tribolium co-express the LW and UV-opsin-encoding genes.

cal data converge on supporting the loss of B-opsin in
Tribolium castaneum.

Like in most insects, ommatidia in the dorsal rim area
(DRA) of the Drosophila compound eye exhibit modifications for the detection of polarized light including expression of UV-opsin in both R7 and R8 [19,20]. However, no
evidence of regional heterogeneity of opsin expression
could be detected in the dorsal region of the Tribolium retina (Fig. 2c and 2g), consistent with the lack of morphological evidence of DR ommatidia in this species [13].

A most accurate inference of the underlying mutational
events underlying the Tribolium opsin expression pattern
depends on knowing the organization of the retinal
mosaic in the last B-opsin expressing ancestor of Tribolium. Although this is still much a matter of speculation,
some conclusions can be drawn from physiological data
from other Coleoptera and opsin expression data in other
endopterygote orders. Based on electrophysiological studies, for instance, species in the beetle families Carabidae
(ground beetles) and Coccinelidae (lady beetles) are
equipped with sensitivities in the green, blue and UV
[22,23]. Considering further that B-, LW- and UV-opsins
are expressed in R7 and R8 cells in Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera, it is most likely that Tribolium
evolved from an ancestor in which R8 and R7 cells differentially expressed combinations of at least three opsins,
similar to Drosophila (Fig. 3) [5,11,24].

Discussion
Taken together, the new expression data described here
reveal a number of unique aspects of the Tribolium compound eye retina: (1) lack of B-opsin encoding photoreceptors, (2) homogeneous expression of a single LWopsin across the entire retina, and (3) co-expression of
UV- and LW-opsin in all R7 cells. These findings generate
questions regarding the evolutionary mechanisms, forces
and pathways that gave rise to the exceptional Tribolium
retinal mosaic.
Tribolium LW- and UV-opsin expression is consistent with
loss of B-opsin
The expression of the Tribolium LW- and UV-opsins
accounts for all photoreceptors in the Tribolium retina,
and is compatible with a loss of B-opsin in the flour beetle. This finding further cements evidence for color vision
reduction in the evolutionary lineage leading to Tribolium
(Fig. 3). Consistent with this, the spectral sensitivity of the
very closely related mealworm Tenebrio molitor has been
reported to peak only in the UV and green wavelength
ranges based on electroretinogram measurements [21].
Moreover, preliminary PCR screens from Tenebrio molitor
genomic DNA resulted in isolation of closely related
orthologs of Tribolium castaneum LW- and UV-opsins,
while similar attempts to isolate B-opsin orthologs failed,
just as in Tribolium castaneum (Bao and Friedrich, unpublished). Hence genome, gene expression and physiologi-

Loss of B-opsin expressing photoreceptors through
expansion of the LW-opsin expression domain: cisregulatory implications and possible trajectories
Our data reveal that the lack of B-opsin in Tribolium correlates with a dramatic expansion of LW-opsin expression.
In most endopterygote retinas studied so far, LW-opsins
are expressed in the peripheral photoreceptors R1-6 and a
fraction of central R7 or R8 cells (Fig. 3). Thus, the
expanded LW-opsin we observe in Tribolium is likely to
have played an essential role in the evolution of its retinal
mosaic. The comparative data further imply that these
changes involved the expansion of the peripheral LWopsin expression domain into R7 and R8.

Based on this premise, it is reasonable to assume that the
UV-opsin expression in R7 is a conserved aspect of the Tribolium retina, whereas the loss of B-opsin expression and
correlated expansion of LW-opsin expression is derived.
This latter change may have occurred through one of several possible trajectories (Fig. 4). First, the loss of B-opsin
expression could have been initiated through mutations
that abrogate transcriptional activation or expression of a
functional protein prior to or independent of changes in
the ancestral expression domain of LW-opsin (Fig. 4a).
However, this would create a retinal mosaic with partially
light-insensitive photoreceptor cells. Considering the
importance of flight in Tribolium (see below), the ensuing
deterioration of spatial vision would likely be a devastating fitness penalty. This suggests that the molecular evolution of B-opsin loss was correlated with, or contingent
upon, compensatory changes in the regulation of LWopsin, a second possibility (Fig. 4b).

colors indicate photoreceptor light specificities in either the UV (violet), blue or green wavelength range. Drosophila forms
eight photoreceptors per ommatidium. The peripheral photoreceptors R1-6 express a LW-opsin. 70% of the Drosophila
ommatidia are of the yellow type, in which the central R8 cell express a the LW-opsin paralog Rh6 and the central R7 cells the
UV-opsin Rh4. In the remaining pale-type ommatidia, the central R8 cell express the B-opsin Rh5 and the central R7 cells the
UV-opsin Rh3 (Fig. 1) [12]. Honeybee and tobacco hornworm moth develop nine photoreceptors per ommatium due to duplication of the R7 cell fate [52]. However, in both species only the two central R7-like more distally located cells exhibit differential opsin expression ranging from UV to LW sensitive opsins. The peripheral photoreceptor cell homologs R1-6 express
LW-opsin as does the proximally located central R8 cell homolog. Five different ommatidia types can be distinguished in the
tobacco hornworm moth retina, which differ by number of R7-like cells (1–2) or the combination of B- and UV-opsin expressing R-7 cells [12]. In the honeybee, six different ommatidia types occur which either express G-, UV- or B-opsin in both R7-like
cells or in any possible combination [24]. In Tribolium, LW-opsin is expressed in all photoreceptor cells. Co-expression of
LW- with UV-opsin in R7 is indicated by gradient from violet to green.

Figure trajectories of Tribolium retina evolution
Possible trajectories of Tribolium retina evolution. Schematic presentation of three mutation scenarios that could have
led from an ancestral trichromatic retina to the retinal mosaic of extant Tribolium castaneum. Colors indicate photoreceptor
light specificities as in Fig. 3. Numbers above arrows represent number of necessary mutation induced gene regulatory changes
underlying opsin expression pattern evolution. L stands for genomic loss of B-opsin. (a) Instantaneous B-opsin loss scenario. Bopsin loss without correlated or preceding expansion of other opsin expression domains is unlikely since it would result in a
fraction of light insensitive photoreceptor cells and thereby a substantial deterioration of the resolution of spatial vision (black).
Subsequent mutational steps that would lead to the Tribolium castaneum retinal mosaic are therefore just indicated with
increased opacity. Genomic B-opsin loss was more likely preceded by either gradual expansion of the LW-opsin expression
domain (b) or immediate maximum expansion of LW-opsin expression (c). See text for further details.

Several mechanisms exist regarding the nature of such cisregulatory changes in the B- and LW-opsin genes. Assuming heterogeneity of LW-opsin and B-opsin expression
among ancestral R8 cells, for instance, correlated mutations in the cis-regulatory regions of both genes may have
led to a gradual increase in the fraction of LW-opsin
expressing cells that eventually culminated in the complete replacement of B-opsin expressing cells. This scenario describes a model of gradual replacement of blue
versus green-sensitive photoreceptors in which color
vision evolves as a quantitative trait (Fig. 4b). Alternatively, cis-regulatory change may have resulted in immedi-

ate compensatory loss of B-opsin and expansion of LWopsin expression. This type of change could have been
induced by separate mutations in the cis-regulatory
regions of both genes or, as data from Drosophila suggest
(see below), through mutational change in the cis-regulation of only one opsin pending pre-existing mechanisms
of mutual repression. Both trajectories require at least one
additional regulatory change that would allow further
expansion of LW-opsin expression into R7 (Fig. 4b).
A third scenario is that a single mutation led to the immediate expansion of the LW-opsin expression into all pho-

toreceptor cells. The consequence would be that of coexpression of LW-opsin with B-opsin in a fraction of R8
cells, and with UV-opsin in R7 cells (Fig. 4c). Such a retinal mosaic would thus be one step away from that in
extant Tribolium by mutational disintegration of the activating elements in the ancestral B-opsin cis-regulatory
region. This pathway seems the most probable for three
reasons: (1) requiring only a single mutation to generate
the final LW-opsin pattern is most parsimonious, (2) the
co-expression of LW- and UV opsins in the R7 cells of Tribolium is consistent with this scenario, and (3) the latter
fact as well as data from other species (see below) demonstrates that opsin co-expressing photoreceptors are viable
and functional. Moreover, a strikingly similar scenario
exists in Drosophila, where a single point mutation in the
LW-opsin promoter, Rh6, or in the transcription factor,
Orthodenticle (Otd) leads to expansion of Rh6 (and coexpression of opsins) into the majority of peripheral photoreceptors and many R7 central photoreceptors, but not
into the B-opsin-containing R8 cells [25].
Possible mechanisms for LW-opsin expansion: lessons from
Drosophila
Molecular genetic analyses in Drosophila have unraveled
several critical mechanisms of cis-regulatory control of
opsin expression, some of which are likely conserved
[5,12]. Those particularly relevant to the discussion of the
evolution of the Tribolium retina involve studies on the
regulation of the LW-opsin-encoding gene, Rh6. Such
studies have demonstrated that at least four independent
transcriptional repression processes normally restrict Drosophila Rh6 to 70% central R8 photoreceptors. In R8 cells,
the mutually exclusive B- versus LW-opsin expression in
30 vs 70% R8 cells occurs through a bistable loop of both
cell signaling and transcriptional regulation [26]. Failure
to properly initiate this loop leads to a retina that
expresses all B-opsin or all LW-opsin genes in R8 cells.
Interestingly, LW-opsin expression is the "default" R8
opsin state, whereas B-opsin requires induction. Thus, this
regulatory mechanism could reflect that the loss of Bopsin observed in Tribolium is secondary to a loss in this
induction process. This regulatory mechanism also suggests an inherent capacity of the photoreceptor mosaic in
higher flies to evolve along the gradual replacement
model considered for Tribolium above. Second, Drosophila
express two LW-opsins: Rh1 in peripheral non-color sensitive photoreceptors, R1-R6, and Rh6 in 70% R8 cells.
Co-expression of both LW-opsins is specifically prevented
in peripheral photoreceptors due to cell-specific repression of Rh6 [25]. A third mechanism of repression for Rh6
occurs in all R7 cells, where it is repressed by the R7-specific transcription factor, Prospero (Pros) [27]. Finally,
Rh6 expression in DRA ommatidia (both R7 and R8 cells)
is prevented through the selective inactivation of the R8specific, Rh6 activating transcription factor Senseless

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/24

(Sens) in the DRA [28]. Thus, the release of analogous
LW-opsin repression mechanisms could have led to the
expansion of LW-opsin expression as postulated for the
evolution of Tribolium.
While it is premature to draw final conclusions on the trajectory of cis-regulatory changes that generated the retinal
mosaic of Tribolium castaneum, data and implications
identify Tribolium as unique model to study compensatory
gene regulatory mechanisms associated with gene loss.
Progress in this area can be made by studying the cis-regulatory control of Tribolium LW-opsin in comparison to
that of Drosophila Rh6 and Rh1, and by exploring the conservation of opsin expression in a wider range of darkling
beetles, as well as in distantly related Coleoptera.
Consequences and significance of opsin co-expression in
the Tribolium R7 cells
Across orders, the "one receptor rule" is important for sensory receptor expression [3,29]. The only two exceptions
to this rule in insect photoreceptors reported thus far
occur in butterfly species that have regionalized photoreceptors that co-express two opsins [30,31]. Thus, Tribolium
is the first insect example in which a specific photoreceptor subtype co-expresses two different opsins across the
entire retina. Opsin co-expression is more common in vertebrates than invertebrates [32]. In the Siberian hamster
and the pouched mouse, for instance, dual opsin-expressing cone cells are uniformly spread throughout the retina
similar to Tribolium [33]. Intriguingly, vertebrate species
with exceptionally high frequencies of opsin co-expressing photoreceptors are either nocturnal or fossorial
[32,34]. This evolutionary parallel raises the possibility
that opsin co-expression is of advantage under conditions
where brightness sensitivity is critical. This bodes well
with the low light ecological niche of Tribolium since all
postembryonic stages of Tribolium show strong negative
phototaxis [35,36].

Both vertebrate and insect opsin co-expressing photoreceptors have been found sensitive to a light spectrum that
equals the summation of the single sensitivities of the
expressed opsins [30,37,38]. While the excitation characteristics of the Tribolium R7 photoreceptors await to be
analyzed by electrophysiological means, it is reasonable
to assume that these cells are sensitive to a broad range of
light from the green into UV wavelengths. What then may
have caused the evolution of this unusual trait? For this
question to be answered, it is necessary to further explore
the functional consequences of opsin co-expression and,
secondly, the state from which the Tribolium patterns originated.
Modeling data suggest that optimal single opsin-containing photoreceptors exhibit higher photon capture rate

Page 7 of 11

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:24

than dual opsin-expressing photoreceptors [6]. However,
physiological measurements and ecological correlations
point to a stronger impact of extended wavelength sensitivity for enhancing brightness detection. In house fly, for
instance, the LW-opsin-expressing peripheral photoreceptors R1-6 contain a UV sensitizing pigment [39], which
leads to an expanded wavelength sensitivity similar to that
assumed for the Tribolium R7 cells. Importantly, this supplemental UV-sensitizing pigment has been shown to significantly increase overall brightness sensitivity in the
peripheral photoreceptors of the house fly. The effect is
considered to be particularly significant under low light
conditions [39]. Interestingly, Tribolium castaneum does
disperse by flight under conditions of stress or exposure to
strong light [40]. The conservation of flight capability
indicates that flight has maintained fitness importance
throughout Tribolium evolution. Moreover, adults of the
meal worm Tenebrio molitor are negatively phototactic like
Tribolium but become positively phototactic after
extended times of desiccation [41], suggesting that this
closely related species to Tribolium behaves as a facultative
cryptozoic species. Thus, the Tribolium visual system may
have been molded by long-term cryptozoic adaptation.
From which functional ancestral state did the broadband
sensitivity of Tribolium R7 cells evolve? While the function
of the Tribolium R7 photoreceptors may have changed to
extreme broadband photoreceptors to boost the overall
photon capture capacity of the retina, enhanced brightness sensitivity is not incompatible with maintenance of
color detection capacity. In theory, excitation differences
between LW-opsin expressing R8 and LW/UV-opsin-coexpressing R7 cells may still discriminate UV from green patterns to facilitate dichromatic vision in Tribolium. The
former may have evolved without completely sacrificing
UV versus LW discrimination ability. Indeed, structural
and comparative evidence suggest that the Tribolium central photoreceptor cells R7 and R8 represent ancestral
color detectors. The cellular architecture of the Tribolium
ommatidia is very similar to that in mealworm Tenebrio
molitor. In both species, the six peripheral photoreceptors
form a ring of rhabdomeres while the inner R7 and R8
photoreceptors contribute a separate rhabdom stem
[13,42]. Importantly, Tenebrio ommatidia exercise pupillike brightness adaptation through volume changes of the
primary pigment cells which sit on top of the photoreceptor bundle [42]. In the light-adapted state, the primary
pigment cells are expanded such that only the central R7
and R8 cells are exposed to the light path. In the darkadapted state, the primary pigment cells further contract
to additionally expose the peripheral R1-6 to light. This
mechanism suggests specialization or division of brightness detection versus color discrimination tasks between
inner and outer photoreceptors, similar to Drosophila.
While this interpretation remains to be experimentally

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/24

tested, the fact that the Tenebrio light adaptation mechanism is conserved in the more distantly related darkling
species Zophobas atratus strongly suggests that the Tribolium situation evolved from a central photoreceptor-based
color discriminating system [42].
Taken together, there is circumstantial evidence for both
costs and benefits to opsin co-expression in Tribolium R7
cells. Thus, it will be necessary to elucidate the relative significance of these aspects for the biology of Tribolium to
understand the evolutionary forces that generated the Tribolium retinal mosaic. Importantly, while dispersal by
flight under conditions of stress seems to represent the
likeliest condition under which brightness sensitivity may
be critical for Tribolium, observations in the laboratory
suggest little dependence of food and mating partner
detection on vision [35]. Nonetheless, the cryptozoic habits of Tribolium speak for an increased selection pressure
on brightness sensitivity and relaxation of the selection
pressure on color discrimination needs.
Neutral or adaptive replacement of B-opsin?
The most parsimonious trajectory of cis-regulatory evolution that leads to the retinal mosaic of extant Tribolium is
mechanistically linked to both the emergence of UV-/LWopsin co-expressing R7 cells and the loss of B-opsin
expression in R8 cells (Fig. 4c). The potential adaptive
advantage of UV-/LW-opsin co-expression in Tribolium R7
cells generates the question: could the loss of B-opsin have
been influenced not only by relaxation of color vision
needs but also enforced by an adaptive effect of increased
brightness sensitivity? Lack of blue sensitivity is reliably
documented in only a few cases of insects, including the
crepuscular cockroach Periplaneta americana, and the owlfly Ascalaphus macarionius, a diurnal predator [43,44]. The
diverse behavioral patterns of these species, however,
have provided little information regarding the potential
causes leading to reduced color discrimination [2].
Remarkably, in vertebrates, opsin dual-expressing photoreceptors as well as single LW-sensitive photoreceptors
are increased in species with cryptozoic life histories (for
review see [34]). Keeping in mind that brightness detection is primarily based on LW-opsins in both vertebrates
and insects, the parallel increase of LW-opsin expressing
cells in cryptozoic vertebrates and Tribolium is further suggestive of an adaptive trend. The replacement of B-opsin
with LW-opsin expressing cells during Tribolium evolution
may thus have been adaptive. However, this does not
enforce the conclusion that the loss of Tribolium B-opsin
involved positive selection. Either gradual or complete
expansion of the LW-opsin followed by decay of B-opsin
expression may have occurred as neutral or permissively
deleterious changes in color vision lost fitness importance, while brightness sensitivity remained under purifying selection in the lineage leading to Tribolium. It is not

clear whether the similarity in the opsin repertoires of
cryptozoic insect or vertebrate retinas reflects convergent
preferential conservation of photoreceptors essential for
brightness detection or adaptive enrichment within a
short time window of cryptozoic adaptation [34].
Extended comparative data may provide further insights.
For instance, conservation of specific UV-opsin expression
but not LW- and UV-opsin co-expression in R7 cells in
related darkling beetles would indicate a persisting need
of detecting UV light patterns but point against a strong
advantage of brightness sensitivity increase through LWand UV co-expression. Conserved co-expression of UV
with LW-opsin in R7, on the other hand, would be most
reasonably correlated with a fitness advantage of maximizing brightness sensitivity.

55 bp intron. 972 bp of the predicted Tribolium LW-opsin
ORF were amplified by nested RT-PCR using outer primer
pair TcRhR-3F (5'-TCACCGTCGTGGACAAAGTC-3') and
TcRhR-3R (5'-TTCTCGTCGGTGGTAACGTTC-3'), and
inner primer pair TcRhR-4F (5'-GCCCATTGGTACCAGTTCC-3') and TcRhR-4R (5'-AGCCGTGGAGGTGGTGTC3'). Total RNA was extracted from adult Tribolium head
with the RNAqueous kit (Ambion). The RETROscript kit
(Ambion) was used to generate cDNA through reverse
transcription initiated with random decamers. The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM®-T Vector
(Promega). Multiple identical sequences were obtained
for each paralog. The sequences are accessible under accession numbers [GenBank: DQ029113] and [GenBank:
EU164547].

Conclusion

In situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and
microscopy
95% pupal Drosophila whole-mounted retinas were dissected at room temperature (RT) in PBT (1 × PBS + 0.1%
Triton X100, pH 7.2), fixed in PLP (1 × PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.075 M lysine, 0.01 M sodium periodate,
0.05% saponin) [48], and washed 3 × 10 min with PBT.
Retinas were transferred to Signal-iT FX (Invitrogen) for
30 min, RT, before incubation with mouse anti-Rh1
(1:100, DHSB), mouse anti-Rh3 (1:5, gift from S.G. Britt),
and rabbit anti-Rh4 (1:250, gift from C.S. Zuker) overnight at 4°C in BNTS (1 × PBT, 1.5 M NaCl, 0.1% BSA,
0.05% saponin). Samples were washed 3 × 20 min with
PBT, incubated for 2 hrs at RT with AlexaFluor-488, -555,
or -648-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Molecular Probes), and washed thrice again with PBT. Retinas
were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade-reagent (Invitrogen), and imaged 24 hr later using an Axioplan IIie
equipped with the Zeiss ApoTome deconvolution module. Digital images were processed with Axiovision 4.5
(Zeiss) and AdobePhotoshop 7.0 software.

With many questions awaiting to be addressed, it seems
clear that the first look into the retinal mosaic of a cryptozoic coleopteran marks just the entry point for studying
the dark side of insect vision. Besides serving as a model
for development and pest biology, which provided the
rationale for genome sequencing [45], Tribolium also
holds promise to add illuminating data to the classic
debate over the mechanisms of reductive phenotype evolution in cryptozoic animals [46].

Methods
Animal stocks
Pearl pBac(3xP3-EGFP)af T. castaneum were reared on 5%
yeast supplemented whole wheat flour at 31°C in constant darkness. y1w67Drosophila melanogaster lines were
maintained on standard cornmeal-molasses food at room
temperature.
Bioinformatics
The putative coding regions of Tribolium castaneum LWopsin and UV-opsin were identified by TBLASTX search
with the Drosophila Rh1 and Rh3 gene sequences to the
Tribolium castaneum Georgia GA2 genome assembly
(release 8/17/2005), accessed through the Human
Genome Sequencing Center server in the Department of
Genetics at Baylor University [47]. Similar searches with
the remaining Drosophila opsins, Rh2, Rh4-Rh6, failed to
identify additional Tribolium opsin-encoding genes.
Molecular biology
A 502 bp fragment of the predicted Tribolium UV-opsin
gene was amplified from Tribolium total genomic DNA by
standard PCR using the specific primers 5'-CCCCAAAGACGAACTCATTC-3'
and
5'-ATGGTGTACCCCCAAACAAA-3'. This primer combination produces a
PCR amplicon that extends from the first putative open
reading frame (ORF) containing exon of the Tribolium UVopsin gene to the second ORF-containing exon bridging a

Whole mount in situ hybridization of Tribolium pupal retinae was carried out following previously published protocols with minor modifications [49,50]. Digoxygeninlabeled antisense RNA probes were prepared with DIGUTP RNA Labeling Mix (Roche). Pupal retinas were dissected in ice cold PBS, and fixed in 9.25% formaldehyde,
50 mM EGTA ph8, and 10% Triton X in PBT at RT for 1 h.
Tissues were then washed one time in PBS, three times in
PBT, and equilibrated for hybridization with a 10 min
incubation in 50% PBT+50% Hyb-A-RNA (hybridization
buffer A) at RT, and 1 h at 55°C in 100% Hyb-A-RNA
(50% formamide, 4 × SSC, 250 μg/ml tRNA, 0.1% Tween20, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 5% dextran sulfate) with 500
μg/ml freshly denatured herring sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out for 72 h in Hyb-A-RNA with RNA
probe at approximately 0.5 μg/ml concentration at 55°C.
Subsequently, pupal retinas were washed 3 × 30 min in

Hyb-B-RNA (50% formamide, 4 × SSC, 0.1% Tween-20)
at 55°C followed by a 24 hrs final washing step. Next, tissues were equilibrated in 5 × SSC at RT for 5 min and
another 5 min in maleic acid buffer (0.1 M maleic acid,
0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). Tissue was blocked for 2
hrs at RT in maleic acid buffer supplemented with Roche
in situ blocking buffer at 1:10 dilution (Roche). Anti-DIG
antibody (Roche) was added at a 1:5000 dilution and tissues were incubated 2 hrs at RT on a shaker. Following
antibody incubation, pupal eye discs were washed 3 × 1
hrs. Tissues were then transferred into detection buffer
(0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2) for 5
min at RT. Color detection was initiated by adding 4.5 μl
NBT (50 mg/ml) and 3.5 μl BCIP (50 mg/ml) as substrate.
Color reactions were developed for 1 to 2 hrs and stopped
by replacing staining buffer with PBT. Labeled retinas
were washed with EtOH, rehydrated, and cleared in 70%
glycerol in PBS before mounting. DIC brightfield images
were recorded through a Zeiss Axioscop coupled to a
SPORT RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Contrast and
brightness were adjusted in Photoshop CS3.
