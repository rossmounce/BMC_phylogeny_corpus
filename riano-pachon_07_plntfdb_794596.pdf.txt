Abstract
Background: Transcription factors (TFs) are key regulatory proteins that enhance or repress
the transcriptional rate of their target genes by binding to specific promoter regions (i.e. cisacting elements) upon activation or de-activation of upstream signaling cascades. TFs thus
constitute master control elements of dynamic transcriptional networks. TFs have fundamental
roles in almost all biological processes (development, growth and response to environmental
factors) and it is assumed that they play immensely important functions in the evolution of
species. In plants, TFs have been employed to manipulate various types of metabolic,
developmental and stress response pathways. Cross-species comparison and identification of
regulatory modules and hence TFs is thought to become increasingly important for the rational
design of new plant biomass. Up to now, however, no computational repository is available
that provides access to the largely complete sets of transcription factors of sequenced plant
genomes.
Description: PlnTFDB is an integrative plant transcription factor database that provides a
web interface to access large (close to complete) sets of transcription factors of several plant
species, currently encompassing Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress), Populus trichocarpa (poplar),
Oryza sativa (rice), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Ostreococcus tauri. It also provides an access
point to its daughter databases of a species-centered representation of transcription factors
(OstreoTFDB, ChlamyTFDB, ArabTFDB, PoplarTFDB and RiceTFDB). Information including
protein sequences, coding regions, genomic sequences, expressed sequence tags (ESTs),
domain architecture and scientific literature is provided for each family.
Conclusion: We have created lists of putatively complete sets of transcription factors and
other transcriptional regulators for five plant genomes. They are publicly available through
http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de. Further data will be included in the future when the
sequences of other plant genomes become available.

Background
Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins (trans-acting factors) that regulate gene expression levels by binding to
specific DNA sequences (cis-acting elements) in the promoters of target genes, thereby enhancing or repressing
their transcriptional rates. The identification and functional characterization of TFs is essential for the reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks, which
govern major cellular pathways in the response to biotic
(e.g. response against pathogens or symbiotic relationships) and abiotic (e.g. light, cold, salt content) stimuli,
and intrinsic developmental processes (e.g. growth of
organs). Two global types of TFs can be distinguished:
basal or general, and regulatory or specific TFs. Basal TFs
belong to the minimal set of proteins required for the initiation of transcription (e.g. TATA-box binding protein).
Together with RNA polymerase they form the basal transcription apparatus, representing the core of each transcriptional process. In contrast, regulatory TFs bind
proximal or distal (up or downstream) of the basal transcription apparatus and act either as constitutive or inducible factors. These proteins influence the initiation of
transcription by contacting members of the basal apparatus. Regulatory TFs exert gene-specific and/or tissue-specific functions and influence the transcriptional levels of
their target genes in response to different stimuli. In the
following when using the term TF, we refer to regulatory
TFs.
The large diversity of TFs and cis- acting elements they
bind to are the source for an enormous combinatorial
complexity which allows fine-tuning gene expression control, and gives rise to a huge spectrum of developmental
and physiological phenotypes. Therefore, it is not surprising that the manipulation of the expression of TFs often
results in drastic phenotypic changes in the organism.
This makes them extremely interesting candidates for biotechnological approaches (e.g. [1]). It is widely acknowledged that the evolution of regulatory networks is an
important actor in the development of evolutionary novelties, consequently in shaping biological diversity. A
deep understanding of transcription factors and their regulatory networks would also improve our understanding
of organism diversity [2,3].
The cataloguing of eukaryotic transcription factors started
more than a decade ago and has e.g. resulted in the generation of TRANSFAC®, a database of cis-acting elements and
trans-acting factors [4]. However, TRANSFAC® includes A.
thaliana as the only plant species that is extensively represented. Other plant species are covered to a lesser extent
(e. g. Zea mays, Nicotiana tabacum, Lycopersicum esculentum). Additionally, other TF databases focusing on single
plant species are available (for A. thaliana [5-7], or O.
sativa [8]). Kummerfeld and Teichmann [9], have created

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/42

a server for the prediction of TFs in organisms with
sequenced genomes. Up to date, however, none of the
currently available databases provides a uniform platform
to review plant TF families across several species, encompassing descriptions of each TF family and links to the
appropriate literature, and cross-references between the
databases by means of orthologous relationships.
Today, nuclear genome sequences are available for several
hundreds of organisms, and the sequencing of many more
is currently underway. This provides a huge opportunity
for making comparisons along different evolutionary
branches of the tree of life for various kinds of genes. In
this study we have focused on plants and transcription
factors. We have predicted the putatively complete sets of
transcription factors in five plant species, i.e. the vascular
plants Arabidopsis thaliana [10], Populus trichocarpa [11],
Oryza sativa [12] and the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
[13] and Ostreococcus tauri [14], and made the data available through a uniform web resource. Currently, various
other plant genomes are being sequenced, including
genomes from crops and experimental model species (see
[15]). Plant Transcription Factor Databases at Uni-Potsdam.de provides an easily usable platform for the incorporation of new TF sequences from these and additional
plant species.

Construction and content
Source datasets
Sequence data for A. thaliana were downloaded from TAIR
[16,17], annotation release version 6.0, for P. trichocarpa
they were downloaded from JGI/DOE [18], annotation
release version 1.1, for O. sativa from TIGR [19], annotation release version 4.0, for C. reinhardtii from JGI/DOE
[13], annotation release version 3.1, and for O. tauri from
the University of Ghent [20], annotation release version
August 2006.
Identification and classification of transcription factors
Transcription factors can be identified and grouped into
different families according to their domain architecture,
mainly taking into account their DNA-binding domains,
as described by Riechmann et al. [21] for A. thaliana. We
have extended this approach by including new TF families
and applied it in a systematic manner to other plant species.

Therefore, in a first step, we identified – using current literature – the list of all domains, which are known to occur
in TFs and that are generally employed to classify proteins
as transcriptional regulators. The list was established from
available PFAM profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
(v20.0, [22]), additionally we generated new models for
further TF families, as indicated below.

To group TF proteins into families, we identified – based
on previously published data – those domains, or in some
cases domain combinations, that were specific for each
family ('Literature survey' in Fig. 1). Then, we established
a set of rules for each TF family. The rules can be depicted
as a bipartite graph with two types of nodes and two types
of edges (Fig. 2).

families. A continuous edge represents a required relationship, i.e. the indicated domain must be present in a protein to be assigned to the respective TF family. A
discontinuous edge represents a forbidden relationship,
i.e. the definition of such a family excludes the presence of
the given domain. Rules were implemented in a PERL
script as "IF . . . THEN" statements ('Classifier' in Fig. 1).

One set of nodes (blue squares) represents protein families (i.e. transcription factors, solid color, or other transcriptional regulators, shaded) and the other set of nodes
(yellow circles) represents protein domains. The edges
indicate the connections between protein domains and

The general pipeline we have developed for the identification and classification of TFs is shown in Fig. 1. Typically,
the process starts with retrieving the complete set of predicted proteins for a given species, followed by a profileHMM search with all available PFAM HMMs (v20.0, [22])

proteins containing a transposase-related domain. Finally the Classifier produces a list of putative TFs grouped into families.

and the models that we have generated for further TF families. The search is carried out using the software package
HMMER (v2.3.2, [23]). All significant HMM hits are kept.
For the PFAM models, only those hits with a bit-score
larger than the gathering score reported for the HMM were
considered significant. For our own HMMs, hits with an evalue smaller than 10-3 and a bit-score threshold that differed for each HMM were considered significant. From
this set of significant HMM hits, we discarded all proteins
that contained domains having DNA-related activity but
not generally regarded as being parts of transcriptional
regulators (such as e.g. transposase-related domains).

Thereby, we eliminated potential false positives right at
the beginning. Finally, we applied the PERL script implementing the set of established rules for the identification
and classification of TFs on the remaining set of proteins
('Classifier' in Fig. 1). The script produces as output a list
of proteins that belong to the different classes of transcriptional regulators and their classification into the identified families.
For 31 out of 68 families the presence of a single domain
was sufficient to assign membership (two out of the 31
families belong to the category of other transcriptional

regulators). The remaining families were characterized by
combinations of different domains. In this way we were
able to classify transcription factors into 58 families plus
10 families for other types of transcriptional regulators,
such as chromatin remodeling factors.

was generated as an entry site to allow access to the species-specific databases.
The basic information in each species-specific database is
structured in two sets of tables. One set (right side of the
TF table) contains in several tables the information about
the TF family: literature references, family description and
domains relevant for their classification. The field relating
the information in these tables is the family_id. The second set (left side of TF table) contains five tables with the
information related to the TFs themselves: sequences,
domains present, domain alignments, expressed sequence
tags (ESTs), orthologs. The main field here is the cds_id
that unequivocally identifies every TF. One additional
table, the TF table relates the two sets of tables. This table
has both keys, i.e., cds_id and family_id, and contains the
information about the classification of the transcription
factors into families. The PlantTFDB consists of a single
table with the following fields: coding sequence identifier,
locus identifier, transcription factor family, md5sum of
the protein sequence, description of the protein sequence,
species name and TF family. The field md5sum_pep contains the md5sum of the protein sequence, which is a
sequence of 32 hexadecimal digits that identifies unequivocally each protein sequence in the database.

Table 1 summarizes the total number of TFs per species
identified through the procedure outlined above. We
detected 7597 different proteins classified as transcription
factors or other transcriptional regulators in the five species analyzed. It is not surprising that the number of TFs
generally increases with the number of genes in the
genome (e.g. [24]). On average there are 4.2 ± 2.5 TFs per
100 genes. The INPARANOID software implements a variation of the best-reciprocal-BLAST-hits method to search
for orthologs between pairs of species [25]. In finding
functionally equivalent orthologous proteins INPARANOID has been shown to be the best ortholog identification method [26]. We used INPARANOID to detect
orthologs between the analyzed species in a pairwise
manner, starting from the complete sets of predicted proteins in each species. The predicted orthologous relationships were used to create cross-references between the
species-centered databases.
New HMMs for TF families
For the families Alfin-like, CCAAT-Dr1, CCAAT-HAP3,
CCAAT-HAP5, DBP, G2-like, GRF, HRT, LUG, NOZZLE,
SAP, Trihelix, ULT and VOZ no appropriated models were
found in the PFAM (v20.0) database. Consequently we
created our own profile-HMMs based on either published
multiple sequence alignments, or on alignments we created based on outputs of PSI-BLAST searches run against
the NCBI protein database. The alignments used to build
the HMMs are available through our web interfaces.

Web databases
A web resource with a uniform look-and-feel was developed in PHP (i) for each of the species studied, and (ii) for
the PlantTFDB. We have taken care to follow W3 standards regarding HTML v4.01 and CSS v2.1 to assure
browser interoperability as much as possible. Data can be
downloaded from the databases as plain text files (Fig. 4).

The information provided in the species-specific web
databases is linked through the gene identifiers or domain
names to different external resources, when available and
appropriate: TAIR [17], TIGR's rice genome annotation
[19], JGI/DOE's poplar genome [18], and C. reinhardtii
genome annotation [13], University of Ghent's O. tauri
genome annotation [20], AthaMap [27], PlantGDB [28],
Gramene [29], INPARANOID [30], SIMAP [31], and
PFAM [22]. Additional external links to other databases
and computational tools will continually be included.

Database schemes
Data of the different TF families are stored in five MySQL
relational databases, one for each species, and in a further,
global database for PlantTFDB. To uniformly structure the
databases two different schemes were implemented (Fig.
3). The first scheme (Fig. 3A) was applied for each of the
five independent species-specific databases. The second
scheme (Fig. 3B) was implemented for PlantTFDB, which

Quality control
To evaluate the confidence in our lists of putatively complete sets of transcription factors, we decided to compare
our predictions to published data sets on detailed phylogenetic single-family analyses in A. thaliana. In this way
the published analyses were taken as the gold standard. We
measured the sensitivity and the positive predicive value
(PPV) of our approach- in a similar fashion as done by
Iida et al. [6] (The terminus 'specificity' used by Iida et al.
[6] is in fact the PPV, see [32,33]).

The sensitivity is defined as:

Sensitivity =

TP
,
TP + FN

where, TP is the number of true positives, i.e. the number
of TFs listed in our database that are also found in the gold
standard, and TP + FN, is the number of true positives plus
the number of false negatives, i.e. TP + FN is equivalent to
the total number of TFs in the gold standard.
The PPV is defined as:

PPV =

TP
,
TP + FP

with the same notation as before, and FP being the
number of false positives. Thus, TP + FP is equivalent to
the total number of TFs listed in our database.
According to these definitions, the sensitivity gives an idea
of the probability not to miss a true TF: a high sensitivity
implies a low number of false negatives. The PPV, in contrast, gives an idea of the goodness of our method at only
reporting true TFs: a high PPV implies a low number of
false positives. The results of this evaluation are shown in
Table 2. For 10 out of 12 tested TF families we obtained
sensitivity and PPV values larger than 0.90 for both measurements (bold face in Table 2). Therefore the numbers of
false negatives and false positives, respectively, are very
low. Thus, the agreement with published results is still
acceptable. For the remaining two families the agreement
is still reasonable since both values are larger than 0.80,
however at least one of them is smaller than 0.90.
The computational identification and classification of TFs
is a very dynamic process that relies on the available computational models and tools, which in turn rely on the
accumulated biological knowledge. This fact is reflected
by the calculated Sensitivity and PPV values. As more
experimental data become available over time, further
improvements in HMMs are expected helping to mini-

Utility and discussion
Users can start their data-mining either browsing by species, selecting one species and looking at all TF families
found in that genome, or browsing by families, selecting
one family and looking at the species where this TF family
is present. In either case the number of proteins found is
shown (see Fig. 4A). When a TF family of interest is
located (e.g. Alfin-like family in rice), a click on the name
of the family will lead the user to the appropriate speciescentered database showing detailed information for that
family (see Fig. 4B), where detailed information for each
of the protein members can be accessed (e. g.
LOC_Os01g66420.1; Fig. 4C). From there the user can
navigate to any of the other species for which orthologs
have been found. Alternatively, the user can use a preferred protein sequence to search the whole set of TFs in
PlnTFDB@Uni-Potsdam, or the species-centered databases, using BLAST.
The availability of all members of a family in several species will facilitate the study of their biological functions,
phylogenetic relationships, and the evolution of the DNAbinding domains. For example, Yang et al. [34] employed
the sequences available in RiceTFDB, which is part of
PlnTFDB@uni-potsdam.de, to perform an evolutionary
study of DOF TFs from three different species, i.e. Arabidopsis, poplar and rice. Information extracted from our
database is currently being used to establish an oligonucleotide-based microarray representing all predicted rice
transcription factors (Christophe Perin, CIRAD, Montpellier, personal communication). In our own experiments
we recently used the TF sequences listed in RiceTFDB to
establish a large-scale quantitative real-time polymerase

chain reaction (PCR) platform allowing us to test the
expression of more than 2.500 rice TF genes in high
throughput (manuscript in preparation). Using this platform we discovered rice TF genes responding to salt and/
or drought stress, including, besides others, the genes
LOC_Os04g45810 (HB TF), LOC_Os01g68370.3
(ABI3VP1 TF). Notably, the orthologous Arabidopsis
genes, i.e. At2g46680.1 and At3g24650, respectively, are
known to be affected by salt/drought stress [35,36].
Future plans and releases
The number of sequenced and annotated plant genomes
is rapidly increasing. The computational pipeline
described in this article will be applied to new plant
genomes as soon as they become available and the new
information will be added to future releases of PlnTFDB@uni-potsdam.de. Upcoming versions of the database will also include additional structural data about the
domains employed for the identification and classification of TFs, and detailed information about the hierarchical family classification of DNA-binding domains
[4,37,38].

We are currently extending the TF discovery pipeline
towards large EST collections. The next release of PlnTFDB@uni-potsdam.de will include such information and
will classify TFs from plant species whose genomes have
not yet been sequenced but for which large EST collections are available.

Conclusion
We constructed PlnTFDB@uni-potsdam.de, the first database of its kind that provides a centralized putatively complete list of transcription factors and other transcriptional
regulators from several plant species. Its daughter databases (OstreoTFDB, ChlamyTFDB, ArabTFB, PoplarTFDB,

and RiceTFDB) provide detailed information for individual members of each TF family, including orthologs
present in the other species. The latest version of PlantTFDB (vl.O) contains 7597 different protein sequences,
grouped into a total of 58 different TF families and 10
additional transcriptional regulator families. The web
interface provides access from different starting points,
from a gene ID, a protein sequence or a TF family.
