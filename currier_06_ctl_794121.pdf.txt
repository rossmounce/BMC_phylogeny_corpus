Abstract
Background: Subtype A is a major strain in the HIV-1 pandemic in eastern Europe, central Asia and in
certain regions of east Africa, notably in rural Kenya. While considerable effort has been focused upon
mapping and defining immunodominant CTL epitopes in HIV-1 subtype B and subtype C infections, few
epitope mapping studies have focused upon subtype A.
Results: We have used the IFN-γ ELIspot assay and overlapping peptide pools to show that the pattern
of CTL recognition of the Gag and Nef proteins in subtype A infection is similar to that seen in subtypes
B and C. The p17 and p24 proteins of Gag and the central conserved region of Nef were targeted by CTL
from HIV-1-infected Kenyans. Several epitope/HLA associations commonly seen in subtype B and C
infection were also observed in subtype A infections. Notably, an immunodominant HLA-C restricted
epitope (Gag 296–304; YL9) was observed, with 8/9 HLA-CW0304 subjects responding to this epitope.
Screening the cohort with peptide sets representing subtypes A, C and D (the three most prevalent HIV1 subtypes in east Africa), revealed that peptide sets based upon an homologous subtype (either isolate or
consensus) only marginally improved the capacity to detect CTL responses. While the different peptide
sets detected a similar number of responses (particularly in the Gag protein), each set was capable of
detecting unique responses not identified with the other peptide sets.
Conclusion: Hence, screening with multiple peptide sets representing different sequences, and by
extension different epitope variants, can increase the detectable breadth of the HIV-1-specific CTL
response. Interpreting the true extent of cross-reactivity may be hampered by the use of 15-mer peptides
at a single concentration and a lack of knowledge of the sequence that primed any given CTL response.
Therefore, reagent choice and knowledge of the exact sequences that prime CTL responses will be
important factors in experimentally defining cross-reactive CTL responses and their role in HIV-1 disease
pathogenesis and validating vaccines aimed at generating broadly cross-reactive CTL responses.

Background
The development of an efficacious prophylactic vaccine
for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the
goal of a concerted worldwide research effort [1,2].
Although the precise correlates of protective immunity
against HIV-1 infection are not clearly defined, a large
body of accumulated data suggests that an ideal HIV-1
vaccine will need to stimulate both humoral and cellular
immune responses against the virus [3]. While chronic
untreated HIV-1 infection causes a profound immunodeficiency, the initial HIV-1 infection stimulates strong cellular and humoral immune responses against the virus
[4,5]. CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) constitute a
major component of the cellular arm of the immune
response, and have a central role in the control of initial
viremia immediately following HIV-1 infection and in the
establishment of long-term AIDS free survival [6,7]. The
ability to rapidly and accurately characterize CTL
responses in HIV-1 infected individuals has grown exponentially in recent years. New technologies to detect CTL
responses by measuring interferon-gamma (IFNγ) release,
such as the enzyme linked immunospot (ELIspot) assay
and cytokine flow cytometry (CFC), have been coupled
with overlapping pooled peptide technology (OLP) to
give detailed and precise analyses of HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses [8-11]. The fine mapping of T cell
epitopes and the identification of immunodominant
regions of HIV-1 gene products is integral to vaccine
design, to the development of immunotherapeutic strategies, and to the optimization of assays for assessing vaccine efficacy.
Genetic diversity is the foremost obstacle for any screening method for HIV-1-specific cellular immunity [12-14].
Geographically defined epidemics can be characterized by
the dominance of distinct genetic subtypes of HIV-1, with
at least 9 subtypes and 21 CRFs of HIV-1 currently recognized [15]. Since intra-subtype amino acid sequence variation can be as high as 10–15% (depending on the viral
gene product) and inter-subtype variation can be much
higher, any single sequence of HIV-1 used for screening
for CTL responses will differ considerably from the
sequence of the infecting virus in an individual. This is an
important complicating factor for studying the CTL
response, because CTL are primed in vivo in response to
the autologous infecting virus. Although the use of autologous viral sequences has been employed in several studies, their general use is impractical and labor intensive
since, not only does the viral sequence between individuals differ significantly, but the viral quasi-species in a single individual can also take many different forms [16-18].
A proposed solution to this seemingly intractable problem has been to use OLP sets based upon computationally
derived consensus or ancestral sequences [19,20]. Viral
consensus and ancestral sequences have the theoretical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/7/8

advantage of being more related on average to any given
in vivo viral sequence than any arbitrary viral isolate would
be. A further complicating factor for OLP screening is that
practical peptide libraries usually comprise 15–20-mers
overlapping by 10–12 amino acids, but the optimal
length of peptides that bind to MHC class I molecules is
8–11 amino acids. However, this problem is overcome in
most cases by exogenous addition of the peptides at biologically excess concentrations [21-23]. Despite these
compromises the utility of screening for CTL responses
with consensus sequence based OLP has been demonstrated in several recent studies, which have comprehensively analyzed the full breadth and magnitude of cellular
immune responses to the entire HIV-1 proteome
[10,11,24-26]. Although consensus sequence based OLP
have now become the de facto standard for studies of HIV1 cellular immunity, the assumption that a subtype based
consensus is implicitly better than a randomly chosen isolate from the same subtype and isolates from other subtypes has only recently been questioned formally [27-30].
This study was undertaken to assess the CTL response to
the Gag and Nef proteins of HIV-1 infected individuals in
Kenya, a predominantly HIV-1 subtype A endemic region,
and to compare and contrast the CTL response measured
with that determined by prior studies in subtype B and C
epidemics. CTL responses directed against the gag and nef
gene products were selected because previous studies have
shown that these two gene products contain the highest
epitope density and are the most frequently recognized
HIV-1 proteins in subtype B and C infection [10,11,2426,31]. Detection of Gag-specific CTL responses was performed using peptide libraries representing a subtype A
consensus, a subtype A isolate, a subtype C isolate and a
subtype D isolate, to gain an insight into subtype-specificity of CTL responses in a region of multiple subtype
endemicity. Detection of Nef-specific CTL responses was
performed using peptide libraries representing a subtype
A isolate, a subtype C isolate and a subtype D isolate. After
sequence analysis of the gag and nef genes from proviral
DNA confirmed that the cohort was predominantly HIV1 subtype A infected, we integrated knowledge of the
sequence of the infecting viral isolate, the HLA-type of the
subject and the CTL response made by that subject to: (1)
determine the frequency of recognition and pattern of
CTL immunodominance within the Gag and Nef proteins
in subtype A infections; (2) compare the frequently recognized epitopes in subtype A infection with those previously determined for subtype B and C infections; (3)
compare subtype matched and mismatched peptide based
peptides sets for their ability to detect CTL responses; (4)
characterize an immunodominant HLA-CW03 restricted
CTL epitope from HIV-1. Within the framework of this
study we were able to directly test the hypothesis that in a
given cohort of HIV-1-infected subjects consensus and

isolate-based peptide libraries derived from the homologous subtype would detect significantly broader and
greater magnitude CTL responses than heterologous subtype-derived peptide libraries.

Results
HIV-1 gag and nef region subtype analysis and HLA-typing
Full-length gag and nef sequence analysis of PBMC proviral DNA was performed to characterize the HIV-1 subtype
distribution within the cohort. A single full-length gag and
nef sequence could be obtained from 40 of the 42 subjects
(sequence could not be obtained from 2 subjects). In the
gag region, 31 of the 40 subjects harbored HIV-1 subtype
A (29 sub-subtype A1 and 3 sub-subtype A2), 1 had subtype D. The remaining 8 gag sequences represented
recombinant structures, 5 A1/D, 3 A2/D. Within the nef

region, 35 of 40 subjects harbored HIV-1 subtype A (32
sub-subtype A1 and 3 sub-subtype A2), while the remaining 5 sequences represented 2 subtype D, 2 subtype C and
1 A1/D recombinant. Figure 1 shows phylogenetic trees of
the gag (A) and nef (B) sequences obtained from the
cohort, with the DNA sequence from which the isolate
based sequences were derived shown for clarity. For both
regions, the subtype A isolate shows closer branching to
the majority of the cohort sequences than the subtype C
or subtype D isolates. A pair-wise comparison of the translated autologous virus protein sequences (from all 40 subjects) with the sequence of each of the peptide sets to be
used for the ELIspot screening was performed. The autologous Gag protein sequences have mean differences of
6.1%, 10.2%, 11.6% and 13.3% from the subtype A consensus, the subtype A isolate, subtype C isolate and sub-

autologous Nef protein sequences have mean differences
of 16.4%, 18.8% and 24.5% from the subtype A isolate,
subtype C isolate and subtype D isolate based Nef peptide
sets respectively. Therefore, the cohort is predominantly
infected with HIV-1 subtype A viruses, and as would be
expected, the Gag subtype A consensus and Nef subtype A
isolate based peptide sets are closest in sequence to the
viruses present in the cohort. The nucleotide sequences
derived in this study were submitted to GenBank and are
available under the following accession numbers:
[DQ367261–DQ367332, AY945736–AY945739].

to 4-digit accuracy. The frequencies of the 10 most common HLA-A alleles were: A6802 (28.6%); A0201

A2301 (9.5%) A6601 (7.1%) and the 10 most common
HLA-B alleles were: B5301 (28.6%); B1503 (16.7%);

Elispot Screening with Overlapping Peptide Pools
The cohort was screened for IFNγ T cell responses against
four sets of Gag overlapping peptide pools and three sets
of Nef overlapping peptide pools. The gag and nef genes
were selected because these two gene products have been
documented to contain the highest CD8 epitope density
and are the most frequently recognized HIV-1 gene products [10,11,24-26]. As described in the Methods section,
the sequences of the peptide sets used for the study were
based upon homologous and heterologous subtype isolates, and on a computationally derived subtype A consensus sequence for the Gag protein. IFNγ ELIspot
responses from cryopreserved PBMC were assessed by
peptide matrix screening, followed by individual peptide
confirmation assays in order to maximize the information
from individual specimens. In both the screening and
confirmation assays, positive responses were defined as
those where the test wells exceeded the 99% confidence
interval of replicates of six negative control wells, while
for the confirmation assays individual peptides were
tested in triplicate. The 42 subjects included in the study
all demonstrated strong responses to the SEB positive control (range = 515 – 7795 SFU/106 PBMC, or confluence).
Table 1 summarizes the IFNγ ELIspot screening data in
terms of the number of subjects responding to each peptide set and the number of discrete responses detected. An
epitope, or discrete epitopic region, was defined by a
response to a single peptide or adjacent pair of overlapping peptides from an individual peptide set. While 33
subjects responded to at least 1 peptide from the 7 sets of
screening peptides, 9 subjects showed no detectable Gag
or Nef peptide specific response. Of the 33 subjects
responding to any peptide set (Gag or Nef) 30 recognized
at least 1 Gag peptide set. Of interest, similar numbers of
subjects recognized at least 1 peptide from the 4 Gag peptide sets: the subtype A consensus was recognized by 26
subjects; the CRF01_AE peptide set by 25 subjects; the
subtype C peptide set by 25 subjects; and the subtype D
peptide set by 23 subjects. The total number of responses
detected in all subjects was also evaluated. Among the Gag
responding subjects a total of 65 responses were detected
(mean of 2.2 epitopes per responding subject), with
between 1 and 5 epitopes recognized. A slightly greater,
although non-statistically significant, number of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/7/8

responses was detected by the subtype A consensus based
peptide set compared with the isolate based peptide sets
(χ2 test). The subtype A Gag consensus and subtype A Gag
isolate-based peptide sets detected 50 and 39 of the 65
total Gag responses respectively, while the subtype C and
D peptide sets each detected 41 responses. The mean
number of responses detected per responding subject was
not notably different between the 4 Gag peptide sets
(Table 1). The total frequencies of cells, expressed as SFC/
106 PBMC, responding to each of the Gag peptide sets is
shown in Figure 2A. Within the cohort the measured frequency of responding cells was similar for each peptide set
and no statistical difference among the peptide sets was
observed (Friedman Test and Kruskal-Wallis Test). Therefore, the ability to detect Gag derived CTL epitopes in an
ELIspot assay for IFNγ production was not significantly
improved by using a set of peptides based upon the consensus of subtype A compared with randomly chosen
homologous and heterologous subtype based isolate
sequences.
Of the 33 subjects responding to any peptide set, 24 recognized at least 1 Nef peptide set. The 3 Nef peptide sets
were also recognized by equivalent numbers of subjects:
the subtype A peptide set was recognized by 24 subjects;
the subtype C peptide set by 22 subjects; and the subtype
D peptide set by 22 subjects. A total of 40 Nef directed
responses were detected among the Nef responders with
between 1 and 3 Nef epitopes recognized by each subject
(mean of 1.7 epitopes per responding subject). The subtype A Nef peptide set was significantly (χ2 test; p < 0.03)
better at detecting the Nef-specific responses (detecting 38
of the 40 total responses) compared with the heterologous subtype based peptide sets (subtype C, 29 responses;
and subtype D, 32 responses). There was however, no statistically significant difference between the magnitude of
SFC detected in response to each of the 3 Nef peptide sets
(Figure 2B) (Friedman Test and Kruskal-Wallis Test).

Multi-subtype reactive and subtype-specific CTL are
detectable in HIV-1 subtype A infection
Figure 3 shows the cumulative frequency of responses
against individual Gag peptides for the cohort. The profiles show a remarkably similar response pattern for each
of the four Gag peptide sets, indicating a potentially high
level of multi-subtype reactivity of Gag-specific CTL from
subtype A infected subjects. Responses were directed primarily against the p17 (23 responses) and p24 (36
responses) proteins, with fewer responses detected against
the p15 proteins (6 responses). Four epitopic regions of
the subtype A Gag consensus peptide set were recognized
by >10% of the subjects and were also cross-recognized
within the isolate based peptide sets. Two of these regions
were located in p17, peptides 4–5 and peptides 19–20
(amino acids 13–31 and 73–91 respectively) and two
within p24, peptides 40–41 and peptides 73–74 (amino
acids 161–175 and 289–307 respectively). These regions
are rich in previously mapped CTL epitopes from subtypes
B and C [15]. The study also showed a notable similarity
in the response profiles against the 3 sets of Nef peptides
(Figure 4). The central conserved region of the Nef protein
is recognized predominantly in all 3 peptide sets, and is
also extremely conserved among the peptide sets. From
amino acid position 60 through to 148 (peptides 19–36
for subtype A, and peptides 17–34 for subtypes C and D)
the three peptide sets have only 13 amino acids which differ, and a single amino acid insertion the subtype C isolate
with respect to the subtype A and D isolates. Not surprisingly, the majority (32/40) of the Nef responses detected
by the 3 peptide sets reside within this 89 amino acid
stretch. The subtype A peptide set is slightly offset with
respect the subtype C and D peptide sets due to an 11
amino acid insertion after residue 27. This insertion did
not contain any detected epitopes, nor did it appear to disrupt epitopes detected with the subtype C and D peptide
sets or other previously defined epitopes [15].

Figure 4
Nef peptide response histograms for all peptides from each
Frequency ofset
Frequency of response histograms for all peptides from each
Nef peptide set. All peptide responses scored as positive (by
cut-off criteria described in Methods and Materials) are
shown, including those obtained for adjacent overlapping
peptides. Histograms are shown for (A) subtype A isolate,
(B) subtype C isolate, and (C) subtype D isolate. Peptides
are numbered sequentially along the x-axis.
Since the overall analysis showed a high degree of similarity and multi-subtype recognition, the cohort was examined for the number of responses detected across all
subtypes and those detected by a subset of subtypes or a
single subtype. Overlapping Venn diagrams (Figure 5)
were used to display the number of responses detected by
the individual peptide sets and by the various combinations of peptide sets. For example, Figure 5A shows that of
65 identified Gag responses, 22 were detected with all 4
peptide sets as shown by the central overlap of all 4 circles,
each of which encompasses all responses detected by that
peptide set. By this analysis 36 of the 65 Gag responses
were detectable with at least 3 of the peptide sets, while
the remaining 29 were detected with only 2 or 1 of the
peptide sets. Strikingly, the consensus subtype A peptide
set detected only 4 responses not detectable by any of the
3 isolate based peptide sets, and the isolate based peptide
sets collectively, detected 15 responses not detected with
the subtype A consensus peptide set. Moreover, the sub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/7/8

type C and D heterologous isolate derived peptide sets
detected 12 responses not detected by either of the two
subtype A based peptide sets, with 11 of the responses representing different epitopic regions since only 2 were
against the same peptide. It was reasoned that because the
cohort contained 1 subtype C, 2 subtype D and 6 intersubtype recombinant gag genes, then these subjects may
be the source of the responses not detected with the subtype A derived peptide sets. However, this was not the
case, as only 1 of the 12 epitopes not detected with subtype A peptide sets could be attributed to subjects from
which non-pure subtype A gag containing virus sequence
was obtained. This response was detected with the subtype C peptide set and was from a subject (KSM4039) carrying an inter-subtype recombinant gag sequence (A1/D).
Thus, the overall magnitude and breadth of the CTL
response against subtype A Gag was underestimated when
screening with any single peptide set. The use of a single
peptide set derived from an homologous subtype Gag
sequence (whether it be based upon an isolate or a consensus) did not give a complete representation of the repertoire of Gag-specific epitopes recognized by any given
subject in this study. Similar analysis for the Nef protein
showed that the homologous subtype A derived peptide
set detected all but 2 of the Nef responses detected in this
study. Most of the Nef responses were directed to the
highly conserved central region of the protein with 26/40
total responses detected by all 3 isolate derived peptide
sets. Notably, the number of responses detected with the
subtype A Nef isolate peptide set (38) was significantly
greater than that detected with either the subtype C Nef
(29) or D Nef (32) peptide sets (p = 0.03; χ2 test). Therefore in this cohort, the use of homologous subtype
derived Nef sequences did maximize the detection of Nef
CTL epitopes.
Characteristics of positive and discordant peptides in
relation to each other and to autologous virus sequences
The identified CTL responses were next compared and
examined in greater detail. All positively recognized peptides from all peptide sets were compared to the Gag or
Nef sequence of autologous virus. First, the total number
of possible responses detected in the study was calculated
by multiplying the number of discrete Gag responses by 4
and the number of discrete Nef responses by 3. This calculation was performed since any response directed against
Gag had 4 possible hits (one from each peptide set), and
any response against Nef had 3 possible hits. Of a total of
260 possible responses directed against all Gag peptide
sets, 171 were detected, while of a possible 120 responses
against all Nef peptide sets, 99 were detected. When the
peptides representing the 270 detected Gag and Nef
responses were compared to the autologous virus
sequence obtained from each host, approximately onethird (98) were identical to the autologous virus sequence

while approximately two-thirds (172) had at least one
amino acid mismatch with the autologous sequence.
Hence a greater number of responses were detected in
subjects whose proviral DNA contained a different
sequence compared to the peptide used to detect the
response. To obtain a better impression of the cross-reactive nature of the CTL responses measured, the impact of
"frame-of-epitope" and sequence variation between concordant and discordantly recognized peptides was also
examined. The "frame-of-epitope" refers to the offset position of a 9-mer minimal epitope within a given 15-mer
screening peptide and the effect has been the subject of
several recent studies [21,23,30]. Because the screening
peptide sets were derived from quite disparate subtypes,
there was significant frame offsetting between peptides
mapping to the same region of the different peptide sets.
When a given epitope was detected with more than one
peptide set, there were 70 examples of frame offsetting
between the concordant (positive) peptides (Table 2).
This indicates that despite significant minimal epitope
offsetting, cross-recognition of the peptide sets was frequent. In addition, within the concordant peptides there
were 74 examples of peptides with different sequences
able to be recognized. These most likely represent truly
cross-reactive responses, since more than one peptide
sequence can be recognized by CTL from a single individual.
Next, the discordant peptides were compared to the corresponding positive peptides to identify the reason for noncross-recognition. The most likely reason for non-crossrecognition was a sequence difference between the peptides. In 76 discrete epitopic regions a discordant peptide
had a different sequence compared with the corresponding positive peptide, and of these 52 were in the same
frame while 24 were offset in frame. Importantly, it was
noted that in 18 discrete epitopic regions, discordant
results were obtained between peptide sets despite
sequence identity across the corresponding regions. In 13
instances there was frame offsetting between the positive
and discordant peptides, which could account for the disparity in recognition. However, in 5 instances peptides of
identical primary sequence were discordantly scored as
positive. In each of these 5 cases the positively scored peptide only marginally exceeded the cut-off for positivity.
However, it was impossible to determine if these discordantly scored peptides were a result of a false positive (peptide incorrectly scored positive) or a false negative
(discordant peptide incorrectly scored negative). In summary, the majority of examples of discordant detection of
CTL responses were due to sequence variation, while the
position of a minimal epitope within a screening peptide
inconsistently affected detection of CTL responses. Artifactual false positive or false negative detection of CTL
responses was also encountered on rare occasions.

Epitopes commonly targeted in subtype B and C are also
targeted in subtype A infection
The most frequently recognized peptides (3 or more
responders) were examined for the possession of common HLA alleles among the responder subjects and analyzed for known CTL epitopes. Table 3 outlines 11
commonly recognized peptides (15-mer) or peptide overlaps (11-mer) observed in the study and their probable
HLA-restrictions. Of these 11 epitopes 8 have been
described before [15] and are commonly recognized in
both subtype B [10,11] and subtype C [25,26,31] infections. The previously described minimal epitopes are also
listed in Table 3. One Nef peptide contains a previously
defined HLA-B*3501 restricted epitope, or overlapping
epitope, which is restricted by B*4201/02 and/or B*5301.
Seven of the epitopes were detected with all peptide sets
while 3 displayed variable cross-reactivity and 1 was subtype A Nef-specific. The well characterized and studied
SL9 A*0201-restricted Gag p17 epitope (present in the AConsensus and C-Isolate peptide sets) was recognized by
5 of 9 A*0201 subjects, but the variant (SLFNTIATL) was
recognized by only 3 of these 5 subjects, indicating
sequence dependent modulation of immunodominance
and cross-reactivity for this epitope. Variable cross-reactivity was also observed for another previously characterized
epitope – the Gag p24 KF11 B*5701/03 restricted epitope
– was recognized by 5 of 5 B*5701/03 subjects, but the
variant (KGFNPEVIPMF) was recognized by only 3 of
these subjects. The B*4202 restricted Gag p24 epitope TL9
(TPQDLNMML) showed subtype specificity, in that of 4
B*4202 subjects responding to this epitope only 1 crossreacted with the peptides containing the variant TPQDLNTML. Therefore, the M to T change in this epitope
appears important for CTL recognition. Of the 4 Nef
responses which could be assigned to a particular HLAallele, only the potential A*6802 restricted epitope
(AVTSSNVNHPS) showed subtype specificity. Three
A*6802 subjects responded to this epitope in the A-Nef
peptide set, but none recognized the complementary peptides in the C- or D-Nef peptide sets. A deletion of 2
amino acids in the A-Nef isolate sequence relative to the
C- and D-Nef isolates used in the study most likely
accounts for this difference in recognition. The 3 other Nef
epitopes which could assigned to HLA-alleles had been
defined previously and were recognized and conserved in
the 3 peptide sets. Seven subjects recognized the p24 peptide FRDYVDRFFKTLRAE (amino acids 293–307; HXB2
numbering) in all of the peptide sets. This sequence maps
to a highly conserved region of p24 and is identical
among 3 of the peptide sets and has a single substitution
of F301Y in the UG57143 (subtype D) peptide set. In the
subtype C peptide set, 2 peptides (#73 and #74) have this
sequence spread across their overlap, and both were recognized by all 7 subjects. Further characterization of this
epitope is performed below.

Characterization of an Immunodominant HLA-Cw*0304
Restricted Gag Epitope
The immunodominant, cross-subtype response directed
against the conserved sequence FRDYVDRFFLTLRAE
(peptide #74 from the A-Gag consensus set) was further
characterized. Several epitopes have been previously
mapped to this region and hence it was of interest to map
the minimal epitope and to determine if this response was
restricted by one, or multiple, HLA alleles. All of the seven
subjects responding to this epitope expressed the HLACW*0304 allele (or a closely related HLA-CW03 family
allele). While no exact match to the defined CW0304 peptide-binding motif [34] was found in the 15-mer, an internal 9-mer (YVDRFFKTL; referred to as YL9) had the best
possible match of any minimal peptide within the 15 mer
peptide. Therefore, HLA restriction assays were carried out
using BLCL with a partial HLA match with the test subjects
and using BLCL expressing CW*0304. In addition, both
the 15-mer and 9-mer peptides (YL9) were tested directly

for up-regulation of IFN-γ gene expression. Representative
data for one of the six responders (KNH1272) is shown in
Figure 6A. The 15-mer and YL9 peptides elicit an IFN-γ
response from an almost identical number of CD8+ T cells
(3.24% and 3.64% respectively). The only common allele
expressed by the BLCL able to present the 15 mer peptide
is HLA-CW*0304 demonstrating that CW*0304 is the
restricting allele for this epitope. To confirm that the YL9
was the minimal epitope, CTL effector cells were generated from PBMC of a CW*0304 responder subject
(KNH1241) using an in vitro stimulation protocol with
the 15-mer peptide. Following two rounds of in vitro stimulation the effector cells were used in a standard chromium release assay to test for cytotoxic activity against the
15-mer peptide #74 (FRDYVDRFFLTLRAE), two flanking
peptides (#73 and #75) to which no response was
detected in the screening ELIspot assays, and the YL9 peptide. Figure 6B shows the efficient specific killing (effector
to target ratio = 20:1) of autologous BLCL pulsed with YL9
or peptide #74 (FRDYVDRFFLTLRAE), but not peptide
#73 which has the C-terminal L of YL9 truncated, nor peptide #75 which has the N-terminal Y of TL9 truncated.
Therefore the minimal epitope is YL9. In addition the
effector cells also demonstrated efficient killing of BLCL
pulsed with variants of YL9, which were observed in the
cohort. As shown in Figure 6B, BLCL pulsed with each of
three variants YL9-F6Y, YL9-T8V and YL9-T8C were efficiently lysed. The ability of related alleles within the CW03
family to present the YL9 peptide was also tested. The
effector cell line from KNH1241 was subjected to a further
round of in vitro stimulation and the resultant cells used
as effectors in a chromium release assay to test for cytotoxic activity against a panel of BLCL expressing different
HLA-CW03 family alleles. Figure 6C shows that CW*0302
and CW*0303 can present YL9 to a CW*0304-restricted
CTL line. The peptide-pulsed cells are clearly lysed at a
range of E:T ratios from 20:1 to 2.5:1 compared with the
sham-pulsed control cells. The autologous BLCL
(CW*0304 expressing), and BLCL which do not express
any HLA-CW03 alleles, were used as positive and negative
controls respectively. Since the relative cross-reactivity of
peptide variants can be over-estimated when using highly
elevated concentrations of peptide, a titration of the
response to YL9 and its variants was performed with
PBMC from two YL9 responders. Figure 6D shows the
sequence of the variants used and the number of occurrences of each variant in the proviral DNA of the cohort.
In both subjects the response to YL9 (treated as the index
peptide) was of higher avidity than that to any of the three
variants (Figure 7). Of note is that the YL9-T8C variant,
the weakest stimulator of all the variants, was detected in
the only one of nine CW*0304 positive subjects that did
not respond to the YL9 epitope. Therefore the YL9 epitope
can be presented by most alleles within the HLA-CW03

family, but in spite of sequence conservation potential

subtype A derived peptides. However, the results presented here demonstrate that viral sequence variability,
and by extension the infecting subtype, does not predict
the degree of subtype-specific responsiveness of CTL. The
subtype A based peptide sets only marginally improved
our ability to detect CTL responses, with no single peptide
set capable of detecting all CTL responses. These observations are not without precedent, as we have demonstrated
equivalent Gag, Env and Nef multiple-subtype recognition by CD8 T cells using a recombinant vaccinia virus
based expression system producing full-length gene products in a similar cohort of Kenyan subjects [39]. In addition, in studies on individuals from Uganda, where
subtype D and subtype A predominate in the HIV-1 epidemic, the lack of subtype-specificity and predictive
capacity of the infecting subtype has also been described
[27]. A simplistic interpretation of these results is that
broadly cross-reactive CTL are generated by any subtype of
infection and these responses may be predictive of the
ability of a single isolate, or consensus sequence, based
vaccine to generate broadly cross-protective responses. An
important caveat associated with the experimental
approach used in these studies need to be considered
before such a profound conclusion can be reached with
confidence. The concentration of 15-mer peptides used in
these studies is very high – usually in the low micro-molar
range, whereas minimal peptides have been shown to
have half-maximal CTL stimulatory capacity in the low
nano-molar range to high pico-molar range [40,41]. The
excessive amounts of 15-mer peptide used in the screening assays may stimulate partially cross-reactive CTL,
which might not recognize endogeneously processed and
presented antigen on a virus infected cell. Titration of the
HLA-CW*0304 restricted YL9 epitope variants performed
in this study showed that even though cross-reactivity of
the F6Y variant was detected for all responding subjects
(8/9) in the screening and confirmation assays, CTL have
a much lower avidity for the F6Y variant than the wildtype. Hence, true CTL cross-reactivity needs a more stringent definition – one that takes into account avidity for
variant peptides, and translation of avidity measurements
into biological relevance. This effect may be even more
pronounced on HIV-1 infected cells where surface expression of HLA class I A- and B-alleles can be down-regulated
by the Nef protein [42,43].

Discussion
While HIV-1 subtype C is the predominant circulating
pure subtype in sub-saharan Africa, HIV-1 subtype A constitutes a significant proportion of the epidemic in eastern
and central Africa [35-37]. Recent studies have estimated
that HIV-1 subtype A constitutes >90% of the epidemic in
terms of pure subtype and recombinant forms in eastern
Africa, particularly in Kenya [35]. Comprehensive studies
have characterized CTL responses in HIV-1 subtype B and
C infections, however few studies have mapped in detail
CTL cell responses in HIV-1 subtype A infections. Our
results show that, as has been observed and described for
subtype B and C infections, the Gag and Nef proteins are
frequent targets of the CTL response of HIV-1 subtype A
infections. Although the frequency of responses detected
in this cohort against individual peptides was not as great
as that detected in studies of subtype B infection (up to
50% of subjects responding to a single Nef peptide)
[10,11], the pattern of CTL responses across the Gag and
Nef proteins was remarkably similar to studies from other
subtypes [10,11,26,31]. Hence, it appears likely that the
N- and C-termini of p17, much of p24 and the central
conserved region of Nef are immunodominant for CTL
responses irrespective of the infecting subtype. Importantly, both the frequency of responding subjects, and the
magnitude of the CTL responses detected against Gag and
Nef using IFNγ ELIspot assay, was also consistent with
results described in other studies of drug treatment naïve
subjects from Africa [27,31].
Given the disparity of the different peptide sets used
(derived from subtype A consensus, and subtype A, C and
D isolates) and the fact that the subtype A derived peptide
sets were much more similar on average to the viral
sequences obtained from the studied cohort, it was surprising to observe that both the magnitude and pattern of
recognition of the peptide sets was so similar for both Gag
and Nef. CTL recognition is critically dependent upon
peptide binding to MHC molecules and T cell receptor
interactions with the peptide-MHC complex [38]; hence it
was reasonable to expect that peptides from non-subtype
A origin should be recognized to a lesser extent than the

A further caveat associated with the use of 15-mer peptides is that minimal CTL epitopes – generally 9–10
amino acids in length – are embedded in the 15-mer peptides. Several recent studies have demonstrated that the
relative position (or offset) of a minimal epitope within a
15-mer peptide can adversely affect the magnitude of the
CTL response measured in response to a given 15-mer
peptide [21,23]. While the precise mechanism behind the
"epitope-offsetting" effect has not been elucidated it is
assumed that amino acid residues flanking the minimal
epitope may impair the ability of the 15-mer to be bound
by MHC, and/or processed, prior to CTL recognition. As
shown in the present study the epitope-offsetting effect
can lead to artifactual false-negatives when comparing different sets of 15-mer OLPs. Hence, the high concentrations of 15-mer peptides used in screening assays may
contribute to an over-estimation of cross-reactivity, and
the offsetting of variant epitopes in different 15-mer peptide sets can lead to an under-estimation of cross-reactivity. Despite the potential to confound interpretation of
our results, the epitope-offsetting effect was the exception
rather than the rule, and as such we believe our overall
interpretation of the results to be accurate. In support of
this are prior studies, which have shown that multi-subtype reactivity can be readily detected using recombinant
vaccinia viruses to deliver Gag, Nef and Env proteins into
the cytoplasm – thereby enabling de novo antigen-processing and presentation to occur – avoiding concentrationdependent issues with peptide studies [28,39,44].

gent of choice, practical limitations preclude this
approach for large-scale cross-sectional screening studies.
Consensus and ancestral sequence based peptide sets have
been proposed as a practical solution for maximizing CTL
epitope detection. However, as the data presented here
shows, a consensus sequence representing a single subtype cannot fully capture the breadth of the CTL response.
Utilization of multiple peptide sets clearly increases the
breadth of detection of HIV-1-specific CTL, most likely
because of the presence of different variants of many
epitopes among the peptide sets. Using peptides representing different variants of epitopes – either in OLP sets
or as minimal peptide epitopes – therefore gives a better
account of the true CTL breadth, especially in locations
where multiple subtypes co-circulate. The importance of
revealing the true breadth of the CTL response in HIV-1
infection has been highlighted in the recent study of
Frahm et al. [45], which showed that targeting of subdominant CTL epitopes was associated with better control
of viral load. If this result proves to be generalizable, then
CTL-based vaccine and immunotherapeutic strategies will
need to maximize the breadth of the induced CTL
response in order to be efficacious. This further highlights
the importance of reagent selection for measuring CTL
magnitude and breadth and for interpreting cross-reactivity in the setting of HIV-1 infection and vaccine trials.
While several HLA-C restricted epitopes from HIV-1 have
been defined [15], this study presents, to our knowledge,
the first evidence of HLA-C restricted immunodominance
at the population level. Interestingly, the minimal 9-mer
(YL9) defined here (and in reference [25]) with a HLACW*0304 allelic restriction, has been defined with HLAB*1510 [31] and HLA-A*0207 [44] restrictions in other

Reagent selection is a critical determinant for maximizing
detection of CTL specific for different epitope variants of
HIV-1. While the use of reagents that match the autologous virus sequence in a given host would be the ideal rea-

populations. However, the B*1510 restriction analysis of
this peptide defined by Novitsky et al [31] did not completely rule out the possibility that HLA-C may have been
the restricting locus because of the tight linkage disequilibrium of the HLA-B*1510 allele with CW03 alleles.
Given that YL9 is recognized in the context of most members of the HLA-CW03 allele family, and at least two other
HLA alleles, and is derived from a highly conserved region
of the p24 protein, this peptide warrants inclusion in minimal epitope based vaccine strategies. It should be noted
that the most frequently observed peptide response and
HLA combination that we noted for the Nef protein was
also a HLA-C allele: HLA-CW*0701 with peptide sequence
KKRQEILDLWVYHTQ (defined as KY11 associated with
CW*0701 allele possession in reference [25]). HLA-C alleles may offer an attractive alternative to the more commonly proposed HLA-A and -B loci for minimal epitope
targeted vaccine strategies because they are refractory to
down-regulation by the Nef protein [42,43].

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that in subtype A infections
the pattern of immunodominance and epitope clustering
observed within the Gag and Nef proteins of HIV-1 is similar to that seen in subtype B and C infections. Importantly, similar epitope clustering patterns were observed
using either a subtype matched consensus-based peptide
set, or isolate-based peptide sets from heterologous subtypes. In agreement with previous studies, knowledge of
the predominant infecting subtype in a given population
does not necessarily predict the subtype-specificity of the
CTL response. An extension of this observation was the
finding that no single screening sequence, even a subtype
matched consensus sequence, can fully capture the true
breadth of the CTL response. Future studies aimed at capturing the true breadth and cross-reactivity of HIV-1-specific CTL responses in multiple-subtype endemic regions
will require: (1) monitoring the viral quasi-species longitudinally to give a sense of what sequences may be driving
a measured CTL response; (2) high resolution HLA-typing
data from the subjects studied, (3) titration studies with
synthetic peptides representing minimal epitopes of multiple variants or peptides based upon the autologous viral
sequence and; (4) an understanding of how closely the
avidity of a CTL for a variant peptide needs to match that
for the index peptide to be considered truly cross-reactive.
Finally, vaccine trials offer the best setting for testing the
true extent CTL cross-reactivity, since this is the only circumstance in which the exact sequence that primes a CTL
response is known with certainty.

Methods
Study subjects
Anonymously donated HIV-1 positive blood units were
collected between 1999 and 2000 from Kericho District

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/7/8

Hospital (Kericho), Rift Valley Provincial Hospital
(Nakuru) and Kenyatta National Hospital (Nairobi), all
in southern Kenya, under a study approved by both Kenyan and U.S. based Institutional Review Boards. Names,
personal information and medical conditions of the subjects were not available, but all subjects were antiretroviral
treatment naïve. Blood units were identified only by an
alphanumeric code and because of the nature of collection, CD4 counts and viral load data were not available.
HIV-1 positivity was assessed by Serostrip (Saliva Diagnostic Systems, Medford NY, USA) and confirmed by
ELISA (Organon Teknika/BioMerieux, Inc., Marcy l'Etiole,
France).
PCR, cloning and sequencing of HIV-1 gag and nef
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA was extracted
using QIAamp blood extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia,
CA). A nested PCR was employed to retrieve gag and nef
region. The PCR mixtures and cycling conditions were
described previously [46]. For gag region, outer primers
used to amplify gag (HXB2 positions 796 to 2381) were
MSF12B (5'-AAATCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAG 3') and BJPOL3 (5'- GTTGACAGGTGTAGGTCCTAC-3').
Then either using F2NST (5'-GCGGAGGCTAGAAGGAGAGAGATGG -3') and SP3AS (5'-CCTCCAATTCCCCCTATCATTTTTGG-3') as the inner primers and
directly sequenced the amplicon obtained, or performing
the second-round PCR using two inner primer pairs,
F2NST/SP3AS and GAG763 (5'-TGACTAGCGGAGGCTAGAAGGAGAGA-3')/JL80
(5'-TAATACTGTATCATCTGCTCCTGT-3'). The PCR products were pooled, purified
and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector using a Topo TA
cloning kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Nef region
from HXB2 positions 8797 to 9417 was amplified. Outer
primers were JL106 (5'-TTCAGCTACCACCGCTTGCGAGACT-3') and UNINEF 7 (5'-GCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCTT-3'). The second-round PCR was done
using two different inner primer pairs. The first pair was
UVNEF1 (5'-GGGGTCGGGAACTGAAAATTAGTGC-3')
and TATANEF (5'- GCAGCTGCTTATATGCAGGATCTGAGGG-3'). The second pair was UVNEF2 (5'-AGACAGGGCTTTGAAAGGGCTTT-3') and UNINEF7. The two PCR
products obtained were pooled, purified and subjected to
sequencing. Plasmid DNA or PCR product was directly
sequenced using Big Dye terminator reaction kits and an
Applied Biosystems 3100 capillary sequencer (Applies
Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The obtained sequences
were aligned with reference sequences of the relevant subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRF). Phylogenetic analysis was performed to subtype designate the
sequences of interest using SEQBOOT, DNADIST
(Kimura 2-parameter, transition/transversion ratio = 2.0),
NEIGHBOR, and CONSENSE modules of the PHYLIP
Package. Deduced gag and nef protein were generated
from the nucleotide sequences and aligned. Pair-wised

FigureYL9 response is HLA-CW*0304 restricted

A. The YL9 response is HLA-CW*0304 restricted. CFC assays for IFNγ up-regulation were performed using 15-mer peptide
pulsed (solid bars) or sham-pulsed (open bars), partially HLA-matched BLCL as antigen-presenting cells for PBMC. Media
alone, and media containing SEB (hatched bars), served as negative and positive controls respectively. The SEB response has
been truncated for clarity and the frequency of responding cells appended beside the bar. All panels were gated based upon the
CD3+CD8+CD69HIGH cell population in the PBMC. Only BLCL possessing the HLA- CW*0304 allele (boxed) can present the
peptide. The parent 15-mer (peptide #74 from A-consensus peptide set), and the minimal 9-mer peptide (YL9) added alone to
the PBMC stimulated an equivalent frequency of CD8+ T cells. B. A CTL line generated by in vitro stimulation with peptide #74
from the A-Gag consensus peptide set efficiently lysed autologous BLCL pulsed with the same peptide, but not adjacent peptides #73 or #75, in a standard chromium release assay. Autologous BLCL pulsed with the predicted minimal epitope (9-mer
YL9), and three variants of this epitope detected in the same cohort, were also lysed. Symbols for the effector to target ratios
are denoted below the figure panel. C. Effector cells from the re-stimulated CTL line from above were able to lyse YL9-pulsed
allogeneic BLCL, which express different alleles from the HLA- CW03 family. For each BLCL tested sham- and peptide pulsed
targets are shown at a range of E:T ratios from 20:1 down to 2.5:1. The symbols for the E:T ratios are the same as used in
panel 6B. The left-most BLCL on the panel are the autologous cells (HLA-CW*0304 positive), and right-most BLCL are negative
for HLA- CW03 alleles. D. Sequences of the peptides used for the minimal epitope mapping and variant peptide testing.

distance matrix of proteins was calculated using maximum likelihood estimates based on the Dayhoff PAM
matrix.

PCR-based HLA class I Typing
HLA typing was performed on all subjects at the University of Alabama (Birmingham, AL), using DNA extracted
from either PBMC or autologous B lymphoblastoid cell

lines (BLCL). Briefly, high molecular weight genomic
DNA was extracted from immortalized B cells or PBMC
using the QIAamp Blood Kit and protocols recommended
by the manufacturer (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, California,
USA). The 4-digit alleles at the HLA-A and -B loci were
resolved by automated reference-strand conformation
analyses (RSCA) of PCR amplicons corresponding to exon
2, intron 2, and exon 3 sequences (Pel-Freez Clinical Systems, Brown Deer, Wisconsin, USA). The 2-digit HLA-C
specificities were defined separately by PCR with
sequence-specific primers (SSP) (Pel-Freez Clinical Systems, Brown Deer, Wisconsin, USA).
Synthetic peptides
PBMC were screened for HIV-specific CTL responses by
stimulation with OLPs representing Gag and Nef from
isolates of subtypes A, C and D. OLPs consisted of 15-mer
peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids covering the
entire Gag and Nef protein sequence of isolates 90CF402
(subtype A-gag, ACC# AAB38823), DU422 (subtype C-

gag, ACC# CAD62240) 98UG57143 (subtype D-gag,
ACC# AF484514), 92UG037 (subtype A-nef, ACC#
AAC97549), DU151 (subtype C-nef, ACC# AAL05314)
and 94UG114 (subtype D-nef, ACC# AAC97574). Peptides were synthesized using FMOC chemistry and standard solid-phase techniques with free amino termini. All
peptides were >80% pure as determined by HPLC, mass
spectroscopy, amino acid analysis and N-terminal
sequencing. The A-Gag peptide set was synthesized at the
Henry M Jackson Foundation and by Anaspec Inc. (San
Jose, CA), while the C-Nef peptide set was a kind gift from
Dr. Clive Gray (National institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa). All other peptide sets
were synthesized at the Natural and Medical Sciences
Institute (University of Tuebingen, Germany). Synthetic
peptide epitopes of 9 amino acids in length with free
amino termini were synthesized using FMOC chemistry
and standard solid-phase techniques (Excel automated
synthesizer; Waters, Milford MA). Syntheses were carried
out in-house (Henry M. Jackson Foundation). All peptides were >80% pure as determined by HPLC, and verified for correct sequence by mass spectroscopy, amino
acid analysis and N-terminal sequencing. The peptide
pool matrices were of the following formats: 11 linear
pools of 11 or 12 peptides and 11 pools of every 11th peptide for the Gag peptide sets; 7 linear pools of 7 or 8 peptides and 7 pools of every 7th peptide for the Nef peptide
sets. Therefore, less than two whole 96-well ELIspot plates
were required to screen all 7 peptides sets for each individual. See Additional file 1: Peptide Sequences for the list
and sequence of all synthetic peptides used in the study.
Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELIspot) assay
All assays were performed using RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% normal human serum, 100 U/ml penicillin
and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (complete medium; CM).
Cryopreserved PBMC were recovered from liquid nitrogen, thawed rapidly, washed twice with CM and incubated at 2–5 × 106 cells/ml in CM for 14–16 hours. After
the overnight rest, the PBMC were enumerated prior to
addition to the ELIspot assay plates at 1–2 × 105 viable
cells per well. Ninety-six well ELIspot plates (Multiscreen®-IP plates MAIP type plates, Millipore, MA) were
prepared by pre-wetting with 50 µl of 70% ethanol (in
water) per well and incubating for 5 minutes at room temperature followed by washing six times with PBS. Plates
were coated with mouse anti-human IFNγ monoclonal
antibody (1-D1K, Mabtech AB, Sweden) at 5 µg/ml in 100
µl PBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed six times with
PBS and blocked with 100 µl of complete medium for one
hour at 37°C. As a positive control for functional integrity
of the cells, staphylococcal entertoxin-B (SEB) was added
to the wells at 5 µg/ml final concentration and cells were
incubated with CM only as a negative control. Peptides
were used at a final concentration of 2 µg/ml and all ELIs-

pot tests and controls were performed in triplicate wells.
Plates were incubated for 20–24 hours at 37°C (5% CO2),
washed six times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 buffer and
incubated for two hours with biotinylated mouse antihuman IFNγ monoclonal antibody (7B6-1-biotin,
Mabtech AB, Sweden) at 2 µg/ml in PBS/0.05% Tween 20
buffer. ELIspot development consisted of a one hour incubation with an avidin horseradish peroxidase complex
(Vectastain® ABC kit, Vector Labs, CA) in PBS/0.05%
Tween 20 buffer followed by washing six times with PBS,
and incubation with peroxidase substrate AEC for five
minutes (AEC substrate Kit, Vector Labs, CA). ELIspot
plates were examined under a stereomicroscope and spots
were evaluated with an Automated Elispot Reader System
using KS 4.3 software (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) by an
independent scientist in a blinded fashion (Henry M.
Jackson Foundation, Rockville, MD). Positive IFNγ spot
forming units (SFU) representing single cells were
counted and expressed as SFU per one million input
PBMC. Assays were considered valid if responses of
greater than 500 SFU per 1 million PBMC were detected
with SEB. In the screening assays the seven peptide sets
were tested in a matrix format consisting of 11 pools of 11
or 12 peptides for the Gag OLP sets and 7 pools of 7 or 8
peptides for the Nef OLP sets. After matrix deconvolution
most of the individual peptides were screened in triplicate
to confirm the response. Positive responses were defined
as those where the mean of the test wells exceeded the
99% confidence interval of replicates of six negative control wells.
CTL effector cell generation
Effector cells were prepared by in vitro stimulation of
thawed cryopreserved PBMC. Peptide pulsed (10 µg/ml
overnight), irradiated (10000 rad) autologous BLCL (2 ×
106 cells) were washed three times with CM and then cocultured with 10 – 20 × 106 PBMC in 10 ml CM supplemented with 5 ng/ml rhIL-7 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN) for 4 days. 5 ng/ml rhIL-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was then added to the co-cultures, and the cultures were maintained and split with fresh CM and rhIL-2
for up to 24 days. Effector cell lines were then maintained
by re-stimulation every 7–14 days with irradiated, peptide
pulsed, autologous BLCL and 5 ng/ml rhIL-2 in CM.
Chromium release assay for cytotoxic activity
CTL effector cells prepared as above were screened for
cytotoxic activity against peptide pulsed autologous or
partially HLA matched BLCL. BLCL (1 × 106) were incubated overnight with 10 µg/ml of relevant peptide in the
presence of 100 µCi of 51Cr-labelled sodium chromate
(NEN, Boston, MA) and then washed three times with
RPMI-1640 to remove excess 51Cr-sodium chromate and
peptide. Non-peptide pulsed BLCL served as the negative
control for cytotoxic activity. CTL activity was titrated at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/7/8

several effector to target (E:T) ratios and expressed as percentage of maximal specific lysis of 2500 51Cr-labelled target cells per well. Maximum release was determined by
lysis of 51Cr-labelled target cells with 5% SDS. Percent specific cytotoxicity was calculated using the formula: 100 ×
[(test release - spontaneous release)/(maximum release spontaneous release)]. Assays were considered valid if
spontaneous release was <30%. All assay tests were performed in triplicate and a specific activity of >10% was
considered to be positive.
Cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) assay
Cryopreserved PBMC were thawed rapidly, washed twice
with CM and either used immediately, or incubated at 2–
5 × 106 cells/ml in CM for 14–16 hours. PBMC were
added at 0.5 to 1.0 × 106 cells per well into 96 well polypropylene tissue culture trays and stimulated either
directly with SEB, or with autologous or allogeneic peptide-pulsed BLCL. BLCL were pulsed overnight with relevent peptide (10 µg/ml), washed five times after the
overnight incubation, and distributed at 1 × 105 cells per
well (ratio 10:1, PBMC:BLCL). As a positive control for
functional integrity of the cryopreserved cells, SEB was
added to a single well at 5 µg/ml final concentration. The
assays were incubated for 6 hours at 37°C (5% CO2) in
the presence of the protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin A
(10 µg/ml; Sigma, St.Louis, MO), and were then terminated by transfer to 4°C overnight. Cells were stained for
surface markers and intracellular IFNγ expression (CFC
assay) the following day. Co-cultured PBMC (prepared
above) were washed once with flow buffer (DPBS/0.1%
BSA/0.1% sodium azide) and incubated in the 96-well tissue culture tray wells for 10 minutes in 200 µl flow buffer
(containing 1 mM EDTA) at room temperature (same volume, temperature and base buffer used for all subsequent
washings and incubations). Cells were washed once, fixed
in 2% formaldehyde for 30 min and washed again. Fixed
cells were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin (Sigma, St.
Louis MO.) for 30 min, washed and resuspended in 0.5%
saponin containing the following monoclonal antibodies: FITC-conjugated anti-interferon-γ (clone 25723.11);
PE-conjugated anti-CD69 (clone L78); PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-CD8 (clone SK1); and APC-conjugated antiCD3 (clone SK7)(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After 30
min incubation, cells were washed three times with flow
buffer and finally re-suspended in 200 µl of flow buffer.
Stained cells were stored at 4°C and analyzed by flow
cytometry within 24 hours. Data acquisition was performed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Initial gating was performed using a
total lymphocyte gate based on forward and side scatter
characteristics and acquisition of 50, 000 – 200, 000 cells
within this gate. Color compensation was performed
using similarly prepared cells from an HIV-1 sero-negative
donor and staining singly labeled cells with anti-CD3

labeled with FITC, PE, PerCP-Cy5.5 and APC fluorochromes (BD Biosciences). Data sets were analyzed using
FlowJo software (version 4) (TreeStar, Cupertino, CA).
Test wells were considered positive if at least a two-fold
increase in gated positive events was detected compared
with the appropriate negative control. The mean background IFNγ positive CD8 T cells was 0.026% and 0.81%
for the media only controls and sham-pulsed BLCL
respectively.
