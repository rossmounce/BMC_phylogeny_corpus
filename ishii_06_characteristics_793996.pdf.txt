Abstract
Background: The ribosome is a central player in the translation system, which in mammals
consists of four RNA species and 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The control mechanisms of gene
expression and the functions of RPs are believed to be identical. Most RP genes have common
promoters and were therefore assumed to have a unified gene expression control mechanism.
Results: We systematically analyzed the homogeneity and heterogeneity of RP genes on the basis
of their expression profiles, promoter structures, encoded amino acid compositions, and codon
compositions. The results revealed that (1) most RP genes are coordinately expressed at the
mRNA level, with higher signals in the spleen, lymph node dissection (LND), and fetal brain.
However, 17 genes, including the P protein genes (RPLP0, RPLP1, RPLP2), are expressed in a tissuespecific manner. (2) Most promoters have GC boxes and possible binding sites for nuclear
respiratory factor 2, Yin and Yang 1, and/or activator protein 1. However, they do not have
canonical TATA boxes. (3) Analysis of the amino acid composition of the encoded proteins
indicated a high lysine and arginine content. (4) The major RP genes exhibit a characteristic
synonymous codon composition with high rates of G or C in the third-codon position and a high
content of AAG, CAG, ATC, GAG, CAC, and CTG.
Conclusion: Eleven of the RP genes are still identified as being unique and did not exhibit at least
some of the above characteristics, indicating that they may have unknown functions not present in
other RP genes. Furthermore, we found sequences conserved between human and mouse genes
around the transcription start sites and in the intronic regions. This study suggests certain overall
trends and characteristic features of human RP genes.

Background
The ribosome, which plays an important role in the translational mechanism, is universal to all organisms. Mammalian ribosomes consist of four RNA species and 79

ribosomal proteins (RPs) [1]. More than 2000 pseudogenes of RP genes are present in the human genome [2],
and this has made it difficult to gain an overview of this
gene family. However, we have already constructed a

ribosomal protein gene database (RPG) [3,4] that contains the genomic DNA and full-length cDNA sequences.
RPG also includes information on the transcription start
sites, amino acid sequences encoded, and intron/exon
structures, which has made it possible to conduct more
systematic and detailed analyses of the RP genes from
nine different eukaryotes.
In past studies, the control mechanisms of gene expression and RP functions were believed to be identical [5].
For example, most RP genes have common promoters [6]
and were therefore assumed to have a unified control
mechanism for gene expression [7]. Encoded amino acid
and synonymous codon compositions [8] and G+C content [9] are also known to be similar in all RP genes. However, at this point it is unknown how many RP genes share
typical features or which genes have specifically unique
features.
In contrast, the protein structure and transcription mechanisms of individual RP genes have come to be gradually
clarified through experimental investigation. In
Escherichia coli, most RP genes are crucial for ribosome
assembly, such as for the proteins implicated in the
bridges between two subunits (RPS13, RPS15, RPS19,
RPL2, RPL5, RPL14), contact with tRNA (RPS7, RPS9,
RPS12, RPS13, RPL1, RPL5), and the surrounding
polypeptide exit channel (RPL22, RPL24, RPL29) [10].
The presence of GC boxes [11] and binding sites for
nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) [12,13] and Yin and
Yang 1 (YY1) [14] as transcription factor binding sites
have been confirmed experimentally in the relevant RP
genes in mammals. The binding site for activator protein
1 (AP-1) has been found in the downstream region of the
transcription start site (TSS) of Entamoeba histolytica RPL10
[15]. A canonical TATA box is lacking near the TSS of the
RP genes [13]. In addition, RPs have been found to have
functions other than translation. It has been reported that
RPS3A controls cell growth and apoptosis [16]. RPL13A
controls translation silencing by itself [17]. Diverse RP
gene expression control in specific tissues has also been
reported using expressed sequence tag (EST) databases for
humans [18] and catfish [19]. Investigation of the features
of each RP gene has come to be one of the most important
tasks in elucidating gene function, but few studies to date
have used large-scale analysis to focus on the features of
RP genes. We systematically analyzed the homogeneity
and heterogeneity of RP genes on the basis of their expression profiles, promoter structures, encoded amino acid
compositions, and codon compositions. We then
attempted to extract the RP genes whose features differed
from the set of typical features.

Results
Expression profile
To investigate whether each RP gene expression pattern
was identical, we performed cluster analysis with a large
gene expression dataset (3281 genes, see Additional file
2). The RP gene expression patterns were classified into
four classes; Main cluster, Sub-cluster 1, Sub-cluster 2 and
the remaining 11 genes, which did not belong to any of
these clusters (Fig. 1A), based on both the dendrogram
generated by TreeView [20] and their expression patterns
similarities. Original data files (CDT and GTR) to allow a
reproduction of these clusters with dendrogram using the
software TreeView have been made available (see Additional files 3 and 4). The Main cluster contained 46 RP
genes, of which 28 encoded large subunit and 18 small
subunit proteins, corresponding to 73% of the RP genes
analyzed. These genes were relatively highly expressed in
spleen, fetal brain, and LND. Furthermore, two translation initiation factor subunits (EIF3S5 and EIF3S7), both
essential genes for translation machinery, were also
present in the Main cluster (Table 1). Sub-cluster 1 consisted of RPLP1 and RPLP2, which were highly expressed
in LND, keratinocytes, and skin. Sub-cluster 2 contained
RPS15A, RPS18, RPL29, and RPLP0, which were expressed
in skin, fetal brain, and spleen. Sub-cluster 2 was located
nearer to Sub-cluster 1 than to the Main cluster. Eleven RP
genes (RPS2, RPS4Y, RPS17, RPS24, RPS26, RPL6,
RPL27A, RPL28, RPL31, RPL32, and RPL35) did not
belong to any of these clusters. However, the expression
patterns of RPS2, RPS17, and RPL28 were similar to that
of the translation initiation factor EIF3S6, the translation
elongation factor EEF1G, the putative translation initiation factor SUI1, and the ribosome associated membrane
protein RAMP4. Furthermore, to investigate whether these
11 RP genes were expressed highly in different tissues than
the other RP genes, we performed Grubbs' test using
mRNA expression data (Fig. 1B). RPL35 was expressed
more highly than the other RP genes in heart, skeletal
muscle, uterus, small intestine, adipose tissue, fibroblasts,
and liver. Nine of the 11 RP genes were highly expressed
in tissues different from those showing the high levels of
expression of the other RP genes. Although differentially
expressed RP genes have been reported in humans [18],

we demonstrated other RP genes with specific expression
patterns. Bortoluzzi et al. (2001) analyzed expression profiles using the number of ESTs in UniGene [21]. On the
other hand, our data was based on gene expression levels
as measured by RT-PCR.
Prediction of transcription factor binding sites
We investigated the commonality and specificity of transcription initiation factors in the RP gene family by
observing transcription factor binding sites (Fig. 2).
Because our prediction was supported by phylogenetic
footprinting between human and mouse, we expected
that the candidates might possess higher reliability. Four
promoters â NRF-2, GC box, YY1, and AP-1 â had already
been demonstrated to have transcriptional activity in RP
genes [6,11-15]. We found 95 binding sites for NRF-2 in
48 RP genes (Fig. 3). Most of the binding sites were
located -80 bp to +20 bp from the TSS. Eighty GC boxes
were found in 53 RP genes in upstream regions from -100
bp to -1 bp. Thirty binding sites for YY1 were found in 27
RP genes in downstream regions from +1 bp to +40 bp.
There were 111 binding sites for AP-1 in 56 RP genes in
upstream regions from -60 bp to -1 bp. On the other
hand, only nine RP genes had TATA boxes, and seven
(RPS18, RPS26, RPS27, RPS28, RPL10, RPL36A, and
RPLP0) of these were predicted to have TATA boxes
between -40 bp and -21 bp from the TSS in the upstream
region. Nine RP genes had binding sites for all transcription factors. Twenty-nine RP genes had binding sites for
three transcription factors, 22 had binding sites for two,
and 19 had binding sites for one (Fig. 2). All RP genes
were found to contain at least one transcription factor
binding site. These data indicate that the common transcription factor binding sites in the RP genes were the GC
box and the binding sites for NRF-2, YY1, and AP-1. In
addition, we tried to find unknown transcription factor
binding sites other than NRF-2, GC box, YY1, and AP-1 in
the upstream regions of ribosomal protein genes. However, although a number were found, we did not consider
them as actual sites, because we could not observe any
specificity of these candidates for the RP genes.
Amino acid composition
We analyzed the amino acids encoded by RP genes and
classified the genes into groups by a clustering method.
We performed cluster analysis using 80 human RP genes
and 3000 genes selected randomly from RefSeq [21,22]
(Fig. 4 and see also Additional files 6 and 7). The RP genes
were divided into four classes: Main cluster, Sub-cluster 1,
Sub-cluster 2, and others, based on both the dendrogram
generated by TreeView and the similarities of amino acid
composition. Sixty-two RP genes were present in the Main
cluster. RPLP1 and RPLP2 were present in Sub-cluster 1
and RPS29, RPL36A, RPL37, RPL37A, and RPL39 were
present in Sub-cluster 2. RPSA, RPS3, RPS5, RPS12,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/37

RPS21, RPS26, RPS27, RPS28, RPLP0, RPL14, and RPL41
did not belong to any of these clusters.
The average frequencies of lysine (0.13) and arginine
(0.097) were highest of all the amino acids in the RPs.
Lysine and arginine are basic amino acids. The frequencies
of lysine and arginine in the Main cluster proteins were
higher than those of the other 18 amino acids. The frequencies of lysine and arginine in the proteins encoded by
RPLP1 and RPLP2 of Sub-cluster 1 were lower than their
average frequencies in the proteins encoded by Main cluster genes.
The average frequencies of tryptophan (0.0077), cysteine
(0.015), histidine (0.023) and methionine (0.026) were
lowest of all the amino acids in RPs. Tryptophan, cysteine
and methionine are neutral amino acids. This tendency
was demonstrated more potently in proteins encoded by
Sub-cluster 1 genes and less so in proteins encoded by
Sub-cluster 2 genes.
Synonymous codon composition
To evaluate which RP genes had come under similar selective pressure in the evolutionary process, we performed
cluster analysis of the synonymous codon composition
using the 80 human RP genes and 3000 genes randomly
selected from RefSeq (Fig. 5 and see also Additional files
9 and 10). We found that the codon composition of the
RP genes was divided into four classes (Main cluster, Subcluster 1, Sub-cluster 2, and Others), based on both the
dendrogram generated by TreeView and the similarities of
codon composition. Fifty-nine RP genes belonged to the
Main cluster. In these RP genes the frequencies of AAG,
CAG, ATC, GAG, CAC, and CTG were higher than those of
any other codons. RPS3A, RPS4Y, RPS6, RPL4, and RPL5
were present in Sub-cluster 1. RPS4X, an isoform of
RPS4Y, belong to the Main cluster, although they have
similar amino acid composition.

In these RP genes the frequencies of GAT, GAA, CAG,
AAG, GCT, ACT, and CAT were higher than those of any
other
codons.
RPSA,
RPS13,RPL17,RPS23,RPS25,RPS27A,RPL7,RPL9,RPL14,
and RPL21 were present in Sub-cluster 2. The frequencies
of AAG, CAG, TAT, GAA, GTT, ATT, GAT, AAT, CAC, and
CTG were higher than those of any other codons.
AAG and CAG were frequently observed in all three clusters. The high frequency usage of these codons may be a
common feature of RP genes. Codons with G or C in the
third codon position were observed frequently in the
Main cluster, distinguishing the Main cluster from Subcluster 1 and Sub-cluster 2. Furthermore, RPS15, RPS29,
RPL3,RPL28, RPL39, and RPL41 did not belong to any
cluster.

Forty-nine RP genes in the Main cluster on synonymous

cluster on amino acid composition analysis. Nine RP
genes belonged to the Main cluster in terms of only the

Main cluster in terms of only synonymous codon composition.

Discussion
BODYMAP expression profile data
The available human BODYMAP data obtained from the
website [23,24] was already normalized in 30 human tissues. We downloaded all the data from the website and
treated all of the data equally.

Page 8 of 16

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:37

To evaluate the accuracy of our expression profile analysis,
we made a comparison of BODYMAP expression profile
data with mouse microarray data [25], downloaded from
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [26,27]. This mouse
microarray data included 69 RP genes, and we observed
one large RP gene cluster consisting of 39 genes in the
expression profiles. We were also able to find a further 30
genes which did not belong to the cluster. Fifty-three of 69
RP genes in the mouse microarray data are included in the
human BODYMAP data. In both datasets, 22 of 53 RP
genes belong to the Main cluster and 10 of 53 RP genes
did not. Therefore, the classification of more than 60 %
(32 of 53 genes) of the genes with RP gene expression patterns was consistent between the two clustering analyses.
Although the number of genes, species, type of tissues,
and clustering method are different in the production of
these two datasets, the classification of more than 60% of
the RP genes was correspondence. Since the microarray
data was measured by the ratio of the hybridization signal
for each gene, it could vary by factors of 2 or greater. For
such reasons, the expression level of each gene could not
be compared. On the other hand, as the BODYMAP data
was measured with PCR-based expression profiling
method, it does indicate the relative concentration of gene
transcripts in 30 human tissues. Therefore, tissue specific
RP gene expression pattern can be determined by the
BODYMAP data (Figure 1B). A similar bioinformatics
approach the RP gene expression pattern has been performed by Bortoluzzi et. al. [18]. However, as their data
was prepared from the public database UniGene, i.e.,
using assembled EST data recorded by many researchers,
these data was not collected under the same conditions.
They were able to observe specific RP gene expression patterns, but not RP genes with similar expression patterns.
On the other hand, as our prepared BODYMAP data was
measured under the same condition by one laboratory
team (Okubo et. al.), we consider that BODYMAP data to
be suitable for cluster analyses of the RP genes. For a better
understanding of the BODYMAP data, we have provided
the original data files (see Additional files 2, 3 and 4).
Features of the major RP genes
From the results of our four analyses (expression profile,
promoter prediction, encoded amino acids, and codon
composition) we created a list of 80 human RP genes in
rank order to form a "Feature Index" (FI) (Table 2). At
least 24 RP genes with a FI of less than 1.0 in the list can
be regarded as containing the features of the major RP
genes. On the other hand, we consider RP genes with high
FI scores to be specific RP genes.

The features of the major RP genes gradually became clear
to us from the four analyses. We were thus able to make
the following four points in relation to typical features.
(1) In the spleen, LND, and fetal brain the major RP genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/37

are highly expressed; the control mechanism of regulation
in these tissues might be different at the post-transcription
level as reported in previous study [19]. (2) Major RP
genes have GC boxes and possible binding sites for NRF2, YY1, and/or AP-1. However, they do not have canonical
TATA boxes. The AP-1 transcription factor is mainly composed of Jun, Fos and ATF protein dimers, which are
thought to regulate the processes of proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and transformation [28,29]. Their
activity was confirmed in Entamoeba histolytica RPL10 [15]
and their homologues were confirmed in mammals.
Moreover, since their consensus sequence of the human
AP-1 binding site (CGTGAGTCATG) was similar to that of
Entamoeba histolytica RPL10 [15], the existence of the AP-1
transcription factor binding sites can also be putatively
accepted in human RP genes. Though analyzed in detail,
we observed no clear relationship between the results of
the expression profile analysis and promoter prediction.
(3) The major RP genes show a characteristic encoded
amino acid composition of high lysine and arginine content. RPs, which interact with rRNA in the ribosome complex, has been suggested to have many arginines and
lysines on the surface. (4) Major RP genes show a characteristic synonymous codon composition with a high rate
of G or C in the third codon position and a high content
of AAG, CAG, ATC, GAG, CAC, and CTG. It is believed
that the species and number of tRNAs in the genome
influence the compositional bias for codon selection [30].
Although the features noted here for the major RP genes
were what had already been believed in general, these
results confirm the major features of the RP genes within
a whole set. Moreover, our results have revealed that RP
genes that do not belong to the major groups do exist
among the 80 RP genes; the unique features of these genes
should prove useful to the field for the course of further
study.
Features of specific RP genes
At least 12 RP genes with a FI score of greater than 2.1 can
be regarded as specific RP genes. Their unique features are
listed in table 3 and discussed in detail in the following
sections.
RPLP0, RPLP1, RPLP2
Animals, insect, fungi and protozoans possess three
classes of acidic ribosomal P proteins: RPLP0, RPLP1 and
RPLP2 [31-33]. It is reported that the heterodimers of
RPLP1Î±/RPLP2Î² and RPLP1Î²/RPLP2Î± form stalk in the
60S large subunit with RPLP0 in the yeast [34]. On the
other hand, the heterodimer of RPLP1 and RPLP2 form
stalk in the silkworm [32]. P protein complex binds to the
GTPase domain of rat 28 S rRNA in a buffer containing
Mg2+ [35]. It is also known that phosphorylated P proteins
interact with elongation factor EF-2 in the rat [36,37].

The feature index (FI) is a quantitative measure of the heterogeneity in an individual RP gene. Expression profile, amino acids encoded, and
synonymous codon composition: a value of 1 was given to genes that did not belong to the Main cluster. TATA box: a value of 1 was given to genes
that had TATA boxes. Common promoter: the maximum value was set as 0.4, because no obvious clusters were found for the analysis of promoter
prediction. Then, if a binding site for one of four common transcription factors (nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF), GC boxes (GC), Yin and Yang
1 (YY), and activator protein 1 (AP)) was found, a value of 0.1 was subtracted. The columns "Expression profile cluster", "Amino acid encoding
cluster", and "Synonymous codon frequency cluster" indicate the clusters to which RP genes were assigned as a result of each analysis. M: Main
cluster; S1: Sub-cluster 1; S2: Sub-cluster 2; O: Other. The column "TATA box" indicates the existence of a TATA box, Y: Yes, N: No. For example,
FI 3.3 of RPLP0 was calculated as follows; +1.0 (Expression profile), +1.0 (Amino acid encoding cluster), +0 (Synonymous codon frequency), +1.0
(TATA box), +0.4 -0.1 (Predicted Transcription Factors bound).

Interestingly, RPLP1 and RPLP2 have their own specific
characteristics on both expression profiling and amino
acid composition by our analyses. In our expression profile, RPLP1 and RPLP2 were highly co-expressed in LND
and keratinocytes, forming a sub-cluster. As only RPLP1
and RPLP2 form dimers in the silkworm, they may have
gene expression machinery different from those of the
other RP genes. In addition, they also belonged to the
same sub-cluster in the study of encoded amino acid composition. In this cluster, the average frequencies of
encoded lysine and arginine were lower than for the main
RP genes, indicating a possible cause for the RPLP1 and
RPLP2 location "stalk" in the ribosome complex.
Although the P protein conformation is constructed from
three proteins, interestingly, RPLP0 did not belong to the
Main cluster or Sub-cluster 1 (which contained only
RPLP1 and RPLP2) in either the expression profile or
amino acid composition studies. RPLP0 was predicted to
have a TATA box in the upstream region of TSS. Therefore,
this may indicate that RPLP0 is a specific gene not only for
P proteins but also for the RP gene family. On the other
hand, because all three P protein genes belonged to the
Main cluster in the study of synonymous codon composition, evolutionarily they might have been affected by
selective pressure on codon usage along with other RP
genes. From these results, we conclude that RPLP0, RPLP1,

and RPLP2 are unique and specific genes compared with
the major RP genes, but that these P protein genes are
members of the RP gene family.
RPL41
RPL41 was one of the RP genes with higher specificity (FI
= 2.1). The coding sequence (CDS) size of human RPL41
was shortest (78 bp) among all the RP genes, the average
size being 521 bp. Human RPL41 was independent from
the Main cluster in terms of the encoded amino acid composition (Fig. 4) and synonymous codon composition
(Fig. 5), although we applied codon usage data less
affected by amino acid composition [38]. On the specificities of synonymous codon composition, we calculated
the GC3 level (the frequency of G or C in the third codon
position) in light of the suggestion that the short length of
RPL41 could have biased the synonymous codon composition. The average GC3 level in human RP genes was
53.1%. In contrast, the GC3 level of RPL41 was 23.1%, the
lowest of all the RP genes. Therefore, it is likely that the
specificities of synonymous codon composition was
scarcely affected by biased amino acid composition, or by
the shortness of RPL41, but rather, was solely affected by
differential evolutionary pressure unlike the other RP
genes. Removal of yeast RPL41 did not affect the ratio of
60 S to 40 S subunits, but it did reduce the amount of 80

S, suggesting that RPL41 was involved in ribosomal subunit association [39]. As RPL41 is known to be dispensable
in yeast [39], we consider it possible that human RPL41
also helps solely in association with ribosomal subunits.
Although human RPL41 is known as one of the RP genes,
our data indicates that it may not be a typical RP gene.
Other specific RP genes
The FIs of RPSA, RPS6, RPS18, RPS26, RPS27, RPS29,
RPL5, RPL14, RPL28, and RPL36A were higher than those
of the other RP genes. Some of these RP genes had specificity in terms of the amino acids encoded, with lower frequencies of encoded lysine (RPS26, RPS29), arginine
(RPL14), or both (RPSA, RPS27). In addition, RPL14 contains an array of 10 repeats of the trinucleotide GCT that
encodes a polyalanine tract in the 3'-flanking sequence. As
this polyalanine is conserved only in humans and mice,
this characteristic sequence would seem to have been
inserted in RPL14 during the evolution of these species.
RPS26 did not belong to any cluster in either the expression profile or the encoded amino acid composition
study. Moreover, it was predicted not to have the four typical promoters, but to contain the TATA box. Interestingly,

it was found to belong to the Main cluster in the study of
synonymous codon composition, indicating that RPS26,
like the other RP genes, was affected by selective pressure
on codon usage during the course of evolution. Consequently, these specificities suggest that these RP genes may
have functions in addition to translation of which we are
not yet aware.
Conserved regions in mouse RP genes
Conserved regions with lengths of over 100 bp were
found in regions upstream of the TSS in the following RP
genes: RPS2, RPS4X, RPS7, RPS10, RPS12, RPS14,
RPS18,RPS23, RPS27A, RPS30, RPL6, RPL7, RPL10,
RPL15, RPL17, RPL18, RPL19, RPL21, RPL22, RPL26,
RPL27A, RPL32, RPL35, RPL35A, RPL36A, RPL40, and
RPLP1. Most importantly, 14 RP genes were found to have
conserved upstream regions of over 100 bp adjacent to the
TSS. Conserved intronic regions with lengths of over 100
bp
were
found
in
RPS3,RPS6,RPS8,RPS19,RPS27,RPL7,RPL22,RPL23A, and
RPL30. Moreover, there were no transcription factor binding sites in RPS6 and RPL23A, suggesting that these
intronic regions were conserved because of the existence

Page 12 of 16

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:37

of the following characteristics: (1) specific regulatory elements; (2) small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), a type of
non-coding RNA; (3) repetitive elements such as transposons; and (4) unidentified alternative exons. We confirmed that the conserved intronic region in RPS8
contains snoRNA, which functions in Box C/D 2'-O-methylation, from +289 bp to +368 bp [9]. For this reason,
these conserved regions are likely to have certain biological functions.
Synonymous codon bias in RP genes
In E. coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Caenorhabditis
elegans, the synonymous codon is highly biased according
to the tRNA-gene copy numbers [30]. On the other hand,
in Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens, codon composition is influenced largely by the number of GC-dinucleotides, rather than by the selective pressure on codon
usage attributable to the number of tRNAs [30]. Furthermore, in higher vertebrates such as humans, a major factor
contributing to codon usage is the variation in the longrange GC level, the isochore [30]. We conducted principal
component analysis only for the RP genes in E. coli, Methanococcus jannaschii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,C. elegans, D.
melanogaster, and H. sapiens with codon usage data, called
relative adaptiveness (W) [40]. The results indicated
homogeneity of codon composition in the RP genes of E.
coli, M. jannaschii, S. cerevisiae, and C. elegans (see Additional file 1). Therefore, most of the RP genes in these species were affected by translational selection. On the other
hand, heterogeneity of codon composition was observed
in the RP genes of D. melanogaster and H. sapiens [30].
These results are also consistent with the results of our
cluster analysis of codon composition; many RP genes
(26%) did not belong to the Main cluster (Fig. 5). These
results imply that the number of RP genes affected by different selective pressures increased gradually during the
evolutionary process from prokaryote to human. Because
higher eukaryotes may have gained several factors such as
the isochore, the influence of codon bias has become
weaker with evolution.

Conclusion
Each RP is a part of a huge RNP complex. Until recently,
RP genes were suggested to have a unified control mechanism for transcription and translation. In this study,
human RP genes show the following heterogeneity: (1)
RP genes show a divided cluster for their gene expression
level and some RP genes show tissue-specificity; (2) each
RP gene is controlled by different regulators; (3) the optimal amino acids are different in some RP genes; (4) the
optimal codon are different in some RP genes. These
results demonstrate that RPs have individual characteristics. It can be suggested that certain RP genes have the
potential to carry out extra-ribosomal functions as independent polypeptides.

This study to the best of our knowledge is the first attempt
to investigate the overall trends in human RP genes. We
anticipate elucidating the detailed functions of the RP
genes in the future.

Methods
Materials
We obtained human and mouse full-length cDNA,
genomic DNA, and encoded amino acid sequences from
the RPG database [3,4]. Because human RPS4 is encoded
on both the X and Y chromosomes, we considered them
as two individual RP genes, RPS4X and RPS4Y. We therefore defined the total number of RP genes, including
these, as 80. mRNA expression data were obtained from
BODYMAP [23,24], and quantified in 30 tissues by introduced amplified fragment length polymorphism (iAFLP)
[41]. Human nucleotide and amino acid sequences,
except for those of the RP genes, were collected from RefSeq [21,22].
Analysis of expression profiles
To investigate the expression profiles, we prepared a total
of 3281 gene expression data including those for 63 RP
genes from BODYMAP. The RP gene primers used to generate the expression data were verified by comparing their
sequences with the corresponding full-length cDNA
sequences. The expression levels of 3284 genes were analyzed by hierarchical clustering using Cluster 3.0 software
[42] and Java TreeView 1.0.12 [20] with centroid linkage.
The clustering algorithm applies equal weight to each
gene expression data in all tissues. To find differentially
expressed RP genes, these data were standardized by Ztransformation and classified by outlier analyses (P <
0.05, Grubbs' test).
Prediction of transcription factor binding sites
We predicted possible transcription factor binding sites
using the human/mouse phylogenetic footprinting
method. The 5' flanking regions located between -500 and
+500 bp of the TSS of 79 RP genes were analyzed. The
position of TSS was determined by comparison of the fulllength cDNAs and genomic sequences [9]. The human
sliding window (50 bp) was moved 10 bp downstream to
the same region in the mouse ortholog and the process
repeated to calculate individual identities. The identity in
the window was given the maximum alignment score by
ClustalW [43] in each position of the mouse RP genes.
The window conserved between mouse and human (identity > 60%) was targeted for predicting transcription factor
binding sites in order to eliminate false positives. We used
MatInspector version 2.1 [44]/ TRANSFAC 3.1 [45] with
the default parameters to predict known promoters. We
applied the values of parameters, which were relaxed criteria, to predict possible transcription binding sites. We
searched possible binding sites that had already been

reported in several RP genes, including a GC box (NRGGGGCGGGGCNK),
a
TATA
box
(STATAAAWRNNNNNN), and binding sites for NRF-2
(ACCGGAAGNS), YY1 (NNNCGGCCATCTTGNCTSNW),
and AP-1 (RSTGACTNMNW). We allowed only the 5'-to3' direction in prediction of the TATA box and both directions for the other sites.
Analysis of amino acid and synonymous codon
composition
We prepared 3000 amino acid sequences randomly
selected from RefSeq (excluding RP genes) and 80 amino
acid sequences encoded by RP genes (see Additional file
5). Amino acid composition was calculated by adapting
relative amino acid usage (RAAU). We performed hierarchical clustering from the score by using Cluster 3.0 software [42] with centroid linkage. The dendrogram was
generated by Java TreeView 1.0.12 [20]. In the analysis of
synonymous codon composition, the 3000 randomly
selected ORFs from RefSeq (excluding RP genes) and 80
nucleotide sequences of the RP genes were prepared for
clustering (see Additional file 8). Codon usage data,
termed relative adaptiveness (W) by Sharp and Li, was calculated from the relative synonymous codon usage
(RSCU) [40].
