Abstract

Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for numerous
organisms that belong to the three domains of life. The most
relevant biological form of selenium is the rare amino acid
selenocysteine (Sec), the selenium analog of cysteine (Cys).
Sec is co-translationally incorporated into protein [1-3]. In

functionally characterized selenoproteins, Sec is the catalytic
group in the active site and is directly involved in redox catalysis. It is thought that Sec confers a functional advantage over
cysteine at these active sites, increasing the catalytic efficiency of the enzymes [4]. Despite this selective advantage,
the set of selenoproteins in any given organism is small [5,6].

Background

Conclusion: These results provide evidence for the ancient origin of these traits, their
independent maintenance, and a highly dynamic evolutionary process that can be explained as the
result of speciation, differential gene loss and HGT. The latter demonstrated that the loss of these
traits is not irreversible as previously thought.

refereed research

Results: We analyzed completely sequenced genomes for occurrence of the selA, B, C, D and ybbB
genes. We found that selB and selC are gene signatures for the Sec-decoding trait. However, selD
is also present in organisms that do not utilize Sec, and shows association with either selA, B, C and/
or ybbB. Thus, selD defines the overall selenium utilization. A global species map of Sec-decoding
and 2-selenouridine synthesis traits is provided based on the presence/absence pattern of seleniumutilization genes. The phylogenies of these genes were inferred and compared to organismal
phylogenies, which identified horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events involving both traits.

deposited research

Background: The essential trace element selenium is used in a wide variety of biological
processes. Selenocysteine (Sec), the 21st amino acid, is co-translationally incorporated into a
restricted set of proteins. It is encoded by an UGA codon with the help of tRNASec (SelC), Secspecific elongation factor (SelB) and a cis-acting mRNA structure (SECIS element). In addition, Sec
synthase (SelA) and selenophosphate synthetase (SelD) are involved in the biosynthesis of Sec on
the tRNASec. Selenium is also found in the form of 2-selenouridine, a modified base present in the
wobble position of certain tRNAs, whose synthesis is catalyzed by YbbB using selenophosphate as
a precursor.

Romero et al.

Sec is inserted into selenoproteins at in-frame UGA codons
(usually termination codons) by tRNASec (SelC) [2,7]. Interpretation of UGA as Sec requires translational reprogramming, which is provided by the Sec insertion sequence
(SECIS) element, a cis-acting stem-loop structure present in
the selenoprotein mRNA [2]. The decoding of Sec in bacteria
also involves a Sec-specific elongation factor (SelB) which
binds GTP, the SECIS element and the tRNASec [8,9]. In
eukaryotes, this function is carried out by two proteins: EFSec and SECIS-binding protein (SBP2). EF-Sec is a Sec-specific elongation factor, distantly related to bacterial SelB, that
binds GTP, tRNASec and SBP2; this latter protein, in turn,
binds the SECIS element [10]. Sec synthesis is the other part
of the metabolic pathway required for biosynthesis of selenoproteins. It takes place on tRNASec, which is first aminoacylated with serine (by a canonical seryl-tRNA synthetase)
and then modified to selenocysteinyl-tRNA, in the reaction
that uses selenophosphate as the selenium donor [9]. In the
Bacteria, this reaction is catalyzed by Sec synthase (SelA). The
functional equivalent of SelA in Archaea and Eukarya has not
been described. A phosphoseryl-tRNASec kinase (PSTK) has
been recently identified only in eukaryotic and archaeal Secincorporating organisms [11]. It has been suggested that this
protein can play a role in Sec biosynthesis and/or regulation.
The synthesis of selenophosphate is catalyzed by selenophosphate synthetase (SelD) from ATP and selenide in both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Selenophosphate has also been described as a precursor for
the last step of the synthesis of the modified base 5-methylaminomethyl-2-selenouridine in the wobble position of the
anticodons of Lys, Glu and Gln tRNAs [12], and this reaction
was reported to be catalyzed by YbbB in Escherichia coli [13].
The function of this modified base is not known.
Thus, considerable efforts in recent years have been made to
elucidate molecular details of Sec decoding in the three
domains of life. In addition, the selenoproteome of several
species has been the subject of intensive research [5,6,14-16].
Despite this progress, fundamental issues relating to the evolution of Sec utilization remain unclear. On the basis of the
complexity and similarity of the Sec-insertion mechanisms in

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/8/R66

different organisms, it has been proposed that the Sec-decoding trait arose once, before the division of the three domains
of life, and was subsequently lost in some lineages. It is also
thought that once an organism has lost the Sec-insertion system, it cannot re-emerge. Whether the Sec biosynthesis and
insertion pathway evolved before the fixation of the genetic
code or whether this was a late addition is not known [17-19].
Here we provide a map of Sec-incorporating and selenouridine-utilizing organisms within the tree of life, based on the
analysis of completely sequenced genomes. From phylogenetic analysis of all components of the Sec-decoding machinery, we present clear evidence for the loss of the trait in many
lineages at different taxonomic levels, and examples of acquisition of the trait by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In addition, we describe and explain the maintenance of
selenophosphate synthetase in non-Sec-incorporating organisms, and use this information to define a selenouridine-utilization trait as well as a general selenium-utilization trait. We
find that the 2-selenouridine pathway can also be acquired by
HGT. These data suggest that the loss of selenium utilization
is not irreversible.

Results
A map of selenium utilization within the tree of life
Figure 1 displays a phylogenetic tree, based on rRNA, of the
155 species whose entire genomes have been sequenced (see
Materials and methods for the rationale behind the use of
rRNA and other alternatives). The criteria for the occurrence
of the Sec-decoding trait included the presence of known
genes involved in Sec decoding (that is, selA, selB, selC, selD),
and at least one gene encoding a known selenoprotein in the
genome, inferred by the presence of a UGA codon within a
coding region (at the location corresponding to Cys in
homologs) followed by a downstream SECIS element. Using
these criteria, a total of 29 bacterial and three archaeal species
were found to be Sec decoding. These criteria were in agreement with experimental evidence when available. A map of
selA, selB, selC and selD within the species tree is provided in
Figure 1.

Figure 1 (see selenium-utilization traits
Distribution offollowing page)
Distribution of selenium-utilization traits. The figure depicts the species tree for all organisms completely sequenced so far, based on the phylogenetic
reconstruction using the small subunit rRNA sequences and is in good agreement with other consensus phylogenetic trees. Species able to decode Sec are
those possessing selA (yellow) (excluding Archaea), selB (blue), selC (green) and selD (red). The presence of ybbB (gray) and selD indicates the ability to
synthesize 2-selenouridine.

Romero et al.

Despite the bias among the prokaryotic genomes so far
sequenced [20], in which proteobacteria are over-represented and some phyla are not represented at all, the taxa distribution of Sec incorporation revealed interesting features of
this trait. First, the trait is widely distributed and present in
numerous bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, Actinobacteria, Aquificae). Second, we observed the
presence and absence of the trait in taxa within monophyletic
groups. This phenomenon takes place within clades at different evolutionary levels, namely phylum, class, order, family,
genera, and even species and is illustrated in Figure 1. Considering the genus level, we observed this phenomenon within
Pseudomonas, Treponema, Clostridium and Yersinia. The
more revealing case of this absence/presence pattern is that
of the KIM, biovar Mediaevalis and CO92 strains of Yersinia
pestis. Whereas the KIM strain possesses a functional Secdecoding machinery, the CO92 and Mediaevalis strains carry
a confirmed sequenced selB pseudogene, whose coding
region is disrupted by a frameshift [21]. Furthermore, the
CO92 and the Mediaevalis strains possess selA, selC and selD,
indicating that the loss of the ability to decode Sec is very
recent. Moreover, at position 203 of the α-subunit of formate
dehydrogenase type O there is a UGA codon in the three
strains, which is decoded as Sec by the KIM strain, but could
not be decoded as such in the CO92 and the Mediaevalis
strains. The three strains also possess formate dehydrogenase
type H with a Cys-containing α-subunit (fdhH).
SelB and selC can be considered as the gene signature of
organisms able to decode Sec: their presence in genomes
always coincides with that of selA (excluding archaeal and
eukaryote domains), selD, and selenoproteins. A putative
ortholog of selA is present in Helicobacter pylori (a Sec-nonincorporating organism). The presence of this protein in the
two strains of this species is intriguing and raises the question
of whether this protein serves a different function or is just a
remnant of the Sec-decoding machinery. The case of selD is
different, because it is present in several species that lack
other genes necessary for Sec decoding. SelD orthologs are
indicated in red in Figure 1.

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/8/R66

Bacteria possessing selD but not the Sec-decoding trait
include Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pseudomonas syringae,
Porphyromonas gingivalis, Nitrosomonas europaea, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and Enterococcus faecalis. In addition, two cyanobacteria - Prochlorococcus marinus and
Synechococcus species - possess a putative selD homolog
with a 320-amino-acid amino-terminal extension with similarity to NADH dehydrogenases. All selDs from non-Secincorporating bacteria, excluding those of cyanobacteria, are
likely to be 'true orthologs' to selD from Sec-incorporating
bacteria because the topology of the selD phylogeny parallels
the topology of species for both Sec-incorporating and nonSec-incorporating species (Figure 2d), and because the
sequence signatures of bacterial selD are present and are of
similar length (see Additional data files). Although it is difficult to sketch an evolutionary history for the selD from cyanobacteria, it is clear that these proteins have many features of
selDs and could be viewed as true selenophosphate synthetases (see below).
The fact that selenophosphate is also the precursor for the
synthesis of 2-selenouridine [12], a modified base that is
present at the wobble position of Lys, Glu and Gln tRNAs,
suggests that selD may have been maintained in these organisms to generate selenophosphate for 2-selenouridine synthesis. Thus, we investigated the distribution of ybbB, a gene
encoding the catalyst of the last step of 2-selenouridine synthesis [13], and its association with selD.
A search across genomes for ybbB (indicated in gray in Figure
1) revealed that six out of seven selD-containing and non-Secdecoding species also contained ybbB. In addition, all ybbBcontaining organisms also possess selD, including cyanobacteria. Furthermore, in most of these species, except P. gingivalis and cyanobacteria, both genes are located contiguously
and arranged in an operon (Figure 3), as has been previously
suggested [13]. This gene organization is also seen in some
species that incorporate Sec and possess ybbB: selD is contiguous to ybbB in some genomes, but is rarely contiguous to the
selA-selB operon (Figure 3).

The analysis of selA, selB, selC, selD and ybbB genes also
revealed that, within the set of species that incorporate Sec,
many, but not all, organisms, possess ybbB and vice versa. In
other words, the set of species that incorporate Sec into protein overlaps with, but is different from, the set of species that
possess ybbB (Figure 1). It is important to note that a lowidentity homolog to bacterial ybbB is present in Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanopyrus kandleri, and absent in
other archaea, suggesting that this base modification might
not be unique to bacteria.
Finally, we investigated the presence of additional genes
linked to the selenouridine synthesis trait by searching
genomes for genes that occur in organisms possessing ybbB
and are absent in organisms lacking ybbB. This search did not
identify any additional gene associated with this trait. Thus,
the overall analysis allows us to corroborate that the two
products of these genes form a pathway with 2-selenouridine
in the tRNA as the final product. However, only ybbB is the
gene signature of this trait. On the other hand, the dual use of
selenophosphate (for Sec decoding and 2-selenouridine biosynthesis) makes selD a signature of a broader trait of selenium utilization, and our data suggest that both Sec decoding
and selenouridine traits are independently maintained, but
both require selD.

Phylogeny of selA, selB, selC, selD and ybbB: evidence of
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of Sec-decoding and
selenouridine synthesis traits
The phylogenies of selA, selB, selC, selD and ybbB shown in
Figure 2 are neither mutually coherent nor match the 'species
tree' (Figure 1). This does not necessarily imply an error in the
phylogenetic reconstruction since the evolutionary history of
each gene could be different. Many nodes are mutually consistent across different methods and have high statistical support. Certain anomalous situations occur with distantly
related organisms (deep nodes), which could be due to the
limitations of these analyses. However, some of the inconsistencies may be considered as 'genuine' and raise HGT as the
most likely alternative explanation.
A striking observation is the clustering of P. profundum (a γproteobacterium) with T. denticola (a spirochete) at a basal
position of the selA, selB and selC trees. This topology is consistent in various phylogenetic reconstruction methods and
has high statistical support in all cases. The congruence of the
trees sustains the idea that these genes were horizontally
transferred to P. profundum. Several facts provide further
support for this proposition. The P. profundum genome
encodes four selenoproteins: two glycine reductases A, one
glycine reductase B and selenophosphate synthetase. This
selenoproteome is entirely distinct from that of γ-proteobacteria and very similar to that of T. denticola, which consists of
glycine reductase A, two glycine reductases B, selenophosphate synthetase, glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin.
Furthermore, glycine reductase is absent in every other pro-

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/8/R66

teobacterial genome. In addition, P. profundum is the single
prokaryotic genome that has two selDs: one encodes a Seccontaining isoform that is located next to the selAB operon,
on chromosome II; the second encodes a Cys-containing
enzyme that is adjacent to ybbB on chromosome I. The phylogeny of selD places the Cys isoform within the γ-proteobacterial clade as expected according to the organismal
phylogeny, whereas the Sec isoform does not cluster with T.
denticola or with γ-proteobacteria. Altogether, these results
indicate that it is highly unlikely that P. profundum has
acquired the Sec-decoding trait by vertical descent, raising
HGT as the obvious alternative. In addition, we analyzed the
codon usage of selA and selB, looking for an anomalous pattern, using the method described by García-Vallvé [22]. These
genes do not display biased values of codon usage with
respect to the rest of the genes. This result could indicate that
P. profundum has already adapted the codon usage of these
genes to its internal values. A recent paper suggested that the
compatible codon usage between foreign genes and recipient
genomes increases the probability of HGT [23]. Since T. denticola and P. profundum do not share the same environment,
it is likely that the HGT took place from a species of spirochete, a bacterial phylum exhibiting great variability in habitat and physiology [24].
An additional incongruence is observed when the selA, selB,
selC and the species trees are compared among Pseudomomas spp. (γ-proteobacteria), Sinorhizobium meliloti (α-proteobacterium) and Burkholderia spp. (β-proteobacteria)
(Figure 2). The evolutionary history of these genes is, however, difficult to solve.
Conflicts relating to the selenouridine synthesis trait were
also observed. The consistent and statistically supported cluster between Bordetella bronchiseptica (a β-proteobacterium)
and Pseudomonas spp., within the γ-proteobacteria clade in
both selD and ybbB gene trees, strongly suggests an event of
HGT from Pseudomonas spp. to B. bronchiseptica. A situation that cannot be explained by vertical descent is also the
cluster of Nitrosomonas europae (a β-proteobacterium) and
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (δ-proteobacteria) in selD and
ybbB phylogenies (Figure 2). The location of ybbB and selD
genes also supports this possibility: while arranged in an
operon in N. europeae and B. bacteriovorus; they are distant
in the genomes of the other δ-proteobacteria (Figure 3). Furthermore, B. bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium with a
multiplication phase within many Gram-negative bacteria
[25]. Thus, the ready access to the prey's genetic information
and vice versa might be a possible explanation for this HGT
event.

Discussion

The distribution of the Sec-decoding trait within the 'species
tree' prompts the question of how it evolved. A supported
conclusion from our data is the common origin of selA, selB,

28]. The emergence of the Sec-decoding trait before the division of the three domains has been previously postulated
[18,29]. The evolution of the Sec insertion system only once is
certainly the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario. However, this does not necessarily imply that every gene involved
in Sec-decoding has a common origin. This is exemplified by
selA: no clear ortholog has been found in Archaea and
Eukarya. This suggests that the mechanism of Sec biosynthesis and insertion could have been adjusted during evolution.

selC and selD in the domain Bacteria. This is based on the
absence of close paralogs for Sec-decoding genes in bacteria,
the high bootstrap value for the bacterial node in all phylogenies, and the presence of bacterial sequence signatures in
selA, selB, selC and selD sequences (see Additional data files).
The phylogenies of selB, selC and selD also indicate that the
archaeal and eukaryal Sec-decoding genes cluster together.
This is further supported by the similar overall organization
of the Sec-decoding machinery in Archaea and Eukarya [26-

Assuming the common origin of the Sec-decoding trait, it is
possible to sketch a scenario compatible with our results in
order to explain the pattern of presence/absence of the Secdecoding trait. We propose that this pattern is the result of
two mechanisms, primarily speciation and differential gene
loss, with some contribution from HGT. Regarding the selenouridine synthesis trait, the results also suggest a common
origin in the bacterial domain, as well as the possibility that 2selenouridine pathway can be acquired by HGT.

matching twofold codons might be a refinement in the base
discrimination at the wobble position. The interaction of the
first base of the anticodon with the third base of the codon
plays an important role in the efficiency and accuracy of the
translation process, suggesting that this base modification
could be linked to certain aspects of codon usage. In any case,
it should be stressed that ybbB null E. coli has no apparent
phenotypic differences to wild type-E. coli and does not alter
nonsense suppression phenotype [13].

An important issue in the evolution of Se utilization traits
relates to the selective forces operating to maintain, loose or
acquire the traits. Although it is not possible to draw conclusions, the search for a common biochemical, physiological or
ecological trait in organisms possessing/lacking either or
both traits provides interesting clues. The analysis of the
prokaryotic selenoproteome revealed that formate dehydrogenase is present in most organisms capable of Sec decoding,
exceptions being T. denticola, P. profundum, Clostridium
perfringens and Thermoanerobacter tengcongensis [6]. Formate dehydrogenase plays a key role in anaerobic respiration.
Indeed, most of these species are obligatory anaerobes or facultative aerobes; the sole exception was S. meliloti, a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing obligatory aerobe that lives in the oxygenlimited environment of the nodule [30]. Formate dehydrogenase is the single Sec-containing polypeptide encoded in the
Sinorhizobium meliloti genome [6,30], suggesting that the
presence of the trait may be important for respiration under
conditions of restricted oxygen supply. On the other hand,
glycine reductase is present in T. denticola, P. profundum
and T. tengcongensis and several species of the genera
Clostridium except C. perfringens. Glycine reductase is an
enzymatic complex that allows certain anaerobic bacteria to
conserve energy via a soluble substrate level phosphorylation
system [31]. Sec is more reactive than Cys by virtue of the
lower pKa and higher nucleophilicity of selenol group compared to that of the thiol group [12], and can increase the pH
range at which certain enzymes are active [32]. This might
have conferred a selective advantage improving catalytic efficiency of proteins.

One of the driving forces for the loss of the traits probably
relates to the variability of selenium abundance in the environment. The absolute dependence of organisms on Se can
compromise their existence if dietary Se becomes limiting. In
these situations, enzymes containing Sec as catalytic residues
could have evolved into Cys-containing proteins or, alternatively, both Sec-containing and Cys-containing forms could
be maintained. This latter case is exemplified by the genome
of M. maripaludis, which encodes several Sec-containing
proteins and also homologs that contain cysteine in place of
Sec. In a medium that contains adequate amounts of selenium, this organism represses the synthesis of the cysteine
homologs, but this repression is not observed in a mutant
with disrupted selB [35], suggesting that the cysteine
homologs are a backup system in case of selenium scarcity.
Nevertheless, the existence of organisms carrying only one of
the selenium-utilization traits suggests that selenium availability might not be the sole factor involved in the loss of either
trait. It is also possible that the higher reactivity of selenium
over sulfur in biological molecules might have had a role in
counterselecting the pervasive use of Sec and/or selenouridine in living systems.

Regarding selective forces operating on the evolution of the
selenouridine synthesis trait, we begin from the fact that synthesis of 2-selenouridine is carried out exclusively at the wobble position (first of the anticodon) of the tRNAs for lysine,
glutamate and glutamine (the only amino acids encoded by
twofold purine-ending codons). Several modifications of this
base have been reported to be essential for correct decoding;
thiouridine, in particular, would convert the base into an ionized form that would favor pairing with A and G, and avoid
pairing with U or C, contributing to the discrimination of twofold codons ending in purine from those ending in pyrimidine
[33]. The low pKa value of 2-selenouridine of these tRNAs
would be consistent with this argument and it has been suggested that this would also favor base-pairing with G [34].
Thus, we postulate that selenium modification of tRNAs

Conclusion

This paper provides an organismal map for Sec-decoding and
2-selenouridine synthesis traits within the tree of life, and
defines selB and selC as the gene signature of the Sec-decoding trait, ybbB as the gene signature of selenouridine
synthesis, with selD defining overall selenium utilization. We
show that the set of species that incorporate Sec overlaps
with, yet is distinct from, the set of species that synthesize 2selenouridine, and our data suggest that Sec decoding and 2selenouridine traits can be independently maintained, and
both require selD.
Analysis of the phylogenies of the Sec-decoding and 2-selenouridine synthesis genes provides evidence for the ancient
origin of these traits and demonstrates that their evolution is
a highly dynamic process that occurs at different evolutionary
levels, namely phylum, class, order, family, genera, and even
species. We show that this process can be explained as the
result of speciation and differential gene loss, and provide
conclusive evidence that the loss of these traits is not irreversible as previously thought, and that entire sets of genes can be
acquired by HGT. It is striking that the genetic code of an

organism and the amino-acid repertoire can be 'laterally'
expanded.

The final alignment sets were the following: i) raw alignments
using each software with two different sets of parameters ii)
'sub-alignments' obtained removing the unstable blocks from
the raw alignments using g-blocks software, and iii) 'subalignment' obtained using the '-score' option of T-coffee for
evaluation of the alignment, then the low scoring regions
were removed manually.

The study of selenium-utilization traits, which directly associate protein synthesis with a discrete set of genes, can contribute to the understanding of basic questions regarding the
evolution of the genetic code and the translation machinery.

Materials and methods
Complete genome sequences of 194 prokaryotes were
retrieved from GenBank [36] as of 20 October 2004, representing 151 species.

EF-Tu and EF-1α were recovered using a similar approach to
that described for selA, selB, selD and ybbB, and aligned
using T-coffee. An all-against-all BLAST search was performed sequentially and best reciprocal hits were identified
as putative orthologs. A set of nine genes was obtained. These
sequences were aligned with ClustalW and concatenated. In
all cases we used the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm to build
the trees from different distance matrices using MEGA software [43]. In the case of SSU-rRNA, the Tamura-Nei (TN93)
distance with pairwise-deletion was calculated. For the
amino-acid alignments we use the JTT transition matrix.

information

Several phylogenetic gene trees were built using different
inference methods performed on different sequence alignments. Sequences were aligned with T-coffee version 1.37
[40], ClustalW 1.8 and Dialign-2 [41] using different parameters. The 'score' option of the T-coffee software was enabled to
assess alignment quality. The alignments were then visually
inspected, compared and uncertain sites were removed. In
another approach, we applied the g-blocks software [42] to
remove unstable blocks with 2 different sets of parameters.

Different species trees were initially constructed, based on
small-subunit (SSU) rRNA, EF-Tu/EF-1α (a highly conserved
translation elongation factor present in all organisms), and a
concatenated set of 9 ortholog sequences present in all
prokaryotes. A set of aligned SSU-rRNA sequences was
retrieved from the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) [46],
release 2.1, missing sequences were retrieved from Genbank
and aligned against the set from the RDP using the profile
option of ClustalW.

deposited research

Most sequences of selC were retrieved from GenBank or identified using tRNAscan software with default parameters
[38,39]. The sequences of Wolinella succinogenes, Helicobacter hepaticus, Burkholderia mallei and Thermoanaerobacter tencongensis, were found changing the parameters to
'Cove-only search mode' and lowering the tRNA Cove cutoff
score to 6.

For each of these alignments, we applied several phylogenetic
reconstruction methods including Neighbor Joining using
MEGA software [43], Maximum Likelihood (ML) using
phyML 2.4 software [44] and Bayesian approaches using
MrBayes 3.0b4 [45]. For each of these methods, different
transition matrices (WAG and JTT) and evolutionary models
were tested. In total, more than 80 trees were analyzed for
each gene. The gene trees presented in Figure 2 were built
using the T-coffee alignment evaluated with the '-score'
option and manually refined. The ML and Bayesian trees
were built using WAG matrix and gamma+invar model of
evolutionary change. In the ML method, the assessment of
node reliability was done using 100 bootstrap replicates. In
the case of Bayesian analyses, four heated Markov chains
were started from random trees and run for 1,000,000 generations each. Chains were sampled every 500 generations to
assure independence. Sample points prior to reach stationary
(200) were discarded as 'burn-in'.

Annotated sequences corresponding to selA, selB, selD and
ybbB prokaryotic genes were retrieved from GenBank, and
used as queries to perform local BLAST searches across a
database generated with the 194 genomes. For selA, selD and
ybbB, hits with an e-value below e-15 were recovered; for selB,
the cutoff e-value was e-30 to decrease the number of hits corresponding to other translation factors. A total of 242 selB, 48
selA, 47 selD and 25 ybbB sequences were recovered. The
sequences were aligned using ClustalW [37], a raw phylogenetic analysis was conducted and clear nonorthologous
sequences were discarded. This dataset was manually
curated, and the number of sequences was reduced to 29 selA,
32 selB, 41 selD, and 21 ybbB sequences. These datasets were
used as queries for BLAST searches but no new sequences
were identified. Finally, only one sequence by strain was
included and the set was supplemented with sequences of
three representative eukaryotes (Caenorhabditis elegans,
Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens).

The different 'species trees' display some discrepancies. In
any case, the conclusions drawn are maintained with any of
the above mentioned 'species tree'. The SSU-rRNA was finally
adopted because it is by large the commonest used, and trees
inferred for this gene are sound descriptors of the general
evolutionary history of prokaryotes. This tree also recovers
the major groups described in Bergey's Manual [47].

To study the possible association of a certain gene with ybbB
we run an all-against-all BLAST search with an e-value

homologs present in all these genomes. Then we used this set
of genes to run a new BLAST search against a control set of
