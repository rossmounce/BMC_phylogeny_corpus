Abstract
Background: The genus Oryza is composed of 10 distinct genome types, 6 diploid and 4 polyploid,
and includes the world's most important food crop – rice (Oryza sativa [AA]). Genome size
variation in the Oryza is more than 3-fold and ranges from 357 Mbp in Oryza glaberrima [AA] to
1283 Mbp in the polyploid Oryza ridleyi [HHJJ]. Because repetitive elements are known to play a
significant role in genome size variation, we constructed random sheared small insert genomic
libraries from 12 representative Oryza species and conducted a comprehensive study of the
repetitive element composition, distribution and phylogeny in this genus. Particular attention was
paid to the role played by the most important classes of transposable elements (Long Terminal
Repeats Retrotransposons, Long interspersed Nuclear Elements, helitrons, DNA transposable
elements) in shaping these genomes and in their contributing to genome size variation.
Results: We identified the elements primarily responsible for the most strikingly genome size
variation in Oryza. We demonstrated how Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons belonging to
the same families have proliferated to very different extents in various species. We also showed
that the pool of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons is substantially conserved and ubiquitous
throughout the Oryza and so its origin is ancient and its existence predates the speciation events
that originated the genus. Finally we described the peculiar behavior of repeats in the species Oryza
coarctata [HHKK] whose placement in the Oryza genus is controversial.
Conclusion: Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons are the major component of the Oryza
genomes analyzed and, along with polyploidization, are the most important contributors to the
genome size variation across the Oryza genus. Two families of Ty3-gypsy elements (RIRE2 and
Atlantys) account for a significant portion of the genome size variations present in the Oryza genus.

Background
The C-value paradox, the phenomenon describing the
lack of correlation between biological complexity of an

organism and its genome size [1], is probably best exemplified in plants were genome sizes span several orders of
magnitude ranging from the 98 Mbp Fragaria viridis

genome [2] to more than 110,000 Mbp genome of the lily
Fritillaria assiriaca [3]. Significant genome size variations
are also not uncommon even within single genera such as
rice, cotton and sorghum were 3.6, 3 and 8.1 fold genome
size variation have been reported, respectively [4-6]. The
primary mechanisms that contribute to this variation in
plants are polyploidization [7,8] and transposable element (TE) proliferation [9-11] and elimination [12-17].
TEs are classified according to the different molecules
used as intermediates in the replicative mechanism of
transposition as class 1(or RNA elements) and class 2 (or
DNA elements) [18]. Class 1 elements transpose via an
RNA intermediate and include long terminal repeat (LTR)
retrotransposons (LTR-RTs), long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements
(SINEs) [19]. Class 2 elements transpose via a DNA intermediate and have been classified into superfamilies (hAT,
CACTA and Mutator-like elements) according to the similarity of transposases, the element-encoded protein that
catalyzes transposition and integration [20]. Other classes
of DNA transposable elements are represented by helitrons [21] and polintons [22].
The genus Oryza is an ideal model system to study the role
of TEs on genome size variation. The genus is composed
of 23 species: two cultivated (Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima) and 21 wild [23,24]. Based on evidence derived
from interspecific crossing, cytogenetics and genomic
DNA hybridization, ten Oryza genome types have been
recognized including 6 diploid (2n = 24) and 4 tetraploid
(2n = 48). The relevance of rice as staple food resource for
the world, its compact 389 Mbp genome [25] and its role
as a "model" species for genomic studies of cereals [26,27]
have driven massive research efforts that include the production of the first finished genome sequence of any crop
plant [25]. Additionally, our laboratory has developed a
comprehensive set of BAC libraries, BAC end sequences
and integrated physical maps representing the 10 Oryza
genome types [28,29].
To better understand the role transposable elements have
played in genome size variation in Oryza we generated
and sequenced a set of random sheared genomic libraries
from 12 species representative of the 10 genome types of
the Oryza. Random sheared libraries represent an unbiased sampling of genome content and enable the characterization of their most relevant features without
undertaking a massive sequencing effort. The sequences
obtained were analyzed in order to describe, classify and
compare the repetitive fraction of the genus Oryza. Particular attention was paid to the role played by the most
important classes of TEs (LTR RTs, LINEs, helitrons and
other DNA transposable elements) in shaping these
genomes and in contributing to genome size variation. In
the case of four groups of TEs (the class 1 LTR-RTs and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/152

LINEs and the class 2 CACTA and Mutator-like elements)
phylogenetic analyses were carried out.

Results
To better understand the repeat content of the genus
Oryza, 12 random sheared libraries were constructed and
sequenced from 12 vouchered accessions that represent
the 10 genome types of Oryza (Figure 1). The total
number of clones produced was 42,432, which roughly
corresponded to 0.015× coverage of each genome. Mean
insert size ranged from 2.5 kbp for O. australiensis
[genome type:EE; genome size:965 Mbp] to 3.9 kbp for O.
rufipogon [AA; 439 Mbp]. Cloned inserts were bi-directionally sequenced and after removing low quality data
(sequences shorter than 50 bases and all those similar to
plastid genomes), 72,245 high quality sequence reads
were obtained for a total of 51.76 Mb of sequence (0.56%
of the total size of all the genomes studied (Table 1)).
Repeats abundance and distribution
Repetitive sequences were identified by similarity searches
against databases of previously characterized repetitive
elements, isolated from O. sativa and other Oryza species,
including centromeric repeats, helitrons, SINEs, LINEs,
MITEs, LTR-RTs, DNA transposable elements (DNA-TEs),
ribosomal sequences and telomeric repeats (see Methods). All the major classes of repeats were represented
throughout the genus (Table 2). The overall amount of
repeats was quite variable in different species and ranged

All the genome size estimates are from Ammiraju et al (2006) [4] except those of O. glaberrima and O. minuta which are from Martinez et al (1994)
[54] and of O. coarctata which is a rough estimate because the real genome size of this species is unknown. We therefore used the value estimated
for O. ridleyi [HHJJ; 1283 Mbp], which is also an allotetraploid species and shares the HH genome type with O. coarctata.

from the 25.04% of reads in O. coarctata [HHKK] to
66.42% of reads in O. officinalis [CC; 651 Mbp].
In all the genomes studied the largest class of repeats consisted of LTR-RTs with amounts ranging from the 55% of
reads in O. granulata [GG; 882 Mbp] to 12.7% of reads in
O. brachyantha [FF; 362 Mbp]. DNA transposons, excluding MITEs and helitrons, appeared to be more abundant
in O. ridleyi [HHJJ; 1283 Mbp] (11.93% of reads) and
were depleted in O. coarctata [HHKK] (3.44% of reads).
The MITE sequences used as queries in similarity searches
were isolated in O. sativa and not surprisingly they tag the
highest value of hits in the three AA genome species: O.
glaberrima (17% of reads), O. nivara (11.73% of reads)
and O. rufipogon (14.36% of reads). The quantity of MITEs
identified in the remaining genome types was less than
6% of reads except for the notable exception of the distantly related species O. brachyantha [FF; 362 Mbp] with
15.28% of reads. The lower than expected MITE content
in the non-AA genomes species is likely due to the fact that
MITEs are highly species specific and the repeat database
used to identify MITEs was a curated data set from the O.
sativa species only.
Differences in TE size, host genome size and degrees of
interspecific conservation make it particularly difficult to
perform a detailed comparison based solely on the percentage of significantly similar sequences out of the total.
A more rigorous approach was recently proposed by
Hawkins et al. [9] where an equation was derived (see
Methods) that takes into account TE mean size, host

genome size, the minimum length needed in order to
have a significant BLASTN hit, and the number of matches
out of total reads available to estimate the absolute
number of repeats in a given genome. We used this equation for all classes of repeats for which reliable estimates
of the average length were available and then, in order to
have comparable results, normalized the data to the single
Mbp (Figure 2 and Additional file 1). Here we considered
only the most represented and conserved families of elements: LTR-RTs, LINEs, helitrons, and the DNA-TEs –
CACTA and Mutator like. It should however be noted how
the use of average lengths for entire classes of elements
could introduce a certain degree of uncertainty and so the
following values should be considered as an approximation. Not surprisingly the LTR-RTs remained the major
contributor to the repeat pool of each species. Species
with the highest occurrence of LTR-RTs per Mbp were O.
granulata [GG; 882 Mbp] (49.5) and O. australiensis [EE;
965 Mbp] (50.9) whereas the most depleted was O. brachyanta [FF; 362 Mbp] (12.9). In almost all cases, the Ty3gypsy elements outnumbered Ty1-copia elements. This disproportion was particularly striking in the case of O.
nivara [AA; 448 Mbp], O. rufipogon [AA; 439 Mbp] and O.
granulata [GG; 882 Mbp] were the ratios Ty3-gypsy to Ty1copia elements were 4.80, 4.91 and 4.6 respectively. The
only exception to the overwhelming presence of Ty3-gypsy
elements in comparison to Ty1-copia was found in O.
coarctata [HHKK] where twice as many Ty1-copia elements
(ratio of Ty3-gypsy/Ty1-copia = 0.5) were found.
Among other repeats, it is worth to note that CACTA elements seemed to be significantly more frequent in the BB

Occurrence
Occurrence per single Mbp for the major classes of repeats in different Oryza genomes. Y-axis: the estimated
number of occurrences calculated using the equation from Hawkins et al (2006) [9] and normalized to 1 Mbp. The confidence
intervals, displayed as error bars, were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution of repeats in the genome. The mean length
used in calculation for different repeats were as follows: Ty3-gypsy elements: 12 Kbp; Ty1-copia elements: 5.5 Kbp; others LTRRTs not classified (LTR-retrotransposons): 8.75 Kbp; LINEs: 3.5 kbp; helitrons (complete autonomous): 12.8 Kbp; CACTA:
15.2 Kbp; hAT: 3.6 Kbp *In this case all the calculations are based on a rough estimate of the genome size of this species: the
real value is unknown, we therefore used the value estimated for O. ridleyi [HHJJ; 1283 Mbp], which is also an allotetraploid
species and shares the HH genome type with O. coarctata.

(O. punctata; 3.3 elements per Mbp), CC (O. officinalis; 4.0

CCDD (O. alta; 2.7 hits per Mbp), EE (O. australiensis; 3.2
hits per Mbp) and HHJJ (O. ridleyi; 2.5 hits per Mbp)
genomes as compared with all 3 AA genomes (O. glaberrima, O. rufipogon, O. nivara) where the number of hits was
less than 2 per Mbp. In almost all the genomes the frequency of CACTA elements was greater than the hAT elements, with the exception of O. brachyantha [FF; 362 Mbp]
(CACTA = 0.5 hits/Mbp; hAT 0.6 hits/Mbp) and O. granulata [GG; 882 Mbp] in which hAT elements outnumber
the CACTA elements 6 to 1 (CACTA = 0.3 hits/Mb; hAT =
1.9/Mbp). The distribution of LINEs was higher in the AA
genomes where it was greater than 2.5 hits per Mbp and
very low in O. granulata [GG; 882 Mbp] with only 0.7 hits
per Mbp.
The significant variance of LTR-RT representation presented above prompted us to perform a more in depth
analysis of the distribution of the different families in
each genome. To identify the primary LTR-RT families
responsible for this variance and possibly link them to the
genome size variation in each host species, all sequences
previously identified as being similar to LTR-RTs were

screened a second time against a reduced database containing representatives of twenty-six of the most abundant
LTR-RT families isolated in Oryza genus (11 Ty1-copia and
15 Ty3-gypsy) (Table 3). In all species the overall majority
of sequences already annotated as LTR-RTs could be easily
classified according to these parameters (Table 3). Elements related to the most abundant families of LTR-RTs
isolated in O. sativa [AA; 389 Mbp] were identified in all
the Oryza genome types considered with very few exceptions. This indicated that the complement of LTR-RTs previously identified in rice is shared throughout the Oryza
genus. However, as shown in Table 3, different LTR-RTs
had different fates in different species.
A paradigmatic case was that of two Ty3-gypsy families
Atlantys and RIRE2 (that is related to the element Wallabi
[10]). Atlantys was the most abundant element in 7 of the
10 Oyrza genome types (O. punctata [BB; 425 Mbp],
6.36% of total reads; O. officinalis [CC; 651 Mbp], 10.15%
of total reads; O. minuta [BBCC; 1124 Mbp], 8.70% of
total reads; O. alta [CCDD; 1008 Mbp], 7.32% of total
reads; O. australiensis [EE; 965 Mbp], 10.98% of total
reads; O. coarctata [HHKK], 4.08% of total reads and O.
ridleyi [HHJJ; 1283 Mbp], 7.62% of total reads). It was

and FF genomes, it did not expand significantly in comparison to the other elements. RIRE2 related elements (i.e.
Wallabi [10] in O. australiensis) expanded significantly in
O. australiensis [EE; 965 Mbp], 8.56% of the total reads

in O. punctata, O. officinalis and O. minuta respectively).

It is also worth to note that the RIRE8 Ty3-gypsy element is
more widespread in the AA genomes (5.90% and 5.21%
of total reads in O. nivara and O. rufipogon, respectively)
than in the remaining genome types.

For all the genome types it was possible to identify a fraction of LTR-RT related sequences that did not show any
significant similarity with the major families isolated
from O. sativa. The amount of this fraction expressed as
percentage out of the total number of sequence reads
ranged from 0.71% in O. brachyantha [FF; 362 Mbp] to
5.6% in O. ridleyi [HHJJ; 1283 Mbp] and represented the
most species specific sets of these elements (or the most
diverged from the O. sativa retroelement pool).

The O. minuta [BBCC; 1124 Mbp] genome represents the
only polyploid genome for which a comparison with both
the original genome counterparts BB (O. punctata) and CC
(O. officinalis) is possible. All LTR-RT families identified in
O. minuta [BBCC: 1124 Mbp] were found in at least one
of the diploid counterparts and there were only few cases
where an element was significantly more represented in
the polyploid genome than in the two diploid counterparts. The most convincing example was that of the Ty1-

Our strategy to rely on similarity searches in order to identify the repetitive fraction of a genome has the obvious pitfall that, if a repeat is not present in the repeat database it
will not be detected. To check for this possibility we
adopted a different approach to screen all sequence reads
that did not show any significant hits with already characterized repeats. Sequences were clustered using the program Blastclust and the results are shown in Table 4. Only
a few clusters containing more than 3 sequences were iso-

lated in all the species with the exception of the AA and BB
genomes in which no clusters were identified. The largest
cluster identified was found in O. ridleyi [HHJJ; 1283
Mbp] and contained 69 sequences out of 11,091 (0.62%).
The sequences present in these clusters very likely represent previously uncharacterized repeats. However as the
figures for O. ridleyi [HHJJ; 1283 Mbp] demonstrate, they
do not constitute a significant portion of the genomes in
which they were isolated.
Phylogenetic analysis of repeats
To establish the phylogeneic relationships among the
most prominent superfamilies of TEs in Oryza, we used
amino acid sequences of the most conserved domain
tracts (see Methods) of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy LTR-RTs,
LINEs and CACTA and Mutator-like DNA-TEs to build
neighbor-joining trees.

For Ty1-copia elements (Figure 3) it was possible to
retrieve 269 reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences out of
the 72,245 available sequences. These sequences were
resolved into at least eight lineages as representatives of
the major Ty1-copia retroelements isolated. The amount of
sequences in each lineage reflected the abundance of that
family in the genome. Furthermore the most abundant
lineages contained representatives of all the different species and there was not a single species-specific lineage
with the partial exception of RIRE1 in O. australiensis [EE;
965 Mbp]. This lineage, also including a few sequences
from O. minuta [BBCC; 1124 Mbp], was separated from
the others and it was possible to see how the branch
lengths are short suggesting that amplification of this element took place after speciation (with the possible exception represented by the few O. minuta RIRE1 related
sequences).

RT-like sequences from Ty3-gypsy elements (508 elements) were isolated and used to build a phylogenetic tree
(Figure 4). The complete set is less heterogeneous than the
Ty1-copia set, however all the major families are represented. In the case of RIRE2 and Atlantys, the two most
abundant Ty3-gypsy families throughout the genus, all the
species were included in the correspondent lineages indicating that their presence in the genus predates its speciation. However, considering the different species in which
the major amplification events of elements belonging to
these two families took place, it was possible to note how
the elements isolated in different species usually do not
mix together in the internal lineages suggesting that their
amplification has happened after speciation.
LINEs are usually not very abundant in plants as compared to LTR-RTs with some exceptions such as the del2
element in Lilium speciosum [30]. The genus Oryza in this
sense appears to follow this general rule. This trend is
reflected in the number of LINE reverse transcriptase like
sequences [38] isolated from our set. Twenty-two of them
cluster in 4 major bootstrap supported lineages and many
are characterized by very long branches suggestive of an
ancient origin of these retroelements in the genus (Figure
5). These findings suggest that even in the case of the
Oryza genus, LINEs exhibit, as in other plants, high
sequence divergence and extreme heterogeneity [31-33].
The two major groups of DNA TEs, CACTA and Mutatorlike were phylogenetically investigated using tracts of their
transposase coding domains. In the case of CACTA elements, we identified 125 transposase-like sequences,
whereas 55 were isolated for Mutator-like elements. For
both classes of TE elements, it was not possible to identify
species specific lineages in the corresponding Neighbor
Joining trees (Figures 6 and 7). The only exception was
represented by a large lineage including 14 of the 18
CACTA transposase domains isolated in O. alta [CCDD;
1008 Mbp]. However this lineage lacks consistent bootstrap support.

Discussion
Genome survey sequences from 12 random sheared
genomic libraries representative of the 10 genome types of
the genus Oryza were generated and analyzed to obtain an
unbiased sampling of the repeat content of the genus as a
whole. Our results showed that the genomic composition
of the Oryza species is not exceptional when compared to
other plant species in that the repetitive fraction consistently makes up a significant portion of each of the 10
genome types.
Among TEs, the major class of repeats in Oryza was represented by LTR-RTs whose absolute occurrence was estimated to be in the order of thousands of copies for each

species. Detailed analysis of the major O. sativa LTR-RT
families enabled us to identify the elements responsible
for the major differences in genome size variation across
the genus Oryza. For example, LTR-RTs related to RIRE2
represent more than 8.5% and 21% of all the sequences
obtained for O. australiensis [EE; 965 Mbp] and O. granulata [GG; 882 Mbp] respectively. This is consistent with
previous studies which showed that the proliferation of 3
family members (RIRE1, the RIRE2 related element Wallabi and Kangaroo) in EE genomes [10] and a single family
(Gran3) in the GG genome [Jetty et al., 2007 accepted
with revisions] accounts for nearly 50% and 25%
increases in their genome sizes respectively. Another family that has played a significantly similar role in genome
size variation is the Ty3-gypsy element Atlantys. The Atlantys family has been surprisingly overlooked by previous
studies and with its amplification has impacted not only
the O. granulata and O. australiensis genomes but also the
BB, CC, BBCC and CCDD genomes. The events leading to
the explosive proliferation of both the RIRE2 and Atlantys

families appear to have taken place after each speciation
event.
The consequences of TE proliferation subsequent to speciation on genome size variation is reminiscent of Zea mays
in which five LTR-RT families represent nearly 25% of the
genome [34] and of the species Gossypium herabaceum and
G. exiguum where a group of Ty3-gypsy elements, named
GORGE-3, has extensively proliferated in comparison to
other elements and constitutes a significant portion of
each genome [9]. In contrast, no single LTR-RT family was
found to constitute significant portions of the AA genome
Oryza species with the only exception being represented
by the Ty3-gypsy element RIRE8. The finding that, apart
from the polyploids, the largest genomes in the Oryza (O.
australiensis and O. granulata) are those that have seen the
"explosive" proliferation of one or two LTR-RT families,
once again identifies the pivotal role of this class of TEs in
the dynamics of genome size variation.

The differential proliferation of LTR-RTs in the Oryza
genus could be explained by taking into account the
effects of varying genomic backgrounds on element life
cycles, different rates of LTR-RT removal by unequal
recombination and/or illegitimate recombination
[8,15,16] and inherently different retrotranspositional
potentials of various element families [35]. However no
single convincing explanation of this phenomenon has so
far been advanced for other plant species in which similar
events have been described [9,10].
Here we have demonstrated that the pool of LTR-RTs in
the Oryza is substantially conserved throughout the genus
because in almost all cases relatives of the LTR-RT families
identified in O. sativa [AA] could also be found in the
other Oryza species. We therefore conclude that its existence predates the speciation events that originated the
genus as we know. This finding is well supported by our
phylogenetic analyses and it is in accordance with the
results of previous studies analyzing the Ty1-copia elements phylogeny and distribution across different genera
of the Gramineae family [36,37].

Besides the identification of different amounts of elements from the same LTR-RT families, all the genomes
studied, except O. coarctata, showed the same quantitative
relationship between Ty3-gypsy and Ty1-copia elements
where the Ty3-gypsy elements constantly outnumber Ty1copia elements, even if the ratio between the two elements
varied (from more than 4.6 in O. nivara [AA; 448 Mbp],
O. rufipogon [AA; 439 Mbp] and O. granulata [GG; 882
Mbp] to 1.52 in O. brachyantha [FF; 362 Mbp]). This data
is completely consistent with previous analysis of the cultivated japonica and indica genomes [25,38-41] and can
now be extended to the genus Oryza, with the notable
exception of O. coarctata [HHKK] where we found a ratio
close to 0.5 between the Ty3-gypsy and Ty1-copia elements.
An even more striking difference between the O. coarctata
[HHKK] genome and the other Oryza spp genomes is that
it was found to contain the least amount repetitive elements despite it being polyploid and its predicted large
genome size. It should be noted that we have not been
able to obtain live plants or tissues in the U.S. in order to
determine an accurate genome size measurement by flow

cytometry due to quarantine restrictions. To rule out the
possibility that our similarity searches could not detect
highly diverged elements we analyzed all the sequences to
try to identify repeats de novo through a clustering
approach. In this case no significant de novo clusters were
obtained in O. coarctata. These findings rule out the existence of a single recently originated family of repeats,
highly species specific and constituting a significant portion of the genome. However, the results do not discount
the possibility that repeats missed by previous searches in
O. coarctata, if present, belong to several different families,
possibly diverged (and so ancient). All evidence combined supports the old taxonomic view that places O.
coarctata in the genus Porteresia [42] and not Oryza. However more in depth and accurate analyses are needed in
order to ascertain the dynamics acting towards this apparently repeat depletion in O. coarctata.
The evolutionary events leading to the present day Oryza
genus spanned at least 9 million years from O. sativa [AA;

389 Mbp] to the the most basal species O. granulata [GG;
882 Mbp] [43]. Similar to what was observed in O. coarctata [HHKK], the use of repeat collections mainly based
on elements isolated in O. sativa [AA;389 Mbp] to screen
other species of the genus raises some concerns about how
nucleotide divergence can impact estimates of LTR-RTs
abundance. With the exceptions of O. coarctata (discussed
above) and O. brachyantha [FF; 362 Mbp] (in which the
depletion of repeats can be easily explained taking into
account the small size of this genome), our work demonstrated that the amount of LTR-RTs isolated does not
decrease substantially when our analysis moved from the
AA genome types to the most distant ones. The evidence
has been indirectly confirmed by the clustering analysis
that did not revealed the existence any significantly repeat
family previously missed. This, in turn, demonstrates how
similarity searches of LTR-RT families have a good level of
"portability" throughout the genus giving substantially
reliable and reasonably exhaustive results, if the proper
settings are used.

A completely different scenario could be described for TEs
lacking conserved domains and having higher species
sequence specificity such as MITEs and SINEs. In this case
the evolutionary distance from AA genomes consistently
results in a steady drop in the amount TEs identified (with
the significant exception of MITEs in O. brachyantha)
prompting the need of de novo and ad hoc identification
tools based on structural features beside the nucleotidic
sequence.

Conclusion
Here we report the results of a comprehensive analysis of
the abundance and relative distribution of major TE
classes across twelve species of the genus Oryza.
We have demonstrated how the LTR-RT complement in of
these species is ancient and conserved throughout the
genus, and has attained different retrotranpositional success in different species.

We also identified two LTR-RT families (RIRE2 and Atlantys) that are responsible for a significant portion of
genome size variation in the genus and we demonstrated
how their massive increase in copy number is recent.

Library construction and DNA sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted using CTAB [44]. DNA was
sheared using the Hydroshear (GeneMachines) to produce 2–5 kb fragments. DNA fragments were end-repaired
using Epicientre's End-it Repair kit and size selected on
0.6% agarose gels. DNA fragments in the size range of 2–
5 kb were cut out of the gel, eluted using a QIAEX II Gel
extraction kit and ligated to linearized pBluescriptII KS+ at
16°C overnight. Ligation products (1 uL) were transformed into DH10B electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen).
Shotgun plasmids were sequenced bi-directionally on ABI

software and base called using Phred [45]. Vector screen-

Similarity searches
Sequences were used as queries in similarity searches
against different repeat databases: TIGR rice repeats version 3.1 [47], Repbase version 11_09 [48] and a proprietary collection of retroelements isolated in Oryza sativa
and other Oryza species. Searches were carried out using
the BLASTN algorithm [49] run under relaxed settings (-q
-2 -r 3) in order to accommodate the divergence between
species searched from the major source of repeats in our
database (O. sativa). Only hits having an E value equal or
lower to 1e-10 were used. For all sequences that did not
result in any significant hits, a second round of searches
was carried out using the algorithm BLASTX against the
non-redundant division of GenBank. Under these conditions only hits having an E value equal or lower to 1e-5

Oryza species, we used this equation: n = (Xobs/N)*(G/

Hawkins et al. [9], where "Xobs" is the observed number

is number of targets in the genome, "L" is length of target
sequence, "m" is estimated minimum length required to
identify a sequence in a BLAST search (we used the
extremely conservative value of 100 bp), "e" is number of
bp sequenced from each insert and "G" is genome size.
Published sequences for various repetitive elements were

Occurrences per single Mbp for the major classes of repeats in different
Oryza genomes. A) The absolute number of significant hits to the Oryza
repeat data bases. C: Estimated number of occurrences calculated using
the equation from Hawkins et al (2006) [9]. E: The number normalized
to 1 Mbp. Columns B, D and F are the confidence intervals calculated
assuming a Poisson distribution of repeats in the genome, calculated for
values in columns A, C and E respectively. The mean length used for different repeats were as follows: Ty3-gypsy elements: 12 Kbp; Ty1-copia
elements: 5.5 Kbp; others LTR-RTs not classified: 8.75 Kbp; LINEs: 3.5
kbp; Helitrons (complete autonomous): 12.8 Kbp; CACTA: 15.2 Kbp;
hAT: 3.6 Kbp. *In this case all the calculations are based on a rough estimate of the genome size of this species: the real value is unknown; we
therefore used the value estimated for O. ridleyi [HHJJ; 1283 Mbp],
which is also an allotetraploid species and shares the HH genome type
with O. coarctata.

All sequences that were not classified as repeats were used
in a cluster analysis using "Blastclust" [50]. The program
was used with the following settings, L 0.51 S 80, meaning
that all sequences sharing at least 80% similarity over at
least 51% of their length were included in the same cluster. Only clusters containing 3 or more hits were considered in analyzed further.
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences homologous to the Reverse Transcriptase
domains of Ty1-copia ([GenBank: CAD40165.2], 92 AA
from residues 781 to 872), Ty3-gypsy ([GenBank:
CAH66235.1],162 AA from residues 471 to 632) and
LINEs (122 residues from RT domain of element
OSLINE1_5 in Repbase [48]) and sequences homologous
to transposase domains of CACTA ([GenBank:
DAA02108.1], 100 AA from residue 1 to 100) and Mutator-like elements ([GenBank: AAM94534.1], 238 AA from
residues 361 to 598), were identified in the random
sheared libraries through tBLASTN searches [49]. The corresponding amino acid domains were retrieved and
aligned using Muscle [51]. Neighbor-joining trees were
produced and edited using the program MEGA version 3
[52].
