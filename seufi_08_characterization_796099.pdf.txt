Abstract
An Egyptian isolate of Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpliNPV) was tested for its
potential as biocontrol agent in comparison to Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus
(AcMNPV). Comparative assays of SpliNPV and AcMNPV against 2nd instar larvae of Spodoptera
littoralis revealed 4-fold greater susceptibility of S. littoralis to AcMNPV than to SpliNPV based on
LC50 values for the two viruses. The LT50s determined for SpliNPV and AcMNPV using LC50 of the
virus against 2nd instar larvae were 4.2 and 5.8 days, respectively. A DNA segment of 405 bp
containing highly conserved region from polyhedrin gene of SpliNPV (Polh-cr) was successfully
amplified by PCR. Subsequently, this DNA segment was cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide
sequence and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared to all available sequences in
GenBank. Sequence alignment results revealed that Polh-cr showed significant similarities with 91
different baculovirus isolates. The percentage of homology ranged from 78% for Plusia orichalcea
NPV to 99% for SpliNPV. This highly conserved region provides a candidate that could be used in
easy, fast and economic prospective systems for virus detection as well as in biological control
strategies.

Introduction
Baculoviruses are considered to be the largest and most
broadly studied insect viruses. Although they infect over
600 species of insects [1], individual isolates normally
show a limited host range and infect only closely related
species. It is believed that baculoviruses are potentially
useful as safe biological control agent and in some cases
they were used successfully to control different insect
pests [2-4]. However the overall use of baculoviruses for
biological control is limited compared to other pest control means [3,5]. This is due to the virulence and speed of
action, as related to dose, host range, cost of production
and patent registration are important effectiveness-determining properties of insect-pathogenic biocontrol agents.

Baculoviruses were not only isolated from the insect
orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Trichoptera, but also
were isolated from the crustacean order Decapoda
(shrimps) [6]. Furthermore, some NPVs (Penaeus monodon-NPV) are considered as serious pests for marine crustaceans [7]. The infection of marine crustaceans (shrimps,
prawns, crabs, eustacosa...etc.) with NPV will reduce their
economic value and thus negatively affecting the
national income. This problem will arise in countries that
depend on marine wealth as a source of national income
and/or where marine crustaceans are a major in most of
the peoples' food (Australia and Far East nations like
Japan, China, etc...). Although, the shrimp viruses have
now been classified as Nimaviridae in the genus WhispoviPage 1 of 11

rus and are no longer baculoviruses [8], their diagnosis by
PCR using primers of the polyhedrin and DNA polymerase genes of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus
(AcMNPV) and Lymantria dispar nucleopolyhedrovirus
(LdMNPV) was confirmed by Hsu et al. (2000). For the
above mentioned reasons, many authors were interested
in developing an accurate and easy diagnostic method to
detect baculoviral infection in larval shrimps as well as
insects [9-13,7,14-19].
Because baculoviruses are of great interest and utility to a
large cross-sections of agricultural and biomedical
research community, selection of some isolates with natural improved characteristics and definitive characterization of them have appeared recently. Consequently this
piece of work will help in viral epidemiology, in monitoring the viral dissemination after field application and
in risk assessment studies.
Therefore, the main objective of the present work is to
obtain a sequenced highly conserved DNA fragment from
our NPV isolate to be used in an easy, fast and economic
prospective system for virus detection. Also, this DNA segment can be used for developing kits of ELISA, hybridization, Western and dot blotting. Furthermore, our NPV
isolate may be useful as potential biocontrol agent in programs of integrated pest management (IPM).

Methods
Insects
Laboratory colony of the cotton leaf worm, Spodoptera littoralis, was originally collected from Giza, Egypt and
maintained in the insectary of Agricultural Genetic Engineering Research Institute (AGERI) under highly controlled conditions from 1990 to date. The colony was
maintained in the laboratory according to the technique
described by El-Defrawi and coworkers [20]. Larvae were
reared on a semisynthetic diet described by Levinson and
Navon [21]. This colony was kept at 25 ± 2°C, 65–70%
RH and natural photoperiod. These insects were used for
viral propagation and bioassays.
Viruses
An NPV isolate was selected from thirteen Egyptian baculovirus isolates from different geographical localities during 1996–2000. This isolate was studied in detail to
determine its insecticidal activity compared to AcMNPV.
In addition, a highly conserved region of polyhedrin gene
was amplified, cloned and sequenced for further investigations. The selected isolate was collected from an Egyptian field located at Khorshid, Alexandria. It was isolated
during Jan, 1999 from a S. littoralis larva on cabbage
plants. This isolate was successfully propagated, purified
following the method described by Lacey and coworkers
[22] and used for further studies.

A virus stock of NPV from Autographa californica nuclear
polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV; E2 strain) was originally
obtained from Prof. Dr. Suzanne Thiem, Department of
Entomology, University of Michigan, was used in the bioassays as a reference in comparison to our isolate.
Insecticidal activity
Laboratory bioassay tests were conducted using highly
purified virus suspensions. The SpliNPV and AcMNPV isolates were tested against 2nd larval instar from the virusfree rearing culture in the laboratory. The concentrations
were measured using Thoma haemocytometer and light
microscope [22]. Bioassays were performed using five
concentrations of each virus isolate. Tested larvae were
starved for 8 hours prior to feeding viruses. Serial dilutions of each tested isolate were prepared beginning with
the following stock concentrations in PIB/ml: 7.8 × 104
and 9.4 × 104 for SpliNPV and AcMNPV, respectively. Bioassays were carried out in plastic cups measuring 15 cm
diameter × 10 cm height and containing a layer of 1 cm
semi-synthetic diet. The viral suspensions were dispersed
on the diet using micropipette (25 μl suspension/larva).
Forty larvae were used for each concentration of virus and
control. The control larvae were fed on diet treated with
distilled water. All treatments were kept at 25 ± 2°C and
normal photoperiod. The experiment was replicated
thrice for each virus isolate and control. Mortality was
recorded on the 7th day post-infection then corrected
according to Abbott's formula [23]. Cumulative mortality
was recorded daily and the experiment was stopped on
day 10 post-infection. Mortality was corrected according
to Abbott's formula [23].
Statistical analyses
Probit analysis of mortality data from bioassays was conducted using SPSS (ver10.0) computer software (SPSS for
Windows, SPSS Inc., 1997). The LT values for the tested
isolates were derived from analysis of data on the progression of mortality of S. littoralis larvae, following exposure
to the LC50s dosage using probit analysis modified for
multiple observations over time [24] and Mathematica
software (Wolfram, Champaign, IL).
PCR amplification
PCR amplification was performed according to Saiki and
coworkers [25] with minor modifications. Total DNA was
extracted from the NPV isolate and the DNA segment was
amplified using two primers designed based on conserved
nucleotide sequences of ten different polyhedrin genes
[26]. The forward primer: GG(GT) CC(GT) GGC AAG
AAT CAG AA and the reverse one: GCG TC(TG) GG(TG)
GCG AAC TCT TT(TG) ATT TT. Total reaction volume was
50 μl which contained 1× PCR buffer (Promega), 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega), 100 ng of each primer and 30 ng of template

DNA. The amplification program used was 3 min at 94°C
(hot start), 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 55°C and 2 min at
72°C for 35 cycles followed by one cycle of 72°C for 7
min. PCR amplification was carried out in a DNA thermal
cycler (Model 380 A, Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).
Cloning of a highly conserved region from SpliNPV
polyhedrin gene
The positive PCR products were visualized and eluted
from the gel using GenClean Kit (Invitrogen Corporation,
San Diego, CA, USA) as described by the manufacturer.
The purified PCR products and a pGEM-T vector (Promega
Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) were mixed in a 5: 1
(insert: vector) molar ratio and ligated using T4 DNA
ligase (as described by the manufacturer). Ligation mix
was used to transform competent Escherichia coli JM109
cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). White colonies were
screened using PCR as described earlier in this section.
Nucleotide sequence and sequence analysis
Only one clone pGNPV-95 was selected and sequenced
using M13 universal forward and reverse primers. Sequencing was performed using T7SequencingTM kit (Pharmacia,
Biotech) and model 310 automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Analysis of nucleotide
and deduced amino acid sequences was carried out using
EditSeq-DNAstar Inc., Expert Sequence Analysis software,
Windows 32 Edit Seq 4.00 (1989–1999) and ExPasy database on the internet. Blast search for alignment of the
obtained sequence with the published ones was done
using database of National Centre for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI). The cloned DNA fragment (Polh-cr)
was deposited in GenBank under the AY442260 accession
number.

Results
Field survey
During the present study, the most promising isolate, as a
biocontrol agent (based on LC and LT values), was
selected from thirteen Egyptian baculovirus isolates.
Through four visits to the location, out of 63 collected S.
littoralis larvae, 18 larvae were diseased (showed symptoms of viral infection). The virus was diagnosed using

light microscope, propagated in a S. littoralis laboratory
colony, purified and kept at -80°C for further studies.
Insecticidal activity
Table (1) presents the LC and LT values for the two tested
isolates (SpliNPV and AcMNPV). It is clear that the newly
molted 2nd larval instars of S. littoralis were susceptible to
the applied concentrations. Based on LC50 in PIB/ml, our
SpliNPV isolate was significantly (4-fold) less active (LC50
= 1.2 × 103) than the reference strain AcMNPV (LC50 = 3.7
× 102). Although LC25 and LC95 of our isolate were
approximately 2 and 8-fold lower than that of AcMNPV,
there were substantial overlap in the 95% confidence limits of the two viruses. Time to death showed some dependence on the initial concentration. Furthermore, it was
observed that the highest peak of mortality was on 4–6
days post-infection. The progression of mortality in 2nd
instar larvae of S. littoralis over a 10-day-period following
exposure to LC50 dosage of the two viruses was analyzed
to produce LT values (Table 1). Probit analysis of the LT
values revealed that the decrease in LT values in favour of
our isolate against AcMNPV was not significant. Despite
the overlap in the 95% confidence intervals of the two
viruses, LT95 of our isolate was nearly 4 days less than that
of AcMNPV (95% c.i. 9.7–25.4 days, X2 = 2.64, DF = 8, P
= 0.96, slope = 3.49 ± 0.74).
PCR amplification
Two oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify
537 bp within the open reading frame (orf) of polyhedrin
gene [26] and were successfully used in PCR. PCR analysis
of our results revealed that a DNA fragment of only 405
bp was amplified within the orf (beginning about 78 – 81
codons after the starting codon, AUG) of the SpliNPV-95
polyhedrin gene (Fig. 1, lane 5). Subsequently this DNA
segment was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Fig. 1, lane 2)
and transformed cells were tested with PCR using the
same primers (Fig. 1, lane 6). Using this screening
method, clone pGNPV-95 was tested as positive (Fig. 1,
lane 6).

Nucleotide sequence and sequence analyses
The nucleotide sequence of Polh-cr and its deduced amino
acid sequence are shown in Fig (2). A single open reading
frame (orf) that could encode a polypeptide of 135 amino
acids was detected. No stop codon was found all over the
sequence. This deduced polypeptide contains 16 strongly
basic, 16 strongly acidic, 46 hydrophobic and 34 polar
amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of the putative polypeptide is 15.92 KDa. Isoelectric point (PI) is
7.242 and the charge at pH 7.0 is 0.331.

produced significant alignments with 11 granulovirus
sequences. This may raise the question of possible homologous recombination between NPV and GV species.

The nucleotide sequence of Polh-cr was blasted in GenBank database and compared to all available sequences.
Alignment results revealed that Polh-cr has significant
alignment with 111 baculovirus isolates (100 NPVs and
11 GVs). The percentage of homology ranged between
99% for SpliNPV (Acc# D01017) and 78% for Plusia

The deduced amino acid sequence was compared to all
other polyhedrins in GenBank database. Alignment
results showed that the percentage of homology of Polh-cr
ranged between 100% for S. littoralis polyhedrins (Acc#
AAC33752 and AAR04375) and 81% for Attacus ricini polyhedrin (Acc# P31036).

Comparing Polh-cr nucleotide sequence (Acc# AY442260)
to its corresponding sequence of AcMNPV (Acc# M25054)
as a reference, 82% homology, 57 different nucleotides
and 12 gaps were observed throughout the compared
DNA segments (Fig 3).

Nucleotideconserved region of deduced amino acid sequence
Nucleotide and corresponding deduced amino acid sequence
of a highly conserved region of polyhedrin gene (polh-cr).

On comparing amino acid sequence of the putative
polypeptide of Polh-cr (Acc# AAR04375) to its corresponding sequences of AcMNPV (Acc# AAA46736) and
other 4 SpliNPVs (Acc# AAW49208, BAA00824,
AAT10182 and AAW49207), 15 different amino acids
were observed throughout the compared putative
polypeptides using AcMNPV as a reference (Fig. 4). It is
note worthy to mention that all SpliNPVs amino acid
sequences (Acc# AAW49208, BAA00824, AAT10182 and
AAW49207) were identical to Polh-cr putative polypeptide
(Acc# AAR04375) except for the position 133 (I a.a. was
replaced with V a.a.).
Phylogenetic analyses of Polh-cr
Phylogenetic analyses have been performed on the Polh-cr
nucleotide seuquence and its deduced polypeptide and
results of these analyses are shown in Figs. (5 and 6). In
case of Polh-cr nucleotide seuquence, a phylogenetic tree
was generated from sequence data of 38 NPV isolates by
neighbor-joining distance analysis with maximum
sequence difference 0.75 (Fig. 5). The topology shows
four distinct lineages including 5, 21, 8 and 4 NPV isolates, respectively. The maximum nucleotide sequence
divergence was exhibited in lineage II. Meanwhile, the
NPV isolates appear in the other three lineages as monophyletic sister clades (Fig. 5). In case of Polh-cr deduced
amino acid seuquence, a phylogenetic tree was generated
from sequence data of 102 NPV isolates by neighbor-joining distance analysis with maximum sequence difference
0.75 (Fig. 6). The topology shows three distinct lineages
including 17, 60 and 25 NPV isolates, respectively. The
maximum divergence of amino acid sequences was exhib-

ited in lineage II. However, minimum divergence in case
of the other two lineages was observed. Otherwise, polyhedrins from many NPV isolates appear in monophyletic
sister clades (Fig. 6).

Discussion
To date, genetically engineered baculoviruses introduce a
promising research line to overcome the slow action of
baculoviruses as biocontrol agents. On the other hand,
searching for new natural baculovirus isolates with better
insecticidal characteristics is still a developing subject of
work (more safe and has not the risks of releasing genetically engineered product in nature). Although AcMNPV is
considered as the type species in the genus nucleopolyhedrovirus, 15 species and 471 tentative species of NPV have
been isolated [27]. Abul-Nasr [28] isolated an Egyptian
NPV from the cotton leaf worm S. littoralis. Cherry and
Summers [29] isolated the two reference NPV types A and
B. During 1986 – 1988, six natural isolates of SpliNPV
were isolated from Giza, Menya, Kaha, Tokh, KafrElsheikh and Gharbyia, Egypt (Khamiss, personal communication). Also, fifteen isolates of SpliNPV were isolated from the six above mentioned Egyptian localities in
addition to Fayoum, Sakkara, Menofyia, Benisuef, Asyut,
Sinnuris, Banha, Sharkyia and Elsaff-Giza, Egypt
(Khamiss, personal communication).
Combining our data with that presented by Khamiss and
by Seufi (personal communication), it can be concluded
that 34 NPV isolates have been collected from Egypt
between 1986 and 2000. This may reflect the suitability of
the Egyptian environment for not only gathering and collecting new baculovirus isolates but also for using them as
potential pesticides in integrated pest management (IPM)
programs. Given that baculoviruses have been isolated
from Upper as well as Lower Egypt, in which the cultivation was washed by chemical insecticides, it would be
expected to find more and more isolates in virgin regions
(where no insecticides were used).
The susceptibility of 2nd instar larvae of S. littoralis to the
two polyhedrovirus species reported in this study was
comparable to that observed by Lacey and coworkers [22].
They reported that LC50s were 1.77 × 103 and 3.05 × 103
occlusion bodies (OB)/mm2 for Anagrapha falcifera (AfMNPV) and Autographa californica (AcMNPV) when applied
to the neonate codling moth larvae. Our Egyptian isolate
(SpliNPV) showed similar results to that obtained by
Klein and Podoler against the Egyptian cotton leafworm
[30]. Abot and coworkers [31] clarified that LC50s of an
NPV isolate against two A. gemmatalis populations varied
from 129 to 316 OBs/ml diet. Their results fall within the
range obtained with our isolate. On the other hand, our
results showed lower LC50 when compared with that
reported by Pawar and Ramakrishnan [32] and Komolp-

ith and Ramakrishnan [33] whereas LC50 was 4.677 × 106
PIB/ml for 4-day old S. littoralis larvae. Similarly, Ashok
and Ramakrishnan [34] reported higher LC50 (7.1 × 106
PIB/ml) for 3-day old S. litura larvae. Also, Stiles and Himmerich [35] introduced higher LC50 of AcMNPV against H.
zea (3.46 × 104 – 6.38 × 105 PIB/ml). Finally, Abdel-Aziz
(personal communication) presented higher LC50s (1.8 ×
107 and 9.0 × 107 PIB/ml, respectively) for 2nd larval instar
of S. littoralis. The variability of LC50s is probably due to
the method of surface treatment, homogeneously treated
diet, feeding habit of the insect species [22] or due to difference in larval age [36,37]. It may also be due to difference in host susceptibility to NPV [4], number of virions
per occlusion body, virulence of the virus strain and/or
the difference in number of laboratory propagation cycles
for the viral isolate. According to Van-Beek and Huges
[38], the virulence of baculoviruses is best determined by
the speed with which a given virus kills the insect pest.
LT values presented in Table (1) indicated that SpliNPV
killed 2nd instar larvae of S. littoralis one day faster than
AcMNPV. In comparing our results with that presented by

other authors, many considerations have to be taken into
account. Host range and LC95s of the viral isolates are the
most important considerations. Although LC95 and LT95
that produced in this study are economically prohibitive,
improving the insecticidal characteristics of such isolates
(by formulation and synergistic additives) is a growing
subject in many companies.
The full length of polyhedrin gene from lepidopteran
NPVs ranged from 483 bp to 747 bp [39]. In case of polyhedrin gene from Spodoptera sp. NPVs, its full length
ranges from 510 bp to 747 bp in comparison to that from
Autographa sp. NPVs which ranges from 507 bp to 738 bp
[39]. Therefore, it could be said that Polh-cr represented
about 65% of the full length of polyhedrin gene. On comparing nucleotide sequence of Polh-cr to all available
sequences in the GenBank, it created a significant homology with 100 NPV and 11 GV genes. It showed 99%
identity with S. littoralis polyhedrin gene (Acc# D01017),
95% with S. littura polyhedrin gene (Acc# AY552474) and
93% with S. littura polyhedrin genes (Acc# AY549963,
AF325155, AF037262 and AF068189). In addition, it was

Comparison
Comparison of amino acid sequence of the putative polypeptide of Polh-cr (Acc# AAR04375) to its corresponding sequences of
AcMNPV (Acc# AAA46736) and other 4 SpliNPVs (Acc# AAW49208, BAA00824, AAT10182 and AAW49207, respectively).
The different amino acids were bolded and shaded using AcMNPV as a reference.

90% similar to Lymantria dispar polyhedrin genes (Acc#
AF499687, AF081810 and M23176), 88% to Malacosoma
neustria polyhedrin gene (Acc# X55658) and 87% to B.
mori polyhedrin genes (Acc# M10043 and X63614). Furthermore, it showed 86% homology with S. litura and
Amsacta albistriga polyhedrin genes (Acc# X94437 and
AF118850, respectively) and 85% with S. exigua and
Malacosoma neustria polyhedrin gene (Acc# AF169823;
AY127899 and AJ277555, respectively). These results
ensured that Polh-cr is a highly conserved region within
polyhedrin gene of about one sixth of the known NPV
species. Consequently, it could be used in many molecular techniques concerned with baculoviruses.
Knowing that the full length of polyhedrin protein from
lepidopteran NPVs ranges from 161 a.a. (e.g. Hyphanteria
cunea NPV, Acc# AAW49190 and Bombyx mori, Acc#
ABB16300) to 249 a.a. (e.g. Spodoptera litura NPVs, Acc#
AAZ78353, NP_258269 and AAS90121). In case of Spodoptera sp. NPV, full length of polyhedrin protein ranges
from 170 a.a. (Acc# AAW49204) to 249 a.a. (Acc#
AAZ78353) in comparison to Autographa sp. NPV which
ranges from 169 a.a. (Acc# AAW63393) to 246 a.a. (Acc#
AAA46736). The deduced amino acid sequence of Polh-cr
was compared to other polyhedrins. Alignment results
revealed that Polh-cr was 100% and 99% identical to S. lit-

toralis polyhedrins (Acc# AAC33752, AAR04375; P24646,
JU0382 and BAA00824, respectively). It was also 99%
similar to S. litura polyhedrins (Acc# NP258269,
AAC09246, AAL01689 and AAS58468). In addition, it has
98% identity with polyhedrin of S. littoralis (Acc#
AA590121). Furthermore, it showed 89% similarity with
polyhedrins of S. exigua and Ecotropis obligua polyhedrins
(Acc# AAF33532, JQ1868, NP037761, 001586;
AAB53632, AAQ88174, P07388 and AAA46739).
Using AcMNPV nucleotide sequence (Acc# M25054) and
amino acid sequence (Acc# AAA46736) as references for
comparison with our sequences, it was found that 57 different nucleotides and 12 gaps in nucleotide sequence
resulted in 15 different amino acids in the putative
polypeptide (I, N, V, V, E, D, S, T, A, T, S, D, K, Y and I a.a.
from our putative polypeptide were replaced with V, S, I,
I, D, E, V, N, S, H, E, N, R, E and V a.a. from AcMNPV putative polypeptide, respectively). Surprisingly, Polh-cr putative polypeptide was identical to SpliNPV polypeptides
(Acc# AAW49208, BAA00824, AAT10182 and
AAW49207) with one amino acid replacement (I with V
at the position 133). These results suggested the possible
difference in codon usage among the compared isolates. It
might also give a specific property to our putative
polypeptide.

Phylogenetic analyses of the Polh-cr nucleotide seuquence
and its deduced polypeptide revealed that Polh-cr is genetically related to a large number of published nucleotide
sequences and to a larger number of published amino
acid sequences. This finding made it is preferred to
develop kits that use viral protein (polyhedrin) in detecting NPVs because it will be wider-used than DNA method.

Conclusion
In this paper, we described the cloning and sequencing of
a highly conserved region in polyhedrin gene and the
insecticidal activity of an Egyptian NPV isolate. To our
knowledge, this is the first report that determines the
sequence of this conserved region in an Egyptian isolate.
Further studies to develop kits for ELISA, Western and dot
blotting, hybridization as well as potential biocontrol
agent are switched on. The availability of Polh-cr products
would be helpful in studies concerning ELISA, PCR and
other related molecular techniques. In addition, it provides a candidate for effective, sensitive and reproducible
diagnostic tools for screening insects or/and other arthropods, especially crustacean species, crabs and shrimps for
baculovirus infections and may be important in controlling (preventing/enhancing) baculovirus infection. Also,
it may be useful in monitoring the distribution of NPVs,
the fate of genes and release of wild type as well as genetically engineered NPVs. Furthermore, it will facilitate risk
assessment, ecological and viral epidemiological studies.
