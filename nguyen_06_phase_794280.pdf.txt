Abstract
Background: The origin of spliceosomal introns is the central subject of the introns-early versus
introns-late debate. The distribution of intron phases is non-uniform, with an excess of phase-0
introns. Introns-early explains this by speculating that a fraction of present-day introns were
present between minigenes in the progenote and therefore must lie in phase-0. In contrast, intronslate predicts that the nonuniformity of intron phase distribution reflects the nonrandomness of
intron insertions.
Results: In this paper, we tested the two theories using analyses of intron phase distribution. We
inferred the evolution of intron phase distribution from a dataset of 684 gene orthologs from seven
eukaryotes using a maximum likelihood method. We also tested whether the observed intron
phase distributions from 10 eukaryotes can be explained by intron insertions on a genome-wide
scale. In contrast to the prediction of introns-early, the inferred evolution of intron phase
distribution showed that the proportion of phase-0 introns increased over evolution. Consistent
with introns-late, the observed intron phase distributions matched those predicted by an intron
insertion model quite well.
Conclusion: Our results strongly support the introns-late hypothesis of the origin of spliceosomal
introns.

Background
The origin of spliceosomal introns – "extra" DNA
sequences that disrupt the coding regions in nuclear genes
of eukaryotes – is still a mystery. Since the evolution of
introns is closely related to the evolution of eukaryotic
genomes, understanding the origin of introns is vital for
understanding the evolution of eukaryotes. There are currently two opposing theories of intron origin. The intronsearly theory proposes that introns already existed at the
progenote (i.e., the last common ancestor of prokaryotes
and eukaryotes) to facilitate the construction of the first

genes [1-4]. The introns-late theory, on the other hand,
holds that genes at the progenote were intronless, similar
to those in present-day prokaryotes, and introns were
gained late, after the emergence of eukaryotes [5-7]. There
has been no decisive resolution to the debate, and each of
these theories has supporting arguments that have not
been satisfactorily disproved.
Introns can be located in one of three phases: phase-0, -1,
and -2 introns are defined as introns located before the
first, after the first, and after the second nucleotide of a

[10]; and MAG|GT [13,14]. (In these patterns, M is A or C,
R is A or G, and the vertical line represents the intron
insertion site.) However, there is still no clear evidence
that the observed distributions of intron phase are caused
by intron insertions [10,15].

codon, respectively. The phase of an intron is conserved
during evolution, because a variation in intron phase is
possible only through simultaneous mutations that alter
the 5' and 3' ends of the intron in a complementary manner [8]. The distribution of intron phases is non-uniform:
phase-0 introns occur most frequently and phase-2
introns occur least frequently [8-10].
The introns-early theory explains the non-uniform distribution by speculating that 35% of modern introns are
ancient, i.e., existed at the progenote to facilitate the
assembly of the first genes [4,11]. Since exons are remnants of primordial minigenes, most of these ancient
introns must lie in phase-0, resulting in the current excess
of phase-0 introns. However, this theory does not satisfactorily explain why phase-1 introns are more common
than phase-2 introns. In contrast, the introns-late theory
proposes that the nonuniformity of intron phase distribution may have arisen from nonrandom intron insertion
[7]. Introns have been proposed to be inserted only into a
fixed sequence pattern, termed a "proto-splice site" [12].
Several potential patterns for proto-splice sites have been
proposed, for example MAG|R [12]; G|G, AG|G, AG|GT

In this paper, we tested the introns-early and introns-late
theories using two independent approaches: (i) by inferring the evolution of intron phase distribution and (ii) by
retesting whether intron phase distribution reflects the
nonrandomness of intron insertions. The results show
that there is a general trend over evolution toward increasing the preponderance of phase-0 introns and that the
observed phase distribution of introns can be indeed
explained by an intron insertion model. Consequently,
our results seem to support the explanation provided by
the introns-late theory for the nonuniformity of intron
phase distribution.

Results
Inference of the evolution of intron phase distribution
Figure 1 shows the evolution of intron phase distribution
inferred from intron patterns in conserved regions of 684
gene orthologs from seven eukaryotes using an assumed
ecdysozoa tree and the maximum likelihood method of
estimating rates of intron gains and losses. There is a general trend toward an increasing proportion of phase-0
introns caused by gained introns. For two branches, one
from the crown ancestor to Arabidopsis thaliana and the
other from the ecdysozoa ancestor to Caenorhabditis elegans, the differences between phase distributions of
gained introns and ancestral introns are statistically significant (P = 8.3 × 10-16 and 1.8 × 10-5, respectively). In contrast, differences between the phase distributions of lost
introns and ancestral introns are not statistically significant for any branch that has data for lost introns. Our
result for the evolution of intron phase distribution thus
suggests that the nonuniformity of intron phase distribution is more likely to be due to the nonrandomness of
intron insertions.
Compilation of a genome-wide dataset
In order to test the introns-late prediction that intron
phase distribution is non-uniform, we compiled a dataset
from the entire genomes of 10 eukaryotes (Table 1). These
10 species were chosen because they cover a broad range
of evolutionary distance and their genomes are well annotated. In this dataset, the average number of introns per
gene varies from 1.0 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe to 8.1 in
Homo sapiens. The GC content of the coding regions in the
genomes ranges from 24% in Plasmodium falciparum to
56% in Neurospora crassa, and the distribution of phase-0
introns ranges from 38.2% in N. crassa to 57.6% in A. thaliana. In all species the intron phase distributions show an
obvious pattern of phase-0 > phase-1 > phase-2; the only

exception is A. thaliana, in which the distribution of
phase-2 introns is slightly larger than that of phase-1
introns. These results are consistent with previously published results (e.g., ref. [10]).

Prediction of intron phase distribution for the all-pattern
model
Figure 2 shows the intron phase distributions predicted by
an intron insertion model (hereafter, the all-pattern
model) in which introns can be inserted into any
sequence pattern, but are inserted into different patterns
with different frequencies. The predicted intron phase distributions matched the observed ones quite well for GC-

tral (52%) GC content and its high density of introns. The
analysis indicated that 98% of A. thaliana introns already
existed in its last common ancestor with O. sativa, and the
inferred GC content for this ancestor was 54%. The result
suggests that the large reduction in GC content (from 54%
to 47%) in A. thaliana is likely to be the main cause for its
large prediction error. (Note that although the GC content
of RP genes is somewhat different from the average GC
content in each whole genome, this does not affect the
result significantly, as only the relative differences are
important here.) It is possible that when introns are
inserted, the exon junctions surrounding introns are subjected to a much lower mutation rate than the average
mutation rate in the genes of fast-evolving species due to
the need for efficient splicing. Consequently, the intron
phase distributions predicted using current sequences in
fast-evolving species would not match the observed data.

rich species with GC content >50% (e.g., N. crassa and
Drosophila melanogaster), but did not match for GC-poor
species with GC content <50% (e.g., A. thaliana and C. elegans). For all GC-poor species, the largest errors in prediction occurred in phase-0 and phase-1 introns; the
proportions of phase-0 introns were underestimated
whereas those of phase-1 introns were overestimated.
Note that although most Xenopus tropicalis introns are
shared with H. sapiens introns (unpublished data), the GC
content is 5% lower and the prediction error is much
larger in X. tropicalis. Based on this observation, we speculated that the larger prediction errors in GC-poor species
may be due to higher mutation rates.
Inference of the GC content and intron density in the RP
gene dataset
To test our speculation that the prediction errors were due
to high mutation rates, we compiled a smaller dataset
containing 79 orthologs of ribosomal protein (RP) genes
from four species: A. thaliana, Oryza sativa, Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, and H. sapiens, and inferred the evolution of
GC content and intron density (Figure 3). The three plant
species were chosen because A. thaliana had the largest
prediction error using the all-pattern model (Figure 2).
The outgroup H. sapiens was chosen due to its nearly neu-

Prediction of intron phase distribution with mutation
correction
To accommodate this source of error in fast-evolving species, we proposed a simple model for mutation correction
and used it to re-predict the intron phase distributions for
all species in the genome-wide dataset (Figure 4). The best
mutation rates (the rate at which the prediction error is
smallest), the corresponding GC contents, the predicted
intron phase distributions, the prediction errors, and the
standard deviations for all species are provided in Table 2.
As shown in Figure 4, the differences between the predicted intron phase distributions and the observed ones
were now not statistically significant (i.e., P > 0.05) for H.
sapiens, N. crassa, Fusarium graminearum, Cryptococcus neoformans, A. thaliana, and X. tropicalis. There are several
lines of evidence for the validity of our mutation correction model. First, for A. thaliana, the GC content at the
best mutation rate was 57.6% (Table 2 [see Additional file
1]), a value very close to the inferred 54% of the last common ancestor of A. thaliana and O. sativa in the 79
orthologs of RP genes (Figure 3). It is possible that this
value was the average GC content of A. thaliana during the
period when most of its introns were gained. Second, the
best prediction errors and GC contents of H. sapiens and
X. tropicalis were close to each other, in agreement with the
fact that most H. sapiens introns are shared with those of
X. tropicalis and their divergence is quite recent (unpublished data). (The small difference between the two
inferred best GC contents is likely due to difference in the
GC content of the second bases of codons, because our
model does not correct for mutations at these bases.)
Third, the inferred best GC contents of the two other animals: D. melanogaster and C. elegans were also very close to
those of H. sapiens and X. tropicalis. Finally, our result suggests that the human genome is evolving toward decreasing its GC content, consistent with the result of Meunier
and Duret [16].

Discussion
The introns-early theory explains the excess of phase-0
introns by predicting that a fraction of present-day introns
are ancient and these introns were in phase-0. If this
explanation is correct, the excess of phase-0 introns
should generally decrease during eukaryotic evolution as

new introns are inserted into random positions. A direct
test of the explanation of the introns-early theory for the
excess of phase-0 introns is therefore to infer the evolution
of intron phase distribution from observed data. This test
was first performed by Roy et al. [17]. Using a dataset of
280 ancient genes (unpublished), they divided the

present-day introns into two categories: lineage-specific
introns and widely phylogenetically distributed introns,
which are thought to be rough estimates of recently
gained introns and ancestral introns, respectively. They
found that the presumed ancestral introns had a stronger
phase-0 bias than the lineage-specific introns (Table 3 of
ref. [17]). In contrast, our results (Figure 1) show a general
trend over evolution toward an increase in the excess of
phase-0 introns. We believe that this discrepancy is more
likely due to different datasets than to different classification methods because when a classification method similar to that used in ref. [17] was applied to the current
dataset, a stronger phase-0 bias in lineage-specific introns
was obtained [18]. Another reason for this discrepancy
may be that all of the 280 gene families in the dataset used
in ref. [17] are ancient, and these gene families may show
a different pattern of evolution of intron phase distribution than younger gene families. However, when we used
a smaller dataset of 79 RP gene families – all of which are
believed to be ancient – from the same seven species studied here [19], the result was still inconsistent with that in
ref. [17] (data not shown).
Sverdlov et al. [18] suggested that the stronger phase-0
bias in lineage-specific introns than in widely distributed
introns refuted the explanation of the introns-early
hypothesis. However, it should be stressed that this conclusion cannot always be drawn from this result: The
explanation of introns-early may still be correct even
when lineage-specific introns have stronger phase-0 bias
than widely distributed introns. Consider the following
example: suppose a species has 200 current introns with a
phase distribution of 100:50:50, and 100 of these are
widely distributed introns with a phase distribution of
40:30:30. Therefore, the species also has 100 lineage-specific introns with a phase distribution of 60:20:20. We
suppose further that all 100 lineage-specific introns were
gained recently and there are also 100 introns specific to
this species that have been lost. If the phase distribution
of the lost introns is 40:30:30, the phase distribution of
ancestral introns will be 80:60:60, which has less phase-0
bias than the current introns. However, if the phase distribution of lost introns is 80:10:10, the phase distribution
of ancestral introns will be 120:40:40, which has more
phase-0 bias than the current introns. Thus, no decisive
conclusion can be reached by comparing intron phase distributions between lineage-specific introns and widely
distributed introns. In contrast, by using the maximum
likelihood method to infer a set of most reliable events
(>90% probability of occurrence), we were able to estimate the intron phase distribution at each ancestral node.
Our result for the evolution of intron phase distribution
suggests that the excess of phase-0 introns is more likely to
be caused by the nonrandomness of intron gains. How-

ever, all previous studies failed to prove this at a satisfactory level [10,15]. Therefore, we decided to re-test this
prediction on a large scale using genome-wide data from
10 model species. We first used the fixed-pattern intron
insertion model, in which introns are inserted only into
proto-splice sites, and our experimental results (data not
shown) were consistent with previous results [10], in
which the intron phase distributions predicted from the
distributions of four potential proto-splice sites (G|G,
AG|G, AG|GT, and MAG|R) did not match the observed
ones.
Another model of intron insertion has been proposed in
which introns are either randomly inserted into sequences
but with different rates of fixation or are preferentially
inserted into a consensus sequence [14,20,21]. We therefore tested the all-pattern intron insertion model, in
which introns can be inserted into any pattern of
sequences but are inserted into different patterns with different frequencies. Since the frequencies of intron insertion may vary from species to species, these frequencies
were obtained from the observed data separately for each
species. The results (Figure 2) show that the model predicted intron phase distributions well in GC-rich species
but not in GC-poor species. Analysis of a smaller dataset
of 79 orthologs of RP genes shows that higher mutation
rates are very likely the main cause for the higher prediction errors in GC-poor species (Figure 3). Therefore, we
proposed a simple model for mutation correction and
used it to predict intron phase distributions for all species
again. As expected, the predicted intron phase distributions now matched the observed data for both GC-rich
and GC-poor species, with differences in six out of ten
species that were not statistically significant (Figure 4 and
Table 2).
Although the predicted intron phase distributions of four
remaining species (D. melanogaster, C. elegans, S. pombe,
and P. falciparum) account quite well for the observed distributions (Figure 4), their differences were still statistically significant. It is possible that the assumption of not
changing amino acid sequences in our mutation correction model did not fully compensate for the mutation
effect in S. pombe and P. falciparum, as they have very low
GC contents. The larger errors in D. melanogaster and C.
elegans may be partly due to the nonuniformity of intron
losses, because both species suffered from high rates of
intron loss after their divergence from H. sapiens [22].
Moreover, since other factors such as annotation mistakes
on exon/intron structures may also affect the results, we
should not put too much weight on statistical tests. Therefore, we conclude that the all-pattern intron insertion
model may explain intron phase distributions even when
statistical equivalence is not reached.

The intron phase distributions are lineage-specific and
may be affected by two factors: changes in DNA sequences
and changes in intron insertion frequencies. The latter
may reflect changes in the efficiency with which the splicing machinery splices out introns. When the intron insertion frequencies learned from H. sapiens were used to
predict N. crassa sequences, the predicted intron phase
distribution was 44:32:24, much closer to the distribution
observed in H. sapiens (45:31:24) than in N. crassa
(38:34:28). This indicates that the change in intron insertion frequencies has stronger effect on the intron phase
distribution than the change in DNA sequences.

Conclusion
The debate surrounding introns-early versus introns-late
remains vigorous [23,24]. We previously provided two
lines of support for the introns-late view: there is no general trend over evolution toward decreasing intron density
[[22], but also see ref. [25]]; and there was no clear case of
intron position conservation in a set of 25 cytoplasmic RP
genes of archaeal origin and mitochondrial RP genes of
bacterial origin, which are thought to have diverged at the
progenote [26]. In this paper, we have provided two more
lines of support for introns-late from analyses of intron
phase distribution: the current excess of phase-0 introns is
due to the excess of phase-0 among gained introns and
not to the remnants of minigenes; and the all-pattern
intron insertion model can explain the observed intron
phase distributions in various species. These results
should help to resolve the long-standing but important
debate about the origin of spliceosomal introns.

Methods
Inference of the evolution of intron phase distribution
Koonin's group [27] compiled intron patterns in the conserved regions of 684 gene orthologs from eight eukaryotes, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, H. sapiens, C. elegans,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. pombe, A. thaliana, and P. falciparum. We used this database for our analysis, but
excluded S. cerevisiae due to its sparse intron distribution.
Following our previous analysis [22], we assumed the
ecdysozoa tree for these species and applied our maximum likelihood method to infer rates of intron gains and
losses as well as the distribution of introns in the last common ancestor of these species. These parameters were
then used to infer the most reliable events (>90% confidence) for intron gain and loss along each branch and for
intron presence at each ancestor. Phase distributions were
then calculated for these events using the phase information for each intron pattern. Note that our method [22]
assumes the same model of intron evolution with the

Compilation of a genome-wide dataset
We downloaded data about the genomes of six eukaryotes
(H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, S. pombe, A. thaliana, and P. falciparum) from NCBI [31], three eukaryotes
(N. crassa, F. graminearum, and C. neoformans) from
BROAD Institute's Fungal Genome Initiative website [32],
and X. tropicalis from the JGI Eukaryotic Genomics website [33]. For all genomes except X. tropicalis, gene structures were built using annotation. For X. tropicalis, there
was no annotation for gene structures, so we first used the
cDNA sequences as input to the BLAST program [34] to
query against the DNA sequences. Then the DNA region
covering the query result of each cDNA sequence was
extracted and the SIM4 program [35] was used to reconstruct the exon/intron structure. If SIM4 failed to reconstruct the exon/intron structure of a gene (i.e., either
match ratio or cover ratio <100%), this gene was discarded. An ad hoc program was written in the C programming language to automate the construction of gene
structures.

The genes of each genome were then subjected to a purging process to remove redundancy by using a criterion of
< 20% amino acid identity. If a pair of genes had identity
≥20%, the one with fewer introns was removed. Another
ad hoc program, which makes use of the program ALIGN
[36] for calculating the identity of a pair of amino acid
sequences, was written in C to automate the purging process.
Prediction of intron phase distribution for the all-pattern
model
In the all-pattern intron insertion model, we used patterns
of 5-bp length, with 3 bp upstream and 2 bp downstream
of the splice sites. The number of patterns, N, is therefore
1,024 (= 45). Let Oi (i = 1..N) be the count of pattern i
among all observed splice sites; Ci (i = 1..N) be the count
of pattern i in all coding regions; and Dij (i = 1..N, j = 0..2)
be the count of pattern i appearing at phase j in all coding
regions. The preference of intron insertion in pattern i is
proportional to Ei = Oi/Ci and the frequency of intron
insertion in pattern i, Fi, is calculated by:

Fi = Ei

N

∑ Ei

(1)

i =1

Then the expected number of phase-j introns, Pj, is calculated by:
N

Pj = ∑ Dij × Fi

(2)

i =1

Finally, the expected percentage of phase-j introns, Wj, is
calculated by:

Inference of the GC content and intron density in the RP
gene dataset
We compiled 79 orthologs of RP genes from four eukaryotes: H. sapiens, A. thaliana, O. sativa, and C. reinhardtii.
The RP genes of H. sapiens and A. thaliana were taken from
the manually curated Ribosomal Protein Gene database
[19]. The RP genes of O. sativa and C. reinhardtii were first
collected from the TIGR Rice Genome Annotation website
[37] and the JGI Eukaryotic Genomics website [33],
respectively, by performing BLAST searches using RP
genes of A. thaliana as queries. Their gene structures were
then manually constructed by using both annotation and
the gene structures of H. sapiens and A. thaliana as references. When a gene of a species existed in multiple copies,
the copy with the most introns was used.

in the range (-1, +1) using the Brent search algorithm [40].
Intron phase distribution predicted using the best mutation rate was taken as the output. A program was written
in C to automatically perform the prediction of intron
phase distribution for the all-pattern intron insertion
model, both with and without mutation correction.

Multiple sequence alignments for each of these gene
orthologs were built using CLUSTAL W [38], and an ad hoc
program was written in C to extract an intron presence/
absence matrix and the conserved DNA regions of these
alignments. The conserved regions were then concatenated together and the DNAML program of the PHYLIP
package [39] was used to infer the phylogenetic tree and
GC contents of the internal nodes of these four species.
The GC contents were based only on inferred sites of
>95% confidence. Finally, the intron presence/absence
matrix and the phylogenetic tree (with H. sapiens as the
outgroup) were used as input to our maximum likelihood
method [22] to infer the intron evolution for these species.
Prediction of intron phase distribution with mutation
correction
We applied a simple model for mutation correction in
which only mutations [see Additional file 2] that change
the GC content of a codon but do not affect the translated
amino acid are allowed. All positions that allow these
mutations are assumed to have the same mutation rate,
with positive/negative values meaning that these mutations will happen in the direction that increases/decreases
the GC content of a codon. For each mutation rate, the
original sequences were randomly mutated using this rate
and then the intron phase distribution was predicted
using the same protocol for the all-pattern model, but
with Ci and Dij taken from the mutated sequences instead
of the original sequences. The simulated mutation correction was repeated 20 times and the average of the 20 χ2
values between the predicted and observed intron phase
distributions was used as the prediction error for the
mutation rate. We then searched for the best mutation
rate (i.e., the rate at which the prediction error is smallest)
