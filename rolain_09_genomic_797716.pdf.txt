Abstract
Background: Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen responsible for a variety of
nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Recent reports show that the prevalence of
Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is increasing. In 2006
in Marseille, France, we have detected an atypical MRSA strain with a specific antibiotic
susceptibility profile and a unique growth phenotype. Because of the clinical importance of the
spread of such strain among CF patients we decided to sequence the genome of one representative
isolate (strain CF-Marseille) to compare this to the published genome sequences. We also
conducted a retrospective epidemiological analysis on all S. aureus isolated from 2002 to 2007 in
CF patients from our institution.
Results: CF-Marseille is multidrug resistant, has a hetero-Glycopeptide-Intermediate resistance S.
aureus phenotype, grows on Cepacia agar with intense orange pigmentation and has a thickened
cell wall. Phylogenetic analyses using Complete Genome Hybridization and Multi Locus VNTR
Assay showed that CF-Marseille was closely related to strain Mu50, representing vancomycinresistant S. aureus. Analysis of CF-Marseille shows a similar core genome to that of previously
sequenced MRSA strains but with a different genomic organization due to the presence of specific

mobile genetic elements i.e. a new SCCmec type IV mosaic cassette that has integrated the pUB110
plasmid, and a new phage closely related to phiETA3. Moreover this phage could be seen by
electron microscopy when mobilized with several antibiotics commonly used in CF patients
including, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, or imipenem. Phylogenetic analysis of
phenotypically similar h-GISA in our study also suggests that CF patients are colonized by
polyclonal populations of MRSA that represents an incredible reservoir for lateral gene transfer.
Conclusion: In conclusion, we demonstrated the emergence and spreading of a new isolate of
MRSA in CF patients in Marseille, France, that has probably been selected in the airways by
antibiotic pressure. Antibiotic-mediated phage induction may result in high-frequency transfer and
the unintended consequence of promoting the spread of virulence and/or antibiotic resistance
determinants. The emergence of well-adapted MRSA is worrying in such population chronically
colonized and receiving many antibiotics and represents a model for emergence of uncontrollable
super bugs in a specific niche.

Background
Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen responsible for a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired
infections ranging from mild to life -threatening diseases
[1]. Along with the spread of this bacterium, an increase
of antibiotic resistance has been reported over the last decades. Since the early sixties, methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(MRSA) has caused large, life-threatening nosocomial
outbreaks worldwide [2]. Initially, early isolates were also
resistant to others antibiotics, and gentamicin-resistant
MRSA (GR-MRSA) became epidemic in Australia, the
United States, and Europe in the 1980s [3]. During the
past two decades, the prevalence of MRSA involving both
nosocomial and community-acquired infections has
increased throughout the world [4]. In the late 1990s,
community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) showing specific
genomic determinants became of major concern worldwide [5]. The emergence and spread of new MRSA strains
susceptible to gentamicin (GS-MRSA) has been reported
over the last ten years in European countries, especially in
France [6-8]. Recent advances in the field of genome
sequencing have provided new insights into the genetic
diversity of these pathogens [9,10] and enabled the development of parallel tools to study clinical isolates at the
organism scale [11-13]. To date, thirteen fully annotated
S. aureus genomes are publicly available with eight being
published [11-16]. The genome sequences of S. aureus
have shown a well conserved core region corresponding
to approximately 80% of the genome, but also displays a
wide diversity of accessory genetic elements [13]. These
observations confirm important genetic diversity and
high plasticity of the bacterium and suggest that these
contribute to its adaptation to environmental changes,
including antibiotic selection pressure.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) remains an important hereditary disease in Europe and is characterized by chronic suppurative
airway disease with progressive respiratory insufficiency
[17]. The CF airways may represent a model of emergence
of resistant bacteria in this specific niche, where many different bacteria are in close contact, increasing the frequency of potential lateral gene transfer. About 50 to 80%
of CF children and adolescents are chronically colonized
or infected by Staphylococcus aureus and are regularly
treated with antibiotics without reaching complete eradication [17,18]. Such suboptimal antibiotic pressure in a
selected niche is known to contribute to alter ecology in
the environment and affect evolutionary trajectories especially for rapid evolution and artificial selection of multidrug resistant bacteria [19,20]. A recent report shows that
the prevalence of MRSA infections in CF patients is
increasing [18], a phenomenon attributed to the antibiotic selection pressure [21,22]. During chronic infection
in CF, strong selective pressure is exerted on bacterial
pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus,
especially during treatment with tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and colistin, leading to discernable variations in
the clonal lineages [23]. Phage mobilization contributes
significantly to genome alteration in S. aureus during
infection [24] and recent evidence has demonstrated that
antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim can
cause phage induction in S. aureus isolates from CF
patients [25]. Moreover, it is well known that coevolution
with bacteriophages is a major factor for the evolution
and diversification of bacterial populations that could
lead to antibiotic resistance [26,27]. In this particular scenario, highly adapted S. aureus strains to a specific environment may emerge and spread among this sensitive
patient population.

Study design
In 2006 in Marseille, France, during an epidemiological
survey of S. aureus in CF patients, we have detected an
atypical GS-MRSA strain with a specific antibiotic susceptibility profile and a unique growth phenotype. The strain
was susceptible to gentamicin and resistant to tobramycin, kanamycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, and ofloxacin.
The isolate had a hetero-Glycopeptide-Intermediate phenotype of resistance (GISA) and grew with atypical intense
orange pigmentation on Cepacia agar (Figure 1a). Because
of the clinical importance of the spread of such strain
among CF patients we sequenced the genome of one representative isolate (CF-Marseille) and compared this to
the published genome sequences, to detect new genetic
features responsible for pathogenicity, epidemicity or
antibiotic resistance. For this purpose we used high
throughput sequencing system (454 Life Science Corp.,
Roche) [28] coupled with microarrays and molecular genotyping methods to decipher specificities of this isolate in
the CF population. We also conducted a retrospective epidemiological analysis on all S. aureus isolated from 2002
to 2007 in CF patients from our institution to understand
dynamics of change and spread of the different strain phenotypes. Finally, specific sequences found in the newly
sequenced genome were used to design primers to trace
the strain in an epidemic setting [29].

Results
Phenotype of strain CF-Marseille
The cell wall of CF-Marseille was significantly thicker
(33.5 +/- 5.8 nm, n = 100 measurements) than MSSA
strain CIP 76.25 (24.7 +/- 4.0 nm, n = 100 measurements)
(p < 10-3) (Figure 1b). Presence of phages was not visualized by electron microscopy without induction whereas
phages were seen when antibiotics were added to the
medium (Figure 1c). Antibiotics able to induce phages
were fusidic acid, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, rifampin and imipenem whereas oxacillin,
ceftazidime,
vancomycin,
fosfomycin,
thiamphenicol, and colistin were not. Apart from its specific antibiotic susceptibility profile, CF-Marseille has a
vancomycin MIC of 2–2.5 μg/ml (Etest strips with cell suspensions calibrated at 2 McFarland units) but satellite colonies grew within the ellipse of growth inhibition (Figure
1d). Profile analysis population with teicoplanin confirmed that some colonies were able to grow at 4 μg/ml
(Additional file 1), thus displaying a hetero-GISA phenotype [30].
CF-Marseille Genome and specific transcription profiling
The 454 sequencing of GS-MRSA strain CF-Marseille
genome gave a total of 19,064,566 nucleotides that gave a
total of 131 assembled contigs with sizes ranging from
546 to 210,978 bp. The contig sizes sum up to 2,829,971
bp. The total contigs size of 2.83 Mbp provides a lower

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/1

bound of the chromosome size of CF-Marseille. The 131
contigs are available in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence
Database, accession number DS:71627. We compared the
CF-Marseille strain to other S. aureus strains on the basis
of their protein contents. A CoDing Sequence (CDS) prediction was performed with the Glimmer software 1,
which revealed the presence of 2736 hypothetical proteins in the 131 contigs. As compared to the other S.
aureus proteins available in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
database 2 (considered strains were N315, MW2,
USA300, Mu50, NCTC 8325, COL and MRSA252), 2675
out of 2736 predicted proteins showed a match of at least
90% of aminoacid identity. The strains USA300/Mu50
shows the closest protein content with 2522 matches, corresponding to more that 95% of the detected CF-Marseille
proteome. The 61 proteins that did not match mostly consist of phagic proteins and very short CDS that are likely
to be false positive (Open reading frame that do not correspond to CDS).
Analysis of the accessory genome of CF-Marseille revealed
the presence of a new phage of 44 Kb closely related to the
recently sequenced phage phiETA3 found in S. aureus
strain JH1-JH9 [31]. Similarity search at the protein level
showed that parts of this element are found in numerous
other phages including phiETA3, phiROSA, phiNM4 or
phage 96, whereas the function of an important number
of putative ORFs remain hypothetical.
Most of the genes differentially expressed between strains
found in CF patient and isolates never found in CF patient
(see Additional file 2), involved phage elements or resistance determinants, which is consistent with the CGH
results. The only gene showing higher expression in the
non-CF isolates compared to CF isolates was spxA, a transcription regulator involved in the biosysnthesis of thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme found down-regulated during
treatment with hypochlorite [32] or in the presence of berberine chloride [33] and whose deletion yields to the
accumulation of biofilm onto surface. Comparison
between strains currently isolated in Marseille and CFMarseille yields a limited number of differentially regulated genes. All these genes belong to phage elements and
resistance determinants. Among these were ermC (a gene
conferring resistance to erythromycin) and ORFs of the
phage (Additional file 2). Most of the targets showing differential expression corresponded to up-regulated genes
in one of the phages identified in strain CF-Marseille and
potentially in other strains of our collection.
Antibiotic resistance gene s in the genome of strain CFMarseille
In the genome of CF-Marseille, resistance to beta-lactams
and ofloxacin are chromosomally-encoded (Table 1).
Indeed, resistance to ofloxacin can be attributed to a chro-

Ser84Leu in the gyrase gene gyrA (contig 00393). The
SCCmec element in CF-Marseille is novel. Although
sequence analysis suggested that it is a type IV cassette
containing recombinases ccrA2 and ccrB2, genotyping
experiments showed relatedness with N315, a HA-MRSA
containing a type II cassette (accession number
AM943017). A refined analysis of recombinase sequences
revealed that ccrA2 of CF-Marseille was identical to ccrA2
of strain N315 whereas ccrB2 of CF-Marseille was similar
to that of strain MW2. This cassette was also peculiar with
a size of 29493 bp with the integration of the pUB110
plasmid carrying kanamycin and bleomycin resistance
(Figure 2). Thus the SCCmec cassette of CF-Marseille is a
mosaic of elements from a type II (nosocomial origin)
and a type IV (community origin) cassette. Resistance to
macrolides (erythromycin) and tetracycline is encoded on
plasmid pWBG738 (contig 00364, 98% homology with
Genbank sequence 007209) identified in CA-MRSA strain
ST1-MRSA-IV similar to strain MW2. Other antibiotic
encoding genes were found in the genome including a
metallo-betalactamase (contig 00393 and 00379) as well
as several ABC transporters.
Origin and spreading of CF-Marseille
From May 2001 to December 2006, 108 adults (age ≤ 18
years) and 98 children or adolescents (age < 18 years)
were followed in the two CF centres. Overall, 127 patients
(61.7%) were found to be colonized at least once by S.
aureus (82 children, 83.7% and 45 adults, 41.7%) and

represented 699 isolates encompassing 270 non redundant strains (182 in children, 67.4% and 88 in adults,
32.6%). Among these 270 strains, 80 were resistant to
methicillin (29.6%) with 56 (70%) in children and 24
(30%) in adults. Among these 80 MRSA isolates, 18/56
(32.1%) and 7/24 (29.2%) showed the CF-Marseille phenotype in children and adults, respectively. The CF-Marseille phenotype was firstly detected in 2002 and since
then newly detected isolates have increased to reach a
total of 25 patients (Figure 3). Presence of CF-Marseille
was significantly associated with P. aeruginosa colonization (22/25 patients) when compared to patients colonized with MSSA (56/190) (p < 0.05). In addition, when
compared to acquisition of MSSA, the risk of acquisition
of CF-Marseille was twice higher in patients with P. aeruginosa infection and colistin treatment (Risk ratio = 2.00
[1.02–3.99]; p = 0.047). Phylogenetic relationship
between the 29 additional strains isolated in the same
hospital from CF patients and from 10 non-CF patients
using multi-locus variable number of tandem repeat assay
(MLVA) is given in Figure 4. Patient information and typing of the strains are given in Additional file 3. By combining these results with those of oxacillin/methicillin
sensitivity, it can be seen that one large group is formed
exclusively of MRSA isolated both from cystic fibrosis and
non-CF patients (group A). This cluster is composed of
SCCmec IV isolates with a type 1 agr locus. The second
group is composed of both MRSA and MSSA strains, isolated from cystic fibrosis and non-CF patients (group B).
CF-Marseille belongs to Group B (arrow on Figure 4). In
this subgroup, strain CF-Marseille co-clustered with several isolates harbouring SCCmec IV element and type 2 agr
loci but also with strains harbouring SCCmec II elements.
Based on the structure of the MLVA tree, this cluster segregated distantly from control community acquired isolates
such as MW2 or USA300. Among the sequenced isolates
used as controls for the MLVA assay, strain CF-Marseille
appears highly related to N315, a Japanese isolate harboring a type II SCCmec element showed to evolve to the
GISA phenotype. A third smaller group (Group C) is
exclusively formed of MSSA strains isolated from cystic
fibrosis patients and it is separate from Group A and
Group B in the dendrogram analysis. This small cluster of

14 out of 21 MRSA strains from CF patients and 3 out of
10 MRSA strains from non-CF patients contained the
phage found in CF-Marseille as determined using specific
primers and probe. Complete genome hybridization
shows that CF-Marseille appears clearly related to N315/
Mu50 in terms of genomic content, as shown by microarray CGH experiments, covering 100% and 95% of N315
and Mu50 ORFs, respectively as well as 96% of ORFs
detected in 6 other sequenced strains (Additional file 4).
In terms of genetic content, the genome of CF-Marseille
displays some alterations compared to other strains currently isolated in Marseille. Plasmids and other mobile
elements encoding for specific resistance determinants
were clearly visible during this comparison. Parts of
sequenced phages were also present in CF-Marseille and

absent in the other strains (in particular segments of a
phage characterized in USA300). CF-Marseille was also
the only strain to harbor enterotoxin m and the sdrD
genes. In addition, some important genes such as part of
the agr locus (particularly the conserved gene agrB) presented some divergence between the 2 populations. List of
genes absent in CF-Marseille but present in the other isolates contained only mobile genetic elements such as
resistance determinants or integrases originating probably
from different phages harbored in the 2 strain populations.

years period demonstrates that the prevalence of MRSA in
our CF population was higher than previous reports
worldwide with a rapid spreading during the last 2 years.
In the United States, approximately 12% of CF patients

have had infection with MRSA [34], although its prevalence may vary among centres [18]. In France, the
"Observatoire National de la Mucoviscidose" in 1999
reported a prevalence of 57.6% of patients with S. aureus

Page 7 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:1

with 9.2% being MRSA. This percentage increased in
2004, with a mean of 14.5%, with similar results in children and adults (unpublished data). Overall in our two
centres in Marseille, prevalence of S. aureus was 61% with
a percentage of MRSA of approximately 30%, with the CFMarseille phenotype representing more than 30% of the
MRSA. In an outbreak of resistant bacteria, the identification of genes associated with virulence or antibiotic resistance should be rapidly performed [35]. For this purpose,
we have used the most advanced and rapid approach to
characterize this strain at the organism scale. The use of
high-throughput sequencing engineered by 454 Life Science Corp. gives approximately 100-fold increase in
throughput over current Sanger sequencing technology
with 96% coverage and 99.96% accuracy in only 4 hours
[28]. The short lengths of sequences obtained (approximately 100 bp) makes the presence of repeated regions
above this size an obstacle to the molecular closing of the
genome. In our case, because isolates of the same species
were already sequenced and as only gene content appears
relevant, we speculate that repeated regions may not be a
constraint for the detection of important genes at the
molecular level without finishing the assembly of the
genome [36].
Analysis of CF-Marseille shows a similar core genome to
that of previously sequenced MRSA strains but with a different genomic organization due to the presence of specific mobile genetic elements i.e. a new SCCmec type IV
cassette that has integrated the pUB110 plasmid, and a
new phage closely related to phiETA3 [31]. Interestingly,
the 454 technology was more powerful and complementary to the microarray technology since these two genetic
elements were not elucidated using only microarray analysis. Comparison of CF-Marseille strain with other available genomes using CGH and MLVA showed that CFMarseille was closely related to strain Mu50 [12], representing vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. This observation
was confirmed by MLST, as strain CF-Marseille co-clustered with different strains previously described as GISA,
such as ST5, ST239 or ST105. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that strain CF-Marseille probably has a great potential
to develop a GISA phenotype. Phenotypically, CF-Marseille appears susceptible to vancomycin (MIC = 2 μg/ml)
but exhibits low level resistance with subpopulations
being able to grow at 4 μg/ml with a thickened cell wall
similar to that of strain Mu3, the quintessential heteroGISA [30,37]. This phenotype has been recently reported
in CF patients in a Belgian hospital [38]. The mechanism
of glycopeptide resistance in S. aureus is not fully understood, although changes in cell surface phenotypes have
been described including a thickened cell wall, an
increased amount of glutamine non-amidated muropeptides and decreased cross-linking of the cell wall peptidoglycan [39,40]. The intense orange pigmentation may also

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/1

be linked to a h-GISA phenotype since it has been shown
that S. aureus under stress conditions may activate sigB
regulon, associated with the overexpression of carotenoïde synthesis and an increase in cell wall thickness and
glycopeptide resistance [41,42].
Molecular detection, using primers and probe, of the new
phage in additional strains isolated from CF patients was
also possible thanks to the genome analysis and allowed
us to design a specific tool to trace the epidemic strain in
our institution. Interestingly, we found that MRSA isolates
from non-CF patients may contain this new phage, suggesting that it could spread in our hospital as well. However, a striking difference was observed in strain CFMarseille in that it shows a clear up-regulation of parts of
phage genes as compared to all other strain groups tested
by genome-wide transcription profiling. This observation
appears important in the context of an infection as
prophages have been shown to contribute to strain virulence through tissue tropism [31]. Because prophages are
induced by stress conditions and antibiotic pressure
[25,43], both conditions present in the airway of CF
patients, our results clearly indicate that such spreading
occurs in our hospital and between CF patients. It has
been demonstrated that strong selective pressure on a bacteria and its phage during coevolution lead to the emergence of specific bacterial populations specialized in a
selective environment [27].
In conclusion, we demonstrated the emergence and
spreading of a new isolate of MRSA in CF patients in Marseille, France, that has probably been selected in the airways by antibiotic pressure. Our findings support the
hypothesis that the dominance of specific multidrugresistant S. aureus clones result from both the antimicrobial selective pressure and, as recently suggested, the
dynamic association of different factors involved during
the co-evolution of bacteria and host [44]. The increased
level of antibiotic resistance and the emergence of such
strains highlight the plasticity of S. aureus genomes and
the remarkable speed of bacterial evolution, especially by
horizontal gene transfer including bacteriophages, S.
aureus pathogenicity islands, SCCmec, plasmids and transposons, to allow the bacteria to very rapidly adapt to a
specific niche. The phages in S. aureus are a remarkable
source of untapped genetic diversity [45] with more than
60% of predicted protein-encoded ORFs that cannot be
annotated for structure or function [46]. Phylogenetic
analysis of phenotypically similar h-GISA in our study
also suggests that CF patients are colonized by polyclonal
populations of MRSA that represents an incredible reservoir for lateral gene transfer and emergence of uncontrollable super bugs, as recently exemplified in two CF
patients infected with MRSA carrying Panton-Valentine
leukocidin toxin [47]. Antibiotic-mediated phage induc-

tion may result in replication and high-frequency transfer
and the unintended consequence of promoting the spread
of virulence and/or antibiotic resistance determinants as
recently demonstrated with ciprofloxacin and betalactams and S. aureus [25,48] and ciprofloxacin and P. aeruginosa [49]. The speed with which resistance and virulence genes move between strains by lateral gene transfer
in S. aureus is clinically worrisome in patients chronically
colonized and receiving many antibiotics and represents a
model for emergence of uncontrollable super bugs in a
specific niche. We believe that particular effort should be
initiated to make CF patients MRSA-free as soon as MRSA
is detected to avoid the possibility of lateral gene transfer
by generalized transduction induced by the use of antibiotics. The epidemiology of MRSA in CF patients from
other centres and other countries should be examined and
compared to identify potential reservoirs of particular
strains as well as Vancomycin-Resistant S. aureus that
could emerge in this population.

République Française" the 6 August 2004 since no additional sample was taken for the study.

Methods

Phenotypic analysis of the epidemic clone
MRSA strain CF-Marseille, the prototype of GS-MRSA
recovered in CF patient, was isolated in January 2006
from the sputum of a 14-year old CF girl. MIC values of
antimicrobials were determined according to the Committee for Antimicrobial Testing of the French Society for
Microbiology using a Vitek2* system (bioMérieux, Marcy
l'Etoile, France) with Gram positive susceptibility test
cards. MIC against vancomycin was tested using Etest strip
(AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) performed at 0.5 and 2.0
McFarland inocula on BHIA as previously described [55].
Plates were incubated at 37°C and read after 48 h. CFMarseille was also tested for glycopeptide-intermediate
susceptibility by population analysis [37,55]. Finally, one
hundred microliters of a bacterial suspension adjusted to
McFarland standard 2.0 was spread on brain heart infusion agar (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France)
plates with 6 mg/l of vancomycin (Merck, Lyon, France)
as described previously [37,55]. Plates were incubated and
growth observed after 48 h. MRSA strain CF-Marseille and
vancomycin susceptible S. aureus (VSSA, strain CIP 7625)
were examined with a transmission electron microscope
Philips -Morgagni 368D (Fei Company, Eindhoven, The
Netherlands). The strains were grown on trypticase soya
agar at 37°C and were then stained with ruthenium red as
described by Luft [56] prior to processing for electron
microscopic examination. The cell wall thickness was
observed using a Mega View II camera and measured
using Analysis 3.2 and Soft Imaging System software. Statistical analysis was done using Epi Info version 6.0 software (CDC, Atlanta, Ga.); p values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Epidemiology of CF-Marseille
All CF patients followed in the two CF reference centres at
Marseille, France, were included in this study from May
2001 to December 2006 for the epidemiological analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using Epi Info 6.0
Software. S. aureus strains isolated from sputum samples
were collected from January 2006 to December 2006
using routine laboratory culture methods and standard
identification methods [50,51]. Criteria for selecting epidemic MRSA strains were susceptibility to gentamicin
combined to resistance to oxacillin, tobramycin, and kanamycin. Twenty one of these isolates as well as 9 MSSA
from CF patients and ten MRSA isolated in the same hospital during the same period in non-CF patients were further analyzed using genotypic markers and microarray
experiments by using previously described procedures
[52-54]. This study has been approved by our local ethic

Phage induction
CF-Marseille was grown for 2 hours in Trypticase soya
broth (TSB, BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) at 37°C.
Mitomycin C (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Saint-Quentin Fallavier,
France) was used in phage mobilization as described previously [31]. Briefly, 1 μg/ml of mitomycin C was added
to the TSB culture and after 3 hours of incubation with
shaking at 30°C, the cell lysate was passed through 0.22
μm filters. Plaque assay was performed to verify phage
induction using S. aureus strain CIP 76.25. The effects of
sub-inhibitory concentrations of other antibiotics on
phage induction of CF-Marseille were also analyzed. The
following antibiotics were used as described above: oxacillin (PANPHARMA, France) (8 μg/ml), ceftazidime
(GlaxoSmithKline, Marly-Le-Roi, France) (8 μg/ml), imipenem (Merck Sharp & Dohme-Chibret, Paris, France)

Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated the emergence and
spreading of a new isolate of MRSA in CF patients in Marseille, France, that has probably been selected in the airways by antibiotic pressure. Genome analysis of this
atypical MRSA using high throughput sequencing method
and phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of a new
antibiotic inducible phage and a hGISA phenotype. Antibiotic-mediated phage induction may result in high-frequency transfer and the unintended consequence of
promoting the spread of virulence and/or antibiotic resistance determinants. The emergence of well-adapted MRSA
is worrying in such population chronically colonized and
receiving many antibiotics and represents a model for
rapid evolution and emergence of uncontrollable super
bugs in a specific niche.

ml), metronidazole (Fresenius Kabi, Sèvres, France) (10
μg/ml), and colimycin (Sanofi Aventis, Paris, France)
(300 IU/ml). Presence of induced phages was examined
with a transmission electron microscope Philips -Morgagni 368D as described above.
Genome analysis of CF-Marseille
Sequencing and assembly of CF-Marseille
S. aureus strain CF-Marseille was grown on trypticase soya
agar, then harvested and suspended in TE buffer. DNA was
extracted according the classical lytic treatment using SDS
and proteinase K followed by phenol-chloroform isoamyl
alcohol extraction. DNA was solubilized in TE buffer and
visualized on agarose gel stained by ethidium bromide.
Genome sequencing was performed under previously
described conditions using the 454 technology (454 Life
Sciences, Branford, USA) [28]. Assembly was performed
using Newbler software of the 454 suite package. Mapping
was performed using Projector 2 tool with or without
masking repeats [57] and compared to contig alignment
using NUCmer of MUMmer 3.0 program [58]. The contigs which did not automatically map by Projector program but had significant matches with reference genomes
were mapped using NUCmer tool. The contigs which did
not map using both tools were subjected to further BLAST
analysis [59] against S. aureus genomes. The unmatched
contigs with available S. aureus genomes were also subjected to BLAST search (E-value = 10-4) against the nonredundant GenBank database to identify their homologs
with genomic sequences of other genomes.
Design of primers and probe to target the phage related sequences
Primers and Taqman* probe used to target the phage
related sequences were 00394F (5'-AAATGGCTTGGAGGAATTGAAC-3')
and
00394R
(5'-ACCAAATGCAACACAACGAATG-3') and 00394probe (6FAMTGGGAACCTAGTGGCAGATCCAGA-TAMRA) that yield
a 182 bp sequence.
Genotyping of representative isolates
Genomic DNA of the 40 isolates described above were
extracted from one colony as previously described [60].
All qPCR tests were performed with oligonucleotides
designed using PrimerExpress (PE Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). Typing of I to IV SCCmec cassette elements and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/1

of agr-group were performed using previously published
methods [60,61]. Presence of phage, PVL, TSST-1 and
exfoliatin toxins was assessed using specific oligonucleotides. Conditions and settings used for these analyses
were previously described [60,61]. Multi Locus sequence
Typing (MLST) was performed using previously described
procedures and primers [52]. Allele numbers were
assigned according to the program available from the
MLST Web site http://www.mlst.net. Multiple-locus VNTR
assay (MLVA) typing assay was performed as previously
described [53,54] using 9 pairs of primers targeting VNTR
containing genes and one additional pair or primers targeting the mecA gene. Main clusters of strains were identified using previously described analytical settings [53].
Representative isolates in these main clusters of strains
were selected for microarray experiments.
Microarray design
The microarray was manufactured by in situ synthesis of
10'807 long oligonucleotide probes (Agilent, Palo Alto,
CA, USA), selected as previously described [62]. It covers
>98% of all ORFs annotated in strains N315 and Mu50
[12], MW2 [11] and COL [15], NCTC8325, USA300 [14],
MRSA252 an MSSA476 [13] including their respective
plasmids. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was prepared from isolated colonies grown overnight on Mueller Hinton (MH)
agar at 37°C. Briefly: 109 cells were lyzed in 100 μLTris
EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA, pH = 8) containing 50 μg/ml lysostaphin (Ambicin from Applied Microbiology, Tarrytown, NY) for 10 min at 37°C. DNA was
then isolated and purified using DNeasy® kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions, including RNAse treatment. DNA quantification
and protein contaminations were assessed by using a
NanoDrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies, Inc. Rockland, DE).
Microarray complete genome hybridization (CGH) and scanning
Test and reference gDNAs (1 μg) were labelled with cyanine 3 or cyanine 5 dCTP (NEN, Perkin Elmer, Foster City,
USA) using the BioPrime DNA Labelling kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) following manufacturer's instructions.
Unincorporated fluorescent nucleotides were removed
using Centrisep columns (Princeton separations, EMP
Biotech, Berlin, Germany). Cy 3 labelled gDNAs from the
four reference strains used to design the microarray (0.125
μg from each strain) were mixed with 0.5 μg of Cy 5
labelled test gDNA in hybridization buffer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), to a total volume of 250 μl. Hybridization mixture was heated to 95°C for 2 minutes and then
hybridization was performed for 17 hours at 60°C with
rotation in a dedicated hybridization oven (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Stringent washings were
then performed according to manufacturer's instructions.
Slides were dried under nitrogen flow, and scanned (Agi-

lent Technologies, CA, USA) using 100% Photon Multiplier Tube (PMT) power for both wavelengths using a
Agilent scanner.
Expression microarrays
Preparation of labelled nucleic acids S. aureus strains were
grown in Muller-Hinton broth for 4 hours. Total RNA was
extracted from 2 mL of cells at 2–3 × 109 cells/ml, using
the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland), as previously
described (15;16). After additional DNase treatment, the
absence of remaining DNA traces was evaluated by quantitative PCR (SDS 7700; Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) with assays specific for 16s rRNA [63,64].
Batches of 10 μg total S. aureus RNA were labelled by Cy3dCTP using the SuperScript II (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) following manufacturer's instructions. Labelled
products were then purified onto QiaQuick columns
(Qiagen). Purified genomic DNA from the 8 sequenced
strains was extracted (DNeasy, Qiagen), labeled with Cy5 dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I
(BioPrime, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) [54]. Cy5-labeled
DNA (0.125 μg per stain) and Cy3-labeled cDNA (10 μg)
mixture was diluted in 250 μl Agilent hybridization
buffer, and hybridized at a temperature of 60°C for 17
hours in a dedicated hybridization oven (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Slides were washed, dried
under nitrogen flow, and scanned (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA,
USA) using 100% PMT power for both wavelengths. Data
were extracted and processed using Feature Extraction™
software (version 8, Agilent).
Microarray analysis
Fluorescence intensities were extracted using the Feature
extraction software (Agilent, version 8). Local background
subtracted signals were corrected for unequal dye incorporation or unequal load of the labelled product. For CGH
analysis experiments, the algorithm consisted of a rank
consistency filter and a curve fit using the default LOWESS
(locally weighted linear regression) method. Additional
software was developed in house to analyze the processed
data. This software filtered the data to exclude irrelevant
values, as flagged by the extraction software. Background
noise of each experiment was evaluated by computing the
standard deviation of negative control intensities. Features whose intensities were smaller than the standard
deviation value of the negative controls were considered
as inefficient hybridization and discarded from further
analysis. The software calculated for each spot the logarithm of the ratio between the test channel and the control
channel (log ratio). Since the control signal is present in
each spot, this log ratio corresponds to a per feature normalization. Computed log ratio values were further sorted
into 150 bin categories and fitted with a Gaussian distribution curve, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
The software estimated the presence probability of each

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/1

oligonucleotide probe (EPP), as previously described
[10,54]. As clearly documented in the work of Kim et al.,
we used the most stringent EPP value as our study was
focused on "strict divergent gene analysis parameter" [65].
Values showing an EPP <1% (each oligonucleotide probe)
were extracted and considered as absent features in the
test channel. The list of absent features from each experiment was then clustered by the software using Dice distance and Group average linkage algorithm to construct a
hierarchical cluster tree [66].
For expression analysis, local background-subtracted signals were corrected for unequal dye incorporation or unequal load of labelled product. The algorithm consisted of
a rank consistency filter and a curve fit using the default
LOWESS (locally weighted linear regression) method.
Data consisting of three independent biological experiments were expressed as Log10 ratios and analyzed using
GeneSpring7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA,
USA). Statistical significance of differentially expressed
genes was identified by variance analysis (ANOVA)
[63,67], performed using GeneSpring, including the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction (5%).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis were done using Epi Info Software version 6.0 http://www.cdc.org for Chi-square – MantelHaenszel two-tailed test and risk ratio.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Eric Bapteste, Dalhousie University, Canada

Rolain et al. submitted a solid and well-written scientific
work. They certainly discovered that an atypical MRSA
strain thriving in Marseille harbours an antibiotic inducible bacteriophage. Although this is definitely worth to be
published, I am not sure however that this paper belongs
to Biology Direct. The analyses presented here seem more
interesting from a medical point of view than from an
evolutionary perspective, or than from a perspective of
comparative genomics. It is thus unclear to me why these
authors did not submit their manuscript to the Lancet or
another such review. In Biology Direct readers would
likely expect deeper (comparative) genomic analyses of
this newly sequenced strain of Staphylococcus aureus. For
instance, in their conclusion, the authors comment about
lateral gene transfer, the genomic plasticity and the conservation of core genes in their strain, but they do not
present any phylogenomic analyses to back up their
claims. As a result, their discussion seems a bit vague,
while a deeper analysis could prove of further interest to
biologists as well as to the medical community. In terms
of genomics, lots of interesting discoveries remain to be
done with their data.
Finally, the MLVA tree – and the methods behind itshould be better explained; a list of the abbreviations used
should be introduced in the beginning of the paper to
help the reader.
Author's response
We appreciate the comments of reviewer's 1 and we believe that
our analyses are both interesting from a medical point of view
and from an evolutionary perspective, accessible to both scien-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/1

tists and clinicians. In fact this paper has been reviewed before
Biology Direct in other journals (Genome Research, Nature
Medicine and PLOS Medicine). Although comments were
mainly favourable, specific concerns were either that it was a
dubious assumption to speculate that it would not be necessary
to close the genome or that the advance provided by these results
were specific to this particular strain. To the best of our knowledge this genome sequence of a MRSA isolated in CF patients
is the first to be reported worldwide. From an evolutionary point
of view our results demonstrate the negative impact and rapid
evolution of bacterial community in a specific niche exposed to
many antibiotics for the selection of well-adapted multidrug
resistant bacterial clones that could spread in the population. As
suggested by reviewer we have added phylogenomic analyses as
well as more comments and details about MLVA methods and
results to go thoroughly into lateral gene transfer and genome
plasticity in bacterial evolution in the discussion section. A list
of abbreviations has been added.
Reviewer's report 2
Pierre Pontarotti, Université d'Aix-Marseille, France

Rolain et al. report the complete sequence of a representative isolate of a Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus
aureus from a cystic fibrosis patient (name strain CF-Marseille) and have conducted a comparative genome analysis with the published sequences. This comparative
analysis shows that the CF Marseille strain displays a similar core genome with other sequenced MRSA, with some
apomorphism due to mobile elements and a new phage
closely related to Phi ETA3. The bioinformatics and
microbiologic analysis are robust and the paper is highly
informative. I would, however, advise the author to write
a short introduction on the origin of multi- antibiotic
resistance and artificial selection (see for example
Palumbi: Humans as the World's Greatest Evolutionary
Force Science 7 September 2001: Vol. 293. no. 5536, pp.
1786 – 1790 science.293.5536.1786). This will be helpful
for the BD readers that are not specialists in the domain.
An explanation of the role of virus (that do not encode for
resistance antibiotic genes) in the emergence of antibiotic
resistance is also necessary, as this role is not well
explained for a non specialist.
Author's response
We thank reviewer's 2 for the comments of our article. As suggested we have added a short introduction on the origin of
multidrug resistance and artificial selection as well as an explanation of the role of virus in the emergence of antibiotic resistance (see introduction and discussion sections, respectively).
Indeed, the main problem in CF patients is that they are chronically colonized and treated with many antibiotics for years that
facilitate the emergence of such 'super-adapted' bacteria that
could spread in the population.

Reviewer's report 3
Igor Zhulin, University of Tennessee, USA

encourage clinicians to read this paper in Biology Direct from a
medical point of view.

The paper by J.-M. Rolain et al. describes a genomic analysis of a multidrug-resistant strain of S. aureus. I am curious why the authors decided to send their study to
Biology Direct: this work would be more appropriate for
a journal dedicated to infectious diseases (e.g. Journal of
Clinical Microbiology). I am not sure that clinicians who
need to know about this would necessarily read Biology
Direct. Nonetheless, this paper presents a very interesting
case: a strain, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics, has
emerged from cystic fibrosis patients and the mechanism
for this emergence is phage induction by administered
antibiotics. The phage activity is likely responsible for promoting the spread

This is a straightforward study from the genome analysis
point of you. It does show the power of array-based pyrosequencing in obtaining critical biological data in a very
short time. Clearly, in this particular case, there was no
need to spend extra time and money to chase the remaining 4% of DNA and close the genome. It became obvious
upon analysis of the genomic data that sequences unique
to this strain (in comparison with a number of available
genomes of various S. aureus isolates) comprise a novel
phage and a modified mobile genetic element. The rest of
the study links this genomic data to the biology of the
pathogen.

Despite having a degree in microbiology, I am not quite
qualified to comment on the epidemiological aspects of
this work. However, I read the paper with a great interest
and did not notice any obvious flaws in experimental
design and interpretation.
Overall, this finding appears to be important from the
medical perspective and will contribute to better understanding of infectious diseases.
Author's response
We appreciate and we agree with the comments of reviewer's 3.
In fact, as explained in reviewer's 1 responses, this paper has
been reviewed before Biology Direct in other journals (Genome
Research, Nature Medicine and PLOS Medicine). One major
concern by reviewers was the fact that in our study the genome
was not closed. However our results clearly prove that closing
the genome was not necessary to decipher the genome content
of the strain very rapidly since other available genomes could be
used for comparisons and mapping. Moreover, the 454 technology and microarray assay proved to be complementary for analysis of this new strain. We believe that the importance of
understanding specific mechanisms of drug resistance and
emergence of such bacteria in the setting of Cystic Fibrosis will
