Abstract
Background: Anisakiasis is an important fish-borne zoonosis provoked by larval stages of nematodes belonging to
the genus Anisakis. The detection and identification of human infections is difficult. This is due to: a) the low
specificity of the clinical features and symptomatology related to human infections; b) the paucity of diagnostic
features of larvae found in granulomatous lesions characteristic of “invasive anisakiasis"; and c) the lack
morphological characters diagnostic at the specific level when larvae of Anisakis are detected. Thus, molecularbased diagnostic approaches are warranted.
Method: We have developed a PCR method that amplifies the DNA of Anisakis spp. in fixed paraffin-embedded
tissues. This method was applied to a granuloma removed from a human case of intestinal anisakiasis in Italy.
Specific primers of the mtDNA cox2 gene were used and sequence analysis was performed according to the
procedures already established for species of Anisakis.
Results: The sequence obtained (629 bp) was compared with those of the other species of Anisakis which have so
far been genetically characterized and with sequences obtained from larval stages of Anisakis collected from the
Mediterranean fish Engraulis encrasicolus. This enabled the genetic identification of the larva in the human tissue as
A. pegreffii. This is the first instance of human intestinal anisakiasis diagnosed using PCR of DNA purified from a
fixed eosinophilic granuloma embedded in paraffin.
Conclusion: The case of human anisakiasis presented reinforces the pathological significance of the species A.
pegreffii to humans. The molecular/genetic methodological approach based on mtDNA cox2 sequence analysis,
described here, can allow easy and rapid identification of Anisakis spp. in formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded
tissues removed from cases of either gastric or intestinal human anisakiasis.

Background
Anisakiasis is a fish-borne zoonosis provoked by the larval ascaridoid nematodes of the genus Anisakis Dujardin, 1845. These nematodes have a complex life-cycle
involving organisms at various levels of a trophic web in
the marine ecosystem. Small crustaceans, mainly euphasiaceans, are the first intermediate hosts, whereas fish

and squid are intermediate/paratenic hosts, and they
reach the adult stage in the stomachs of marine mammals (mainly cetaceans) [1]. In fish, larvae are commonly localized on the surfaces of the visceral organs,
body cavity, serous membranes and, occasionally, also in
the muscle. Humans can accidentally be infected by the
larvae when consuming raw, undercooked or improperly
processed (e.g. marinated) parasitized fish and squid. In
humans, these parasites do not mature, but they provoke the zoonosis termed anisakiasis. In such infections,
these parasites can migrate from the gastrointestinal

tract, become embedded in the gastrointestinal mucosa
and submucosa, and initially cause discomfort and pain
(gastric pain, vomiting) and, subsequently, an eosinophilic granuloma [2]. Based on the location of the granulomatous lesions, various types of human anisakiasis have
been identified, most being either gastric or intestinal.
In these situations, larvae penetrate the tissues of the
alimentary tract and cause severe pathology, even at the
extra-gastrointestinal level [2,3]. Oropharyngeal cases of
human anisakiasis have been also reported [2]. From the
histopathological point of view, anisakiasis may be classified into four stages: i) phlegmon formation; ii) abscess
formation; iii) abscess-granuloma formation; and iv)
granuloma formation [2]. In the recent years, it has
been suggested the occurrence of allergy symptoms
associated with Anisakis infections. Indeed, hypersensitivity cases have been particularly noted so far in Spain,
and the occurrence of a gastro-allergic anisakiasis has
been documented [4-6].
This zoonosis, after first being reported in the Netherlands [7], has been noted particularly in Japan, but also
in European countries where its occurrence has been
related to an increase in the popularity of raw and/or
undercooked fish. In Italy, in recent years, several cases
have been reported [8-17]; most of these were based on
histopathological findings, but in three cases only molecular diagnoses have been made on larval nematode
extracted by gastroduodenoscopy [10,16,17].
For any parasitological survey and epidemiological study
to be carried out on these worms, the exact identification
(to the specific level) of the species occurring in a geographical area represents the first parameter to be considered.
Genetic-molecular methods are particularly useful in this
regard, since larval stages of Anisakis are not recognizable
by morphological characters. The systematics of the species of Anisakis has been clarified in recent decades by the
application of such molecular methodologies [1,18-34].
The actual taxonomy of the species so far recognised in
this genus has been reviewed recently [1,24].
Among the nine species of Anisakis so far characterized genetically, the two sibling species, A. simplex (s.s.)
and A. pegreffii have been identified as agents of human
anisakiasis [10,16,17,30].
Molecular methods have so far been applied only to
nematode larvae obtained by endoscopy. Furthermore,
only morphology has been used to try and recognize larval nematodes in histological sections of surgically
removed granulomas formed in gastric and/or intestinal
tissues. Such identification has not always been possible
due to the poor conservation of worms present in histological sections. Even when attempted, identification has
been possible only to the generic level. Therefore, this
paper aims to: i) provide a method based on PCR-DNA
and the sequencing of the mtDNA cox2 gene for the

Page 2 of 6

identification of larval stages of Anisakis from paraffinembedded tissues after the surgical removal of the granuloma formed by the larva; and ii) identify for the first
time, to the species level, an Anisakis larva recovered
from a case of human intestinal anisakiasis.

Case presentation
A man was admitted to the Emergency Department of
the “Belcolle Hospital” in Viterbo, Italy, complaining of
acute abdominal pain in the lower right quadrant, nausea
and emesis lasting several hours. He was admitted with
suspected appendicitis, and physical, laboratory and radiological findings also suggested acute appendicitis. During the surgical inspection, a lesion of the caecum was
detected. The caecum was dilated and exhibited an edematous and inflamed mucosa. Therefore, a right colectomy was performed. The surgical specimen consisted of
a tract of the small bowel; the ileo-caecal valve was stenotic and the mucosa appeared to be extensively edematous
with severe thickening of the wall of the caecum. Human
tissue sample from the organ showing the gross lesion
was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in
paraffin, sectioned at 6 μm and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Sections revealed in the submucosa, a granuloma surrounding the larva of a nematode. Some of the
obtained sections were analyzed using light microscopy
and with the aid of a drawing tube.
DNA extraction from tissue paraffin-embedded

One of the histological sections obtained from the paraffin-embedded tissue was used for the DNA extraction.
This was carried out applying a DNA extraction technique from paraffin-embedded tissue [35], with the following modified procedures. The removal of paraffin was
carried out by adding 1 ml of xylene for 30 min to the
microtube containing the tissue section, followed by two
washing steps (30 min each) using 100% and 75% ethanol. The tissue mixture was then washed with PBS for
15 min, which was repeated three times. The lysis buffer
(Proteinase K 2 mg/ml, 50 μl, 1 M Tris-HCl solution, 10
μl; 0.5 M EDTA, 2 μl; 10% SDS, 100 μl; distilled water,
838 μl) was added and the mixture incubated at 52°C
overnight. 500 μl of phenol, chloroform and isopropanol
alcohol, in the proportion 25:24:1, respectively, were
then added to the de-waxed tissue. The sample was
mixed by vortex and centrifuged for 10 min at 13.000
rpm, and 1 ml of chloroform was added to the supernatant, transferred to an autoclaved microtube and centrifuged for 5 min at 13.000 rpm. Subsequently, 0.1 ml of
3 M sodium acetate was added, followed by 1 volume of
isopropanol, and the mixture incubated at -20°C overnight. The precipitated DNA was then centrifuged at
12.000 rpm and then washed with 75% ethanol. The
white pellet was dried at room temperature overnight

Mattiucci et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:82
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/82

for 10-15 min. The DNA pellet was suspended in 50 μl
of TE buffer (pH = 8) and then stored at -20°C.
PCR condition and DNA sequencing

Identification to the species level was carried out using a
629 bp fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase 2 (cox2) gene. The cox2 gene from Anisakis spp.
was amplified using the primers 211F 5’-TTT TCT
AGT TAT ATA GAT TGR TTY AT-3’ and 210R
5’- CAC CAA CTC TTA AAA TTA TC-3’ from Nadler
& Hudspeth [36] spanning the mtDNA nucleotide position 10,639-11,248, as defined in Ascaris suum [GenBank X54253]. PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
amplification was carried out in a volume of 50 ml containing 30 pmol of each primer, MgCl2 2.5 mM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Inc., Piscataway, NJ), PCR
buffer 1 X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Inc., Piscataway, NJ), DMSO 0.08 mM, dNTPs 0.4 mM (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO), 5 U of Taq Polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Inc., Piscataway, NJ) and 10
ng of total DNA. The mixture was denatured at 94°C
for 3 min, followed by 34 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 46°C
for 1 min and 72°C for 1.5 min, followed by post-amplification at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR product was purified using PEG precipitation, and automated DNA
sequencing was performed by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul,
Korea) using primers 210R and 211F. The sequences
obtained were compared with those already obtained for
all of the Anisakis spp. reported above and previously
deposited by us in GenBank with their accession numbers. They are the following: A. simplex (s.s.)
[DQ116426], A. pegreffii [DQ116428], A. simplex C
[DQ116429], A. typica [DQ116427], A. ziphidarum
[DQ116430], A. physeteris [DQ116432], A. brevispiculata [DQ116433], A. paggiae [DQ116434] and A. nascettii [DQ116431], as reported in our previous papers [24].
The cox2 sequences were aligned using Clustal X [37].
Phylogenetic analysis was performed by MEGA 4.0 [38],
using Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Neighbour-Joining (NJ) based on p-distance values. The reliabilities of
the phylogenetic relationships were evaluated using nonparametric bootstrap analysis [39] for the MP and NJ
trees. Bootstrap values ≥70 were considered well supported [40]. Additionally, the DNA obtained from the
human tissue extraction was also compared with other
A. pegreffii specimens collected from a fish, the anchovy
Engraulis encrasicolus from the Mediterranean Sea
[24,41]. A sequence at the mtDNA cox2 of Pseudoterranova decipiens (s.s.) from Phoca vitulina was included as
the outgroup to root the Anisakis phylogenetic tree.

Results
The histological examination revealed a transmural
inflammation with marked infiltration of eosinophils,

Page 3 of 6

histiocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells across all
layers of the bowel wall and in the peri-intestinal fat tissue. In the submucosa, where the infiltration of eosinophils was most evident, a parasitic nematode in a good
state of preservation was found. The nematode had a
diameter of 0.50 × 0.30 mm, with a thin (~10 μm) cuticle lacking lateral alae. Polymyarian muscle cells, separated into four quadrants by the chords were visible,
with two wing-like distal lobes (Figure 1). The intestine
was circular, with a triangular lumen and 60-70 tall
columnar epithelial cells disposed radially. Excretory
cells (renette cells) were banana-shaped and situated
ventrally to the intestine. There was no ventricular
appendix and/or intestinal caecum present (Figure 1).
The nematode was identified as a larva belonging to the
genus Anisakis.
The fragment of Anisakis larva obtained from a tissue
sample, fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, was
perfectly sequenced at the mtDNA cox2 gene: a
sequence of 629 pb was obtained. The specimen of Anisakis sp. collected from the human intestinal granuloma
matched perfectly the previously studied sequences of
A. pegreffii [28,24,41]; it was deposited in GenBank
under the accession number DQ116428 (Figure 2).
Furthermore, the A. pegreffii specimen of human origin
clustered in the same well-defined and well-supported
clade in both the Maximum Parsimony (MP) and
Neighbour-Joining (NJ) analyses (Figure 3) with those
specimens of the species A. pegreffii which had previously been sequenced [24,28,41] and deposited in GenBank. In addition, the larval A. pegreffii from the human
case clustered, using MP and NJ analyses (Figure 3), in
the same well-supported clade with the A. pegreffii

larvae collected from anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus)
in the Mediterranean Sea. A very low value of genetic
differentiation at the mtDNA cox2 level (p distance =
0.001) was found between the sample of A. pegreffii
from the human infection and those samples of A
pegreffii so far sequenced from the Mediterranean Sea.
Nevertheless, this result has allowed the identification of
A. pegreffii as a zoonotic agent of a human intestinal
case of anisakiasis within an eosinophilic granuloma.

Discussion
The paucity of documented cases of anisakiasis in Italy
contrasts markedly with the presence of these parasites
in fish species [1] which are increasingly consumed in
Italy as raw or marinated sea-food. Clearly, this mismatch suggests that human infections with Anisakis in
Italy could be significantly underestimated.
After human ingestion, larvae could be either expelled
in vomit or stools, or they could penetrate the wall of
the gastrointestinal tract. As a consequence of the latter,
a local granulomatous reaction surrounds the invading
larva [2,3]. Such chronic intestinal anisakiasis can
develop into abdominal peritonitis or intestinal occlusion and, hence, become a surgical problem - as in this
report. Subsequent histological examination in the present case revealed the presence of an Anisakis larva.
In previous cases of gastric [8], intestinal [14,15],
extra-intestinal [9] and gastrointestinal [11,12] human
anisakiasis in Italy, the histopathological findings disclosed an Anisakis larva, but no identification to species

with a heuristic search. There were 213 polymorphic sites and 178
parsimony-informative sites. Sequences of A. pegreffii from Engraulis
encrasicolus are reported with the codes: AE71, AE65, AE72, AE70.
Sequences of A. pegreffii from our previous studies are reported

level was possible. So far in Italy, only three human
cases have been identified by molecular methods; in
these cases, this was enabled by the removal of Anisakis
larvae from the stomach by endoscopy followed by
PCR-RFLP analyses of the ITS of rDNA or sequences
analysis of the mtDNA cox2 gene [10,16,17]. Significantly, in these cases fresh fragments of larvae were
available for analysis.
In contrast we report, for the first time, the identification of an Anisakis larva sequenced from histological tissue previously fixed in formalin and subsequently
embedded in paraffin. This represents a further report
of A. pegreffii as a zoonotic agent of human anisakiasis
in Italy, and the first case of its identification to the species level in an intestinal anisakiasis in Italy. One previous human case referring to A. pegreffii was reported
in Japan [30], among several cases in the same geographical region where A. simplex (s.s.) was determined to
be responsible [30]. The identification of A. pegreffii as a
causative agent of this case of intestinal anisakiasis in
Italy is in accordance with the widespread occurrence of

Mattiucci et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:82

the parasite species, at a larval stage, in various fish and
squid species in Italian seas [1].
The medical history of the patient in the present case
indicated the consumption of raw, marinated anchovies
approximatively two months before the onset of abdominal pain. This fish species is frequently infected with
A. pegreffii in the Mediterranean Sea, with an average prevalence of infection in the Tyrrhenian Sea P 1.00% and an
average mean intensity, Im 1.00 (our unpublished data). In
this fish species, the relative proportion of Anisakis larvae
occurring in the flesh, i.e. in its edible parts, was 0.01% of
the total number of larvae recovered in the infected fish
[our unpublished data]. Since in this human case and in
other reports, the medical histories of the patients indicated prior consumption of marinated anchovies, we infer
that this sea-food preparation could be an important
source of infection of anisakiasis in Italy.

Conclusion
The molecular/genetic methodological approach
described here easily and rapidly identifies Anisakis spp.
in formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissues
removed from cases of either gastric or intestinal
human anisakiasis. This will facilitate a better estimation
of the epidemiological role of the zoonotic species
A. pegreffii in the Italian population and will also allow
analysis of previously removed granulomas currently
residing in histology archives.
The case of human anisakiasis presented reinforces
the pathological significance of the species A. pegreffii to
humans. Furthermore, the molecular characterization,
based on the mtDNA cox2 gene, will enable investigations into the possible occurrence of different haplotypes of those species of Anisakis associated with the
differential pathological aspects of this fish-borne zoonosis (anisakiasis) in humans. In this respect, the high
genetic polymorphism (haplotypes) so far observed in
the mitochondrial DNA cox2 gene in Anisakis spp. [24]
reveals that its sequence analysis offers not only valuable
and efficient molecular tools for the recognition of sibling species of zoonotic Anisakis larvae as independent
genetic lineages [24,28], but also provides, for future
analyses, additional genetic characters useful for molecular epidemiological and pathological approaches to the
study of human anisakiasis [6].
