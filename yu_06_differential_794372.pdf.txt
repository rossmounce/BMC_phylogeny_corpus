Abstract
Background: WNT4 is a key regulator of gonadal differentiation in humans and mice, playing a
pivotal role in early embryogenesis. Using a marsupial, the tammar wallaby, in which most gonadal
differentiation occurs after birth whilst the young is in the pouch, we show by quantitative PCR
during early testicular and ovarian development that WNT4 is differentially expressed ingonads.
Results: Before birth, WNT4 mRNA expression was similar in indifferent gonads of both sexes.
After birth, in females WNT4 mRNA dramatically increased during ovarian differentiation, reaching
a peak by day 9–13 post partum (pp) when the ovarian cortex and medulla are first distinguishable.
WNT4 protein was localised in the ovarian cortex and at the medullary boundary. WNT4 mRNA
then steadily decreased to day 49, by which time all the female germ cells have entered meiotic
arrest. In males, WNT4 mRNA was down-regulated in testes immediately after birth, coincident
with the time that seminiferous cords normally form, and rose gradually after day 8. By day 49,
when testicular androgen production normally declines, WNT4 protein was restricted to the
Leydig cells.
Conclusion: This is the first localisation of WNT4 protein in developing gonads and is consistent
with a role for WNT4 in steroidogenesis. Our data provide strong support for the suggestion that
WNT4 not only functions as an anti-testis gene during early development, but is also necessary for
later ovarian and testicular function.

Background
Sexual development provides an ideal model to study organogenesis since the gonads have the bipotential ability to
form an ovary or a testis. Wingless-type MMTV integration
site family, member 4 (WNT4) is a member of WNT gene
family, and encodes a cysteine-rich secreted protein.
WNT4 plays a pivotal role in early embryogenesis, particularly in the formation of the urogenital system [1-4].
After the action of Sry in the XY gonad Wnt4 expression
decreases to undetectable levels in the developing testis,

but remains at high levels in the ovary [4]. This led to the
initial hypothesis that WNT4 acts as an anti-testis gene,
blocking Leydig cell differentiation and steroidogenesis in
the developing ovary [4]. Lack of Wnt4 results in masculinization of XX mouse embryos [4] and inhibits the migration of endothelial and steroidogenic cells into the
developing ovary [5], while over-expression of Wnt4 in
the developing testis interferes with testicular vascular
development and decreases androgen production [5,6].
Sertoli cell differentiation was also compromised in Wnt4

mutant testes, demonstrating that Wnt4 has specific and
distinct roles in both male and female gonadal development [7].

also to determine its expression during the extended
period of testicular differentiation.

Results
Wnt4 appears to regulate Dax1 [8,9], a gene believed to
antagonize the function of SRY in the developing gonad.
In vitro, Dax1 transcription can be activated by β-catenin,
a key signal-transducing protein in the WNT pathway [9].
Besides Dax1, Follistatin (Fst), encoding a TGF-β superfamily binding protein, may also be a downstream component of Wnt4 signalling that regulates vascular
boundaries and maintains germ cell survival in the ovary
[10]. Furthermore, Wnt4 and fibroblast growth factor 9
(FGF9) act as antagonistic signals to regulate differentiation of the ovary and testis [11]. To date most of our
knowledge about the role of Wnt4 in the mammalian
gonad has been based on studies only in the mice. In
order to determine the role of WNT4 in formation of the
mammalian gonad we characterised its expression in a
distantly related mammal.
Marsupials give birth after a relatively short gestation to
small altricial young that complete their development
during a long lactation period attached to a teat, usually
in a pouch. The tammar gonadal ridge develops about 6
days before birth, but the gonads remain undifferentiated
until after birth [12-14]. Testicular differentiation begins
with the formation of seminiferous cords by day 2 post
partum. The ovaries, as in all mammals, differentiate after
the testis at about day 8 post partum, almost 14 days after
the initial development of the gonadal ridge. In contrast
to the tammar, the development of the mouse gonad is
extremely rapid and there is only 1 day between the formation of the gonadal ridge and the onset of cord formation in males.
Marsupials have the classical mammalian XY sex determining mechanism [15] with a homologue of SRY on the
Y chromosome [16]. However, the formation of some secondary sexual characteristics, including the scrotum and
mammary glands, are under primary genetic control by
genes on the X chromosome, and are not dependant on
hormones from the testis [14,17,18]. Several key genes in
the sex determination and differentiation cascade, SRY
[19], SOX3 [20], SOX9 [21], SF-1 [22], DAX1 [23],
DMRT1 [24,25], ATRX/Y [26,27], AMH/MIS [28], have
now been cloned and characterized. The endocrine control of male sexual differentiation in the tammar has also
been defined [29-35]. Taken together, these data form a
primary framework for understanding the evolution of
the male sex-determining cascade in marsupials. However, nothing is yet known of the female gonadogenesis
pathway in marsupials. This study has therefore characterized WNT4 during early development to gain insight into
the onset of ovarian differentiation in a marsupial, and

Cloning and characterization of the tammar WNT4 Gene
Sequence analysis confirmed that PCR products were
derived from the WNT4 gene (data not shown). The longest sequence encodes a predicted protein of 351 amino
acids.

WNT4 proteins are cysteine rich and highly conserved in
all species. The N-terminus contains the transmembrane
domains of about 45 amino acids, and other WNT gene
family domains, all of which are highly conserved across
species (Fig 1). The tammar wallaby WNT4 protein shares
93.2% amino acid similarity with human, 92.6% with
mouse, 92.0% with rat, 88.9% with chicken, 87.7% with
frog, 86.4% with zebrafish, 65.8% with Amphioxus (Fig.
2a). Using the PHYLIP 3.63 program to construct a phylogenetic tree analysis of WNT4 proteins, tammar wallaby
WNT4 clusters with eutherian mammals (human, mouse
and rat) whereas chicken and frog form another group,
zebrafish and Amphioxus produce different branches, C.
elegans and fruit fly create another group distantly related
to vertebrates (Fig. 2b).
Southern blotting analysis of tammar genomic DNA
resulted in identical single bands of WNT4 in both male
and female, indicating there is only a single copy of the
WNT4 gene in tammar wallaby genome (Fig. 3b). The
tammar WNT4 gene has 5 exons consistent with that of
human, mouse and rat (Fig. 3a). Exon 2, 3 and 4, containing the functional domains, are highly conserved between
eutherian mammals and the tammar.
WNT4 mRNA distribution
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to analyze
WNT4 gene expression patterns in various adult tissues.
WNT4 expression was high in the testis, ovary and kidney.
Expression was weaker in the muscle and liver, but very
low in the spleen and lung and absent in the brain, heart
and prostate (Fig. 4).
Real-time quantitative PCR
Using real-time quantitative PCR, the fetal gonads of both
males and females had equally strong WNT4 expression
levels (P > 0.3) (Fig. 5a). After sexual differentiation,
expression patterns differed between ovary and testis (P <
0.0001). In the presumptive ovary, WNT4 expression at
day 1–3 and 4–8 post partum was half that in fetuses (P <
0.005). WNT4 expression then significantly increased (P <
0.001) to reach a peak at days 9–13 pp. At days 14–24
WNT4 remained much higher than in the male, but had
decreased by day 41–49 (P < 0.001) to the same level as
in the male. In contrast, WNT4 was dramatically down-

regulated to about 25% of the fetal level in the testis
between birth and day 8 pp (P < 0.005). After day 9 pp,
the relative expression of testicular WNT4 doubled but
remained at a much lower level than that of the ovary (P
< 0.02 at all stages) until day 41–49 when gonads of both
sexes had the indistinguishable levels of WNT4 expression
(P > 0.15) (Fig. 5a).
Protein localization in tammar gonads
The human anti-WNT4 antibody (Abcam) had an identical epitope sequence to the tammar WNT4 protein. Western blot analysis detected a single protein of 39KD in each
of the testis and ovary extracts, while the two negative controls (heart and BSA) gave no cross-reaction, confirming

the specificity of the antibody (Fig 6). Before gonadal differentiation, WNT4 protein was widespread and localised
in the somatic cells and surface epithelium of the gonads
and mesonephroi of both sexes (Fig 7a, g). In the ovary,
after birth WNT4 immunostaining remained strong in the
somatic cells (Fig 7b). The WNT4 antibody clearly defined
the cords of the rete ovarii and medulla after day 8 (Fig.
7c). Mullerian ducts were positively stained (data not
shown). By day 45 post partum, WNT4 staining was
strong in the cortical cells of the developing ovary (data
not shown). In the testis, shortly after birth when testis
differentiation was seen, immunostaining of WNT4 protein decreased (Fig 7h). WNT4 protein stained weakly
during testicular differentiation between day 0 and 3, but

once initial cord formation was complete, WNT4 expression became stronger in some interstitial cells (Fig 7i).
Strong staining was also seen in the tunica albuginea of
the developing testis at all stages (Fig 7g, h, and 7i). By
about day 45 post partum when germ cells begin to enter
mitotic arrest, immunoreactivity in the testis was strong in
the interstitium and clearly stained the cytoplasm of most
of the putative Leydig cells (Fig 8). However, WNT4 staining was not observed in the Wolffian ducts (Fig 8 inset).
In the adult, WNT4 staining was weak in both ovary and
testis (data not shown).

Discussion
We report the first molecular characterization and expression pattern of WNT4 in a non-eutherian mammal, the

tammar wallaby. This is also the first localization of
WNT4 protein in the gonad of any mammal. The greatly
extended developmental time of marsupial gonads enabled us to complete the first detailed analysis of the
changes in WNT4 expression throughout the whole of this
critical developmental period. Since the mouse testis
undergoes rapid development, the period of WNT4 downregulation that we have observed in the tammar testis
occurs very rapidly in the mouse and so may have been
missed. In the female, WNT4 is upregulated during the
time of ovarian differentiation, but is down-regulated by
the time the XX germ cells have all entered meiosis. In the
male, it is down-regulated by the day of birth when testicular differentiation is occurring, but gradually increases by
the time XY germ cells have all entered mitotic arrest. The

conserved but differing expression patterns of WNT4 in
the wallaby ovary and testis supports the idea that it has a
critical role in gonadal development in both sexes.
The structure and role of WNT gene family is highly conserved in vertebrates [36,37], and even in the sea anemone, a species representing the basal group within
cnidarians [38]. However, the full-length WNT4 gene
sequence has only been previously characterized in three
mammals, and four non-mammalian vertebrates (Fig. 1).
The tammar WNT4 gene consists of five exons, exons 2 –
4, the most highly conserved. The tammar WNT4 gene is
present as a single copy in the genome of both males and
females, indicating it is autosomal, as in other mammals
(human: Chr 1 [8,39,40], mouse: Chr 4 and rat: Chr 5).
WNT4 participates in multiple developmental events during embryogenesis, is broadly expressed in many adult tissues in mice and humans and has also been implicated in
adult tissue homeostasis [1-3,7,41,42]. Semi-quantitative
RT-PCR expression analyses in adult tammar tissues
showed a similar pattern to that of human WNT4 consist-

ent with a conserved and wide role for WNT4 in tissue
homeostasis.
WNT4 also appears to be important for the normal pattern formation and development of both the male and
female gonad [7]. In our study, using quantitative RT-PCR
and immunohistochemistry, WNT4 was expressed at
equal levels in the indifferent fetal and neonatal male and
female gonads. At this time, protein in the ovary was
localized to the somatic cells. Subsequently, WNT4
mRNA expression increased significantly to reach a peak
at day 9–13, the time that ovarian cortex and medulla can
be distinguished. After ovarian differentiation at day 12–
13 postpartum, WNT4 expression remained localized in
cortex and at the boundary of the cortex and medulla, but
by day 45 pp, there was stronger expression in the
medulla. The decreased WNT4 expression in the ovary to
a level similar to that in testis, coincides with the time
female germ cells enter meiosis [43].

Figure 4
WNT4 mRNA expression in tammar adult tissues
WNT4 mRNA expression in tammar adult tissues. Expression of the WNT4 gene (209bp) was assessed in a range of
adult tissues using the 18S mRNA (100bp) as a reference. There was very strong expression in the testis, ovary and kidney,
moderate expression in muscle and liver, weak expression in spleen and lung, and none in the brain, heart and prostate.

In the testis, WNT4 gene expression was significantly
down-regulated immediately after birth during the initial
period of testicular differentiation, coinciding with the
formation of seminiferous cords [13]. After cord formation, WNT4 levels increased slowly after day 8 postpartum
and became specific to Leydig cells. By day 49, when secretion of testicular testosterone decreases (Fig. 5b) [32], Leydig cells stained strongly for WNT4. We suggest that once
WNT4 reaches a critical threshold level, androgen production diminishes. The low level of immunostaining in the
adult testis and ovary is consistent with their increase in
steroidogenesis after puberty. This pattern of expression is
therefore consistent with the hypothesis that WNT4
blocks initial testis differentiation, because the mRNA
concentration is dramatically reduced and the WNT4 protein is localized to the tunica during this period of testicular development.

Conclusion
The two hypotheses for WNT4 action as an anti-testis gene
[4] and as an important factor in testis development [7]
are not mutually exclusive. Our data show that WNT4 is
down-regulated for a brief period of time when the testis
cords are first formed and the cell types of the testis determined, but then becomes up-regulated after day 10 post
partum to control later testicular development. In the
ovary, WNT4 remains strongly expressed in the gonad
consistent with its role in inhibiting early testicular development and promoting later ovarian differentiation. It
may also be important for the maintenance of germ cells
in both females and males throughout development. Our
data support the conclusion that WNT4 functions not
only as an anti-testis gene during early mammalian development, but is also necessary for later ovarian and testicular function.

Methods
Animals
Tammar wallabies Macropus eugenii of Kangaroo Island
(South Australia) origin were maintained in open grassy
yards in our breeding colony. Fetuses of each sex were collected at various stages of gestation as previously
described [44,45]. During the breeding season adult
females were checked daily for births (designated day 0
pp). In cases in which the day of birth was uncertain, the
age of pouch young was estimated using head length from
published growth curves [46]. The sex of pouch young was
determined by the presence or absence of scrotal or mammary primordia [17]. All sampling techniques and collection of tissues were approved by The University of
Melbourne Animal Experimentation & Ethics Committees. All experimental procedures conformed to Australian
National Health and Medical Research Council (1990)
guidelines and were approved by Institutional Animal
Experimentation Ethics Committees.
Tissues
Tissues from adult female heart, lung, kidney, liver,
spleen, muscle, brain and ovary and from adult male prostate and testis were collected under RNase-free conditions.
Gonads were dissected free from the mesonephros from
fetuses at day 25, 26 (n = 5 of each sex) and from each day
after birth between day 0 and day 49 (Table 1) postpartum pouch young. Tissues for molecular analysis were
snap frozen at -80°C until used. Tissues for immunohistochemistry were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed several times in PBS, and stored in 70%
ethanol before paraffin embedding and sectioning at 8
μm.

Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
WNT4 protein sequences, from tammar (GenBank accession number AY940685), human (NP_110388), mouse
(NP_033549), Rat (NP_445854), chicken (NP_990114),
frog (P49338), zebrafish (AAA96004), Amphioxus
(AAC80431), fruit fly (NP_476810) and C. elegans
(NP_493668), was aligned by CLUSTALX 1.83 [47], and
edited with GeneDoc)[48]. The phylogenetic tree was
constructed with PHYLIP 3.63 program (University of
Washington), and viewed with TREE-view 1.6.6.

Figure 6
Western blotting analysis of WNT4
Western blotting analysis of WNT4. Testis and ovary
protein cross-reacted with the human anti-WNT4 antibody
(Abcam), giving a 39 KD band as predicated from the tammar
WNT4 sequence. The two negative controls, heart and BSA,
did not cross-react.
Cloning of tammar WNT4 and determining gene structure
WNT4 was initially cloned by RT-PCR using cross species
primers designed to conserved regions of the gene (csF1
and csR1; Table 2). The resulting 536bp PCR product was
then used to design tammar specific primers for 3' and 5'
RACE to fully clone the WNT4 transcript (the sequences of
all primers are listed on table 2). Only one band was
observed for 3' RACE while multiple bands were seen for
5' RACE.

SMART cDNAs were reverse transcribed from total RNAs
from fetuses of wallaby, using the SMART cDNA library
construction kit (Clontech, Mountain View, California,
USA). 5' RACE was performed using Primer 5' PCR Primer
and R1. Owing to an incomplete coding sequence at the
5' end, we designed a new primer R2 according to the first
sequence results, and repeated 5' RACE. 3' RACE was performed using primer F1 and CDS III, nested PCR was performed using primer F2 and CDS III. PCR cycling
conditions were: 35 cycles, with 30s, 94°C; 40s, 64°C or
56°C, 120s, 72°C, in a 20 μl reaction mix containing 10
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 200
μM dNTP, 0.2 μM each primer, and 1U Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega, Wisconsin, USA).
In order to determine the tammar WNT4 gene structure, a
Macropus eugenii BAC library was screened using WNT4
3RACE probe obtained as outlined above. Primers within
and spanning intron exon boundaries were designed
based on the gene structure of human, mouse and the
opossum (deduced from the opossum genome sequence).
PCR confirmed the presence of all 4 introns at identical
positions to other mammals. We sequenced intron 3 and
intron 4 using the BAC plasmid DNA as a template, however, intron 1 and intron 2 were too large to amplify by
standard PCR (data not shown).

Southern blotting hybridization
Genomic DNA was extracted from the liver of the male
and female tammar wallabies according to the standard
protocol of Sambrook et al. [49], digested with EcoRI and
SalI/XbaI, electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. Hybridization was performed in ULTRAhyb solution (Ambion Inc., Austin,
Texas, USA) with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled fragment from
primer F2 and CDS III PCR, and autoradiographed.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from tissues using the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen Inc, Valencia, California, USA) or GeneElute kit
(Sigma, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia), and the quality and
quantity of total RNA were verified by two methods, gel
electrophoresis and optical density readings with SmartSpec™ 3000 (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). 2 μg of total RNA was DNase-treated with
DNA-free (Ambion Inc., Austin, Texas, USA). 1 μg of total
RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, California, USA).

Primers R1 and F2, spanning the second intron and third
intron, were designed from the tammar wallaby WNT4
gene structure. PCR was performed in a 50 μl reaction
containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50
mM KCl, 200 μM dNTP, 0.2 μM each primer, 1U Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega) and first-strand cDNA products.
Amplification conditions were: 94°C, 30s; 60°C (18S) or
56°C (WNT4), 40s; 72°C, 60s for 26 cycles (18S) or 40
cycles (WNT4).
Real-time quantitative PCR
To obtain further insight into roles of WNT4 in sex determination and differentiation, we investigated the WNT4
expression profile at different stages of gonadal development by quantitative RT-PCR. Gonads (free of mesonephros) were divided into six groups, each group consisting of
4–8 samples at each stage. Tammar forward primer qF and
reverse primer qR were used for real-time PCR and produced a 102 bp fragment. 18S primers produce a 100 bp
fragment as internal reference in the quantitative PCR.
Primer pair annealing temperature was optimized for realtime PCR on a temperature gradient program. Primer spe-

Immunolocalisation of WNT4 protein during gonadal development in the tammar
Immunolocalisation of WNT4 protein during gonadal development in the tammar. The relative developmental
stage of the fetus at each time point examined is shown in the top panels. In fetal gonads one day before birth (d25 of pregnancy), WNT4 protein was distributed broadly in the somatic cells of both females (a) and males (g); from 1–3 days after birth
WNT4 stained strongly in the presumptive ovary (b) while it decreased dramatically in the developing testis (h) as the seminiferous cords form. By 12–13 days post partum, WNT4 staining was more specific and clearer. In testis, there was strong
WNT4 staining in the Leydig cells and the tunica albuginea (i); there was strong staining in the somatic cells and medulla of the
ovary (c). There was no immunoreactivity in any of the negative controls: d, e, f, j, k and l (IgG, pre-immune serum). Co = cortex; M = mesonephroi; Me = medulla; Ov = ovary; ST = seminiferous tubule; T = testis; TA = tunica albuginea. Scale bars= 100

curve analysis. To determine the detection range, linearity
and real-time PCR amplification efficiency [E = 10[-1/slope]]
of each primer pair, real-time PCR amplifications were
run in triplicate on a 10-fold serial dilution of ovary cDNA
and standard curves calculated.

relative WNT4 expression between males and females at
each stage and between stages was achieved using analysis
of variance with specified contrasts for individual comparisons (Systat 11, Systat software Inc, Point Richmond, California, USA).

cDNA templates from all stages of gonadal development
were prepared as above. Real-time PCR was performed on
the DNA Engube Opticon 2 by MJ Research Incorporated
(BioRad Laboratories Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts,
USA). Each sample was amplified in triplicate in a 20 μl
reaction volume using 4 μl cDNA (dilution 10 times
before using), 10 μl 2X MasterAmp qPCR SYBR Green Fluorescein Mix (F-400, DyNAmo™ SYRB® Green qPCR kit,
Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), 3 μM of the appropriate
forward and reverse primers, and then 3 μl H2O to 20 μl
final volume. The mixture was incubated at 55°C for 15
minutes, and then at 95°C for 10 minutes to activate the
Taq polymerase. This was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds, annealed at 53°C for 20
seconds, extended at 72°C for 35 seconds, and incubated
at 76°C for 1 second to read the plate. Finally, a melt
curve analysis was constructed from 40 to 95°C.

Western blotting
Developing testis and ovaries (D30-50pp) and two negative adult heart and BSA were collected. Tissues were
homogenised in lysis buffer, and extracted total protein.
10 μg of each protein was boiled in sample buffer, electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Hybond
NC membranes (Millipore Corporate, Massachusetts,
USA). Goat anti-hWNT4 polyclonal antibody (Abcam,
ab15699, Sapphire Bioscience Pty Ltd, Australia) was used
as a primary antibody which was diluted 1:750 in 1%
BSA/TBS-T. As a secondary antibody, the peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat immunoglobulin was diluted 1:750 in
1% BSA/TBS-T. Signals were visualized by ECL plus™
detection system (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited,
Buckinghamshire, UK).

The initial amplification of PCR product can be dynamically expressed as Xn = X0*(1+E)n, where Xn is the number
of amplified molecules at cycle n, X0 the initial number of
template molecules, E the amplification efficiency, and n
the number of cycles. In fluorescence dye real-time PCR,
Xn is proportional to the reporter fluorescence R, so the
above equation can be written as Rn = R0*(1+E)n, where Rn
is the reporter fluorescence at cycle n, and R0 the initial
reporter fluorescence[50]. Therefore, the relative expression of each sample can be calculated by the following
formula: ratio = (1+ERef)CtRef/(1+ETarget)CtTarget. Values can
be assessed to create a graph with the smallest value set as
"1" according to the above formula. Comparison of the

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections (8 μm) were treated with 5% hydrogen
peroxide in distilled H2O for 10 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieval was achieved
by placing slides in boiling sodium citrate buffer (10 mM
Sodium Citrate, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 6.0) for 20 min.
The primary antibody goat anti-WNT4 polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab15699) was applied to sections at a
1:200 dilution at 4°C overnight. Signal was amplified
using the ABC/HRP kit (DAKO, New South Wales, Australia), visualized with DAB (DAKO), and counterstained
with haematoxylin.
