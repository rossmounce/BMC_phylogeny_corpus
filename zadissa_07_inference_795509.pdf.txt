Abstract
Background: Gene expression is in part regulated by sequences in promoters that bind
transcription factors. Thus, co-expressed genes may have shared sequence motifs representing
putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). However, for agriculturally important animals
the genomic sequence is often incomplete. The more complete human genome may be able to be
used for this prediction by taking advantage of the expected evolutionary conservation in TFBSs
between the species.
Results: A method of de novo TFBS prediction based on MEME was implemented, tested, and
validated on a muscle-specific dataset.
Muscle specific expression data from EST library analysis from cattle was used to predict sets of
genes whose expression was enriched in muscle and cardiac tissues. The upstream 1500 bases from
calculated orthologous genes were extracted from the human reference set. A set of common
motifs were discovered in these promoters. Slightly over one third of these motifs were identified
as known TFBSs including known muscle specific binding sites. This analysis also predicted several
highly statistically significantly overrepresented sites that may be novel TFBS.
An independent analysis of the equivalent bovine genomic sequences was also done, this gave less
detailed results than the human analysis due to both the quality of orthologue prediction and
assembly in promoter regions. However, the most common motifs could be detected in both sets.
Conclusion: Using promoter sequences from human genes is a useful approach when studying
gene expression in species with limited or non-existing genomic sequence. As the bovine genome
becomes better annotated it can in turn serve as the reference genome for other agriculturally
important ruminants, such as sheep, goat and deer.

Background
To date, many evolutionary studies have focused on conservation of protein coding sequences between species,
however, gene expression patterns across species can also

be used for evolutionary studies [1]. The focus of this
study is on the proximal promoter [2]. Proximal promoters consist of a heterogeneous collection of smaller regulatory elements including transcription factor binding

sites (TFBSs). TFBSs are short DNA sequences which bind
transcription factors that modulate the level of expression
of their cognate gene(s) [3]. Many stimulatory TFBSs are
positioned near the transcription start site (TSS), within
the proximal promoter region [4]. In some cases, co-regulated genes or tissue-specific genes contain a common set
of TFBSs and are controlled by same transcription factors.
Analysis of promoter regions is one of the major
approaches in understanding the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Hence, by identifying the binding sites
in the promoters, the pattern of transcriptional regulation
may be inferred [5]. Tissue specific promoters, such as
those examined in this study often have a single dominant
peak and clustering of sequence specific factor binding
sites around the TSS [6,7].

bind to the predicted motifs and regulate the genes, the
motifs were compared with previously described TFBSs
and their best hit among known binding sites was identified. These results were then compared with the orthologous bovine promoter sequences where available,
applying the same procedure. Finally, we combined and
contrasted the various approaches and data sets and
examined the underlying substructure of the results using
clustering of motif frequencies in the promoter sequences.
We propose and test a general method to deduce regulatory motifs in promoter regions of mammalian species
with restricted genomic sequence by using a well-characterised reference genome.

Results
The region analysed in this study is 1500 bases prior to the
TSS. Deletion assays of the region 1000 bases prior to the
TSS of 45 ENCODE promoters [4] indicated positional
preference, relative to the TSS, for elements that contribute negatively and positively to the promoter activity.
Negative elements resided between -1000 to -500 bp
upstream of the TSS, while the positive elements were
placed closer to the TSS, between -350 to -40 bp upstream
of the TSS in 55% of the genes tested [4]. These conclusions supported previous analyses of functional regions in
promoter sequences where it has been established that
most (91%) of promoters spanning 550 bp upstream of
the TSS had significant transcriptional activity, indicating
that the region contains active binding sites [8]. This study
does not examine cis-regulatory elements, particularly in
enhancers and silencers outside this region [9].

Analysis of a de novo motif prediction and identification
method
Common motifs in promoter sequences were detected
using the motif prediction programme MEME [10]. In a
recent survey of tools for promoter motif prediction
MEME performed well among the thirteen different tools
that were assessed [11]. Sequences were analysed on both
strands for common cis-regulatory elements of length 8 –
12 bp. The predicted elements were subsequently compared to the TFBS databases TRANSFAC [12] and JASPAR
[13], for identification of the motifs as potential regulatory elements. For each predicted motif, a series of
matches were produced, each representing the best hit
from their corresponding length category by a scoring
mechanism (see Methods). To determine significant
matches, a permutation test was also performed.

Co-expressed genes can be determined by a number of
techniques, such as microarray experiments or EST profiling. These methods usually examine a subset of genes in
the genome. However, identifying common TFBSs in
these genes allows one to infer the mechanism of co-regulation, establishing genome-wide frequencies of the
TFBSs, and detect additional co-regulated genes not
present on the array or detected in the original EST library.
This approach also has the major benefit that it is
sequence-based and is less dependent on prior knowledge
on which many other methods of interpreting genomic
studies depend. The current challenge is to extend this
technique from well-characterised model species, such as
human, to those with limited genomic annotation information, such as cattle.

The approach of de novo motif prediction and identification of these motifs as TFBSs was validated using the wellcharacterised and well-adopted muscle-specific regulatory
elements collection and the five related TFBSs described
by Wasserman and Fickett [14]. The human subset of this
collection comprising 46 sequences and the five matrices
acted as the training set (Figure 1a, group a).

In order to test the feasibility of using the human genome
as a reference set for motif prediction, we used a set of
bovine and human expression data from cardiac tissue.
Initially, we used the homologous human genes and identified a set of motifs common in the promoter regions of
the genes. To determine which transcription factors might

Comparison between matrices for the predicted motifs
(Figure 2) in human muscle specific set (a) and those for
the binding sites previously determined identified three of
the five sites (Figure 2). This indicated that the process had
correctly predicted the majority of the matrices. The best
match to motif a1 was myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2)
with a dissimilarity score (S) of 0.74 and p-value (P) of 3.0
× 10-3. Motifs a2, a9 and a10 all matched Sp1, with a9
having the lowest score. The best binding site for the Myf
transcription factor was motif a5 with a score of 1.21 and
p-value of 1.0 × 10-3. Motif a8 also matched to Myf but
with a higher score of 1.96 (P = 1.7 × 10-2). Matches to
TEF-1 and SRF were not significant (Figure 2).

Sequences in the muscle-specific gene set were examined with MEME for de novo prediction of motifs. The resulting motifs were subsequently
compared to entries in the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases for identification. For each identified motif, the dissimilarity score (S) and the p-value
(P) are shown. Corrected p-value for each match is based on an estimated FDR of 10%. Matches to the JASPAR database are marked by (*).

The predicted motifs of the muscle specific set were also
compared to the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases. Several motifs had significant matches, with dissimilarity
scores below the selected threshold of 1.3, and p-values
less than 0.05 (Table 1). Comparison of the predicted
MEME motifs with the entries in the two databases again
identified the first motif (a1) as a MEF2 binding site.
Motif a2, although identified as a binding site for the
Churchill domain containing 1 protein (CHCH_01), is
highly similar to the binding site for the Sp1 transcription
factor [15]. Structurally, the Churchill site is similar to the
binding site for the Sp1 factor and hence the a2 motif may
be an Sp1 binding site. The TRANSFAC SP1_Q6 and
SP1_Q2_01 matrices, both representing binding sites for
the ubiquitous Sp1 transcription factor, match to a2 with
low scores (S < 1), but non-significant p-values (Table 1).
The a5 motif was identified as a binding site for the Myf
factor in JASPAR, confirming the previous annotation of
this motif.
Motifs a4 and a15 had significant hits to known TFBS
which were different to the expected binding sites. The a4
motif matched the complementary strand to POU6F1_01.
The corresponding factor for this matrix is the POU
domain, class 6, transcription factor 1. The gene encoding
this protein has been shown to be expressed in muscle tissues and is involved in transcriptional regulation of several genes in cardiac tissue [16]. The a15 motif had a high
similarity to TEL2_Q6 and its related matrix ETS_Q4, both
belonging to the v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene
gene family.
None of the remaining motifs had matches that met the
selection criteria and, therefore, they may represent novel
regulatory elements. To estimate false positive rates one
thousand randomisations of the original 46 sequences
were done and motifs predicted. Among the original set of
predicted motifs, seven had no similar hits in the 1000

randomisation sets (indicated in Figure 2) [see Additional
file 1]. Four of these are novel a3, a7, a13, although a7 has
some similarity to the MYOGNF1_01 site, the myogenin
binding site.
Screening all 24030 equivalent RefSeq promoters using
MAST gave the genome-wide frequencies of the predicted
motifs. Motif a2 is the most frequent among the promoters (4847 occurrences) [see Additional file 2]. The other
four motifs similar to known sites, that is a1, a4, a5 and
a15, had less than 500 occurrences in the promoters, suggesting that they may be restricted to a subset of genes.
Comparison of the de novo predicted motifs in the muscle
specific set (a) with three sets of known TFBSs demonstrates that the methodology adopted for the analysis
found both known and novel motifs. Five of the 14
unique motifs (36%) could be identified as resembling
known TFBSs. The most significant novel motifs were a3
and a7 (Figure 2). These two motifs were common in the
dataset with 9 and 16 occurrences but absent in the control randomisation sets [see Additional file 1].
Analysis of genes expressed in bovine cardiac cDNA libraries and
homologous human genes (group b)
This group of human genes serves as a model set of data
representing a genome for which expression data are
available but there is limited genomic sequence. Bovine
expression data, based on EST sequences were analysed
for cardiac-specific expression using two independent
methods (Figure 1b and 1c). One method exclusively
employed the bovine EST frequency in each tissue library
(group b, bovine tissue specific; Table 2), while the other
used human cardiac expression data in addition to the
bovine data (group c, human cardiac filter; Table 3).

The EST sequences from 48 selected bovine tissue libraries
were assembled into contigs and those contigs containing

Page 4 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:265

six or more ESTs were retained. These contigs were then
analysed for cardiac tissue specific expression and 36 were
selected. Putative human homologues for the contigs were
obtained through BLASTN analysis [17], by comparing
the bovine contig consensus sequences to the human RefSeq database (RefSeq release as of 02/09/2005), giving
rise to 23 unique human RefSeq genes (Figure 1b, Table
2). The genes include well-known muscle-specific genes
encoding sarcomeric or sarcomeric-associated proteins,
such as Troponin T type 2 (TNNT2) and Troponin I type
3 (TNNI3), myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) and
other myosin-related genes.
A segment of 1500 bp upstream of the TSS for each of the
genes was analysed for common cis-regulatory elements.
This region is expected to contain most of the binding
sites that are involved in transcription initiation [7,8].
Table 4 along with Figure 3 summarises the motifs predicted by MEME in the 23 human promoters and their
best matches in TRANSFAC and JASPAR. There were significant similarities between several of the motifs, and
could be collapsed into six groups [see Additional file 3]
indicating that they may represent variations of the same
element (TFBS). Binding sites for the Sp1 and MEF2 factors were identified among the predicted motifs, b1 h and
b6 h respectively. Other motifs identified include E47_01
(motif b5 h), a binding site for the E47 factor. This protein, along with E12, are splice variants from the E2A gene
and can interact with the muscle-specific transcription factor MyoD by dimerising with this protein [18]. Motif b8 h
was identified as a binding site for the AP2 protein. The
AP2 factor is known to be involved in regulation of muscle development [19]. Motif b11 h had significant similarity to MZF 5–13, which corresponds to the second DNA
binding domain of myeloid zinc finger gene 1 (MZF1). Its
role in the regulation of muscle genes has not previously
been reported. Detailed information about the motifs and
their hits are available in [see Additional file 3]. Motifs b2
h and b4 h were the most significant novel motifs.
Analysis of genes expressed in bovine muscle cDNA libraries and
human cardiac tissue (group c)
A group of 101 bovine EST contigs [see Additional file 4]
expressed specifically in four muscle and cardiac libraries
was selected (Figure 1c).

Comparison with the human genome identified 73
unique human RefSeq genes [see Additional file 5]. These
were later filtered for expression in human cardiac tissue
using microarray expression ratios [20] extracted from the
UCSC genome browser. Of the 73 human sequences, 25
met the cutoff of an expression ratio of > 2 in cardiac tissue. Therefore, this approach also employs gene expression information from the reference genome. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/265

methodology is useful when the equivalent information
in the original genome is not available.
Promoter sequences for the above 25 genes were analysed
as described before. The motif prediction in promoter
regions of the human genes identified 15 distinct motifs
(Figure 4) with no similarities between the motifs. Nine of
the 15 predicted motifs had matches to known TFBSs
(Table 5). The Sp1 binding site was again detected among
the motifs (c1 h). None of the Sp1 site matches to c1 h
were significant by the p-value criteria, although the dissimilarity scores for the matches clearly indicate that the
site may indeed be a binding site for the Sp1 factor. Other
motifs identified in this group are the TATA-box element
(TBP_Q6 in TRANSFAC) present in promoters and a binding site for the GATA4 transcription factor. The GATA4
protein, a cardiac tissue-specific transcription factor, is
expressed in early cardiac progenitor cells [21]. The c4 h,
c9 h, c14 h and c15 h were identified PAX4, PAX, EGRF4
and MAZ binding sites, respectively [see Additional file 6].
Analysis of the motifs predicted in group c shows the presence of several potentially muscle-specific regulatory elements found in the promoters of human genes.
Compared to genes in group b, there was far less redundancy in the predicted motifs, which may be due to
slightly larger data sets and also the expression specificity
of the selected data, as expression array information may
more accurately predict expression than EST profiling.
Frequency of the predicted motifs in the combined cardiac
specific promoters
The unique MEME motifs, seven predicted in group b
(Figure 3) and all the 15 motifs in group c (Figure 4), were
combined together (indicated with red arrow in Figure 1).
Similar motifs were identified and collapsed using MAST
[22].

The sequences from cardiac groups b and c were combined and eight common sequences were identified,
resulting in 40 unique sequences. Predicted motifs from
the two groups were then clustered based on their frequency in all the promoters (Figure 5). This was done to
reveal information which may not be obvious from the
global motif analysis, for example whether presence and
frequency levels of specific motifs can be related to the
functions of the corresponding genes. Figure 5 shows a
colour map of the non-redundant motifs and their frequency in the promoter sequences. Of the seven unique
motifs in group b, five were in common with group c (r >
0.6). A distinct group of promoter sequences has the highest frequencies of the c1 h_b1 h, c2 h and c3 h motifs (top
left in Figure 5). The first two motifs were identified as
TFBSs for the Sp1 and GATA4 transcription factors, respectively. The c3 h motif had no matches and may represent

Identification of expected motifs in the muscle specific data set (group a)
Identification of expected motifs in the muscle specific data set (group a). Sequences in the muscle-specific gene set
were examined with MEME for de novo prediction of common motifs. The top 15 motifs were then compared to expected
muscle TFBSs described in [14]. The motifs are displayed along with the number of sequences containing each motif and the
number of sites observed in all sequences in column 1. Sequence logos for the predicted motif and the expected TFBS are displayed, as are the calculated dissimilarity scores (S) and p-values (P) for each comparison. Orientation of the predicted motifs
may be reverse to the reference motif, as we consider both strands when predicting the motifs. Motifs marked with (†) have

a novel motif related to expression of the genes. The promoter group containing these motifs consists of 12
sequences, including several of the sarcomeric genes
described earlier. This suggests a likely role of the motifs
in relation to the common function of the genes. The
same group of promoters also display a high frequency of
other motifs (top right in Figure 5). These latter motifs
also form a subcluster and their presence in the same
group of promoters implies possible transcriptional regulation in a modular fashion whereby the presence of several transcription factors is required for activation of
transcription. The two subclusters of motifs are also
present in another group of promoters (lower part of Figure 5) but at a less pronounced frequency. These genes
have a number of functions, such as energy pathways, cell
communication and cell growth. The promoter sequence
of the phospholamban gene (PLN) does not cluster with
any other sequence and has three distinct motifs at high
rates. These motifs were identified as TFBSs for the TBP
(c11 h and c12 h), MEF2 (b3 h) and homeodomain of
PAX4 (c4 h) factors.
An examination of the motif frequency patterns in the
promoters shows that five of the seven unique motifs
(71%) are in common between the two sets [see Additional file 7]. This is an indication that using the inherent
bovine EST frequencies in tissue libraries is sufficient for
the analysis of regulatory patterns.
The 40 promoters predicted by either methods (b and c)
to be cardiac specific were examined for overlap with CpG
islands [23], only 11 overlapped. None of the eight promoters predicted by both methods had CpG islands
within the 1500 bases upstream of the TSS only one had a
TATA box within 50 bases. This is consistent with our
finding of c1 h_b1 h/GC/Sp1 sites in these promoters
(Figure 5).
Analysis of bovine genome sequences
The bovine genome is the first of the artidactyl genomes
to be sequenced. The Btau2.0, 6.2 fold coverage assembly
comprises 1.7 Gb with only 24% in contigs > 1000 bases.
The small contig size creates problems for extraction of
regions upstream of the TSS or first coding exon. Orthologous bovine promoters from the 23 human RefSeqs in
group b, were retrieved using Ensembl's gene orthology
criteria [24]. Fifteen orthologues could be retrieved (Table
1).

The 15 sequences were analysed as before. Of the six
unique motifs, three were in common with motifs predicted in their human orthologues corresponding to AP2
(b11b group, b15b, b11b) and MEF2 (b2b group) [see
Additional file 8]. Two novel motifs (b1b, and b3b)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/265

occurred frequently with 19 and 25 occurrences, in 8 and
11 of 15 sequences [see Additional file 7].

Discussion
A common problem in agricultural science is incomplete
genomic sequence for the species of interest, and therefore
limited or no access to the promoter sequences. The proposed solution is to identify orthologous genes in related
species that have sequenced genomes and extract the relevant promoter regions. These promoters can then be used
to search for common regulatory motifs. The approach
used here was to examine the promoter regions of coexpressed genes for shared motifs. Such a method can
identify both known and novel TFBSs, it can also potentially identify genes that may be co-expressed but that
have not been measured as part of the experiment.
In this paper we present a simple approach for deducing
regulatory information in mammalian genomes with
restricted sequence by using a reference genome. We evaluate this approach using an independent data set. We
used MEME [22] for predicting motifs in promoter
sequences of the genes. MEME performed well in a recent
assessment of tools employed for prediction of TFBSs [11]
and offers a flexible set of parameters.
Wasserman and Fickett [14] compiled and analysed a
group of experimentally verified muscle regulatory
regions and discovered the presence of five specific binding sites in these sequences. This human subset (group a)
of this collection was used as the training set to evaluate
the proposed approach. Promoter analysis of sequences in
the training set identified three of the five expected binding sites for muscle-specific transcription factors. We identified MEF2, Sp1 and Myf binding sites significantly in the
set. The SRF binding site also matched to the same motif
identified as a MEF2 site (a1). This result suggests that
MEME may be clustering these two binding sites together
due to the similarity at the centre of both sites. The randomisation of the training data also supported this observation. The composition, that is number of sequences and
sites that contribute to the structure of a motif, of several
low ranking motifs, such as a7, a9, a10 and a13, were very
distinct from motifs generated from the random
sequences. Hence, the approach used was to examine all
15 predicted motifs regardless of their MEME reported evalues in the subsequent analyses. We conclude from this

many profiles have also been computationally extended –
introducing potential redundancy into the data. Many of
the longer binding sites are contributing to non-specific
matches. The size of the JASPAR database is much smaller
than TRANSFAC but it consists of experimentally verified
and highly curated profiles. Overall in this study more of
the TRANSFAC hits had p-values < 0.05 compared to those
in JASPAR.
The MEF2 binding site was identified. The MEF2 gene
family members are expressed during early embryogenesis
and throughout the developing myocardium and are wellcharacterised for their involvement in muscle differentiation [25-27]. The conserved DNA binding domain in
these regulators recognises an AT-rich consensus
sequence, present in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes [28,29]. The MEF2 motifs in the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases are largely based on in vitro
SELEX data and differ slightly from each other and from
that in [14].

Sp1 like motifs were also be identified, including the
CHCH_01 motif in group a, that is a partial motif of the
Sp1 binding site. The POU6F1 binding site identified in
the set may be a novel muscle element. POU6F1 is a member of the homeobox protein family, involved in developmental processes, and has been shown to be expressed in
muscle tissue [16]. Another potentially novel factor for
transcriptional regulation of muscle genes is TEL2, a
member of the ETS family. However, this same motif
matched the ETS-1 motif itself, which has been shown to
be involved in cardiac morphogenesis [30,31] and the
TEF-1 motif in JASPAR also matched the same motif, indicating a similar composition in the two motifs.
Once we had evaluated our method, we subsequently utilised bovine cDNA expression data for the study. Contigs
resulting from assembling the initial ESTs were analysed
for muscle and cardiac tissue-specific expression using
two methods. The first method used only the bovine EST
frequency per library data. The second method employed
both bovine and human expression data. Fourteen motifs

promoters were identified as known TFBSs. Comparison
of the unique motifs detected in the human promoters of
groups b and c show that 71% in group b are in common
between the two sets. These results indicate that even
though the genes in the two sets were selected partially
independently from each other, they produce similar
results.

Once promoter sequences sharing common regulatory
elements were identified, the combination of motifs
present in the promoters could then be used to determine
additional substructure within the results using clustering
based on the number TFBSs present in the promoters. This
suggests that the number and order of TFBSs present in a
promoter encodes information that can be easily extracted
from the results of this approach. The eight common pro-

The sequences were analysed by MEME to predict common motifs. The resulting motifs were compared to the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases
for identifying known binding sites. The dissimilarity score (S) and p-value (P) for each comparison are shown. Corrected p-value for each match is
based on an estimated FDR of 10%. Matches to the JASPAR database are marked by (*). Sequence logos for the matrices are given in Figure 4.

moters contained multiple Sp1 like sites (Figure 5) and
generally lacked CpG islands and TATA boxes near to the
TSS. Promoters with these characteristics generally had a
single dominant peak of TSS [6] in other tissues, but
potential alternative promoter starts were not examined in
this study.
For the bovine genome two assemblies are currently in use
(Btau2.0) used here and Btau3.1. The latest assembly has
increased the size of the contigs to 61% > 1000 (rather
than 24%) [32]. However, this is still much lower than
that of human at 94% > 5000. Therefore the assembly in
regulatory regions, particularly the link between these and
the coding regions remains much better for the human
genome, and the human genome will remain a useful reference.
However, the current method suffers from some caveats.
It does not use all available information, such as co-localisation and order of the TFBSs. Additionally, the method
is not well-suited for determining gene regulation in tissues not shared between species, such as the rumen in artiodactyl mammals. This will therefore impose restrictions
on the kind of analyses that may be performed. This barrier will, however, be overcome with a comprehensive
annotation of bovine genome.
In the latest version of MEME, it is now possible to compare the produced PFMs to known motifs in JASPAR [33],
a procedure similar to this study. It produces similar
results but is also limited by the incompleteness of the
JASPAR database as found here.
Examining the evolutionary conservation of the motifs
can give further information about individual motifs and
their inferred involvement in transcriptional regulation.
Using available tools for phylogenetic footprinting stud-

ies, such as multi-species sequence alignments from public databases, e.g. the UCSC or Ensembl genome browsers,
can aid in this task. The recently developed PhyMe [34]
and PhyloGibbs [35] programmes address this proposed
approach, using motif over-representation coupled with
phylogenetic comparison to calculate significance of the
predicted motifs. These will become more powerful as the
number of genomes sequenced increases and the coverage
and quality of their assembly improve.

Conclusion
By comparing two methods, both initially based on
bovine EST data, we show that using human promoter
regions as a reference platform in interpreting ruminant
expression studies is a viable solution for the analysis of
gene regulation patterns in the bovine genome.
The proposed method is simple and easy to implement
with existing software and is robust when sufficient coexpressed (co-regulated) sequences can be identified.
Finally, as the bovine genome becomes better annotated,
it can serve as an interim platform for many other agriculturally important animals, such as sheep and goat, until
their genome sequences become available.

Methods
Collection of data sets
In this paper, we analyse three data sets. The first set consists of regulatory regions involved in muscle-specific gene
expression. This group was compiled by Wasserman and
Fickett to study transcription factors associated with skeletal muscle gene regulation [14]. They constructed a set of
five position frequency matrices based on binding sites for
MEF2, Myf, SRF, TEF-1 and Sp1 transcription factors
which were found to bind within these sequences. The
regulatory regions for the human subset and the matrices
served as the training set to validate our approach. The

motifs. Frequency matrices of predicted motifs were sub-

entropy described below. This group is referred to as

group a in the paper. The collection of elements was
retrieved from [36].
The second and third data sets (groups b and c) were
based on bovine contigs assembled using bovine
sequences – a collection of sequences from AgResearch
bovine EST libraries along with all bovine cDNAs submitted to NCBI sequence repositories at the time (September
2005). The contigs were generated from the ESTs using
CAP3 [37] and resulted in 6223 contigs, each containing
≥ 6 ESTs. In order to distinguish cardiac-specific genes, the
contigs were subjected to the following criterion: more
than 90% of the ESTs in the contig should be present in
the bovine cardiac library. The contigs were then used for
retrieving their human homologues. Annotation of the
sequences was performed using their corresponding
human RefSeq sequence (RefSeq release as of 02/09/
2005). The BLASTN [17] sequence analysis was employed
to identify sequence homology and each bovine contig
was annotated with the best human RefSeq homologue. If
several bovine contigs matched the same human gene, the
gene was reported only once, resulting in a list of unique
human RefSeq genes. The human RefSeq sequences comprised the second data set for the analysis, group b. In parallel to this approach, human orthologues of contigs in
four bovine muscle libraries (NCBI dbEST ID numbers:
18993, 18997, 18987 and 19022) were examined for their
expression levels in human cardiac tissue using publicly
available human gene expression results. The human RefSeqs were submitted to the University of California-Santa
Cruz (UCSC) Human Gene sorter [38] using the GNF
Gene Expression Atlas 2 [20]. Genes with an expression
log ratio of 2 or higher in heart tissue were selected. These
human genes comprised group c. Figure 1 displays a diagram of the different approaches and the data selection
procedure.
Promoter extraction
A region of 1500 bp upstream of the transcription start
site for all the human RefSeq genes was extracted using the
UCSC human genome browser [23]. The sequences were
masked for repetitive elements during the retrieval process. Intersect with CpG island prediction (cpgIslandExt)
was done using the UCSC table browser. The promoters of
the orthologous bovine genes were retrieved from
Ensembl.
Motif discovery
All data sets, groups a – c, were separately examined to
identify common and potentially functional elements
present in the promoter regions using MEME. Based on
the assumption that transcription factor binding sites
would likely consist of small and highly conserved motifs,
the programme was set to output the top 15 motifs from
each set, with motif length ranging between 8 and 12

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/265

bases long. We also allowed for each motif to occur any
number of times in a single sequence. The minimum and
maximum number of sites were allowed to vary between
6 and 50 respectively. The reverse complement strand of
each sequence was also considered in the analysis.
Sequence logos for all the motifs were generated using
WebLogo [39]. Using the MAST programme, promoter
sequences for all human RefSeq genes were screened for
the presence of all unique motifs from each data set.
Motif clustering
The promoters of the human genes in groups b and c were
combined together, as were the motifs predicted in the
two sets, for identification of all motifs shared between
the sets. Duplicated sequences were removed. Any motifs
with a Pearson's correlation coefficient > 0.6 were identified and collapsed. The motif frequencies in the different
promoters were analysed using hierarchical clustering in R
[40], where the dissimilarities between the frequencies
were taken into account. The resulting matrix was then
used to generate a colour map. The same procedure was
also applied to the bovine promoter sequences from
groups b and c.
Identification of known motifs
To test for known biological relevance of the MEME
motifs, the transcription factor databases TRANSFAC v8.1
[12] and JASPAR [13] were used. The flat file for the
TRANSFAC database was accessible through a commercial
licence while the JASPAR matrix files were freely available
from [41]. The database flat files were parsed using the
TFBS Perl modules [42] to generate position frequency
matrices (PFMs). Only the vertebrate matrices from the
databases were employed, resulting in 522 TRANSFAC
and 83 JASPAR matrices respectively.
Matrix similarity
Consider the predicted motifs generated by MEME and
the known sites from the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases. The corrected probability, pbj, of observing nucleotide b at position j is given by:

pbj =

fbj + αb

N + ∑ αb

,

where fbj denotes the observed frequency of each base at
position j, N is the total number of sites and αb are constants added to correct for small sample sizes. Given two
position weight matrices (PWMs), M1 and M2, the relative
entropy or dissimilarity score (S), also known as the Kullbeck-Liebler distance, of the two PWMs can be calculated
as:

where M1 and M2 are assumed to have the same number

score for comparing two matrices. The dissimilarity score
(S), ranging between 0 and 6 in this study, is an indication
of the degree of dissimilarity between the two matrices –
i.e. a value of zero indicates a perfect match while higher
values indicate less homology between the two matrices.

Additional material
Given two sets of PFMs, one comprising the predicted
matrices and the other a database of known matrices for
TFBSs, a Perl [43] script was used to carry out matrix comparisons – comparing each predicted matrix to all the
entries in the database. To compare two PFMs of different
lengths, a sliding window with length equal to the shorter
PFM was used. At each comparison instant the following
criteria has to be satisfied: the length of the comparison
window has to be at least six bases long, and the overlapping segment of at least one of the matrices has to have a
minimum of 60% information content in total. The final
score for a comparison is normalised by dividing by the
length of the comparing window. As transcription factors
have the ability to bind to the DNA on either strand, the
Perl script also tests the reverse complement of the predicted MEME matrices. The database matrices are divided
into categories depending on their length. Best matches
from each length category are reported, resulting in a
series of hits for each of the MEME matrices. The final best
match for each predicted matrix was selected from these
by using random permutations of each MEME matrix to
estimate statistical significance (see below).
Permutation analysis
In order to evaluate the statistical significance of the
obtained matrix matches, each MEME matrix was randomly permuted 1000 times to obtain a p-value. The permutations re-sort the base composition of the matrix
while keeping other associations such as the GC content
and the depth of the matrix, i.e. the number of sites,
unchanged. The false discovery rate (FDR) of the procedure was estimated by adjusting the p-values resulting
from the permutations for the number of hypotheses
tested, i.e. 15 matrix comparisons. The p.adjust programme in the R stats package [40] was used for the purpose. Sequences in the training set were shuffled 1000
times to generate 1000 random sequence sets. These were
subsequently examined by MEME where in total 15000
motifs were generated. The motifs were used to obtain
background distributions for number of sequences and
number of sites that comprised the motifs.
