Expansion and functional diversification of a
leucyl aminopeptidase family that encodes the
major protein constituents of Drosophila sperm
Steve Dorus1, Elaine C Wilkin1 and Timothy L Karr2*

Abstract
Background: The evolutionary diversification of gene families through gene creation (and loss) is a dynamic
process believed to be critical to the evolution of functional novelty. Previous identification of a closely related
family of eight annotated metalloprotease genes of the M17 Merops family in the Drosophila sperm proteome
(termed, Sperm-LeucylAminoPeptidases, S-LAPs 1-8) led us to hypothesize that this gene family may have
experienced such a diversification during insect evolution.
Results: To assess putative functional activities of S-LAPs, we (i) demonstrated that all S-LAPs are specifically
expressed in the testis, (ii) confirmed their presence in sperm by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass
spectrometry, (iii) determined that they represent a major portion of the total protein in sperm and (iv) identified
aminopeptidase enzymatic activity in sperm extracts using LAP-specific substrates. Functionally significant
divergence at the canonical M17 active site indicates that the largest phylogenetic group of S-LAPs lost catalytic
activity and likely acquired novel, as yet undetermined, functions in sperm prior to the expansion of the gene
family.
Conclusions: Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses revealed the dramatic expansion of the S-LAP gene
family during Drosophila evolution and copy number heterogeneity in the genomes of related insects. This finding,
in conjunction with the loss of catalytic activity and potential neofunctionalization amongst some family members,
extends empirical support for pervasive “revolving door” turnover in the evolution of reproductive gene family
composition and function.

Background
Gene duplication is considered a fundamental process in
the generation of genes with novel functions and ultimately the evolution of biological diversity [1]. A wide
variety of evolutionary and comparative genomic analyses have been used to infer the origins and fates of
newly created genes [2-5]. While more limited in scope,
molecular genetic and functional studies [6-9] have provided new insights into the role gene duplication has
played in generating novel functions. In Drosophila,
comparative genomic analyses have revealed an

enrichment of rapidly evolving or lineage specific gene
families associated with reproduction [10]. While the
functional significance of this remains to be fully determined, the trend can be explained, in part, by creation
of male-biased genes through retrotransposition. Recent
studies have demonstrated that retrogenes in both Drosophila [11,12] and primates [13-16] tend to acquire testis-specific expression. However, we still have limited
understanding of why new genes frequently acquire testis expression and whether testis-specific expression is
obtained prior to, or following, acquisition of functionality. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that newly generated genes and gene families have had a functional
impact on spermatogenesis and on the evolution of
sperm [8,12,17].

Although new testis-specific genes might be expected
to have gained functions in spermatogenesis, there are a
limited number of characterized examples of such genes
in Drosophila. One example is the strict paternal-effect
gene ms(3)K81 (termed “K81“), a gene created by retrotransposition prior to the divergence of the melanogaster subgroup [8]. In wild-type eggs fertilized by sperm
from K81 males, paternal chromosomes systematically
fail to properly separate sister chromatids during the
first zygotic division leading to lethality early in embryogenesis [8]. Interestingly, K81 is expressed only in primary spermatocytes where it presumably regulates
aspects of spermatogenesis required for proper sperm
function in the egg. A second example is mojoless (mjl),
created approximately 50mya through the retrotransposition of shaggy (sgg), a glycogen synthase kinase-3
encoding gene [9]. RNAi knockdown of mjl resulted in
loss of the male germ line and male sterility. Although
not yet ascribed a characterized function in the testis or
sperm, a third gene, Sdic, is a newly created gene encoding a protein present in the sperm tail [17]. Sdic is an
unusual case of an X-linked chimeric gene specific to
Drosophila melanogaster that was created through the
duplication of annexinX (AnnX) and subsequent fusion
with Cdic, a cytoplasmic dynein gene.
The application of mass spectrometry (MS) to the
study of sperm has provided our first insights into the
dynamic role new gene creation has played in shaping
the constituents of the sperm proteome [18] and has
raised intriguing questions about how these new genes
have impacted the molecular evolution of sperm. For
example, analysis of the Drosophila sperm proteome
revealed 3 novel sperm genes specific to D. melanogaster
and a further 4 sperm genes created through retrotransposition during Drosophila evolution [12]. Amongst
these is the retrogene CG13340, which encodes S-LAP
7, examined in this study. It is noteworthy that these
new sperm components were found to be proteins
across diverse functional classes, and both rapidly evolving (in the case of protamine genes, Mst35a and
Mst35b) and highly conserved (X-linked Tektin gene
cluster).
Many proteolysis-related genes (including peptidases,
proteases and inhibitors of proteolysis) have reproductive functions across diverse taxa, including insects
[19-21] and mammals [22]. Amongst these, proteolysisrelated genes expressed in the Drosophila accessory
gland have been particularly well studied in terms of
their mediation of a wide range of effects on females
(see [23] for a recent review). Proteins with proteolytic
activity are also found in the Drosophila female reproductive tract and a subset of these are encoded by
recently created genes [24]. In both mammals and Drosophila, the genes involved in reproductive proteolytic

Page 2 of 13

pathways or their targets have been demonstrated to
evolve rapidly [22,25,26] and it is hypothesized that this
is due to coevolutionary forces associated with sexual
conflict (either between males and females or males and
males) [27,28]. These observations have been extended
to the sperm proteome where an intensified signature of
positive selection was observed for membrane and acrosomal sperm proteins that included a diverse set of
metalloproteases and protease inhibitors [29].
Although well documented in reproductive tissues
generally, only recently have proteolytic and related
genes been shown to be present in spermatozoa
[18,29-31]. The functional significance and role in fertilization of these classes of proteins is unknown, but
demonstration of their presence and activity in sperm is
a necessary step towards more targeted studies. Here we
present a detailed evolutionary and functional characterization of a family of eight Drosophila sperm leucyl aminopeptidases that we have termed Sperm-LAPs (S-LAP
1-8). Computational annotation places the S-LAPs in
the M17 family of leucyl aminopeptidases [32]. Of the
10 annotated leucyl aminopeptidases in the Drosophila
genome, the S-LAPs are specifically expressed in the testis and all encode proteins incorporated in mature
sperm [18,33]. Here we describe results of detailed comparative genomic analyses that demonstrate an expansion and diversification of the S-LAP gene family during
Drosophila evolution. We also provide (i) an independent proteomic analysis confirming the presence of SLAPs in sperm, (ii) a biochemical analysis of S-LAPs
quantity and abundance in sperm, (iii) data indicating
that S-LAPs are expressed specifically in the testis and
(iv) evidence confirming S-LAP enzymatic activity supporting their functional annotation. This striking specificity of expression and cellular location suggests an
unknown functional requirement for aminopeptidases in
sperm. Furthermore, evolutionary diversification at the
active site indicates that some S-LAPs have lost enzymatic activity and that the putative neofunctionalization
of these non-enzymatic S-LAPs may be related to the
subsequent expansion of the gene family. These findings
thus support a scenario where functional diversification
within a gene family may promote further evolutionary
changes in gene family composition through the selective retention of newly created genes.

Comparative Genomics of the S-LAP family in Drosophila

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis [34] previously identified
eight related leucylaminopeptidases of the M17 Merops
family with an overall average amino acid identity of
53.7% [18]. We examined their evolutionary relationships by first determining that the annotated aminopeptidase, granny-smith, was the closest related paralog to

Dorus et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/177

the S-LAP gene family (17.4% average amino acid conservation with the S-LAP family). granny-smith has not
been identified in Drosophila sperm [33] and has no
reported function in spermatogenesis or reproduction.
Phylogenetic analysis of D. melanogaster S-LAPs and
granny-smith revealed two distinct S-LAP clusters
(Figure 1a): Cluster I includes S-LAPs 3-8 genes
(CG32063, CG32064, CG18369, loopin, CG13340, and

Page 3 of 13

CG4439, respectively) and Cluster II includes S-LAPs 12 genes (CG6372 and CG32351, respectively). The average synonymous divergence levels amongst the S-LAP
genes (dS = 1.84) indicated that the expansion of the
gene family was not recent in Drosophila evolution. All
pairwise values exceeded 1.1 with the exception of
CG6372/CG32351 (dS = 0.842), a finding consistent
with a more recent gene duplication event resulting in

methods were used to construct the bootstrap consensus protein phylogeny (1000 replicates). Bootstrap values are presented next to relevant
nodes and the phylogeny is drawn to scale based on amino acid substitutions per site. This analysis revealed two related clusters of D.
melanogaster S-LAPS, Cluster I and II. (B) Expanded S-LAP family in Drosophila. Comparative genomic analyses identified a total of 17 related
aminopeptidases in A. gambiae, C. quinquefasciatus, A. aegypti, T. castaneum, A. pisum and A. mellifera. Minimum evolution distance methods
were used to construct the bootstrap consensus protein phylogeny (1000 replicates). Bootstrap values are presented next to relevant nodes and
the phylogeny is drawn to scale based on amino acid substitutions per site. S-LAP Cluster I, comprised of 6 genes in Drosophila, is related to a
single copy aminopeptidase in mosquitos and T. castaneum. Similarly S-LAP Cluster II, comprised of two genes in Drosophila, is related to a
single copy aminopeptidase in other insect taxa with the exception of C. quinquefasciatus where two gene copies are present in the genome. In
contrast, granny-smith has “one-to-one” orthology relationships in other insect taxa.

Cluster II and our phylogenetic analyses (see below). To
further estimate the evolutionary timing of S-LAP gene
family expansion, orthologs were identified using reciprocal “best-hit” blast searches, for each S-LAP in the
12 available Drosophila genomes. This analysis determined that all S-LAPs have unique orthologs in most, if
not all the Drosophila genomes and that all have distinct
orthologs in D. grimshawi, the most ancestrally diverged
Drosophila species for which genomic data is available
(a phylogeny containing all identified Drosophila orthologs is provided in Additional File 1, Figure S1). Therefore, S-LAP gene family expansion either predates or
occurred early in the evolution of the genus Drosophila,
an observation consistent with the observed levels of
synonymous divergence.

T. castaneum. This is consistent with gene family expansion during early Drosophila evolution. Furthermore, no
Cluster I related S-LAP genes were detected in N. vitripennis, A. pisum, B. mori and A. mellifera. The two
more closely related Drosophila members of Cluster II
also form a monophyletic group with single-copy genes
in other insect taxa with the exception of C. quinquefasciatus where two related aminopeptidases were found.
These observations are in contrast to granny-smith that
has “one-to-one” orthology relationships in all taxa
where an ortholog was identified. It is also noteworthy
that our analysis identified a set of seven aminopeptidases in non-Drosophila taxa (Figure 1b) distinct from
either Drosophila S-LAP Cluster I or II. This includes a
single copy aminopeptidase gene across 5 insect taxa
and 2 putative, additional paralogs in A. aegypti.

Related aminopeptidase genes in other insect taxa

A comprehensive search for related aminopeptidases
was conducted in other insect species using reciprocal
blast searches against a dataset combining all annotated
REFSEQ, non-REFSEQ and ab initio gene sequences in
Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes
aegypti, Tribolium castaneum, Nasonia vitripennis,
Acyrthosiphon pisum, Bombyx mori and Apis mellifera.
This resulted in the identification of 17 aminopeptidases
related to the S-LAP family and 6 orthologs of grannysmith. The number of identified S-LAP related aminopeptidase genes varied between taxa, ranging from none
in N. vitripennis to 4 in A. aegypti and A. gambiae.
Copy number determination of related aminopeptidase
genes in each species was also confirmed through the
analysis of genome assembly sequences in each species
(data not shown).
S-LAPs: an expanded gene family in Drosophila

Phylogenetic analysis of the S-LAP gene family, including related aminopeptidases from other taxa, revealed
that S-LAP Cluster I and II are related to single-copy
genes in most insect taxa (Figure 1b). The 6 members
of Cluster I form a monophyletic group with a single
related gene in all 3 mosquito species and the beetle,

Mechanisms of new S-LAP gene creation

The age of S-LAP clusters and the associated sequence
divergence at these loci means that hallmarks associated
with gene duplication mechanisms are often obscured,
making gene duplication mechanisms difficult to infer.
However, two pairs of S-LAPS (S-LAP 1 and 2; S-LAP 3
and 4) are immediately adjacent in the genome and
share common intron/exon structure suggesting they
were created through tandem duplication. S-LAP 7 has
previously been characterized as a retrotransposed gene
[11,12]. Consistent with a retroposition event, S-LAP 7
is intronless, unlike its likely progenitor S-LAP 4, and
these genes reside in different genomic regions (2R:
50C5 and 3L: 67E4, respectively).
S-LAPs are expressed specifically in the testis

Expression of each S-LAP in D. melanogaster was characterized by RT-PCR using gene specific primers.
A high level of testis-specific expression for all eight SLAPs was observed with no detectable expression in
gonadectimized males (Figure 2), a finding consistent
with previous microarray studies [35]. The testis-specific
expression of the S-LAP family is in contrast to grannysmith, the closest related leucyl aminopeptidase in the

Figure 2 S-LAPs are specifically expressed in testis. RT-PCR analysis reveals testis specific expression of the D. melanogaster S-LAPs. Testis
expression is compared to expression in the remainder of the fly using gonadectomized males.

genome, which is expressed broadly across a range of
tissues, including (but not limited to) testis, ovary,
tubule and salivary gland [35].
Confirmation and quantification of S-LAPs in Drosophila
Sperm by 2D-Gel

As part of an exhaustive analysis of sperm proteins from
2D-gels of varying isoelectric gradients, all eight S-LAPs
were identified by both MALDI-TOF and tandem MS/
MS analyses (Figure 3, Table 1). High confidence of
S-LAP protein identification was supported by, (i) multiple peptide assignments for each protein (with an

Page 5 of 13

average of 5.8 peptides per S-LAP protein) as assigned
by Scaffold (Proteome Sciences); (ii) Mowse scores from
Maldi-tof measurements that exceeded statistical scoring
requirements [36] and (iii) replicate spot assignments
from multiple 2D-gels under varying separation conditions (Figure 3). Tubulins were also identified on 2Dgels at the expected molecular weight and isoelectric
point positions (Figure 3).
Visual inspection of 2D-gels clearly indicated that both
the S-LAPs and tubulins represent a substantial proportion of the total protein in sperm on 2D-gels (brackets,
Figure 3). We determined the relative abundance of

Figure 3 Annotation of S-LAPs on 2D gels of purified sperm. Gels were run using duplicate samples of solubilized sperm protein (100 ug/

and tandem MS/MS analyses. The a- and b-tubulins are indicated in (A) at the expected pI and molecular weight positions. Regions of the gel
identified as S-LAPs are indicated by brackets with individual spots circled.

Five 2D-gels (pI range 4-7, Figure 2) were processed,
scanned and protein spot intensities calculated. The
results indicate an approximate 2-fold abundance of SLAPs (Table 2) over tubulins. Thus, we conclude that
the tubulins and the S-LAP family represent the major
mass of protein in sperm.

sperm in buffer alone resulted in measurable S-LAP activity but with low protein yield (Table 3). Addition of DTT
resulted in both higher levels of soluble protein and measurable S-LAP activity but with reduced specific activity
(Table 3). However, while this establishes presence of leucylaminopeptidase activity, the relative contribution of
each S-LAP to the observed signal remains unclear.

S-LAP enzymatic activity in purified sperm

Divergence at cation ligand and catalytic residues

S-LAP activity in sperm extracts was directly measured
using L-Leu-AMC, a sensitive and specific fluorogenic
substrate for leucine aminopeptidase activity [37]. Negligible activity was observed in intact sperm suggesting that
S-LAPs were not exposed on the sperm surface (L-LeuAMC is not permeable to intact cells). Sonication of

Biochemical and x-ray crystallography studies have
defined 7 primary active site residues in M17 leucyl aminopeptidases involved in catalysis and binding of divalent
cations, including a critical Zn 2+ ion binding region
[38,39]. These sites are highly conserved in leucyl aminopeptidases across animal taxa strongly suggesting their

critical role in the coordination of the metal ions, water
and a bicarbonate ion which coordinates a base attack on
the peptide bond followed by breakdown of a tetrahedral
diol intermediate with the terminal amino acid as the leaving group [40]. Intriguingly, the S-LAP active site has
diverged during Drosophila evolution replaced in many
cases by amino acids incapable of Zn2+ binding or bicarbonate coordination (Figure 4). In contrast, granny-smith
contains the canonical active site residues. Furthermore,
differences with likely functional relevance exist between
the active site residues in S-LAP clusters I and II. The two
members of Cluster II retain a high level of amino acid
identity with the M17 aminopeptidase consensus, including i) 3 out of 4 conserved amino acids amongst the tight
Zn2+ binding residues (commonly referred to as “site 2”),
ii) a conservative amino acid substitution (Lys327Gln) to a
known M17 metal ligand amino acid at the fourth site and
iii) a conservative amino acid substitution (Lys409Asp) to
a known M17 metal ligand amino acid which contributes
to divalent cation binding at the “loose” binding site (commonly referred to as “site 1”). This is in contrast to
S-LAPs in Cluster I that possess i) limited or no similarity
to the M17 aminopeptidase consensus and ii) an abundance of substitutions in residues that do not bind metal
ions or are not characterized as M17 LAP metal ion
ligands. Furthermore, 3 of the 6 S-LAPs in Cluster I have
undergone a substitution at Lys339 which is essential for
enzymatic activity [41]. The 7 characterized functional

Purifying selection on the S-LAP gene family

Given the rapid expansion of the S-LAP gene family and
the potential loss of catalytic activity amongst S-LAPs,
we next sought to assess the role of positive selection in
the functional diversification of the S-LAP gene family.
To this end, we conducted codon based maximum likelihood analyses of selection for S-LAP Cluster I and II
using all Drosophila S-LAP orthologs. This analysis
resulted in strong evidence for purifying selection
throughout the S-LAP gene. Analysis of all Cluster 1
sequences (including 68 gene sequences) resulted in a
mean dN/dS estimate of 0.14, significant evidence of
negative selection (p < 0.05) at 455 sites and no codons
showing evidence of being under positive selection. Similarly, analysis of Cluster II (including 18 genes) resulted
in a mean dN/dS estimate of 0.12, significant evidence of
negative selection at 425 sites and no codons showing
evidence of being under positive selection.

Discussion
Advances in comparative genomics have revealed that
the creation of novel genes is a widespread process
[11,42-44] and that the composition of gene families
associated with reproduction can vary dramatically
between species [10]. Often, the expansion of gene
families through gene creation results in functional diversification of gene family members, a process sometimes
associated with rapid evolutionary changes at the DNA
sequence and spatio-temporal expression levels. Furthermore, it has also been well documented that new retrogenes often acquire testis expression, however a limited
amount is known about the specific functional ramifications of these phenomenon. To map specific functional
consequences of gene family evolution, we have utilized
comparative genomics to characterize the dynamic evolutionary history of the S-LAP gene family and documented
S-LAP abundance and activity in spermatozoa.

metal ion binding and catalytic residues is displayed according to the S-LAP phylogeny presented in Figure 1. For cation binding sites, residues
matching the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase consensus are highlighted in red, substitutions to other metal binding amino acids in M17 leucyl

residues, residues matching the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase consensus are highlighted in red and those divergent from the consensus in white.
Amino acid residues Lys327, Asp332, Asp350 and Glu411 comprise the tight, Zn2+-specific binding (site 2), while residue 409 is involved in loose
coordination of divalent cations (site 1).

Gene family expansion and evolution

The recent availability of additional insect genome
sequences has allowed the analysis of gene family evolution as it potentially relates to specific biological characteristics [45]. This approach has been of great utility in
our studies of Drosophila sperm where gene creation
has proven to be a widespread process and potentially a
dynamic force in the molecular evolution of sperm [12].
Comparative genomic analyses of the sperm-specific
S-LAPs in this study further extends this observation
and demonstrates that the S-LAP gene families are
highly heterogeneous in composition across the insect
genomes that have been sequenced to date. This
includes, but is not limited to, a dramatic expansion
during the evolution of Drosophila (especially within
S-LAP Cluster I) and variable copy numbers across three
mosquito species. While some revision of the S-LAP
gene family evolution may result from the availability of
additional insect genomes, these results clearly reiterate
the fundamental importance of gene creation during the
evolution of reproductive traits in Drosophila.
Leucyl aminopeptidases in Drosophila sperm

Aminopeptidases, a large family of related enzymes
found throughout animal and plant kingdoms, have
been described in many reproductive tissues including

sperm and seminal fluids [46-48]. Our results extend
these observations to include a newly recognized family,
S-LAPs 1-8. Other than a role for a GPI-anchored aminopeptidase in the initiation of the acrosome activation
in mussels (Mytilus edulis) [49], little functional data
exists for leucylaminopeptidases either in sperm or
indeed other aspects of reproductive biology. Our results
provide strong circumstantial data suggesting that SLAPs may play an important role in sperm function: (i)
S-LAPs are expressed exclusively during spermatogenesis; (ii) they collectively represent the most abundant
protein class in Drosophila sperm by a 2:1 mass ratio
compared to tubulin (Figure 3; Table 2); (iii) bioinformatic analysis demonstrated S-LAPs as the most significantly over-represented protein domain within the
proteome [33]; and (iv) analysis of stage specific expression during spermatogenesis (i.e. mitotic, meiotic and
post-meiotic) revealed that all 8 S-LAPs were upregulated specifically during the meiotic and post-meiotic
stages of late spermatogenesis (data not shown) [50], the
developmental time window of spermiogenesis and
sperm production. Further, we observed significant
levels of leucyl aminopeptidase activity in both the soluble and insoluble fractions of purified sperm. S-LAP
activity was recovered from the insoluble pellet in the
presence of DTT. Furthermore, the two fractions

Dorus et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/177

differed in specific activities perhaps reflecting a partition of different S-LAPs that may be directly related to
functional diversification between them (see below).
In contrast to the rapid evolution often observed in
genes associated with male reproduction, we observe a
strong signal of purifying selection across all S-LAPs
suggesting a constrained functional role in sperm. This
conservation is intriguing given that each cluster displays distinct patterns of substitutions at the active site
consistent with functional diversification. Cluster I has
undergone radical amino acid replacements in many of
the canonical active site residues and all model studies
of this class of enzyme suggest that these substitutions
would be likely to render the catalytic site inactive. This
observation, in conjunction with the evolutionary conservation (presumably due to functional constraint) of
Cluster I, suggests the possible evolutionary acquisition
of important functions independent of enzymatic activity. Comparison of Cluster I active site residues in Drosophila and mosquito reveals that most active site
substitutions occurred prior to the evolutionary expansion of Cluster I, indicating that the Cluster I progenitor
gene had potentially lost enzymatic activity prior to the
expansion of this cluster (Figure 4). Future studies are
needed to determine if the mosquito orthologs of Cluster I also function specifically in sperm.
In contrast, Cluster II S-LAPs more closely match the
canonical M17 aminopeptidase active site and are likely
to account for the enzymatic activity in purified sperm
quantified in this study. The amino acid substitution
(Arg413Val) in the catalytic site occurs at a residue not
strictly required for enzymatic activity but instead is
expected to decrease activity by 10 to 100-fold based on
previous biochemical studies [51,52]. Inspection of the
mosquito Cluster II active sites indicates that this substitution occurred more recently during Drosophila evolution. The other catalytic site, residue Lys339, is strictly
conserved and has been shown essential for catalytic
activity [41]. It is possible that the CG6372/CG32351
duplication event may have partially restored levels of
enzymatic activity lost as a result of the Arg413Val substitution. Quantification of specific activity for each SLAP is the next necessary step in assessing the functional diversification of the gene family.

Conclusions
The presence of eight distinct S-LAPs and their extraordinarily high protein concentration in sperm strongly
suggests that S-LAPs play a predominant (as yet
unknown) role in Drosophila sperm biology. However,
our results suggest that this role (or roles) cannot be
linked to enzymatic activity in Cluster I S-LAPs where
the canonical active site is clearly absent. An outstanding
question therefore remains: what is the acquired

Page 9 of 13

functionality of Cluster I S-LAPs? One testable possibility
is that Cluster I S-LAPs lost enzymatic activity but were
retained, and subsequently diversified, following the
acquisition of a structural function in sperm. While such
a scenario for sperm protein evolution is unprecedented,
it has been well documented in other enzyme families
such as the crystallin family of lens proteins that evolved
from ubiquitously expressed metabolic enzymes
(reviewed in [53]). Although the precise evolutionary processes leading to the neofunctionalization of the crystallins are unknown, it did include the loss of enzymatic
activity due to substitutions at critical active site residues,
the expression of proteins at high concentrations and the
subsequent establishment of their current structural and
refractive roles in the eye lens [53]. It is noteworthy that
the S-LAPs share extensive sequence homology (>40% at
the amino acid level) to the bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (data not shown). It will be of great interest to
determine if, and to what extent, these two independent
evolutionary processes parallel one another. Regardless,
the S-LAP gene family represents a unique example
wherein loss of function (and the presumed gain of a
novel function) predates the dramatic expansion of a
gene family. As such, neofunctionalization may itself lead
to a situation where gene family expansion is selectively
favorable, an observation that complements the general
model where gene duplication predates and facilitates the
evolution of novel functionality. Finally, in recent years
characterized functions of LAPs have expanded to
include a range of other cellular processes (e.g., transcriptional regulation, site-specific recombination and meiosis;
reviewed in [54]). It will be of considerable interest to
investigate whether S-LAPs have similarly acquired diversified roles in sperm function and physiology.

Methods
Comparative genomic analysis of the S-LAP family

BlastN was utilized to identify the closest paralog of the
S-LAP gene family (Additional File 3), granny-smith,
amongst annotated D. melanogaster genes and confirmed
by estimates of synonymous divergence (dS). S-LAP
orthology amongst Drosophila species was determined
using reciprocal “best-hit” blastP against all annotated
Drosophila proteins and was found to be consistent with
current orthology annotation tables (http://flybase.org/).
Identification of aminopeptidase genes related to the SLAPs in other insects was conducted using a reciprocal
blast approach where the eight S-LAPs were first compared to a combined database of RefSeq, non-RefSeq and
ab initio coding sequences from A. gambiae, C. quinquefasciatus, A. aegypti, T. castaneum, N. vitripennis, A.
pisum and A. mellifera using Tblastx. The second, reciprocal search compared all matches from the first search
to all annotated D. melanogaster genes. Those that best

Dorus et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/177

matched members of the S-LAP family (in any order)
were kept for further analysis. The same procedure was
used to identify orthologs of S-LAP paralog, grannysmith. Concordant results, including a consistent estimate of S-LAP related gene copy number in each insect
genome, were obtained using TblastN against the whole
genome assembly for each species.
Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis

Alignments were conducted using CLUSTALW and phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the Minimum
Evolution Method as implemented by MEGA4 [55]. The
bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is
taken to represent the evolutionary history. Distances
were calculated as the number of amino acid substitutions per site using the Poisson correction method. Consistent phylogenies were obtained using Bayesian
phylogenetic methods [56]. Synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) levels of divergence were estimated from
“in-frame” CLUSTALW nucleotide alignments using the
method of Nei and Gojobori [57]. Codon based analyses
of selection were conducted using maximum-likelihood
methods as implemented by HyPhy [58].
RT-PCR analysis

Male carcasses (minus gonads) and testes were dissected, washed (3x) in phosphate buffered saline and
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was then isolated using manufacturer’s protocols (Ambion195 RNAqueous Kit), and RNA was suspended in TE and
quantified. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was carried
out by standard protocols (Promega Improm-II Reverse
Transcription System) using 75-ng input RNA (final
concentration 3.75 ng/ul) from whole males (minus
gonads) and testis. Gene-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used to amplify each S-LAP
transcript from equal quantities of cDNA from the
whole fly (minus gonads) and testis. Primer sequences
are provided in Additional file 4. Equal volumes of each
PCR reaction were visualized on 1% agarose gels.
Sperm sample preparation and protein quantification

D. melanogaster sperm purified from Tempe-T strain
males was solubilized over night at 25°C in CHAPS buffer containing 7 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 33
mM DTT and 2.5 mM TCEP). The solubilized protein
was separated from insoluble aggregates by ultracentrifugation, using a Beckmann-Coulter TL-100 and a TLA
100.2 fixed angle rotor for 30 min, 88,760 × g at 17°C.
The supernatant was transferred in a new tube and
stored at -80°C. Protein quantitation was measured
using the RediPlate Protein Quantitation Kit (Molecular
Probes) and calibration curves as per manufacturers
instructions and fluorescence signals determined using a

Page 10 of 13

Fuji Laser Scanner FLA5000. Protein values were calculated using the Aida 2D-Densitometry software (Raytest,
Straubenhardt, Germany).
Protein precipitation for 2D gel electrophoresis

Sperm extracts were precipitated with 100% ice cold
TCA (Sigma) at a final concentration of 20%. Following
a 10 min incubation on ice, precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation for 5 min, 16 000 × g at 4°C.
The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was
washed three times with ice-cold acetone. After removing the acetone by a brief incubation at 37°C, the pellet
was suspended in CHAPS buffer.
2D-Gel electrophoresis

The Multiphor II system from GE Healthcare was used
for isoelectric focusing and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following the manufacturers guidelines.
Immobiline DryStrip gels 11 cm (pH 4-7, 6-11) and
24 cm (3-10NL) and precast 12.5% homogenous SDS gels
were purchased from GE Healthcare. Immobiline Dry
strip gels were rehydrated overnight in rehydration buffer
(200 ml for 11 cm and 450 ml for 24 cm) containing 7 M
Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 18 mM DTT, 0.5% IPG
buffer. pH4-7 and 3-10 NL Immobiline Dry strip gels
were hydrated directly with the protein sample in rehydration buffer. Isoelectric focusing was performed at
20°C using the following 3-phase run parameters (upper
limits for current and power were set to 2 mA and 2 W,
respectively): phase 1, 300 V for 1 volt-hour (Vh); phase
2, a linear voltage increase to 3500 V over 2900 Vh;
phase 3, constant 3500 V for 9.1 kVh (pH4-7) or 6.1 kVh
(pH6-11). The isoelectric focusing protocol for the 24 cm
3-10NL; phase 1, 500 V for 1 Vh; phase 2, linear voltage
increase to 3500 V over 3000 Vh; phase 3, constant 3500
V for 57 kVh. The strips were either frozen at -80°C or
used immediately for second dimension gel electrophoresis. Before SDS gel electrophoresis strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mM Tris pH 8.8, 6 M Urea, 30%
Glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.002% bromphenolblue and 65 mM
DTT to reduce disulfide bonds. A second equilibration
step using the same reagents as above, but the DTT was
replaced with 135 mM iodoacetamide. Iodoacteamide
alkylates thiol groups prevents oxidation during electrophoresis. The Immobiline DryStrip gel was then transferred gel side down onto the SDS polyacrylamide gel.
Gels were washed overnight in a 40% ethanol/10% acetic
acid fixation solution. Proteins were visualized using
Phastgel Blue Coomassie R350 (GE Healthcare) following
manufacturer protocol.
Mass spectrometry identification of S-LAPs

Eight S-LAPs were previously identified in the Drosophila sperm proteome by high throughput tandem

Dorus et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/177

mass spectrometry of whole sperm digests [18] and
confirmed in a recent shotgun proteomic analysis [33].
The 2D-gel migration patterns of all eight S-LAPs
were determined in an exhaustive study that identified
the molecular identity of >80 major protein spots (U.
Gerike and TLK, unpublished). Spots were excised
from the gel and transferred into Microtiter plates,
destained and digested using the Ettan Digester (GE
Healthcare). The proteins were digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at 20 ng trypsin/ug
sperm protein according to the manufacturers protocol. The resulting peptide mixtures were mixed with a
saturated solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid
in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, spotted
and dried prior to analysis. Peptide masses were determined using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer
(Micromass) running in linear mode. These results
were further validated using tandem mass spectrometry
(Orbitrap, Thermo Inc.). Peptides, prepared as
described above, were subjected to tandem MS/MS
and spectra analyzed using Scaffold (v2.02, Proteome
Software, Portland, Oregon, USA). Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at
greater than 95.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm [59] and at least two tryptic
peptides were detected. The average number of peptides identified per S-LAP protein was 5.8.
Analyzing the MALDI TOF results

The Mowse scoring algorithm in a probabilistic framework of the Mascot Peptide Mass Fingerprint software
(Matrix Science) was used as search tool. The search
criteria were as follows: database - MSDB; organism Drosophila; protease - Trypsin; fixed modification, Carbamidomethyl; variable modification - Oxidation (M);
mass accuracy - 100 ppm and 0 missed cleavages.
Relative protein quantification of gel spots

Three coomassie stained 2D-gels from D. melanogaster
sperm in the pH 4-7 were scanned using FLA-5000
phosphoimager in digital mode and using a 472 nm
excitation filter. Relative spot intensities were measured
using version 3.23 of the AIDA 2D densitometry software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The LAU (light
absorbing units) were determined for each spot with
background correction.
Protein extraction and S-LAP activity assays

Sperm from 25 males of flies were incubated for 1 h at
25°C in 500 ml buffer A (50 mM HEPES pH7.4, 1 mM
MnCl2, 67.5 mM DTT). Sperm was then broken up by
sonication (~6s on ice) and the sample centrifuged 30
min at 16 000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred

Page 11 of 13

to a new tube. The incubation mixture contained (in a
total of 3 ml): 50 mM HEPES pH7.4, 1 mM MnCl2,
11.5 mM DTT and 100 mM L-Leu-AMC [Sigma]. SLAP activity was determined by measuring the increase
in fluorescence emission at 460 nm (340 nm excitation)
using a Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B (Perkin
Elmer). The reaction was started by the addition of the
sperm extract. To calculate the units of activity a calibration curve was performed with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin [Sigma] in the range 0-7 nmol.
