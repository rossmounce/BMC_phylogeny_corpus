Screening synteny blocks in pairwise genome
comparisons through integer programming

Abstract
Background: It is difficult to accurately interpret chromosomal correspondences such as true orthology and
paralogy due to significant divergence of genomes from a common ancestor. Analyses are particularly problematic
among lineages that have repeatedly experienced whole genome duplication (WGD) events. To compare multiple
“subgenomes” derived from genome duplications, we need to relax the traditional requirements of “one-to-one”
syntenic matchings of genomic regions in order to reflect “one-to-many” or more generally “many-to-many”
matchings. However this relaxation may result in the identification of synteny blocks that are derived from ancient
shared WGDs that are not of interest. For many downstream analyses, we need to eliminate weak, low scoring
alignments from pairwise genome comparisons. Our goal is to objectively select subset of synteny blocks whose
total scores are maximized while respecting the duplication history of the genomes in comparison. We call this
“quota-based” screening of synteny blocks in order to appropriately fill a quota of syntenic relationships within one
genome or between two genomes having WGD events.
Results: We have formulated the synteny block screening as an optimization problem known as “Binary Integer
Programming” (BIP), which is solved using existing linear programming solvers. The computer program QUOTAALIGN performs this task by creating a clear objective function that maximizes the compatible set of synteny
blocks under given constraints on overlaps and depths (corresponding to the duplication history in respective
genomes). Such a procedure is useful for any pairwise synteny alignments, but is most useful in lineages affected
by multiple WGDs, like plants or fish lineages. For example, there should be a 1:2 ploidy relationship between
genome A and B if genome B had an independent WGD subsequent to the divergence of the two genomes. We
show through simulations and real examples using plant genomes in the rosid superorder that the quota-based
screening can eliminate ambiguous synteny blocks and focus on specific genomic evolutionary events, like the
divergence of lineages (in cross-species comparisons) and the most recent WGD (in self comparisons).
Conclusions: The QUOTA-ALIGN algorithm screens a set of synteny blocks to retain only those compatible with a
user specified ploidy relationship between two genomes. These blocks, in turn, may be used for additional
downstream analyses such as identifying true orthologous regions in interspecific comparisons. There are two
major contributions of QUOTA-ALIGN: 1) reducing the block screening task to a BIP problem, which is novel; 2)
providing an efficient software pipeline starting from all-against-all BLAST to the screened synteny blocks with dot
plot visualizations. Python codes and full documentations are publicly available http://github.com/tanghaibao/

genomevolution.com/CoGe/SynMap.pl, offering easier access to thousands of genomes for non-programmers.

Background
Many eukaryotic lineages have experienced whole genome duplication (WGD) events, including fungi [1], animals [2,3] and especially flowering plants, where WGDs
are prevalent [4-6]. Over evolutionary time, evidence of
WGDs is obscured by loss of duplicate genes, gene movement and genome rearrangements. Unequal evolutionary
rates for different lineages and gene families further complicate this problem, making phylogenetic inferences
from distributions of pairwise distances between paralogous genes difficult and occasionally leading to erroneous
findings. Conservation of collinear gene order (or “synteny”) is less subject than sequence conservation to difficulties with phylogenetic inference, and is the basis for
the discovery and dating of ancient genomic events
where whole genome sequence is available [6,7].
A typical pipeline for genome structure comparison
starts with the enumeration of “synteny blocks” regions of chromosomes between two or more input
genomes that shared a common order of homologous
genes and are therefore inferred to be derived from a
common ancestor. Synteny blocks are often viewed as
“diagonals” on a syntenic dot plot, where dots represent
putative homologous gene pairs or marker pairs as
inferred by sequence similarity (Figure 1).
WGDs can present a major challenge for accurately
attributing synteny blocks to different evolutionary origins, especially when there are multiple sequential WGD
events. In particular, some WGDs may be species-specific and others shared by multiple species (i.e. the polyploidy occurred before their lineages diverged). In order
to automate the classification of different evolutionary
origins for sets of syntenic blocks in lineages with a history of WGDs, it is essential to identify the relative ages
of the WGDs and their placement relative to the divergence of the genomes being compared before performing in-depth analyses (see an example in Figure 1).
Current softwares to identify synteny blocks often uses
chaining or clustering of putative homologous gene
pairs [4,8-10]. It is common to then use custom
schemes to score each block and apply a cutoff [8,11].
Existing methods do not differentiate the evolutionary
origin and age of these synteny blocks. However, specification of identity and age is crucial for any downstream
evolutionary analysis. These software packages for identifying syntenic blocks will identify some blocks that are
derived from shared, ancient whole genome duplications
as well as false syntenic regions created by repeats and
local gene duplications, creating ambiguity in the identification of true syntenic orthologs.
Methods that find syntenic regions between vertebrate
genomes often rely on “best-in-genome” (or “one-toone” reciprocal best) criteria [12] in order to remove
noise from the exhaustive enumeration of synteny

undergone shared ancient WGD events. In this example, the
synteny plot is between A. lyrata scaffold 1 (x-axis) and A. thaliana
chromosome 1 (y-axis). Gray dots represent putative homologous
gene pairs, and syntenic gene pairs are plotted with color based on
their Ks values. Two significant patterns of synteny are evident. First,
these genomes have syntenic regions identified by cyan color that
are derived from the divergence of these two taxa, or orthologous
blocks. Second, there are smaller magenta-colored synteny blocks
that are derived from their shared WGD event and therefore older
than orthologous blocks. We observe that these smaller, older
blocks overlap with orthologous blocks along one or both of the
genomes, which can be used as the basis for screening.

blocks. This is not appropriate when studying plant or
other genomes affected by multiple rounds of polyploidy. The orthologous blocks between two genomes
under WGD scenarios can be one-to-many, or many-tomany depending on when the WGD(s) occurred in the
evolutionary history of one or both lineages.
There have been ad-hoc rules in pairwise comparisons
to extract synteny blocks under the influence of WGDs.
For example, approaches that find “Doubly Conserved
Syntenies” (DCS) were extensively used in yeast [1] and
fish [3] genomes. The DCS method attempts to find 2
chromosomal regions that both match the same single
region in the outgroup. However, it is only designed to
work with the 2-to-1 case and does not deal with hexaploidy, double tetraploidy, or more general n-fold polyploidy. Additionally, the DCS method still relies on adhoc rules to classify the 2:1 pattern. Without an explicit
optimization objective, the DCS method is not fully
reproducible. DCS also requires the sequence of an
unduplicated outgroup species, a resource not available
in many cases.
To generalize the concept behind DCS, we observe
that when aligning two genomes with known polyploidy
events in one or both lineages, we often have expectations for the number of subgenomes, or “multiplication

Tang et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:102
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/102

level”, or “depths” [6,7,13,14]. Such a priori information
can be used as a guide to screen synteny blocks. If we
set up an upper bound ("quota”) for the expected number of subgenomes, the synteny blocks will then “compete” for the specified depths and the identification of
synteny blocks will then be selective, excluding weaker
matches that are more ancient or simply artifacts. As
more flowering plant lineages with complicated polyploidy histories are sequenced, tools to automate the
identification of synteny blocks with known evolutionary
origins will become valuable to a wider range of
researchers.
The algorithm we present here, called QUOTAALIGN, is a method that screens synteny blocks based
on the expected number of subgenomes, effectively
eliminating more ancient (weaker) or spurious alignments. In its simplest usage, a quota of 1:1 between genomes of different species corresponds to orthologous
blocks in the traditional sense, i.e. neither of the genomes have duplicated since their divergence (e.g.
between two mammalian genomes) and will contain an
approximately 1:1 syntenic mapping of genomic regions.
In QUOTA-ALIGN, the quota constraint is generalized
to Q X :Q Y in order to handle lineages with different
duplication histories, a case found frequently in flowering plant lineages.
The quota-based screening of synteny blocks is a difficult problem because the goal is to simultaneously maximize synteny blocks’ scores on both the x-axis and yaxis in a dot plot [15], where simple sorting along any
one axis will not necessarily be optimal on the other
axis. Even in the case of 1:1 quota, the problem is
known to be NP-hard [15]. Herein, we show that it is
possible to translate the problem into “Binary Integer
Programming” (BIP), which is well-studied and has efficient software implementations. After converting to a
BIP problem and solving it, QUOTA-ALIGN produces
cleaner sets of synteny blocks and eliminates most
ambiguous matches.

treated as one chromosome. Additionally, we simulated
the following mutational events for a total of N steps: 1)
macro-inversions - two breakpoints are randomly
selected and the intervening chromosome segment is
flipped; 2) gene losses - a randomly chosen gene symbol
is deleted from the genome. At each step, we set the
two mutation events to have different probabilities of
occurring Pinversion and Ploss, or staying unchanged. True
homologous gene pairs between genomes A and B are
tracked throughout the simulation and are used as a
“gold standard” to evaluate the pairs recovered by
QUOTA-ALIGN. Formally, the recovery rate of true
homologs can be calculated:
Recovery Rate =

| inferred homologs ∩ true homologs |
| true homologs |

We set N = 20000 and vary P loss and P inversion , to
investigate whether QUOTA-ALIGN is robust against
different levels of genomic mutations. Since we know a
priori that the quota ratio is 2:3, we used this information to screen the synteny blocks. With this simple
simulation, we find that both gene losses and inversions
affect the accuracy of QUOTA-ALIGN. While inversions have a slightly larger impact on the recovery rate
of true homologs (Table 1), the recovery rate never
drops below 80% for large probabilities of P inversion
(0.02) and Ploss (0.9).
Estimating quota ratios

Selection of the quota ratio to use in comparisons of
real genomes requires knowledge of the duplication histories of both species. For the identification of purely
orthologous blocks between two genomes, X and Y, the
first value of the quota ratio is the product of all polyploidy events unique to the X lineage since its divergence from the common ancestor of X and Y, and the
second value is the product of all polyploidy events
unique to the Y lineage. The quota ratio can be better
understood with known polyploidy events mapped onto
the species tree (Figure 2).

Simulations

For the first test, we simulated genome evolution in
silico, and tested whether QUOTA-ALIGN is capable of
recovering true orthologous anchors between two genomes under the influence of genomic rearrangement
events. We start with two genomes A and B with the
same gene content x1 ... xn where genes xi ≠ xj for all 1
≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j - and simulate evolving genomes as
signed permutations of gene symbols. Next, we simulated polyploidy events in both genomes such that genome A receives a duplication (×2), and genome B
receives a triplication (×3). Effectively, each whole genome gets k copies (k = 2 or 3) that is concatenated and

Figure 2 Phylogeny for the rosid genomes used as test cases
in this study, with known ancient WGDs marked on the
branches. Phylogeny of rosid genomes with circles denoting
polyploidy events. a, b and r: tetraploidies; g: hexaploidy. The quota
displayed in the table are in the form of QX:QY, where QX is the
expected multiplication level for the genome on the top of the
table, and QY is the expected multiplication level for the genome
on the right.

These genomes were selected to showcase the various
genome comparisons that can benefit from quota-based
screening. All four rosid genomes share a common genome triplication event called g, and in some individual
lineages there are subsequent genome doubling events [7].
Two exemplar cases are provided for screening orthologous and paralogous blocks, illustrating both “one-to-one”
and “multiple-to-multiple” scenarios. Although examples
are taken from plant genome comparisons, the algorithm
in QUOTA-ALIGN is generic and is not limited to plant
genomes. Finally, the plant genomes that are used in this
study were downloaded from Phytozome http://www.phytozome.net, and all analysis results can be reproduced in
the CoGe comparative genomics platform using its tool,
SynMap (Table 2).
Example 1: Orthologous blocks between A. thaliana and A.
lyrata (quota 1:1)

For finding orthologous blocks between A. thaliana and A.
lyrata (available http://www.phytozome.net/alyrata), we
first note that there are no genome duplications since
their divergence (Figure 2), and therefore we need to
enforce the quota ratio of 1:1 to identify orthologous syntenic blocks. The noise for this analysis is due to synteny
blocks derived from shared WGDs prior to their divergence (Figure 2). Before quota screening, a total of 688 linear constraints are identified in this problem. After the 1:1
screening, most synteny blocks from the older WGDs are
rejected as weaker matches (see an example for chromosome pair A. thaliana chromosome 1 vs. A. lyrata scaffold
1 in Figure 1) identifying 69 putatively orthologous syntenic blocks. As an independent validation, there were originally two major peaks in the Ks distribution and the
older Ks peak (that correspond to the older WGD events)
disappeared after the screening (Figure 3A).

QUOTA-ALIGN can be used to identify paralogous
syntenic blocks in addition to orthologous blocks. To
identify paralogous blocks, the first and second values of
the quota ratio are both multiplied by the product of
one or more shared polyploidy events in the common
ancestor of X and Y. To identify paralogous syntenic
blocks within a single genome, both values of the quota
ratio are the expected multiplication level minus 1 (to
account for the self-self match). If the most recent polyploidy within a lineage is genome doubling, every genomic region will match one other region within the same
genome (excluding the self-self match), therefore the
expected quota is 1:1. If the most recent polyploid event
is a genome triplication, every genomic region will
match two other regions within the same genome, giving a quota ratio of 2:2.

Example 2: Orthologous blocks between arabidopsis (A.
thaliana) and poplar (P. trichocarpa) (quota 4:2)

Applications to real data

Example 3: Arabidopsis duplicated blocks (quota 1:1)

We performed comparisons among four rosid genomes
with a known phylogeny and polyploidy history (Figure 2).

Arabidopsis has undergone three WGD events and
traces of these events are evident on the arabidopsis-

Comparison of A. thaliana and poplar illustrates a “multiple-to-multiple” case, i.e. where both genomes have
experienced duplications since their divergence (Figure
2). We know a priori that A. thaliana had 2 sequential
tetraploidies, while poplar had 1 tetraploidy since diverging from their most recent common ancestor; therefore
the expected quota is 4 (22) A. thaliana regions to 2 (21)
poplar regions. After 4:2 screening, relics of older WGD
events (g) in their shared lineage are removed, and only
putative orthologous blocks are retained. Compared to
Example 1, the higher quota ratio (4:2) in this example
represents a much looser constraint. Therefore more
blocks are kept, as also reflected in the smaller number
of constraints - in this example there are a total of 1084
variables, but only 326 constraints.

arabidopsis dot plot [4] (Figure 2). The synteny blocks, if
unscreened, will include both recent duplicates (a event)
and older duplicates (b and g event), which are difficult
to differentiate. Bowers et al. (2003) manually curated a
list of arabidopsis blocks involved in the most recent
duplication (a event) (Figure 2), applying an implicit
rule to always use the higher scoring synteny segments
when two synteny segments are conflicting [4]. With
QUOTA-ALIGN, we formulate this rule more explicitly
by specifying our quota 1:1 when finding synteny blocks

within the arabidopsis genome. The final problem contains 440 variables and 152 constraints. The final blocks
we find are mostly consistent with Bowers’ manually
identified blocks and are in agreement with 94% of
Bowers’ data (3581 out of 3822 total pairs). However,
QUOTA-ALIGN discovered an additional 1153 gene
pairs that were missed in Bowers’ data. We further note
that some of our additional gene pairs are microRNA
genes that were only recently added to the latest Arabidopsis annotation after Bowers’ study. In addition, we

found two small alpha syntenic blocks that were entirely
missed in Bowers’ curated set of duplicates.

Comparison of quota-based with divergence-based
screening

Example 4: Grape triplicated blocks (quota 2:2)

As discussed above, most existing methods for screening
syntenic blocks are based on ad-hoc rules. Some previous method uses frequency of synonymous substitutions (Ks) between syntenic gene pairs to differentiate
the age of the blocks [16,17]. Ks-based methods are not
always effective for distinguishing synteny blocks from
different events because: 1) Ks-based screening is contingent on multiple genomic events that are separable
on the Ks distribution; 2) even in cases where different
events are separable, Ks-based screening still involves an
arbitrary cut-off that best separates different events.
This is further complicated by large variations of Ks distributions derived from a single event, temporally continuous gene duplications, and limited resolution of Ks
rate estimates over long evolutionary distances.
In contrast, QUOTA-ALIGN seeks to maximize the
coverage (reflected by the block range) as well as divergence (reflected by the block score). This assumption
complements the approach of using Ks values as the
proxies of age of the blocks. For example, the Ks distribution for A. thaliana - A. lyrata (Example 1) clearly
shows multiple peaks and a cutoff value at Ks ~0.5 can
be applied in order to select only the orthologous gene
pairs that are at lower Ks range (Figure 3A). In contrast,
for the arabidopsis - poplar comparison (Example 2),
the peak in the Ks distribution contains a mixture of
orthologous and out-paralogous (derived from more
ancient WGDs) gene pairs, with no conspicuous “saddle” point to be used as cut-off to select only orthologous blocks (Figure 3B). In summary, Ks is less effective
at discriminating older evolutionary events when they
occurred close together in divergence time, or a very
long time ago, when synonymous substitutions saturate.

The grapevine genome contains many triplet sets of syntenic regions, suggesting its genome is derived from a
triplication (also known as the g event) [4,5] (Figure 2).
Therefore, for each grape region, there are two additional matching grape regions and so we enforce a
quota of 2:2 in QUOTA-ALIGN. The g event is the only
known polyploidy event in the grape lineage, and has
very few overlapping blocks. The problem contains 270
variables and only 12 constraints.
Results from the four examples are summarized in
Table 2. Following the quota-based screening, the
retained blocks conform more closely to expected ratios.
Before the screening, there are many overlapping synteny blocks that exceed the expected ratio, ranging from
9% to 76% of the total blocks. After the screening, in all
four examples there are fewer than 5% of the genomic
regions that exceed the given quota. There are still
minimal overlaps after the screening, because of the
relaxation of “strict overlapping” with the Nm parameter
(see Methods).

Discussion
Choice of quota

Selecting an appropriate quota ratio represents the single most important parameter affecting the outcome of
screening syntenic regions. A loose quota (ploidy level
set too high) imposes fewer constraints on overlapping
syntenic blocks and leads to incomplete screening. An
overly stringent (too low) quota, on the other hand,
might accidentally remove some relevant synteny blocks,
resulting in over-screening. Currently, the user must
specify the quota ratio used by QUOTA-ALIGN; therefore the user must know a priori the polyploidy history
of the genomes to be compared.
In cases where the polyploidy history is unknown, one
strategy is to use different quota ratios (e.g. starting with
1:1, then 1:2, 2:1, etc.) to screen the synteny blocks and
then inspect the dot plot to see if major features are
included. To aid the user in selecting the quota correctly, QUOTA-ALIGN reports statistics on coverage
that can be used by the user to validate the choice of
quota. For example, in the sorghum-maize comparison,
where maize has a WGD following the divergence of
their lineages, a quota ratio of 1:2 should be used. Using
a ratio of 1:1 instead only aligns 63% of the maize genome, this low percentage indicates that the user is likely
missing one duplicated subgenome. Another helpful tip
is to color syntenic gene pairs based on their Ks values
(Figure 1). Such visualization can quickly identify shared
or independent WGD events, and identify syntenic
regions of varied ages.

Studying genome rearrangement events

With the GRIMM algorithm [18] and its web-based
interface, we can analyze the possible rearrangement
scenario between two genomes in an automated fashion.
GRIMM calculates the number of inversions, translocations, chromosome fusions and fissions under a most
parsimonious scenario. We further note that such rearrangement analysis is only possible with our screening
of synteny blocks since the inclusion of blocks from
more ancient genome duplications will confound the
actual block order.
For example, with QUOTA-ALIGN, we found that
there are 69 synteny blocks between A. lyrata and A.
thaliana (Example 1 in Results). One most parsimonious solution to transform the order of these 69 blocks
in A. lyrata to the order in A. thaliana involves 34 steps
-4 chromosome fusions, 3 translocations and 27 inversions. Previous results based on the genetic map

Tang et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:102
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/102

between A. lyrata and A. thaliana suggested fewer steps:
3 fusions, 2 translocations and 5 inversions [19]. Clearly
the genome sequences offer higher resolutions than
marker-based genetic maps, especially for finding small
inversions. However, the higher number of rearrangements suggested by QUOTA-ALIGN might also be due
to relative incompleteness of the current A. lyrata genome assembly. For example, the additional fusion event
suggested by QUOTA-ALIGN appears to be caused by
two large scaffolds that failed to join in the genome
assembly.
One limitation of GRIMM is that it can only solve
non-duplicated blocks. The reason for this is that the
reconstruction of rearrangement history involving duplicated blocks is difficult algorithmic problem known as
the “genome halving” for tetraploid genomes, or “genome aliquoting” for n-fold polyploid genomes [20].
These problems remain open and are only solved under
strict assumptions. As such, the rearrangement analysis
for ratios different than 1:1 is currently not supported in
QUOTA-ALIGN.
Scalability

Since the binary integer programming is NP-hard, the
worst-case execution time increases exponentially with
larger problem size. The size of the integer programming problem is determined by the number of binary
variables (n) and constraints (m). However, due to the
branch-and-bound and other heuristics employed by the
solvers, the average running time is often dependent on
the structure of particular data and not entirely predictable. We typically screen <1000 synteny blocks with the
integer solver taking at most a few seconds to solve on
a single-threaded 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon CPU. In all examples used in the Results, the screening step was able to
finish within 1 second (Table 2).
QUOTA-ALIGN can also handle the Multiple Alignment Format (MAF) which is often the direct output
from BLASTZ/LASTZ [21]. This allows us to perform
synteny block selection on the nucleotide alignment
blocks as well. However, it is not yet scalable for the solver to solve the problem instance except for small genomes or chromosome pairs, since BLASTZ output
between two large genomes are typically on the order of
~100,000 blocks even after chaining (Kent, et al., 2003),
which is prohibitively expensive for integer programming solvers on current computers.
We need to point out that the scalability issue is
dependent on the integer solver that we used. We rely
on open-source integer solvers (SCIP and GLPK) in our
program, but faster commercial solvers (e.g. CPLEX or
GUROBI) could be used when available with only minor
modifications to the linear programming interface in
QUOTA-ALIGN. Furthermore, when an exact method

Page 7 of 11

is too costly, approximate methods could be applied for
dealing with large number of synteny blocks and
constraints.

Conclusions
Synteny identification and attribution to specific genomic events in an automated fashion remains a nontrivial
task [22]. QUOTA-ALIGN solves the problem of selecting a subset of synteny blocks by using the expected
quota known a priori from the inferred occurrences of
past WGD events. This permits the user to identify subset of synteny blocks more relevant to a specific evolutionary event (e.g. species divergence or genome
duplications). Quota-based screening is a good alternative to the Ks-based classification methods and is always
superior when multiple genomic events cannot be distinguished by Ks.
Methods
Here we describe the pipeline for identifying QX:QY constrained quota depths. Briefly, we generate putative
homologous anchors in two input genomes, group them
into synteny blocks and screen the blocks based on the
given constraints. We describe each step in further
details, with an illustrative diagram for each individual
step in Figure 4. We further note that our pipeline is
modular in design so that at each step, the built-in algorithm can be replaced by other software with the appropriate format.
Chaining synteny anchors to generate all syntenic blocks

First, the anchors (gene or marker pairs that show
sequence similarities) can be generated by sequence
alignment software like BLAST [23] or BLASTZ [21]
based on all-against-all comparison between gene
sequences of genome X and genome Y. Local gene
duplicates and matches to multiple alternative splicing
isoforms of the same gene are removed before chaining.
Multiple models tend to place heavier weights on only a
few genes and produce artifacts. The weight associated
with each anchor reflects the similarity level for the
match. We often use a scoring scheme for BLAST
matches that transform the E-value to a score between
0 and 50, S = min (50, -log(E-value)), but other empirical scoring schemes are accepted. The sum of the
weights of the anchors represents the weight of the synteny blocks: these weights are used in the screening of
blocks.
QUOTA-ALIGN contains a general chaining algorithm to group the anchors into synteny blocks, similar
to the idea used in GRIMM-synteny [18]. We make no
distinction between the input data that are point types
(x-position, y-position), or interval types (x-start, x-stop,
y-start, y-stop), since we consider point anchors as

degenerate interval anchors, only with the same start and
stop. When two genomes under comparison are laid out
on a 2D dot plot, the interval anchors represent rectangles on the synteny plot. The chaining algorithm then
merges all “adjacent” rectangles up to a certain threshold
distance D m . To simplify the implementation, we first
expand the endpoints for all our blocks by D m (Figure
5A). This converts the problem from finding “adjacent”
to “overlapping” blocks, for which there is an efficient
sweep line algorithm described by Six and Wood [24].

Identification of 1D-overlapping syntenic blocks to find
conflicts

With genome duplications, synteny blocks that are distinct on the 2D synteny plot might still overlap in their
projections onto the 1D axes along one or both genomes (Figure 1) [25]. If all duplicated regions are
retained, the depths of their projection onto 1D axes (xaxis and y-axis) should reflect the duplication history.
Identifying these 1D-overlapping blocks is thus essential
for the subsequent screening of the synteny blocks. If at

Tang et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:102
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/102

a certain position, the number of overlapping blocks
exceeds the expected number of duplicated regions,
then we probably should exclude some weaker blocks
derived from more ancient events.
Before we describe the 1D-overlapping detection algorithm, we need to consider the scenario when there are
synteny blocks that are only slightly overlapping but are
blocks we do not want to exclude. This overlap is due
to the over-extension in the previous chaining step.
Therefore, we relax the criteria and specify a distance
cutoff (N m ) below which blocks are not considered
overlapping.
Using a similar concept as employed in the chaining
step, we again correct the boundaries of the synteny
blocks. But this time instead of expanding, we shrink all
our block boundaries by Nm (Figure 5B). This boundary
correction procedure simplifies the identification of the
1D-overlap using the aforementioned Six and Wood
sweep line algorithm [24]. The set of overlapping blocks
are then converted into constraints in the integer programming instance discussed in the following paragraph.

the variables are required to be either 0 or 1. This is a
well-known NP-hard problem [26].
Our problem formulation for QUOTA-ALIGN is the
following: given the expected depth (quota) along the
genomes on both x- and y-axis, select a subset of the
synteny blocks with maximized total sum of scores of
the selected blocks. We introduce a decision variable xi
to determine whether or not we select each block Si. Let
w i be the weight (or score) for synteny block S i for a
total of n blocks, where wi is the sum of the weights in
all the anchor points within Si. The binary integer formulation for our problem can thus be represented in a
standard form:
• Objective function has the form maximize ∑ wi xi,
for i = 1,2,... n
• The m constraints are inequalities of the form ∑ xj
≤ Q X and ∑ x k ≤ Q Y where the set of blocks they
represent are overlapping on the x-axis and y-axis,
respectively; QX and QY represent expected numbers
of subgenomes in genome X and genome Y.
• All of xi where i = 1,2,... n are binary variables to
represent decisions (0 to discard the block, 1 to
retain the block)

Binary integer programming formulation

Linear programming is a method for finding the values
that optimize a given model where all the constraints
are represented as linear equations. The binary integer
programming (BIP) problem is a special case where all

1) chaining anchors; 2) 2D overlapping block merging; 3) screening of synteny blocks. In the example shown, we are only interested in
orthologous blocks between A. thaliana and A. lyrata, therefore a quota of 1:1 is used here. “Overlap distance parameter” is also known as Nm in
the Methods; 4) encoding of the order for the screened blocks is automatically sent to the GRIMM server [27] for rearrangement analysis.

represent 1D conflicts identified in the previous step.

The signed integer sequences can then be exported to
the GRIMM web server [27] to search for one most parsimonious rearrangement scenario (Figure 4).

Solving the integer programming problem

After converting constraints of the synteny blocks to
BIP problem, we use two free solvers - SCIP http://scip.
zib.de/ and GLPK http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/ to
solve the instance. Our default solver SCIP was chosen
for its superior performance http://plato.asu.edu/ftp/
milpf.html. Both SCIP and GLPK generate the same
solution in all test cases. Based on the output from the
BIP solver, we keep all synteny blocks whose indicator
variables are determined as 1. These are the “screened”
blocks that maximize the total weights of the blocks
while respecting the required quota. After screening
with quota QX:QY, each region in genome X will have at
most Q Y matching regions in genome Y, while each
region in genome Y will have up to Q X matching
regions in genome X, thereby fulfilling the constraints.
Chromosome segmentations for studying rearrangements

In the simplest case of quota 1:1, QUOTA-ALIGN produces synteny blocks that do not overlap in 1D projections, which is essential for studying rearrangement
history [25]. We can then process the synteny blocks and
represent the order of the blocks as integer sequences
(where the integers represent identifiers of distinct
blocks). Signs for the individual blocks were automatically determined by inspecting the start and stop anchor
of the synteny block, to reflect whether the two matching
regions are in the same or the opposite orientation [18].

Integration with SynMap application

We have included pre- and post-processing scripts in
the QUOTA-ALIGN software package, as well as scripts
to visualize the final blocks that have passed the quotabased screening. However, most users still need to
download and process each individual genome and gene
annotations. CoGe’s database provides an integrated
solution for data management, contains updated genome
sequences and gene annotations, and provides a suite of
web-based tools for comparative genomics [28]. Therefore we integrated QUOTA-ALIGN within CoGe’s SynMap application to allow easier non-programmatic
access to thousands of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
genomes.
SynMap http://genomevolution.org/CoGe/SynMap.pl
contains a set of tools within CoGe to compare genomes from many organisms, including identification of
syntenic regions [29]. The QUOTA-ALIGN procedure
may be invoked in the “Analysis Option” in the SynMap web interface (Figure 6). Users may select
“Merge syntenic blocks” that chains syntenic blocks
and “Syntenic depth” to specify the expected depths
for screening of synteny blocks. The chaining and
screening procedures are handled by QUOTA-ALIGN
internally. Finally, rearrangement analysis through the
GRIMM server is provided in the SynMap web interface (Figure 6).
