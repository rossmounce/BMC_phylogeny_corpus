Abstract
Background: Specification of primordial germ cells in mice depends on instructive signalling
events, which act first to confer germ cell competence on epiblast cells, and second, to impose a
germ cell fate upon competent precursors. fragilis, an interferon-inducible gene coding for a
transmembrane protein, is the first gene to be implicated in the acquisition of germ cell
competence.
Results: Here, we describe four additional fragilis-related genes, fragilis2–5, which are clustered
within a 68 kb region in the vicinity of the fragilis locus on Chr 7. These genes exist in a number of
mammalian species, which in the human are also clustered on the syntenic region on Chr 11. In the
mouse, fragilis2 and fragilis3, which are proximate to fragilis, exhibit expression that overlaps with
the latter in the region of specification of primordial germ cells. Using single cell analysis, we
confirm that all these three fragilis-related genes are predominant in nascent primordial germ cells,
as well as in gonadal germ cells.
Conclusion: The Fragilis family of interferon-inducible genes is tightly associated with germ cell
specification in mice. Furthermore, its evolutionary conservation suggests that it probably plays a
critical role in all mammals. Detailed analysis of these genes may also elucidate the role of
interferons as signalling molecules during development.

Background
Germ line determination in the mouse is thought to occur
through instructive signalling in the gastrulating post-implantation embryo [1,2]. First, proximal epiblast cells acquire germ cell competence at E6.5, partly in response to
extraembryonic ectoderm-derived signalling molecules. A
subset of these competent cells then acquire a primordial
germ cell (PGC) fate and a population of approximately
45 founder germ cells are detected in the posterior proximal region of the embryo at the base of the incipient allantoic bud on E7.5 [1,2]. The secreted signalling

molecules, BMP4, BMP8b and BMP2 as well as components of the BMP signal transduction pathway, including
Smad1 and Smad5, appear to be involved in the specification of PGCs [3–7]. However, in vitro culture studies and
analysis of BMP4-deficient mice suggest that an additional
signal may also be required for the acquisition of PGC
fate, but its identity is yet unknown [2,3].
We recently identified fragilis, a putative interferon-inducible gene, which codes for a transmembrane protein that
is apparently associated with the acquisition of germ cell

competence by epiblast cells [8]. Extraembryonic ectoderm is able to induce fragilis expression in epiblast tissue,
and BMP4 is required for this induction [8]. fragilis is expressed in proximal epiblast at E6.5, the region in which
PGC-competent cells reside according to clonal analysis
[1]. As these proximal cells move to the posterior proximal region during gastrulation, fragilis expression increases within a community of cells at the base of the incipient
allantoic bud. Cells with the highest expression of fragilis
initiate the germ cell-characteristic expression of TNAP
and stella/PGC-7 [8–10]. These nascent founder PGCs
with high expression of fragilis also show repression of
Hox genes, including Hoxb1 [8].
In view of the strong association of fragilis with PGC specification, we have started to investigate further how this
gene may be regulated and what precise function it serves
during germ cell development. Towards this objective, we
now report that fragilis belongs to a novel murine gene
family, comprising five members, which code for five
highly similar transmembrane proteins. Importantly, the
genes are clustered within a 68 kb genomic region. As we
found several homologues of the Fragilis family in human, cow and rat, they seem to be evolutionarily conserved amongst mammalian species. Most if not all
homologous genes have been reported to be responsive to
interferon signalling, which is in agreement with the presence of conserved interferon stimulable response elements (ISREs) within at least the murine and human loci.
Furthermore, our in situ hybridisation and single cell expression analysis reveal that the two members located
close to fragilis, fragilis2 and fragilis3, are also expressed in
founder PGCs, although their overall expression pattern
in post-implantation embryos in other respects is distinct.
Studies on the Fragilis family of genes could therefore be
crucial for our understanding of PGC specification, especially since their homologues have been implicated in mediating homotypic cell adhesion and lengthening of the
cell cycle time [11,12]. These studies may also show how
interferons act as signalling molecules, which has hitherto
not been considered in the context of embryonic
development.

Results
The Fragilis gene family
Using the cDNA sequence of fragilis as a template to
search the Ensembl genome browser http://www.ensembl.org, we identified eight mouse genes with moderate to
high DNA sequence similarity to fragilis (45–74%). ESTs
from a variety of embryonic and adult tissues have been
reported for five of these genes, of which four possess a
two-exon structure similar to fragilis. Analysis of the genomic location of the latter revealed that the four genes
cluster around the fragilis locus within a 68 kb region on
the distal tip of mouse Chr 7 (F5). We therefore named

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/3/1

the four novel genes fragilis2-5, reflecting their genomic
location, their similarity to fragilis and their germ cell associated expression pattern (see below; Fig. 1). The four
remaining putative genes that we detected have few or
mostly no reported ESTs and are coded by a single exon
unlike fragilis. We therefore consider them to be
pseudogenes.
To determine whether the Fragilis genes are evolutionarily
conserved, we searched the human genome using Ensembl and found four homologues on Chr 11 (p15.5), a region which is indeed syntenic to the Fragilis family locus
on mouse Chr 7 (Fig. 1). Three of these genes, Ifitm1 (9–
27), Ifitm2 (1-8D) and Ifitm3 (1-8U), share 58–65% similarity to the fragilis gene cluster and are located within an
18 kb genomic stretch [13]. They are responsive to type1/
2 interferons and code for interferon induced transmembrane (Ifitm) proteins, involved in antiproliferative signalling and homotypic cell adhesion [11,12,14,15]. The
fourth gene, ENSG142056, a novel gene with two exons,
is highly similar to mouse fragilis4 (83% DNA sequence
similarity) and neighbours Ifitm2. The human Fragilis
family homologues hence form a similar genomic cluster
as the five Fragilis genes in the mouse (Fig. 1). Phylogenetic tree analysis suggests however, that only two Fragilis
genes, fragilis4 and either fragilis, fragilis2 or fragilis3, have
been conserved from mouse to human (data not shown).
Subsequent gene duplications may therefore have occurred independently in both species. We also identified
two Fragilis family-like genes in cow (bovine 1-8U, bovine
9–27) and four genes in rat (P26376, JC1241, NP110460,
AAD48010). While the rat genes have been annotated as
putative interferon-inducible, the two bovine genes that
are similar to the human Ifitm genes, have been reported
to respond to interferon signalling [16,17]. Due to limited
mapping information of the cow and rat genomes, we
cannot, at this stage, deduce whether these homologous
genes are also organised in a cluster. Interferon stimulable
response elements (ISREs, GGAAAN(N)GAAAC) within
the human Ifitm locus confer the responsiveness of the
three human Ifitm genes to interferons [11,18]. Similar
ISRE consensus sequences are also found within the Fragilis family cluster in the mouse, associated in particular
with fragilis, fragilis2 and fragilis5 (Fig. 1).
The murine family of fragilis and related genes code for
five highly similar transcripts of 104 to 144 amino acids,
each containing two predicted transmembrane domains
(Fig. 2). The sequence similarity to human, cow and rat
fragilis-like genes is equally high (overall 68% amino acid
similarity). It should be noted, that the first transmembrane domain as well as the following stretch to the beginning of the second transmembrane domain constitute the
regions of highest intra- and inter-species conservation.

Figure 1
The Fragilis family cluster on mouse Chr7, and the human homologues in the syntenic region on Chr11. In the mouse, the five
Fragilis genes are clustered within a 68 kb region. All genes are encoded by two exons, and apart from fragilis2, they are located
on the minus strand. In human, the four homologous genes, ENSG142056, Ifitm1 (9–27), Ifitm2 (1-8D) and Ifitm3 (1-8U), are
clustered within a 26.5 kb stretch. No sequence information is currently available for the genomic region downstream the
Ifitm2 gene (blank bar), although a mapped genomic DNA clone containing the three Ifitm genes has been reported [13]. The
four human homologues are each encoded by two exons, but the length of the intronic sequence for Ifitm1 and Iftm3 is not
known. Apart from Ifitm2, all human genes are encoded on the minus strand. The green circles represent ISRE consensus
sequences.

fragilis, fragilis2 and fragilis3 are expressed during early
post-implantation development
We analysed the expression pattern of the five Fragilis
family genes by whole mount in situ hybridisation using
probes that span the 3' region (150–200 bp) of the corresponding mRNAs. These probes show no significant
cross-hybridization between members of the Fragilis family as judged by dotblot analysis (data not shown). As reported, we saw expression of fragilis restricted to the
epiblast at E5.5 and E6.5. More importantly, around E7.5,
expression of fragilis is intense within a population of cells
at the base of the allantois in the region where PGC specification occurs (Fig. 3a,3b,3c) [8]. fragilis2 and fragilis3
are also expressed within the epiblast of E5.5 embryos
(Fig. 3g, data not shown). While expression of fragilis2 is
thereafter significantly downregulated, fragilis3 remains
expressed at a similar level in the embryonic tissues. At
E7.5, fragilis2 is detected in the posterior mesoderm, while
fragilis3 expression is seen throughout the epiblast. More
significantly, like fragilis, both fragilis2 and fragilis3 show
high expression in the region where the cluster of founder
PGCs originates (Fig. 3i/i',3n/n'). Thus, these three members of the Fragilis family show significant expression at
the time and site of PGC specification.

At E8.5, fragilis expression is seen in cells at the base and
within the proximal third of the allantois (Fig. 3d). Additionally, a signal is detected in the latero-anterior aspects
of the developing brain (Fig. 3e). At this stage, fragilis2 is
expressed in the mesoderm in the caudal half of the embryo (Fig. 3j,3k), whereas fragilis3 appears present
throughout the entire embryo (Fig. 3p,3q,3r). It is noteworthy, that expression seems significantly stronger in
cells at the base and within the proximal third of the allantois at this stage (Fig. 3q). At E9.5, fragilis signal is seen in
the mesoderm and the pharyngeal arches (Fig. 3f). At this
stage, fragilis2 expression appears restricted to the tailbud,
the mesoderm caudal to the 15th somite and the developing lung tissue (Fig. 3l).
In order to further analyse fragilis2 expression, we carried
out in situ hybridisation on transverse and sagittal sections of E9.5 and E10.5 embryos, respectively. This confirmed the pattern seen in whole mount preparations,
namely presence of staining in the presomitic, somatic
and bodywall mesoderm in the caudal regions of the embryo at E9.5 (Fig. 4a,4b,4c,4d). It appears that fragilis2 expression is lost in differentiating mesodermal or somatic
tissue, hence explaining the caudal-to-rostral gradient of
staining seen in the caudal region of the whole mount

Expression analysis of fragilis (a-f), fragilis2 (g-l) and fragilis3 (m-r) by whole mount in situ hybridisation. Pictures are taken as lateral view unless otherwise stated, with anterior to the left and posterior to the right. fragilis is expressed throughout the epiblast in E5.5 embryos (a) and in the region of germ cell specification at the base of the incipient and early allantoic bud at E7.5
(b, b' posterior view, c). At E8.5, signal is detected at the base and in the proximal third of the allantois as well as in the lateroanterior aspects of the brain (d rostral view, e anterior view). At E9.5, fragilis appears expressed in the mesoderm as well as in
the pharyngeal arches (f). fragilis2 is detected throughout the epiblast at E5.5 (g). Expression seems thereafter downregulated
but becomes again detectable in the posterior mesoderm and at the base of the incipient allantoic bud in E7.0 and E7.5
embryos (h, i, i' posterior view). At E8.5, expression is seen in caudal mesoderm (j, k posterior view), while at E9.5 expression
is seen in the tailbud, the mesoderm caudal to the 15th somite and the developing lung tissue (arrow, l). fragilis3 is expressed
throughout the epiblast at E6.5 (m) and around E7.5 additionally in the region of PGC specification (n, n' posterior view, o). At
E8.5, fragilis3 expression is seen throughout the embryo and appears intense in cells (arrow in q posterior view) at the base and

embryos (see Fig. 3l). In addition, the sections show expression in the ventral neural tube, as well as in single
cells within the wall of the hindgut. As the sagittal sections
of E10.5 embryos demonstrate, these latter cells seem to
belong to a population of fragilis2 mRNA positive cells,
which are migrating along the hindgut and ventral to the
dorsal aorta (Fig. 4e,4g). Their location suggests strongly
that these cells are at least in part PGCs, migrating from
their site of origin into the developing genital ridges. Furthermore, fragilis2 expression is seen in the developing
lung tissue posterior to the embryonic heart and ventral to
the dorsal aorta (Fig. 4e,4f).
In contrast to the first three members of the family, neither fragilis4 nor fragilis5 showed expression at early postimplantation stages (E7.0-E8.5, data not shown). Consequently, only the three genes at the centre of the family
cluster, that is fragilis, fragilis2 and fragilis3 are expressed in
the embryo between E5.5 and E9.5. While their expression pattern is distinct, there is a striking overlap within
the region where founder germ cells are located. This
could suggest that the three neighbouring genes, fragilis,
fragilis2 and fragilis3, may share regulatory elements that
might be present within the cluster. Such regulatory elements may be responsible for the genes' overlapping
expression pattern specifically around the region of PGCs
specification.
Single cell analysis of fragilis, fragilis2 and fragilis3 in
PGCs and somatic neighbours
To obtain more precise information on the expression of
the new Fragilis family members in the context of germ
cell specification, we tested single cell cDNAs from PGCs
and surrounding somatic cells sited at the base of the incipient allantoic bud in E7.5 embryos. Both fragilis2 and
fragilis3 were expressed in founder PGCs, which show
transcription of the germ cell marker stella/PGC7 (Fig. 4a)
[8,10]. The two Fragilis family members were also detected in surrounding somatic cells that lack expression of stella/PGC7 [8]. Notably, semi-quantitative analysis using
Southernblotting showed that fragilis2 and fragilis3 are expressed predominantly and at higher levels in PGCs compared to the neighbouring somatic cells (Fig. 4b,4c). This
mimics the pattern seen for fragilis, although expression of
the latter is more specific to germ cells. Combined with
the in situ hybridisation data, these observations further
support the notion that certain common control elements
may be involved in the upregulated expression of the
three Fragilis genes in the founder PGCs.

During the developmental stages directly subsequent to
PGC specification, all three Fragilis family genes are expressed in a population of cells associated with the allantois and in a location where premigrating PGCs are
thought to reside (Fig. 3,3d,3k,3q). The precise gene ex-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/3/1

pression during migration of PGCs is not clear at this stage
from our analysis. However, using in situ hybridisation
and PCR analysis of cDNAs from single cells within the
genital ridge, we found clear expression of fragilis, fragilis2
and fragilis3 in the gonadal germ cells at E11.5/12.5 (Fig.
5). While fragilis3 expression extends to the mesonephros,
fragilis and fragilis2 signal was restricted to the genital
ridge. A punctate staining pattern was seen for fragilis,
mimicking the germ cell restricted expression of stella/
PGC7 (Fig. 5b). This pattern in addition to the PCR analysis suggests that fragilis is expressed predominantly if not
solely in germ cells at E11.5. As was the case in earlier embryos, neither fragilis4 nor fragilis5 were detected in gonadal germ cells (data not shown).

Discussion
In this study we describe the identification of the murine
Fragilis gene family, which appears to be conserved
amongst mammalian species, and whose members code
for five highly similar transmembrane proteins. Three
members of the Fragilis family, fragilis, fragilis2 and
fragilis3, exhibit expression, which is associated with germ
cell specification and development. Located at the cell
membrane, the Fragilis proteins may be important for mediating interactions amongst germ cells and their
surrounding neighbours. While the three genes are expressed earlier at E5.5 and thereafter to a varying extent,
they all show upregulation of expression within nascent
PGCs. It is possible that a cis control element exists within
the locus that is required for this expression, which continues within gonadal PGCs. Future studies will elucidate
whether such control elements exist, where they are located and how they could regulate expression of the fragilisrelated genes.
Although the five Fragilis family members are clustered
within a small genomic region, it appears that neither
fragilis4 nor fragilis5 show expression in early embryos or
embryonic germ cells. It is striking that these two members are located at the periphery of the cluster in contrast
to the centrally located fragilis, fragilis2 and fragilis3 genes.
This lack of expression may be due to the presence of
boundary elements, which might restrict the action of
control elements to genes present within the centre of the
cluster. The four human homologues of the Fragilis family
are also arranged in a genomic cluster. However, sequence
comparison suggests that gene duplications at the mouse
Fragilis and the human Ifitm locus may have occurred independently in the two species. Hence, it appears that a
certain evolutionary constrain may exist on duplication
and maintenance of the duplicated genes within immediate neighbourhood. Since the human homologues are
clustered in the syntenic region and are highly similar to
the family genes, it is tempting to speculate that they may
also serve similar functions as in mouse and man.

appears punctate and restricted to single cells mimicking the pattern seen for the germ cell-specific stella gene. asterix: genital
ridge; black arrowhead: mesonephros; scale bars: 400 µm.

The presence of several interferon stimulable response element (ISRE) consensus sequences within the Fragilis locus, together with the similarity of the genes to their
interferon-inducible human and bovine counterparts,
suggest very strongly that fragilis and the fragilis-related
genes are responsive to interferons or possibly other cytokines. Indeed, the ISRE tandem repeat present in the 5'
flanking region of human Ifitm1, Ifitm2 and Ifitm3 genes
is also present in the 5' flanking region of fragilis exon 1
[13]. Interferons, as secreted signalling molecules, have so

far been implicated mainly in the process of immune response, the inhibition of cellular growth and the control
of apoptosis [19]. Although interferons are expressed in
the post-implantation embryo, their role during development has not been addressed in detail [20,21]. Our studies have pointed to a possible involvement of interferons
in germ cell development. Future work will determine
whether the Fragilis genes respond to interferon signals in
all or some instances where the genes are expressed.

Conclusion
We have identified the Fragilis family of interferon-inducible genes, which code for transmembrane proteins. The
five members are arranged in a cluster within a genomic
region of 68 kb in the mouse that also contains ISRE elements. The centrally located fragilis, fragilis2 and fragilis3
genes are of particular interest, because they are expressed
in the region and at the time where germ cell specification
occurs. The family is evolutionarily conserved amongst
mammalian species where it may serve similar functions.
Detailed studies of the Fragilis family may also show what
role interferons have in embryonic development.

Methods
Accession numbers
Nucleotide sequence data reported are available in the
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases as primary sequences
under the accession numbers: AY082484 (fragilis),
AY082486 (fragilis3), AY247203 (fragilis5); and in the
Third Party Annotation Section under the accession numbers: BK001123 (fragilis2), BK001124 (fragilis4).
Database searches and animals
Ensembl and partly NCBI genome browsers have been
used for data retrieval. Embryos and genital ridges used
for in situ hybridisation experiments came from 129/SvEv
× 129/SvEv or B6CBAF1 × Oct4-GFP matings. Embryos
and genital ridges used for single cell analysis came from
129/SvEv × 129/SvEv or MF1 × Oct4-GFP matings, respectively. The noon of the day of the vaginal plug was designated as E0.5. Embryos were staged according to Downs
and Davies [22]. Work on animals was performed under
Home Office project licence PPL80/1706.
In situ hybridisation
3'-fragments of fragilis and fragilis2–5 cDNAs were PCR
amplified using the primers described below, and cloned
into pGEM-T vector (Promega). DIG-labelled antisense
RNA probes were synthesized using DIG RNA labelling kit
(Sp6/T7; Roche). In situ hybridisation on whole embryos
and urogenital ridges was performed as described [23,24].
Hybridisation was carried out using 1 µg/ml DIG-labelled
RNA probe in hybridisation buffer (50% formamide, 1.3
× SSC (pH 5), 5 mM EDTA (pH 8), 50 µg/ml yeast RNA,
0.2% Tween-20, 0.5% CHAPS, 100 µg/ml heparin in
DEPC treated H2O) at 70°C over night. In situ hybridisation on sections was performed as described [25]. Prior to
cryosectioning at 12–15 µm thickness, embryos were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and cryoprotected
in 20% sucrose in PBS. Hybridisation was carried out using 200–400 µg/ml DIG-labelled RNA probe in hybridisation buffer (50% formamide, 0.1 mg/ml yeast total RNA,
10% dextran sulphate, 1 × Denhardt's, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM
EDTA, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM NaH2PO4 × 2H2O, 5
mM Na2HPO4 in dH2O). Hybridised probe was detected

using alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-DIG Fab fragments (Roche) and BM Purple alkaline phosphatase substrate (Roche) for whole mounts and 0.35 mg/ml NBT,
0.175 mg/ml BCIP, 0.24 mg/ml levamisole in 0.1 M Tris
(pH 9.5), 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2 for sections,
respectively.
Preparation, PCR and Southernblot analysis of single cell
cDNAs
Early bud stage embryos (E7.5) and genital ridges (E11.5)
were isolated in DMEM/10% fetal calf serum/25 mM
HEPES (pH 7.4). Fragments bearing primordial and gonadal germ cells, respectively, were dissected out and
dissociated into single cells. The latter were picked using
mouth pipettes and their cDNAs were amplified as described previously [26]. The following primers were used
in order to PCR amplify stella cDNA, parts of fragilis2

run on 1.5% agarose/TBE electrophoresis gels. For Southernblot analysis, single cell cDNAs were blotted onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham) and probed with 32αP
dCTP-labelled DNA probes comprising the 3' regions of
fragilis,
fragilis2
(primers
for
amplification:
5'AGCTCCCTGTTCTTCACCAT3',
5'GCAAATGGTCAGGACTAAGTC3') and fragilis3 cDNAs
and full length stella cDNA. The 3' fragment of GAPDH
cDNA was used as loading control (primers for amplification:
5'TTGGGCTACACTGAGGACCAG3',
5'GATAGGGCCTCTCTTGCTCAG3'). Blotting signal was
detected using a Fuji film FLA 5000 scanner. Signal
strength was semi-quantified in relation to GAPDH signal, whereby relative gene expression was calculated as ratio of gene signal to GAPDH signal and this ratio was
subsequently normalized by division through the highest
hybridisation signal per blot (as described previously [8]).
For dotblot analysis, full length fragilis cDNAs were blotted and probed with 32αP dCTP-labelled 3' probes.
