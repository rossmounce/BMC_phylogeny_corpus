Sequence analysis of fusion protein gene of
Newcastle disease virus isolated from outbreaks
in Egypt during 2006

Abstract
Background: Newcastle disease virus represents APMV-1 and is the most characterized among all APMV types. The
F protein cleavage site sequence is a well-characterized determinant of NDV pathogenicity in chickens. In this
study, the sequences of fusion protein (F) gene of three Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains isolated from
outbreak in chickens in the Al-Sharkia province of Egypt in 2006 were determined.
Findings: The viral genomic RNAs were extracted from the infective allantoic fluid and F gene is amplified using
primer sets designed from the available sequences of NDV strains from GenBank. The pathogenicity of NDV strains
was determined by three internationally recognized tests mean death time, intracerebral pathogenicity index, and
intravenous pathogenicity index. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the Egypt isolates are closely related with
the genotype II of class II NDV strains.
Conclusions: The sequences of the F genes of the 2006 Egypt isolates are closely related to that of the 2005
Egypt isolate from the same province suggesting that these strains are probably circulating in the vaccinated bird
population in Egypt until development of an outbreak.

Findings
Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious and fatal
disease of chickens. In many developing countries ND is
endemic and the disease has the greatest impact on villages where the livelihood of people depends on poultry
farming. The causative agent Newcastle disease virus
(NDV), is a member of the genus Avulavirus in the
family Paramyxoviridae. NDV isolates display a spectrum of virulence in chickens ranging from inapparent
to fatal infection. Based on their pathogenicity in chickens, NDV isolates are categorized into three main
pathotypes: lentogenic (low virulence), mesogenic (intermediate virulence) and velogenic (high virulence). It
may appear that continents having warm climates are
reservoirs of virulent NDV strains [1]. NDV is a wellstudied paramyxovirus and complete genome sequences

of many North American NDV strains are available;
however, very little is known about the genome
sequences of NDV strains isolated from different parts
of Africa with in isolated cases [2-4].
ND outbreaks occur frequently in Egypt and the
source of the virulent NDV in these outbreaks are not
known. We have reported the complete genome
sequence of a NDV strain isolated from an outbreak at
a poultry farm in Al-Sharkia province, Egypt in 2005
(chicken/Egypt/1/2005) [5]. In this study, we have determined the fusion (F) gene sequences of three NDV
strains isolated from outbreaks on poultry farms in AlSharkia province, Egypt in 2006. The infected birds
showed severe neurological and/or respiratory symptoms. The viruses were confirmed as NDV by hemagglutination inhibition assay using a known NDV
antiserum. The pathogenicity of NDV strains was determined by three internationally recognized tests mean
death time (MDT), intracerebral pathogenicity index
(ICPI), and intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) [6].

terminator v 3.1 matrix standard kit and 3130xl genetic
analyzer data collection software v3.0 (Applied Biosystems Inc). The entire F gene was sequenced at least
three times from independent RNA preparations to
ensure a consensus sequence. All experiments were carried out in an enhanced BSL3 containment facility certified by the USDA to work with highly virulent NDV
strains with the investigators wearing appropriate protective equipment and compliant with all protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) of the University of Maryland and
under Animal Welfare Association (AWA) regulations.
The F gene of all three Egyptian strains of NDV is
1792 nt in length and encodes a predicted F protein of
553 amino acids (GenBank under accession numbers
FJ969393, FJ969394 and FJ969395). Sequence analysis of
the F protein of Egyptian strains showed 94% to 99%
amino acid identity with that of strain BC (Table 2).
Phylogenetic analysis showed that strains chicken/Egypt/
2/2006 and chicken/Egypt/4/2006 are closely related
with the virulent NDV strain Texas GB, while strain
chicken/Egypt/3/2006 stands out from other NDV
strains in genotype II of class II viruses (Figure 1). The
F protein cleavage site sequence is a well-characterized
determinant of NDV pathogenicity in chickens [8-10].
Virulent NDV strains typically contain a polybasic cleavage site (R-X-K/R-R↓F), which is recognized by intracellular proteases present in most cell types. The
cleavage site of all Egyptian strains contained four basic
amino acids at positions 112-116 (112R-R-Q-K-R↓F-I118),
corresponding to those of virulent NDV strains similar
to the one that was isolated in 2005 from the same province [5]. In addition, the presence of the phenylalanine
(F) residue at position 117 has been described as being a
possible contributor to the neurological effects [11,12].
Interestingly, the F cleavage site of NDV strains isolated
from Egypt was identical to those of NDV strains isolated from chickens and guinea fowl in the Mopti and
Sikasso regions of Mali in 2008 and many other NDV
strains from China [5,13,14].
Our results indicate that high levels of nucleotide and
amino acid sequence identity exist between the African

Intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) was done in 6-week-old chickens,
intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) test in 1-day-old chicks inoculated
intracerebrally and mean death time (MDT) in 9-day-old eggs inoculated
through allantoic cavity following standard protocol.

The NDV strains were designated as NDV/chicken/
Egypt/2/2006, NDV/chicken/Egypt/3/2006 and NDV/
chicken/Egypt/4/2006. NDV strain LaSota was used as a
positive control for all pathogenicity studies. The results
of the pathogenicity tests showed that all three NDV
strains were velogenic (Table 1).
The F gene was chosen for sequencing because this
gene is a major determinant of virulence and NDV isolates are grouped into genotypes based on the sequences
of this gene [7-9]. To determine the F gene sequence of
all the Egyptian strains, the viruses were grown in the
allantoic cavities of 9-day-old embryonated specific
pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. Plaque purification of
the viruses was not performed to avoid the genetic
selection, which may not represent the actual viral genome. The viral genomic RNAs were extracted from the
infective allantoic fluid using RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Primer sets were designed from the available
sequences of NDV strains Beaudette C (accession numbers X04719) and Texas GB (accession numbers
GU978777). Three primers namely F-1for 5’ ACGGGTAGAAGATTCTG 3’, F-655for 5’GTTGACTAAGTTAGGTG 3’and F-1780rev 5’ CTCTCCGAATTGACAGAC 3’ (number corresponds to NDV F gene
nucleotide sequence) were used to sequence the entire F
gene. Reverse transcription and PCR were done using
virus specific primers by Superscript-II reverse transcriptase and high fidelity Platinum Pfx polymerase
(both from Invitrogen), respectively. The PCR-amplified
products were directly sequenced using BigDye

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree of Egyptian strains with other NDV strains was constructed using maximum parsimony method with
bootstrap values calculated for 1000 replicates (Egyptian strains were marked with solid triangle)

and North American NDV strains. It is possible that
NDV strains isolated from Egypt may represent the
strains circulating in the poultry population in that
region. These results also suggest that more than one
genotype of NDV is circulating in the African subcontinents. However, determination of the complete genome
sequences of Egyptian strains isolated in different geographic regions of Africa is necessary to understand the
genetic relatedness among NDV strains circulating in
different parts of the world.
The close genetic relatedness of the NDV strains isolated in 2005 and 2006 in the same province in Egypt
suggest that these strains are endemic in the bird population in this province. Furthermore, these results suggest that NDV vaccine used in this province may not be
very effective in stopping viral shedding, which will
allow unnoticed circulation of the virulent virus in the
vaccinated bird population until development of an

outbreak. Therefore, it may be necessary to evaluate the
effectiveness of the current vaccine used in the Al-Sharkia province against circulating NDV strains.
