Abstract
Background: The function of a noncoding RNA sequence is mainly determined by its secondary
structure and therefore a family of noncoding RNA sequences is much more conserved on the
structural level than on the sequence level. Understanding the function of noncoding RNA
sequence families requires two things: a hand-crafted or hand-improved alignment and detailed
analyses of the secondary structures. There are several tools available that help performing these
tasks, but all of them are specialized and focus on only one aspect, editing the alignment or plotting
the secondary structure. The problem is both these tasks need to be performed simultaneously.
Findings: 4SALE is designed to handle sequence and secondary structure information of RNAs
synchronously. By including a complete new method of simultaneous visualization and editing RNA
sequences and secondary structure information, 4SALE enables to improve and understand RNA
sequence and secondary structure evolution much more easily.
Conclusion: 4SALE is a step further for simultaneously handling RNA sequence and secondary
structure information. It provides a complete new way of visual monitoring different structural
aspects, while editing the alignment. The software is freely available and distributed from its website
at http://4sale.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/

Background
Sequence alignments represent a starting point for almost
every sequence based analysis. Analysing RNA sequences
requires in addition to take information about their secondary structures into account. Therefore several methods
like lara [1], MARNA [2], RNAforester [3] or Dynalign [4]
were proposed in recent years to align RNA sequences taking into consideration their secondary structures. Since
many downstream sequence analysis methods are based
on the information represented by alignments, building
correct alignments is challenging as both sequences and
structures have to be taken into account.

A common task is to manualy check and improve the
alignment before using it for further analysis. Programs
like 4SALE [5], SCARNA [6], ConStruct [7], DCSE [8] or
RALEE [9] were built to help manually editing RNA
sequences and secondary structure alignments. These
tools provide solid edit functionality, but in case of large
complex alignments it is often hard to find the exact positions that require manual improvements. Visualizations
can help to identify those misaligned regions. Conservation bars which are used in well known tools like ClustalX
[10] and sequence logos [11] are the most common methods to visualize sequence alignments. But both these

methods have the disadvantage that every single column
needs to be checked manually. Although the methods can
be used also in the context of sequence and secondary
structure alignments, they are not specifically designed to
take advantage of the secondary structure information.
Sequence logos [11] were extended to RNA structure logos
[12] and 3D sequence logos of RNA alignments [13] to
also include structure information, but still fail to provide
an easy understanding and compact visualization of the
structural information contained in the alignment. A different approach of visualizing RNA alignment information is given with the S2S framework [14], which
interconnects an RNA sequence alignment with a consensus secondary and the 3D tertiary structure visualization.
While this approach can help to get a good understanding
of the common structural information within the RNA
sequence alignment, it can not handle individual secondary structure information. Therefore it is not capable of
visualizing the structural differences within a sequence
family.
A common practise to analyze at secondary structure
information is to plot the structure in 2D. Several algorithms for a 2D secondary structure layout were proposed:
Bruccoleri layout [15], loopdloop layout [16], vector
based layout [17] or efficient RNA drawing [18]. These
algorithms were implemented in tools like the Vienna
Package [19], loopdloop [16], RNAViz [20], RNAMovies
[21] or JViz.RNA [22] to provide a compact visualization
of single secondary structures. StructureLab [23] provides
more advanced interactive visualization of data derived
from different folding algorithms. In addition, it has several facilities to visualize and compare data that are
derived from multiple solutions for one sequence or multiple solutions from several sequences. RNAMovies [21]
was the first program to provide a solution to visualize the
differences of many secondary structure alternatives for
one RNA sequence by animating between the 2D plot of
every single structure alternative. 4SALE takes all these
advantages of plotting single instances of secondary structures as well as the visualization of differences between
structures and combines it with the main concept of
4SALE: synchronicity. This means every single edit operation or selection is synchronized with a new 2D plot of
either the complete alignment as consensus visualization
or a selected single secondary structure. The 2D plot animates between all changes made in the alignment in a
similar way as RNAMovies [21] does. This makes it easy to
understand what the changes in the alignment imply for
the secondary structures.

Implementation
The new visualization capabilities in 4SALE are built on
top of prefuse [24], an interactive information visualization toolkit for JAVA. Prefuse provides a rich set of features

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/91

for visualization and animation capabilities. We used
existing RNA secondary structure layout algorithms and
integrated them with prefuse to enable interactive secondary structure visualization. The structure viewer is integrated like any other component in 4SALE working with
RNA sequence and secondary structure information, this
allows seamless interaction between all other components like the alignment window or the window showing
the compensatory base changes (CBC table).

Results
Structure Viewer
The new structure viewer (Fig. 1) allows visualization of
2D plots of the secondary structures within the sequence
and secondary structure alignment. By selecting sequences
in the alignment window the corresponding secondary
structures are loaded into the viewer. Visualization of single and multiple sequences are supported. The two most
popular layout algorithms of Bruccoleri [15] and Olsen
(as implemented in loopdloop [16]) are available. The
Bruccoleri layout is based on a per helix alignment, while
the Olsen layout also prevents clashes of adjacent nucleotides within loops by allowing angles in one helix to
resolve space limitations. The plot can optionally be
drawn with gaps, which causes all gap positions to be handled as dots (unpaired positions). If multiple sequences
are selected, the consensus structure based on a userdefined conservation value is plotted by default. By
unchecking the "conservation mode"-checkbox a single
structure navigator is shown, which allows easy switching
between selected sequences.
Visualization of structural differences
Although the RNA secondary structures within the alignment can be categorized by the consensus structure, it is
also important to look at the individual differences
between the structures, especially if the alignment is not
highly conserved. 4SALE provides animations between
secondary structures similar to RNAMovies [21], which
makes it easy to detect the differences. While RNAMovies
[21] animates through the secondary structure landscape
of one single RNA sequence by using the sequence positions as anchor points for the animation, we use the alignment columns to provide animation between structures of
distinct RNA sequences, which therefore are not required
to be of equal length.
Synchronized selection
Since 4SALE synchronizes every action between all views
on the same dataset, selections within the structure view
automatically appear in the alignment window and vice
versa. The selection is context sensitive, which means it is
only applied to the current selected sequences. This is
extremely helpful to highlight patterns that can be easily
selected via the search function within the alignment win-

the multiple sequence alignment can be projected onto the secondary structure by checkmarking the "include gaps" box. The
current visualization can be saved as image in different formats (svg, jpg and png).

dow, within the structure view. One example might be the
conserved UGGU motif 5' side to the apex of helix III in
ITS2 [25].
Monitoring structure information during editing
4SALEs live structure preview allows monitoring all structure related modifications on the sequence and secondary
structure alignment. Blockwise editing in "edit alignment
mode" modifies the consensus structure for example,
these changes are shown as animations within the structure view, when "consensus mode" is activated. This feature easily helps to prevent misalignments. Editing
secondary structures or manually adding secondary structures to loaded sequences was already supported by

4SALE, by activating the structure viewer it is now possible
to view the current state of the secondary structure information. By selecting one sequence the construction process of this sequence is animated with every insertion/
deletion of a bond in the alignment window. This method
is also available for column based edit operations, in this
case the current consensus structure is animated.
Mapping alignment information to a consensus structure
4SALE provides a compact visualization of sequence and
secondary structure alignments (Fig. 2) by plotting the
consensus structure and labeling it with alignment information. The common structure information of all selected
sequences is represented by the plotted consensus struc-

structure alignments by plotting the consensus structure. Additional alignment information like conservation, gap information,
composition, helix position and alignment column position is provided within the tooltip. A slider on the bottom of the winodw allows to choose the degree of secondary structure conservation. Sequence conservation is visualized via colorinterpolation between red (no conservation) and green (highly conserved).

ture while the sequence information is visualized by a
position wise colormap based on the degree of conservation within the current alignment column. Since every dot
in the structure view represents a column in the alignment, the tooltip at this position contains specific information about this column, like nucleotide based
conservation or which helix this position is in.
Analyzing compensatory base changes (CBCs)
The synchronization of selected regions (Fig. 3) leads to a
big improvement of the existing CBC analyzing capabilities of 4SALE. Corresponding base changes selected in the
CBC table are now not only highlighted within the align-

ment window, but also within the structure viewer. This
provides a much more intuitive view to understand CBCs
beetween two RNA sequences. One can either look at the
common structure element shared by both sequences,
which is shown by default or activate the sequence navigator to animate between the two sequences.
Saving secondary structure images
Secondary structure plots are often used to illustrate specific regions within RNA sequences. 4SALE supports
exporting the current state of the structure viewer to a vector or pixel based image. By supporting Scalable Vector

Other improvements
Besides the new visualization capabilities 4SALE also
introduced some other new features that help working
with sequence and secondary structure alignments. First
we added the ability to modify sequence information,
which was requested by many users. By placing the cursor
in the sequence part of the sequence and secondary structure view while "edit alignment mode" is active, it is now
possible to simply type the letters to be inserted or use
backspace to remove parts of the sequence. When inserting new nucleotides 4SALE sets the corresponding structure part as nonbinding positions. When deleting
nucleotides 4SALE checks whether binding regions are

involved and automatically removes all related nucleotide
pairings before performing the deletion. It is to be noted
that due to the complexity of this operation, undo operation are currently only supported with gap insertions or
deletions. However, for all other options, the undo operation is available.
4SALE also adds lara [1] integration, a tool for sequence
and secondary structure alignments. This allows users to
choose between the 4SALE alignment method or the lara
alignment method [1]. The 4SALE alignment maps the
sequence and secondary structure information of every
single RNA sequence to one letter encoded sequences. The
algorithm can be described as string alignment on a 12 letter alphabet comprised of the 4 nucleotides in three structural states (unpaired, paired left, paired right).

Horizontal dependencies given by the nucleotide pairings
are not modeled by this approach. To align the encoded
sequences common alignment programs, like CLUSTAL
W [26] with a suitable scoring matrix can be used [5]. In
contrast to the faster 4SALE alignment method, lara [1]
uses combinatorical optimization and respects horizontal
dependencies.

The new features of 4SALE are demonstrated by a movie
provided within the help of 4SALE at http://4sale.bio
apps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/.

Furthermore we added the possibility to export the one
letter encoded sequence and secondary structure alignment used with the 4SALE alignment method. Together
with the substitution matrix located in the matrix folder
this output can be used to calculate phylogenetic trees
considering both, sequence and secondary structure information, by using standard protein based phylogenetic
tools, like ProfDist [27] or PHYLIP [28]. Note that the provided substitution matrix is calculated on sequences of the
ITS2 database [29,30], so it should be used with caution
with other RNA sequence families than ITS2.

Discussion and conclusion
A number of RNA visualization methods cover either
sequence or structure visualization. Here we introduce a
novel method to visualize sequence and secondary structure alignments. By mapping information contained in
RNA sequence and secondary structure alignments to a
single 2D structure plot of the associated consensus structure, a compact and informative overview is presented. In
contrast to so far used methods like sequence/structure
logos or conservation bars, our method takes advantage of
the structural information to collect all the information in
one view. The previous column based visualization of
alignments didn't scale very well with the length of the
alignment. We adressed this problem by plotting the
information in two dimensons instead of a linear representation. This not only prevents the user from scrolling
through all columns of the alignment but also results in a
very intuitive view of the secondary structure information
contained.

Special thanks go to Markus Bauer (FU Berlin) for his support to integrate
the lara program and to Jan Krüger (University of Bielefeld, Germany) for

With the tight integration of this new visualization technique into the existing editor, 4SALE moves a step further
and provides a comfortable environment when working
with RNA sequence and secondary structure information.
The integrated viewer shows simultaneously structure and
sequence information and enables visual monitoring
structural aspects while editing the sequence-structure
alignment. This joint view leads to a better understanding
of sequence-structure evolution. Potential application of
4SALE includes evolutionary and phylogenetic studies,
the comperative study of RNA molecules, and RNA
design, e.g. in mutation studies.
