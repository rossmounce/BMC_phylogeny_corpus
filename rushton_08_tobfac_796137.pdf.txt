Abstract
Background: Regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription is a major control point in many
biological processes. Transcription factors (TFs) can activate and/or repress the transcriptional rate of target
genes and vascular plant genomes devote approximately 7% of their coding capacity to TFs. Global analysis of TFs
has only been performed for three complete higher plant genomes – Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), poplar
(Populus trichocarpa) and rice (Oryza sativa). Presently, no large-scale analysis of TFs has been made from a member
of the Solanaceae, one of the most important families of vascular plants. To fill this void, we have analysed tobacco
(Nicotiana tabacum) TFs using a dataset of 1,159,022 gene-space sequence reads (GSRs) obtained by methylation
filtering of the tobacco genome. An analytical pipeline was developed to isolate TF sequences from the GSR data
set. This involved multiple (typically 10–15) independent searches with different versions of the TF family-defining
domain(s) (normally the DNA-binding domain) followed by assembly into contigs and verification. Our analysis
revealed that tobacco contains a minimum of 2,513 TFs representing all of the 64 well-characterised plant TF
families. The number of TFs in tobacco is higher than previously reported for Arabidopsis and rice.
Results: TOBFAC: the database of tobacco transcription factors, is an integrative database that provides a portal
to sequence and phylogeny data for the identified TFs, together with a large quantity of other data concerning
TFs in tobacco. The database contains an individual page dedicated to each of the 64 TF families. These contain
background information, domain architecture via Pfam links, a list of all sequences and an assessment of the
minimum number of TFs in this family in tobacco. Downloadable phylogenetic trees of the major families are
provided along with detailed information on the bioinformatic pipeline that was used to find all family members.
TOBFAC also contains EST data, a list of published tobacco TFs and a list of papers concerning tobacco TFs. The
sequences and annotation data are stored in relational tables using a PostgrelSQL relational database management
system. The data processing and analysis pipelines used the Perl programming language. The web interface was
implemented in JavaScript and Perl CGI running on an Apache web server. The computationally intensive data
processing and analysis pipelines were run on an Apple XServe cluster with more than 20 nodes.
Conclusion: TOBFAC is an expandable knowledgebase of tobacco TFs with data currently available for over
2,513 TFs from 64 gene families. TOBFAC integrates available sequence information, phylogenetic analysis, and
EST data with published reports on tobacco TF function. The database provides a major resource for the study
of gene expression in tobacco and the Solanaceae and helps to fill a current gap in studies of TF families across
the plant kingdom. TOBFAC is publicly accessible at http://compsysbio.achs.virginia.edu/tobfac/.

Background
Tobacco [Nicotiana tabacum L.] is a member of the agriculturally important Solanaceae and is one of the most studied higher plant species. This is because of both its
economic importance and because it is a convenient plant
system for research. Tobacco can be easily transformed
and has a relatively short generation time. A system of
reduced complexity, the tobacco Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2)
cell line, is also available and this cell line is fast growing,
responds to a variety of plant hormones and can be stably
transformed [1]. BY-2 cells are an excellent experimental
system for studies of gene expression and secondary
metabolism. The one missing piece in the puzzle is the
availability of the genome sequence of tobacco.
The large genome size of tobacco (approximately 4.5 Gb)
makes the goal of sequencing the tobacco genome difficult. Fortunately, there are now a number of methods that
can deliver sequence information on the vast majority of
genes in a species without the need to sequence and
assemble the entire genome. One of these techniques is
methylation filtration (MF), which preferentially clones
the hypomethylated fraction of the genome, effectively
reducing the size of the genome to be sequenced. MF has
already been successfully applied in maize, sorghum and
cowpea [2-5]. The development of MF followed studies of
genome architecture that revealed that repetitive elements
tend to form clusters within plant genomes that become
heavily methylated (hypermethylated), leaving stretches
of less-methylated (hypomethylated), low-copy gene-rich
space scattered in islands throughout the genome [6,7].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/53

cies, but these are based on EST data. The species contained in these EST-based datasets include maize, wheat,
barley, sorghum, sugarcane, cotton soybean, potato,
tomato, apple, orange, grape, sunflower, lotus, loblolly
pine and white spruce [14]. However, none of these are
devoted to tobacco and none approach the level of coverage and total of over 2,500 TFs that we have documented
from tobacco. The Nicotiana tabacum genome is the result
of an interspecific hybridization event between Nicotiana
sylvestris and Nicotiana tomentosiformis resulting in an allopolyploid genome with a basic chromosome number of x
= 24. Based on a high density microsatellite-based genetic
map, there is clear evidence of several large translocation
events between the ancestral chromosomes but no evidence of large duplication events. The extent of loss of
chromosomal segments is difficult to assess in the absence
of diploid maps for the ancestral species. It is therefore difficult to predict the total number of tobacco TFs, but it is
likely to be over 3,000. After the databases that cover Arabidopsis, rice and poplar, TOBFAC is currently the most
extensive species-specific higher plant TF database. It will
be a major resource for the study of gene expression in
tobacco and the Solanaceae and will also facilitate studies
of TF families across the plant kingdom.

Construction and Content

The Tobacco Genome Initiative (TGI) has obtained
sequence from an estimated minimum of 90% of tobacco
gene space (cultivar Hicks Broadleaf) using MF technology [8]. We have used a dataset of 1,159,022 gene-space
sequence reads (GSRs) generated by the TGI as the basis
for identifying the majority of all members of 64 wellcharacterized transcription factor (TF) families. Our dataset is estimated to represent a minimum of 2,513 genes
and TOBFAC has been designed not only to be a repository for these sequences but also to be a major resource for
all data concerning tobacco TFs.

Source dataset and knowledgebase construction
A total of 1,159,022 GSRs obtained by methylation filtering were downloaded from the TGI (March 6th 2006) [8].
The GSRs were imported into a PostgrelSQL database having a schema very similar to that used for the Cowpea
Genomics Initiative [5]. Scripting was performed in Perl
using Perl DBI/DBD for PostgrelSQL database connectivity [15]. The Perl modules HTML::Template and
HTML::FillInForm were used to facilitate the a ModelView-Controller software architecture which separates the
display layer (HTML) from bioinformatics logic layer
(Perl code). In addition to sequence data, the database
stores Blast results as well as some ancillary meta data. The
TOBFAC web pages are conceptual views of the PostgrelSQL relational database. Some web pages combine
records from multiple tables, and link to static files outside the database.

Since the publication of the first version of the Arabidopsis genome sequence, finding the complete set of known
TFs in plant genomes has become an attainable goal [9].
However, only three higher plant genome sequences are
currently available, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana),
poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and rice (Oryza sativa L.). A
number of databases have been constructed that integrate
all predicted TFs from these three genomes. These include
the Plant Transcription Factors databases [10,11], PlnTFDB [12] and PlanTAPDB [13]. In addition to these, there
are a number of similar databases devoted to other spe-

Identification and classification of tobacco TFs
To isolate GSRs encoding tobacco TFs, multiple independent tblastn searches of the GSR dataset were performed
using different versions of the amino acid sequences of
the conserved domains from each of 64 TF families. In
most cases, the conserved sequences for each gene family
were taken from The Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors (DATF) [11]. Where the conserved sequences
were taken from other sources, this is noted. The exact
amino acid sequences used for the searches are listed on
the TOBFAC website, both for individual gene families

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/53

and as a complete list that can be downloaded to facilitate
similar searches of other datasets. Our aim was to isolate
every gene in all TF gene families and we therefore performed at least 5–10 independent searches for each gene
family. In particular, all TF family members that showed
divergence from the consensus sequence were used in
searches so that divergent or novel members were found.
We combined this multiple search strategy with a cut off
e-value of 10 in order to rigorously ensure that all possible
gene family members were found (false positives were
later discarded). For each TF family, the GSR hits from all
searches were combined into one data set and assembled
into contigs using a local web based implementation of
the Phrap program for contig building that is available on
the Cowpea Genespace/Genomics Knowledge Base
(CGKB) [5]. Each contig/singleton was then individually
analysed by BLASTX searches against the non-redundant
protein database housed at NCBI [16]. Any sequences that
did not contain the conserved domain for the TF family
under analysis were discarded at this point (see Figure 1).
The sequences that remained represented bona fide
tobacco TFs and each was given a unique identifier. These
sequences were uploaded to TOBFAC, where the complete
list of tobacco TF sequences is available as one dataset (see
Figure 2). For each TF gene family, the page dedicated to
the family has each gene listed individually, together with
the accession numbers of the GSRs that form that predicted gene (see Figure 3). In some cases, predicted genes
were found to correspond to previously published genes
encoding tobacco TFs, and where this is the case, their
published name is listed as an alias.

Determination of the minimum number of genes in each
TF family
It is estimated that at least 90% of tobacco TF genes have
been tagged by the MF technology [8], but not all of these
genes are present as complete gene sequences. A major
task was therefore to calculate the minimum number of
genes present in each tobacco TF family based on the
GSRs. This was calculated based on the number of independent sequences that contained a certain portion of the
conserved domain (say amino acids 20–30). The largest
number of copies of any part of the domain represents the
minimum number of those genes in tobacco. For larger
gene families, the genes were first assigned to known subfamilies and the calculation was performed for each subfamily. The final number for the gene family was then the
sum of all the subfamilies.

method. The data are presented as an unrooted tree to provide an overview of the gene family.

Snapshot of a TF family page. These contain all the sequences
for each tobacco TF family both individually and as a single
file of the complete family. Each predicted gene is listed individually, together with all of its' component GSRs. The GSRs
are presented as hotlinks to their Genbank entries. The page
also contains a short description of the family with links to
the Pfam domains, downloadable phylogenies and JPEGs of
the phylognetic trees, and the sequences that were used to
search the GSRs to find members of this family. The total
number of sequences and minimum number of tobacco genes
in this family are shown at the top of the page.

Comparison of TOBFAC sequences and EST sequences
46,546 tobacco EST sequences from the European
Sequencing of Tobacco Project [18] were uploaded to
TOBFAC. BLAST searches were performed with the TOBFAC TFs against the EST dataset. A total of 557 of the TFs
are supported by EST sequences (see Figure 5). This is less
than 20% of the total and shows that the GSRs have
achieved a much greater coverage than the ESTs. This low
level of EST support is probably because some TFs are very
tissue and developmental stage specific with brief and low
levels of expression. Additional EST datasets from tobacco
will be subject to similar analysis as they become available. Combined EST and GSR datasets will, in the future,
result both in a more robust dataset (due to the linking of

Phylogenetic analysis of TF families
Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were
conducted using MEGA version 4 [17]. Phylogenetic trees
were produced by the Neighbor-Joining method and statistical support for the nodes in the phylogenetic trees
(bootstrap values from a minimum of 1000 trials) were
obtained for each tree. TOBFAC users can download the
phylogenetic tree files, either with or without bootstrap
values, and display them in any desired format. Currently,
phylogenetic analysis is only available for some of the
major TF gene families (ERF, WRKY, NAC, homeodomain, bZIP, bHLH, R2R3MYB, MADS box, SAP, BES and
Dof genes) (see Figure 4). As additional phylogenetic
information is generated for other TF families this will be
made available on TOBFAC.

increase in the minimum number of predicted TFs in
tobacco.

Utility
The main page for TOBFAC
TOBFAC is one of the most extensive species-specific
higher plant TF databases, with only Arabidopsis, rice and
poplar having more complete TF analysis to date [13]. The
data will provide a major resource for the study of gene
expression in tobacco and the Solanaceae and will also
facilitate studies of TF families across the plant kingdom.
The current version will be updated regularly to improve
the dataset of tobacco TFs. The main page for TOBFAC is
the main web interface for all information contained in
the database (see Figure 2). It contains introductory information about both tobacco and the GSR project conducted by the TGI. Links at the top of the main page
enable downloading of both the complete set of TOBFAC
sequences and the complete set of sequences that were
used in the searches to find them. It is also possible to
download the complete list of predicted tobacco genes
and the Genbank entries for their individual constituent
GSRs. There are also links to the homology search page,
the published tobacco TF page and the list of publications
on tobacco TFs. The published tobacco TF page contains a
list of published tobacco TF genes sorted by gene family
and with hotlinks to both Genbank and PubMed entries.
The list of publications on tobacco TFs is reached via a
hotlink on the main page and contains publications again
sorted by gene family and with hotlinks to PubMed
entries and/or PDF files for all publications. A list of all 64
available TF gene families is present on the main page
together with the minimum number of tobacco genes in
each family. The TF family names link to the individual TF
family pages.
The individual TF family pages
Each TF family has its own dedicated page (see Figure 3)
that contains all sequences from this group. A button at
the top of the page links to the complete list of sequences
in the gene family. Other buttons allow downloading of
the phylogenetic tree file, either with or without bootstrap
values, and a JPEG of the phylogenetic tree. A short introduction describes the family and there is also a link to the
family's Pfam accession. All predicted sequences are presented, together with what parts of the gene they each contain. An explanation of how the minimum number of
genes in this gene family was calculated from this total
number of sequences is also present. Below the introduction, each individual gene is listed together with links to
the Genbank entries for every individual GSR that makes
up this gene. The gene name links to the individual page
for the gene itself. There is also a list of papers that relate
to this familt in tobacco, complete with links to their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/53

PubMed entries. At the bottom of each TF family page is a
list of all published tobacco genes that belong to this family, together with links to the Genbank entries for these
genes. This wealth of tobacco-related features should provide the user with most of the available information on
this gene family in tobacco together with several different
ways to utilise the TOBFAC sequences.
The individual gene pages
Each TF family page lists all of the genes in that family in
the TOBFAC database. Each gene name links to a page
dedicated to that gene that contains a wealth of information designed to aid research into that gene. At the top of
the page is the DNA sequence of the gene in fasta format
followed by a six frame translation of the sequence. Below
that is a link to the pfam accession page. If a gene has
already been published, this is stated together with the
name that it was published under and links to PubMed
and Genbank entries for the gene. This enables integration
of all available data on TOBFAC genes that have already
been published. Additional data on the predicted gene
follows with results from searches of the EST data and
Genbank. The top hits are presented, together with their
definition lines, and links to the database entries for the
sequences. Below the searches are links to all Genbank
entries of all of the individual GSRs that make up the predicted genes. Finally, the individual gene pages also contain the complete lists for the gene family of both relevant
papers and published genes. Each individual gene page
therefore integrates a large amount of data from multiple
sources, contains multiple functionalities and provides a
one-stop-shop environment for research into each of the
2,882 TOBFAC TF sequences.
The homology search page
The homology search page is reached via a link on the
main page and is a local installation of the NCBI BLAST
program that allows searching against the TOBFAC
sequences. It can also be used to search the 46,546
tobacco EST sequences from the ESTobacco project [18] or
the tobacco unigenes from Genbank. The integration of
these datasets facilitates a "one stop shop" approach to the
study of tobacco TFs. We have also performed BLAST
searches with the TOBFAC sequences against the ESTobacco EST sequences. A total of 557 of the TOBFAC
tobacco TFs are supported by EST sequences (see Figure
5). A list of TOBFAC genes that are supported by ESTs is
available via a link on the main page.
The published tobacco TF page
TOBFAC aims to contain information on all known
tobacco TF genes. This includes not only information
from the TGI GSR project and EST sequences but also a list
of published tobacco TF genes. The published tobacco TF
page contains a list of published tobacco TF genes sorted

Page 5 of 7

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:53

by gene family and with hotlinks to both Genbank and
PubMed entries. This list of genes facilitates the integration of data from multiple sources. Some care should be
exercised, however, when comparing published
sequences with GSR sequences because different ecotypes
have been used in many cases and also published
sequences have been obtained from the BY-2 cell line. For
some of the larger gene families, we have tried to integrate
published and GSR sequences, and although this has
often been successful, this was not always the case. For
this reason, future versions of the TOBFAC dataset will
primarily be centered on GSR data and corresponding EST
sequences.
The list of publications on tobacco TFs
TOBFAC is designed not only to be a database of all
known tobacco TF sequences, but also a knowledge base
of all tobacco TF-related material. A list of publications on
tobacco TFs is reached via a hotlink on the main page and
contains publications sorted by gene family and with hotlinks to PubMed entries and/or PDF files. Over half of the
tobacco TF families have no published literature concerning them and this illustrates how the information contained in TOBFAC will facilitate novel areas of research in
tobacco.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/53

Gene space sequences have been published for maize, sorghum and cowpea [2,3,5] and the near future will see this
number increase. The computational pipeline described
in this article (see Figure 1) can be widely applied to any
new GSR dataset and modified to include any new families of TFs as they are discovered. We believe it to be a
robust method that increases the chances of isolating TF
gene sequences from GSR datasets, especially for short or
incomplete sequences and divergent members of gene
families. This is in contrast to other approaches that use
stringent filtering processes to avoid false-positives but
can thereby fail to identify up to 20% of TF genes [13].
Future plans and releases
The current version of TOBFAC is based on 1,159,022
GSRs obtained from the TGI website. As additional GSRs,
ESTs and BAC sequences become available, we will integrate these new sequences into TOBFAC and update both
TF family data and phylogenetic analyses. Microarraybased transcription profiling is currently being performed
for tobacco and expression data for TFs will also be
included in future versions of TOBFAC.

Discussion and Conclusion
Genome-related public databases are invaluable to the scientific community and transcriptional regulation of gene
expression is a major control point in many biological
processes. Databases that contain information on complete or near-complete complements of TFs are major
resource for the plant research community but this does
not currently include a member of the Solanaceae, one of
the most important families of vascular plants. TOBFAC
fills this void and contains the majority of tobacco TFs (a
minimum of 2,513) from 64 gene families together with
extensive data on each gene family. TOBFAC integrates
these TF sequences with published tobacco TFs, scientific
literature on tobacco TFs, phylogenetic trees and EST data.
The aim is to make TOBFAC the database of choice for
transcription-related projects in tobacco and an important
resource for projects in other members of the Solanaceae.
The availability of all, or nearly all, members of TF families from several species will facilitate the study of their
biological functions, phylogenetic relationships, and the
evolution of their DNA-binding domains [12]. The dataset contained within TOBFAC has already been used for
phylogenetic analysis of the ERF, WRKY, NAC, homeodomain, bZIP, bHLH, R2R3MYB, CONSTANS, ZIM, Dof and
MADS box genes. These phylogeneies have been successfully used to both predict gene function and to find novel
subfamilies of TF genes (Rushton, P.J., manuscript in
preparation).
