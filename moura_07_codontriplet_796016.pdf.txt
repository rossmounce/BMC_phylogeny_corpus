Abstract
Background: The evolutionary forces that determine the arrangement of synonymous codons
within open reading frames and fine tune mRNA translation efficiency are not yet understood. In
order to tackle this question we have carried out a large scale study of codon-triplet contexts in
11 fungal species to unravel associations or relationships between codons present at the ribosome
A-, P- and E-sites during each decoding cycle.
Results: Our analysis unveiled high bias within the context of codon-triplets, in particular strong
preference for triplets of identical codons. We have also identified a surprisingly large number of
codon-triplet combinations that vanished from fungal ORFeomes. Candida albicans exacerbated
these features, showed an unbalanced tRNA population for decoding its pool of codons and used
near-cognate decoding for a large set of codons, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces shaped
the evolution of its ORFeome.
Conclusion: We have developed bioinformatics tools for large-scale analysis of codon-triplet
contexts. These algorithms identified codon-triplets context biases, allowed for large scale
comparative codon-triplet analysis, and identified rules governing codon-triplet context. They
could also detect alterations to the standard genetic code.

Background
The degeneracy of the genetic code allows synthesis of
identical proteins from mRNAs with rather different primary structures. This bias in synonymous codon usage is
linked to tRNA abundance, codon-pair context effects,
genome G + C pressure, the strength of codon-anticodon
interactions, and to other DNA replication, transcription
and mRNA translation biases [1-5]. Interestingly, codonpair context fine tunes mRNA decoding efficiency [6-9].

For example, in E. coli, 3'context alteration from G to U in
the insertion sequence IS911 (A-AAA-AAG) increases
frameshifting from 10% to 60% [10], while, intriguingly,
the over-represented ACG-CUG codon-pair is translated
slower than the under-represented synonymous codonpair ACC-CUG [9].
Those context effects suggest that codon-pairs are important modulators of mRNA translation accuracy and speed.

However, codon-pairs cannot reflect the full bias imposed
by the translational machinery on mRNA primary structure since the ribosome has 3 rather than 2 decoding sites,
namely A-, P- and E-sites [11]. The A- and P-sites are
directly involved in aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) selection
and translocation and, for these reasons, it is not surprising that codon-pair context influences protein synthesis
fidelity. From a structural perspective, the role of the Esite, which is occupied by deacylated tRNA during exit
from the ribosome [12], on mRNA decoding speed and
accuracy is not so clear. However, E-site occupation does
influence decoding fidelity by changing allosterically the
affinity of the A-site during selection of in-coming aatRNAs [13-15]. This allosteric interaction between the Eand A- sites, plus ribosome crystallography and cryo-EM
studies [16], provide strong functional and structural evidence for a critical role of the 3 tRNAs accommodated in
the ribosome in decoding efficiency. In other words, the
E-site is more than just an exit site for deacylated tRNAs
from the ribosome. Hence, codon-triplets present in the
ribosome A-, P- and E-sites are expected to play an important role in the accuracy and efficiency of mRNA translation. If so, like codon-pair context, codon-triplet context
should be biased. This hypothesis is supported by the
observation
that
non-programmed
translational
frameshifting and programmed translational events
involve more than two consecutive codons (e.g. [8,10]).
In a previous study, we have developed software and statistical methodologies for analysis of codon-pair contexts
and have identified general rules that govern such context
[4]. In here, we have extended those studies to the analyses of codon-triplets context, using several fungal ORFeomes as model systems. This study produced very large
data sets and posed significant computational challenges,
which prompted the development of a dedicated database
for data storage and tools for data mining. We show for
the first time that context of codon-triplets is highly biased
and species specific and we discuss the implications of trinucleotide repeats for codon-triplets context. We also
explain how our approach can be used to identify nonstandard mRNA decoding events and alterations to the
genetic code.

Results
Tools to study codon-triplets
We have implemented computational algorithms and
data storage facilities for comparative genomics of codontriplet analysis in fungal genomes (Figure 1). The algorithm developed simulates the ribosome during decoding
by reading Open Reading Frames (ORFs), from the ATG
initiation codon, and moving the reading window three
nucleotides at a time until a stop codon is encountered.
While doing this, it memorizes all codon-triplets, which
represent A-, P- and E-site codons during mRNA decoding.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/444

In this study, triplet counting was performed on complete
sets of ORFs (ORFeomes), which were initially filtered to
eliminate aberrant ORFs lacking ATG initiation or TAG/
TGA/TAA stop codons, or containing premature stop
codons or ambiguous bases (N). The first and last triplets
of each ORF were not considered to avoid translation initiation and termination context effects [17,18].
Since analysis of codon triplets generates a 3-dimensional
61 × 61 × 61 matrix for each ORFeome, we have used a
relational database to store the processed data (Figure 1).
These large data sets were then analyzed using data mining tools [19] and direct database queries. These studies
aimed at identifying major differences in triplet-codon
context between the fungal ORFeomes stored in the main
database (Table 1). A similar methodology was used to
count amino acid triplets generated from the same ORFeome sequences. For this, codons were translated to the
respective amino acids using standard genetic code rules
or using non-standard decoding of the leucine-CTG
codons as serine in Candida albicans and Debaryomyces
hansenii [20-22]. Finally, new algorithms were implemented to count codon and amino acid repetitions on an
ORFeome wide scale. All results obtained were compared
with values expected for a random distribution of codons,
which were calculated considering the frequencies of random distribution of individual codons or amino acids in
the genomes.
Codon-triplets in fungal genomes
The tools described above permitted carrying out a comparative analysis of codon-triplets in 11 fungal ORFeomes
(Table 1). Clear patterns of codon-triplets preferences and
rejections were identified for each ORFeome and, as for
codon-pair contexts [4], such patterns were specific of
each ORFeome (Tables 2 and 3 and Additional file 1, Figure S1). This first analysis also showed that the percentage
of codon-triplets that vanished from the ORFeomes was
much higher than expected from random distribution of
the triplets in these ORFeomes (Figure 2A). The percentage of vanished codon-triplets varied between 8 and 11%
in most fungal ORFeomes, but was significantly lower in
Aspergillus fumigatus (0.5%), Eremothecium gossypii (2.9%)
and Saccharomyces mikatae (1.6%). The human pathogen
Candida albicans had higher percentage of such triplets
(16.5%) and those vanished codon-triplets were reflected
also at the amino acid level, since C. albicans was the only
species where an amino acid triplet, namely Trp-Met-Trp,
was absent. Conversely, analysis of the 10 most frequent
codon-triplets (Figure 2B) showed an even distribution in
these fungal ORFeomes with exception of C. albicans,
where the percentage of these abundant triplets increased
more than 2-fold (0.45%). Overall, in C. albicans there
was a clear over-representation of a subset of codon-triplets, namely (CAA-CAA-CAA), (GAA-GAA-GAA), (AAT-

Sequences were then processed by counting all codon-triplets, excluding the first and the last ones of each ORF, which have specific translation initiation and termination contexts. These data were transferred to a 3-dimensional 61 × 61 × 61 matrix and were saved as a Microsoft Access
Database file. The processed data were then analyzed using Weka-3 data mining tools [19] and direct database queries. This
methodology allowed us to handle very large data sets and identify differences in codon-triplet context between fungal species.
These differences were finally subjected to statistical analyses.

11 ORFeome sequences were downloaded from the web sites
indicated bellow between December 2005 and February 2006. Each
ORFeome was scanned for detection of invalid ORFs (see Methods),
lacking ATG-start and TAA, TAG and TGA stop-codons. ORFs
containing permature stop codons or undefined nucleotides (N) were
also discarded from the analysis.

Since codon-triplet choice was an ORFeome specific feature that could influence mRNA decoding efficiency (see
above), the stronger bias found in C. albicans prompted
the question of whether it could be linked to mRNA translation. In order to shed new light into this question,
codon usage bias and tRNA gene copy number, which
provides direct indication of tRNA expression level, were
determined at an ORFeome scale for all ORFeomes analyzed (Table 4). In C. albicans, there were fewer tRNA
genes (131), but the total number of codons was the second largest (2 939 109) of the ORFeomes set. Consequently, the relative tRNA abundance (given by gene copy
number) per codon (or per amino acid) was lower in C.

The complete set of codon-triplets present in the 11 fungal ORFeomes studied were identified and the codon-triplets were ranked according to the
difference between observed and expected values (bias). The 10 most preferred codon-triplets indicate that the codon-triplets with highest positive
bias are common in all fungal ORFeomes. For example, the strongly biased GAA-GAA-GAA triplet was preferred in 10 out of 11 fungal ORFeomes
(underscored). Also, codon-triplets containing identical codons were frequent (bold). Interestingly, the most common feature of these preferred
codon-triplets was the presence of a guanosine (G) at position 4 and 7 of the triplet (X1X2X3-Y4Y5Y6-Z7Z8Z9), a feature which was common to half
of the codon-triplets indicated below.

The complete set of codon-triplets present in the 11 fungal ORFeomes studied were identified and the codon-triplet contexts were ranked
according to the difference between observed and expected values (bias). This group of codon-triplets can be divided according to the presence or
absence of runs of more than 5 consecutive adenosines (underlined). Interestingly, the most common feature of these strongly repressed codon
triplets was the presence of an adenosine (A) at position 4 and 7 of the triplet (X1X2X3-Y4Y5Y6-Z7Z8Z9), a feature that appears in one third of the
codon-triplets shown below.

albicans than in the other fungi (Figure 3). For example,
the tRNAAsn gene had 4 copies in C. albicans and
between 4 and 10 copies in the other species, but the total
number of Asn codons was highest in C. albicans (Total
Asn codons = 201 917) (data not shown). In order to
determine whether this relative decrease in tRNA gene
copy number unbalanced tRNA abundance and codon
usage, we have calculated the relative synonymous codon
usage (RSCU) values for the entire set of codons (Additional file 2, Table S1), and the relative tRNA isoacceptor
usage (RIU) values. The later is equivalent to RSCU values
[23] but, since it was calculated using tRNA gene copy
number, it informed about tRNA abundance bias. That is,
different RIU values in a group of isoacceptors indicated
differences in cellular levels of these tRNAs. By restricting
the quotient RSCU/RIU to pairs of cognate-codons and
cognate-tRNAs, we were able to calculate a Decoding
Adaptation Quotient (DAQ = RSCU/RIU) by averaging
the quotients obtained for each codon/tRNA pair (see
Methods). DAQ values close to 1 indicated that codon

usage and tRNA gene copy number (tRNA abundance)
were well matched (high correlation), as was the case for
A. fumigatus, C. glabrata, E. gossypii, K. lactis, S. paradoxus or S. pombe (Additional file 1, Figure S2). Organisms with DAQ>>1 often used rare tRNAs to decode
frequently used codons as was the case for D. hansenii, S.
bayanus, S. cerevisiae or S. mikatae. Interestingly, C. albicans originated the lowest DAQ value (0.841) of all fungi
studied (Additional file 1, Figure S2), indicating that this
fungal pathogen prefers codons that are decoded by nearcognate rather than cognate tRNAs. The divergence of
decoding preferences between C. albicans and the other
fungi can be clearly exemplified for Asn codons (AAC and
AAU). All fungi analyzed decode both codons using a single tRNA (tRNAGUUAsn) and usually prefer the cognate
codon AAC, however, C. albicans had a strong preference
for AAU codons (RSCU = 1.435) over AAC (RSCU =
0.565), (Additional file 2, Table S1). That is, its most frequently used Asn codon is decoded by a near-cognate
tRNA (tRNAAsn GUU). This near-cognate decoding pref-

Relative tRNA gene copy number is lower in C. albicans than in other fungi. The tRNA gene copy number
was determined for each tRNA isoacceptor using tRNAscanSE [40], and the gene copy number of each group of isoacceptors was summed and divided by the number of times the
respective amino acid was present in each ORFeome. In
order to carry out comparisons between ORFeomes, data
obtained for individual amino acids was averaged into a single
column for each organism. Values are presented as tRNA

The relative low number of tRNA genes in C. albicans suggested that, either C. albicans regulates expression of certain tRNAs through yet unknown cis-acting elements and
uses novel polIII transcriptional activators (i.e., tRNA gene
copy numbers are not indicative of tRNA availability), or
its mRNA translation machinery works under tRNA limitation. In order to clarify these important points we have
scanned the 5'-upstream sequences of the C. albicans
tRNA genes and searched for conserved elements that
could explain tRNA up-regulation by the polIII transcriptional machinery. However, we were unable to identify
such putative conserved polIII enhancers (data not
shown). Therefore, one is left with the intriguing possibility that tRNA limitation and generalized near-cognate
decoding may yet be another unique feature of the C. albicans translational machinery. This may explain the strong
bias of C. albicans codon-triplet usage since, unlike in
other species, C. albicans maximizes the utilization of a
small subset of tRNAs to decode strongly biased codons
present in the triplets. This puzzling result requires experimental confirmation through in vivo tRNAs quantification to clarify whether tRNA limitation is a feature of the
C. albicans translational machinery, and, more importantly, whether such putative limited tRNA availability
increases decoding error [17,24,25]. We have discovered

Strings of repeated codons
The high frequency of repeated codons and amino acids
in fungal ORFeomes and the high percentage of triplets of
identical codons and amino acids in C. albicans (Figure
4A, B), prompted us to carry out a more detailed analysis
of the codon composition of such repetitions. For this, the
distribution of isolated codons, identical codon-pairs,
identical codon-triplets and identical codon-strings were
determined (Figure 5). Isolated codons were underrepresented in all ORFeomes, in particular in C. albicans (Figure
5A). However, this effect was minimized in pairs of iden-

recently that ambiguous decoding of the reassigned CUG
codon (serine + leucine) generates phenotypic diversity in
this human pathogen [26,27] and it will be most interesting to elucidate whether C. albicans uses generalized mistranslation as a strategy to expose hidden phenotypic
diversity. Finally, we cannot exclude that biases of codontriplets arise from protein primary structure constraints.
Indeed, our study on a genetic code alteration in C. albicans supports this hypothesis (see below). However, tripeptide biases would only be relevant for this study if they
were significantly different in C. albicans and this was not
observed. Rather, the main differences between C. albicans and the other species were related to a limited subset
of contexts with repeated codons and amino acids in consecutive positions (se bellow).

albicans and also in the other species we have computed separated the proportion of codons that appeared isolated or in
identical codon-pairs, -triplets or longer strings. C. albicans
had lower frequency of isolated codons (non-repeated identical codons) than the other species, although there was general repression of isolated codons in all species (panel A).

tical codons, where observed and expected (random distribution) values were similar (Figure 5B). In C. albicans,
the strong under-representation of isolated codons was
not visible in identical codon-pairs (Figure 5B), and that
bias was reversed and sharply increased for repetitions of
identical codon-triplets and identical codon-strings (Figure 5C, D). Indeed, the distribution of the latter was
remarkably different between C. albicans and the other
ORFeomes (Figure 5D).
We then analyzed the amino acid composition of the
repeated codon-triplets and again strong biases were
observed (Figure 6). Most repetitions involved the amino
acids Gln, Asp, Glu, Asn and Ser, confirming previous
observations in S. cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes
[28,29]. Repetitions of the amino acids Ala, Pro, His, Thr,

Specificity of amino acid repeats
Specificity of amino acid repeats. The degeneracy of the genetic code prompted us to determine whether amino acid
repeats would provide a better picture of the frequency of repeated features in the fungal ORFeomes. For this, the repeats
were quantified and displayed as shown. In the diagram, and for each species, the first line in each column from the top corresponds to cases in which the amino acid appeared isolated in ORFs. The second line corresponds to isolated pairs of identical
amino acids and so on, so that, for each column, higher number of lines correspond to longer amino acid strings. As expected,
amino acid repeats were biased, as indicated by the color scale used in the map, where light blue corresponds to repressed
repeats and the brown color indicates preferred repeats. Yellow represents repeats whose observed and expected frequencies
were similar. Amino acid repeats were amino acid specific. For example, Gln, Asp, Glu, Asn or Ser (first group on the left)
formed long strings more frequently than expected (brown), while strings of Phe, Ile, and Leu were repressed in all ORFeomes
(blue bars). C. albicans had the longest strings of almost all amino acids, in particular of Asn, Pro, His and Thr (highlighted in
grey, top of the diagram).

Finally, the distribution of the above repetitions was analyzed for synonymous codons of each amino acid (Additional file 1, Figures S3A,B). Of the most frequent amino
acid repetitions, Gln used CAA codons mainly in all but A.
fumigatus. Strings of Asn often used AAC codons, but
some ORFeomes preferred AAT codons (Additional file 1,
Figure S3A). Of the 6 serine codons, AGT, TCA and TCT
were the most commonly used, while Thr repetitions used
ACA or ACT but rarely ACC or ACG codons. The few Lys
repetitions observed used AAG codons almost exclusively
and repressed AAA codons, an effect that may be linked to
strong repression of homopolymeric strings, since repetitions of CCC, GGG and TTT codons were also strongly
repressed (Additional file 1, Figure S3B).
Composition of codon-triplets that vanished from
ORFeomes
The high proportion of triplets that vanished from fungal
ORFeomes (Figure 2A) prompted us to investigate
whether particular codon-context trends could be identified, which would explain repression of particular codon
combinations. For this, the codon composition of triplets
absent in each ORFeome, at the 3 different codon positions (XXX-YYY-ZZZ), was determined. No significant differences could be detected between ORFeomes or codon
positions, and the results obtained with codons starting
with any base (N) were redundant (data not shown). To
overcome this effect and highlight major effects only the
data was averaged. A well defined pattern of preferences
and rejections linked to the second and third bases of
codons in absent codon-triplets (Figure 7) became apparent. This indicated that the first base of the codon, and the
position of the codon in the triplet, did not contribute to
triplet disappearance. Conversely, codons ending with
two adenosines (NAA) showed poor association with
absent triplets, while NCC, NCG or NGN were strongly
associated to repressed codon triplets (Figure 7).

As before, CTG reassignment in C. albicans and D. hansenii
prompted us to investigate whether the unusual decoding
of CTG codons forced the disappearance of codon-tri-

Gly, Lys and Arg had an intermediate representation,
while those of Val, Phe Ile and Leu were often underrepresented and in certain ORFeomes repetitions of Tyr, Cys,
Met and Trp were absent or rarely used (Figure 6). Of all
amino acids, Gln was more frequent and was also rarely
present as an isolated amino acid across all ORFeomes
(blue bars, first column of Figure 6). Once more, C. albicans showed stronger bias for amino acid repetitions since
the number of Gln, Asp, Glu, Asn and Ser repetitions was
higher than in the other ORFeomes, while repetitions of
Pro, His and Thr, which were not frequent in the other
genomes, were frequent in the C. albicans genome (Figure
6).

Figure 7
Bias of codon-triplets that vanished from ORFeomes
Bias of codon-triplets that vanished from ORFeomes.
The number of possible codon-triplet combinations that
were not present in fungal ORFeomes was surprisingly high.
In order to elucidate why these triplets disappeared from
ORFeomes, the respective codons were further studied,
namely by counting the number of times each codon
appeared in the first, second or third position of the triplets.
No significant differences were found between species and
between codon-triplet positions. Also, the first base of all
codons originated redundant results. Therefore, values for all
ORFeomes, triplet positions, and also for all codons starting
with A, C, G or T were averaged. NCC, NCG and NGN

plets. For this, absent triplets that contained CTN codons,
i.e. CTA, CTC, CTG or CTT were studied (Additional file 1,
Figure S4). Each species had its preference pattern. The
CTA codon was absent mainly in triplets of A. fumigatus,
CTC in C. glabrata and Saccharomyces sp. and CTT in E. gossypii. Significantly, CTG codons were the most frequent
CTN codons in codon-triplets that vanished from C. albicans and D. hansenii ORFeomes (Additional file 1, Figure
S4A). Moreover, in D. hansenii the number of codon-triplets that vanished only from that ORFeome and lacked
CTGs was two fold higher than in the other fungi, including C. albicans (Additional file 1, Figure S4B).
Genetic code alteration signature
In C. albicans and D. hansenii leucine CTG codons are
decoded as serine [20-22]. This genetic code alteration
appeared approximately 272 ± 25 million years ago in the
yeast ancestor and reprogrammed more than 30,000
CTGs present in its genes [30]. Such dramatic genetic
event imposed negative pressure on CTG usage and eliminated most of these codons. Interestingly, a high number
of "old" leucine-CTGs were replaced by "new" serineCTGs that evolved from mutation of serine rather than
leucine codons [30]. In other words, the CTGs existent in

Discussion
Context of codon-triplets
The close phylogenetic relationship of the fungi used in
this study supports the hypothesis that, like codon-pair
contexts, codon-triplet contexts are species specific. If
codon-triplet contexts fine tune ribosome decoding efficiency, as we have hypothesized, then it is likely that the
translation machinery of these fungal species imposes different pressure on codon-triplet context. This is in line
with the finding that overexpression of genes in heterologous hosts is sometimes remarkably difficult to achieve
due to differences in codon usage and other yet poorly
understood translational constraints [31,32]. Moreover,
the fidelity of heterologous protein synthesis is often
affected by codon-pair context [31], which is also species
specific [33], and, since the ribosome has 3 tRNA binding
sites, one would expect that codon-triplet context specificity is indeed required to fine tune mRNA decoding efficiency.

Despite the species specificity found, common trends of
codon-triplet context were observed in fungal ORFeomes.
For example, CC- and CG-ending codons and codons
containing guanosine in the middle position, i.e. NGN
(Figure 7, red bars) were repressed in codon-triplets. Con-

Contexts of the NNN-Leu-NNN and NNN-Ser-NNN types
were identified in the ORFeomes set and the values were
displayed in such a way that upstream and downstream
rejected and preferred codon neighbors could be highlighted (Figure 8). This was carried out by determining
codon neighbor combinations (upstream and downstream) that were preferred in leucine- or serine-bearing
triplets (leucine and serine neighbor signatures) and computing the number of times each signature appeared
above the expected threshold, when the middle codon of
the triplet was CTG (Figure 8A). As expected, leucine and
serine had clear neighborhood preferences, but this context signature was lost for CTGs in C. albicans and D.
hansenii (blue boxes, Figure 8A), which decode leucineCTG codons as serine. In these species, CTGs had a signature that was not observed for leucine-CTA or serine-TCA
codons, used as external controls (Figure 8B, 8C).

Leucine preferred contexts

A

[(Obs-Exp)/Exp]

the ORFeomes of C. albicans and D. hansenii are new serine codons that appeared during the last 272 ± 25 million
years. Since serine codons are often present in codon repetitions while leucine codons are strongly repressed (Figure 6), we have taken advantage of this genetic code
alteration to shed new light on the evolutionary dynamics
of codon (amino acid) repetitions in yeasts. Furthermore,
since leucine is hydrophobic and serine polar, we hypothesized that constraints imposed by protein structure
would be visible as alterations in the context of CTG containing triplets.

Amino acid context signatures detect genetic code alteraAmino acid context signatures detect genetic code
alterations. In order to determine whether genetic code
alterations could originate a specific triplet signature, the frequencies of amino acid contexts having leucine or serine in
the middle position (ex. LYS-LEU-ASP/LYS-SER-ASP) were
subtracted. Whenever this difference was higher than 0.0005
or lower than -0.0005 the respective context was considered
biased towards leucine or serine, respectively. These biased
neighborhoods were checked for Leu/Ser-CTG, Leu-CTA
and Ser-TCA codons. The expected values were calculated
for all the contexts and subtracted from the observed values.
In order to normalize the bias with the total pool size for
each codon-context each difference was divided by the
expected value [(Obs-Exp)/Exp]. The sum of the quotients of
all leucine-preferred (yellow bars) and serine-preferred (red
bars) neighborhoods for each ORFeome showed the global
effect. As expected, leucine CTG codons (panel-A) were
more frequent in leucine-preferred contexts (yellow bars)
than in serine-preferred ones (red bars). However, this signature was broken in C. albicans and D. hansenii, (where CTGs
are decoded as serine and not leucine) since CTGs were
associated with serine- rather than leucine-preferred neighbors. This trend was not detected in any other leucine or
serine codon (Ex: Leu-CTA and Ser-TCA, panels-B and -C,
respectively), indicating that genetic code alterations can be
detected through codon-triplet context analysis.

versely, codons ending with two adenosines, i.e. NAA,
were rare in codon-triplets that vanished from these fungal ORFeomes (Figure 7, yellow bar). The position of each
codon in the triplet and the nature of the nucleotide at the
first codon position, which strongly influenced codon-

pair context [4] were not relevant in vanished codon-triplet contexts. Conversely, the last and middle nucleotides
of each codon influenced those codon-triplet contexts
(Figure 7). Variation in the last position of codons produced most codon usage biases because nucleotide
changes at this position are often silent [34], but changes
in the middle position of codons frequently result in
amino acid changes in protein sequences [35]. Therefore,
the apparent role of the third codon position on codontriplet context may be linked to codon usage bias, while
the role of the middle nucleotide of codons may be
related to protein structure constraints. When the later
constraint was removed from our data set by considering
synonymous codons only (Additional file 1, Figure S4), C
+ G pressure (A. fumigatus and K. lactis) and the C. albicans
and D. hansenii genetic code alteration appeared as important modulators of codon-triplet context. Indeed, G + C
pressure seems to be the reason for the enrichment of vanished codon triplets in codons ending with A or T in A.
fumigatus and in G or C in K. lactis (Additional file 1, Figure S4A), a result which is inline with the global GC% of
both ORFeomes (GC% = 54,01 and GC% = 40,10, respectively). In C. albicans and D. hansenii repression of triplets
containing CTG codons was clearly visible, indicating that
the genetic code alteration increases discrimination of
CTG-associated contexts. Codon-triplets that were absent
in D. hansenii only (Additional file 1, Figure S4B) contained twice the number of CTG-bearing codon-triplets,
suggesting that non-standard decoding of CTG as serine
had stronger impact in D. hansenii than in C. albicans
ORFeomes.
Strings of repeated codons
Apart from codon-triplet contexts, our software tools
detected strings of repeated codons (Figures 4, 5). Tandem
codon repeats are frequent in eukaryotic protein coding
DNA [29] and result from slippage of the DNA polymerase δ during genome replication [36]. Such repetitions are
also present in non-coding DNA in the form of trinucleotide repeats and, therefore, are unrelated to codon
decoding by the ribosome [28,37]. Indeed, they are much
more frequent in non-coding sequences, which contain
greater variety of tandem repeats (especially from 1–6 bp)
[37]. Despite this, one was prompted to ask whether tandem codon repeats could have a negative impact on
decoding fidelity. For example, could ribosome
frameshifting and drop off increase at codon strings due
to depletion of tRNAs during decoding of repeated
codons? If so, translation of the very high number of
codon-strings in the C. albicans genome (Figure 5) would
be problematic. This hypothesis was supported by the low
relative abundance of tRNAs necessary to decode such
repeated codon-strings (Figure 3). Indeed, of the 10 most
preferred codon-triplets in C. albicans, 7 corresponded to
contexts of repeated codons (Table 2) whose decoding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/444

involves low abundance tRNAs (either cognate or nearcognate), as, for example, the above mentioned Asn
codons, AAC and AAT.
The amino acids involved in formation of codon-strings
in C. albicans and other organisms were identical, namely
Gln, Asp, Glu, Asn and Ser [28,29] (Figure 6). However, in
C. albicans Pro, His and Thr also formed repetitions that
were not observed in other organisms. Also, there was
codon discrimination within amino acid repetitions
(Additional file 1, Figure S3A,B). For example, in almost
all ORFeomes studied Gln-CAA was more frequent than
expected while its synonymous Gln-CAG was repressed
(Additional file 1, Figure S3A). In C. albicans, Thr-ACA and
Thr-ACT codons were frequently used in Thr-strings, while
the Thr-ACC and Thr-ACG codons were not (Additional
file 1, Figure S3A). This preference for certain codons
within amino acid runs, suggests bias in DNA polymerase
δ slippage or, alternatively, identical codon-repetitions
produced during genome replication were later polished at
the 3rd codon position by positive pressure arising from
the translation process.
Finally, in all ORFeomes studied, acidic amino acids were
present more often than basic amino acids in amino acid
runs, the hydrophobic amino acids Phe, Ile or Leu did not
form repetitions (Figure 6) and runs of amino acids
formed by homopolymeric codon strings, i.e. AAA, CCC,
GGG or TTT (Additional file 1, Figure S3B) were also
strongly repressed, as already observed in other eukaryotic
genomes [29,37]. Since the latter corresponded to
frameshifting-prone contexts [8,10,38] it is likely that
their repression is related to translation fidelity. For example, the A AAA AAG motif found in dnaX and in many
insertion sequences of the IS3 family has been considered
the most efficient heptameric -1 shift motif in E. coli [10].
Leucine vs serine context signatures
C. albicans and D. hansenii non-standard serine-CTG and
standard leucine-CTG codons of the other fungal ORFeomes had divergent triplet-context preferences (Figure 8).
The Ser-CTG codons of C. albicans and D. hansenii had
codon neighbors typical of serines rather than leucines,
indicating that these residues have clear neighbor preferences (upstream and downstream) and that the alteration
of identity of the CTG codon from leucine to serine reshaped the context of the codon-triplets containing CTGs.
This implies that sense-to-sense genetic code alterations
are accompanied by alteration in the context (upstream
and downstream) of the codons that change identity to
maintain amino acid triplet signatures (amino acid context). This may minimize the negative impact of genetic
code alterations on protein structure and indicates that triplet amino acid context signatures are efficient tools to
predict genetic code alterations.

Conclusion
Our methodology to study codon-triplet context permitted carrying out large scale comparative analyses of triplets in 11 fungal genomes. Like codon-pair context,
codon-triplet context is biased and such bias is maximal
in the main human pathogen C. albicans. The data
unveiled the nature and extent of codon repetitions in
fungal ORFeomes and identified important differences in
codon repetitions between fungal species. C. albicans
showed the highest frequency and the longest codon repetitions and used codons in some repetitions that were
not found in other fungi. Interestingly, codon-triplet contexts had specific signatures that were not observed for the
CUG codon, which was reassigned from leucine to serine
in C. albicans and D. hansenii. Such signatures highlight
genetic code alterations in newly sequenced genomes.

Methods
Three-codon contexts
ORFeome sequences were retrieved from NCBI Genbank,
the Broad Institute and from the Candida Genome database (Table 1). ORF sequences that did not start with the
ATG codon, did not end with one of the 3 stop codons
inframe (TAA, TGA, TAG) or had internal stop codons or
undefined bases (N), were discarded from the dataset. For
data processing, we have developed an algorithm that
fixes the frame at the initiation codon (ATG) and reads the
3 first inframe codons (reading window). It then moves
the reading window one codon at a time in the 3'direction
and memorizes all triplets until it encounters a stop
codon. The algorithm reads entire ORFeomes but discards
the first and last 3 codons which have specific contexts
necessary for efficient translation initiation and termination (e.g. [39]). The results obtained were stored in a tridimensional array of 61 × 61 × 61 dimension, which was
represented by cod(i, j, k), where i, j and k were codons of
the first, second and third position, respectively (Figure
1). The values stored in the array corresponded to the
number of times that a particular triplet appeared in one
ORFeome. Similarly, a matrix of 20 × 20 × 20 dimension
was built for amino acid triplets.

Since tandem codon repetitions were prominent in all
genomes and introduced noise in the codon-triplet analysis, repetitions of more than 3 consecutive codons were
excluded from the analysis during a second round of data
processing. For this, the algorithm was modified as illustrated in Figure 9. The above methodology was also used
for amino acid triplet counting. However, the ignored triplets present in strings were counted separately to evaluate
the composition and length of each amino acid (codon)
string. The results obtained for each ORFeome were stored
as an array of m × 61, where m represents the maximum
string length found in that ORFeome and the stored values correspond to the number of times each codon or

were excluded from the analysis by analyzing four consecutive codons at each step. At each iteration, the presence of
identical codons forming 4 consecutive triplets was verified

appeared in the ORF sequence.

amino acid appeared in sequences from 1 to m. The data
arrays built by the algorithms described above were stored
in a database to facilitate subsequent data analysis, which
was performed using the Weka-3 package for data mining
[19] and direct queries to the database (Figure 1).
Final results are shown together with expected non-biased
results. To calculate the latter, we used the frequency of
the respective codons or amino acids in the total ORFeome, which corresponds to the probability of their random appearance in each ORFeome. So, the expected
frequency for any 3-codon context, codon1-codon2codon3, would be the product of the frequencies of the
individual codons, F(codon1)*F(codon2)*F(codon3).
tRNA genes
tRNA genes were identified using the tRNAscan-SE software package for tRNA identification and gene copy
number quantification [40]. This freeware software was
used as a standalone platform, which we have modified
slightly to scan several genomes automatically. The gene
copy number of each tRNA isoacceptor was calculated and
compared to the total number of cognate codons present
in coding sequences for each species. This provided a relative measure of tRNA availability in each organism. For
this, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values
were calculated for all codons, according to Sharp and Li
[23]. Briefly, the RSCU of a codon (X) represents the
number of times it appears in a sequence (observed

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:444

usage), divided by the expected usage value, assuming
random usage of synonymous codons for the corresponding amino acid (C). Therefore, RSCU values for a group of
synonymous codons are similar if there is no codon usage
bias, but become divergent when there is codon usage
bias. Since there is a strong relationship between codon
usage and tRNA abundance in bacteria and in S. cerevisiae
[2], we have used a new index to determine whether such
relationship was maintained in the fungal genomes under
study. For this, we have calculated the "relative isoacceptor usage" (RIU) values for all tRNAs, through the methodology below:

where Xij is the tRNA gene copy number for the jth anticodon for the ith amino acid, and ni is the number of isoacceptors for the same amino acid. We assumed that tRNA
abundance is directly proportional to tRNA gene copy
number, as is the case in S. cerevisiae and other eukaryotes
[41]. As for RSCUs, RIU values for each group of isoacceptors are similar when tRNA gene copy is not biased and
different when tRNA gene copy number for each tRNA
isoacceptor is biased.
Finally, a decoding adaptation quotient (DAQ), which
quantified the relationship (adaptation) between codon
usage and tRNA abundance, was calculated by dividing
RSCU by RIU values of cognate codon/tRNA pairs (DAQ
= RSCU/RIU). DAQ values of 1 indicate a perfect match
between tRNA copy number and codon usage, while a
DAQ>1 indicates that highly used codons (high RSCU)
are decoded by tRNAs whose gene copy number is low
(low abundance; low RIU), and DAQ<1 indicates that
codons that are used less frequently (low RSCU) are
decoded by abundant tRNAs (high gene copy number;
high RIU).
