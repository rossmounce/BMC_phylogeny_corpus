Abstract
Background: Jatropha curcas L. is promoted as an important non-edible biodiesel crop worldwide. Jatropha oil,
which is a triacylglycerol, can be directly blended with petro-diesel or transesterified with methanol and used as
biodiesel. Genetic improvement in jatropha is needed to increase the seed yield, oil content, drought and pest
resistance, and to modify oil composition so that it becomes a technically and economically preferred source for
biodiesel production. However, genetic improvement efforts in jatropha could not take advantage of genetic
engineering methods due to lack of cloned genes from this species. To overcome this hurdle, the current gene
discovery project was initiated with an objective of isolating as many functional genes as possible from J. curcas by
large scale sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
Results: A normalized and full-length enriched cDNA library was constructed from developing seeds of J. curcas.
The cDNA library contained about 1 × 106 clones and average insert size of the clones was 2.1 kb. Totally 12,084
ESTs were sequenced to average high quality read length of 576 bp. Contig analysis revealed 2258 contigs and
4751 singletons. Contig size ranged from 2-23 and there were 7333 ESTs in the contigs. This resulted in 7009
unigenes which were annotated by BLASTX. It showed 3982 unigenes with significant similarity to known genes
and 2836 unigenes with significant similarity to genes of unknown, hypothetical and putative proteins. The
remaining 191 unigenes which did not show similarity with any genes in the public database may encode for
unique genes. Functional classification revealed unigenes related to broad range of cellular, molecular and
biological functions. Among the 7009 unigenes, 6233 unigenes were identified to be potential full-length genes.
Conclusions: The high quality normalized cDNA library was constructed from developing seeds of J. curcas for the
first time and 7009 unigenes coding for diverse biological functions including oil biosynthesis were identified.
These genes will serve as invaluable genetic resource for crop improvement in jatropha to make it an ideal and
profitable crop for biodiesel production.

Background
Jatropha curcas L., one of the 175 species in genus
Jatropha of the family Euphorbiaceae is a perennial
small tree or large shrub native to tropical America and
is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of
Asia and Africa [1]. Recently, jatropha oil is promoted
as alternative transport fuel which can be directly
blended with petro-diesel or transesterified with

methanol and used as biodiesel. From a global food
security point of view, jatropha being a non-edible crop
which can be grown in areas not suitable for agriculture,
is a preferred source for biodiesel feedstock as it does
not compete with production of food crops. It reduces
the dependence on fossil fuel which is often imported
by using precious foreign currency. Its decentralized
production will provide income for a large number of
small and marginal farmers. Biodiesel is also less harmful to the environment in that its production and combustion reduces emission of greenhouse gases by 41%
relative to fossil fuel [2]. It is reported that biodiesel

emits less particulate matter than diesel upon combustion [3]. In fact, large scale jatropha cultivation will
improve the environment by greening the area and
transforming the wasteland to productive land by preventing soil erosion, causing accumulation of organic
matter, increasing soil microbial activity, etc.
The demand for biodiesel production is very huge that
it cannot be met from wild grown plants. Increasing the
jatropha production requires both to bring more area
under cultivation and to enhance productivity. Though
jatropha can grow and survive in wasteland with less
water, nutrient, and virtually no pest and disease management, productive growth and better yield under
restrictive environmental conditions require the development of resilient genotypes. Genotypes with improved
drought tolerance are preferred for plantations in marginal lands. Large scale plantations may bring in new
challenges which need to be addressed. It was reported
that J. curcas planted in continuous stretches as a
monocrop were devastated by flower and seed feeding
insects Scutellera nobilis and Pempelia morosalis [4].
This indicates that plant breeding programs to develop
pest and disease resistance are required when large scale
cultivation of jatropha is planned.
In addition, jatropha oil composition itself may have
to be modified to make it the best feedstock for biodiesel production. Oils with more of saturated fatty acids
give higher cetane number, and oxidative stability which
are desirable for combustion/ignition quality and shelf
life of biodiesel, respectively. But jatropha oil contains
less of saturated fatty acids (21.6%) and more of unsaturated fatty acids (78.4%) [5]. While viscosity of petrodiesel is 2.6 mm2/s, it is 4.8 mm2/s for biodiesel derived
from jatropha oil. Viscosity affects atomization of the
fuel upon injection into the combustion chamber, and
thereby, increases the formation of engine deposits [6].
More the carbon number of saturated fatty acids higher
will be the viscosity. Jatropha contains 84.5% 18-carbon
fatty acids and only 14.9% 16-carbon fatty acids [5]. It is
possible to make significant changes in the jatropha oil
composition by genetic engineering of the metabolic
pathway of oil biosynthesis. Therefore, there is a need
and scope for genetic improvement of jatropha by using
plant breeding and genetic engineering methods.
Genetic intervention in jatropha requires understanding of the biosynthetic pathways, metabolic flux control
points, cloning of the genes that code for the enzymes
and proteins involved in the metabolic pathways and
development of molecular markers. Molecular studies
in jatropha are limited and only a few genes have been
isolated from jatropha [7,8]. Currently, the dbEST of
NCBI contains only 250 annotated Expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) from jatropha. We have initiated a gene
discovery project by large scale sequencing of ESTs.

ESTs are short, single pass sequence reads from 5’or 3’
end of randomly selected cDNA clones. Sequencing of
ESTs has been successfully employed in several plants
including tomato [9], citrus [10], castor [11], arabidopsis [12], rice [13], water melon [14], radish [15] with
the objective of gene discovery, metabolic pathway
interpretation, gene cloning, molecular marker development, construction of genetic and physical map and
comparative mapping and analysis. When sequencing
of ESTs is employed for gene discovery purpose, normalization of the cDNA library will greatly increase the
efficiency and economy of the process. Normalization
reduces the frequency of abundant genes (hundreds of
mRNA copies per cell) and enriches the library with
rare genes (< 10 mRNA copies per cell) [16]. Since
sequencing of ESTs is carried out with the ultimate
objective of cloning the genes, it would be highly desirable to combine the normalization with enrichment for
full-length clones. This paper reports construction of a
normalized and full-length enriched cDNA library from
developing seeds of J. curcas and isolation of 7009 unigenes by sequencing of 12,084 ESTs.

Results and Discussion
Construction of cDNA Library

Construction of cDNA library and sequencing of ESTs
helps in rapid gene discovery especially in non-model
organisms where no prior sequencing data is available.
Next generation sequencing technologies can circumvent the need for constructing cDNA libraries and generate extraordinarily huge amount of sequencing data to
further speed up the gene discovery process. However,
sequencing of cDNA clones has several advantages over
the next generation sequencing methods such as higher
average read length, virtually no assembly problem, ability to isolate full length genes without going for RACE
PCR and availability of physical clones for further characterization and applications.
For the present study, a normalized and full-length
enriched cDNA library was constructed from developing
seeds of J. curcas. The normalization efficiency was
monitored by using chloramphenicol reporter gene.
Before normalization, the reporter gene was added to
the cDNA population to a redundant rate of about 1%
which was found to be reduced to less than 0.025% after
normalization. This indicated 40 fold reduction in abundance due to normalization. This normalization will
greatly help to enrich the library for rare genes. In addition, it will increase the rate recovery of unigenes and
reduce the cost of sequencing by avoiding redundant
clones. In fact, the rate of recovery of unigenes in this
study was about 58% (7009 unigenes out of 12,084
ESTs) which is much higher than 30 to 40% reported
from non-normalized cDNA libraries [11,17,18].

Natarajan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:606
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/606

The cDNA library can be more efficiently used for
gene discovery if normalization is combined with
enrichment for full-length genes. This was done by
removing cDNAs smaller than 0.5 kb. Removal of smaller fragments will also increase the cloning efficiency of
longer cDNAs. The cDNA library constructed for this
study was estimated to contain about 1 × 10 6 clones.
Ninety six clones were randomly selected to test for the
enrichment of full-length genes in these clones. The
insert size ranged between 0.8 kb and 3.2 kb with an
estimated average insert size of 2.1 kb (Figure 1).
BLASTX analysis of the sequences revealed that 94% of
the clones could potentially encode for full-length genes.
These results indicated that this cDNA library could be
reliably used for the gene discovery project in jatropha.
Sequencing of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs)

From the normalized and full-length enriched cDNA
library, 13,220 clones were patched for plasmid DNA
isolation. Clones which did not grow in the selection
medium or did not yield sufficient quantity or quality of
plasmid DNA were discarded. Plasmid DNA suitable for
sequencing was isolated from 12,810 clones. These
clones were sequenced using M13 reverse primer (CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC) which directly reads the cDNAs
from the 5’ end. Nucleotide bases having Phred value
less than 20 were discarded. Vector backbone and additional sequences that were added during cDNA

synthesis were removed. After the trimming exercise
144 empty clones (resulted in 0 bases after trimming)
and 12,084 high quality ESTs were obtained. The read
length of the high quality ESTs ranged between 105 bp
and 874 bp with an average length of 576 bp which is
comparable with other reports [19,20,18].
Contig Assembly of ESTs

Contig assembly of the 12, 084 ESTs was done to
remove the redundant ESTs so that the unique ESTs
(unigenes) can be annotated. The summary of the contig
assembly is given in Table 1. It showed 2258 contigs
and 4751 singletons. The contig size ranged between 2
and 23 (Figure 2) and there were 7333 ESTs in the 2258
contigs indicating the presence of 5075 redundant ESTs.
The 2258 contigs were manually checked and the longest EST from each contig was selected as unigene.
These representative ESTs from contigs and the 4751
singletons together resulted in 7009 unigenes from the
12,084 ESTs assembled.
Sequencing of ESTs from developing seeds often
showed the abundance of genes coding for seed storage proteins [11,21,22]. On the contrary, the current
study the showed the abundance of genes related to
stress response, disease resistance and plant development (Table 2). The largest contig contained 23 ESTs
coding for phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase
which is essential for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis.
It is reported that 60.5% phospholipid in jatropha seed
is composed of phosphatidylcholine [23]. Phosphatidylcholine is hydrolyzed into phosphatidic acid and choline. Phosphatidic acid acts as second messenger in
stress signaling, and choline is a precursor for glycine
betaine synthesis. Glycine betaine is a compatible
solute and its accumulation is widely reported to confer salt and oxidative stress [24,25]. Other contigs contained ESTs coding for indole-3 acetic acid amido
synthetase, ccr4 associated factor, ethylene responsive
transcription factor and calcineurin B which are also
involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants
[26-29]. The contigs also represented ESTs coding for
protein disulfide isomerase, copine and sucrose
synthase which are involved in seed development
[30,31] and seed size [32].

Annotation of Unigenes

In total, 3982 unigenes (56.8%) showing significant similarity with genes available in the non-redundant database were identified. Most of these unigenes showed
highest similarity with genes from castor (Ricinus communis). This is expected because jatropha itself is called
‘wild’ castor and both species belong to the family
Euphorbiaceae. Next to castor, most of the unigenes
showed similarity with genes from grape (Vitis vinifera)
that belongs to the family Vitaceae. Phylogenetic analysis using 10 selected ESTs by including orthologs from
five oilseed crops and V. vinifera also revealed that
J. curcas is closely related to R. communis followed by
V. vinifera (Figure 3, data shown for 3 genes). This association is totally unexpected according to the morphological system of classification [33] in which Jatropha
belongs to monochlamideae whereas Vitis belongs to
polypetalae. However, more recent Angiosperm Phylogeny Group Classifications, APGII and APGIII [34,35],
which are based on cladistic analysis of larger data sets
involving DNA sequences or other forms of systematic
data show many contradictory relationships [36].
According to these classifications, the malpighiales
(Euphorbiaceae) and Vitales (Vitaceae) are placed much
closer under a major core eudicots clade, Rosids. Our
data based on coding genes corroborate the APG classification with regard to Jatropha and Vitis.
Genes for oil biosynthesis and b-oxidation

Recently jatropha seed oil is widely used for biodiesel
production as an alternative renewable energy source. It
is important to undertake genetic improvement of this

crop to increase oil content, to modify the oil composition, to remove toxic compounds, to increase drought
tolerance etc. Seed oil content in brassica and arabidopsis has been increased by the overexpression of diacyl
glycerol acyl transferase, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase [37-39].
Seed oil composition has been changed in soybean by
using mutant 3-Keto-acyl-ACP synthase II gene which
increases the 16-carbon fatty acids and decreases 18carbon fatty acids [40]. Silencing of stearoyl-ACP desaturase has dramatically increased the content of saturated fatty acid (stearic acid) from 1.2% to 32% in
brassica [41]. Therefore, it is possible that increased oil
content and specialized seed oil composition can be
achieved in jatropha also, provided the genes involved
in rate limiting steps of oil biosynthesis pathway are
cloned. Important oil biosynthesis genes identified in
the present study include the genes involved in fatty
acid biosynthesis in plastids (carboxyl transferase of
ACCase b subunit, biotin carboxyl carrier protein of
ACCase, malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase, 3-keto acyl
ACP reductase, beta-keto acyl ACP synthase I, betaketo acyl ACP synthase II and acyl carrier protein),
desaturation of fatty acids (ω-3-fatty acid desaturase and
ω-6-fatty acid desaturase), hydrolysis of fatty acids from
acyl-ACP (acyl ACP thioesterase A), activation and
transport of free fatty acids to endoplasmic reticulum
(long chain acyl-CoA synthetase, acyl -CoA binding
protein) and serial incorporation of activated fatty acids
to the glycerol backbone to form triacylglycerol or oil
(glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase, lysophosphatidic
acid acyl transferase). Some of these genes are being

cloned in plant expression vector for functional evaluation in arabidopsis and tobacco. The unigene collection
also contained genes for acyl-CoA oxidase, enoyl-CoA
hydratase, b-hydroxyl acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and
acyl-CoA acetyl transferase which are involved in b-oxidation of fatty acids and their derivatives. Many of the
mutant studies revealed the importance of these
enzymes in the breakdown of reserve triacylglycerol,
seed development, seed germination, vegetative and
reproductive growth phases [42]. Hence the cloning of
the genes for beta oxidation pathway will be a valuable
source for the genetic manipulation of oil degradation
and plant growth.

Genes for crop improvement

Jatropha is a non-edible plant proposed to be grown in
areas not suitable for agriculture such as wasteland,
sides of railway track, lands with severe water scarcity,
saline areas etc. Hence jatropha should be able to withstand these stresses. Plants respond to these stresses by
modulating gene expression, which restores the cellular
homeostasis, detoxification and recovery of growth
[43,44]. For example, overexpression of betaine aldehyde
dehydrogenase gene conferred salt stress tolerance in
carrot, maize and tomato [45-47] and Zhang et al. [48]
showed that glycine betaine level is increased under
drought, heat and salt stresses in jatropha also.

Figure 3 Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the DNA sequences coding for (a) beta-keto acyl ACP synthase II, (b)
omega-3-fatty acid desaturase, and (c) beta-keto acyl ACP synthase I from J. curcas, R. communis, G.max, A. hypogaea, B. napus, H. annuus and V.
vinifera. Clone IDs (for J. curcas) and Genbank accession numbers were given in the parentheses.

When enzymes for glycine betaine biosynthesis are
expressed in plants that do not naturally produce glycine
betaine, they accumulate little glycine betaine, because
their endogenous choline supply is inadequate [49,50].
These plants may require overexpression of phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase to overproduce
choline. Overexpression of Na+/H+ antiporter from Pennisetum glaucum conferred high level of salinity tolerance in transgenic Brassica [51] and overexpression of E.
coli trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene conferred
drought and salt tolerance in rice [52]. The stress related
unigenes identified in the current study include the genes
coding for phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase,
Na+/H+ antiporter, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione s-transferase, spermidine
synthase, ethylene-responsive transcription factors, ascorbate peroxidase, late embryogenesis abundant proteins,
aquaporin, and salt tolerance protein.
The genes that code for the enzymes involved in different metabolic pathways are very important for genetic
manipulation in jatropha. Several genes involved in
diverse metabolic pathways such as phospholipids biosynthesis, flavanol synthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, HMP

shunt, glycogenesis were identified from the current
study. Other important genes identified from this study
are ferritin, mevalonate kinase, lipoxygenase, glutamate
decarboxylase, ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase, cinnamoylCoA reductase, zeta-carotene desaturase, gibberellin
2-oxidase, lipoic acid synthetase and beta-carotene hydroxylase. The unigenes also included 208 gene families with
3 or more genes. There were 15 families with more than
10 genes and a highest number of 46 members were
identified in serine-threonine kinase gene family. Other
gene families included glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase
precursor, aspartic proteinase nepenthesin-1 precursor,
calmodulin binding protein, F-Box family protein, WDrepeat protein, pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein, cytochrome P450 etc.
Genes with unknown functions

BLASTX results showed that 40.4% of J. curcas unigenes
(2836) are having significant similarity with genes that
code for unknown, hypothetical and putative proteins.
This is significantly higher than 13 to 25% unknown
genes reported in arabidopsis, citrus and oil palm
[12,53,54]. It was found that 2.8% of J. curcas unigenes

Natarajan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:606
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/606

(191) did not have significant similarity with any genes
available in the non-redundant database at NCBI. This
is significantly lower than 8 - 24% of such genes
reported in other plants [55,12,56]. These genes are very
important as they may be specific to jatropha.
Full-length unigenes

Almost all of the unigenes will be full-length at the 3’
end because first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out
using oliog-dT(15) primer which initiates synthesis from
poly (A) tail of the mRNAs. Therefore, full-length nature of the cDNAs at the 5’ end was analyzed using the
BLASTX results. This could be done for 6818 of the
7009 unigenes which showed significant similarity with
genes in the non-redundant database at NCBI. It was
found that 91.4% of the unigenes (6233) potentially code
for full-length genes. This is significantly higher than
60-75% full-length genes reported before [55,10,57]. The
remaining 191 unigenes that could not be analyzed by
BLASTX for lack of similarity with genes in the database at NCBI were analyzed by predicting open reading
frames (ORFs). In 14 unigenes, 5’UTR and single longest
ORF covering almost the entire lengths of the sequences
were identified (Figure 4). These unigenes could also be
considered as potential full-length unigenes. In 18 unigenes, 5’UTRs were present but the ORFs terminated
prematurely. We could not predict ORFs in the remaining 159 unigenes. These results show that the library is
highly enriched with full length genes that it can be
highly useful for gene discovery purpose.

profiles. The proportion of genes identified under each
class was comparable with A. thaliana genome except
those unigenes which were classified under ‘unknown
cellular components’ (Figure 5A). Majority of the unigenes were grouped under ‘other intra-cellular components’, ‘unknown cellular components’, ‘other
cytoplasmic components’ and ‘chloroplast’, which
accounted for about 55% of the unigenes. Though, nongreen tissue was used for the cDNA library construction,
about 12% of the unigenes belonged to chloroplast cellular component.
The unigenes were then classified according to their
involvement in 14 different biological processes such as
protein metabolism, developmental processes, response
to stress, transcription, signal transduction etc. These
processes are very important for a cell to live and reproduce. Hence, the genes that cover the biological processes are of great importance for functional study. It was
found that the larger part of the J. curcas unigenes were
grouped under ‘other cellular process’, ‘other metabolic
process’ and ‘unknown biological processes’ accounting
for 23.4%, 20.6% and 13.3%, respectively (Figure 5B).
The unigenes were finally classified under 15 different
molecular functions which mainly correspond to the
activities performed by the gene products from individual gene or group of genes such as transferase activity,
hydrolase activity, kinase activity, receptor binding,
receptor activity etc. Greater part of the unigenes was
classified under ‘unknown molecular function’, ‘other
enzyme activity’, ‘other binding’, ‘transferase activity’
which accounted for 49.3% of the unigenes (Figure 5C).

Functional Classification

Functional coverage of the unigenes was identified by
comparing the functional distribution of the genes from
fully sequenced A. thaliana genome. Unigenes were
searched against A. thaliana genome for functional
annotation and locus identifiers using BLASTN at
TAIR. The Gene Ontology annotations were assigned
for each unigene based on the locus identifiers using
GO annotation and categorization tool at TAIR. The
7009 unigenes from J. curcas were classified under three
broad functional categories using GO slim terms. Distribution of J. curcas unigenes and A. thaliana genome
under these three broad functional categories is shown
in Figure 5. This classification provides information on
percentage of J. curcas unigenes involved in the signal
transduction, anabolism, catabolism, reproduction and
so on. The results showed that the unigenes cover all
the GO slim terms in Arabidopsis.
The unigenes were first classified according their function in 16 different cellular compartments and anatomical structures such as endoplasmic reticulum, plastid,
mitochondria, nucleus, cell wall, golgi apparatus etc.
which may have unique genes or specific expression

Validation of ESTs

In order to validate the expression of ESTs, a set of 17
ESTs for representing oil biosynthesis genes were
selected and their expression was studied in roots,
mature leaves, flowers and developing seeds of J. curcas.
These ESTs were first sequenced from the 3’ ends and
primers specific to 3’UTR were designed to increase their
specificity to the respective transcripts. Gene expression
was studied by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and
actin was used as an internal control (Figure 6). The
results confirmed that the transcripts representing all
the selected ESTs are actively expressed in J. curcas. All
the transcripts were found to be expressed in all the tissues without significant variation in the level of expression, except ACP gene which showed significantly higher
expression in flower. O’Hara et al. [58] have also reported
that in flowers, the ACP gene is expressed at higher level
than the other genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis.

Conclusions
Normalized and full-length enriched cDNA library was
constructed and 12,084 clones were sequenced from

Figure 4 ORF analysis. The unigenes that did not show significant similarity to any genes in the protein database at NCBI were taken for ORF
prediction using ORF finder tool at NCBI to identify potential full-length unigenes. Putative ORFs were predicted for 32 unigenes and 14 of
them were found to be potential full-length unigenes.

J. curcas for the first time. From these sequences, 7009
unigenes were identified which included 6233 potential
full-length genes. These genes encoded for diverse biological functions in J. curcas including oil biosynthesis,
stress response, flavanol biosynthesis etc. These genes
will serve as invaluable resource for the genetic engineering to modify oil composition and to increase oil
content, seed yield, pest and disease resistance to make
jatropha more suitable for biodiesel production and
profitable to farmers. Gene discovery from other tissues
of J. curcas are being attempted by using next generation sequencing technology.

Methods
Collection of Seeds

Seeds in different developmental stages were collected
from Jatropha curcas fruits which were between 0.5 and
2.5 cm in diameter and green in colour (Figure 1). The
seeds were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-86°C until further use.
Isolation of Total RNA

Total RNA from developing seeds was prepared using
Trizol reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen, USA). One gram of the developing seeds
were ground with liquid nitrogen to a fine powder and
suspended in 10 ml Trizol reagent. The suspension was
mixed well, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Subsequently, 2 ml chloroform was added to the suspension
and incubated on ice for 10 min. The suspension was
centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube, and equal

volume of isopropanol was added. It was incubated at
-20°C for 1 h, and total RNA was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant
was discarded and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried and dissolved in 200 μl RNase free water. The
total RNA was further purified by using RNeasy Mini
Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Quality of total RNA was checked by
agarose gel electrophoresis as well as OD260/OD280 ratio
before using it for cDNA synthesis.
cDNA Synthesis and Normalization

Synthesis of full length cDNAs from total RNA and normalization were performed as described by Patanjali et al.
[59] and Soares et al. [60] with slight modifications. Two
cDNA preparations were made using the same total RNA.
One was used as tester cDNA and the other was used as
driver cDNA. First strand tester cDNA and driver cDNA
were synthesized using tester3 primer (CAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCGAGGCGGCCT15) and driver3
primer (GGGATAACAGGGTAATGGCCGAGGCGGC
CGACATGT15), respectively. Tester adaptor (GTAACTAGGCCGTAATGGCCACTCTGCGTTGATACCAC
TG) and driver adaptor (GGCCGTAATGGCCTCGCTACCTTAG GA) were ligated to the 3’end of the newly
synthesised first strand tester cDNA and driver cDNA,
respectively. These adaptors will ligate only to the 3’end
because, they were 5’phosphorylated and 3’blocked. Double strand tester cDNA was prepared by low cycling PCR
using tester3 primer and phosphorylated tester5 primer
(CAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCTAGTTACGGG) which is complementary to the 5’tester

Figure 5 Functional categorization of unigenes. GO annotations for 7009 unigenes of Jatropha were retrieved by submitting the list of locus
id for the unigenes obtained from BLAST search to the TAIR GO annotation search tool (GO Slim) at The Arabidopsis Information Resource
(TAIR). This resulted in the unigenes were functionally classified under three main functional categories: cellular component (A), molecular
function (B) and biological process(C) with respective GO Slim terms. The functional coverage of the Jatropha unigenes was also compared with
the arabidopsis genome for each category using GO Slim terms.

and SfiB (GGCCGAGGCGGCC) sites were introduced
between EcoRI and XhoI. The ligated plasmids were
transferred to E. coli DH10B-T1R (Invitrogen, USA) to
construct the cDNA library.
Normalization Efficiency

Normalization efficiency was strictly monitored by performing parallel normalization experiment. Chloramphenicol resistance gene with same adaptor and primer
sequences was used as reporter gene. In the parallel normalization, the reporter gene was added to the cDNA
population as internal control at 1.0% redundant rate.
Cloning of cDNA using modified pBluescript II SK- was
performed. Normalization efficiency was determined by
plating the cDNA library on LB plates containing
chloramphenicol.
Quality Control of cDNA Library
Figure 6 Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of expression of
selected genes. Expression of seventeen genes involved in oil
biosynthesis were analysed by Semi-quantitative RT-PCR in flower (F),
mature leaves (L), root (R), and developing seeds (S) of J. curcas. Actin
was used as an internal control. Name of the genes studied, the
primers used for PCR amplification, and the size of the PCR amplified
fragments are given in Table 3.

adaptor. The sense strand of the double strand tester
cDNA which is phosphorylated at the 5’end was destroyed
by treating it with lambda exonuclease. As a result only
the anti-sense strands are retained. Double strand driver
cDNA was prepared by low cycling PCR using phosphorylated driver3 primer and driver5 primer (TCCTAA
GGTAGCGAGGCCATTACGGCCGGG) which is complementary to the 5’driver adaptor. The anti-sense strand
of the double strand driver cDNA which is phosphorylated
at the 5’end was destroyed by treating it with lambda exonuclease. As a result only the sense strands are retained.
Anti-sense strands from tester cDNA and sense
strands from driver cDNA were mixed and hybridized
in 1× hybridization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5
M NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA) at 68°C for 6 h. The double
strand hybrids formed during hybridization were
removed by hydroxyapatite chromatography [59] for
normalization of the single strand cDNA population.
The normalized single strand cDNAs were converted to
double strand cDNA and amplified by FailsafeTM PCR
system (Epicentre Biotechnologies, USA) using amplification primer (CAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT) for
which the binding sites are present both in the 5’ and 3’
end of the cDNA and it is specific to the tester cDNA
only (underlined in tester3 and tester5 primers used for
cDNA synthesis). The amplified cDNA was digested
with SfiI restriction enzyme and cloned in modified
pBluescript II SK- in which SfiA (GGCCATTACGGCC)

Ninety six colonies from the cDNA library were randomly selected for quality control experiment. Cells from
these 96 colonies were used for colony PCR as well as
plasmid DNA isolation for sequencing. Colony PCR was
performed using M13 forward (GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) and M13 reverse primer (CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC). The PCR products were run on 1.0% agarose
gel with 1.0 kb ladder as marker (Genie, Bangalore,
India). Clones without cDNAs (empty clones) will give
PCR product size of 226 bp and clones with cDNA will
give variable PCR product size higher than 226 bp
depending on the length of the insert. Based on this,
approximate size of cDNA in each clone was determined.
For plasmid DNA isolation, the cells were inoculated in 5
ml LB Broth supplemented with 50 mg/L ampicillin and
incubated at 37°C at 200 rpm for 16 hours. Plasmid DNA
was isolated from 1.5 ml of culture using Plasmid Miniprep Kit following manufacturer’s protocol (Biobasic Inc,
Canada). About 200 ng of plasmid DNA was used for
sequencing using M13 reverse primer and BigDye TM
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit in 3130xl Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). These
sequences were annotated by using BLASTX algorithm
and non-redundant database at NCBI [61].
Sequencing of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs)

The cDNA library was serially diluted and plated on Luria
Bertani (LB) agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated for 16 hours at 37°C. Well separated
single colonies were randomly selected and patched on LB
agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and
incubated overnight at 37°C. The cells from patched colonies were inoculated in 5 ml LB Broth supplemented with
50 mg/L ampicillin and incubated at 37°C at 200 rpm for
16 hours. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 1.5 ml of culture
using Plasmid Miniprep Kit following manufacturer’s

protocol (Biobasic Inc, Canada). Plasmid DNA was isolated
from 12,810 cDNA clones. Sequencing of ESTs was performed using M13 reverse primer and BigDyeTM Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit in 3130xl Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The raw sequence data
was base called by Phred program [62] using DNA Sequencing Analysis Software Version 5.1 (Applied Biosystems,
CA, USA). Only the bases having Phred value above 20
were considered for further analysis. The vector sequences
and cDNA anchor sequences were removed using Codon
Code Aligner (Codon Code Corporation, MA, USA). The
clones having less than 100 bp good quality sequences
were also removed from the analysis.
Contigs assembly

Contig assembly of ESTs was done using CAP3 program
[63] and Codon Code Aligner (Codon Code Corporation,
MA, USA). The default parameters set by CAP3 was
used to assemble the ESTs in to contigs and singletons.
The number of ESTs in the contigs was used to find the
redundancy rate of the ESTs in the library. After the
assembly result, the outputs were manually checked and
redundant clones were removed. The total numbers of
unique ESTs (unigenes) were calculated by adding all
singletons and one EST from each contig.

assigned putative functions. Others were classified as
unigenes with no significant similarity.
Phylogenetic analysis

Ten ESTs of J. curcas from the current study were
selected and corresponding genes from five oilseed
crops and Vitis vinifera were obtained from Genbank at
NCBI. The Phylogenetic analysis was done using ClustalW2 program [64].
Identification of full-length unigenes

Full-length nature of the cDNAs at the 5’end was analyzed from BLASTX output. A unigene was considered
as potential full-length gene if (1) there was a bonafide
5’UTR, (2) the first amino acid in one of the positive
reading frames of query sequence matches with the first
amino acid in subject sequence from the database and
(3) the reading frame covers the entire length of the
query sequence. The unigenes that did not show significant similarity were analyzed for Open Reading Frames
(ORF) using ORF Finder at NCBI [65]. The unigenes
were considered as potential full-length gene if there
was a bonafide 5’ UTR and the longest ORF covered
almost the entire length of the sequence.
Functional Classification of Unigenes

Annotation of Unigenes

The unigenes were annotated using BLASTX and nonredundant database at NCBI [61]. All the sequences
which showed significant similarity (e-value < e-10) were

The unigenes were annotated again using BLASTN and
NT database of arabidopsis at The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) [66]. This resulted in locus identifier for each unigenes. These locus identifiers were

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR

Seventeen ESTs for oil biosynthesis genes and one EST
for actin gene were selected from the current study and
sequenced from 3’ ends. Using these 3’ end sequences,
primers were synthesized to amplify the 3’ UTR excluding the poly-(A) tail for all the genes except actin. For
actin, the primers were synthesised to amplify a 590 bp
fragment which included 392 bp from the 3’ end of the
coding region and 198 bp from the 3’ UTR. The primer
sequences and the size of the amplified fragments are
given in Table 3. For RT-PCR, total RNA from roots,
mature leaves, flowers and developing seeds were treated with DNase and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). About 3.0 μg of purified total RNA from
each sample was used for first strand cDNA synthesis
using 50 pmol oliog-dT(18) primer and 100 units of PrimeScriptTM reverse transcriptase (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga,
Japan). Equal quantity of first strand cDNA (from 25 ng
total RNA) was used for PCR. Semi-quantitative analysis
of the PCR amplified fragments was done by agarose gel
electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
