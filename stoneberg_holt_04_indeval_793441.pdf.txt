Abstract
Background: The program InDeVal was originally developed to help researchers find known
regions of insertion/deletion activity (with the exception of isolated single-base indels) in newly
determined Poaceae trnL-F sequences and compare them with 533 previously determined
sequences. It is supplied with input files designed for this purpose. More broadly, the program is
applicable for finding specific target regions (referred to as "variable regions") in DNA sequence. A
variable region is any specific sequence fragment of interest, such as an indel region, a codon or
codons, or sequence coding for a particular RNA secondary structure.
Results: InDeVal input is DNA sequence and a template file (sequence flanking each variable
region). Additional files contain the variable regions and user-defined messages about the sequence
found within them (e.g., taxa sharing each of the different indel patterns).
Variable regions are found by determining the position of flanking sequence (referred to as
"conserved regions") using the LPAM (Length-Preserving Alignment Method) algorithm. This
algorithm was designed for InDeVal and is described here for the first time.
InDeVal output is an interactive display of the analyzed sequence, broken into user-defined units.
Once the user is satisfied with the organization of the display, the information can be exported to
an annotated text file.
Conclusions: InDeVal can find multiple variable regions simultaneously (28 indel regions in the
Poaceae trnL-F files) and display user-selected messages specific to the sequence variants found.
InDeVal output is designed to facilitate comparison between the analyzed sequence and previously
evaluated sequence. The program's sensitivity to different levels of nucleotide and/or length
variation in conserved regions can be adjusted. InDeVal is currently available for Windows in

Background
Gaps caused by insertion and deletion events (indels) are
often important features of DNA sequence data, which is

widely used in phylogenetic studies [1-13]. Although
some authors consider indels to be potentially misleading
[1,14], others consider indels to be important characters

[8,9,13,15,16] and have argued that treating them as missing data can weaken phylogenetic analyses [3,7,10,17].
Even though it is generally accepted that indels that cannot be unambiguously positioned make confident
homology assessment impossible and, therefore, regions
that contain them should be excluded from phylogenetic
analyses [3,4,6,8], it has been proposed that even these
regions are valuable if properly coded [15].
Phylogenetic estimation depends on accurate character
homology assessment (sequence alignment) [4,8,18],
which is made more difficult by the presence of indels [24,6,8,15]. Indel occurrence is context-dependent, and it
has been repeatedly reported that indels tend to be found
clustered
into
specific
length-variable
regions
[1,3,5,6,8,19-21]. Accurate assessment of these regions
(proper alignment and recognition of relative indel rate,
reversals, parallel events, and multiple, overlapping
events) is aided by comparison among many sequences
from various taxonomic levels [4,8,19].
Sequence comparisons are complicated by the ambiguities gaps introduce into alignments. Finding a target
region recognized from one alignment within another can
be time consuming and difficult to perform accurately.
Because of the limits of computer screen size and human
analytical ability, alignments of hundreds of sequences
are difficult to evaluate, even when they can be prepared.
Poaceae is one of the largest families of flowering plants
and is economically important [22]. Lower-level phylogenies within the family often make use of the largely noncoding plastid sequence between the trnL (UAA) 5' exon
and trnF (GAA), hereafter called trnL-F [17,23-28]. As of
Apr 2, 2004, the NCBI Entrez Nucleotides database [29]
contained 505 Poaceae trnL-F sequences. Comparing
indel regions across these sequences can reveal patterns in
indel behavior and aid researchers in creating accurate
alignments. A discussion of the indel regions in these
sequences is being prepared separately for publication.
The program InDeVal was originally developed to help
researchers find known indel regions (with the exception
of isolated single-base indels) in newly determined
Poaceae trnL-F sequences and simultaneously compare
them with 533 previously determined sequences (those
mentioned above, plus 28 determined by SDSH). It is supplied with input files designed for this purpose. More
broadly, the program is applicable for finding specific target regions (referred to as "variable regions") in DNA
sequence. A variable region is any specific sequence fragment of interest, such as an indel region, a codon or
codons, or sequence coding for a particular RNA secondary structure. The LPAM algorithm, which was specifically
designed for InDeVal, is used to find sequence (referred to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/173

as "conserved regions") flanking the variable region in the
analyzed sequence. InDeVal can find multiple variable
regions simultaneously (28 indel regions in the Poaceae
trnL-F files). The program's sensitivity to different levels of
nucleotide and/or length variation in conserved regions
can be adjusted.

Implementation
Input files
InDeVal uses three types of input files: one conserved
region file, separate variable region files for each variable
region, and a DNA sequence file (Table 1). The conserved
region file contains a template of sequence immediately
flanking the variable regions (regions of interest). A variable region file contains messages that indicate which permutation of the variable region is in the analyzed
sequence. The sequence file contains a set of sequences to
be analyzed with InDeVal. All files are plain text (ASCII).
Conserved region and variable region files are in InDeValspecific formats. Detailed instructions for creating them
are in the help files. The sequence file is in FASTA-format.

A conserved region file contains at least one template, created by taking a representative sequence, removing the
variable regions, and replacing them with variable region
file names (Additional file 2). Multiple (15) templates
were used in the Poaceae trnL-F sequences to accommodate single, large deletions that spanned otherwise conserved regions. Treating them the same as the other indels
would have resulted in a few large, difficult-to-interpret
variable regions. InDeVal performance is improved by
designing templates with conserved regions at least 20
bases long on either side of each variable region. However, the program still functions using templates with only
one conserved region, conserved regions only 4 bases
long, and variable regions flanked by other variable
regions (such as clearly distinguishable, adjacent indel
regions varying at different rates, which are found in
Poaceae trnL-F). Although InDeVal parameters can be
adjusted to reflect different degrees of nucleotide and
length variation in conserved regions, it is a good idea to
use a representative sequence for template design, especially if some conserved regions are short. Additional templates can be designed to accommodate distantly related
taxa. (In the Poaceae trnL-F files, separate templates were
designed for Pooideae, Ehrhartoideae, and the PACCAD
clade).
A variable region file contains the sequence variations the
researcher expects in the region and some output information about each variation (Additional file 2). In the
Poaceae trnL-F files, the output information is the list of
taxa with each variation. For coding sequence, the output
information could be the amino acids for which the variations code. If the user is interested only in knowing if a

also reported by InDeVal. The program works if the variable region file is completely blank (variable regions are all
bases found between template conserved regions), but it
obviously cannot provide output messages in this case.
Symbols can be used in variable region sequence to draw
attention to specific features of interest. They are ignored
during alignment, but are displayed in the Variable

sequences, are provided with InDeVal. These files are
based on the first author's critical examination (to be published elsewhere) of various alignments of these
sequences using the web-based programs BLAST 2
SEQUENCES [30] and/or CLUSTAL W multiple alignments [31].
Aligning a sequence with a given template
InDeVal begins by sorting a template's conserved regions
by length. It then searches for each conserved region in the
analyzed sequence (using LPAM â see below), proceeding
from longest to shortest. Found conserved regions are
used to limit the search space for future searches (Figure
1).

Sequence files are in a less stringent FASTA-format (Additional file 2) and can be in either orientation. They can
include spaces, numbers, capital or small letters, IUPAC
ambiguity symbols, and carriage returns without disrupting InDeVal function.

Sometimes conserved regions are not found or are found
at multiple locations within their subsequence. The program records this information and proceeds to the next
longest sequence. A conserved region that cannot be
aligned is recorded as "not found." A conserved region
with multiple possible alignments is recorded as "found",
but none of its possible alignments is used to limit the
searches for the remaining regions.

suggested by the longer conserved regions, which are
assumed to be more reliable. Using the alignment of
longer regions to reduce the search space for smaller
regions minimizes the probability of finding ambiguous
or incorrect alignments.
Length-Preserving Alignment Method (LPAM)
InDeVal uses the LPAM algorithm, designed specifically
for InDeVal and described here for the first time, to align
the conserved regions within their subsequences. LPAM
divides a conserved region into overlapping "words",
strings of sequence of a user-defined length. That is, given
a 4-base word length, the sequence "caatgt" would be represented as "caat", "aatg", "atgt". (Conserved regions
shorter than the word length are found only if they match
exactly.) LPAM searches the analyzed sequence for each of
these words and notes multiple finds, single finds, and
missing words. Each word is allowed one "vote" for a possible alignment, i.e., for the base in the analyzed sequence
that begins the conserved region. If the word occurs once,
it casts its vote for that alignment. If it occurs multiple
times, its vote is divided equally among the possibilities.
Words that are not found cast no vote. The alignment that

receives the most votes is assumed to be the most
probable.
LPAM permits a (user-definable) degree of length variation. A word's possible alignments are evaluated according to whether or not they agree with the most probable
alignment for the region as a whole. Suppose, for example, that the most probable ungapped conserved region
alignment would begin at base 53. If the tolerance is set to
3, LPAM will allow the first word to begin at any base from
50 to 56, preferring the possibility closest to 53. If the first
word in the conserved region sequence has no acceptable
alignment, LPAM searches for the first word that does
have an acceptable alignment. All bases preceding this
first found word are aligned with no gaps. In the above
example, if the first and second words are not found and
the third word aligns beginning at base 57, the first two
bases of the conserved region will be aligned with bases
55 and 56.
Each subsequent base is aligned similarly. If the word it
begins has no acceptable alignment, the base is aligned
according to the previous acceptable word. If the word it

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:173

begins has multiple acceptable alignments, the one closest
to the previous alignment is chosen. Note that the range
of acceptable alignments remains constant; it is a function
of the initial voting and does not depend on any of the
choices made in aligning individual bases.
The aligned bases from the analyzed sequence are compared with the template conserved region sequence, and a
percentage similarity is established. If this is greater than
the user-defined cut-off value, the conserved region is
listed as found.
InDeVal then checks the most probable alignment that
clearly differs from the first. (In the example above, this
excludes any alignment beginning at bases 50â56.) If this
alignment also yields a percentage similarity greater than
the cut-off value, neither is selected, but the region is still
considered to be "found" for purposes of measuring similarity to the template (see below).
The LPAM algorithm is able to align conserved regions
despite both point mutations and indels. However, deletions in the first or last word of a conserved region are
indistinguishable from point mutations (and are interpreted as such). LPAM proved effective in the Poaceae
trnL-F sequences, where conserved regions are by definition length-conserved. In 533 sequences, there were only
three instances where an indistinguishable mismatch was
caused by an indel instead of a point mutation and
resulted in misalignment. It is important to design templates so that the ends of conserved regions are not in
sequence prone to indel activity.
The alignment suggested by LPAM is not necessarily
locally maximal, i.e., there are cases where a slight adjustment of the alignment would produce a higher percentage
of matched bases. Furthermore, a number of factors can
prevent LPAM from finding a correct alignment. Repetitive sequence, resulting in multiple matches, can be very
problematic. InDeVal may not be appropriate for
analyzing repetitive sequence, and if it is used for this purpose, templates must be designed with great care. If every
word contains a point mutation, the conserved region
cannot be found. Indels can cause problems if they are
dispersed so that several words are disrupted. In general,
LPAM will correctly align regions if the mutations are clustered and the first and last base can be assigned correctly
(which will be the case if they have no indels between
them and the undisrupted word that will position them).
Though hypothetical situations where LPAM would create
incorrect alignments are easy to envision, in practice, the
algorithm proved able to reliably determine where the
conserved regions of a sequence begin and end. This is
sufficient for the purposes of InDeVal. It is important to
note that even when LPAM does not find a conserved

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/173

region alignment, a possible alignment is displayed, and
the user can rearrange it (to a limited extent) and interpret
it.
Choosing the best template
Once conserved regions have been found, InDeVal calculates a "found conserved region score" for each template.
Each matched conserved region is given a value equal to
the number of bases in that region in the template
(regardless of how many individual bases actually
matched), and these values are summed to give a score for
the template. This prevents a template with a major deletion from being selected over a template with more
matching conserved regions (as could happen if the deletion template were a better match at the base-per-base
level). Templates with higher scores are ranked above
those with lower scores (Figure 2).

If two templates have roughly equal found conserved
region scores (to within a user-selected tolerance), the one
with the higher "score percentage" (calculated by dividing
the score by the total number of conserved region bases in
the template) is ranked higher. This ensures that
sequences that actually do have deletions will be matched
with deletion templates, even though the templates (theoretically) have an equal number of bases in found conserved regions (Figure 2).
All the templates are ranked in this way and listed in the
Template List Box in order. The highest ranked template is
automatically selected, and its variable regions are
analyzed. The user has the option of comparing the
sequence to a template other than the one selected by
InDeVal.
Finding the correct variable region sequence
Each variable region is defined as the sequence between
two specific conserved regions. If both flanking conserved
regions are found, the bases between them are recorded,
and the appropriate variable region file is searched for a
matching string of bases.

Sequence between two found conserved regions is classified as a confused region if the template indicates that it
should contain one or more conserved regions that were
not found. Because the variable regions in a confused
region are not clearly delimited, InDeVal searches the
entire region for each variable region sequence in each
applicable variable region file, and all potential matches
are recorded. The user is able to select from among these
possibilities, rearrange the display to reflect them, and
study different sequence interpretations. In this manner,
InDeVal is able to deal satisfactorily with most short
conserved regions that cannot be found because of point
mutations. In the Poaceae trnL-F file, one- and two-base

Ranking templates This figure shows a schematic diagram of two templates (conserved regions indicated by colored boxes)
and two analyzed sequences (indicated by two lines). The first sequence is a better match with Template 1, because it has more

because it matches a higher percentage of all the conserved regions in the template.

conserved regions were incorporated into adjacent variable region files because they were impossible to find.
A short conserved region will be misaligned if a point
mutation prevents it from being found in the proper place
and a perfect match is found nearby. If this occurs, it is
possible to set the program to disregard conserved regions
of this size. (This situation has only been observed for 4and 5-base conserved regions). The region can then be satisfactorily parsed using the confused region algorithm.

Results and discussion
InDeVal has two output windows (Table 1, Additional file
2). The Sequence Analysis Window displays the analyzed
sequence broken into conserved and variable regions and
lists template information. From this window, the user
can load template and sequence files, export the analysis
to a text file, set LPAM parameters and warning message
options, convert the sequence to its complement prior to
analysis, and choose a template other than the one
selected by InDeVal. For conserved regions, the template
sequence is listed so that it can be compared directly with
the analyzed sequence. For variable regions, if the analyzed sequence matches one of the variants in the variable
region file, the message for that variant is displayed.
The Variable Region Analysis Window displays the variable region file name, variants proposed by InDeVal, and

the sequence and length of the line currently selected in
the Sequence Analysis Window (which can be any line
from any sequence). The user can request displays of some
or all of the sequences in the variable region file.
A text file can be created once the user is satisfied with the
display in the Sequence Analysis Window. This file gives
information about the sequence and template, lists the
positions of the various conserved and variable regions,
and shows the entire analyzed sequence. The user can
choose whether or not variable region file information is
displayed.
InDeVal for the Windows platform is available in Additional file 1. The source code for InDeVal in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 is available in Additional file 3. InDeVal
analyzes only DNA sequences, but a version for protein
sequences could be created using the source code. It
would have to be altered to recognize amino acid
sequence (all non-nucleotide letters are presently
ignored), and an algorithm to recognize frame-shifts
would be helpful.

Conclusions
InDeVal is a program designed to search DNA sequence
for target regions and to display information about them.
It can find multiple target regions simultaneously and is
relatively robust when challenged by conserved region

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:173

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/173

variation and differences among analyzed sequences in
length, spanned region, and format. InDeVal differs from
other alignment software in that it breaks the analyzed
sequence into user-defined units and emphasizes regions
that are of most interest to the user. This makes it possible
to quickly compare specific features among many hundreds of sequences. An advantage of InDeVal is that, while
it can be used to quickly skim and classify hundreds of
sequences, it displays all surrounding sequence. Therefore, if at any time questions arise about the initial classification, the researcher can recreate the InDeVal
alignment, instantly find the area in question, and study
it for alternative explanations.
