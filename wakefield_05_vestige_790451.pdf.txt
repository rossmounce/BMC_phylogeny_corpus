Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic footprinting is the identification of functional regions of DNA by their
evolutionary conservation. This is achieved by comparing orthologous regions from multiple
species and identifying the DNA regions that have diverged less than neutral DNA. Vestige is a
phylogenetic footprinting package built on the PyEvolve toolkit that uses probabilistic molecular
evolutionary modelling to represent aspects of sequence evolution, including the conventional
divergence measure employed by other footprinting approaches. In addition to measuring the
divergence, Vestige allows the expansion of the definition of a phylogenetic footprint to include
variation in the distribution of any molecular evolutionary processes. This is achieved by displaying
the distribution of model parameters that represent partitions of molecular evolutionary
substitutions. Examination of the spatial incidence of these effects across regions of the genome
can identify DNA segments that differ in the nature of the evolutionary process.
Results: Vestige was applied to a reference dataset of the SCL locus from four species and provided
clear identification of the known conserved regions in this dataset. To demonstrate the flexibility
to use diverse models of molecular evolution and dissect the nature of the evolutionary process
Vestige was used to footprint the Ka/Ks ratio in primate BRCA1 with a codon model of evolution.
Two regions of putative adaptive evolution were identified illustrating the ability of Vestige to
represent the spatial distribution of distinct molecular evolutionary processes.
Conclusion: Vestige provides a flexible, open platform for phylogenetic footprinting. Underpinned
by the PyEvolve toolkit, Vestige provides a framework for visualising the signatures of evolutionary
processes across the genome of numerous organisms simultaneously. By exploiting the maximumlikelihood statistical framework, the complex interplay between mutational processes, DNA repair
and selection can be evaluated both spatially (along a sequence alignment) and temporally (for each
branch of the tree) providing visual indicators to the attributes and functions of DNA sequences.

Background
Phylogenetic footprinting is a computational approach to

finding functional elements in DNA by comparing
sequences between species. In an evolutionary context the

'footprint' is the altered pattern of divergence resulting
from a functional constraint. This is typically estimated as
a reduced number of sequence changes. Phylogenetic
footprinting was popularised by Tagle et al.[1] who demonstrated its utility in analysing the beta globin gene cluster. As larger amounts of non-coding DNA became
available, easy to use tools such as Pipmaker were developed promoting wider adoption and acceptance of the
technique[2,3].
Interest in phylogenetic footprinting was increased when
comparison of the mouse and human genomes showed a
surprisingly high proportion of the genome could be
aligned and that at least 1.5% of the genome was highly
conserved non-repeat, non-protein coding DNA[4].
The conventional phylogenetic footprinting method relies
on the comparison of a measure of evolutionary distance
to determine conservation. Since the initial development
of Pipmaker several groups have sought to improve upon
the simple pair-wise percent identity measure of evolutionary distance. Chapman et al.[5] used alignment score
from a multi species alignment. Margulies et al.[6] define
a multi-species conserved site, using a parsimony and
binomial probability method to score the importance of a
match in each species. The binomial approach calculates
the probability of observed or greater conservation with a
reference sequence in a window given a neutral substitution rate (calculated from fourfold degenerate sites in
codons) for that species. Equal levels of sequence conservation are given different scores, depending on their local
neutral substitution rates. For example, a higher score is
awarded where there is a higher neutral substitution rate.
An averaging that halves the contribution of a species to
the score at each node in the tree is then applied to reduce
the weighting bias effect of non-symmetrical tree topologies. The parsimony model calculates a parsimony score
for each column in the alignment and assigns a P-value
based on simulations of parsimony scores for data generated under the HKY85 model calibrated with a previously
determined phylogenetic tree and branch lengths.
The methods of Margulies et al. and Chapman et al. both
improve the sensitivity of detecting changes in divergence
by including additional species in their calculation, reducing the probability of conservation due solely to chance.
Likelihood methods for analysing sequence evolution
have been widely adopted in the molecular evolution
community for their advantages in consistency, sufficiency and the ability to naturally compare hypotheses. By
definition, parsimony is minimum evolution, and will be
biased towards underestimation, especially with longer
branch lengths where the probability of multiple events at
the same site increases.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/130

Central to the likelihood-based approach are continuous
time Markov process models of substitution. The states in
this Markov chain correspond to elements in the respective sequence alphabet, and will subsequently be referred
to as motifs. The probability a motif changes (or remains
the same) can be parameterised in many ways, e.g. according to biochemical attributes of the motifs involved.
Motifs can be individual nucleotides or amino acids, biologically meaningful groups such as the triplets of nucleotides that make up a codon, or artificial groupings
designed to capture dependencies such as dinucleotides.
The Markov process for modelling motif changes is represented as a matrix of average relative rates of change and
the matrix of substitution probabilities for a given time
period is determined by a matrix exponentiation procedure. Details of these molecular evolution methods can
be found elsewhere [7-9].
Methods using probabilistic evolutionary modelling for
phylogenetic footprinting have been applied in two previous publications. Boffelli et al[10], who call their method
phylogenetic shadowing, utilized fastDNAml[11] to
determine mutation rates under the HKY85 model[12] for
conserved and non-conserved regions from a training set
of closely related primate data. These fitted models were
then used for a likelihood ratio test to determine the probability of a given alignment column being in the conserved or non-conserved state and the likelihood ratios
averaged over windows. The UCSC genome browser PhyloHMM track uses a combined HMM and probabilistic
model of evolution to develop a HMM categoriser that
can distinguish previously trained states (e.g. conserved
vs. non-conserved). This model includes dependency of a
nucleotide on the preceding site and implements a fully
parameterised model analogous to a general time reversible model[13].
All of the previously discussed programs and strategies
consider only measures of the expected number of substitutions per motif. This expected number of substitutions
derives from the product of substitution rate and time,
and reflects the combined influence of all mutational and
selective processes. Although looking at low values of this
statistic has proven an effective method for identifying
regions that have a biological function that constrains
their evolution, it does little to provide answers to the
how and why of sequence divergence.
By examining both the degree of conservation and individual components of the evolutionary processes, it
should be possible to elucidate and infer the nature of
evolutionary processes occurring at different sites in the
genome. Using models that include terms for biologically
relevant sequence changes, and tracking the change in
estimates of the model terms along the sequence, regions

where specific biological processes are predominating can
be identified. The models can then be tailored to both the
properties of the sequence being analysed (e.g. coding, or
intergenic), and the effect of the biological process of
interest.
Vestige allows an examination of the temporal component of substitutions. Branches on a tree represent episodes of evolutionary time. Two regions may have
experienced a similar amount of evolution when the
entire tree is considered, but in very different ways. The
extent to which such relative shifts in rate occur can be
evaluated by examining the spatial distribution of a substitution statistic (such as length) for individual branches
of a tree. Recent evidence of shifts in the evolutionary
process between different mammalian lineages[14,15]
suggests that in order to accurately assess the spatial distribution of evolutionary processes, changes in the temporal
distribution across the tree will also need to be taken into
account. The combination of both the temporal and spatial partitioning therefore provides a useful tool with
which to illuminate processes that may have occurred in a
restricted region and stopped millions of years ago or continue to occur in current populations.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/130

to integrate any alignment algorithm into the Vestige
package but require user-supplied alignments. Vestige
also does not do any automated masking of repeats.
Masking of repeats sequences such as transposable elements can be done by the user prior to footprinting by
Vestige using programs such as RepeatMasker[18] to generate masked sequence prior to alignment. This may be
desirable as repeats may not share the same phylogeny
and may show a high level of conservation that can visually clutter the analysis. Alternatively, these can be annotated and their influence on the analysis assessed visually.
Probabilistic phylogenetic modelling requires a phylogenetic tree. For reversible substitution models, an unrooted
tree is used with the result that for two and three sequence
cases only one unrooted tree is possible. In these cases, no
phylogenetic inference is necessary and Vestige constructs
the tree. In the case of more than three sequences the user
can either supply a tree topology or Vestige will automatically construct a neighbour joining tree using the PyEvolve toolkit[19]. For some groups of species certain tree
topologies are accepted by the community such as the
Murphy et al.[20] mammal tree, and should be used as
they represent a more robust reconstruction than is possible with a single sequence.

Implementation
Vestige is implemented in the Python scripting language[16]. This allows rapid development and reuse of
components by advanced users. The package utilises the
PyEvolve toolkit[17], building upon its performance optimisations and capacity for flexible construction of existing
and novel models of molecular evolution.
The implementation of Vestige is as an extensible framework. Predefined scripts for footprinting (whole tree and
per branch) of length, transition/transversion ratio, and
Ka/Ks ratios are distributed with the package. These can be
run as command line executable python scripts (unix or
windows) or as GUI "droplets" under MacOSX. Command line arguments can be given to alter parameters
such as the size of the analysis window and the step size
the analysis window advances.
These simple control scripts can be modified to alter the
model of evolution, apply constraints on model terms
and specify the terms from the model that are visualized,
creating a new distributable and easy to use script.
Vestige is implemented with parallelization at the per
window level and will automatically use any available
additional processors when run in an MPI environment.
Two key sequence manipulations must be performed
prior to analysis using Vestige. As alignment algorithms
are a fast moving and specialized field, it was decided not

Visualization is an important aspect of phylogenetic footprinting packages, as analysis often involves the integration of complex data from multiple sources. The drawing
of Vestige results utilises the ReportLab[21] library, outputting PDF files that can be edited in many illustration
packages and are suitable for high quality publications.
Due to the familiarity of many potential users of the package with existing software that displays conserved regions
as a peak (high Y value) on a graph, it was decided to
mimic this format, even though the natural mapping of
branch lengths would be to display short evolutionary
conserved sequences as zero. As evolutionary distance varies from zero to (theoretically) positive infinity, a transformation that clearly displays all values and provides good
discrimination between values close to zero was required.
For this reason, distances are plotted as e-length.
The standard statistics displayed in a Vestige run are the
sum of the branch lengths in the tree for each window and
the individual branch lengths for each branch and ancestral node in the tree. This allows examination of changes
in the spatial pattern of divergence for each evolutionary
episode, and visual assessment of the consistency of a signal between regions of the tree and the entire tree.
In addition to the commonly used distance measurement,
any parameter of the model of substitution can be estimated and plotted, either globally for the entire tree or
individually for each branch, providing an indication of

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:130

the spatial and temporal distribution of the process that is
represented by that term. Although Vestige is implemented to allow the user maximum flexibility in model
specification and parameter scoping, care must be exercised to avoid overreaching the capabilities of the model
or data. Users should be wary of over parameterisation,
which will result in estimates with very large variance. To
some extent this problem can be addressed by using larger
window sizes and/or global (whole tree) rather than local
(branch specific) scope for parameters. Ultimately, there
is a trade off between detecting individual short sequence
elements and the accuracy of estimation.
To aid in the interpretation of regions of conservation the
GFF[22] and Genbank[23] annotation formats can be
used to provide flexible multi-track decorations on the
alignment to integrate data from multiple sources. The
way that annotations are interpreted, grouped and displayed can readily be customized in user scripts. Annotation of biologically known features allows visual
comparison between the level of divergence (or other
parameters) of previously identified features and confirmed functional regions as a guide to importance of
novel regions.
The Vestige package is conceived as a data mining and
hypothesis generation tool rather than a strict hypothesis
testing framework. Correcting for multiple non-independent tests from a sliding window analysis is a difficult
problem. Instead, we suggest an effective solution is visual
inspection that draws on functional annotations as a reference coupled with an indication of the uncertainty of
parameter estimates. From this perspective, novel predictions based on phylogenetic footprinting require validation. Accordingly, Vestige does not calculate test statistics
for assessing the significance of conservation. Instead, the
support for parameter estimates is provided in the form of
a 95% confidence interval, estimated for branch specific
parameters and global parameters. This is determined by
fixing the values of all other parameters at their maximum
likelihood estimates and calculating the likelihood for different values for the parameter until the point at which the
likelihood ratio differs by the amount equivalent to a 5%
probability in a one degree of freedom chi-squared
test[24]. As is the case for all parametric statistical models,
the accuracy of parameter estimates increases with increasing data (bigger window sizes). Users should remain
mindful of this fact when inspecting all estimates, and
that by chance one window in twenty are expected to lie
outside this range. Further guidance to the importance of
a conservation signal is given by indicating the top 5% of
windows for the summed distance measure.
The PyEvolve toolkit provides global and local optimisers
for estimating model parameters. The global simulated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/130

annealing optimiser is capable of finding the global
optima in complex functions with multiple optima, while
the fast Powell optimiser is more prone to falling into
local optima. To improve the speed of Vestige analysis, a
global estimate of parameters is generated by simulated
annealing optimisation of either the entire alignment or a
random sample of columns drawn without replacement.
This estimate is then used as a starting point by the Powell
optimiser for rapid analysis or the more robust simulated
annealing optimiser. To identify any windows that may
suffer from poor optimisation a graph of the absolute
value of the log-likelihood is included on the output.
Abrupt discontinuities in the graph indicate optimisation
problems. The user can then re-run the analysis with more
robust optimisation settings.
Vestige determines the frequency of the sequence motifs
from the alignment. By default, the frequency of motifs in
the entire alignment is used or the user can select to use
the frequency in only the window being analysed.
The ability to employ models of substitution with motif
sizes greater than 1 raises the issues of generating invalid
motifs, and inaccurate estimation of motif probabilities.
Invalid motifs can be generated when the window is
advanced into a different frame, and motifs are observed
that were not in the original frame. For example, if the
codon sequence (ATG) (AAG) is analysed in the second
frame the (TGA) stop codon motif occurs, an invalid state
for codon models of substitution[25]. Vestige addresses
this problem using a flag that asserts that step should only
be a multiple of the motif size.
Inaccurate estimation of motif frequencies can occur
when using models with motif sizes greater than one, as
motif frequencies are normally counted only in the current frame. If a motif is rare in the frame used to calculate
the motif frequency, but occurs frequently in the current
analysis frame, the likelihood for windows in the current
frame will be significantly decreased. Vestige therefore calculates an average motif frequency across all frames when
using global motif probabilities for models with motif
sizes greater than one.

Results and discussion
To demonstrate the functionality and broad utility of the
Vestige package we present two analyses, the SCL locus
analysed with a dinucleotide model, and exon 11 of 5 primate BRCA1 sequences "footprinted" for the ratio of Ka/
Ks model terms using a codon model.
The alignment of human, mouse, rat and dog totalling
128 kb from the SCL locus and its annotations in GFF format are those used by Chapman et al allowing direct

Footprinting the SCL gene
Footprinting the SCL gene. Phylogenetic footprinting of the genomic region around the SCL gene. The alignment of Chapman et al.[5], with their experimentally determined regions of biological importance annotated, was footprinted in 100 bp windows with a 25 bp step using a dinucleotide model of evolution based on the HKY85 model[12]. This model contains terms for
the frequency of each dinucleotide (taken from the complete 139 kb alignment) and for the transition/transversion ratio which
is applied when the difference between the dinucleotides is a transition. The total branch length summed across the tree is
plotted as e-length in red and the absolute value of the log likelihood (smaller is better) in blue. The yellow line indicates the level
of conservation of the top 5% of windows for the entire 139 kb alignment. Local branch lengths are presented in 5 panels
aligned with a stepped dendrogram representation of the phylogenetic tree. Annotations for each species are displayed below
the graph, with the lower black lines representing sequence and white space gaps. Coloured annotations in the upper track are
described below the mainplot. The fourth track is the derived ancestor of mouse and rat, and therefore has no sequence or
annotation. The display of local branch lengths consists of a plot of the length at the lower bound of the 95% confidence estimate in salmon, and the upper bound of the 95% confidence estimate in green. The 95% confidence interval estimate for the
branch length is represented by the white space between these graphs. Regions of high confidence conservation can be identified by looking for peaks in the lower salmon graph, and conversely regions of high confidence divergence can be identified by
identifying hanging peaks in the upper green graph. Regions where no reliable branch length estimate can be given will appear
white. Individual branch lengths can be compared to changes in annotation between branches. For example, the grey boxed
region highlights a high confidence signal of divergence in dog between 75000 and 75300. This region correlates with part of an
exon and a region of open chromatin in mouse, but is intronic in dog. This suggests that the open chromatin region will be
altered or not present in dog, potentially altering regulation and function of this gene. Full analysis of the entire 139 kb region
around the SCL gene is provided as a supplementary file.

comparison with their results[5]. The BRCA1 alignment is
identical to that used by Huttley[26] with redundant gaps
removed.
The results for globally summed branch lengths across the
SCL locus provided similar results to those obtained by
Chapman et al. All of the experimentally determined and
biologically important conserved regions in this sample
alignment were detected (figure 1). Like other phyloge-

netic footprinting methods, Vestige fails to find any conservation at the region 8â9 kb upstream of the SCL start
site. This site represents an altered chromatin structure in
mouse and may be due to a non-DNA sequence specific
change in chromatin.
Graphing statistics for individual branches on the tree
provides a mechanism for discriminating between artefactual and biological causes of spatial heterogeneity.

Artefacts can arise due to properties of the data and properties of the statistical models and numerical algorithms.
Missing data are addressed by calculating the likelihood
over all possible states and gaps are conventionally treated
as missing data in the likelihood framework. Both missing
data in sequences and gaps in multiple alignments have a
structure to their occurrence that impacts on parameter
estimates: gaps occur in trees in a taxonomically structured way reflecting their evolutionary origin; and, both
gap and missing data symbols tend to occur in patches.
When the patch size is greater or equal to the window size,
the extreme case, one or more lineages without any information result and the true total tree branch length is
equivalent to that of a smaller number of taxa. Yet because
the optimiser still attempts to estimate values for these
parameters, optimiser behaviour can introduce a systematic error â such as zero branch length creating a region of
conservation â whose pattern depends on the optimiser
chosen. The introduction of a gap term into the model
doesn't necessarily solve this issue as they tend to be rare
and insertions reversing gaps are highly improbable, causing short branch lengths. As a solution to this problem,
Vestige estimates and displays a 95% confidence interval
for individual branch length estimates. The minimum and
maximum of the 95% confidence interval are then displayed rather than the optimised value. Windows where a
large proportion of N's creates a broad (or in the extreme
case infinite) confidence interval will be displayed as
white space. The user can look along the graph to identify
either well supported regions of conservation (the lower
graph) or well supported regions of divergence (the upper
hanging graph). While this capacity for establishing artefacts as the basis for a spatial distribution is essential,
more interesting is the situation in which there are lineage
specific effects that are biological in origin.
Biological origins for spatial heterogeneity can, in principal, originate from spatial fluctuations in a biological
process that is common to all lineages or unique to a subset of lineages. To date there has been little consideration
of the latter case but several studies demonstrate this is a
real topic of interest. Direct evidence of differences in
DNA repair between rodents and humans[27], and indirect evidence between rat and mouse[14] and between
eutherian and non-eutherian mammals[15] establish the
existence of differences in DNA mutation and repair
between lineages. Furthermore, the existence of substitution rate heterogeneity across genomes[28,29] illustrates
the existence of spatially localised differences in mutation
and repair, local effects that can change character over
evolutionary time. Consequently, inference regarding the
property of a single region based on a summary statistic
calculated for the whole tree benefits from the ability to
establish that the fundamental pattern is consistent across
the majority of branches on the tree. Of course, inconsist-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/130

ency across the tree can also be of interest since they may
indicate changes in local mutagenic environment providing insight into shifts in the boundaries of biological features. An example of one such change is given in figure 1,
where a region that is exonic in mouse and rat is intronic
in dog. This region is conserved in all lineages except that
leading to the dog. The tight confidence intervals on these
estimates for this region across all lineages, coupled with
the strength of signal on the lineage leading to the common ancestor of mouse and rat, suggests loss of this exon
occurred on the lineage leading to dog. These observations suggest the hypothesis that the open chromatin
region observed in mouse will have been lost or significantly altered in dog. Inconsistency of the spatial pattern
between branches or clades can therefore facilitate identifying key regions of biological differentiation.
We have broadened the definition of a footprint to
include spatial changes in estimates of any model term.
These terms may be either global in scope or locally estimated for each branch. To demonstrate the utility of this
broader definition we have footprinted primate BRCA1
for signals of adaptive evolution. This was chosen as an
example as it demonstrates the ability to work with different sequence data types and with biologically meaningful
model terms other than branch length. Implementation
of non-standard annotations requires some scripting and
the python script for this example provides a template for
other applications that may require fine control over the
behaviour of Vestige (script included in distribution).
The Ka/Ks statistic is the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates, and represents the impact of
natural selection. A Ka/Ks ratio of less than one indicates
purifying selection, a ratio equal to one indicates selective
neutrality, and a ratio greater than one is evidence of
positive or adaptive evolution. The Ka/Ks ratio is modelled by adding a term (omega) to the standard codon
model that applies when an instantaneous substitution
results in a change in the amino acid coded for by the
codon[30]. Due to the requirement of a moderate sized
data set for omega estimation a 100 codon (300 bp) window and global (whole tree) scoping of the omega parameter were used. The analysis of BRCA1 indicates there are
three regions that have Ka/Ks ratios greater than one, putatively indicative of adaptive evolution (figure 2). Two of
these three regions have estimated 95% confidence intervals that do not contain the value 1, suggesting the
hypothesis that adaptive modifications to BRCA1 function have occurred within them. Both regions fall within
the RAD51 binding domain and suggest that modulation
of RAD51 binding may be the driving force for BRCA1
adaptive evolution in primates. This result is consistent
with the inference of Huttley et al.[31] and variants in

was "footprinted" in 300 base (100 codon) windows and 30 base steps. Red lines indicate the 95% confidence interval for the
omega replacement parameter that is an estimate of the Ka/Ks ratio. Ka/Ks > 1 is indicative of adaptive evolution. Two regions
(around 1850 and 2400 bp) have 95% confidence intervals for omega that do not include 1, suggesting adaptive evolution is
occurring within them. Note that although plotted as single lines in the middle of the window range the 300 bp windows overlap and a single region or site can affect the parameter estimate for multiple adjacent windows. Annotations of protein-protein
