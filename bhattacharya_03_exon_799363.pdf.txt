Abstract
Background: We have studied spliceosomal introns in the ribosomal (r)RNA of fungi to discover
the forces that guide their insertion and fixation.
Results: Comparative analyses of flanking sequences at 49 different spliceosomal intron sites
showed that the G – intron – G motif is the conserved flanking sequence at sites of intron insertion.
Information analysis showed that these rRNA introns contain significant information in the flanking
exons. Analysis of all rDNA introns in the three phylogenetic domains and two organelles showed
that group I introns are usually located after the most conserved sites in rRNA, whereas
spliceosomal introns occur at less conserved positions. The distribution of spliceosomal and group
I introns in the primary structure of small and large subunit rRNAs was tested with simulations
using the broken-stick model as the null hypothesis. This analysis suggested that the spliceosomal
and group I intron distributions were not produced by a random process. Sequence upstream of
rRNA spliceosomal introns was significantly enriched in G nucleotides. We speculate that these Grich regions may function as exonic splicing enhancers that guide the spliceosome and facilitate
splicing.
Conclusions: Our results begin to define some of the rules that guide the distribution of rRNA
spliceosomal introns and suggest that the exon context is of fundamental importance in intron
fixation.

Background
Many eukaryotic genes are interrupted by stretches of
non-coding DNA called introns or intervening sequences.
Transcription of these genes is followed by RNA-splicing
that results in intron removal (for review, see [1]). The
majority of eukaryotic spliceosomal introns interrupt premRNA in the nucleus and are removed by a ribonucleo-

protein complex, termed the spliceosome. Two theories
have been proposed to explain the present spliceosomal
intron distribution; i.e., their presence in eukaryotes and
their absence in Bacteria and Archaea. The first, "intronsearly", posits that introns were present in most, if not all,
protein-coding genes in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and have subsequently been lost in the

archaeal and bacterial domains due to strong selection for
compact genomes. Eukaryotes have maintained their
introns because they confer the capacity to create evolutionary novelty through exon shuffling [2]. The intronsearly theory predicts that at least some of the extant
eukaryotic introns are direct descendants of the primordial sequences in the LUCA [2–5]. The alternate view,
"introns-late", suggests that the last common ancestor was
intron-free and that spliceosomal introns have originated
in eukaryotes from recent invasions by autocatalytic RNAs
(e.g., group II introns) or transposable elements [6–9].
The introns-late view is compatible with the now-established role of exon shuffling in creating eukaryotic genes
[10]. It is the ancient origin of introns that is primarily
called into question.
In this study, we analyzed the putative spliceosomal
introns in Euascomycetes (Ascomycota) small subunit
(SSU) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal (r)RNA genes
[11,12] to understand how spliceosomal introns of a
recent origin (i.e., introns-late) spread to novel genic sites.
Statistical methods were used to study the exon sequences
flanking 49 different spliceosomal intron insertion sites in
Euascomycetes rRNA and show that the introns interrupt
the G – intron – G (hereafter, the intron position is shown
with –) proto-splice site that pre-existed in the coding
region. A proto-splice site is a short sequence motif that
has a high affinity for splicing factors and is a preferred
site of intron insertion. The proto-splice site (e.g., MAG –
R in pre-mRNA genes [13]) need not be perfectly conserved in organisms but is rather a set of nucleotides that,
with some statistical uncertainty, shows a non-random
sequence pattern at sites flanking introns. It is also conceivable that proto-splice sites may differ between lineages reflecting, for example, differences in how the
spliceosome recognizes introns (e.g., exon definition
hypothesis [14,15]).
Our analysis using information theory [16] shows that the
significant information is found in exons flanking rRNA
spliceosomal introns. We also confirm that introns are not
randomly distributed in the primary and secondary structure of the SSU and LSU rRNA and that the group I introns
are generally found in the highly conserved (i.e., functionally important) regions of these genes, whereas the spliceosomal introns tend to occur in regions of the rRNA that
are not as well conserved or are not directly involved in
protein synthesis.

Results
Analysis of Euascomycetes rRNA Spliceosomal Introns
With our data set of 49 (two diatom-specific introns were
excluded from this analysis) different spliceosomal intron
sites in the SSU and LSU rRNAs of Euascomycetes (alignment available at http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/ANAL

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/7

YSIS/FUNGINT/ (for registration details please see http://
www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/cgi-access/access/locked.cgi),
we first tested for the presence of a proto-splice site flanking the introns [12]. In this chi-square analysis, the null
hypothesis specified that nucleotide usage in 50 nt of
exon sequence upstream and downstream of the different
intron insertion sites was random and dependent on the
nucleotide composition of Euascomycetes SSU and LSU
rRNA sequences in general. Previously, we found evidence
for the proto-splice site, AG – G, in Euascomycetes rRNA
with the greatest support for the G nucleotides (p < 0.001
[12]). The addition of 18 new Euascomycetes SSU and
LSU rRNA insertion sites in the new analysis supports this
finding (see Fig. 1) but shows strongest evidence for the
proto-splice site to encode G – G (p < 0.01 [three degrees
of freedom]), with the Gs occurring at frequencies of 65%
and 61% in the Euascomycetes rRNAs.
To address the possibility that we were counting as independent events cases where introns may have had a single
origin but then spread into neighboring sites through
intron sliding [e.g., [11]], we reran the chi-square analysis
after removal of all introns that were within 5 nt of each
other. This substantially reduced our data set to 30 introns
at the following sites; SSU – 265, 297, 330, 390, 400, 514,
674, 882, 939, 1057, 1071, 1083, 1226, 1514; LSU – 678,
711, 775, 824, 830, 858, 978, 1024, 1054, 1091, 1098,
1849, 1903, 1929, 2076, 2445, but addressed independence of intron insertion events. This data set showed significant support for the AG – G proto-splice site with the
A, G, and G, occurring at frequencies of 50% (chi-square
= 12.56, p = 0.0055), 67% (chi-square = 24.48, p <
0.0000), and 67% (chi-square = 25.35, p < 0.0000),
respectively. The AG – G and G – G proto-splice sites
occurred in 9 and 15 of these sequences, respectively. The
increase in signal of the AG – G proto-splice site with
removal of neighboring (potentially slid) introns is consistent with the idea that intron sliding may over time
obscure the targets originally used for insertion. It should
be noted, however, that this procedure was done by
retaining the most 5' intron in each set of neighboring
insertions and this may not represent the original intron.
Determining the role of intron sliding in creating new lineages of insertions will require a fully resolved Euascomycetes phylogeny (not yet available) that can be used to
map intron gains, losses, and potential slides. The present
data for the 300 – 337 spliceosomal introns, for example,
when mapped on the Euascomycetes tree published in
Bhattacharya et al. [11] shows these introns to be distributed in at least 4 divergent clades within the Lecanoromycetes. These introns may be related through the sliding
of an ancestral intron but without the presence of one of
these insertions in a non-Euascomycetes fungus or a
robust phylogeny of this lineage, it will not be possible to
unambiguously identify the original site of insertion.

Figure 1
Logo analysis of 50 nt upstream and downstream of insertion sites of 43 different spliceosomal rRNA introns
Logo analysis of 50 nt upstream and downstream of insertion sites of 43 different spliceosomal rRNA introns. The information
content of the 2 Gs of the intron proto-splice site is shown as is a line at p = 0.05 (95% quantile) that is based on simulations
using random sequence data. This exon region contains a total of 6.91 bits of information.

Next, we used the "Sequence Logo" method developed by
Stephens and Schneider [16] and the expression of Hertz
and Stormo [17] to determine the information content in
the Euascomycetes rRNA introns and exon flanking
sequence. The logo of a subset of 43 of the original 49 spliceosomal introns for which we had complete 50 nt of
upstream and 50 nt of downstream exon sequence is
shown in Fig. 1. This analysis shows that many of the
informative sites encode purines (in particular Gs) and
that the region contains a total of 6.91 bits. In general, the
information content is highest at the site of intron insertion and the regions within a close proximity (about 10
nt), and decreases as one moves away from this site, with
the exception of a significant U+G peak at -48 and C-richness around +40 (Fig. 1). In comparison, the mean value
(100,000 iterations) for the total bits of information in a

100 nt random sequence data set was 5.68 bits. The 95%
quantile for this distribution was 6.47 bits indicating that
the Euascomycetes rRNA exons encode significant information (p < 0.001). Logo analysis of the reduced set of 30
non-neighboring spliceosomal introns was consistent
with this analysis but showed a stronger signal at the
proto-splice site (A = 0.31 bits, G = 0.52 bits, G = 0.59
bits). The finding of significant information in the flanking exons suggests that some regulatory regions (i.e.,
exonic splicing enhancers, ESEs [18,19] may exist in these
sequences.
Sliding Window Analysis of Euascomycetes Spliceosomal
Intron Insertion Sites
Intrigued by the finding of G-richness in the upstream
exon region flanking introns (see -7 to -17 in Fig. 1), we

determined the association of G-rich regions in 1434 fungal SSU rRNAs and 880 fungal LSU rRNAs with all
reported spliceosomal introns in these genes. The G-frequencies were calculated at each rRNA site and are plotted
as the green circles in Fig. 2. The SSU (1800 nt [GenBank
U53879]) and LSU (3554 nt [U53879]) rRNAs from S.
cerevisiae were used as the reference sequence for these
alignments. The raw G-frequencies were smoothed (blue
curve in Fig. 2), using the loess local regression method
[20], and smoothing windows of size 50 nt or 100 nt,
prior to analyzing the intron-G-frequency association. The
positions of rRNA spliceosomal intron positions are
shown as red lines in Fig. 2. From this analysis we can
observe that regions of intron insertion strongly associate
with high G-frequencies in both the SSU and LSU rRNA.
The association is stronger in the 50 nt (i.e., 25 nt exon
sequence – intron insertion site – 25 nt exon sequence)
window of weighted averages, suggesting that this window size includes most of the exon signal. However, the
association is still apparent in the 100 nt window, in particular for the SSU rRNA.
Our analyses show that the average G-frequency at the 25
intron sites using the fitted curve in the SSU rRNA is 0.34,
whereas the average G-frequency at the 24 intron sites
using the fitted curve in the LSU rRNA is 0.32. To test the
significance of this result with the 25 intron sites and the
G-contents in the LSU rRNA, we randomly selected 25
sites from the 3554 nt of rRNA and computed the average
of their G-frequencies. We repeated this process 10,000
times and plotted the distribution of these average G-frequencies (results not shown). The observed average G-frequency at the LSU intron sites was significantly greater
than that in the simulated data (p = 0.0268). Similarly, we
carried out the simulation-based test for the SSU rRNA
intron sites. In these 10,000 replications, no average from
the randomly generated sites was greater than 0.34. Thus,
the p-value is less than 0.0001, reinforcing the remarkable
association of SSU rRNA introns and G-rich regions
apparent in Fig. 2. Taken together, our results suggest that
Euascomycetes rRNA spliceosomal introns are fixed at the
G – G or AG – G proto-splice site that is found in G-rich
regions.
Intron Positions on rRNA Conservation Diagrams
To understand the association of introns with highly conserved regions in the rRNAs, we mapped the intron positions on SSU and LSU rRNA conservation diagrams of the
three phylogenetic domains of life and the two eukaryotic
organelles (3Dom2O) and the nuclear-encoded rRNA
genes in the three phylogenetic domains (3Dom). This
analysis shows a significant association of group I intron
sites with rRNA sites that are 98–100% conserved within
both 3Dom2O and 3Dom LSU rRNA analyses (see Table
1). Only in the 3Dom analysis for SSU rRNA was the asso-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/7

ciation weakly non-significant (p = 0.0577). The observed
association of highly conserved rRNA and group I intron
sites is, therefore, unlikely to have occurred by chance
alone. For rRNA spliceosomal introns, however, the association of conserved rRNA and introns sites is less clear.
Within the 3Dom2O analysis of SSU rRNA, spliceosomal
intron positions vary significantly from the null model
but in the direction of fewer than expected introns at the
most highly conserved sites, whereas within the 3Dom
analysis of LSU rRNA no significant difference is found (p
= 0.0969). The 3Dom2O LSU rRNA and 3Dom SSU rRNA
analyses both show an enrichment of spliceosomal
introns at the highly conserved genic sites (primarily in
sites conserved between 90–97%). Taken together, our
analyses suggest that group I introns are fixed primarily in
the most highly conserved rRNA sites when analyzed in
the 3Dom2O or 3Dom data sets, whereas spliceosomal
introns are not strongly associated with highly conserved
rRNA sites.
To address more directly the relationship between Euascomycetes spliceosomal introns and rRNA conservation
patterns, we positioned these introns on a conservation
diagram generated from 1042 fungal SSU rRNA sequences
(see Fig. 3). This analysis showed that 19 of 24 fungal SSU
rRNA spliceosomal introns follow sites that are conserved
in more than 95% of the fungal sequences (1114 nt in this
class), one intron follows a site that is 90–95% conserved
(149 nt in this class), two introns follow sites that 80–
89% conserved (134 nt in this class), and two introns follow sites that <80% conserved (402 nt in this class). More
importantly, inspection of the 1800 nt alignment of SSU
rRNAs and 3554 nt of LSU rRNAs of all fungi, of fungi
containing spliceosomal introns, and of fungi lacking
spliceosomal introns shows that most of the introns are
inserted between nucleotides that are 99–100% conserved
(whether they encode G – G or not) in taxa containing
introns and sister groups lacking introns (Table 2). This
result provides strong support for the hypothesis that
Euascomycetes spliceosomal introns are fixed in a protosplice site that pre-dates intron insertion. Beyond this pattern of conservation, the G-rich regions in the neighborhood of introns are also often highly conserved among all
fungi (see Fig. 3). Most of these Gs are in sites that are
>95% conserved in all fungal SSU rRNAs, suggesting that
their existence also pre-dates intron insertion.
However, several exceptions to this general pattern merit
closer inspection. The upstream nucleotide at the SSU
rRNA 297 site (369 in the S. cerevisiae gene), for example,
occurs at a frequency of 63.9% U in taxa lacking introns
but at a frequency of 97.8% U in taxa containing introns.
On the surface, this suggests that the site may have undergone selective pressure, post-intron insertion, towards a
high frequency of Us. Analysis of the SSU rRNA alignment

shows, however, that the 5 taxa containing the 297 intron
share a U at this site with virtually all other intron-containing fungi that lack this particular insertion. This suggests that the high U frequency in the intron-containing
fungi is a synapomorphy for the monophyletic introncontaining Euascomycetes and is not an outcome of the
297 intron insertion. A similar result is found when the
proto-splice site is checked in all taxa containing introns
with those lacking any particular intron.
Intron Positions on the rRNA Primary Structure
The positions of spliceosomal, group I, group II, and
archaeal introns were included on a line representing the
primary structures of E. coli SSU and LSU rRNA (Fig. 4A).
The intron distributions were then studied to determine if
they differ significantly from the null hypothesis of a

"broken-stick" distribution [21,22]. This resource division
model, which has been used extensively to test hypotheses
about patterns of species abundance [e.g., [23]], specifies
a distribution that arises when a "stick" of unit length is
divided into n number of events with these events scattered with a uniform probability distribution. The events
break the stick into n + 1 intervals which can then be studied to determine if they depart from uniformity in the
probability density along the stick. Departure will tend to
make the longest intervals longer and the shortest intervals shorter [24]. In our analyses, the rRNA genes were the
sticks and the intron insertion sites were the events. The
metric used to compare the null (i.e., broken-stick) and
observed distribution was the standard deviation (SD)
from the mean interval length; i.e., lower SDs mean the
more uniform are the lengths of the intervals [e.g., [25]].

Column headings: Introns are positioned relative to SSU and LSU rRNA sites for positions with a nucleotide in more than 95% of the sequences
that are 1) 98–100%, 2) 90–97%, 3) 80–89%, and 4) either <80% conserved or positions that are present in <95% of the sequences in genes from;
3Dom2O, the three phylogenetic domains and two organelles; 3O, the three phylogenetic domains. Sites are the number of rRNA positions
followed by group I and spliceosomal introns in each conservation class and the number of observed and expected introns (in brackets [under a null
model of random insertion]) is shown for each gene. The P-values for each analysis are also shown. Significant probability values are marked with an
asterisk.

Computer simulations were used to determine the level of
significance at which the observed distributions could be
distinguished from those produced by the broken-stick
model.
A cursory analysis of the data suggests that the intron distribution in both SSU and LSU rRNAs is significantly clustered (in particular, the LSU rRNA) and the statistical
analysis bears this out. The observed standard deviations
for all the analyses (i.e., all the introns together or the spliceosomal and group I introns individually) are significantly different from the expectations of the broken stick
model. The departure from the null model is particularly
striking for the LSU rRNA, suggesting that the introns in
this gene are more strongly clustered than in the SSU
rRNA (see Fig. 4A,4B).

introns in different eukaryotes, and the uncertainty about
the phylogenetic relationship of these lineages within the
eukaryotic radiation often make it difficult to determine
unambiguously which spliceosomal introns are of early or
late origins [9]. 2) rRNAs have well-characterized secondary and tertiary structures [e.g., [26,27]]; therefore, if the
intron distribution reflects in some way RNA-folding patterns, then one can detect this by mapping the intron distribution on rRNA at the primary, secondary, and tertiary
structure levels [28]. 3) rRNA genes do not encode proteins; therefore, the Euascomycetes intron distribution
will not reflect constraints on sites of intron insertion due
to codon structure. In contrast, the role of intron phase
(i.e., between codons [phase 0] or within codons [phases
1,2]) and exon symmetry in explaining pre-mRNA intron
distribution remains a controversial and unresolved issue
in spliceosomal intron evolution [e.g., [29,30]].

Discussion
In this paper, we have focused on spliceosomal introns in
the Euascomycetes fungi to address how introns spread in
rRNA (and perhaps in all) genes. Potentially, the rRNA
spliceosomal introns offer three major advantages over
pre-mRNA introns that are relevant to understanding
intron spread: 1) the rRNA spliceosomal introns have
been inserted recently within the Euascomycetes [11,12].
In contrast, the sporadic distribution of pre-mRNA

The proto-splice site bounding rRNA introns
Our analysis of 100 nt of exon sequence flanking spliceosomal introns in Euascomycetes rRNA shows significant
support for a G – G or AG – G proto-splice site (Fig. 1).
The proto-splice site pre-dates intron insertion because it
is highly conserved in the Euascomycetes rRNAs in both
intron-containing and intron-less taxa (see Fig. 3, Table
2). This finding is not anomalous because analysis of exon

Analysis 4 rRNA intron distribution
Analysis of rRNA intron distribution. A. The positions of introns mapped on the homologous sites in the primary structure of
E. coli SSU and LSU rRNA. Group I and group II (underlined) introns are shown above the lines, whereas spliceosomal and
archaeal (underlined) introns are shown below the lines. B. Results of the broken-stick analysis of rRNA intron distribution.
The results of the simulations are shown as are the observed standard deviations for all introns or group I and spliceosomal
introns individually for both SSU and LSU rRNA genes.

sequences surrounding the total set of introns in S. cerevisiae pre-mRNA genes shows a preference for AAAG at the
5' splice site [31]. The final G in this motif has been
established as significantly conserved in yeast [32]. The
sequence at the proximal 5' exon region is required for
interactions with the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle U1 [19]. Our data are, therefore, consistent with present understanding of yeast pre-mRNA
splicing. Furthermore, taking at least 40% as the minimum for a consensus nucleotide in the proto-splice site,
Long et al. [33] have shown that this region in six model
eukaryotes often encode the AG – G or G – G motif. In
humans, for example, the nucleotides in the AG – G motif
are found in abundances of 61%, 81%, and 56%,
respectively. The finding of a similar motif in rRNA genes

for which there is neither a requirement to incorporate
amino acid phase distribution nor to invoke exon-shuffling provides support for the idea that a proto-splice site
for intron insertion not only exists in Euascomycetes
rRNA but also may exist in pre-mRNA genes. The introns
appear to be inserted into some of the most conserved
regions of Euascomycetes SSU rRNA, as evident in the fungal conservation diagram (Fig. 3) and the analysis of fungal nucleotide frequencies at the 5' and 3' nt flanking
introns (Table 2). However, the spliceosomal introns do
not map to the most conserved positions in the 3Dom or
3Dom2O rRNA datasets (Table 1).
Furthermore, exon sequences, outside of the proto-splice
site, may be required for splice site recognition by the spliPage 9 of 13

ceosome [34–38]. Our rRNA analyses suggest that G-rich
regions in the neighborhood (often upstream) of the
intron insertion sites may be potential ESEs. The exon
context may, therefore, play a fundamental role in controlling intron splicing and, thus, sites of intron fixation.
This idea has growing support in the literature [e.g.,
[19,38,39]]. Combined with this observation is the finding that rRNA spliceosomal introns map primarily to
regions in the interface surface of the SSU and LSU ribosome [28]. These sites presumably facilitate intron splicing
during ribosome biogenesis.
We find that in contrast to the spliceosomal introns in
rRNA, group I intron insertion sites show a stronger
positive association with highly conserved rRNA regions
(Fig. 3, Table 2), including those that bind tRNA [28], and
are more clustered than are spliceosomal introns in the
rRNA primary structure (Fig. 4). This suggests that group I
intron fixation may be even more highly constrained by
the exon context than are spliceosomal introns. A possible
explanation for this observation is that group I introns are
more dependent on specific upstream and downstream
exon sequences to build the P1 and P10 domains [40] to
facilitate proper folding prior to excision [e.g., [41]]). This
could limit the number of rRNA sites at which group I
introns can be fixed in comparison to spliceosomal
introns which have less specific exon sequence requirements for splicing.

Conclusions
Our findings provide concrete insights into rRNA intron
fixation and are more compatible with the view that both
the spliceosomal and group I intron distributions reflect
fundamental features of present-day genes and genomes
and that introns may not be relics of an ancient intronrich period of cells. An intriguing view on intron origin
was recently published using the tools of population
genetics. In this view, the richness of introns in multicellular organisms may primarily reflect the smaller population sizes of these taxa relative to protists, which generally
contain few introns. The large population sizes of unicellular eukaryotes may prevent widespread intron spread
due to secondary mutations that lead to their loss from
populations [42]. Interestingly, the lichenized Euascomycetes, which are particularly rich in both spliceosomal
and group I introns in their nuclear rRNA, are typically
extremely slow-growing taxa many of which have small
population sizes [e.g., [43]].

Methods
PCR Methods and the Intron Data
The spliceosomal introns described in Bhattacharya et al.
[12], plus 12 new positions that have become available in
GenBank, were used in this study, as well as 6 new sites
that we have found in the LSU rRNA genes of Buellia capi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/7

tis-regum, Buellia muriformis, Ionaspis lacustris, Physconia
enteroxantha, and Rinodina tunicata. To allow direct comparison between all rRNAs, the numbering of introns
reflects their relative positions in the E. coli coding
regions. DNA samples for Buellia spp., Rinodina, and Physconi were generously provided by T. Friedl (Göttingen).
Tissue from Ionaspis was a gift from F. Lutzoni (Duke).
DNA was extracted from Ionaspis as in Bhattacharya et al.
(2000). PCR reactions were done with the following prim2252ers:
1825-5'GTGATTTCTGCCCAGTGCTC3',
5'TTTAACAGATGTGCCGCC3',
22525'GGCGGCACATCTGTTAAA3',
and
2746-5'
GATTCTGRCTTAGAGGCGTTC3'. The primer names refer
to their position relative to the LSU rRNA of E. coli. PCR
amplification products were cloned in the pGEM-T
(Promega) vector and sequenced over both strands.
Together, the fungal spliceosomal data set included 49
different introns at the following sites (the species from
which they were isolated and GenBank accession numbers, where available, are also shown): SSU rRNA – 265

of the distantly related stramenopile, Cymatosira belgica
(X85387). This diatom is the sole known organism
outside of the fungi to contain rDNA spliceosomal
introns. In addition, the fungal 674, 1057, 1514 SSU
rRNA and 1093, 1098, and 1849 LSU rRNA introns were
not included in the information analysis because of missing data or ambiguous sequences (see below). The SSU
674 site (Physconia detersa, AJ240495), for example, only
included 10 nt of the 5' and 3' region in the GenBank
accession [11]. All fungal and diatom intron sites were,
however, mapped on the conservation diagrams to understand their distribution (see below).
We have made, on the basis of detailed analysis of rRNA
flanking regions, a number of corrections in the positions
of the introns within the SSU rRNA (e.g., 1129 is now at
1229 and 1510 is now at 1514). Copies of the manuscript
figures and tables and additional materials related to this
work are available from the Gutell Laboratory's CRW Site
at
http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/ANALYSIS/FUN
GINT/[44]. This page includes detailed rRNA conservation and intron position data (both the version used for
the manuscript and current values that are updated daily),
fungal nucleotide frequency values, and the SSU and LSU
rRNA sequence alignments used in Table 2.
Information Analysis of the rRNA Introns
An information analysis was done of the 50 nt upstream
and downstream of the different rRNA spliceosomal
intron sites to determine the total amount of exonic information (in "bits") that is available to the spliceosome for
splicing. We used the web-based logo program of
Gorodkin et al. [45]http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~gorodkin/
appl/slogo.html to derive the sequence logos and the
information content of individual sites was calculated
according to the expression of Hertz and Stormo [17].
Type 2 logos were drawn in which the height of the nucleotides in the sequence column represented their frequency in proportion to their expected frequency. The
expected nucleotide probabilities were estimated from the
observed nucleotide frequencies over all sites for 80 Euascomycetes rRNA sequences (A = 26%, C = 22%, G = 27%,
T = 25% [12]). The nucleotides were turned upside-down
when the observed frequency was less than expected [45].
A total of 43 spliceosomal intron sites, for which 50 nt of
both upstream and downstream exon sequence are available, were included in this analysis.

To put the information content in perspective, we also did
simulations in which 43 random sequence data sets of
length 100 nt (for flanking exons) and 109 (total number
of introns analyzed) random data sets of length 29 nt (for
conserved intron regions) were generated at the nucleotide frequencies of Euascomycetes rRNA and the information content of these was calculated. A total of 100,000

iterations were done with each data set to create null distributions of random information content. The observed
information values were then compared to the null distributions to infer their probabilities.
Analysis of G-Content in Euascomycetes SSU rRNAs
Because it is difficult to see the pattern of G-content along
the sequence based on the raw data, we fit a smooth curve
to the frequencies of G using the method of local regression (loess, [20]). This smooth curve captures the G-content pattern along the nucleotide sites. Loess is a
nonparametric curve fitting technique that fits the data in
a local fashion. That is, for the fit at site x, the fit is made
using the G-frequencies at the points in a neighbourhood
of x, weighted by their distance from x. A tricubic weighting function (proportional to [1 - (distance/max distance)^3)^3]) is used for calculating the weights. For both
the LSUrRNA and SSUrRNA sequence alignment data sets,
we used a neighborhood of 50 nt (and 100 nt) in fitting
the loess curve. Thus the value of the curve at each site is
computed as a weighted average of the G-frequency at the
site itself, the G-frequencies at the 25 up-stream sites, and
the G-frequencies at the 25 down-stream sites.
Positions of Introns Relative to Conserved rRNA Regions
To assess the patterns of sequence conservation in exon
sequences flanking all rRNA spliceosomal and group I
introns, we mapped intron positions on structure conservation diagrams. Group I introns in different subclasses
(e.g., IC1, IE [46,47]) which occupied the same rRNA site
were counted as separate intron insertions. This
accounted for our observation that certain rRNA sites
(e.g., SSU 788, 1199, LSU 1949, 2500 [see CRW Site for
details]) are "hot" spots for insertion with multiple, evolutionarily divergent introns being fixed at the same site in
different species or in different genomes (i.e., nuclear vs.
organellar). The actual number of independent hits at
rRNA sites is, however, likely to be much greater than our
estimate but this can only be proven with rigorous phylogenetic analysis of group I introns at different insertion
sites to show that in some cases, introns in the same subclass at the same site in different species have a high probability of independent origin [e.g., [48,49]]. The first set of
conservation diagrams used in our analysis was based on
the comparison of 6389 and 922 different SSU and LSU
rRNA sequences, respectively, from the three phylogenetic
domains and the two organelles (3Dom2O) that were
superimposed on the secondary structures of the
Escherichia coli rRNAs. The second set of diagrams was a
summary of 5591 and 585 different SSU and LSU rRNA
sequences, respectively, from the three phylogenetic
domains (3Dom) also mapped on the E. coli rRNAs. These
diagrams are available at the CRW Site. Multiway contingency table analysis was done to determine whether sites
that were 98–100%, 90–97%, 80–89%, and <80% con-

served in the diagrams were independent of intron insertion sites (the null hypothesis). Intron sites were taken as
the nucleotide immediately preceding the intron insertion. We also calculated nucleotide frequencies for each
SSU and LSU rRNA site using the S. cerevisiae genes for
numbering. Frequencies were calculated for alignments of
all available fungal rRNAs (1434 SSU and 880 LSU
sequences) and of only fungi containing spliceosomal
introns (73 SSU and 40 LSU sequences), or of fungi lacking spliceosomal introns (1361 sequences for SSU, 840
for LSU). These frequencies were used to determine the
level of conservation of nucleotides encoding the protosplice site in intron-containing and intron-less fungal
species.

rRNA Intron Distribution
The positions of all known spliceosomal, group I, group
II, and tRNA-like archaeal [50] introns were marked on
the primary structures of E. coli SSU and LSU rRNA. These
data, which also accounted for multiple group I intron
hits at the same rRNA site, were then studied to determine
whether they differ significantly from the null expectation
of a random distribution (i.e., "the broken stick distribution"). We used the program PowerNiche V1.0 (P. Drozd,
V. Novotny, unpublished data) to generate sticks of length
1542 nt (SSU rRNA) or 2904 nt (LSU rRNA) which were
randomly broken by n = 101 events for all introns (including group II and archaeal), or n = 56 for only group I, or n
= 26 for only spliceosomal introns in SSU rRNA. For the
LSU rRNA, the stick was broken into n = 107 events for all
introns, or n = 68 for only group I, or n = 25 for only spliceosomal introns. The paucity of rRNA group II introns (3
and 8 introns in the SSU and LSU rRNA, respectively) and
archaeal introns (14 and 6 introns in the SSU and LSU
rRNA, respectively) did not allow their individual analysis. A mean number of intervals and a SD were calculated
for each broken-stick. The SDs of 1000 simulations were
compared to the SD of the observed data to test whether
the observed pattern was likely to have been produced
under the assumptions of the broken-stick model.
