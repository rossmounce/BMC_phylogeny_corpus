The mode and tempo of hepatitis C virus
evolution within and among hosts

Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a rapidly-evolving RNA virus that establishes chronic infections in humans.
Despite the virus’ public health importance and a wealth of sequence data, basic aspects of HCV molecular
evolution remain poorly understood. Here we investigate three sets of whole HCV genomes in order to directly
compare the evolution of whole HCV genomes at different biological levels: within- and among-hosts. We use a
powerful Bayesian inference framework that incorporates both among-lineage rate heterogeneity and phylogenetic
uncertainty into estimates of evolutionary parameters.
Results: Most of the HCV genome evolves at ~0.001 substitutions/site/year, a rate typical of RNA viruses. The
antigenically-important E1/E2 genome region evolves particularly quickly, with correspondingly high rates of
positive selection, as inferred using two related measures. Crucially, in this region an exceptionally higher rate was
observed for within-host evolution compared to among-host evolution. Conversely, higher rates of evolution were
seen among-hosts for functionally relevant parts of the NS5A gene. There was also evidence for slightly higher
evolutionary rate for HCV subtype 1a compared to subtype 1b.
Conclusions: Using new statistical methods and comparable whole genome datasets we have quantified, for the
first time, the variation in HCV evolutionary dynamics at different scales of organisation. This confirms that
differences in molecular evolution between biological scales are not restricted to HIV and may represent a
common feature of chronic RNA viral infection. We conclude that the elevated rate observed in the E1/E2 region
during within-host evolution more likely results from the reversion of host-specific adaptations (resulting in slower
long-term among-host evolution) than from the preferential transmission of slowly-evolving lineages.

Background
Rapidly-evolving RNA viruses that establish chronic
infections, such as the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV), appear to exhibit
qualitatively different evolutionary dynamics when their
genetic diversity is studied at different organisational
scales [1,2]. Within-host evolutionary dynamics can be
observed by comparing sequences that represent different virions sampled from a single infected individual
over several years, whereas among-host evolution is
revealed by collating sequences that each represent a

different infected host. The most significant distinction
between these two levels is that the evolution of amonghost sequences is shaped by numerous genetic bottlenecks arising from transmission events, whereas that of
within-host sequences is not.
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) (family Flaviviridae,
genus Hepacivirus) infects more than 180 million people
worldwide and is a leading global cause of liver disease
and liver cancer [3,4]. Understanding the evolution of
HCV has considerable medical relevance. For example,
viral diversity is known to play a key role in determining
both the outcome of long-term chronic infection and
the likelihood of success of anti-viral drug therapy
[5-10]. However, despite the wealth of HCV sequence
data and the relevance of HCV genetic diversity to public health, many aspects of HCV molecular evolution are

poorly understood, particularly in comparison to HIV,
despite HCV having a higher overall global prevalence
that HIV. One of the most fundamental aspects of HCV
evolution is its genomic rate of molecular evolution. Previous estimates of HCV evolutionary rates have employed
a number of different estimation methods, genome
regions and scales of analysis, hindering direct comparisons, and few have systematically considered the variation in evolutionary rate along the whole HCV genome
and its causes [11]. The HCV genome encodes a single
polyprotein ~3000 amino acids in length, comprising
three structural (Core, E1 and E2) and seven non-structural genes (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5a and NS5b)
[12]. The E2 envelope glycoprotein contains ‘hyper-variable regions’ (HVRs) that are targeted by the human
humoral immune response [13]. An additional limitation
of previous studies is that they have typically assumed
that evolutionary rates are constant among lineages and
through time (known as the ‘strict’ or ‘single rate’ molecular clock hypothesis). Although statistical tests of this
hypothesis for HCV are not always significant (e.g.
[14,15]), such failures to reject the strict clock are most
likely a reflection of small sample sizes, because larger
HCV data sets indicate significant among-lineage rate
variability [11,16]. Furthermore, previous studies have
typically evaluated HCV rates using a single estimated
phylogeny, thus ignoring an important source of statistical error (although [11] approximated this error through
bootstrapping procedures). Many previous studies used
non-phylogenetic methods (such as the relative-rates
test) to estimate the HCV evolutionary rate, which are
now known to be less efficient and potentially more
biased than phylogenetic approaches [17].
Previous analyses of HCV molecular evolution also
have been restricted to a single evolutionary scale. It has
been demonstrated that the evolutionary dynamics of
HIV differ substantially among levels of organisation
[2,18]. For example, HIV-1 within-host evolutionary
rates are higher [1] and more variable [19] than those
among-hosts. Although the biological causes of these
differences are as yet unknown, possible explanations
include preferential transmission of slowly-evolving
lineages, a decreasing within-host evolutionary rate
through time, or viral reversion to variants of higher fitness upon transmission to a new host [1]. Crucially, it is
not known whether these scale-dependent differences
are peculiar to HIV-1 or whether other chronic viral
infections, such those caused by HCV, exhibit similar
behaviour. Detailed investigation of multi-level evolution
in viral populations - for which much data are available
- may help to build a more general understanding of
this complex evolutionary phenomenon.
Here, for the first time, we quantify and compare the
within- and among-host molecular evolution of whole

HCV genomes. We avoid the methodological limitations
outlined above by analysing whole genome sequences
and employing a ‘relaxed molecular clock’ approach that
explicitly models and estimates the level of rate variation
among lineages [20]. This approach is implemented in a
Bayesian inference framework [21] that incorporates
phylogenetic uncertainty into estimates of evolutionary
parameters. In addition to employing powerful methods
of analysis, we study the entire HCV genome using a
partition approach, thereby revealing how scale-dependent evolution affects different viral genome regions in
different ways.

Methods
Datasets

We compiled three datasets, one representing only evolution within infected hosts, the other two representing
evolution at the ‘epidemiological’ or among-host level.
To maximise compatibility and statistical power, we
sought data sets comprising sequences from the same
subtype sampled over at least 20 years, and which contain complete or near-complete viral genomes.
Our within-host data set is based on HCV subtype 1b
genomes obtained from 15 women who were all infected
by a contaminated blood product (anti-D immunoglobulin) that had been generated from a single HCV-infected
blood donation ([22]; coloured red in all figures). This
data set comprises full-length genomic HCV sequences
from 15 patients, sampled at two time-points, plus an
additional sequence sampled in 1977 from the HCVinfected blood donation (n = 31; sampling dates range
from 1977 to 2000; [23]. Since the contaminated blood
product contained little viral diversity [24], all recipients
were infected with very similar viral sequences; hence
this data set represents - perhaps uniquely - 15 independent within-host evolutionary histories, yet contains no
secondary transmission events. Among-lineage rate variation in these sequences therefore reflects in equal part
variation in evolutionary rate among infected hosts and
among different lineages within a host. Accession numbers and isolate sampling dates of all sequences used in
this study are listed in Additional file 1, Table S1.
We obtained two data sets representing evolution at
the among-host level. We collected all available HCV
genotype 1 whole genome sequences from the Broad
Institute database http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/viral/HCV. These genomes were split into two data
sets, comprising 334 subtype 1a and 149 subtype 1b
genomes, respectively. In all figures the subtype 1a data
set is coloured green and the subtype 1b data set
coloured blue. Sequences were primarily collected in the
USA (n = 377) as well as from Switzerland (n = 88) and
Germany (n = 18). To aid computational efficiency, the
subtype 1a and 1b datasets were reduced in size,

Gray et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/131

resulting in two final alignments comprising 63 subtype
1a and 54 subtype 1b sequences. Retained sequences
were chosen such that the original temporal range of
the initial dataset (1989-2008) was maintained, by randomly excluding sequences from over-represented years.
Both among-host data sets represent HCV evolution
across several decades of epidemic transmission, hence
each branch in their phylogenies will represent a number of transmission events.
Model selection procedure

To select the best-fitting evolutionary model for Bayesian MCMC inference, we performed an initial series of
model selection analyses using BEAST v1.5.4. MCMC
output was inspected for convergence by visual inspection of the chain and by calculation of effective sample
size statistics, as implemented in Tracer v1.5 http://tree.
bio.ed.ac.uk. Where necessary, MCMC operators were
optimised by trial and error to improve chain mixing.
Various different substitution, coalescent and molecular
clock models were compared by calculating Bayes Factors (BF), which is the difference in log marginal likelihoods between two model combinations [25,26]. We
calculated approximate marginal likelihoods for each
model via importance sampling using the harmonic
mean of the sampled likelihoods (with the posterior as
the importance distribution; see [27]). Evidence against
the null model (i.e. the model with lower marginal likelihood) is indicated by 2ln(BF) >3 (positive evidence) and
>10 (strong evidence).
In all datasets, nucleotide sites were assigned to two
partitions: (i) 1 st & 2 nd codon positions and (ii) 3 rd
codon positions. Our preliminary analyses indicated that
a good fit to the data was obtained by ascribing a separate HKY nucleotide substitution model and a separate
gamma among-site rate heterogeneity model to each of
the two codon partitions (equivalent to the model
described in [28]). This substitution model was sufficiently computationally-efficient to permit MCMC convergence (data not shown) and was therefore used
throughout the remainder of the study. For the withinhost data set, phylogenetic priors were used to represent
known epidemiological information about the transmission chain: specifically, all sequences from the infected
patients (i.e. all except the single sequence from the
infected blood donation) were constrained to be a
monophyletic group, and a prior normal distribution
was imposed on the date of the common ancestor of
this group (mean = 25 years before present and variance
= 1 year).
Both strict and relaxed molecular clock models were
tested for each of the three datasets using the Bayes Factor test as described above. The uncorrelated lognormal
relaxed molecular clock model (UCLN) was used, which

provides an estimate of the ‘coefficient of variation’ statistic, representing the scaled variance in evolutionary
rate among lineages (see [20] for details). This statistic
is usefully interpreted as indicating the degree to which
molecular evolution is ‘clock-like’. A posterior distribution for the coefficient of variation that does not include
zero indicates that the relaxed clock model provides a
better fit to the data than the strict clock. Having chosen the optimal molecular clock model for each data
set, we tested three different coalescent models: (i) constant population size, (ii) exponential growth, and (iii)
the flexible Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) model. The optimal coalescent model was also chosen using Bayes Factors. Note that in this study, the coalescent model is
being used as a prior distribution for phylogenies, whose
parameters are marginalised and ignored, and not as an
explicit model of the population under study.
Genomic partition model

After the selection of the most appropriate molecular
clock and coalescent models, each data set was split into
21 non-overlapping partitions 432 nt in length, beginning at the start codon of the Core gene. In order to
estimate separate molecular clock parameters for each
partition whilst simultaneously minimising estimation
variance, we implemented a genomic partition model in
BEAST v1.5.4 [21]. This model estimated separate molecular clock parameters and nucleotide frequencies for
each partition, whilst all partitions share the same
underlying nucleotide substitution model (as above),
coalescent model parameters, and phylogenetic tree,
thus making the most statistically efficient use of the
available sequence information. XML files for performing these analyses are available on request. Partitions
were kept of equal length (and not adjusted to coincide
with gene boundaries) so that intra-genic variation
could be measured and so that estimation uncertainty
could be directly compared among genome regions. We
deliberately ignored the alternate open reading frame in
the Core gene, as its molecular evolution is under no
selective constraints (e.g. [29]). This ORF therefore has
no effect on the evolution of the HCV main reading
frame
Partition specific dn/ds analyses

It was computationally-impractical to calculate dn/ds
ratios for each partition whilst simultaneously incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty, hence we began by estimating a maximum likelihood (ML) tree for each of the
three datasets using PhyML, under a HKY model of
nucleotide substitution with gamma distributed site variation. The ratio of replacement-to-silent nucleotide
substitution (dn/ds) and the transition/transversion ratio
were calculated separately for each of the 21 non-

Results

variability in evolutionary rate among lineages. As
expected for a continuous protein-coding region, the
relative evolutionary rate of 1st and 2nd codon positions
was significantly lower than that of the 3rd codon position (two-tailed T-test p < 0.01).

Model selection procedure

Table 1 shows the estimated statistical and evolutionary
parameters for each model combination we investigated.
For all three data sets, the relaxed clock model provided
a much better fit than the strict clock model (BF>20).
Although the choice of coalescent model did not significantly affect model fit (BF<3 for most comparisons), the
MCMC under the constant size model failed to converge (data not shown). This is perhaps unsurprising, as
phylogenies estimated from all data sets are star-like in
shape (i.e. long terminal branches) and therefore poorly
characterised by a constant-size coalescent model.
For all three data sets, the estimated genomic rate of
evolution was consistent among all of the coalescent
models investigated under the relaxed clock assumption
(Table 1). For the among-host subtype 1a data set, the
mean genome-wide rate was estimated to be 1.44 - 1.48
× 10-3 substitutions/site/year (among different coalescent models), while the equivalent rates for the subtype
1b data set were slightly lower (1.18 - 1.25 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year). The within-host genome-wide evolutionary rate was lower still than the two among-host
datasets (1.11 - 1.13 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year). For
all analyses, the lower confidence limit of the coefficient
of variation statistic (which measures ‘un-clock-likeness’)
was above zero, indicating statistically-significant

Genomic partition model

In light of the model selection results, the relaxed molecular clock was used in the genomic partition analysis.
Since neither the BSP nor the exponential coalescent
model was statistically favoured, we chose the model
that exhibited the best MCMC mixing behaviour (BSP
for the among-host datasets; exponential for the withinhost dataset). For each genomic partition, we estimated
the following parameters: (i) mean substitution rate, (ii)
relaxed clock coefficient of variation, (iii) the relative
rate of codon positions 1+2 to that of codon position 3.
The estimated values for each of these parameters are
shown in Figure 1, with both the point estimate (dots)
and the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) confidence
limits (vertical lines) shown for each parameter in each
partition.
Figure 1a shows clear trends in evolutionary rate variation across the genome. In the majority of partitions
the mean evolutionary rate of the among-host subtype
1a data set was slightly higher than that of subtype 1b
(in agreement with the whole genome values presented
in Table 1). For most of the non-structural genes (p7,
NS2, NS3, NS4a, NS5a and NS5b), mean evolutionary
rate was consistently about 1.0 × 10-3 substitutions/site/
year, for all three datasets. However, notably higher

Gray et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:131

rates were observed for the subtype 1a among-host data
set, in the 16th and 17th partitions (3’ end of the NS5a
gene), which contain functionally important domains
(see Discussion for details). Within the structural genes
(Core, E1 and E2) estimated mean evolutionary rates
were low for the Core region (0.28 - 0.43 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year) and high in partitions 3 and 4 (the Cterminus of E1 and N-terminus of E2). Partition 3 corresponds to the location of the hyper-variable region
HVRI (2.5 - 6.9 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year). Partition
4, which includes the HVRII and III regions, also exhibited an elevated evolutionary rate in all three data sets
(2.4 - 2.7 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year). Overall, variation in mean evolutionary rate is greater among genome
regions than among the three data sets, with one very
notable exception: the evolutionary rate of partition 3
(containing the HVRI) is remarkably higher for the
within-host data set than for the two among-host data
sets. The G/C content at each codon position was similar among datasets, being higher at the 3rd position than
at the 1st or 2nd positions (Additional file 2, Figure S1),
as previously reported [31].
For each partition, we also estimated the coefficient of
variation (COV) statistic (Figure 1b). In general, the
mean and variance of this parameter was significantly
higher for the within-host dataset, hence among-branch
rate variation is much higher in this data set than in the
among-host data sets. In several partitions, the lower
HPD confidence limit was close to zero, indicating that
the strict clock hypothesis could not be excluded in
these instances. Mean COV values for among-host data
sets were typically around 0.2-0.3, in line with previous
estimates for HIV [19] with the exception of the Core
gene, which exhibited values >0.5. For the within-host
dataset, COV estimates were also elevated for the last
two genomic partitions (covering the C-terminus of
NS5b).
We also estimated the ratio of the evolutionary rate at
codon positions 1 & 2 to that at codon position 3 (the
codon rate-ratio, CRR). This ratio can be computed
concurrently with other molecular clock parameters and
can be used to investigate selective pressures acting on
gene sequences, because almost all changes at codon
positions 1 & 2 are non-synonymous and the majority
of changes at codon position 3 are synonymous. Estimates of the CRR for each genomic partition are shown
in Figure 1c. In general, the CRR was low between partitions 8 and 20, corresponding to most of the non-structural genome region, indicating on average strong
selective constraint. Partitions 16 and 21, however, have
raised CRR values for the among-host data sets. CRR
values are slightly higher in the E1, E2 and NS2 genes,
with a particularly high ratio observed for the withinhost data set in partition 3.

Page 6 of 10

To determine whether the elevated evolutionary rate
and correspondingly high CRR of partition 3 in the
within-host data set was independent of the 3rd codon
position rate, we plotted the absolute rates for the 1st
+2 nd versus 3 rd codon positions for each partition
(Additional file 3, Figure S2). As expected, the 1st+2nd
position rate was much lower than the 3rd position rate
for all partitions in the among-host datasets. For partition 3 of intra-host dataset, the 1 st +2 nd position rate
(0.008 subs./site/year) was greater than the 3rd position
rate (0.005 subs./site/year). However, in this partition
the 3rd position rates for the intra-host datasets were
also significantly elevated. The lowest 3rd position rates
were observed in partitions 1 and 21. This is consistent
with the presence of RNA secondary structure (stemloops) in these regions of the HCV coding region [32].
This structure will likely impose selective constraints on
3rd codon positions, resulting in a lower evolutionary
rate at silent sites. However, we observed no consistent
effect of RNA secondary structure on CRR values: in
partition 21 the CRR is raised, which could reflect a
lower rate of silent change, whereas the CRR in partition
1 is very low. When evolutionary rates vary among
silent sites, dn/ds ratios are commonly interpreted as
measures of the difference in selection pressure between
replacement and silent sites [33] and we propose that
the CRR ratio should be interpreted similarly.
Visual inspection of Figure 1 suggests that genomic
partitions with high evolutionary rates also have a high
CRR. To test for correlations among the three molecular
clock parameters (mean rate, COV, and CRR), Figure 2
shows scatterplots among all estimated parameter
values. There is a clear positive correlation between
mean rate and CRR (Figure 2a; p < 0.001) which is
robust to the exclusion of the outlying data point (p <
0.001). In contrast, there is no clear correlation between
mean rate and COV (Figure 2b; p = 0.34), nor between
CRR and COV (Figure 2c; p = 0.67). Figures 2b and 2c
do, however, clearly illustrate the higher COV values for
the within-host data set.
Lastly, to investigate the relationship between CRR
and the more widely-used dn/ds ratio, we estimated dn/
ds values for each partition and data set using PAML
[30] (see Methods). Figure 3 shows the scatterplot of
dn/ds versus CRR values, which, as expected, are
strongly correlated (p < 0.001). The estimated regression
relationship between these two variables is dn/ds = 2.44.
CRR (assuming no error distribution for the dn/ds
values; also robust to the exclusion of the outlying data
point; p < 0.001).

approaches. Early studies approximated HCV evolutionary rates by simply counting the number of observed
changes between sequences sampled at different times
from infected patients [34,35] or from a chimpanzee
[36]. Subsequent studies used nucleotide substitution
models to estimate genetic distances, but commonly

focused only on sub-genomic regions, particularly the
Core, E1/E2 and NS5B genes (e.g. [14,37]). Rates of evolution have been estimated using (i) relative-rate methods (e.g. Ina et al [38]), (ii) linear regressions of genetic
distances against sampling times (e.g. Tanaka et al.
[39]), (iii) maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods (e.
g.[15]) and (iv) Bayesian phylogenetic methods (e.g.
[40]). Some analyses were performed on among-host
data, some on within-host sequences, and others on a
combination of both. Unsurprisingly, estimates of the
tempo of HCV evolution from these various studies
have been highly variable and are impossible to compare
directly due to the different methodologies and genome
regions employed.
Our study of HCV molecular evolution has employed
powerful statistical methods [20] in a consistent manner,
enabling us to make reliable inferences about how HCV
sequence evolution varies among genome regions, and
how it varies between different levels of organisation. As
expected, the variation we observed in evolutionary rate
across the genome closely matches genomic variation in
overall HCV genetic diversity (previously measured in
[11,41]). While most of the HCV genome evolves at
~0.001 substitutions/site/year, a rate very typical of
RNA viruses [42], the E1/E2 region (partitions 3 and 4)
exhibited the highest evolutionary rates, consistent with
previous reports (e.g. Itakura et al. [23]). This region
contains several known antibody epitopes and hypervariable regions, and our high CRR and dn/ds values in
these regions confirm the action of positive selection
[5,8,23].
A striking result from this study was the elevated evolutionary rate in the intra-host dataset for partition 3
when compared to the among-host dataset. Several
explanations are possible. First, we might hypothesise

Gray et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/131

that saturation of nucleotide changes (and hence underestimation of genetic distance) is occurring at the
among-host level but not at the within-host level.
Although this phenomenon is certainly important for
rapidly-evolving viruses when evolution measured over
several decades is extrapolated to thousands of years (e.g.
[43]), it is very unlikely to be responsible for our result,
since our within-host and among-host timescales differ
only by a factor of 3. Additionally, we found no evidence
of saturation at the 3rd codon position in partitions 3 and
4 for the within-host dataset (data not shown). A second
explanation follows from the primary difference between
the within- and among-host datasets: the latter contains
transmission events while the former does not. Upon
transmission to a new host, specific mutations that conferred a fitness advantage in the immune environment of
the donor may be lost or quickly revert to wild-type in
the new environment of the recipient. This phenomenon
has been reported for both HCV [44-47] and HIV [48]
and is consistent with the observation of an elevated rate
in the epitope-rich region (E1/E2) of the HCV genome
when transmission bottlenecks are absent (i.e. the withinhost dataset). Reversion is also consistent with the elevated CRR in this region, which indicates a higher net
rate of adaptation within hosts. A third and intriguing
possibility is that slowly-evolving lineages within a host
are preferentially-transmitted, resulting in a lower longterm evolutionary rate [1]. This is consistent with the
high among-branch rate variation (COV) observed
within-hosts here, and for HIV-1 elsewhere [19], suggesting that there is significant variation in the rate of evolution of different lineages within an infected host.
However, preferential transmission of slower-evolving
lineages should result in a lower among-host long-term
replication rate (and thus a lower 3 rd codon position
rate) equally across all partitions - which is not observed
in our data (Additional file 3, Figure S2).
We did observe a consistently higher genome-wide
among-host evolutionary rate for subtype 1a in comparison with subtype 1b. This difference could be a consequence of the major modes of transmission of that
characterise each subtype: subtype 1a is more commonly
associated with intravenous drug use and subtype 1b
with past blood transfusions. If within-host HCV evolution is faster at the start of chronic infection (possibly
due to adaptation to the new host; [41]) then the longterm among-host rate of evolution will depend to some
extent on the rate of transmission [24]. A similar phenomenon, albeit more extreme, has been previously
reported for HTLV-II, for which differences in the rate
of transmission among different risk groups greatly
affect the long-term evolutionary rate [49]. Our data
cannot indicate whether average evolutionary rates vary

Page 8 of 10

during the course of a single chronic infection, and this
question remains an important area for future research.
A higher rate evolution for subtype 1a was especially
pronounced for partitions 16 and 17, which contain
functionally important genome regions within the NS5a
gene. Interestingly, this elevated rate resulted from an
increase in 1+2nd substitutions, suggesting the presence
of selected sites for this subtype. NS5a forms a necessary
part of the replication complex but its function is not
fully understood [50]. It is involved in cellular pathways
including the interferon response [51] and genetic variation within NS5a has been associated with response to
anti-viral drug therapy. Specifically, partition 16 contains
the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR), variation within which is reported to predict response to
interferon drug therapy [52], although inconsistently
between subtypes 1a and 1b [53] and with different
results observed in Japanese and European cohorts [50].
The PKR binding domain (which includes the ISDR)
and the “V3” region, are also included in partition 16,
changes within which may be related to treatment outcome [54]. Similarly, partition 17 contains the less wellstudied interferon/ribavirin-resistance determining
region (IRRDR) [55], in which excess mutations in
patients infected with subtype 1b were more likely to
respond to therapy [56]. The possible difference in
selective pressure between 1a and 1b that we observed
in this region is consistent with subtype-specific differences in resistance mutations in NS5a against the potent
viral inhibitor BMS-790052 [57]. Information on drug
treatment was unavailable for the subjects included in
this study, and although differences in treatments are
unlikely to account for the observed differences in this
region, the possibility cannot be excluded.

Conclusions
Because our study employed powerful statistical methods on whole genome sequences, we have been able to
quantify the variation in HCV evolutionary dynamics at
different scales of organisation for the first time, and
thereby confirm that scale-dependent differences in rate
are not restricted to HIV and may represent a common
feature of chronic RNA viral infection. We posit that
the most likely explanation of our current data is that
host-specific reversion events are responsible for an elevated rate of evolution and adaptation in the E1/E2
region within-hosts compared to among-hosts.
