Abstract
Background: Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is one of the most infectious human bacterial
pathogens. It is phagocytosed by immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages. The precise mechanisms that
initiate bacterial uptake have not yet been elucidated. Participation of C3, CR3, class A scavenger receptors and
mannose receptor in bacterial uptake have been already reported. However, contribution of an additional, as-yetunidentified receptor for F. tularensis internalization has been suggested.
Results: We show here that cell-surface expressed nucleolin is a receptor for Francisella tularensis Live Vaccine
Strain (LVS) and promotes LVS binding and infection of human monocyte-like THP-1 cells. The HB-19
pseudopeptide that binds specifically carboxy-terminal RGG domain of nucleolin inhibits LVS binding and infection
of monocyte-like THP-1 cells. In a pull-down assay, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), a GTP-binding protein involved
in protein translation, usually found in cytoplasm, was recovered among LVS bacterial membrane proteins bound
on RGG domain of nucleolin. A specific polyclonal murine antibody was raised against recombinant LVS EF-Tu.
By fluorescence and electron microscopy experiments, we found that a fraction of EF-Tu could be detected at
the bacterial surface. Anti-EF-Tu antibodies reduced LVS binding to monocyte-like THP-1 cells and impaired
infection, even in absence of complement and complement receptors. Interaction between EF-Tu and nucleolin
was illustrated by two different pull-down assays using recombinant EF-Tu proteins and either RGG domain of
nucleolin or cell solubilized nucleolin.
Discussion: Altogether, our results demonstrate that the interaction between surface nucleolin and its bacterial
ligand EF-Tu plays an important role in Francisella tularensis adhesion and entry process and may therefore facilitate
invasion of host tissues. Since phagosomal escape and intra-cytosolic multiplication of LVS in infected monocytes
are very similar to those of human pathogenic F. tularensis ssp tularensis, the mechanism of entry into monocytelike THP-1 cells, involving interaction between EF-Tu and nucleolin, might be similar in the two subspecies. Thus,
the use of either nucleolin-specific pseudopeptide HB-19 or recombinant EF-Tu could provide attractive
therapeutic approaches for modulating F. tularensis infection.

Background
Francisella tularensis is a small non-motile Gram-negative
bacterium that causes the zoonotic disease tularemia in
large number of animals, such as rabbits, hares, and small
rodents [1]. F. tularensis is also one of the most infectious
human bacterial pathogens as ten bacteria can cause disease in humans [1,2]. Humans acquire infection by direct
contact with sick animals, inhalation, ingestion of contaminated water or food, or by bites from ticks, mosquitoes or flies. F. tularensis has significant potential as an
agent of bio-terrorism due to its infectivity and capacity to
infect in form of aerosols and its ability to cause illness
and death [1]. The two primary human pathogens are F.
tularensis subspecies tularensis (type A strain) and F. tularensis subspecies holarctica (type B strain). F. tularensis live
vaccine strain (LVS) is an attenuated type B strain [3].
Other subspecies (ssp) of F. tularensis exist: F. tularensis ssp
mediasiatica, and F. tularensis ssp novicida. The four subspecies differ in terms of their pathogenicity and geographic
origin, but are phylogenetically very closely related. F.
tularensis is a highly virulent facultative intracellular bacterium, replicating intracellularly and disseminating
within host mononuclear phagocytes. After entry into
macrophages, F. tularensis initially resides in the phagosome, whose maturation is then arrested. After 2 hours of
infection, the phagosome membrane is disrupted and the
bacterium replicates freely in the cytoplasm of the macrophages [3,4].
While several molecular aspects of the intracellular life of
F. tularensis after entry have been elucidated, the exact
mechanisms that mediate uptake of this highly infectious
bacterium are still not fully understood. Participation of
C3 [5], CR3 [6], class A scavenger receptors [7] and mannose receptor [8] in bacterial uptake have been already
reported. However, contribution of an additional, as-yetunidentified receptor for F. tularensis internalization has
been suggested [8].
In the present work, we evaluated whether nucleolin
could serve as a cell surface receptor for LVS and mediate
its binding and subsequent internalization. Indeed, nucleolin has been shown to be localized not only in the
nucleus [9], but also on the cell surface and to mediate
internalization of specific ligands, including HIV particles
[10,11]. In response to binding of a ligand to surface
nucleolin, ligand-nucleolin complexes become internalized, by an active process, therefore allowing intracellular
import of the ligand. Nucleolin, expressed at the cell surface in a high molecular weight protein complex, is in
close association with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton
[12]. Participation of actin microfilaments in uptake of F.
tularensis was supported by its inhibition by cytochalasin
B [5,13]. Nucleolin is also involved in cell proliferation
[9] and in activation of CD21 on B cells [14]. Of particular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/145

interest, nucleolin has been recently described as a receptor for the adhesin of E. coli O157:H7 [15,16].
We herein demonstrate that surface nucleolin present on
human monocyte-like THP-1 cells is a functional receptor
for LVS. Moreover, we demonstrate that the LVS bacterial
ligand for human nucleolin is elongation factor Tu (EFTu). We also provide evidence that EF-Tu, a GTP-binding
protein usually found in cytosol [17], is present in the LVS
membranes and exposed on bacterial surface. Finally, we
show that nucleolin expressed on the surface of human
monocyte-like THP-1 cells interacts, through its C-terminal RGG domain, with the bacterial surface-exposed EFTu protein. This nucleolin – EF-Tu interaction plays an
important role in F. tularensis LVS adhesion and entry
process and may therefore facilitate invasion of host tissue.

Methods
Human cells, bacteria, antibodies and human serum
The human monocyte-like cell line THP-1 (ATCC®
Number: TIB-202™) was grown in suspension in RPMI
containing fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. Cell viability was measured by Trypan Blue exclusion test. F. tularensis Live Vaccine Strain, LVS, was kindly
supplied by A. Sjöstedt [18] and grown either in Schaedler
broth containing vitamin K3 or on chocolate agar plates
containing polyvitex (Biomerieux) at 37°C. LVS-GFP was
obtained by transformation of LVS bacteria with pFNLTP6
gro-gfp, provided by Dr. Zahrt [19]. Antibodies (Abs) used
were: polyclonal mouse anti-EF-Tu prepared in our laboratory, as described below; rabbit anti-IglA, kindly provided by Dr. Nano [20], anti-LVS (Becton Dickinson),
anti-nucleolin (Abcam), anti-GST (Oncogene); monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were anti-nucleolin (clone D3)
[21], anti-glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as an isotypematched negative control for cell surface nucleolin and
anti-CD11/CD18 (anti-CR3 receptors) (Abcam), which
specifically recognizes the human CD11/18 activation
epitope. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit
(GAR) or goat anti-mouse (GAM) conjugated to HRP
(Dako) for immunoblotting experiments or with Alexa
Fluor cytochromes for microscopy experiments. Human
serum AB (PAA) was handled in a manner to preserve
complement activity [22]. Heat-inactivated (H.I.) serum
was obtained by incubating serum for 30 min at 56°C.
Peptide constructs
The synthesis of the 5 [Lys (CH2N)Pro-Arg]-templateassembled synthetic peptide referred to as HB-19 and the
nine-D-arginine peptide construct, referred to as 9Arg,
synthesized using Fmoc-protected D-Arg residue was as
described previously [11,23]. The p63 peptide was synthesized according to the last 63 amino acid residues of

human nucleolin (KGEGGFGGRGGGRGGFGGRGGGRG
GRGGFGGRGRGGFGGRGGFRGGRGGGGDHKPQGKKT
KFE) [24]. The synthetic F3 peptide is a tumor-homing
peptide corresponding to the 34 amino acid fragment
(AKVKDEPQRRSARLSAKPAPPKPEPKPKKAPAKK) of a
high mobility group protein, HMG2N [25]. For the
biotin-labeled p63 peptide, the biotin moiety was introduced during peptide assembly as an Fmoc Lys-biotin
derivative at the N-terminus of the peptide. All peptides
were obtained at a high purity (95%), and their integrity
was controlled by matrix-associated laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight analysis [11].
Preparation of subcellular fractions of LVS
After 24 h of culture in broth, LVS bacteria were collected
by centrifugation and either directly lysed in BPER buffer
(Novagen) or suspended in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0. Suspended bacteria were then disintegrated in a Fast-Prep
FP120 Cell Disrupter (ThermoSavant) with Fast-Prep
beads using 4 repeated cycles of 30 sec at a 6.5 speed. After
10 min on ice, undisrupted microbes were eliminated by
centrifugation for 5 min at 2,800 × g. Supernatant was
then centrifuged for 60 min at 105,000 × g in a Beckmann
Optima Max ultracentrifuge, at 4°C. The pellet, which
contained the bacterial membranes, was washed twice in
TNE (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) by
centrifugation and then solubilized for 45 min at 4°C in
TNE containing 1% NP40 and 1% Triton X100. A further
centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C separated
the soluble membrane proteins present in the supernatant
from membrane-associated proteins present in the pellet.
Protein concentration of different fractions was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce).
Preparation of EF-Tu recombinant proteins and
generation of murine polyclonal antibodies
LVS chromosomal DNA was purified with Turbogen kit
(Invitrogen). PCR reactions were performed in Bio-Rad I
Thermal Cycler with 100 pmoles/μl of 5' primer 5'CCGGAATTCATGGCTAAAGAAAAATTTGAGCGTTC-3'
(nt 3141 to 3156) and 3' primer 5'CGAGTCGACTTACTCGATAATTTTAGCTACAACACCAGCACC-3' (nt 3246 to
3261). The EF-Tu amplicon of 1.1 kbp was purified on
agarose gel, cloned in pCR2-TOPO1 vector (Invitrogen)
and sequenced in Institut Cochin (Genomic Sequencing
Department). Once its sequence confirmed, EF-Tu was
subcloned in pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) or
pET28a+ (Novagen) into EcoRI-SalI sites, in DH5α. After
transforming in E. coli strain BL21or BL21DE3, respectively, GST-fusion proteins and His-fusion proteins were
produced as previously described [26] and purified either
on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) or on Ni-column (Novagen), as described by
manufacturers. His-fusion EF-Tu protein was used as
immunogen for immunizing Balb/c mice. Non-immune

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/145

serum (NIS) was obtained from mice injected only with
Freund adjuvant.
Pull-down assays
Pull-down assays were performed either with GST recombinant proteins or with biotin-avidin beads. For GST
recombinant proteins, 5 μg of GST or GST-EF-Tu bound
on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 500
μg human membrane proteins, obtained as previously
described [14] by solubilizing THP-1 cell membranes
with 1% NP40 in TNE, containing protease inhibitors
(Roche Diagnostics). Biotin-avidin beads were used to
characterize bacteria proteins bound on RGG p63 carboxy-terminal domain of nucleolin. For that purpose, 500
μg of LVS membrane proteins were incubated for 2 h at
8°C with different concentrations of the biotinylated p63
peptide. The complex formed between bacteria membrane proteins and biotinylated p63 peptide was isolated
by purification using 100 μl avidin-agarose (ImmunoPure
Immobilized Avidin, Pierce), after incubation for 2 h at
8°C. Specificity of the binding with the p63 domain was
determined by preincubation of 500 μg of bacteria membrane proteins with unlabeled p63 peptide for 2 h at 8°C,
before further incubation with the biotinylated p63 peptide for 2 h at 8°C. After extensive washes of the different
samples, purified proteins were denatured by heating at
95°C for 10 min in sample buffer containing SDS and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting assays.
Immunoblotting assays
Recombinant proteins, proteins from human cells or
present in the different subcellular fractions of LVS, and
proteins recovered from pull-down assays were submitted
to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were electrotransferred
on nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell),
using a semi-dry Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
containing 5% powdered milk and then with the indicated Abs. After washing in PBS/0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T),
HRP-linked secondary Abs were added. Nitrocellulose
sheets were washed and binding of second Abs was
detected using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham).
Infection of human cells
Thirty minutes before infection, LVS bacteria were suspended at 37°C in RPMI containing 10% human serum
AB, except when otherwise indicated. Human monocytelike THP-1 cells were washed in RPMI, suspended in RPMI
containing 5% FCS (RPMI-FCS) and infected with LVS for
30 min at 37°C, without centrifugation to promote bacteria-cell interaction [27] at a Multiplicity of Infection
(MOI) of 100:1 (bacteria/cell). Cells were then washed
with RPMI containing 10 μg/ml gentamicin to remove
extracellular bacteria, then suspended at 0.7 × 106 per ml
in RPMI-FCS with gentamicin. This point was referred to

as time zero (T = 0). Cells were further incubated statically
for indicated times at 37°C. At indicated times, 100 μl
THP-1 cells were lysed for 15 min in distilled water. Then,
serial dilutions were performed in 0.15 M NaCl and the
number of intracellular bacteria present in cells was determined by plating 100 μl on chocolate agar plates. When
indicated, THP-1 cells were pretreated before infection for
2 h at 37°C with anti-CR3 Mab, the different peptides
described above or with cytochalasin D (Sigma), an actin
polymerization inhibitor. In some experiments, THP-1
cells were also pre-incubated with recombinant His-EF-Tu
protein. This recombinant protein was tested for its toxicity on human cells, which was found to be negative (data
not shown). Adherent THP-1 cells or blood MDM plated
at 2 × 105 per ml were infected as described above for THP1 cells in suspension, except that number of intracellular
bacteria was quantified after adding 1 ml H2O to each well
before plating serial dilutions.
Fluorescence and Confocal experiments
Binding of bacteria on human cells was analyzed by either
fluorescence or confocal microscopy, at the Cell Imaging
Facility (Faculté de Médecine Necker Enfants-Malades).
For fluorescence microscopy, THP-1 cells were incubated
either with RPMI, the different peptides or recombinant
His-EF-Tu for 2 h at 37°C. They were then infected for 30
min at 37°C with LVS-GFP (MOI of 100:1), which had
been pre-incubated either with RPMI, NIS or anti-EF-Tu
for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed in RPMI without gentamicin and fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde
(PFA), as described below. Cells were visualized with a
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2) using Qimaging Digital Camera with Q Capture Pro Fluorescence analysis software. For experiments by confocal microscopy,
THP-1 cells infected or not with LVS, for 30 min at 37°C,
were washed in PBS/Ca2+Mg2+ (Gibco) and suspended at
3 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at
room temperature (RT) with 5% goat serum in PBS, to
block non-specific binding sites, then for 45 min at RT
with first Abs, at indicated dilutions. After washing, cells
were incubated for 45 min at RT with second Abs diluted
1/100 (Alexa Fluor 488-labeled GAM and/or Alexa Fluor
546-labeled GAR) in the dark. After washing, cells were
fixed with PFA for 15 min at RT and incubated for 10 min
at RT with 50 mM NH4Cl to quench residual aldehydes.
After centrifugation, the cell pellet was suspended in
Mowiol and mounted on glass coverslips. Cells were visualized at the appropriate wavelengths under a Zeiss LSM 5
Pascal confocal microscope with argon (458/488 nm) and
helium neon (543 nm) lasers with LSM analysis software.
We present the photographs of cells with typical morphology and staining. For quantification by confocal microscopy, THP-1 cells were infected as described above except
they were infected with LVS-GFP and then incubated with
anti-nucleolin MAb, diluted 1/1000, followed by Alexa

Fluor 568-labeled GAM. After fixation of cells with PFA
for 15 min at RT and incubation with 50 mM NH4Cl,
DAPI was added for 5 min in PBS containing 5% gelatin,
before washing with PBS. Cell pellet, mounted on glass
coverslip in Mowiol, was visualized with a Leica TCS SP5
confocal microscope with diode (405 nm), argon (458/
488 nm), DPSS (561 nm) and helium neon (633 nm)
lasers and LASAF program. Co-localization of LVS-GFP
with nucleolin was measured on more than 500 cells
using the "Co-localization" module of Imaris 5.0.2. software, which analyzes stacks of confocal sections, as previously described [28].
For direct labeling of LVS bacteria with different antibodies, a pellet of 2 × 109 LVS was processed as described
above for labeling of human cells.
Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM)
LVS bacteria grown on plates were harvested, suspended
in PBS and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 sec to form
loose pellets. Supernatant was removed and 2% PFA-0.1%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Millonig's phosphate buffer
(MPB) was added to each pellet for 2 h. After rinsing three
times with MPB, the pellets were then processed for negative-contrast IEM (nc-IEM) as previously described [29],
except binding of the first antibodies diluted 1/200 was
detected with a 1/30 dilution of protein A labeled with 10nm gold spheres (Aurion, The Netherlands). The specimens were examined at 80 kV with a JEM-100CXII electron microscope (JEOL).
FACS analysis
THP-1 cells uninfected or infected by LVS, as described
above, were incubated with different antibodies for 45
min at RT. After washing, THP-1 cells were incubated with
Alexa Fluor 488-labeled second antibodies in dark place,
for 45 min at RT. After washing, THP-1 cells were fixed
with PFA and incubated in NH4Cl. Cells were then centrifuged and processed for analysis by FACS scan flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For each sample, 10,000
viable cells were gated following size (forward scatter,
FSC) and granularity side scatter (SSC) and analyzed with
Cell Quest™ Software (Becton Dickinson).
Preparation of C3bi-coated erythrocytes (EC3bi) and their
binding on THP-1 cells
Sheep erythocytes coated with IgM (EA) were kindly provided, by Dr. V. Fremeaux-Bacchi (Hopital Européen
Georges Pompidou, Paris). EC3bi were prepared by incubating EA in 10% C5-deficient serum (Sigma) for 60 min
at 37°C, as previously described [30]. EC3bi were incubated with THP-1 cells for 60 min at RT and percentage of
cells forming rosettes was determined by counting
100–200 cells in a microscope hemacytometer chamber.
Prior to incubation with EC3bi, THP-1 cells were incu-

bated either with RPMI, 10 μM HB-19 or 9R peptides or
20 μg anti-CR3 Mab for 2 h at 37°C. A rosette was defined
as a cell with two or more adherent sheep erythrocytes.

Results
Nucleolin expressed on monocyte-like THP-1 cells cell
surface is down-regulated by LVS infection
We first verified the presence of nucleolin at the surface of
THP-1 cells by fluorescence microscopy analysis using
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for
human nucleolin [12,21] (Fig 1A). When cells were first
incubated with specific and secondary antibodies before
treatment with PFA, both polyclonal (Fig 1A1) and monoclonal (Fig 1A2) anti-nucleolin Abs labeled THP-1 cell
surface, as previously described [12]. When cells were first

Statistical analyses

between the various experimental and control groups. A p
value of < 0.01 was considered to be statistically significant.

different experiments.

treated by PFA and then incubated with the different antibodies, only staining of cytoplasm was observed, most
likely due to permeabilization of the cell membrane and
entry of the antibody into the cytosol (Fig 1A3). Therefore, all subsequent fluorescent experiments were performed, by incubating cells with antibodies before
treatment with PFA. We also monitored the changes in
cell surface nucleolin expression upon LVS infection by
FACS analysis (Fig 1B). Fluorescence intensity of cell surface expressed nucleolin decreased from 5 × 102 ± 1 × 102
A.U. (arbitrary units) in uninfected cells (Fig 1B1) to 5 ×
101 ± 0.5 × 101 A.U., when cells were infected by LVS (Fig
1B2).
Nucleolin mediates binding of LVS and infection of human
monocyte-like THP-1 cells
We evaluated the role of nucleolin in LVS binding and
infection of human monocyte-like THP-1 cells, by testing
the effect of the pseudopeptide HB-19. This pseudopeptide specifically and irreversibly binds cell-surface
expressed nucleolin through its RGG domain located on
the C-terminal tail [11,24]. We used THP-1 cells in suspension, i.e. in their monocyte-like state, in presence of
human serum AB, as opsonization of LVS by human complement has been shown to enhance its ability to infect
human cells [5].

Effect of HB-19 on LVS binding on THP-1 cells was followed using fluorescent microscopy. We counted the
number of LVS bacteria expressing GFP (LVS-GFP) bound
per 100 human THP-1 cells in fifteen different fields (Fig
2A). The mean number of bacteria bound per cell was
almost one bacterium per cell, a value consistent with previous reports on monocytes or macrophage-derived
monocytes (MDM) [5,6]. Pre-incubation of THP-1 cells
with HB-19 resulted in a 63% decrease in the number of
bound LVS-GFP bacteria. We used as a negative control,
the protease-resistant basic 9Arg peptide (9R) that does
not interact with nucleolin. As expected, this peptide did
not significantly affect the number of bacteria bound on
THP-1 cells.
We then analyzed effect of HB-19 treatment on infection
by LVS. At 4 h, the 4 ± 0.5 × 104 CFU/ml obtained in presence of RPMI were decreased to 1.5 ± 0.2 × 104 CFU/ml in
presence of 5 μM HB-19. Maximum of intracellular bacterial multiplication (7 × 106 CFU/ml) was reached at 22 h
(Fig 2B), corresponding to average of 11 intracellular bacteria per cell. When THP-1 cells were pre-incubated with 5
μM HB-19, a 63% decrease in LVS infection was observed
at 22 h. The strongest inhibitory effect of infection at 22 h
was observed with a concentration of 10 μM HB-19 (evaluated over a range of concentration from 1 to 10 μM HB19, data not shown). Therefore, all following experiments
were performed with 10 μM HB-19, with number of intra-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/145

cellular bacteria at 22 h decreased by 78%, (i.e. yielding to
average number of 2 bacteria per cell) (Fig 2C). 9R peptide
had no significant effect on LVS infection of THP-1 cells.
As HB-19 pseudopeptide forms an irreversible complex
with surface nucleolin by binding to RGG carboxy-terminal domain [24], we also evaluated effect of F3 peptide
that binds acidic domains localized at N-terminal part of
nucleolin [25]. F3 had no effect on bacterial infection
(Fig. 2C).
Involvement of CR3 receptors in uptake of LVS though
complement component has been largely described
[6,31] and prompted us to monitor the possible combined effect of HB-19 and anti-CR3 MAb on the level of
bacterial infection of THP-1 cells (Fig 2C). Anti-CR3 alone
induced 70% decrease in infection, in agreement with previous observations [7]. Strikingly, incubation of THP-1
cells with both HB-19 and anti-CR3 MAb led to 95%
decrease in the level of infection (lowering the number of
intracellular bacteria in THP-1 cells from 3 to less than 0.6
bacteria per cell).
We tested whether HB-19 could affect CR3 expression by
flow cytometry and E-C3bi rosette formation (Fig 3).
FACS analysis with anti-CR3 MAb gave a mean intensity
for THP-1 cells preincubated with 10 μM HB-19 (Fig 3A1)
or 10 μM 9R (Fig 3A2) of 27.37 and 24.54, respectively (as
compared to 6.43 with anti-GAPDH). Rosette formation
between E-C3bi and THP-1 cells (Fig 3B) was enumerated
by phase-contrast microscopy. When THP-1 cells were
preincubated with 10 μM HB-19 or 10 μM 9R, 48% and
51% ± 5% cells, respectively, were found with attached EC3bi, as compared to 50% ± 6% cells with RPMI. When
cells were preincubated with 20 μg anti-CR3, only 25% ±
3% cells formed rosettes with E-C3bi. These results suggested that HB-19 does not affect CR3 activity.
Preliminary experiments were also performed either with
adherent THP-1 cells, obtained after treatment for 48 h
with 200 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate or with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as described [5] A similar
inhibitory effect at 10 μM HB-19 of 70% and 65% was
recorded for adherent THP-1 cells and MDM, respectively
(data not shown).
Altogether, these results showed that nucleolin is involved
in LVS interaction with human monocyte-like THP-1 cells
and that LVS binding to nucleolin appears to be mediated
through its C-terminal domain, as HB-19 binds RGG
domain. The additive inhibitory effect of HB-19 on antiCR3 further suggested that nucleolin interaction with LVS
might be complementary to CR3 – C3 interaction.

Identification of the bacterial ligands for nucleolin
Translation factor EF-Tu has been identified by analysis of
the anti-F. tularensis immunoproteome as one of the
major LVS antigenic protein in murine infection [32], and
as an immunoreactive antigen present in membrane proteins enriched fraction of LVS in human infection [33].

We made the assumption that LVS EF-Tu, possibly present
on LVS cell surface, could be a ligand for nucleolin and
bind to its C-terminal domain. To test this hypothesis, we
first prepared a specific anti-EF-Tu antibody. Sequence of
LVS gene encoding EF-Tu (FTL_1751) was obtained by in
silico analysis of LVS genome [34]. LVS EF-Tu presents

99.7% amino acid identity with EF-Tu from type A strain,
F. tularensis Schu S4 (FTT_0137). Purified recombinant
EF-Tu, tagged either with polyhistidine tag (His-EF-Tu) or
with glutathione S-transferase protein (GST-EF-Tu), were
prepared in E. coli. Both recombinant proteins had
expected apparent molecular mass (MW) on SDS-PAGE
i.e. 43 kDa for His-EF-Tu and 70 kDa for GST-EF-Tu (data
not shown). We prepared polyclonal anti-EF-Tu antibody
by immunizing mice with His-EF-Tu recombinant protein. The specificity of anti-EF-Tu Ab was demonstrated, as
only one protein, characterized by an apparent Mr of 43
kDa, was recognized by anti-EF-Tu Ab, among all proteins
present in a whole bacteria cell lysate (Fig 4A1). After cell

analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-EF-Tu Ab diluted 1/100,000. In control, 50 μg LVS membrane proteins were run directly.

fractionation of LVS, EF-Tu was found expectedly in the
bacterial cytoplasmic fraction [17], but also in the membrane fraction. In contrast, the cytosolic protein IglA was
exclusively localized in the cytoplasmic fraction [20] (Fig
4A2).

(data not shown). These results demonstrated that "in
vitro" a) recombinant EF-Tu interacts with nucleolin
present in THP-1 cell membranes; b) RGG p63 carboxyterminal domain of nucleolin interacts with EF-Tu either
recombinant or present in membranes of LVS.

We then assessed whether EF-Tu present in LVS membrane fractions bound to p63 RGG carboxy-terminal
domain of nucleolin, by a pull-down assay. Solubilized
LVS membrane proteins were incubated with increasing
amounts of biotinylated p63 peptide. The bacterial protein(s)-biotinylated p63 peptide complexes, recovered
after passage through avidin-sepharose columns were
probed with anti-EF-Tu antibody (Fig 4B). The 43 kDa EFTu was detected in LVS membranes by anti-EF-Tu Ab.
Increasing amounts of EF-Tu were recovered with increasing concentrations of biotinylated p63, with maximum
recovery obtained at 10 μM peptide concentration. An
additional product of 32 kDa compatible with a proteolytic degradation product of the protein was also recovered from bound proteins. Similar truncated fragment has
been described for EF-Tu of other species [35]. Specificity
of EF-Tu binding to 5 μM biotinylated p63 was confirmed
by inhibition of this interaction by 10-molar excess of
unlabeled p63 (Fig 4C).

EF-Tu is localized on bacterial surface
We then tested the surface exposition of EF-Tu, which was
detected in LVS membrane fractions, by fluorescence and
electron microscopy (Fig 6). Immunofluorescence analysis (Fig 6A) of intact LVS bacteria gave positive labeling
with anti-EF-Tu Ab, as with anti-LVS Ab. No signal was
obtained with rabbit anti-nucleolin (see Additional file 1)
and either NIS (rabbit or mouse) or anti-nucleolin Mab
(data not shown). Immunoelectron microscopy of LVS
(Fig 6B) showed positive immunogold staining of surface
of intact LVS both with anti-EF-Tu Ab and with control
anti-LVS Ab. No staining was found with control NIS.
These data strongly suggested that a fraction of EF-Tu is
exposed at surface of LVS and may therefore interact with
cell-surface associated nucleolin.

Interaction of recombinant EF-Tu with C-terminal RGG
domain of nucleolin is specific
Specificity of EF-Tu interaction with nucleolin was further
confirmed by two reciprocal pull-down assays (Fig 5). The
first pull-down assay evaluated capacity of recombinant
His-EF-Tu to bind to p63 peptide. Recombinant EF-Tu
bound in dose-dependent manner to biotin-labeled p63
peptide (Fig 5A) with maximum binding occurring at 8
μM. Specificity of this binding was demonstrated by its
inhibition with a 10 to 20-molar excess of unlabeled p63
peptide (Fig 5B). Effect of HB-19 pseudopeptide and F3 or
9R peptides was also tested on EF-Tu interaction with
RGG domain. A 10 to 20-molar excess HB-19 markedly
inhibited binding of biotin-labeled p63 peptide to EF-Tu,
while a 20-molar excess of F3 or 9R peptides that do not
interact with nucleolin had no effect (Fig 5B).

The second pull-down assay showed that nucleolin,
present in solubilized proteins from THP-1 cell membranes, interacted with recombinant EF-Tu (Fig 5C).
Human solubilized membrane proteins were incubated
with glutathione-sepharose bound GST-EF-Tu or GST as
control. A protein doublet at 95 kDa, corresponding to
human nucleolin, was detected by anti-nucleolin MAb
only in GST-EF-Tu sample (lane 3). Nucleolin was not
detected with GST (lane 2). Lane 1 shows the amount of
nucleolin detected in 50 μg total membrane proteins.
Blotting with polyclonal anti-GST demonstrated that
same amounts of GST or GST-EF-Tu were loaded in the gel

Co-localization of cell-surface expressed nucleolin with
EF-Tu of F. tularensis
Localization of EF-Tu at LVS surface and of nucleolin on
human cell surface prompted us to investigate by confocal
microscopy, whether they could co-localize on THP-1 cell
surface (Fig 7). For that purpose, THP-1 cells were first
incubated with LVS for 30 min at 37°C, before further
incubation with polyclonal anti-nucleolin Ab. Under
these conditions, anti-nucleolin Ab labels cell surface and
not intracellular nucleolin (see Fig 1A). This polyclonal
anti-nucleolin Ab was shown not to cross-react with LVS
(see Additional file 1). Binding of opsonized bacteria was
monitored with murine anti-EF-Tu Ab, which specifically
recognized the 43 kDa EF-Tu protein (see Fig 3). Labeling
of infected cells with anti-nucleolin Ab gave a lower signal, than when cells are not infected, as already shown by
FACS analysis (see Fig 1). Merging of nucleolin with LVS
EF-Tu was observed only when EF-Tu present on LVS bacteria met clustered patches of nucleolin (see red arrows).
No merging of LVS was observed when nucleolin was not
present (see white arrows). To quantify the number of
LVS particles co-localizing with nucleolin, we used LVSGFP particles (see Methods). Merging of LVS-GFP with
nucleolin was observed in these conditions (see Additional file 2) and quantified with Imaris program. Regions
of interest (ROI) indicated a percentage of 21% ± 5% LVSGFP particles co-localizing with nucleolin on more than
500 observed cells.

pre-incubated either with RPMI, NIS or anti-EF-Tu Ab. A
maximum binding of 95 LVS-GFP bacteria per 100

also decreased the number of bacteria bound on cells.

Elongation factor Tu of LVS participates in binding to human monocyte-like THP-1 cells and in their infection.
A: THP-1 cells were infected for 30 min by opsonized LVS-GFP that had been pre-incubated either with RPMI, NIS or anti-EFTu Ab (diluted 1/2,000). THP-1 cells were also pre-incubated with 50 μg His-EF-Tu and then infected for 30 min by opsonized
LVS-GFP pre-incubated with NIS. Fluorescence microscopy was analyzed at 63× magnification. Fifteen fields containing average
of 100 cells were examined to quantify number of bound bacteria. Results shown are means ± SD from three independent
experiments. *, p < 0.01 for group of bacteria treated with anti-EF-Tu Ab compared to group incubated with RPMI. B: Intracellular replication of LVS. THP-1 cells were infected for 30 min with opsonized LVS that were first incubated either with RPMI
( ), mouse NIS (᭜) or anti-EF-Tu Ab ( ), both diluted 1/2,000. Cells were then washed with RPMI containing gentamicin and
further incubated in RPMI-FCS and gentamicin for indicated times. Quantification of intracellular bacteria was performed as
described in Methods. Results shown are means from five independent experiments, each in triplicate ± SD indicated by error
bars. C: LVS were incubated either with Human serum, H.I. serum or with No Human serum. LVS in these different
conditions were further incubated either with RPMI, mouse NIS or anti-EF-Tu Ab, both diluted 1/2,000. THP-1 cells were then
infected by the different LVS preparations. THP-1 cells, pre-incubated with anti-CR3 MAb were infected with opsonized LVS
that had been pretreated or not by anti-EF-Tu Ab. THP-1 cells were also preincubated with 50 μg His-EF-Tu before infection
by opsonized LVS. Cells were washed in RPMI with gentamicin and incubated in RPMI-FCS and gentamicin for 22 h. Quantification of intracellular bacteria was performed as described in Methods. N.E. (not examined): anti-CR3 MAb, anti-CR3 MAb
and anti-EF-Tu Ab and His-EF-Tu samples were not tested in H.I serum and No human serum conditions. Results shown
are means from five independent experiments, each in triplicate ± SD indicated by error bars.

intracellular bacterial multiplication (6.5 × 106 CFU/ml)
was reached between 22 to 30 h after infection. A maximum decrease (60%) in bacterial number was observed at
22 h when bacteria were pre-incubated with anti-EF-Tu
Ab. This corresponded to a decrease from 11 to 4 intracellular bacteria per cell. All these experiments were performed in presence of normal human serum. We therefore
analyzed at 22 h whether anti-EF-Tu Ab had a similar
inhibitory effect on level of infection when LVS was incubated in presence of heat-inactivated (H.I) serum or in
absence of serum (Fig 8C). A lower infection of THP-1
cells by LVS was observed, in presence of H.I. serum and
in absence of serum (3 and 1.5 intracellular bacteria,
respectively), consistent with earlier observations [6,31].
However, even in these conditions, LVS preincubation
with anti-EF-Tu Ab resulted in 60% inhibition of infection. Moreover, when human cells were pre-incubated
with anti-CR3 MAb and infected by opsonized bacteria
that had been pretreated with anti-EF-Tu Ab, maximal
decrease of 94% in infection was observed (corresponding
to less than 1 bacterium per cell).
All these results indicated that, in addition to C3, EF-Tu
was important for LVS infection of THP-1 cells through
nucleolin. Specific involvement of EF-Tu in LVS infection
was also supported, by the 67% decrease in infection
observed using 50 μg recombinant EF-Tu. Altogether, our
results show that: i) EF-Tu is involved in LVS binding to –
and infection of – human THP-1 monocyte-like cells; ii)
in spite of requirement for CR3-C3 interaction for LVS
infection, nucleolin – EF-Tu interaction is distinct and
should be important to consider.

Discussion
The receptor-ligand pathways involved in entry of F. tularensis into human monocytes are still not clearly understood. Here, for the first time, we have characterized
protein partners of a bacteria-host cell interaction, which
permits entry of LVS into human monocyte-like THP-1
cells and their subsequent infection. We showed that
elongation factor EF-Tu expressed at bacterial surface
interacts with nucleolin, expressed on surface of human
monocyte-like THP-1 cells. Blockade of this interaction,
either with nucleolin-binding pseudopeptide HB-19 or
with anti-EF-Tu Ab, results in inhibition of LVS bacteria
binding to human THP-1 cells and subsequent inhibition
of bacterial infection.
Presence of nucleolin at surface of THP-1 monocyte-like
cells was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and
FACS analysis. The fact that nucleolin expression was
decreased following LVS infection suggests that nucleolin
plays a role in LVS adhesion and does affect entry process
and infection. Nucleolin has three main structural
domains [9]: 1) N-terminal domain, containing several
long stretches of acidic residues; 2) central globular
domain, containing four RNA binding domains (RBDs);
and 3) C-terminal domain containing nine repeats of
tripeptide motif arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG domain =
63 amino acid residues). We demonstrated the important
role of nucleolin in LVS infection by using nucleolin-specific peptides. HB-19 pseudopeptide, which specifically
binds the RGG C-terminal domain of nucleolin, inhibited
both binding and infection of human monocyte-like
THP-1 cells infection by LVS. The basic 9R peptide, which
does not bind to nucleolin [11,23] or the F3 tumor-homing peptide, which binds on N-terminal domain of nucle-

olin [25], had no effect on LVS infection. These results
confirmed the specific role of nucleolin in LVS infection
and demonstrated that nucleolin interacts with LVS
through its carboxy-terminal RGG domain.
We used THP-1 cells in suspension for our experiments.
The limited amount of ca. 90 bacteria bound per 100
THP-1 monocyte-like cells we observed was very similar
to that previously found with macrophages and MDM
(67–75 Ft/100 cells) [8]. Nevertheless, phagocytic activity
of non-adherent THP-1 cells showed to be sufficient to
internalize bacteria and promote active intracellular multiplication, since an average of ten bacteria per infected
cell was found at 22 h after infection. In preliminary
experiments performed either with adherent THP-1 cells,
or with MDM, a similar inhibitory effect of HB-19 was
recorded with these cells. In view of this result, further
investigations are required to evaluate the implication of
nucleolin in LVS infection of phagocytic cells other than
THP-1 cells.
RGG domain of nucleolin constitutes the binding site for
various ligands such as subset of ribosomal proteins
[12,36,37], midkine, pleiotrophin, lactoferrin, and even
HIV particles [23,37-40]. P63 synthetic peptide, which
corresponds to RGG domain of nucleolin, allowed us to
characterize the bacterial partner of nucleolin, elongation
factor Tu. The C-terminal RGG domain bound both intact
bacteria and recombinant EF-Tu. Direct interaction of
nucleolin with EF-Tu was also demonstrated by co-localization on human cell surface of both proteins and by a
pull-down assay where solubilized nucleolin interacted
with recombinant GST-EF-Tu.
Human nucleolin therefore serves as surface receptor for
EF-Tu presented by LVS and this interaction plays a major
role in binding of LVS and its subsequent infection of
human monocyte-like THP-1 cells. Nucleolin-specific HB19 pseudopeptide, anti-EF-Tu Ab and recombinant EF-Tu
inhibited both binding and infection of human monocyte-like THP-1 cellss. Coating bacteria with anti-EF-Tu Ab
did not confer subsequent phagocytosis by Fc receptors as
a lower number of CFU was obtained. We always used the
same batch of fresh human serum in all experiments to
avoid differential effect due to donor-dependent FcγR
involvement on opsono-phagocytosis. Indeed, presence
of a low concentration of antibodies to Francisella in nonimmune human serum, which will create ligands for Fc
receptors, has been previously described [6].
Fate of surface nucleolin after its interaction with LVS,
observed by FACS analysis and its subsequent internalization, remain to be investigated, inasmuch as in all microscopy and flow cytometry experiments, primary Abs were
added to living cells at room temperature where pinocyto-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/145

sis still occurs. It has been already suggested that internalization of nucleolin-binding ligands occur via lipid rafts
[23,24,37,39]. While surface nucleolin is readily solubilized by treatment of cells with non-ionic detergent, it
becomes detergent-resistant after ligand binding to cells
and is recovered along detergent insoluble membrane
microdomains containing lipid raft. Internalization of
LVS through nucleolin was blocked by cytochalasin D
(data not shown). This result is consistent with previous
data, which showed that infection by LVS of human
monocyte-like THP-1 cells was completely blocked by
cytochalasin D [5,13].
A fraction of EF-Tu was localized at the LVS surface. This
is the first protein of F. tularensis to be characterized as a
specific ligand involved in bacterial entry into human
monocyte-like THP-1 cells. Interestingly, recent studies
have unraveled an unexpected key role for EF-Tu in microbial pathogenesis, e.g. i) EF-Tu, located at cell surface of
Lactobacillus johsonii, mediates its attachment to human
intestinal cells and mucins [41]; ii) EF-Tu is one of the six
most abundant mycobacterial proteins, whose expression
increases after phagocytosis by macrophages [42]; iii) EFTu of Listeria monocytogenes is target for a serine-threonine
phosphatase, which is involved in virulence of this pathogen [35]; iv) EF-Tu is present in purified Anaplasma marginale outer membranes that induce complete protection
against infection [43]. A very recent report [44] also demonstrates that bacterial surface Tuf of P. aeruginosa acts as
virulence factor and binds human complement factor H
and plasminogen.
EF-Tu belongs to the growing list of cytoplasmic proteins
identified on bacterial surface. At present, the mechanisms of their surface localization and attachment to the
bacterial envelope remain unclear. Indeed, these proteins
(including EF-Tu, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase and ribosomal proteins) do
not contain signal peptides that could direct them into
classical secretory pathways and do not possess any obvious envelope-associating motifs. Localization of EF-Tu at
the bacterial surface may be explained by its three-dimensional structure. Indeed, EF-Tu protein consists of three
domains: an alpha/beta domain (residues 1 to 200),
which contains the binding site of the GDP cofactor and
two all-beta domains (residues 209 to 299 and 300 to
393), which belong to the tertiary structural class of
antiparallel beta-barrels [45]. At this stage, it is tempting
to imagine a model somewhat similar to that described in
gram-negative bacteria for the autotransporter pathway
[46], where the C-terminal part of the precursor forms a
porin-like structure within the outer membrane. The Nterminally attached passenger domain is ultimately translocated to the cell surface through this pore. However, in
the autotransporter pathway, an N-terminal signal pep-

tide drives the transport of the precursor protein across the
inner membrane. Various "environmental" signals might
trigger translocation of a subpopulation of cytoplasmic
proteins to bacterial membrane surface. Alternatively,
conformational changes might allow membrane localization of otherwise cytoplasmic proteins, and provide them
alternative or "moonlighting" functions in this compartment.
Therefore, our results support a "moonlighting function"
for bacterial EF-Tu, already described for its eukaryotic
analog, the EF1 elongation factor. Indeed, eukaryotic
elongation factors have been shown to be concerned in
various important cellular processes or serious diseases,
including translational control, signal transduction,
cytoskeletal organization, apoptosis, adult atopic dermatitis, oncogenic transformation, nutrition, and nuclear
processes such as RNA synthesis and mitosis [47,48].
EF-Tu also interacted with nucleolin in presence of inactivated C3 and even in absence of C3. While HB-19 presented an additive inhibitory effect on anti-CR3, it did not
interfere with CR3 expression and/or its activity. This suggested a receptor pathway independent of CR3. Therefore,
by mediating infection by F. tularensis, EF-Tu – nucleolin
interaction may play a role in immuno-compromised
patients where C3 deficiencies are associated with higher
susceptibility to severe infections [49].
The quantitative importance of nucleolin as a receptor
pathway compared to the CR3/C3 pathway has to be
assessed by further experiments. Twenty-one percent ± 5%
opsonized LVS co-localized with nucleolin, as quantified
by confocal analysis while 78% bacteria had their binding
inhibited by HB-19. This difference may be explained by
the difference in sensitivity of the diverse methods and
conditions used. Indeed, a similar difference was observed
for CR3/C3 interaction. While infection by LVS of THP-1
cells preincubated with anti-CR3 was decreased by 70%,
50% of human THP-1 cells formed rosettes with E-C3bi,
with only 50% of these rosettes inhibited by anti-CR3 preincubation of the cells.

Conclusion
EF-Tu has been reported to act as stimulator of proinflammatory response in presence of soluble CD14 in Arabidopsis plants [50,51]. EF-Tu was described as acting as
pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) for innate
immune system of both animals and plants. After an initial high affinity binding to its receptor, EF-Tu from Arabidopsis induced elements of signal transmission, including
activation of MAPK. By similarity to these recent observations, it is tempting to suggest that interaction of EF-Tu
with human nucleolin might be involved in innate
immune response to F. tularensis, by triggering transduc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/145

tion signals. Indeed, previous reports on macrophage
responses to LVS infection included production of inflammatory cytokines and activation of NF-κB activation
[52,53]. Since phagosomal escape and intra-cytosolic
multiplication of LVS in infected monocytes are very similar to those of human pathogenic F. tularensis ssp tularensis [3,4], the mechanism of entry into monocyte-like cells,
involving interaction between EF-Tu and nucleolin, might
be similar in the two subspecies. Thus, use of either nucleolin-specific pseudopeptide HB-19 or recombinant EF-Tu,
could provide attractive therapeutic approaches for modulating F. tularensis infection.
