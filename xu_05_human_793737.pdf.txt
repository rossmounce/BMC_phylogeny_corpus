Abstract
Background: Episomal 2-long terminal repeat (LTR) HIV-1 cDNA, a by-product of HIV-1
infection, is used in clinical trials as a marker for ongoing viral replication. It would be useful to
employ 2-LTR cDNA to monitor cryptic HIV-1 infection in the genital tract of men on
antiretroviral therapy (ART) to predict the evolution of sexually transmissible drug-resistant HIV1, but studies thus far have failed to detect this marker in semen. The objectives of this study were:
1) to use a technique that maximizes DNA recovery from HIV-1 infected white blood cells in
semen to determine if episomal 2-LTR cDNA is detectable in semen of ART-naïve men with other
evidence of genital tract HIV-1 infection, and 2) to compare levels of HIV-1 2-LTR cDNA, RNA,
and proviral DNA in semen from HIV-1+ men on ART.
Results: Using a somatic cell DNA extraction technique, 2-LTR cDNA was detected by PCR/
ELISA in 4 out of 8 semen samples from ART-naïve men selected for other signs of seminal HIV-1
infection (positive controls). Southern blot and DNA sequencing confirmed that the amplified
sequences were HIV-1 2-LTR cDNA; copy numbers ranged from 55 to 504 copies/sample. Two
semen samples from a cohort of 22 HIV-1-infected men on dual nucleoside therapy, one with and
one without detectable seminal HIV-1 RNA, were 2-LTR cDNA positive (336 and 8,560 copies/
sample). Following addition of indinavir to the therapy regimen, no semen samples from 21 men
with controlled peripheral and seminal viral loads were 2-LTR cDNA positive at 1 and 6 month
time points, despite the persistence of HIV-1 proviral DNA+ semen cells and seminal
cytomegalovirus (CMV) shedding in some cases. However, one individual who failed indinavir
therapy and later developed distinct protease inhibitor (PI) drug resistance mutations in semen,
maintained elevated levels of HIV-1 RNA and 2-LTR cDNA in semen.
Conclusion: 2-LTR HIV-1 cDNA is detectable in semen of HIV-1-infected men. Two men on ART
had 2-LTR HIV-1 cDNA in semen, suggesting that this marker may prove to be useful to monitor
HIV-1 infection in the genital tract of men on ART to predict the evolution of drug resistance
mutations in semen.

Background
The global AIDS epidemic is primarily attributed to the
sexual transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus
type-1 (HIV-1), a retrovirus that infects CD4+ T cells and
macrophages and causes severe immunosuppression in
most untreated infected individuals. In HIV-1-infected
men, sexual transmission rates are high during acute
infection and late-stage disease when HIV-1 viral loads are
elevated in both semen and peripheral blood [1,2]. However, a number of studies have also described elevated
HIV-1 levels in semen from men with low or undetectable
HIV-1 concentrations in peripheral blood [3-5], and others have documented genotypic differences between seminal and peripheral blood HIV-1 [6-8]. These data indicate
that the male genital tract is a compartment, like the central nervous system, in which HIV-1 replication and divergent evolution can occur under the influence of local
factors. The male genital tract has several distinctive features that can affect local HIV-1 infection processes: 1) the
distal portion of the male genital tract, especially the
penile urethra, is capable of mounting a mucosal immune
response including production of secretory IgA [9] and
epithelial cell-derived mediators of innate immunity
which can suppress HIV-1 infection [10]; 2) co-infection
with other sexually transmitted pathogens can create
inflammatory conditions that lead to increased levels of
infectious HIV-1 in semen [11]; 3) the blood-testis barrier
and locally produced immunosuppressive factors may
protect HIV-1 from local immune responses in certain
regions of the male genital tract [12], and 4) some antiretroviral drugs may not adequately penetrate regions of the
male genital tract [13]. It is essential to better understand
HIV-1 infection and persistence in the male genital tract in
order to develop better intervention strategies to prevent
the sexual transmission of HIV-1.
A circular episomal HIV-1 DNA fragment, 2-long terminal
repeat (LTR) complementary DNA (cDNA), has been used
as a marker for HIV-1 infection in vivo. 2-LTR cDNA is a
by-product of HIV-1 infection, formed after reverse transcription of HIV-1 RNA and prior to integration of the
HIV-1 cDNA genome into host cell DNA [14]. Nonintegrated HIV-1 DNA has gained clinical importance because
its accumulation within infected cells is thought to indicate recent HIV-1 replication [14-16], and because its presence has been associated with cytopathic effects [17,18].
Although the stability and half-life of 2-LTR extrachromosomal HIV-1 DNA is a matter of some debate [19,20], a
recent clinical study, showing that patients on suboptimal
therapy acquire drug resistance mutations in episomal
viral cDNA while provirus remains unchanged, reaffirms
the clinical importance of this marker [21]. 2-LTR cDNA
has been detected in blood and tissues of individuals on
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and may be
an indication of cryptic HIV-1 replication [16]. This

http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/2/1/9

marker is used to monitor residual viral replication and
potential evolution of drug resistance mutations in viral
reservoir sites in individuals on HAART [22].
Whereas effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses
HIV-1 viral load in both blood and semen, HIV-1 proviral
DNA often persists in semen cells [23,24]. 2-LTR cDNA
could provide a useful marker for HIV-1 infection in the
male genital tract, including cryptic HIV-1 replication in
the genital tract in men on HAART. A recent study measured 2-LTR cDNA in blood and semen of men on HAART,
but failed to detect any positive semen samples [25], possibly due to a cell selection step that can reduce the sensitivity of HIV-1 DNA detection in semen. We have applied
an extraction approach that does not require cell separation and results in selective recovery of DNA from semen
somatic cells including all HIV-1 infected white blood
cells (WBC). The first goal of our study was to quantify 2LTR cDNA in semen from ART-naïve men with other signs
of HIV-1 infection in the genital tract (positive controls).
Our second goal was to assess levels of 2-LTR cDNA in
semen from men on ART.

Materials and methods
Semen processing
The semen samples used in this study were archived from
previously published studies [1,23]. Positive control samples used for validation of 2-LTR cDNA detection/quantification were from ART-naïve men with evidence of
seminal HIV-1 viremia (Group I). HIV-1 proviral DNA in
the cellular fraction had been assessed by quantitative
PCR; infectious HIV-1 was detected in seminal plasma
and cellular fractions by p24 assay following up to 21 days
of coculture with phytohaemagglutinin A (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [1].
These samples were collected before RT-PCR was widely
available, so HIV-1 RNA copy numbers were not assessed.
Samples used to test for seminal 2-LTR cDNA (cryptic
HIV-1 replication) in men on antiretroviral therapy were
from 22 HIV-1-positive men before and at 1 and 6 months
after addition of indinavir to dual nucleoside analog therapy (Group II). Clinical information for this cohort has
been presented in an earlier report (23). Seminal white
blood cell counts were obtained at the time of semen collection by microscopic analysis of peroxidase-stained polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and differential
counts of lymphocytes and macrophages by immunohistology [26]. Semen from this group was tested for HIV-1
proviral DNA and RNA by quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)/reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and blood
viral loads were monitored by the Chiron branched DNA
RNA-1 assay [23]. For 2-LTR cDNA assessment, aliquots
containing cell pellets from 250 µL of semen that had
been stored at -80°C were thawed. Nonspermatozoal
semen cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% SDS and

100 µg/mL proteinase K. DNA was extracted with the
standard phenol/chloroform/ethanol procedure, and
stored in distilled water at 4°C until use.
2-LTR cDNA detection and quantification
The 2-LTR cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR in the
presence of 10 nM digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled dUTP
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), to label the PCRamplified DNA products with DIG for their subsequent
ELISA analysis. The PCR cycling conditions were: 95°C for
10 min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 57°C for 30 sec and
72°C for 30 sec. The sense and antisense primers were: 5'AACTA GGGAA CCCAC TGCTT AAG-3' and 5'-TCCAC
AGATC AAGGA TATCT TGTC-3'[27]. Positive controls
(PBMC from HIV-1-infected men) and negative controls
(PBMC and semen from uninfected men) were included
in each experiment and underwent the same processing as
the test samples.

For the ELISA and Southern blot assays, a 29-base biotinylated probe was constructed (5'-GGAAA ATCTC TAGCA
GTACT GGAAG GGCT-3') containing, successively, the
last 15 bases of the HIV-1 genome (bases 9705–9719), an
additional 4 bases, GTAC, specifically found at HIV-1 2LTR circle junction, and the first 10 bases of the HIV-1
genome (bases 1–10). In ELISA, DIG-labeled PCR products were bound to the streptavidin-coated microtiterplate
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) via the biotinated
probe during a 3 hour-incubation at 56°C, and reacted
with anti-DIG antibody-HRP conjugate. Optical density
(OD) was measured at 405 nm after adding the HRP substrate ABTS. Samples were considered positive if the
OD405 was higher than the average of the negative PCR
controls plus 3 times standard deviation (ODneg + 3 SD).
Copy numbers of 2-LTR cDNA were determined from a
standard curve obtained by amplification of seriallydiluted 2-LTR cDNA positive control amplicons. As few as
10 copies of 2-LTR c DNA could be consistently detected
in repeated runs. For each sample, a housekeeping gene,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
was also amplified and quantified by ELISA to verify the
presence of amplifiable DNA.
The PCR products were also analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blot and DNA sequencing. Fifteen
microliters of PCR product were separated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH); Southern blot was
performed using the 29-base biotinylated probe. After a
high-stringency wash, streptavidin-HRP conjugate and its
substrate in Luminol/enhancer solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were added to the membrane. The image was
acquired with Fluorchem SP (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Direct sequencing of the PCR product was per-

facility.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) detection
Because CMV infection is common in HIV-1 infected
men, and seminal shedding of CMV has been associated
with elevated levels of HIV-1 in semen [28], we assayed
semen cell extracts for CMV DNA by PCR/ELISA. The
sense and antisense primers for CMV were: AGGCG
TGTAC GGTGG GAGGT CT and CCGCG TTCCA ATGCA
CCGTT CC [29]. The biotin-labeled probe was CCATA
GAAGA CACCG GGACC GATCC AGCCT. The PCR
parameters were 95°C 30 sec and 60°C 1 min for 40
cycles.

Results
2-LTR cDNA was detected in semen from 4/8 men in
Group I (positive controls). Copy numbers ranged from
55 to 504 copies/sample (Table 1). Semen from 2/22 men
in Group II on dual nucleoside analog ART were positive
for 2-LTR cDNA (336 and 8,560 copies/sample); one of
the 2-LTR cDNA positive samples had undetectable HIV-1
RNA, the other had elevated HIV RNA (4 × 105 copies,
Table 1). Following the addition of the protease inhibitor
(PI), indinavir, to the ART regimen, 0/40 semen samples
from 21 men with peripheral and seminal HIV-1 RNA
suppression were positive for 2-LTR cDNA (all 21 tested at
one-month, and 19 retested at 6 months). The remaining
subject in Group II, patient A, was intolerant of the indinavir regimen (nausea) and missed several doses. By one
month, blood HIV-1 RNA remained undetectable for this
individual, but seminal HIV-1 RNA copy numbers
increased from 4 × 105 (baseline) to 2 × 106. He was positive for seminal 2-LTR cDNA while on dual nucleoside
therapy before indinavir therapy (8,560 copies/sample),
and levels increased at the 1-month post indinavir treatment time point to 20,944/sample (Table 1). At 5-months
after initiation of indinavir, his treatment regimen was
changed (stavudine, sequinavir and continued lamivudine); by the 6-month time point blood viremia remained
undetectable, semen HIV-1 RNA decreased to 3 × 105, and
2-LTR cDNA was undetectable. Of interest, we previously
reported that distinct PI resistance mutations were detectable in semen and blood from Patient A 18 months after
the failed indinavir therapy (23).
2-LTR cDNA from the four positive samples with the
strongest signals in PCR/ELISA were also detected as 190
bp bands on agarose gels, confirming the correct size of
the amplified products (Figure 1). The binding of the
biotinylated probe to the PCR product in Southern blot
assay verified the correct orientation of the PCR amplicon.
(Figure 2). To confirm that HIV-1 2-LTR cDNA had been
amplified, PCR products from four 2-LTR cDNA positive
semen samples and positive PBMC controls were purified

All seven of the 2-LTR cDNA positive semen samples

2-LTR cDNA+ semen samples from Group I were from PInaïve men with leukocytospermia (LCS, i.e., ≥1,000,000
WBC/mL semen) and high seminal HIV-1 proviral DNA

copy numbers. Two out of three of the Group I 2-LTR
cDNA+ samples also contained cell-free infectious HIV-1;
the fourth 2-LTR cDNA+ was indeterminate in the culture
assay due to bacterial contamination. Seminal HIV-1 RNA
levels were not available for Group I. All three of the 2-LTR
cDNA positive semen samples from Group II men
contained proviral DNA; one was leukocytospermic, and
the two samples from Patient A at baseline and onemonth also contained high concentrations of HIV-1 RNA.

(Groups I and II) were also positive for CMV DNA (Table

On the other hand, many semen samples with indicators
of HIV-1 infection were negative in the 2-LTR cDNA assay.
Of the four negative Group I samples, all were from ARTnaïve men with seminal HIV-1 proviral DNA (inclusion
criteria for Group I); one was culture-positive for HIV-1,
and 2 were CMV DNA+. Of the 20 2-LTR cDNA-negative
Group II baseline samples, one was leukocytospermic, 4
had >100 copies of HIV-1 proviral DNA, 5 contained
>1,000 copies of cell-free HIV-1 RNA and 6 were CMV
DNA-positive. Of the 40 2-LTR cDNA-negative post-indinavir semen samples, four were leukocytospermic, 12 had
proviral HIV-1 DNA, and 5 were from men with seminal
CMV DNA.

Discussion
This study demonstrates for the first time that HIV-1 2LTR cDNA, a clinical marker of HIV-1 infection, can be
detected in semen from HIV-1-infected men. Because
seminal HIV-1 RNA can potentially originate from outside
the genital tract, and seminal HIV-1 proviral DNA may
represent latent infection, 2-LTR cDNA may prove to be a
valuable marker for monitoring HIV-1 infection within
genital tract tissues. The highest copy numbers of 2-LTR
cDNA in this study were detected in semen of a man fail-

ing indinavir therapy who later developed unique PI
resistance mutations in semen. Data from this study suggest that seminal 2-LTR cDNA may provide a useful
marker to predict the evolution of sexually transmissible
HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in men on ART.
Since the number of HIV-1-infected cells in semen is
restricted by small sample size, steps must be taken to
maximize HIV-1 DNA extraction. In the only other published study to investigate 2-LTR cDNA in semen, Nunnari
et al. [25] isolated seminal WBC on Ficoll before DNA
extraction and 2-LTR c-DNA assay. This procedure eliminates HIV-1-infected macrophages, which are an important source of infectious virus, and also reduces the T cell
yield [30]. Therefore, the sensitivity of 2-LTR cDNA detection in their study may have been compromised. In our
study, we used a direct lysis technique to extract DNA
from nonspermatozoal cells in semen cell pellets. Sperm
DNA is tightly bound by disulphide bonds in histones,
and its extraction requires the addition of a reducing agent
such as dithiothreitol (DTT) [31]. Our lysis technique
leaves the sperm heads intact and provides extracts
enriched for WBC DNA. In this study, numbers of semen
WBC ranged from 1.8 × 105 to 2.7 × 106/mL for 2-LTR
cDNA-positive samples, and 2-LTR cDNA copy numbers
were relatively low (range 10–630 per 106 cells). The
sensitivity of 2-LTR cDNA detection in semen could be

further increased by using a larger fraction of the semen
sample, instead of a small aliquot as was used in this
study, and by centrifugation procedures that enrich episomal HIV-1 DNA prior to the PCR reaction. Cell fractionation procedures could be applied to samples with high
copy numbers of 2-LTR cDNA to identify cellular targets
of HIV-1 infection in the male genital tract.
All of the 2-LTR cDNA+ semen samples contained HIV-1
proviral DNA, and all but two were positive for HIV-1
RNA or infectious virions. Five out of 7 of the 2-LTR
cDNA+ semen samples were also positive for seminal
CMV DNA, but this association was not statistically significant because CMV infection was common overall (4/8
men in Group I and 9/22 men in Group II were positive
for seminal CMV).
Two men on dual nucleoside analog treatment had 2-LTR
cDNA in semen; one of these individuals failed subsequent indinavir therapy and continued to have high levels
of HIV-1 RNA and 2-LTR cDNA in semen, although
peripheral viral load was undetectable. These data provide
further evidence that HIV-1 replication can occur in the
genital tract of men on ART, potentially leading to the
evolution of drug resistance mutations in semen that cannot be monitored in peripheral blood. On the other hand,
none of 40 post-indinavir semen samples from men controlling HIV-1 RNA levels in blood and semen was positive for 2-LTR cDNA, suggesting that cryptic HIV-1
replication in the genital tract (without the appearance of
HIV-1 RNA in blood or semen) may be uncommon in
men on effective ART.
The origin of HIV-1 and infected cells in semen is poorly
understood. Some infected cells and HIV-1 virions in
semen may originate from infection outside the genital
tract, but genetic evidence indicates that at least some of
the HIV-1 detected in semen is distinct from HIV-1 in
peripheral blood [6-8]. Although germ cells and other cell
types have been studied as potential HIV-1 reservoirs in
the male genital tract, recent attention has focused on genital tract WBC. Semen contains variable numbers of CD4+
T cells and macrophages [32], and recent studies using
immunobeads or gradient/sperm-wash methods have
demonstrated that these semen cell types carry HIV-1 proviral DNA and are highly infectious [30,33]. HIV-1infected T cells and macrophages have been detected
throughout the male genital tract [34]. Inflammatory conditions, such as those occurring during infection with
other sexually transmitted pathogens, attract large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages into the seminal
compartment, and are associated with higher numbers of
infected cells and infectious virus in semen [1,11,35]. It is
unknown to what extent HIV-1 infected WBC migrate to
the genital tract from peripheral blood or other tissues, or

http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/2/1/9

are infected in situ by HIV-1 in the genital tract. A recent
study entailing phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide
sequences of the C2-V5 region of HIV-1 gp120 from HIV1 RNA isolated from semen cells and seminal plasma
from 5 HIV-1-infected men provided evidence that cellfree HIV-1 in semen has distinct sequences and may not
be derived from cells represented in semen [36]. Future
studies on the presence of HIV 2-LTR cDNA in genital tract
and semen cell populations should provide improved
insight into sources of HIV-1 infection in the male genital
tract.

Conclusion
This study, which shows that HIV-1 2-LTR c-DNA is
detectable in semen cells, provides evidence that HIV-1
infection occurs in the genital tract. This molecular marker
of HIV infection could provide an important research tool
for better understanding sites of HIV-1 infection in the
male genital tract, and as a clinical tool for monitoring
genital tract HIV-1 infection in men on suppressive ART.
