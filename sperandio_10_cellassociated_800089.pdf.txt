Abstract
Background: MFN1032 is a clinical Pseudomonas fluorescens strain able to grow at 37°C. MFN1032 cells induce necrosis
and apoptosis in rat glial cells at this temperature. This strain displays secretion-mediated hemolytic activity involving
phospholipase C and cyclolipopeptides. Under laboratory conditions, this activity is not expressed at 37°C. This activity
is tightly regulated and is subject to phase variation.
Results: We found that MFN1032 displays a cell-associated hemolytic activity distinct from the secreted hemolytic
activity. Cell-associated hemolysis was expressed at 37°C and was only detected in vitro in mid log growth phase in the
presence of erythrocytes. We studied the regulation of this activity in the wild-type strain and in a mutant defective in
the Gac two-component pathway. GacS/GacA is a negative regulator of this activity. In contrast to the Pseudomonas
fluorescens strains PfO-1 and Pf5, whose genomes have been sequenced, the MFN1032 strain has the type III secretionlike genes hrcRST belonging to the hrpU operon. We showed that disruption of this operon abolished cell-associated
hemolytic activity. This activity was not detected in P.fluorescens strains carrying similar hrc genes, as for the P. fluorescens
psychrotrophic strain MF37.
Conclusions: To our knowledge this the first demonstration of cell-associated hemolytic activity of a clinical strain of
Pseudomonas fluorescens. Moreover, this activity seems to be related to a functional hrpU operon and is independent of
biosurfactant production. Precise link between a functional hrpU operon and cell-associated hemolytic activity remains
to be elucidated.
Background
Pseudomonas fluorescens is a highly heterogeneous species, as shown the extensive literature on the taxonomy
and phylogeny of this species [1-4]. These studies include
saprophytic, rhizopheric and phytopathogenic strains of
P. fluorescens, illustrating the ubiquity of this species.
Most studies describe P. fluorescens as a psychrotrophic
bacterium unable to grow at temperatures greater than
32°C and therefore as an avirulent bacterium in humans.
Nevertheless, previous studies of the infectious potential
of P. fluorescens have demonstrated that the rifampicin
spontaneous mutant MF37 [5] derived from the environmental psychrotrophic strain MF0 [6] can bind specifically to the surface of neurons and glial cells [7]. This

adhesion to the host cell is associated with the induction
of apoptosis and necrosis in glial cells [8]. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) produced or released by P. fluorescens
have a clear role in cytotoxicity, but other factors released
at the same time during adhesion also seem to be essential for the virulence of this bacterium [9]. Thus the various enzymes secreted by this species may also be
considered as potential high virulence factors [5].
We recently demonstrated that the clinical strain
MFN1032 is a Pseudomonas fluorescens sensus stricto
Biovar1 strain able to grow at 37°C [10]. This strain has
hemolytic activity mediated by secreted factors, similar to
the hemolytic activity seen for the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, involving phospholipase C
(PlcC) and biosurfactant [11]. Under specific conditions,
MFN1032 forms colonies of phenotypic variants, which
are defective in secreted hemolysis. Spontaneous mutations of the genes encoding the two-component regulatory system GacS/GacA have been identified as the cause

of phenotypic variation in one such group of variants. We
hypothesized that phenotypic variation increases the virulence potential of this strain. However these group variants (group 1 variants) do not produce secondary
metabolites and have impaired biofilm formation [12].
Then, these results suggested that virulence of MFN1032
is not dependent solely on secreted factors or LPS and
thus must involve other factors.
Some bacterial virulence factors are only expressed in
the presence of eukaryotic cells. This is the case of the
type III secretion system (TTSS), one of the most frequently described contact dependent secretion systems
in Pseudomonas. TTSSs are found in many Gram-negative pathogens. They allow the direct translocation of
bacterial effector proteins into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells. P. aeruginosa uses the TTSS to translocate
four effector proteins (ExoS, ExoT, ExoU, and ExoY) with
antihost properties [13]. The P. aeruginosa TTSS consists
of nearly 40 genes, regulated in a coordinated manner
and encoding structural components of the secretion and
translocation machinery, effectors proteins, and regulatory factors [14]. Transcription of the TTSS is induced
under calcium-limited growth conditions or following
intimate contact of P. aeruginosa with eukaryotic host
cells [15]. Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 is a
phytopathogenic bacterium that harbors a gene cluster
hrp (for hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity). This
hrp cluster is essential for pathogenicity in susceptible
plants and for the ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction in nonhosts or resistant cultivars of host plants [16].
hrp genes are expressed in planta or in media mimicking
plant apoptotic conditions [17]. Sequence analyses have
uncovered a shared subset of nine hrp genes that were
renamed hrc (for hrp and conserved) and that encode
proteins homologous to Yersinia ysc gene products [18].
The existence of these genes suggests evolutionary conservation of molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity used
by both mammalian and phytopathogenic bacteria [19].
In P. fluorescens, the presence of the hrc genes belonging to hrpU operon depends on the strain. The feature of
TTSS and the origin of hrc genes remain to clarify in this
species [20-23].
In the present study, we describe the detection of cellassociated hemolytic activity of P. fluorescens MFN1032
in contact with sheep erythrocytes. This hemolytic activity was compared with the hemolytic activity of other P.
fluorescens strains: a spontaneous MFN1032 gacA
mutant and the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa CHA [24]. Cell-associated hemolytic activity
and its regulation were compared with the activity and
regulation of the previously described secreted hemolytic
activity of MFN1032. We then looked for hrc genes in our
strain and determined their role in the cell-associated

Results
MFN1032 displays cell-associated hemolytic activity

Hemolytic activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens biovar I
MFN1032 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa CHA (positive
control for TTSS-mediated hemolysis) was measured by
the technique employed by Dacheux [25], adapted as
described in methods.
Bacteria were grown at 37°C to mid exponential growth
phase and were used at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 1, without spin (which enhance contact between bacteria and RBCs). CHA induced lysis of 5% of red blood cells
(RBCs) and MFN1032, 50% lysis, within 1 hour at 37°C.
Hemolytic activity of CHA was increased by a 10 min
centrifugation at 400 g (20% lysis) or 1500 g (70% lysis).
By contrast, the hemolytic activity of MFN1032 was
unchanged after a 10 min centrifugation at 400 g and
reduced by centrifugation at 1500 g (35% lysis) (Figure 1).
For further experiments we used a 10 min centrifugation
at 400 g since this protocol is allowing close contact
between bacterial cells and RBCs and appears compatible
with maximum lysis by MFN1032. Supernatants from
MFN1032 cells tested in the same conditions had no
hemolytic activity. Additionally, we collected supernatants from RBC lysed by MFN1032. Supernatants were
filtered and incubated with fresh RBCs for 1 h at 37°C.
This supernatant from lysed RBC samples did not induce
further RBC lysis. Thus, the factor mediating RBC lysis is
not a factor released into the supernatant, but is dependent on the presence of MFN1032 cells.
MFN1032 cells from cultures grown to the exponential
growth phase at various temperatures were incubated
with RBCs for 1 h at 37°C. MFN1032 bacteria grown at
17°C and 37°C showed the same levels of hemolysis (50%
of RBCs lysed), whereas bacteria grown at 8°C were
almost devoid of hemolytic activity (5% lysis). The maximal hemolytic activity of MFN1032 was observed at 28°C
(70% lysis), the optimal growth temperature of this strain
(Figure 2).
Lysis of RBCs is caused by a pore-forming toxin from
MFN1032

We investigated the nature of the factor involved in RBC
lysis by osmoprotection experiments. Osmoprotectants
protect RBCs against osmotic shock provoked by bacterial pore-forming toxins. We used different sized molecules in hemolysis experiments to estimate the size of the
pore formed in the RBC membrane (Figure 3). We did not
observe any effects on hemolysis with PEG300, PEG600,
PEG1500 or PEG2000. Molecules larger than PEG2000
protected against MFN1032 cell-associated hemolysis as

observed for PEG3000. A maximal level of protection was
reached with PEG4000, resulting in the protection of 90%
of RBCs against this hemolytic process. Based on these
results, we estimated the size of the pore formed in RBC
membranes by MFN1032 is between 2.4 nm and 3.2 nm.
MFN1032 cell-associated hemolytic activity is higher than
in other Pseudomonas fluorescens strains

We tested the hemolytic activity of MFN1032, MFY162 (a
clinical isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar I),
MFY161 and MFY163 (clinical isolates of Pseudomonas
mosselli) [10], MF37 (Pseudomonas fluorescens biovar V,
derived from a psychrotrophic environmental strain) and
C7R12 (a psychrotrophic rhizospheric strain) cells at 28
and 37°C.
The hemolytic effect of MFN1032 cells was much
higher than the other strains tested, at both growth temperatures (Figure 4). At 28°C, MFY162 was the only other
strain showing high levels of hemolytic activity (40%
lysis); MFY161 and MFY163 displayed only weak hemolytic activity (5-10% lysis). All clinical isolates showed
some hemolytic activity (15% lysis) at 37°C, but at a lower
level than that observed for MFN1032 one's. The envi-

ronmental strains tested were not hemolytic at 28°C and
did not grow at 37°C.
The hemolytic activities of MFN1032, MFY162 and
MFY161, were maximal at their optimal growth temperature (28°C for MFN1032 and MFY162, 37°C for MFY
161). The hemolytic activity of the strain MFY163 was
the same at 28°C and 37°C.
Involvement of the Gac two-component system on cellassociated hemolytic activity

We investigated the possible involvement of the Gac twocomponent system in the regulation of this cell-associated hemolytic activity using a group1 variant of
MFN1032, V1. This variant strain is a gacA mutant and
has impaired secreted hemolytic activity [12]. V1 was
tested with or without transformation by electroporation
with plasmid carrying the gacA gene (pMP5565) or the
parental plasmid pME6010, as a control [26] (Figure 5).
The non-transformed V1 strain displayed enhanced
hemolytic activity (160% lysis), using MFN1032 as a reference value (100%). Introduction of a gacA gene in V1 cells
by electroporation with pMP5565 restored wild-type
hemolytic levels.

MFN1032 has hrcRST genes

The lysis of RBCs by a number of bacteria requires the
formation of a pore in the erythrocyte membrane by
TTSS protein. To determine whether TTSS-like genes are
present in MFN1032 and MF37, we used PCR primers
targeting hrpU operon, (so called U operon of the hrp
cluster of type I) encoding the conserved core proteins of
fluorescent Pseudomonas TTSS, described by Mazurier
et al. [23]. The region amplified by these primers includes
the 3'end of hrcR, hrcS and the 5'end of hrcT.
A single fragment of 0.9 kb was obtained for MFN1032
and MF37 and cloned with the pMOS kit. Fragments
were sequenced by Genome Express (France). Sequences
were registered in the Genbank database (accession number: EU811174 for MFN1032 and FJ694188 for MF37)
and named "hrc operon", partial sequence. These
sequences predict an 87 residues HrcS protein in these
two strains.
A NCBI nucleotide and protein database search
showed that the putative HrcS from MFN1032 was very
similar to the putative MF37 HrcS (90% identity) and to
RscS (94% identity), a type III secretion protein from the
Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SBW25 (belonging to the

HrcS/YscS/FliQ family), but is more distantly related to
the HrcS of C7R12 (73.9% identity) (Table 1). The P.
aeruginosa PAO1 FliP partial protein showed 47% identity.
Effect of disruption of the hrpU operon

We investigated a possible link between this hrpU operon
and the cell-associated hemolytic activity of MFN1032.
We used a mutant strain, MFN1030, in which the hrpU
operon was disrupted, to determine whether TTSS proteins are required for the hemolytic activity observed in
MFN1032. In this construction, the single homologue
recombination provokes at least the deletion of the 5'-end
of hrcT (58% of HrcT) and of genes situated downstream
hrcT in this operon (Figure 6). We observed an almost
total loss of cell-associated hemolytic activity (10% lysis)
in the mutant strain. Revertant of MFN1030, the strain
MFN1031, had a restored hemolytic phenotype, showing
activity levels similar to those of MFN1032 (Figure 7A).
These results demonstrate a link between the hrpU
operon and this cell-associated hemolytic activity in P.
fluorescens MFN1032.
Given the homology between hrcS and fliP, we investigated the potential role of hrcRST genes in flagellar syn-

MFN1030 was measured in swimming mobility assays, as
described in the methods. At 28°C, we observed no differences in swimming ability between MFN1032,
MFN1030 and MFN1031 (Figure 7B), suggesting that disruption of this operon has no effect on flagella motility.

cell-associated hemolytic activity in clinical isolates of a

exponential growth phase displayed hemolytic activity at
37°C, whereas no hemolytic activity was detected using
MFN1032 supernatant. This hemolytic activity was thus
dependent on the presence of MFN1032 cells. MFN1032
cells caused hemolysis of RBCs without requiring prior
centrifugation to reduce the distance between bacterial
and red cell membrane below a critical threshold. Such a
centrifugation step has previously been shown to be necessary to induce the "contact-dependent" hemolytic activ-

ity displayed by several other bacteria, for example
Yersinia [27], Shigella [28] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
[25]. In contrast, "induced" hemolysis does not require
close RBC-bacterial contact for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli EPEC, due to the long EspA (TTSS secreted
protein) filaments that form a connection between bacte-

ria and host cells for protein translocation [29,30].
MFN1032 hemolytic activity was not strictly contactdependent but depended on the presence of MFN1032
cells. We therefore propose the term "cell-associated"
hemolytic activity.
This activity is independent of the secreted hemolytic
activity previously described for this strain. For all tested
conditions, we have previously demonstrated that
secreted hemolytic activity only occurs at the end of the
exponential growth phase [11]. MFN1032 supernatants
were not hemolytic at 37°C in vitro and hemolysis was
maximal at 17°C. Cell-associated hemolysis measured
here was maximal during the exponential growth phase
and retrieved at 37°C. Moreover, a gacA mutant of
MFN1032 (V1), for which several extracellular activities
are impaired (including secreted hemolytic activity),
showed increased cell-associated hemolytic activity. In
psychrotrophic bacteria, most secreted enzymes are generally found at 17°C (critical temperature), whereas membrane-associated activities are enhanced with decreased
generation time [6,31]. Thus, the maximum expression of
this new hemolytic activity at 28°C (optimal growth temperature) is consistent with a cell surface associated process.
This hemolytic activity is not common to all Pseudomonas fluorescens species. Indeed, we only observed significant cell-associated hemolysis in the clinical strains
MFN1032 and MFY162 and not in the environmental

limited and can not be considered as representative, the
presence of this activity seems to be dependent on strain
origin, i.e clinical source. Cell-associated hemolytic activity has been rarely observed in environmental strains.

ously been found in the P. fluorescens strains KD (phytoprotection strain) and SBW25 (biocontrol strain) [22,34].
In one study of a group of fluorescent Pseudomonas,
TTSS-like genes were detected in 75% of the phytopathogenic but only in 32% of the saprophytic strains tested
[23]. The presence of hrcRST genes is not systematically
correlated to hemolytic activity. Indeed, P. fluorescens
MF37 and C7R12 have similar hrcRST genes to MFN1032
but are not hemolytic. Thus, the presence of these genes
does not strictly imply hemolytic function. Lysis is dependent upon the ability of TTSS translocator proteins to
form a pore in the erythrocyte membrane causing hemoglobin leakage. The presence of these hrcRST genes does
not necessarily result in the assembly of a functional
TTSS. Some TTSS genes are absent from SBW25 and
TTSS virulence genes in KD have been suggested to have
been recently acquired horizontally from phytopathogenic bacteria and recycled for biocontrol function [22].
TTSS-dependent lysis of erythrocytes has been
observed in a number of bacteria. Contact-dependent
hemolysis assays have been used to identify the genes
required for a functional Salmonella TTSS 1 [35].
MFN1032 cell-associated hemolytic activity shares common features with TTSS-mediated hemolysis. The various mechanisms involved include formation of a pore
with an estimated size of 2.4 to 3.2 nm, consistent with
TTSS-hemolysis mechanism previously described by
Dacheux for Pseudomonas aeruginosa [25]. MFN1032
cells did not show this cell-associated hemolysis during
the stationary growth phase. Previous studies have shown
a negative effect of high cell density, through a RpoSmediated mechanisms [36] or by quorum-sensing [37],
on TTSS gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
We found increased hemolytic activity in the MFN1032
gacA mutant (V1). This result suggests that the Gac twocomponent system is a negative regulator of cell-associated hemolytic activity. Studies on TTSS regulation in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa have demonstrated that the
GacA response regulator inhibits TTSS function and
that, in a gacA mutant, the TTSS effector ExoS is hypersecreted [38]. Opposite, in Pseudomonas syringae, GacA
is a positive regulator of the TTSS [39]. The homology
between MFN1032 genes and plant-associated TTSS
genes is not in favour of a direct negative transcriptional
regulation by the system Gac.
To investigate the potential role of TTSS in this hemolytic process, we constructed a mutant with hrpU operon
disruption, MFN1030, in which hemolytic activity was
severely impaired. Hemolysis was restored in revertant
MFN1031 cells, with hemolytic activity levels similar to
wild type. Thus, cell-associated hemolytic activity seems
to require an intact hrpU operon. In contrast, hrpU
operon disruption did not affect swimming motility, suggesting that hrpU operon is not involved in flagella bio-

synthesis. In MFN1030 the single homologue
recombinaison event with PME3087-hrcRST would
result in, at least, a lack of HrcT protein. In Pseudomonas
cichorri, an insertion of transposon in hrcT was described
as sufficient to lost virulence on eggplant [40]. This large
insertion in MFN1030 would have a polar effect on genes
situated downstream this operon. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, hrcRST genes are highly conserved. Other genes
of the hrpU operon, however, seem to vary considerably
[22,34]. PCR experiments based on SBW25 and KD
sequences did not lead to an amplification of any hrc
genes located downstream or upstream hrcRST (data not
shown). An experiment of chromosome walking should
allow us to identify these genes.
The hrcRST genes from Pseudomonas fluorescens
MFN1032 show a high level of homology with hrcRST
genes from Pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogen.
TTSS-dependent pore formation is due to the insertion
of the translocation pores into host cell membranes. In
Pseudomonas syringae, Hrpzpsph forms pores in vitro and
is exported by the TTSS. However, when introduced into
Yersinia enterocolitica cells, this protein is exported via
the Yersinia SSTT but cannot replace YopB functions and
do not cause RBC hemolysis [19]. HrpZ is unable to
induce pore formation. Moreover, in the two strains of
Pseudomonas fluorescens already described no hrpZ
homologue was found. We tried to amplify this gene with
primers design from hprZ from other pseudomonad, but
without success.
The nature of the TTSS component implicates in the
cell hemolytic activity of MFN1032 remains to be determined. We will address this issue in future studies.

Conclusion
Pseudomonas fluorescens MFN1032 is a clinical strain
isolate that displays two distinct types of hemolytic activity, described here for the first time. The first type is
observed in the cell-free supernatant of rich media cultures at 28°C, whereas the second, cell-associated type of
hemolysis, is detected at 37°C in the presence of erythrocytes. This strain has hrcRST genes, a feature that is not
shared by all Pseudomonas fluorescens strains. Our study
establishes an unexpected link between these hrc genes
and cell-associated hemolytic activity. These initial findings are consistent, although not sufficient, to demonstrate that this cell-associated hemolysis is due to a
functional TTSS. Investigation of type III effector genes
in the genome of this strain and the construction of targeted mutants are now needed to confirm these findings.
Nevertheless, this study suggests that certain strains of
the highly heterogeneous species Pseudomonas fluorescens, which is usually considered to be a saprophytic species, express virulence with characteristic of pathogenic
species belonging to the Pseudomonas genus. Neverthe-

less the principal role of this TTSS homologue to the one
of plant-associated bacteria is probably not the pathogenicity against endotherms. The first target of this system
would rather be unicellular eukaryotes of the rhizosphere, as mycetes or amoebas.

Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions

The MFN1032 strain was collected from a hospital
patient suffering from pulmonary tract infection (expectoration) and was considered to be the cause of the infection. MFN1032 was identified as a Pseudomonas
fluorescens biovar I strain [10] and was able to grow at
37°C.
CHA is a bronchopulmonary isolate of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa from a cystic fibrosis patient [24]. This strain
induces TTSS-dependent but ExoU-independent oncosis
of neutrophils and macrophages. CHA-induced macrophage death results from a pore forming activity that is
dependent on the TTSS. Contact dependent hemolysis
provoked by CHA requires the same pore forming activity. CHA has a well inducible and tightly regulated TTSS
[41], and is used in our study as a positive control of RBCTTSS hemolysis.
MF37 is a spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutant of
the MFO strain, a psychrotrophic strain of Pseudomonas
fluorescens biovar V, isolated from raw milk and extensively studied in our laboratory [5].
MFY162 is a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens
Biovar I, MFY161 and MFY163 are clinical isolates of
Pseudomonas mosselli [10] and C7R12 a Pseudomonas
fluorescens psychrotrophic rhizospheric strain [42].
These bacteria were cultured in Luria Bertani medium
(LB), at various temperatures between 8 and 37°C, with
shaking at 180 rpm. When necessary, 20 μg/mL tetracycline or 100 μg/mL ampicillin was added. Bacterial density was determined by measuring optical density at 580
nm (Spectronic Unicam spectrophotometer).
Swimming motility

Each strain was incubated on LB agar plates for 24 h at
28°C. Plates of LB medium solidified with 0.3% agar were
inoculated by stabbing colonies with a toothpick and
inserting the end of the toothpick just below the surface
of the agar. Three colonies were picked from three plates
and incubated at 28°C until a migration halo appeared.
Hemolysis assay

Hemolysis was performed essentially as described by
Dacheux [25]. Sheep red blood cells (RBCs), obtained
from Eurobio (France), were washed three times in PBS
(pH 7.2, 0.8% NaCl, 0.02% KCl, 0.17% Na2HPO4, 0.8%
KH2PO4) and resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium without pH indicator (Sigma) at a density of 5 × 108 RBCs mL-

1 at

4°C. Bacteria were grown in LB to an OD580 nm of 0.7 1.5, centrifuged and resuspended in RPMI-1640 at 5 × 108
bacteria mL-1. Hemolysis assays were started by mixing
100 μL of RBCs and 100 μL of bacteria, which were than
centrifuged at 1500 g or 400 g for 10 minutes and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The release of hemoglobin was
measured at 540 nm, after centrifugation, in 100 μL of cell
supernatant.
The percentage (%) of total lysis was calculated as follows: % = [(X -B)/(T-B)] × 100, where B (baseline), a negative control, was corresponding to RBCs incubated with
100 μL of RPMI-1640, and T, a positive control, was corresponding to total RBCs lysis, obtained by incubating
cells with 0.1% SDS. X is the OD value of the analysed
sample.
When indicated, RBCs were resuspended in 60 mM
sterile solutions of osmoprotectant in RPMI-1640, to give
a final concentration of 30 mM. For these experiments, a
control of hemoglobin precipitation in presence of PEG
4000 and PEG 3000 was realized [43]. PEG 3000 or 4000
were added to a RBCs lysis supernatant obtained after
incubation with MFN1032 at a final concentration of 30
mM. No variation of hemoglobin OD value was observed
in our conditions during incubation at 37°C for 1 h.
Oligonucleotides and polymerase chain reactions

MFN1032 and MF37 strains were resuspended in 500 μL
sterile ultrapure water. The suspension (2 μL) was then
used for PCR amplification of DNA from bacterial colonies. PCR was carried out in a 25 μL reaction volume, in a
GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (Perkin-Elmer Corporation,
USA). Each reaction mixture contained DNA, 0.25 μL
Taq polymerase (Q-Biogen, Illkrirch, France), 2.5 μL corresponding buffer, 2.5 μL primers (20 μM) and 2 μL
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (2.5 mM). After initial
denaturation for three minutes at 95°C, the reaction mixture was subjected to 35 cycles of 1 minute at 94°C, 1
minute at 41°C and two minutes at 72°C, followed by a
final 3 minutes extension at 72°C. PCR primers,
HRCR8092 (5'-CCITT(C/T)ATCGT(C/T)AT(C/T)GA
(C/T)(C/T)T-3') and HRCT8986 (5'-CTGTCCCAGATIAICTGIGT-3') (where I indicates inosine), synthesized by
Eurogentec (Angers, France), were designed to amplify
the "hrc operon", a region of operon U of the hrp cluster
of type I (hrpU operon), including the 3' end of hrcR
(26%), hrcS (100%), and the 5' end of hrcT (42%) (approximately 897 bp) [23].
Aliquots (5 μL) of the PCR products were analyzed by
electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium
bromide and photographed under UV illumination.
Cloning and sequencing the hrcRST PCR fragment

PCR products were cloned with the pMOSBlue bluntended cloning kit (Amersham/Biosciences). MOS cells

Sperandio et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:124
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/124

were transformed and, after blue/white colony screening,
clones were picked and plasmid DNA was isolated with
the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen).
The PCR products were sequenced by Genome Express
(France). The predicted sequences of MFN1032 hrcRST
and MF37 hrcRST were submitted for BLAST queries
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/.
Construction of MFN1030, an hrcU operon-disrupted
mutant of MFN1032 and MF1031, its revertant

The hrcRST-pMOS plasmid from MFN1032 was digested
with EcoRI/HindIII and subsequently hrcRST fragment
was inserted into the transferable suicide plasmid
pME3087 (6,9 Kb) digested by the same enzymes [44].
This construction, pME3087-hrcRST (7,8 kb), was then
introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α MCR cells by electroporation. Plasmids were isolated using the QIAprep
Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), checked by digestion with
HindIII/EcoRI and transferred into the Escherichia coli
conjugative strain S17.1 [45]. Colonies were selected for
their resistance to tetracycline (20 μg/mL). MFN1032
(naturally ampicillin resistant) cells were conjugated with
S17.1 cells carrying the pME3087-hrcRST plasmid and
strains were selected for their resistance to tetracycline
(20 μg/mL) and ampicillin (100 μg/mL) that corresponds
to insertion of the whole plasmid via a single homologue
recombinaison. One of the clones was selected and corresponded to an hrpU operon disruption mutant. This disruption mutant was called MFN1030. The reversion of
the mutant MFN1030 was obtained after incubating
MFN1030 cells on an LB agar plate for 72 hours. Of all
the colonies obtained, 100 were subcultured in parallel on
LB agar plates with or without tetracycline (20 μg/mL).
Colonies growing on LB agar plates without tetracycline but not on LB agar plates with tetracycline (20 μg/
mL) reflect a second recombination event and an excision
of the plasmid. One clone was selected and named
MFN1031, a revertant of MFN1030 strain.
