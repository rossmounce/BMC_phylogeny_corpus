Analysis of quality raw data of second generation
sequencers with Quality Assessment Software

Abstract
Background: Second generation technologies have advantages over Sanger; however, they have resulted in new
challenges for the genome construction process, especially because of the small size of the reads, despite the high
degree of coverage. Independent of the program chosen for the construction process, DNA sequences are
superimposed, based on identity, to extend the reads, generating contigs; mismatches indicate a lack of homology
and are not included. This process improves our confidence in the sequences that are generated.
Findings: We developed Quality Assessment Software, with which one can review graphs showing the distribution
of quality values from the sequencing reads. This software allow us to adopt more stringent quality standards for
sequence data, based on quality-graph analysis and estimated coverage after applying the quality filter, providing
acceptable sequence coverage for genome construction from short reads.
Conclusions: Quality filtering is a fundamental step in the process of constructing genomes, as it reduces the
frequency of incorrect alignments that are caused by measuring errors, which can occur during the construction
process due to the size of the reads, provoking misassemblies. Application of quality filters to sequence data, using
the software Quality Assessment, along with graphing analyses, provided greater precision in the definition of
cutoff parameters, which increased the accuracy of genome construction.

Background
The introduction of second-generation genome sequencing has reduced the cost and time required for genome
construction; this method generates large amounts of
data and increased sequencing coverage when compared
to the dideoxy terminal Sanger method [1]. However,
this new methodology reduces the size of the readings
and has brought challenges to the genome assembly
process, such as a need to develop efficient algorithms
to reconstruct the genome [2]. Several examples of programs suitable for genome assembly from short reads
are Velvet [3], Edena [4], SHARCGS [5], VCAKE [6],
ALLPATHS [7], Euler-SR [8], and Quality-value guided
Short Read Assembler (QSRA) [9]. All of them involve a
process of connecting overlapping DNA sequences;
however, only QRSA considers the quality of the reads
during the assembly process.

Regardless of the assembly method used, data preparation is necessary. One step in this preparation is the
quality filter, whenever readings are taken with a lower
phred quality [10]. Independent of the genome construction system, it is necessary to prepare the data.
One of the steps in data preparation is a quality filter,
with which reads with low phred quality are removed.
This improves the alignment of the sequences to avoid
problems due to mismatches [11]. Li et al. (2010)
observed a 50% decrease in alignment errors when bases
screened for quality were used; this is an important part
of the preparation required for producing accurate
results.
The cutoff value for read quality affects the coverage
and especially the quality of sequencing. Very stringent
parameters can reduce the coverage of the genome and
hinder the assembly process. Also, using poor-quality
bases that are products of mismatches can lead to less
accurate results. To address this problem, we developed
the software Quality Assessment (QA), with which one
can review graphs showing the distribution of quality
values from the sequencing reads, including the average

quality, and the accumulated quality for each of the
bases; this information can be used to estimate the coverage and quantity of the readings that pass through the
quality filter.
Input format

QA receives two files as input: the first with standardonly Phred quality values for each base of a read, and
the second containing the sequences in nucleotides or
color space (SOLiD). The input files must have equal
size sequences such as those generated by the SOLiD
and Illumina platforms in order to be used for the generation of quality graphs.
Sample Data

The data that we tested with this software were obtained
from sequencing of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis
(Cp162) and Exiguobacterium antarcticum (B7) with
SOLiD system, using a library of fragments with readings of 35 base pairs (bp) and a mate-pair library with
25 bp for each tag, F3 and R3, respectively [12]. We
obtained 21,102,241 readings from the Cp162 data, and
44,171,676 and 45,024,226 readings, from the B7 tags F3
and R3, respectively.
The estimated genome coverage was obtained using
the formula C = (n * L)/S, where C is the estimated coverage, n is the number of readings, L is the size of the

Page 2 of 6

reads and S is the expected size of the genome [13].
The expected sizes for the genomes used in this study
were defined based on phylogenetically-related organisms deposited in Genbank. For Cp162, a size of 2.3
mega bases (Mb) was obtained based on Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis FRC41 (CP002097), and for B7,
about 3 Mb was obtained based on Exiguobacterium
sibiricum 255-15 (CP001022).
Implementation

The software was developed in JAVA programming language http://java.sun.com/, using the paradigm of object
orientation and the graph library Swing http://java.sun.
com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing. Input is raw files from
the sequencing machine (multifasta format): (i) files
containing the quality values of phred for the readings
[14] and (ii) sequences in color space [15] or nucleotide
format; this information is solicited only at the time that
the quality filter is applied to the data. The software
(Figure 1) offers an option in which the size of the
expected reads is informed, and when processing is finished it generates a log that shows the multifasta-filesequence formatting problems: invalid characters, blank
lines, and reads that are not of the expected size; these
are eliminated in the processing. Optionally, the software can be run without the graphing interface; however, in this option it is not possible to estimate the

Figure 1 Main screen of the Quality Assessment software. The quality input file and the size of the expected reads must be defined to start
the data process. After it, the quality graphs can be generated using the specific buttons.

coverage of the genome, and the phred quality values
need to be previously defined.
The raw data file, which includes information on the
quality of the sequences, is processed, and the frequencies of the mean and median values for each base are
stored in a hash table, to be used to calculate the estimated coverage of the sequencing and for the

generation of the graphs that show the distribution of
the base quality values and means, using the library
JfreeChart http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/.
Applying the filter to the raw data files requires a
large memory; for this reason, after the first file is generated, the memory reserved for the execution of the
process is liberated to the operational system through

the Java language resource know as garbage collection,
run by the program itself. The filtered files are stored in
the same original directories, with the extension.new
added to each file name.

Results and Discussion
The mean quality of each of the 35 sequence bases from
the Cp162 data can be observed in Figure 2a; 17 of these

Page 4 of 6

gave a mean quality equal to or greater than phred 20,
while the terminal bases of the reads had a mean quality
of less than 20 [16]. Figure 3a shows the frequency of the
quality values of the 35 th base of Cp162, with phred 5
being the most common value, which influences the
reduction in mean quality observed for this base in Figure 2a. When a cut off filter of phred 20 was applied, the
number of reads was reduced by about 43% (Table 1),

resulting in a sequence coverage of 172×. Based on the
data in Table 2, application of a filter with phred 23
values would give sequence coverage above 100× and a
high degree of accuracy of the reads, which would reduce
the possibility of misassemblies [17].
In the case of IB7 with the tags F3 and R3, both with
25 bp, the mean quality of the bases was above 20,
except for the terminal bases shown in Figures 2b and
2c, with tag R3 presenting better quality than F3, except
at the 12th base. The terminal bases, Figures 3b and 3c,
had the highest frequencies of quality levels at phred 5
and 26 for F3 and R3, respectively, which allows more
stringent filters to be applied to tag R3, without excessive loss of coverage, when compared to F3 (Table 2).
After applying the quality filter to F3 and R3, with a
cutoff at phred 20, the percentage reads discarded for
F3 was greater than for R3 (Table 1).
Defining quality values above phred 20 reduced the
coverage of the sequences, but it increased data quality,
as can be seen in Table 2, in which phred values of 23
and 25 were used as quality cutoff values.
To apply the filter, one can use mean or median quality values observed in the read. When the mean is used,
low quality bases can provoke elimination of the read,
which can reduce the coverage of the sequencing,
though it will also increase the quality [17]. Variation in
the quality values of the bases does not influence the
median, which could result in a tendency to accept low
quality bases, increasing the probability of errors in the
genome construction process.
In Figure 4a, we can see a reading with a median
value of 23 and a mean of 19; consequently, if we apply

two Fasta format sequences containing Phred quality values of 25
bp-long reads. A - Fasta sequence with a median and mean Phred
qualities of 23 and 19, respectively. B - Fasta sequence with a
median and mean Phred qualities of 19 and 22, respectively.

a quality filter with phred 20 based on the median, the
read would be considered as having six bases with quality below 10. In Figure 4b, if the same filter were
applied, the read would be discarded, even though it has
a mean quality value of 22.

Conclusions
Applying a quality filter to raw sequencing data is
required in order to reduce sequence construction error,
given that the methodologies available for constructing
genomes are based on sequence alignment, in which a
wrong base can cause a mismatch, making alignment
impossible.
The software Quality Assessment allows the operator
to visualize quality graphs of the bases in the reads and
estimate the coverage based on means or medians, making it possible to select more precise cutoff parameters,
reducing the possibility of eliminating high-quality reads
or including low-quality reads, which increases the accuracy of the process of constructing genomes from second-generation sequencers.
