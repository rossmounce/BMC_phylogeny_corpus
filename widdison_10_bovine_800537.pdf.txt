abundance in mononuclear phagocytes

Abstract
Background: The chemokine and chemokine receptor families play critical roles in both the healthy and diseased
organism mediating the migration of cells. The chemokine system is complex in that multiple chemokines can
bind to one chemokine receptor and vice versa. Although chemokine receptors have been well characterised in
humans, the chemokine receptor repertoire of cattle is not well characterised and many sequences are yet to be
experimentally validated.
Results: We have identified and sequenced bovine homologs to all identified functional human chemokine
receptors. The bovine chemokine receptors show high levels of similarity to their human counterparts and similar
genome arrangements. We have also characterised an additional bovine chemokine receptor, not present in the
available genome sequence of humans or the more closely related pigs or horses. This receptor shows the highest
level of similarity to CCR1 but shows significant differences in regions of the protein that are likely to be involved
in ligand binding and signalling. We have also examined the mRNA abundance levels of all identified bovine
chemokine receptors in mononuclear phagocytic cells. Considerable differences were observed in the mRNA
abundance levels of the receptors, and interestingly the identified novel chemokine receptor showed differing
levels of mRNA abundance to its closest homolog CCR1. The chemokine receptor repertoire was shown to differ
between monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. This may reflect the differing roles of these cells in the
immune response and may have functional consequences for the trafficking of these cells in vivo.
Conclusions: In summary, we have provided the first characterisation of the complete bovine chemokine receptor
gene repertoire including a gene that is potentially unique to cattle. Further study of this receptor and its ligands
may reveal a specific role of this receptor in cattle. The availability of the bovine chemokine receptor sequences
will allow further characterisation of the function of these genes and will confer wide-reaching benefits to the
study of this important aspect of the bovine immune response.

Background
The chemokine system has been shown to play a crucial
role in both homeostasis, for example in lymphoid organogenesis and leukocyte maturation [1,2], and disease
mechanisms. The system is complex and relies on the
chemokine ligand binding to its chemokine receptor,
with additional complexity arising from the fact that
multiple chemokines can bind a single receptor and vice
versa. The distinction between roles in homoeostasis
and disease has been used as a means of functionally
classifying both chemokines and chemokine receptors,

although several chemokines have both homeostatic and
inflammatory functions [3]. Inflammatory chemokines
and their receptors have been demonstrated to have a
role in the immune response to a myriad of pathogens
both in humans and in other species. Homeostatic chemokines are generally constitutively expressed whereas
the inflammatory chemokines are up-regulated following
stimulation of the cell, for instance by cytokines or
pathogens. It has recently been demonstrated that many
of the inflammatory chemokines and their receptors
exist in clustered groups in the mammalian genome and
it is thought that these clustered chemokines have
evolved relatively recently in evolutionary terms [4,5].
These inflammatory, clustered chemokines also tend to

share functional properties, for example the CXCL chemokines, previously named Gro chemokines, are all capable of attracting neutrophils. This provides the
chemokine system with an inherent robustness whereby
the impairment of function in one chemokine can be
overcome through the deployment of a second chemokine with similar properties, a capability aided by the
inherent promiscuity of the chemokine system.
Both the chemokines and their receptors are grouped
into four families, CC, CXC, XC and CX3C chemokines,
depending on the location of C terminal cysteine residues in the chemokines with the receptors classified
based on the chemokine family they bind. The chemokine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors with a
conserved seven hydrophobic transmembrane structure
and an extracellular N-terminus and intracellular C-terminus. The C-terminus is known to be involved in signalling following binding of the ligand, however there
seems to be no consistent ligand binding mechanism.
The chemokines studied to date use various combinations of the N-terminus and different extracellular loops
of the transmembrane complex in order to bind the
receptor [6].
In humans the chemokine receptor system has been
well characterised. There are currently 18 known
human chemokine receptors; CCR1-10, CXCR1-6,
XCR1 and CX3CR1 [7] as well as other related receptors which bind chemokines but act as decoy receptors
[8]. The availability of the bovine genome [9,10] has
made it possible to begin to unravel the bovine chemokine and receptor system, however there are still areas
of the genome which are yet to be properly assembled
and at present many of the bovine homologs to the
chemokine receptors are based on predictions from the
genome sequence with no supporting experimental evidence. Experimentally confirmed sequences for bovine
chemokine receptors are currently available in the
public databases for CCR1 (NM_001077839), CCR4
(NM_001100293), CCR5 (NM_001011672), CCR7
(NM_001024930), CCR9 (NM_001098068), CXCR1
(EF597244), CXCR2 (NM_001101285), CXCR3
(NM_001011673), CXCR4 (NM_174301), CXCR5
(NM_001011675) and CXCR6 (NM_001014859). Cattle
may also have at least one chemokine receptor not
present in the human genome; C-C chemokine receptor type 1-like (NM_001075921).
In the case of the inflammatory chemokine receptors,
differences between cattle and human receptor repertoires may have significant effects on the immune
response. Following sequencing of the bovine genome,
several key differences between the human and bovine
immunome became apparent [9,10]. Firstly a newly discovered set of interferon (IFN) genes were identified
which have been provisionally called the IFNX genes.

Page 2 of 11

Cattle also seem to have more IFN genes generally than
other species, for example cattle have multiple copies of
IFNb and IFNΩ [11]. Ruminants are also known to possess a unique IFNT family which are thought to have a
role in pregnancy [12]. These differences between ruminants and other species may be due to major physiological differences in tissues such as the gut. The presence
of increased numbers of microorganisms within the gut
of ruminants renders them more susceptible to opportunistic infection. Cattle and other ruminants may therefore have evolved a more complex immune system to
deal with the increased threat both from a physiological
standpoint and due to the herd structure of these animals’ populations which increase the risk of animal to
animal transmission.
We present here a comprehensive investigation of the
bovine chemokine receptor repertoire and their mRNA
abundance by mononuclear phagocytes; macrophages
(M), dendritic cells (DC) and their precursors the
monocytes (Mo). These cells are crucial players in the
immune response to various pathogens and the chemokine receptors expressed by these cells will determine
their chemotactic migration within an animal. We also
report analysis of a chemokine receptor, CCR1L, which
may be unique to cattle.

Methods
Identification of chemokine receptor genes in the bovine
genome

The current bovine genome assembly Btau_4.0 available
at the ENSEMBL genome browser http://www.ensembl.
org was screened for bovine homologs to the 18 known
human chemokine receptors using BLAST. We also
screened available bovine sequences in the NCBI database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for homologous
sequences. The ENSEMBL browser was used as the
basis for the examination of synteny and for gene structure prediction.
Confirmation of bovine chemokine receptor cDNA
sequences

As many of the currently identified bovine chemokine
receptor sequences are predicted from the genome we
set out to confirm their full length coding sequences
(CDS). All receptors were amplified from cDNA produced from RNA extracted from Holstein Friesian cattle; CCR1, CCR1L, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR9, CCR10,
CXCR3, CXCR4 and CXCR6 were isolated from lysed
whole blood cells, CCR5 from blood-derived DC, CCR6
and CXCR5 from blood-derived B-cells, CCR7 and
CX3CR1 from blood-derived Mo, CCR8 from a spleen
tissue sample, CXCR1 and CXCR2 from a blood-derived
granulocyte/Mo preparation and CXCR6 and XCR1
from a lymph node tissue sample. Blood-derived cells;

Widdison et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:439
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/439

lysed whole blood cells, Mo, DC and Mo/granulocytes
were isolated as described previously [13,14], with the
exception that DC were cultured for seven days with a
media change after three days. For isolation of B-cells,
PBMC were prepared from blood [14], then B-cells were
isolated using the monoclonal antibody CC51, recognising the surface antigen CD21 [15], and anti-mouse
IgG2a+b MicroBeads (Milltenyi-Biotech, Camberley,
UK). RNA was isolated by lysing cells with 4 M guanidine thiocyanate followed by RNA extraction using the
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Tissue
samples were processed for RNA extraction as described
previously [16]. The quality and quantity of the RNA
were assessed using the Ultrospec 2100 pro spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Ltd., Chalfont St Giles, UK).
cDNA was prepared using Superscript II, Superscript III
(Invitrogen Ltd., Refrenshew, UK) or RevertAid H
Minus (Fermentas, York, UK) reverse transcriptases.
PCR amplification of full-length CDS of chemokine
receptors was carried out using GoTaq DNA polymerase
(Promega Co., Southampton, UK), Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen Ltd.) or the Expand High FidelityPLUS PCR
System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Primers used for amplification are shown in
Additional file 1; Supplemental Table S1. PCR products
were then cloned into TA cloning vectors; pCR2.1TOPO (Invitrogen Ltd.), pGEM-T Easy (Promega Co.)
or pDrive (Qiagen). Sequencing of inserts was performed using the using BigDye1 Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK)
on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems). Primers used for sequencing are shown in
Additional file 1; Supplemental Table S1. Sequence analysis was performed using the SequencherTM package
version 4.1.4 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor,
USA).
Phylogenetic analysis of identified bovine chemokine
receptors

The amino acid sequences of identified bovine chemokine receptors and available full length homologous
sequences from humans, sheep, pigs and horse were
aligned using ClustalW [17], and a phylogenetic tree
constructed using PHYLIP [18]. Evolutionary history
was inferred using the Maximum Parsimony (MP)
method, the percentage of replicate trees in which the
associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test
(500 replicates) are shown next to the branches.
Real-time PCR evaluation of bovine chemokine receptor
mRNA abundance in mononuclear phagocytes

Quantitative real-time PCR on triplicate samples was
carried out using TaqMan FAST Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) on an ABI

Page 3 of 11

Prism 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using 100 ng cDNA as the starting template.
Primers and probes used for real-time PCR analysis of
CCR1, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR1, CXCR2 and GAPDH have
previously been reported [19,20]. Primers and probes for
the other bovine chemokine receptors are given in Additional file 1; Supplemental Table S2. Amplification consisted of an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 20
seconds, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 seconds
and 60°C for 30 seconds. The transcript copy number
for a given gene was calculated by comparison with
plasmid standard curves containing known copy numbers of target genes. Relative mRNA abundance values
were then calculated according to the ‘Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression Experimental Design and
Analysis: Relative Standard Curve Method’ (Applied Biosystems Technical Bulletin: ‘Guide to Performing Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression Using Real-Time
Quantitative PCR’). For each target gene, mRNA abundance levels were normalised to the housekeeping gene
GAPDH according to the formula (Copy No. Target/
Copy No. GAPDH).
Statistical analysis of quantitative real-time PCR data

Analysis of data was carried out using Microsoft® Excel
2007 (Microsoft Co., Redmond, WA, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5.01 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San
Diego California USA, http://www.graphpad.com). Differences between groups were determined by repeated
measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison tests.

Results
Characterisation of bovine homologs to human
chemokine receptors

In the human system, ten CCR receptors (CCR1-10), six
CXCR receptors (CXCR1-6) and the unique XCR1 and
CX 3 CR1 receptors have been characterised. We were
able to identify bovine homologs to all of these receptors by bioinformatic analyses of available bovine
sequences and genome databases. We set out to confirm
identified genes by amplification of transcripts from
bovine mRNA. For the CCR- chemokine receptors,
sequences for CCR1, CCR4, CCR5, CCR7 and CCR9
have all been published however the other CCR-receptor
sequences are only predicted from the genome. For the
published CCR-chemokine receptor sequences we were
able to confirm the sequence data available, although
some synonymous differences were detected, likely due
to breed-specific differences. We did however, detect six
amino acid differences in CCR9 compared to the published sequence (NP_001091537) (Additional file 1;
Supplemental Figure S1). These were located in
the transmembrane regions and the extracellular

Widdison et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:439
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/439

carboxy- and intracellular amino-termini of the protein
and may also reflect breed-specific differences as the
available sequence data comes from a Hereford animal
whilst our data is from a Holstein Friesian animal.
Whether these amino acid changes would confer functional differences in the CCR9 receptor remains to be
determined. Our sequence for CCR9 has been submitted
to GenBank (GU936964).
We also confirmed coding sequences for the CCRchemokine receptors that are currently only available as
predicted sequences; CCR2, CCR3, CCR6, CCR8 and
CCR10. These have also been submitted to GenBank
(CCR2 - GU936960, CCR3 - GU936961, CCR6
-GU936962, CCR8 - GU936963, CCR10 - GU936965).
We detected synonymous nucleotide changes in CCR2
and CCR10 compared to the published sequences. CCR3
has two transcript variants in the NCBI database
(XM_869148, XM_589282) and one truncated transcript
in the ENSEMBL database (ENSBTAT00000001762).
The CCR3 sequence we amplified (GU936961) is identical to transcript variant 1. CCR6 has one transcript variant in the NCBI database (XM_597941) and three in
the ENSEMBL database (ENSBTAT00000037034,
ENSBTAT00000056219, ENSBTAT00000053991). The
sequence we identified (GU936962) was very similar to
the NCBI transcript except for one amino acid change
located in the second extracellular loop. Our CCR10
sequence (GU936965) is identical at the amino acid
level to the predicted sequence (XP_584874) however
minor differences exist at the nucleotide level.
Sequences for CXCR1-5 have previously been published. The sequences we detected mostly had synonymous differences compared to those published except
for CXCR5 (GU936966) which had three amino acid
changes compared to the published sequence
(NP_001011675); one in the extracellular amino-terminus, one in the second extracellular loop and one in the
intracellular carboxy-terminus. There are multiple
sequences available for CXCR6 in the NCBI database
(AAX08649, NP_001014859, AAX08913), and one in
the ENSEMBL database (ENSBTAG00000015708) which
is identical at the amino acid level to NP_001014859
although synonymous nucleotide differences are present
between the two sequences. All three sequences deposited in the NCBI database differ at the amino acid level
and our sequence (GU936967) is also different from
these. The sequences deposited in GenBank are all from
pooled samples which may account for the sequence differences seen. The sequence for XCR1 is currently only
predicted from the database (XM_870210). We amplified an XCR1 transcript (GU936968) which has one
amino acid change, compared to the predicted sequence,
in the second intracellular loop. Experimentally confirmed sequence has been published for CX 3 CR1

(AAI48891) but this is from a Hereford animal. Our
sequence (GU936969) differed from the published
sequence by three amino acids, located in the extracellular amino-terminus, the second transmembrane domain
and the fourth transmembrane domain. These are likely
to be breed-specific differences.
When compared to chemokine receptor sequences
from humans and more related species (Figure 1) the
bovine receptors generally group well with their homologs indicating a common evolutionary history for most
of the chemokine receptors. A significant exception
comes in the form of the two CXCL8 receptors, CXCR1
and CXCR2. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that for the
bovine and equine CXCR1 and CXCR2 sequences, the
two sequences are more closely related at the intraspecies level than to their designated homologs in other
species (Figure 1). As has been reported previously, this
is due to bovine CXCR1 and CXCR2 having identical
carboxy-termini, whereas in humans this intracellular
domain differs between the two receptors [21].
Characterisation of CCR1L, a chemokine receptor
potentially unique to cattle

During our search for bovine homologs of human chemokine receptors we identified an additional chemokine
receptor that was not present in humans. This receptor
was previously designated C-C chemokine receptor type
1-like (NM_001075921), henceforth abbreviated to
CCR1L. CCR1L is located adjacent to CCR1 in the
bovine genome and is most closely related to CCR1
when compared to all bovine chemokine receptors (Figure 1, 2), potentially representing a gene-duplication
event in cattle. SMART analysis [22,23] revealed the
existence of seven transmembrane domains, common to
all chemokine receptors. We also identified the characteristic DRY motif, located in the second intracellular
loop, which is required for activation [24,25]. By predicting the membrane topology of CCR1L and mapping the
amino acid differences onto this topology (Figure 2B) it
becomes apparent that the extracellular amino-termini
of CCR1L and CCR1 are identical, however the rest of
the protein, particularly the intracellular loops and the
intracellular carboxy-termini are markedly different.
There are four cysteine residues present in CCR1 which
have important roles in maintaining conformation,
ligand binding, signalling and trafficking of chemokine
receptors to the cell membrane [26,27]. In addition to
these conserved cysteines between CCR1 and CCR1L in
cattle, CCR1L has an additional cysteine in the third
extracellular loop and an additional pair of cysteines in
the intracellular tail (Figure 2B). Homologs to CCR1L
are not present in the available ENSEMBL pig or horse
genome assemblies and preliminary attempts to detect
CCR1L in water buffalo, sheep and goats were

methods.

unsuccessful (data not shown). It is therefore possible
that CCR1L represents a chemokine receptor unique to
cattle, however further investigations are required to
confirm this.
Chemokine receptor expression by bovine mononuclear
phagocytic cells

As little is known about the expression levels of bovine
chemokine receptors we set out to determine mRNA
abundance in a group of cells important in the immune
response, the mononuclear phagocytes. These cells,
which include the M, DC and their precursor cell the
Mo, are thought to express chemokine receptors during
both homeostasis and disease as a means of targeting to
sites of infection. Real-time PCR assays were developed
in order to measure the mRNA abundance of all identified bovine chemokine receptors in the three cell types
isolated from five animals. mRNA abundance levels of
the CCR-receptors were quite variable with some receptors, such as CCR1, being expressed at high levels when
compared to others such as CCR3 and CCR4 (Figure 3).
No CCR10 mRNA was detected for any of the mononuclear phagocytes, however mRNA was detected for
other bovine immune cells (data not shown). Some CCR
receptors, CCR1, CCR4, CCR7 and CCR9, were not
expressed differently between the cell types, whilst
others showed cell-specific levels of mRNA abundance.
mRNA abundance of the CXCR-, XCR- and CX 3 CRreceptors also showed considerable variability with
CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR6 and CX3CR1 showing
variability between the three cell types (Figure 4). Considering the receptors as a whole, differentiation of Mo
to M resulted in an increase in mRNA abundance for
CCR5 and a decrease in CCR2, CXCR2 and CX 3 CR1.
DC also showed higher levels of CCR5 mRNA

abundance than Mo and lower levels of CCR1L, CCR2,
CCR3, CCR6, CCR8, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and
CX 3 CR1. Comparing M and DC, M demonstrated
higher abundance of CCR1L, CCR2, CCR6, CCR8,
CXCR3, CXCR6 and CX3CR1.

Discussion
The chemokine receptors are thought to have originated
from a single ancestral gene with individual genes arising due to subsequent gene duplication events [28].
Many of the chemokine receptors are clustered across
the genome and these proximal chemokine receptors
also tend to be closely related. Generally the chemokine
receptor family is well conserved between mammalian
species, as can be seen by a comparison of the well-studied human and murine chemokine receptor genes,
however some differences do exist indicating ongoing
evolution of the chemokine receptor system. Here for
the first time, we have characterised the full complement of bovine homologs to known human chemokine
receptors and in doing so have also further characterised
an additional chemokine receptor not found in humans.
Generally the bovine chemokine receptors showed high
homology to their human counterparts and chromosomal organisation was well conserved. However, differences were identified when comparing the bovine and
human chemokine receptors. As reported previously, the
bovine CXCR1 and CXCR2 display a higher degree of
homology to each other than the human receptors, due
to the lack in cattle of a differing carboxy-terminal in
cattle as is found in humans [21]. Despite this, the two
bovine receptors seem to have similar functional

Widdison et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:439
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/439

properties to the human receptors. Without further
study the functional relatedness of the complete complement of human and bovine chemokine receptors cannot
be assumed however the high degree of sequence similarity between the receptors suggests many properties
may be shared between species. As expected, there was
also a high degree of similarity between the chemokine
receptors of cattle and those from other ruminants and
members of the Cetartiodactyla, although limited
sequence data are available for these species. There is a
significant difference between the XCR1 gene of pigs,
cattle and humans in that much of the 5’ un-translated
region of porcine XCR1 is shared with the first exon of
CCR1 [29]. In addition, horses have an extra CCR-chemokine receptor that seems to have formed as a result
of recombination between CCR2 and CCR5 [30].
One major difference between the bovine and human
chemokine receptor repertoire is in the presence of an
additional CCR-chemokine receptor, C-C chemokine
receptor type 1-like, here called CCR1L. This receptor is
located adjacent to CCR1 in the bovine genome and
may have arisen as a result of a gene duplication event
as indicated by phylogenetic analysis. CCR1L is not present in the genome sequences of humans, horses or pigs
and so this may represent a relatively recent evolutionary event, however whether CCR1L is unique to cattle is
at present unknown. Bovine CCR1 and CCR1L share
identical amino-termini however the remainder of the
sequence differs and overall the two sequences share
only 78% nucleotide identity , 66% amino acid identity
and 73% similarity. Whether the CCR1L receptor is
functional is not yet clear, however the gene is transcribed and analysis of transcriptional levels in mononuclear phagocytes revealed that CCR1L is also
transcribed differently to CCR1 in these cells. CCR1L
also possesses a number of features characteristic of
functional chemokine receptors including the DRY
motif, which is lacking in the non-signalling receptors
D6 and DARC [31], and the NPXXY motif in transmembrane region 7 which is thought to be important
for G protein-coupled receptor activation [32]. We also
identified cysteines in the extracellular loops of CCR1L
which are critical for normal chemokine receptor function [26,27]. Unusually, CCR1L has two cysteine residues in the third extracellular loop. The additional
cysteine in the third extracellular loop may bind to the
extracellular amino-terminus as cysteines in this region
are known to form disulphide bridges with the aminoterminus [27]. However without further study the functional significance of these two cysteine residues in the
third extra-cellular loop is unknown. Although not present in CCR1, most other chemokine receptors also
have cysteine residues in their carboxy-termini. These
cysteines, normally located 12-25 amino acids from the

Page 8 of 11

transmembrane region as found for CCR1L, are suggested to be palmitoylated, particularly when surrounded by clusters of amino acids that are hydrophobic
and positively charged as for CCR1L [33]. These
cysteines effectively anchor the intracellular carboxy-terminus to the plasma membrane and hence create a
fourth intracellular loop (Figure 2). For CCR5 it is has
been shown that palmitoylation is essential for transport
to the plasma membrane and for downstream signalling
activation and may also be required for phosphorylation
of the receptor [34-36].
At present the ligands, if any, for CCR1L are unknown
however we can begin to speculate about possible
ligands based on sequence similarity at the important
binding regions of the chemokine receptors. The amino
termini of CCR1 and CCR1L in cattle are identical and
it has been shown by chimera studies that this domain
in human CCR1 confers a degree of ligand specificity
[37] thus it could be speculated that CCR1 and CCR1L
bind the same ligands. However, full activation of CCR1
seems to require additional sites, in particular CCL3 has
been shown to interact with CCR1 at the second extracellular domain. CCR1L and CCR1 differ considerably
in this region suggesting that there may be differences
in ligand binding between the two receptors. Without
further study it is impossible to know exactly which
ligands bind CCR1L, however given the restriction of
CCR1L to cattle and possibly other related species it is
interesting to note that cattle have a unique CC-chemokine, regakine, which seems to synergise with CXCL8 to
increase neutrophil migration but for which no receptor
has currently been identified [38,39]. It is therefore possible that CCR1L and regakine represent a chemokine:
receptor pairing that is absent from humans but present
in cattle and potentially other ruminants. Given the
importance of chemokines in the immune response, the
restriction of CCR1L and regakine to cattle may relate
to the differing immune requirements of humans and
cattle.
There are several papers reporting the chemokine receptor repertoire of mononuclear phagocytic cells and the
changes in their expression during maturation from Mo to
antigen-presenting cells in humans. Mo have been shown
varyingly to express CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, CCR7, CCR8,
CXCR1, CXCR2 and CX3CR1 [40-48] which aid in their
dissemination from the bone marrow into the tissues.
Upon maturation to M, Mo down-regulate CCR2 and
increase expression of CCR1 and CCR5 [46,49]. DC have
been shown to express a range of chemokine receptors
however the expression level depends on the maturation
state of the cell. Immature DC express a range of receptors
for the inflammatory chemokines including CCR1,
CCR2, CCR5, CCR6 and CXCR1 which guide the cell to
sites of inflammation however maturation results in a

Widdison et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:439
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/439

down-regulation of many of these receptors and an up-regulation of receptors for constitutive chemokines such as
CCR7 and CXCR4 [44,45]. This then allows the DC to traffic back to the lymph node in order to present antigen to
T-cells. The down-regulation of CCR1 and CCR5 has been
shown to be due to the release of chemokines by the DC,
which CCR7 is resistant to [50]. Many of the receptors
may only be functional under certain conditions, for example mononuclear phagocytes have been shown only to
respond to CXCL8 following appropriate cytokine stimulation [51]. In the bovine system we were only able to assess
expression levels at the mRNA level as no antibodies are
currently available for bovine chemokine receptors. Studies
in humans have revealed that for some chemokine receptors functional receptor levels are reflected at the mRNA
level, for example the down-regulation of CCR2 and the
up-regulation of CCR1 and CCR5 during the maturation
of Mo to M [46]. However for other chemokine receptors, such as the observed down-regulation in CCR1 and
CCR5 by maturing DC, this was shown to be due to the
redistribution of the receptor to an endocytic compartment
rather than an actual change in total protein levels [50].
Despite our inability to measure protein levels, the mRNA
abundance levels provide a useful insight into the chemokine receptor repertoire of bovine cells. At the mRNA level
we were able to confirm the down-regulation of CCR2 and
up-regulation of CCR5 seen in human cells upon maturation of Mo to M, and in addition demonstrated the
down-regulation in transcription of CXCR2 and CX3CR1.
For DC we were only able to detect higher levels of CCR5
compared to Mo but demonstrated the down-regulation of
a number of receptors including CCR2, CCR6 and CXCR1
which have been shown to be down-regulated upon
maturation of human DC.

Conclusions
In conclusion we present here for the first time a complete characterisation of the bovine chemokine receptor
system. The bovine system shows many similarities to
the well-characterised human and murine systems, with
a couple of exceptions. Firstly, as reported previously,
the CXCR1 and CXCR2 of cattle are much more closely
related than those of humans and so may exhibit functional differences to the human receptors. Secondly, cattle possess the gene for an additional chemokine
receptor not present in humans. This receptor shows
some homology to CCR1 but possesses some amino
acid differences that could result in the receptor differing in ligand binding or signalling to CCR1. We have
also determined the mRNA abundance of all identified
bovine chemokine receptors in mononuclear phagocytic
cells and demonstrated similar trends in chemokine
receptor repertoire to those in humans. The availability
of chemokine receptor sequences will hopefully fuel the

production of antibodies to these important immune
modulators and allow more extensive characterisation of
the bovine chemokine system. Further study of speciesrestricted chemokines and receptors may also reveal a
facet of the chemokine system that is unique to cattle
and other closely related species.
