Abstract
Background: Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), a central component of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling, has major effects on innate immunity and inflammation. Mice lacking Tyk2 are
resistant to endotoxin shock induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and Tyk2 deficient macrophages fail to efficiently
induce interferon α/β after LPS treatment. However, how Tyk2 globally regulates transcription of downstream target
genes remains unknown. Here we examine the regulatory role of Tyk2 in basal and inflammatory transcription by
comparing gene expression profiles of peritoneal macrophages from Tyk2 mutant and wildtype control mice that were
either kept untreated or exposed to LPS for six hours.
Results: Untreated Tyk2-deficient macrophages exhibited reduced expression of immune response genes relative to
wildtype, in particular those that contain interferon response elements (IRF/ISRE), whereas metabolic genes showed
higher expression. Upon LPS challenge, IFN-inducible genes (including those with an IRF/ISRE transcription factor
binding-site) were strongly upregulated in both Tyk2 mutant and wildtype cells and reached similar expression levels.
In contrast, metabolic gene expression was strongly decreased in wildtype cells upon LPS treatment, while in Tyk2
mutant cells the expression of these genes remained relatively unchanged, which exaggerated differences already
present at the basal level. We also identified several 5'UR transcription factor binding-sites and 3'UTR regulatory
elements that were differentially induced between Tyk2 deficient and wildtype macrophages and that have not
previously been implicated in immunity.
Conclusions: Although Tyk2 is essential for the full LPS response, its function is mainly required for baseline expression
but not LPS-induced upregulation of IFN-inducible genes. Moreover, Tyk2 function is critical for the downregulation of
metabolic genes upon immune challenge, in particular genes involved in lipid metabolism. Together, our findings
suggest an important regulatory role for Tyk2 in modulating the relationship between immunity and metabolism.

e.g. macrophages and dendritic cells [1]. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense microbial products and initiate a cascade of signaling events to alert the immune defense.
Members of the TLR family recognize a range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns produced by bacteria,
protozoa, fungi, or viruses [2,3]. One of the best studied
examples for a pathogen associated pattern is bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Binding of LPS to the TLR4
complex of the host activates two signaling cascades via
different adaptor proteins leading to the activation of two

Results
Effects of Tyk2 and LPS on gene expression

To determine the effects of Tyk2 and LPS on gene expression we used CodeLink Mouse Whole Genome Arrays on
mRNA isolated from Wt (C57BL/6) and Tyk2-/- (on a
C57BL/6 background) macrophages, either stimulated
with LPS for six hours or kept untreated. After filtering
and quality control, we retained 7546 genes for statistical
and bioinformatic analysis (see Methods).
At the basal level, in the absence of LPS stimulation, we
found that 428 (6%) of 7546 genes analyzed were differentially expressed between Wt and Tyk2-/- macrophages
(effect of genotype, Figure 1A; full dataset available at
Gene Expression Omnibus http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/, GEO accession number GSE19733). Among the
genes with the largest expression differences between
genotypes, many are known to be involved in immune
function. The majority of these genes was downregulated

main transcription factors: NFκB, a key transcription factor regulating pro-inflammatory genes, and interferon
(IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which induces IRF3responsive genes, most prominently IFNβ. IFNβ and
other cytokines subsequently act in an autocrine/paracrine manner to induce the expression of immune
responsive genes [4,5].
A major component of IFNα/β signaling is Tyrosine
kinase 2 (Tyk2), a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family [6]. Activated JAKs phosphorylate members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
family, which mediate signals from a large number of
cytokines and growth factors [7,8]. Activation of JAK1
and Tyk2 by IFNα/β stimulation leads to a series of phosphorylation events, causing the formation of IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complexes that consist of
STAT1, STAT2 and IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). Subsequently, ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus and binds to
a specific transcription factor binding-site (TFBS), the
IFN stimulated response element (IRF/ISRE), which in
turn activates transcription of several hundred IFNresponsive genes. To a lesser extent, these signaling
events also lead to the formation of STAT1 and STAT3
homo- and heterodimers that bind another TFBS, the
IFNγ activated sequence (GAS TFBS) [9].
In mice, Tyk2 is only partially required for IFNα/β signaling, where it mainly serves to amplify the immune
response [10,11]. We and others have previously shown a
surprisingly low susceptibility of Tyk2 knockout mice to
LPS-induced endotoxin shock, despite normal production of proinflammatory cytokines (the interleukins IL6,
IL1B) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) [12,13]. In
vitro, Tyk2 mutant peritoneal macrophages fail to efficiently induce IFNα/β and nitric oxide (NO) production
upon LPS treatment. In addition, Tyk2 deficiency influences the basal level of several IFN-responsive genes
[10,12]. However, despite the importance of Tyk2 in
mediating immune and inflammatory responses, how
this JAK regulates global transcription of downstream
target genes remains largely unknown.
Here we compare the genome-wide expression profiles
of Tyk2 mutant and wildtype mouse peritoneal macrophages with and without activation by LPS using
microarrays. In particular, we focus on IFN-responsive
genes and their putative regulators and use bioinformatic
analysis to examine how the observed changes in gene
expression relate to gene ontology categories and cis-regulatory elements (i.e., 5'UR TFBSs and 3'UTR elements)
[14]. We find that Tyk2 is essential for mediating the full
LPS response and for baseline expression of IFN-inducible genes, but not for the LPS-induced upregulation of
IFN-responsive genes. Moreover, we show that LPS challenge suppresses the expression of genes involved in

in Tyk2-/- relative to Wt cells, including for example
IFNγ- inducible protein 47 (IFI47), IFN regulatory factor
7 (IRF7), and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase-like genes 1
and 2 (OASL1, OASL2), as well as three out of five
(STAT1, IRF1, and IRF7) IFN-responsive genes shown in
Figure 2.
Consistent with this, gene ontology (GO) analysis
showed that gene classes involved in immunity were significantly downregulated in Tyk2-/- relative to Wt cells
(Table A1A). Interestingly, genes belonging to metabolic
gene classes showed higher expression in Wt relative to
Tyk2-/-, including genes in the classes "metabolism",
"lipid biosynthesis", "sterol biosynthesis", and "cholesterol
biosynthesis" (Table A1A). Overall, we observed a small
but significant shift in gene expression towards lower values in Tyk2-/- cells, suggesting the involvement of the
majority of metabolic genes in this shift (Figure 3A). This
relatively small but consistent effect can also be seen at
the level of individual genes, for example for the lipid
genes shown in Figure 2. Thus, in macrophages, Tyk2 is
not only required for basal expression of immune genes
but also for the maintenance of metabolic genes at a low
level of expression in an uninduced state.
In contrast to the relatively small number of differences
in baseline expression between Wt and mutant cells, LPS
treatment changed the transcriptional status of Wt macrophages dramatically: 3622 genes (48%) were either upor downregulated upon exposure to LPS, including many
genes involved in immunity (effect of LPS treatment, Figure 1B; GEO accession number GSE19733). This massive
change in transcriptional status is also reflected in the
large distance between the observed curve and the curve
showing the theoretical expectation in Figure 1B. Among
the genes upregulated by LPS, several are known to also
be induced by cytokines, chemokines, or cellular stressors, including the interleukins IL1A, IL1B, IL12A, the
IFN stimulated gene ISG20, and TNFα, as well as all five
IFN-responsive genes shown in Figure 2. In contrast,
genes involved in lipid metabolism were typically downregulated in Wt cells (see Figures 2 and 3B). Similar to the
situation at the basal level, this downward shift in expression involved almost all genes (Figure 3B).
In total, LPS treatment influenced 19 GO classes, with
strong upregulation of genes involved in inflammatory
responses and chemotaxis and downregulation of genes
involved in metabolism, indicating a negative relationship
between immune response and metabolism (Table B1B;
see Figure 3B for metabolic genes). In Tyk2 mutant cells,
however, only 2297 genes (30%) were influenced by LPS,
suggesting that Tyk2-/- cells respond overall much less to
LPS than Wt cells (GEO accession number GSE19733).
The observation that Tyk2-/- macrophages might
exhibit an impaired LPS response was confirmed when
we analyzed differences in how genotypes react to LPS

challenge: 1202 genes (16%) showed a difference in LPS
induction between Wt and Tyk2 mutant (effect of genotype × treatment interaction, Figure 1C, GEO accession
number GSE19733). For example, among the differentially induced immune genes, LPS caused a much weaker
induction of the interferon-stimulated protein ISG20 and
the NO synthase NOS2 in Tyk2-/- than in Wt cells, but a
stronger induction of IFI47 and IRF7 relative to Wt (Figure 2).
Overall, we found that eleven classes of genes were differentially induced by LPS between genotypes, including
weaker upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis and
negative cell cycle control and weaker suppression of
metabolic gene expression in Tyk2-/- relative to Wt cells
(Table C1C; see Figures 2 and 3C for metabolic genes).
Again, we found that this downward shift in gene expression involved the majority of all genes (Figure 3C). Most
notably, genes involved in "cholesterol biosynthesis", "sterol biosynthesis", "steroid biosynthesis", and "lipid biosynthesis" were much less strongly suppressed upon LPS
challenge in Tyk2-/- than in Wt macrophages. Metabolic
genes were therefore downregulated by LPS in Wt cells,
but their expression levels remained closer to the basal,
uninduced state in Tyk2-/- macrophages. RT-qPCR
broadly confirmed the effects of Tyk2 on immune and
metabolic genes (Additional File 1). Thus, Tyk2 is
required for LPS-induced upregulation of immune and
other genes and for the suppression of metabolic genes
upon LPS challenge (also see Additional File 1).
Transcription factor binding-sites

The expression of the about 25,000 genes in mammalian
genomes is regulated by many fewer transcription and
other regulatory factors. We therefore related our
microarray expression data to information on TFBSs
upstream of the transcription start site [14]. Since TFBSs
are often short and relatively uninformative, and because
many putative TFBSs are biologically irrelevant, we
extracted sequences from the 5' upstream region (5'UR)
that are conserved between human and mouse, as such
phylogenetic conservation might indicate functional
importance in transcriptional control. This bioinformatics analysis identified 174 classes of putative 5'UR TFBSs.
At the basal level, only genes that contain the IRF/ISRE
TFBS were differentially regulated between genotypes;
genes with GAS elements showed no significant difference between genotypes (Figure 4A, Table A2A, Additional File 2). Since the IRF/ISRE element is responsive to
the ISGF3 complex, genes containing such an element are
likely candidate targets of IFNα/β signaling. Tyk2-/- macrophages had on average an approximately 1.4 times
reduced expression of genes with an IRF/ISRE TFBS as
compared to Wt cells (Figure 4A, Table A2A, Additional
File 2). Unlike the situation for metabolic genes, this dif-

unknown transcription factors. Similar to the baseline
differences in expression between genotypes, genes with
the IRF/ISRE TFBS (e.g., gram negative binding protein 3
(GNBP3), cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274), and
IL15RA) were strongly upregulated after six hours of LPS
treatment. These genes were followed by an uncharacterized class of genes, either with CHX10 TFBS (e.g., β-site
APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the 14-3-3 gene Stratifin, the Myc associated factor X (MAX), and CD38) or
containing homeodomain transcription factor IPF1/
PDX1 motifs (e.g., Stratifin, the tripartite motif gene
TRIM21, and the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp281).
To our knowledge, neither CHX10 TFBS nor IPF1/PDX1
motifs have previously been implicated in the LPS
response. Genes containing a TATA box were also significantly upregulated upon LPS exposure (especially the
LIM homeodomain factor LHX4 and TNFα). Furthermore, we found evidence for weak upregulation of genes
with conserved NF-AT motifs (Table B2B), with AP-1/
Jun and c-REL consensus sequences (using a significance
level of α = 0.01 - see Methods for definition of cutoff criteria; Additional File 2), and with NFκB motifs (using α =

0.05; Additional File 2). Interestingly, we failed to observe
LPS-induced downregulation of any gene class (either
using FDR = 0.05 or α = 0.01 as cutoffs; Table B2B, Additional File 2).
Six classes of genes differed in their induction by LPS
between genotypes, and for all these classes induction by
LPS was lower in Tyk2-/- than in Wt cells (Table C2C,
Additional File 2). Genes containing the pituitary-specific
transcription factor POU1F1 motif showed the most pronounced differences in mean expression, whereas genes
with a IPF1/PDX1 motif (especially Stratifin) or a TATA
box (especially LHX4 and NOS2) showed the highest statistical significance (Table C2C, Additional File 2). However, despite these genotypic differences in inducibility,
LPS induced on average similar expression of genes with
an IRF/ISRE TFBS in Wt and Tyk2-/- macrophages (Figure 4C, Table C2C, Additional File 2). Upon LPS challenge, Wt and Tyk2-/- cells therefore reached
qualitatively and quantitatively similar expression levels
of genes that contain the IRF/ISRE TFBS. These results
suggest that Tyk2 is functionally required for the baseline
expression of genes with an IRF/ISRE TFBS, but dispensable for their LPS-induced upregulation.
Since the above analysis of IRF/ISRE TFBSs was based
on very stringent criteria and thus likely to miss many
known IFN-inducible genes (see Methods), we also produced a list of 187 IFN-responsive genes from the literature and asked how many of those genes showed
expression changes in our microarray experiment and
contain IRF/ISRE or GAS TFBSs.
After filtering of lowly expressed genes, 137 genes
remained in the analysis. At the basal level, we found that
this class of IFN-inducible genes was on average downregulated relative to all other genes in Tyk2-/- versus Wt
macrophages (Additional File 3). While the mean expression ratios relative to Wt were quite small, the average
difference was caused by a few genes of large effect, with
23 genes being significantly differentially expressed
(Additional File 3). The genes that showed the largest
expression differentials were IRF7, IFN-inducible proteins 1 and 205 (IFI1, IFI205), and transporter associated
with Ag processing 1 (TAP1), thereby confirming that
Tyk2 is required for baseline expression of IFN-inducible
genes. Upon LPS stimulation, IFN-inducible genes were
on average much more strongly upregulated than other
genes (74 genes in Wt; Additional File 3). Again, this pattern was mainly caused by a few genes with extreme
effects, including IL1B, chemokine (C-C motif ) ligands 2
and 7 (CCL2, CCL7), and chemokine (C-X-C motif )
ligand 2 (CXCL2). As in our analysis of genes with the
IRF/ISRE TFBS, the average induction of IFN-inducible
genes by LPS was similar between Tyk2-/- and Wt macrophages, with both cell types reaching qualitatively identical expression levels (Additional File 3). To validate

We assigned genes to 174 classes of putative TFBSs, either identified by their name, the major transcription factor binding to them, or their
number in Xie et al. [14]. The table shows the number of genes in each TFBS class, approximate mean expression ratios (ER), mean normed

these microarray results we performed RT-qPCR on nine
IFN-inducible genes and found a good agreement with
respect to approximate fold induction (Additional File 1).
IFN-responsive genes contained significantly more
IRF/ISRE and GAS TFBSs than other genes, although
enrichment was only modest for the latter. The criteria of

inclusion, i.e. the length of the 5'UR and the counting of
only TFBSs conserved between human and mouse influenced the results considerably. As expected, conservation
of TFBSs among species decreased the number of false
positives, whereas a long 5'UR stretch or no conservation
increased it (Additional File 3).

3' UTR regulatory elements

As mRNA levels are not only known to be regulated by
5'UR TFBSs, but also post-transcriptionally by regulatory
elements in the 3'untranslated region (UTR), we were
interested in relating the observed expression differences
to putative 3'UTR regulatory sequences. We focused on
two not mutually exclusive classes of regulatory
sequences: (i) conserved 3'UTR motifs and (ii) 3'UTR
microRNA (miRNA) cognate sequences.
To examine motifs in the 3'UTR we analyzed our data
with respect to 175 classes of conserved putative 3'UTR
regulatory sequences defined by Xie et al. [14] (Table 3,
Additional File 4). As compared to 5'UR TFBSs, we found
many more gene classes to be differentially expressed
(Table 3, Additional File 4). This might simply be due to a
larger number of genes containing specific 3'UTR motifs
than 5'UR TFBSs. Alternatively, 3'UTR elements might
be more conserved, or easier to detect, than 5'UR TFBSs.
We observed four classes of motifs that were differentially
regulated between genotypes at the basal level (Table

A3A), 37 that were up- or downregulated after LPS treatment in Wt (Table B3B), and three that showed differences in LPS inducibility between genotypes (Table C3C).
Genes with AU-rich elements (m2/ARE) were the most
significantly upregulated upon LPS treatment (Table B3B,
Additional File 5). Similar to what we observed for IFNresponsive genes or those with IRF/ISRE TFBSs, this pattern was mainly caused by a few genes with extreme
effects on expression, such as IL1A, IL1B, CXCL2, and
TNFα, which were among the most responsive genes
(GEO accession number GSE19733). In contrast, LPS
caused downregulation of a large class of genes containing poly-A signal (m1/poly-A) motifs (Table B3B). However, genes with m2/ARE or m1/poly-A motifs neither
differed in baseline expression, nor in LPS inducibility
between Wt and Tyk2-/- macrophages.
A special class of 3'UTR regulatory elements important
in the regulation of gene expression are the targets of
miRNAs, short single-stranded RNA molecules consisting of 21-24 nucleotides. To analyze miRNA cognate
motifs we related known miRNAs from miRBase http://
www.mirbase.org/[15-17] to the octameric sequences in
[14]. Using this approach, we were able to uniquely define
different cognate 3'UTR sequences (which might otherwise have been lumped into a single class in the analysis
above). Out of 111 such sequences, we found three
miRNA cognate motif classes to be differentially
expressed at the basal level, three classes to be influenced
by LPS in Wt cells, and three classes to differ in their LPS
inducibility between genotypes (Additional File 6). As far
as we know, none of these miRNA motifs has been previously implicated in the IFN or LPS response. However,
since conserved 3'UTR elements and miRNA consensus
sites are still poorly characterized, it is difficult to functionally interpret these results. Nonetheless, our observations provide strong evidence for an involvement of such
regulatory sequences in the LPS response of Wt and
Tyk2-/- macrophages.

Discussion
In this microarray study we have investigated the role of
the JAK protein kinase family member Tyk2 in basal and
LPS-induced gene expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages. While several previous studies have demonstrated that Tyk2 is an important regulator of immune
and inflammatory responses [10,12,18], here we show
how Tyk2 globally affects genome-wide transcript levels.
At the basal uninduced level, we found subtle but significant differences in gene expression between Wt and
Tyk2-/- macrophages. Relative to Wt, Tyk2-deficient
macrophages displayed reduced expression of many
immune genes, in particular some genes that contain IFN
response elements (IRF/ISRE) in their 5'UR, suggesting
that Tyk2 deficiency compromises the type I IFN (i.e.,

A total of 175 3'UTR motis were identified as described in Xie et al. [14]. The table shows the number of genes in each class of motif,

IFNα/β) response. This observation confirms previous
findings demonstrating that IFNα/β signaling is reduced
in Tyk2-/- mice and that IFNα4 and IFNβ mRNA levels
are diminished in Tyk2 null macrophages at the basal
level [10-12].
In addition to the ISGF3 complex, type I IFNs also activate STAT1 homodimers, which induce gene expression
via IFNγ activated sequence (GAS) elements. Furthermore, STAT1 homodimers are strongly activated by
IFNγ, whose production and signaling is partially
impaired in the absence of Tyk2 [10-12]. It is still controversial whether macrophages can produce significant
amounts of biologically active IFNγ [19], however, cells
might have been exposed to IFNγ during the generation
procedure. We were therefore interested to determine if
genes containing GAS TFBSs are also influenced by the
absence of Tyk2. In contrast to the involvement of IRF/
ISRE TFBS in the Tyk2 mediated response, we failed to
find evidence for differential expression of genes containing GAS elements. Since the mouse genome contains
very many such elements, not all of which are involved in
gene regulation, it is possible that our bioinformatic analysis failed to find those GAS elements that are biologically relevant. Thus, while in our study reduced baseline
expression of immunity related and IFN-responsive genes
in Tyk2-deficient macrophages seems to be mainly mediated by IRF/ISRE TFBSs, the role of Tyk2 in GAS-driven
gene regulation deserves further investigation.
We also found that Tyk2 is required for the full
response of genes upon LPS challenge, as expected based
on previous experiments [10,12]. LPS challenge affected
the expression of about 48% of all genes in Wt cells,
including many immune genes, but influenced only about
30% of all genes in Tyk2-/- cells. Consequently, Tyk2-deficient macrophages failed to induce many LPS-responsive
transcripts, in particular immunity related genes. Surprisingly, however, IFN-responsive genes did not follow
this trend: LPS challenge increased the expression of IFNinducible genes to a similar extent in Wt and Tyk2-/macrophages, suggesting that Tyk2 might not be critical

for LPS-induced upregulation of IFN-responsive genes.
Thus, although previous observations have found
reduced levels of IFNα4 and IFNβ in Tyk2-/- macrophages [12], a high proportion of LPS-induced type I
IFN signaling might be largely independent of Tyk2.
Several previous studies have examined IFN mediated
immune and inflammatory transcription in bone marrow
derived mouse macrophages (BMDMs) using microarrays [20,21]. Thomas et al. [20] studied Wt and IFNβ-/cells at the basal level and after one and three hours of
LPS treatment using Affymetrix microarrays. Many
genes whose baseline levels were reduced by lack of IFNβ
also had significantly lower levels in Tyk2-/- cells in our
experiment. The overall correlation between expression
differences for IFNβ-/- vs. Wt [20] and Tyk2-/- vs. Wt
(our study) was r = 0.41 (see Additional File 7). Hence, the
effect of IFNβ deficiency on baseline gene expression is
similar to the lack of Tyk2. Thomas et al. [20] also identified many LPS-induced genes in Wt that we found to be
induced in our study (overall correlation r = 0.48 - see
Additional File 7). However, while IFNβ-/- macrophages
showed an impaired LPS response for many IFN dependent genes [20], induction of these genes by LPS was generally unimpaired in Tyk2-/- macrophages in our
experiment. A comparison of LPS inducibility between
IFNβ-/- and Tyk2-/- macrophages only revealed a weak
correlation of r = 0.03 (Additional File 7). Tyk2 therefore
seems to be required for basal expression of IFNβ target
genes but not for their induction by LPS. In another
microarray study by Fleetwood et al. [21], genes whose
basal expression levels depend on intact type I IFN signaling were characterized in BMDMs, either cultivated in
the presence of macrophage colony stimulating factor
(M-CSF, or CSF1) or granulocyte macrophage colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Most genes that were
downregulated in IFNAR1-/- genotypes in both M-CSF
and GM-CSF BMDMs were also decreased in Tyk2-/- relative to Wt cells in our experiment (Additional File 8),
thus confirming our observation that Tyk2 is involved in
basal IFNα/β signaling. Furthermore, the effects of basal

Vogl et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:199
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/199

type I IFN signaling on gene expression in the thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages used in our study
were similar to those observed in the BMDMs used in
[20] and [21].
Interestingly, our study also provides evidence for a
previously unknown role of Tyk2 in regulating metabolism. Tyk2 mutant macrophages showed enhanced baseline expression of metabolic genes relative to Wt cells,
including genes involved in steroid, sterol, and lipid
metabolism. Upon LPS treatment, metabolic gene
expression was strongly decreased in Wt macrophages,
while in Tyk2-/- macrophages expression of these genes
remained relatively unchanged. Thus, the differential LPS
response of Wt versus mutant macrophages increased
differences in gene expression already present at the basal
level: the relatively low expression of metabolic genes in
Wt cells was strongly suppressed by LPS, whereas in
Tyk2-/- cells LPS suppressed the relatively high expression of metabolic genes much less. This effect pertained
to most genes in the GO class "metabolism", and in particular to genes belonging to the classes "cholesterol biosynthesis", "sterol biosynthesis", "steroid biosynthesis",
and "fatty acid metabolism" Taken together, these results
suggest an involvement of Tyk2 in the regulation of general metabolism and of lipid metabolism in particular.
Tyk2 might thus be an important mediator of the connection between immunity and metabolism.
Two not mutually exclusive mechanisms might account
for the effects of Tyk2 on metabolic gene expression. On
the one hand, Tyk2/IFN signaling might directly lead to
decreased metabolism, possibly because upregulation of
immune function shuts down other energetically
demanding processes [22,23]. On the other hand, Tyk2
might exhibit pleiotropic effects on immunity and metabolism that are largely independent: a canonical IFN signaling function of Tyk2 might be associated with an
independent role in metabolic regulation. Potentially
consistent with either model, we observed that LPS treatment of macrophages reduces the expression of mitochondrial genes and that this downregulation is impaired
in Tyk2-/- cells relative to Wt (GO annotation "cellular
component", GO class "mitochondrion"; results not
shown). Remarkably, dysfunctional mitochondrial respiration has been shown for Tyk2-deficient pro-B cells [24].
In a similar vein, Pitroda et al. [25] found that STAT1
knockdown is associated with alterations in the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, including
glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and the citrate
cycle. Tyk2/IFN signaling might thus regulate metabolism by targeting mitochondrial processes via STAT1.
Notably, we observed a particularly pervasive effect of
Tyk2 on lipid and fatty acid metabolism in macrophages.
This result fits well with previous studies that have
reported intricate but not well understood interactions

Page 14 of 19

between immunity, inflammation, and lipid metabolism
[for reviews see [21,22]]. For example, lipids can be
sensed by and act on Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as
TLR4, probably because TLR agonists like LPS contain a
biologically active lipid moiety [see [23]]. Moreover, macrophages and adipocytes are derived from a common
ancestral progenitor and share several transcriptional features, with macrophages expressing some adipocyte specific genes and adipocytes expressing several macrophage
specific genes, including IL6 and TNFα [see [23], and references therein]. However, little is currently understood
about the downstream effects of impaired IFN signaling
on lipid metabolism, as we have observed them in our
experiments.
Although the biological details remain unclear, several
studies have established a link between IFN signaling,
innate immunity, and lipid metabolism. Mice deficient for
interleukin 1 receptor antagonist α (IL1Ra), for instance,
are lean, have impaired body fat accumulation, and
exhibit reduced lipoprotein lipase activity [26], and TNFα
can increase lipolysis and promote apoptosis of adipocytes [27]. Moreover, Zwaferink et al. [28] have recently
reported that key lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid
synthase (FASN), are suppressed in IFNβ treated mouse
BMDMs. Since we have observed a similar downregulation in Tyk2 mutant macrophages, and because Tyk2
deficiency is known to decrease IFNβ levels [12], it might
be possible that Tyk2 influences lipid metabolism
through a basal feed-forward loop between IFNβ and
Tyk2.
Our findings are also consistent with our previous
observation that Tyk2 modulates metabolic proteins in
BMDMs before and after LPS treatment [29]. However, it
remains possible that isolated mouse macrophages display somewhat abnormal metabolic behavior. We found
most metabolic genes to be suppressed upon LPS treatment in Wt macrophages, but in vivo results suggest that
Wt mice become hypermetabolic ninety minutes after
LPS injection [30]. Thus, future studies will need to
examine the detailed role of Tyk2 in regulating metabolism, both in macrophages and other cell types as well as
in vivo.
In addition to the IRF/ISRE TFBS already mentioned
above, our study also identified several other TFBSs that
might be involved in the immune and inflammatory
response. In particular, we found several genes with 5'UR
binding-sites for transcription factors that have not yet
been implicated in immunity. For example, some genes
with a TATA box were upregulated by LPS. Unfortunately, we cannot decipher this "regulatory code" in mammals with current bioinformatics means, although it
might be conserved over quite large phylogenetic distances [31]. We also observed five known and one
unknown TFBS to be correlated with induction differ-

Vogl et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:199
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/199

ences between Wt and Tyk2-/- cells. While further analysis will be required to examine the effect of these motifs,
we generally observed similar GO classes to be upregulated after six hours of LPS as Nilsson et al. [32] who
studied the expression of genes and gene regulation via
5'UR TFBS in BMDMs after seven hours of LPS stimulation.
Finally, we related our results to information on putative 3'UTR elements. We found many more genes per
3'UTR element than per 5'UR TFBS, possibly because the
3'UTR is evolutionarily more conserved than the 5'UR or
because regulation at the 3'UTR is more pleiotropic than
at the 5'UR. Overall, our results provide strong evidence
for the involvement of 3'UTR elements in the LPS
response and in the differential regulation of expression
between genotypes. Several classes of conserved 3'UTR
regulatory sequences and 3'UTR miRNA cognate
sequences were differentially regulated between genotypes, in response to LPS, and in terms of LPS inducibility
between Wt and Tyk2 mutant cells. Most notably, LPS
strongly induced expression of genes with AU-rich elements (m2/ARE), which have already previously been
implicated in innate immunity [33,34]. In contrast,
among the miRNA cognate motifs that were differentially
regulated in our experiment, none has a known function.
Thus, since 3'UTR conserved elements and miRNA consensus sites are still poorly annotated and characterized,
it is difficult to biologically interpret these results. Nevertheless, it has become clear in recent years that 3'UTR
elements and miRNA cognate sequences are highly
important in regulating gene expression, and it will therefore be interesting to explore their potential role in
immune and inflammatory transcription.

Conclusions
We conclude that Tyk2 function is required for the full
transcriptional response upon LPS challenge, but dispensable for the LPS induction of IFN-responsive genes.
Although it remains presently unclear why Tyk2 mainly
mediates baseline but not LPS-induced type I IFN signaling, we suggest that Tyk2 maintains IFN-responsive genes
in a primed, "ready to go" state, with factors other than
Tyk2 mediating their induction upon immune challenge.
Moreover, we conclude that Tyk2 plays a major but previously unknown role in the regulation of metabolism,
especially lipid metabolism. Our data suggest that Tyk2 is
not only critically required for the downregulation of
baseline expression of many metabolic genes, but also for
their further LPS-mediated suppression. While these
results deserve in-depth future analysis, they clearly
strengthen the previously made case for intricate connections between IFN signaling and metabolism and provide
evidence for a role of Tyk2 in this connection. A better
understanding of the relationship between immunity and

Page 15 of 19

metabolism will also likely be important for improving
therapeutic interventions that target immune diseases as
well as metabolic disorders.

Methods
Mice and macrophages

C57BL/6 wildtype (Wt) mice (Mus musculus) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories International,
Inc. (Wilmington, MA, USA). Tyk2-/- mice are described
in [10] and were backcrossed for ten generations into the
C57BL/6 background. Mice were housed and bred under
specific pathogen free conditions according to FELASA
guidelines. All animal experiments were discussed with
and approved by the institutional ethics committee and
were carried out in accordance with protocols approved
by Austrian laws (GZ 68.205/67-BrGT/2003; GZ 68.205/
0204-C/GT/2007) and European directives.
Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were
isolated from sex- and age-matched mice (males, 8-10
weeks old) as described in [35]. Cells from 2-3 mice per
genotype were pooled for each of the three independent
replicate experiments. 4 × 106 cells were plated out on 6
cm cell culture dishes (BD Falcon) and grown under standard conditions (37°C, 5% CO2) in DMEM medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum
(FCS), 100 mg/mL penicillin, 100 U/mL streptomycin, 2
mM L-glutamine and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. The day
after isolation, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/mL LPS
(E. coli serotype 055:B5, Sigma) or medium only (control), respectively, for six hours. For each combination of
genotype (Wt versus Tyk2-/-) and treatment (control versus LPS) we carried out three independent replicate
experiments.
Microarrays and RT-qPCR

For microarrays and RT-qPCR, total RNA was isolated
using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and
integrity were determined by capillary electrophoresis
(Agilent Technologies).
Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using the
iScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) and
hybridized to the CodeLink Mouse Whole Genome Bioarray http://www.appliedmicroarrays.com/ according to
the manufacturer's protocols. Arrays were scanned with a
GenePix Array Scanner 4000B and GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Data were prepared for
statistical analysis (see below) with CodeLink Expression
Analysis software http://www.appliedmicroarrays.com/.
A gene was recorded as expressed if its unnormalized fluorescence intensity value exceeded 25 (see below). For
these expressed genes, we log-transformed their intensity
values and normalized them, separately for each array, to
a mean of zero and a variance of one. Genes with missing

annotation and duplicate gene entries were removed
before analysis;7546 genes of the approximately 30,000
genes on the microarray remained after filtering. The
microarray dataset has been deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
with accession number GSE19733).
To validate the expression data from the microarrays
we performed reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) for about 170 genes
including several IFN-inducible genes (Additional File 1).
RNA (3 μg/60 μl) was reverse transcribed using the
iScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Taqman qPCR Low Density Custom Arrays (Applied Biosystems) were used to validate the microarray data, either in
48 well (samples in duplicates) or in 96 well (single samples) format. 5 μl cDNA (corresponding to 250 ng input
RNA) were used in a 100 μl mastermix per sample-loading port, containing 5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP
(MBI Fermentas), 1 × ROX reference dye (Invitrogen), 4
Units HotFire DNA polymerase (Solis Biodyne), and 1 ×
reaction buffer B (Solis Biodyne). RT-qPCR was performed on a ABI PRISM 7900 HT machine (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling conditions: initial
denaturation at 95°C for 12 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15
sec and 60°C for 1 min.
Validation of selected addional genes (mixed GO annotations) and genes involved in lipid metabolism was performed with single RT-qPCR assays. RNA (1 μg/20 μl)
was reverse transcribed as described above. For assays
using probes, we used 0.5 -2 μl cDNA (dependent on the
gene analyzed) in a 25 μL mastermix, containing 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP (MBI Fermentas), 300 nM
primer, 100 nM probe, 1 Unit HotFire DNA polymerase
(Solis Biodyne), and 1 × reaction buffer B (Solis Biodyne).
For Qiagen assays, we used 0.5-2 μl cDNA in a 25 μL mastermix, containing 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP
(MBI Fermentas), 1 × QuantiTect primer assay (Qiagen),
0.2 × EvaGreen (Biotium), 1 Unit HotFire DNA polymerase (Solis Biodyne), and 1 × reaction buffer B (Solis
Biodyne). RT-qPCR was performed on a Mastercycler
realplex (Eppendorf ) machine using the following cycling
conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 15 min, 40
cycles of 95°C for 20 sec and 60°C for 1 min. For Qiagen
assays, melting curve analyses were performed in order to
check specificity. For details on RT-qPCR assays see
Additional File 1.
The resulting data were analyzed using SDS 2.2
(Applied Biosystems) or realplex (Eppendorf ) software
and the statistical package R [36]. To compare microarray
and RT-qPCR data we used log-transformed fluorescence
intensity data. To standardize the RT-qPCR data we subtracted the mean Ct values of two endogenous control
genes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2D 2 (UBE2D2)

Page 16 of 19

and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT),
from the RT-qPCR Ct values of the focal genes analyzed
by Taqman qPCR Low Density Custom Arrays. For single
RT-qPCR assays, the standard curve method was used to
calculate the log expression levels, and values for the
endogenous control gene UBE2D2 were subtracted from
those of the focal genes. Thus, the microarray and RTqPCR values were expected to be approximately proportional or inversely proportional, respectively, to the log of
the mRNA concentrations of the focal genes. We found a
good, approximately linear relationship between log
microarray fluorescence intensities and normalized RTqPCR delta Ct values for medium to highly expressed
genes, while at lower levels we generally observed overwhelming background noise (Additional File 1). Importantly, we found a good agreement in terms of
approximate fold induction between array and RT-qPCR
data in general, and especially for IFN-inducible genes,
genes involved in lipid metabolism, and five other genes
(Additional File 1).
In order to check the experiment used for microarray
analysis for effective LPS stimulation and for the
expected differences between Wt and Tyk2-/- cells, IFNβ
mRNA expression was monitored with RT-qPCR (data
not shown). IRF7 and IRF1 were included in the validation experiments (Additional File 1). mRNA expression
patterns of all three genes were as expected [12]. In addition, microarray results for TNFα and NOS2 expression
confirmed our previous findings [10,12].
Analysis of single genes and gene ontology

To analyze the effects of genotype and LPS treatment on
gene expression we used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
For each gene, log-transformed normalized data were
used in an univariate fully factorial two-way ANOVA,
with genotype (Wt versus Tyk2-/-) and LPS treatment
(untreated control versus LPS) as fixed factors:
y gti = m + genotype g + treatment t + ( genotype × treatment ) gt + e gti ,

where ygti is the gti-th expression level for each gene, μ
is the overall mean, g denotes the effect of genotype, t the
effect of LPS treatment, gt the effect of the interaction
between genotype and treatment, and e the residual error
variance. Individual entered the analysis as a random
effect.
Data inspection showed that the distribution of variances approximately follows the expectation (assuming
all genes have equal variances), i.e. a scaled χ2-distribution with four degrees of freedom. Since averaging over
all genes gives a much better estimate of residual variation than single gene estimates of error variance, we estimated the effect sizes for each of the three effects

Vogl et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:199
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/199

(genotype, treatment, and genotype × treatment) as standardized coefficients for each gene, i.e., by dividing the
effects by the average of the square root of the residual
variance over all genes. This approach is similar to the
use of fold changes instead of t-values (see [37,38], but
see [39] for a critique). To test the robustness of our
method we also used moderated t-statistics [40]. Since
the outcomes of both types of analysis were qualitatively
and quantitatively similar (data not shown), we only
report the former analysis.
Of the 7546 genes analyzed, 7546 × 0.05 ≈ 377 genes are
expected to be significantly different by chance alone,
about half of them up and half of them down (assuming a
type I error rate or statistical significance level of α =
0.05). To address this multiple testing problem, we used a
false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 to detect genes that are
likely to be differentially regulated between genotypes,
influenced by LPS treatment, or both. Results based on
genes lists assuming α = 0.01 did not change the qualitative outcome of our analyses (data not shown).
To refine our single gene analysis in terms of biological
function we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis,
using the classification developed by the GO Consortium
http://www.geneontology.org/. This classification consists of three structured controlled vocabularies (or
ontologies) that describe gene products in terms of their
associated "biological processes", "cellular components",
or "molecular functions", in a species-independent manner. We restricted our analysis to the "biological process"
annotation, as this category is easiest to interpret and
since we observed substantial overlap between this group
of genes and the "molecular function" category. For GO
analysis within the "biological process" category, genes
were ordered into GO classes. We separately contrasted
each class with all other classes by performing t-tests
(assuming normality of the data) and nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (relaxing the assumption of normality) on standardized coefficients. Since data were
approximately normally distributed, results differed little
between the tests; we therefore only report t-tests.
Analysis of putative regulatory elements

To relate the gene expression effects of genotype and LPS
treatment to putative regulatory regions, we used bioinformatic analysis to identify putative cis-regulatory elements in the 5'UR, i.e. TFBSs in the promoter region, and
3'UTR regulatory elements (including miRNA targets).
We aimed to use the same alignment methods and similar
methods for defining these different cis-regulatory
regions.
Sequence information was obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Bioinformatics site http://genome.ucsc.edu; in particular, the
mouse mm7-assembly and the human hg18-assembly

Page 17 of 19

data were used. For each gene, we extracted the region up
to 8 kb upstream from the transcription start point
(5'UR) and the 3'UTR, using the UCSC KnownGenes
database, which has a higher coverage than the RefSeq
database. For the few protein coding genes with multiple
entries, we randomly kept a single entry. If an adjacent
gene was closer than 8 kb in the UR, the recorded
upstream sequence was truncated before the start of the
transcribed region of the adjacent gene. We also performed our analyses with shorter regions and obtained
similar results (data not shown).
Homologous human and mouse genes were acquired
using
the
HomoloGene
database
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene (48.1) at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Only
genes with reciprocal best BLAST hit e-values were
selected. For each gene, we aligned the 5'UR and the
3'UTR separately using LAGAN [41]. To obtain a reasonable alignment of the 5'UR, we truncated the longer
sequence so that it had the same distance from the presumed transcription start site as that of the shorter
sequence, despite the fact that in one or the other species
the 5'UR might be shortened by another gene. This truncation thus only affected the most upstream part of the
region. For orthologous 3'UTRs, we allowed for different
lengths because of the generally higher similarity and
thus easier alignment. We validated this method extensively (results not shown, see B. Fuhrmann, unpublished
diploma thesis) [42]. In particular, we found that pairwise
alignments with LAGAN performed better than available
multi-species alignments, because fewer regions were
excluded and because placement of insertions and deletions in multi-species alignments is problematic.
To identify putative regulatory elements (TFBSs and
3'UTR regulatory sequences) we used a comparative
genomics approach. Xie et al. [14] inferred conserved
motifs in the 5'UR (putative TFBSs) and 3'UTR (containing many miRNA cognate sequences) using a comparison
among mammalian genomes. While we are aware that
regulatory sequences may lie outside of these regions
(e.g., in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) or in introns,
especially the first), we refrained from including such
regions, for two reasons. First, as a transcribed region, the
5'UTR imposes more (and different) constraints on regulatory sequences than the untranscribed 5'UR that are
difficult to account for. Second, the search space would
have increased vastly with the inclusion of introns, which
also would have caused alignment problems. We note
that the list of Xie et al. [14] contains several unknown
putative TFBSs, whereas some known TFBSs are not
included. Furthermore, Xie et al. [14] do not distinguish
between TFBSs of some related transcription factors (e.g.,
ISGF3 and most other IRF TFBSs). We used these putative regulatory sequences as raw data for our analysis. We

Vogl et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:199
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/199

parsed each gene of the aligned human and mouse
sequences for conserved motifs in the lists given in Xie et
al. [14]: for putative TFBSs see Supplementary Material
Table S3, for putative 3'UTR regulatory sequences Supplementary Material Table S4, and for conserved octamer
motifs in the 3'UTR Supplementary Material Table S5,
respectively. To exclude false positives, a motif was
defined as conserved if it occurred in the homologous
mouse and human sequence at the same position of the
alignment in any of its forms (including the reverse complement for the 5'UR). To validate the ability of this comparative genomics approach to identify 5'UR TFBSs we
used publicly available microarray data http://symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas/ on samples from diverse mouse tissues (see Additional File 9). We noticed some
discrepancies between the annotation of Xie et al. [14]
and the list of miRNAs in miRBase http://www.mirbase.org/[15-17]. Conserved octameric sequences in [14]
were therefore re-annotated using the list in miRBase
release 10.1. An association was called if the distal
octamer of the mature miRNA matched perfectly to the
octameric region.
To analyze TFBSs and 3'UTR regulatory elements, we
contrasted the normalized effect coefficients of genes
that had at least one conserved regulatory element with
those of the rest of the genes. As for the GO analysis, we
performed both t-tests Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Since
the outcome of these tests was again qualitatively similar,
we only report t-tests.
For our TFBS analysis (see above) we used a rather
stringent definition [14], filtered out all non-conserved
and non-alignable motifs, and excluded all weakly
expressed genes, such that our analysis was based on only
40 genes containing an IRF/ISRE TFBS, with many
known IFN-inducible genes missing. To extend this analysis and to explore different inclusion criteria for 5'UR
TFBSs, we produced a list of 187 known IFN-responsive
genes from the literature (without differentiating between
type I IFN and IFNγ-responsive genes) and asked how
many of these genes show expression changes in our
experiment. As above, we analyzed the standardized
effects of genotype, treatment, and genotype × treatment
on gene expression (Additional File 3, Table 1). Furthermore, we compared IFN-responsive genes to all other
genes with respect to IRF/ISRE or GAS TFBSs in their
5'UR. We used different criteria for including or excluding TFBSs, i.e. we report enrichments for conserved and
nonconserved TFBSs that differ in the length of the
upstream search region (Additional File 3, Table 2). We
also lowered the specificity of our screening for TFBSs of
known IFN-induced transcription factors by allowing for
mismatches (data not shown).
