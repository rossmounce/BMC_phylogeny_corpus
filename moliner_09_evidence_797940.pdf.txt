Abstract
Background: Free-living amoebae serve as a natural reservoir for some bacteria that have evolved
into «amoeba-resistant» bacteria. Among these, some are strictly intra-amoebal, such as Candidatus
"Protochlamydia amoebophila" (Candidatus "P. amoebophila"), whose genomic sequence is
available. We sequenced the genome of Legionella drancourtii (L. drancourtii), another recently
described intra-amoebal bacterium. By comparing these two genomes with those of their closely
related species, we were able to study the genetic characteristics specific to their amoebal lifestyle.
Findings: We identified a sterol delta-7 reductase-encoding gene common to these two bacteria
and absent in their relatives. This gene encodes an enzyme which catalyses the last step of
cholesterol biosynthesis in eukaryotes, and is probably functional within L. drancourtii since it is
transcribed. The phylogenetic analysis of this protein suggests that it was acquired horizontally by
a few bacteria from viridiplantae. This gene was also found in the Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus
genome, a virus that grows in amoebae and possesses the largest viral genome known to date.
Conclusion: L. drancourtii acquired a sterol delta-7 reductase-encoding gene of viridiplantae origin.
The most parsimonious hypothesis is that this gene was initially acquired by a Chlamydiales ancestor
parasite of plants. Subsequently, its descendents transmitted this gene in amoebae to other intraamoebal microorganisms, including L. drancourtii and Coxiella burnetii. The role of the sterol delta-7
reductase in prokaryotes is as yet unknown but we speculate that it is involved in host cholesterol
parasitism.

Background
Free-living amoebae are protozoa that feed by internalizing energy-rich particles, mainly bacteria [1]. However,
some bacteria have adapted to become resistant to amoebal phagocytosis [2]. Some of them have been proposed
to be amoebal endosymbionts, including Amoebophilus
asiaticus [3] and Candidatus "Protochlamydia amoebophila" (Candidatus "P. amoebophila") [4]. The pathophysiological basis of this specific association is as yet

unknown. Candidatus. "P. amoebophila" is the only obligate intra-amoebal bacterium whose genomic sequence
has been released to date [5].
Recently, we described Legionella drancourtii (L. drancourtii) within an Acanthamoeba sp. amoeba. First named
Legionella-like amoebal pathogen 12, it was initially
thought to be strictly intra-amoebal [6]. To investigate the
genetic features associated with its association with amoePage 1 of 8

bae, we sequenced the genome of L. drancourtii. In order
to identify the genes associated with amoebal parasitism,
we herein compared the genome sequences of L. drancourtii and Candidatus "P. amoebophila" to detect the
genes common to both species but absent from other
prokaryotes.

Methods
Genome sequencing
A two-fold genome sequencing of L. drancourtii was performed using the GS20 sequencer (454 Life Sciences,
Branford, CT). Open Reading Frame (ORF) prediction
was performed using the combination of the GeneMark
and GeneMark.hmm programs for prokaryotes [7].
Orthologous gene determination
The alignment between L. drancourtii and Candidatus "P.
amoebophila" amino acid sequences was performed
using the Blastp software. Alignments with a similarity
greater than 40% and an ORF coverage greater than 80%
were considered significant.
Specific gene determination
L. drancourtii sequences of orthologous ORFs were compared to GenBank using the Blastp software (National
Center for Biotechnology Information). ORFs presenting
a match with Candidatus "P. amoebophila" among the 10
best matches were selected and sorted to remove species
redundancy. For selected ORFs, nucleotide sequence was
compared to the GenBank nucleotide collection using the
Blastn software.
Phylogenetic analysis
For studied ORFs, amino acid sequences of all matches
were recovered from NCBI. Sequence alignment was performed using the Muscle software [8]. Phylogenetic relationships among species were inferred using the Phyml
(PHYlogenetic inferences using Maximum Likelihood)
software [9].
Total RNA isolation
L. drancourtii [6] was adapted to axenic growth on BCYE
medium (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) in a 5% CO2
atmosphere at 32°C. RNA was extracted from exponentially-growing bacteria (OD600 0.8) using the FastRNA®
Pro Blue Kit following the manufacturer's instructions
(MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France). Extracted RNA was
resuspended in 100 μl of sterile DNase- and RNase-free
water and treated with DNase treatment (Promega, Charbonnieres, France) during 30 min at 37°C.
Quality and purity control of RNA
RNA quality was controlled using the 2100 bioanalyzer
(Agilent, Massy, France). Absence of DNA in the RNA
sample was controlled by PCR amplification of the 7-

dehydrocholesterol reductase-encoding gene using specific primers (forward primer: 5'-TGACCGTGCTGGTTTTTACA-3',
reverse
primer:
5'AAGACGGTAACGGGCTTTTT-3').
Sterol delta-7 reductase-encoding gene-specific RT-PCR
Transcription of the sterol delta-7 reductase gene was estimated using the SuperScript™ One-Step RT-PCR kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Cergy
Pontoise, France).
RT-PCR product sequencing
RT-PCR products were purified using NucleoFAST plates
(Machery-Nagel, Hoerdt, France) and resuspended in 50
μl of sterile water. Purified products were sequenced using
the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Ready Reaction Mix (Applied
Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer in a
3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR
product sequences were compared to the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase-encoding gene of L. drancourtii by alignment using the Muscle software [8].

Results
L. drancourtii sequencing
A preliminary batch of 466,182 sequence reads from L.
drancourtii was obtained by pyrosequencing. ORF analysis
of the 947 contigs greater than 1,000-bp long used for the
analysis identified 4,386 resulting ORFs, ranging in length
from 15 to 1,999 amino acid residues.
In silico analysis
Among the 4,386 L. drancourtii ORFs, 262 putative proteins showed significant alignment with C. "P. amoebophila", including two for which this species was the
best match. These included a hypothetical Zn-dependent
hydrolase of the beta-lactamase fold (data not shown)
and a 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (also referred to as
sterol delta-7 reductase [GenBank:FJ197317]) (Table 1).
We focused on the sterol reductase because the ten best
matches were distributed into two groups: i) a prokaryotic
group composed of the two amoeba-associated bacteria L.
drancourtii and Candidatus "P. amoebophila" and the obligate intracellular agent of Q fever, Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii), which is able to survive in Acanthamoeba castellanii
[10], and ii) a eukaryotic group composed of viridiplantae, fungi and metazoa (Table 1).

The study of all amino acid sequences matching the L.
drancourtii protein (73 sequences) showed that this protein exhibited best matches with 7-dehydrocholesterol
reductases (also named sterol delta-7 reductases) with
similarity rates ranging from 33 to 53%, and then with
C14 sterol reductases (similarity rates from 23 to 32%)
and C24 sterol reductases (23 to 27%). At the nucleotide
level, the sterol reductase-like genes from L. drancourtii,

Candidatus "P. amoebophila"and C. burnetii, exhibited a
66% similarity rate.
The phylogenetic analysis showed that the L. drancourtii
protein is grouped with the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductases cluster (Figure 1), suggesting that this protein is a 7dehydrocholesterol reductase, and more particularly with
Candidatus "P. amoebophila" and C. burnetii, forming a
distinct group of amoeba-resistant bacteria. The strongly
supported group (100% support) formed by these three
amoeba-resistant bacteria and viridiplantae suggests a
vegetal origin of this bacterial 7-dehydrocholesterol
reductase.
Two other bacteria have sterol reductases: an unclassified
gamma proteobacterium, marine gamma proteobacterium HTCC2080 [11] and a marine bacterium of the
Myxococcales order, Plesiocystis pacifica [12]. However,
these proteins are not phylogenetically grouped in the
previously identified clusters, suggesting that the 3
amoeba-resistant bacteria are the only bacteria to have a
7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. A genomic search confirmed that this enzyme is not known in other prokaryotes.
RT-PCR analysis
RT-PCR from L. drancourtii RNA produced a sequence of
the expected size (Figure 2). The sequence obtained from
the RT-PCR product was identical to that of the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase-encoding gene of L. drancourtii
(Figure 3), confirming that it was transcribed. A control
PCR performed on the RNA sample proved that there was
no DNA contamination.

Discussion
By comparing the genomes of the intra-amoebal bacteria
Candidatus "P. amoebophila" and L. drancourtii with those
of closely related species, we identified a sterol delta-7

reductase, likely acquired from viridiplantae by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The L. drancourtii genome, with a
size of 4.2 Mb, appears to be larger than that of sequenced
Legionella pneumophila strains, with an average size of 3.5
Mb [13,14]. In contrast with other intracellular bacteria in
which the intracellular lifestyle is associated with genome
reduction [15,16], amoebal endosymbionts appear to
have larger genomes than their relatives. The largest difference is in Candidatus "P. amoebophila", whose 2.4 Mb
genome is about twice as large as the genomes of pathogenic Chlamydia species [5]. Another example can be
found in Rickettsia bellii, able to survive in amoebae,
whose genome is the largest among Rickettsia species and
contains an abundance of amoebal parasite genes, thus
showing possible HGT within amoebae [17]. Among
viruses, Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, an amoeba
virus, also possesses the largest genome (1.18 Mb) of all
known viruses [18]. In contrast with obligate intra-cellular
bacteria from other eukaryotic cells, which are isolated in
their hosts, and thus have a limited ability to exchange
genetic material, we hypothesize that amoebae, which
feed on bacteria, constitute a favourable place for genetic
exchange between intra-amoebal prokaryotes, which may
thus have larger genomes that those of other intra-cellular
bacteria.
Among orthologous proteins of Candidatus "P. amoebophila" and L. drancourtii, we discovered a protein similar to enzymes of the sterol reductase family and more
particularly similar to sterol delta-7 reductase, otherwise
found in most eukaryotes but in only few bacteria. A
genomic search confirmed that L. drancourtii is the only
Legionella species to have this protein. Phylogenetically,
the L. drancourtii protein clustered with the sterol delta-7
reductases of Candidatus "P. amoebophila" and C. burnetii, also amoeba-resistant, and this group was closely
related to sterol delta-7 reductases of viridiplantae supported by a high bootstrap value. The most parsimonious

explanation for the presence of this gene in these three
amoeba-resistant bacteria is that it was transferred from
eukaryotes, more precisely from viridiplantae. An alternative but less likely explanation would be that the gene was
lost by all other bacteria.
Inter-kingdom gene transfers have already been reported,
notably from bacteria to humans [19] and from bacteria
to insects [20]. However, HGT from eukaryotic cells to
bacteria is a rare event of particular interest because of the
possible influence of such acquired genes on bacterial fitness [21]. In addition, it was shown that some bacterial
genomes contain genes from viridiplantae, which may be
the case in this study. The most clear-cut example is the
eukaryotic ATP/ADP translocase, an enzyme of intracellular symbiont mitochondria and chloroplasts found in
Chlamydiales and Rickettsiales, [22,23]. On the basis of a

phylogenetic analysis clustering these proteins with plant
homologs, two plausible hypotheses were inferred: i) the
ATP/ADP translocase was acquired from a plant by the
Chlamydia ancestor that might have been a plant parasite
and was transferred to rickettsiae [21] or ii) a nuleotide
transport protein was invented by the Chlamydia ancestor
to support its intracellular lifestyle, duplicated, evolved
into an ATP/ADP translocase gene and transferred to the
Rickettsia ancestor and to plants [22,23]. Evidence for gene
exchanges between intracellular bacteria of amoebae was
shown in the Rickettsia belli genome which possesses
amoeba-associated bacteria genes [17]. Thus, this transfer
from chlamydiae to rickettsiae may have occured within
amoebae. We believe that the first hypothesis may apply
to the sterol delta-7 reductase-encoding gene, leading to
two scenarios (Figure 4): i) the Chlamydia ancestor
acquired this gene from plants, after a genomic reduction,

was conserved only by Candidatus "P. amoebophila" and
L. drancourtii. However, another hypothesis may place the
HGT between an as yet unidentified aquatic plant living in
the natural habitat of amoebae and intra-amoebal bacteria.

In eukaryotes, the sterol delta-7 reductase enzyme catalyses the final step of cholesterol biosynthesis reducing a
double bond at carbon 7 of 7-dehydrocholesterol to produce cholesterol (Figure 5), lipid playing important roles
in the physiology of eukaryotic organisms [24,25]. This
enzyme is a member of the sterol reductase family including the C14 sterol reductase and the C24 sterol reductase,
which exhibit high sequence similarities [26] and whose
the phylogenetic relationships study showed an organization into three distinct clusters (Figure 1).
Although the role of the sterol delta-7 reductase is not
clearly identified in prokaryotes, there is evidence that
some intracellular bacteria can interfere with the host cholesterol metabolism. C. burnetii upregulates host genes
involved in both cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis,
inducing cholesterol accumulation necessary for its replication [27]. Moreover, the C. burnetii genome has genes

predicted to encode enzymes involved in the first part of
the sterol biosynthesis (Figure 5) [28]. Comparison of the
presence of these genes in the three genomes showed that
Candidatus "P. amoebophila" has only the sterol delta-7
reductase-encoding gene, while L. drancourtii has almost
all genes. Some bacteria, like some Myxococcales and Methylococcales, contain only a portion of enzymatic pathway
involved in sterol biosynthesis and as a consequence can
synthesize sterols [29,30], however, only these three pathogens have the last enzyme.
We demonstrated that the sterol delta-7 reductase-encoding gene was transcribed in L. drancourtii. This result,
together with the involvement of this gene in the cholesterol metabolism of eukaryotes, and its presence in C. burnetii which is also amoeba-resistant and is cholesteroldependent, raise the hypotheses that the sterol delta-7
reductase might be functional and play a role in host cholesterol parasitism in L. drancourtii.

Conclusion
In conclusion, by comparing the genomes of two intraamoebal bacteria with those of their close relatives, we
identified a sterol reductase-encoding gene likely acquired
from viridiplantae. The role of this gene in bacteria is as
yet unknown but it could be involved in host cholesterol
parasitism and appear to be linked to intra-amoebal host
fitness.
