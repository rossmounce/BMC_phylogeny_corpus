Identification, phylogenetic analysis and
expression profile of an anionic insect defensin
gene, with antibacterial activity, from bacterialchallenged cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis
AlaaEddeen M Seufi1*, Elsayed E Hafez2 and Fatma H Galal1

Abstract
Background: Defensins are a well known family of cationic antibacterial peptides (AMPs) isolated from fungi,
plants, insects, mussels, birds, and various mammals. They are predominantly active against gram (+) bacteria, and
a few of them are also active against gram (-) bacteria and fungi. All insect defensins belonging to the invertebrate
class have a consensus motif, C-X5-16-C-X3-C-X9-10-C-X4-7-CX1-C. Only seven AMPs have already been found in
different lepidopteran species. No report was published on the isolation of defensin from the Egyptian cotton
leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis.
Results: An anionic defensin, termed SpliDef, was isolated from the haemolymph of the cotton leafworm, S.
littoralis, after bacterial challenge using differential display technique. Based on sequence analyses of the data,
specific primers for full length and mature peptide of defensin were designed and successfully amplified 471 and
150 bp amplicons. The integration of the results revealed that the 471 bp-PCR product has one open reading
frame (orf) of 303 bp long, including both start codon (AUG) and stop codon (UGA). The deduced peptide consists
of a 23-residues signal peptide, a 27-residues propeptide and a 50-residues mature peptide with the conserved sixcysteine motif of insect defensins. Both haemolymph and expressed protein exhibited antibacterial activities
comparable to positive control. The RT-qPCR indicated that it was more than 41-folds up-regulated at 48 h p.i.
Conclusion: Our results highlight an important immune role of the defensin gene in Spodoptera littoralis by
cooperating with other AMPs to control bacterial infection.

Background
The growing problem of resistance of microorganisms to
current antibiotics has fostered the search for novel antimicrobial therapies [1]. Particularly interesting are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) discovered as components of
unspecific innate mechanisms of infection fighting in
humans and animals [2]. AMPs play a crucial role in
innate immune systems of invertebrates, which do not
have an adaptive immunity. Insects protect themselves
from pathogens and parasites via a powerful innate
immune system. Insect innate immune responses include
cellular and humoral responses, and humoral responses

contain melanization and synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The insect immune responses are based
on: the recognition of the pathogen as nonself, the induction of suitable genes and biochemical pathways that
result in the production of a potent arsenal of low molecular weight AMPs [3,4]. Most of these peptides (AMPs)
are produced in the fat body or haemocytes of the insect
and released into the haemolymph. Insect AMPs are
divided into three groups in accordance to their amino
acid sequence and structural features: (i) cecropins which
are linear peptides that form a-helix and lack cysteine
residues; (ii) defensins which have a characteristic six to
eight conserved cysteine residues that form a stabilizing
array of three or four intramolecular disulfide bridges
and three domains consisting in a flexible amino-terminal loop, a central a-helix and a carboxyl-terminal

antiparallel b-sheet [5-7]; and (iii) peptides with an overrepresentation of proline and/or glycine residues, e.g.,
lebocins and moricins [7].
Defensins have been isolated from fungi, plants, insects,
mussels, birds, and various mammals. They are predominantly active against gram (+) bacteria, and a few of them
are also active against gram (-) bacteria and fungi.
Regarding the spacing pattern of cysteines, defensins are
divided into plant, invertebrate, a, b-, and -subfamilies
[8]. All insect defensins belonging to the invertebrate
class have a consensus motif, C-X5-16-C-X3-C-X9-10-CX 4-7 -CX 1 -C. To date, hundreds of AMPs have been
described in insects and a lot of different nucleotide and
amino acid defensin or defensin-like sequences from
many insect species were registered by NCBI data base.
However, only seven authors reported the presence of
defensin-like peptides in Lepidoptera [8-14]. Several
AMPs have already been found in different species of
Spodoptera. These include moricins, cecropins and
defensin, but no report was published on the isolation of
defensin from the Egyptian cotton leafworm, Spodoptera
littoralis. Therefore, the main objective of the present
research was to investigate the immune responses of the
Egyptian S. littoralis, to bacterial challenge. Here we
report the isolation, sequence characterization, phylogenetic analysis, antimicrobial activity and expression
profile of a defensin gene from the haemolymph of
S. littoralis.

Results
Differential display (DD-PCR) using primers corresponding
to well known defense genes

As the identification of the induced antibacterial genes was
the main objective of this study, differential display technique was used to characterize the genetic variation (at RNA
level) between bacterial-challenged and control S. littoralis. Figure 1 shows the results of differentially displayed
cDNAs of bacterial-challenged and control insects using
10 primers (Table 1) corresponding to well known defense
genes. Haemolymph samples were differentially displayed
at 24, 48 and/or 72 h post-infection (p.i.) with S. aureus,
S. sanguinis and E. coli bacterial strains. It was observed
that S. aureus-challenged insects died 24 h p.i., E. colichallenged insects died 48 h p.i. and S. sanguinischallenged insects died 72 h p.i. Differential display results
revealed that the average number of bands per sample was
4.1 bands. The total number of bands resolved in 1.5%
agarose gel for both control and challenged insects was
332 (molecular size ranged from > 1000 to ~80 bp). 146
polymorphic bands (44%) were differentially displayed
with 7 of the used primers. Eight reproducible, treatmentinduced bands were cloned and sequenced using M 13
universal primer.

Primer design, RT-PCR amplification and cloning of
defensin gene

Specific primers for the full length and mature peptide of
defensin gene were designed. These primers would be
used later in the following reactions during this study.
Nucleotide sequence of the used primers was illustrated
in Table 1. PCR was optimized for each primer set and
primers successfully produced positive PCR amplicons of
471 and 150 bp for the full length and mature peptide
sequences, respectively (Figure 2A). The full length fragment includes one open reading frame (orf) of defensin
gene (positions 125 (AUG) - 427 (UGA)). Subsequently
this segment (SpliDef) was cloned into PCR-TOPO vector
(Figure 2B, lane 2) and transformed cells were tested with
PCR using the same primers (Figure 2B, lane 4). Using
this screening method, clone PCR-TOPOSpliDef was
tested as positive (Figure 2B, lane 4). A PCR product
corresponding to the mature defensin peptide was also
cloned into pPROEXTM HTa expression vector
and transformed DH 5a cells were tested as positive
(Figure 2A, lane 3).
Nucleotide sequence and sequence analyses

Nucleotide sequences of SpliDef and its deduced amino
acid sequence are shown in Figure 3. A single orf that
could encode a polypeptide of 100 amino acids was
detected for SpliDef. One stop codon was found at the
3’ end of the sequence. The flanking region of the initiation codon ATG is ATAATGAG, and the length of 3
untranslated region was 45 bp before the poly (A) track
(Figure 3). TATA box as well as GATA, IL-6-RE, and
CATT recognition sites were detected in the sequence
of promoter region of defensin 321 bp upstream from
the start codon. The putative polyadenylation sequence
AATAAAA was located 25 bp downstream from the
stop codon (Figure 3). The identified defensin orf
includes signal peptide (69 bp), propeptide (81 bp) and
mature peptide (150 bp). The deduced SpliDef polypeptide (prepropeptide) contains 14 strongly basic, 7
strongly acidic, 48 hydrophobic and 31 polar amino
acids. The calculated molecular masses of the full length
and mature defensins, were 11.6 and 5.7 KDa, respectively, and the calculated isoelectric points (PIs) were 8.5
and 4.3, respectively. The net charges at pH 7.0 were 4.8
and -5.1, respectively. The defensin prepropeptide was
less stable (Instability Index (II): 33.32) than its mature
peptide (II: 21.09). Ratios of hydrophilic residues were
31 and 30% for prepropeptide and mature defensin peptide, respectively.

36 and 112 different nucleotides; zero, zero, one and 9
gaps; and 29, 40, zero and zero additions were observed
throughout the compared DNA segments (Figure 4).
In addition, the deduced amino acid sequence of SpliDef
was blasted to all defensin-related sequences in GenBank
database. Blast search created significant alignment with
13 insect-published peptide sequences (9 defensins, 2 spodoptericins and other 2 mRNA products). The SpliDef
putative peptide exhibited 96% identity with S. frugiperda
defensin and 2 spodoptericins (Acc# AAM96925,
AAQ18894 and AAQ18895, respectively), 67% identity
with 3 Bombyx mori defensin-like proteins (Acc#
NP_001037370, AAZ38358 and BAG48202), 75, 66, 40, 40
and 48% identity with the defensins of T. ni, Manduca

ABV688523, ACX49766, ABR28349, ABV60344, respectively), and 31% identity with both Drosophila yakuba
mRNA products (Acc# XP_002100630 and EDX01738).

polypeptide of SpliDef (HQ603825) to its corresponding sequences of B. mori, S. frugiperda, S. frugiperda spodoptericin, S. frugiperda spodoptericin, T. ni, G.

ACX49766, CAA81760, ABP97087, ACH96412 and
AAO74624, respectively), 6 conserved cysteine residues
were observed throughout the 13 compared putative
polypeptides (Figure 5). It is noteworthy to mention that
SpliDef amino acid sequence contains 8 cysteine residues
(2 residues in the signal peptide sequence and other 6
residues in the mature peptide). These are comparable to
M. brassicae and C. tripartitus conserved cysteine motifs
(Figure 5). B. mori and A. cerana defensins were observed
to have only 6 conserved cysteine motifs. Meanwhile, all
other compared defensins contains more than 6 (7 or 8)
conserved cysteine motifs (Figure 5). The spacing pattern
of SpliDef six-cysteine residues motif was C-X10-C-X3-CX9-C-X4-C-X1-C, which was consistent with the consensus motif of invertebrate defensins. In addition to the precise conservation of the six cysteines, at least six residues
within the cysteine motif of SpliDef, His77, Leu79, Lys81,
Gly 82 , Tyr 83 and Gly 86 were found to be conserved at

defensins (Figure 5).
Primary, secondary structure analyses, post-translational
modifications and topology predictions revealed that
amino acid sequence of the putative SpliDef peptide has 3
signal peptide cleavage sites (between positions 23-24/3233/34-35), three O-GlcNAcylated residues (1 Ser and 2
Thr at positions 80, 37 and 100, respectively) and one

results of these analyses are shown in Figure 6. In the case
of SpliDef nucleotide seuquence, a phylogenetic tree was
generated from 38 defensin-related sequences (19 insect
species including 7 Lepidoptera, 6 Diptera, 3 Coleoptera, 1
Hymenoptera, 1 Hemiptera and 1 Thysanura) by neighbor-joining distance analysis with maximum sequence difference 1.0 (Figure 6). The topology shows two distinct
lineages including 20 (Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera) and 18 (Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Hymeonoptera and Thysanura) defensin-related sequences,
respectively. The maximum nucleotide sequence divergence was exhibited in the first lineage (10 phylogenetic
groups). Meanwhile, the defensin sequences appear in
the other lineage as less divergent clades (8 phylogenetic
groups). The SpliDef was clustered with other 4 lepidopteran sequences, S. frugiperda defensin (Acc# AAM
96925), spodoptericins (Acc# AAQ18895 and Acc#

AAQ18894) and S. albicosta (Acc# EZ585033), in a monophyletic sister clade (Figure 6). Meanwhile, the other 5
lepidopteran sequences were diverged in different phylogenetic clades (Figure 6). In the case of SpliDef deduced
amino acid seuquence, a phylogenetic tree was generated
from sequence data of 28 published sequences (18 insect
species including 6 Lepidoptera, 6 Diptera, 4 Coleoptera, 1
Hymenoptera and 1 Hemiptera) by neighbor-joining
distance analysis with maximum sequence difference 1.0
(Figure 6). The topology shows two distinct lineages
including 8 (Lepidoptera and Diptera) and 20 (Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Hemiptera)

Quantitative protein analysis

Quantitative protein analysis of the crude haemolymph
of control and bacterial-challenged S. littoralis was
determined at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h p.i. (Table 2).
Statistical analysis of data revealed that the increase of

total protein content in the case of bacterial-challenged
insects was significant at all the tested times. Df, F and
P values were illustrated in Table 2. The expected antibacterial peptide concentration in the haemolymph of
bacterial-challenged insects was increasing smoothly
with the time and an abrupt peak was observed at 48 h
p.i. In addition, the total protein concentration of IPTGinduced, non-induced transformed E. coli and Ni-affinity
purified defensin mature peptide was determined at 1, 2
and 3 h p.i. (Table 2). The protein concentration
increased with the time course reaching maximum at
3 h p.i. Statistical analysis of data revealed that the difference of protein content (expressed protein) in the
case of IPTG-induced and non-induced cells was significant at all the tested times. F and P values were illustrated in Table 2. The quantity of protein lost by
purification (loss due to purification = induced - noninduced - purified) was 65.8, 167.6 and 60.4 μg at 1, 2
and 3 h p.i., respectively. This loss was statistically significant (P = 0.00) in all the tested cases.
Antibacterial assay

Table 3 shows a summary of the antimicrobial screening
of the immunized haemolymph and the Ni-affinity purified mature SpliDef peptide (Figure 2C) based on microbial growth inhibition zone (in mm). Significant activity
was found against gram (-) and gram (+) bacteria for both
the immunized haemolymph and the purified defensin
(Table 3). Notably the antibacterial activities of both
immunized haemolymph and purified defensin 48 h p.i.
were more than 24 h p.i. for all tested gram (-) bacteria.
As for the activity 24 and 48 h p.i. against gram (+) bacteria, no difference was observed in the case of S. sanguinis
and a slight difference was observed in the case of purified
defensin with S. aureus bacteria. The antibacterial activity
of the immunized haemolymph was comparable to the
positive control in the case of P. vulgaris and exceeded it
against the other tested gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria,

48 h p.i. Meanwhile, the antibacterial activity of the purified defensin was comparable to in the case of P. vulgaris
and K. pneumoniae and more than the positive control
against E. coli, S. aureus and S. sanguinis bacteria, 48 h p.i.
RT-qPCR

SpliDef transcript profiles from larval haemolymph of the
control and the bacterial-challenged S. littoralis were
compared at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h p.i. using RT-qPCR
(Figure 7). The SpliDef gene was up-regulated by bacterial-challenge at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h p.i. (2-folds,
3.25-folds, 5.7-folds, 7.9-folds, 41.4-folds and 12.9-folds,
respectively). Statistically significant changes were
observed between the control and the treated samples at
48 and 72 h p.i. (df = 4, F = 101.44, P = 0.00). Notably, it
was more than 41-folds up-regulated at 48 h p.i. No statistically significant change was observed between the
control and the treated samples at 1, 6, 12 or 24 h p.i. (df
= 4, F = 101.44, P > 0.05).

Discussion
In the present study, DD-PCR revealed that several common bands were observed in both control and challenged
samples (house keeping genes). Very few bands were
recorded in control insects and disappeared in challenged
ones (genes were turned off). On the other hand, many
bands were induced as a result of bacterial-challenge at
different time intervals post-infection. DD-PCR technique
is considered a powerful genetic screening tool for complicated dynamic tissue processes, particularly when multiple,
limited-sized samples are involved, because it allows for
simultaneous amplification of multiple arbitrary transcripts [15]. This technique has been developed as a tool
to detect and compare altered gene expression in eukaryotic cells [16], to screen mRNAs, and to characterize differentially expressed mRNAs [17-20]. Many publications
described the enhancement of the insect immune system
and induction of AMPs due to stress and/or bacterial

sized defensin genes isolated from class Insecta. Thus, the
orf of SpliDef (300 bp) was comparable in size to that of
other Spodoptera sp. defensin-like genes (303-306 bp).
Reconstruction of the phylogenetic trees of the SpliDef
nucleotide seuquence and its deduced polypeptide resulted
in two different topologies. In spite of constructing two
different tree topologies, both trees clustered the SpliDef
sequence with that of S. frugiperda to indicate that they
descend from a common ancestor. The grouping of some
lepidopteran and dipteran defensins (e.g. M. brassicae with
A. aegypti and S. littoralis with D. melanogaster) in one

sister clade indicated that they may be homologous or
share some similarity. In addition, the lepidopteran defensin-like sequences were diverged in many sister clades as
nucleotides but they were clustered in a monophyletic
group as amino acids due to the difference in codon usage
in the different insect species.
Although three signal peptide cleavage sites were
detected, the most probable site is between positions 2324. The detected glycosylation and glycation residues may
serve for correct folding and stability of the protein. It was
shown that the unglycosylated protein degrades quickly.
Glycosylation may also play a role in cell-cell adhesion (a
mechanism employed by cells of the immune system), as
well [25]. In addition, 15 phosphorylation sites were identified. Reversible phosphorylation of proteins (using
kinases and phosphatases) is considered an important regulatory mechanism that occurs in both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms [26]. It is very important in proteinprotein interaction via recognition domains [27,28], (i.e.
many proteins and receptors are switched “on” or “off” by
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation). It may also
result in a conformational changes in the structure of
many peptides, causing them to become activated, deactivated or degraded [29].
Spacing pattern of our anionic defensin revealed a possible frameshift mutation of at least six residues within
the conserved cysteine motif of SpliDef (His 77 , Leu 79 ,
Lys81, Gly82, Tyr83 and Gly86) in comparison to (His73,
Leu75, Lys77, Gly78, Tyr79, Gly82) of BmdefA [14]. Numbers refer to the prepropeptide sequence of a defensin.

Figure 7 RT-qPCR of the SpliDef from RNA isolated from the haemolymph of control and bacteria-challenged S. littoralis larvae at 1, 6,

were reported by Lai et al. [30]. Similar properties were
reported by Wen et al. [14] for a novel anionic defensin
peptide (PI: 4.12) isolated from B. mori. These results
were contrary to almost all known defensins, which were
described as cysteine-rich cationic AMPs [e.g. [11,21].
Although most insect defensins are active against gram
(+) bacteria, the purified mature SpliDef exhibited activity against both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria. According to Shai-Matsuzaki-Huang (SMH) model, antibacterial
activity was ascribed to the interaction between the positively charged AMPs and the negatively charged microbial membrane components, which include LPSs in gram
(-) bacteria and polysaccharides in gram (+) bacteria [31].
However, this model has difficulty explaining the behaviours of anionic defensins like SpliDef. For example, the
Amblyomma defensin-2 contains a net negative charge
with a PI value of 4.44, and exerts antimicrobial activity
against the gram (-) bacterium E. coli and the gram (+)
bacterium S. aureus [30]. This suggests that anionic
defensins might possess some novel antimicrobial
mechanisms; although no convincing evidence is available until date. As the knowledge of anionic defensins is
still poorly known, it is of interest to investigate the properties of the SpliDef.
Sequence motifs similar to the binding sites of TATA,
CATT, IL-6-RE, and GATA transcription factors in

mammals were found in promoter region of our
sequence and almost in all genes that are up-regulated
after immune challenge [32]. TATA, CATT, IL-6-RE,
and GATA boxes were found adjacent to each other indicating that they work cooperatively in the transcriptional
activation of the SpliDef gene as previously described in
cecropin A 1 gene in Drosophila [33]. Our results also
showed that the relative transcription levels of SpliDef
were up-regulated after bacterial-challenge, indicating the
involvement of the SpliDef gene in immune responses of
the Egyptian cotton leafworm, S. littoralis. The expression of SpliDef in haemocytes peaks at 48 h p.i. and gradually declines with time. These results were supported
by the quantitative protein analysis which revealed the
significant peak of increase at 48 h post-infcetion.
Kaneko et al. [34] reported that the expression of BmDefensinB in fat body tissue of B. mori peaks at 8 h p.i. and
declines with time. Ceraul et al. [35] demonstrated that
the expression of two defensin isoforms in midgut and
fat body tissues of the hard tick Dermacentor variabilis
peak at 48 h p.i. with Rickettsia and gradually decline
with time. The expression peak in fat body tissue may be
retarded to be at 72 h p.i. in the case of defensin-2. Lopez
et al. [21] found that the defensin expression pattern in
fat body of bacteria-injected Rhodnius prolixus tissue is
higher than in the intestinal tissue. This pattern may be

Seufi et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/47

due to the fact that the expression of defensin gene in
deferent body tissues depends on the consequences of
infection course of a pathogen (injected pathogen attacks
haemocytes and fat body firstly and fed pathogen attacks
alimentary canal firstly).

Conclusions
Our current results provide a typical anionic insect
defensin gene (SpliDef) with a possible frameshift mutation. SpliDef plays an important immune role in S. littoralis by cooperating with other AMPs to control bacterial
infection and it dominates at 48 h p.i. These findings
would be helpful in defensin studies concerning ELISA,
PCR and other related molecular and immunological
techniques.
Methods
Insects and bacterial strains

A laboratory colony of the cotton leafworm, S. littoralis,
used for our experiments was originally collected from
okra field at Giza, Egypt in 1995 and maintained in the
insectary of the Department of Entomology, Faculty of
Science, Cairo University according to the technique
described by El-Defrawi et al.[36]. Larvae were reared on
a semisynthetic diet described by Levinson and Navon
[37] and kept at 25 ± 1°C, 65-70% RH and 14L: 10D
photoperiod cycle.
Two gram (+) bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and
Streptococcus sanguinis, and one gram (-) bacterial strain,
Escherichia coli (D31), were obtained from the Unit for
Genetic Engineering and Agricultural Biotechnology,
Faculty of Agriculture, Ain Shams University and used
for insect immunization. Bacteria were grown in a peptone medium (1%), supplemented with 1% meat extract
and 0.5% NaCl, at 37°C in a rotary shaker.
Bacterial challenge and haemolymph collection

Bacterial challenge was performed by injecting 20 newly
moulted fourth instar larvae with 2-5 μl of approximately
1 × 106 (cells/ml) log phase bacteria dissolved in membrane-filtered saline using a thin-needled microsyringe.
Haemolymph was collected 1, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h p.i. at
4°C (500 μl/each), containing few crystals of phenylthiourea to prevent melanization. Haemolymph was
pooled by piercing a proleg with a fine, sterile needle.
Haemolymph was aliquoted (100 μl each) and stored at
-80°C for a weak to be investigated. The same procedures
were applied to control group except it was injected with
saline without bacteria.
DD-PCR using primers corresponding to well known
defense genes

Total RNA of the insect haemolymph (300-500 μl) was
extracted using RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s

Page 11 of 14

instructions (Qiagen, Germany). Residual genomic DNA
was removed from RNA using RNase-free DNase
(Ambion, Germany). RNA was dissolved in DEPC-treated
water, quantified using a BioPhotometer 6131 (Eppendorf)
and analyzed on 1.2% denatured agarose gel to ensure its
integrity. The 260/280 and 260/230 ratios were examined
for protein and solvent contamination.
A total of 100 ng of DNA-free total RNA was converted
into cDNA using a mix of random and oligodT20 primers
according to the ABgene protocol (ABgene, Germany).
Synthesis of the first cDNA strand was performed in a
thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Mastercycler 384, Germany)
programmed at 42°C for 1 h, 72°C for 10 min and a soak
at 4°C. The cDNA was aliquoted and stored at -80 until
processed (within a weak).
A total reaction volume of 25 μl containing 2.5 μl PCR
buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 200 μM dNTPs, 1 U Taq DNA
polymerase (AmpliTaq, Perkin-Elmer), 2.5 μl of 10 pmol
primer (Table 1) and 2.5 μl of each cDNA was cycled in a
DNA thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Mastercycler 384,
Germany). The amplification program was one cycle at
94°C for 5 min (hot start), followed by 40 cycles at 94°C
for 1 min, 40°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min. The reaction was then incubated at 72°C for 10 min for final extension. PCR product was visualized on 1.5% agarose gel and
photographed using gel documentation system. For DNA
contamination assessment, a no-reverse transcription control reaction was performed.
Eight reproducible bacterial-induced bands were eluted,
cloned in PCR-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, USA) and
sequenced using M13 universal primer. Sequencing was
performed using T7Sequencing™ kit (Pharmacia, Biotech,
USA) and model 310 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Analyses of nucleotide
and deduced amino acid sequences were carried out using
EditSeq-DNAstar Inc., Expert Sequence Analysis software,
Windows 32 Edit Seq 4.00 (1989-1999) and ExPasy database http://expasy.org/tools/dna.html. Blast search for
alignment of the obtained sequence with the published
ones was done using database of NCBI http://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi.
Full length cDNA cloning and sequence analysis

Based on the sequence and alignment data, specific primers for defensin-related sequences were designed and
tried for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). Primers were designed by the rules of highest
maximum efficiency and sensitivity. Rules were followed
to avoid formation of self and hetero-dimers, hairpins and
self-complementarity. RT-PCR reaction was performed as
previously described in this section regarding to the optimum annealing temperature (Ta) for each specific primer
set. Positive PCR products were visualized and eluted
from the gel using GenClean Kit (Invitrogen Corporation,

Seufi et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/47

San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The purified PCR products were cloned into
PCR-TOPO vector with TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen,
USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Ligation
mix was used to transform competent E. coli strain
TOPO10 provided with the cloning kit. White colonies
were screened using PCR as described earlier in this
section. Five positive clones of SpliDef fragment were
selected and sequenced (to exclude PCR errors certainly)
using the specific forward and reverse primers. To study
the characteristics of the promoter region of the SpliDef
gene, promoter region was amplified from chromosomal
DNA (extracted using DNeasy kit following the manufacturer’s instructions) using PromF and PromR primers
(Table 1). Sequencing and sequence analyses were performed as described early in this section. The core promoter region and the transcription start site of the SpliDef
gene was predicted using Neural Network Promoter Prediction http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html
and the minimum promoter score was set at 0.8. In addition to the above mentioned analyses, ExPasy Proteomics
Server http://expasy.org/tools was used to calculate physico-chemical parameters of the translated peptide (ProtParam tool). Furthermore, primary and secondary
structure analyses, post-translational modifications and
topology predictions were investigated using SignalP,
NetCGlyc, NetOGlyc, NetGlycate, YinOYang, NetPhos,
NetPhosK, Sulfinator, ProP, NetNES, TatP and TMHMM
tools. Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequence
and its deduced amino acids were done using Phylogeny.fr
web service, One Click mode. Poorly aligned positions and
divergent sequences were eliminated manually. Multiple
alignment of 58 published defensin-related nucleotide
sequences was done before phylogenetic analyses to
approximate sequence lengths manually. 100% homologous sequences of the same species with different accession numbers were represented by only one sequence. The
cloned DNA fragment was deposited in GenBank under
the HQ603825 accession number.
Expression of the mature defensin peptide

pPROEXTM HTa Prokaryotic Expression System kit (Life
technologies, USA) was used to clone the purified PCR
product corresponding to mature defensin peptide following the manufacturers’ instructions. Charged pPROEX
HTa vector was transformed into the competent E. coli
strain DH5a provided with the kit. Gene expression was
induced by IPTG as described by Goh et al. [38]. Induced
and non-induced samples were analyzed on 12% Tricine
SDS-PAGE and the expressed protein was affinity-purified
on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
quantified spectrophotometrically using Bio-Rad protein
assay kit (Bio-Rad, USA) following the manufacturer’s

Page 12 of 14

protocol. Standard curve was constructed by using Bovine
gamma globulin (BGG).
Antibacterial assay

In vitro antimicrobial studies of the haemolymph samples
as well as the purified mature peptide were carried out by
the agar disk diffusion method with minor modifications
[39,40]. Five milliliters of 0.6% melted LB agar (52°C) were
mixed with 100 μl of viable bacterial suspension (1.6 × 109
cells/ml), and poured into a 9 cm plastic dish. Five microliters of each haemolymph and protein samples were
applied to a 6 mm diameter paper disk and incubated at
37°C. Total protein concentration was quantified spectrophotometrically in both the control and the bacterial-challenged samples using Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad,
USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The difference between the control and the treated samples was
considered accumulated AMP in the haemolymph (subtraction method). Standard curve was constructed by
using BGG. Haemolymph volumes were corrected for
total protein concentration all over the experiment. Penicillin (10 mg/disc; obtained from Sigma) and normal saline
solution were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively. E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. aureus and S. sanguinis were used for testing the
antimicrobial activity. Inhibition zone diameters of five
replicates were measured after 24-48 h. The degree of
growth inhibition was quantitatively evaluated after 16 h
by comparison with the growth inhibition resulting from
the positive control.
Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)

In order to estimate the comparative transcription rate of
defensin, RT-qPCR was used. RT reaction was done as
described above. Initially, 1 μl of the RT reaction was
diluted and used in a RT-qPCR reaction using defensin
primers and untreated control to adjust the sample
volume (ensure similar amplification profiles). 18S rRNA
gene was used as reference gene for RNA normalization.
Each sample was measured thrice in a 96-well plate (Biorad) in a 30 μl reaction volume. Samples were run on a
BioRad iCycler machine under the following conditions:
95°C (5 min) for one cycle, and 40 cycles of 95°C (30 sec),
58°C (30 sec) and 72°C (60 sec). The PCR reagents were
similar to the regular PCR with the addition of 1 μl of a 1/
1000 dilution of Sybr-Green I (Sigma, USA) and 2.5 μl of a
1/1000 dilution of fluorescein to control the background
fluorescence. Subsequently, the adjusted sample volumes
of cDNAs were used to amplify defensin gene in the haemolymph of control and treated insects at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48
and 72 h p.i. Fluorescent detection was performed at the
annealing phase and during subsequent dissociation curve
analysis to confirm that a single product had been amplified. The quantification cycles (Cq) were calculated using

Seufi et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/47

the iQ5 Optical system software version 2.0. Primer
dimers yielded a single sharp peak at the amplicon’s melting temperature. No-template and no-reverse transcription
reactions were used as negative control. Target amplification efficiency of the reaction was determined from the
slope of a plot of Cq versus -log10 concentration of the
initial number of target molecules and all assays showed
high efficiency of amplification (90-96%) and low intraand inter- assay variations. All RT-qPCR experiments
adhered to the MIQE (Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments) guidelines [41]. MIQE checklist is attached as additional file 1.
Statistical analyses

The gene expression levels were quantified relative to
the expression of the 18S rRNA gene using the Gene
Expression Macro software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.,
USA), employing an optimized comparative Cq (ΔΔCq)
value method. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and multiple comparison tests (Scheffé) were applied to
protein concentration, inhibition zone and RT-qPCR
results using SPSS (ver17.0) computer software (SPSS
for Windows, SPSS Inc.). The scale type of Y-axis was
adjusted to the power exponent of 0.25 at a safe mode
to improve the quality of chart and to keep the relative
difference between the control and the treated samples.
