Abstract
Background: Prolonged, altered hematopoietic reconstitution is commonly observed in patients
undergoing myeloablative conditioning and bone marrow and/or mobilized peripheral blood-derived stem
cell transplantation. We studied the reconstitution of myeloid and lymphoid compartments after the
transplantation of autologous CD34+ bone marrow cells following gamma irradiation in cynomolgus
macaques.
Results: The bone marrow cells were first transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector encoding eGFP, with
a mean efficiency of 72% ± 4%. The vector used was derived from the simian immunodeficiency lentivirus
SIVmac251, VSV-g pseudotyped and encoded eGFP under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase
promoter. After myeloid differentiation, GFP was detected in colony-forming cells (37% ± 10%). A
previous study showed that transduction rates did not differ significantly between colony-forming cells and
immature cells capable of initiating long-term cultures, indicating that progenitor cells and highly immature
hematopoietic cells were transduced with similar efficiency. Blood cells producingeGFP were detected as
early as three days after transplantation, and eGFP-producing granulocyte and mononuclear cells persisted
for more than one year in the periphery.
Conclusion: The transplantation of CD34+ bone marrow cells had beneficial effects for the ex vivo
proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors, favoring reconstitution of the T- and Blymphocyte, thrombocyte and red blood cell compartments.

Background
Gene therapy strategies hold promise for the treatment of
hematopoietic disorders. All hematopoietic lineages,
including polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, lymphocytes and natural killer cells, and hematopoietic stem
cells (HSC) – which are capable of self-renewal and
pluripotent differentiation – have been targeted for transduction with therapeutic genes. Most diseases for which
gene therapy could be proposed require stable and longlasting transgene expression for efficacy. Retroviral vectors
present the major advantage of integrating the transferred
DNA stably into the genome of target cells, which is then
passed on to progeny. However, they cannot infect and
integrate into non dividing cells[1]. Most HSC are quiescent [2], respond slowly to stimulation [3-7] and tend to
differentiate and lose their repopulating capacity upon
stimulation[3,8-11]. Lentiviral vectors can be used to
transduce cells in growth arrest [12]in vivo and ex vivo[13],
thanks to interaction of the preintegration complex –
composed of viral VPX and integrase proteins – with the
nuclear pore complex[14]. Vectors derived from HIV1[15,16], HIV-2[17], FIV[18] and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV)have been tested[19].
Methods for transferring genes into hematopoietic cells
must be tested in relevant animal models before their
application to humans [20,21]. Studies in nonhuman primates (NH)P provide an ideal compromise, because these
species are phylogenetically closely related to humans and
a high level of nucleotide sequence identity is observed
between the genes encoding many hematopoietic growth
factors and cytokines in these mammals and their counterparts in humans[22]. Moreover, hematopoiesis in
macaques is very similar to that in humans, and the HSC
biology of macaques is much more similar to that of
humans than is that of rodents, making macaques good
candidates for hematopoietic stem cell engraftment studies [23-26]. In addition, testing lentiviral based gene transfer strategies need to be assessed in species that are
susceptible to lentivirus induced disease. Or particular
interest are the Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection which causes a clinical disease in cats that is remarkably similar to HIV disease in human [27-30] and
experimental infection of macaques with the simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) reproducing both chronic
infection and an AIDS-like disease very similar to those
observed in human patients infected with HIV. Despite
the theoretical advantages of lentiviral vectors over
oncoretroviral vectors, non human primate lentiviruses
clearly have pathogenic properties [31]. The use of lentiviral vectors derived from potentially pathogenic primate
lentiviruses, such as SIV, therefore continues to raise serious clinical acceptance concerns. SIV-based vectors, such
as SIVmac239[31,32] and SIVmac251[33,34], may pro-

vide a unique opportunity to test the safety and efficacy of
primate lentiviral vectors in vivo.
Recent improvements in the efficiency of gene transfer to
NHP repopulating cells[11,35,36] have provided new
opportunities to follow the progeny of each primitive progenitor and stem cells directly in vivo, using retroviral
marking to track individual progenitor or stem cell
clones[37]. Clinically relevant levels (around 10%) of
genetically modified cells in the peripheral blood have
been achieved by ex vivo gene transfer into HSC and the
autologous transplantation of these cells into
macaques[37]. Successful and persistent engraftment (up
to six months) has also been reported in non human primates with primitive CD34+ progenitors genetically modified with a murine retrovirus vector encoding the murine
CD24 gene as a reporter gene[38]. In both trials, marked
cells of multiple hematopoietic lineages were identified in
the blood: granulocytes, monocytes and B and T cells,
including naive T lymphocytes[37,38]. The efficacy of
HSC gene transfer could theoretically be improved by the
use of newly developed retroviral or lentiviral vectors. Particles bearing an alternative envelope protein, such as that
of the feline endogenous virus (RD114), have been shown
to be superior to amphotropic vectors for the transduction
of NHP stem cells followed by autologous transplantation
[39,40].
We report here the results obtained in vitro and in vivo in
an experiment assessing the efficacy and safety of a gene
transfer protocol based on the transduction of simian
CD34+ bone marrow cells with a minimal SIVmac251derived lentiviral vector. This system is based on the VSVgpseudotyped SIV vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under control of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. Most immature CD34+
hematopoietic cells capable of initiating long-term culture
(LTC-IC) were efficiently transduced, and eGFP-positive
cells were detectable in vivo in all animals more than one
year after transplantation.

Methods
Animals
Male cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), weighing between 3 and 6 kg were imported from Mauritius and
housed in single cages within level 3 biosafety facilities,
according to national institutional guidelines (Commission
de génie génétique, Paris, France). All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with European
guidelines for primate experiments (Journal Officiel des
Communautés Européennes, L358, December 18 1986).

Immunoselection of non human primate CD34+ bone
marrow progenitor cells
Bone marrow mononuclear cells were obtained from the
iliac crest or by aspiration from the humerus and isolated
by standard Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation
(MSL2000, Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). Cells were washed
twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Eurobio, Les
Ulis, France) and resuspended in 1% FCS (Fetal Calf
Serum; Bio West, France) in PBS. The cellular fraction was
then enriched in CD34+ cells by positive immunomagnetic selection, using beads coupled to a specific antibody
(clone 561; Dynabeads M-450 CD34, Progenitor Cell
Selection System, Dynal, Oslo, Norway), according to the
manufacturer' s instructions. Immunoselected CD34+
cells were stained with a specific PE-conjugated anti-CD34
antibody (clone 563; Pharmingen, Becton Dickinson,
California, USA) and analyzed by flow cytometry (LSR,
Becton Dickinson, California, USA) to evaluate the level
of enrichment. All preparations contained more than95%
CD34+ cells, with a mean value of 97% ± 1% (n = 12) for
in vitro assays and 96% ± 1% (n = 4) for in vivo assay.

Lentiviral vector
Two SIV-derived vectors were produced, one for in vitro
studies and the other for in vivo studies: 1) pRMES8 is a
minimal packaging-competent SIVmac251-based vector[34]. It contains the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) marker gene under control of the mouse
phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, placed
between the SIVmac251 LTRs and leader sequences. It carries the SIVmac251 RRE region and minimal sequences of
the gag and pol genes encompassing central polypurine
tract/central termination sequence (cPPT/CTS) regions
(figure 1A). pRMES8 was used for in vitro assays investigating the susceptibility of CD34+ cells from primate bone
marrow to transduction with SIVmac251-derived vectors.
2) For in vivo assays, we used pGASE; this plasmid is an
optimised version of pRMES8, with a 3'-SIN-LTR for safety
and insertion of an exon splicing enhancer (ESE)
upstream the PGK promoter to increase titer [41]

pSIV3+ is the packaging plasmid derived from the BK28
molecular clone of SIVmac251, as described elsewhere[33]. Briefly, the pSIV3+ gag/pol expression plasmid

was obtained by replacing the 5' LTR of SIVmac251
(nucletotides 1 to 506) by the human cytomegalovirus
(CMV) early-immediate promoter and enhancer region.
The 5' half of the env gene (nt 6582 to 7981) was also
removed, leaving the RRE (REV-responsive element)
sequence and the 5' and 3' exons of the tat and rev regulatory genes intact. The 3' LTR (nt 9444 to 10249) was
replaced by a SV40 polyadenylation sequence, resulting in
deletion of the 3' end of the nef gene. Finally, the nef initiation codon was inactivated to prevent translation (figure 1B).
pGREV was used for pseudotyping. It is a bicistronic
expression construct encoding the vesicular stomatitis
virus glycoprotein (VSV-g) and the REV regulatory protein, linked by an EMCV IRES. Expression of this cassette,
which contains the rabbit β-globin intron II and polyadenylation (pA) sequences (figure 1C), is driven by the constitutive CMV promoter.
Production of SIV vectors
293T cells were plated at a density of 4.0 × 105 cells per
well (in 6-well plates) on the day before transfection. Cells
were transfected as previously described[42]. SIV vectors
were produced by cotransfection with three plasmids: the
SIV plasmid vector (pRMES8 or pGASE)(1.7 μg), the
helper plasmid, pSIV3+, encoding Gag-Pol and regulatory
proteins other than Env and Nef (1.7 μg) and the envelope glycoprotein-encoding plasmid pGREV (2.2 μg). The
transfection medium was replaced after 16 hours of incubation. Virus-containing medium was collected 40 hours
after transfection, clarified by centrifugation for 5 minutes
at 800 g, and passed through a filter with 0.45 μm pores.
For high-titer preparations, SIV vectors were concentrated
by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 g for 2 hours. The viral
pellet was resuspended by incubation for 2 hours at 4°C
in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% glycerol[34].

For determination of the infectious titer, sMAGI cells were
seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml in six-well plates
one day before transduction in DMEM medium (Life
Technologies Inc., Berlin, Germany) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco BRL, Grand Island,
New York, USA), polybrene (6 μg/ml) (Sigma, Saint
Louis, USA) and an antibiotic mixture (5 mg/ml penicillin; 5 mg/ml streptomycin; 10 mg/ml neomycin; Gibco
BRL, Grand Island, New York, USA). The cells were cultured for one day, and we then added serial dilutions of
virus preparations and incubated the plates for a further
four hours. Cells were then washed in DMEM (Life Technologies Inc., Berlin, Germany). Transduction rates was
determined 48 hours after infection, as the percentage of
GFP-positive sMAGI cells (%GFP+c), by flow cytometry
(FACScan, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Mountain View,

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/50

California, USA) after transducing 4 × 105 cells with 1 ml
of diluted viral supernatant (dilution factor = d). The
infectious titer (IT), expressed as transducing units/ml,
was calculated as: IT = %GFP+cells × 4 × 105/100 × d.
Transduction of immunoselected CD34+ cells
Following immunoselection, CD34+ cells were cultured in
a proliferation medium composed of Iscove's MDM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine
pancreatic insulin (10 μg/ml), human transferrin (200 μg/
ml), 2-mercaptoethanol (10-4M) and L-glutamine (2 mM;
Stemspan, Stem Cell Technologies, Meylan, France). The
medium was supplemented with 50 ng/ml recombinant
human (rh) SCF (Stem Cell Technologies, Meylan,
France), 50 ng/ml rh Flt3-L (Stem Cell Technologies, Meylan, France), 10 ng/ml rh IL-3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA),10 ng/ml rh IL-6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
USA) and 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma, Saint Louis, USA) in
plates coated with retronectin (Cambrex Bio Science,
Paris, France). The CD34+cells were then transduced by 24
hours of coculture with the vector (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 100).
Myeloid differentiation of CD34+ cells
Following the coculture of CD34+ cells with lentiviral vector, part of the cell culture was fixed in CellFix solution
(Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium) for evaluation of the rate of transduction of undifferentiated CD34+
cells. Part of the cell culture was cultured for 14 days in 35
mm Petri dishes containing semi-solid medium (Methocult GF H4434, Stem Cell Technologies, Meylan, France)
composed of Iscove's MDM medium supplemented with
1% methylcellulose, 30% fetal bovine serum, 10-4 M 2mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 ng/ml rhSCF, 10
ng/ml rhGM-CSF, 10 ng/ml rhIL-3 and 3 IU/ml rhEPO.
Cells were cultured at a density of 104 cells/ml (in triplicate) at 37°C, under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2,
to allow the myeloid differentiation of colony-forming
cells (CFC).

The remaining cells were cocultured in 96-well plates for
35 days at 37°C, under an atmosphere containing 5%
CO2, on a layer of stromal cells of the murine fibroblastic
cell line M2-10B4, in a medium composed of αMEM supplemented with 12.5% horse serum (HS), 12.5% FBS, 2
mM L-glutamine, 10-4 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.16 M Iinositol and 16 μM folic acid (Myelocult H5100, Stem
Cell Technologies, Meylan, France) and 10-6 M hydrocortisone. Cells were cultured at a concentration of 103 cells
per well (24 wells per condition per monkey), to allow
long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) to undergo
myeloid differentiation to generate progenitor cells or
CFC. The CFC were cultured for 14 days on semi-solid
medium, as described above, to allow their myeloid differentiation into more mature cells.

AZT pretreatment of immunoselected CD34+ cells
CD34+ cells were treated with AZT before transduction, to
inhibit transduction due to reverse transcription of the
lentiviral vector genome. Immunoselected CD34+ cells
were cultured overnight in the proliferation medium
described above, with AZT concentrations of 0, 10-7, 10-6
and 10-5 molar. The cells were washed twice and transduced with the lentiviral vector, according to the protocol
described above. The real percentage of GFP-positive cells
resulting from reverse transcription of the lentiviral vector
was thus determined by subtracting the percentage of
GFP-positive cells obtained after treatment with a saturating dose of AZT, from the percentage of GFP-positive cells
obtained in the absence of AZT treatment.
Fluorescence microscopy
After transduction and myeloid differentiation in semisolid medium, the colonies formed by AZT-treated CFC
were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert
S100, Zeiss) using a magnification factor of 100. Fluorescence microscopy was used to detect GFP in each colony
subtype, making it possible to determine the percentage
of the colonies positive for GFP. We considered all colonies containing GFP-producing cells to be GFP-positive.
Images were analyzed with Adobe Premiere and Adobe
Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA,
USA).
Gamma irradiation
Eight animals were sedated with ketamine (Imalgène; 10
mg/kg, i.m.), Rhône-Mérieux, France) and placed in a
restraint chair. They received myeloablative conditioning,
in the form of total body exposure to 60Co gamma rays
with an anterior unilateral direction. A total midline tissue
dose of 6 Gy was delivered at a rate of 25.92 cGy/minute.
Dosimetry was performed, with 100 μL ionization chambers placed in paraffin wax cylindrical phantoms of a similar size and orientation to the seated animal.
Transplantation of modified CD34+ bone marrow cells
After the coculture of CD34+ cells with the lentiviral vector, four animals underwent intramedullary infusion, of
whole immunoselected CD34+ cells into both humeri
(Table 1).

Clinical support
All animals received clinical support in the form of antibiotics and fresh irradiated whole blood, as required. An
prophylactic antibiotic regimen was initiated when leukocyte count fell below 1,000/μl and continued daily until it
exceeded 1,000/μl for three consecutive days: 1 ml/10 kg/
day Bi-Gental® (Schering-Plough Santé Animale) and 1
ml/10 kg Terramycin® (Pfizer). Fresh, irradiated (25 Gy;
137Cs gamma radiation) whole blood (approximately 50
ml/transfusion) from a random donor pool was administered if platelet count fell below 20,000/μl and hemoglobin concentration was less than 6 g/dl.
Flow cytometry analysis
Peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells
were incubated for 30 min at 4°C with 10 μl of selected
monoclonal antibodies for single- or triple-color membrane staining. The following antibodies were used: APCconjugated anti-CD3 (SP34-2, Becton Dickinson), PEconjugated anti-CD14 (clone M5E2, BD Pharmingen),
PE-conjugated anti-CD11b (BEAR-1, Beckman Coulter),
PerCP-conjugated anti-CD20 (clone B9E9, Immunotech),
PE-conjugated anti CD8 (clone RPA-T8, Becton Dickinson) and PerCP-conjugated antiCD4 (clone L200, BD
Pharmingen). Cells were washed twice and fixed in CellFix solution (Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium)
for 3 days before analysis on a Becton Dickinson FACS
apparatus with CellQuest Software (Becton Dickinson).
eGFP fluorescence was detected in the isothiocyanate
(FITC) channel. Negative controls from normal macaques
were run with every experimental sample and were used
to establish gates for eGFP quantification.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays
Cellular DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples, using the High Pure PCR
Template Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Roche Mannheim, Germany). DNA was
quantified by measuring optical density (Spectra Max
190; Molecular Devices, California, USA). The eGFP
sequence was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR on
250 ng of DNA run on an iCycler real-time thermocycler
(Bio-Rad, California, USA). Primers were as follows: forward primer, 5'ACGACGGCAACTACAAGACC3'; reverse
primer, 5'GCCATGATATAGACGTTGTGG3'. Amplification was performed in a final volume of 50 μl, with IQ™

SYBR®Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, California, USA), in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification was carried out over 40 cycles of denaturation at
95°C, annealing at 59°C and elongation at 72°C. Standard curves for the eGFP sequence were generated by serial
10-fold dilutions of duplicate samples of the eGFP plasmid in DNA from untransduced PBMC, with 250 ng of
total DNA in each sample. Samples from animals were
run in duplicate, and the values reported correspond to
the means for replicate wells.
Statistical analysis
Paired and unpaired comparisons were performed using
non parametric Kruskal Wallis, Wilcoxon rank and Mann
& Whitney tests, respectively, both of which can be used
for the analysis of small samples when normal distribution is uncertain or not confirmed. Tests were performed
using StatView 5.01 sofware (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley,
CA).

Results
Efficient transduction of cynomolgus macaque CD34+
bone marrow cells
We first assessed, in vitro, the efficiency with which a
SIVmac251-derived vector transduced CD34+ hematopoietic cells from macaque bone marrow (BM). We harvested
BM cells from the iliac crests of 12 different animals.
CD34+ cell preparations with a purity of 97% ± 1% were
obtained by immunomagnetic purification. The CD34+
cells were then transduced by coculture for 24 h with the
lentiviral vector (MOI = 100) in medium supplemented
with SCF, Flt3-L, IL-3 and IL-6. The vector used (pRMES8)
was derived from SIVmac251 and contains the eGFP
reporter gene under control of the phosphoglycerate
kinase (pGK) promoter (Figure 1). Transduction efficiency (Figure 2A and 2B), as evaluated by flow cytometry
analysis of eGFP expression at 24 h, was 41% ± 9% on
average (n = 12). After 24 hours of culture with the lentiviral vector, some of the purified CD34+ cells were cultured for 14 days in semi-solid medium containing SCF,
GM-CSF, IL-3 and EPO to allow the myeloid differentiation of colony-forming cells (CFC), whereas some cells
were cocultured for 35 days on a layer of murine fibroblasts of the M2-10B4 cell line and were then cultured for
14 days on semi-solid medium containing SCF, GM-CSF,
IL-3 and EPO, for the identification of long-term cultureinitiating cells (LTC-IC). Transduction had no effect on
the clonogenic capacity of CD34+ cells: the mean number
of colonies was 41 ± 10 for non transduced cells and 44 ±
12 for pRMES8-transduced cells (12 animals tested, P =
0.60 (Mann & Whitney test)). Similar results were
obtained for LTC-IC, with 19 ± 3 colonies obtained for
non transduced cells and 19 ± 3 for transduced cells (n =
12; P = 0.79 (Mann & Whitney test)). Transduction rates
did not differ significantly between CFC and LTC-IC (P =

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/50

0.4884 (Wilcoxon test), n = 12), with 18% ± 7% and 19%
± 7% of colonies, respectively, eGFP-positive. However, in
both cases, the percentage of eGFP-positive cells was significantly lower than that observed 24 hours after transduction (P < 0.0001 (Wilcoxon test)). This apparent
discrepancy between analyses carried out at 24 h and analyses on CFC or LTC-IC may be due to the eGFP protein
present in viral particles and incorporated into the cell
cytoplasm during the coculture period. The proportion of
cells producing eGFP shortly after transduction was
reduced by 25% ± 15% (Figure 2C) if 10-6 M AZT was
added to cocultures of CD34+ BM cells and lentiviral vector (MOI = 100). Untreated CFC cultures gave percentages
of eGFP-producing cells similar to those observed before
differentiation (26% ± 5%) (Figure 2D). No fluorescence
was detected after myeloid differentiation of the AZTtreated CFC (n = 3), confirming that eGFP detection
resulted from the production of this protein from integrated vector.
Mosaicism was observed in eGFP gene expression in several colonies (Figure 3). Indeed, eGFP was detected in
56% ± 4% of colonies, whereas only 26% ± 5% of individual cells were eGFP-positive. These results suggest that, on
average, only 47% of cells from a single colony contained
the SIV vector.
Transplantation of autologous BM CD34+ cells transduced
by SIV-based vector into cynomolgus macaques
We explored the capacity of autologous CD34+BM cells
transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector to engraft efficiently into macaques after total body irradiation (TBI)
with a gamma source at the sublethal dose of 6 Gy. Three
groups of 4 animals were used: 1) In Group 1, macaque
CD34+ BM cells (96% ± 1% pure on average) were
obtained from the two humeri before gamma irradiation
(Table 1). These cells were cocultured, as described above,
with pGASE, which is an improved version of pRMES8.
Indeed, a mean transduction efficiency of 72% ± 4% was
obtained (n = 4) at 24 hours and 37% ± 10% of CFC produced eGFP. Two days after gamma irradiation, 1.4 × 106
to 2.9 × 106 CD34+ cells per kg were injected into both
humeri of macaques (Table 1); 2) Group 2 included irradiated (6 Gy) macaques that did not undergo cell transplantation: 3) Group 3 included 4 non irradiated animals,
which were used as controls, with a similar bleeding frequency.
Reconstitution of hematopoietic cells in vivo
Following total-body irradiation with 6 Gy, transfusion
and an antibiotic regimen were required to ensure that all
the animals survived. However, one animal from group 1
(7036) died on day 40 due to profound pancytopenia
(Figure 4). This macaque received the smallest number of
autologous and transduced CD34+ BM cells. All other ani-

Figure 2 of transduction of cynomologus macaque primitive hematopoietic cells with SIV-based lentiviral vectors
Efficiency
Efficiency of transduction of cynomologus macaque primitive hematopoietic cells with SIV-based lentiviral vectors. A: Non
transduced cells were used as a control for each animal. B: Transduction of bone marrow progenitor cells with an SIV-based
vector. CD34+ cells were cultured in the presence of cytokines (see materials and methods) and exposed to vector particles at
an MOI of 100 for 24 hours before FACS analysis for eGFP production. C: CD34+ cells were cultured overnight in a proliferation medium supplemented with various concentrations of AZT (100 nM, 1 mM, 10 mM). Cells were then washed twice and
transduced with various multiplicities of infection (MOI) of the lentiviral vector (0, 1, 10, 100). After 24 hours of coculture with
lentiviral vector, some of the CD34+ cells were used to evaluate the rate of transduction of undifferentiated CD34+ cells (C); *
indicate statistically significant differences (Kruskal Wallis test) between cultures with and without AZT treatment for MOI = 1
(p = 0,0378), MOI = 10 (p = 0,0224) and MOI = 100 (p = 0,0247). Some of the cells were cultured for 14 days, to allow the
myeloid differentiation of CFC. Cells were then resuspended, washed and fixed for three days. They were analyzed by flow
cytometry, to evaluate the percentage of eGFP-positive cells and determine the rate of transduction (D); * indicates a statistically significant difference (p = 0,0237(Kruskal Wallis test)) between cultures with and without AZT treatment for MOI = 100.
The results shown are the mean values for the three monkeys, each studied in triplicate.

mals from groups 1 and 2 were studied from days -1 to
471 after gamma irradiation. Controls were followed over
the same period.
Radiation rapidly induced severe anemia in all animals
(data not shown). A significant decrease in the number of
polymorphonuclear cells in the periphery was observed,
starting on day 1 after irradiation (Figure 4). No significant difference was observed between the animals of
groups 1 and 2 in terms of the minimum number of cells
(821 ± 226 cells/μl for group 1 and 658 ± 107 cells/μl for

group 2, P = 0.3768 (Mann & Whitney test)) or the time
at which that minimum occurred (6 ± 5 days for group 1
and 7 for group 2, P = 0.4795 (Mann & Whitney test)).
Lymphocyte counts also decreased in all macaques by day
1 after gamma irradiation (Figure 4), falling to a minimum of 220 ± 107 lymphocytes/μl on day 18 ± 12 in
group 2 and of 347 ± 62/μl on day 11 ± 12 in transplanted
animals (group 1). Animals undergoing transplantation
tended to display less severe lymphopenia, but no statistical difference was observed between the two groups of
irradiated animals in terms of the day on which minimum

lymphocyte count was reached (P = 0.1939 (Mann &
Whitney test)) or the level of that minimum (P = 0.3805
(Mann & Whitney test)). A significant decrease in platelet
counts, beginning by day 10 (Figure 4), was observed in
all irradiated animals. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count
< 20,000/μl) was characterized in non transplanted animals by a minimum value of 3.75 ± 2.49 × 103 platelets/
μl on day 18 ± 3. Thrombocytopenia tended to be less
severe in transplanted animals, but this difference was not
significant for the minimum number of platelets (10.33 ±
5.25 × 103 platelets/μl; P = 0.1124 (Mann & Whitney
test)) or for the day on which that minimum occurred
(14.33 ± 0.94; P = 0.3123 (Mann & Whitney test)). This
thrombocytopenia required one transfusion in all animals (other than animal 7036, which needed two transfusions) of both groups. However, platelet reconstitution
seemed to be correlated with the dose of CD34+ cells
infused, the speed of reconstitution increasing with the
number of CD34+ cells injected (macaque 6653).

Reconstitution of bone marrow clonogenic activity
We determined the effects of CD34+ bone marrow cell
transplantation following gamma irradiation on the ex
vivo proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic
progenitors. Before gamma irradiation, a mean of 40 ± 9
and 38 ± 6 colonies was observed for groups 1 and 2,
respectively (Figure 5). Colony number decreased significantly (P < 0.0001 (Wilcoxon test)) by day 7 in all animals. In both groups, clonogenic activity was detected by
day 43 after gamma irradiation with reconstitution significantly better in the animals undergoing transplantation
than in those that did not undergo transplantation (P =
0.0009 (Mann & Whitney test)).
Presence of eGFP-positive cells in bone marrow and
peripheral blood
Cells with integrated SIV-vector DNA were detected by
PCR (Table 2) as early as day 3 after transplantation, in at
least two animals (6653 and 6833). These two animals
had received the largest numbers of transduced CD34+
bone marrow cells. Monkey 7036, which died within 40

Figure irradiation and transplantation on polymorphonuclear cell, lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts
Effect of4
Effect of irradiation and transplantation on polymorphonuclear cell, lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts. All animals were followed during the weeks preceding the study, and for more than 240 days after the irradiation. We carried out hematological
analysis including blood cell counts with an automated hemocytometer (Coulter Corporation, Miami, USA).

days of gamma irradiation had very few transduced cells
in the bone marrow and SIV-DNA was not detected in
peripheral blood cells. In the three remaining animals,
vector DNA was detected in peripheral blood cells (up to

500 copies per million cells) and in the bone marrow (up
to 6250 copies per million cells) more than one year after
transplantation (day 471).

Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated the presence of
eGFP-producing cells among peripheral blood mononuclear cells in myeloid and lymphoid lineges of monkey
6896 (Figure 6). Peripheral blood cells were sorted on the
basis of eGFP production, with the aim of characterizing
the phenotype of populations of cells expressing the transgene in more detail. We found that 61% of eGFP-positive
cells were CD11b-positive,5% of these cells appeared to
be CD14+ monocytes, 14% were CD20+ B cells and 10%
were CD3+ T cells, 23% of which expressed CD8 and 77%
expressed CD4 (data not shown).

Discussion
The aim of this work was to study reconstitution of the
myeloid and lymphoid compartments after the autologous transplantation of genetically modified CD34+ bone
marrow cells into cynomolgus macaques previously subjected to gamma irradiation.

We first assessed, in vitro, the efficiency with which a
SIVmac251-derived vector transduced macaque CD34+
hematopoietic bone marrow cells. These vectors are similar to those derived from HIV. However, SIV-derived vectors clearly outperform HIV-derived vectors in simian
cells. In fact, HIV-1 fails to replicate in simian cells
because of an early postentry block [43,44], and Kootstra
et., al showed that the viral determinant involved in
postentry restriction of HIV-1 replication in simian cells is
located at or near the cyclophilin A (CyPA) binding region
of the capside protein [45]. The hydrophobic pocket of
cyclophilin A (CypA) makes direct contact with an
exposed, proline-rich loop on HIV-1 capsid (CA) and
renders reverse transcription complexes resistant to an
antiviral activity in human cells. A CypA fusion with
TRIM5 (a member of the tripartite motif family) that is
unique to New World owl monkeys also targets HIV-1 CA,
but this interaction potently inhibits infection. A similar
block to HIV-1 infection in Old World monkeys is attributable to the α isoform of the TRIM5 orthologue in these

Flow cytometry analysis of hematopoiesis reconstitution
Flow cytometry analysis of hematopoiesis reconstitution. Animal transplanted with autologous CD34+ bone marrow cells
transduced with an SIV-based vector. eGFP-positive cells present in P1 and P2 were analyzed by immuno-staining to identify
the subpopulations of eGFP-positive cells in peripheral blood. CD20-PerCP-Cy5, CD14-PE, CD11b-APC and CD3-APC staining were used to identify the B-lymphocyte, monocyte, granulocyte and T-lymphocyte subpopulations.
species and using RNA interference techniques, Berthoux
et., al demonstrated that CypA inhibits HIV-1 replication
in these cells because it is required for CA recognition by
TRIM5α [46]. SIV vectors can also efficiently transduce
human cells[33,47], and may therefore prove a useful
alternative to HIV-1-based vectors, at least in the early
phase of preclinical testing of lentivirus vectors. We found
that the proportion of eGFP-positive cells obtained before
myeloid differentiation (mean value of 30%) was similar
to that obtained with CD34+ cells from human donors
transduced with lentiviral [48-51], retroviral [52-54],
AAV[55], or adenovirus/AAV-derived [56] vectors. However, it is possible to increase the transduction rate, such
that 90% transduced human CD34+ cells are obtained
from cord blood, 80% from bone marrow and 75% from
G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood [57]. We analyzed
transduction in two types of assay, based on committed
(CFC) and primitive (LTC-IC) hematopoietic progenitors,
as analyses of the transduction of committed progenitors
only bear little relation to the transduction efficiency for
stem cells and less differentiated cells in the long term.

After myeloid differentiation, eGFP+ cells were detected, in
similar proportions, in CFC on day 15 and LTC-IC on day
50 after transduction, indicating that the vector was able
to transduce progenitor cells and most immature hematopoietic cells with a similar efficiency. Similar results have
been reported for stimulated human CFC and LTC-IC,
which were found to be transduced with similar efficiency
by a lentiviral vector based on HIV-1[58]. In this previous
study, significant resistance to lentiviral transduction was
reported in unstimulated primitive human cells. These
results may explain why, in our study, the use of cytokines
during transduction made possible the genetic modification of LTC-IC, which are quiescent. Cytokine treatment
may have led to these cells entering the cell cycle, facilitating transduction. This result confirms the greater efficiency of lentiviral vectors than of retroviral vectors for the
transduction of CD34+ cells. Nevertheless, in our study,
only half as many eGFP-positive cells were obtained after
differentiation as were obtained from undifferentiated
CD34+ cells. Similar observations have been made with
MLV-transduced progenitor cells from human

Retrovirology 2008, 5:50

donors[59]. We demonstrate here that these differences
may be accounted for by the pseudotransduction detected
at 24 h of incubation with the vector, confirming the
results reported with CD34+ cells in studies using VSVgpseudotyped MLV-derived[60] or lentivirus-derived vectors[51]. It has been suggested that pseudotransduction
may result from VSVg-pseudotyping due to membrane
fusion efficiency being higher than the rate of integration
of the transgene[61]. Nevertheless, most lentiviral vectors
have been generated with VSV-G, as this glycoprotein
makes it easy to recover and concentrate the pseudotyped
vectors [62].
We also showed that eGFP was produced in all colony
subtypes. Clusters of eGFP production were observed on
fluorescence microscopy, indicating that not all the cells
of a given positive colony – theoretically derived from a
single cell – produced eGFP. This result is consistent with
those of Mikkola et al. concerning murine HSC transduction by a VSVg-pseudotyped lentiviral vector, in which a
mismatch was reported between the transduction rate of
cells (almost 25%) and the transduction rate of myeloid
colonies (almost 60%). These authors highlighted the
occurrence of mosaicism in GFP gene expression in colonies obtained following the myeloid differentiation of
CD34+ cells[63], possibly due to a delay in the integration
of the transgene during differentiation, resulting in the
formation of clusters of GFP-positive cells within a single
myeloid colony.
In our in vivo study, autologous HSC were injected into
the bone marrow, whereas intravenous injection is currently the most frequently used transplantation method.
We aimed to increase seeding efficiency and homing, as
only a limited number of stem cells were theoretically
available. However, 2.5 × 106 to 5.0 × 106 CD34+ cells is
generally sufficient to ensure engraftment, and we found
that less than 2.0 × 106 cells were sufficient for long-term
reconstitution in macaques. As predicted[64,65], totalbody gamma irradiation leads to a drastic decrease in the
number of hematopoietic progenitors, preventing the
development of mature cells [66]. Despite the occurrence
of severe pancytopenia, a positive correlation has been
found between the number of CD34+ cells infused and
time required for immune reconstitution [42,67,68].
However, hematopoietic recovery may take longer if fewer
than 2.0 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg are infused. This notion is
consistent with our observation that CD34+ cell transplantation decreases both the severity and duration of irradiation-induced cytopenia. Clonogenic activity also
reappeared more strongly in transplanted animals. We
also showed that the animals recovered B cells, T cells,
monocytes and granulocytes. Nevertheless, the functional
activity of these cells requires confirmation, particularly
for lymphocytes. However, although we observed long-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/50

term reconstitution with lentiviral vector-transduced cells
of different lineages, its proportion remained below 1%.
Hanawa et al., provided the first evidence that SIV-based
vectors can successfully transduce rhesus macaque repopulating hematopoietic stem cells, with an average of 16%
of peripheral blood leukocytes containing the SIV vector
genome. However, this study was carried out with HSC
from mobilized peripheral blood cells, making it possible
to obtain larger numbers of HSC than can be harvested
from bone marrow. Nevertheless theoretically, these cells
contained more progenitors that were already committed
and fewer pluripotent stem cells capable of long-term
reconstitution than medullary HSC[69]. The small numbers of eGFP-producing cells observed in our study may
be due to an anti-eGFP immune response. Some reports
have suggested that such reactions do not generally occur
after irradiation[70], but two reports described the induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses to enhanced
green (GFP) or yellow (YFP) fluorescent proteins after
myeloablative conditioning. One of these reports concerned baboons that had received primitive hematopoietic cells transduced with HIV-1-based lentiviral
vectors[71] and the other concerned rhesus macaques that
had received CD34+ stem cells transduced with a retroviral
vector[72].
Lentiviruses, like retroviruses, can be used to integrate
transgenes into the host genome. Two severe adverse
events occurred in two patients in the SCID-X1 gene therapy trial 30 to 34 months after injection of the autologous
CD34+ cells corrected using a retroviral vector. In these
patients, an uncontrolled clonal T lymphoproliferative
syndrome, similar to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was
observed [73,74]. This study highlights the risk of insertional mutagenesis restricted to retroviral and lentiviral
gene transfer. In the future, additional safety measures
could be considered, such as the use of self-inactivating
LTRs (as in our study) to reduce enhancer activity, the
addition of insulators to reduce the risk further, and the
insertion of a second transgene encoding a "suicide" product, such as herpes thymidine kinase, making it possible
to kill the transduced cells with ganciclovir. Unlike studies
in mice, in which the follow-up period is necessarily limited, studies in large animals, with a longer life span, are
compatible with more extensive follow-up. The development of linear amplification-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR), a
sensitive and robust approach to molecular clonal analysis, has made it possible to identify and analyze the contribution of individual transduced clones to
hematopoiesis. Clonal analysis may provide information
about the dominance of transduced clones, potentially
predicting possible progression or the propensity to
develop clonal hematopoiesis and leukemia. Moreover,
replication-competent retrovirus (RCRs), recombinant
retrovirus and interaction with endogenous retroviruses

should also be investigated, when evaluating the biosafety
of retrovirus and lentivirus.

Conclusion
The results reported here provide the first evidence that
gene transfer into medullary hematopoietic stem cells and
long-term expression of the transgene are possible, using
an SIV-based lentiviral vector in non human primates,
which provide the best clinical models for in vivo evaluation of the feasibility and safety of gene therapy strategies.
