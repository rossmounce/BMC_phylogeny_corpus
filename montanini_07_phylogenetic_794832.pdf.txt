Abstract
Background: The Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family is a ubiquitous family of heavy metal
transporters. Much interest in this family has focused on implications for human health and
bioremediation. In this work a broad phylogenetic study has been undertaken which, considered in
the context of the functional characteristics of some fully characterised CDF transporters, has
aimed at identifying molecular determinants of substrate selectivity and at suggesting metal
specificity for newly identified CDF transporters.
Results: Representative CDF members from all three kingdoms of life (Archaea, Eubacteria,
Eukaryotes) were retrieved from genomic databases. Protein sequence alignment has allowed
detection of a modified signature that can be used to identify new hypothetical CDF members.
Phylogenetic reconstruction has classified the majority of CDF family members into three groups,
each containing characterised members that share the same specificity towards the principallytransported metal, i.e. Zn, Fe/Zn or Mn. The metal selectivity of newly identified CDF transporters
can be inferred by their position in one of these groups. The function of some conserved amino
acids was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis in the poplar Zn2+ transporter PtdMTP1 and
compared with similar experiments performed in prokaryotic members. An essential structural
role can be assigned to a widely conserved glycine residue, while aspartate and histidine residues,
highly conserved in putative transmembrane domains, might be involved in metal transport. The
potential role of group-conserved amino acid residues in metal specificity is discussed.
Conclusion: In the present study phylogenetic and functional analyses have allowed the
identification of three major substrate-specific CDF groups. The metal selectivity of newly
identified CDF transporters can be inferred by their position in one of these groups. The modified
signature sequence proposed in this work can be used to identify new hypothetical CDF members.

Background
Copper, iron, zinc, cobalt, nickel and manganese are
essential metal cations in cellular processes, since they act
as important cofactors for many enzymes, are components of transcription factors and other proteins, and are
essential for both mitochondrial and chloroplast functions. However, when present at high concentration,
along with non-essential metals such as cadmium, mercury, silver and lead, essential metals can become
extremely toxic, since they can cause oxidative damages or
compete with other essential ions. A network of uptake,
extrusion, chelation, trafficking and storage mechanisms
ensures the maintenance of metal homeostasis at the cellular level. Specific transporters, encoded by multigenic
families, are responsible for the uptake and secretion of
metal ions, and for their sequestration into organelles [14].
Cation diffusion facilitator (CDF, TC 2.A.4) transporters,
first identified by Nies and Silver [5], are ubiquitous,
spanning all three kingdoms of life: Archaea, Eubacteria
and Eukaryotes. Studies on CDF transporters may inform
strategies for bioremediation and human nutrition and
health [1,2,4]. All known CDF substrates are divalent
metal cations with ionic radii of 72 (Zn2+) to 97 (Cd2+)
pm [4]. Most CDFs are Me2+/H+ (K+) antiporters [6-9] that
catalyse the efflux of transition metal cations, including
Zn2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, or Mn2+, from the cytoplasm
to the outside of the cell or into subcellular compartments
[1,2,4,7,10-13]. The majority of CDF proteins possess six
putative transmembrane domains (TMDs), with cytoplasmic N and C termini, as experimentally demonstrated for
bacterial members [10,14]. A signature sequence between
TMDs I and II was proposed in 1997 [15], and a characteristic C-terminal cation efflux domain is present in all
members [16] (Pfam 01545, [17]). The most conserved
regions are the amphipathic TMDs I, II, V and VI, which
are likely involved in metal transfer [18]. However, some
CDF members exhibit different types of secondary structure: for example the Msc2 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is predicted to have 12 TMDs [19], and the human
protein ZnT5 and its splice variant ZTL1 display 15 and 12
TMD topology, respectively [20,21]. Plant CDF members
are usually called Metal Tolerance Proteins (MTPs), while
vertebrate members are named Zinc Transporter (ZnT) or
Solute carrier family 30 (SLC30).
Most CDF family transporters also contain a histidine-rich
region, either between TMDs IV and V, or at the N and/or
C termini. Such regions are predicted to be cytoplasmic,
cis to metal uptake, and could function as potential metal
(Zn2+, Co2+, and/or Cd2+) binding domains. However the
ER-localised Zrg17, a Zn2+ transporter recently characterised in yeast, displays a histidine-rich loop predicted to
reside between TMDs III and IV toward the ER lumen [22].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/107

The plant CDF member ShMTP1 (ShCDF8) isolated from
Stylosanthes hamata, is involved in Mn2+ homeostasis and
tolerance, shows a predicted 4–5 TMD topology, and does
not contain the histidine-rich domain [11,16].
Some CDF transporters function as homo-oligomeric
complexes [23-26] or hetero-oligomeric complexes
[22,24], and may directly interact with other proteins to
regulate their activity by means of metal release to these
proteins [27]. Indirect evidence that CDF transporters
interact with other proteins also comes from studies on
the rat ZnT4 [28].
Research over the past few years, mainly performed on
prokaryotic CDF members, has aimed at identifying
molecular mechanisms involved in metal binding and
transport across the membranes. Key functional amino
acid residues, identified by site-directed mutagenesis,
reside in the three amphipathic and conserved transmembrane helices II, V and VI, which are supposed to constitute an inner core forming a channel [14,18,29,30].
Indeed recent studies on the CDF transporter EcFieF (YiiP)
from Escherichia coli localised a substrate binding site at
the dimer interface created by the TMDs II and V [31].
Here we undertake a phylogenetic analysis of CDF family
amino acid sequences based on a set of CDF sequences
retrieved from databases. Based on a multiple sequence
alignment, we propose a modified signature for the CDF
family that takes account of newly characterised members.
Coupled with the substrate specificities of some characterised transporters, we are able to classify the family members into three major groups that have different selectivity
towards the principally-transported metal (Zn-, Fe/Znand Mn-CDF). Functional analyses, based on site-directed
mutagenesis, were carried out on the eukaryotic Zn2+
transporter PtdMTP1 [23] to identify key residues important for CDF function. The role in metal selectivity of the
group-conserved residue D (for Mn-specific CDF transporters) or H (for Zn- and Fe/Zn-CDF transporters)
embedded in TMD V is also discussed.

Results
General features of the CDF family
Data mining and identification of an improved signature for the CDF
family
Deduced amino acid sequences, belonging to characterised or hypothetical CDF transporters, have been retrieved
from Genebank and SwissProt and from a set of annotated genomes, thus covering most phylogenetic groups
(see Methods). An additional set of sequences, homologous to Zrg17 from S. cerevisiae was retrieved by a BLASTP
search on completely sequenced genomes, since in the
automatically annotated genomes these members were
not identified.

Sequences that displayed significant truncation were discarded. A final set of 273 representative CDF amino acid
sequences (see accession numbers in additional file 1)
was used for phylogenetic analysis using MEGA software
(version 3.1) [32]. CDF members displayed the highest
conservation in trans-membrane regions, especially in
TMD II, where the following signature was previously
defined for this family [15].
S-X-[ASG]-[LIVMT]2-[SAT]-[DA]-[SGAL]-[LIVFYA][HDN]-X3-D-X2-[AS]
X = any amino acid
[ ] = one of the amino acid between brackets is possible
Since 1997, new CDF transporters have been characterised or identified by similarity with known CDFs, and the
number of recognised CDF family members has dramatically expanded, in large part due to data coming from
automated annotated genomic sequences; the first signature was derived from only 13 CDF members and now
appears too restrictive to allow the recognition of the
newly identified CDF members. From the original signature, an improved signature was designed based on the
amino acid multiple sequence alignment. Compared to
the original signature, this pattern is extended on the C
terminus side and includes a fully conserved glycine
(underlined below) and the downstream five amino
acids. The lack of the conserved glycine and the downstream amino acids in the signature pattern allows a false
match with non-CDF proteins otherwise absent when
using the complete modified signature. The pattern was
subsequently checked against Swiss-Prot (release 50.2),
TrEMBL (release 33.2) and PDB databases at ScanProsite
[33].
[SC]-X-[ASG]-[LIVM]-[LIVMTAF]-[SATG]-[DAELSTY][SGALFMTV]-{DKNPQR}-[HDNEL]-X3-[DH]-X2[ASGLNTI]-X20–25-G-X2-[KNQRSY]-X-[DEGLNPQRST]

between TMD II and TMD III is represented by a non-conserved region of 20 to 25 residues; the CDF sequences
retrieved by ScanProsite mostly carried 21 or 22 residues
in that position (83% and 12% respectively). The signature matches with all those CDF sequences used in the
alignment available at ScanProsite, with the exception of
ScZrg17 from S. cerevisiae and some of its homologous
sequences – recovered by BLASTP search on completely
sequenced genomes-, which display a partial signature,
since the first three amino acids are not conserved in these
members. About 5% of matched sequences (48 out of
978) were false positive, since they clearly belonged to
other families or because BLAST searches revealed that
they did not match any of the sequence used for the alignment. These sequences mostly contained charged or large
amino acid residues in the five free (X) positions around
the conserved [DH] residue (position 89 in PtdMTP1, see
Figure 1) that do not fit in TMD II of CDF members.
Identification of key residues important for the CDF function
To delineate the importance of highly conserved residues,
single amino acid substitutions were generated by site
directed mutagenesis, on a well-characterised eukaryotic
CDF, namely the vacuolar Zn2+ transporter PtdMTP1 from
the hybrid poplar Populus trichocarpa × Populus deltoides
([23] and Table 1). The plant zinc transporter PtdMTP1
was chosen, since, to our knowledge, it is the only eukaryotic CDF for which various site directed mutagenesis data
are already available [23]. The effect of individual amino
acid changes was assessed by expressing mutated PtdMTP1
in the Zn-hypersensitive yeast mutant zrc1Δ and by monitoring Zn2+ resistance of cells (Figure 2).

As suggested by topological predictions from diverse CDF
family members, the highly conserved glycine residue
resides in the cytoplasm close to the beginning of TMDIII.
The G118A substitution led to a drastic decrease of function, as shown by a complementation test in the Znhypersensitive mutant zrc1Δ (Figure 2). Indeed, at 15 mM
ZnCl2, only poor growth was measured even with a high
plating density.

X = any amino acid
[ ] = one of the amino acid between brackets is possible
{ } = any amino acid except those between braces
When scanned against the three available databases, the
original signature [15] matched with a total of 366
sequences, while the new proposed signature matched
with 930 hypothetical CDFs.
The tentative signature thus covers the second transmembrane helix, the start of the third TMD and the cytosolic
loop connecting the two TMDs (Figure 1). The loop

To check the localisation of the mutant protein, a GFP
fused version was expressed in zrc1Δ. In common with the
wild type PtdMTP1, the mutant G118A protein still localised on the tonoplast, and the loss of function was thus
not due to a mis-localisation of the mutant protein. A
number of mutagenesis analyses on prokaryotic zinc, or
iron-zinc CDFs [14,29-31] did not include the substitution of this highly conserved glycine residue (Table 1).
From the sequence alignment, other amino acids were
widely conserved, in particular charged and other polar
residues in the amphipathic TMDs II, V and VI. These residues correspond, in PtdMTP1, to the aspartate residues

located on TMDs II, V and VI (D86, D93, D264 and
D288) and the histidine residues located on TMDs II and
V (H89 and H260). The residues are likely to be involved
in cation transport and/or binding; indeed when changed
they affected the function of bacterial CDF members
([14,29-31] and Table 1). These six amino acids were individually substituted by alanine or by a residue that conserves the charge (glutamate instead of aspartate or lysine
instead of histidine). Substitutions of all six residues
resulted in the loss of PtdMTP1 function, in accord with
the results of mutagenesis studies performed in prokaryotic members (Table 1 and [14,29-31]). None of the mutations tested displayed a hypersensitive phenotype, that is
inhibition of growth at non toxic Zn2+ concentration (≤ 10
mM ZnCl2). For D288A and D288E substitutions, vesiclelike localisations were observed, while the other PtdMTP1
variants still localised to the tonoplast.
Phylogenetic tree of the CDF family
Phylogenetic analysis using Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
method was carried out on the 273-protein alignment,
resulting in the tree shown in Figure 3 (see Methods). To
avoid biased group distribution due to the extended N or
C termini typical of some CDF transporters (e.g. ScMsc2,
HsZTL1, HsZnT5), only the CDF domain was taken for
the phylogenetic tree reconstruction. In particular, the
start was set about 40 amino acids upstream from the first
TMD, which corresponds to the first amino acid of
AtMTP4, and the end was set about 40 amino acids after
the Cation Efflux domain, corresponding to the last
amino acid of ScZrg17. At the N terminus, with respect to
the alignment, about 50% of the proteins started
upstream from the first methionine of AtMTP4, with an
average of 122 residues. At the C terminus, the alignment

showed more conserved sequences and about 80% of proteins passed after the stop codon of Zrg17, with an average
of 25 residues. Additional phylogenetic analysis using the
Maximum Parsimony (MP) method (MEGA 3.1) was performed and gave congruent topologies confirming the
confidence of the clustering (data not shown). Based on
tree topology and confidence on nodes (bootstrap values
>50), we defined 13 clusters containing characterised
sequences (Figure 4), which were named by referring to
one characterised member (usually the first identified).
The ZnT9-like cluster contained murine and human ZnT9,
previously called HUEL, that also have significant homology with a DNA-binding domain and a nuclear receptor
interaction motif. ZnT9/HUEL was demonstrated to be
predominantly localized to the cytoplasm and to translocate to the nucleus during the S phase of the cell cycle [34].
To avoid misleading labelling, the cluster containing the
Mn2+ transporter ShMTP1 was named MTP8 (AtMTP8 is
the orthologue of ShMTP1 in Arabidopsis thaliana), following the nomenclature proposed for Arabidopsis at the
PlantsT World Wide Web site [35]. Eleven of these 13 clusters clustered into three groups (Figure 3), which are
detailed below. We hypothesized that proteins belonging
to the same group may share the same metal specificity.
Thus, for those transporters whose substrate is not known,
the position within one of these groups may suggest the
metal specificity.
Group I: zinc-CDFs
The first group included phyla specific members, such as
the Zrc1-like, DmeF-like, ZitB-like, the ZnT1-like, and
ZnT6-like clusters. The Zrc1-like cluster comprised only
fungal CDFs originating from Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, and Zygomycetes. The bacterial specific DmeF-like

Effect of amino acid substitution on the ability of PtdMTP1 to protect against Zn2+ toxicity in yeast. The Znhypersensitive yeast strain zrc1Δ, transformed with pYES2 bearing the mutated variants of PtdMTP1 was grown at 30°C in SD
with 2% galactose (SD) until O.D. 600 nm = 1. Serial dilutions were spotted on SD or on SD + 15 mM ZnCl2 (15 mM Zn). Photographs were taken after 6 days of growth at 30°C. For each mutation different yeast transformants were used and gave the
same results. The amino acid substitutions along with their topological positions are shown on the left. EV: empty vector;

Phylogenetic tree of the CDF family
Phylogenetic tree of the CDF family. The Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree based on the protein alignment was created
with MEGA 3.1. Clusters are represented with different colours with respect to metal specificity: blue is for zinc, green for
iron/zinc, violet for manganese and brown for unknown specificity. The three CDF groups are surrounded with coloured
boxes with the same colour-code. Bootstrap values are indicated for each cluster. The scale bar indicates an evolutionary distance of 0.1 amino acid substitution per site.

and ZitB-like clusters included DmeF from Cupriavidus
(synonym Ralstonia, or Wautersia) metallidurans CH34
which is a broad specificity transporter with a preference
for Co2+ and Zn2+ [12], and the EcZitB protein from E. coli,
which mainly transports Zn2+ and Cd2+ [6]. The ZitB-like
cluster further clustered into two subclusters, one containing only members from Proteobacteria and the other only
members from the Firmicute phylum. The ZnT1-like and
ZnT6-like clusters comprised only metazoan sequences.
Close to the ZitB-like cluster was a branch containing
another Zn2+ (Co2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+) transporter from C.
metallidurans, RmCzcD, the first identified CDF member

[10,29]. Additionally, this first group also included the
Msc2-like and ZnT2-like clusters containing CDF members from fungi, metazoans and plants. The Msc2-like
cluster included the 12-TMD members from plants, one
for each of A. thaliana, Populus trichocarpa and Oryza sativa,
the 12-TMD transporter Msc2 from S. cerevisiae and its
homologs from Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, and Zygomycetes (one for each species), and the human 12-TMD
HsZTL1 and the 15-TMD HsZnT5 transporters. The
human Zn2+ transporter HsZnT7 and its orthologue from
the fly Drosophila melanogaster were also present in this
cluster. Finally the ZnT2-like cluster contained plant

more than one metal is transported, the metal preference is reflected by the written order within these metals. For each group
and for Zrg17-like and ZnT9-like clusters logos showing the conserved residues in TMDs II and V are shown on the right. A

members distributed in three subclusters, one sequence
from the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, one from Alveolata (Cryptosporidium parvum), one from the Zygomycete
Rhizopus oryzae, and a subcluster of sequences from mammals and flies. Sequences belonging to the ZnT2-like and
ZitB-like clusters, together with RmCzcD, corresponded to
the CDF2 group described by Nies [4], while the DmeFlike and Msc2-like clusters matched with the CDF1 group
[4]. Concerning the classification proposed by Gaither
and Eide in 2001[3], the ZitB-like, Znt1-like, and MSC2like clusters belonged to the CDF subfamily II and ZnT6like, ZnT2-like, and Zrc1-like clusters to the CDF subfamily III [3].
Several CDF transporters belonging to Group I have been
biochemically characterised; metal specificities have been
mainly investigated by heterologous complementation,
and also inferred from the phenotypes shown by genespecific mutants, or over-expression of the transporter.
Few transporters have been studied in reconstituted proteoliposomes or in everted membrane vesicles (Figure 4).
Even though the substrate specificity shown in reconstituted proteoliposomes does not necessarily reflect the
physiological substrate(s) in vivo, this technique is often
used to study transporter kinetic mechanisms. In the
ZnT2-like cluster, the plant transporters AtMTP1, AtMTP3,
TgMTP1, and PtdMTP1 and the mammalian RnZnT2,
MmZnT3, HsZnT3, and MmZnT4 [13,23,26,36-39] have
been characterised. Other characterised members include
the two orthologs RnZnT1 and MmZnT1 [40] from the
Zn-T1-like cluster; HsZnT6 [41] from the ZnT6-like cluster; and ScMsc2, MmZnT5, HsZnT7, and HsZTL1 [1921,42] from the Msc2-like cluster. Almost all these CDFs
specifically transport Zn2+; only AtMTP1 displayed a low
affinity for Cd2+ in reconstituted proteoliposomes (100fold lower than Zn2+) and TgMTP1 was shown to be able
also to confer Ni2+, Cd2+, and Co2+ tolerance when overexpressed in yeast [13,26]. The other characterised members of Group I display a broader specificity. For example,
RmCzcD from C. metallidurans is able to bind Zn2+, Co2+,
Cu2+, and Ni2+ [29] and to alleviate Zn2+, Co2+ and Cd2+
toxicity when over-expressed in bacteria [10]; EcZitB, BsCzcD (ZitB-cluster), and DmeF are Zn2+ and Co2+/Cd2+
transporters, as measured in reconstituted proteoliposomes or in everted membrane vesicles [6,8,12]; the fungal ScZrc1, ScCot1, and SpZhf1 (Zrc1-like cluster) are Zn2+
and Co2+/Cd2+ transporters, as deduced by the gene-specific mutant phenotypes [43-45]. Hence CDF Group I
contains characterised members that at least transport
zinc (Figure 4). Other potential substrates are Co2+, Cd2+,
and Ni2+, but neither Fe2+ nor Mn2+ are reported among
the substrates. This group will be referred to as the ZnCDF group.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/107

Group II: iron/zinc-CDFs
This group includes the bacterial FieF-like and WmFieFlike clusters and the fungal MMT-like cluster (Figure 3).
The MMT-like cluster comprises only fungal sequences
from Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, and Zygomycetes
(one for each species, with the exception of S. cerevisiae).
MgMamB and sequences belonging to the FieF-like cluster
were classified in the CDF3 group by Nies [4], and MMTlike and FieF-like clusters were classified in CDF subfamily
I by Gaither and Eide [3]. Remarkably, the few characterised members of this group transport iron, among the
other metals Zn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, but do not transport
Mn2+. This is best illustrated by the bacterial iron transporters FieF from E. coli [7], MgMamB from Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense [46], and by the mitochondrial yeast
iron transporters ScMMT1 and ScMMT2 [47]. WmFieF
from C. metallidurans is mainly involved in Fe2+ detoxification, although it also mediates resistance against other
metals such as Zn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+, as shown by
overexpression in E. coli or in C. metallidurans metal sensitive mutants [12]. Site directed mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses in EcFieF demonstrated
that Zn2+, Cd2+, and Fe2+ are coordinated by four amino
acids belonging to TMDs II (D45 and D49) and V (H153
and D157) [31]. This group will be referred to as the Fe/
Zn-CDF group.
Group III: manganese-CDFs
This group comprises MTP8-like sequences (bootstrap
value = 91), including the well characterised ShMTP1 and
its paralogs ShMTP2, ShMTP3, and ShMTP4 from S.
hamata [11], as well as the fungal PiMnT1 transporter
from Paxillus involutus (D. Blaudez, M. Chalot, unpublished data) and the plant transporters AtMTP11 from A.
thaliana and PtrMTP9, PtrMTP11.1, and PtrMTP11.2 from
P. trichocarpa (B Montanini, D. Blaudez, M. Chalot,
unpublished data and [48]). Within this group, the plant
and fungal members clustered in specific subgroups and
the fungal members further clustered into four subgroups
(Figure 3). Magnaporthe grisea, Neurospora crassa, and
Stagonospora nodorum had one transporter in each subgroup, whereas other fungi had one to three transporters,
distributed in the four subgroups. The recent availability
of annotated genomes from Candida species (Broad Institute [49]), allowed the identification of MTP8-like members also in yeast (one member for each Candida yeast
genome clustered in the same subgroup). This distribution suggested that a MTP8-like transporter was lost in
some yeasts (S. cerevisiae, for example) and that two duplication events probably occurred during the evolution of
filamentous fungi. Finally, the MTP8-like cluster also contained three CDFs from the worm Caenorhabditis elegans,
three from the alga C. reinhardtii, and two from the Entamoebidae Entamoeba histolytica. Mammalian and prokaryotic CDFs were not found within this cluster; indeed

Page 9 of 16

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:107

BLASTP searches against complete mammalian or
prokaryotic genomic databases, using MTP8-like
sequences as query, did not match with any sequence.
Sequences belonging to the MTP8 cluster may have originated from a common eukaryotic ancestor and spread in
metazoa (C. elegans), fungi, algae, plants, and protists (E.
histolytica). Further duplication events in different phyla
generated the plant and fungal subgroups, while some
phyla (e.g. mammals) apparently lost this type of CDF
(Figure 3). Most interestingly, the nine characterised CDFs
were able to complement specifically the growth defect of
the yeast strain pmr1Δ on high manganese concentration,
and did not support growth of other metal-hypersensitive
strains, thus suggesting that they are specifically involved
in manganese homeostasis or tolerance ([11,48], Figure 4
and unpublished data). This group will be referred to as
the Mn-CDF group.
Additionally, the human ZnT9 protein clustered with
plant, algal and bacterial CDF members in the ZnT9-like
cluster, and this was thus the only mixed prokaryoticeukaryotic CDF cluster (Figure 3). BLASTP analysis using
ZnT9-like sequences as query showed that this CDF cluster was present in other mammalian genomes (mouse,
orang-utan, and dog), in other metazoans, in plants, in
Archaea and in Eubacteria. Mammalian Znt9 proteins
were classified in CDF subfamily I by Gaither and Eide [3].
The distant Zrg17 cluster contained only members from
Ascomycetes, implying that this CDF cluster was specific
to this class of fungi. Indeed, BLASTP analyses against
public databases using Zrg17-like sequences as a query
retrieved sequences only from Ascomycetes.
Features related to group specificity
We further searched for residues that could represent candidate sites of functional divergence of the CDF groups.
Remarkably, Mn-CDF sequences could be differentiated
by the consensus sequence DxxxD (x = any amino acid) in
TMD V, which appears as HxxxD in all other CDF
sequences from the Zn- and Fe/Zn-CDFs, D being the
highly conserved aspartate residue important for CDF
function ([14,29,30] and Table 1). In Zrg17-like and in
ZnT9-like clusters, sequences did not match with any of
these patterns, since TxxxS/T and VxxxD patterns were
found in the same topological positions, respectively (Figure 4). When the TMD V region was excluded from the
alignment, the tree topology and bootstrap values did not
change appreciably, suggesting that the close phylogenetic
relationships were not only based on TMD V amino acid
conservation. Since the group-conserved H/D residue is
four residues distant the highly conserved aspartate within
TMD V, the two residues will interact on the same face of
the α-helix. These residues may play important but different roles in the CDF groups. In EcFieF the corresponding
residue, H153, is one of the four amino acids that directly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/107

coordinates ions during binding and transport and it faces
the cytosolic side of the membrane [31]. The cysteine thiolate, histidine imidazole, and aspartate/glutamate carboxylate have similar properties as ligand groups for Fe2+
and Zn2+ metals, while Mn2+, like other hard metals, prefers carboxylate toward N-imidazole ligand group [50]. In
the Zn-CDF PtdMTP1 the corresponding histidine located
on TMD V was changed to aspartate. The H260D substitution in PtdMTP1 led to the loss of any detectable function
in Zn2+ homeostasis, without changing the protein localisation, demonstrating that these aspartate and histidine
residues do not have the same role (Figure 2). However
the H260D variant of PtdMTP1 was not able to complement the manganese-hypersensitive strain pmr1Δ.
In TMD II a histidine (Zn-CDF)/aspartate (Mn-CDF) residue is conserved within each specific group, although in
the Fe/Zn-CDF group, both aspartate (FieF-like cluster)
and histidine (MMT-like and WmFieF-like clusters) are
present (Figure 4). These residues reside four amino acids
upstream from the highly conserved aspartate in TMD II
and in EcFieF they correspond to D45, one of the four
metal coordination residues that is located close to the
non cytosolic side of the membrane [31].
Another key structural feature is the presence of a histidine-rich region in most CDFs, except the Mn-CDF, the
ZnT9-like, FieF-like, and WmFieF-like transporters (Figure
4). Most Zn-CDF transporters usually display histidinerich (or histidine/serine-rich) regions at N, C termini in
and/or between TMDs IV and V. The function of the histidine-rich loop was demonstrated in AtMTP1, where the
mutated version lacking the histidine-rich loop was unable to bind Zn2+ [26], while in EcZitB neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal regions were required for function
[30]. In ZnT6-like sequences the histidine-rich loop is
substituted by a serine-rich loop and a histidine/serinerich region is also present at the C-terminus. In ZnT1-like
transporters extra cysteine/serine rich regions are found in
the TMDs V-VI loop and at the C terminus.
Mn-CDF members present a serine-rich region at the N
terminal. Sequences belonging to Zrg17-like and MMTlike clusters also have a histidine/serine-rich loop,
although located between TMDs III and IV (Figure 4).
A specific feature of the Zn-CDFs is the presence of few
cysteine residues conserved within some clusters: sulfhydryl moieties are known to have a role in metal binding
(mostly Zn2+ and Cd2+). In the ZnT1-like cluster five
cysteine residues are conserved at the cytosolic C terminus; another cysteine residue is conserved in TMD III in
both ZnT1-like and Zrc1-like clusters; the Msc2-like cluster shows a cysteine residue conserved in all sequences at
TMD III (by referring to the CDF domain). Other cysteine

Page 10 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:107

residues are conserved in the ZnT2-like cluster: in order to
test the importance of these cysteine residues for function
and their conservation during evolution, all five cysteine
residues (C30, C35, C64, C291, and C357) were changed
to serine in the poplar PtdMTP1 member. C30, C64, and
C291 were conserved within the ZnT2-like cluster, and
C35 and C357 were conserved only in the plant members
of this cluster. Substitution of the C35 residue abolished
the function of the transporter, while the C30S and C64S
substitutions only partially affected PtdMTP1 function
(Figure 2). The C291S and C357S substitutions did not
have any effect on Zn2+ tolerance: the expression of these
PtdMTP1 mutated versions allowed growth of the Znyeast hypersensitive strain zrc1Δ up to 20 mM ZnCl2 (Figure 2, Table 1, and data not shown). All the mutant proteins still localised on the tonoplast, as shown by C
terminal chimeric fusion with GFP. To gain insights into
the role of cysteine residue in the oligomerisation of
PtdMTP1, Western blot analyses were performed with the
mutant proteins as previously described [23]. All the
mutant proteins still formed homo-oligomers (data not
shown). The Fe/Zn-CDF group did not have any conserved cysteine residue, while the Mn-CDF group displayed a highly conserved cysteine at the cytosolic side of
TMD IV.

Discussion
A modified signature for the CDF family
In the present work, we propose a modified signature that
better takes into account the newly characterised CDF
transporters. Retrieved at Prosite [33] with the proposed
modified CDF signature, the 930 hypothetical CDFs still
mostly clustered in the three groups, thus suggesting that
a good representative sample of CDF sequences was originally used for analysis. It is possible also to suggest their
substrate specificity: 268 were classified in the Fe/Zn-CDF
group, 561 in the Zn-CDF group, and 39 in the Mn-CDF
group. Few of the sequences originally selected for the
protein alignment used to construct the signature were
not retrieved by the new signature, since the three databases available at Prosite did not include some data from
genome sequencing projects. Some amino acid residues
along the signature were specifically present only in a few
clusters: this is the case of the amino acid at the position
10 (H89 in PtdMTP1, Figure 1) that is always an aspartate
in the Mn-CDF group and in the FieF-like cluster, while a
histidine residue is present in the same position in the ZnCDF group and in MMT-like, WmFieF-like, and ZnT9-like
clusters. At position 14 (D93 in PtdMTP1, Figure 1) aspartate is the most frequent amino acid, although some
sequences belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum displayed a histidine residue in that position. These two positions, along with the fully conserved glycine were the
most critical signature residues, since when changed to
other amino acids many non-CDF sequences were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/107

retrieved. These amino acids are essential for function, as
confirmed by mutagenesis studies (Table 1 and Figure 2),
suggesting that the conservation of these amino acids has
been maintained by evolutionary pressure.
Evolutionary relationships in the CDF family
CDF member distribution in the phylogenetic tree was
not related to organism taxonomy, but rather to substrate
specificity suggesting ancient duplication events followed
by subfunctionalization (metal specialization) in a common ancestor to prokaryotes and eukaryotes. More recent
duplications or gene losses could have arisen in several
taxa and lineages leading to a complex distribution pattern of CDF isoforms (orthologous and paralogous copies) in living organisms. Based on amino acid sequence
similarities and phylogeny of a set of 273 CDF sequences,
and on biochemical features of some well-characterised
CDF members, the CDF family could be divided into
three major groups, one containing Zn-CDF transporters
(ZnT2-like, ZnT1-like, ZnT6-like, Zrc1-like, Msc2-like,
ZitB-like, and DmeF-like clusters), another enclosing Fe/
Zn-CDF transporters (MMT-like, FieF-like, and WmFieFlike clusters) and a third containing only Mn-CDF transporters (MTP8-like sequences) (Figure 3 and Figure 4).

An update of CDF classification is therefore suggested in
order to take into better account phylogenetic and functional features. Three groups are proposed: Zn-CDF, Fe/
Zn-CDF and Mn-CDF. Ten of the 11 clusters belonging to
these groups were already classified in CDF subfamilies by
Nies [4] or by Gaither and Eide [3]. In the particular ZnCDF group contained CDF groups 1 and 2 [4] and CDF
subfamilies II and III [3], while Fe/Zn-CDF group contained CDF group 3 [4] and CDF subfamily I [3]. MTP8like clusters was not present in those classifications
because members belonging to this cluster had not then
been characterised. The Zrg17-like cluster was very distant
from the Zn-CDF group and displayed only a partial signature. It was therefore not included in the Zn-CDF
group, even though it had similar biochemical characteristics. The ZnT9-like cluster (previously classified in CDF
subfamily I [3]) was found to be close to the Mn-CDF
group, but the lack of biochemical characterisation and a
weak bootstrap value (23) prompted us to exclude this
cluster from the Mn-CDF group (Figure 3 and Figure 4).
Sequences belonging to the ZnT9-like cluster might have
an ancient origin from a common ancestor and spread in
bacteria, metazoans, algae, and plants. Its absence in fungal genomes suggests that this type of CDF has been lost
in fungi. The lack of conserved residues in the active site
and the potential DNA binding properties of the mammalian ZnT9 proteins [34] suggest additional or different
roles of these proteins that nonetheless retained high similarity with the CDF family.

The Mn-, the Zn- and Fe/Zn-CDF groups share many conserved residues, suggesting that they derived from a common ancestor. Newly identified CDF members can be
assigned to one of these groups and therefore their substrate specificity can be inferred: for example in plants,
only members belonging to the Zn-CDF [13,23,26,36] or
to the Mn-CDF [11,48] groups have been functionally
characterised. The position of AtMTP6 and orthologous
proteins in the Fe/Zn-CDF group suggests a Fe2+ selectivity
for these CDF members.
The number of transmembrane domains predicted in
each transporter is roughly conserved in each cluster, most
including from 4 to 6 TMDs, depending on the method
used for the prediction. Notably, the Msc2-like cluster
included all members with a relatively high TMD number
(12 TMDs in Msc2, HsZTL1, and AtMTP12, to 15 TMDs in
HsZnT5).
Subcellular localisation of CDF transporters is not always
conserved within clusters. The Fe/Zn-CDF group mainly
contained sequences from prokaryotes (Archaea or Eubacteria) and fungi. The mitochondrial localisation of
ScMMT1 and ScMMT2 [47] corresponds to the plasma
membrane location of the prokaryotic members [7,12].
Within the ZnT2-like cluster, however, plant members
localised either on the tonoplast (AtMTP1 [51], PtdMTP1
[23]) or on the plasma membrane (TgMTP1, [52]), while
mammalian CDF transporters were found on vesicles [3739]. The vacuolar membrane located transporters Zrc1
and Cot1 from S. cerevisiae clustered together with the
reticulum endoplasmic localised Zhf1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe [45].
The relatively high number of Zn-CDFs found in databases compared with the number of Mn-CDFs may reflect
the evolutionary pressure to which the organisms were
subjected. Indeed some Zn-CDFs display a broad specificity, which gives a potentially useful trait to the organism.
The only CDF transporter known to transport Ni2+ (over
Zn2+) is present in the Ni-hyperaccumulator species
Thlaspi goesingense [13]. Similarly DmeF, RmCzcD, and
WmFieF displayed a broad specificity [5,12], and C. metallidurans has been frequently found in sediments and
soils with a high content of various heavy metals from
diverse geographical locations. The need for a Mn2+
detoxification (or homeostasis) system driven by CDF
transporters could have represented a less important pressure during evolution or could act in parallel with other
transport systems (for example the Ca2+/Mn2+ P-type
ATPase Pmr1 in fungi and ECA1 in plants or the cation
exchanger CAX2 in plants [53]).

Functional analyses of the eukaryotic Zn-CDF PtdMTP1
In the present study we identified residues that are crucial
for function in the model eukaryotic Zn-CDF PtdMTP1.
Amino acid substitutions of conserved aspartate and histidine residues in TMDs II and V led to the loss of almost
any detectable function in complementation tests. In
EcFieF four amino acids belonging to TMD II (D45 and
D49) and to TMD V (H153 and D159) are the metal coordination residues that directly interact with the substrate
during binding and transport [31]. The corresponding
amino acids are likely to have the same role in other CDF
transporters, since at least in EcZitB, RmCzcD and
PtdMTP1, substitutions in these residues completely abolish the function (Table 1).

Concerning PtdMTP1, all the mutant proteins were
expressed and localised using GFP to the tonoplast, as
found for the wild type protein [23], with the exception of
the mutant D288A/E proteins that localised on vesiclelike structures (data not shown). Thus for the substitutions D288A/E (TMD VI) we cannot conclude whether the
loss of function was due to the mis-localisation or to a
reduced activity of the transporter. Additionally the
D181E substitution in the corresponding aspartate residue in the Zn2+/Co2+ bacterial transporter RmCzcD prevented the correct membrane localisation and induced a
partial degradation of the mutant protein [29]. Therefore
this aspartate residue appears to be critical for CDF protein stability and localisation in organisms from different
kingdoms. Likewise in the yeast Pmr1, a Golgi-localised
Ca2+/Mn2+ P-ATPase transporter, the substitutions D778E
and D856E in TMD VI and TMD VIII were responsible for
ER retention [54]. The G118A substitution abolished
function as well. The topological position of G118
(upstream from TMD III), its unique conservation pattern
among the CDF transporters and its significance in protein function (at least for PtdMTP1) suggests a role in the
formation of a correct protein structure. Regarding substitutions of cysteine residues, only the C35S substitution
dramatically affected protein function. The four other substitutions resulted in a reduction of PtdMTP1-mediated
zinc resistance (C30S and C64S) or did not affect protein
function (C291S and C375S). Based on its functional role
and its conservation in a well defined phylogenetic group
(plant members of the ZnT2-like cluster), we can hypothesise that the C35 residue has been positively selected
throughout plant evolution and has contributed to adaptation. The possible role of these amino acids in protein
oligomerisation was investigated in this work by Western
blot analysis. Although previous results in the presence of
DTT suggested an oligomerisation mediated by disulfide
bridges [23], the variant proteins still form oligomeric
structures, suggesting that the cysteine residues are dispensable in forming the quaternary structure of PtdMTP1
Zn2+ transporter (data not shown). The conserved cysteine

Page 12 of 16

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:107

residues, located in the N and C termini, are likely to be
involved in substrate binding rather than substrate transport. The occurrence of more than one cysteine residue
might be an indication of redundant function and the
presence of double-substituted cysteine residues might be
necessary to abolish protein function and/or oligomerisation.
Molecular features related to metal specificity
The identification of molecular determinants that may
reflect metal specificity is an interesting research field with
application to bioremediation. Several features may contribute to metal specificity in CDF members, nevertheless
the widely conserved aspartate residues in TMDs II and V
cannot alone be responsible for metal specificity, because
they are conserved in transporters with different metal
specificities. The mechanism of metal selectivity might be
guaranteed by the coordination chemistry in the chemical
context of the immediate binding site neighbourhood.
Zn2+ usually favours a tetrahedral coordination geometry.
Mn2+ and Fe2+ are mainly found in octahedral coordination even though a tetrahedral coordination geometry of
ligands is also favoured by these metals. The amino acids
located in TMD V, four residues upstream from the highly
conserved aspartate, seemed to be candidates of choice for
determination of metal specificity of the Zn- and Fe/ZnCDFs (histidine) or of the Mn-CDFs (aspartate). At least
four features suggested that these residues are likely to be
important in the determination of substrate specificity: (i)
they were not interchangeable, at least in the eukaryotic
Zn2+ transporter PtdMTP1 (Figure 2), (ii) they were specifically conserved within groups (Figure 4), (iii) they
resided in close contact with the highly conserved and
functionally important aspartate, on the polar side of the
amphipathic helix V, (iv) they faced the cytosolic side of
the helix, where they can contact the substrate. These
amino acids correspond to H153 in EcFieF, which is the
closest coordination residue to the cytoplasm, cis to metal
uptake [31]. The H260D variant of PtdMTP1 was not able
to complement the Mn-hypersensitive strain pmr1Δ. We
can thus infer that this histidine residue is necessary for
PdtMTP1-mediated resistance on Zn2+, but we cannot
speculate whether the presence of aspartate, instead of histidine, is sufficient for manganese transport.

The other conserved and amphipathic helices did not contain any completely group-conserved residue that may be
related to metal specificity. Nevertheless this does not
exclude their involvement in conferring metal specificity.
Even if we cannot conclude that the presence of this distinctive amino acid (D or H) may be sufficient to discriminate the substrate, this could be a starting point for
further investigations. Other mechanisms, such as the
interactions with metal chelating proteins or cofactors
and the involvement of histidine rich regions (Figure 4),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/107

have to be taken into account in the first step of metal
binding. Nevertheless the Fe/Zn-CDFs FieF from E. coli
and C. metallidurans do not have any histidine rich-loops
[7,12] (Figure 4). Furthermore, some CDF transporters
have been shown to be active in reconstituted proteoliposomes [6,7,26], demonstrating that at least these transporters did not require any interaction with other proteins
or cofactors to sustain metal transport.

Conclusion
In the present study phylogenetic and functional analyses
have allowed the identification of three major substratespecific CDF groups: Zn-, Fe/Zn-, and Mn-CDF. A modified signature that better fits with the increased number of
hypothetical CDF transporters is described and might be
useful to identify new CDF transporters. The metal specificity of newly identified CDF transporters can be then
deduced by their classification into one of these three
groups, but only an exhaustive functional characterization
of CDF members will allow us to confirm this hypothesis.
In particular the role of the group-conserved aspartate/histidine residue in metal selectivity has to be verified by
complementation tests in other metal-specific sensitive
strains. Moreover site directed mutagenesis analyses on
other regions potentially involved in substrate specificity
and in transporters belonging to the different CDF groups
will be useful in finding the molecular determinants of
metal selectivity of the CDF family.

Methods
Sequence and phylogenetic analyses
Deduced amino acid sequences, belonging to characterised or hypothetical CDF transporters, have been retrieved
from Genebank and SwissProt and from a set of annotated genomes. These include the Archaea Methanosarcina
acetivorans and Methanosarcina mazei, the actinobacteria
Corynebacterium glutamicum and Streptomyces coelicolor, the
cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme, the firmicutes Bacillus
cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium tetani, the proteobacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens, E. coli, Thiomicrospira
crunogena, and C. metallidurans, the alga C. reinhardtii, the
dicotyledonous plants A. thaliana and P. trichocarpa and
the monocotyledonous plant O. sativa, the protist E. histolytica, the Ascomycetes Ashbya gossypii (hemiascomycete),
Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Botrytis cinerea,
Candida albicans, Fusarium graminearum, M. grisea, N.
crassa, S. cerevisiae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and S. nodorum,
the Basidiomycetes Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Ustilago maydis, the Zygomycete R. oryzae; the nematode C. elegans, the insect D. melanogaster, and the mammal Homo
sapiens. Sequences homologous to Zrg17 from S. cerevisiae
were retrieved by BLASTP search in the above-described
genomes, since these members were not annotated.
Sequences that displayed significant truncation have been
discarded. CDF amino acid sequences (see accession

as protein weight matrix, available in MEGA (version 3.1)
[55]. Molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted
using MEGA (version 3.1) [32]: for the construction of the
phylogenetic tree the Maximum Parsimony (MP) or the
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method and the bootstrap (1000
replicates) phylogeny test were applied on the multiple
sequence alignment. Sequence distances were calculated
with the Poisson correction model with uniform rates
among sites.
Logo representation of the CDF signature was constructed
with the web interface program WebLogo [56,57] on the
basis of the alignment of CDF members listed in additional file 1, with the exception of the Zrg17-like
sequences. For TMD II and V representation, alignments
corresponding to each individual cluster or group were
used as queries. The signature was verified at ScanProsite
[33] against all the three available databases (Swiss-Prot,
TrEMBL and PDB Databases), with default settings for pattern options.

synthetic defined (SD) medium with 2% (w/v) galactose,
supplemented as necessary [59]. Yeast cells were transformed as described elsewhere [60]. For metal tolerance
assays, yeast was grown in liquid SD medium (with 2%
[w/v] galactose) at 30°C until O.D. 600 nm = 1, and drop
assays were performed on SD plates containing different
concentrations of Zn2+ or Mn2+.
Site-directed mutagenesis
Mutant PtdMTP1 plasmid clones were generated by oligonucleotide directed PCR mutagenesis, using pYES2PtdMTP1 as a template for the PCR (Table 2). The mutated
versions of PtdMTP1 were cloned in pYES2 and expressed
in the Zn-hypersensitive strain zrc1Δ. Cloning, sitedirected mutagenesis, construction of the expression plasmid pYES2-GFP, and Western blotting analysis were
described previously [23]. The presence of targeted mutations in all plasmid constructs was verified by DNA
sequencing.
