Abstract
Background: Overlapped genes originate by a) loss of a stop codon among contiguous genes
coded in different frames; b) shift to an upstream initiation codon of one of the contiguous genes;
or c) by overprinting, whereby a novel open reading frame originates through point mutation inside
an existing gene. Although overlapped genes are common in viruses, it is not clear whether
overprinting has led to new genes in prokaryotes.
Results: Here we report the origin of a new gene through overprinting in Escherichia coli K12. The
htgA gene coding for a positive regulator of the sigma 32 heat shock promoter arose by point
mutation in a 123/213 phase within an open reading frame (yaaW) of unknown function, most likely
in the lineage leading to E. coli and Shigella sp. Further, we show that yaaW sequences coding for
htgA genes have a slower evolutionary rate than those lacking an overlapped htgA gene.
Conclusion: While overprinting has been shown to be rather frequent in the evolution of new
genes in viruses, our results suggest that this mechanism has also contributed to the origin of a
novel gene in a prokaryote. We propose the term janolog (from Jano, the two-faced Roman god)
to describe the homology relationship that holds between two genes when one originated through
overprinting of the other. One cannot dismiss the possibility that at least a small fraction of the
large number of novel ORPhan genes detected in pan-genome and metagenomic studies arose by
overprinting.

Background
The origin of novelty is one of the central questions in
evolutionary biology. Paralogy, orthology, and xenology,
as well as domain shuffling between genes, account for a
large part of the evolution of protein families at the
sequence level [1]. All these mechanisms require the previous existence of coding sequences. Whether novel
sequences in cells could arise from spontaneous point
mutation remains an open question.

In some cases, two or more genes are known to be
encoded in the same DNA region [2]. Overlapping genes
have been known since the beginning of virus complete
genome sequencing, as exemplified by the gene B of the
single stranded DNA bacteriophage ϕX174, which is completely contained within gene A [3]. It has been suggested
that overlapping genes originate by spontaneous point
mutation due to a mechanism known as overprinting [4].
Overlapping genes could arise by: a) extension of one
ORF into other by loss of a stop codon; b) shift to an

upstream initiation codon in adjacent genes; or by c) generation of a totally new ORF inside a previous existing
ORF by point mutation. The different ways in which two
overlapping genes can be coded are known as phases [5],
and the different phases determine, in turn, the evolutionary pressure that overlapping genes exert on each other
[6,7].
In has been shown that overprinting is an important
mechanism for the origin of new genes in viruses [4,8].
Overlapped genes are also a relative common feature of
prokaryotic genomes. For instance, it has been suggested
that in prokaryotes, where approximately 80% of the
overlaps comprise less than 30 base pairs, the phase of
coding and their distribution, among other characteristics
of overlapping genes are most consistent with the hypothesis that overlaps participate in the regulation of gene
expression [9]. A comparative study among the genomes
of Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae
found that most overlapped genes were generated primarily due to the loss of a stop codon, the absence of which
resulted in elongation of the 3' end of the gene's coding
region [10]. Overlapped genes can also be classified
according to their direction of transcription into three categories, namely "convergent" (-> <-), "unidirectional" (->
->) and "divergent" (<- ->). In a study that included the
analysis of complete genome sequences from 50 bacterial
species [11] it was shown that most overlapped genes are
coded following the unidirectional pattern. This pattern
was confirmed in a comparative study among nine bacteria [12]. Overlapped genes have also been found in mitochondria. For instance, a small protein [UniProtKB:
Q6EMS7] of 66 amino acids (gene A6L) overlaps 40 bases
into the gene coding for ATPase-6 in bovine mitochondria
[13]. Because the formation of overlapping genes necessarily involves the evolution of a coding region from noncoding DNA or from a different frame in coding DNA,
their study might help to understand de novo evolution of
coding regions [5]. The pattern of natural selection among
71 pairs of 3' overlapping genes (all of them having an
overlap larger than 15 nucleotides) conserved at least in
two prokaryotic genomes showed a statistically significant
bias toward the 123/132 phase, thus ensuring the least
mutual constraint on non-conservative amino acid
replacements in both overlapping coding sequences [5].
Here, we show that the mechanism of overprinting has
also contributed to the origin of a new gene of identifiable
function in Escherichia coli.

Results
We have identified a possible case of evolution of a new
gene and a new function by overprinting in E. coli K12.
The overlapping genes are the gene for the positive regulator for sigma 32 heat shock promoter (htgA) [UniProtKB:P28697] and the gene yaaW [UniProtKB:P75617],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/31

whose hypothetical protein product has been classified as
an Unidentified Protein Family 0174 in Pfam database
[Pfam:UPF0174] (Figure 1). The genes are coded in the
123/213 phase (htgA in the (+) strand, and yaaW in the () strand), meaning that the third nucleotide of the (+)
codon overlaps with the 3 nucleotide of the (-) codon. The
overlap comprises the 591 nucleotides of the full htgA
gene.
Although NCBI gene annotation tables provide coordinates for the position of genes in genomes, caution should
be taken, since over-annotation and sequencing errors
might mislead the identification of true genes. While there
is in vitro experimental evidence for the existence of htgA
[14], this does not hold true for yaaW. Therefore, we have
searched for indirect evidence for its existence by asking
whether there are: a) yaaW homologs in other genomes;
b) domain fusions of homologs to the yaaW protein product with other protein domains; and c) detectable biases
in the ratio of synonymous (ps) versus non-synonymous
(pn) substitutions, i.e., departures from neutrality (ps ≠
pn) among yaaW sequences that would suggest the action
of natural selection.
Phylogenetic distribution of htgA and yaaW genes
According to NCBI gene annotation tables, htgA is present
in three E. coli and one Shigella flexneri strains. Furthermore, based on i) sequence similarity; ii) ORF prediction
by ORF Finder; and iii) lowered rates of sequence evolution of yaaW sequences containing overlapped htgA genes
(see below), we suggest that homologs to htgA are also
present in all the other E. coli and Shigella sp. genomes
analyzed here, adding up to a total of nine htgA sequences

(Figure 2). On the other hand, yaaW has a wider phylogenetic distribution. This gene is present in 16 γ-proteobacteria and three ε-proteobacteria. yaaW can be identified as
a highly divergent sequence in Nostoc sp PCC7120 a filamentous cyanobacteria and in a fusobacteria. In contrast
with htgA, which is present as a single copy, some of the
genomes analyzed here have paralogous copies of yaaW
homologs. There are two genomes endowed with more
than one copy of yaaW; Helicobacter pylori J99 has two copies, while H. pylori 26695 has three copies. In total, we
detected 24 homologs of yaaW. Since there are three pairs
of identical sequences at the nucleotide level (each pair is

coded on different strains from the same specie), there are
only 21 UniProtKB codes (Figure 2). Multiple sequence
alignment of yaaW protein coding genes is shown in Additional file 1. The wider phylogenetic distribution of yaaW
suggests that htgA originated by overprinting in an ancestral copy of extant yaaW sequences (Complete names of
proteins are given in Additional file 2).
We detected no homologs among viruses to the protein
product of htgA in the non-redundant database. Besides a
small similarity of the DnaC protein [UniProtKB:Q9AZV4] from Lactococcus phage bIL286 (41

amino acids identities along 152 residues, and BLAST evalue of 1.7) to the yaaW protein product. This appears to
be a false positive since similarity was not confirmed by
Pfam database. These negative results strongly suggest, but
do not prove, that yaaW and htgA did not originate in a
viral genome.

GTPase domain [Pfam:MMR_HSR1] in Shewanella sp. and
Campylobacter coli, which has a wide phylogenetic distribution but unknown function. yaaW is also fused to a
fraction of this domain in the γ-proteobacteria Idiomarina
loihiensis (Figure 2). This GTPase domain is fused in other
proteins with a domain of unknown function:
[Pfam:DUF933] related to the ubiquitin and to another
GTPase domain [Pfam:GTP1_OBG] which have been
shown to be important in normal cell metabolism in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe [15]. The fusion of some yaaW
homologs to a GTPase domain suggests that yaaW codes
for a functional protein. On the other hand, there is no
available Pfam domain for the htgA gene at the time
being.

Protein domain identification of yaaW and htgA coded
proteins
The yaaW coded proteins match to [Pfam:UPF0174] profile in Pfam database, the only exception is the hypothetical protein alr3689 [UniProtKB:Q8YQX2] from Nostoc
sp. PCC 7120 that exhibits a marginal HMMER E-value of
0.048, comprising 156 amino acids out of 185 (0.01 is
considered significant in Pfam). However, a BLAST search
of E. coli yaaW coded protein sequence [UniProtKB:P75617] to our database of proteins from complete genomes matches the cyanobacterial protein
alr3689 sequence with a significant e-value of 2e-05
BLAST to a 86 amino acid stretch of the protein. The protein alr3689 seems to be a highly divergent homolog of
yaaW having the UPF0174 domain. yaaW has fused to a

Phylogenetic analysis
With the exception of the sequence from Nostoc sp. that
branches among the proteobacteria, the phylogeny of
yaaW coded proteins conforms approximately to canonical rRNA-based tree (Figure 3).

Synonymous versus non-synonymous substitutions
The relationship between synonymous (ps) versus nonsynonymous (pn) substitutions among all pairs of yaaW
sequences is shown in Figure 4a. The dashed oval indicates comparisons between group A and B sequences (as
defined in Figure 3). In figure 4b, the values of pn and ps
are plotted against Kimura distances for each pair of yaaW
sequences. As shown, the excess of synonymous versus
non-synonymous substitutions is suggestive of purifying
selection. This excess is especially important between
sequences belonging to group A and group B (Figure 4c),
indicating a higher degree of restriction to non-synonymous changes imposed by htgA on yaaW sequences. Purifying selection is statistically significant for all yaaW
sequences (Table 1).

The pattern of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions among htgA sequences also suggests purifying
selection (Table 1). However this pattern could be the
reflection of the accumulation of purifying mutations
among yaaW genes and the 123/213 phase of the overlap.
Therefore, synonymous and non-synonymous mutations
in yaaW will affect the similarly to htgA. This is an unexpected pattern for a novel sequence since it has been
shown that new genes originating through overprinting in
viruses show an excess of non-synonymous substitutions,
indicating the action of positive natural selection [8].
Lower rate of evolution of yaaW sequences with
overlapped htgA genes
DNA sequences coding for overlapped genes are expected
to evolve at a lower rate than those DNA sequences coding
for only one gene [6,7]. Accordingly, we have analyzed the
substitution rates of closely related yaaW genes with and
without the overlapped htgA using a non-parametric relative rate test [16] for all combinations of three sequences
consisting of an out-group (O) sequence, and two ingroup (A and B) sequences (see methods and Figure 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/31

In-group yaaW sequences lacking the overlap (B
sequences in Figure 3) have accumulated more exclusive
mutations (m2 changes in Figure 5) in the first 409 nucleotides than those in-group yaaW genes endowed with the
overlap (A sequences in Figure 3 and m1 changes in Figure
5). This suggests that htgA exerts an evolutionary pressure
to yaaW in their first 409 nucleotides. Accordingly, we
have subdivided the yaaW alignment in two sections. The
first one comprises nucleotides 1 to 408, while the second
one includes nucleotides 409 to 714. We have then
applied the Tajima test [16] to both sections independently. As seen in Figure 6, many of the differences are significant at α = 0.05 for the first 408 nucleotides, and for
some comparisons even at the α = 0.01 level. This is particularly true for the genes encoding for [UniProtKB:
O26107] and [UniProtKB: Q9ZJ24] protein sequences
(they also align best with A and B sequences). However,
not all comparisons give statistically significant results. It
is likely that signal erosion in sequences having experienced more substitutions may explain in part lack of statistically significant results in some relative rate tests, since
there seems to be a tendency of lower Chi-square values
towards increasing genetic distance (Figure 6).

Discussion
Ever since Darwin, homology in biology has been
explained by common descent. With the advent of the
molecular structure of nucleic acids and proteins, the concept of homology was further refined to describe more
precisely the phylogenetic relationships among genes
(reviewed in [17]). Accordingly, genes separated by speciation events are referred as orthologs, genes duplicated
inside the same genome are named as paralogs, and horizontally transferred genes are known as xenologs. Further
on, in symbiogenesis lineages of homologous genes previously separated by lineage divergence, became associated in a single cellular system. The term synology has been
proposed to describe the phylogenetic relationship
among such genes [18]. However, no terminology has
been employed to describe the phylogenetic relationship

Other cases of novel genes have been described (i.e., Jingwey, [19]; Sphinx, [20];Morpheus [21]) and the origin of
novel sequences through overprinting in viruses is well
documented [4,8]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a novel gene originated
through overprinting has been carefully described in a
cell.
Caution should be taken since the existence of the htgA
gene remains controversial. Although the gene has been
cloned and its product originally characterized as a positive regulator of sigma 32 heat shock promoter [14], a
recent study shows that this gene is not induced by sigma
32 as previously suggested [22]. Moreover, the initiation
codon of htgA have recently being changed [23] and one
of the predicted copies of htgA (Figure 2) has a smaller size
due to a non-sense mutation. Given that there has not
been more experimental work carried on htgA, we rely on

indirect evidence of its existence based on the statistically
significant lowering rate of evolution of those sequences
putatively coding for htgA. It is worth mentioning that
available evidence for the role of htgA included cloning of
the htgA gene, RNA isolation and Northern (RNA) blots,
protein labeling, and promoter mapping experiments
[14]. One possibility for the lack of sigma 32 induction is
that, as suggested by [22], htgA either requires additional
regulators or is not recognized by sigma 32. Our study
should stimulate more research on this subject in order to
elucidate the true nature of htgA.

printing is a clear example of how new protein families
can originate independently from non-coding sequences.
If the new gene (or the new region of the gene resulting
from the loss of a stop codon) is in a different strand or in
a different coding frame than the other overlapping gene,
a new coding sequence is being generated de novo. If this
new coding region is transcribed and translated and the
product is able to fold properly, natural selection could
recruit this protein for some function, and if successful, it
can be fixed in the population, and may in the long term
represent the origin of a new protein/domain family.

There is no available experimental evidence of the existence of the protein product of yaaW. Nevertheless, i) the
existence of homolog sequences to yaaW in different
genomes; ii) the fusion of yaaW sequences to other protein domains (a GTPase domain in this case); and iii) the
higher ratio of ps versus pn substitutions, strongly suggest
that yaaW truly codes for a functional polypeptide. Here
we propose that htgA originated by overprinting (de novo
origination of a new gene from a non-coding frame in
DNA in a prokaryotic genome) at some moment in the
clade leading to E. coli and Shigella flexneri species.

Conclusion

Recently, a survey of genetic diversity on the Sargasso Sea
using shot-gun technology showed the existence of large
number of previously undetected new genes [24]. Using a
different approach, [25] have shown the existence of an
open pan-genome for the species Streptococcus agalactiae.
This indicates that the genome of S. agalactiae is constantly exchanging genes with other organisms in its environment and that novel sequenced genomes from this
species will exhibit an approximate of 30 new genes not
previously found in the other strains. In a recent re-annotation of E. coli genome [23], it was shown that despite
much effort in understanding the functions of each gene,
there still a number of uncharacterized genes unique to
the genome of E. coli (the gene products of unknown
function are divided into those containing a conserved
domain (N = 145, 3.3%), those with (N = 233, 5.3%) or
without (N = 238, 5.3%) a detectable homolog in the
sequence databases). All these approaches suggest the
existence of a large number of as yet uncharacterized new
genes in the biosphere. This opens the possibility that
some of such novel genes arose through point mutation
from coding (overprinting) as well as non-coding
sequences. It also suggests that the origin of the novo
sequences is an ongoing process in prokaryotic evolution.
The number of gene and protein families in the biosphere
continues to be an open area of research. For instance, the
1.69 release of SCOP database has 1536 superfamilies
[26], and this is certainly an underestimate. The origin of
each one of these families continues to be a matter of
debate and several mechanisms may be involved. Over-

We have described the origin of a novel gene of known
function through overprinting in a prokaryote. Due to the
wider phylogenetic distribution of yaaW, parsimony
favors the origin of htgA by overprinting inside an already
existing yaaW gene. The evidence of htgA being a functional gene is experimental [14], while the evidence for
yaaW comes from: i) the existence of homolog sequences
to yaaW in different genomes; ii) the fusion of yaaW
sequences to other protein domains (a GTPase domain in
this case); and iii) and the higher ratio of ps versus pn substitutions among yaaW sequences. Intriguingly there is no
evidence of the action of positive natural selection among
htgA homologs. This can be explained by a high degree of
restriction imposed by yaaW due to the 123/213 phase of
the overlap. The lower rate of evolution of yaaW
sequences having an overlapped htgA gene is explained by
the higher constraints of a DNA sequence coding for two
genes. If our interpretation of the above evidence is correct, it is likely that the origin of de novo sequences from
non-coding DNA in prokaryotes is an ongoing process.

Methods
We have searched for all strict pairs of completely overlapped genes in available E.coli complete genomes. We
have found 227 pairs of such genes (Additional file 3).
After the exclusion of all overlapped genes annotated as:
a) hypothetical; b) related to phages; c) lack of homologs
to one (or both) of the overlapped genes, there are 7 pairs
left. Among these seven pairs, there is experimental evidence for the existence of the hypothetically newer gene
(the one with fewer homologs) only the htgA-yaaW pairs
(three pairs). Among the four pairs left, the pair conformed by the molecular chaperone DnaK (GI identification number: 26245936; 500 homologs found) and the
putative glutamate dehydrogenase (GI identification
number: 26245935; 6 homologs found) looks like a
promising alternative. However we have filed to detect a
difference in the rate of evolution with the method used
here. We have left all the previous information available
through the Additional file 3 for further studies. Therefore, we have selected the htgA-yaaW pair based on the
experimental evidence of the existence of the gene with

fewer homologs (htgA) and the presence of homologs to
the other gene (yaaW) in genomes belonging to different
bacterial species.
Based on the recently re-annotated gene table of E. coli
K12 genome [23] these genes have the following coordinates, yaaW [UniProtKB:P75617] and htgA [UniProtKB:P28697] (yaaW: locustag K-12 ECK0011, left
nucleotide 10643, right nucleotide 11356, direction of
transcription (-); htgA: locustag K-12 ECK0012, left nucleotide 10830, right nucleotide 11315, direction of transcription (+)).
We have searched for all homologs of the protein products of both genes in a database of 416 prokaryotic chromosomes (including main chromosomes and accessory
genetic elements like plasmids) from 251 prokaryotic
organisms using BLAST [27] searches (e value cut-off
0.001) as well as in the NCBI non-redundant database for
virus homologs.
Protein domain identification of homologs thus identified was assigned according Pfam database [28]. Open
reading frames of htgA genes potentially coded in yaaW
sequences were predicted using ORF Finder at NCBI [29].
Genomic coordinates of each of the genes were searched
in NCBI gene annotation tables [30].
Multiple alignment
Multiple sequence alignment of homologs to yaaW protein products was performed using ClustalW [31] as
implemented in Bioedit [32] and edited manually following the alignment of protein family [Pfam:UPF0174]
deposited in Pfam. Conserved residues were identified
using Jalview [33]. DNA sequences of yaaW genes were
aligned following [Pfam:UPF0174] protein sequence
alignment, in order to preserve codon positions in the
multiple DNA sequence alignment.
Phylogenetic analysis
A Minimum-Evolution tree of amino acid sequences
homologs to yaaW protein product was inferred using
Poisson correction, constant rate homogeneity and 100
bootstrap replications, using MEGA3.1 software [34].
Synonymous and non-synonymous differences
The proportion of synonymous (ps) versus non-synonymous (pn) differences were calculated following NeiGojobori method [35] as implemented in MEGA3.1 software [34].
Selection test
In order to understand the pattern of selection (purifying
selection, neutrality or positive selection) we have applied
a large sample Z test as implemented in MEGA3.1 soft-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/31

ware [34] to all pairs of yaaW genes, as well as to all pairs
of htgA homologs.
Relative rate test
A non-parametric relative rate test following Tajima [16]
was applied to all combinations of three sequences consisting of an out-group (O) sequence, and two in-group (A
and B) sequences (see Figure 3 to identify sequences
belonging to each group) using a Perl script RRT.pl available upon request. The analysis was performed using
DNA sequences. The method counts the number of substitutions exclusive of A sequences (m1 substitutions)
against the number of substitutions exclusive of the B
sequences (m2 substitutions), using an out-group
sequence O as a reference to identify such changes. The
statistical significance is evaluated using a Chi-square test.
We have also analyzed if there are rate differences across
the overlap, therefore we have subdivided the multiple
alignment of yaaW homologs in 13 windows of 102
nucleotides each (adjacent windows overlap by 51 nucleotides).
