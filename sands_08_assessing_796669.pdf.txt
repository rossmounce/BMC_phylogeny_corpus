Abstract
Background: Meiofauna – multicellular animals captured between sieve size 45 µm and 1000 µm – are a
fundamental component of terrestrial, and marine benthic ecosystems, forming an integral element of food
webs, and playing a critical roll in nutrient recycling. Most phyla have meiofaunal representatives and
studies of these taxa impact on a wide variety of sub-disciplines as well as having social and economic
implications. However, studies of variation in meiofauna are presented with several important challenges.
Isolating individuals from a sample substrate is a time consuming process, and identification requires
increasingly scarce taxonomic expertise. Finding suitable morphological characters in many of these
organisms is often difficult even for experts. Molecular markers are extremely useful for identifying
variation in morphologically conserved organisms. However, for many species markers need to be
developed de novo, while DNA can often only be extracted from pooled samples in order to obtain
sufficient quantity and quality. Importantly, multiple independent markers are required to reconcile gene
evolution with species evolution. In this primarily methodological paper we provide a proof of principle of
a novel and effective protocol for the isolation of meiofauna from an environmental sample. We also go
on to illustrate examples of the implications arising from subsequent screening for genetic variation at the
level of the individual using ribosomal, mitochondrial and single copy nuclear markers.
Results: To isolate individual tardigrades from their habitat substrate we used a non-toxic density
gradient media that did not interfere with downstream biochemical processes. Using a simple DNA release
technique and nested polymerase chain reaction with universal primers we were able amplify multi-copy
and, to some extent, single copy genes from individual tardigrades. Maximum likelihood trees from
ribosomal 18S, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, and the single copy nuclear gene Wingless
support a recent study indicating that the family Hypsibiidae is a non-monophyletic group. From these
sequences we were able to detect variation between individuals at each locus that allowed us to identify
the presence of cryptic taxa that would otherwise have been overlooked.
Conclusion: Molecular results obtained from individuals, rather than pooled samples, are a prerequisite
to enable levels of variation to be placed into context. In this study we have provided a proof of principle
of this approach for meiofaunal tardigrades, an important group of soil biota previously not considered
amenable to such studies, thereby paving the way for more comprehensive phylogenetic studies using
multiple nuclear markers, and population genetic studies.

Background
Assessing variation within and between species provides
information relating to taxonomic relationships [1,2], as
well as population structure, demographics and biogeographic patterns [3,4]. Microscopic animals that are collectively known as the meiofauna present a series of
challenges to studies of variation. Despite their small size
(generally captured in sieve mesh sizes between 45 µm
and 1000 µm), meiofauna form an integral and vital component of the soil food web, playing a fundamental role
in soil ecosystem processes, particularly in nutrient recycling and decomposition processes. Twenty of the 34 recognised animal phyla have meiofaunal representatives, 5
of which are exclusively meiofaunal [5], the implication
being that in a handful of soil or sediment there is likely
to be a high level of biodiversity. In more extreme environments, such as those of the Antarctic, meiofauna may
constitute the majority of, and in some cases the only,
metoazoan element present in the soil ecosystem [6-8].
Meiofauna are a focus of research from many sub-disciplines (including epidemiology, ecology, soil science,
agriculture, aquaculture, and pollution monitoring), as
well as providing model organisms for studies of evolutionary development (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans) and the evolution of sex (bdelloid rotifers). These
tiny animals are difficult to see, often smaller than the particulate matter that comprises the substrata they inhabit,
and thus difficult to separate from sediment, detritus and
non-target species. Within taxonomic groupings there
may be few visible distinguishing characters, and those
that are present may be subtle, requiring specialist and
increasingly scarce taxonomic expertise [9]. Nevertheless,
accurate species identification is an essential first step to
any scientific study.
Molecular phylogenetic techniques take advantage of
developments in our ability to detect variation in DNA,
effectively increasing the resolution available in comparison with morphological or phenotypic variation. This can
be particularly useful when dealing with morphologically
conserved groups. Each base change in a DNA sequence is
analogous to a distinct morphological character in a phylogenetic analysis, which means many hundreds of characters can potentially be included in a single gene analysis.
Models have been developed to take rates of evolution
and homoplasy into account [10,11] providing molecular
phylogenetic inference with a robust theoretical basis
[12]. The concept that variation in a suitable and defined
length of DNA sequence may be used as a bar code for
species identification is becoming increasingly appreciated [13,14].
An important advantage of molecular data is that independent replication is possible. A phylogeny based on a
single gene provides information regarding the history of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/7

and relationships between the taxa sampled. However,
the information is limited to the occurrence of mutations
and results in what is known as the genetree/species tree
problem [15]. A significant event in the history of a lineage will only be recorded in a phylogeny if a mutation
occurs at or just after the event. Conversely a high mutation rate may lead to a confused signal in cases where, for
instance, an informative mutation reverts back to its
ancestral state, or further changes to a state present in
another lineage (homoplasy). Furthermore, there are
processes, such as selection, that may affect the evolution
of a gene, thereby confusing the signal of evolutionary history of the organism. These caveats may be at least partly
countered by conducting independent analyses on several
unlinked genes in order to generate a general consensus of
phylogenies that more closely reflects the "true" evolutionary history, or by concatenating sequences to produce
a super phylogeny [16].
It is often not appreciated that transferring molecular
techniques from the few "model" organisms that are the
focus of intense laboratory research to the more numerous but less studied groups is not straightforward. Conversely, molecular ecologists who work on meiofauna and
other invertebrates may be surprised when they find their
difficulties are not appreciated by the wider scientific
community. DNA quantity is a major issue with tiny
organisms. To increase DNA yield, the whole organism or,
more often several pooled individuals, are used in extractions and, thus, problems with contaminants from gut
contents or commensal organisms arise [17,18]. The difficulties working with understudied species are often only
evidenced by the lack of published literature available. For
example, as far as we are aware, there have only been three
assessments made of intraspecific variation in any species
of the meiofaunal phylum Tardigrada [19-21]. This may
be partially due to tardigrades and other meiofaunal
groups falling outside economic and charismatic categories that influence the direction of science programs, but it
is also likely to be due to the difficulties involved in
obtaining genetic data from these members of the meiofaunal community. Recently a variety of techniques have
been developed or demonstrated as suitable for DNA
extraction from a variety of meiofauna [2,22-25] providing a basis for basic evolutionary studies and the development of molecular tools for identification or classification
[20,22,23,26].
Tardigrades are found in most terrestrial, freshwater and
marine habitats, including some remote Antarctic nunataks where they are found in the absence of the otherwise
ubiquitous nematodes [6]. They are one of the few phyla
with representatives found from the highest and coldest
terrestrial environments to the deepest oceans. They have
featured in high impact publications mostly due to their

uncertain phylogenetic position in the tree of life [27-30],
although their ubiquitous distribution makes them ideal
candidates for historical biogeographic reconstruction
[31-33]. Molecular phylogenetic work to date is strongly
concordant with morphological based systematics [29],
supporting both tardigrade monophyly and monophyly
in the constituent classes Eutardigrada and Heterotardigrada [17,24,34].
In this paper we describe a method that enables the quantitative and qualitative assessment of morphology and
genetic variation among individual tardigrades. The
method includes a novel technique for separating all
organisms from their substrate as compared with "cherrypicking" visible organisms under a dissecting microscope,
a simple DNA release technique applicable at the individual level, and a general protocol for amplifying genomic
DNA from multicopy and single copy genes. Previous
studies have amplified multi-copy 18S and high-copy
number (CO1) genes from tardigrades [2,20,25,26], but
this is the first time single copy nuclear genes have been
amplified from genomic DNA extracted from a single tardigrade. We demonstrate that this method allows for
informed re-assessment of morphological variation,
allows independent replication of phylogenetic analyses
and is suitable for assessing within population variation
enabling population genetic studies.

Results and Discussion
Sample collection and preparation
Separating meiofauna from the substrate can be done in
two ways: "cherry-picking" individuals using a pipette or
Irwin loop under a microscope, or mechanically separation, usually using a density gradient. "Cherry-picking" is
a fast technique if only a few specifically targeted individuals are required and the organisms are easily identifiable
from the substrate. However, if quantitative biomass and
diversity data are required this technique will be biased
towards larger, vagile and more or less pigmented organisms (depending upon which contrasts with the substrate). Where quantitative and qualitative results are
required to extract all individuals from a substrate the
cherry-picking approach is inappropriate and such studies
have adopted mechanical separation using density gradients [see [35]]. However, the media used, such as Ludox
AM (Dupont, France) [35-37], Percoll (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) [38] or 50% sucrose [39] may have detrimental downstream effects, particularly for PCR. Using
OptiPrep™ – Density Gradient Media (Axis-Shield, UK)
we were able to isolate and identify all individual tardigrades and eggs from habitat substrata (see methods).
Substrata used included fresh, frozen and dried herbarium
moss specimens. Contrasting with previous protocols
OptiPrep is non-ionic, non-toxic and does not require
washing to remove the media. It has been used to fraction-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/7

ate sub-cellular organelles and does not interfere with
marker enzyme activities, allowing fractions of cell
organelles to be analyzed without removal of the gradient
medium [40]. In the current study it proved to be clean
and efficient at extracting meiofauna from substrata,
allowing biodiversity and biomass from each sample to
be determined, and detailed morphological examination
without affecting subsequent DNA extraction or downstream biochemical processes. Furthermore, tardigrades
extracted from fresh and frozen samples remained alive
after the extraction process.
DNA extraction
Taking into account the limited amount of DNA available
in a single tardigrade we opted for a DNA release method
rather than an extraction method to maximise the amount
of DNA available. We trialled several different release
methods (NaOH digestion, [22]; TE/ddH2O boil, [41];
Proteinase K freeze thaw cycles, [23]). All these techniques
were sufficient for amplification of 18S rDNA, as many
more expensive commercial kits have proven to be [24].
However, we found a 20 min boil in 40 µL of 5% chelex
the most reliable technique across all gene regions, possibly because the chelex beads inactivate inhibitors that
would otherwise prevent reliable amplification. Obviously the risk of contamination and competition in PCR
is significant and all precautions are advised to prevent
inadvertent introduction of foreign DNA. Fortuitously
this technique is cheap and rapid and the only reagent
necessary (Chelex 100 – BIORAD) is inexpensive and
readily available in many molecular laboratories.
DNA quantification
In order to quantify DNA concentration we used a
PicoGreen™ assay (Molecular Probes), a sensitive technique for determining concentrations of DNA in a solution. After extensive optimization to reduce the volumes
of template required and level of background fluorescence, we were unable to detect DNA in any of our extractions. However, we were able to successfully amplify
ribosomal 18S and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) products from most of our tardigrade extractions – even from animals extracted from rehydrated
herbarium samples that had been stored dry for 15 years.
Recently Kiel et al [42] extracted 8.4 µg of genomic DNA
from ~2000 pooled Hypsibius klebelsbergi, indicating that
each tardigrade contributed ~4.2 ng of DNA to the extract.
For amplification using polymerase chain reaction, 20 –
50 ng of DNA is usually recommended in a 1 µL volume.
Clearly this will never be possible at individual level for
many meiofaunal groups – particularly tardigrades – making studies of individuals rather than pooled samples
challenging. Even with the advent of whole genome
amplification, to achieve representative amplification of
the genome a minimum starting quantity of 1 µl of 10 ng/

µL is recommended (GE HealthCare: GenomiPhi™
instruction manual).
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Our strategy for amplifying genomic DNA was to use
nested or hemi-nested PCR (see Table 1 for primer
sequences). Rarely was product visible on a gel after a single round of PCR. However, re-amplifying from the first
reaction using at least one internal primer resulted in reasonable amplification of the desired product. Large gene
regions (e.g. 18S) were amplified in overlapping fragments; first the whole region was amplified, then using
this reaction mix as template three overlapping fragments
were amplified. Products amplified in this way generally
returned clean sequences. Two of the three 18S fragments
amplified reliably on all templates, fragment one was dif-

ficult to amplify in heterotardigrades, while CO1 was less
reliable and Wingless amplified only template from fresh
or recently frozen samples. We were also able to amplify
Alpha Spectrin (aspec) and Elongation Factor 1 alpha (EF1a)
from some individuals. We were able to verify that the
aspec sequences we obtained were homologues but we
were unable to verify these as originating from Tardigrada.
We were able to obtain EF1a sequences from most individuals, however, up to 8 different paralogues were identified, each with remarkably conserved coding sequence
making orthologue-specific primer redesign difficult (data
not presented). GenBank accession numbers and sample
details can be found in the additional information file

Each sequence corresponds to one of two oligo-nucleotide primers used for each specific reaction. In addition, all forward primers were tailed with
M13_REV (CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC) and all reverse primers were tailed with M13 – 21 (TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT). Primers for 18S
were adapted from [55]. LCO/HCO primers for CO1 were designed by [56]. mtD9 was designed by [57]. Wingless and Alpha Spectrin primers were
sourced from [58]. Elongation Factor 1 alpha primers were designed from GenBank alignments of onychophora, tardigrade, drosophila and artemia.

Phylogenetic reconstruction
Using maximum likelihood methods we have constructed
phylogenies from nuclear ribosomal 18S, mitochondrial
CO1 and nuclear Wingless regions (Figures 1 and 2). As we
were unable to amplify heterotardigrades using Wingless
primers we used Milnesium sp. as an out-group in this case
as it is believed to represent a basal eutardigrade
[17,23,28]. For the 18S and CO1 phylogenies we used heterotardigrades as out-groups to root the trees and explore
the relationships within the eutardigrades. Although all
studies to date have relied on a small number of taxa (11
tardigrade taxa in [17]), results of both molecular and
morphological work indicate monophyly of heterotardigrades and eutardigrades, and Order Apochaela holding a
basal position within the Eutardigrada [17,23,28]. Our
results are consistent with these findings. The most striking feature contained in these phylogenies is the nonmonophyletic relationship between the eutardigrade families Hypsibiidae and Macrobiotidae and Murrayidae,
with Macrobiotidae and Murrayidae a clade nested within
Hypsibiidae. Although not discussed, this is also evident
in the phylogeny of Jørgensen and Kristensen [17] and has
recently been independently identified by Kiehl et al 07
[34]. By utilizing our current method, further work is
planned to fully explore phylogenetic relationships
among and within tardigrade families.
Identifying molecular variation
An important advantage of analysing sequences from
individuals rather than a pooled sample is that variation
that is difficult to distinguish using morphology is likely
to be identified. For example, Macrobiotus sp. is clustered
into two groups, one containing individuals from near
Ville de Jumelles, St Maur Créteil, France, the other containing individuals from Charcot Island, Antarctica (Figure 1, Additional File 1). The individual Macro-048 was
obtained from near Ville de Jumelles, St Maur Créteil, and
yet is clearly different to other individuals identified as
conspecifics from the same sample of moss. Similarly Acutuncus sp. was collected from Jubany Station, King George
Island, Antarctica. There were clearly two different taxa
represented at this one site – one taxon likely to be Hypsibius.

Misidentification in these kinds of studies is not surprising as identification can only be carried out under low
power in order not to compromise material for subsequent molecular study (we used 400× inverted microscope). Rigorous taxonomic identification requires
permanent mounting and viewing under 1000× magnification (see Methods regarding voucher specimens). Thus
the limitation of potential misidentification is common
to all current molecular studies of tardigrades. Our protocol allows for individual molecular variation to be
assessed. Then, where unexpected variation occurs, an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/7

informed re-assessment of morphology can be made. To
demonstrate this, we took a second sample of substratum
from Jubany Station, re-extracted the tardigrades present
and mounted multiple individuals to be observed under
high power magnification. In this sample Acutuncus antarcticus and two undescribed species of Hypsibius were
identified (data not presented). Furthermore an egg of
Acutuncus antarcticus, (for which identification is considerably easier due to ornate sculpturing on the case) was
taken from the sample and DNA extracted, amplified and
sequenced, and the sequence then used to verify which of
our samples were Acutuncus and which were the unknown
(labelled as Hyp/Acut in Figures 1 and 2 to indicate the
uncertain identification).
One other study has used individual tardigrades to
explore diversity in environmental samples [20]. In this
study remarkable unexpected diversity was present, even
between morphologically similar groups, which would
have been confused if samples had have been pooled.
Pooling mixed taxon samples would at best mask the
diversity present or, at worst, generate false sequence due
to PCR recombination [43]. Indeed, PCR recombination
was detected in our study. A blast search of the full
sequences of the two aberrant Echiniscus testudo 18S specimens (EchinT 058 and EchinT 060: Fig 1) closely
matched Echiniscus sequence previously deposited on
GENBANK. However, blasting a small (~100 base) anomalous region of the sequence perfectly matched the yeast
Candida sp. indicating that the variation in these PCR
products was a chimeric artefact generated from two competing templates.
Utility for population comparisons
Traditionally in population studies a suite of variable
markers are developed and used to screen many individuals to explore intraspecific population structure using
allele frequency (genic) and genotype frequency (genotypic) approaches. More recently, studies have taken
advantage of the genealogical information available in
sequence data to investigate contemporary and historical
population processes [3,44-47]. Our method potentially
enables multiple gene sequences to be obtained from
individuals allowing genic, genotypic and genealogic
analyses [48]. There has only been a single molecular population genetic study of tardigrades [21]. This study provides an important contribution to the field as it indicates
that Echiniscus testudo has a high migration potential.
Importantly though, the data were collected from pooled
individuals and are based on a single gene (CO1) which
may not accurately reflect the true population structure
[49,50]. To thoroughly explore population structure, multiple independent markers are required and intrapopulation variation needs to be evaluated [51]. From our
example we can demonstrate intraspecific variation in

to those described in Figure 1. Support at nodes was generated using 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates.

Dactylobiotus sp. samples in all three gene regions examined (the 8 Dactylobiotus specimens came from a single
portion of moss and are presumed to be conspecifics) and
5 sequence variable alleles at the Wingless locus for Ramazzotius oberhaeuseri from a single clump of moss.

Conclusion
We have described a method that allows for extraction of
individual meiofaunal specimens from their substratum.
Our protocol for assessing between-individual variation is
guided by but independent of morphology. We have demonstrated that phylogenetic analyses using data gained
from individuals rather than pooled samples allow the
detection of hidden diversity and assists in distinguishing
true diversity from errors. Sequence data obtained from
multiple genes will also have application in improving
resolution in population level studies. We are currently
employing the techniques described here to conduct

large-scale phylogenetic and biogeographic studies of tardigrades.

Methods
Sample collection and specimen isolation
Fresh substrata samples of mosses and lichens were collected from walls in St. Maur des Fossés, Paris, France, a
type locality for several tardigrade species. Herbarium and
frozen samples from sub- and maritime Antarctic islands
and from mainland Antarctic nunataks were also examined (See Additional File 1 for details concerning species,
locations and genbank accession numbers). Samples were
soaked in double-distilled water and transferred to a mini
cup blender (Waring). Individual samples of approximately 2 cm3 were homogenised briefly (two short 2 second bursts at the lower speed) then filtered and washed
with double-distilled water through a coarse (~1 mm)
mesh sieve. The resulting sediment and water were trans-

ferred to 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tubes prepared with
OptiPrep™ – Density Gradient Media (Axis-Shield, UK). A
layer of 50% OptiPrep™ solution was floated over a 100%
solution and the sample added above these layers. The
tubes were spun in a bench-top centrifuge (Griffin) at
1000 rpm for 1 minute. The material from the interface
between sample water and the 50% OptiPrep™ solution
was removed and filtered through a 45 µm mesh sieve,
using double-distilled water. The sieve was washed out
into a 50 mL Petri dish and viewed under a Wild M5 dissecting microscope. Tardigrades, and eggs where present,
were lifted from the Petri dish via Irwin loop (a non-corrosive nickel-chromium wire loop, approx. 200 µm × 500
µm) into a cavity slide filled with double-distilled water.
The slide was viewed on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a 40 to 400× magnification range to identify
the tardigrades to genus, species, or type. The individual
tardigrades, or eggs, were lifted from the slide via Irwin
loop and transferred to 5 µL of double-distilled water in a
labelled 0.5 mL microcentrifulge tube and frozen at 80°C.
Voucher specimens
In any given moss several different taxa were often
present. Representatives of each were mounted directly
onto slides with de Faure's mounting media [52], and
individuals, where possible, were identified to species
under high magnification (Olympus BX50 – max. 1000×
magnification). These voucher specimens were deposited
at the British Antarctic Survey Data Resource Centre.
DNA isolation and PCR conditions
Individual specimens were subjected to two rounds of
freeze-thaw cycling (-80°C to 55°C) in sealed 0.5 mL
microcentrifuge tubes to assist in rupturing the cuticle. To
each microcentrifuge tube 40 µL of vortexed 5% Chelex
100 (Biorad) was added and the specimens incubated at
99°C for 20 min. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at
maximum speed in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf) and
stored at -20°C. A blank (5 µL H2O, 40 µL 5% chelex) was
treated in the same way and used as a negative control in
PCR.

We attempted to quantify the amount of DNA present in
the extract using a PicoGreen™ (Molecular Probes) assay.
We optimised the assay for 10 µL total volume (5 µL of
sample) to minimise background fluorescence with a
standard ranging from 1 ng µL-1 to 0.00001 ng µL-1 to be
detected on a Q-PCR thermo-cycler (Stratagene). The
standard curve detected DNA fluorescence to 0.0005 ng
µL-1 after which the relationship between fluorescence
and DNA concentration was no longer linear. Our samples did not differ from background fluorescence
(<0.0001 ng µL-1).

To increase the yield of PCR products we labelled each
primer with an M13 tail, the forward primers with M13
REV and the reverse primers with M13 -21 [53]. Primer
details are given in Table 1.
We amplified the nuclear "multi-copy" gene 18S rDNA
(18S) and the mitochondrial (thus high copy number)
cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene for which there
were data available on GENBANK to verify that the products we were amplifying were from the target organisms as
opposed to contamination from airborne substrata, gut
contents or commensal organisms associated with the tardigrade cuticle [17]. For 18S we used the primers SSU 1F
and modified SSU 82R [54,55] to amplify approximately
1800 bases in 10 µL volumes containing 16 µM ammonium sulphate, 68 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5% bovine serum albumin 10 mg/mL
(Sigma), 3 mM magnesium chloride, 200 µM each dNTP,
0.5 µM each primer, 0.5 units of Taq DNA Polymerase
(Bioline), and 1 µL template DNA. Cycling conditions
were 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1
min, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min. This was followed by a 4 min extension at 72°C.
Using 2 µL of this reaction mixture we conducted three
separate reactions to amplify three overlapping fragments
of the gene using the primers SSU 1F/SSU 26R, SSU 22F/
SSU 13R and SSU 26F/SSU 82R [55] (see Table 1). All
three fragments were amplified in 40 µL volumes using
the above conditions with the exception of magnesium
chloride concentration, which was lowered to 2 mM, and
annealing temperature, which was raised to 65°C, to
increase specificity.
The mitochondrial CO1 gene was amplified by heminested PCR. The first amplification was with the primers
LCO_1490 [56] and mtD9 [57] in 10 µL volumes containing 16 µM ammonium sulphate, 68 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8),
10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5% bovine serum albumin 10
mg/mL (Sigma), 2 mM magnesium chloride, 200 µM each
dNTP, 0.5 µM each primer, 0.5 units of Taq DNA Polymerase (Bioline), and 1 µL template DNA. Cycling conditions
were 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30
sec, 45°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 45 sec. This was followed by a 4 min extension at 72°C.
The second amplification was with the primers
LCO_1490 and HCO_2198 [56]. Reaction conditions
were in 40 µL volumes using the above concentrations.
Cycling conditions were as above but with annealing temperature raised to 50°C.
A similar nested amplification strategy was applied to the
genes Wingless, Alpha Spectrin and Elongation Factor 1
alpha, using the initial PCR cycling conditions suggested

by Regier [58]. Amplifications were conducted in 10 µL
(first amplification) and 40 µL (second amplification)
reactions using reaction mix concentrations as above. The
cycling conditions for the first amplification were 94°C
for 2 min followed by 24 cycles starting 94°C 30 sec,
56°C 30 sec, 72°C 1 min but decreasing annealing temperature from 56°C to 45°C by 0.4°C each cycle and
increasing extension time by 2 seconds each cycle. This
was followed by a further 12 cycles of 94°C 30 sec, 45°C
30 sec 72°C 2 min increasing the extension time by 3 seconds each cycle. The reaction was terminated with a 4 min
extension at 72°C. The second amplification used 2 µL of
the first reaction as template but used more conventional
cycling conditions of 94°C for 2 min followed by 35
cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 45°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 45
sec. This was followed by a 4 min extension at 72°C.
Amplified products were sequenced by Macrogen inc.
Seoul, Korea. All sample information including GenBank
accession numbers are available as an additional file.
Analyses
Sequence trace files were base-called and aligned using
Codoncode Aligner V1.6.3 (CodonCode Corp). Coding
genes were checked for open reading frame and blast
searched (tblastx) to assess gene homology. Where highly
divergent nucleotide sequences proved difficult to align,
sequences were converted to amino acids and aligned by
eye and back translated to nucleotide in SE-AL [59].
Ambiguous alignment regions were excised from the analyses.

To determine an appropriate model of sequence evolution we used the iterative optimisation approach suggested by Swofford [60] and validated by Sullivan [61].
The data was used to construct a neighbour joining (NJ)
tree in PAUP*4 10b [62] from which the likelihood
parameters were estimated and used in a heuristic likelihood tree search (NJ starting tree, TBR). After a minute the
search was stopped and likelihood parameters were estimated from the new tree. These parameters were used to
conduct another likelihood search that was again stopped
after a minute. This procedure was repeated until the likelihood scores stabilised. Once parameters were optimised
for the full model, we systematically reduced the number
of parameters to see if a simpler model could be used to
describe the patterns of evolution without adversely
affecting the overall likelihood scores. Using the appropriate model (GTR+I+Γ) we conducted heuristic searches
with 100 random starting addition sequences using maximum likelihood option in PAUP*. We conducted 1000
bootstrap replicates (1 random addition sequence) to
assess the strength of each phylogenetic inference.
