Abstract
Background: Attempts to develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of environmental
estrogens on fish are increasingly conducted at the level of gene expression. Appropriate
application of real-time PCR in such studies requires the use of a stably expressed 'housekeeping'
gene as an internal control to normalize for differences in the amount of starting template between
samples.
Results: We sought to identify appropriate genes for use as internal controls in experimental
treatments with estrogen by analyzing the expression of eight functionally distinct 'housekeeping'
genes (18S ribosomal RNA [18S rRNA], ribosomal protein l8 [rpl8], elongation factor 1 alpha [ef1a],
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [g6pd], beta actin [bactin], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase [gapdh], hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 [hprt1], and tata box binding protein
[tbp]) following exposure to the environmental estrogen, 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), in the fathead
minnow (Pimephales promelas). Exposure to 10 ng/L EE2 for 21 days down-regulated the expression
of ef1a, g6pd, bactin and gapdh in the liver, and bactin and gapdh in the gonad. Some of these effects
were gender-specific, with bactin in the liver and gapdh in the gonad down-regulated by EE2 in males
only. Furthermore, when ef1a, g6pd, bactin or gapdh were used for normalization, the hepatic
expression of two genes of interest, vitellogenin (vtg) and cytochrome P450 1A (cyp1a) following
exposure to EE2 was overestimated.
Conclusion: Based on the data presented, we recommend 18S rRNA, rpl8, hprt1 and/or tbp, but
not ef1a, g6pd, bactin and/or gapdh, as likely appropriate internal controls in real-time PCR studies
of estrogens effects in fish. Our studies show that pre-validation of control genes considering the
scope and nature of the experiments to be performed, including both gender and tissue type, is
critical for accurate assessments of the effects of environmental estrogens on gene expression in
fish.

Background
Over the past 25 years, there has been increasing concern
about the impacts of the plethora of natural and anthropogenic chemicals discharged into the aquatic environ-

ment that disrupt the endocrine system of wildlife [1].
Typically, these endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)
exert their actions via interactions with the nuclear steroid
hormone receptors. The most well characterised, and of

greatest current concern, are EDCs which bind to and activate the estrogen receptor: so-called environmental estrogens (for a review, see [2]). The international research
effort on chemically-induced endocrine disruption has
been driven by unequivocal evidence that environmental
estrogens alter sexual development and function in fish
(for a review, see [3]), and effects on other physiological
processes, including growth, development, osmoregulation, and stress and immune responses, have also been
reported (reviewed in [4]). An improved understanding of
the mechanisms by which these effects occur is critical if
we are to fully assess the potential health implications of
exposure to environmental estrogens, both for fish and for
other vertebrates.
Attempts to develop a mechanistic understanding of the
effects of environmental estrogens in the body are increasingly being conducted at the level of gene expression
(reviewed in [5]). Real-time reverse transcription PCR is
presently the most sensitive method for the detection of
mRNAs [6], and is also often employed for the validation
of gene expression data from high-throughput array
experiments [7]. Quantitative analysis of gene expression
using real-time PCR typically requires the use of a constitutively expressed 'housekeeping' gene as an internal control to normalize for differences in starting cDNA
template between samples (reviewed in [8,9]). The fundamental requirement for validation of the expression stability of an internal control gene prior to its use in the
system being studied is also well-defined. Nevertheless, in
contrast to the situation for many mammalian experimental systems (e.g. [10-12]), studies investigating the effects
of environmental estrogens on gene expression in nonmammalian vertebrates have used 'housekeeping' genes
more or less randomly as internal controls, and without
any validation of their expression stability in the system
being studied, which may have serious implications for
the interpretation of the effects data.
This study, therefore, set out to assess different 'housekeeping' genes for their potential use as internal controls
to normalize for expression of genes of interest in experimental treatments with estrogen in fish. Eight 'housekeeping' genes were selected for assessment, including 18S
ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ribosomal protein l8 (rpl8),
elongation factor 1 alpha (ef1a), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd), beta actin (bactin), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (gapdh), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (hprt1), and tata box binding protein (tbp) in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas; a fish species widely
used in ecotoxicology). These genes were chosen based on
their previous use as internal controls in gene expression
studies, the availability of 'housekeeping' gene sequences
in fathead minnow and related teleost species, and
because they have roles in different cellular functions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/10

(ribosomal structure [18S rRNA], protein biosynthesis
[rpl8 and ef1a], cytoskeletal structure [bactin], glucose
metabolism [g6pd and gapdh], nucleoside metabolism
[hprt1]), and transcription initiation [tbp]) thus reducing
the likelihood that they exhibited regulated covariation.
The genes of interest chosen to quantify responses to
estrogen were vitellogenin (vtg), which encodes a protein
that acts as a precursor of yolk, and cytochrome P450 1A
(cyp1a), that codes for an enzyme involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, both of which are frequently used
for studies on environmental estrogens in fish.
Our results showed that the expression of some 'housekeeping' genes typically used for studies on environmental estrogens is altered by exposure to the environmental
estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and that control gene
validation prior to experimental work is critical to the
interpretation of environmental estrogen-related gene
expression profiles derived using real-time PCR techniques. Our findings on the use of control genes for estrogen exposure studies in fish are likely to apply to other
experimental/chemical manipulations.

Results
General expression levels of candidate 'housekeeping'
genes
We first (based on mean real-time PCR threshold cycle
[Ct] values in control fish) calculated the general expression levels of the candidate 'housekeeping' genes, since
extremely high or low expression levels may preclude the
usefulness of these genes as internal controls (Table 1).
18S rRNA was by far the most highly expressed gene in
both tissues studied. ef1a and rpl8 were also consistently
among the most highly expressed 'housekeeping' genes,
while tbp, hprt1 and g6pd were consistently among the
lowest expressed genes. gapdh was highly expressed in
liver, but among the lowest expressed 'housekeeping'
genes in gonad, while the opposite was true for bactin,
which was highly expressed in gonad but had a low level
of expression in liver.
Expression of candidate 'housekeeping' genes following
exposure to estrogen
The expression levels of some of the candidate 'housekeeping' genes were altered in adult fathead minnow following 21 days exposure to EE2, but the effects of EE2 in
some cases differed depending on the tissue type (liver or
gonad) and/or the gender of the fish. In liver (Fig. 1),
there was no effect of this exposure on the expression of
18S rRNA, rpl8, hprt1 or tbp in either males or females (Fig.
1A,B,G, and 1H). However, expression of ef1a, g6pd, and
gapdh in liver was down-regulated following exposure to
EE2 in both males and females (ef1a: to 32–41% of the
control level; g6pd: to 15–23% of the control level; gapdh:
to 4–6% of the control level) (Figs. 1C,D, and 1F). Expres-

sion of bactin in liver was also down-regulated following
exposure to EE2 but only significantly so in males (to 9%
of the control level) (Fig. 1E).
In gonad (Fig. 2), the expression levels of 18S rRNA, rpl8,
ef1a, g6pd, hprt1 and tbp were unaffected following exposure to EE2 in both males and females. However, the
expression levels of bactin (in both males and females)
and gapdh (in males only) were reduced following exposure to EE2 (for bactin, to 47–48% of the control level, Fig.
2E; for gapdh, to 19% of the control level, Fig. 2F).
The effect of using the different 'housekeeping' genes to
normalize data for genes of interest
When the expression data were normalized to the amount
of input cDNA, vtg was, as expected, shown to be substantially (190-fold) up-regulated in liver of male fathead
minnow exposed to EE2 (Fig. 3A) but not in females. vtg
expression in male liver (but not in female liver) was also
shown to be significantly increased by EE2 exposure, and
by a similar fold, when the data were instead normalized
using 'housekeeping' genes whose expression were
unchanged by estrogen in this tissue (247-340-fold; Figs.
3B,C,H and 3I). Although vtg expression in male liver was
also shown to be up-regulated by EE2 when ef1a, g6pd, bactin or gapdh ('housekeeping' genes down-regulated by EE2
in this tissue) were used for the normalization (Figs. 3D–
G), the fold-increases in vtg expression compared to control males using these 'housekeeping' genes were 563 ±
19-fold for ef1a, 1090 ± 75-fold for g6pd, 4515 ± 2758fold for bactin, and 8341 ± 3211-fold for gapdh, which
were significantly higher values compared with those
obtained using the 'housekeeping' genes not affected by
the EE2 treatment. A further difference observed when
normalizing to ef1a, g6pd or gapdh was that vtg expression
in female liver was over-estimated and shown to be
increased significantly with EE2 treatment (for ef1a, by
3.4-fold, for g6pd, by 6.34-fold, and for gapdh, by 15-fold).

When the expression data were normalized to the amount
of input cDNA, cyp1a was, as expected, shown to be downregulated in liver of fathead minnow exposed to EE2 in
both males and females (to 15–28% of the control level;
Fig. 4A). Similarly, cyp1a expression in liver was also
shown to be significantly decreased by EE2 when cyp1a
expression was instead normalized to the expression of
either 18S rRNA, rpl8, or hprt1 in both males (18S rRNA:
to 17% of the control level;rpl8: to 8% of the control level;
hprt1: to 22% of the control level) and females (18S rRNA:
to 34% of the control level; rpl8: to 19% of the control
level; hprt1: to 29% of the control level) (Figs. 4B,C,H)
and tbp in males (tbp: to 14% of the control level) (Fig. 4I).
cyp1a expression was also reduced in males exposed to EE2
when ef1a and g6pd were used for the normalizations, but
to a smaller extent (ef1a: to 34% of the control level; g6pd:
to 49% of the control level). (Figs. 4D–E). In contrast, in
females EE2 had no significant effect on cyp1a expression
when ef1a or g6pd was used for the normalization. Moreover, when bactin and gapdh were used for the normalization, cyp1a expression apparently increased with EE2
exposure in males (bactin; 2-fold) or in both males and
females (gapdh; males: 3.5-fold, females: 3.3-fold) (Figs.
4F–G).

Discussion
In this study, we investigated a suite of eight 'housekeeping' genes that represent different functional classes and
gene families for use as internal controls to normalize
real-time PCR data in experimental treatments with an
estrogen (EE2) in fish. Specifically, these genes comprised
18S rRNA, rpl8, ef1a, g6pd, bactin, gapdh, hprt1, and tbp.
These 'housekeeping' genes have been validated previously for use as internal controls in many experimental
systems, particularly in mammals (18S rRNA: e.g. [10-12];
ribosomal proteins: e.g. [13-15]; ef1a: e.g. [13,14,16];
g6pd: e.g. [17,18]; bactin: e.g. [10,19]), gapdh: e.g. [19,20];
hprt1: e.g. [19,21-23]; tbp e.g. [19]), but have not been validated for work on estrogens in fish. The development of

'housekeeping' genes, whose sequences were not publicly

required the cloning of the full- or partial-length
sequences for these genes.

A wide range of 'housekeeping' genes have been used as
internal controls in expression profiling following exposure of fish to estrogens, including bactin (e.g. 17β-estradiol [E2] [24,25]; EE2 [26-28]; bisphenol A [BPA] [26];
nonylphenol [NP] [26]; alpha-zearalenol [24]), 16S rRNA

provided any validation of these genes for use as internal
controls prior to their application.

Our data clearly show that the expression levels of some
'housekeeping' genes are regulated by estrogen in fathead
minnow. In particular, ef1a, g6pd, bactin, and gapdh were
found to be strongly regulated by estrogen, and this is
consistent with data published for other teleosts. Downregulation of bactin was shown to occur in array analyses
conducted on liver tissue from male sheepshead minnow

(Salmo salar) exposed to E2 and NP [38]. Expression of
gapdh in livers of plaice and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) has also been shown to be repressed by various
environmental estrogens, including EE2 [28,29,39]. Further evidence of estrogen-regulation of bactin and gapdh
coming from mammalian studies [40-43] strengthens the
case that their use as internal controls for studies for quantification of gene expression with estrogen treatment is
probably inappropriate. The down-regulation of hepatic
ef1a and g6pd by EE2 observed in the present study also
concurs with data from zebrafish embryos [39], where
two ef1a isoforms were down-regulated by estrogen, and
from the European flounder (Platichthys flesus), where E2
inhibited activity of the G6pd enzyme in hepatocytes by
30% in males and 80% in females [44]. In fact, estrogenregulation of g6pd provides a likely explanation for differences we observed in hepatic g6pd expression between the
sexes in this study (lower expression in females; data not
shown), since female fish have higher circulating levels of
endogenous estrogens than males. The effect of estrogen
on gapdh and g6pd expression observed here likely results
from their involvement in metabolism, since estrogens,
like other sex steroids, are well known to have roles in the
regulation of the metabolic processes associated with
altered energy demands during gonad development and
reproduction in fish [45-47]. Moreover, several other metabolic enzymes are also known to be controlled by sex
steroids including estrogens in fish [27,46,48].
Interestingly, for some of the candidate 'housekeeping'
genes, the effects of estrogen were tissue- and/or genderspecific. For example, ef1a and g6pd expression were only
altered by EE2 in liver and not in gonad. Moreover, the
expression levels of gapdh in gonad and bactin in liver were
only down-regulated by EE2 in males and not in females.
Complex effects of estrogens (including tissue-, gender-,
and/or developmental-stage-specific effects) have been
demonstrated for many estrogen-regulated genes, including 'housekeeping' genes, in fish and higher vertebrates
(e.g. [4,41]) and this suggests that these genes may have
different roles in different tissues, and different roles in
males compared with in females in these tissues. The tissue- and gender-specific nature of these effects of EE2 on
'housekeeping' gene expression emphasises the need for
caution if extrapolating data from one tissue/gender to
another when choosing an internal control gene.
Four of the candidate 'housekeeping' genes (18S rRNA,
rpl8, hprt1 and tbp) were found to be unaffected by estrogen treatment in both tissues examined in this work and
are, therefore, considered valid for use as internal controls
in such experiments. The high stability of rpl8 expression
following estrogen treatment conforms with data from
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), where the expression of a suite of 11 ribosomal proteins, including rpl8,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/10

did not fluctuate appreciably (<1.3-fold) in response to
estrogenic compounds, and ribosomal proteins were thus
recommended for use as internal control genes in microarray experiments involving estrogen treatments [33].
However, the results of another study on rainbow trout
demonstrated EE2-induction of the ribosomal protein
ribosomal protein s3 (rps3) [28], emphasising that not all
ribosomal proteins may be estrogen-independent.
Although there is no other data currently available concerning possible estrogen regulation of hprt1 and tbp in
fish, hprt has been described as an estrogen-independent
'housekeeping' gene in mammals [21], supporting our
findings here.
The lack of regulation of 18S rRNA by EE2 in this study (21
day exposure) concurs with the findings for an exposure
to EE2 conducted on zebrafish (liver, for periods of 48 and
168 hours) [37]. In that study however, and based on
array analyses, 18S rRNA was up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner in zebrafish liver after a shorter
term (24 hour) exposure to EE2, suggesting that any 18S
rRNA regulation by estrogen may occur in a temporal
manner. Although rRNAs have been advocated for use as
internal controls in many other experimental systems and
their levels are thought to be less likely to vary under conditions that affect the expression of mRNAs (e.g. [1012,49]), there is some evidence that another rRNA, 28S
rRNA, is also regulated by estrogen in fish [29]. Moreover,
some clear disadvantages in the use of rRNAs as internal
controls have been highlighted by other researchers (e.g.
see [17,50,51]. Most notably, rRNAs can only be used as
internal controls for total RNA preparations (since mRNA
purification methods randomly remove them) and cannot be used when an oligo(dT) reverse transcription has
been carried out. The use of rRNAs, which constitute 80–
90% of total RNA, has also been criticised due to their very
high general expression level which far exceeds that for
mRNAs (e.g. [51,52]). A very high general level of expression of 18S rRNA was also observed in the current study
(18S rRNA had a mean Ct of approximately 11, compared
to mean Cts of approximately 23–32 for the other candidate 'housekeeping' genes). It is imperative, therefore, that
these issues are considered if selecting 18S rRNA as an
internal control for studies on environmental estrogens in
fish.
To assess the importance of selecting an appropriately validated 'housekeeping' gene for use as an internal control,
in our final analyses we measured the expression of two
genes of interest, vtg and cyp1a, in the livers of fathead
minnow exposed to EE2 and compared the relative expression results obtained using the different housekeeping
genes to those obtained when the amount of input cDNA
was normalized. vtg and cyp1a were selected for this analysis because of their biological roles in oocyte develop-

ment and xenobiotic metabolism, respectively, because
they are well characterised as estrogen-inducible and
estrogen-downregulated genes, respectively, and because
they are frequently included as genes of interest in studies
on the effects of environmental estrogens (e.g.
[32,53,54]). When the amount of input cDNA was normalized, vtg mRNA expression in liver was highly
(approximately 200-fold) up-regulated by EE2 in males
(but not in females), while cyp1a mRNA expression was
down-regulated by EE2 in both sexes (to between 15–28%
of the control level), and these findings were as expected
and in agreement with the current literature (e.g.
[32,53,54]). We then alternatively normalized vtg and
cyp1a expression using a 'housekeeping' gene approach,
with each of the eight different 'housekeeping' genes.
Depending on the 'housekeeping' gene used for the gene
of interest normalization, vtg mRNA levels were either
unchanged or increased (to widely varying degrees from
250- to 8,300-fold), and cyp1a mRNA levels were either
down-regulated, unchanged or increased (and, again, to
different degrees). As expected, the use of appropriate
'housekeeping' genes (18S rRNA, rpl8, tbp, or hprt1; which
were not affected by the EE2 treatment) for the normalizations, gave very similar results to the data generated when
the input cDNA amount was normalized, demonstrating
that the use of these genes is valid and effectively normalizes for differences in input cDNA. In contrast, when
'housekeeping' genes down-regulated by the EE2 treatment (ef1a, g6pd, bactin, or gapdh) were used, the expression levels of the genes of interest were overestimated,
which lead to inappropriate conclusions about the manner in which these genes were regulated, or not regulated,
by estrogen, and/or the degree to which they were estrogen-regulated. Likewise, if a 'housekeeping' gene which
was up-regulated by EE2 had been used for normalization,
the expression levels of the genes of interest would have
been underestimated. These findings have major implications for studies on the effects and potential impacts of
environmental estrogens in fish that use internal control
genes that have not been validated for the specifics of the
experimental system, and in particular for studies which
require to detect small changes in the expression of the
gene of interest. An interesting aside from this work has
been to show that an environmental concentration of EE2
is capable of disrupting expression of a suite of genes that
play key roles in general cell function and maintenance,
adding further to the concern about the potential impacts
of this estrogen in the aquatic environment.

Conclusion
Our results have shown that, in fish, the expression levels
of some of the most commonly used 'housekeeping' genes
are, in fact, regulated by estrogen treatment, and based on
the data presented, we therefore recommend against the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/10

use of ef1a, g6pd, bactin, and gapdh as internal controls in
real-time PCR studies of estrogen-exposed fish. In contrast, based on their estrogen-independency in this study,
we recommend 18S rRNA, rpl8, hprt1 and tbp as likely
appropriate internal control genes in this experimental
setting. Given that these data have shown that choosing
an inappropriate 'housekeeping' gene as an internal control to normalize expression data for a gene of interest can
potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions on estrogen
effect pathways, we strongly recommend that most appropriate 'housekeeping' gene for use as an internal control is
first established for the specifics of each estrogen experiment. This selection should take into account the fact that
estrogen-regulation of 'housekeeping' genes may vary
with factors such as chemical, dose and, exposure length,
in addition to gender and tissue type.

Methods
Estrogen exposure
The synthetic estrogen EE2, a contaminant widespread in
the aquatic environment (e.g. [55]), was chosen to determine the effects of estrogen treatment on expression of the
candidate 'housekeeping' genes studied. Eight tanks of
adult (>150 days post hatch) male and female fathead
minnow (1 male and 1 female per tank) were exposed to
10 ng EE2/L (Sigma, Poole, U.K.) under flow-through conditions for a period of 21 days. Eight tanks with the same
numbers of fish were maintained in dilution water as controls. The test concentration adopted in this work was
within the concentration range found in European wastewater treatment works (WwTW) effluents (e.g. [55]). Fish
were sacrificed by a lethal overdose of anesthesia (500
mg/L MS-222 [3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester] buffered
to pH 7.4; Sigma). Liver and gonad tissue samples were
collected from each fish from a single replicate tank, snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA
extraction for subsequent gene expression analyses.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from the tissue samples using Tri
Reagent (Sigma), following manufacturer's instructions.
Total RNA concentration was calculated from absorbance
at 260 nm (A260nm; GeneQuant; Amersham Biosciences,
Little Chalfont, U.K.) and RNA quality was verified by
electrophoresis on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels and by A260nm/A280nm ratios >1.8. For each sample, 2 μg total RNA was treated with RQ1 DNase
(Promega, Southampton, U.K.) to remove any contaminating DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized from the
DNase-treated RNA using random hexamer primers (5'NNNNNN-3'; MWG-Biotech, Ebersburg, Germany) and
Moloney-murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega), following manufacturer's instructions.

cDNA quantification and normalization
To remove the RNA strand (which would interfere with
cDNA quantification), the cDNA was treated with RNase
by adding 1 μl RNase Cocktail (Ambion, Huntingdon,
U.K.) per 25 μl cDNA and incubating for 30 min at 37°C
followed by 10 min at 70°C to deactivate the enzyme. The
cDNA was purified using NucAway Spin Columns
(Ambion) to remove chemical contaminants and free
nucleotides and then quantified in duplicate with the
Quant-iT OliGreen ssDNA reagent kit (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions using a Tecan
GENios FL fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan U.K.
Ltd., Theale, U.K.). No-RNase controls (to which the
RNase Cocktail was substituted for molecular-grade water
during the RNase treatment step) were also quantified
using OliGreen to ensure that the RNase step had worked.
An aliquot of each cDNA sample was then normalized (by
dilution with molecular-grade water) such that all the
samples contained equal amounts (20 ng/μl) of cDNA
template for real-time PCR.
Development of real-time PCR assays for candidate
'housekeeping' genes
Cloning of cDNAs for candidate 'housekeeping' genes
For three of the target 'housekeeping' genes (18S rRNA,
rpl8 and ef1a), there was no cDNA sequence information
available for the fathead minnow and, therefore, their
cDNA sequences had to first be cloned and sequenced to
enable the design of primers for real-time PCR amplification of their transcripts. Full-length (for ef1a) or partiallength (for 18S rRNA and rpl8) sequences were obtained
from fathead minnow whole body tissue using reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR), 5'-/3'-Rapid Amplification
of cDNA Ends (RACE), cloning, and automated fluorescence sequencing strategies as described in detail previously [56]. The full-length fathead minnow ef1a cDNA
sequence [1748 bp; GenBank: AY643400] was obtained
in four consecutive steps consisting of (a) an RT-PCR to
obtain a core partial-length fragment of the cDNA using
primers designed from regions of ef1a cDNAs conserved
between fish species available in the NCBI GenBank database ('Core PCR 1'), (b) a second RT-PCR to extend the
initial core partial-length fragment towards the 5'-end
('Core PCR 2'), (c) a 5'-RACE to obtain the 5'-end of the
cDNA ('5'-RACE'), and (d) a 3'-RACE to obtain the 3'-end
of the cDNA ('3'-RACE'). The partial-length fathead minnow 18S rRNA (768 bp; GenBank: AY855349) and rpl8
(708 bp; GenBank: AY919670) sequences were obtained
by separate RT-PCRs using primers designed from conserved regions of 18S rRNAs and rpl8 cDNAs available in
the NCBI GenBank database. For PCR primer sequences,
annealing temperatures, cycle numbers and product sizes,
see Additional File 1: Filby and Tyler Additional File 1.
Sequence identities were confirmed using BLASTn [57]
and phylogenetic analyses within CLUSTAL X [58].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/10

Development of real-time PCR assays
Primers specific for fathead minnow 18S rRNA, and for
fathead minnow rpl8, ef1a, g6pd [GenBank: AF206637],
bactin [GenBank: DT257898], gapdh [GenBank:
DT353565], hprt1 [GenBank: DT085800], and tbp [GenBank: DT344258] cDNAs, were designed with Beacon
Designer 3.0 software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo
Alto, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines
and purchased from MWG-Biotech. Assays were optimized and validated for real-time quantitative PCR using
SYBR Green chemistry as described previously [56]. All
assays had detection ranges of at least five orders of magnitude. Specificity of primer sets throughout this range of
detection was confirmed by the observation of single
amplification products of the expected size, melting temperature and sequence. All assays were quantitative, with
standard curve (mean Ct vs. log cDNA dilution) slopes of
between -2.794 and -3.533, translating to high real-time
PCR efficiency (E) values of 1.92–2.28. Over the detection
range, the linear correlation (R2) between the mean Ct and
the logarithm of the cDNA dilution was >0.99 in each
case. For real-time PCR primer sequences, product sizes,
annealing temperatures, and standard curve slope, PCR
efficiency, and correlation coefficient values, see Additional File 2: Filby and Tyler Additional File 2.
Real-time PCR to determine expression of candidate
'housekeeping' genes
Real-time PCR using SYBR Green chemistry was performed on 20 ng cDNA with the iCycler iQ Real-time
Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules,
CA, U.S.A.) using the protocol described previously [56].
Assays had a high level of precision and reproducibility
with intra-assay coefficient of variation of 2.42 %; (n =
96). Inter-assay coefficient of variation was not measured
because all of the samples for each gene were run on the
same plate. The expression of each 'housekeeping' gene
was calculated using the 2-ΔCt method described in [59]
but employed the actual measured E value for each
'housekeeping' gene rather than assuming E = 2 ('efficiency correction'). The 2-ΔCt formula is a modification of
the arithmetic comparative 2ΔΔCt method [59] that was
developed to enable normalization to a measurement
external to the PCR experiment (in this case, input cDNA),
for measuring the expression of 'housekeeping' genes following different treatments. This method expressed the
data as the fold-increase in expression from the mean of
the experimental group set as the calibrator (the control
treatment) and, therefore, enabled direct comparison of
the expression of 'housekeeping' genes with different general levels of expression.

Effect of using the different 'housekeeping' genes to
normalize data for genes of interest
To determine the effect of using the different 'housekeeping' genes on normalized data for genes of interest, the
liver cDNA samples from the EE2 exposure which had not
been normalized to contain equal cDNA concentrations
were analysed by real-time PCR (as described above) for
the expression of the two estrogen-regulated genes of
interest vtg, an estrogen-upregulated gene [32,53], and
cyp1a, an estrogen-downregulated gene [54], in parallel
with expression analyses of the eight candidate 'housekeeping' genes. The fathead minnow vtg [Genbank:
AF130354] assay was as described previously [4]. The
primers for the fathead minnow cyp1a [Genbank:
AF232749] assay were 5'-AGGGAGAACTGAGAGAG-3'/
5'-GTGAGGGATGGTGAAC-3' and the annealing temperature was 57°C. Relative expression levels (gene of interest: 'housekeeping' gene) were determined using a
development of the arithmetic comparative 2-ΔΔCt method
[59] which includes efficiency correction [60,61].
Statistical analyses
Comparison of means was carried out with the Student's
t-test or One-Way Analysis of Variance followed by
Tukey's post hoc test using SigmaStat 2.03 software (Jandel Scientific Software). Non-normally distributed data
were log-transformed prior to statistical analysis and
experimental data are shown as the mean ± S.E.M.
