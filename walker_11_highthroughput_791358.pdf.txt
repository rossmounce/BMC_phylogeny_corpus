Abstract
Background: The gut microbiota is thought to play a key role in the development of the inflammatory bowel
diseases Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Shifts in the composition of resident bacteria have been
postulated to drive the chronic inflammation seen in both diseases (the “dysbiosis” hypothesis). We therefore
specifically sought to compare the mucosa-associated microbiota from both inflamed and non-inflamed sites of
the colon in CD and UC patients to that from non-IBD controls and to detect disease-specific profiles.
Results: Paired mucosal biopsies of inflamed and non-inflamed intestinal tissue from 6 CD (n = 12) and 6 UC (n =
12) patients were compared to biopsies from 5 healthy controls (n = 5) by in-depth sequencing of over 10,000
near full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The results indicate that mucosal microbial diversity is reduced in IBD,
particularly in CD, and that the species composition is disturbed. Firmicutes were reduced in IBD samples and there
were concurrent increases in Bacteroidetes, and in CD only, Enterobacteriaceae. There were also significant
differences in microbial community structure between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosal sites. However, these
differences varied greatly between individuals, meaning there was no obvious bacterial signature that was
positively associated with the inflamed gut.
Conclusions: These results may support the hypothesis that the overall dysbiosis observed in inflammatory bowel
disease patients relative to non-IBD controls might to some extent be a result of the disturbed gut environment
rather than the direct cause of disease. Nonetheless, the observed shifts in microbiota composition may be
important factors in disease maintenance and severity.

Background
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses both
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), chronic
inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract with
developed world predominance and an incidence that

weight loss and debilitating abdominal pain, resulting in
substantial morbidity and impairment in quality of life
[2]. In both diseases visibly inflamed and non-inflamed
areas of intestine can be identified at assessment by
colonoscopy.
The cause of both conditions is still speculative. Host
genetics play a key role, with genetic factors more
important for development of CD than UC [3,4], but
genetic defects cannot wholly explain the increasing

prevalence of IBD in recent years, suggesting that environmental factors are also involved [5]. The current generally accepted disease hypothesis is that the chronic
inflammation of IBD results from a genetically dysregulated host immune response directed at the gut microbiota [6-8].
The human gut microbiota is a highly diverse and
abundant community of microbes that under normal
circumstances is either commensal or beneficial to
human health [9]. Bacteria in the gut contribute to host
nutrition via production of short chain fatty acids and
vitamins, and play integral roles in maintaining human
health by preventing colonisation by pathogens and by
shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity
[10]. The microbiota is also, however, a major source of
antigens, including lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycan,
lipoproteins, flagellin and unmethylated CpG-containing
DNA, all of which can activate both innate and adaptive
immune responses [11,12]. A balanced relationship,
therefore, must exist between bacteria and their human
hosts. A disruption in this homeostasis threatens the
state of immune tolerance and may result in gut
inflammation.
Several lines of evidence suggest a role for gut bacteria
in the pathogenesis of IBD. Faecal stream diversion
induces remission in CD [13], animal models of colitis
require the presence of gut bacteria to initiate inflammation (reviewed in [14]), an increased mucosal bacterial
load is observed in IBD patients [15,16], genome-wide
IBD association studies have identified polymorphisms
in genes involved in bacterial recognition and clearing
(reviewed in [17]) and broad-spectrum antibiotics have
some efficacy in the treatment of CD [18,19].
With CD in particular, individual species such as
Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis or
Escherichia coli have been implicated in disease aetiology [20,21] while the emerging “dysbiosis” hypothesis
implicates multi-species assemblages in an overall imbalance between harmful and protective bacteria [22,23].
Numerous studies have attempted to characterise the
microbial communities in IBD and to compare these
with healthy individuals. Results indicate that individuals
with IBD have reduced bacterial diversity, temporal stability and cluster separately when compared to healthy
controls [24-28]. Compositional comparisons have generated inconsistent results but have generally identified
reductions in components of the Firmicutes phylum in
IBD, often, but not always, with concurrent increases in
Bacteroidetes and facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae [12,22,29-31].
Faecal/luminal bacterial communities have repeatedly
been shown to be distinct from mucosal communities
[32-37], meaning that study of the IBD mucosaassociated microbiota and comparison with those from

healthy individuals should provide the best insight into
whether or not a particular microbial signature is disease specific. In addition, within IBD-affected intestines
disease-causing agents might be enriched at sites of
active inflammation relative to comparatively unaffected
mucosa. We have therefore used in-depth bacterial 16S
rRNA gene cloning and sequencing technology to compare the mucosa-associated microbiota from inflamed
and non-inflamed sites of the colon in CD and UC
patients and in non-IBD controls. Our findings indicate
that mucosal microbial diversity and composition is disturbed in IBD and that there are significant differences
in microbial community structure between inflamed and
non-inflamed mucosa.

Results
Twenty-nine mucosal biopsies were collected from a
total of seventeen patients, including paired biopsies of
inflamed and non-inflamed tissue from six patients with
active CD (n = 12), paired biopsies from six patients
with active UC (n = 12) and five biopsies from non-IBD
controls (n = 5). Demographic data, disease phenotype,
biopsy site and histological scores are shown in Table 1.
All biopsies from non-IBD controls were histologically
normal. There was no age difference between CD and
UC cases but, due to the indication for colonoscopy, the
average age of the non-IBD control patients was higher.
The median ages were 32 (25-51) years for the CD
group, 26 (24-73) years for the UC group and 51 (45-73)
years for the controls. Disease duration was similar.
Quantification of bacterial populations

Using qPCR we measured the total bacterial load in the
mucosal biopsy samples. The results showed high variability between samples but overall the biopsies from the
inflamed intestinal regions of CD patients contained the
lowest number of bacteria (Figure 1). The total number
of bacteria detected in these inflamed CD samples was
significantly lower than the bacterial load present in the
inflamed regions of the UC patients’ colons. While it
appeared that within each disease cohort the bacterial
load was generally lower in inflamed regions of the
colon compared to non-inflamed regions the interindividual variation meant that no other significant
differences were detected.
Overall phylogenetic classification of 16S rRNA gene
sequences

We next analysed the bacterial diversity in the 29 mucosal biopsy samples by deep sequencing of 16S rRNA
gene clone libraries. The final dataset of 10,010 chimera-checked, full-length sequences included an average
of 620 clones per CD patient, 750 clones per UC patient
and ~350 clones per healthy control. As a whole, the

dataset contained an estimated 565 phylotypes (clustered
at >99% sequence identity), which could be mapped to
eight bacterial phyla. 93% of the sequences belonged to
just two of these phyla; the Firmicutes (51.8% of clones)
and the Bacteroidetes (41.1%). Within the Firmicutes
phylum the vast majority of sequences grouped into two
families, the Lachnospiraceae (51.2%) and the Ruminococcaceae (33.1%), which comprise clostridial clusters
XIVa and IV respectively. The Bacteroidetes sequences
were predominantly from the Bacteroidaceae family
(62.6%) but also included Porphyromonadaceae, mainly
Parabacteroides species, (13%) and Prevotellaceae (19%).
Proteobacteria represented ~6% of the total sequences,
the majority of which were b-proteobacterial species

detected each accounted for less than 1% of total bacteria: Actinobacteria (0.89%), Fusobacteria (0.14%), Verrucomicrobia (0.03%), Lentisphaera (0.01%) and TM7
bacteria (0.02%).
Comparison of bacterial composition in IBD and control
biopsies

There was a large degree of inter-individual variation
between patients at all taxonomic levels but, despite
this, distributions could be significantly associated with
disease. Samples from both the inflamed and noninflamed sites from CD and UC patients contained proportionally less Firmicutes, and correspondingly more
Bacteroidetes, than the non-IBD control samples
(Figure 2). The decreased proportion of Firmicutes present in UC, but not CD, samples reached statistical significance when compared with the controls (Figure 2).
Related to these shifts, the ratio between Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes was changed in IBD patients. In non-IBD
controls there were significantly more Firmicutes than
Bacteroidetes, but this difference was lost with disease
(Figure 2). We also observed a slight increase in Enterobacteriaceae in CD samples. Enterobacteriaceae were
detected in 2 out of the 5 control patients and
accounted for 0.11% of the total pooled community
from these samples; they were detected in samples from
2 out of 6 UC patients and accounted for 0.09% of the
total pooled community from these samples. In contrast,
Enterobacteriaceae were detected in the paired biopsy
samples from 5 out of the 6 CD patients included in the
study and accounted for a ten-fold increase in proportion of the total CD microbiota compared to the other

sample types (1.05%). This increase was significant when
compared to UC samples (p = 0.049) but did not reach
significance when compared to the non-IBD control
cohort (p = 0.069). We could find no significant association, however, between microbiota composition and the
severity of inflammation or the site of mucosal biopsy.
Measurements of bacterial diversity

Using a number of different measures to explore the
bacterial diversity within our samples we found that
there was reduced diversity in biopsies from IBD
patients compared to controls and that the reduction
was particularly apparent in patients with CD (Figure 3).
Rarefaction curves built from the cumulative dataset
revealed that there were significant differences in species
richness between control and CD samples (Figure 3A).
The rarefaction curves also revealed a trend towards a
slight increase in species richness in inflamed versus
non-inflamed tissues, although these difference were not
significant. In agreement with these findings, using the
Shannon diversity index (SDI) to measure the richness
and evenness of each sample, we found that the individual non-IBD control samples generally generated the
highest SDI figures and that these were significantly
higher (p < 0.05) than those from both the inflamed and
non-inflamed CD samples and from the non-inflamed
UC samples (Figure 3B).
Bacterial community structure comparisons

We next wanted to test whether or not the biopsy samples grouped together by disease cohort, by individual
or both. Cluster analysis using both the Jaccard coefficient and PCoA showed that the samples clustered
together according to donor (Figures 4 and 5) and that
there was no separation between the CD, UC and non-

patients. Number of sequences per sample: Non-IBD controls = 252489, CD Inflamed = 248-342, CD Non-inflamed = 287-445, UC

IBD cohorts. There was also no separation based upon
the location of biopsy sampling. This suggests that,
despite differences in bacterial community composition
and diversity between IBD and non-IBD samples, interindividual variation is a stronger determinant of overall
gut bacterial composition than disease. Despite this,
although the paired samples clustered together, the
branch lengths in the dendrogram were longer than
might be expected if the community structure was
highly similar between paired biopsies, indicating that
there were still significant differences between the
inflamed and non-inflamed tissues.

Statistical comparisons between inflamed and noninflamed tissue

We therefore sought to properly determine whether or
not a characteristic localised dysbiosis between healthy
and inflamed tissue within individual IBD patients exists.
To test this we first performed whole community comparisons using ∫-LIBSHUFF [38], unweighted and
weighted UniFrac [39] and the parsimony P-test [40]
which all test whether or not two communities are significantly different overall without indicating which phylotypes cause the significance. We then used the Library
Compare tool at the RDPII website [41], which pinpoints significant differences between two communities
at all taxonomic designations from phylum to genus
level to try and discover which bacterial groups were
differentially abundant between the paired samples.
Analyses with these tools indicated that in 11 out of the
12 IBD patients robust statistically significant differences
between the inflamed and non-inflamed mucosal communities existed (Table 2).
∫-LIBSHUFF analysis indicated a significant difference
in all of the UC patients and 4 out 6 CD patients.
Library Compare analysis confirmed that there were statistically significant differences between inflamed and

non-inflamed sites for most of these samples. However,
no obvious pattern was apparent and the statistically
significant differences were spread between a number of
phylogenetic groups (Table 2). Three of the sample
pairs that had significant comparisons with ∫-LIBSHUFF
(CD3, UC1 and UC5) showed no significant differences
with Library Compare. Interestingly, these discrepancies
may be explained by the UniFrac analysis. Unweighted
UniFrac does not take into account the relative abundances of different phylotypes when comparing communities, only the species overlap. Weighted UniFrac also
takes into account the relative abundance of each species. For the three sample pairs with no significant
Library Compare results the unweighted UniFrac comparison showed highly significant differences between
the paired communities, while the weighted comparison
did not (Table 2). This indicates that these paired samples had significantly different community membership
but that the overlapping members of the bacterial community that were present in both samples had similar
abundances, thus explaining the significant ∫-LIBSHUFF
results and the non-significant Library Compare results.
In contrast to this, the paired set of samples from CD
patient 4 were highly significantly different when

Walker et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:7

measured using weighted UniFrac but showed no significance when measured using the unweighted version.
Further analysis revealed that a Prevotella species was
3.6 times more abundant in the inflamed than noninflamed site and accounted for 25% of the total community in the inflamed sample, a difference that was
found to be significant to p < 0.00000001 with Library
Compare. As the two communities were not recognised
as significantly different with ∫-LIBSHUFF and
unweighted UniFrac it is possible that this was because,
regardless of the differential abundance, overall community membership was similar across both samples. The
only sample pair to show no significant differences
between inflamed and non-inflamed tissue with either
∫-LIBSHUFF or Library Compare (patient CD6) was
characterised by a very low overall diversity, indicating
that the microbiota may have been particularly disturbed
in this patient.
As Library Compare is only able to classify sequences
down to the genus level we then sought to characterise
whether or not there were differences at the species
level. For this purpose we compared sequences that had
been grouped into phylotypes using DOTUR (99% identity) and assigned identities with MegaBLAST (see Additional file 1 ). While we were often able to observe
statistically significant differences between individual
phylotypes in single patients (data not shown) we were

unable to detect a specific or recurring pattern or identify disease-specific phylotypes. Recently, a reduction in
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has been implicated in CD
aetiology [31,42]. We did not observe a difference in
F. prausnitzii proportional abundance between healthy
and IBD patients but found that, when looking at paired
biopsies from individual IBD patients, this species was
almost always reduced in inflamed versus non-inflamed
tissue. This trend did not reach statistical significance
however. Species-level analysis also failed to identify any
pathogenic species that have been previously associated
with IBD such as Mycobacterium avium subspecies
paratuberculosis, Yersinia spp or Listeria spp. [43]. We
did recover E. coli/Shigella spp. from many CD samples
but as 16S rRNA gene sequence data does not provide
enough resolution to differentiate between commensal
and pathogenic strains we could not determine whether
or not these species were pathogenic. Sulphate-reducing
bacteria (SRB) have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD [44] but we recovered only one SRB
sequence, which had greater than 99% identity to Desulfovibrio piger, and this was detected in one of the nonIBD control patients.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is one of the largest clone library
studies investigating the microbiota in IBD. In contrast
to an earlier study by Frank et al., [30], which examined
a smaller number of clones from a large number of
patients, we sought instead to add to current knowledge
by obtaining a higher resolution of the IBD-associated
microbiota with particular emphasis placed on observing
differences between inflamed and non-inflamed colon
sites in the same patients. This was inevitably done in a
smaller number of patients and samples because of the
depth of molecular analysis required for each sample.
Our in-depth clone library analysis, utilizing the resolving power of near full-length 16S rRNA gene
sequences, revealed significant differences in diversity
and composition between the mucosal microbiota of
healthy patients and IBD sufferers. The results also suggest a tendency towards a reduction in Firmicutes and
an increase in Bacteroidetes species in IBD patients
compared to controls and also indicate that there is an
increase in Enterobacteriaceae in CD. Similar shifts in
composition, in either one or all of these groups, have
been reported by other investigators using both culture
[22] and a variety of molecular techniques [29,31,45-55].
A previous large-scale clone library analysis by Frank
et al., [30], however, reported a decrease in proportions
of Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes family Lachnospiraceae in a subset of, but not all, IBD patients and an
increase in Proteobacteria. The observed discrepancies
between these two large-scale clone library studies may

Page 7 of 12

in part be explained by different disease phenotypes,
dietary or other environmental differences, the effect of
inter-individual variation between patients or the differing number of samples studied and the depth of sequencing between each study.
We also demonstrated a reduction in bacterial diversity within IBD patients compared to controls and this
is in agreement with several previous studies
[24-27,56,57]. Our data shows, however, that despite the
differences between IBD and non-IBD patients in both
bacterial composition and diversity that samples clustered predominantly by individual rather than disease.
Using both culture and molecular methods, many studies have demonstrated that the mucosal community
along the length of the colon is largely stable, in healthy
and IBD patients, and distinct from that recovered in
faeces [32-37]. Here we provide evidence instead for the
development of localised differences in mucosal microbiota structure in IBD. Our community comparison
results suggest that there may be differences between
inflamed and non-inflamed tissue, with significant
changes in the composition of the bacterial communities
at these sites. A number of prior studies have also
attempted to establish whether or not there is localised
dysbiosis in IBD between inflamed and non-inflamed
tissue. While two of these studies indicated that there is
a dysbiosis [58,59], the majority have suggested that this
is not the case [29,48,60-62]. Discrepancies between
these results and ours may result from the use of differing molecular methodology and/or the greater sequencing depth we employed. DGGE/TGGE and FISH are
useful tools but the resolving power of these methods is
much lower than that for in-depth clone libraries covering the full length of the 16S rRNA gene [63]. In
addition, DGGE/TGGE cannot accurately describe
quantitative differences between dominant bands or
describe qualitative differences in sub-dominant species
and single bands on the gel may contain DNA from
more than one species [64].
While our results suggest that localised changes in the
mucosal microbiota do exist in IBD we were not able to
identify a bacterial species or cluster that was consistently associated with the inflamed gut and therefore,
potentially, with IBD aetiology. Other large-scale clone
library analyses have also failed to identify specific
pathogens [29,30]. While their absence may indicate
that potential pathogens may simply form a very minor
component of the microbiota, these results do not support the hypothesis that a particular bacterial agent
causes IBD. Clone libraries generate inherent biases,
however, and it is possible that they are unable to
detect certain species due to methodological artefacts.
Indeed, this may be important with Mycobacterium
avium subspecies paratuberculosis, a member of the

Walker et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/7

often underrepresented Actinobacteria phylum [65,66].
The absence of bifidobacteria from our dataset indicates
that our clone libraries also suffer from this same bias
against Actinobacteria. It is also worth noting that our
analysis would not detect any viral, archaeal or eukaryotic aetiological agents. This may be important given
recent evidence suggesting a role for viruses in the
induction of at least some models of IBD [67].
Sequence-based microbiota comparisons such as ours
can of course only demonstrate associations and do not
provide information regarding mechanism or causation.
It is also difficult to differentiate between compositional
changes that may play a role in disease pathogenesis
and those which may simply have occurred as a result
of disease. However, given the absence of a specific and
recurring aetiological agent in the cumulative data
across all published IBD studies, which incorporate both
culture- and molecular-based methodologies, it is possible that the alterations in bacterial composition and
diversity seen between healthy and IBD patients and
between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa may be, to
at least some extent, the result of the disturbed gut
environment rather than the direct cause of disease.
Indeed, there are a number of reasons why IBD is likely
to result in altered conditions for bacterial growth. For
example, the gut in IBD is likely to be a less stable
environment than that of healthy individuals, with more
exposure to antibiotics and other drug regimes, and
alterations in transit time. Microscopy studies have suggested that there is a higher penetration of bacteria and
a greater bacterial load in the mucosal layer in IBD
patients [47,68] and the resulting inflammation drives
the localised release of antimicrobial compounds [69].
In addition, in UC there is a reduced mucus layer in
inflamed relative to non-inflamed regions [70].
Despite proportional increases in Enterobacteriaceae
and Bacteroidetes within IBD patients, if these organisms were directly responsible for disease we might
expect them to be elevated at sites of inflammation and
this was not shown in our analysis. Taking into account
all of the above factors, the observed increases in these
bacterial groups in IBD patients as a whole may therefore simply reflect the adaptation of the individual
microbiota to the IBD gut environment. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, for example, can adapt to inflammation
in an experimental mouse model by inducing genes that
metabolise host oxidative products [71] and inflammation per se has also been shown to promote the growth
of Enterobacteriaceae in mouse models [72,73]. Clearly,
further similar studies are required on a far greater
range of gut bacterial species so that we can better
understand the response of the gut microbiota to alterations in environmental conditions.

Conclusions
This work demonstrates a dysbiosis, or imbalance, in
microbial community structure and composition in
inflammatory bowel disease patients relative to non-IBD
controls. It also indicates that inflamed tissue differs
from non-inflamed tissue, but not in a consistent or
predictable manner. Indeed, despite general trends such
as a reduction in diversity, the response to IBD may be
to some extent specific to the individual. This lends support to the emerging hypothesis that IBD is combinatorial in aetiology, with many different combinations of
genetic and environmental causes leading to similar
therapeutic responses [67], and highlights the importance of interconnection between the environment, the
microbiota and the host in health and disease.
Despite this, even if particular bacteria are not the
specific cause of IBD, altered immune responses may
act to select particular bacterial species through creation
of favourable microenvironments and might therefore
cause the outgrowth of potentially pathogenic commensal species [74]. Shifts in the microbiota may therefore
still impact gut health by altering the antigenic exposure
to the gut mucosa or by reducing its exposure to beneficial microbes and/or their metabolic products, thereby
initiating a cycle that favours recruitment and growth of
more pro-inflammatory species [17,75]. The observed
reduction in Firmicutes proportions, for example, might
lead to an undesirable affect on gut health. Recent work
describing the anti-inflammatory properties of one Firmicutes species, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [42] illustrates this point.
Finally, results from metagenomic studies indicate
that, regardless of species composition, the collective
genomes of each individual’s microbiota appear to
encode a remarkably conserved set of functions [28]. If
similar, and potentially aggravating, factors are encoded
by multiple species, it is possible that we will be better
served in the future by looking at the complete gene
complement of the microbial community as a whole,
not just species composition. With this in mind, it is
hoped that further analysis of the complex interplay
between host and microbes will yield important insights
into the pathogenesis of IBD.
Methods
Patients

Patients were selected from those undergoing routine
colonoscopic assessment of IBD at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ Hospitals, London, UK. As controls, asymptomatic
individuals undergoing colonoscopy for a family history
of colorectal cancer or polyp surveillance were also
invited to take part. Written informed consent was
obtained from each patient and the study was granted

Walker et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/7

ethical approval by the St. Thomas’ Research Ethics
Committee (Ref No. 06/Q0702/74). Patient information,
including sex, age and the location of the colon that
biopsies were taken from, is given in Table 1.
Colonoscopy was undertaken after prior preparation of
the colon with two sachets of sodium picosulphate. No
individuals received antibiotics in the preceding 2 months.
For those with CD or UC, mucosal biopsies were taken
from macroscopically inflamed and non-inflamed areas of
the colon using standard gape forceps. Once taken, biopsy
samples (approximately 1 × 2 mm) were placed in a cryovial without preservative, immediately snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70°C until analysis. Additional biopsy samples from the same area were also sent
for histological analysis. These biopsies were scored independently for presence of ulceration, acute and chronic
inflammation by a single gastrointestinal pathologist. Prior
diagnosis of active CD or UC was determined by standard
clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histopathological criteria. A modified Baron score with a range from 0-5,
where a score of 5 represents the most severe disease, was
used to grade the endoscopic severity of inflammation at
the site of each biopsy used in the study [76].
DNA extraction and sequence analysis

DNA was extracted from each mucosal biopsy sample
using the QIAamp ® DNA Mini-Kit (Qiagen, UK) and
the eluted DNA was stored at -20°C. 16S rRNA genes
were amplified using the broad-range bacterial primers
Bact-8F (5’-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3’) and
Bact-1391R (5’-GACGGGCGGTGTGTRCA-3’) [34].
Clone library construction and sequencing were carried
out as described previously [72].
Sequences were aligned using the NAST aligner [77]
and these alignments were subject to extensive manual
curation using the ARB package [78] before further analysis. Sequences were tested for chimeras with Mallard
[79], Bellerophon at Greengenes [77] and Pintail [80]
and any that appeared to be chimeric were removed.
The sequences (deposited in GenBank under accession
numbers FJ503060-FJ513069) were initially given a
broad classification to the phylum and family levels
using the Classifier tool at the RDPII website [41]. To
obtain more detailed taxonomic information the
sequences were then divided into phylotypes. Distance
matrices were generated in ARB with the Olsen correction and a 60% maximal-base frequency filter applied.
This filter removed many ambiguously-aligned columns
but was not so stringent that distinct species were commonly merged into single phylotypes. Distance matrices
were then entered into the DOTUR program [81] set to
the furthest neighbour and 99%-similarity setting. The
resulting phylotypes were then assigned similarities to
nearest neighbours using MegaBLAST [82].

To determine the depth of coverage in each of the
clone libraries Good’s coverage was calculated using the
mothur software package [40]. Using this estimator the
median coverage across all samples was found to be
94.35% (range of 83.73-97.3%).
Shannon diversity indices were calculated for each
library by entering distance matrices generated in ARB,
with the Olsen correction and a 60% maximal basefrequency filter applied, into DOTUR [81]. Rarefaction
curves for each sample were calculated using mothur [40].
Community structure comparisons across the whole
dataset, incorporating unweighted and weighted UniFrac, Parsimony testing and cluster analysis using the
Jaccard coefficient, were performed using mothur and
were based on an alignment created in mothur using
the reference SILVA-alignment and with the 60% maximal-base filter and Olsen correction applied prior to distance matrix construction in ARB. Cluster dendrograms,
with added bar charts showing the microbial composition of each sample, were visualised using the iTOL web
package [83].
Paired (inflamed and non-inflamed) biopsy sample
sequences from individual patients were aligned using
the NAST aligner and were again extensively corrected
in the ARB package [78] before further analysis. Olsencorrected, 60% maximal-base frequency filtered distance matrices were subjected to ∫-LIBSHUFF analysis
[38]. Unaligned paired-sample sequences were used as
input for the Library Compare tool at the RDPII website [41].
Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots were generated using the Fast UniFrac web application [39]
based upon neighbour joining trees created in ARB,
with 60% maximal-base frequency filter and Olsen correction applied, using the sequences aligned to the
SILVA reference in mothur as initial input.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR)

Total bacteria were quantified in 25 of the 29 biopsies
by qPCR (CD1 non-inflamed, CD5 inflamed, CD5 noninflamed and UC4 non-inflamed were not included in
the analysis due to a lack of DNA from these samples).
All PCRs were performed using a Stratagene Mx3000P
thermal cycler, in conjunction with Stratagene MxPro
qPCR Software. Each reaction contained a total volume
of 20 μl per well and was performed in triplicate. qPCR
reactions contained 10 ng of forward and reverse primer, 10 μl Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix
(Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA), ~ 900 pg of template DNA (1:100 dilutions of sample genomic DNA
preparations) and were made up to 20 μl with RNase
free water. A 466-bp fragment of the bacterial 16S
rRNA gene was amplified using the forward primer
5’-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3’ and the reverse

Walker et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/7

primer 5’ -GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT-3’
[84]. The thermal cycling conditions were 50°C for
2 minutes and 95°C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles
of denaturing at 95°C for 15 seconds, primer annealing
at 60°C for 30 seconds and DNA extension at 72°C for
90 seconds. Finally a dissociation step was added to qualitatively assess reaction product specificity (temperature
raised to 95°C, cooled to 60°C then slowly heated back
to 95°C) for melt curve analysis of the PCR products.
Extracted DNA from a pure Bacteroides vulgatus
(ATCC 8482) culture was prepared into a series of tenfold dilutions in RNase free water ranging from 1 × 106
copies to one copy and used as a positive control in
order to make a standard curve. Quantification of template concentrations was made by linear extrapolation of
baseline-subtracted data from the bacterial dilution series standard curve. For each reaction a threshold of
luminescence was determined and compared to the
standard curve. Thus for each sample an equivalent concentration given in colony forming units could be
established.
Statistical analysis

For the qPCR and compositional results the MannWhitney U test was used for comparisons between two
groups and the Kruskall-Wallace method, analogous to
one-way analysis of variance, to compare more than two
groups. The levels of significance reported were not
adjusted to take account of multiple comparisons. As
these were multiple comparisons, p values <1% were
considered significant to imply strong evidence of a
difference.
