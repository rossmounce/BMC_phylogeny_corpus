Abstract
Background: As a major component of plant cell wall, lignin plays important roles in mechanical
support, water transport, and stress responses. As the main cause for the recalcitrance of plant cell
wall, lignin modification has been a major task for bioenergy feedstock improvement. The study of
the evolution and function of lignin biosynthesis genes thus has two-fold implications. First, the
lignin biosynthesis pathway provides an excellent model to study the coordinative evolution of a
biochemical pathway in plants. Second, understanding the function and evolution of lignin
biosynthesis genes will guide us to develop better strategies for bioenergy feedstock improvement.
Results: We analyzed lignin biosynthesis genes from fourteen plant species and one symbiotic
fungal species. Comprehensive comparative genome analysis was carried out to study the
distribution, relatedness, and family expansion of the lignin biosynthesis genes across the plant
kingdom. In addition, we also analyzed the comparative synteny map between rice and sorghum to

study the evolution of lignin biosynthesis genes within the Poaceae family and the chromosome
evolution between the two species. Comprehensive lignin biosynthesis gene expression analysis
was performed in rice, poplar and Arabidopsis. The representative data from rice indicates that
different fates of gene duplications exist for lignin biosynthesis genes. In addition, we also carried
out the biomass composition analysis of nine Arabidopsis mutants with both MBMS analysis and
traditional wet chemistry methods. The results were analyzed together with the genomics analysis.
Conclusion: The research revealed that, among the species analyzed, the complete lignin
biosynthesis pathway first appeared in moss; the pathway is absent in green algae. The expansion of
lignin biosynthesis gene families correlates with substrate diversity. In addition, we found that the
expansion of the gene families mostly occurred after the divergence of monocots and dicots, with
the exception of the C4H gene family. Gene expression analysis revealed different fates of gene
duplications, largely confirming plants are tolerant to gene dosage effects. The rapid expansion of
lignin biosynthesis genes indicated that the translation of transgenic lignin modification strategies
from model species to bioenergy feedstock might only be successful between the closely relevant
species within the same family.

Introduction
Lignin is one of the most important biomolecules in
vascular plants and is uniquely involved in the structure
support, water transport, and other functions [1,2]. The
emergence of lignin during evolution is believed to be a
crucial adaptation for plants to live on land. Plant cell
walls are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin
and cell wall proteins [3-6]. As a major component of
plant cell wall, lignin cross-links the cellulose and
hemicellulose to form a mesh-like structure giving
mechanical strength necessary for upright stature [5].
Moreover, lignin is highly hydrophobic, which allows it
to play an essential role in water transport and to serve as
a major component of vascular tissue [7,8]. In addition,
lignin is involved in a variety of biological functions
including plant defense and abiotic stress resistance
[9,10].
The distribution of lignin among plant tissues and across
plant species is highly relevant to its function. Lignin is
mainly deposited in the secondary cell wall; the primary
cell wall generally does not contain lignin [4,5]. Woody
plant vascular tissue is highly ligninized, presumably
because of long-distance water transport and required
mechanical strength [7]. Historically, lignin was thought
to be a unique component of vascular plants; however,
lignin or lignin-like molecules have recently been found
in bryophytes and red algae [11,12]. Nevertheless, it is
generally believed that green algae do not contain lignin.
Even though there is considerable variation in content
and composition of lignin in the plant kingdom, very
few studies have systemically analyzed the evolution and
function of lignin biosynthesis gene families across the
kingdom. The recent availability of genome sequences
for several plant species enabled the comparative
genomic analyses to make inferences about the

evolution of lignin biosynthesis gene families across
the plant kingdom [13-16].
There are two major steps of lignin biosynthesis in
plants: monolignol biosynthesis and the subsequent
cross-linking of lignin monomers to form polymers,
which then connects them to hemicellulose and cellulose. Most of the current research has focused on
monolignol biosynthesis. Peroxidases and laccases are
believed to be involved in dimerization and crosslinking of the monoligols, but more detailed mechanisms have yet to be unveiled [17]. The biochemical
pathways of monolignol biosynthesis are highly conserved throughout vascular plants, and most of the
enzymes in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway have
been identified and characterized. Lignin biosynthesis
starts with the amino acid phenylalanine, where phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) catalyzes the deamination
reaction to produce cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is then
converted into p-coumaric acid by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H). The further hydrolation and methylation
steps are branched and complicated. Recent work has
revealed a predominant monolignol biosynthesis pathway, however, other derivative compounds are also
produced, and additional pathway components cannot
be ruled out [18]. The complexity of the lignin
biosynthesis pathways is attributed to several multifunctional enzymes, and these enzymes also correspond
to diverse gene families. For example, COMT and F5H
are both multifunctional enzymes. F5H controls the
balance of guaiacyl (G) monolignol to syringyl (S)
monolignol and can act on multiple substrates, including ferulic acid, coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol.
COMT is the enzyme catalyzing O-methylation of an
even more diverse group of substrates, including caffeic
acid, 5-hydroxy-coniferaldehyde, caffeyl alcohol,

5-hydroxyl-feruloyl CoA, and 5-hydroxy-coniferyl alcohol [18]. Despite the progresses in biochemical studies, it
is not clear how the complicated biochemical pathway
evolved and if the substrate diversity actually is relevant
to the gene family expansion.
Lignin biosynthesis has been subject to intensive study
during the past two decades, mainly driven by the
significant needs in forage and biofuel industries [3].
Lignin content and composition are closely relevant to
the digestibility of plant cell walls. The elucidation of the
lignin biosynthesis pathway has enabled various strategies for modifying lignin content and composition to
improve the digestibility of forage and for biofuel
production [3]. The reduction of lignin content can
greatly increase the saccharification efficiency of biomass
processing for lignocellulosic biofuels [19]. In fact, a top
priority of lignocellulosics research is to develop greater
levels of control over feedstock cell wall structure leading
to improved biopolymer process streams more suitable
for conversion to chemicals and fuels [20]. Decreased
lignin content has been shown to render two major
advantages for potential bioenergy feedstocks. First,
plant biomass with decreased lignin is more readily
saccharified. Reducing lignin production can derive
more accessible cellulose for downstream chemical and
enzymatic treatment in woody species and several other
dicot species including Arabidopsis, Medicago, tobacco,
and poplar [3,19,21-27]. Second, reduced lignin biosynthesis can lead to more carbon allocated to sugar
synthesis, and thus, might result in higher amounts of
cellulose and hemicellulose production [21,23]. In
addition to lignin content, modification of lignin
composition is also believed to be able to alter the
digestibility and saccharification efficiency for lignocellulosics [28]. Despite the progresses in biochemical
analysis and genetic modification, many questions
regarding the evolution and function of lignin biosynthesis gene families across species still remain unanswered.
Very few studies have been carried out to analyze the
relatedness among lignin biosynthesis genes, which
significantly impacts how far we can translate the results
from one species to another.
The study of evolution and function of lignin biosynthesis genes has two implications. First, our analysis
provides crucial insights into the fundamental understanding of the evolution of land plants because of
lignin’s essential role in adaptation to land growth. The
lignin biosynthesis pathway provides a perfect model for
studying the evolution of a biochemical pathway at the
systems level [5,29]. Systems biology should be a
powerful tool to enable better understanding the
evolution of biological networks [30]. The study of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S11/S3

lignin biosynthesis evolution will help researchers
determine if coordinative evolution of biochemical
pathways exists, and how the different enzymes for
producing a group of important molecules such as lignin
might have evolved together. Another goal is to help to
elucidate the evolution of land-adaptation for the
vascular plants. We will address questions about the
first appearance of lignin biosynthesis and patterns of
evolution among diverse taxa. We will also examine the
main driving force for the evolution of the lignin
biosynthesis pathway. Second, this research should
help guide genetic modification strategies from model
species to bioenergy feedstocks. It is important to know
the evolutionary relatedness and to better understand
the functional conservation of lignin biosynthesis genes
among taxa to optimally design next-generation bioenergy feedstocks with modified lignin.
In order to address the aforementioned questions, we
carried out a comprehensive comparative genome
analysis of lignin biosynthesis gene families. The
comparative genome analysis is complimented by a
gene expression study and the biomass composition
analysis for Arabidopsis mutants. We first collected all of
the lignin biosynthesis genes from 14 plant species and
one symbiotic fungal species. The species selection
covered both monocot and dicot as well as both higher
plants and lower plants. The analysis revealed that the
complete lignin biosynthesis pathway first appeared in
moss. With moss (and probably red algae) as the first
turning point for the existence of a complete lignin
biosynthesis pathway, the birth of the F5H gene family
in angiosperms might represent a second turning point
of the lignin biosynthesis evolution. The phylogenic
analysis also revealed that the expansion for lignin
biosynthesis gene families mainly happened after the
speciation between monocot and dicot. A certain level of
coordinative evolution of the lignin biosynthesis pathway was found. The synteny map revealed high
conservedness of rice and sorghum lignin biosynthesis
genes, which could help to guide the lignin modification
across the monocot species for bioenergy feedstock
improvement. Gene expression profiling was carried
out to analyze the regulation of lignin biosynthesis genes
in response to various stresses, which helped to infer
different fates for gene duplications. The biomass
composition analysis of Arabidopsis lignin biosynthesis
mutants revealed that phylogenetic analysis across
distant species could not be used to guide the lignin
modification for feedstock improvemnt due to the
recent and rapid evolution of the gene family. The
research highlighted the need of choosing suitable
model species to develop the gene-specific lignin
modification strategies.

Results
Protein sequence collection and classification for
lignin biosynthesis gene families
The first step of our analysis was to identify all lignin
biosynthesis genes from fifteen species with a two-step
schema as shown in Figure 1. The monolignol biosynthesis pathway has been well characterized with ten
enzymes involved in the conversion of phenylalanine
into different monolignol molecules [1,18]. Each
enzyme is encoded by a gene family in most of the
plant species [1,18]. Protein sequences for the 10
enzymes were first retrieved from Arabidopsis database
based on the previous biochemistry and genome analysis
[31-34]. A total of 63 protein sequences were retrieved
and the functional domains were identified for each gene
family. The protein sequences from Arabidopsis served as
the base for the lignin biosynthesis gene identification.

The first step for the gene identification was to find the
candidate lignin biosynthesis genes with similarity
search. Blastp analysis was carried out to search against
a database with a total of 388,667 annotated protein
sequences from fifteen species. For most of the gene
families, an E value cutoff of e-30 was used. The E value
for the CCR gene family cutoff was e-24; and the E value
cutoff for COMT was e-08. With the aforementioned E
value cutoff, a total of 6564 homologous sequences were
identified as shown in Table 1. The second step of gene
identification was based on the function domain.
IntroProScan was used to analyze the 6564 candidate
genes and the protein sequences not containing the well-

Schema of the experiment.

defined functional domain for lignin biosynthesis were
removed. After the second step, a total of 818 genes were
retrieved and these are summarized in Table 1 and
Table 2.
As shown in Table 1, C3H is the smallest gene family,
and it is highly conserved. From the perspective of gene
family size, gene function, and sequence similarity, C3H
might be the most conserved gene family among the ten
families analyzed. However, from the perspective of gene
family evolution, C4H might be the most conserved gene
family because the phylogenetic analysis revealed no
clear separation between monocot and dicot C4H genes
indicating that most of the gene family expansion
actually happened before the divergence between monocot and dicot (Additional File 1). Four gene families,
CCR, COMT, CAD and 4CL had greater than 100
members across the 15 species. COMT is the least
conserved gene family, considering both gene family size
and the low similarity among the genes from different
species. COMT, CAD, CCR and 4CL are also the more
expanded as compared to the other several gene families.
Among these, CCR is the most expanded gene family
with 207 members across species representing the largest
lignin biosynthesis gene family in several species.
The distribution of the lignin biosynthesis genes across
the fifteen species is summarized in Table 3. Physcomitrella (moss) is the first species with the complete lignin
biosynthesis pathway with the exception of F5H. Several
gene families first appeared in moss. F5H only exists in
the spermatophyte. CAD and CCoAMT genes were found
in several unicellular algae species, and 4CL and CCR
were also found in the a few algae species. PAL first
appeared in Volvox, one of earliest multicellular plant
species. Several other lignin biosynthesis genes were also
found in Volvox. Recent studies indicated that red algae
also contains lignin; however, we were not able to
include a red algal species because no whole genome
sequence is available at the time of this study [12,13].

The relatedness of lignin biosynthesis genes across the
species
Phylogenetic analysis showed that lignin biosynthesis
genes from seed plants share clades and the lignin
biosynthesis genes from lower plants share clades. A
distinction can also be found between monocot and
dicot species with the exception of the C4H gene family.
Phylogenetic analysis as shown in Additional File 2 and
3 suggested that genes from spermatophytes and lower
plants were clustered into separate groups. The same
phenomenon was also found between monocots and
dicots. C3H is considered as one of the most conserved
gene families and appeared first moss. As shown in

Figure 2, the phylogenetic analysis of C3H genes across
different plant species clearly reveals three groups: lower
plants (plants with no seeds), monocots, and dicots. The
evolution of F5H genes is still controversial, because of
the recent finding of S lignin in spike moss and Ginkgo
biloba. However, it is expected that the F5H genes in
angiosperms and other F5H genes evolved through
convergent evolution. As shown in Figure 3, our
phylogenetic analysis reveals that the F5H genes are
distinct between monocots and dicots.

The expansion of lignin biosynthesis gene families
during evolution
The relatedness of the lignin biosynthesis genes is
directly connected to gene family expansion in evolution. As shown in Figure 3, most lignin biosynthesis gene
families experienced rapid and recent duplications. No
more than five gene family members exist in any single
species earlier than Physcomitrella (moss). In contrast,
moss has 26, 29, and 28 copies of 4CL, CCR, and COMT,
respectively, which makes moss a dividing line and

Figure 2
Phylogenetic analysis of C3H genes from seven
species. The figure shows a clear distinction of three
subgroups with the exception of one Arabidopsis genes. The
groups include lower plant species (moss and spike moss),
monocots (sorghum and rice), and dicots (poplar, Medicago,
and Arabidopsis). The species is indicated by the first two or

turning point for the evolution of lignin biosynthesis.
These results corroborate the findings of the Physcomitrella genome project [13].
Another turning point for the lignin biosynthesis
evolution is the birth of F5H genes. F5H converts G
monolignol to S monolignol. As aforementioned, the
F5H gene homologs in our study were not found in
lower plants, but existed in all five angiosperm species as
shown in Table 1. The evolution of F5H genes is
complicated. It is believed that F5H genes evolved after
the divergence between angiosperm and gymnosperm.
No S lignin has been found in any gymnosperm species.
However, there is a recent report that S lignin does exist
in lycophytes, such as spike moss and Ginkgo. The F5H

gene in spike moss evolved through convergent evolution and does not share a high similarity with the rest of
the F5H genes in our analysis. The fact that we did not
identify the spike moss F5H gene through homologybased methods confirms the convergent evolution of S
lignin biosynthesis. Considering that the gene family
is relatively new, F5H has very few copies in each of the
5 investigated gymnosperm genomes.

another without being the offspring of that organism. We
found four cases of potential HGT among plant species and
the fungal species. CAD, CCoAMT, 4CL, and PAL were all
found in Laccaria bicolor, a symbiotic fungus associated with
pines and spruces. As shown in Figure 4, two PAL gene
members in Laccaria (LA184628 and LA291120) share
clades with a spike moss PAL gene indicating that HGT
might be an early driver in its evolution. It is important to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S11/S3

consider the origin of lignin during the evolution when
discussing the direction of HGT.
Chromosomal location of genes and synteny
between rice and sorghum
Comparative synteny mapping across species allows the
observation of how chromosome evolution occurred
and how the orthologs from different species evolved in
relation to one another. We particularly focused on the
comparative synteny analysis of rice and sorghum for
two reasons. First, most bioenergy crops are monocot
species. The study of comparative synteny mapping
between two monocot model species allows for the
understanding about how genes evolve within monocot
species and thus allows better identification of genes to
target for genetic modification. In fact, rice and sorghum
also represent two types of carbon metabolism: C3 and
C4. Most bioenergy feedstocks are C4 warm-season
grasses. Second, the lignin biosynthesis genes experienced rapid gene evolution as aforementioned. Both rice
and sorghum belongs to the Poaceae family, which
allowed us to identify more orthologs.

The orthologs from ten lignin biosynthesis gene families
in both rice and sorghum were mapped and their
corresponding chromosome locations are summarized
in Table 4 and Figure 5. For C3H, there is only one copy
in sorghum (chromosome 9) and rice (chromosome 5),
respectively. In contrast, CCR has more orthologs, with
12 loci found on 7 sorghum and 9 rice chromosomes,
respectively. Collinearity mapping is a more reliable
phylogenetic tool than only similarity based synteny. At
the whole-genome level, there is some collinearity
between rice and sorghum. Among the 60 investigated
loci from 10 lignin biosynthesis gene families, 49 have
collinearity (82%). The comparative synteny map also
revealed the expansion and inversion of some chromosome regions in sorghum.

Stress-induced gene expression of lignin biosynthesis
genes
Real-time PCR of six large lignin biosynthesis gene
families in rice, poplar and Arabidopsis was performed to
observe the fate of gene duplication. Figure 6 shows the
gene expression pattern for rice lignin biosynthesis
genes. We use rice as the model species in this article
to analyze the potential function and gene fates for
lignin biosynthesis genes. Insect treatment induced the
most significant changes in gene expression. Other
abiotic stress treatment induced different expression
patterns among different genes as shown in the figure.

The most important observation was the modes of
evolution for the recently duplicated genes. Changes in

The data summarize how many genes exist for each family and how many chromosomes contain these genes.

gene or protein motifs can have multiple modes. Gene
copies can have retention (R) of the original motif
organization and function. Degeneration (D) mode
suggests loss of one or more motifs and functions.
Neofunctionalization (N) mode describes a new function or motif in a gene copy. Thus, the schema of RN,
RD, NN, DD has been proposed to describe the major
fates for the duplicated genes. Duplicated genes therefore
would be expected to develop a new function (RN) or
degenerate during evolution because of gene dosage
effects (RD) [35-38]. However, it appears that RR is the
mode for several pairs of lignin biosynthesis genes based
on the gene expression study as shown in Figure 6. Since
most of the lignin biosynthesis genes maintain the core
domain for catalysis, we maintain that no motif or
organization changes have occurred in the enzymes.
Gene expression levels might reflect their functionality to
a certain degree. Similar gene expression patterns might
indicate no gene function divergence (RR) and a distinct
gene expression pattern might indicate that new function
has evolved (RN). As shown in Figure 6, for the several
paralogs we analyzed, there are potentially more genes in
RR mode than RN mode. Similar phenomena were
found in all three species according to the gene
expression analysis. These results shed light on the fate
of gene duplications in plants, particularly for genes in
the very important lignin biosynthesis pathway.
Biomass composition analysis of Arabidopsis mutants
In order to examine how functional and comparative
genomics information can be used to guide the genetic
modification, we carried out the biomass composition
analysis for nine Arabidopsis mutants. The choice of the
mutants largely depended on the availability of the
homozygous mutants in the ABRC (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center). The result for biomass analysis is as
shown in Figure 7. The py-MBMS (pyrolysis-molecular
beam mass spectrometer) was first used to screen

mutants based on the analysis of mass spectra of
biomass after pyrolysis. Principal components analysis (PCA) showed that one mutant was particularly
different from the wild-type and the rest of the samples
(Figure 7A). The wet-chemistry experiments were then
carried out to analyze different mutants for their
carbohydrate and lignin contents and composition. The
At1G77520 mutant had the lowest lignin content, with
about 20% lignin reduction (Figure 7B). Both MBMS
and wet chemistry data confirmed that AT1G77520 is
the mutant with largest lignin reduction among the ten
mutants. AG1G77520 was not one of the conserved
genes in dicot species (Figure 7C).

Discussion
This study represents one of the first comprehensive
analyses of the evolution of lignin biosynthesis across
the plant kingdom, because we have taken advantages of
the recently available plant genome sequences. We have
found several important features of lignin biosynthesis
evolution and subsequently apply these features to
develop strategies for lignin modification.
Lignin biosynthesis gradually evolved
It is clear from the results that lignin biosynthesis
evolved gradually. Some lignin biosynthesis genes
appeared early in plant evolution, and these gene
families included CAD, CCoAMT, CCR, and 4CL. PAL
first appeared in Volvox, a multi-cellular microscopic
chlorophyte that contains one cell type. Several gene
families including C3H, C4H, COMT and HCT all
appeared first in moss among the 14 plant species
studied. The existence of lignin biosynthesis genes
correlates with the distribution of lignin across the
plant kingdom. It is generally believed that green algae
do not contain lignin and indeed we found no complete
lignin biosynthesis pathway in any of the algae or
diatom species. However, the recent finding of lignin in

red algae has expanded the distribution of lignin across
the plant kingdom [12]. Even though the existence of
lignin in moss is still controversial, it is generally
believed that moss contains ‘uncondensed’ monolignol-like molecules [11].

Figure 5

orthologs of lignin biosynthesis genes.

The discovery of lignin in red algae also poses an
important question regarding the origin of the lignin
biosynthesis pathway. The current lignin biosynthesis
pathways could come from two origins. On one hand, it
is possible that the lignin biosynthesis pathway in
embryophytes existed before the divergence of green
and red algae more than 1 billion years ago [39,40].
Green algae might have lost the capacity to produce
lignin during evolution. This is also supported by the
fact that some lignin biosynthesis genes, but not the
complete pathway were found in green algae species. If
so, HGT between symbiotic fungi and plants might be in
the direction of plants to fungi. However, it could also be
possible that red algae and land plants evolved lignin
biosynthesis pathway through convergent evolution. The
lignin biosynthesis pathway in land plants might evolve

from HGT of some important lignin biosynthesis genes
from microbes, but these scenarios are highly speculative. It is therefore important to analyze lignin biosynthesis genes from red algae species when their genomes are
available.
Despite these various speculations about the origin of
lignin biosynthesis, there are clearly two turning points
for its evolution. Three pieces of evidence supports moss
as the first turning point – the host for “original lignin”.

First, across the 14 plant species, moss is the first species
with nine lignin biosynthesis gene families, all of which
represent the entire lignin biosynthesis pathway. Second,
as compared to the green algae species, there is a sudden
expansion of lignin biosynthesis gene family members in
moss. Third, lignin and monolignol-like molecules were
found in some red algae and moss species, but not in
green algae. The results indicated that moss is a basal
linage of land plants and a key evolution point for
vascular development [41]. The second turning point for

Page 10 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 11):S3

lignin biosynthesis is the birth of the F5H gene family.
F5H genes convert G monolignol to S monlignol. The
recent finding of S lignin in lycophyte and Ginkgo
complicates the assumption that F5H only exists in
angiosperm. However, our data support the assertion
that lycophyte F5H does not share the same lineage as
that of the angiosperms. F5H genes from angiosperms,
lycophyte, and Ginkgo could all be the products of
convergent evolution. F5H from angiosperms might
represent the tipping point responsible for the evolution
of cell wall structure diversity allowing for tall trees and
various plant morphology characterized by angiosperms.
The coordinative evolution of lignin biosynthesis
In addition to the gradual evolution of the lignin
biosynthesis, a certain level of coordination can be
found in its evolution. As previously discussed, among
the ten lignin biosynthesis gene families, four of these
did not appear earlier than moss. All of the gene families
in lignin biosynthesis did not experience a significant
gene family expansion except in embryophytes. In this
study, moss can actually be considered the plant when
and where coordinative evolution of lignin biosynthesis
begins. The coordinative evolution of lignin biosynthesis
pathway correlates with the evolutionary systems biology theory that biological pathways can be evolved at the
systems level rather than individually [5,29,30].
Substrate diversity and gene family expansion
Despite the coordinative evolution of lignin biosynthesis
genes, different gene families experienced various levels of
expansion. We found a high correlation between substrate
diversity and gene family expansion. A detailed examination of lignin biosynthesis pathways led to the classification of lignin biosynthesis genes into three groups based
on the substrate availability [18]. The first group includes
4CL, CCR, COMT and CAD, all of which can convert
multiple substrates into different products. The second
group includes PAL, C4H, C3H, HCT, and CCoAMT, which
specifically convert one or two substrates into products.
The third group is the recently evolved F5H gene, which
coverts two or three substrates into products. A clear
correlation between substrate diversity and the expansion
of gene families can be found. Basically, 4CL, CCR, COMT,
and CAD are the only four gene families with more than
100 members across the 14 plant species analyzed. F5H is
relatively conserved with fewer gene family members –
probably because it is a recently evolved gene family.
The remaining gene families have between 14 and
60 members. Apparently, substrate diversity drives gene
family expansion.

It should be noted that we selected the gene family
members mainly on the basis of the conserved domain of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S11/S3

function. Considering the substrate diversity and our
limited understanding of lignin biosynthesis enzyme
function, we may have overlooked some genes, which are
actually involved in lignin biosynthesis. Not including
these genes in the analysis could lead to biased conclusions.
Fate of duplicated genes
In addition to the gene family expansion, the study also
sheds light into the fate of the duplicated genes. The
existence of a high percentage of RR mode indicates that
plants could tolerate high gene dosage for lignin
biosynthesis genes. Previous research in fungi indicated
that growth-related genes are more sensitive to high gene
dosage, and stress response genes are more tolerant to
higher dosage [42]. A diverse fate of duplicated genes has
been found in the previous analysis of Dof gene family,
which indicated that plants might be more tolerant to
the gene dosage effects compared with animals [43]. Our
study echoes the results from these previous findings.
Driving force for lignin biosynthesis evolution
Lignin biosynthesis gene families obviously experienced
recent and rapid expansion. The expansion can be
confirmed by the relatedness of the lignin biosynthesis
genes, where phylogenetic analyses of most gene families
contain three major clades: lower plants, monocots, and
dicots. The phenomena indicates that the lignin biosynthesis gene family expansion in spermatophytes probably
happened after the divergence between monocots and
dicots 120 million years ago [44]. Many orthologs have
been found between the monocots rice and sorghum,
which indicates that some gene family expansion happened before their divergence. We also found many recent
tandem duplications for rice and sorghum lignin biosynthesis genes; these are the genes without clear orthologs
between species, indicating that lignin biosynthesis may
still be under rapid evolution. However, not all lignin
biosynthesis gene families are evolving rapidly. Some gene
families, such as C4H, are rather conserved during
evolution, which can also be seen by the phylogenetic
analysis (Additional File 1), where no clear distinction can
be found between monocot and dicot species.

It is difficult to delineate the driving forces for the recent
expansion of lignin biosynthesis genes. According to the
synteny map and phylogenetic analysis, even though some
early whole genome duplication might account for gene
family expansion, recent gene duplication is predominant.
Several factors could be involved in driving lignin
biosynthesis evolution, including environmental adaptation and development of new structures and greater plant
stature. We cannot exclude any one of them. However,

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 11):S3

other cell wall-related gene families like mananase are
rather conserved across species, which indicates that
growth and development might not be the most important
driving force [45]. The ubiquitous over-expression of lignin
biosynthesis genes in response to the insect treatment
indicates that plant defense against insects and pathogens
could be a major driving force for the recent duplication of
lignin biosynthesis gene families. In fact, rapid gene family
expansion has been observed in many defense-related gene
families such as cytochrome P450s and terpene synthases
[10]. Recent studies in fungi also found that stress-related
genes tend to expand and disappear more dynamically as
compared to the development-related gene families [42].
We therefore propose that biotic defense as a driving force
for the recent and rapid expansion of lignin biosynthesis
gene families.
From evolution to function and lignin modification
C3H is one of the most conserved gene families among all
the different lignin gene families and catalyzes a crucial
reaction that cannot be substituted by other genes. A
previous study in Medicago proved that down-regulation of
C3H genes can produce the maximized effects on lignin
content reduction as compared to other gene families [19].
The importance of C3H in lignin regulation is plausible
because it is more conserved and potentially more
important than other gene families. However, the mutants
of C3H showed a severe developmental phenotype. We
need to identify other genes as candidates for lignin
modification. In particular, a gene-specific strategy needs to
be developed. More importantly, we also want to know
how the knowledge and strategies developed in one species
can be applied to another.

We found that knocking down a COMT gene,
AT1G77520, can reduce lignin content up to 20%,
which makes the gene a perfect candidate gene for
genetic modification. However, we found that the gene is
not conserved among the three dicot species that we
surveyed. It is actually a recently duplicated gene. The
results indicate that phylogenetic analysis might not
deliver the strategy to translate the findings from model
species into bioenergy feedstocks if the two species are
not closely related to one another. However, the
existence of many orthologs between rice and sorghum
suggests that a model species within the Poaceae family
could serve the purpose of translational research for
developing lignin modification strategies.

Materials and methods
Gene sequence collection, function domain comparison,
and gene family member identification
Protein sequences for each of the ten gene families of the
monolignol biosynthesis pathway were collected and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S11/S3

analyzed as shown in Table 1. As the first step, a total of
63 protein sequences of the 10 gene families were
retrieved from the Arabidopsis database http://www.
arabidopsis.org/ and their protein function domains
were examined with “InterProScan” from EMBL-EBI
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/. The specific domain for
protein identification is as shown in Table 1. In order to
study the evolution of lignin biosynthesis genes, 15
genome sequences were selected. The species includes
three parisnophytes, two chlorophytes, one lycophyte,
one bryophyte and five spermatophyes. In addition, we
also included two diatoms. Although the classification of
diatoms is controversial, we chose to consider diatoms as
plants [46]. In addition, we also included a symbiotic
fungus species. The species selection reflects the current
stage of available plant genomes as well as the range of
lignin in plants. No lignin has been documented in the
algae species and diatoms we selected. The existence of
lignin in moss is also very controversial and it is
generally believed that moss has lignin-like structures
in their cell walls [11,47-49]. Lycophytes like Selaginella
moellendorffii represent an ancient vascular plant with an
independent origin of S lignin [50]. The remaining
species include five higher plants with available genome
sequence. Gene models for 13 out of 15 genomes were
downloaded from DOE-JGI http://genome.jgi-psf.org as
showed in Table 2. The Arabidopsis gene models were
downloaded from TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org/,
and the rice gene models were downloaded from rice
genome database http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1.
A local blast database of the protein sequences from 15
genomes was formatted using formatDB http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/staff/tao/URLAPI/formatdb_fastacmd.
html, and the initial protein sequence comparison was
conducted using the Blastp algorithm at conservative evalue at e-30. Since the lignin biosynthesis gene family is
large, it includes superfamilies like p450. InterProScan
for protein domain comparison was carried out using
default parameters. In order to derive the accurate
prediction, no superfamily domain was used in the
InterProScan search.

Phylogenic analysis of the lignin biosynthesis genes
The protein sequences from above steps were edited by
BioEdit http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/BioEdit.html
and functional domains were aligned through “do
complete alignment” function using Clustal X2 under
multiple alignment mode http://www.molecularevolution.
org/cdc/software/clustalx/ [51]. After the selected sequences
were aligned, phylogenetic analysises were implemented
with PAUP V4 software available from Sinauer Associates
Inc http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/order.html using parsimony as
well as phelogeny.fr http://www.phylogeny.fr/ using

Page 12 of 15

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 11):S3

maximum likelihood [52]. For parsimony analysis, the
phylogenetic trees were reviewed using TreeView http://
taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html. The results
from the two methods were compared and the trees
produced with phelogeny.fr are presented, since the
maximum likelihood method apparently produces more
robust phylogenetic trees.
Lignin biosynthesis gene distribution and synteny analysis
A synteny study of lignin biosynthesis gene families
between rice and sorghum genome was conducted. The
gene locations in rice were identified via the Rice
Genome Annotation Project website http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/LocusNameSearch.shtml and locations
for sorghum genes were identified by blast search at the
DOE-JGI sorghum website http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Sorbi1/Sorbi1.home.html. A synteny map was drawn
by software SyntenyView (Zhou, unpublished). The
flowchart for the lignin biosynthesis gene family analysis
is summarized in Figure 1.
Plant growth, treatments, RNA extraction and real-time
PCR experiments
Rice, Arabidopsis and poplar plant growth and abiotic
stress treatments were performed as previously described
[53]. Identical biological samples were used for our realtime PCR analysis of lignin biosynthesis genes [53].
Methods for real-time PCR primer design and quantification were as previously described [54-56]. Real-time
PCR primers were designed by PrimerExpress and
amplification efficiency was examined before quantification to ensure data quality [54-56]. The logarithm 2
transformed gene expression ratios were clustered using
the MEV4.0 package.
Biomass analysis with pyrolysis-molecular beam mass
spectrometry (MBMS) analysis and wet chemistry
Both py-MBMS analysis and wet chemistry were carried
out as previously described using the standard NREL
protocol [57]. The Arabidopsis plants for mutant analysis
were grown under the previously described conditions
[10].
