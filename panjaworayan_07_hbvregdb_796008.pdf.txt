Abstract
Background: The many Hepadnaviridae sequences available have widely varied functional
annotation. The genomes are very compact (~3.2 kb) but contain multiple layers of functional
regulatory elements in addition to coding regions. Key regions are subject to purifying selection, as
mutations in these regions will produce non-functional viruses.
Results: These genomic sequences have been organized into a structured database to facilitate
research at the molecular level. HBVRegDB is a comparative genomic analysis tool with an
integrated underlying sequence database. The database contains genomic sequence data from
representative viruses. In addition to INSDC and RefSeq annotation, HBVRegDB also contains
expert and systematically calculated annotations (e.g. promoters) and comparative genome analysis
results (e.g. blastn, tblastx). It also contains analyses based on curated HBV alignments. Information
about conserved regions – including primary conservation (e.g. CDS-Plotcon) and RNA secondary
structure predictions (e.g. Alidot) – is integrated into the database. A large amount of data is
graphically presented using the GBrowse (Generic Genome Browser) adapted for analysis of viral
genomes. Flexible query access is provided based on any annotated genomic feature. Novel
regulatory motifs can be found by analysing the annotated sequences.
Conclusion: HBVRegDB serves as a knowledge database and as a comparative genomic analysis
tool for molecular biologists investigating HBV. It is publicly available and complementary to other
viral and HBV focused datasets and tools http://hbvregdb.otago.ac.nz. The availability of multiple
and highly annotated sequences of viral genomes in one database combined with comparative
analysis tools facilitates detection of novel genomic elements.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects about 350 million people worldwide and is a major contributor to liver
pathology including hepatitis and carcinoma. A large
number of strains, isolates and mutants of the Hepadna-

viridae family have been sequenced. For example, a search
of Entrez for HBV complete genomes currently (9/2007)
retrieves 1114 records, and the Hepatitis Virus Database
(HVD) contains over 1000 full-length sequences. The
small, just 3.2 kb, genome has been extensively studied –

with a PubMed search for 'HBV genome' resulting in over
2500 publications. This research has shown that the
genome is highly packed with information in sequence
and structure. This directs processes such as transcription,
reverse transcription, replication, nuclear import and
export and coding [1-7]. Regulatory elements control this
at the DNA, RNA and protein levels, with particular bases
known to participate in DNA and RNA elements and also
encode more than one protein in alternative frames. During infection the mutation rate is high – estimated to be
around 10-5 to 10-4 per base per year [8]. This results in a
quasi-species infecting a single individual and may result
in some DNA sequences from an individual not being representative of the 'fittest' species. Mutants may become
prevalent in the population – for example, precore mutations, escape mutations, or antiviral resistance mutations.
Recently several international public databases containing
significant hepadnaviral content have become available:
the general Viral Reference Sequence genome project
[9,10], Hepatitis Virus Database [11], SEQHEPB [12], and
the HepSeq database [13]. Each has its own focus and utility. The viral RefSeq genome project is broad but includes
10 Hepadnaviridae members. It is searchable through Entrez Genomes and linked to other resources including the
protein database, NCBI gMap and gene [10]. The HepSeq
database is an epidemiological database focussing on epidemiological, clinical nucleotide sequence and mutational aspects of HBV infection [13]. The Hepatitis Virus
Database includes HBV and provides information on
genome location and phylogenetic relationships automatically processed from DDBJ [11]. SEQHEPB allows subscribers to analyze genotypes of HBV genomes, including
key mutations associated with antiviral resistance [12].
However, there is no tool available to combine expert
annotation with similarity search methods for molecular
biological research into HBV [14-17].
We describe here a genome-based public domain database for the Hepadnaviridae. The database contains data on
individual sequences and groups of sequences and facilitates comparative genomic analysis. The complexity of the
HBV genome has challenged development of this resource
but it will provide a model for other viruses.

Methods
Sequences for analysis
For more detail refer to the documentation in the database. Genome sequences of selected representative viruses
of the Hepadnaviridae family were retrieved from NCBI. All
retrieved Genbank files were split into fasta-formatted and
gff-formatted files. As the virus genomes are circular, some
of the parsed Genbank files were manually curated in
order to be represented correctly.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/136

Processing of data
Multiple sequence alignments were produced with ClustalW [18]. All files were then placed in the MySQL database HBVRegDB.

To identify conserved viral genomic regions, three blast
queries (blastn, tblastx and blastx) were performed on
RefSeq Virus release 24 with the parameters shown in
Table 1. The results were reformatted to create a gff file
and the names of the matched sequences were integrated
to present them in a meaningful graphical representation.
The database will be updated with RefSeq releases.

Results and discussion
Annotations on single viral genomes
The NCBI viral RefSeqs for Hepadnaviridae provide the
best information about coding regions and protein
sequences. However, in general they do not provide information on regulatory signals that are crucial for viral gene
expression. Four NCBI taxonomic groupings (Figure 1)
were incorporated into HBVRegDB.

Eight HBV genotypes (A-H) have been described that vary
in up to 15% of bases. They have very similar genomic
organization, but differing global prevalence. Infection
has been suggested to result in different clinical outcomes,
and this is presumably related to sequence variation [1925]. Other HBV-like viruses also infect hominids (Hominid HBV, HHBV, ~20% nt divergence from HBV) and
rodents (Orthohepadnavirus, OHV, ~45% nt divergence
from HBV). Closely related viruses infect birds (Avihepadnavirus, AHV) with overall similar organization but significant sequence divergence (~60%). These have been used
as models to investigate human HBV [26].
As part of our experimental research, a complete HBV
genome adw, genotype A, derived from a Taiwanese HBVinfected patient was sequenced (a gift from M-H Lin,
National Taiwan University). This HBV clone was known
to produce viable HBV particles when transfected into

cells [27]. This sequence was highly annotated and submitted to INSDC via EMBL (EMBL ACC: AM282986; Figure 2). The annotation was done by extracting biological
information from the literature or other sequence records,
based on the functional conservation. This sequence has
the most complex annotation per nucleotide (3–13 annotations per base) of any sequence in the public sequence
database. It represents the limits of this type of annotation
and of parsers implemented to interpret it. It was intended
to annotate most experimentally proven features on the
sequence. This will lead to annotation of features that may
be of lesser importance (e.g. the S protein myristoylation
site [28]) or alternative splicing [29,30].
Sequences were numbered to begin at the EcoRI site position (if present). This was chosen because, for most
sequences, the numbering is common until base ~1910,
where the numbering diverges. An alternative logical
numbering scheme is also used from position 1 in the
pregenomic RNA [31]. Protein sequences are separately
described using the standard numbering [32].
Annotated DNA elements
Two Direct Repeat DNA primer-binding sites – DR1 and
DR2 – are involved in replication and may be preferential
sites for viral integration into the host genome [4]. Promoters – preC/C promoter and TATA box [33], S1 promoter, S2 promoter, X promoter. Transcriptional
regulatory elements – NREα, NREβ and NREγ. (reviewed
in [4]. Enhancers – Enh I and Enh II, which modulate
mRNA synthesis. The functions of Enh1 and EnhII were
demonstrated for the HBV ayw subtype [4]. Protein binding sites. DNA binding sites within the central core
domain of Enh I. Binding sites of C/EBP, p53, IRFα,
HNF3, HNF4, RFX1, AP1, NF1, CREAB, ATF2, RXR:PPAR
and COUP1 (reviewed in [34]. An element within Enh II,
box α, which is essential for function of the enhancer in
vivo. The non-canonical polyadenylation (TATAAA) signal

used by all transcripts [33,35] followed by the poly (A)
cleavage site (nucleotide 1930). An indicative variation
which represents a nucleotide transition from 'A' to 'G' at
nucleotide position 1896 changing a preC tryptophan to
a termination codon [36]. There are many functional and
non-functional variants of HBV and it is not the focus of
this database to show them; this is done by existing databases – e.g. HepSEQ and SEQHEPB [12,13].
Annotated RNA elements
Five mRNAs – preC, pgRNA, S1, S2, and X, all ending at
the common poly (A) cleavage site including alternative
splice variants of these transcripts [27,37]. RNA regulatory
elements – post-transcriptional regulatory element (PRE;
reported to be an important RNA export element [3840]), splicing regulatory element (SRE) 1–3 [41], conserved stem-loop structures within the HBV PRE, PRE HSL
α, PRE HSL β [38], and the critical RNA epsilon element
structure required for replication and packaging [42].
Annotated protein coding sequences
Eight CDS were annotated on the sequence – preC, C, P,
X, large S, middle S, small S and C0. C0 is a small CDS not
annotated on most HBV genomes. It is involved in regulation of translation of the P and C CDSs and is conserved
in all HBV genotypes [31]. Protein domains: P – Terminal
protein, Spacer, Reverse transcriptase, RNase H. [32].

This highly annotated nucleotide sequence can be downloaded from HBVRegDB in formats designed for use in
software that will read Genbank format. A number of the
most sophisticated parsers were tested by directly retrieving the entry from an INSDC database (NCBI Genome
Browser, Artemis, Apollo (free), VectorNTI (free for academics)). These had differing levels of ability to represent
complex annotation, with features (e.g. the P CDS) crossing the origin of a circular genome and complex descriptors (e.g. mRNA, alternative splices) parsed more or less

well. In HBVRegDB we provide two slightly modified
annotations of this HBV genome. One for more accurate
circular parsing into VectorNTI, and another for linear
browsers (e.g. GBrowse, Argo). A graphical representation
of this annotated sequence in VectorNTI is shown in Figure 2. Although it can represent circular genomes, this format becomes difficult to interpret with many annotations.
HBVRegDB provides a tool to map these annotations onto
another HBV sequence by performing a pairwise alignment.
HBV, rodent and avian hepadnaviral RefSeq genomes
Key additional regulatory elements were added to HBV
genotype C (RefSeq NC_003977), Woodchuck RefSeq
(WHV; NC_004107) and Duck HBV RefSeq

(NC_001344). These modified sequences are indicated by
'm' e.g. NC_003977m. The additional features for WHV
include woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE), which is reported to enhance gene expression delivered by retroviral vectors for gene therapy [43],
and WREα, WREβ and WREγ, whose sequences are conserved within the mammalian hepadnaviruses and are
essential for WRE function [44].

Web-based graphical representation using GBrowse
A set of 65 representative HBV sequences from these
groups of alignments is available using Gbrowse. For
HBVRegDB the GBrowse software package was chosen
because of its flexible configuration and efficient handling
of large amounts of data, although a limitation here is the
lack of ability to represent circular genomes. Annotations
of conserved elements consist of large amounts of data,
e.g. more than 30,000 records for one viral genome.
GBrowse uses a Bio::DB::GFF schema in a MySQL data-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/136

base and a fetch request is answered by the database query
engine in a satisfactory time of ~20 seconds.
Underlying MySQL database
A version of MySQL was installed and configured for
GBrowse. A Bio::DB::GFF schema was created and integrated into HBVRegDB to store the virus genome
sequence data, annotations, statistical track data, and textual information. The five core tables of the HBVRegDB
MySQL database contain additional taxonomic information, virus group relationships, web page search related
data, and a comprehensive link reference list. An overview
of the entire application information flow is shown schematically in Figure 4.

Statistical and similarity search annotations on single
sequences
Potential protein coding regions
Where annotated, CDSs are shown. For consistency, and
for HBV genomes for which not all CDS sequences are
annotated, potential ORFs >100 aa were calculated with
getorf (EMBOSS). Coding regions, which extended over
the virtual end of the viral genome sequence were automatically assigned and represented as two parts (e.g. Figure 5). This process also shows ORFs that could
potentially be initiated at different ATG codons. For example (Figure 5) the predicted S ORFs, ORF 2 and 3, for
which there is experimental evidence, or the predicted
nested ORF 1, which could arise by internal initiation
within P.

ing the corresponding pattern AUWAAA. The output files
were parsed and gff-formatted files were created and
uploaded into the database.
User-added custom tracks
The user can add tracks in gff format. The search procedure above can be followed using online tools to annotate
any motif that can be described by a regular expression,
RNA descriptor or matrix. A description of this procedure
is provided on the website.

Similarity searches against other viral genomes
Blastn and tblastx were used to detect distant sequence
similarities using selected parameters, shown in Table 1.
The blastn parameters chosen will detect short exact
matches. Tblastx was used to search a six-frame translated
sequence against the protein database with hits of greater
than two similar amino-acids analyzed. This could identify novel coding regions in query sequences, along with
the CDS-plotcon analyses or alternative approaches [14].
Matches are shown in Figure 6. Blastn mainly finds other
Hepadnaviridae, whereas tblastx (with these parameters) is
able to detect more dissimilar matches, e.g. matches
between reverse transcriptases from HBV and retroviruses
(boxed).

Conserved primary and secondary structural elements
A way to detect functional elements in genomes is to look
for conserved columns in multiple sequence alignments.
However, many columns of CDSs show conservation due
to constrains on the encoded protein. CDS-Plotcon is specifically designed to look for conserved functional elements within CDSs, independent of the protein coding
constraints. To find conserved RNA structures, the program Alidot [47] was used. For each multiple sequence
alignment, the Alidot and CDS-Plotcon results were gffformatted and uploaded into the database. An example is
shown in Figure 7. CDS-plotcon predicts unusually high
conservation (higher than that required by the coding
capacity in, for example, the boxed region). Similarly the
predicted RNA secondary structure (Alidot) has higher
than expected conservation in this region. This predicted
region is the epsilon element, which is highly conserved
in structure and function and is required for viral replication.

Specific regulatory elements
As an example, PatScan [45] as implemented in Transterm
[46], was used to identify polyadenylation sites by search-

sequences (-W 2 -G 8 -E 2). For example, the tblastx of HBVRegDB returns the hit of the short motif (YMDD) of the HBV P
