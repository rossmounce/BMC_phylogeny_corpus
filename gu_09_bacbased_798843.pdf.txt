Abstract
Background: Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) has been recognized as a new model species
for comparative and functional genomics of cereal and bioenergy crops because it possesses many
biological attributes desirable in a model, such as a small genome size, short stature, self-pollinating
habit, and short generation cycle. To maximize the utility of Brachypodium as a model for basic and
applied research it is necessary to develop genomic resources for it. A BAC-based physical map is
one of them. A physical map will facilitate analysis of genome structure, comparative genomics, and
assembly of the entire genome sequence.
Results: A total of 67,151 Brachypodium BAC clones were fingerprinted with the SNaPshot HICF
fingerprinting method and a genome-wide physical map of the Brachypodium genome was
constructed. The map consisted of 671 contigs and 2,161 clones remained as singletons. The
contigs and singletons spanned 414 Mb. A total of 13,970 gene-related sequences were detected in
the BAC end sequences (BES). These gene tags aligned 345 contigs with 336 Mb of rice genome
sequence, showing that Brachypodium and rice genomes are generally highly colinear. Divergent
regions were mainly in the rice centromeric regions. A dot-plot of Brachypodium contigs against the
rice genome sequences revealed remnants of the whole-genome duplication caused by
paleotetraploidy, which were previously found in rice and sorghum. Brachypodium contigs were
anchored to the wheat deletion bin maps with the BES gene-tags, opening the door to
Brachypodium-Triticeae comparative genomics.
Conclusion: The construction of the Brachypodium physical map, and its comparison with the rice
genome sequence demonstrated the utility of the SNaPshot-HICF method in the construction of
BAC-based physical maps. The map represents an important genomic resource for the completion
of Brachypodium genome sequence and grass comparative genomics. A draft of the physical map and
its comparisons with rice and wheat are available at http://phymap.ucdavis.edu/brachypodium/.

Background
Model systems play an important role in studies of
genome structure and evolution, and are invaluable in
gene isolation and functional characterization. The application of model systems toward the study of both basic
and applied problems in plant biology has become routine. The model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana has been used in
studies ranging from nutrient uptake and metabolism to
plant-pathogen interactions. Unfortunately, due to its distant relationship to monocots, Arabidopsis is not an ideal
model for grasses. Rice is being currently used as a grass
model [1], but its primary adaptation to semi-aquatic,
subtropical environments limits its usefulness. The large
sizes of rice plants and long generation time make experiments requiring large numbers of plants grown under
controlled conditions costly. It is also challenging to grow
rice under the conditions prevailing in greenhouses in
northern climates.
Brachypodium distachyon has numerous attributes expected
to find in a genetic model and interest in using it as a
model system for wheat and other temperate grasses is
growing rapidly [2-8]. Diploid B. distachyon is closely
related to the Triticeae [9,10] but in contrast to the Triticeae, it possesses a very small genome (x = 5) of approximately 355 Mb [9,11]. The recent release of 8× B.
distachyon genome sequence showed that the genome is
271 Mb in size (assembled sequences, http://www.brach
ypodium.org). It is a small temperate grass with simple
growth requirements, short generation time, and self-pollinating habit [2,6,7,9]. Highly efficient transformation of
B. distachyon via Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been developed, which will facilitate its functional genomics and
biotechnological applications [12-14]. These characteristics make B. distachyon superbly suitable for both functional and comparative genomic research.
Several genomic regions of B. distachyon and B. sylvaticum,
a close relative of B. distachyon with a larger genome, have
been compared with wheat and rice. In general, good
colinearity was observed reflecting general conservation
of synteny across the grass family [15-19]. To foster the
development of B. distachyon as a grass model and coordinate the development of its genomics resources, the International Brachypodium Initiative was formed http://
www.brachypodium.org. The Initiative placed a high priority on the development of a global physical map of diploid B. distachyon composed of large genomic fragments
cloned in a bacterial artificial chromosome vector (BAC)
http://www.brachypodium.org/node/8. A high resolution
BAC-based physical map has many genomics applications
including analyzing genome structure, conducting
genome-wide comparisons, and facilitating the assembly
of B. distachyon genome sequence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/496

The development of a Brachypodium BAC-based physical
map is reported here. Also reported is a global comparison
of the map with rice genome sequence [1] and wheat deletion bin maps [20] with the goal to obtain a clearer picture
of B. distachyon genome structure and evolutionary history
and their relationships to those of rice and wheat.

Results and Discussion
BAC source, fingerprinting, and contig assembly
A total of 67,151 clones of HindIII and BamHI BAC libraries developed from the diploid B. distachyon accession
Bd21 [21] were fingerprinted using the SNaPshot HICF
BAC fingerprinting method [22,23]. To generate more
information about each clone, a GS1200Liz size standard,
which allows sizing of restriction fragments up to 1,000
bp (Figure 1A), was used. The use of GS1200Liz necessitated using the 50-cm capillary array for the ABI 3730XL,
instead of the standard 36-cm capillary array that is used
for electrophoresis of fragments ranging from 50 bp to
500 bp [22,24,25]. Large-size fragments are less frequent
than small-size fragments in the SNaPshot HICF profiles
(Figure 1B), and are more valuable in contig assembly
because they are less likely to be shared by chance [22].
Since more large fragments could be called using the
GS1200Liz as size standard, fragments with size less than
100 bp were not used for contig assembly in this study.

Cross-contamination and low quality fingerprinting data
interfere with accurate contig assembly [24]. Contaminated clones, empty clones, small insert clones, and
clones with fingerprints below specified quality threshold
were eliminated with the GenoProfiler program [26]. Of
the 67,151 fingerprinted clones, 52,343 clones (78%)
were suitable for contig assembly. An average fingerprint
had 79.4 restriction fragments in this population of fingerprints. Since the average insert size was 100 kb [21],
there was on the average a restriction fragment every 1.26
kb.
The 52,343 fingerprints representing 14× B. distachyon
genome equivalents were used for an initial automated
contig assembly using the FPC software [27]. The initial
assembly was performed at a relatively high stringency (1
× 10-45) to minimize faulty contig assembly of clones
from unrelated regions of the genome. The "DQer" function was used to dissemble contigs containing more than
10% questionable (Q) clones. The "End to End" FPC
function was then repeatedly employed to merge contigs
with successively less stringent Sulston score cutoff values
[24,25,28]. In the end, the FPC assembly resulted in 648
contigs containing a total of 50,182 BAC clones. In this
"Phase I" physical map, 177 contigs had more than 100
clones each, 73 contigs had 50 - 99 clones each, 72 contigs
had 10 - 49 clones, and the rest had 9 clones or less. A total
of 2,161 singletons remained. The cumulative, contigu-

Figure 1A shows an example of fingerprinting profile of a digested BAC clone using GS1200Liz as a size standard. The fingerprinting of each BAC involved digestion with five restricted enzymes and labeling with four fluorescent dyes as described previously [22]. The size for each fragment was calculated based on co-migration of size standard in the capillary. Figure 1B shows
the frequency of fragments with different sizes in 14,231 fingerprinted Brachypodium BAC clones. Large peaks represent vector
fragments that appear in high frequencies. The red line defines the threshold for high frequency fragments derived from BAC
inserts. Fragments with a frequency above the threshold were removed prior to contig assembly due to their likely origin from
repetitive sequences.

ous, non-redundant fragment count across all contigs was
equivalent to approximately 410 Mb, which was 15.5%
more than the estimated size of B. distachyon genome (355
Mb) [9,11]; if the genome size of 271 Mb based on the
recent release of 8× genome sequence assembly http://
www.brachypodium.org is used, the fragment count
would be equivalent to 51.3% more of the estimated
genome size. This indicated that many contigs actually
overlapped other contigs, but the overlaps were below
contig joining threshold. Such overestimation has been
reported in physical maps of other plant genomes [25,29].
Editing of contigs by alignments with the rice genome
sequence
Integration of molecular markers into contigs is crucial for
their anchoring on genetic maps and ultimate alignment
of a physical map and genome sequence. This task can be
accomplished by screening BAC libraries with pools of
labeled probes derived from EST clones or mapped
genetic markers or screening of multidimensional pools
of BAC clones by PCR or highly parallel Illumina GoldenGate assays [30-33]. BAC end sequences (BESs), in addition to other genomic applications [34-37], can facilitate
initial genome characterization [3,28,34,35] and anchoring of contigs onto the genetic map. BESs are particularly
useful for contig anchoring in small, gene-dense genomes.
Their utility is diminished in large and complex genomes
due to a low gene density. For example, in wheat, over
80% of the genome consists of repetitive DNA (reviewed
in [38]). Akhunov et al. [39] reported that coding
sequences accounted for only 5.8, 4.5, and 4.8% of BES in
T. uratu, Ae. speltoides, and Ae. tauschii BAC libraries,
respectively. A total of 38 Mb of random B. distachyon
genomic sequence was generated by sequencing 64,694
BAC ends from the two BAC libraries, representing
~14.0% of the genome sequence on the basis of a genome
size of 271 Mb http://www.brachypodium.org. This was
equivalent to one sequence tag every 4.2 kb (considering
271 Mb of the genome size). A total of 25.3% of repeatmasked B. distachyon BESs had matches to the rice genome
sequence (E < 10-25). Among them, 13,970 also matched
wheat ESTs [3]. Therefore, the integration of B. distachyon
BES into the contigs immediately anchored a large
number of contigs onto the rice genome sequence and
wheat deletion maps (see discussion below).

BES of fingerprinted clones facilitated manual editing and
contig assembly validation. This was based on the
assumption that closely related grass genomes share
extensive colinearity. The colinearity of contigs with the
rice genome can be used to assess quality of SNaPshotbased BAC fingerprinting technology and contig assembly. Brachypodium contigs with BESs allowed for direct
alignment of contigs with rice pseudomolecules; BLAT
[40] was used for finding sequence similarities, which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/496

were then used by SyMAP (Synteny Mapping and Analysis
Program [41]) for computing the synteny blocks and visualizing the results (Figure 2 and results below). These
alignments were used to guide contig editing and disjoining, as it was inevitable that miss-assembled BAC contigs
occurred due to a number of factors including chimeric
clones and cross-contamination. In addition, contig
merging was performed with successively increasing cutoffs (as high as 1 × 10-14), so it was likely that some merging could result in false joining of two unrelated regions.
We used alignments with the rice genome as reference to
provide supporting evidence during disjoining problem
contigs. During contig editing, when two merged contigs
aligned to two different regions in the rice genome, the
merge was rejected and the merged contigs were disjoined. The same strategy can be applied to miss-assembled contigs. When a contig is aligned to different rice
genomic regions, the contig should be further evaluated
to identify potential assembly problems. For example, in
the initial assembly, Contig10 was aligned to two
genomic blocks on rice chromosome 1, separated by over
35 Mb (Figure 2). It was found that the contig contained
two clusters linked by two BAC clones, DB064D23 and
DB064F23. These two clones reside near each other in a
96-well plate, indicating that cross-contamination may
have occurred during fingerprinting process (inoculation
or transfer) and probably resulted in two shared fingerprint profiles just below the predefined contamination
threshold. Contig 10 was disjoined into two after removing the two clones during the contig editing process.
The integration of BES into contigs and manual editing of
contigs using rice genome as a reference improved contig
assembly by disjoining 23 contigs. The final assembly
contained 671 contigs, which included BESs. This assembly is called "Phase II physical map" of the B. distachyon
genome. Figure 3 shows an example of a contig in the
Phase II physical map. The view of the complete set of B.
distachyon
contigs

at

map.ucdavis.edu/brachypodium/.
Comparison of B. distachyon contigs with the rice genome
The alignment of contigs of the Phase II B. distachyon
physical map to the rice genome sequence estimated the
genome coverage. A total of 345 contigs (51.4%) could be
aligned to the rice genome sequence. They covered 336
Mb (88%) of the rice genome sequence (using 382 Mb as
1C rice genome size, [1]) and represented 88% of the total
B. distachyon FPC map as measured by CB units. When
only contigs with more than 10 clones were used, 331 out
of 364 (90.9%) could be aligned to the rice genome.
Although 326 contigs could not be anchored, these contigs were generally small, and the total number of clones
in them equaled to only 2,489 (5.0%) out of the total
50,182 clones, indicating that only a small portion of the

clones could not been anchored onto the rice genome.
The data suggested a general conservation of synteny
between rice and B. distachyon genomes, which confirms
previous conclusions made on the basis of sequencing a
few B. sylvaticum BAC clones and their sequence comparisons with the orthologous regions in rice and wheat [15].
Ideally, B. distachyon contigs should be ordered using a
high-resolution genetic map. Such a map was not available to us. However, the SyMAP alignment of the FPC contigs onto the sequenced rice chromosomes ordered many
of the contigs into synteny blocks with putative chromosome assignments and showed extensive colinearity of
contigs with the rice genome sequences. For instance,
Contig 91 appeared to be highly colinear with a 7-Mb
region in rice chromosome 3 although several small local
inversions could be identified (Figure 4). Out of 160 BESs
in this contig homologous to the rice genome sequence,
117 (73%) were homologous to sequences in this region
on rice chromosome 3, while 53 were homologous with

sequences in different regions of the rice genome, presumably representing non-colinear genes. Previous alignment
of ten sequenced B. distachyon BAC clones with the orthologous rice regions also revealed a general synteny conservation between rice and B. distachyon [19]. It was found
that 15% B. distachyon and 19% rice genes were not
present in the corresponding orthologous regions [19].
The non-colinear genes reflect the divergence of the two
genomes after the split from a common ancestor during
phylogeny of the grass family [42].
A SyMap dot-plot (Figure 5A) shows correspondence of
most B. distachyon contigs to specific regions of the rice
genomic sequence. This is consistent with the estimation
that the B. distachyon contigs cover 336 Mb or ~88% of the
rice genome. A question remains whether or not these
alignments provide evidence of general colinearity
between rice and B. distachyon chromosomes. Although
the B. distachyon contigs are not ordered, the following
line of reasoning suggests that the B. distachyon and rice

Comparative analyses of Brachypodium contigs against rice genome. Figure 5A. The SyMAP dotplot analysis of Brachypodium contig blocks against rice genome. The Brachypodium contigs were first aligned to 12 rice chromosomes based on
BLAT analysis to generate 12 Brachypodium synteny contig blocks. These 12 Brachypodium synteny blocks were then compared
with the pseudomolecules of rice chromosomes using dotplot analysis. Synteny blocks were detected, and background noise
was filtered with SyMap [41]. Figure 5B. Ancient duplication within the rice and Brachypodium genomes. Evidence of ancient
duplication can been seen when the rice chromosome is colinear to two Brachypodium contig blocks as highlighted by colored
lines in the two genomes.

to chromosome number differences, this leaves only 19
contigs, or 5% of the total 364 contigs to be potentially
due to actual or artifactual breaks in colinearity. Since
there is no compelling reason why breaks in gene colinearity should coincide with gaps between BAC contigs, we
therefore conclude that B. distachyon and rice chromosomes are highly colinear and most of the neighboring
contigs on the dot-plot alignment in Figure 5A are good
candidates for joining.
Most plant genomes are paleopolyploid with ancient
whole-genome duplications [43-48]. The radiation of
grasses was preceded by paleotetraploidy resulting in a
whole-genome duplication [46], which was followed by
diploidization by deletions. Therefore, in regions that are
still duplicated in the B. distachyon genome, a rice region
will align strongly with one B. distachyon contig block and
weakly with another. This is evident in Figure 5B, where
two B. distachyon syntenic contig blocks can be identified
for several rice chromosomes. These data show that the B.
distachyon genome has a similar set of duplications
derived from the ancient paleotetraploid as does rice.
Alignment of wheat EST deletion bin map to B.
distachyon contigs
The 1C nucleus of hexaploid T. aestivum contains 16,000
Mb DNA [49], which makes map-based cloning of wheat
genes very difficult. Because B. distachyon diverged from
the wheat phylogenetic lineage only about 30 million
years ago (MYA) [15], B. distachyon physical map and ultimately genome sequence can facilitate wheat map-based
cloning and other genomic applications.

A total of 7,104 expressed sequence tag (EST) unigenes
were previously mapped into 156 deletion bins, providing a genome-wide framework for wheat mapping and
identifying agronomically important genes [20]. However, a disadvantage of the deletion bin map is that loci
are not ordered within the bins. Given the general colinearity among the grass genomes, this problems can be partially overcome by in silico ordering of wheat ESTs using
rice genomic sequence [50]. Brachypodium is expected to
show better synteny with wheat than rice because it
diverged from wheat more recently than rice [3], Brachypodium is therefore expected to be more useful in comparative mapping applications than rice.
To assess the utility of B. distachyon physical map for
wheat genomics, we compared the Brachypodium contigs
with the wheat deletion bin map [20]. Of 7,104 deletion
bin mapped wheat ESTs, 985 matched Brachypodium BESs
at an e-value cutoff of 1× 10-10. These matches were
derived from BESs associated with 216 contigs (32% of
total Brachypodium contigs). Such analysis allowed us to
align Brachypodium contigs onto individual chromosomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/496

based on wheat deletion bin map data http://phy
map.ucdavis.edu/brachypodium/.
Comparison of Brachypodium contigs with the wheat deletion bin map and the rice genome sequence provided a
genome-wide view of genome evolution among these species. Figure 6 shows an example of such a comparison.
Contig138 contained 1,380 BAC clones with 1,402 BESs
and spanned 2.2 Mb (estimated from a relationship
between CB units and Mb). A total of 16 wheat ESTs in the
deletion bins matched BESs in this contig. Eight of them
were mapped in the distal bins 1AS3-0.86-1.00, 1AS10.47-0.86, 1BS.sat18-0.50-1.00, 1BS.sat19-0.31.0.50,
1BS.sat19-0.31-0.50,
1BS.sat-0.31,
1BS9-0.84-1.06,
1DS5-0.70-1.00, 1DS1-0.59-0.70, and 1DS3-0.48-0.59 on
wheat chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D [20] (Figure 6). They
were distributed across two to three bins on each chromosome, indicating that the contig spans multiple bins on
wheat group 1 chromosomes (Figure 6). In most cases, the
order of BESs in a contig homologous to wheat ESTs correlated with the order of bins along a chromosome arm
into which these ESTs were mapped. These data suggested
that Contig138 represented an orthologous region of
these deletion bins. Alignment with rice genome indicated that Contig138 was colinear with a region on rice
chromosome 5. Among eight colinear wheat ESTs
between Brachypodium and wheat, three ESTs (BF484606,
BF428943, and BG604768) were not colinear with the
rice orthologous region. BF428943 and BG604768 were
homologous to genes on rice chromosome 2, suggesting
gene duplication/deletion either in rice or in the Pooideae
lineage after Pooideae diverged from Ehrhartoideae but
before divergence of Brachypodium. No match to
BE484606 was found in the rice genome based on BLAST
searches.
ESTs BF473313 and BE446475 homologous to BES
sequences of Contig138 also have no match in the rice
genome, but were mapped on long arms of wheat chromosomes of homeologous groups 1 and 7, respectively.
These genes are only present in Brachypodium and wheat
but are not located in colinear positions in the two
genomes. Another EST locus, BM138418, is colinear only
between Brachypodium and rice since this EST was mapped
to the chromosome 3B in wheat based on the wheat deletion bin map result. Two ESTs, BF484988 and BG313703,
at the top of Contig138 were mapped to the short arm on
wheat chromosomes of homeologous group 5. In rice,
they matched sequences on chromosome 1. Other examples of noncolinear genes among the three genomes were
observed. Occasional perturbations of synteny between
Brachypodium, rice and wheat must therefore be expected
and taken into account in comparative genomic applications. Since synteny of wheat chromosomes has been
eroded faster in the distal regions than in proximal

line. A schematic drawing of wheat group 1 chromosomes and associated deletion bins as indicated by colored boxes are provided to specify the fraction lengths of wheat chromosome bins. ESTs in blue represent those that were mapped to different
regions in the wheat genome. Colinear ESTs between rice and Brachypodium are indicated by a star. BAC clones are indicated
by a solid vertical bar in Contig138. The approximate distance along the contig was calculated based on CB units and is indicated in Mb.
regions [51], perturbed synteny should be expected particularly in genomic comparisons with Brachypodium involving distal regions of wheat chromosomes. Synteny
perturbations observed in contig 138 exemplify this real-

ity since the contig is orthologous to a distal region of the
short arm of chromosome 1.
To further expand the utility of the Brachypodium physical
map, we integrated wheat ESTs that have not been placed

into wheat deletion bins into Brachypodium contigs. There
are over one million wheat ESTs in Genbank, and they
have been assembled into 42,848 unigene sets http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene. Using BLAT, 5,421 different unigenes were integrated to the Brachypodium contigs. They were homologous to a total of 5,910 BES in the
physical map. These wheat EST markers will further facilitate comparative mapping in wheat. The comparison of
Brachypodium contigs with wheat deletion maps and integration of wheat unigenes into Brachypodium contigs can
be accessed at http://phymap.ucdavis.edu/brachypo
dium/.

Conclusion
A whole-genome, BAC-based physical map for the new
grass model species, Brachypodium, was constructed. The
map facilitated a variety of genomic applications. Comparison of contigs with rice revealed high colinearity
between rice and Brachypodium chromosomes. Additionally, many Brachypodium BAC contigs could be anchored
on the wheat deletion bin maps. Both outcomes support
the anticipated utility of Brachypodium for wheat comparative genomics and practical applications in map-based
cloning of wheat genes. Another application of the physical map is in the Brachypodium genome sequencing
project. The phase II physical map can be aligned with
shotgun sequence contigs via BES and provide scaffolds
for ordering shotgun sequence contigs and estimating gap
sizes. The BAC-based physical map reported here was provided to the Brachypodium distachyon sequence assembly
team and has helped produce a high quality final
sequence assembly http://www.brachypodium.org/node/
18. The physical map can also identify BACs spanning
sequence gaps and has served as sequencing template to
fill them. Brachypodium is expected to serve as a surrogate
to assist gene discovery and functional characterization in
the large and complex crop genomes, such as wheat and
bioenergy crops. All the data and resources developed in
this study are available at the http://phymap.ucdavis.edu/
brachypodium/ website for community use.

Methods
Bacterial artificial chromosomal (BAC) libraries
The B. distachyon BAC libraries used in this study were previously constructed using partial digests with HindIII and
BamHI restriction enzymes from an inbred diploid line of
B. distachyon, Bd21, the same line selected for complete
sequencing by the US Department of Energy Joint
Genome Institute through its "Community Sequencing
Program"
http://www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/
51281.html[21]. These BAC libraries represent ~29.2-fold
haploid genome equivalents and were employed for BAC
fingerprinting and contig assembly.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/496

BAC fingerprinting and fragment sizing
The BAC clones were fingerprinted as described by [22]
with minor modifications. From each 384-well plate, four
96-well blocks containing 1.2 ml of 2× YT medium plus
12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol were inoculated with a 96well replicator. Two pins were removed from the replicator to allow the insertion of control clones into the 96well plate. Two control BAC clones were inserted manually in wells E07 and H12 in each 96-well block. The
plates were covered with Airpore gas permeable plate sealant (Qiagen) and shaken on an orbital shaker agitated at
400 rpm at 37°C for 20 hours. BAC DNA was isolated
with the Qiagen R.E.A.L 96-Prep kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
California). The following minor modifications of the fingerprinting method were made to accommodate the use
of ABI3730XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) instead of ABI3100 for capillary electrophoresis. The
more sensitive laser of the ABI3730XL instrument
improved fingerprinting resolution and made it possible
to reduce the amount of BAC DNA sample for electrophoresis, thus lowering fingerprinting costs. To reduce
sample size, 0.5-1.2 μg instead of 1.0-2.0 μg of BAC DNA
was simultaneously digested with 2.0 instead of 5.0 units
each BamHI, EcoRI, XbaI, XhoI and HaeIII (New England
Biolabs, Beverly, Massachusetts) at 37°C for 3 hrs. The
DNA was labeled with 0.4 μl instead of 1.0 μl of the SNaPshot kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) at
65°C for 1 hr and precipitated with ethanol. The labeled
DNA was dissolved in 9.9 μl of Hi-Di formamide, and 0.3
μl of GeneScan 1200 LIZ (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
California) was added to each sample as an internal size
standard. Restriction fragments were sized with
ABI3730XL using 50 cm capillaries and POP7 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, California). The fragment size
calling was accomplished with the GeneMaper software
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) with the
help of FP Pipeliner http://www.bioinforsoft.com/.
Fingerprints editing and contig assembly
The fingerprint profiles for each BAC clone were collected
by GeneMapper v3.7 (Applied Biosystems). The GeneMaper output data was edited with the GenoProfiler program
[26]. The two control BAC clones inserted in each 96-well
plate were used to check for the correct orientation of the
plate. Fragments in the size range of 100 - 1,000 bp were
measured. For the data quality control, vector bands and
clones failing fingerprinting or lacking inserts were
removed using GenoProfiler program. In addition, samples with less than 40 or more than 150 fragments were
also eliminated. Fingerprints of cross-contaminated samples were detected using a module in the GenoProfiler
[26] and removed from the data set. The cross-contamination was defined as clones residing in neighboring wells
either in 384-well format or 96-well format (quadrants)

share 30% or more of the mean number of fragments, the
formula is shared bands*2/(bands1 + bands2).
A total of 52,343 BAC clones that passed quality check
were used to assemble contigs using the FPC v8.5.3 [27].
The initial assembly used a Sulston score of 1× 10-45 and a
tolerance 0.4 bp. The contig assembly was processed
through the DQ function of FPC to break up contigs having more than 10% Q-clones in a contig. The assembly
was further refined using "Single-to-End" and "End-toEnd" merging by stepwise decreasing of assembly stringency of Sulston score cutoff values (down to 1× 10-14).
Alignment of FPC contig with the rice genome and wheat
deletion bin map
There were 64,697 BAC end sequences generated from the
fingerprinted B. distachyon BAC clones [3] which were
compared using BLAT [40] against the rice pseudomolecules build 4.0 http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/IRGSP/Build4/
build4.html. The results were used as input into Synteny
Mapping and Analysis Program (SyMap) [41], which
computed the synteny blocks. The results can be viewed
from the SyMAP Java based dot-plot, synteny block to
chromosome, and close-up views.

To anchor B. distachyon physical contigs to the wheat deletion bin map, BAC-end sequence data from the B. distachyon BACs were compared against sequences of the
mapped wheat EST probe sets using BLAT (parameters
minScore = 50, minIdentity = 80%) and links to the wheat
deletion bin map constructed [20,52]. The BLAT alignments and FPC anchoring were carried out using FPC
modules BSS, which is designed for this purpose [53]. The
CMAP http://gmod.org/wiki/Cmap tool allowed for comparative analysis between the B. distachyon physical contigs and wheat deletion bin map.
