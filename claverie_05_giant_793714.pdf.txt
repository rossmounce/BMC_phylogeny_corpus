Abstract
Giant double-stranded DNA viruses (such as record breaking Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus),
with particle sizes of 0.2 to 0.6 µm, genomes of 300 kbp to 1.200 kbp, and commensurate complex
gene contents, constitute an evolutionary mystery. They challenge the common vision of viruses,
traditionally seen as highly streamlined genomes optimally fitted to the smallest possible -filterablepackage. Such giant viruses are now discovered in increasing numbers through the systematic
sampling of ocean waters as well as freshwater aquatic environments, where they play a significant
role in controlling phyto- and bacterio- plankton populations. The 4th algal virus workshop showed
that the study of these ecologically important viruses is now massively entering the genomic era,
promising a better understanding of their diversity and, hopefully, some insights on their origin and
the evolutionary forces that shaped their genomes.

Report
The 4th Algal Virus Workshop http://www.avw4.org
organized by Corina Brussaard and Herman Gons, and
hosted by the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea
Research, was held in Amsterdam 17–21 april 2005.
Though marine ecology rather than basic virology was the
main focus of this meeting, exciting new results on the
genomics of large/giant viruses kept turning up in many
talks. In the context of a comparative study, Corina Brussaard (in collaboration with the US DoE) is herself
sequencing a variety of Micromonas pusilla and Phaeocystis
globosa dsDNA viruses some of them estimated to have a
genome sizes up to 460 kb.
In his overview, Curtis Suttle (University of British
Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) pointed out that viruses
(including RNA-, DNA-, prokaryotic and eukaryotic
viruses) constitute a significant part of the biomass in
ocean coastal waters (with up to 50 millions particles/ml,

for a total estimate of 25 to 270 Megatons in the oceans)
where they play a dominant role in the control of phytoand bacterio-plankton populations, and hence on the
production of oxygen and atmospheric dimethylsulphide,
an important factor in climate regulation. Most of these
viruses are uncharacterized [1].
Ironically, this is in a freshwater unicellular green alga that
the best characterized large DNA virus Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus (PBCV-1), the prototype of the Phycodnaviridae, was isolated more than 20 years ago in Jim van
Etten's laboratory (University of Nebraska, Lincoln)[2].
Liza Fitzgerald (Van Etten's laboratory) reported on the
ongoing annotation of the genomic sequences of two new
species of Paramecium bursaria chlorella viruses: NY-2A
(infecting PBCV-1 host Chlorella species NC64A) and
Chlorella Pbi virus MT325. NY-2A genome contains
368,683 bp, making it the largest chlorella virus
sequenced to date. Despite a 10% difference in size, the

NY-2A genome and PBCV-1 genome (330 kb) exhibits a
near perfect colinearity. With 314,335 bp the MT325
genome is slightly smaller and does not exhibit long range
colinearity with the PBCV-1 and NY-2A genomes. As in
previously sequenced phycodnaviridae, new unexpected
functions turned up to be encoded is these two new
genomes, such as the first aquaglycerolporin the activity
of which has been experimentally verified. A detailed
comparative proteomics of the three viral particles (each
of them exhibiting about 120 virus-encoded polypeptides) is also under way in the same laboratory (D. Dunigan et al.).

It was known for some time that filamentous marine
brown alga of genus Feldmannia were infected by large
dsDNA viruses (phaeovirus) coming in two genome sizes:
158 kbp and 178 kbp [3]. Prof. T-J. Choi, (Pukyong
National University, Busan, Korea) reported on the completion of the genome sequencing of the "short" form of
FsV infecting Feldmannia sp. The final sequence size is
153,259 bp (51.8 G+C). About 50% of the 161 predicted
ORFs have their best matching homologues in Feldmannia
irregularis virus (FirrV-1) or Ectocarpus Siliculosus virus
(EsV-1). Nicolas Delaroque (Max Plank Institute for
Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany) reported on the diffi-

culty to reach full closure in sequencing the genome of
Feldmannia irregularis virus (FirrV-1), most probably due
to the presence of long repeats. The current FirrV genome
sequence data consists of 191,667 bp (in 16 contigs),
encoding 156 putative proteins [4]. His more recent
experiments suggest that FirrV infection may lead to the
release of a mixture of virus forms associated with a wide
range of genome sizes (from 192 kbp to 10 kbp).
Dr Keizo Nagasaki and his collaborators (National
Research Institute of Fisheries, Hiroshima, Japan)
announced the near completion of the 356 kbp-genome
sequence of HcV01, a dsDNA virus infecting dinoflagelate
Heterocapsa circularisquama, and of the 294 kbp-genome
sequence of Heterosigma akashivo infecting virus (HaV01).
The same laboratory is also finishing the sequencing of
the 145 kb-genome of T4-like looking cyanophage MaLMM01, infecting the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis
aeruginosa.
Finally, Willie Wilson's group (Plymouth Marine Laboratory, UK) claimed the bronze medal in the fierce competition for genome size [5]. They presented the complete
genome sequence of Coccolithovirus EhV-86, a ds-DNA
infecting alien-looking calcarous nanoplankton Emiliania
huxleyi (Fig. 1). The genome is made of 407,339 bp
(40.2% G+C) and encodes 472 putative protein coding
regions. Only 66 (14%) of them have recognizable homologues in the public databases. As other giant viruses, EhV86 exhibits its share of unexpected genes and functions,
most notably a number of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids. Albeit phylogenetically
branching at the root of the Phycodnaviridae (e.g. PBCV-1
or EsV), EhV-86 does encode it own DNA-dependent RNA
polymerase complex, thus filling the gap with the other
Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA virus families (Irido-,
Asfar-, Pox-, and Mimi-viridae) that all exhibit virallyencoded RNA-polymerases. Pending approval by ICTV,
EhV-86 might become the prototype of the coccolythovirinae, a new subfamily of phycodnaviridae.
In his closing lecture, Jim Van Etten, reminded the new
comers in the field of algal viruses that reports of very
large icosahedral virus-like particles in various aquatic
and marine organisms can be traced back to the 50's, but
failed to elicit much interest outside of the community of
marine biologists. The discovery and genome characterization of the large freshwater chlorella viruses [2], and
more recently of giant amoeba infecting Mimivirus [6]
(remotely related to phycodnaviruses but not an algal
virus) elicited a renewed interest in the genomics of these
large marine viruses, as they may provide new insight on
the early evolution of eukaryotes. Not unexpectedly, close
relatives of Mimivirus appear to exist in the marine environment, as suggested by the numerous homologous

sequences found by J.-M. Claverie and E. Ghedin (The
Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, USA) in their
exhaustive analysis [7] of the Sargasso Sea environmental
data set [8].
The 4th Algal Virus Workshop made it clear that these
giant algal viruses are now entering the genomic era at full
speed. The amount of surprises that we can expect while
deciphering their genomes will be as big as their diversity,
and more dogma on what a virus should look like will
probably be shattered along the way.
