Y RNAvRNAtelomerase RNAVPARPTEP1Ro60

Abstract
Background: Ribonucleoproteins carry out a variety of important tasks in the cell. In this study
we show that a number of these contain a novel module, that we speculate mediates RNA-binding.
Results: The TROVE module – Telomerase, Ro and Vault module – is found in TEP1 and Ro60
the protein components of three ribonucleoprotein particles. This novel module, consisting of one
or more domains, may be involved in binding the RNA components of the three RNPs, which are
telomerase RNA, Y RNA and vault RNA. A second conserved region in these proteins is shown
to be a member of the vWA domain family. The vWA domain in TEP1 is closely related to the
previously recognised vWA domain in VPARP a second component of the vault particle. This vWA
domain may mediate interactions between these vault components or bind as yet unidentified
components of the RNPs.
Conclusions: This work suggests that a number of ribonucleoprotein components use a common
RNA-binding module. The TROVE module is also found in bacterial ribonucleoproteins suggesting
an ancient origin for these ribonucleoproteins.

Background
Many important cellular components are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, such as the spliceosome and ribosome that have key roles in gene regulation and
translation. The telomerase RNP is a reverse transcriptase
that maintains the telomeric repeats of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomerase is composed of two proteins, the
functionally essential reverse transcriptase TERT and the
non-essential TEP1 (also known as TP1 or TLP1) as well
as the telomerase RNA. TEP1 [1,2] is also found to be a
component of the enigmatic vault RNP [3]. The vault is a

huge structure (13 Md) of unknown function. The vault
RNP is mainly composed of the major vault protein MVP,
but also contains smaller amounts of TEP1 and VPARP as
well as the vault RNA. Although predominately cytoplasmic, a portion of vaults are found associated with nuclear
pores [4]. Vaults have been suggested to be involved in
multidrug resistance, nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, and
formation of RNPs [5]. While investigating the components of these RNPs an interesting protein similarity was
noticed.

Results and Discussion
The complete sequence of the Tetrahymena thermophilus
telomerase p80 component (Swiss:Q94818), a homologue of TEP1, was used to seed a PSI-blast (Position Specific Iterated-Blast) search at NCBI using the default
inclusion threshold [6]. The search identified the vertebrate telomerase/vault component TEP1 and uncharacterised bacterial sequences from Clostridium thermocellum,
Cytophaga hutchinsonii, Streptomyces coelicolor and Salmonella typhimurium in the first round. The second round of
searching identified vertebrate homologues of the Ro60
ribonucleoprotein, with E-values as low as 6 × 10-12, as
well as three further bacterial sequences from Pseudomonas
fluorescens, Nostoc punctiforme and Deinococcus radiodurans.
The sequence of D. radiodurans has been previously identified as a homologue of the vertebrate Ro60 protein [7].
A short region of similarity between p80 and Ro60 was

noted previously, but the biological significance of this
observation was not discussed further [2].
Ro60 is the protein component of the Ro RNP complex,
that also contains a Y RNA. The region of similarity
between Ro60 and TEP1 was over 800 amino acids in
length. Protein domains range from 30 to 500 amino
acids in length, therefore the region of similarity between
Ro60 and TEP1 was too long to be a single domain, so
smaller regions of these proteins were investigated. A PSIblast search with the C-terminal residues 514 to 719 of
p80 revealed matches to known vWA proteins; indicating
that the C-terminal region in these proteins is a vWA
domain. This new search also identified VPARP a polyADP-ribose polymerase associated with the vault complex
[8] (see also http://www.vaults.arc.ucla.edu/) as containing a closely related vWA domain that was noted previ-

ously [9]. It is somewhat surprising that two components
of the vault have a highly related vWA domain. It has been
suggested that the vWA domain in VPARP binds to a metal
ion and might be involved in complex assembly [10].
However, the region of the vWA domain is unlikely to be
a site of major vault protein (MVP) binding [9] so perhaps
it could be involved in an interaction between TEP1 and
VPARP, or bind an as yet unidentified transient
component.
The amino-terminal 500 amino acids of p80 were found
to be restricted to TEP1, Ro60 and other uncharacterised
bacterial proteins using PSI-blast as above. A multiple
sequence alignment of this region is shown in Figure 1.
This region is large ranging from 286 residues in the C.
thermocellem homologue to 485 residues in the p80 protein from Tetrahymena thermophila and so may not correspond to a single protein domain. Therefore we call this
evolutionary conserved region a module. The longer
members of this family have multiple long insertions that
are not found in the shorter homologues. This region is
named the TROVE module after Telomerase, Ro and Vault
ribonucleoprot eins in which it is found. The alignment of
the TROVE module contains a few absolutely conserved
residues. None of these conserved residues are the polar
types of amino acids found in active sites, so it seems
unlikely this region has an enzymatic function. Tetrahymena p80 is known to bind telomerase RNA [11], so the
RNA-binding activity must reside in either the TROVE or
vWA domains of p80. Given the known functions of vWA

domains it is likely that the RNA-binding function resides
within the TROVE module.
An RNA-binding RRM domain has been proposed in the
Ro60 proteins from human, frog and worm [12] due to
the presence of the two classic RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs
[13]. This domain would lie within the proposed TROVE
module. Although there are interesting similarities with
the RNP RNA-binding motifs, examination of the broader
TROVE alignment indicates that the 4th RNP-1 position
(marked with an asterisk in Figure 1), is a conserved polar
residue. However, in known RRM domains this position
is a buried beta-sheet anchor residue, and consistently
non-polar. In addition the spacing of the proposed RNP1 and RNP-2 motifs in human and frog would be one of
the shortest observed separations in RRM domains, and is
inconsistent with the known structures of RRMs. Based on
this sequence analysis it seems that the presence of an
RRM although plausible based on Ro60 function is
unlikely.
Common domains are often found in proteins involved
in related cellular processes. For example the PAZ domain
is found in Dicer and Piwi proteins that are involved in
post-transcriptional gene silencing [14] and are both part
of the RISC complex. The discovery of the TROVE module
in three RNPs is intriguing and suggests that these three
RNPs might be involved in inter-related processes.
What is the function of the bacterial TROVE containing
proteins? The Deinococcus homologue is known to be

part of a Ro-like RNP that even contains a Y-like RNA molecule [7]. Building a phylogenetic tree of the TROVE module alignment, see figure 3, shows that the Deinococcus
homologue does indeed cluster with the known Ro60
proteins, as does the Nostoc punctiforme homologue. It
seems likely that Nostoc punctiforme also contains a Ro
RNP. The other bacterial homologues cannot be attributed to either the TEP1-like or Ro60-like subfamilies. So
we cannot assign any function to these proteins except
that they may be part of an as yet unidentified RNP complex. Given the wide but patchy distribution of the TROVE
module containing proteins we suggest that they are an
ancient RNA-binding component of RNP complexes.
