Abstract
Background: A large number of theories have been advanced to explain why genes involved in
the same biochemical processes are often co-located in genomes. Most of these theories have been
dismissed because empirical data do not match the expectations of the models. In this work we
test the hypothesis that cluster formation is most likely due to a selective pressure to gradually colocalise protein products and that operon formation is not an inevitable conclusion of the process.
Results: We have selected an exemplar well-characterised biochemical pathway, the
phenylacetate degradation pathway, and we show that its complex history is only compatible with
a model where a selective advantage accrues from moving genes closer together. This selective
pressure is likely to be reasonably weak and only twice in our dataset of 102 genomes do we see
independent formation of a complete cluster containing all the catabolic genes in the pathway.
Additionally, de novo clustering of genes clearly occurs repeatedly, even though recombination
should result in the random dispersal of such genes in their respective genomes. Interspecies gene
transfer has frequently replaced in situ copies of genes resulting in clusters that have similar content
but very different evolutionary histories.
Conclusion: Our model for cluster formation in prokaryotes, therefore, consists of a two-stage
selection process. The first stage is selection to move genes closer together, either because of
macromolecular crowding, chromatin relaxation or transcriptional regulation pressure. This
proximity opportunity sets up a separate selection for co-transcription.

Background
The aerobic degradation of phenylacetic acid in E. coli
K12 occurs via a series of five reactions, involving eleven
catabolic paa genes [1], two of which are distant paralogs, with the rest showing no sequence homology (figure 1). The first step of the pathway is catalysed by the
product of the paaK gene, a CoA ligase that catalyses the
conversion of phenylacetate into phenylacetyl-CoA. The
second step involves a ring-oxygenase complex formed
from the gene products of paaABCDE. This heteromer

converts phenylacetyl-CoA into 2'-OH-phenylacetylCoA. The third step, where 2'-OH-phenylacetyl-CoA is
converted to 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA, is jointly catalysed
by paaJ, paaG and paaZ. The fourth step sees the conversion of 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA by paaF and paaH to βketoadipyl-CoA. The final step is catalysed by paaJ,
which converts β-ketoadipyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA,
thereby connecting phenylacetate degradation with the
TCA cycle [1]. In addition to these 11 catabolic genes, E.
coli K12 has 3 other paa genes, two of which regulate the

pathway (paaX and paaY), the other has an unknown
function (paaI). Other E. coli strains such as E. coli O157
and E. coli O73 do not share homologs to all 11 catabolic
genes, with no homologs found for paaA, paaB, paaC,
paaD, paaE, paaG and paaK in either of these two
genomes. However, previous studies have identified
other bacteria as having homologs to paa genes, such as
Pseudomonas putida U [2]. In addition to these 14 genes
found in E. coli K12, a further three genes associated with
the pathway were examined in this study. These were
paaL and paaM, coding for a phenylacetic acid transporter protein and a phenylacetic acid specific porin
respectivelty, and tetR, a transcription factor.
The genes involved in phenylacetate degradation in E. coli
K12 and P. putida U are located in clusters [2,3]. In this
study we define a gene cluster as a set of functionally
related genes located in close physical proximity in a
genome. The term operon refers to a set of genes under
common regulatory control, that are transcribed into a
single mRNA and are all co-directional in orientation on
the chromosome. An operon, therefore, is a more structured instance of a cluster. All operons by definition are
also clusters, but not all clusters are operons. A gene cluster can consist entirely of independently transcribed genes
or multiple operon structures or combinations of both.
Clusters and operons are observed both in prokaryotes
and eukaryotes, however, the system of operon processing
in eukaryotes involves mRNA splicing, and is different to
the system in prokaryotes [4,5].
Clustering of genes involved in the same metabolic pathway is a widespread phenomenon [6-10], and the polycis-

tronic operon is a paradigm of prokaryotic genomic
biology [11]. However, the process of operon formation
remains poorly understood and the precise link between
clustering and operon formation has never been fully
explained, though several models exist.
The simplest model is the Natal Model where clusters
form via tandem gene duplications [12]. However, many
operons contain genes that are not homologous, but have
some kind of functional link. As a general mechanism of
operon formation, the Natal Model is inadequate.
The Fisher Model postulates that clustering of genes into
operons offers the benefit that random recombination
events will tend to separate co-adapted genes less often if
they are clustered together. This model has suffered criticism recently because of observations of orthologous
replacement in situ of operon genes [13,14] which suggests that the primary reason for operon formation is
unlikely to be the preservation of co-adapted alleles.
The Co-regulation Model [15] states that operons are
formed in order to facilitate the production of gene
products in equal measures. This theory only accounts
for operon maintenance. In order for an operon to spontaneously form, rare, highly specific recombination
events must occur. However, it has recently been asserted
that operon formation is driven by co-regulation [16].
This assertion is largely due to the more complex regulatory regions associated with operons in some gammaproteobacteria compared with genes that are not in operons. However, this study only focused on operons and
not on the broader issue of cluster formation.

The Selfish Operon Model (SOM) suggests that operons
in prokaryotes are in some respect like viruses or transposons and their formation facilitates their horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) [12]. The formation of an operon is
therefore of no direct benefit to the organism but it means
that the fitness of gene cluster itself is enhanced. An extension of the SOM posits that if HGT is indeed the main reason for operon formation, non-essential genes are more
likely to be in operons/clusters than essential genes [12].
However, Pál and Hurst [17] have provided evidence that
essential genes are more likely to be found in operons and
clusters than non-essential genes, thereby presenting a significant problem to the SOM.
Lastly, a recent proposition has been made that gene clustering is due to the relative difficulty of protein movement
through the cellular matrix [18]. This model, known as
the Protein Immobility Model (PIM), suggests that
because transcription and translation are coupled in
prokaryotes, the resulting physical proximity of enzymes
minimizes the steady state level of reaction step intermediates thereby saving energy and reducing the amount of
protein that needs to be produced. The PIM has not been
tested using empirical data, but has been supported by
computer simulation. An observation that indirectly supports the PIM is the study by Elowitz et al [19] that shows
that protein diffusion is slower through the cytoplasm
than through water, is adversely affected by the size of the
protein, and is also reduced when expression levels are
higher.
Because paa genes show a patchy phylogenetic distribution and previously observed paa clusters have diverse
structures that appear to be independent of the species
phylogeny, we felt that this pathway was important to
study from an evolutionary standpoint. Indeed, phenylacetate degradation has previously been identified as a
potential model for understanding the evolution of metabolic pathways [20]. By examining the gene content of
previously studied paa clusters a total of 17 genes are associated with the pathway including catabolic genes, regulatory genes, a transporter and an exporter. In this study we
identify new paa gene clusters and examine the structure
and distribution of paa gene clusters with respect to their
evolution and implications for models of both cluster and
operon formation.

Methods
Homolog identification
We implemented an iterative strategy for locating
homologs to all 17 genes encoding proteins involved in
the degradation of phenylacetate. Initially, the genomes
for taxa containing known paa gene clusters, previously
reported in the literature, were downloaded from GenBank [21]. The list of genomes used in the initial search

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/36

with known paa gene clusters can be found in the supplementary information http://bioinf.nuim.ie/supplemen
tary/clusters/. We used a BLAST-based [22] similarity
search strategy where we extracted all the known paa genes
from these initial genomes and used them in order to find
homologs in other completed bacterial genomes. These
additional bacterial genomes were downloaded from
GenBank, bringing the total number of genomes in the
dataset to 102.
We generated alignments using ClustalW 1.81 [23] for
genes where we found multiple homologs. The exceptions
were the paaL and paaM, genes that were only found only
in P. putida KT2440. This gave a total of 15 initial alignments. These alignments were then used as input for PSIBLAST using the default parameters [22], with the larger
dataset of 102 bacterial genomes as the input database.
This gave us a comprehensive list of homologs.
We wrote a number of PERL scripts (available on request)
to cross-reference the result files generated from the PSIBLAST searches and identify clusters of genes from this
pathway that were co-located on their respective genomes.
If two genes found in the result files generated by the PSIBLAST searches came from the same genome and had no
more than five intervening genes between them, then
such genes were considered to be an initial linked pair. All
initial linked pairs were identified and then manually
merged if they overlapped. In this way, clusters of various
sizes were identified.
Construction of phylogenetic trees
Each of the 15 gene families were used to build phylogenetic trees. The amino acid sequences of all homologs
were extracted from their genome files and each family
was aligned using Muscle v3.5 [24] with all settings at
their default values. Model selection was performed on
the alignments using ModelGenerator [25] and maximum
likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed based on
the selected models using Phyml v3.0 [26]. Confidence in
phylogenetic hypotheses was assessed using the bootstrap
resampling approach [27].
Visualisation of clusters on phylogenetic trees and operon
identification
For each gene family, we wished to visualise both the relationships among members of the family and their cluster
context simultaneously. Visualisation of each gene cluster
was achieved by extracting the necessary genomic location
information for the cluster from the corresponding GenBank file. This was carried out automatically using PERL
scripts. Once this information was parsed from the GenBank file, the corresponding cluster was drawn using the
postscript language (Adobe Systems, San José, California).
If, for instance, a cluster contained the genes paaA and

Page 3 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:36

paaB, then this cluster will appear on the paaA tree at the
phylogenetic position of the paaA gene and on the paaB
tree at the phylogenetic position of the paaB gene. Operons were identified using the MicrobesOnline database
http://www.microbesonline.org. Know operons were
crosschecked with the predictions to access quality of the
predictions in the database.

Results
In order to test whether a cluster has been independently
assembled more than once, we can examine the phylogenetic trees of both cluster and non-cluster homologs. If a
cluster has originated once and has never been subsequently perturbed, then for every gene in the cluster the
corresponding phylogenetic tree will include a clade containing all the species in which the cluster is present.
Given the prevalence of HGT [28] this clade does not have
to correspond to any recognized phylogenetic group. The
only relationships that are of importance are the relationships of the genes.
Variation in cluster and operon content and context
Table 1 shows a summary of all 1,311 homologs identified via the PSI-BLAST searches, in terms of the frequency
with which they were found in a paa gene cluster and if
found in a cluster, how often they were in an operon. Figure 2 contains a complete list of all observed unique operons in our dataset. These data together detail the
considerable variation across genes in terms of their tendency to be found in a cluster or operon.

In the cases of paaA, B, C and D the genes were always
found in an operon and obviously therefore, always in a
cluster. For paaE, in 19 out of 23 instances it was found
with other paa genes. paaI was always found in a cluster
(19 occasions) and the majority of times (16 out of 19),
in an operon. Similarly paaX and tetR were found relatively rarely (13 and 14 times respectively) and were usually found in clusters (11 out of 13 for paaX, 12 out of 14
for tetR) and 7 times each, they were in operons. paaG was
found 23 times, 17 times in a cluster and 16 out of those
17 times it was found in an operon. paaK is found 37
times and in slightly more than 50% of the instances (21
of 37), it is in a cluster and the majority of times that it is
in a cluster it is in an operon (19 of 21). The remaining
five genes paaF, paaH, paaJ, paaY and paaZ are more widely
distributed and the majority of times these homologs are
not found in clusters or operons. The gene that is least
likely to be found in an operon is paaY, which is only
found in an operon in 3 out of 84 instances. Interestingly,
apart from paaA, B, C, D and E where being in a cluster
automatically means being in an operon, most other
genes are found in an operon the majority of the times
they are found in a cluster. The exception is paaZ, where

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/36

for 14 out of 22 instances of the gene being in a cluster it
is not in an operon.
Figure 2 shows the set of unique operons involving two or
more paa genes found in all identified clusters. The most
striking aspect of this analysis is the sheer diversity in
terms of size, gene content and gene order among the
operons. A total of 33 different operons were identified,
ranging in size from 2 to 11 genes. Out of the 33 unique
operons only two display identical gene content, one
being paaXY, the other paaYX. This diversity is not surprising from a mathematical standpoint, given that 17 genes
were examined in the study. Even operons consisting of
only 2 genes there are 289 possible permutations. Aside
from the paaABCDE operon, which is clearly under strong
selection (all 25 clusters form operons), no particular
operon composition or configuration is dominant. This
result seems to indicate that operon formation (apart
from paaABCDE) is not dependent on the composition of
the genes that are present. Operons seem to form, simply
when members of the pathway are present and no single
operon composition or order is obligatory.
Analysis of gene clusters containing all 11 catabolic paa
genes
In order to establish how operons and clusters grow we
chose to focus on the largest clusters. We wished to analyse whether for large clusters there was selection to keep
co-adapted alleles together. We identified five clusters in
the dataset that were almost complete and were present in
genomes that were not thought to be each others' closest
relatives as judged using phylogenetic supertree methods
based on completed genomes [29]. These included the
clusters found in E. coli, P. putida, Rhodoccoccus sp., Nocardia farcinica and Corynebacterium efficiens. The evolutionary history of these clusters was examined in detail:
phylogenetic trees and additional data are available as
supplementary information http://bioinf.nuim.ie/supple
mentary/clusters/.

Figure 1 shows the operon structures observed in E. coli
and P. putida. In E. coli K12, all fourteen genes involved in
the pathway are clustered together and the cluster is broken into three operons [3]. paaABCDEFGHIJK are present
in one operon, paaXY in another and the paaZ gene is
transcribed by itself.
Superficially, the cluster in P. putida has high levels of similarity to the cluster in E. coli K12 with simple rearrangements of the order of blocks of genes accounting for the
majority of the observed differences, at first glance (see
figure 1). In P. putida the gene cluster is arranged in five
operons [3] with paaABCDE being in one operon and
paaFGHIJK being in a second, where both are merged in E.

coli. paaLM and an unrelated gene are in another operon,
paaYX is in an operon (the order is reversed in E. coli) and
paaZ is transcribed by itself in the cluster. The gene content difference between the two clusters is the presence of
paaL, a phenylacetic acid transporter, and paaM, a phenylacetic acid specific porin, along with an additional gene
not known to be involved in phenylacetate degradation.
paaL and paaM are only present in P. putida and in none
of the other 102 genomes studied.
The phylogenetic analyses of the genes in these two clusters reveals a much greater degree of difference. We exam-

ined the phylogenetic trees for all genes in these clusters,
expecting that the individual genes would be each other's
closest relatives or at least reasonably closely related. We
found that indeed for the paaA, C, D, F, G, I, J, K and X
genes the E. coli and the P. putida copies grouped closely
on a phylogenetic tree. Contrastingly, for paaB, E, H, Y
and Z we see support for the separation of the two E. coli
sequences from the P. putida sequences on their respective
phylogenetic trees. This result indicates that orthologous
gene displacement has replaced a considerable number of
genes in these clusters since the clusters separated from
their common ancestor. Given the compositional similarPage 5 of 11

ity the most parsimonious explanation is that a complete
cluster existed in the past and the two that we see in E. coli
and P. putida today are descended with great modification, probably by rearrangement, insertion and orthologous displacement from the ancestral cluster. Of
particular interest is the paaABCDE operon which is relatively invariable (see previous results), but from this analysis it is still subject to gene turnover and replacement. We
note that these are the two most complete and similar
clusters in our dataset. If we extrapolate from this result
and go further back through evolutionary history assuming a similar rate of gene replacement, then it is likely that
replacement of every single gene in this cluster – one at a
time – can occur relatively rapidly.
The Rhodococcus sp./Nocardia farcinica/
Corynebacterium efficiens clusters
Rhodococcus sp. and Nocardia farcinica have two clusters
that are very similar both in terms of gene content and orientation of genes within the cluster. In all phylogenetic
analyses of the paa genes in the clusters, we find strong
support for a sister group relationship between these two
taxa. This suggests a recent common ancestor of both clusters. The N. farcinica cluster is split into four operons, the
first is paaI by itself, the second contains a non-paa gene
and paaZ, the third is tetR by itself and the fourth contains
paa J, F, H, G, A, B, C, D, E and K. The Rh. sp. cluster is
split into two operons, the difference being that paaI is in
an operon with a non-paa gene and paaZ. This is followed
by an operon consisting of paaJ, F, H, G, A, B, C, D, E, and
K. These clusters are very different in terms of gene order
when compared with either E. coli or P. putida.

The Corynebacterium efficiens cluster has some similarities
to the Rh. sp./N. farcinica cluster. Firstly the gene content
is almost identical, the only difference being that there are

two copies of paaF in the C. efficiens cluster while paaG is
absent. Secondly, all three clusters contain a gene of
unknown function, and these three genes are homologs of
one another. Thirdly, the C. efficiens cluster contains a
copy of the tetR transcriptional regulator, as does the N.
farcinica cluster. Lastly, there are subtle patterns of similarity in gene order with paaZ, J, G, F and H all in close proximity to one another in the three clusters, as were paaA, B,
C, D, E and K.
When we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships
between the genes on the C. efficiens and the Rh. sp./N. farcinica clusters we found that a sister group relationship
was recovered for the paaF, H, I, J, and K genes with strong
bootstrap support for this arrangement. However, for the
paaA, B, C, D, E and Z genes there is strong support for
grouping Rh. sp./N. farcinica with Streptomyces coelicolor,
although in some cases the C. efficiens homolog is nearby
on the tree. S. coelicolor has a paa cluster consisting of
paaK, I, A, B, C, D and E. The results suggest that the paaABCDE operon in Rh. sp./N. farcinica/S. coelicolor are each
others closest relatives for all the genes in the operon,
while for the paaK and paaI C. efficiens groups while Rh. sp.
and N. farcinica, to the exclusion of S. coelicolor.
An analysis of all five near-complete clusters does not support a single origin of these clusters and there are no genes
that place E. coli or P. putida as sister-taxa to genes from the
C. efficiens or Rh. sp./N. farcinica genes. This indicates that
formation of these near-complete clusters occurred independently on at least these two occasions, one assembly
occurring in the proteobacteria and the other in the actinobacteria.
A comparative analysis of the evolutionary histories of the
paaK and the paaC genes can be seen in figures 3 and 4.

The paaC gene is always found in an operon with paaA, B
and D. Also, there is only one instance where this operon
is not found in a cluster with other genes from the phenylacetate degradation pathway (i.e. in the case of Symbiobacterium thermophilum). The paaK gene is found in a
cluster of more than two phenylactetate degradation
genes approximately half of the times it is observed, the
rest of the time, it is found as a single gene in the genome.
There are four clans [30](the tree is only rooted for convenience, but is really unrooted) in which the paaK gene
is at the edge of a cluster. Overall, it can be seen that the
clusters for both genes dynamically grow, shrink and are
rearranged (additional phylogenetic trees for every gene
are supplied in the supplementary information and the
reader should consult these trees).
To illustrate the variability in cluster context it is possible
to take some examples from figure 3. The numbers that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/36

follow the taxon names are indicative of the physical location of the gene in the genome. In the paaC tree (figure 3),
the two instances of this gene in Azoarcus sp. EbN1 are
genes number 2001 and 3248. These genes are spaced
approximately 1250 genes apart on the A. sp. EbN1
genome, both genes are in a paa cluster and they are not
particularly closely-related genes as evidenced by their
phylogenetic positions. A reasonable speculation is that
one or both of these genes was introduced into the
genome via horizontal gene transfer. In contrast the two
instances of paaK (figure 4) found in A. sp. EbN (labelled
A. sp. EbN1 3252 and A. sp. EbN1 1998 on the paaK tree)
are indeed each others closest relatives, indicating a relatively recent gene duplication event. The Thermus thermophilus and Deinococcus radiodurans genes on both trees
are nearest neighbors, suggesting a relatively recent common ancestor. This relative recentness of common ancestry might lead us to expect that the cluster context of these

The same layout as figure 3, but the information represented is based upon the paaK gene.

two genes might be similar, however, the D. radiodurans
paaK gene is not in a cluster, whereas the D. radiodurans
paaC gene is in a cluster.
On the paaC tree, there are three Bordetella clusters that are
almost identical in terms of gene content and order. However, in one of the three genomes (that of B. pertussis
Tohama I) there are two genes in the middle of the cluster
that are not found in the other two strains. These two
genes seem to have displaced the paaE gene in B. pertussis
Tohama I, which lacks a copy of paaE. The other two Bordetella strains have copies of paaE in their clusters. The
most parsimonious reconstruction, based on the paaC tree
is that these two genes have been inserted into the cluster
in B. pertussis Tohama I (see supplementary information
for more gene trees).
These observations demonstrate the enormous variability
and rapid rate of assembly and disassembly of clusters as
well as the semi-independent assembly of two near-complete clusters.

Discussion
In this work, we have analysed the evolutionary history of
the genes involved in the phenylacetate degradation pathway, with a view to understanding the origin and spread
of functionally-related gene clusters and operons.
The most surprising result from this study is the diversity
we see in terms of both cluster and operon structure. We
observe that the clustering of phenylacetate degradation
genes has occurred repeatedly in several different lineages,
the clusters themselves are mosaics and are generally composed of genes that have been acquired from other species, either recently or relatively recently. Often, strains of
the same species have very different cluster structures and
indeed in the case of E. coli and P. putida, even though the
clusters look similar, many of the genes cannot trace their
most recent common ancestor to the same point. In other
words, orthologous gene displacement is quite common,
as is illegitimate recombination. This has been reported
previously [13] and it indicates that the selective pressure
to form clusters is not so strong that clusters, once formed,

become immutable or that clusters continue to become
larger.
In general, operon destruction as well as operon formation are seen to occur in our dataset and we observe a total
of 33 unique operon structures. This suggests that either
the selective advantage that accrues as a result of operon
formation is not very strong and recombination followed
by random genetic drift can successfully break up operons
(a neutralist explanation) or that if indeed a selection
pressure exists that drives operon formation, there exists
another opposing selection pressure to split operons. It is
also possible that a selective advantage could exist to create an operon, but subsequently this advantage is no
longer present as the environment changes. Irrespective of
the explanation, it seems that for this particular pathway,
the formation of large operons containing most or all of
the genes is not necessarily hugely important, or perhaps
it is not possible. The exception to the rule is seen in the
paaABCD operon, which is strongly conserved. The obvious explanation is that these four protein products physically interact and their existence in equimolar
concentrations is necessary. Therefore, there is a gradient
of selective pressure for co-regulation which is strongest
for interacting proteins in our small dataset, less strong for
proteins that do not physically interact and indeed co-regulation might be a selective disadvantage in some cases
(in 14 out of 22 cases paaZ is in a cluster but not in an
operon) and may lead to the successful destruction of an
operon.
The study also sheds some light on the various models of
cluster and operon formation. We expect from the Natal
Model of operon growth that all genes in the operon are
evolutionarily related. This theory is clearly insufficient to
account for the observations in this analysis.
The Selfish Operon Model (SOM) posits that operons
exist so that they can be easily transferred via horizontal
gene transfer. Our analysis shows that there is a evidence
of gene replacement within a cluster and within an
operon and this presents a difficulty with the hypothesis
that operons exist in order to facilitate their transfer as a
group. Additionally, the sheer diversity of operons present
in the analysis is at odds with the SOM. We see 33 unique
operon structures. Even the clusters of E. coli K12/W and
P. putida, which are clearly homologous, differ in gene
content, order, operon structure and show evidence of
orthologous replacement via HGT. While it is not in
doubt that there is an advantage to passing a set of genes
horizontally, our results show little evidence of selfish
operon style transfers. The only stable operon structure is
that of paaADCDE and this is an example of an operon
that cannot exist outside of a selfish operon framework,
since the gene products form a complex with one another.

In addition, Pál and Hurst [17] have already shown that
essential genes are more likely to be in an operon than
non-essential genes and this is also incompatible with the
SOM.
The Fisher Model states that cluster formation is a way of
keeping co-adapted alleles together. It is clear from our
analysis that the turnover rate of alleles is high and alleles
do not seem to spend much time being inherited together
and so this model is not compatible with our observations.
The Co-regulation Model, while recently receiving some
support from an analysis of operons only [16] is also
insufficient to cover our observations. We see genes
present in a cluster, but not in an operon 38 times. We see
genes in operons 225 times, however, 119 of those times
the operon is the paaABCDE operon, which contains
genes that form a single heteromeric complex. The Co-regulation Model only governs operon maintenance and is
strongly in operation for the maintenance of paaABCDE
but is still insufficient to explain all our data.
The Protein Immobility Model (PIM) fits with the idea
that there is a small selective advantage for clustering
genes together. The reason for this small selective advantage is the effect macromolecular crowding has on the
movement of proteins in the cell. Macromolecular crowding tends to increase the speed of biochemical reactions
[31], whilst simultaneously limiting the ability of large
proteins to move around the cell. While the cellular
matrix is a dynamic environment, the movement of a protein through the cytoplasm of a prokaryote is slower than
through water [19] and when several proteins are
involved, this is likely to result in sufficient restriction of
movement that a selective advantage accrues for an organism that synthesizes functionally related proteins in close
proximity to one another. However, the PIM only covers
the formation of clusters and does not cover operon formation and maintenance. We would see operon formation and maintenance to be a not-inevitable consequence
of cluster formation, perhaps simplifying transcription.
A number of studies have indicated that transcriptional
control of independent transcription units (single genes
and operons) is likely to have influenced genomic structure [32]. This is reflected in the co-localisation of genes
that are controlled by the same transcription factor. Additionally, the distribution and orientation of transcription
units is not random [33] and is associated with an optimization process. In this study, we have shown that while
these genome optimization processes are under way, the
process of horizontal gene transfer and within-cluster
gene content perturbation is continuous and at times
fairly radical.

We note that no one model of operon assembly completely covers our observations. Perhaps a more robust
model would be one that deals with cluster and operon
formation as different levels of organisation. We know
that operon formation occurs subsequent or at the same
time as cluster formation, however, our data clearly show
that operon formation is not absolutely necessary. The
majority of genes in clusters do become involved in operons, but this is likely to be a secondary advantage ensuring
that they are transcribed at the same time. We feel that a
comprehensive model requires a component that provides a selective advantage for moving genes closer
together in a genome and a separate component providing selective advantage for operon formation. In terms of
the current models, the best fit would be a combination of
the PIM and the Co-regulation Model.
Perhaps more important, however, is evolutionary history
of the genes of the phenylacetate degradation pathway.
The massive diversity of the clusters and operons
observed, coupled with complete lack of correlation to
phylogeny, provides an interesting insight into just how
dynamic is the process rearranging the position of genes
in a genome. While this is only a single pathway, the evidence still strongly implies the existence of a complicated
underlying system in prokaryotes based upon a recombination selection balance. Even if phenylacetate degradation is unusual when compared to clusters associated with
amino acid biosynthesis or other core pathways, it may
provide a much deeper understanding of the principles of
cluster and operon formation than static, widely distributed gene clusters ever could.

Conclusion
We conclude that the Selfish Operon Model is insufficient
to account for the assembly of clusters and operons and
that any relevant model for cluster and operon assembly
needs to include a credible component that provides a
selective advantage for genes moving closer together. The
best fitting model would combine the PIM and the Coregulation Models.
