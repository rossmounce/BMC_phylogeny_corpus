Selenocysteine utilization in bacteria

Background: Selenocysteine (Sec) is co-translationally inserted into protein in response to UGA
codons. It occurs in oxidoreductase active sites and often is catalytically superior to cysteine (Cys).
However, Sec is used very selectively in proteins and organisms. The wide distribution of Sec and
its restricted use have not been explained.

interactions

Conclusion: Our data reveal a dynamic balance between selenoprotein origin and loss, and may
account for the discrepancy between catalytic advantages provided by Sec and the observed low
number of selenoprotein families and Sec-utilizing organisms.

refereed research

Results: We conducted comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses to examine dynamics of
Sec decoding in bacteria at both selenium utilization trait and selenoproteome levels. These
searches revealed that 21.5% of sequenced bacteria utilize Sec, their selenoproteomes have 1 to
31 selenoproteins, and selenoprotein-rich organisms are mostly Deltaproteobacteria or Firmicutes/
Clostridia. Evolutionary histories of selenoproteins suggest that Cys-to-Sec replacement is a general
trend for most selenoproteins. In contrast, only a small number of Sec-to-Cys replacements were
detected, and these were mostly restricted to formate dehydrogenase and selenophosphate
synthetase families. In addition, specific selenoprotein gene losses were observed in many sister
genomes. Thus, the Sec/Cys replacements were mostly unidirectional, and increased utilization of
Sec by existing protein families was counterbalanced by loss of selenoprotein genes or entire
selenoproteomes. Lateral transfers of the Sec trait were an additional factor, and we describe the
first example of selenoprotein gene transfer between archaea and bacteria. Finally, oxygen
requirement and optimal growth temperature were identified as environmental factors that
correlate with changes in Sec utilization.

Background

Selenium, an essential trace element for many organisms in
the three domains of life, is present in proteins in the form of
selenocysteine (Sec) residue [1-4]. Sec, known as the 21st naturally occurring amino acid, is co-translationally inserted
into proteins by recoding opal (UGA) codons. These UGA
codons are recognized by a complex molecular machinery,
known as selenosome, which is superimposed on the translation machinery of the cell. Although the Sec insertion machinery differs in the three domains of life, its origin appears to
precede the domain split [1,2,5-8].
The mechanism of Sec insertion in response to UGA in bacteria has been most thoroughly elucidated in Escherichia coli
[1,2,9-11]. Briefly, selenoprotein mRNA carries a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, immediately
downstream of Sec-encoding UGA codon [2,3,12]. The SECIS
element binds the Sec-specific elongation factor (SelB, the
selB gene product) and forms a complex with tRNASec (the
selC gene product), whose anticodon matches the UGA
codon. tRNASec is initially acylated with serine by a canonical
seryl-tRNA synthetase and is then converted to Sec-tRNASec
by Sec synthase (SelA, the selA gene product). SelA utilizes
selenophosphate as the selenium donor, which in turn is synthesized by selenophosphate synthetase (SelD, the selD gene
product).
In addition, in some organisms selenophosphate is also a
selenium donor for biosynthesis of a modified tRNA nucleoside,
namely
5-methylaminomethyl-2-selenouridine
(mnm5Se2U), which is present at the wobble position of tRNALys, tRNAGlu, and tRNAGln anticodons [13]. The proposed
function of mnm5Se2U in these tRNAs involves codon-anticodon interactions that help base pair discrimination at the
wobble position and/or translation efficiency [14]. A 2-selenouridine synthase (YbbB, the ybbB gene product) is necessary to replace a sulfur atom in 2-thiouridine in these tRNAs
with selenium [15]. In addition, selenium is utilized in the
form of co-factor in certain molybdenum-containing enzymes
[16,17].

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R94

Recent phylogenetic analyses of components of both Secdecoding and selenouridine traits in completely sequenced
bacterial genomes have provided evidence for a highly mosaic
pattern of species that incorporate Sec, which can be
explained as the result of speciation, differential gene loss and
horizontal gene transfer (HGT), indicating that neither the
loss nor the acquisition of the trait is irreversible [13]. However, it is still unclear why this amino acid is only utilized by a
subset of organisms. Even more puzzling is the fact that many
organisms that are able to decode Sec use this amino acid only
in a small set of proteins or even in a single protein. It would
be interesting to determine whether there are environmental
factors that specifically affect selenoprotein evolution.
The aim of this work was to address these questions by analyzing evolution of selenium utilization traits (Sec decoding
and selenouridine utilization) and selenoproteomes in bacteria. We have performed phylogenetic analyses of key components of these traits (SelA, SelB, SelD, and YbbB) and
analyzed 25 selenoprotein families in bacterial genomes for
which complete or nearly complete sequence information is
available. The data suggest that in most selenoprotein families, especially those containing rare selenoproteins and
widespread Cys-containing homologs, selenoproteins have
evolved from a Cys-containing ancestor. In addition, the
majority of selenoprotein-rich organisms are anaerobic
hyperthermophiles that belong to a small number of phyla.
Selenoprotein losses could be detected in a number of sister
genomes of selenoprotein-rich organisms. These observations revealed a dynamic and delicate balance between Sec
acquisition and selenoprotein loss, and may partially explain
the discrepancy between catalytic advantages offered by Sec
and its limited use in nature. This balance is seen at three levels: loss and acquisition of the Sec-decoding trait itself, with
the former as a predominant route; emergence/loss of selenoprotein families; and Cys-to-Sec or Sec-to-Cys replacements
in different selenoprotein families.

Results
Distribution of selenium utilization traits in bacteria

The Sec-decoding trait is the main biologic system of selenium utilization, as evidenced by its distribution in living
organisms. Sec is present in the active sites of functionally
diverse selenoproteins, most of which exhibit redox function.
It has been reported that Sec can greatly increase the catalytic
efficiency of selenoenzymes as compared with their cysteine
(Cys)-containing homologs [18]. Despite this selective advantage and its dedicated biosynthesis and decoding machinery,
Sec is a rare amino acid. The selenoproteome of a given Secincorporating organism is represented by a small number of
protein families. Twenty-six eukaryotic and 27 prokaryotic
selenoprotein families (including 25 bacterial selenoprotein
families) have previously been reported [19-21], and additional selenoproteins could probably be identified by computational analyses of large sequence datasets [22].

Sequence analysis of bacterial genomes revealed wide distribution of genes encoding key components of Sec-decoding
(SelA/SelB/SelC/SelD) and selenouridine-utilizing (SelD/
YbbB) machinery. We identified 75 Sec-decoding (21.5% of all
sequenced genomes) and 88 selenouridine-utilizing (25.2%
of all sequenced genomes) organisms. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the two selenium utilization traits in different
bacterial taxa based on a highly resolved phylogenetic tree of
life [23]. It has been proposed that SelB is the signature of the
Sec-decoding and YbbB of the selenouridine traits [13]. SelD
is required for both pathways and this protein defines the
overall selenium utilization trait. Figure 1 shows that, except
for the phyla containing only one or two sequenced genomes
(for example, Deinococcales, Fibrobacteres, and Planctomycetes), SelD is present in nearly all bacterial phyla with the

Several SelA homologs were also found in organisms that
lacked the Sec-decoding trait. In addition, a recent structural
and functional investigation into an archaeal SelA homolog
revealed that it lacks SelA activity [27]. These findings indicate that SelA might have acquired a new function in these
organisms.

A unique exception was the detection of an orphan SelD without any other known components of selenium utilization
traits or genes encoding selenoproteins in the complete
genome of Enterococcus faecalis, which is the only SelD-containing member of the Firmicutes/Lactobacillales subdivision. A similar situation was also observed in the archaeal
plasmid, Haloarcula marismortui plasmid pNG700. The
presence of selD in organisms that lacked known selenium
utilization traits suggested that there might be a third trait
dependent on SelD. In addition to Sec-containing proteins
and selenouridine-containing tRNAs, selenium occurs in several bacterial molybdenum-containing oxidoreductases in the
form of an undefined co-factor [17,24-26]. However, no genes
have been linked either to biosynthesis of this selenium species or to insertion of the selenium co-factor into proteins.

exception of Chlamydiae, Chlorobi, and Firmicutes/Mollicutes. This observation suggests that selenium may be used
by most bacterial lineages and that selenium utilization is an
ancient trait that once was common to all or almost all species
in this domain of life. Among SelD-containing species, the
majority of Sec-decoding organisms (having SelA and SelB)
belong to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, especially Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria,
Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes/Clostridia subdivisions, in which the Sec-decoding trait was found in at least 10
genomes or 50% of all sequenced genomes. In contrast, the
Sec-decoding trait was not detected among Bacteroidetes and
Cyanobacteria. It is possible that selenoprotein-containing
organisms in these phyla have not yet been sequenced, or that
the trait was lost at the base of these phyla. The selenouridineutilizing trait was found to be absent in all sequenced organisms of Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, Chloroflexi, Aquificae
and Acidobacteria, some of which have selenoproteins, and
present in Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria, some of which
lack selenoproteins; this indicates a relatively independent
relationship between the two selenium utilization traits. Nevertheless, significant overlap between the presence of Sec and
selenouridine traits observed in the present study suggests
that one selenium utilization trait may facilitate acquisition/

Phylogenetic analysis of selenium utilization traits
Seventy-five SelA (excluding nine homologs in organisms
lacking selenoproteins), 75 SelB, 127 SelD, and 88 YbbB
sequences from different bacterial species were used to build
protein-specific phylogenetic trees. Most branches were consistent with the evolutionary relationships between bacterial
species. However, some HGT events could also be observed in
these trees ( Additional data file 2 [Figure S1]).
In addition to the previously reported HGT of the entire Secdecoding trait and selenoproteins observed in Photobacterium profundum (Gammaproteobacteria) and Treponema
denticola (Spirochaetes) [13], the topologies of SelA and SelB
phylogenetic trees reveal that the Pseudomonadale
sequences are within the Alphaproteobacteria-Betaproteobacteria node, and not - as expected for vertical descent within the Gammaproteobacteria node(Figure 2). This suggests that there is another HGT event. In addition, the topology of formate dehydrogenase α subunit (FdhA) tree, which is
the only selenoprotein in Pseudomonadales, is consistent
with an HGT event (Figure 2). We further analyzed the
genomic organization of the Sec-decoding trait and fdhA
genes in these genomes. The selA, selB, and selC genes were
organized in operons and the fdhA gene was very close to or
even flanked the selA-selB-selC operon. Our data strongly

SelA

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R94

suggest that both the Sec-decoding trait (selA, selB, and selC)
and fdhA of Pseudomonadales were acquired by HGT. Evolution of selD might be independent from other components
involved in Sec decoding; selenophosphate is required for two
different selenium utilization traits that exhibit overlapping
but distinct phylogenetic distribution. Indeed, phylogenetic
analyses indicate that Pseudomonadales acquired the selenouridine trait by vertical descent; furthermore, as in many
other species containing both traits, selD and ybbB are
arranged in an operon. These observations suggest that in the
presence of selD (utilized by selenouridine), Sec-decoding
could have been acquired by HGT of selA, selB and selC, as
well as the first selenoprotein gene. This step-wise evolution
to selenium utilization is a parsimonious and plausible route
for acquisition of an additional selenium-dependent trait
from an already existing one, and could have helped to spread
both traits vertically or laterally during evolution. The selenouridine biosynthesis trait was also analyzed as described
for the Sec trait. Frequent HGT events were observed, but cotransfer of both traits was not detected.

Analysis of distribution of selenoprotein families in different
bacterial phyla showed the high diversity of bacterial selenoproteomes. Most bacterial phyla/branches contained only
one to three selenoprotein families (Table 2). However, three
separate selenoprotein family-rich phyla were identified: Deltaproteobacteria (22 families), Firmicutes/Clostridia (16
families), and Actinobacteria (12 families). A total of 198
selenoproteins belonging to all 25 families were identified in
these three phyla, which accounted for 69.5% of all detected
selenoprotein sequences, suggesting high Sec usage in the
three phyla. Moreover, 18 selenoprotein-rich organisms

Sec-containing HdrA, FrhD, and FrhA are always present
with coenzyme F420-reducing hydrogenase γ subunit (FrhG,
not a selenoprotein), in an operon hdrA-frhD-frhG-frhA.
Surprisingly, these four genes were also found to be clustered
in some Deltaproteobacteria, especially Syntrophobacter
fumaroxidans, which contained three similar five-gene operons. These operons also had an additional selenoprotein family, namely Fe-S oxidoreductase (GlpC), which is absent in
Sec-decoding archaea (Figure 3a). Although additional Secand Cys-containing homologs were also present, phylogenetic
analysis of HdrA, FrhD, FrhG, and FrhA sequences in these
operons showed that sequences from all Sec-decoding
archaea and Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans clustered in one
sub-branch in each evolutionary tree (Figure 3b). Another
member of Deltaproteobacteria, namely Desulfotalea psychrophila, which contains the same five-gene operon as that
in Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, was also represented in
these sub-branches. The remaining archaeal and bacterial
sequences corresponded to more distant subfamilies. This
topology is consistent with the idea that the whole hdrAfrhD-frhG-frhA operon was transferred between archaea and
Deltaproteobacteria. Moreover, Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans is an obligate anaerobe, which degraded propionate in
syntrophic association with methanogens [29]. In contrast to
archaea, all hdrA genes in the bacterial operon were clustered
with themselves with or without insertion of an additional
gene of unknown function in between (hdrA-hdrA gene and
hdrA_N-unknown-hdrA_C gene, respectively). These data
revealed a complex and highly dynamic evolutionary process
of selenoproteins in Deltaproteobacteria.

Origin and loss of selenoproteins via Sec/Cys
conversions
Distribution of Sec-/Cys-containing sequences in organisms
containing and lacking the Sec-decoding trait is shown in
Additional data files 1 (Table S1) and 2 (Figure S2). In most
selenoprotein families, the number of Sec-containing
sequences was much smaller than that of Cys-containing
homologs. The occurrence of Sec- and Cys-containing
homologs suggested a close evolutionary relationship
between these proteins. However, it is not known whether Sec
evolves from Cys residues or Cys from Sec. In addition, if both
conversion types are possible, then it which is the predominant one is also unknown.
To address these questions, we analyzed evolutionary relationships between Sec-containing and Cys-containing forms
in each selenoprotein family, except glycine reductase selenoprotein A (GrdA), which had no known Cys-containing
homologs. Not all selenoproteins were informative in this
analysis, because in the majority of phylogenetic trees the
evolutionary origin of sequences could not be reliably
assessed. However, this analysis revealed 33 events in 17
selenoprotein families that corresponded to Cys-to-Sec conversions (Cys→Sec). Most of these events were detected in
various selenoprotein families containing few selenoprotein

had a common feature; they were homologs of thiol-based
redox proteins, which contained UxxC, CxxU or TxxU redox
motifs. In contrast, only 15 events were detected that corresponded to Sec-to-Cys conversions (Sec→Cys). Moreover,
these events occurred only in four families (see the two middle columns in Table 1). Among Cys-containing homologs
that probably evolved from selenoproteins, 11 occurred in

selenoprotein-containing organisms (these organisms lost a
particular selenoprotein but not the ability to decode Sec) and
some contained remnant bacterial SECIS-like structures
downstream of the Cys codons, providing further evidence in
support of their selenoprotein ancestors (see examples in Figure 4).
The majority of the detected Sec→Cys conversions (66.7%)
were associated with the FdhA and SelD families (46.7% for
FdhA and 20% for SelD). In contrast, no Cys→Sec events
were observed in these two families, which are by far the two
most abundant selenoprotein families in the bacterial
domain. An attractive hypothesis is that the Sec-decoding
trait largely co-evolved with the Sec-containing FdhA. In
most families containing rare selenoproteins and widespread
Cys-containing homologs, the selenoproteins evolved from

Cys-containing ancestors; however, these events could only
occur in organisms that already possessed the Sec-decoding
trait and FdhA. In the absence of FdhA, SelD could be
involved in maintaining the Sec-decoding trait (perhaps to
sustain efficient selenouridine formation), as suggested by
the facts that all Sec-decoding organisms that lack FdhA have
Sec-containing SelD and that most of them possess the selenouridine trait.

Sec is normally a much more reactive residue than Cys [3032]. Because it provides catalytic advantage over Cys in certain redox enzymes, Sec may be expected to have a widespread occurrence. In addition, the higher rate of Cys→Sec
conversions compared with that of Sec→Cys events would

We analyzed the evolutionary trends in different selenoprotein families by assessing the occurrence of orthologous
selenoproteins in sister and relatively distant organisms
selected from the same phylum (see Materials and methods,
below). If only one of two (or more) sister genomes and at
least two distant genomes carried orthologous Sec/Cys-containing sequences, then a selenoprotein gene loss event in the
sister genomes could be inferred. The last column in Table 1

result in increased utilization of Sec during evolution. However, the number of selenoprotein families identified to date
is small, and no clear explanation is available for this discrepancy.

In the present study we scrutinized, using various methods,
homologous Sec- and Cys-containing sequences evolved in
bacterial genomes, which provided important new insights
into the dynamic evolution of selenium utilization in bacteria.
The widespread taxa distribution of selenium utilization
traits agreed with the idea that selenium could be used by various species in almost all bacterial phyla. However, among all
sequenced bacterial genomes, only 21.5% possess the Secdecoding trait and 25.2% the selenouridine-utilizing trait,
suggesting that most organisms lost the ability to utilize Sec
or selenouridine. It should be noted that many Sec-decoding
organisms also possessed the selenouridine-utilizing trait
and vice versa, suggesting that the two traits might have
evolved under similar environmental conditions (for example, selenium supply) or could influence evolution of each
other. However, the occurrence of many organisms containing only one of these traits indicates that selenium availability
is not the sole factor responsible for acquisition or loss of
either trait, and suggests a relatively independent and complementary relationship between the two selenium utilization
traits. The presence of SelD as a single selenoprotein in several YbbB-containing species reinforces the idea that the
traits might have a complementary relationship (specifically,
the Sec-decoding trait might be maintained for SelD, which in
turn supports both itself and selenouridine synthesis). In
addition, the presence of an 'orphan selD' (one that is not

Although much effort has previously been devoted to identifying selenoprotein genes and Sec insertion machinery, evolution of selenium utilization traits remained unclear. Some
primary considerations concerning the phylogeny of Sec
incorporation and the evolution of Sec have previously been
proposed [33]. The major usage of selenium in nature
appears to be in co-translational incorporation of Sec into
selenoproteins. In addition, 2-selenouridine, a modified
tRNA nucleotide in the wobble position of anticodons of some
tRNAs, has been identified as a second selenium utilization
trait [13]. A common feature between the two selenium utilization traits is that both use selenophosphate as the selenium
donor. Therefore, SelD is considered to be a general signature
for selenium utilization.

shows putative evolutionary scenarios for each selenoprotein
family. Although many selenoproteins were not informative
in identifying the events associated with selenoprotein loss
(there were 201 widespread selenoproteins and 46 selenoproteins in which selenoprotein loss and origin events could not
be distinguished), we could identify 38 events of selenoprotein loss in 12 selenoprotein families (Table 4). Among them,
26 occurred in different subgroups of Firmicutes/Clostridia,
eight in Deltaproteobacteria, and four in Actinobacteria,
which are the three selenoprotein-rich phyla (Additional data

observed in other phyla.

associated with either trait) in both bacteria and archaea
raised the possibility of a third, currently unknown selenium
utilization trait.
We built the phylogenetic trees for both the components of
selenium utilization traits and selenoproteins by several independent methods. The topologies of these inferred trees were
supported by most individual trees. In addition, phylogenies
of SECIS elements in different bacterial selenoprotein genes
were also consistent with those of selenoproteins (data not
shown), suggesting that both SECIS elements and selenoproteins have similar evolutionary trends.
To establish the correspondence between the inferred phylogenies for the components of the two selenium utilization traits
and the general evolutionary trend, we measured, for each
pair of organisms, the correlation between the similarity of
orthologous pairs and that of the 16S rRNAs (as controls). The
correlation coefficient was 0.68-0.79 (Figure 5). After removing the HGT cases, all correlation coefficients were even
higher (≥ 0.9). The data suggest that the inferred phylogenetic
trees are consistent with the evolutionary distance derived
from 16S rRNAs, and that selenium utilization systems in
most bacterial species were inherited from a common ancestor in the same phylogenetic lineage.
HGT events have contributed to the evolution of Sec-decoding or selenouridine-utilizing traits. However, detection of
HGT of the entire trait is difficult, especially for the Sec-

decoding trait, because these events are rare. In our study,
besides the HGT event previously reported for the Sec-decoding trait [13], we found that all Sec-decoding organisms in
Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria/Pseudomonadales possess similar selA-selBselC operons and a neighboring fdhA gene, which encodes the
only selenoprotein in these organisms (Figure 2). Our data
provide support for the idea that a Sec-decoding HGT event
can occur only if selA, selB, and selC genes are organized in a
cluster and the transfer event is accompanied by co-transfer
of at least one selenoprotein gene (most often fdhA, or selD if
fdhA is absent). In addition, because SelD and YbbB are the
only known components of the selenouridine-utilizing trait
and their genes almost always form an operon, additional cotransfer events could be observed (although we did not detect
examples of the HGT of both traits). In some phyla both
selenoprotein-containing organisms and sister organisms
lacking selenoproteins possess selD and ybbB; this fact suggests that evolution of SelD is relatively independent from
other components of the Sec-decoding trait.
That either FdhA or SelD were present in every selenoproteome supports the idea that one or both of these two selenoprotein families are largely responsible for maintaining the
Sec-decoding trait. Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes/
Clostridia, and Actinobacteria were three selenoprotein family rich phyla, which had all 25 selenoprotein families and
represented 17 out of 18 (94.4%) selenoprotein-rich organisms. The families containing rare selenoproteins (with

number of selenoproteins below five) were only present in
Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes/Clostridia, suggesting
an active evolution of new selenoproteins in these two separate phyla. Considering the bias of distribution of sequenced
bacterial genomes, additional selenoprotein-rich phyla or
organisms might be identified in future.

decoding trait in most cases parallels the evolution of FdhA.
Consistent with this idea, the genes for the Sec-decoding trait
and FdhA are often in the same operon in Sec-decoding
organisms, particularly those containing a single selenoprotein gene. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that acquisition of Sec-containing FdhA occurs via vertical or lateral
inheritance of the Sec-decoding trait. SelD might be a second
selenoprotein that helps to maintain the trait in organisms
that lack FdhA. The requirement for FdhA or SelD to maintain the Sec-decoding trait and the scattered occurrence of
other selenoproteins further illustrate a highly dynamic
nature of Sec evolution.

interactions

To gain insight into the factors that influence maintenance/
acquisition/loss of selenium utilization traits and Sec/Cys
conversions, we analyzed environmental conditions (for
example, habitat, oxygen requirement, optimal temperature,
and optimal pH) and other factors (such as genome size and
GC content) for all 349 bacteria for which completely or
almost completely sequenced genomes are available, and
compared those containing the Sec and/or selenouridine
traits with those that do not. First, we found that the organisms possessing the Sec-decoding trait (especially those that
have Sec but not selenouridine traits) favor anaerobic and

refereed research

Because new selenoproteins frequently evolve from their Cyscontaining homologs, why do organisms have only a limited
number of selenoproteins and why do so many organisms
lack selenoproteins altogether? One hypothesis is that the Sec
insertion trait is not stable, and evolution of new selenoproteins is balanced by selenoprotein loss in closely related
organisms. To investigate the possibility of phylum-specific
selenoprotein losses, we adopted an approach that relies on
similarity between sister and relatively distant organisms.
Similar methods have previously been used to analyze a general trend toward amino acid gain and loss in proteins [35].
Because the sister species selected for each selenoproteincontaining organism are closely related, the observed results
directly reflect only about the past 30 million years of evolution. We found that all 38 selenoprotein loss events, including
the six SelD losses that were accompanied by the loss of the
entire Sec-decoding trait in sister genomes, occurred in the
selenoprotein family-rich phyla Firmicutes/Clostridia and
Deltaproteobacteria. Organisms in these phyla reflect a balanced pattern of ongoing selenoprotein origin and loss. The
most plausible hypothesis to explain the loss of selenoproteins might relate to a universal, intrinsic, and long-term
trend that emerged in both ancient and extant organisms.
During this period, some ancient selenoprotein families
might have been lost in most or all organisms, or some
ancient organisms might have disappeared that contained
ancient selenoproteins. Our hypothesis is consistent with the
recently proposed 'balance hypothesis', which suggests that
gene gain and loss in prokaryotes are balanced to keep
prokaryotic genome size relatively constant [36]. However,
the evolutionary forces modulating the balance are unclear.

deposited research

The analysis of selenoproteins and the complementary sets of
Cys-containing homologs offered us a model system in which
to analyze the origin and evolution of various selenoproteins.
Although the majority of selenoprotein families have rare
selenoproteins and widespread Cys-containing homologs
(Additional data files 1 [Table S1] and 2 [Figure S2]), we
found that several selenoproteins, including FdhA, SelW-like,
and glycine reductase selenoproteins A (GrdA) and B (GrdB),
have very few or even lack Cys-containing homologs in Seccontaining organisms (Additional data file 2 [Figure S3]).
This observation suggests that Sec is the original form of
these proteins. Moreover, by analyzing the phylogenies of 25
bacterial selenoprotein families, we detected more than twice
as many Cys→Sec conversions as Sec→Cys events. In addition, the Cys→Sec conversions were detected in many thiolbased oxidoreductase families, suggesting that in most
selenoprotein families there is a general trend toward Sec
acquisition by replacement of catalytic redox-active Cys residues with Sec. It is possible that such replacements could be
stabilized by vicinal residues in the active sites of these proteins. However, no such events were detected for FdhA, the
most widely distributed and abundant selenoprotein family,
as well as for SelD. We hypothesize that evolution of the Sec-

A total of 31 known selenoproteins were found in Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans (Deltaproteobacteria), which is the
largest selenoproteome reported thus far. This organism has
multiple glpC-hdrA-frhD-frhG-frhA operons. Phylogenetic
analyses of the genes in these operons suggested that the
hdrA-frhD-frhG-frhA cluster was laterally transferred
between Sec-decoding Archaea and Deltaproteobacteria
(Figure 3). Compared with other lateral gene transfers
between archaea and bacteria [34], selenoprotein gene transfers would be more difficult because of different mechanisms
of Sec insertion into polypeptide chains [9,18,29]. No remnant bacterial-type SECIS structures could be found in
archaeal selenoprotein genes or archaeal-type SECISes in
bacterial selenoprotein genes. However, Deltaproteobacteria
contained a five-gene operon which included GlpC, another
selenoprotein family, in addition to the genes present in Secdecoding archaea; also, complex evolutionary processes
including gene duplications and gene fusion events involving
hdrA were observed in Deltaproteobacteria. These facts suggest that Deltaproteobacteria might have gained the original
four-gene operon from Sec-decoding archaea. Coherent clustering of selenoprotein genes in Sec-decoding archaea and
Deltaproteobacteria, and the absence of the same operon in
closely related organisms indicate that this lateral transfer
might have happened only recently.

Evolutionary divergence of components of two selenium utilization traits extracted from the datasets identified in this work. Each graph contains 100
randomly selected organism pairs (points). The protein similarity (sequence divergence [SD]) of each component usually changes proportionally with the
phylogenetic distance. Correlation coefficient (CC) is shown (number in the parentheses shows an updated CC after removing horizontal gene transfer

hyperthermic conditions (Additional data file 1 [Tables S4
and S5] and Figure 6a, b). In contrast, organisms possessing
the selenouridine trait (in the situations in which the Sec trait
has been lost) favor aerobic environment and mesophilic conditions. Thus, decrease in oxygen concentration and increase
in optimal growth temperature appeared to preserve or even
stimulate the use of Sec (Figure 6c, d).
Second, for various selenoprotein families, we examined distribution, based on several environmental factors, of organisms that have selenoproteins (the Sec form) and the Sec trait;
Cys-containing homologs of selenoproteins (the Cys form)
and the Sec trait; the Cys form and no Sec-decoding trait; and
neither Sec nor Cys forms of selenoproteins and no Sec trait.
For this analysis, we selected six selenoprotein families that
have selenoproteins in at least 10 organisms and widespread
Cys-containing homologs. For most of these selenoprotein
families, a similar trend was found in which anaerobic condi-

tions correlated with the presence of the Sec form (for
instance, when species containing selenoproteins and the Sec
trait were compared with those that had Cys-containing
homologs and the Sec trait; see examples in Figure 7 and
Additional data file 1 [Tables S6 and S7]). Our data again suggested that low oxygen level (anaerobic conditions) is the factor that promotes the use of Sec forms. It is possible that at
high oxygen concentrations organisms could not tolerate the
highly reactive Sec residue, which could be easily oxidized
and could then support generation of reactive oxygen species.
As a result, negative selection effects at the DNA level (either
the loss of the whole Sec trait or Sec→Cys conversion) may be
promoted under these conditions. Table 5 shows a summary
of observed relationships between different environmental
factors and conditions and selenium utilization traits. However, we did not observe a relationship between these factors
and the number of selenoproteins (selenoproteome) in
organisms, as well as between these factors and the presence/

that FdhA is important for maintaining the Sec-decoding trait
in bacteria. Multiple selenoprotein loss events identified in
various selenoprotein families in selenoprotein-rich organisms suggest a dynamic balance between selenoprotein origin
and loss during evolution. The primary events in selenoprotein evolution are Cys→Sec conversions and selenoprotein
loss. Oxygen concentration and temperature appear to influence selenium utilization at the level of both Sec and selenouridine traits. Interestingly, although both of these traits utilize

Multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree
reconstruction and evaluation

Materials and methods

To investigate the distribution of selenoprotein-containing
organisms in various phyla, we adopted a phylogenetic tree
recently developed by Ciccarelli and coworkers [23], which is
based on concatenation of 31 orthologs occurring in 191 species with sequenced genomes.

Sequences and resources
Both completely and incompletely sequenced bacterial
genomes from the current Entrez Microbial Genome Project
were used in this study (total of 349 species, 515 genomes; 1
April 2006). Information about environmental factors associated with these genomes was also retrieved from the NCBI
database. We used Escherichia coli SelA, SelB, SelD, and
YbbB sequences as queries to search for components of Secdecoding and selenouridine traits. TBLASTN [37] was initially used to identify genes encoding homologs with a cut-off
of E-value 0.01. Orthologs were then defined using the COG
database (any two proteins from different lineages that
belong to the same COG were considered orthologs) [38].
Furthermore, these orthologs must have shown more than
25% similarity in deduced amino acid sequence and less than
30% difference in length. Because of the large number of
strains for some bacterial species, only one strain was selected
from each species (for example, Escherichia coli K12 was used
as a representative of Escherichia coli). Shigella species were
not included because Shigella and Escherichia coli may
belong to the same species based on DNA homology [39]. The
presence of the Sec-decoding trait was verified by the additional requirement for the presence of at least one known
selenoprotein gene. Seventy-five selenoprotein-containing
bacteria were found and 84 selA, 75 selB, 127 selD, and 88
ybbB genes were identified.
Representative sequences derived from 24 bacterial selenoprotein families (excluding SelD) were used to search against
the microbial genomic database for homologs with TBLASTN
cutoff E-value 1.0. Sequences of both selenoproteins and Cyscontaining homologs were retrieved and verified using COG
and additional criteria discussed above. The presence of a
putative Sec-encoding UGA codon and a downstream bacterial SECIS element were then analyzed using the bSECISearch program [28].

To reconstruct phylogenetic trees of each component of selenium utilization traits and selenoprotein families, we used
standard approaches. Sequences were aligned with CLUSTALW [40] and T-coffee [41] using default parameters.
Ambiguous alignments in highly variable (gap-rich) regions
were excluded. The resulting multiple alignments were then
checked for conservation of functional residues and manually
edited. Phylogenetic analyses were initially performed using
PHYLIP programs [42]. Pairwise distance matrices were calculated by PROTDIST to estimate the expected amino acid
replacements per position. Neighbor-joining trees were
obtained with NEIGHBOR and the most parsimonious trees
were determined with PROTPARS.
To evaluate the robustness of the trees, we also performed
maximum likelihood analysis with PHYML [43] and Bayesian
estimation of phylogeny with MrBayes [44] using different
parameters (for example, transition matrices and evolutionary models). Moreover, considering that inclusion of gap
characters could consistently improve support for nodes
recovered by substitutions, we adopted an approach in which
gap information was included as coded characters for better
phylogenetic inference [45,46]. Alignable gaps of each protein were coded as binary (presence/absence) characters and
added to the sequence matrix. This helped in the use of information on insertions/deletions during evolution and to
resolve several additional nodes, most of which were apical on
the phylogeny (ancient nodes) [45]. In total, 30 to 40 trees
were analyzed for each protein. The final phylogenetic trees
were then manually refined to reflect the most consistent
topologies among these trees. Phylogenies of SECIS elements
in different bacterial selenoprotein genes were analyzed with
similar approaches.

In order to identify the possible conversion events between
Sec- and Cys-containing forms of proteins in different selenoprotein families, we used the following logic, which is similar
to that in previous analyses of an evolutionary trend of FdhA
[28]. If a single Sec-containing sequence was clustered with a
closely related Cys-containing sequence as well as with additional, more distantly related Cys-containing sequences, then
we inferred that a Sec-containing protein evolved from a Cyscontaining protein (Cys→Sec conversion). Likewise, if a single Cys-containing sequence clustered with both closely
related and more distantly related Sec-containing sequences,
then Sec→Cys conversion was inferred. If several Sec-containing sequences from evolutionarily close organisms clustered with Cys-containing sequences and additional Cyscontaining homologs were at the root of the tree, then only
one conversion event was considered.

Second, for each selenoprotein family in focused species, we
defined Osis as the occurrence of Sec/Cys-containing
homologs in sister species and Odis as that in relatively distant
species. The following evolutionary situations were considered. First, if Osis ≤ 1 and Odis ≥ 2, or if Osis ≤ 1 and Odis ≤ 1 and
the distant homolog is most homologous to the query selenoprotein compared with homologs in other phyla (suggesting a
vertical descent but not an unrelated HGT), then the case was
taken as an indication that the selenoprotein family being

In addition, we measured, for each pair of organisms, the correlation between the similarity of orthologous pairs and that
of the 16S rRNA genes (control) to assess the general trend of
the inferred trees. A method that had been successfully used
to investigate gene essentiality in bacteria [47] was used. The
indicator of protein similarity (or sequence divergence [47])
was defined based on both sequence similarity and length difference. The distance matrix of 16S rRNAs was calculated
using DNADIST [48].

Relationships between two representative bacterial selenoprotein families

and oxygen requirement of organisms containing these proteins
Relationships between two representative bacterial selenoprotein families
and oxygen requirement of organisms containing these proteins.
Organisms containing a member of a specific selenoprotein family (either
Sec or Cys forms) were divided into four groups based on occurrence of
the following: selenoproteins, Cys-containing homologs and the Sec trait,
Cys-containing homologs and no Sec trait, and no representatives of this
family. Distribution of organisms living under different oxygen conditions
in each group is shown. (a) Peroxiredoxin (Prx). Peroxiredoxin homologs
were identified by BLAST searches and included those containing the T/
SxxU/C active site. (b) HesB-like protein. Sec+, organisms possessing the
Sec-decoding trait; Sec-, organisms lacking the Sec-decoding trait.

First, for each focused selenoprotein-containing organism,
we selected two or three sister species and three or four relatively distant species in the same phylum based on the newly
developed phylogenetic tree of life [23]. Only complete or
almost complete genomes were considered for this analysis in
order to avoid the possibility that the homolog has not been
sequenced. If a phylum contained too many sequenced
genomes, then we divided it into several taxa subgroups and
selected relatively distant species from different subgroups.
For example, for Escherichia coli, which is a selenoproteincontaining organism in Gammaproteobacteria/Enterobacteriales, we defined Salmonella enterica, Yersinia pestis
KIM, and Photorhabdus luminescens as sister species, as well
as defining Vibrio cholerae (Gammaproteobacteria/Vibrionales), Haemophilus influenzae (Gammaproteobacteria/
Pasteurellales), Shewanella oneidensis (Gammaproteobacteria/Alteromonadales), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(Gammaproteobacteria/Pseudomonadales) as relatively
distant species. A complete list of sister and relatively distant
species for each selenoprotein-containing organism is shown
in Additional data file 1 (Table S2).

analyzed may be subject to selenoprotein loss (Osis is 0) or the
loss in progress (Osis is 1) in the current phylum. Second, if Osis
> 1 and Odis > 2, then the case was taken as an indication that
this selenoprotein family is functionally conserved and widespread in the current phylum. In this case, the loss of selenoproteins was not detected. Finally, if neither of the first two
situations could be satisfied, then we could not assign a clear
evolutionary pattern. For example, if neither sister nor relatively distant species contained Sec/Cys-containing
sequences (in the case of Osis < 1 and Odis < 2), or Sec/Cys-containing sequences were abundant in sister species but rare or
absent in distantly related species (Osis > 1 and Odis < 2), then
either selenoprotein loss or gain could be possible.

This method allowed us to identify phylum-specific selenoprotein loss events with high degree of certainty. Furthermore, because it is also possible for distant species to acquire
homologous genes by HGT from other phyla, the constraints
Osis = 1 and Odis = 1, as well as an additional requirement that
distant homolog is most homologous to the query selenoprotein compared with homologs in other phyla, allowed us to
determine whether phylum-specific selenoprotein loss event
had really happened. Therefore, the orthology was confirmed
by such criterion if only one homolog was available in distant
organisms.
