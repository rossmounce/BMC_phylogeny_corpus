Abstract
Kinetoplastida are protozoan organisms that probably diverged early in evolution from other
eukaryotes. They are characterized by a number of unique features with respect to their energy
and carbohydrate metabolism. These organisms possess peculiar peroxisomes, called glycosomes,
which play a central role in this metabolism; the organelles harbour enzymes of several catabolic
and anabolic routes, including major parts of the glycolytic and pentosephosphate pathways. The
kinetoplastid mitochondrion is also unusual with regard to both its structural and functional
properties.
In this review, we describe the unique compartmentation of metabolism in Kinetoplastida and the
metabolic properties resulting from this compartmentation. We discuss the evidence for our
recently proposed hypothesis that a common ancestor of Kinetoplastida and Euglenida acquired a
photosynthetic alga as an endosymbiont, contrary to the earlier notion that this event occurred at
a later stage of evolution, in the Euglenida lineage alone. The endosymbiont was subsequently lost
from the kinetoplastid lineage but, during that process, some of its pathways of energy and
carbohydrate metabolism were sequestered in the kinetoplastid peroxisomes, which consequently
became glycosomes. The evolution of the kinetoplastid glycosomes and the possible selective
advantages of these organelles for Kinetoplastida are discussed. We propose that the possession
of glycosomes provided metabolic flexibility that has been important for the organisms to adapt
easily to changing environmental conditions. It is likely that metabolic flexibility has been an
important selective advantage for many kinetoplastid species during their evolution into the highly
successful parasites today found in many divergent taxonomic groups.
Also addressed is the evolution of the kinetoplastid mitochondrion, from a supposedly pluripotent
organelle, attributed to a single endosymbiotic event that resulted in all mitochondria and
hydrogenosomes of extant eukaryotes. Furthermore, indications are presented that Kinetoplastida
may have acquired other enzymes of energy and carbohydrate metabolism by various lateral gene
transfer events different from those that involved the algal- and α-proteobacterial-like
endosymbionts responsible for the respective formation of the glycosomes and mitochondria.

Introduction
On the basis of comparative cytology and morphology,
the Kinetoplastida are placed, together with the Euglenida, into a well-circumscribed group, the Euglenozoa. This
group of protists – usually assigned the rank of a phylum
– probably diverged early in evolution from the other
eukaryotic lineages. It is one of the several major lineages
that separated from each other in the early, as yet unresolved, diversification of eukaryotes [1,2]. The Kinetoplastida are characterized by a number of peculiarities
such as the presence of the kinetoplast, a special part of
the single mitochondrion where DNA with a highly unusual structure is found; an unusual, often highly complex
form of editing of the mitochondrial RNA; the transcription of nuclear genes as very long multicistronic RNA molecules which are then processed to mRNAs by transsplicing; the apparent absence of specific RNA polymerase
II promoters; and a unique way of metabolic compartmentation [3,4]. The most peculiar aspect in the kinetoplastids' metabolic compartmentation is the sequestering
of part of the glycolytic pathway and some other enzyme
systems within organelles called glycosomes [5-8].
In recent years, many new data have been collected about
trypanosomatid metabolism. Moreover, phylogenetic
studies have revealed the relationships between different
Kinetoplastida and between these protists and other
organisms, and have traced the evolutionary paths of the
different lineages. Based on the information from all these
studies we will attempt to reconstruct the evolution of
kinetoplastid metabolism. However, such attempts are
complicated by the facts that (1) there is still no consensus
opinion with regard to various aspects of the evolutionary
relationships; (2) by far the most information about
metabolism has been obtained for Trypanosoma brucei;
other kinetoplastids (Leishmania spp, Trypanosoma cruzi,
Phytomonas, Trypanoplasma) have been studied in less
detail and for many genera no or hardly any information
is available as yet; (3) many Kinetoplastida, including all
Trypanosomatidae studied to date, are parasites which, in
many cases, must have evolved under a strong selection
pressure to adapt to their specific host(s); this may have
led to the acquisition of new metabolic traits and loss of
others, so that important evolutionary information may
have been masked; (4) the evolution of the kinetoplastid
lineage covered probably a very long time span.
This review will primarily discuss the evolution of the
energy metabolism which takes place in different subcellular compartments in trypanosomatids, i.e. glycosomes,
the mitochondrion and the cytosol. For the sake of clarity,
the metabolism and evolution of the organelles will be
treated here separately. However, it should be realized
that the different organelles – although they have separate, independent origins- and the different branches of

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

metabolism present in the various compartments coevolved to become a highly integrated metabolic network.

Overview of phylogenetic relationships
Initially, taxonomy and inference of evolutionary relationships of Kinetoplastida were based on morphology
and the organisms' life cycles [9]. However, during the last
few decades many attempts have been made to reconstruct the evolution of Kinetoplastida by phylogenetic
analyses based on macromolecular data. Most often, such
analyses were based on small-subunit RNA (ssRNA)
genes, but a variety of housekeeping proteins were also
used (heat-shock proteins, tubulin, elongation factor 1α,
glycolytic enzymes) [e.g. [10-16]]. The relationships
between the major taxa have been well established,
although there is still some discussion about several
aspects. Based on ssRNA analyses it was shown by several
authors that various genera (Crithidia, Herpetomonas, Leptomonas, Blastocrithidia), created on the basis of classically
used criteria, are actually polyphyletic [e.g. [17]]. Also
based on an 18S ssRNA analysis, paraphyly was claimed
for the genus Trypanosoma too; the clusters of the Salivaria
(T. brucei) and Stercoraria (T. cruzi) were separated by
other genera [[18], and see other references in [11]]. However, such a conclusion is not supported by the results
obtained by most other phylogenetic analyses, including
all trees based on amino-acid sequences, and is also in
conflict with the observed conservation of specific functional motifs in proteins. The paraphyletic tree topology
obtained for Trypanosoma with ssRNA sequences is possibly an artefact caused by a high rate of substitutions in T.
brucei and outgroup lineages [19].
A largely consensus tree that will suit the purpose of this
review is given in Fig. 1A. Moreover, this figure also
presents the hosts/environments in which the representatives of the different lineages live. The Kinetoplastida are
subdivided into two groups: Bodonina and Trypanosomatina. Organisms of the first group are characterized by the
presence of two flagella and a relatively large kinetoplast.
The group contains both free-living organisms and parasites of fish and snails. The Trypanosomatina have only a
single flagellum and a smaller kinetoplast than the Bodonina. The Trypanosomatina comprises a single family,
the Trypanosomatidae, of which all members studied so
far are parasites of invertebrates (insects, leeches), all
classes of vertebrates or plants. The outgroup of the tree
presented in Fig. 1A is Euglena gracilis (Euglenida). Various
Euglena species can live as facultative phototrophs. These
organisms contain a chloroplast which, on the basis of its
three surrounding membranes and the analysis of its
DNA, pigments and some imported proteins, is supposed
to be the remnant of an endosymbiotic green alga (the
chloroplast is a 'secondary endosymbiont'). In contrast to
the Kinetoplastida, Euglena has peroxisomes [20] but no

sequences, plant cytosolic sequences and aldolases of the remainder of the eukaryotes. The trypanosomatids clustered witht
the chloroplasts sequences, while the chloroplast sequence from Euglena and those of Plasmodium grouped with the other nonplant aldolases. However, there was no bootstrap support for any of the deep-branching groups. Maximum likelihood analyses
grouped all plant sequences (chloroplast and cytosol) as well as the sequences from Euglena, Plasmodium and the Trypanosomatidae together in a single star-like subtree.

*Several enzymes, while of plastid or cyanobacterial origin, are found in the plant or algal cytosol. For example, the glycosomal trypanosomatid
GAPDH and its cytosolic counterpart from Euglena gracilis are close relatives of the GAPDH isoenzyme 1 from cyanobacteria [134]. Interestingly,
this isoenzyme is clearly distinct form the plastid GAPDH of plants, which has been derived from the cyanobacterial isoenzyme 3 [59]. Modified
from [22]. Abbreviations: PPP, pentosephosphate pathway; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ROS, reactive oxygen species. Supplementary material is

glycosomes [21] and its mitochondria do not contain a
kinetoplast DNA network.

Metabolic peculiarities which are shared by all
Kinetoplastida and absent from (most) other
taxa

We recently presented molecular evidence that Trypanosoma and Leishmania contain a considerable number of
proteins that are more similar to homologues found in
the cytosol or chloroplasts of plants and algae, than to the
corresponding proteins from other lower eukaryotes [22].
As an example the phylogenetic tree for the glycolytic
enzyme aldolase is shown in Fig. 1B. Moreover, some proteins found in trypanosomes are otherwise specific for
plants, such as sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase. A
number of other plant-like traits have been reported
before in other publications [e.g. [23-25]]. All these data
are summarized in Table 1. We have interpreted these data
as suggesting that the acquisition of an algal endosymbiont did not occur in the euglenid lineage as assumed so far
(reviewed in [26,27]), but already at an earlier stage, by a
common ancestor of the Euglenida and the Kinetoplastida [22]. Only the chloroplast of the endosymbiont was
retained by the Euglenida, whereas the Kinetoplastida lost
the endosymbiont altogether, except for a considerable
number of its genes. The details of this evolutionary process, and its metabolic implications will be discussed
below.

As mentioned in the Introduction, Kinetoplastida are
characterized by the presence of several metabolic peculiarities. The presence of shared features within all members
of this order strongly suggests that these must have been
present in the common ancestor of all these organisms.
Because of their relevance for our evolutionary analysis,
we will discuss here in more detail the various shared features and the variations found for each of them in the
present-day kinetoplastids.
Glycolysis and glycosomes
In all Kinetoplastida studied, the major part of the glycolytic pathway is found in organelles called glycosomes
(reviewed in [6-8]). These organelles are authentic peroxisomes as may be inferred by different criteria: (1) glycosomes, like other members of the peroxisome family
(peroxisomes, yeast microbodies and plant glyoxysomes)
are bounded by a single phospholipid bilayer membrane,
have an electron-dense proteinaceous matrix and do not
contain any detectable DNA; (2) although glycolytic
enzymes are the most prominent proteins in glycosomes
(they may comprise up to 90% of the content in bloodstream-form T. brucei), some other enzymes or enzyme
systems may be present and are shared with peroxisomes:
e.g. enzymes of peroxide metabolism, fatty acid oxidation

Kinetoplastid Biology and Disease 2003, 2

and ether-lipid biosynthesis; (3) glycosomes and other
members of the peroxisome family have a homologous
process of biogenesis [7,28]. The matrix proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, with similar peroxisome-targeting
signals and are imported by a similar mechanism, involving a cascade of several proteins (called peroxins – acronym 'PEX') which are homologous in the different
organelles. It may be concluded, therefore, that the common ancestor of Kinetoplastida and other eukaryotes
already contained peroxisomes and that an ancestral
organism in the kinetoplastid lineage additionally
acquired the capability to compartmentalize the major
part of the glycolytic pathway in these organelles (or alternatively, this ability existed in the ancestral peroxisomes
but was lost in all organisms except Kinetoplastida). How
this may have happened will be discussed below.
Although the presence of glycolysis in peroxisomes is
unique, it should be appreciated that the enzymic content
of these and related organelles may differ considerably
between different organisms. Indeed, the astounding metabolic diversity of the members of the peroxisome family
has been already identified many years ago and reviewed
by de Duve [29] and Borst [30,31].
The glycosomes constitute separate compartments surrounded by membranes that, according to accumulating
evidence, are poorly permeable for most metabolites
including adenine nucleotides and NAD(H) (reviewed in
[8]). For movement of metabolites across the membrane
specific transporter molecules are invoked. Indeed, recent
work provides strong indications for the existence of such
transporters e.g. homologues of ABC transporters
involved in fatty-acid transport across peroxisomal
membranes of yeasts and mammalian cells [32] (C. Yernaux and PM, unpublished). The notion of a closed compartment implies that stoichiometric relationships should
be found between the substrates and products of all processes that occur simultaneously inside the organelle.
Indeed, glycosomes sequester enzymes in such a way that
no net changes in ATP/ADP ratio or in NAD+/NADH ratio
seem to occur during the activity of the metabolic processes in the organelle [6,8]. For example, in bloodstreamform T. brucei, where glycolysis is virtually the only process occurring in the glycosomes, the enzymes converting
glucose into 3-phosphoglycerate are all inside the
organelle, whereas the last three enzymes are present in
the cytosol (Fig. 2A). As a consequence, the intraglycosomal consumption of ATP by hexokinase (HXK) and
phosphofructokinase (PFK) is balanced by the ATP production by phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Net ATP production occurs in the cytosol, in the reaction catalyzed by
pyruvate kinase (PYK).

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

Similarly, the NADH resulting from the reaction catalyzed
by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
is re-oxidized inside the organelle followed by the transfer
of the electrons to a mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate
oxidase (GPO). This process occurs via a redox shuttle
comprising a glycosomal NAD+-dependent glycerol-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), a putative transporter
in the glycosomal membrane which exchanges glycerol 3phosphate for dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and the
mitochondrial GPO. The transporter remains to be identified, but its existence is inferred from the low permeability
of the glycosomal membrane and the requirement for
strict coupling of the fluxes by which the two
triosephosphates are exchanged [5,33]. The GPO complex
contains a FAD-linked GPDH that is most likely
associated with the outer surface of the mitochondrial
inner membrane, ubiquinone and a terminal oxidase,
known as the alternative oxidase (AOX), that is insensitive
to cyanide, but can be inhibited by salicylhydroxamic
acid. The redox process catalyzed by the GPO is nonprotonmotive, and thus not coupled to ATP formation.
Procyclic, insect-stage T. brucei, and several other trypanosomatids (e.g. different life-cycle stages of Leishmania spp
and T. cruzi) have a more elaborate energy- and carbohydrate metabolic network that also involves the mitochondrial Krebs' cycle enzymes and a respiratory chain with
coupled transmembrane proton-translocating activity
[34,35]. In these cells, two other ATP-dependent kinases
(phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate phosphate dikinase [PPDK]) are found in the glycosome,
whereas PGK is relocated to the cytosol, with the consequence that the ATP/ADP balance is maintained (Fig. 2B).
Similarly, the presence of a glycosomal NAD+-dependent
malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and NADH-dependent
fumarate reductase (FRD) in these cells (see below) is
accompanied by a significant drop in the activity of
GPDH, so that the NAD+/NADH balance is maintained.
Although this aspect of enzyme distribution and stoichiometric relationship of metabolites and balances for ATP/
ADP and NAD+/NADH has not been studied in detail in
many Kinetoplastida, the available evidence suggests that
the situation is similar throughout the order. This suggests
either a similar evolution, in this respect, in all these
organisms or, more likely, that the glycosome did not
serve for net production of ATP (and NADH) in the common ancestor of the group.
It should be noted that a stoichiometric description of glycosomal metabolism in procyclic trypanosomes has not
only to be based on the quantitative distribution of fluxes
through the various branches of carbohydrate catabolism,
but also on other reactions which occur simultaneously
inside the organelle, or transport of metabolites across its
membrane, and which, for the sake of simplicity, are not

through complex I of the respiratory chain of trypanosomatids is coupled to proton expulsion. The mitochondrion contains
two membranes; the inner membrane containing the respiratory chain and H+-ATPase has been drawn in this figure.

presented in Fig. 1B. For example, the glycosomal anabolic processes providing PPi have not been presented. For
metabolic schemes comprising most of these other glycosomal processes in procyclic T. brucei, see [8].
The fact that PGK's localization is either glycosomal or
cytosolic – or both, as observed in promastigotes of different Leishmania species, T. cruzi epimastigotes and T. borreli
[36-39] – as required to maintain the glycosomal ATP/
ADP balance, offers a rationale for finding phosphoglycerate mutase and enolase always in the cytosol [5,40-42].
Although the localization of these enzymes is not directly
relevant for the ATP/ADP and NAD+/NADH balances, it
would not provide any selective advantage to have them
inside the glycosomes with a variable compartmentation
of PGK and a constitutive expression of PYK in the cytosol.
Initially, it was proposed that the confinement of glycolytic enzymes inside an organelle was an evolutionary
adaptation of trypanosomatids to sustain a high glycolytic
flux [6]. All glycosomes together constitute about 4% of
the total cellular volume of T. brucei, and the enzymes are
present at a relatively high concentration. It was therefore
assumed that the sequestering of enzymes overcomes a
diffusion limitation of glycolytic metabolites and thus
enables a high flux. However, this notion is now considered unlikely. First, a relatively high glycolytic flux is only
found for some trypanosomatids that live in sugar-rich
environments (bloodstream-form T. brucei and Phytomonas living in plant saps and fruits), not in most other
members or life-cycle stages. There is no reason to assume
that the capacity for a high glycolytic flux must have been
a selective advantage for the ancestral kinetoplastids
[43,44]. Second, it was shown that yeast can have a twofold higher flux than T. brucei, with a less than two-fold
higher glycolytic protein content that is not compartmentalized [45]. Third, calculations have shown that, even if
the enzymes were dispersed over the entire cytosol, the
glycolytic flux of bloodstream-form T. brucei would not be
limited by diffusion of metabolites from one enzyme to
the next, but rather by the catalytic activity of the enzymes
[44].
Another intriguing aspect of glycosomes is the apparent
lack of activity regulation of the glycolytic enzymes HXK
(shown for T. brucei and T. cruzi) and PFK (shown for T.
brucei and L. donovani) [46-49]. In most organisms, the
activities of these two key enzymes, as well as that of PYK,
are highly regulated, by their products, by metabolites further downstream in the metabolism or by other (allosteric) effectors. This regulation serves two purposes. First,
it prevents the loss of ATP by futile cycling when glycolysis
and gluconeogenesis occur simultaneously. Second, it has
been argued, and experimentally confirmed by using yeast
mutants, that the design of glycolysis is intrinsically dan-

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

gerous by the fact that ATP is first invested before net production takes place ("turbo design") [50]. This investment
of ATP makes the reactions catalysed by the first enzymes
virtually irreversible and thereby insensitive to enzyme
activity further down the pathway (Fig. 3A). This may lead
to unrestricted accumulation of glycolytic intermediates
unless the activity of the first steps of the pathway (i.e.
HXK and PFK) is tightly regulated to prevent this.
The question then arises of why the activities of the glycosomal HXK and PFK are not regulated in trypanosomatids, whereas their cytosolic PYK is highly regulated. A clue
has been obtained by computer studies. A mathematical
model of glycolysis in bloodstream-form T. brucei was
constructed and used to assess the metabolic consequences of compartmentation [45,51]. One of the questions addressed was how the functional behaviour of
trypanosome glycolysis would change if the pathway were
not compartmentalized. According to the computer
model this would not significantly affect the steady-state
glycolytic flux, in agreement with the conclusions
described above. But strikingly, it would lead to toxic
accumulation of hexose phosphates upon addition of glucose. Such toxic accumulation was prevented by compartmentation, since the kinases in the beginning of the
pathway then respond to the lower glycosomal ATP/ADP
rather than to the higher cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio (Fig.
3B). This prediction made by the computer model may be
experimentally testable by using recently developed T.
brucei cell lines in which glycosomal protein import can
be impaired by depletion of peroxin mRNAs through RNA
interference (RNAi) [52,53]. Upon induction of PEX14
mRNA degradation, bloodstream-form cells, which are
entirely dependent on glycolysis, were readily killed. In
accordance with the model, glucose also appeared to be
toxic for the corresponding procyclic trypanosomes, but
these cells survived when grown on non-sugar substrates.
Therefore, we may conclude that the compartmentation
of glycolysis serves a regulatory function that compensates
for the lack of activity regulation of its enzymes.
One may wonder if this regulatory function played a role
in establishing the glycosome in the ancestral kinetoplastids. We prefer the notion that the apparent absence of
activity regulation is a derived character, for the following
reasons. (1) Enzymes such as HXK and PFK are regulated
in virtually all organisms [54]; some activity regulation
mechanisms are shared between the enzymes of pro- and
eukaryotes and must, therefore, also have been present in
the enzymes of ancestral kinetoplastids. (2) Because of the
compartmentation and the low permeability of the glycosomal membrane for many metabolites, some regulatory
mechanisms may have become redundant (due to loss of
selective pressure to maintain them) or cannot work
(since the effectors are produced outside the glycosome);

Implications of the "turbo" design of the glycolytic pathway
Implications of the "turbo" design of the glycolytic pathway. (A) The design of the glycolytic pathway, with its first
steps (HXK, PFK) kept far from equilibrium by continuous investment of ATP, may lead to unrestricted accumulation of intermediates, if no tight regulation of these steps occurs by product or feed-back inhibition. (B) The compartmentation of the
major part of the pathway in trypanosomes (resulting in no net ATP production inside the glycosome), may lead to a low ATP/
ADP ratio sensed by HXK and PFK (and different from the ratio in the cytosol), thus keeping the activities of these enzymes
under control without need for feed-back inhibition. Abbreviations: I, metabolic intermediate; S, substrate; P, product.

the kinetoplastids could afford to lose them. Interestingly,
the compartmentation seems to have resulted in a kind of
're-routing' of regulatory mechanisms. In most eukaryotes, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate allosterically activates PFK
and inhibits fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (F1, 6BPase)
that catalyses the reverse reaction in gluconeogenesis.
Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is the most potent physiological regulator of glycolysis known [55]. This is also true in
kinetoplastids, where however it has no effect on PFK, but
activates the cytosolic PYK [56-59]. In contrast, in the
related Euglena -as in plants- a (pyrophosphate-dependent) cytosolic PFK is activated and the F1, 6BPase inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. The domains of PFK
and PYK that have, in non-kinetoplastids and kineto-

plastids respectively, a high-affinity binding site for the
allosteric effector fructose 2,6-bisphosphate are not
homologous; the presence of the effector site in the different enzymes represents a clear example of convergent
functional evolution. Although the regulated enzymes are
different in Kinetoplastida and other eukaryotes, the
mechanisms responsible are homologous. In kinetoplastids, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is synthesized and
hydrolyzed in the cytosol [57] by 6-phosphofructose-2kinase and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, respectively,
which are distant from, but yet evolutionarily related to 6phosphofructose-2-kinase and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase of other eukaryotes (N. Chevalier and PM,
unpublished). Furthermore, the binding site for fructose

Page 8 of 30
(page number not for citation purposes)

Kinetoplastid Biology and Disease 2003, 2

2,6-bisphosphate in trypanosomatid PYKs corresponds to
the effector site for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate found in
PYKs of other eukaryotes and must have evolved from
such a site in a common ancestral PYK [60,61]. These
observations suggest that the common ancestor of Kinetoplastida and other eukaryotes possibly had similar regulation mechanisms for glycolysis, but that the situation has
changed when glycolysis became compartmentalized in
the former lineage.
The apparent absence of activity regulation of key glycolytic enzymes such as PFK nevertheless remains remarkable, however, because a F1, 6BPase was recently detected
in T. brucei [22]. The enzyme appeared to contain a peroxisome-targeting signal (PTS) and was indeed located
inside glycosomes of both bloodstream-form and procyclic trypanosomes, simultaneously expressed with PFK
(VH, unpublished). However, so far no F1, 6BPase activity
could be detected in bloodstream-form and procyclic cells
cultured with glucose, although the enzyme was shown to
be active when expressed heterologously in E. coli. This
suggests the existence of an as yet unidentified mechanism
of activity regulation to prevent futile cycling by these
enzymes. The finding of PFK and F1, 6BPase within a single compartment also invalidates the hypothesis, which
we proposed previously [43], that the glycosome has a
role for spatial separation of fluxes through different pathways such as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, as an alternative device for activity regulation of key enzymes to
prevent unwanted interference.
Evolutionary origin of the succinate production pathway
within glycosomes
As mentioned above, in procyclic T. brucei and in the different life-cycle stages of most other trypanosomatids, all
or most glycosomal NADH produced in the GAPDH reaction is not reduced via the GPDH/GPO shuttle, but by
other redox enzymes expressed in the glycosomes, MDH
and FRD. This is achieved in the following way (see Fig.
2B) [6,35,62]. Instead of a glycosomal PGK as in bloodstream-form T. brucei, a cytosolic PGK is expressed. The
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate produced by GAPDH leaves the
glycosomes, has its 1-phospho group transferred to ADP
by PGK to form ATP, and is further metabolized to PEP.
Part of this PEP re-enters the glycosome, another part may
be converted in the cytosol to pyruvate to be directed to
mitochondrial metabolism or used for alanine production. The glycosomal PEP may follow two routes. Either it
is converted to pyruvate by the glycosomal enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) [63], with the concomitant production of ATP from AMP and PPi, or to
oxaloacetate by the catalytic action of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, also leading to ATP production. These
two glycosomal kinases (PPDK and phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase) compensate for the replacement of the

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

glycosomal PGK by a cytosolic isoenzyme, and guarantee
that the glycosomal ATP/ADP balance is maintained. The
oxaloacetate is further converted inside the glycosomes to
succinate, an important metabolic end product, by the
catalytic action of three glycosomal matrix enzymes,
MDH, fumarase and FRD [62].
What could be the evolutionary rationale for this glycosomal succinate production? A clue may be found in the
presence of the soluble NADH-dependent glycosomal
FRD [62]. Most FRDs characterized so far in prokaryotes
and eukaryotes are associated with oligomeric membraneprotein complexes, use quinols as electron donors,
participate in electron-transfer chains and are expressed
under anaerobic conditions [64]. Only very few organisms are known to express a soluble FRD that is not associated with membrane complexes [65]: in the bacterium
Shewanella sp. the enzyme is expressed under anaerobiosis, accepts electrons from quinols and is part of an electron-transfer chain [66]. In Saccharomyces cerevisae two
soluble FRD forms are expressed under anaerobiosis and
use FADH2/FMNH2 as electron donors [67]. The T. brucei
procyclic form (probably all trypanosomatids, except the
T. brucei bloodstream form) expresses the glycosomal
NADH-dependent FRD under aerobiosis (and probably
also isoenzymes in other compartments [62]).
In 1980, a theory was developed regarding the evolution
of biological energy-transducing systems, with a key role
for FRD [68]. The theory states that in primitive anaerobic
organisms, lactic fermentation of hexoses (glycolysis)
(Fig. 4A) evolved to "succinic fermentation" by replacing
a NADH-dependent reductase (lactate dehydrogenase) by
a pathway of four steps containing a CO2-fixation enzyme
(phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or pyruvate carboxylase), fumarase and two NADH-dependent reductases
(MDH and a soluble NADH-dependent FRD) (Fig. 4B).
This evolutionary step would offer the significant advantage of requiring 50% less pyruvate (or PEP) to maintain
the NAD+/NADH balance and consequently of sparing
the remainder of this tricarbon compound for biosynthetic processes. Subsequently, the rate of energy production could be considerably improved by integrating FRD
into an electron transfer chain, as observed for most of the
present day anaerobic organisms using fumarate as the
final electron acceptor [65]. Finally, with the appearance
of aerobic conditions, the membrane-bound FRD evolved
to a membrane-bound succinate dehydrogenase.
Interestingly, the glycosomal metabolism in the procyclic
form of T. brucei, and probably all trypanosomatids except
the bloodstream form of the T. brucei group, resembles the
'succinic fermentation' in anaerobic organisms (Fig 4Cvs
Fig. 4B): (1) the trypanosomatids are the only known
organisms that express soluble NADH-FRD; (2) glyco-

Comparison of glycolysis in primitive anaerobic organisms and trypanosomatids
Comparison of glycolysis in primitive anaerobic organisms and trypanosomatids. The consumption of one glucose
molecule through glycolysis generates two molecules of pyruvate, ATP and NADH. To maintain the redox balance (NAD+/
NADH ratio) of the cell, NADH produced by GAPDH has to be oxidized to NAD+. In the simplest fermentation scheme, the
lactic fermentation (panel A), which probably occurred in the primitive anaerobic organisms, NAD+ is stochiometrically regenerated by converting pyruvate into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase [68]. A variation of this primitive scheme, the "succinic fermentation" (Panel B), is the replacement of the reduction step (lactate dehydrogenase) by one carboxylation step (pyruvate
carboxylase) followed by two reduction steps (MDH and FRD). The consequence of this adaptation is that one half of the PEP
is converted into succinate to maintain the redox balance, while the other half can be used for biosynthetic pathways. In 1980,
Gest [68] proposed that the primitive FRD was soluble and NADH dependent, whereas none of the known present-day FRDs
possess both characteristics. Interestingly, the trypanosome glycosomal FRD is soluble and NADH dependent [62]. Panel C
shows the succinate product pathway recently characterized in the procyclic form of T. brucei, which ressembles primitive "succinic fermentation". The NAD+, NADH, ADP and ATP molecules produced by this pathway are bold faced and underlined,
with a special attention to NAD+/NADH which are circled. For the boxed glycolytic metabolites (G-3-P, 1, 3BPGA, 3-PGA,
PEP and/or pyruvate), two molecules are produced per glucose consumed. End products (lactate, succinate and acetate) are in
white characters on a black background. The metabolic flux at each enzymic step, necessary to maintain stoichiometric relationships of all reactions in the cell (panels A and B) or compartment (panel C), is tentatively represented by arrows with different thickness.

somal FRD seems to play a role in the maintenance of the
redox balance in the organelle; (3) all key enzymes which
lead to succinate production from glucose are located in
the same compartment, i.e. the glycosomes; (4) while the
procyclic cells are grown under aerobic conditions, the
glycosomes can be considered as anaerobic compartments
and (5) as proposed for the 'succinic fermentation' in
primitive anaerobic organisms, the presence of a glycosomal NADH-FRD in trypanosomes implies that part of
the cytosolic PEP can be used for other catabolic or anabolic pathways, either directly or after conversion into
pyruvate by the cytosolic pyruvate kinase.
The idea that heterotrophy, with glycolysis as the central
process, is the most ancient form of metabolism has been
seriously questioned by recent evolutionary analyses [e.g.
[69]]. It seems probable that, in prokaryotes, autotrophic
metabolism developed first, and that glycolysis evolved
later as a reverse process of the gluconeogenic pathway
[54,70]. This scenario renders the hypothesis as proposed
by Gest, which implies that glycolysis is an early process
in anaerobic prokaryotes, unlikely. Nevertheless, the
notion of glycolysis as the pathway of carbon metabolism
ancestral to eukaryotes is firmly asserted, and the principle
of pathway extension as proposed by Gest may well be the
rationale by which trypanosomes evolved their succinate
production pathway.
The pentosephosphate pathway and glycosomes
Glycolysis is not the only metabolic process occurring in
glycosomes. Like in other members of the peroxisome
family, enzymes involved in peroxide metabolism can be
found in these organelles, although catalase, the hallmark
enzyme of peroxisomes, has not been detected in glycosomes of T. brucei and Leishmania species. It is however
present in glycosomes of Phytomonas and Crithidia. Other
pathways or enzymes shared with peroxisomes are β-oxidation of fatty acids, the first part of the biosynthesis of
ether lipids and HMG-CoA reductase for isoprenoid synthesis. Glycosomes contain also enzymes of the pentosephosphate pathway; the presence of the dehydrogenases
of this pathway has been reported too for rat liver peroxisomes [71]. Unique for glycosomes is, however, the presence of enzymes involved in purine salvage, pyrimidine
biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis [6-8,72]. The presence
of gluconeogenesis in glycosomes was already discussed
above. The compartmentation of this pathway can be
understood, because most of its enzymes, catalyzing reactions which are reversible under physiological conditions,
are shared with glycolysis. However, the existence of a
mechanism that prevents uncontrolled simultaneous
activity of both processes seems essential. Such a mechanism remains to be identified in kinetoplastids. A discussion of the presence of the pentosephosphate pathway in
glycosomes is highly relevant for this review, because the

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

activity of this alternative glucose-breakdown process
provides the cell with NADPH for reductive biosyntheses
and the defense against oxidative stress and with ribose 5phosphate to be used in nucleotide synthesis. A cell distributes its glucose breakdown via the glycolytic and the
pentosephosphate pathways, depending on the relative
needs for ATP, NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate. A variable extent of interplay between these pathways may tune
the levels required for ATP, reduced cofactor or
metabolites.
In bloodstream-form T. brucei cells, the relative flux
through the pentosephosphate pathway will be very
minor, as inferred from the amount of pyruvate produced
from glucose. Even in growing cultured cells the amount
of pyruvate observed is close to the maximum possible of
two molecules of pyruvate produced per molecule of glucose consumed. The channelling of glucose into the pentosephosphate pathway must therefore be very small.
Moreover, the pentosephosphate pathway enzymes have
low specific activities compared to those of the glycolytic
pathway. However, the specific activities are considerably
higher in procyclic T. brucei and in Leishmania promastigotes. For two enzymes of this pathway studied in T. brucei
(glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase) a dual distribution was found: 15 – 50%
of the activity appeared to be associated with glycosomes,
the remainder was present in the cytosol [73,74]. It is
expected that this will also be the case for other enzymes
in T. brucei and Leishmania, because various other
sequences bearing a PTS were identified in the genome
databases (e.g. ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase, ribose-5phosphate isomerase, transketolase).
There may be several reasons for having the pathway, or at
least a part of it, in both compartments. (1) The glycolytic
and pentosephosphate pathways should be able to
exchange intermediates to adjust to cellular needs for ATP,
reductive power and nucleotide precursors. (2) The endproduct ribose 5-phosphate is converted into 5-ribosyl-1pyrophosphate that will serve in the purine and pyrimidine biosyntheses, processes occurring within the glycosomes. (3) Enzymes involved in the defense against
reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been found both in
the cytosol and glycosomes [75,76]. For example, a peroxidase was located in T. cruzi glycosomes that, via glutathione and tryparedoxin, receives its electrons from
trypanothione [76]. Moreover, indications have been
obtained for the presence of trypanothione reductase not
only in the cytosol but also in the glycosomes of T. cruzi
and T. brucei. These defense systems are, via trypanothione
reductase, ultimately dependent on NADPH produced
through the pentosephosphate pathway.

Whether the redox reactions involving NADPH/NADP
within the glycosome are linked via a shuttle mechanism
to redox reactions outside the organelle, or if there is a balance in NADPH formation and consumption by the different glycosomal enzyme systems dependent on this
cofactor, remains to be established. So far, no glycosomal
transhydrogenase activity has been identified that could
be responsible for establishing a redox equilibrium
between the organellar NADP(H) and NAD(H) pools.

How did glycosomes originate?
The evolutionary origin of glycosomes has been a matter
of interest since the identification of these organelles, over
25 years ago [5,40,77]. Our original hypothesis proposed
that the glycosome was derived from a bacterial endosymbiont, in a manner similar to mitochondria and chloroplasts, but that it had lost its entire genome [78]. This
absence of remnant DNA has complicated the uncovering
of the organelle's evolutionary tracks. Initial analyses of
glycosomal matrix-protein gene sequences did not provide any convincing indications for the relocation of a
prokaryotic endosymbiont's genes for glycolytic enzymes
to the nucleus of its eukaryotic host. Subsequently, the
endosymbiont theory lost its appeal when studies of the
biogenesis of glycosomes, peroxisomes, microbodies and
glyoxysomes clearly proved that these organelles must
have had a common, monophyletic origin and that protein import into these organelles appeared unrelated to
that of any protein translocation mechanism known in
prokaryotes [7,28,43].
Glycosomes appeared to be true peroxisomes and, therefore, they seemed not to be relics of an endosymbiont.
The most likely origin of the ancestral organelle that gave
rise to different members of the peroxisome family is,
therefore, from within the primitive eukaryote itself. A
problem associated with this hypothesis seemed the presence of glycolysis (and major parts of other pathways)
uniquely in glycosomes. How did these pathways end up
in glycosomes? One possibility, although unlikely and
not supported by any data, is that they have always been
there; they were only retained in the kinetoplastid glycosomes but lost from all other members of the organelle
family. Alternatively, glycolysis was acquired only by peroxisomes of the ancestral Kinetoplastida. A conceptual
problem with this latter hypothesis is the fact that transfer
of a pathway to an organelle should have occurred "en
bloc", because the formation of a functional pathway
through a successive transfer of individual enzymes to the
organelle should be considered highly unlikely. As argued
elsewhere, intermediate stages would not be an advantage
to the organisms but, rather, would be a burden [78,79].
Other questions to be addressed by any hypothesis that
does not invoke an endosymbiotic event for the formation of the new organelle is how it should multiply itself

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

and how it could be passed on to the progeny of the ancestral cell that acquired it.
In recent years, we have characterized genes for a considerable number of metabolic enzymes of T. brucei and L.
mexicana, while through research by others and through
genome-sequencing
projects
corresponding
gene
sequences have become available for a large number of
organisms representative of all major taxa. This has enabled us to re-investigate thoroughly the phylogenetic relationships of trypanosomatid metabolic enzymes. As
described above, the surprising finding was made that a
considerable number of parasite enzymes are most closely
related to enzymes from phototrophic organisms; either
enzymes from plants/algae-cytosolic or plastidic- or from
cyanobacteria [22]. Moreover, Trypanosomatidae appear
to share some other features with plants, such as the presence of the polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic acid and αlinolenic acid, and the presence of acidocalcisomes, which
have properties similar to plant vacuoles (see below).
Intriguingly, we detected a sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (S1, 7BPase), that is considered to be a hallmark
of the Calvin cycle of photosynthetic organisms. Together
these data suggest that ancestral Kinetoplastida must have
harbored a phototrophic endosymbiont. Most likely, this
endosymbiont is the same as the green alga that gave rise
to the chloroplast (secondary endosymbiont) in the
Euglenida; the phototrophic endosymbiont was acquired
by the common ancestor of Kinetoplastida and Euglenida.
It was retained as an organelle in many euglenids, but lost
in kinetoplastids, while still leaving some traces in the
present-day organisms (Fig. 5).
Although such plant/algal-like proteins are found in various compartments of the trypanosomatid cell (e.g. the
mitochondrial AOX mentioned above is found in all
plants and algae, as well as in some fungi and Dictyostelium discoideum too), it is remarkable that a relatively high
number of them represent enzymes of the glycolytic and
pentosephosphate pathways present in the glycosomes
(see Table 1). Also several other (putative – as inferred
from the presence of a PTS) glycosomal enzymes (superoxide dismutase, adenylate kinase, peroxidases) have
plant features and the S1, 7BPase, having a PTS, is most
likely also present in the organelle. We hypothesize, therefore, that a major part of the endosymbiont's metabolic
machinery and genome was transferred "en bloc" to a peroxisome of the ancestral kinetoplastid, after the divergence of this lineage from the euglenids. This could have
occurred by a direct fusion. A critical aspect of this event
would be that DNA from the endosymbiont's nucleus or
chloroplasts ended up in the hybrid organelle. This would
provide the daughter organelles also with the capability of
expressing the proteins acquired from the endosymbiont.

organelles to daughter cells continued to occur as for the
original peroxisome. In due time, genes were transferred
from the organelle to the host nucleus, or were lost, while
the new organellar proteins acquired a PTS (Fig. 6). In the
long run, all DNA was lost and all new proteins involved
in functions of the organelle became encoded in the host's
nucleus.
These latter steps of the process are similar to what has
happened during evolution in most eukaryotes to genes
now present in the nucleus and coding for mitochondrial
and chloroplast enzymes; they are considered relatively
minor evolutionary steps. As inferred from phylogenetic
analyses, the glycosomal enzymes of the extant
trypanosomatids constituting the glycolytic and the pentosephosphate pathways may have originated from the
endosymbiont's cytosolic enzymes involved in similar

processes, or from those of its chloroplast, where similar
reactions are catalyzed by enzymes of the Calvin cycle. The
acquisition of a PTS either by enzymes encoded by the
genes transferred from the hybrid endosymbiont/peroxisome to the host nucleus, or by the original host genes,
resulted in the organelles' present-day mosaic appearance
(Table 1). The relocation of a large number of algal
enzymes has dramatically changed the metabolic functions of the original peroxisome and has been a crucial
step toward the formation of the present-day glycosome
with carbohydrate catabolism as its hallmark.
An interesting aspect is that one of the glycolytic enzymes
from the endosymbiont seems to have ended up in the
cytosol: a cofactor 2,3-bisphosphate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase. This enzyme appears not only most
similar to its plant counterparts in a phylogenetic analysis

Also some other endosymbiont proteins - from cytosol, vacuoles, mitochondrion - were retained.
However, many of the Endosymbiont’s membrane systems (boundary membrane, chloroplast membranes)
were lost. Genes of endosymbiont proteins that have been retained were transferred to the host nucleus

[22,41], but also in the fact that it uses cobalt as catalytic
metal ion, rather than manganese that is used by most
other cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutases
[80,81]. This is remarkable because in general only very
few eukaryotic enzymes are cobalt dependent. Moreover,
most parasitic kinetoplastids live in habitats where the
availability of this metal is extremely low. Nevertheless,
these organisms have not changed their metal preference
during evolution. The reason why this enzyme was not
retained in the organelle, but was relocated to the cytosol,
has been discussed above.

tone phosphate with the amino acid's side chain. Therefore, the dihydroxyacetone phosphate cannot be
positioned in the kinetoplastid and chloroplast aldolases
as it is in the Gly-containing aldolases. It will only fit in
the active site if some space is available elsewhere, for
example by a different position of the side chain of a conserved Ser residue. Because of the shared active-site structural features, it seems very likely that plastid and
kinetoplastid aldolases have a monophyletic origin and
may share catalytic properties, i.e. the capability to synthesize sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate.

Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase

Based on (1) the necessity for an interplay of the glycolytic
and pentosephosphate pathways, (2) the possible bifunctional nature of aldolase, and (3) the presence of the S1,
7BPase with its likely (at least in part) localization within
glycosomes like many glycolytic and regular pentosephosphate pathway enzymes, we propose a metabolic,
stoichiometric scheme shown in Fig. 7A (compared with
the classical scheme of the pentosephosphate pathway
given in Fig. 7B). The routes depicted in this figure (or
similar, equally feasible stoichiometric schemes) allow
the trypanosomatids to tune the yield of ATP, NADPH
and ribose 5-phosphate, dependent on their needs, by
varying the relative fluxes through the two pathways for
glucose breakdown, and varying the interplay of these
pathways via their nodes of shared metabolites.

As mentioned above, S1, 7BPase gene sequences have
been detected in trypanosomatids (T. brucei, T. cruzi and
L. major). Detailed inspection of the encoded amino-acid
sequence showed that it is very likely an active, authentic
S1, 7BPase. This finding is surprising, because S1, 7BPases
have so far only been found in chloroplasts where the
enzyme plays a role in the Calvin cycle. However, the presence of a functional Calvin cycle in kinetoplastids may be
excluded; for example, there is no indication from
genome databases or biochemical studies for the presence
of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase ("rubisco").
Because the Calvin cycle and the pentosephosphate pathway are processes which are similarly organized and share
a number of enzymes, we postulate that in trypanosomatids the S1, 7BPase is involved in an unusual kind of pentosephosphate pathway. The substrate for the enzyme,
sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate is, in chloroplasts,
formed through the action of a bifunctional aldolase. This
bifunctional enzyme can perform the regular glycolytic
reaction, the condensation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, as well as the condensation of glyceraldehyde 3phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate to sedoheptulose
1,7-bisphosphate. Glycolytic aldolases can perform only
the former (reversible) reaction.
However, in a phylogenetic analysis, the glycosomal aldolases of T. brucei and L. mexicana, which are known to
function in glycolysis, appeared to form a robust monophyletic group with the chloroplast aldolases from both
plants and algae (Fig. 1B and [22]), suggesting that they
are also capable of forming the bisphosphorylated sevencarbon sugar. This conclusion is reinforced by structural
analysis. Plastid and kinetoplastid aldolases share a specific Gly-Ala substitution in the active site. The Ala is not
found in any of the non-chloroplast aldolases analyzed.
Based on crystal-structure analysis [82], structure
modelling and molecular-dynamics studies (unpublished), it may be concluded that this seemingly minor
substitution has major consequences for the active site. In
glycolytic aldolases, the presence of an alanine would
result in a clash of the phospho group of dihydroxyace-

What may have been the initial function of
glycosomes?
Above, several functions of the glycosome, or consequences of the specific way of metabolic compartmentation by these organelles in Kinetoplastida, have been
discussed. Although several features of this compartmentation seem important for the metabolism of present-day
trypanosomes, and for their viability, they may all be
derived characters, as a result of a long evolution and the
adaptation of different kinetoplastids to highly specific
environments. It is difficult to imagine what may have
been the selective advantage to the ancestral kinetoplastid
for the peroxisome to be modified into a glycosome by
the events described above. Nevertheless, recent research
on yeast peroxisomes has provided significant insight into
the advantage of having important parts of their metabolism compartmentalized into peroxisomes. The outcome
of this research seems highly relevant for our search for an
overall function of glycosomes that pertains to many
Kinetoplastida and may have provided an important
selective advantage throughout evolution, both in the initial and later stages.
Many Kinetoplastida have a complex life cycle in which
they encounter a number of highly different
environments and undergo major morphological and
metabolic changes [3,83]. The metabolism of these organ-

isms is characterized by an exceptional degree of flexibility. Through this metabolic flexibility the organisms are
able to respond efficiently to large and often sudden nutritional changes. We postulate that the unique compartmentation of metabolism involving glycosomes confers
similar adaptability. Recent data obtained by peroxisome
research using different yeasts (Hansenula, Pichia, Saccharomyces) have shown that peroxisome biogenesis and degradation are inducible. The turnover of the organelles
occurs in a regulated and selective way, dependent on the
culturing conditions (Fig. 8). It appears that the compartmentation of key metabolic enzymes in these yeast
organelles endows the cells with the capability of adapting
in a rapid and efficient manner to new growth substrates.
The peroxisomal population is heterogeneous. Peroxisomes grow and, at a certain size, multiply by budding
and fission. However, after fission, the mature organelles
lose their capacity to incorporate additional proteins:
import of these molecules is confined to the smaller
daughter organelles that have budded off. By incorporating new proteins only into new organelles, the organism
can prepare peroxisomes adapted to a new situation:
organelles with a different set of enzymes of which the
expression is induced by the altered growth conditions.
Similarly, the degradation of peroxisomes appears inducible and selective. When yeast peroxisomes with specific
enzymic content are no longer needed because of a
change in environmental conditions, the individual old
peroxisomes are tagged for degradation and subsequently
removed by autophagy ("pexophagy") (Fig. 8) [reviewed
in [84-86]]. We hypothesize that the glycosomes of Kinetoplastida serve a similar function: metabolic units that
are easily and efficiently replaced by other units (glycosomes with a modified enzymic content) when different
environmental conditions are encountered, or when the
cells differentiate to prepare for a change (e.g. transition of
replicating long-slender T. brucei to non-replicative, shortstumpy cells, prepared for transmission to the tsetse fly
intestine). Research to test this hypothesis is in progress
(M. Herman and PM).
The notion that glycosomes/peroxisomes provide metabolic flexibility necessary for adaptation to changing
growth conditions should possibly hold true to many
more organisms. For example, E. gracilis can gow under
both phototrophic and heterotrophic conditions. Cells
grown in the dark on acetate have peroxisomes containing
active enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, whereas its
enzymes of the glycolate pathway have low activity. When
these cells become green upon exposure to light, the activity of the former enzymes and catalase increase only
slightly, while the glycolate pathway enzymes, necessary
for photorespiration, show a large increase in activity [20].

The role of the mitochondrion in kinetoplastid
metabolism, and its evolution
As mentioned already above, different Kinetoplastida
dwell in highly different environments, and also the
conditions encountered by kinetoplastid species at different stages of their life cycles may differ dramatically. These
environmental variations also involve the energy and carbohydrate sources and the oxygen supply.
Mammalian-infective T. brucei and plant-infective Phytomonas, living in sugar-rich environments (blood and plant
tissues such as phloem, latex and fruits) have an
essentially fermentative metabolism, with a major
involvement of the glycosomes. Nevertheless, the mitochondrion plays an important role in the energy metabolism of all Kinetoplastida studied, even in these largely
glycolytic life-cycle stages where many functions of the
organelle are repressed. This largely repressed mitochondrion has a simple morphology (hardly any cristae), lacks
most Krebs' cycle enzymes and is incapable of oxidative
phosphorylation. Although these essentially glycolysisdependent forms of T. brucei and Phytomonas do not
express a cytochrome-containing respiratory chain, they
both have an active GPO associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. As mentioned above, the function
of the GPO is to oxidize the excess of reducing power generated by glycolysis. By RNAi it was shown for bloodstream-form T. brucei that the plant-like AOX of the GPO
is very important, if not essential [87]. Furthermore, in
bloodstream-form T. brucei, an electrical membrane
potential could be measured across the membrane, which
is not produced by the GPO activity but by the F0F1ATPase that is present [88]. Some genes of the mitochondrial DNA are transcribed and their RNA edited. Also an
active complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of
the respiratory chain has been described for these T. brucei
cells, and has been suggested to transfer electrons via ubiquinone to the AOX [89]. Indeed, it has been shown for
several mitochondrial genes and for some components of
the RNA editing machinery that they are also vital for
long-slender bloodstream-form T. brucei [90].
The other kinetoplastids analyzed so far have a well-developed mitochondrion sometimes with most Krebs' cycle
enzymes and often even with all enzymes of the cycle. A
functional cytochrome-containing respiratory chain capable of energy-transduction is present, although the occurrence of a functional complex I is a matter of debate. A
functional AOX is also present in procyclic T. brucei, but
its presence in Leishmania pro- and amastigotes has been
questioned [91]. In addition to the Krebs' cycle enzymes,
the mitochondrial matrix appears to possess an acetate:succinate CoA transferase cycle that is also involved in
ATP generation (Fig. 2B) [92]. The insect-stage trypanosome can use both glycolytic substrates and amino acids

yeasts [84-86]. New growth conditions requiring peroxisomes with a different enzymic content lead to induction of peroxisome degradation ('pexophagy'); individual, mature peroxisomes are tagged for recognition by phagosomes/vacuoles (step 1),
while new, small organelles may serve as mother organelles for peroxisome development under new inducing conditions. The

as carbon and energy sources. Amino acids, notably proline, are the predominant carbon sources in the insect
midgut and hemolymph. As a consequence, proline is the
most important nutrient for several insect-stage kinetoplastids [93]. It enters the mitochondrion where it is converted to glutamate and, after transamination to αketoglutarate becomes available as substrate for the Krebs'
cycle enzyme α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (Fig. 2B).
However, sugars are alternative substrates (obtained for
example via plant saps or blood meals). The pyruvate
resulting from glycolysis enters the mitochondrion and,
via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, is converted to
acetyl-CoA. However, proline is not necessarily the preferred carbon source used by culture-adapted procyclic T.
brucei [94]; a rate of proline consumption approximately
3-4 times lower than glucose or threonine has been measured ([95]; FB, unpublished). Furthermore, it was
reported that the relative rates of glucose and proline consumption may be highly dependent on the nature of the
growth-limiting nutrient and the growth rate [96].
Whether sugars or amino acids are the carbon/energy
source in trypanosomatids and are metabolized by the
mitochondrion, it is remarkable that none of them is
completely degraded to CO2, but instead, to succinate,
acetate, lactate and alanine (when glucose is used as a substrate) or succinate (with proline – as observed in experiments with procyclic T. brucei). Recently, it was shown
that the full Krebs' cycle is not used by procyclic T. brucei
that have been provided with either glucose or proline,
although all enzymes are present [95]. Indeed, when incubated in the presence of [C6-14C]-D-glucose, none of the
produced CO2 is radiolabelled, confirming that the acetylCoA resulting from glycolysis is not metabolized through
the Krebs' cycle ([95]; FB, unpublished). Consequently,
acetyl-CoA produced in the mitochondrion by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex must have been converted
into the secreted end product acetate via the acetate:succinate CoA transferase cycle.
The ATP production in this cycle occurs by an enzyme
shared with the Krebs' cycle, succinyl-CoA synthase. Furthermore, proline is also only partially metabolized to
succinate, supposedly via α-ketoglutarate and succinylCoA by succinyl-CoA synthase (Fig. 2B) [95]. Interestingly, it was shown by RNAi that succinyl-CoA synthase is
essential for growth of procyclic T. brucei in a medium
containing both glucose and proline, indicating that
mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation is essential for ATP production in the parasite [97]. However, respiratory-chain activity is essential for growth and survival.
It is important for the oxidation of excess reducing power
(NADH) and possibly also for the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient necessary for additional ATP
production (oxidative phosphorylation), for solute

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

transport and for protein import involved in the
organelle's maintenance and biogenesis. It has been proposed that the presence of an AOX in procyclic T. brucei,
in addition to the cytochrome c oxidase, is also important
for removing excess reducing equivalents and so preventing the production of reactive oxygen species [98]. This is
similar to one of the functions attributed to the AOX in
plant mitochondria [99].
One may, therefore conclude, that in procyclic trypanosomes metabolism is also essentially fermentative, despite
the presence of a full enzymatic machinery for oxidative
metabolism. No exogenous electron acceptors other than
oxygen are known to function with trypanosomatid mitochondria, in line with the observation that these organisms stop growing under anaerobiosis. Some
trypanosomatids may survive during periods under anaerobic conditions, but this could not be attributed to anaerobic respiration. In bloodstream-form T. brucei, under
anaerobic conditions, glycerol 3-phosphate accumulates
in the glycosome and the glycosomal ATP/ADP ratio
drops. This leads then to conversion of glycerol 3-phosphate into glycerol with concomitant synthesis of ATP via
the reverse action of the glycosomal glycerol kinase (Fig.
2A). By this process, one molecule each of pyruvate and
glycerol are produced per molecule of glucose, instead of
two molecules of pyruvate, and the net production of ATP
is decreased from two molecules to one. Indeed, the cellular ATP levels drop significantly [100]. The cells remain
viable for some hours, but the decreased ATP production
seems not to be sufficient to sustain growth for longer
periods. Under anaerobiosis for 24 h, or when the AOX
activity is significantly decreased by the inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid or RNAi, cells will eventually die [87].
For L. infantum promastigotes, it has also been shown that
they, to a certain extent, could survive periods without respiration [101]. These cells showed a reduced glucose degradation, sluggish motility and inhibition of
proliferation. Prolonged anaerobiosis resulted in metabolic arrest, which was shown to be reversible for up to 48
h upon restoration of oxygen supply, but for longer periods (after > 100 h) was followed by death. How these cells
survive for some period in the absence of oxygen remains
to be determined; no electron acceptors other than oxygen
could be identified for the respiratory chain. It is also feasible that in procyclic T. brucei (as well as T. rhodesiense, T.
gambiense, T. equiperdum and T. evansi) anaerobiosis can
be temporarily overcome via glycerol production. However, other Trypanosoma species (T. vivax and T. congolense), Phytomonas and Leishmania have a limited capacity
to produce glycerol [102]. This has been attributed to specific features of the active-site structure of the glycosomal
glycerol kinase, affecting the substrate affinity of the
enzyme [103].

It should be stressed again that most knowledge about
trypanosomatid metabolism has been obtained for two
life-cycle stages of T. brucei: the bloodstream and the procyclic forms. As we discussed already, the bloodstreamform is highly peculiar, and many of its features are
possibly only representative, to some extent, for Phytomonas, but not for other kinetoplastids, not even for the
mammalian-infective stages of other trypanosomatids
such T. cruzi and various Leishmania species. One may
wonder to what extent the T. brucei procyclic form is representative of other metabolic stages and of other kinetoplasts. As for T. brucei, it has been found for all of the other
kinetoplastids studied so far (T. cruzi epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, amastigote-like forms; promastigotes or amastigotes of various Leishmania species, Crithidia fasciculata
or C. luciliae choanomastigotes) that glucose or amino
acids are not, or not fully, converted to CO2, but to
organic acids or other typical fermentation products (succinate, acetate, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, ethanol, glycerol), despite the presence of a functional respiratory
chain in all these forms [reviewed in [34,35,104]]. In Phytomonas also, with its mitochondrion in which cytochromes and most Krebs' cycle enzymes could not be
detected [105,106], similar end products of glucose
metabolism were found (acetate, ethanol, CO2, glycerol
and small amounts of various organic acids) [107].
These data indicate that all kinetoplastids studied have an
essentially aerobic fermentation, not involving a full
Krebs' cycle activity. The respiratory chain is, in most
cases, functional and may serve to oxidize the excess of
reducing power and to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation; but this remains to be established for most
kinetoplastids. Phytomonas is a peculiar case by lacking a
classical respiratory chain. The excess of reducing equivalents generated during glycolysis in its glycosomes may be
shuttled to the mitochondrial GPO by the involvement of
glycosomal and mitochondrial MDHs [108]. Furthermore, part of the glycolytically produced pyruvate seems
to enter the mitochondrion, to be converted into acetate
via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and acetate:succinate CoA transferase [92]. The NADH produced in this
process may transfer its electrons via a NADH dehydrogenase complex I and ubiquinone to AOX; a functional
complex I is possibly present [106]. Several other dehydrogenases (e.g. MDH and a low-substrate specificity alcohol dehydrogenase with high affinity for iso-propanol)
have been detected in the Phytomonas mitochondrion, but
their precise function in energy metabolism remains to be
established [108,109].
Despite all these examples suggesting that a functional full
Krebs' cycle activity is not used, even if all enzymes are
present, and the seemingly partial use of the capacities for
respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, full use of

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

metabolic potential cannot be excluded for the various
other life-cycle stages of the highly limited sample of
trypanosomatids studied, or for other kinetoplastids.
Even two trypanosomatids with seemingly very similar
metabolic patterns, such as cultured insect stages of L.
donovani and T. brucei, showed important differences
when subjected to a comparative physiological analysis by
using a chemostat [96,110,111]. These parasites employ
widely different strategies when dealing with changing
environmental conditions. L. donovani aims at strictly
maintaining internal homeostasis, while T. brucei displays
a rather opportunistic style by adjusting its metabolic
processes to get maximum energy efficiency. These differences may well reflect the diets of their respective hosts.
Leishmania spp. reside in the sand fly that feeds on plant
juices as well as blood, while the tsetse fly, host of T.
brucei, restricts itself to blood meals only.
How should the evolutionary development of the metabolic particularities of the kinetoplastid mitochondrion
be explained? Of course, other even more distinct features
of the mitochondria of these organisms have repeatedly
raised the question as to the evolutionary history of the
organelle. These features include the kinetoplast DNA
with its highly unusual structure and replication mechanism [112], the organization and structure of the genes
encoded by this DNA and the unique and extensive editing of its precursor RNAs to functional mRNAs
[16,113,114]. Despite these unusual aspects (outside the
scope of this review and not discussed further here), the
generally accepted notion is that the mitochondrion arose
in a common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes, including
the Kinetoplastida [115,116].
Phylogenetic studies point towards a monophyletic origin
of the organelles from an endosymbiont related to
present-day α-proteobacteria. Several data suggest that
this endosymbiont has given rise not only to the large
diversity of mitochondrion-related organelles comprising
both aerobically and anaerobically functioning mitochondria, characterized by the presence of different sets of
enzymes and different electron donors and acceptors for
their respiratory chains, in addition to the 'classical' mitochondrial systems, but also to hydrogenosomes, hydrogen-producing organelles found phylogenetically
dispersed
in
anaerobically
living
organisms
[115,117,118]. To explain this common origin, it is supposed that the ancestral endosymbiont was a facultative
anaerobic bacterium that possessed the majority of the
aerobic and anaerobic systems found in mitochondria of
different taxons of present-day organisms. These systems
comprise: the Krebs' cycle, a respiratory chain with several
terminal oxidases for oxygen and other electron acceptors
and with quinones of corresponding redox potential (ubiquinone for oxygen and nitrate, menaquinone for fuma-

rate), hydrogenase, both a pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex and a pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and
an acetate:succinate CoA transferase (Fig. 9).
It has been proposed that in aerobic environments the
anaerobic capacities of the original endosymbiont were
lost or modified, whereas in lineages of organisms living
anaerobically the aerobic capacities were lost. In addition,
the organelles could be further modified by the acquisition of new enzyme systems via lateral gene transfer. For
the Kinetoplastida, it was then inferred that, during evolutionary history, hydrogenase was lost (Fig. 9). Similarly,
respiratory-chain oxidases relying on non-oxygen acceptors and the capacity to synthesize quinones of low redox
potential were lost, at least in those organisms studied (T.
brucei, Leishmania), and mitochondrial metabolism
became largely fermentative (incomplete oxidation of carbon sources to succinate and acetate). The retainment of
not only the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, but surprisingly also the O2-sensitive pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase is suggested by the finding that T. brucei
contains a DNA sequence encoding a homologue of this
enzyme [119], and reports of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity in procyclic forms of both T. brucei [120]
and T. congolense [121]. One major acquisition was the
AOX (Fig. 9), possibly from the algal-like endosymbiont
that is also assumed to have contributed substantially to
the glycosomal enzyme systems.

Other aspects of the evolution of energy
metabolism in Kinetoplastida
Based on the information provided above about the evolutionary tracks of energy metabolism in Kinetoplastida,
and the hypotheses put forward, some inferences may be
made about the metabolism of the common ancestor of
all Kinetoplastida. The ancestor, before the divergence of
Kinetoplastida and Euglenida, must have possessed a
mitochondrion, peroxisomes and, very probably, a phototrophic green alga-like endosymbiont. The presence of
this symbiont implies that the organism was free-living in
surface layers of water where photosynthesis was possible.
This was, most likely, a (facultatively) aerobic environment. Moreover, by photosynthesis, the organism was
able to produce oxygen itself. The presence of peroxisomes would have protected the organism against reactive
oxygen species, whereas the mitochondrion will have enabled the cells to produce sufficient ATP. The glycolytic,
gluconeogenic and pentosephosphate pathways of this
organism are supposed to have been present in the cytoplasm, and were only later (partially) compartmentalized,
i.e. early in the kinetoplastid lineage, when the glycosome
was created by a kind of merger between the algal endosymbiont and a peroxisome [22,122].

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

In different Trypanosomatidae (T. brucei, T. cruzi and
Leishmania species) as well as in Apicomplexa (Plasmodium, Toxoplasma) acidic Ca2+ storage organelles have been
found which have been called acidocalcisomes [reviewed
in [123]]. Further research showed that acidocalcisomes
are storage organelles not only for Ca2+, but also contain
a high content of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi),
polyphosphate, Mg2+, Na+ and Zn2+. The membrane of
these organelles contains various proton-ion exchangers
and proton- and Ca2+-pumping ATPases, responsible for
the acidification and ion accumulation. An important
enzyme of the organelle is the proton-translocating pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase), related to the V-H+-PPase found
in vacuoles of plants and algae and in chromatophores of
some photosynthetic bacteria. Interestingly, it was
recently shown that electron-dense vacuoles, already identified a long time ago in the green alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, are very similar to the acidocalcisomes [124].
These vacuoles have a matrix that is similarly acidic and
has a comparable chemical composition. Moreover, similar proton pumps were identified. In view of the strong
indications for a green-algal endosymbiont in ancestral
organisms of both Apicomplexa and Kinetoplastida, it
seems possible that these unrelated groups of protists also
acquired the acidocalcisomes by this route. However, further support for this notion would require more studies
on the distribution of these organelles among protists and
on their relationship with acidic polyphosphate-containing granules in other microorganisms and plants. Indeed,
acidocalcisomes have recently also been described in the
slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum [125].
The acidocalcisomes seem to play a role in trypanosomatid energy metabolism. Through their ion and proton
pumps, these organelles may be involved in the regulation of the intracellular pH and osmolarity, and it has
been proposed that the PPi accumulated in these
organelles act as energy store. This would be complementary to the use of the polysaccharide mannan, which was
identified as a carbohydrate and energy store in several
trypanosomatids [34]. In bloodstream-form T. brucei, no
accumulation of either PPi or mannan has ever been
observed. Nevertheless, acidocalcisomes are also important for these cells; depletion of the V-H+-PPase by RNAi
led to reduced growth of both bloodstream-form and procyclic T. brucei, loss of acidity of acidocalcisomes, and
reduction of their polyphosphate content [126]. Furthermore, it was shown for procyclic cells that the ability for
pH homeostasis was severely affected.
Because of the presence of acidocalcisomes in trypanosomatids, and the important role of PPi in the function of
these organelles, one may wonder if this high-energy compound exerts additional important roles in the energy
metabolism of these organisms, or has done so in earlier

Figure scenario of the evolution of the mitochondrion in Kinetoplastida

Possible scenario of the evolution of the mitochondrion in Kinetoplastida. A facultative anaerobic, 'pluripotent'
ancestral eukaryote was formed by endosymbiosis of a facultative anaerobic α-proteobacterium by an archaebacterial host. It
has been proposed [118] that different capacities of the original symbiont were lost in different eukaryotic lineages, leading to
different types of organelles (aerobic mitochondria, anaerobic mitochondria, hydrogenosomes). In Kinetoplastida, the original
hydrogenase, anaerobic terminal oxidases and the capacity to synthesize quinones of low redox potential were lost. Indications
for the retainment of the PFO have been reported, but its presence still requires unequivocal confirmation. The kinetoplastid
mitochondrion acquired an AOX and its metabolism became partially fermentative (see text). Abbreviations: AOX, alternative

stages of their evolution. Indeed, the PPDK mentioned
above is an enzyme discovered in glycosomes of various
trypanosomatids (although not expressed in bloodstream-stage T. brucei) that reversibly converts PEP into
pyruvate with the concomitant synthesis of ATP from
AMP plus PPi [63].
Intriguingly, the glycosomal PFKs of all Kinetoplastida
have a strictly ATP-dependent activity but the sequences
analyzed (T. brucei, L. donovani, T. borreli) are more similar
to PPi-dependent PFKs than to their ATP-dependent counterparts [49,127]. This suggests that the enzyme has been
derived from a PPi-dependent ancestral PFK, which
changed its phospho-donor specificity during evolution.
In nature, glycolysis can be linked to either PPi or ATP. If
the PPi, produced as a side product of biosynthetic processes, is not hydrolyzed by pyrophosphatase, but its high
energy is invested in glycolysis by the action of PPi-PFK
and/or PPDK, instead of using ATP, theoretically the net
ATP yield of glycolysis increases from two to maximally
five molecules per molecule of glucose consumed. This
variation involving PPi has been found in many obligate
or facultative anaerobic protists and bacteria, organisms
which often live under energy-limiting conditions
[128,129]. If indeed a change from PPi – to ATP-dependent glycolysis has occurred in some ancestral organisms, it
would suggest that energy limitation was no issue for
these organisms. During evolution, the process might
have changed its specificity: this would have involved an
alteration of the PFK active site to modify the phosphosubstrate specificity and the replacement of PPDK by PYK.
As was shown by site-directed mutagenesis, changing the
preference of a PFK from PPi to ATP is feasible, suggesting
the presence of a latent binding site for the larger nucleotide substrate [130].
When did the kinetoplastid PFK obtain its specificity for
ATP as phospho donor? Did the specificity change during
the evolution of the lineage or in an earlier ancestor,
before the Kinetoplastida or Euglenozoa branches
occurred? Or has the ATP-dependent PPi-like enzyme
been acquired by lateral gene transfer? Possible answers to
these questions were provided both by a phylogenetic
analysis and by analysis of sequence motifs that can be
correlated with known functions. The kinetoplastid PFKs
appeared to be most related to a class of PFK isoenzymes
found in the anaerobic protist Entamoeba histolytica and
the Spirochaetes Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum [49,131,132]. Two Arabidopsis thaliana sequences also
cluster in this group [132]. All these sequences resemble
PPi-PFKs, but it has been shown that the activity of this
minor PFK isoenzyme of Entamoeba is ATP-dependent
[133], like that of the kinetoplastid PFKs. The major PFK
of E. histolytica is an authentic PPi-PFK and is more dis-

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

tantly related. The phospho-donor specificity of the Spirochaetes and Arabidopsis isoenzymes remains to be
determined. However, it is very likely that they are also
ATP dependent, because they contain the active-site
glycine that is suggestive of nucleotide binding, rather
than the aspartic acid residue correlated with PPi dependence [49]. We assume, therefore, that the change of phospho-donor specificity occurred not within the
kinetoplastid lineage. The ATP-dependent, PPi-like PFK
was either already present in primitive eukaryotes and
passed on to the kinetoplastid lineage, or it entered the
kinetoplastids by lateral gene transfer. In case of the latter
possibility, it could have happened via the algal endosymbiont, or by a different event, for example by lateral transfer from a Spirochaete (see also below). PPi-PFKs are
common in plants and algae. They contain different PFK
isoenzymes with activities dependent on either ATP or PPi
[128]. Searching the Arabidopsis genome database revealed
several other genes coding for PPi-PFK-like proteins, some
also having the active-site motif indicative of ATP binding,
while others have probably remained PPi dependent. So
far, however, no Euglena sequence similar to that of kinetoplastid PFKs has been identified that could reveal more
clues about the origin of the kinetoplastid enzyme.
The fact that a PPDK is present inside the glycosomes may
be explained by the presence of PPi producing segments of
various biosynthetic processes inside the organelle: fattyacid oxidation, and pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis
[8,63]. Indeed, no pyrophosphatase activity could be
detected within the organelle [127], so that PPDK seems
to fulfil the task of PPi hydrolysis. Whether the PPDK was
originally present in the ancestral organism, or if it was
acquired with the phototrophic endosymbiont and
retained in the glycosome is not clear.
Interestingly, for another kinetoplastid glycolytic enzyme,
the glycosomal GAPDH, a close phylogenetic relationship
with its counterpart of Spirochaetes was also recently
shown [134,135]. A very similar GAPDH isoenzyme
present in the cytosol of Euglena [11,136] formed part of
the same monophyletic cluster. The conclusion based on
the phylogenetic analysis was reinforced by the presence
of similar insertions and specific residues in these GAPDHs which may participate in endowing their active-sites
with specific structural and functional properties [11].
Furthermore, trypanosomatid enolases appeared most
related to the corresponding enzyme from Entamoeba, but
not to the enolases from Euglena, which in turn were more
similar to the homologue from the spirochaete Treponema
pallidum than they were to homologues from any of many
other organisms sampled [42,137]. These findings may
suggest that lateral transfer of various housekeeping genes
may have occurred from an ancestral spirochaete to the
common ancestor of the Euglenida and Kinetoplastida, as

Kinetoplastid Biology and Disease 2003, 2

well as to the ancestor of Entamoeba. The different lineages
each retained a different set of transferred genes. More
studies will be necessary to provide further support for
this hypothesis.
There are strong indications that another glycolytic
enzyme also entered the trypanosomatid lineage by lateral
gene transfer: the cytosolic isoenzyme of GAPDH. All
members of the Trypanosomatidae studied so far have
two GAPDH isoenzymes, one in the cytosol and the other
one -the Spirochaete-related enzyme- in the glycosomes.
These two enzymes differ considerably in amino-acid
sequences (about 55% identity) and kinetic properties
[138-140]. In the bodonid T. borreli only a single GAPDH,
related to the glycosomal isoenzymes of the Trypanosomatidae and the cytosolic one of E. gracilis, could be
detected [141], although GAPDH activity was measured
in both compartments. These data suggest that initially
the Kinetoplastida contained only a single GAPDH
present in both compartments. In an ancestral trypanosomatid, after the divergence from the bodonids, an additional GAPDH was acquired, most likely by lateral gene
transfer from a γ-proteobacterium [134,135]. The newly
obtained enzyme established itself in these organisms to
fulfil the cytosolic GAPDH functions, whereas the original
GAPDH became fully compartmentalized inside the glycosomes. The glycosomal enzyme is directly involved in
the glycolytic flux going through the glycosomes [142],
whereas the function of the cytosolic isoenzyme has still
to be identified. This is currently being addressed in T. brucei cells in which the expression of the enzyme is
decreased by RNAi (VH, unpublished).

Evolution of parasitism in Kinetoplastida
Whereas many kinetoplastids parasitize only a single host
(so called 'monogenetic' parasites), others have two hosts
('digenetic' parasitism): an invertebrate (arthropod or
leech) and a vertebrate. The invertebrates transmit the parasites between the vertebrate hosts. As long as a century
ago, two opposing theories were proposed about the
question of which host was the original one. One theory
states that parasitism started with monogenetic kinetoplastids of non-bloodsucking insects, which then became
parasites of haematophagous insects and subsequently
also of vertebrates ('invertebrate first') [143,144]. The
other hypothesis ('vertebrate first') has it that kinetoplastids initially established themselves as parasites in the
alimentary tract of vertebrates -while transmitted as cysts, then invaded the blood and were subsequently transmitted by blood-sucking invertebrates. According to this
second theory, the monogenetic insect-dwelling kinetoplastids evolved from the digenetic ones [145,146].
Arguments in this discussion were originally based on
parasitological data only, but new insights into phyloge-

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

netic relationships based on sequence data have, in recent
years, contributed to it [3,15,17]. This new combination
of parasitological and phylogenetic data has not yet
solved the issue; support for both hypotheses has been
inferred from the available data. Moreover, these analyses
have led to proposals that the transition to parasitic life
style occurred multiple times in kinetoplastids and that
the process may still occur now and in the future. A comprehensive discussion of the origin and evolution of parasitism in Kinetoplastida is outside the scope of this review,
and the reader is referred to the references given. We will
address the issue here briefly from a metabolic perspective. Although knowledge about the metabolism of kinetoplastids is unlikely to provide a definite solution to the
'invertebrate first versus vertebrate first' issue, it may provide additional arguments to the discussion.
It may be important to appreciate, in this respect, that in
both theories the invasion of parasites into the blood
circulation system, although via different scenarios, plays
a prominent role. It seems relevant to note that parasites
living in a stable environment, with plentiful carbon
sources as energy supply and materials for biosynthetic
processes have a highly reduced metabolism. This is
clearly illustrated both by the bloodstream-form of African trypanosomes and by Phytomonas species living in
plants. In most representatives of the former group, a
majority of the available genetic information for metabolic catabolic and anabolic systems (of glycosomes,
mitochondrion and cytosol) is repressed in the mammalian-infective stage; it is only expressed in the insect-stage
trypanosomes which have a much more elaborate metabolism. In two species, T. evansi and T. equiperdum, which
cannot complete cyclical transmission in the tsetse fly but
instead are mechanically transmitted, mitochondrial gene
expression is even disrupted by massive deletions and
rearrangements [147,148]. Similarly, mitochondrial activity in Phytomonas serpens was shown to be severely affected
by loss of genes [106].
Another striking example is the inability of bloodstreamform T. brucei to maintain a neutral pHin under acidic conditions [149-151]. The cell relies on the constant blood
pH of the host and seems to have repressed part of its system for pHin homeostasis. In contrast, procyclic trypanosomes and other trypanosomatids employ an active H+ATPase for pHin homeostasis over a wide range of pHout
values [152]. These data suggest that parasites will readily
repress their metabolic capacity when living in a plentiful
and stable environment such as blood and plant saps or
fruits, and may even dispense with an important part of
the DNA coding for functions not necessary for life in this
environment, unless they will need the encoded proteins
during other stages of their life cycle. This seems to provide some support for the 'invertebrate first' hypothesis.

The alternative is rendered less likely by the fact that the
bloodstream parasite may have lost genes essential for a
potential life under the more demanding conditions of
the insect alimentary tract, but redundant for its stay in the
mammalian bloodstream, well before the blood-sucking
insect became available for transmission of the parasite
between mammals.

Conclusions
Research in recent years has shown that the eukaryotic cell
is a chimera. Different parts of its protein content and different organelles can be traced to different origins. This
chimeric origin seems particularly true for the unicellular
Protista, where lateral transfer of genes, from prokaryotes
or other protists must have occurred frequently during
evolutionary history. As we discussed in this review, such
gene transfers have possibly also been important in shaping the kinetoplastid cell, and even involved the core
energy- and carbohydrate metabolism.
Biochemical and molecular biological research on different Kinetoplastida and information that became available
through genome sequencing projects have recently provided the possibility to reflect, on a more solid basis than
before, upon the evolution of energy and carbohydrate
metabolism in these protists. The common ancestor of the
Kinetoplastida and Euglenida must have been a free-living
organism, because all estimates indicate that it must have
existed in a period of the earth's history when
multicellular organisms did not exist yet. It already contained peroxisomes and a mitochondrion, and may thus
have lived either aerobically or anaerobically. In addition
to the lateral transfer of genes associated with the acquisition of the endosymbiont that developed into the mitochondrion, influxes of genes for metabolic enzymes from
other organisms may have also occurred.
In addition, the kinetoplastid lineage seems to have
acquired a green alga as an endosymbiont and could live
phototrophically; this alga was reduced to a chloroplast in
the Euglenida. In Kinetoplastida, the selective advantage
to exploit light as energy source was apparently less strong
than that for living merely heterotrophically on organic
carbon sources such as sugars. Consequently, the alga was
lost, but only after it had transferred many of its genes to
the host nucleus. Also present-day euglenid species are
known which have lost the capacity for photosynthesis
and can only grow heterotrophically [153,154]. They may
still retain the organelle, but with a highly reduced plastid
genome; this was shown, for example, for Astasia longa
[155]. The loss of the endosymbiont from the ancestral
kinetoplastid may have happened via a transitory stage
that involved fusion with host cell compartments.

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11

Proteins encoded in the nucleus, either from the original
host or endosymbiont, were provided with signals to
route them to appropriate cell compartments. In this way,
many enzymes involved in energy/carbohydrate metabolism ended up in the peroxisomes which consequently
became glycosomes. Maybe acidocalcisomes were also
acquired in this period. Representatives of the kinetoplastids spread over a variety of different environments
and, in due time, many of them became parasites of
insects, leeches, representatives of all major vertebrate lineages and even plants. The transition to parasitism may
have allowed the loss of metabolic capabilities when the
kinetoplastid could rely for them on the host organism,
for example for constant environmental conditions with
regard to carbohydrate and energy sources, pH and oxygen, or for the availability of building blocks for various
biosynthetic processes, as found in blood circulation systems. On the other hand, when the parasite lived in a host
compartment where conditions may have regularly
changed, such as in an alimentary tract, it was imperative
to retain a large metabolic capacity.
Where kinetoplastids evolved to digenetic parasites,
involving two different hosts and often even different host
tissues, they had to find means for efficient adaptation of
their metabolism to the -sometimes highly- different environments encountered. This implied the development of
mechanisms to regulate differentially the expression of
their metabolism in different life-cycle stages. Metabolic
flexibility must have been a highly selective advantage
during the different stages of this evolutionary scenario;
possibly, the availability of core metabolism compartmentalized within glycosomes has been instrumental in
this respect.
The present-day kinetoplastids comprise a large variety of
protist organisms which share some morphological and
molecular features derived from a common ancestor, but
yet may be quite different because they have evolved
along separate tracks for a long time, in some cases for
hundreds of millions of years, and dwell in highly different environments. In this review, we have tried to trace
parts of the tracks by which energy metabolism in these
organisms evolved. We have based our evolutionary
reconstruction largely on new data obtained by recent
biochemical analysis and genome sequencing projects.
However, the available data are highly biased with almost
all analyses done on only a few parasitic trypanosomatids,
particularly T. brucei. For a better understanding of the
evolution of energy metabolism of Kinetoplastida it will
be necessary to continue analyzing the data obtained by
the genome sequencing projects of T. brucei, L. major and
T. cruzi, which will reach completion in the near future,
and by the subsequent functional large-scale projects on
these
organisms

metabolome). Biochemical, cellular and molecular biological analysis of a larger sample of kinetoplastids (e.g.
Phytomonas, parasitic and free-living Bodonina) and comparison with data from other protists (among others
Euglena) will be important to better understand how and
why the peculiarities of kinetoplastids evolved and why
many of these organisms have become such successful
parasites. This knowledge may also help to develop compounds to efficiently combat the various serious diseases
of mankind, livestock and crops caused by kinetoplastid
parasites.
