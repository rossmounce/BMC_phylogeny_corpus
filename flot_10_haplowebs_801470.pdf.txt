Haplowebs as a graphical tool for delimiting
species: a revival of Doyle’s “field for
recombination” approach and its application to
the coral genus Pocillopora in Clipperton
Jean-François Flot1,2,3,4*, Arnaud Couloux2, Simon Tillier3

Abstract
Background: Usual methods for inferring species boundaries from molecular sequence data rely either on gene
trees or on population genetic analyses. Another way of delimiting species, based on a view of species as “fields
for recombination” (FFRs) characterized by mutual allelic exclusivity, was suggested in 1995 by Doyle. Here we
propose to use haplowebs (haplotype networks with additional connections between haplotypes found cooccurring in heterozygous individuals) to visualize and delineate single-locus FFRs (sl-FFRs). Furthermore, we
introduce a method to quantify the reliability of putative species boundaries according to the number of
independent markers that support them, and illustrate this approach with a case study of taxonomically difficult
corals of the genus Pocillopora collected around Clipperton Island (far eastern Pacific).
Results: One haploweb built from intron sequences of the ATP synthase β subunit gene revealed the presence of
two sl-FFRs among our 74 coral samples, whereas a second one built from ITS sequences turned out to be
composed of four sl-FFRs. As a third independent marker, we performed a combined analysis of two regions of the
mitochondrial genome: since haplowebs are not suited to analyze non-recombining markers, individuals were
sorted into four haplogroups according to their mitochondrial sequences. Among all possible bipartitions of our
set of samples, thirteen were supported by at least one molecular dataset, none by two and only one by all three
datasets: this congruent pattern obtained from independent nuclear and mitochondrial markers indicates that two
species of Pocillopora are present in Clipperton.
Conclusions: Our approach builds on Doyle’s method and extends it by introducing an intuitive, user-friendly
graphical representation and by proposing a conceptual framework to analyze and quantify the congruence between
sl-FFRs obtained from several independent markers. Like delineation methods based on population-level statistical
approaches, our method can distinguish closely-related species that have not yet reached reciprocal monophyly at
most or all of their loci; like tree-based approaches, it can yield meaningful conclusions using a number of independent
markers as low as three. Future efforts will aim to develop programs that speed up the construction of haplowebs from
FASTA sequence alignments and help perform the congruence analysis outlined in this article.

Background
Species delimitation is an old issue in biology that continues to attract considerable attention [1-3] as the present global biodiversity crisis makes it of paramount
importance to delineate and identify as objectively as

possible species-level taxa [4]. The widespread occurrence of cryptic species [5] and the problems they pose
in ecological, physiological and genetic studies [6] also
call for the establishment of methods that can be
applied by scientists from a variety of backgrounds and
not solely by specialized taxonomists.
As pointed out by de Queiroz [7], diverging lineages

properties that allow their recognition as distinct

species. Among the different categories of characters
(e.g., morphological, immunological, ecological or molecular) suitable for assessing the divergence between
lineages, DNA sequences have gained increasing popularity among taxonomists in recent years as they are, in
many cases, not influenced by environmental conditions
nor by the life stage of the organisms under scrutiny;
moreover, gathering information on DNA markers
requires less taxon-specific training and expertise than
for other categories of characters [8]. Methods for delimiting species based on molecular sequence data can be
broadly classified in two categories: tree-based, and
non-tree-based [1]. Tree-based methods use models
of sequence evolution to reconstruct nodes that represent hierarchical kinship relationships among organisms
in a historical perspective, whereas non-tree-based
approaches use population genetic models to look for
evidence of barriers or restrictions to gene flow among
and within extant populations.
Even though “a highly corroborated hypothesis of
lineage separation (i.e., of the existence of separate
species) requires multiple lines of evidence” [9], as a
first approach it may be desirable to choose a species
delimitation criterion that is as general as possible and
can be used systematically. Since a recent survey found
23% of species reported in the literature to be either
poly- or paraphyletic at the various loci investigated
[10], a sensitive delimitation method should be capable
of detecting closely related species at an early stage of
lineage divergence, when most of their genetic loci
have not yet reached reciprocal monophyly (Figure 1).
Moreover, it would be advantageous to use as a general yardstick for delimiting species a method that
does not make restrictive assumptions regarding the
genetics of the marker used (e.g., the absence of copynumber variations) and of the populations studied
(e.g., random mating).
One such method applicable to sexually reproducing
organisms was proposed 15 years ago by Doyle [11]:
briefly, this approach uses information on the cooccurrence of alleles in the diploid phase to delineate,
for each marker investigated, groups of individuals sharing a common “allele pool”. In Doyle’s terminology
these groups of individuals are named “fields for recombination” (FFRs), following an earlier proposal by Carson
[12] to consider species as groups of individuals whose
alleles recombine through segregation and meiosis.
Doyle’s method relies on the expectation that it takes
less time for diverging populations to reach mutual
allelic exclusivity than reciprocal allelic monophyly
(Figure 1): hence, groups of individuals that do not have
any allele in common can be assumed to belong to
distinct species even though they are not reciprocally
monophyletic.

In Doyle’s original proposal, a first step is to delineate,
for each genetic locus under scrutiny, single-locus FFRs
(sl-FFRs). However, “with sufficiently fine resolution, the
allele pool may not extend beyond the single heterozygous individuals in which two alleles coexist": in such
situation, “many more allele pools are recognized, and
concomitantly there are more FFRs, each consisting of a
single individual” [11]. To overcome this problem, Doyle
proposes to use information on the co-occurrence of
alleles from different loci to lump sl-FFRs into multilocus FFRs (ml-FFRs): if individuals A and B belong to the
same sl-FFR for marker 1, and individuals B and C
belong to the same sl-FFR for marker 2, then individuals
A, B and C belong to the same ml-FFR. One drawback
of this approach, however, is that it combines information from all available markers, which makes it difficult
to judge the reliability of the ml-FFRs obtained (for
instance, the inclusion of a single ancestrally shared or
recently introgressed sequence in a dataset would cause
the whole analysis to yield incorrect conclusions). Moreover, Doyle’s method requires determining the alleles of
many individuals for several codominant nuclear markers: until recently, this could only be done for lowresolution and/or homoplasy-plagued markers such as
allozymes or microsatellites, which probably explains
why earlier attempts to use this method for species delimitation were unsuccessful [13-15].
In the last few years, new techniques have emerged
that make it possible to obtain information-rich allelic
sequences from heterozygous individuals without cloning [16,17]. Sequences obtained from exon-primed,
introns-crossing (EPIC) nuclear markers [18], as a result,
appear now well suited for delimiting species using
Doyle’s method. And since such sequences are of finite
(and usually moderate) length, a simple strategy to
obtain sl-FFRs that accurately delineate reproductively
isolated populations is to sequence a large number of
individuals. One may then assess the reliability of the
resulting species boundaries by checking whether they
are supported by several independent molecular markers, a congruence approach [19,20] that presents the
advantage of not mixing together information from different sources.
Here we propose to revive and invigorate Doyle’s
approach by extending it in two directions. First, we
present a reliable graphical method to delineate sl-FFRs
in large datasets using haplowebs (a contraction of “haplotype webs”): these two-dimensional representations are
obtained from conventional haplotype networks ("haplonets”) by adding connections between haplotypes
found co-occurring in heterozygous individuals, i.e. haplotypes that belong to the same allele pool sensu Doyle.
And second, we introduce a procedure to complement
the ml-FFR approach (used by Doyle to infer species

Figure 1 Mutual exclusivity vs. reciprocal monophyly. To illustrate the concepts of mutual exclusivity and reciprocal monophyly, let us
visualize how the alleles in a gene tree are distributed at the various stages of the process of speciation. Unless the genetic polymorphism of
the ancestor species is very low (for instance following a strong bottleneck event), sequencing at T0 any variable marker from a number of
individuals of this species would yield a diversity of sequences (haplotypes 10 to 60, in pink). Following speciation, the two resulting sister
species inherit the polymorphism of their common ancestor and are thus initially indistinguishable, but their sequences immediately start to
diverge as some haplotype lineages get extinct through genetic drift (lineage sorting) while others accumulate mutations. If effective population
sizes are large, genetic drift acts more slowly than mutations: in such case, the two sister species become genetically distinguishable at T1 when
their sets of sequences are mutually exclusive (haplotypes 11, 31, 41, 51 in red, haplotypes 21 and 61 in blue), i.e. the two species do not share
any sequence; reciprocal monophyly is reached at a later stage (T2, haplotypes 12 to 62), or may theoretically never be reached if the effective
population size is infinite. In all cases, mutual exclusivity is reached before or at the same time as reciprocal monophyly: hence, mutual
exclusivity is a more powerful and sensitive criterion than reciprocal monophyly to delineate species.

boundaries from several markers) with an analysis of the
congruence between markers, by scoring each possible
bipartition of the set of individuals according to the
number of independent marker supporting it. These two
approaches are illustrated with a detailed example of
their application to taxonomically difficult corals of the
genus Pocillopora (Figure 2) collected around Clipperton, an atoll located in the far eastern Pacific Ocean.

Results
Nuclear and mitochondrial markers yield putative specieslevel groupings of individuals

Two nuclear markers and two fragments of the mitochondrial genome were successfully sequenced from each of
the 74 Pocillopora samples that we had collected around
Clipperton. Haplonets were constructed for each nuclear
marker and for the concatenation of the two mitochondrial markers; the haplonets obtained from each nuclear
marker were subsequently converted into haplowebs by
drawing additional connections between haplotypes found
co-occurring in heterozygous individuals.
The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) are variable
non-coding regions located in the nuclear ribosomal
DNA that have been proposed as a universal specieslevel marker in corals [21]. In the present study we
focused on the ITS2 region, located between the
5.8S and 28S ribosomal genes. Fifteen different ITS2
sequences were detected (Figure 3a), the most common
of which was found in 47 individuals (out of 74)
whereas eight sequences were singletons (i.e., were only
present in one individual each). Visual inspection of the
resulting haploweb (Figure 3b) revealed four allele pools
(sensu Doyle) comprising 10, 2, 2 and 1 sequences; the
corresponding four sl-FFRs comprised 55, 17, 1 and 1
individuals, respectively.
As a second supposedly independent nuclear marker,
we sequenced an intron of the ATP synthase b subunit
(ATPSb) gene: 23 distinct ATPSb haplotypes were
detected (Figure 4), the most common of which was
found in 32 individuals whereas 9 haplotypes were singletons. The corresponding haploweb revealed two slFFRs: the larger allele pool included 20 haplotypes
found in 57 individuals, whereas the smaller one
included 3 haplotypes found in 17 individuals.
As for the two mitochondrial fragments (the putative
control region and a highly variable ORF of unknown
function [22]), haplowebs were not suited to analyze
them since they were not recombining (a single haplotype was found in each individual, as is usually the case
with mitochondrial markers); hence, individuals were
simply sorted into haplogroups according to the mitochondrial haplotype they possessed. Only four different
haplotypes were detected among the 74 samples analyzed (Figure 5): the most common haplotype, found in

Page 4 of 14

52 coral colonies, was separated by only one mutation
from the two less common ones (respectively found in 2
and 3 individuals), whereas the fourth haplotype, present
in 17 individuals, was 16 mutations away.
The congruence between independent groupings can be
quantified using bipartition scores

Each of our three independent datasets (ITS, ATPSb
and the combined mitochondrial regions) supported
several possible species boundaries, but combining the
results of the two nuclear markers following Doyle’s
approach yielded two ml-FFRs comprising respectively
57 and 17 individuals. To assess the reliability of this
result, we considered all possible bipartitions of our 74
samples and scored them according to the number of
markers supporting them (Table 1); the mitochondrial
regions were included in this analysis as a single marker
independent from the two nuclear ones. Generally
speaking, the number of possible bipartitions of a set of
n objects is 2n-1-1 (if one excludes the trivial case “all
objects vs. none of them”): hence, a dataset comprised
of two sl-FFRs (or two haplogroups) supports a single
bipartition, a dataset comprised of three sl-FFRs (or
three haplogroups) supports 3 bipartitions, a dataset
comprised of four sl-FFRs (or four haplogroups) supports 7 bipartitions, etc.
The ATPSb haploweb detected a single putative species boundary in our dataset, partitioning it in two slFFRs comprising respectively 57 and 17 individuals.
Since the ITS2 haploweb was comprised of 4 sl-FFRs, it
supported 7 possible bipartitions of our set of 74 individuals, only one among which was also supported by the
other nuclear marker. As for the combined mitochondrial regions, they delineated four haplogroups among
our samples (as defined by the mitochondrial haplotype
they harbored): out of the 7 possible bipartitions supported by this marker, one was also supported by the
ITS2 and ATPSb datasets.
Among the 13 bipartitions supported by at least one
marker, none was supported by two markers and one was
supported by all of them (Table 1). This single wellsupported bipartition divides our set of samples into two
populations of 57 and 17 individuals (Figure 6) that do not
share any allele at the three independent genetic loci
investigated: according to the mutual allelic exclusivity criterion (Figure 1), these two populations thus represent distinct species, here designated Pocillopora sp. A and
Pocillopora sp. B pending further taxonomic examination.

Discussion
Using haplowebs to delineate sl-FFRs: delimiting species
without a priori hypotheses

As illustrated with our Pocillopora example, haplowebs
provide a simple, intuitive way to delineate sl-FFRs

Figure 2 Morphological diversity of the coral genus Pocillopora in Clipperton. Corals of the genus Pocillopora are common on nearly all
tropical reefs except in the Caribbean. Their taxonomy is extremely confusing due to their extensive phenotypic plasticity, and clear-cut
diagnostic morphological characters are missing for most currently defined species [35]: hence, individuals that cannot be reliably identified are
common. Clipperton Island is a very good and somewhat extreme example of this confusion, with different taxonomic experts having
recognized successively three [50], one or two [51], three [52] and six [53] species among specimens collected around this atoll. We illustrate
here a small sample of this morphological variation: from left to right and top to bottom, colony 05Clip026, colonies 05Clip052 (left side of the
picture, green) and 05Clip053 (right side of the picture, brown), colony 05Clip045, colony 05Clip018, colony 05Clip019, colony 05Clip002.
According to the results of the molecular analyses presented in this article, the colonies in the four first photographs belong to one species
(Pocillopora sp. A) and the last two colonies belong to another (Pocillopora sp. B), a delineation far from obvious based on their morphology.

Figure 3 ITS haplonet and haploweb. (a) As a first step in the analysis, a haplotype network (in short, “haplonet”) was build from the
alignment of all ITS sequences. Since 31 individuals were heterozygous and 43 were homozygous for this marker, the alignment comprised 105
sequences, among which 15 different haplotypes could be distinguished (represented as circles on the haplonet, with diameters proportional to
the number of individuals harboring each of them). Each haplotype is connected to one or several others by straight lines representing the
evolutionary paths inferred by the network-building algorithm (numbers in red on the lines represent mutated positions in the alignment). (b) As
a second step, the haplonet was converted into a haplotype web (in short, “haploweb”) by adding curves connecting haplotypes found cooccurring in heterozygous individuals (the width of each curve is drawn proportional to the number of heterozygotes harboring the two
haplotypes it connects). This allowed us to delineate 4 pools of co-occurring haplotypes (enclosed in green dashes on the figure). To each of
these 4 allele pools corresponds a group of individuals (called single-locus fields for recombination, or sl-FFR in Doyle’s terminology), whose
names are listed inside boxes with arrows pointing on the corresponding allele pool: these 4 sl-FFRs comprised respectively 55, 17, 1 and 1
individuals.

Figure 5 Mitochondrial haplonet. Since there was only one mitochondrial sequence per individual, the haplonet obtained from this marker
could not be converted into a haploweb (there were no co-occurring haplotypes). However, 4 haplogroups could be distinguished that
comprised respectively 52, 17, 3 and 2 individuals.

from a set of nuclear sequences and represent them
graphically. In this article we chose to represent haplowebs by adding connections between co-occurring
haplotypes on top of haplotype networks (since network-building algorithms are arguably more suited to
reconstruct intra-specific genealogies than are phylogenetic methods [23]), but it should be emphasized that

haplowebs can also be drawn atop phylogenetic trees if
one wishes to do so.
Usual tree-based methods can only delineate species that
are reciprocally monophyletic (except for some speciestree approaches based on the coalescent that show great
promise for the future [24] but still often return incorrect
results when applied to species delimitation [25]), whereas

Figure 6 Bipartition reconciliation. (a) In order to determine graphically the number of well-supported groups of individuals, bipartitions can
be represented on a two-dimensional figure as lines or curves (each of them dividing the group of samples analyzed into two). Some groups of
individuals observable in such graph do not correspond to sl-FFRs but rather to intersections of sl-FFRs obtained from different markers: here,
this is the case of individual 05Clip048 and of the large group of samples in the upper right corner of the figure, whose support is equal to zero
as these groups are not supported by any single marker. Each bipartition is numbered from 1 to 13 to facilitate comparison with the respective
lines of Table 1, and is drawn with its thickness proportional to the number of independent datasets supporting it. (b) Bipartitions below an
arbitrary support threshold (here, 50%) may be omitted from such graph for the sake of clarity.

Flot et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:372
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/372

most non-tree-based methods are statistical in nature and
require large sample sizes and numbers of markers in
order for meaningful conclusions to be reached. Another
issue with such statistical approaches is that genotypes
have to be determined for each individual sampled, which
poses problems in cases of polyploïdy, aneuploidy, copynumber variation or chimerism when individuals comprise
variable numbers of haplotypes and the genotypes cannot
be determined (as we experienced in a previous study of
Pocillopora corals from Hawaii [26]). In contrast, the delineation of allele pools using Doyle’s method is based only
on haplotype presence/absence information and thus does
not require knowledge of the respective amount of each
haplotype in the genotype.
Even though haplowebs have their most obvious application in the analysis of nuclear sequence markers, one
may also find them useful when attempting to delineate
species using mitochondrial markers that co-amplify
with nuclear pseudogenes (Numts [27]). Such pseudogenes are common in many taxa [28-32] and can be
very difficult to tell apart from bona fide mitochondrial
sequences [33]. However, pseudogene sequences diverge
following speciation just like other markers, and reproductively isolated species are thus expected to own
mutually exclusive sets of paralogous sequences that
may not be reciprocally monophyletic but will be easily
detected using haplowebs.
A previous survey of Pocillopora’s molecular diversity
based on a single nuclear marker (ITS2) also included
four samples from Clipperton [34]: in this survey, however, the authors took the morphological delimitation of
species in Veron’s Corals of the World [35] as granted
and thus attributed all their samples from Clipperton to
the species “Pocillopora effusus“. Even though they presented compelling evidence for the presence of three
divergent ITS2 types among their samples, they did not
envision in their article the possibility that cryptic Pocillopora species may be present but rather decided to
attribute the observed molecular diversity to interspecific hybridization. This highlights that molecular studies
based on a single marker can easily yield erroneous conclusions, especially when a priori morphological hypotheses hinder the objective analysis of the molecular data
at hand. Moreover, this suggests that the current evidence for interspecific hybridization in corals will have
to be carefully reevaluated once their species-level taxonomy becomes clarified.
Bipartition scoring vs. Doyle’s ml-FFR approach

If analyses using different markers yield different sl-FFRs,
then the simplest explanation is that not enough individuals were sequenced, resulting in some sl-FFRs that are
artefactually smaller than in reality. A straightforward way
of solving this discrepancy would be to increase the

Page 10 of 14

number of individuals in the dataset, but this cannot
always be done: for instance, the sampled populations may
be rare or endangered, the sampling site may be difficult
to access, or time and money may be limiting factors. A
good example of the consequences of severe undersampling can be found in our previously published study of
the genus Pocillopora in Hawaii [26], in which a first
attempt to delineate graphically sl-FFRs was presented: for
each of the four nuclear markers analyzed, numerous
small sl-FFRs were obtained as the number of individuals
sampled (37 in total) turned out to be very insufficient. In
less severe cases, however, Doyle’s ml-FFR method and/or
the bipartition scoring approach presented here can be
used to synthesize the results obtained from all markers
and obtain a putative species delimitation based on all
information available at hand.
Although Doyle’s ml-FFR procedure may superficially
be mistaken for an approach based on congruence (as it
starts first by analyzing each marker separately to find
out sl-FFRs, then combines all the results), it is better
described as a “total evidence” [36,37] approach since
the inclusion of a single aberrant dataset can cause the
whole analysis to yield conclusions that are not supported by any other marker. A possible way to detect
and eliminate such aberrant marker could be to remove
one locus at a time and delineate ml-FFRs using the
remaining ones, but such approach is very timeconsuming and will perform poorly if there are several
aberrant datasets. Our bipartition-scoring approach,
however, solves this problem by making it possible to
compare and quantify the support brought by each marker to the putative species boundaries.
Missing data, when extensive, can jeopardize phylogenetic analyses [38,39], but Doyle’s ml-FFR approach is
relatively immune to this problem since possession of a
single sequence from a known allele pool is a sufficient
criterion for attributing an individual to a given ml-FFR
(even when the sequences of this individual for all other
markers are unavailable). The bipartition scoring
approach presented here, however, only works if sl-FFRs
for all markers are delineated from the same set of
individuals.
Whereas the ml-FFR method proposed by Doyle only
bases itself on the sl-FFRs obtained from nuclear markers, our bipartition scoring approach can include other
types of groupings based on a variety of characters: haploid sequence markers (such as the mitochondrial
regions used in our Pocillopora example), morphological
characters, biochemical or immunological properties,
behavior, etc. Including a few morphological, biochemical or behavioral characters in the bipartition scoring
analysis would provide a nice way to test the congruence of the patterns obtained from there characters
with those obtained from molecular sequence markers.

Flot et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:372
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/372

However, our method of quantifying support supposes
that the grouping used (i.e., all columns in Table 1) be
independent from each other, a requirement easily testable in the case of molecular markers (since non-independent markers are expected to yield congruent gene
trees) but that may prove more difficult to establish for
other kinds of characters: hence, one may prefer to use
solely molecular characters for quantifying the support
of the bipartitions.
Possible pitfalls: dealing with selection, shared ancestral
sequences and introgression/hybridization

One possible issue with using the criterion of mutual
allelic exclusivity to delineate species is that populations inhabiting contrasting environment can have distinct alleles at loci that are differentially selected: for
such markers under selection, one may then end up
with sl-FFRs that are less encompassing than the real
species as they rather delineate intra-specific ecological
niches. However, this problem will only affect markers
that are selected: if several markers are used, there is
good chance that most of them will be neutral or
near-neutral (or that they will be subjected to different
selective pressures), in which case the congruence analysis presented here will still recover the true species
boundaries. Moreover, whenever two sl-FFRs yielded
by a marker turn out to be sympatric populations
inhabiting the same environment, then the chance that
the putative species boundary between them be actually an artefact caused by selection becomes vanishingly small.
Recent introgression and shared ancestral sequences are
two other possible pitfalls of Doyle’s ml-FFR method: the
inclusion of a single recently introgressed sequence or
shared ancestral haplotype in a dataset supporting otherwise the delimitation of species A and B would cause the
immediate collapse of the two corresponding ml-FFRs
into a single unit and yield the erroneous conclusion that
A and B are conspecific. However, the bipartition scoring
approach presented here would not be affected by the
inclusion of a few such “misbehaving” loci as long as a
majority of the markers do behave properly. F1 hybrids
present a more difficult problem since they cannot be
detected by a congruence analysis such as our bipartition
scoring approach. However, if F1 hybrids are relatively
rare in the population (as is usually the case for interspecific hybrids), then they may be spotted in haplowebs as
thin lines connecting large haplotype circles (i.e., infrequent co-occurrence of common haplotypes, which runs
contrary to random-mating expectations). If the same
small set of individuals turns out to be responsible for
such infrequent connections over nearly all molecular
markers analyzed, one may assume with a high level of
certainty that these are F1 hybrids and subsequently

Page 11 of 14

remove them from the analysis to ensure proper species
delimitation.

Conclusions
Haplowebs are versatile tools that combine properties
from both tree-based and non-tree-based approaches to
species delineation: like the former, haplowebs can provide
meaningful conclusions from relatively few markers without relying on population genetic models, and like the latter, they allow detection of potential species boundaries at
an early stage of divergence when populations have not
yet reached reciprocal allelic monophyly. The method
used for building haplowebs from sets of sequences and
for analyzing the congruence between them is straightforward and reproducible: hence, our next step will be to
develop programs that speed up the construction of haplowebs from FASTA sequence alignments and help perform
the congruence analysis presented in this article.
Methods
Sample collection and processing

Fragments from 74 Pocillopora coral colonies were collected while scuba diving or snorkeling on the reefs surrounding Clipperton Island (10°18’00’’N, 109°13’00"W)
from 5 to 14 March 2005 during the international expedition organized by Jean-Louis Etienne. Each colony
sampled was photographed underwater and its depth
recorded (Table 2). Coral tissues were preserved in buffered guanidium thiocyanate solution [40,41] and their
DNA purified on an ABI Prism 6100 Nucleic Acid
PrepStation.
PCR amplification and sequencing

We selectively amplified and sequenced two regions of
the mitochondrial genome previously identified as the
most variable in Pocillopora [22], and two nuclear markers that had been shown to yield useful information on
species delimitations in this genus [42,26]. Briefly,
amplifications were performed in 25 μl reaction mixes
containing 1x Red Taq buffer, 264 μM dNTP, 5%
DMSO, 0.3 μM PCR primers (Table 3), 0.3 units Red
Taq (Sigma), and 10-50 ng DNA. PCR conditions comprised an initial denaturation step of 60 s at 94°C, followed by 40-50 cycles (30 s denaturation at 94°C, 30 s
annealing at 53°C, 75 s elongation at 72°C) and a final
5-min elongation step at 72°C. PCR products were
sequenced in both directions (see primers in Table 3),
and sequences were assembled and cleaned using
Sequencher 4 (Gene Codes).
Determination of nuclear haplotypes

The ITS2 chromatograms obtained from 31 individuals
and the ATPSb chromatograms obtained from 46 individuals contained double peaks, indicating that each of these

individuals possessed two sequence types. Finding out the
sequence types was trivial for 11 pairs of ITS2 chromatograms that contained only one double peak. The ITS2 chromatogram of 15 individuals and the ATPSb chromatogram
of 32 individuals had numerous double peaks as expected
in the case of length-variant heterozygotes [43,16], and their
superposed sequences were directly deconvoluted using the
program CHAMPURU [44] (available online at http://www.
mnhn.fr/jfflot/champuru). The remaining chromatograms

(of 5 individuals for ITS2 and of 14 individuals for ATPSb)
had a few double peaks and belonged to heterozygotes
whose allelic sequences were of identical lengths: those
were resolved statistically by reference to the rest of the
dataset using SeqPHASE [45] (available online at http://
www.mnhn.fr/jfflot/seqphase) and PHASE [46]. All in all
there were 53 distinct multilocus genotypes among our 74
samples; 46 multilocus genotypes turned out to belong to
Pocillopora sp. A and the 7 others to Pocillopora sp. B.

Construction of haplonets and haplowebs

Sequences were aligned in MEGA4 [47] and deposited in
public databases [GenBank:FR729101-FR729473]. DNA
regions so variable that homology was uncertain were
removed from the ITS2 and ATPSb alignments. Alignments were converted to the Roehl format using DnaSP
[48]; median-joining haplotype networks [49] were constructed using Network 4.1 (available online at http://
www.fluxus-engineering.com/) and converted into
enhanced metafiles (emf) using Network Publisher
(Fluxus Technology). Finally, enhanced metafiles were
imported in Microsoft PowerPoint to add colors and connections between co-occurring haplotypes (drawn with
their thickness proportional to the number of individuals
in which the said haplotypes were found co-occurring).
Bipartition scoring and reconciliation

Each possible bipartition of our 74 samples into two complementary sets of individuals was scored according to the
number of independent datasets supporting it. The support of each bipartition was calculated as the percentage
of independent datasets that supported this bipartition.
A cutoff value of 50% was arbitrarily set to discriminate
well-supported bipartitions from those with little or no
support, and the bipartitions were reconciled in a twodimensional graph to determine the number of wellsupported groups of individuals (i.e., putative species)
among our samples.
